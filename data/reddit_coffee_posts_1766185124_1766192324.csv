I’m a 27-year-old male living in Mitte and would love to expand my social circle here in Berlin. I and am always up for good conversation about anything from hobbies to culture.

Recently, I tried skydiving and realized I have a bit of an adventurous streak, so I’d love to meet others who are into trying new things, outdoor activities, cool events around the city, or just sitting at Treptower Park 😅. But also totally down for laid-back evenings, chatting over drinks or coffee, whatever vibe suits.

If anyone's in a similar situation and looking to make new friends, share experiences, or maybe even find people for spontaneous adventures. Just drop me a message or reply here! 
Always happy to connect with other like-minded folks.",1,1766192258.0,berlinsocialclub,0,1.0,False

Unfortunately I don’t have a machine atm so I was wondering 

Do my you guys know of any way the make espresso of something similar without a machine? I use Colombian coffee beans in case that’s useful

**START HERE: EXPEDITIONS & MISADVENTURES**

*Welcome aboard the Nor'easter.*

Expeditions & Misadventures is a genre-bending, time-skipping, paradox-waltzing narrative that follows the exploits of Mouse Capone, Minx, Blue Puppy, and a rotating cast of strange allies, timeless enemies, and morally confused artifacts.

It's absurd. It's layered. It's heartfelt. It's everything you’d expect from a pulp novel buried in the Vatican’s forbidden library—and just as ridiculous.

Whether you’re here for adventure, high-concept sci-fi, historical send-ups, or a glimpse of something more tender and human beneath the chaos, this is your boarding platform.

---

**What’s the vibe?**
- *Noir caper meets mythic time travel*
- *Adventure serial energy meets philosophical sci-fi*
- *Spiritual weight wrapped in comedic timing*
- *Characters that fail upward, or sideways, or backwards in time*

---

**Main Crew:**
- **Mouse Capone** – the trench-coated, wide-hatted rogue with a tendency to walk into traps on purpose
- **Minx** – master of strategy and secrets, with a timeline-clashing family curse
- **Blue Puppy** – chaos courier with a good heart, a questionable resume, and a growing feud with the Vatican
- **White Leopard** – quiet menace wrapped in diplomacy, haunting more than helping

---

**Where to begin:**
Here’s your curated on-ramp. These posts give you tone, character, lore, and momentum.

1. **The Curse of the Pharaoh’s Mask** *(Season 1, Ep 1)*
   - The one that started it all. A cursed relic. A botched theft. A mummy with an agenda.

2. **A Manner Darkly** *(Season 4, Ep 2)*
   - Minx and Blue Puppy try to keep a town under control while Mouse Capone is away. It goes poorly.

3. **Nighttime in the Temple of the Moon** *(Season 2, Ep 10)*
   - The ancient moon temple. Sabotage. Shadows. And a calm resolve at the center of madness.

4. **Nighttime in the Temple of the Sun** *(Season 2, Ep 11)*
   - Mouse Capone finds himself replacing Atlas. For a while. It’s exactly as literal as it sounds.

5. **Epilogue II: The Storyteller’s Ink** *(Season 3 Finale)*
   - Flight, quiet, memory. A rare moment of peace in the long run.

---

**Suggested Reading Style:**
Non-linear. Think story quilt. Jump around. Let tone guide you. When in doubt, follow the hat.

More chaos drops and visual expansions are posted regularly on the hdfidelity subreddit. Feel free to reach out, drop theories, or join the crew.

Just remember: nobody *ever* really knows what time it is.

*“Trust the current. Hold the branch. Keep going.”*

**START HERE: JESS BEYOND REPAIR**

*There’s blood on the ledger and lipstick on the porcelain. The Countess takes her coffee black and her grudges long.*

**Jess Beyond Repair** is a street-noir tragicomedy set in the crumbling halls of aristocracy. Countess Jessica Harrow—widow, regulator, velvet fist—is the kind of woman who lights a match before asking where the fuse is. By day, she tends to her estate and keeps the estate’s chaos at bay. By night, she handles road-level conflict with a crowbar, cold wit, and a smile that means business.

It’s dark, stylish, and morally askew. Think Fleabag if she ran a manor and enforced local order like a benevolent gangster.

---

**What’s the vibe?**
- *Fleabag* meets *Peaky Blinders* with a splash of *Dead to Me*  
- *Heirloom trauma and street code in eveningwear*  
- *Black humor, class tension, sibling grief, and poorly iced cake*

---

**Main Players:**
- **Countess Jessica Harrow** – widow, noble, and possibly the only reason half the region hasn’t burned down yet
- **Her sister-in-law** – a silent storm of judgment living under the same roof
- **The Niece** – a Scouse brat with a sweet tooth and a sharp tongue
- **The Officers, the Old Money, and the Rats** – those who seek her favor, or her ruin

---

**Where to begin:**
Slide into the silk-and-ash of it all:

1. **The Velvet Favor** – A request is made. Jess does not say yes. She delivers anyway.

2. **The Cake Incident** – The niece is not to be trifled with. Or left unsupervised.

3. **The Library Argument** – Legacy, language, and a ledger out of place.

4. **Jess and the Street** – A flashback. A reckoning. A crowbar.

5. **The Dinner That Wasn’t** – A social engagement derails. An arrangement is solidified in silence.

---

**Suggested Reading Style:**
Late night. A glass of something bitter. Read fast, then read it again. She talks with her eyes.

More fragments, fables, and firecracker dialogue drop when you least expect them. hdfidelity always has a seat at the table.

*“You can inherit land. You earn fear.”*

**START HERE: MEANWHILE AT THE ABBEY**

*The rain never quite lets up. The tea is always just about to steep. The past isn’t past—it’s walking the cloisters.*

**Meanwhile at the Abbey** is a slow-burning period chamber drama set in and around L’Avon Abbey, a centuries-old religious order tangled in inheritance law, grief, prophecy, and petty rivalries. It’s a place where quiet glances carry meaning, and sermons cut deeper than politics.

If you’ve ever wanted to sip storm-chilled cider while unraveling a minor theological betrayal that snowballs into generational fracture—welcome home.

---

**What’s the vibe?**
- *The Crown* meets *The Leftovers*  
- *Chamber drama with spiritual weight*  
- *Cozy, haunted, poetic*  
- *Sacred doubt and overcooked porridge*   

---

**Main Figures:**
- **The Scribes** – earnest, and possibly divinely touched—or losing their grip
- **Father DeJohn** – the sharpest tongue in the sermon circuit, both feared and admired
- **The Duke** – unseen more than seen, but casting a long shadow across the river
- **The Abbey Itself** – a character in all but name, with its own quiet, watching memory

---

**Where to begin:**
Your meditative entry point, if you please:

1. **The Sunday Sermon After** – Father DeJohn delivers a subtle rebuke to unseen ears, and everyone pretends not to notice.

2. **Brother Aelius’s Retreat** – Alone among the books and rain, the youngest monk begins to unravel.

3. **The Discussion in the Dining Hall** – The elder brothers speculate with wit, concern, and veiled tones.

4. **The Question of Chapel Road** – A reflection on the town, its naming, and how memory takes hold.

5. **A Map of the Abbey** – Orientation by way of history and whisper.

---

**Suggested Reading Style:**
Quiet evening. Low light. Let the subtext rise. The Abbey is best visited unhurried.

More fragments, sketches, and layered mysteries unfold weekly on the hdfidelity subreddit. Keep your hood up. Some truths carry weight.

*“Even silence echoes, if the stone remembers the voice.”*

**START HERE: PUERTO RICANS IN SPACE**

*Welcome to the Freehold. You’re already late.*

Puerto Ricans in Space is a political sci-fi epic set in the 25th century, where Puerto Rico has become a constitutional monarchy with a powerful space program, rival kingdoms, and colonial scars that haven’t fully healed. At its core, this story is about espionage, expansion, identity, and the cost of vision.

If you’ve ever wanted to watch a prince trade secrets with corrupt trade barons while an exiled spy sabotages launch systems on a Martian border colony—you’re in the right place.

---

**What’s the vibe?**

- *Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy meets The Expanse*
- *Sociopolitical thriller meets post-colonial reckoning*
- *Hard sci-fi worldbuilding wrapped in personal fallout*
- *Honor, betrayal, and the weight of ambition across generations*

---

**Main Players:**

- **Governor Prince Sebastián Montalvo y Estrella** – a monarch raised in legacy and conflict, managing peace with poise and a knife under the desk
- **Brandt** – the foreign-born adventure capitalist with imperial designs and a network of sabotage agents
- **The Senate & Lords** – divided, scheming, deeply entrenched; some want the future, others just want to survive it
- **External Powers** – Spain, the U.S., and Russia watch the Martian Freehold like hungry sharks

---

**Where to begin:**
Here’s your curated access ramp into the tangled orbit.

1. **The Salted Earth (Part I)** – The sabotage begins. The cracks in the program appear. Sebastián receives his first whisper of Brandt’s betrayal.

2. **The Salted Earth (Part II)** – Counter-investigation and confrontation. The quiet chess match escalates.

3. **The Salted Earth (Part III)** – Brandt maneuvers in desperation as Sebastián solidifies power.

4. **Ensign Helmut Osiribus – Holodisk Reader Scene** – Aftermath and reverence. A quiet nod to the weight of truth.

---

**Suggested Reading Style:**
Linear. Political thriller. Follow the investigation. Pay attention to dialogue and the unspoken. This one burns slow, but the payoff is deep.

New chapters and offshoots appear across hdfidelity. Drop in anytime. We’re always one step from another blackout.

**START HERE: THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY NATIONS**

*At the turn of the 20th century, the world’s great powers secretly form a coalition of spies, scientists, mystics, and soldiers—not to prevent war, but to delay the apocalypse.*

**The League of Extraordinary Nations** is a geopolitical pulp adventure that blends the intrigue of early 20th century diplomacy with the absurdity of forgotten technology, supernatural echoes of colonial sin, and the delicate art of espionage in a world that refuses to stay rational.

It’s The Grand Budapest Hotel with a diplomatic passport and a flamethrower briefcase. Stylish. Cerebral. Tongue in cheek. Completely committed to the bit.

---

**What’s the vibe?**
- *The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen* meets *The Man from U.N.C.L.E.* by way of *Hellboy*  
- *World’s Fairs, exorcist diplomats, art heists, and cursed telegrams*  
- *Historical absurdism meets occult pragmatism*  

---

**Key Operatives:**
- **Agent R—** Britain’s liaison with a monocle and a mood
- **Madame Soule** – France’s telepathic archivist (allegedly retired, absolutely not)
- **The Mongolian Concordat** – An entire thread built around a secret summit that never officially happened
- **The Kaiser’s Ghost** – A recurring enemy/ally depending on the spectral weather

---

**Where to begin:**
The file cabinet opens here:

1. **The Zimmermann Telegram Revisited** – A double-bluff, a double agent, and a train that shouldn’t exist

2. **The Mongolian Concordat** – A summit in the high steppes where no one speaks first

3. **The Dutch Shipyard Incident** – Sabotage, steam-powered divers, and a clock counting backward

4. **The Janus Letters** – Two identical messages sent to two enemies. One ends a war. The other starts a curse.

---

**Suggested Reading Style:**
Lean into the pulp. Imagine a creased manila file folder under your arm. Sip something strong. Laugh once. Then keep reading.

Dispatches from this world drop irregularly on hdfidelity, usually when the weather shifts and a treaty expires.

And lots of water plus 1 to 2 cups of coffee per day. And week 1 I pooped on day 7 after 2 days of taking 4 ducolax. Week 2 same. Then my doctor prescribed me some fiber stool softener to add to my smoothie so I do that daily. We are on week 3 and I took like 6 ducolax over 2 days and just went now for like 1h non stop. Again on day 7. And it's terrible. I'm nauseous and the laxatives give me shakes. And terrible cramps.  I've lost 10 lbs in 3 weeks.  So that makes me happy but I can't keep using laxative.

Or they make ice cream combos in the cup or an ice cream sandwich with cookies, idk waffles, croissants, etc. absolutely nasty. Yet every person for some reason under comments is all like “Yumm😍.” No Suzy, it’s not yum, I don’t see how eating 500 calories filled with 99% of fucking sugar is “delicious,” or “TASTY,” in the slightest. 

Food in general should be about the FOOD, the FLAVORS, and TEXTURE, not sugar enhancers to the extreme. Yes, of course add some sugar, natural organic cane or plant-based even better, add spices and seasonings. But for the sugar or other sugar-based additive,  please, keep it to a minimum. I’m talking biscoff cookies in a loaded pie, cupcakes, Crumbl cookies. Ew crumbl and any other stuffed fat cookie businesses are ….something else. 

And, in my defense, i will say i have sensitive taste buds, not that there’s anything “wrong” with them, but having sensitive ones if anything, means more awareness about  what im eating.

For some context: for as long as I can remember, she’s never had any real hobbies or particular likes/interests. She has always been a workaholic and kept herself very busy with various business ventures and never taken time for anything else. Therefore anything hobby-like that she would need to take time for, she would never use (we’ve tried). I live cross country from here and thus can’t do any favor/experience gifts with her.

She does NOT like coffee, chocolates/sweets, movies or books. 

She is always very cold and some gift hits in the past have been electric handheld warmers and a heated jacket, but I think i’ve run that well dry.

1pr173o,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1pr173o/feeling_almost_in_a_uni_friend_group_and_dont/,"Feeling ""almost in"" a uni friend group and don't know if I should accept it or keep trying","I'm a second-year university student and I'm struggling with a social dynamic that's making me spiral a bit, and I want an outside, honest perspective.

Here's the situation:
Before first year, I connected on Instagram with a girl (K) from my small hometown who was going to the same university as me. We hit it off over text, but for various reasons we didn't really connect in person during first year. Fast forward to this past summer, I was back home, bored, and reached out again. Since then, we've become genuinely close, or so l think so, we go out together a lot, text regularly, travel back to our hometown together for holidays, and she vents to me about her life. Her boyfriend even openly says I'm the only friend of hers he actually likes.

The complication is this.

K has two close friends from first year, X and Y. X lives with K now (they signed a lease together for two years), and Y lives farther away and isn't around much. Since reconnecting with K, l've been going out with the group a lot. In person, I genuinely feel included, conversations are good, vibes are fine, no awkwardness, a lot of fun etc, but structurally, I feel outside.

There's a group chat with the three of them that I'm not in. They also have ""spam""/finsta accounts and I'm not on X or Y's. I know social media isn't everything, but those things feel symbolic of closeness, especially in uni. I'm on K's VSCO and she posts photos of us there, which helps, but the difference still nags at me.

It's worth noting Y isn't really around much at all even when I'm out with K, out with K and X, studying with them, at their place, etc etc. she lives farther off but comes down for the important stuff like birthdays.

The bigger issue came up around birthdays.
Recently (like yesterday), I found out X is having a birthday dinner with friends, and I'm not invited. K told me about it directly, no hiding, no lying, so I don't think anyone is being sneaky or malicious. But it still hurt.

Especially because l've always said yes to X being included in group hangs (even the first time K and I hung out). I also know X and I get along in person, but she doesn't really text me or initiate plans. We mostly interact because of K. She has texted me initiating plans twice and l've very happily agreed but then she's changed her mind. She kind of has a nonchalant personality.

This made me realize: I'm very close with K, but I'm not close with X, and barely know Y (even though she's barely there anyway). So l'm ""inside"" one relationship but not embedded in the group structure.

I keep wondering: Did I mess up by not connecting with K properly in first year? Am I always going to be K's friend, not part of the group? Is it realistic to expect to ever be fully ""in,"" or should I accept that this might never turn into a tight friend group?

I also have my own birthday coming up in January. I want to invite everyone, including my other friends (including K, X, Y), but I'm worried about looking like I'm pushing it or setting myself up to feel rejected if someone says no. At the same time, not inviting them feels like I'm shrinking myself out of fear.

I don't think anyone is doing anything wrong. I just feel stuck in this ""almost included"" position where l'm close enough to care but not close enough to feel secure. I want to know whether I’ll ever be included in that way. 

I'd appreciate honest advice, especially from people who've been through something similar in uni. It's only been 4 months since connecting with K and of course it's hard be of finals and stuff of course but we all go out whenever we can. I'm never excluded we always go out together and K always initiates plans, as do I.

Another layer to this is that I do have other friends and I genuinely love them. They're kind, supportive, and important to me. But they're not really nightlife or ""let's go out and make dumb memories"" people. I don't create many classic university memories with them like nights out, spontaneous plans, or social chaos. They can also be a bit judgemental, and they're more so ""let's just have a coffee"" type of people.

Last year, I actually did have a few girls I went out with a lot, but they ended up dropping out of university and disappearing from campus entirely... so very uncalled for.

That's a big reason why having a group matters to me. I'm not trying to replace my existing friends or say they're not enough. I just wanted at least a few girls to experience that side of university with.
I hope that makes sense. Please let me know if you need clarification on anything. Am I being too hard on myself or rushed or something? Let me know.",1,1766191806.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I don’t speak English fluently, so I asked ChatGPT to help me write this post clearly. I’m looking for advice from this community because I really value Corey Wayne’s principles and I want to handle this situation properly.

I’ve been dating a woman for about 6 months. She hasn’t officially asked to be my girlfriend, but she already acts like we’re in a relationship. She calls me “love,” sends me food, told me she’s being exclusive with me since month 1, got my initials on her nails recently, and shows other behaviors that make it feel like we’re together.

We see each other about once a week and have traveled together. Sex is great, connection is strong. I was the first to say “love” early on, but she’s been reciprocating and getting more affectionate over time.

Also, 95% of the time initiates contact with me

Now, here’s the issue. There are certain things I’ve noticed that I don’t feel comfortable with if we are, in fact, in a serious relationship:

1. **She hangs out one-on-one with male friends.** Like grabbing coffee or spending time alone with them.
2. **She talks often with these male friends.** One of them used to help her at the gym and they still talk regularly, even though they don’t go to the same gym anymore.
3. **She sometimes goes out partying with her girlfriends.** I wouldn’t feel okay with my girlfriend acting like she’s single, going to clubs without me.

I never addressed these things before because we never had the “what are we?” talk, and I know Corey recommends that **she** should bring up exclusivity. But now that it’s been 6 months and she’s clearly showing signs that she sees me as her boyfriend, I think it’s time to talk about my boundaries — **before I get more emotionally invested** and continue spending even more time with her\*\*.\*\*

I want to make it very clear that I don’t want to control her or tell her who she can or can’t be friends with. She’s free to have male friends, **but not spend time alone with them** or behave in ways that don’t align with a serious relationship.

**These are non-negotiables for me.** And I want to talk to her respectfully, with calm masculine energy, not from a place of neediness or insecurity.

**How would you guys recommend I approach this conversation?** How do I communicate my boundaries without sounding toxic or insecure?

I don’t know how to move forward with this and I’m scared. Also, Mom has told me I can’t marry him— well, I could marry him if he was more normal/mature, but she does love him. 

I [26F] am late to realizing the love I have for my best friend [27M] of 8 years has grown beyond platonic affection to the point I cannot ignore anymore without asking for clarification from him. Our friendship is not sustainable as it is for me.

We both identify as bisexual, but I’ve only ever known him to date or be sexually intimate with men throughout our friendship. 

We went to college together and became friends during our freshman year. We studied similar subjects, traveled together, made dinners, shared beds, went to concerts, etc, throughout undergrad. We had other friends outside, but I had considered him one of my closest confidants and still do.

During college, when I thought he was gay, he asked to be friends with benefits. I was confused and offended at the time, as we had been friends for years and I would have wanted a proper relationship instead.  

After graduating, he moved out of state for his graduate program, but he graduated earlier this year and would like to move further away. Currently, we have an 3+ hour airline flight or 15 hour drive between us, but I selfishly want him to be closer. He is in a period of transition with flexibility to move wherever he would like to. He doesn’t agree with the politics of the state I live in, but our parents are aging and live in the same state as me. Mom lives with me, so I cannot easily pick up and migrate. I also secured a stable, reliable job in a field I care about recently, and would like to put in at least a year or two before moving on to my next endeavor. I also completed my graduate program this summer. 

I went up to visit him for his birthday and I stayed over his apartment. He excitedly introduced me to his local friends and showed me the sites to be seen that he knew I would enjoy. We went to zoo-lights, had hot coco, and had dinner with his friends. Overall, I had a lovely time. The first day I was there, he was more affectionate than he has been historically. He let me have a sip of his coffee, he cuddled me on his couch while we watched a romantic movie (his choice), he cuddled me in bed. This isn’t unheard of behavior between us, but I felt incredibly confused because during prior hangouts he stated he wasn’t as interested in cuddling anymore because his ex didn’t like. When I asked him why he was holding me, he told me it was because he knows I like being held. The next morning, he wrapped himself around me to try and wake me up with videos he thought I would find amusing while he pressed himself against my back. Following the second day, he was less affectionate, but I am likely to blame because I cried that evening over feeling selfish and jealous of his friends that get to be closer to him in person. He asked me what was wrong because he noticed my breathing patterned changed. I was initially planning to confess, but I was terrified and ended up partially telling him the truth.

When he last visited me, nearly 8 months ago, we were on a walk and he asked me what would I do if he had another serious partner. I told him that I would naturally back off and respect their relationship, and that I would survive because he had dated people before. At the time, I assumed he meant a male partner. I didn’t even consider how I would feel if he dated a woman. 

We have historically joked about marrying each other. Our maturity levels and interior design choices are different, but I would seriously consider marriage with him.

I realize I have been trying to protect our friendship by downplaying my affection towards him. I am scared to tell him and jeopardize the friendship. I don’t know if he was simply touch starved when I saw him, or if he truly is romantically interested in me. My best platonic girlfriends take me out to dinner and fight over the check with me. I’m courted and babied by my family and loved ones. My friends and I tell each other we love one another all the time.

I am scared to move forward in any direction. I can’t seem to date anyone local because I keep comparing them to him and my friends, and/or I’m not emotionally available enough to even reply to other likely incredible people. I also don’t want to feel like he is settling for me because he didn’t find a male partner (he complains about men on tinder and has complained about not being a twin anymore and asked if I would marry him). 

I don’t know if I should call him, text him, or simply try to move on without bothering him about it. I can’t read the signs and I don’t want to fuck up. I don’t want to ask him for clarification or tell him how I truly feel because I don’t want to influence his life choices or prevent him from happiness. I feel incredibly selfish.

He has asked me before to be direct with him and has expressed that one of the benefits of being best friends is that we can talk about anything with each other. He expressed before that he struggles to read my emotions sometimes. He isn’t always the most intuitive when it comes to others emotions, but he does try to make amends when incidents happen and try’s not to make the same mistake twice. 

I don’t know what to do, dad. I’m scared of losing my friendship with him, but I think if I don’t say anything it will naturally die because of distance and I will be filled with regret.

Please help. 

TLDR: 
I [26F] have more than platonic feelings for my best friend [27M] of eight years. I can’t tell if he reciprocates these sentiments. His actions confuse me. I’m scared to tell him and I don’t even know how to. How do I communicate with him about this?

I was not expecting him to choose the beach or to be more relaxed. It’s crazy though I remember thinking how lovely it would be if he chose the beach.

I had my sister drop me off at the beach, she was complaining about him and I told her to stop because I refuse to complain about him. He is amazing and I truly love him.

He was five minutes late but we met at 12:00pm I was not expecting to be there until 4pm but we were.

We didn’t talk about the past we just owned up to our own mistakes and the fundamental reasons things didn’t work out. I took full accountability. I said I’m in therapy and that I know my abandonment issues and undiagnosed CPSTD (or bpd) has been impacting our relationship. We laughed a lot and he told me about what he did while he was gone, we both talked about how proud we were of each other. We said a lot of “I love yous,” he also told me that he wished he knew theses things (explanation behind my behaviour) before and that it makes him sad hearing these now after everything went down. He explained why he left and I told him that I’m working on myself for myself because I don’t want to be that person again. We made out a lot, and we almost had sex but he said it wasn’t a good idea because we both would cry.

I asked him if there was a possibility we would get back together in the future and he said “maybe but it depends” he said that he doesn’t like indefinites because you never know but he said he won’t say “no” either. He said he cares about me so much and wants me to heal, he said all he cares about is my happiness, he also said for a month he was thinking about this “what if she heals and someone else gets to have her best parts and also the parts I didn’t have.”

Before he left to bring me home he kissed me again and he looked at me and said “you not gonna give up” and I said “I won’t stop climbing this mountain. Will you?” And he said “hell no I will never stop climbing this mountain.”

When he went in my driveway, we kissed again and we had a little conversation. He said he is stopping by in January, to take some things from the apartment.

I think this is really good news and I genuinely feel we are going to end up married together in the future.

I’m big into anything outdoors when the weather’s good like  hiking, kayaking, camping, all that good stuff. Once winter hits though, I fully switch into homebody mode. Give me reading, good coffee, TV show binges, and warm cuddles with the right person and I’m set.

I’m a friendly, laid back guy who can get pretty goofy once I’m comfortable. I love sarcasm and I’m always down for good conversation, whether it’s light, funny, or deeper “talk for hours” type stuff.

Hey everyone. I am putting myself out there to meet new people and hopefully build some easy, genuine connections. I am mainly looking for friendship to start. Good conversations, shared interests, someone to laugh with and feel comfortable around. If things naturally grow into something more, I am definitely open to that as well.

A little about me:
I am 33, born and raised in Michigan. I enjoy anything outdoors during the warmer months. Hiking, kayaking, camping, random day trips, bonfires, and pretty much anything that gets me outside. Once winter arrives, I switch into a more relaxed, at home mode. I enjoy reading, watching good shows, drinking coffee, and just enjoying calm nights in with the right person.

Personality wise, I am friendly, laid back, and easy to talk to. Once I am comfortable with someone, I can be silly, sarcastic, and playful. I love to laugh and I enjoy people who do the same. I appreciate genuine and consistent communication without anything forced or awkward. Just two people getting to know each other at their own pace.

What I am hoping to find:
Someone who wants to talk, share stories, joke around, and build something real. Whether it becomes a solid friendship or turns into something deeper, I am open to either. I am not expecting anything instantly. I just want good energy and a natural connection with someone who is also looking for something meaningful.

I've been stuck in burnout/ survival mode since 2019.

A lot of shit has happened to me since I was a small child, resulting in severe mental illness, CPTSD, disabilities, etc.

  
I'm gradually learning how to stay alive and make it tolerable (or find joy in it even).   
I want my habitat to be a sanctuary and right now it's cluttered and dirty (scarcity mindset/ guilt over wasted resources, growing up poor).  
The typical feelings come up, shame, guilt, overwhelm, anxiety, panic. 

And still, I actually started today. Just with the coffee table and around the couch. 

The funny thing is , I always forget that I've  started so many times. Over and over again and I always forget.  
After the first layer of clutter, I see the attempts at organization from the past. And it's sobering seeing all the effort that your past self has made for you in that moment. Getting over the hurdle of starting is something I've never gotten used to.But I think now i'm learning how to ease the transition. Like having a comfort youtuber  on or scrolling the feed here and hyping myself up with affirmations.

The real piece I think I'm missing is a meditation practice to help me create stronger mental fortitude and distress tolerance. I never realized how powerful that can be to help navigate intrusive thoughts and the echoes of abusers past.

  
I'm finally seeing the fruit of taking essentially six years off to focus exclusively on my health, greif, and learning to navigate chronic thoughts of leaving. 

  
Every day is different sure, and my emotional state is erratic, but there's a feeling in my gut that if i stick to ""1 attempt a day in a very small way,"" maybe this will finally feel like home. And i haven't felt home in a while.

And because it became such a long list, I thought maybe I'd share it here for you to enjoy.. So, here we go, in absolutely no particular order.. 😊

(Please forgive me for all the scents I’ve inevitably forgotten. These opinions are mine, lovingly formed through sampling, overspraying, and reckless financial decisions. They might (and probably will) differ from yours, and that’s okay. 😊🫶

Final note: English is not my mother tongue, so please excuse any grammatical mishaps. If something sounds odd, please let know. 😊 Also an edit for some typos)



Spiritueuse Double Vanille - Guerlain

One of my personal favourites, and honestly, it’s not hard to see why. This is warm, smooth, perfectly blended vanilla excellence. A deep, heavy, grown-up vanilla wrapped in rum, amber, spices and soft woods - and yes, more amber, because why stop when something works? It smells decadent, luxurious and unapologetically opulent, like sipping a perfectly aged spirit in a dimly lit room with expensive furniture you’re afraid to touch.

This is not a playful vanilla. This is vanilla with a credit score. If you have the budget to splurge, absolutely sample it - but let me be clear: this is not a safe blind buy. She demands to be courted first.

 

Tobacco Vanille - TF

Ah yes, thé tobacco vanilla. The reference point. The scent everyone compares everything else to. And for good reason. This opens with the most stunning, rich tobacco note - the kind you’d find in those glorious cigar boxes your grandpa only brought out on special occasions. The spices swirl in and suddenly you’re transported to smoky jazz clubs, creaky wooden floors, leather chairs and record players that definitely cost more than your rent.

The dry-down? A perfectly balanced, classy vanilla with woody and slightly fruity undertones that wraps around you like a well-tailored coat. Is it expensive? Yes. Is it worth it? Also yes. Overhyped to some, nostalgic perfection to others. Another not-safe-to-blind-buy, but an absolute icon.

 

Angélique Noire - Guerlain

A green vanilla, but not in a “trying to be different” way, but in a very beautiful, elegant and successfully executed way. This scent balances fresh, green, sweet and creamy so beautifully it almost feels unfair. The angelica brings freshness, the pear adds gentle sweetness, the pepper sparkles just enough, and the vanilla ties it all together without overpowering the composition.

It’s foresty, slightly herbaceous, and oddly poetic. Imagine standing in a forest during golden hour, the sun slowly dipping below the horizon, sipping sweetened tea while a cool breeze brushes past your face. Hard to explain, impossible to forget. Stunning in spring and warm autumn days. Sample-worthy, without question.

Eau Duelle EDT - Diptique (EDT, EDP is just not as good Imo)

Let’s stay in green vanilla territory a little longer. Eau Duelle is soft, airy, gentle and quietly spicy. It opens with a stunning juniper note that bowls me over every single time - fresh, aromatic and slightly resinous. This is not a loud vanilla. This is a whispered vanilla, drifting through a forest filled with old books, fir trees and faint incense smoke.

Does it lack projection and longevity? Yes. Do I forgive it immediately? Also yes. It shines in autumn, when you want to smell thoughtful, calm and a little mysterious. My only complaint is the price-to-performance ratio - and my bank account agrees.

 

Vanilla Planifolia Extrait 21

Let’s not pretend - this is vanilla royalty. Guerlain doesn’t do vanilla; Guerlain OWNS vanilla. VP is vanilla pushed to its absolute limits: dense, spicy, rich, slightly sweet, and shockingly long-lasting. One spray will outlive your plans, your patience, and possibly your social battery. It will last you all day… and night… and possibly the next fiscal year.

Yes, it costs an arm, a leg, and maybe a kidney - but you’ll only need a microscopic amount. It smells like the finest vanilla beans on earth were personally selected, blessed, and turned into liquid gold. To me, this is the final boss of vanilla perfumes. The queen. I’ve heard whispers of discontinuation, and honestly? At this price point, I’m not sure whether to cry or thank the universe.

 

Indult - Tihota

If you ask someone to define vanilla, they should just hand you this bottle. Tihota is linear, unapologetic, and completely focused on doing one thing exceptionally well. This is rich, dark, high-quality vanilla - no twists, no distractions, no unnecessary drama.

It smells like vanilla bean in its purest, most indulgent form. And while it’s eye-wateringly expensive, it earns its reputation. Longevity is excellent, the scent is flawless, and vanilla lovers consistently rank it among the best. Simple, powerful, and impossible to deny.

 

Bianco Latte

This perfume does not enter a room - it announces itself. With a megaphone, a brassband and an airplane flying overhead with a sign screaming VANILLA. Loud, creamy, buttery, lactonic, sweet and absolutely shameless. It projects like a Times Square billboard and lasts longer than all our New Year’s resolutions combined. If you love gourmand vanillas and want them extra, this one is for you.

It smells like being hit in the face with a vanilla milkshake, then dipped in honey and coumarin for good measure. This scent is not whispering; it’s screaming GOURMAND through a megaphone like a vuvuzela on steroids. Is it subtle? No. Is it incredible? Unfortunately, yes. (Lattafa Eclair is a very similar alternative for an even better price point.)

 

Escapade Gourmande – Maison Mataha

Crème brûlée, but make it couture. This is caramelised brown sugar, airy yet rich, opulent yet elegant. It sits somewhere between indulgent and refined - like dessert served on fine china.

It’s often compared to Fire At Will, but where FAW leans floral, Escapade Gourmande stays firmly in sugar–vanilla–tonka territory. If you want a gourmand vanilla that doesn’t shout like Bianco Latte but still delivers serious deliciousness, this is your girl.

Lira - Xerjoff (casamorati)

This is thé lemony vanilla in my collection - although if we’re being honest, I get more blood orange than lemon. It’s zesty, bright, and immediately mouth-watering, before melting into a rich, caramelised vanilla with a gorgeous cinnamon backbone. In winter, it smells like freshly baked Italian citrus cake made by your nonna, who insists you eat a second slice. In summer, it transforms into warm evenings, shared laughter, and golden sunsets.

There’s a subtle hint of lavender that adds a little sophistication and stops it from becoming a sugar bomb. Cozy, gourmand, joyful - Italian lemon cake at its finest.

Same family: Devotion (louder and sparklier), Akro Bake, Love & Crime (spicier), HoS Hufflepuff (also delicious, also painfully expensive).

 

Gentle Fluidity Gold - MFK

A vanilla for people who want elegance without effort. This is not a gourmand vanilla - no baked goods here. Instead, it’s clean, luminous, and softly sweet, like vanilla filtered through silk. It sparkles gently in the opening, then settles into a warm, musky, slightly ambery glow that clings to the skin beautifully.

It feels refined, airy, and quietly luxurious, like wearing a translucent veil that smells faintly of vanilla and confidence. The kind of scent that never overwhelms but always leaves an impression.

 

Billie Eilish – Eilish

A surprisingly cozy and comforting chocolate-vanilla. This is smooth, creamy, lactonic and warm, with a beautiful cacao note that makes it feel like a hug in scent form. It’s sweet without being juvenile and gourmand without being overwhelming.

Chocolate lovers will adore this. It gets compared to Nebras by Lattafa. Easy to wear, easy to love, and much better than anyone expected.

 

Vanilla Diorama

Vanilla, but done in a very sexy Parisian way. This is warm, spicy, boozy and elegant, yet less gourmand than the name might suggest. Cardamom and sandalwood give it a spicy, creamy depth, while rum and a hint of orange add richness and warmth.

Some say it’s reserved for special winter occasions. Personally? I ignore that advice entirely and bathe in it throughout December. It’s refined, seductive, and effortlessly chic - winter staple behaviour.

 

Herod - PDM

A deeply comforting tobacco vanilla that leans warm, ambery and rich. The tobacco here is smooth and inviting rather than harsh, wrapped in cozy vanilla and subtle sweetness. Perfect for cold weather, but probably a bit much for summer unless you enjoy causing olfactory chaos.

tip: If you’re curious about tobacco fragrances but unsure where to start, this is an excellent gateway scent. Sexy, smooth, and very easy to appreciate.

 

Orchidée Vanille – Van Cleef & Arpels

This smells like walking past a bakery and immediately abandoning all plans. Vanilla wafts through the air, soft and warm, drawing you inside before you even realise what happened.

It’s vanilla upon vanilla, softened by delicate orchid and musk. Gourmand, but never aggressive or cloying. Sophisticated, comforting, and beautifully balanced - like a quiet luxury dessert. I was gifted this scent by a friend who found it 'too vanillic', but it's been a staple in my scent warderobe ever since.

 

Dama Bianca - Xerjoff (casamorati)

One of my absolute favorites. A light, ethereal vanilla wrapped in soft florals and musk. The kumquat and lime add a gentle citrus sparkle, while the iris brings a powdery, elegant touch that I absolutely adore.

This scent feels fluffy, airy, and delicate, yet somehow lasts much longer than you’d expect. Projection is soft, but it lingers beautifully on skin. Some compare it to Junoon Noir, I can’t confirm this as I haven't tried the latter.

 

Ani - Nishane

The spicy vanilla of dreams. This is vanilla surrounded by all its best friends, each contributing something meaningful to the composition. Ginger sparkles, bergamot brightens, green notes freshen, vanilla warms, sandalwood creams, patchouli mystifies, and cardamom and benzoin tie it all together with a spicy bow.

It’s not gourmand - this is a mature, complex, spicy vanilla that feels polished and versatile. It’s the cool kid on the ice hockey team who owns the rink but is actually a very nice guy with a golden heart, too. He's effortlessly impressive without trying too hard, and always there when you need him. Sheer winter perfection. (Important note: Ani X is not the same scent - don’t be fooled.)

 

Grand Soir - MFK

Pure opulence. Warm, ambery, rich, incredibly long-lasting and impossibly elegant. I fully agree with AnneLauren Fragrance — the entire cast of Bridgerton absolutely smells like this.

If this fragrance had a soundtrack, it would be Shostakovich’s Second Waltz. It’s grand, enveloping, magical, it's majestic. Yes, it’s expensive - but you get every cent’s worth. A masterpiece. 10/10, no notes.

 

Blanche Bête - Les liq. imag. (hey, I did nót major in French, cut me some slack here)

The queen of creamy, milky, lactonic fragrances. Soft white florals swirl with vanilla and musk, creating a dreamy, cloud-like scent with a muskier dry-down. There’s a subtle coconut nuance that adds to the creaminess.

This is extremely divisive. People either fall head over heels, recoil in horror, or enjoy hating it. Absolutely not a safe blind buy - but unforgettable either way.

 

Vanilla 28 - Kayali

A staple for a reason. Warm, boozy, and reminiscent of caramelising brown sugar. Deep, comforting vanilla with ambery and woody undertones.

It shines as a layering fragrance, but also holds its own beautifully. Some call it boring - I call it reliable, balanced, and endlessly wearable. Sometimes you don’t need fireworks; you need consistency.

 

Fire At Will – Jovoy

A staple in my vanilla collection. A soft, ethereal vanilla with a subtle mimosa flower note. It smells like gentle, sweet vanilla ice cream, made special by faint yellow florals that keep it from feeling flat.

Projection is soft, but longevity is better than expected. This is an easy, cozy gourmand that doesn’t scream for attention. If this fragrance were a person, she’d be shy - but quietly unforgettable. Also excellent value for money.

 

Khamrah - Lattaffa

A spicy, warm, unapologetically festive fragrance filled with apples, dates, cinnamon, caramel and pastry-like sweetness. It smells like the best dessert table at Christmas.

It leans more spicy than vanilla, but it absolutely belongs here. Some people say it smells like a Yankee Candle - interpret that however you wish. Personally, I find it comforting, joyful, and perfectly seasonal.

 

Hypnotic Poison - Dior

An almond-heavy vanilla powerhouse. Loud, sexy, and completely unapologetic. This fragrance projects like crazy and refuses to be ignored. If you don’t step aside, she will push you over. Royal behaviour only.

 

Shalimar - Guerlain

The legend herself. A sophisticated, complex, balsamic vanilla with sparkling citrus, smoky undertones, and a powdery dry-down. Not a safe blind buy - but undeniably a masterpiece.

Vintage glamour, old Hollywood, dusty bookshelves, leather chairs, deep conversations, and a hint of skank. Complex, intoxicating, and endlessly fascinating. It’s not just a perfume - it’s history. (Still haven’t tried L’Essence… yet. Should I?)

 

Mon Guerlain - (yeah, guess who.. 🙄)

A beautifully blended lavender vanilla that feels calming, cozy and elegant. Comforting without being boring, and versatile enough for almost any occasion. It's lavender heaven, softened by vanilla, bergamot and tonka. Smells like peace, confidence, and freshly ironed cotton shirts.

 

Un Bois Vanille – Serge Lutens

Dark, smoky, smooth, autumnal vanilla perfection. Creamy sandalwood, syrupy honey, warm tonka and subtle spice create a rich, woody vanilla with depth and mystery.

Imagine standing in front of a fireplace in an old library, candles flickering, rain outside, books everywhere. This is dark academia vanilla at its finest. Wear with a jumper, a scarf, and a copy of The Secret History.

 

Vanilla Antique - Byredo

Still riding the dark academia wave - and not short on cash? This one’s for you. It smells like an old, refined library filled with aged paper, parchment, balsamic woods and antique furniture.

Spicy plum opens the scent before melting into a warm, seductive vanilla supported by amber and sandalwood. Some find it medicinal; others find it intoxicating. The price is hefty, but longevity is excellent. Whether it’s worth it… that’s between you and your wallet.

 

By the Fireplace - MM

A name that tells no lies. This is one of the most photorealistic smoky fragrances out there - burning wood balanced perfectly by sweet vanilla.

If you hate smoke, skip it. Otherwise, grab a blanket, your cosiest wool cardigan, and embrace the holiday spirit. “Chestnuts roasting on an open fire” was absolutely playing during its creation.

 

Jazz Club - MM

Same house, different fantasy. You’re no longer by the fire - you’re in the sexiest jazz club in town. Perfect outfit, smooth rum in hand, warm lighting, jazz humming softly in the background.

Spiced rum, tobacco and vanilla make this a seductive nighttime winter scent. Longevity varies, so sampling is wise - but the vibe? Impeccable.

 

Goddess - Burberry

A smooth, powdery vanilla with a beautiful lavender note. Soft, calming, and quietly feminine. Silently climed to the top of the best sold perfume lists after it's debute, and for a good reason. It's not too sweet, not cloying - just gentle, comforting and versatile. Mass-appealing done right. Easy reach, versatile, perfect whole year round. Vanilla top, vanilla heart, vanilla base - yet perfect if you want vanilla without the sugar overload. Excellent for colder weather.

 

Angels’ Share - Kilian

The OG. Cognac, cinnamon and vanilla in perfect harmony. Rich, opulent, and fully aware of its superiority.

Do not sample unless you are emotionally and financially prepared. Just like wedding dresses outside of your budget, some things are dangerous to try “just for fun.”

 

Oajan - PDM

Angels’ Share with the cinnamon cranked up to eleven. Apple pie on steroids. Warm, boozy, sweet, and intoxicating. Yes, you will smell like someone just pulled dessert out of the oven. Yes, people will want to stand closer to you. Perfect for date nights - unless your date is allergic to apples.

 

Spicebomb Extreme - Viktor & Rolf

A winter staple featuring vanilla, tobacco, cinnamon and whisky. Sexy, seductive, and surprisingly smoother than the original despite the intimidating name. Cold-weather approved and dangerously easy to like.

 

Babycat - YSL

A dark, spicy, leathery vanilla with serious attitude. Smoky, resinous, incense-heavy and unapologetically edgy.

This is the cool Parisian woman in a leather jacket who somehow manages to look elegant and intimidating at the same time. Not for the faint-hearted.

 

Black Opium Le Parfum - YSL

Vanilla with a bold, spicy twist. Coffee and vanilla collide to create a dark, edgy, addictive scent that knows exactly what it’s doing.

 

Commodity Gold

A smooth, creamy vanilla that’s sweet but controlled. Soft woods in the background give it a comforting, wearable edge. Easy, cozy, and crowd-pleasing.

 

Vanilla Skin – Phlur

Hands down the best value-for-money vanilla out there. Yes, it’s a body mist - but it punches way above its weight and gives many vanilla scents out there which cost double (triple, tenfold) as much a run for their money.

For the price, it has no business being this good. Gourmand lovers on a budget: do not walk. Run.

 

Vanilla Vibes - JHAG

The beachy summer vanilla. Salty, coconutty, sun-warmed and carefree. If you need a go-to summer holiday vanilla that smells like tan lines, ocean air and zero responsibilities - this is your girl.

 

Alien Goddess - Mugler

So.. You’ve spent the day at the beach with vanilla vibes, showered, and now you’re heading to a tropical beach bar. This is were Alien Goddess shines. Creamy white florals, coconut, vanilla, and pure summer energy. Is it August yet?

 

Vanilla Powder - Matière Première

A powdery, musky vanilla with heliotrope and a touch of coconut. Pretty, soft, and exactly what the name suggests. Lovely - but at that price point, my expectations were higher. My wallet remains unconvinced.

So, there you have it. 😊🙏

""I don't know how you can sleep in this house, man,"" Alex said, his voice hushed like he didn’t want it to carry too far. We were sitting in my room, it was a Saturday afternoon. 

""What am I supposed to do?"" I shot back, a little sharper than I intended.

He shook his head, grimacing. ""I’d rather be homeless, dude. Seriously. I’d take my chances with a cardboard box and alley cats before sleeping under this roof again.""

I had just told Alex everything. The dream, the shadow in the garage, the deadbolt clicking in the middle of the night, and the way my dad drifted through the dark like he wasn’t quite real.

""You’ve been in the garage though, right?"" he asked, squinting at me like he was searching for some kind of lie I hadn’t confessed yet.

""Of course I have. I’ve been in there a million times. It’s just a normal garage.""

Even as the words left my mouth, they felt sour and thin. That wasn’t the whole truth. Not even close. I knew it, maybe Alex did too. 

Yes, I had been in the garage—but only ever through the overhead doors or the rear entrance, the one that looks out into the backyard. Never, not once in my nearly fifteen years of life, had I stepped through the red door that connected the garage to the house. Not from the kitchen. Not from the hall. Not from anywhere inside. That door might as well have been bricked over in my mind.

And I had known this was strange for a long time. I had known.

But saying it out loud, or even really admitting it to myself felt like pulling a trigger on something that couldn’t be undone. Because if I accepted that, then I had to accept something far worse: that my father wasn’t who he said he was.

And I don’t know which truth is harder to live with.

Either there’s a witch in the garage. Or there’s a monster in the house.

""Did you ever try to do what Danny did?"" Alex asked, his voice low, almost like he didn’t want the question to echo in the room.

""What do you mean?"" I replied, even though I had a feeling I already knew.

""Well, Danny stood by the garage door, right? And the witch spoke to him. Have you ever tried that?""

I had. More than once, in fact. Over the years, I’d lingered around the garage, sometimes standing still for long stretches of time, sometimes pacing back and forth just outside the red door, hoping and dreading that I might hear something. But either nothing happened or my dad always seemed to appear, needing my help with something. A chore. A question. A distraction.

I was explaining all this to Alex when we both froze at the soft knock on my bedroom door.

My dad’s head poked around the frame a second later.

""Hey guys,"" he said with his usual relaxed smile. ""We’re heading to the dump to drop off some old stuff. Found a box of your things from when you were little. Mind going through it and pulling anything you want to keep?""

He placed the box in my hands without waiting for an answer, then turned and walked away.

""Sure,"" I said flatly to the empty hallway.

We sat cross-legged on the floor as I peeled open the flaps of the old cardboard box. A puff of dust lifted into the air, catching the light like ash. Inside were old plastic toys with missing arms, a faded baseball cap, and a small trophy that read “3rd Place - Karate.”

""When did you do karate?"" Alex asked with a smirk, clearly holding back laughter.

""Don’t mess with me, man. I’ll sweep your legs,"" I said, making a ridiculous chopping motion in the air.

We both laughed and kept digging. The box was a time capsule of forgotten odds and ends. Stickers, marbles, bits of colored string, a yo-yo that no longer lit up. At the very bottom were a stack of drawings, folded and crumpled, their paper soft with age. Most were harmless, dogs, fish, some scribbles that might’ve been superheroes or dinosaurs. We joked about my artistic skills, flipping through them one by one.

Then Alex went quiet.

He held a drawing in his hand, staring at it for too long. The amusement drained from his face.

""You have a sister?"" he asked, his tone suddenly cautious.

""No,"" I said, hesitating. ""Why?""

He turned the drawing toward me.

It was a simple picture, the kind any little kid would draw. A house made of a square and a triangle, smoke curling from a cartoon chimney, the sun in the corner, a patch of green grass. In front of the house stood four stick figures. One small, probably meant to be me. One tall, broad-shouldered figure, definitely my dad. One with a dress and long brown lines for hair, my mom. And then... another woman. Same size as my mom. Same long hair. Standing just a few steps apart, like she belonged there.

Alex pointed at them, slowly. ""Kid. Dad. Mom... Mom?""

My stomach turned. I could hear the soft creak of my father’s footsteps coming down the hallway.

Without a word, I grabbed the drawing and slid it under the bed.

Dad stepped into the room just as I finished. ""Find anything you want to keep?"" he asked, eyes flicking between us.

""No,"" I said quickly, loading everything back into the box.

He nodded, cheerful as ever. ""Alright then. We’ll be back in an hour or so.""

""Okay."" I didn’t look at him.

Something in the air shifted. His smile dipped for half a second, just a flicker but I saw it. He was reading the room.

""Be good,"" he said, and then he was gone.

We listened as the front door opened and shut, the car doors slammed, and the engine disappeared down the street.

""Was that a drawing of the witch?"" Alex finally said, his voice rising with disbelief.

""It was just a drawing,"" I said too quickly, searching for any kind of reasonable explanation but nothing came. My mind was blank.

""A drawing of a son, a dad, a mom, and... another mom,"" Alex said again, slower this time.

We stared at each other, the room suddenly too quiet. The air felt heavier.

Under the bed, the paper lay dormant.

I reached under and lifted the paper. 

I started to speak slowly “Kid, Dad, Mom”

“Witch” Alex cut me off. 

Alex doesn’t sleep over anymore. Not that night. Not since.

He says it’s because of school, or his parents, or just needing a break, but I know better. I think we both do. The house feels different now. There’s something heavy in the air, something unspoken, a secret hideousness. My mom and dad still move through our days like everything’s fine. We eat dinner together. We laugh. We talk about nothing. But it all feels rehearsed, like lines read from a script in a play no one wants to watch.

A performance, not a life.

And my dad, he knows something. I can feel it in the way he looks at me sometimes, like he’s checking to see if I know too. And I do. I don’t know what, not exactly, but I know enough to know that nothing is what it seems. And I think he knows that I know.

Last night, I had another dream.

No, not a dream. A memory wearing a dream’s skin.

I was crying. Alone. At the bottom of something. A pit maybe, a hole carved deep into the earth. I was sitting on a slick, rotting heap of garbage. Wet cardboard, plastic, food wrappers bloated with decay. The air stank of mildew and something far worse, like meat left out too long.

It was cold. My skin ached. My body throbbed with a dull, steady pain that pulsed like a heartbeat. The darkness was thick, almost physical. But then. Click. A light above snapped on.

A spotlight.

A single circle of harsh white light opened far above me. I looked up and saw bricks curving around me like the inside of a well, rising twenty feet or more. I was in a tunnel or a shaft, some place meant to hold things. Or trap them.

I heard footsteps above me. Muffled. Slow. Methodical. They echoed strangely, as though they were underwater. I realized I could no longer hear my own crying. My mouth was open, my face soaked in tears, but there was no sound. Like the world had turned down the volume.

Then the light dimmed slightly, something was standing over the opening.

A silhouette. A head. Someone was looking down at me.

I didn’t move. Couldn’t. My breath caught in my throat as the figure lifted a hand and gave a gentle wave. Familiar. Too familiar.

In the other hand, they held a brown paper bag. They let it drop.

It struck my shoulder before sliding to the floor. I opened it with shaking hands.

Two slices of pizza.

Cold, greasy, and smeared against the inside of the bag—but I devoured them without thinking. My hunger roared to the surface like a beast. I had been starving. Starving for longer than I could understand.

The figure stood above me, still and silent. Then they stepped away.

Their shadow receded from the light, and the footsteps returned, fading like a lullaby played backward.

Click.

The light went out.

Nothing but darkness. Absolute. I couldn’t see my hands. Couldn’t feel the floor beneath me. Just the cold. The wet. The black.

And somewhere in that black, I kept crying, soundless, voiceless, waiting for the next bag to fall.

I awoke the way I always do now. Soaked in sweat, heart pounding so violently I could feel it in my throat. 

I turned my head toward the alarm clock. That familiar red light burned through the darkness, too sharp to look at directly, bleeding into the walls and ceiling like a warning.

3:04 a.m.

I found myself wondering if my dad was awake.

What a strange, grim thought.

Who wants to be awake at this hour? What is there to do in the dead middle of the night but wait for something to go wrong?

Still, I got up. Wide awake. My stomach clawed at me with a hollow ache, like the hunger from my dream had followed me across the threshold of sleep and into this world.

I turned on the light. No need for stealth, I wasn’t sneaking around. I was just hungry. That was all.

I made my way to the kitchen, passing the dining table without thinking. The fridge greeted me with a dull hum. Cold air spilled over my bare feet as I opened it.

We had pizza yesterday.

Pizza is my favorite. It’s what I ask for every time my parents let me choose dinner. A little ritual of comfort. Predictable.

But the box was empty.

Completely, insultingly empty.

I sighed. Mom hates when we do that. Leave containers behind with nothing inside. She acts like it’s a betrayal of the home itself, some grave violation. I found it quite funny actually. Along with the empty pizza box in the fridge there was also a bag of Salt was left out on the counter. Mom would be so pissed.  

I figured Dad must’ve eaten the last of it. I shut the door and pivoted to Plan B. Ramen noodles. 

“What are you doing up?”

My father’s voice, casual, calm.

My body reacted before my brain did. I physically jumped, feet leaving the ground. A shock of pure fear surged through me like a live wire.

He was sitting at the dining table.

In the dark.

He’d been there the whole time. Watched me walk by. Watched me open the fridge. Watched me searching, unaware of the eyes fixed on my back.

“Jesus Christ, Dad,” I gasped, clutching at my chest.

He didn’t smile. Didn’t laugh. Just sat there, watching me. His face empty, unreadable.

Then, slowly, like remembering how to perform, a grin spread across his mouth.

“Sorry, son,” he said gently. “Didn’t mean to scare you.”

I nodded, swallowing down the last of my panic, trying to find the edges of composure.

“I was just... hungry,” I said. “Wanted some pizza.”

“That’s gone,” he replied.

There was something strange about how he said it. Not annoyed. Not apologetic. Just final.

“Did you eat it?” I asked.

“I just told you,” he said, smile unwavering. “It’s gone. Who else would’ve eaten it?”

I wanted to say nothing. I wanted to let it drop.

“The witch in the garage,” I said flatly.

He didn’t move.

Five, maybe ten seconds passed. Then he laughed. A weak, fake laugh like someone trying to mimic the sound without really feeling it.

“Yeah,” he said. “Maybe.”

He stood up, slowly. He looked at the table for a long moment, then lifted his gaze to meet mine. His eyes were glassy, unreadable.

“Sam,” he began, voice low. “There’s a lot of darkness in this world.”

The words hit me like a crack of thunder, sudden, loud, impossible to ignore.

It was the first time I had ever heard my father speak without his usual mask. There was no warmth in his tone. Just truth.

“There are things out there,” he continued, “that are hard to explain. Things that don’t make sense. Things I hope you never have to understand.”

He paused.

“But maybe one day you will have to.”

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t speak. I was rooted in place. Frozen.

“What are you trying to say?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He looked down, muttered something I didn’t catch. Then he spoke clearly again.

“Everything I do,” he said, “I do for you and your mother.”

I didn’t know how to respond.

“Okay,” I murmured. What else was there to say?

“I love you, Sam,” he said.

“I love you too, Dad,” I replied, throat tight.

He smirked, not smiled, smirked. A quick exhale coming from his nose. 

“Dad,” I said slowly, cautiously, “if I ask you something... do you promise to tell me the truth?”

He looked at me. Really looked. Then raised both hands and rubbed his face, slowly, like wiping something invisible from his skin.

“Yes, Sam,” he said, and this time his voice was grave. “You can ask me a question.”

He emphasized the word ‘A’ as if to make it clear I only got one.

Just one.

My body began to tremble. I didn’t know why. I was only a boy, standing in front of his father. A scene that should have been safe. Familiar.

But something was wrong.

“Is the witch real?” I asked, keeping my voice steady.

“Yes, Sam,” he said. “The witch is real.”

Then he turned and walked back toward his bedroom. No explanation. No fear.

Just silence.

There were so many questions I could have asked him.  
 Do we have a basement?  
 Was there ever someone else in our family?  
 Is the witch in a well?

But I panicked. My chest was tight, my thoughts were spiraling, and I asked the first thing that came to mind.

“He said it was real?” Alex repeated, barely above a whisper.

We sat together at lunch, shoulders hunched forward, our voices low. The world around us was loud, kids yelling, laughing, the clatter of trays, but it all felt distant. Sounded like we were underwater again.

“Yeah,” I muttered.

He looked at me, eyes wide. “Your dad said that? Just like that?”

I nodded, not offering more.

Alex stared down at his untouched sandwich. “Anything else happen?”

“Not really,” I said. “Just more nightmares.”

I didn’t want to talk about it anymore. Every time I brought it up, every time I said the word witch or garage or red door, I felt like something drained out of me. I wasn’t even afraid anymore, just tired. Worn out from the weight of secrets I didn’t understand.

Danny walked past us in the cafeteria, surrounded by his usual group. He caught my eye and gave a friendly nod. He looked normal. Happy. But I knew he wasn’t. How could he be? I've never seen the witch, never heard her, and she spoke to him. 

Later, Alex invited me to spend the weekend at his place. Play video games. Watch dumb movies. Fall asleep at 4am like we used to. I told him I wasn’t up for it. I just wanted to sleep.

That was a lie.

When I got home, I sat in my room, staring at the picture. The one from the box. The drawing with the square house, the triangle roof, and four figures standing out front.

“A kid. A dad. A mom. And... a mom.” I said aloud.

My voice sounded small in the quiet room.

I could hear my real mom in the kitchen, pans clinking, the faint hiss of something frying in oil. She was humming softly to herself.

I walked out and stood in the kitchen doorway. She looked over, smiling. “Hey sweetheart. Everything okay?”

I hesitated, then handed her the picture. “I found this in that old box Dad gave me.”

She took it, holding it gently between her fingers like it might crumble. “Aw, Sam... This is adorable. I forgot how much you used to draw. You were so creative.”

I stared at her. “Mom. Why are there two women in the drawing?”

She blinked. “Two?”

I pointed. “There. That one’s you. That one’s Dad. That’s me. who’s *she*?”

Her face didn’t change. No flash of fear, no confusion. Just a calm, almost practiced smile.

“Oh, I don’t know, honey. You had such a wild imagination as a kid. Maybe you wanted a sister, or maybe she was a friend. You used to make up stories all the time, remember?”

I didn’t respond.

“She looks exactly like you,” I said. My voice was flat.

Mom chuckled softly. “Well, they’re stick figures, Sam. How different could she look?”

She had a point. But it didn’t feel right.

“Is everything okay?” she asked again, tilting her head. Her voice was so gentle, so sincere. And for a moment, I felt safe. For the first time in weeks.

But maybe that was the plan.

My mind started racing. I saw flashes of memory. A dark hallway. The sound of a latch. A smell like wet brick and iron. Things I had ignored for years. Weird noises. Locked doors. The red door.

There was a truth hiding behind the drywall of this house. It had been growing in the walls like mold since I was a child.

“Have you ever gone through the red door, Mom?” I asked.

She looked up from the picture and laughed, confused. “The red door? In the garage?”

“Yes.”

“Of course, Sam. We were in there last week, remember? We moved those boxes together.” She gave me a puzzled look and shook her head.

“That’s not what I asked.”

She paused. Her smile faltered, just a little.

“I asked,” I said again, “if you’ve ever *gone* through the red door.”

“Sam, the red door leads to the garage,” she said, her voice suddenly firm.

“Does it?” I took a step forward. My voice was shaking now. “So we don’t have a basement? That door just goes to the garage and nowhere *else*?”

“Of course not,” she said quickly. Too quickly.

“Then why are there *locks* on both sides of it?” I snapped. “Why does it lock from the inside and the outside, Mom?”

She stared at me. Her eyes began to shimmer. A tear rolled down her cheek.

“Sam...” she whispered. “Please, stop. You’re scaring me.”

“No,” I said. “*Dad* is the one who’s scaring me. I know he’s hiding something. I know you are too.”

She stepped forward and reached out. “Sweetheart, you’re not well. Maybe it’s just the nightmares, or stress, or”

“I’m not crazy,” I hissed. “You’re just good at pretending.”

“Sam, please,” she said, her voice trembling. “You need help. You’re saying things that aren’t real.”

I backed away from her, from the kitchen, from her soft eyes that looked more like lies than comfort now.

She stood there holding the drawing in her hand. The one with the fourth figure. The one she didn’t name.

The woman in the picture was still smiling.  
 And I didn’t know who she was.  
 But she looked a lot like my mother.

After the fight, I went back to my room and shut the door behind me. The air felt heavier now. Still. Like the house was holding its breath. I sat on the edge of my bed, elbows on my knees, just waiting for the sound of the front door opening, for his footsteps, for something.

Dad always got home around 5:30. Like clockwork.

But 5:30 came and went.

Then 6:00.

Then 6:45.

The sun had vanished by then, and the blue twilight outside was starting to curdle into full night. I checked the time again. 7:00. Nothing.

At 7:10 p.m., the phone rang.

It was a sharp, old-fashioned sound. Like something out of a dream, or a nightmare.

I heard my mom pick it up in the hallway. A few seconds of silence. Then a small, fractured whimper slipped out of her mouth. My skin stood up. 

“Wait, what? No, no, no, what happened?” she stammered.

That was enough. My anger toward her evaporated. She might’ve been hiding something, but she was still my mother, and right now, she sounded like a frightened child. I stepped out into the hallway just as she was pulling on her coat with frantic, jerky movements.

“Mom?” I asked, my voice thin. “What’s going on?”

She turned to me, eyes red, phone still clutched in her hand.

“There’s been an accident,” she said. Her voice cracked on the last word.

There were tears already, but I didn’t know if they were from me, or the phone call, or both. The details came during the drive. Barely strung-together thoughts between panicked breaths.

“Your father was in a car crash,” she said. “They said a truck. Some truck hit him. A bad one. He’s at the hospital.”

I said nothing. Just watched the blur of passing headlights and shadows out the window. Everything felt slowed down. Muffled. Like I’d been dropped underwater. An unfortunately familiar feeling for me recently. 

When we got to the hospital, I found out what really happened. He’d been sideswiped by a truck, some distracted driver on his phone, apparently. The driver walked away with a broken wrist. But Dad… Dad had taken the full impact. They put him into a medically induced coma “for his own safety,” the doctors said. Their voices were calm. Practiced. Rehearsed for hundreds of nights like this one.

I listened in pieces. It was all just noise—soft voices, sliding doors, papers shuffling. I didn’t cry. I didn’t feel much of anything. If anything, I felt absent. Like I’d slipped a few feet outside of my own body. Watching a movie I didn’t want to see.

We waited. For hours.

Sympathetic looks came from every direction. Nurses smiled with sad eyes. Doctors patted shoulders and used the word Champ. No one said it out loud, but everyone in that waiting room knew what kind of night this was.

My mom barely spoke. She held a balled-up tissue in one hand, trembling, as if it were the only thing tethering her to this reality. I wanted to comfort her. But I didn’t move. I just stared ahead. Thinking about the last conversation I’d had with Dad. The *only* honest one we might have ever had. I had asked him a question. One question. And I got an answer I didn’t understand. Now I felt like I may never speak with him again. 

They let us see him at 11:04 p.m.

I remember the exact time, because I looked at the red digital clock in the hallway and felt a jolt, just like the alarm clock in my room. Red numbers. Always red. 

The room was filled with a quiet symphony of mechanical life support. A soft, pulsing beep. The sound of suction. An oxygen machine that sighed and inhaled, like something alive. Like something waiting.

He was lying there. My dad.

His face was covered in a cascade of bruises and shallow cuts. There were bandages, dried blood at the edges, IVs in both arms. But it was still him. Still *Dad*. Not broken. Just… still.

“Hey,” my mom whispered, stepping toward him like he might wake at the sound.

I stood behind her. Frozen.

The machines beeped, slow and steady, like a metronome counting the seconds of life passing by. 

 felt something shift in my chest. Not sadness exactly. Something colder.

His clothes were folded neatly in a clear plastic bin labeled with a thin white tag. Personal Effects it read. Something about that phrase made my stomach turn. Like he was already gone.

I wasn’t supposed to look. But I did.

Among the blood-speckled shirt and crumpled jeans, I saw something gleam faintly in the harsh hospital lighting, something metallic, half-buried in the folds. My heart jumped.

Keys.

I glanced at Mom. She was standing at the edge of Dad’s bed, wiping her eyes, trying to be brave. Trying to look strong for both of us. But I wasn’t watching her out of sympathy. I was watching her to make sure she didn’t see me.

I reached down casually, slid my hand into the container, and felt around until my finger looped through the keyring. I closed my hand tightly, muffling the soft jingle of metal, and slipped the whole thing into my coat pocket in one smooth motion. Cold steel. Heavy with purpose.

“Hey, Mom,” I said, forcing a tremble into my voice like I was holding back tears.

“Yes, hun?” she replied quickly, looking over her shoulder with a practiced smile. It didn’t touch her eyes.

“Could I, could I get some water or something?” I asked, fumbling for more words, trying to sell it. “Maybe step outside for a minute. Just… some air.”

She nodded without hesitation. “Of course. That’s probably a good idea,” she said, brushing at her cheeks with a tissue. “Go ahead. I’ll be right here.”

I turned and walked out without another word. The second I was in the hallway, I picked up speed, not running, but not walking slow enough to get stopped. My thoughts were loud. Deafening. The keys felt like they were burning a hole in my pocket.

I found the first staff member I could, an older woman behind a counter, peering at a screen and sipping from a hospital-branded coffee cup.

“Hi,” I said, trying to sound casual. “Is Mrs. Pierce working tonight?”

She looked at me, surprised, then nodded and picked up a phone. A few short calls. A few moments of waiting.

Then, around the corner, she appeared.

Alex’s mom.

“Oh, Sam,” she said, walking up with open arms, “I heard what happened. I’m so, so sorry, sweetheart.”

Her hug was warm, but I didn’t feel it. 

She pulled back, keeping her hands gently on my shoulders.

“Your dad’s strong. And this hospital’s one of the best. The doctors here…” she gave me a little smile, trying to lift the moment, “they’re basically wizards, you know?”

“Or witches,” I said, without thinking. The words slid out, dry and bitter.

“Could you give me a ride home?” I asked. 

After telling Mom that Mrs. Pierce would be driving me home, we left. It was a long, silent ride. I didn’t try to talk much, and I couldn’t have told you anything she said if you asked me. I was somewhere else, already halfway down the hallway, staring at the red door in my mind.

I got home around midnight. The house looked the same, but it felt completely different. My own house had never scared me like this. It was too quiet, too dark. But not empty.

Something was still inside. I knew it.

I unlocked the front door. My hand trembled. As I stepped inside, I had this vivid flash, just for a moment of something standing in the garage window, waving.

I didn’t lock the door behind me.

I walked slowly through the quiet house. Past the kitchen. Past the living room. Down the long hallway.

Until I stood before the red door.

That door had been a shadow cast across my entire childhood. A question no one ever answered. A giant red threat dressed up like a little white lie. 

My hand reached up, almost on its own. I slid the deadbolt open. I inserted my father’s key into the lock and turned. It clicked.

I paused. I prayed, silently, foolishly, that I’d open the door and see nothing but a garage. My father’s dusty old pickup. Tools. Paint cans. Normal things.

I opened the door.

Behind it was a narrow space. A short passage. On the other side was another identical red door.

To the right: a thin, crumbling staircase made of old brick, leading down into pitch-black darkness. A single metal chain dangled from the ceiling like a forgotten noose.

I pulled it. Click.

The lights buzzed and flickered to life, revealing the start of something ancient. Something hidden.

Each step I took down the stairs made the air feel heavier, thicker, older. Like I was walking into something that had been sealed away for centuries. At the bottom of the steps was a small stone corridor. Around the corner, I entered a large underground room.

It was damp and cold, and it reeked like rot and mildew and death. The walls were stone, stained dark. The floor was littered with trash: torn food wrappers, pizza boxes, old cans, and bags of salt.

And in the center of the room… was a well.

A stone well, about three feet high, open and roofless, like something torn out of a fairytale, but there was nothing magical about it. It was surrounded by a perfect circle of white salt.

Until I stepped too close and accidentally kicked some of the salt away, breaking the ring.

That’s when I heard it.

“Hello…” came a voice from inside the well.

I stumbled back, gasping.

“Hello?” I answered, my voice shaking.

“Who's there?” the voice asked, hoarse and ragged.

“S-Sam,” I said, barely able to get the word out.

“Will you help me, Sam?”

The voice sounded scared. Tired. Human. Not some cackling hag like I had imagined all my life. It was a woman. A person.

“So you're real,” I said, eyes welling up with terrified tears. “There really is a witch...”

The voice whimpered. “I'm not a witch, Sam.” She was crying now, deep, anguished sobs echoing up from the stone. “I'm a prisoner.”

I couldn’t speak. My hands were shaking violently.

“Your father… he's kept me down here for years. Please. Help me.”

“Who are you?” I finally managed to ask.

“My name is Sarah,” the voice said. “I’m Danny’s mother.”

The room spun. My knees buckled. My breath caught in my throat.

Danny’s mother. The one who’d *disappeared*. The one they said *ran away*. The one Danny never talked about.

“Wait here,” I said, voice cracking. “I’m going to call the police. I’m going to call Danny.”

“No, wait,” she pleaded. “Sometimes… sometimes your father lowers a rope for food or clothes, when he’s feeling merciful. It’s already tied. Please, just drop it down. I've been down here far too long.”

I grabbed the coil of rope from the corner. It was already anchored to the wall, knotted expertly like it had been used many times before.

I tossed it into the well.

“I’ll be right back,” I promised, already running, sprinting up the stairs, through the red door, slamming it shut behind me out of instinct. My hands flew across drawers and cupboards until I found the small phone book my mom still kept.

*Danny - Home.*

I dialed the number. My heart was in my throat. The phone rang.

“Hello?” Danny answered.

“Danny, it’s Sam,” I gasped, tears flooding my face.

“Oh hey, man, what’s up?”

“I found her,” I cried. “Your mom. She didn’t leave. She didn’t run away. She’s here, Danny. She’s been under my house this whole time.”

There was silence on the other end.

Then, finally, Danny laughed, but not a happy laugh. A confused one.

“Sam… my mom’s in rehab.”

“No. No, she’s not. I just talked to her. She said that my dad locked her away. Danny, you said she disappeared”

“She did man. Years ago. She was gone for a while, but she came back. She’s getting better now. I saw her last weekend. We go visit every other Sunday.”

My breath stopped.

The phone slipped from my hand and hit the kitchen floor with a dull crack.

Downstairs… in the dark… a rope was being pulled taut.

And someone…  something was climbing up.

My Symptoms:
Constant Hunger: I eat 3–4 heavy meals a day but feel hungry almost immediately after finishing.
Rapid Digestion: I often have to go to the bathroom (bowel movements) 2–3 times a day, frequently right after eating.
Loud Stomach Sounds: My gut makes very loud gurgling/splashing sounds (borborygmi) about 1–2 hours after eating and especially at night.
Bloating & Pressure: I currently have a bloating and high-pressure gas/farts.
Chronic Fatigue: I feel tired all day even after 8 hours of sleep.
Food Sensitivities: I have an ""on and off"" sensitivity to milk tea and coffee. Sometimes I digest it fine, other times it causes an immediate stomach ""misbalance."" However, I can digest curd/dahi perfectly.
Dietary Habits:
I eat spicy food and fast food about 3–4 times a week.

Given that I’ve never dewormed, are these symptoms classic for a parasitic infection (like Giardia or Hookworm)?

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

We got something much worse.,"[All Parts](https://www.reddit.com/r/MattBenjamin/comments/1p1itsv/clearview_master_post/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

The decision to add fluoride to the town’s drinking water was contentious in Clearview.

The proponents of the change touted improvements in oral health—which, to be fair, our town sorely needed. I still remember Dr. Sheldon standing up at the town hall meeting, holding up photographs from his practice. As a dentist, he was firmly pro-fluoride.

The anti-fluoride camp was just as vocal—if perhaps a bit more eccentric. Their objections ranged from increased cancer risk all the way to CIA mind-control nano-robots. I’m a little embarrassed to say that my own mom was in this camp.

After hours of arguing, the issue finally came to a vote. And though only by a hair, the pro-fluoride side won.

It was still a while before the infrastructure was in place to actually add fluoride to the water, but after the vote, people largely stopped talking about it.

Until one summer afternoon.

Mayor Blythe held a special press conference at the Clearview Municipal Water Treatment Plant. He stood at a podium overlooking a massive vat of water and gave a long speech about progress and innovation, thanking one person after another for helping make it all happen. Then he lifted a small vial over his head, unscrewed it, and poured it into the vat.

It was probably just ceremonial—but that day marked the beginning of our town’s love-hate relationship with its drinking water.

They promised the water would look the same, taste the same, smell the same—only providing imperceptible benefits to our oral hygiene. And at first, that was true.

For a week or two, the water tasted like water.

But soon, those with more sensitive palates noticed a change.

The water tasted sweet.

It was subtle at first, but before long everyone in town was talking about it. For us kids, it was mostly pleasant. Sugary drinks were usually a treat. Everyone thought it was odd—but people chalked it up to a minor issue that would be resolved quickly.

As the days passed and the water grew sweeter, people stopped talking about it altogether.

They were afraid that if they mentioned it, the sweetness might go away.

I remember the first time I stood in front of the refrigerator, staring at a bottle of soda—then turning instead to the kitchen faucet and pouring myself a glass of tap water.

The grocery store stopped selling bottled drinks. Even our fast-food stores served tap water with burgers and fries.

Mom and Dad no longer drank wine in the evenings, nor did they enjoy their morning coffee.

Along with the sweetness came another strange quality: if you boiled the water, it became incredibly bitter, leaving behind a thick tan residue on the pot or coffee maker.

But no one really seemed to mind.

No one wanted coffee. No one wanted soda. No one wanted beer or wine.

They just wanted the water from the tap.

I was no different.

For weeks, I drank nothing but the town’s water. I knew it was getting bad when school started and everyone—including the teachers—brought oversized water bottles to class, sipping constantly, unwilling to go even forty-five minutes without it.

Maybe things would have gone on that way forever.

But if whatever they added to the water was a problem, it turned out to be an even bigger one when they took it out.

I was sitting in third-period history, doodling away between sips from my water bottle when Sarah, one of my classmates, came back into the room from a bathroom break.

She stood in the doorway until even the teacher paused and looked at her.

“Are you okay, Sarah?”

Her eyes darted nervously around the room. She was panting, but trying to appear composed.

“The water… it’s back to normal.”

A murmur rose up in the class. Even the teacher’s eyes darted to his water bottle sitting on his desk.

“Are you sure?” he asked.

“I tried every water fountain and sink in the school. It’s gone.”

“Okay, okay. Not to worry. Let’s get back to class.”

Sarah sat down at the desk next to me, and the teacher started up again. But the air in the room was heavy. Everyone held onto their water bottles, taking smaller sips than normal.

And as I looked around the room, I noticed that Sarah wasn’t the only one whose bottle was now empty.

But Sarah was getting antsy.

She fidgeted and squirmed. Eventually, she turned to me; her face white.

“Eliot, can I have a little of your water?” she whispered.

I eyed my bottle. Less than a quarter left. There was no way I was giving any away.

I shook my head and pretended to be paying attention to the lecture.

But the next time I opened my bottle to take a sip, I was knocked out of my desk as Sarah tackled me from the side.

She grabbed for my bottle, but only managed to knock it across the room, spilling most of it across the floor.

Sarah, along with two other students, rushed for the bottle screaming, punching, pulling hair.

One kid sprawled across the floor lapping up the water that spilled when my bottle went flying.

Our teacher attempted to rein the class in, but soon students were rushing the front of the room grabbing at his water. He stood on the desk, kicking students in the face as they clamored for his bottle.

I was growing anxious. I could feel the tightening of my stomach. The insatiable craving for more tap water. But with each passing second, my chances of getting it in that classroom dwindled.

Then, a genius idea struck. The fountain!

Not a water fountain like you would drink from. No, the big concrete fountain that sat out front of Clearview High.

I dashed out the door and into the hallway, where more chaos erupted. Students were clamoring and fighting. One kid stood atop a security desk swinging a bat at anyone who approached. You’d think seeing someone get knocked out with a metal bat would deter others from trying the same thing. But the thirst was worse.

I ran past it all, out the front doors and into the courtyard. Only to find I was not the only person with the same idea. At least a dozen others were bent over the fountain lapping the water into their mouths. I took a spot between two other students, and for a moment, we all drank in peace. But soon others came. Some tried pushing their way through; others climbed over us to completely submerge themselves in the fountain.

Soon it was just as bad as inside.

I felt a hand grab the back of my shirt and rip me from the fountain, throwing me to the concrete. As I struggled to find another spot, I heard it. The sound of an engine revving. It got louder, tires screeched, and then a crash. The car plowed through a pile of people, through the concrete barrier of the fountain, and the water spilled out onto the ground, mingled with the blood of the dead and wounded.

A man emerged from the car, which was still running, and took his place among the throng fighting for just a drop of that sweet tap water.

I was right there among them. Stepping over bodies, I hurled myself onto the thin veins of water spreading out from the crumbling fountain.

I found a small puddle and ravenously lapped at the ground, likely drinking up more blood and dirt than anything else. But I needed it.

Even my small oasis was not safe.

I felt a flash of pain on the side of my head as I tumbled over. I could hardly see through the darkness that took over my vision in the wake of the blow. But I hurled myself back toward the water.

The man who had kicked me pinned me to the ground. His eyes were bloodshot; his face contorted in rage. And when he raised his fist to strike, I saw something glimmering in his hand. A knife.

He stabbed. I stopped his blow with my outstretched hands, receiving a deep gash on my forearm.

Just then, a siren sounded as black *RYNECORP* vans sped into the courtyard. My attacker looked away just long enough for me to slip out of his grasp.

Though wounded, I searched for another source of water as the vans parked all around, and men in gas masks and riot gear poured from the opening doors.

They raised their guns and fired into the crowd. Blue gas seeped out of cans tumbling across the concrete.

That was the last thing I remember before waking up at Clearview Regional Hospital. My head was wrapped, my arm was stitched, and my parents sat in chairs beside my bed.

“What happened?” I asked.

“Believe it or not, Eliot,” my dad said. “What they put in our water wasn’t fluoride. The mayor thinks it may have been sabotage—possibly HaleTech Industries.”

But my mom was having none of it.

What if the most vilified decision in modern British history was actually the correct one?

A sceptical historian is delivered a box that contains a cache of hidden documents suggesting that Sir Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement of Hitler was not cowardice but conspiracy. But what manner of conspiracy? One that subverts Chamberlain and his defeatist policies, or one that would propel Britain to eventual victory?

Dr. Élise Vance doesn't know which to believe, or how to believe what has been bequeathed. 

And then there’s the usual drama about legal action to get the case back, academic backstabbing, and scenic rides through the British countryside.

**What this is:**

* Contemporary , literary historical fiction. Or at least that’s what I’m gunning for. 85-90k plan
* Dual timeline: present-day academic thriller (32%, but the entire 1st act) and 1930s Whitehall intrigue (the remaining 68%)
* Comp titles: Robert Harris (*Munich*), Hilary Mantel, *Remains of the Day*

**What I Have:**

* A detailed three act, 25 or 26 chapter, plot outline with few (I think) plot holes
   * This has taken me literally years to develop, as I delve into various historical diaries of Chamberlain and Cadogan
* Act I (first five chapters, approximately 15,000 words) more or less complete.
* A more than average (in terms of finish), 1200 word first chapter ← this is what I’;d like to share.

**What I'm looking for:**

* Readers familiar with literary historical fiction
* WW2 history buffs, European theatre
* Honest feedback on pacing, character, and whether the hook holds
* No line edits at this stage—big picture reactions only (I haven’t indented my dialogue, for example… not yet.
* Ideally: Did you want to keep reading? Where did you lose interest? WOuld you pay me to keep writing to the end, lol.

1pr0uuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/digestiveissues/comments/1pr0uuf/pork_intolerance_causing_gi_problems/,pork intolerance causing gi problems,"Hi I'm a hispanic 21f, 5ft2 140ish pounds living in the US. This is really long so bear with me please.

About 3 years ago, I ate Pernil (slow-roasted pork leg) on New Years and I was sick for about 3-4 days after. I kind of assumed it had something to do with the way it was prepared or the fact that it was sitting on the counter for a couple of hours before being reheated and served. That bout of sickness started the next day around 8ish hours after eating and it began with extreme bloating, nausea and intense sulfur burps to the point where no one could stand to be around me. I finally threw up about 2 days after eating the pork and it was black vomit with the worst smell you could ever imagine, worse than a normal vomit smell. It was as if the food I had eaten had been sitting and rotting in my stomach. The burps finally stopped after 4ish days and I just continued my life as normal thinking it was just a one off.

Later that year (6 months later) I was in Colombia and I ate Chicharron (deep fried pork skin/fat) from a hotel breakfast buffet and again I was sick for about 3 days, with similar symptoms as the first time. I tried to treat both times with antacids, famotidine, omeprazole, probiotics and any stomach pill I had on hand. Nothing works until whatever is in my system makes its way out completely.

I think those were the only 2 incidents I had in 2023, with maybe having had other small reactions that year but it wasn't as extreme or debilitating as the other 2 were, they might have been either only diarrhea/vomiting or only bloating for example. Both of those times were bad enough to make me be more cautious with how long my food had been sitting, and being extra cautious with pork but not avoiding it completely.

In 2024 I visited Colombia again, and this time I avoided eating pork completely and I still got sick. My family hired a local lady to cook for us for the day and I was with my aunt and her kids who asked the lady to make bacon for breakfast. I got to breakfast after everything was already cooked so I didn't see anything being prepared. My breakfast was a fried sweet arepa that doesn't have any sort of meat in it and I didn't touch the bacon at all. A couple of hours later right before lunch, I started to feel nauseous so I skipped lunch and ate watermelon instead. Then I felt even worse and at this point I thought that I must have accidentally ingested some pork since I started burping sulfur. I ended up trying to force myself to vomit digitally which didn't work. My grandma gave me sodium bicarb dissolved in water to try to help the nausea but she might have accidentally put too much because I drank it and I immediately threw everything up. That definitely helped because I wasn't sick for as long with the vomiting and diarrhea lasting only a day ish and the sulfur burps for a while longer. Later on, I thought about everything I had eaten 12-24 hours before I got sick and figured it was probably cross contamination from the bacon grease and whatever oil was used to fry my arepa. I didn't know at the time but it was probably also worsened by the watermelon.

At that point, I figured I probably just should avoid eating pork as much as possible. Again, I still ate it sometimes because I do really like pork (the same way lactose intolerant people will sometimes eat ice cream). So I decided to stick to deli meats (ham, pepperoni, prosciutto) only since I figured they weren't really cooked but cured. The only cooked pork I had that year I think was probably around the holidays since it's hard to avoid pork during the holiday season. Nothing that I can remember gave me the same reaction that I had before.

I know that this isn't normal food poisoning because whoever I'm with will also eat the same food as me and I'm the only one who ever gets sick. I also got sick that same year in Scotland from eating fish and chips. My dad and I shared that plate and we both got sick with the worst food poisoning we had probably ever had (ex. projectile vomiting so severe I could feel my entire abdomen clenching up from the force). This sickness was horrible but it still wasn't as bad as what I felt like those 3 other times after eating pork.

I only got sick one other time in December, not from pork and without the same symptoms, that I'm bringing up because there's a condition that has a sensitivity to all red meats (Alpha-gal syndrome). I went to a friends grad party at night and I had eaten ground meat for dinner the night before (over 24 hours before) and that night during the party I felt nauseous, so I made myself throw up and I threw up the ground beef I had eaten like 30 hours earlier, whole and undigested. I freaked out and thought I had gastroparesis but I don't think I've had anything like that since so it probably isn't that. Since then, I have gotten really bloated and gassy, sometimes even diarrhea from ground meats, both beef and turkey, and steak sometimes gives me the same effect but not every time. 

From then I don't think I had any other reactions, but I might be forgetting stuff. I was still cautious with what I ate but after maybe 8ish months with no reactions I got lulled into a false sense of security and I started eating pork again. Not as much as I used to but at home once in a blue moon or if it was something I really loved or a bite or 2 from a plate that had bacon in it. It seems really dumb to me in hindsight but my thinking at the time was that I didn't want to alter my whole diet forever because I had 3 really bad reactions to pork and it didn't happen every single time I ate pork. I slowly started introducing some pork back into my diet over the beginning of this year, focusing mainly on things that weren't extremely fatty/greasy and bit by bit.

In August 2025, I went to the Dominican Republic and stayed at an all inclusive. One of the nights we went to the Brazilian restaurant, where they bring you the meat on skewers and slice it onto your plate. I avoided the skewers of pork completely and stuck to only eating meat and chicken, but I wasn't really thinking about the sausage that was most definitely pork. I ate maybe a quarter of it or so, since I didn't really like it. I went to sleep that night and felt a little gassy and bloated. I passed gas a couple of times and it smelt so bad that it woke my sister up. At some point in the night, I woke up and felt like I needed to fart again but I decided to be a good sister and go to the bathroom. I proceeded to have 3 hours straight of simultaneous watery diarrhea and vomiting. I had to call my mom to come in from the room next door and hold me up because I was actively fainting but couldn't get off the toilet or let go of the trash can. I was again burping up sulfur. She basically held me up until everything was out of my system. This was possibly the most extreme I got sick to the point I thought I might have to go to the hospital.

We woke up kinda early the next day to go to this waterfall in the middle of the jungle that you had to hike to. That morning since it was early and I didn't have that much of an appetite, I probably had mainly fruit (mango, granadilla, and watermelon) that morning. It's also important to note that I woke up feeling better, with no sulfur burps so I assumed that I had gotten all the pork I ate out of my system.

I'm not sure if this is important to the pork thing but this might be a pre-existing medical condition/symptom but this can be skipped. The week before we left, I had gone to study at a local coffee shop and I walked there, like a mile away. I got to the shop and immediately started feeling faint and I passed out completely for maybe a minute or so. I was wearing my apple watch so I could see that my heart rate increased to the 180s and dropped to the 60s. I'm prone to fainting and vasovagal syncopes but I've never passed out completely before that.

That day at the waterfall everything was fine until about 1 pm when we started to hike back up. I'm also deathly afraid of heights so by the time we made it back up again, I'm not sure if it was a combo of fear, low stamina, and whatever heart problem had happened to me the week before, but I started to faint again. This time I didn't faint completely but I had to sit for a while. We went back to the hotel and grabbed lunch and as I'm walking around the buffet line I feel faint again. I check my watch and my heart rate won't go down from 160-150 even after I sat down for about 20 minutes. I try to drink salted water for electrolytes and more watermelon thinking I'm probably dehydrated. I start to feel nauseous and burp sulfur again, so I go to the bathroom and projectile vomit water and watermelon. I almost faint again and dry heave until I can't anymore.

I take it easy later that day and stick to plain rice and chicken. I start to feel better after sleeping the whole day and not eating anything. I also hadn't burped at all a couple of hours after throwing up. I then decided to eat a slice of pepperoni pizza for dinner, because I'm an idiot and because pepperoni had never affected me before, with a large side of watermelon.

Once again I got sick that night with the exact same symptoms, just less extreme. I later looked it up and watermelon increases sulfur content in the stomach so maybe my body was weak from the night before and a small amount of pepperoni that wouldn't normally affect me did and it was made worse by all the watermelon I had been eating all day.

From that point I've been too scared to eat any pork at all including deli meats, as well as watermelon in case I ate something contaminated and that makes it worse. I've been avoiding everything that has ever even touched pork briefly since I was lowkey traumatized from that. 

Now why I'm asking about this now. I just came back from a trip to Colombia a couple of days ago where I got sick again but this time I've been avoiding pork for months without any incidents of contamination either. I went to the mall and had a burger there. My sister and my dad both got bacon burgers from the same place and neither of them got sick. This is the part that's different from every other time I've gotten sick; I took maybe 2 bites of my burger and started to feel nauseous immediately. Normally, if I got contaminated it takes between 2-12 hours to start to feel the effects, but I felt bad immediately, as if it was food poisoning. I then started thinking that although my burger didn't have bacon on it, it was probably cooked where bacon had been or even with it. My stomach started to hurt worse so, not thinking I was sick already, I went to the bathroom and had diarrhea. Most of my family had already been having diarrhea just because our bodies aren't used to the water there so I assumed it was that, plus a mixture of anxiety because of the burger. I'm still sitting there when I feel the urge to vomit. I text my family and proceed to projectile vomit everything I had eaten that day. Again assuming it's food poisoning, it's not until we're trying to leave and I have to stop to dry heave again that I burp and it smells like eggs. We had to visit family all day after so I threw up again after getting to their house, took an anti-nausea pill and fell asleep in someone's room. I'm still bloated the rest of the day but after that last bout of vomiting I don't think I burped sulfur the rest of the day. I think the fact that I hadn't really digested any of the food before I threw it up, made this time only last about a day.

Nobody else in my family has any sort of pork allergy or intolerance. I've seen that there are 2 options for what I could have but neither really fits, Pork-cat syndrome and Alpha-gal syndrome. I recently developed/found out I have a cat allergy about 2ish years ago, but from what I understand the reaction from pork would be more similar to a normal allergic reaction with hives and anaphylaxis etc. I also don't think I was bitten by a tick over 3 years ago (i feel like i would know right?), and even though I get some indigestion with other red meat it's never as bad.

Thanks and I appreciate any help or advice from anyone who might know anything or has gone through something similar, especially on how to decrease sulfur burps.

  
TLDR: 3 years of gi reactions and sulfur burps after eating pork, lately increasing in intensity, severity and now consistently every time I eat something that touched pork.

1pr0so9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MattBenjamin/comments/1pr0so9/fluoride/,Fluoride.,"The decision to add fluoride to the town’s drinking water was contentious in Clearview.

The proponents of the change touted improvements in oral health—which, to be fair, our town sorely needed. I still remember Dr. Sheldon standing up at the town hall meeting, holding up photographs from his practice. As a dentist, he was firmly pro-fluoride.

The anti-fluoride camp was just as vocal—if perhaps a bit more eccentric. Their objections ranged from increased cancer risk all the way to CIA mind-control nano-robots. I’m a little embarrassed to say that my own mom was in this camp.

After hours of arguing, the issue finally came to a vote. And though only by a hair, the pro-fluoride side won.

It was still a while before the infrastructure was in place to actually add fluoride to the water, but after the vote, people largely stopped talking about it.

Until one summer afternoon.

Mayor Blythe held a special press conference at the Clearview Municipal Water Treatment Plant. He stood at a podium overlooking a massive vat of water and gave a long speech about progress and innovation, thanking one person after another for helping make it all happen. Then he lifted a small vial over his head, unscrewed it, and poured it into the vat.

It was probably just ceremonial—but that day marked the beginning of our town’s love-hate relationship with its drinking water.

They promised the water would look the same, taste the same, smell the same—only providing imperceptible benefits to our oral hygiene. And at first, that was true.

For a week or two, the water tasted like water.

But soon, those with more sensitive palates noticed a change.

The water tasted sweet.

It was subtle at first, but before long everyone in town was talking about it. For us kids, it was mostly pleasant. Sugary drinks were usually a treat. Everyone thought it was odd—but people chalked it up to a minor issue that would be resolved quickly.

As the days passed and the water grew sweeter, people stopped talking about it altogether.

They were afraid that if they mentioned it, the sweetness might go away.

I remember the first time I stood in front of the refrigerator, staring at a bottle of soda—then turning instead to the kitchen faucet and pouring myself a glass of tap water.

The grocery store stopped selling bottled drinks. Even our fast-food stores served tap water with burgers and fries.

Mom and Dad no longer drank wine in the evenings, nor did they enjoy their morning coffee.

Along with the sweetness came another strange quality: if you boiled the water, it became incredibly bitter, leaving behind a thick tan residue on the pot or coffee maker.

But no one really seemed to mind.

No one wanted coffee. No one wanted soda. No one wanted beer or wine.

They just wanted the water from the tap.

I was no different.

For weeks, I drank nothing but the town’s water. I knew it was getting bad when school started and everyone—including the teachers—brought oversized water bottles to class, sipping constantly, unwilling to go even forty-five minutes without it.

Maybe things would have gone on that way forever.

But if whatever they added to the water was a problem, it turned out to be an even bigger one when they took it out.

I was sitting in third-period history, doodling away between sips from my water bottle when Sarah, one of my classmates, came back into the room from a bathroom break.

She stood in the doorway until even the teacher paused and looked at her.

“Are you okay, Sarah?”

Her eyes darted nervously around the room. She was panting, but trying to appear composed.

“The water… it’s back to normal.”

A murmur rose up in the class. Even the teacher’s eyes darted to his water bottle sitting on his desk.

“Are you sure?” he asked.

“I tried every water fountain and sink in the school. It’s gone.”

“Okay, okay. Not to worry. Let’s get back to class.”

Sarah sat down at the desk next to me, and the teacher started up again. But the air in the room was heavy. Everyone held onto their water bottles, taking smaller sips than normal.

And as I looked around the room, I noticed that Sarah wasn’t the only one whose bottle was now empty.

But Sarah was getting antsy.

She fidgeted and squirmed. Eventually, she turned to me; her face white.

“Eliot, can I have a little of your water?” she whispered.

I eyed my bottle. Less than a quarter left. There was no way I was giving any away.

I shook my head and pretended to be paying attention to the lecture.

But the next time I opened my bottle to take a sip, I was knocked out of my desk as Sarah tackled me from the side.

She grabbed for my bottle, but only managed to knock it across the room, spilling most of it across the floor.

Sarah, along with two other students, rushed for the bottle screaming, punching, pulling hair.

One kid sprawled across the floor lapping up the water that spilled when my bottle went flying.

Our teacher attempted to rein the class in, but soon students were rushing the front of the room grabbing at his water. He stood on the desk, kicking students in the face as they clamored for his bottle.

I was growing anxious. I could feel the tightening of my stomach. The insatiable craving for more tap water. But with each passing second, my chances of getting it in that classroom dwindled.

Then, a genius idea struck. The fountain!

Not a water fountain like you would drink from. No, the big concrete fountain that sat out front of Clearview High.

I dashed out the door and into the hallway, where more chaos erupted. Students were clamoring and fighting. One kid stood atop a security desk swinging a bat at anyone who approached. You’d think seeing someone get knocked out with a metal bat would deter others from trying the same thing. But the thirst was worse.

I ran past it all, out the front doors and into the courtyard. Only to find I was not the only person with the same idea. At least a dozen others were bent over the fountain lapping the water into their mouths. I took a spot between two other students, and for a moment, we all drank in peace. But soon others came. Some tried pushing their way through; others climbed over us to completely submerge themselves in the fountain.

Soon it was just as bad as inside.

I felt a hand grab the back of my shirt and rip me from the fountain, throwing me to the concrete. As I struggled to find another spot, I heard it. The sound of an engine revving. It got louder, tires screeched, and then a crash. The car plowed through a pile of people, through the concrete barrier of the fountain, and the water spilled out onto the ground, mingled with the blood of the dead and wounded.

A man emerged from the car, which was still running, and took his place among the throng fighting for just a drop of that sweet tap water.

I was right there among them. Stepping over bodies, I hurled myself onto the thin veins of water spreading out from the crumbling fountain.

I found a small puddle and ravenously lapped at the ground, likely drinking up more blood and dirt than anything else. But I needed it.

Even my small oasis was not safe.

I felt a flash of pain on the side of my head as I tumbled over. I could hardly see through the darkness that took over my vision in the wake of the blow. But I hurled myself back toward the water.

The man who had kicked me pinned me to the ground. His eyes were bloodshot; his face contorted in rage. And when he raised his fist to strike, I saw something glimmering in his hand. A knife.

He stabbed. I stopped his blow with my outstretched hands, receiving a deep gash on my forearm.

Just then, a siren sounded as black *RYNECORP* vans sped into the courtyard. My attacker looked away just long enough for me to slip out of his grasp.

Though wounded, I searched for another source of water as the vans parked all around, and men in gas masks and riot gear poured from the opening doors.

They raised their guns and fired into the crowd. Blue gas seeped out of cans tumbling across the concrete.

That was the last thing I remember before waking up at Clearview Regional Hospital. My head was wrapped, my arm was stitched, and my parents sat in chairs beside my bed.

“What happened?” I asked.

“Believe it or not, Eliot,” my dad said. “What they put in our water wasn’t fluoride. The mayor thinks it may have been sabotage—possibly HaleTech Industries.”

But my mom was having none of it.

I honestly can’t believe it. It feels like it took forever mostly because I set it up and then didn’t touch it for like three days. But I’ve realized that I *need* that pause. Once I get close to the finish line, I tend to hyper-focus and push until it’s done, so I need a couple days to decompress before going full send.

This morning, I finished the last two sections, and let me tell you… it was WORK. But I got in the zone because I was watching a documentary. I finished one section and thought, “Okay, I can keep going.” Then I started another documentary  and started *another* documentary. 😅So yeah I watched **three documentaries** to finish this painting. And you know what? Worth it.

I’m so proud of this one. I can’t even explain the joy it gives me to see it complete. I also figured out how to make my progress photos feel more animated like a little video instead of just a bunch of pictures and I literally stared at it for a good five minutes straight. It gives me that same feeling as a really good cup of coffee in the morning. That deep *sigh of relief*. ☕💎

Now… here’s the plot twist.  
I know I’ve been talking about starting my **Santa & Reindeer**, but I’m honestly debating whether I’m even going to start it. Technically, we’re six days from Christmas but for me, Christmas starts on the **24th**, since that’s when my family gets together. So realistically, I only have **five days**, and there’s just no way I’m finishing a huge canvas in that time. I’m very much a “seasonal for the season” person. It actually hurts my soul a little to work on seasonal pieces *after* the season is over (the pumpkin one almost did me in, but I knew it be finish it in a day, so it didn’t feel late 😅).  
So… yeah. I don’t think I’m starting Santa & Reindeer.

Instead, I’m going to work on a **Christmas gift** a small butterfly piece that I should be able to finish in a couple of sessions. That feels more doable and way less stressful.

Okay. I’ve rambled long enough. 😅

**✨ Today’s Prompt:**

**Show me your work in progress OR tell me what diamond painting has helped you with.**

Stress? Anxiety? Focus? Grief? Routine? Joy? Community?  
I’d really love to hear what this hobby has brought into your life. 💎❤️

Can’t wait to read your responses.

And since today’s prompt is about what diamond painting has helped us with, I should probably answer it myself too.

I have ADHD (as you’ve probably noticed 😅), and diamond painting really *calms* my brain in a way that’s hard to explain. Anyone who has struggled with anxiety or depression knows what it feels like to be alone with your thoughts when your mind won’t slow down and everything feels heavy.

Diamond painting provides focus and quiets the mental noise. It also gives me a strong sense of accomplishment. Taking these tiny drills, something so small, and slowly building them into something beautiful...that feeling truly matters.

During challenging times, this hobby has provided me with an escape. More importantly, it has fostered a sense of community. Witnessing others' creations, sharing our progress, connecting through conversation  it has truly helped me to feel less isolated.

That’s what diamond painting has helped me with. 💎❤️

1pr0rit,https://i.redd.it/rm1m3vne798g1.jpeg,Oxford 2026,"Create a hyper-realistic, high-resolution image of an attractive young British woman taking a mirror selfie with her iPhone in her bedroom. She has long, glossy blonde hair styled in a casual high ponytail. Her facial features are natural and proportional, with clear, healthy skin, bright expressive eyes, and a warm, confident smile. Her makeup is subtle and flattering, enhancing her natural beauty. She is wearing a classic Oxford varsity jacket, slightly oversized for a relaxed look, paired with casual shirt shorts. The outfit is casual yet stylish, emphasizing comfort and personality rather than formality.
She is leaning slightly over her desk, one hand resting on the desk surface while holding her iPhone in the other to capture a mirror selfie. Her posture is confident and playful, with a subtle curve to her body that emphasizes her natural silhouette. She looks directly into the mirror with a relaxed, self-assured gaze, her expression warm and inviting. Her pose conveys charm and confidence without exaggeration, maintaining a realistic and tasteful aesthetic.
The iPhone perspective is integrated naturally, showing her arm and part of her hand holding the phone, with the mirror reflecting her figure and the room behind her. The depth of field keeps her sharply in focus, while the background is gently blurred, enhancing the realism of a selfie. The lighting is natural and flattering: soft daylight enters through a window, complemented by a warm glow from a bedside lamp or desk light, casting subtle shadows that create depth and realism.
The bedroom has a distinctly British feel, combining practical functionality with personal touches. The walls are painted in a neutral shade such as pale cream or soft gray. Framed photos, small posters, and prints of British cityscapes or personal travel photos decorate the walls. A small floating shelf holds books, potted plants, and a few decorative items, such as a miniature red telephone box or Union Jack trinket. A radiator is visible beneath the window, and patterned curtains are partially drawn to let in natural light.
The desk she is leaning on is tidy but lived-in, with a small desk lamp casting a warm glow, a laptop partially open, a few notebooks and stationery, and a mug of tea or coffee. The bed is visible in the background, made with soft bedding and a casually draped throw blanket. A small rug lies on the floor, and a few personal items such as folded clothes, a tote bag, or sneakers are arranged naturally around the room. String lights or fairy lights add a cozy, ambient touch.
Textures should be realistic: the varsity jacket and shirt shorts show natural folds and movement, hair catches highlights from the soft lighting, and her skin displays subtle natural texture. Reflections in the mirror are accurate, and the iPhone screen and hand are realistically proportioned.
Background details emphasize everyday life in a young British adult’s bedroom without appearing staged. Books, stationery, personal photos, and small decorative objects are arranged casually. The window shows a hint of a British suburban street or rooftops in soft focus, reinforcing location without distracting from the subject.
The composition should feel like an authentic, candid mirror selfie. She is the clear focal point, with her confident, slightly playful pose framed naturally in the mirror. Depth of field, shadows, reflections, and lighting should all behave realistically, making the image feel like a true iPhone photograph rather than a rendered or staged scene.
Overall, the image should feel intimate and personal, capturing a moment of self-confidence and charm. The mood is warm, relaxed, and inviting, highlighting her natural attractiveness and personality in a realistic British bedroom.

1pr0pz7,https://i.redd.it/8udhtil1798g1.jpeg,Oxford 2026 ⬇️⬇️⬇️,"Create a hyper-realistic, high-resolution image of an attractive young British woman taking a mirror selfie with her iPhone in her bedroom. She has long, glossy blonde hair styled in a casual high ponytail. Her facial features are natural and proportional, with clear, healthy skin, bright expressive eyes, and a warm, confident smile. Her makeup is subtle and flattering, enhancing her natural beauty. She is wearing a classic Oxford varsity jacket, slightly oversized for a relaxed look, paired with casual shirt shorts. The outfit is casual yet stylish, emphasizing comfort and personality rather than formality.
She is leaning slightly over her desk, one hand resting on the desk surface while holding her iPhone in the other to capture a mirror selfie. Her posture is confident and playful, with a subtle curve to her body that emphasizes her natural silhouette. She looks directly into the mirror with a relaxed, self-assured gaze, her expression warm and inviting. Her pose conveys charm and confidence without exaggeration, maintaining a realistic and tasteful aesthetic.
The iPhone perspective is integrated naturally, showing her arm and part of her hand holding the phone, with the mirror reflecting her figure and the room behind her. The depth of field keeps her sharply in focus, while the background is gently blurred, enhancing the realism of a selfie. The lighting is natural and flattering: soft daylight enters through a window, complemented by a warm glow from a bedside lamp or desk light, casting subtle shadows that create depth and realism.
The bedroom has a distinctly British feel, combining practical functionality with personal touches. The walls are painted in a neutral shade such as pale cream or soft gray. Framed photos, small posters, and prints of British cityscapes or personal travel photos decorate the walls. A small floating shelf holds books, potted plants, and a few decorative items, such as a miniature red telephone box or Union Jack trinket. A radiator is visible beneath the window, and patterned curtains are partially drawn to let in natural light.
The desk she is leaning on is tidy but lived-in, with a small desk lamp casting a warm glow, a laptop partially open, a few notebooks and stationery, and a mug of tea or coffee. The bed is visible in the background, made with soft bedding and a casually draped throw blanket. A small rug lies on the floor, and a few personal items such as folded clothes, a tote bag, or sneakers are arranged naturally around the room. String lights or fairy lights add a cozy, ambient touch.
Textures should be realistic: the varsity jacket and shirt shorts show natural folds and movement, hair catches highlights from the soft lighting, and her skin displays subtle natural texture. Reflections in the mirror are accurate, and the iPhone screen and hand are realistically proportioned.
Background details emphasize everyday life in a young British adult’s bedroom without appearing staged. Books, stationery, personal photos, and small decorative objects are arranged casually. The window shows a hint of a British suburban street or rooftops in soft focus, reinforcing location without distracting from the subject.
The composition should feel like an authentic, candid mirror selfie. She is the clear focal point, with her confident, slightly playful pose framed naturally in the mirror. Depth of field, shadows, reflections, and lighting should all behave realistically, making the image feel like a true iPhone photograph rather than a rendered or staged scene.
Overall, the image should feel intimate and personal, capturing a moment of self-confidence and charm. The mood is warm, relaxed, and inviting, highlighting her natural attractiveness and personality in a realistic British bedroom. The image should appear as a high-quality, hyper-realistic 8K iPhone photo, with accurate textures, lighting, and proportions, creating a believable and tasteful portrait of a young British woman in her personal space.",4,1766190466.0,GeminiNanoBanana2,0,1.0,False

Pretty severe dead bedroom. Had sex only once this year. Progressively worse as time went on. The dead bedroom isn’t a taboo, we talk about it, he in therapy but not making much progress. Basically, he has had a very traumatic upbringing and an unbearable mother. Most of his intimacy problems are not directly malicious, which makes the whole problem (aka leaving) that much harder. I know that I am not the problem- not my looks, not my body.

This summer I met a man some twenty years older than me. Very successful and powerful. He was immediately drawn to me, but I decided to overlook that. We remained in casual contact and he even met my husband who knows that we are friends and he suspects nothing. Well, staying in touch, something happened. We went out for coffee one day, I thought nothing of it, but then he looked at me and told me that I was beautiful and that I surely know how he feels about me- no pressure as he knows that I am married. He took me to a party with some people and no one knew I was married. I realized most of his friends knew about me already by name. When I casually mentioned my husband, they were surprised as I guess he spoke about me at lengths save for that one detail.

Nothing sexual happened, but both he and I know there are severe sparks. He told me he would wait for me for as long as I want. Asked me to think of something and go with him to Spain in two months. I told him that it’s difficult and that I am very torn. When I got home, I basically jumped my husband and we had sex. I’d usually get turned off by him not initiating and generally seeming not into it but this time I didn’t care. I used all the energy from the other man and I poured it into him. We had okay sex but it mostly felt like self pleasure for me and my fantasy. Afterwards, I felt good that we had sex and he withdrew as he always does after we have sex.

On the one hand, I have stability with my husband and I love him. On the other hand, when this man just looks at me, I feel electricity through my entire body like I haven’t felt in years. I even got my period right on time (my hormones have been out of whack) and I feel like my libido is skyrocketing. At the same time, I do not want to demolish my marriage. My family loves my husband, I love him, he is my person, but a part of me is so drawn to this feeling of being wanted, of potential with this man I find immensely attractive and interesting.

I don’t know what to do. I already feel guilty writing this. But thinking about this other man disappearing from my life leaves me just as miserable as thinking I might betray my husband. Help.",6,1766190398.0,DeadBedrooms,7,0.88,False

One he’s a drinker, not daily but frequently. Two he is/was constantly talking to other women online. He blames my coldness and distant behaviours (I self isolate when when it gets bad because he’s not great to talk to.) He claims he talks to them because I don’t make him feel attractive or needed. 

Recently it all came to a head when he got physical with me. I won’t go into many details but I ended up at his sisters overnight and she’s basically disgusted in him. He told me to leave and I called my uncle and my cousin and asked if they could come pick me up. I can’t live with them due to small space but I’d be able to stay there while I get situated in a shelter with my daughter. Not ideal but it got me away. 

When I informed him that I had a ride and I’d be leaving, he switched up. He immediately told me he’d get sober, cut the girls off and we could work on repairing this. However I just don’t want to. I’m so close to being done and I’m exhausted with the chase. I’m so tempted to just start saving all of my money and tell my family to come get me this spring. I’m terrified to be in a shelter with my daughter and unsure what I’ll do with my cats, one of whom has been with me for a decade so rehoming isn’t ever gonna happen. 

I’m disgusted. I’m tired and I’ve never felt so alone. We moved into the middle of nowhere to raise his little brother after his dad passed and I just hate it.

Did  not get any express or timed entry as there were no passes available for our party of 4. For some reason there were passes but maxed out at 2-3 , and then the date greyed out.

Kept checking for few weeks and then gave up.
Booked a hotel closed to USJ, like walking distance.
One of the family members stood in inline 625a.m. about 20-30 ppl at each security kiosk entrance (12-15 enterances)
Others joined with sandwich from Lawson + coffee at 715am. Line was now 3 times already.
Security opened 745 - snacks inside backpack was not stopped or probably not checked thoroughly.
Liquids yes, water bottle need to be shown and coffee extra not allowed in hand.
Second lineup at enterance - Pass scan gates. Packed ..nice to see Hollywood ride zooming by getting it's warm up /test run. Birds flying in groups in blue sky ..beautiful morning.
830am- staff enters in style, speaker music goes higher , gates open.

Rush to SNW , got on DK in 20Mins, MarioKart in 30-40mins next, explored SNW , kept checking for later timed entry , it did not show up. Got powerband .
Did Jurassic Park Ride (flying was out of order), Minions Mayhem, Balster , Harry Porter - both rides, Snoopy roller coaster, Jaws, back to Nintendo park after sunset, saw a few live performances , light show at the HP Castle was beautiful, the park in evening with much playing with Xmas lights and hollywood ride going around was excellent vibe. None of us had the courage to go on Hollywood rides. Also, came out of park at 130pm-245pm to eat and relax -droped popcorn bucket , jacket and some souveniers at hotel, many eateries just outside USJ walkway have better food options for dietary restrictions (pls do not eat at the Udon place next to Nene Chicken, the family running it does not show an ounce of Japanese hospitality , just avoid) 

Overall we really enjoyed USJ much much better than Disney! 
They had SNW open all day, except ride lineup was long. But the other rides are more memorable ...we could have got on Minion or Harry Porter again in evenig , but wanted to check out SNW at night. 
Glad we did not get the overblown expensive passes as only SNW would have been worth it..other rides in morning are not that bad and paying express passes in USD for many might be cheap , but not for everyone.

Vs. our Disneysea experience , we stayed 45min away hotel. Reached park entrance 8am, park was massive , lineups were massive, payed timed passes for couple of rides, it was very packed and overall felt more rushed, crowded, overwhelming. Soaring was great but now feels overrated for USJ similar type rides ..also I suppose for more higher age group USJ themes suited us better. 

Tl,dr: reach early and you can get on most rides, without any timed entry or Xpass, save $ to spend on souveniers and other additional fun stuff ! Happy holidays everyone!!",0,1766190287.0,usj,0,0.5,False

When I told him it was the middle of the night, he looked at me like I was the crazy one. He pointed to the clock and said, 'It’s eight o’clock, don’t be late!' Now I’m awake, he’s frustrated, and we’re both exhausted.""

To you, this is a grueling disruption of your sleep and a bizarre break from reality. To his brain in 2025, he is experiencing **""Circadian Rhythm Inversion""** and **""Clock Blindness.""** The part of the brain that regulates the sleep-wake cycle (the suprachiasmatic nucleus) has been physically damaged. He isn't ""choosing"" to wake up; his brain has simply lost the ability to tell the difference between 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM.

As a specialist in behavioral gerontology, I want to help you ""reset the sun"" so you can both get back to sleep.

1. The ""AM/PM"" Translation

For a healthy brain, ""8:00"" is interpreted based on the light outside and the context of the day.

* **The Sensation:** In dementia, the brain loses ""contextual cues."" If he wakes up from a nap or a light sleep and sees ""8:00"" on a digital clock, his brain defaults to the most ""active"" association: *Morning.*
* **The Action:** Getting dressed and making coffee is a ""Success Routine."" His brain is executing a lifelong habit of being a productive adult. He isn't trying to be difficult; he’s trying to be ""on time.""

2. The Trap of ""Look at the Dark""

When you point at the window and say, ""Look, Dad, it’s pitch black outside, it’s 2:00 in the morning,"" you are using **Environmental Logic.**

* **The Logic:** You think the darkness will prove him wrong.
* **The Flaw:** Many people with dementia suffer from ""Visual Processing Deficits."" To him, the dark window might just look like a wall or a mirror. His brain trusts the ""8:00"" on the clock more than the ""black hole"" of the window.

3. The Immediate Behavioral Solution: ""The 24-Hour Reality""

In 2025, we stop using ""Standard"" cues and start using ""Dementia-Specific"" tools.

* **The ""Day/Night"" Clock:** Replace all standard digital clocks with a ""Dementia Calendar Clock."" These specifically say, ""NOW IT IS TUESDAY NIGHT"" or ""NOW IT IS WEDNESDAY MORNING."" This removes the 8:00/8:00 ambiguity and provides a direct text-based anchor.
* **The ""Sun-Sync"" Lighting:** Use smart bulbs to automate the ""Mood"" of the house. At 8:00 PM, the lights should dim to a warm amber. At 8:00 AM, they should be bright ""daylight"" blue. This provides a biological ""nudge"" to his internal clock.
* **The ""Blackout"" Protocol:** If he wakes up because of streetlights or passing cars, use blackout curtains. Any light ""leakage"" at 2:00 AM can be misinterpreted by his brain as the start of the dawn.

4. How to Handle the ""Midnight Coffee""

If he is already in the kitchen, do not argue about the time.

* **The Pivot:** Join his reality momentarily. ""You’re right, it says eight o’clock! But the news hasn't even started yet. Why don't we have a small 'pre-breakfast' snack and lay back down until the sun comes up?""
* **The Result:** You have validated his ""clock"" without confirming it’s morning. By providing a ""Small Snack"" (like warm milk or a piece of toast), you trigger the body’s natural post-eating sleepiness (postprandial somnolence) to help him drift back off.

Time is a fragile concept in dementia care. When you stop being the ""Timekeeper"" and start being the ""Environment Manager,"" the midnight breakfast shifts back to a midnight rest.

1pr0mfd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pr0mfd,Happy accidental purchase :),"I've never been a fan of coffee, both the smell and the caffeine makes me jittery. I love kanero no sugar hard candy though, and I love their milk throat candy. I realised they had tea flavoured ones so I ordered some on Doorzo (at least, I thought they were the tea flavoured ones as this series is called ""coffee tea house"" and has both flavours). For months it sat in storage and I dreamt of nice tea flavoured candy. When they finally arrived, to my shock it was coffee flavoured. I was pretty disappointed at myself for not checking clearly and ordered the tea one for later. However, after trying them I'm very happy with the flavour. So far I've only tried the milker one, which was a lovely balance between the rich aroma of coffee (a bit like roasted dark chocolate) and a smooth milky base. I thought it was so tasty! And like all non-sugar kanero candies, they do not leave an aftertaste or sticky feeling in the mouth after you're finished. I also did not feel jittery so the caffeine is probably quite low. So happy I made that mistake and now I get to enjoy really nice candy that I would've never ordered if I knew it was coffee

How do I even begin this story without it turning into an analysis of my ex-boyfriend or my own mental state? A few things to mention first: we met on a dating app and had a really long, nice phone call. People often tell me that I rush into things and that I am pretty naive. He is two years older than me, and due to an injury as well as other past poor decisions, he decided not to return to school for an unknown amount of time to finish his degree.

He pressured me into dating him. I wanted to take things slower, but he kept asking and reassuring me that everything would be better if we just committed. Eventually, I did, reluctantly, because of how fast everything was moving. I met his friends and family very early on, which shocked me given the speed of the relationship. We became increasingly intimate. We took some time before having penetrative sex, and I am only sharing this because it is anonymous, but I had sexual trauma and still do. We worked through it slowly, though we were both very physically drawn to each other. We could not keep our hands off each other, and it is important to note that he lived in the same apartment as his mother.

As time passed, it became difficult to adjust to a dynamic where it felt like everyone had a say in our relationship. At times, I could overhear him complaining about spending money, even though he had been nonchalant about it during our first few dates. I was transparent about my situation. I was focused on studying, wanted to go to grad school, and relied mostly on my parents financially. Eventually, because I was constantly at his mother’s apartment and we were having sex all the time, and we only ever left to go on expensive restaurant dates, she lost her patience and kicked me out.

As this tension grew, so did the tension between his friends and me. They rebuked me, accusing me of being stuck-up or asking for too much, even though he never clearly communicated expectations around money or his ability to provide food outside of my campus. I wished he had been clear from the beginning. Was it wrong for me to expect to be fed when all we did for hours was switch between homework and sex while he switched between sex, video games, and alcohol?

I kept breaking up with him, and his friends would reach out, convincing me to take him back. I still question why I stayed. Was it because of the sex? Because I fell for him even though everyone told me he was not good for me? Did I attach because of intimacy? Did I convince myself he was the best I would ever do, or did I let him convince me of that?

Eventually, I grew resentful. He wanted constant contact and validation, checked my phone, and expected me to play nice with friends and family who clearly disliked me. Over time, it felt like he wanted me to be both a housewife and the breadwinner. I finally gave up and broke up with him for the eighth time.

To anyone reading this, I really tried. I tried to understand his financial situation, the scars from his only previous relationship, and how his parents’ divorce affected him. I tried to help him, and he tried to help me in his own way. Still, I became borderline suicidal because of how deprioritized and insecure his inconsistency and alcohol-like tendencies made me feel, tendencies that his family and friends enabled.

I love him deeply. But the stress of my major, my family being on my case after finding out about him, and my overall lack of support pushed me to pull the plug. I crashed out badly. I cut up his clothes, cussed him out through messages, lashed out at his friends, and completely lost control again. I drank alcohol, a Celsius, and a Starbucks coffee all together. I am not proud of this.

What I am trying to ask is this: how am I supposed to feel okay or have any sense of self-worth when the one man who treated me with some level of respect still fell miles short of a relationship worth my time and love? I clung to him so tightly that the day before the final breakup, I called him to pick me up just so I could have someone hold me and keep me from hurting myself. I really did love him, who writes that many love letters to someone and be treated this poorly.

Hello everyone,

It’s already the last Friday before the December update. The official patch notes will be released on the 23rd next week, but since you are the one team building inZOI together with us, we’re sharing them with you a little earlier here on Discord. Please understand that some development details may still change over the weekend.

We’re also giving you an early look at a video currently in the final stages of this week’s development.

Today was a hectic day as we wrapped up the December update, but we managed to spend a fun moment together with the development team. I’ve just returned to the studio and wanted to send this message and materials to you right away.

If more videos or materials come together, we’d love to share the inZOI team's little celebration with you as well.

See you again next week!

Start your own business today!

**Business Presets**

**Employees**

* **\[Employee Hiring and Placement\]** You can hire acquaintances or household members as employees. As your business level increases, you will be able to hire more employees.

■ **Crime**

Not all Zois have to lead honest lives. With this update, Zois can now scam and steal their way into a life of crime, opening the door to a path paved in both danger and delight.

\* Crime-related features are currently in the early stages of development and will be updated with additional content in the future. Currently, only Young Adult and older Zois can commit crimes.

**Thieves**

* Become a thief and break into property to steal items!
* Various thief interactions have been added, including ""Pick Door Lock"", ""Break Down Door"", ""Open Safe"", and ""Sabotage Surveillance Camera"".
* The success rates of thief interactions are influenced by Handiwork, Programming, and Fitness skills.
* Some properties may have traps such as surveillance cameras and alarms installed.

**Scammers**

* Scam other Zois for a chance to strike it rich!
* Various scammer interactions have been added, including ""Attempt Voice Phishing"", ""Scam In-Game Items"", ""Impersonate Charity Worker"", and ""Hold Fake Seminar"".
* The success rates of scammer interactions are influenced by the Rhetoric and Critical Thinking skills.

**Crime Interactions**

* Zois that meet one or more of the following conditions will unlock the first crime interaction available at Crime Skill Lv.0:

1. Owns 2,000 Mew or less, or is struggling due to excessive debt
2. Is under significant psychological stress from lack of family support or ongoing family conflict
3. Has the Rulebreaker trait or the Malicious characteristic

**Suspicious Job Agency**

* The Suspicious Job Agency has been added, allowing Zois to take on shady jobs and collect crime information.
* Use the Agency's Bulletin Board to purchase crime information.

**Crime Scores**

* When a Zoi witnesses a crime, they will report it to the police. The responding officers may then issue an immediate fine or take the Zoi into custody.
* Performing crime interactions increases a Zoi's crime score.

**Wanted Status**

* Thieves who successfully escape the scene of a crime may be placed under a wanted notice for one day and will be put under arrest if they encounter the police during this time.
* The wanted period lasts up to one day.

■ **Trials**

A life of crime has its consequences. Some Zois may find themselves under arrest and forced into trial after meeting certain conditions. Outcomes are determined by choices made both before and during the trial, and Zois can appoint lawyers to improve their chances in court.

In addition to being a form of punishment, trials add additional depth to a Zoi's life.

**Arrests**

* Zois with a low crime score will receive a fine if they are arrested.
* Zois whose crime score exceeds the threshold can be immediately arrested by the police.
* Zois placed under immediate arrest can post bail to secure time to prepare for their trial.
* After being arrested, Zois who post bail will be released, while those who do not will remain in a detention center until the trial begins.

**Appointing Lawyers**

* You can appoint a lawyer by selecting your Zoi.
* Free lawyers provide limited assistance, while elite lawyers offer better chances of reduced sentences or acquittal.
* When a lawyer is appointed, a trial preparation mission will be assigned, and its results will directly influence the opportunity cards that appear during the actual trial.

**Trials**

* Trials will usually result in a guilty verdict. Not-guilty verdicts are difficult to secure and require special preparation. Failed attempts at acquittal may lead to even harsher sentences.
* Depending on the outcome, Zois may either be acquitted, fined, or placed under police custody.
* The trial proceeds automatically, but choosing the correct answers for the opportunity cards that appear during the trial can help reduce your sentence.

**Courts**

* New court properties have been added. Zois scheduled to stand trial must visit these properties on their designated trial dates. *\* In this update, trials for “Traffic Accidents” will not take place. As before, Zois will be sent directly to jail. This will be improved in a future update.*

■ **Gameplay**

1pr0e2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Voicesofthevoid/comments/1pr0e2j/09b_votv_first_experience/,(0.9b) VotV First Experience,"I wanted to put in writing my fresh experience with 0.9b as the version I chose to try the game out for myself.

I knew beforehand it was a shadow/experimental build. I also knew it had tons of cool features I wanted to try; new ATV, drone, base, gameplay loop, items and upgrades. This is information I was exposed to through videos on YT from several content creators.

Tutorial was perfect. I'm glad I learned the new controls from the get-go and didn't build muscle memory for the old ones.

Base, Item, Upgrade & Income Progression

The 1st week was slow and a bit overwhelming. Garbage collection, getting used to satellite locations, console commands and server repair mini-games. I obtained the half-hooks near T\_1, somehow didn't spawn Krampus and got lots of energy boosts from presents via Toblerone/Coffee Chocolate (cause the cupped coffee spilled 70% of time right after opening the presents). Most of the loot I got including food was left in the main hallway, which lead to a hammer fight against the blue brain cheese that I won due to the abundance of healing items. Imagine my surprise when I later looked up the in-game item to find out it's a real life cheese. This was the only week where I did not receive the weekly 500 points bonus.

The 2nd/3rd week I started using the wiki, YT and Reddit a lot. My gameplay started to pick up from there on. Broke the supply crates and cubicles with my hammer and finished doing so just before finding out about the crowbar and axe. An overhaul of Alpha Root Base was made possible with the purchase of the hacksaw and woodchipper around this time. I spawned Krampus and we had a staring contest while my brew was fermenting in a bucket. I purchased the Krampus Hat the next day and never took it off.  
Two more relevant acquisitions were made with the weekly bonuses and daily task rewards stacking up; the ATV solar panels which rendered the battery charger obsolete (never even interacted with it) and the big flash light (no more thinking twice before pressing F ever again).

I always had something to do.

I never seemed to get enough time to clean up my base. By the time I finished the end of Story Mode events was nigh. The Pressure Washer and Big Sponge were okay but the Mop was king for stains and the Soap was its crown.  
I bought some boxes to store the scrap I was about to craft from all the piles of trash around the base. My intuition for going through this process for the first time was pretty spot on. Put all the coal in the cremator, turn glass/plastic/paper/rubber/metal/electronic trash into scrap and store it. Take off the drone bag, carry it around and put every piece of wood inside of it.  
For props that I didn't like, I sold what I could grab, I hacksawed what I could and woodchippered the rest.  
Then I finished the job with the Wall Fixer and Cement.

I was always looking to buy more upgrades and tools, however points were scarce for the prodigal lone denizen of the Alpha Root Base. My extra source of income from what I could tell would have me farming or mining ores or points. I had a bunch of scrap and when it came to fitting the vibe of VotV the latter appealed most to me.  
8 points = 4 drives = 1 electronic scrap  
12 metal scrap per dumpster hacksawed and there's bunch at the back of Alpha Root Base and more at The Hole -> added to the scrap made from metal trash around the base it would be enough for like 30+ coolers.  
2 full rigs were enough for me. Not only were they making a substantial amount of points, but the fully upgraded transformers were draining pretty fast.  
I once heard some explosions from my base and panic saved on the spot, big mistake. Turns out I put my sound-proof foam I got from Santa too close to the rigs and they started overheating. One of 'em was at like 300% temperature. I ended up using 4 fire extinguishers to get it back to 0.

The next quest I was looking at would have been the bunker. I knew I needed to access it to acquire the ""Kerfur Omega"" complete manual.  
As it is known, the hook is wanky in this version, so I couldn't get the key card. This was not the only problem, the safe with the Omega AI Module was on top of the ice lake, opened and empty. Luckily for me, I was past day 30 so Sandbox Mode was unlocked.  
I wasn't able to spawn the Bunker Keycard and Omega AI module (nor ""Kerfur Omega"" complete manual). My guess would be because I haven't unlocked them in story mode yet. So, I changed my PC calendar to a different month, got in Sandbox, opened the safe, got the module, teleported inside the bunker, got the keycard, saved, opened file directory, changed the b to a s, updated the files, launched the formerly Sandbox world, put both items in the mailbox, saved, and deleted the world.  
I got two Radioactive Capsules from the presents, not that I had a pickaxe anyway (didn't spawn on top of the ice). Could've save-scummed the presents for the Omega AI Module as well, but couldn't be bothered since I was going to cheat anyways to give myself the Bunker Keycard. The rest was easy and the beast came online but not before cleaning my newly accessed bunker and filling any wall cracks there as well. I didn't miss the secret basement either.

There's lots of cool items and features that were present in my playthrough that I didn't mention. I definitely should have thoroughly browsed the store earlier in the playthrough.          

Events

The frequency and interval between 'em was spot on almost always. I enjoyed the random events, discovering secret areas of the map, funny mode, building rep with the Arirals and getting pranked by them. I really liked how threatening the Wisps were, how powerless I felt against the Rozitals, how creepy the Grays were. Died a bunch hooking down The Hole and defeating the Flamethrower Tank, but it was really fun.

The only regret I have is playing in December.  
  
Krampus is cool and all, but the presents are really good and the map is fucked. I'm not even talking about river items, the snow is so annoying. Getting ragdolled as autosave kicks in? I guess my unique Axe with highest dps in the game is gone, John Snow claimed it. Tried looking for a way to turn off snow in keybinds and settings in general, activating seasons, activating permanent summer, tried brute force looking for it, even tried unorthodox methods like using the magnetism of the Unknown Object or reloading the game to unload the snow for a brief second, nope, still gone until spring. But that's all there is, just one regret of experiencing an unpolished feature that wasn't even tied to 0.9b.

It's been a while since I last binged a game for one week. Voices of the Void is really fun and unique. Top 10 for me, even in pre-alpha.

TL;DR

1pr0ddh,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1pr0ddh/vanilla_reviews/,vanilla reviews,"I was asked about my tastes in vanilla perfumes, so, here we go, in absolutely no particular order.. 😊

(Please forgive me for all the scents I’ve inevitably forgotten. These opinions are mine, lovingly formed through sampling, overspraying, and reckless financial decisions. They might (and probably will) differ from yours, and that’s okay.

Final note: English is not my mother tongue, so please excuse any grammatical mishaps. If something sounds odd, please let know. 😊 Also an edit for some typos)

 

Spiritueuse Double Vanille - Guerlain

One of my personal favourites, and honestly, it’s not hard to see why. This is warm, smooth, perfectly blended vanilla excellence. A deep, heavy, grown-up vanilla wrapped in rum, amber, spices and soft woods - and yes, more amber, because why stop when something works? It smells decadent, luxurious and unapologetically opulent, like sipping a perfectly aged spirit in a dimly lit room with expensive furniture you’re afraid to touch.

This is not a playful vanilla. This is vanilla with a credit score. If you have the budget to splurge, absolutely sample it - but let me be clear: this is not a safe blind buy. She demands to be courted first.

 

Tobacco Vanille - TF

Ah yes, thé tobacco vanilla. The reference point. The scent everyone compares everything else to. And for good reason. This opens with the most stunning, rich tobacco note - the kind you’d find in those glorious cigar boxes your grandpa only brought out on special occasions. The spices swirl in and suddenly you’re transported to smoky jazz clubs, creaky wooden floors, leather chairs and record players that definitely cost more than your rent.

The dry-down? A perfectly balanced, classy vanilla with woody and slightly fruity undertones that wraps around you like a well-tailored coat. Is it expensive? Yes. Is it worth it? Also yes. Overhyped to some, nostalgic perfection to others. Another not-safe-to-blind-buy, but an absolute icon.

 

Angélique Noire - Guerlain

A green vanilla, but not in a “trying to be different” way, but in a very beautiful, elegant and successfully executed way. This scent balances fresh, green, sweet and creamy so beautifully it almost feels unfair. The angelica brings freshness, the pear adds gentle sweetness, the pepper sparkles just enough, and the vanilla ties it all together without overpowering the composition.

It’s foresty, slightly herbaceous, and oddly poetic. Imagine standing in a forest during golden hour, the sun slowly dipping below the horizon, sipping sweetened tea while a cool breeze brushes past your face. Hard to explain, impossible to forget. Stunning in spring and warm autumn days. Sample-worthy, without question.



Eau Duelle EDT - Diptique (EDT, EDP is just not as good Imo)

Let’s stay in green vanilla territory a little longer. Eau Duelle is soft, airy, gentle and quietly spicy. It opens with a stunning juniper note that bowls me over every single time - fresh, aromatic and slightly resinous. This is not a loud vanilla. This is a whispered vanilla, drifting through a forest filled with old books, fir trees and faint incense smoke.

Does it lack projection and longevity? Yes. Do I forgive it immediately? Also yes. It shines in autumn, when you want to smell thoughtful, calm and a little mysterious. My only complaint is the price-to-performance ratio - and my bank account agrees.

 

Vanilla Planifolia Extrait 21

Let’s not pretend - this is vanilla royalty. Guerlain doesn’t do vanilla; Guerlain OWNS vanilla. VP is vanilla pushed to its absolute limits: dense, spicy, rich, slightly sweet, and shockingly long-lasting. One spray will outlive your plans, your patience, and possibly your social battery. It will last you all day… and night… and possibly the next fiscal year.

Yes, it costs an arm, a leg, and maybe a kidney - but you’ll only need a microscopic amount. It smells like the finest vanilla beans on earth were personally selected, blessed, and turned into liquid gold. To me, this is the final boss of vanilla perfumes. The queen. I’ve heard whispers of discontinuation, and honestly? At this price point, I’m not sure whether to cry or thank the universe.

 

Indult - Tihota

If you ask someone to define vanilla, they should just hand you this bottle. Tihota is linear, unapologetic, and completely focused on doing one thing exceptionally well. This is rich, dark, high-quality vanilla - no twists, no distractions, no unnecessary drama.

It smells like vanilla bean in its purest, most indulgent form. And while it’s eye-wateringly expensive, it earns its reputation. Longevity is excellent, the scent is flawless, and vanilla lovers consistently rank it among the best. Simple, powerful, and impossible to deny.

 

Bianco Latte 

This perfume does not enter a room - it announces itself. With a megaphone, a brassband and an airplane flying overhead with a sign screaming VANILLA. Loud, creamy, buttery, lactonic, sweet and absolutely shameless. It projects like a Times Square billboard and lasts longer than all our New Year’s resolutions combined. If you love gourmand vanillas and want them extra, this one is for you.

It smells like being hit in the face with a vanilla milkshake, then dipped in honey and coumarin for good measure. This scent is not whispering; it’s screaming GOURMAND through a megaphone like a vuvuzela on steroids. Is it subtle? No. Is it incredible? Unfortunately, yes. (Lattafa Eclair is a very similar alternative for an even better price point.)

 

Escapade Gourmande – Maison Mataha

Crème brûlée, but make it couture. This is caramelised brown sugar, airy yet rich, opulent yet elegant. It sits somewhere between indulgent and refined - like dessert served on fine china.

It’s often compared to Fire At Will, but where FAW leans floral, Escapade Gourmande stays firmly in sugar–vanilla–tonka territory. If you want a gourmand vanilla that doesn’t shout like Bianco Latte but still delivers serious deliciousness, this is your girl.



Lira - Xerjoff (casamorati)

This is thé lemony vanilla in my collection - although if we’re being honest, I get more blood orange than lemon. It’s zesty, bright, and immediately mouth-watering, before melting into a rich, caramelised vanilla with a gorgeous cinnamon backbone. In winter, it smells like freshly baked Italian citrus cake made by your nonna, who insists you eat a second slice. In summer, it transforms into warm evenings, shared laughter, and golden sunsets.

There’s a subtle hint of lavender that adds a little sophistication and stops it from becoming a sugar bomb. Cozy, gourmand, joyful - Italian lemon cake at its finest.

Same family: Devotion (louder and sparklier), Akro Bake, Love & Crime (spicier), HoS Hufflepuff (also delicious, also painfully expensive).

 

Gentle Fluidity Gold - MFK

A vanilla for people who want elegance without effort. This is not a gourmand vanilla - no baked goods here. Instead, it’s clean, luminous, and softly sweet, like vanilla filtered through silk. It sparkles gently in the opening, then settles into a warm, musky, slightly ambery glow that clings to the skin beautifully.

It feels refined, airy, and quietly luxurious, like wearing a translucent veil that smells faintly of vanilla and confidence. The kind of scent that never overwhelms but always leaves an impression.

 

Billie Eilish – Eilish

A surprisingly cozy and comforting chocolate-vanilla. This is smooth, creamy, lactonic and warm, with a beautiful cacao note that makes it feel like a hug in scent form. It’s sweet without being juvenile and gourmand without being overwhelming.

Chocolate lovers will adore this. It gets compared to Nebras by Lattafa. Easy to wear, easy to love, and much better than anyone expected.

 

Vanilla Diorama

Vanilla, but done in a very sexy Parisian way. This is warm, spicy, boozy and elegant, yet less gourmand than the name might suggest. Cardamom and sandalwood give it a spicy, creamy depth, while rum and a hint of orange add richness and warmth.

Some say it’s reserved for special winter occasions. Personally? I ignore that advice entirely and bathe in it throughout December. It’s refined, seductive, and effortlessly chic - winter staple behaviour.

 

Herod - PDM

A deeply comforting tobacco vanilla that leans warm, ambery and rich. The tobacco here is smooth and inviting rather than harsh, wrapped in cozy vanilla and subtle sweetness. Perfect for cold weather, but probably a bit much for summer unless you enjoy causing olfactory chaos.

tip: If you’re curious about tobacco fragrances but unsure where to start, this is an excellent gateway scent. Sexy, smooth, and very easy to appreciate.

 

Orchidée Vanille – Van Cleef & Arpels

This smells like walking past a bakery and immediately abandoning all plans. Vanilla wafts through the air, soft and warm, drawing you inside before you even realise what happened.

It’s vanilla upon vanilla, softened by delicate orchid and musk. Gourmand, but never aggressive or cloying. Sophisticated, comforting, and beautifully balanced - like a quiet luxury dessert. I was gifted this scent by a friend who found it 'too vanillic', but it's been a staple in my scent warderobe ever since.

 

Dama Bianca - Xerjoff (casamorati)

One of my absolute favorites. A light, ethereal vanilla wrapped in soft florals and musk. The kumquat and lime add a gentle citrus sparkle, while the iris brings a powdery, elegant touch that I absolutely adore.

This scent feels fluffy, airy, and delicate, yet somehow lasts much longer than you’d expect. Projection is soft, but it lingers beautifully on skin. Some compare it to Junoon Noir, I can’t confirm this as I haven't tried the latter.

 

Ani - Nishane

The spicy vanilla of dreams. This is vanilla surrounded by all its best friends, each contributing something meaningful to the composition. Ginger sparkles, bergamot brightens, green notes freshen, vanilla warms, sandalwood creams, patchouli mystifies, and cardamom and benzoin tie it all together with a spicy bow.

It’s not gourmand - this is a mature, complex, spicy vanilla that feels polished and versatile. It’s the cool kid on the ice hockey team who owns the rink but is actually a very nice guy with a golden heart, too. He's effortlessly impressive without trying too hard, and always there when you need him. Sheer winter perfection. (Important note: Ani X is not the same scent - don’t be fooled.)

 

Grand Soir - MFK

Pure opulence. Warm, ambery, rich, incredibly long-lasting and impossibly elegant. I fully agree with AnneLauren Fragrance — the entire cast of Bridgerton absolutely smells like this.

If this fragrance had a soundtrack, it would be Shostakovich’s Second Waltz. It’s grand, enveloping, magical, it's majestic. Yes, it’s expensive - but you get every cent’s worth. A masterpiece. 10/10, no notes.

 

Blanche Bête - Les liq. imag. (hey, I did nót major in French, cut me some slack here)

The queen of creamy, milky, lactonic fragrances. Soft white florals swirl with vanilla and musk, creating a dreamy, cloud-like scent with a muskier dry-down. There’s a subtle coconut nuance that adds to the creaminess.

This is extremely divisive. People either fall head over heels, recoil in horror, or enjoy hating it. Absolutely not a safe blind buy - but unforgettable either way.

 

Vanilla 28 - Kayali

A staple for a reason. Warm, boozy, and reminiscent of caramelising brown sugar. Deep, comforting vanilla with ambery and woody undertones.

It shines as a layering fragrance, but also holds its own beautifully. Some call it boring - I call it reliable, balanced, and endlessly wearable. Sometimes you don’t need fireworks; you need consistency.

 

Fire At Will – Jovoy

A staple in my vanilla collection. A soft, ethereal vanilla with a subtle mimosa flower note. It smells like gentle, sweet vanilla ice cream, made special by faint yellow florals that keep it from feeling flat.

Projection is soft, but longevity is better than expected. This is an easy, cozy gourmand that doesn’t scream for attention. If this fragrance were a person, she’d be shy - but quietly unforgettable. Also excellent value for money.

 

Khamrah - Lattaffa

A spicy, warm, unapologetically festive fragrance filled with apples, dates, cinnamon, caramel and pastry-like sweetness. It smells like the best dessert table at Christmas.

It leans more spicy than vanilla, but it absolutely belongs here. Some people say it smells like a Yankee Candle - interpret that however you wish. Personally, I find it comforting, joyful, and perfectly seasonal.

 

Hypnotic Poison - Dior

An almond-heavy vanilla powerhouse. Loud, sexy, and completely unapologetic. This fragrance projects like crazy and refuses to be ignored. If you don’t step aside, she will push you over. Royal behaviour only.

 

Shalimar - Guerlain

The legend herself. A sophisticated, complex, balsamic vanilla with sparkling citrus, smoky undertones, and a powdery dry-down. Not a safe blind buy - but undeniably a masterpiece.

Vintage glamour, old Hollywood, dusty bookshelves, leather chairs, deep conversations, and a hint of skank. Complex, intoxicating, and endlessly fascinating. It’s not just a perfume - it’s history. (Still haven’t tried L’Essence… yet. Should I?)

 

Mon Guerlain - (yeah, guess who.. 🙄)

A beautifully blended lavender vanilla that feels calming, cozy and elegant. Comforting without being boring, and versatile enough for almost any occasion. It's lavender heaven, softened by vanilla, bergamot and tonka. Smells like peace, confidence, and freshly ironed cotton shirts.

 

Un Bois Vanille – Serge Lutens

Dark, smoky, smooth, autumnal vanilla perfection. Creamy sandalwood, syrupy honey, warm tonka and subtle spice create a rich, woody vanilla with depth and mystery.

Imagine standing in front of a fireplace in an old library, candles flickering, rain outside, books everywhere. This is dark academia vanilla at its finest. Wear with a jumper, a scarf, and a copy of The Secret History.

 

Vanilla Antique - Byredo

Still riding the dark academia wave - and not short on cash? This one’s for you. It smells like an old, refined library filled with aged paper, parchment, balsamic woods and antique furniture.

Spicy plum opens the scent before melting into a warm, seductive vanilla supported by amber and sandalwood. Some find it medicinal; others find it intoxicating. The price is hefty, but longevity is excellent. Whether it’s worth it… that’s between you and your wallet.

 

By the Fireplace - MM

A name that tells no lies. This is one of the most photorealistic smoky fragrances out there - burning wood balanced perfectly by sweet vanilla.

If you hate smoke, skip it. Otherwise, grab a blanket, your cosiest wool cardigan, and embrace the holiday spirit. “Chestnuts roasting on an open fire” was absolutely playing during its creation.

 

Jazz Club - MM

Same house, different fantasy. You’re no longer by the fire - you’re in the sexiest jazz club in town. Perfect outfit, smooth rum in hand, warm lighting, jazz humming softly in the background.

Spiced rum, tobacco and vanilla make this a seductive nighttime winter scent. Longevity varies, so sampling is wise - but the vibe? Impeccable.

 

Goddess - Burberry

A smooth, powdery vanilla with a beautiful lavender note. Soft, calming, and quietly feminine. Silently climed to the top of the best sold perfume lists after it's debute, and for a good reason. It's not too sweet, not cloying - just gentle, comforting and versatile. Mass-appealing done right. Easy reach, versatile, perfect whole year round. Vanilla top, vanilla heart, vanilla base - yet perfect if you want vanilla without the sugar overload. Excellent for colder weather.

 

Angels’ Share - Kilian

The OG. Cognac, cinnamon and vanilla in perfect harmony. Rich, opulent, and fully aware of its superiority.

Do not sample unless you are emotionally and financially prepared. Just like wedding dresses outside of your budget, some things are dangerous to try “just for fun.”

 

Oajan - PDM

Angels’ Share with the cinnamon cranked up to eleven. Apple pie on steroids. Warm, boozy, sweet, and intoxicating. Yes, you will smell like someone just pulled dessert out of the oven. Yes, people will want to stand closer to you. Perfect for date nights - unless your date is allergic to apples.

 

Spicebomb Extreme - Viktor & Rolf

A winter staple featuring vanilla, tobacco, cinnamon and whisky. Sexy, seductive, and surprisingly smoother than the original despite the intimidating name. Cold-weather approved and dangerously easy to like.

 

Babycat - YSL

A dark, spicy, leathery vanilla with serious attitude. Smoky, resinous, incense-heavy and unapologetically edgy.

This is the cool Parisian woman in a leather jacket who somehow manages to look elegant and intimidating at the same time. Not for the faint-hearted.

 

Black Opium Le Parfum - YSL

Vanilla with a bold, spicy twist. Coffee and vanilla collide to create a dark, edgy, addictive scent that knows exactly what it’s doing.

 

Commodity Gold

A smooth, creamy vanilla that’s sweet but controlled. Soft woods in the background give it a comforting, wearable edge. Easy, cozy, and crowd-pleasing.

 

Vanilla Skin – Phlur

Hands down the best value-for-money vanilla out there. Yes, it’s a body mist - but it punches way above its weight and gives many vanilla scents out there which cost double (triple, tenfold) as much a run for their money.

For the price, it has no business being this good. Gourmand lovers on a budget: do not walk. Run.

 

Vanilla Vibes - JHAG

The beachy summer vanilla. Salty, coconutty, sun-warmed and carefree. If you need a go-to summer holiday vanilla that smells like tan lines, ocean air and zero responsibilities - this is your girl.

 

Alien Goddess - Mugler

So.. You’ve spent the day at the beach with vanilla vibes, showered, and now you’re heading to a tropical beach bar. This is were Alien Goddess shines. Creamy white florals, coconut, vanilla, and pure summer energy. Is it August yet?

 

Vanilla Powder - Matière Première

A powdery, musky vanilla with heliotrope and a touch of coconut. Pretty, soft, and exactly what the name suggests. Lovely - but at that price point, my expectations were higher. My wallet remains unconvinced.

So, there you have it.

Sending you lots of love, light, warmth, and an entirely unreasonable amount of vanilla for the holidays ahead.

I (37/M) work in a theatre and I regularly stop through a train station on the way to work to pick up a coffee. One morning the barista, a sweet and seemingly friendly woman, asked me what the thing around my neck was. I told her it was a head torch so I can read my notes backstage. She then started asking me what I do, what show I’m working on and the conversation flowed. Luckily there was no one behind me in the queue. I paid and left thinking that she was a great barista because she was so lovely.

A week later I went to get my morning coffee and saw her from across the station, thought to myself “is that the woman who served me last week? Hm, maybe”. I got to the counter and the first thing she said was “[show] at the [theatre]! How’s the show going?” I was taken aback because I was surprised she remembered me, the train station is a busy city station that sees thousands of commuters a day. We chatted for a bit until I said “I better let you go cause there’s a queue forming” and pointed behind me. I went to collect my coffee and she carried on chatting to me, over her colleague and not really paying much attention to her line of customers. I noticed she wasn’t really chatting to the other customers much at all when I was there. I explained that I was gunning for a job at another theatre in the West End, so I might have to move. She said “my sister works in the film industry! She’d be able to help you find a place to live… you know, even though she doesn’t know you…” and seemed a little flustered. I was entertained by this and thanked her and left. While walking away I got a notification on my phone seeing how much the coffee was and realised I’d paid less than I should. I assumed she must have charged me for a small but served me a regular.

Later the same day I decided to go back for another coffee, but I was more interested in seeing if she was still there. She was. I asked her name, and she asked mine. Then we had a little conversation about where she lived, how she might have to move, where she was from, where her parents live and their nationalities. It was a lot to take in after I’d only intended to ask her name. She was very smiley and when I went to pay I saw it was the normal price. Before I could tap my phone, she said “oh wait no! Here you go” and she’d put in a 20% discount. I realised she’d given me discounts all three times I’d seen her.

A few days later I went to get my morning coffee and there were two blokes at the counter. When I walked up the guy said “[name] at the [theatre]?” I laughed and said “does everyone know me?”. He replied “I was behind the counter the other day, trying not to say or do anything when you and [woman] were talking”. I laughed again and said I was thinking of leaving her my number. He said “oh I’ll have to ask her when I next see her”. He then gave me a 10% discount, and I left. That discount and his last comment made me go from “yeah I reckon she fancies me” to “maybe they’re all just really great staff”.

I was thinking of giving her my number, asking for hers. Do you think I would be wasting my time and she is just an overly friendly barista, or does it actually sound like she’s interested?

1pr0a7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/1pr0a7h/titanium_pot_designed_for_loose_leaf_tea/,Titanium Pot Designed for Loose Leaf Tea,"It feels like there are a thousand specialized products for coffee in the backcountry, but there are next to none for tea. To some degree that makes sense because tea is very simple. You soak leaves in water, and you take them out when they’re ready. However, I think there is a hole in the market around this, because I always have to use a non-dedicated system that could be much better for backcountry tea.

For a long time I’ve used some mix of options like a Snow Peak 450 or a Toaks 650 pot with a tea basket such as the Finum Floating Basket M or the Fenshine Tea Infuser that I leave inside the pot. These options are some of the best, because a basket is the best way to make loose leaf tea for my use case. However, while it works well, there are some annoying issues with it- it is always banging around in my pot.

The best alternative option is brewing it with the leaves loose in the pot, but then you end up drinking leaves. Other methods are also not ideal- the ones with little chains have the chains bang around, the tabs are annoying to deal with, and so on.

I would love it if a company would make a dedicated ultralight titanium pot for people who like to drink loose leaf tea. My ideal pot would have a lid that would fit with a bayonet connection to a fine mesh titanium basket that would never touch any of the actual pot, bang around, or otherwise be annoying.

The size of the basket would probably be somewhere in the range of 1.9- 2 inches wide, 2-2.5 inches tall, and potentially have walls that expand as they go up slightly like most tea baskets on the market. A company could play around with the dimensions. It would probably look a bit like the Lixada Titanium Mesh Tea Infuser Basket. The mesh would also need to be fine enough not to allow a ton of particles into the tea. You could also connect with threads, but a bayonet connection may be easier to use, easier to manufacture, and more durable. A bayonet connection became standard for cameras for a reason, though with this there would ideally be no moving parts.

Weight wise, the Finum Floating Basket M is about .83 oz and made of steel and plastic, while the titanium Lixada Basket is about the same. I think done right it would only add a little under an ounce compared to a basic titanium pot.

A lid that was designed to connect to a tea basket like this would be the best design for people who like tea. It would do a few critical things than anything else:

·       Zero rattle/abrasion (with a rigid connection to the lid).

·       Drip-tray functionality when inverted.

·       Quick, burn-safe assembly/removal as a lid-basket unit.

·       Minimal weight addition.

I would add that to something like an Evolved Supply Co 750 Pot with the tight-fitting lid and pour spout, but without the bail (it could also be made in a 450ml version for a dedicated mug). It would be a versatile size, not annoying, and make a great cup in the morning with an integrated system. Please, someone make this. Would anyone other than me buy this? Would there be a market for it on something like Garage Grown Gear?",2,1766189263.0,Ultralight,16,0.63,False

For context, I'm 22 but look 30. I have a thick beard and an angry looking face (or so I'm told). My skin isn't the best either. People usually assume I'm in my 30s, and the father of my 13 year old sister.

I'm in my final year of university and looking for graduate jobs. I landed an assessment centre in one of the biggest firms in the industry a few weeks ago. For those who don't know, an assessment centre is usually the final stage in the graduate job process. They consist of an interview, a group task with other candidates, and some unassessed activities like a Q&A.

On the day, there were supposed to be around 100 candidates and 30 interviewers present. When I arrived, one of the volunteers present asked me if I was here for the interviews, I said yup! They took me upstairs into a room with around 20 people inside. I said, ""wow, I thought I was late."" And the volunteer just nodded and left.

I noticed how every candidate looked much older. Everyone was easily 30+ years old, some looked 50. I felt very intimidated. It was my first AC for a large firm, and I thought that perhaps all these candidates were masters, or PhD students and I had to compete with more experience individuals for the role. And no one was talking either. In my other AC, everyone was talking together. Half of these individuals were by themselves, sipping on coffee, and looking at some papers and it made me feel very intimidated.

I approached a group that were talking, and joined in. We talked about the industry for a little while, and the group were surprisingly very knowledgeable. Their insights were so strong, and they knew a lot about the company. Initiate imposter syndrome. I tried keeping up, but they could likely see right through my façade, and at one point I was just nodding and agreeing because I didn't understand anything. I wanted to cry.

I excused myself and approached another, smaller group. This time, they asked me for my role. Role? ""Oh, they want to know what I applied for"", I thought (they interview for multiple lines together) and said technology risk. They asked how long I'd been with the firm, and I said, ""so far, 15 minutes,"" thinking I was being coy, but they just gave me a weird look. Tough crowd, I thought. I asked what role they applied for.

I got a couple answers. Then one of the older looking ladies looked at me and said, ""you're not an interviewer, are you?"" - ""Interviewer?"" I asked, questioningly. ""No. I'm here to get *interviewed*. Wait, are you an interviewer?"" - ""We all are,"" she replied. The fuck. I was so confused. She laughed it off, patted my shoulder, and said, ""I think you were brought to the wrong room. You're supposed to go to the room next door,"" and she took me there. (Thank god for this lady btw, she was the only woman who talked to me empathetically).

A room, filled to the brim with a hundred people that looked 5-10 years younger than me. Thank fuck. BTW, the lady who helped me out was a partner at the firm. Later, when I went in for my interview, my interviewer made a joke about how all the interviewers knew about me and found it hilarious. On the bright side, it was a great conversation starter and I had an impression to work with. I finally got to process how funny and absurd this was on my journey back home.

2. How tolerant are most people in regards to not speaking Swedish/ only speaking English? 
• For example, would people working at a grocery store or coffee shop be able to communicate with an American? I've tried learning Swedish for the past few months but it's DEFINITELY not strong enough to do anything productive. Skill issue, I know.

1pr04dr,https://www.reddit.com/r/deardiary/comments/1pr04dr/12192025_homesick/,12/19/2025 Homesick.,"Three trips.

Last month I went to the past.

A place from my past. It seemed almost blasphemous that the place still existed in space though no longer in time.

My hometown. I guess a little like the setting of a hallmark movie.

It reminded me of who I am. What I was constructed of. What I rebelled against and what I integrated into my matrix.

My husband was going to go too, but he wound up coming down with a cold and we couldn’t risk exposing my elderly step-grandmother. So, just my son and I went.

It was my first time doing a big road trip with just my son and me. …Actually it was my first time ever driving so far.  We stayed for two nights and it was my son’s first time ever staying a night away from his dad.

It was so nostalgic and sentimental driving around my hometown. It felt like being in a dream about the past.

Long, winding country road.

Uncanny. I’m used to being in the city. The road itself curved both up and down, and side to side in these long snaking arcs. My ears would pop from the changes in altitude.

And we were surrounded by pitch-black except for the reflective lines and markers on the road and the occasional traffic lights out in the middle of nowhere. It was almost like driving through outer space!

I didn’t sleep well at all. I felt nervous, being away from home and being the only adult to protect my son.

I felt very vigilant all through the night, like I could hear every little sound in the adjoining hotel rooms.

But my hometown was less foreign to me than where I am now.

This is my sister's and mother's home but I have no roots or connection here. 

I am homesick here.

The journey was long and turbulent. Our connecting flight was delayed by three hours. My son was a trooper. Someone in the airport approached us to compliment us both.

Told him that he was doing a great job being adaptable and helpful, and that I was doing a great job being a patient and accommodating parent.

It meant a lot to me.

My husband is in India.

I had no time to prepare for this trip. My son got sick right after my husband left for his trip. So my son had to come to work with me every day.

I am exhausted.

I am homesick. I don't think I like it here. I think...my sister did not know that i hate Christmas. I hate Christmas. I hate the sight of Christmas decorations. I tend to have a panic attack every year on Christmas.

My sister, trying to dig up what little magic there was in our childhood, and wash it of all the dung it was coated in and forge a better version of it in the fires of nostalgia, had turned my living quarters into an explosion of Christmas festivity.

My normal Christmas strategy is to fly to a country where it isn't as widely celebrated.

But I simply couldn't make that journey this year.

But this town, this state, is alien to me. Much more foreign to me than my husband's country.

This place is cold and unforgiving. And imposing mountains loom everywhere in the distance, boxing us in on all sides.

I miss my home in the present. With the vibrance of the city skyline greeting every distant gaze. The ever present heat of the heartbeat of the city ever thrumming with human life.

There are no neighbors here. The night is pitch black and endless, the beam of my cellphone's flashlight cannot even cut through it, it bleeds away into nothingness.

There are no sounds of neighbors upstairs or downstairs or to the side.

I'm sure there is life here. My instincts tell me to be wary that it may be the sort of life that perceives me and my offspring as prey. And that I have no safety in numbers here.

Cannot rely on the inherent goodness of the vast majority of my species. Anyone out there is a lone and rogue agent, with no predictability.

Anyone out there may well be a grizzly or a mountain lion.

Everything feels very difficult. Not in my own home, things do not work the way I expect. Even the logistics of hygiene and sleep and making coffee and daily routine are a challenge.

My sister had done such a commendable job. Filling up this space with things for me and my son. Like offerings, like tokens of friendship and closeness, like well wishes, she has stuffed the place with well-wishes.

But now the place is so cluttered and there's no room for our own things that we packed.

I am homesick.

I am alone. My sister has left my son and I to our own devices, out in the

middle of nowhere. She has put in so much effort, I know I should not complain.

But I feel alone and unhosted. I don't know how to drive here. I don't know what to do here.

When I return to my city, I will feel whole again, I think.

Pre-COVID I made a batch of soap with tallow, some sort of vegetable oil, lye, and dehumidifier water (which is, in a sense, distilled ... with added dust) and *nothing else.* Heated it until it was self-bubbling and smashed it into generic bricks when it was sort of mash-potatoe-y. It hardened, formed its usual layer of sodium carbonate as a bit of lye reacted with carbon dioxide in the air, and I set it aside for use when the then-in-use batch was exhausted. Mostly just wanted my tallow stock in the freeze gone; make brisket not on the grill but in the over and the tallow piles up. Then, between divorce and offspring's deciding to use only the right-scented body wash (and me picking up the 'slack'), *then* COVID, that in-use-batch lasted until two months ago, and, you know, it was perfectly normal soap and the last bar that's perhaps 7, 8 years old is still in the shower, gradually shrinking. 

I avoid superfatting my soaps so there's a fine line between a slight excess of NaOH and fats. 

The batch I'm describing was untouched, unopened, unseen in coffee canisters since setting up and curing for a couple of weeks in 2019, maybe 2018, possibly 2017. Containers were *not* airtight, just old plastic coffee containers. Otherwise, barely moved and unabused. 

Today I decided to make the bar soap from that batch back to liquid soap since I'm running low on hand-me-down body wash and remembered making liquid soap with my father from bar remnants when I was maybe 6, 7 back mid '60s .... Opened up the containers with the batch in question and found mostly soap dust. Some bars are completely crumbled, apart from a darker layer on top; some are partly crumbled, something (I assume glycerine) forming beads on the dark uncrumbled layer. Those holding part of their shape just crumble, even the most solid parts (apart from a kind of 1/4""-thick crust) just fall apart under a gentle squeeze. What's crumbled is powdery. Think texture of laundry detergent. 

I mean, soap chemistry isn't a killer. Fatty acid + base kind of stuff. Even the white crust, sodium carbonate ... Sodium carbonate had a common name, ""washing soda."" It's visually unpleasant, but it's old fashioned laundry detergent and you can still buy it. 

Any ideas? Did I add much lye so that sodium-carbonate-ification continued to wreck the soap, forming lots of little lumps of soap? Surely it wasn't too *over*\-saponified, that would produce an oily mess. No insect bodies, so it's not like the my 10-year-old kid's gingerbread house I found when he was 19 and at college that was made dust by some sort of beetle babies.

Started making soap, same primitive recipe--functional, completely not crafts-y, intended to simply not waste beef fat--in '95. It's the first batch ever to crumble like this and I figure it's progressive so didn't just start 1-2 years ago, but would have been visible within a year. 

I'm stumped. But intensely curious. 

I've still put it to re-liquify ... if it's over-hydroxylated I can re-batch it with more fat. If it's just sodium carbonate, well, not a good body wash but I'll find a use, I don't have the means to separate the carbonate from the soap. If it's just ""You processed it wrong so of course it crumbled"" because it's all mechanical, the little soap particles didn't stick together right, then it'll be okay liquid soap.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

This may be  the last story I can tell you guys……but it’s  a long one so I hope it satisfies.



The phone rang at midnight.



I'd expected it, I can not sleep anyways exactly three years ago today, I signed a contract in that cold, impersonal office.



This job became routine around the eighteenth month. I was now familiar with its rhythm and pattern. I understood that the universe held far more rooms than I knew, and some of them needed nurturing.



I was awakened by the sound and instinctively reached for my phone on the bedside table. The screen's dim light illuminated my small bedroom. The walls were still covered with my sticky notes, but the content had changed over time. No longer ""Check the manual,"" but ""Pick up Levi at 3 PM.""



The phone screen displayed only two words: ""Final Delivery.""



No address. No time. No customer name. I glanced at the manual; there wasn't even a rule.



I slowly sat up, my body accustomed to the rhythm of nighttime deliveries, while my brain was still processing this strange notification.biscuit, perked up from the foot of the bed, its ears twitching. In the three years since the garden incident, its aging pattern was completely different from that of ordinary dogs; in other words, it hadn't aged at all. Its muzzle was still golden, its eyes still bright, and its body still strong and healthy. Some gifts from another world possess a magic of preservation.



I picked up my pocket watch from the bedside table. Tonight, it presented a new image: a vast sea of ​​sand, the sky an odd color，neither blue nor gray, but somewhere in between, like a faded old photograph. In the distance, bathed in the heat, a large, curved object, like ribs, could be vaguely seen emerging from the dunes.



I gazed at this image for a long time, my thumb gently stroking the edge of the watch case.



I heard footsteps in the hallway outside the apartment. Light and hurried, like the scratching of Levi's paws on the hardwood floor when he was excited or anxious.After these years some time in midnight  he will come alone to see me in the midnights.Strictly speaking, this counts as running away from home, so my colleagues always wanted to keep a closer eye on him. But as the old saying goes, you can't keep a shapeshifter locked up.



""Dad?"" His voice came from outside the door, young, yet more composed than when I first brought him home.



“Come in, Levi.”



The door opened slowly, and he entered in human form, or at least mostly. Over the years, he had become increasingly adept at maintaining his human form, and more discerning about which parts should be exposed and which should be concealed. But tonight, his tail was exposed, bushy and fox-like, twitching nervously. His eyes gleamed with the light that only appeared when his other side approached, a faint green hue in the dim light.



He was twelve years old if we really count, and had learned to reliably maintain his human form. We took him to parks, museums, and ordinary places on weekends, which taught him how to blend into crowds, how to act like a human child, and how to modulate his voice so it didn't carry that slight growl. But there was always something different about him, drawing wary glances from other parents and keeping other children at a distance. He had learned to coexist with it, accepting his state somewhere between human and otherworldly.



“Dad?” he asked, standing in the doorway, one hand on the frame. “Has it been three years?”



I nodded slowly. “It seems so.”



He entered the room and sat on the edge of my bed. Biscat immediately snuggled up to him, offering the solid comfort honed over centuries by dogs. Levi's hand unconsciously stroked Biscat's fur, his fingers entwining in the golden hide, seeking solace in the familiar touch.



“Are you staying, or leaving after that?”



This was a question I'd avoided for months. Every deliveryman had to make a choice at the end of their three-year term: leave with money and memories, or stay and become something else, perhaps an eternal presence.



“I haven't decided yet,” I said honestly. “Let's see what the last order is.”



We were silent for a moment. The three of us—man, dog, and shapeshifter—were crammed into the small bedroom, the city clamor outside at three in the morning. In the distance came sirens, the rumble of trucks in the dead of night, and the faint sounds of eight million people sleeping, waking, or living in the darkness.



Three minutes later, a knock came precisely on time, as if the visitor had been waiting in the hallway, counting down the seconds.



Before the door opened, I knew who it was.



Marcus stood in the hallway, but he looked different. He was no longer dressed as the warehouse manager; instead, he wore travel attire that seemed to belong to some distant era: worn, soft leather trousers, an undyed, rough linen shirt, a knee-length wool coat, patched and worn, and boots that looked like they'd been through countless roads. His eyes, usually hidden behind his ever-present Cheshire Cat smile, were now serious and focused, revealing a weariness never before seen on his face.



“Eric,” he said formally, his tone unusually heavy. “Your contract is up. Now, you’re receiving final delivery.”



“What is the final delivery?”



He entered without permission, and I noticed a leather satchel slung over his shoulder. It was old, older than anything he wore, and looked much heavier than its actual size. It tugged at his shoulder, its weight unusual, as if the bag contained something heavier than ordinary matter.



“Something most deliverymen have never seen,” Marcus said, placing the bag on my kitchen table with a dull thud, like distant thunder, like a bone settling back to the ground. “Most people spend three years doing the same routine: apartment buildings, cemeteries, and if they’re unlucky, maybe some particularly awful subway station. They make a choice, and move on, either back to normal life or getting promoted to management. But you…” He turned to face me. “You’ve been chosen to do something far rarer. Famine needs you.”



“Why does it need me?”



“War, famine, plague, death. The anchor of this world. The ancient forces that maintain the boundary between existence and non-existence.” He gestured to the bag. “They need renewal. About every sixty years, with a possible ten-year margin of error, they must self-destruct and then be reborn. The ouroboros cycle. Someone has to send them to a place of renewal.”



These words seemed to echo in the cramped apartment, emitting a tooth-ache-inducing, blurring-sight frequency. The air thinned, as if something had inhaled but not exhaled. The light flickered, then flickered again.



“And what did I send?”



“Famine itself.”



The word spread like ripples on still water. I felt a churning in my stomach, a sense of emptiness welling up inside me, as if the word itself created an emptiness that had never existed before.



Levi whimpered softly, and Biscuit snuggled closer to him.



“Why me?” I managed to ask.



Marcus pulled out a chair and sat down, gesturing for me to sit as well. Levi remained lying on the bed, silent but focused, his tail tightly wrapped around Biscuit, as if protecting it.



“Because of your bloodline,” Marcus said. “The Dorman family has always been messengers, Eric. Your great-grandfather delivered plague in 1929, at the beginning of the Great Depression. Your great-great-grandmother delivered war in 1871, during Reconstruction. And your father…” He paused. “Your father was supposed to deliver famine relief in 1985. But he ran away. Before the final delivery was confirmed, but… he strongly resisted, so we had to find someone else.”



I sat down heavily, my legs suddenly going weak. “Waiting for what?”



“This time the cycle is short and we believe it is waiting for you.” Marcus leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table. “Eric, these four timelines don’t follow a human rhythm. Sixty, seventy, ninety years—these are just suggestions, not hard and fast rules. They’re flexible in some ways, and irrelevant in others. I don’t know why, but I think Famine is waiting for Roy Dorman to have a son. Waiting for his son to join the company, waiting for him to prove himself worthy of this responsibility.”



I thought of my father in his small apartment, the walls plastered with…



“He knew it would happen,” I said softly.



“He sensed it.” Marcus smiled, but the smile was filled with sadness and pity. “But Eric, I think you can’t just let this delivery go. Someone in your blood will eventually lead Famine to revival. The only question is, is that person you, or your descendant?”



The apartment was quiet. I could hear the hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen, the dripping of the bathroom faucet I’d been trying to fix, and Levi’s rapid, shallow breathing.



“What should I do?”



Marcus stood up, walked to the window, and looked at the city lights outside. “To the Land of Revival. It lies deep in the desert, beyond the roads, beyond the maps, beyond those named places. The journey will take about two weeks. I will accompany you, as your guide. You will carry Famine.” He tapped his satchel lightly. “In the Land of Revival, you will release it. It will self-destruct, and in the process, it will destroy you.”



“Will it kill me?”



“It will completely devour you.” According to human calculations, you will exist in the cycle of Famine for about three minutes. What happens within those three minutes will determine everything. Some messengers will change, some will break, and some will never appear at all.



“What if I survive?”



Marcus turned to face me, and for the first time since I had known him, he seemed so hesitant. His usual confidence, his unwavering certainty of seven hundred years, now flickered like a candle flame in the wind. “If you survive, you’ll understand why I’ve persisted for seven hundred and forty-three years. You’ll understand the choices I made, whether they were wise, cowardly, or whatever. And you, having fully understood their significance, will make your own choices.”



Levi lifted his head from the bed, his voice soft and tense. “Does he have to go alone?”



“No,” Marcus said, his expression softening. “The escort can bring companions, if they wish.” The journey is dangerous, but no more dangerous than many of the previous delivery missions. In some ways, even safer. The desert’s hostility is undisguised; it never conceals its true nature.



“I’m coming,” Levi said, standing immediately, his tail swishing sharply, his tone resolute. “I’m going with you.”



“Levi—”



“I’m coming.” His voice was firm, carrying an adult confidence, yet his youthful face couldn’t fully bear that confidence. “You took me in. You taught me how to blend in like a human, and how to survive like an outsider. You are my family. Wherever you go, I will go.”



Biscuit stood up and barked, its voice sharp and clear. Its meaning was obvious, evident in its hunched shoulders and perked ears.



Marcus nodded slowly. “It’s settled then. Set off at sunrise. Take water, salt, and bread, nothing else. The desert provides everything it has, and what it doesn’t provide, you don’t need.”



“How do we get there? That deep desert. That nameless place.”



“Like any place we go that doesn’t belong to this world.” Marcus walked toward the door. “We’ll ride horses.” He pulled a business card from his pocket and placed it on the table next to his bag. “Meet me at this address. Sunrise. Don’t be late. Famine won’t wait patiently, even if it has waited for decades.”



He left, and the apartment seemed much larger because of his departure, as if he occupied a space much larger than his actual size. The air seemed thinner, easier to breathe.



I looked at the business card. It was an address on the outskirts of the city, on an industrial wasteland where a highway met an abandoned railway. A place I had never been, and had never needed to be.



“Dad?” Levi climbed off the bed and stood beside me, his tail still sticking out, his eyes filled with worry and childlike innocence. “Are you scared?”



I thought about it carefully. Three years ago, my answer would definitely have been “yes,” absolutely, terrified out of my wits. But three years of delivering goods had changed my understanding of fear. I understood that the universe was stranger than I had imagined, but also more logical. It had its own rules, even those not familiar to me from childhood. With caution, with careful observation, with following instructions, one could navigate it.



“No,” I said slowly, “I don’t think I’m scared. Should I be?”



“I don’t know. But I’m scared for you.”



I placed my hand on his shoulder, feeling the subtle changes in his muscles; his joints were slightly different from humans. “It’s alright. You can be afraid for both of us.” “I’ll try my best to come back alive.”



He leaned against me, his tail wrapped around my legs, a gesture of trust and affection that always moved me deeply. “You promise you’ll come back?”



“I promise I’ll do everything in my power.”



That was the most sincere answer I could give. In this job, any promise was a lie, and I had learned not to lie to those who trusted me.



We spent the rest of the time packing. The water in the bottle might never run out. The bread kept fresh longer than normal bread. Salt in leather bags. These seemingly simple things had to cope with a complex journey.



The address pointed to a stable that shouldn’t exist, a building made of old wood and even older stone, standing alone amidst broken concrete and rusty industrial equipment. The dawn painted everything gold and red, the colors of end and beginning, a symbol of death and rebirth.



The building looked incredibly old, much older than the surrounding abandoned factories and warehouses. The wood, etched black by time, was almost black; the stones, smoothed by wind and rain, were grazed smooth. There were no signs, no indications of what this place was, or the meaning of its existence. It simply stood there silently, as if it had always existed, and would always exist.



Marcus waited outside, four horses tethered to a post inscribed with symbols I couldn't decipher, symbols that seemed to change when I looked at them. Three of them were the patient, robust horses I'd seen before when transporting goods, those mares familiar with the impossible, who moved without hesitation between different worlds. They were all ordinary in appearance, brown and gray, with calm eyes and steady postures.



The fourth horse was entirely different.



It was pure black, without a single shade. Not dark brown, not dark gray, just black. As it moved, the darkness moved with it, as if the horse itself carried a lack of light, a small patch of shadow. Its eyes were wise and ancient, far beyond the age of any animal's eyes. When it looked at me, I felt a resonance that transcended sight. It saw more than just my body; it saw something deeper, something more essential.



“This is your horse,” Marcus said, pointing to the black horse. “Its name is Hiatus. It carried other messengers on their final deliveries. Now, it will carry you.”



I approached slowly, cautiously extending my hand. Hiatus lowered its head, its nostrils flaring, sniffing my breath. Its breath was warm and strong, carrying the scent of cinnamon and ashes, spices and burning, and something that shouldn't be the breath of a horse. I stroked its neck; its fur was hot, pressed against my hand.The handcuffs almost made me uncomfortable, but not painful. The feeling was just right, almost unbearable.



“Hello, Hiatus.”



He neighed softly, the sound echoing in my chest like a drumbeat, like the bass of some enormous instrument. I felt my ribs, spine, even the back of my teeth vibrate.



Levi had already claimed a mare, a gray horse, seemingly unconcerned about his unpredictable nature. The mare stood calmly as Levi checked the saddle; his movements were still somewhat unnatural, but the horse didn't seem to mind. She had carried things even stranger than shapeshifters.



Biscuit sat obediently beside the fourth horse, a brown mare with gentle eyes. It waited for Marcus to lift it into its specially made saddlebag. Biscuit settled comfortably, its head peeking out, ready to depart.



Marcus handed me a heavy leather satchel, a gesture carrying profound significance. “This is famine. Don’t open it. Don’t look inside. Don’t try to communicate with what’s inside. Just take it. When we reach the Land of Restoration, you’ll naturally know what to do. That feeling will come naturally.”



The satchel was much heavier than I’d felt in the apartment, a heaviness that wasn’t entirely physical. It had weight, yes, but also an indescribable density. Like holding a collapsed star, something crammed too much into a small space. The backpack vibrated slightly in my hands, rhythmic like breathing or a heartbeat. When I slung it over my shoulder, I felt something deep inside respond, an emptiness, as if my stomach had suddenly realized it was empty, and would always be empty, never to be filled no matter how much I ate.



“Hunger,” Marcus said, observing my expression closely, “is the presence of famine. It will grow stronger as we go. These past few weeks, no matter how much you eat, it will feel like months without food. That’s normal. This hunger isn’t a craving for food, but a craving for existence. It’s a craving for emptiness itself, a craving to be filled but never being filled.”



“That’s really comforting,” I said, adjusting my shoulder straps.



Marcus skillfully mounted his horse, his movements effortless, as if he’d been doing this for centuries. “We’ll head north, then west, and finally south into the depths of the desert. By conventional measurement, it’s about five hundred miles, but once we leave the world as depicted on a map, distance takes on a completely different meaning. Numbers no longer matter. Stay close to us. Don’t stray from the route. Once we set off, don’t look back at the cities. Looking back becomes an anchor point, and where we’re going, anchor points are dangerous.” I carefully mounted Hiatus, feeling the warmth of his body through the saddle and the power hidden in his muscles. He shifted down slightly, adjusting to my weight. I had a feeling he was sizing me up, judging whether I was worthy of his carrying.



“Ready?” Marcus asked, his gaze sweeping over each of us in turn.



“Not yet,” I answered honestly. “But let’s go anyway.” ""

The sun had just risen when we set off—four riders, a dog, hungry, heading towards an unnamed place.



The city slowly disappeared behind us. I didn't look back. My gaze remained fixed ahead, on Hiatus's black ears, on the road ahead.



For the first few hours, we rode along familiar roads. The suburban houses were all identical, the lawns neatly trimmed. Nail salons, pizzerias, and dollar stores lined the streets. At gas stations, early morning commuters filled up their tanks and bought coffee from paper cups. This was typical of American urban sprawl, the infrastructure of daily life.



But as  the sun rose higher, everything began to change.



The distance between buildings began to lengthen, gaps appearing between them. Then, these gaps widened. The details of the houses became blurred, their features bland, becoming monotonous, more like symbols of houses than real homes. The commercial streets along the way also looked less authentic, like movie sets shot from the wrong angle.



By midday, we rode through an area that was no longer entirely real.



The ground beneath our hooves was hard earth, the color of old bones, dry and cracked. The sky was blue, but this blue seemed faded, as if it had been exposed to the sun for too long, the color cracking... The darkness began to recede. There were no landmarks, no features, no signs of human presence, not even a trace of human existence. No power lines. No fences, no roads, only an endless expanse of flat land, empty and desolate.



We rode in silence. The only sounds were the rhythmic clatter of hooves on the hard earth, the creaking of leather saddles, and the occasional clanging of harnesses. Even the wind was still, almost a whisper, without a scent, without stirring a speck of dust.



The hunger grew stronger.



At first it was just a slight discomfort, easily overlooked. But by the evening of the first day… This feeling, however, grew stronger. A gnawing emptiness, unrelated to my stomach. I ate dinner—the bread and jerky Marcus had prepared—but the food did nothing to alleviate my hunger. It was like pouring water into a bottomless pit. The food did reach somewhere, sustaining my bodily functions, but the emptiness remained.



That night, we camped in an open area, with no shelter, nor did we need any. The air was neither hot nor cold, just peaceful, simply existing. We didn't light a fire, because there was nothing to burn. We simply spread out our sleeping bags and fell asleep peacefully under the star-studded night sky, the stars a different color, forming constellations I couldn't recognize.



""Dad?"" Levi's voice came from the darkness beside me. Seeking comfort, he had transformed back into his canine form, curled up beside the biscuit, the two dogs huddled together for warmth, even though warmth wasn't needed at night.



""Hmm?""



""How long will we go hungry?""



""Marcus said two weeks.""



""Two weeks is a long time."" ""Yes.""



""I don't like it.""



""Me neither.""



We were silent for a moment, then Levi said, ""But we'll get through this together, right?""



""Yes."" He quieted down, and soon I heard his breathing deepen as he drifted off to sleep. But I remained awake, staring at the starry sky I shouldn't have seen, my hunger growing stronger.



The next day was even harder.



The scenery before me became more abstract. The once bone-white earth was gradually replaced by something that was no longer earth; its texture was like compacted powder, fine and smooth, almost like ash. The sky's color faded even more, gradually changing from a faded blue to a near-gray, finally disappearing into nothingness.



Sometimes we could see shapes in the distance. They might be buildings, creatures, geological formations, or none of these. They swayed in the heat that shouldn't exist, because the temperature remained neutral, that peculiar, neither-hot-nor-cold temperature unique to this place. No matter how long we rode, those shapes remained forever out of reach. They were always on the horizon, unattainable, yet always present.



Hunger was ever-present, filling my chest, stomach, and throat. I ate lunch—more bread, some bland cheese. The food tasted like dust in my mouth. From that seemingly... He drinks from a seemingly inexhaustible jug, yet the water does nothing to quench his thirst. It merely flows through his body, sustaining his life, while his essence remains empty.



Levi now changes form more frequently; he cannot remain human for long. He can ride a horse in human form for an hour, then crawl on all fours beside it, whimpering softly. Then he will roll over again, forcing himself back into human form, struggling to maintain it. But hunger also affects him, making him uncontrollable, even forgetting what he was originally supposed to look like.



Only The biscuit seemed unchanged, still obediently in its saddlebag, still there, still silently keeping us company. But even it was quieter than usual, conserving its energy, vigilantly observing the surrounding scenery.



Marcus rode at the head of the group, steady and resolute; seven hundred years of experience had shielded him from the harshest aspects of the desert. But even he was quieter than usual; his signature Cheshire Cat smile had become a slight upturn at the corners of his mouth.



The next evening, we camped again in the desolate desert. I asked him, “Can things get any worse?”



“Much worse,” he said simply. “This is just the edge. We haven’t even reached the heart of the desert yet. You’ll know when we get there.”



“How worse??”



“The sand.” ""



On the third day, the sand arrived.



At first, the appearance of the sand was a gradual process. The initially ash-like powder gradually became coarser, with a stronger granular texture, until finally it became real sand. At first, the sand was scattered sparsely on the bone-white earth, like sprinkled sugar granules. Then, the sand piled up into small mounds, forcing the horses to detour. Finally, the sand formed dunes, undulating stretches before us.



Accompanying the sand was intense heat.



This heat arrived so swiftly, as if we had crossed an invisible boundary, entering another world. The previously pleasant temperature vanished..."" Instead, a fierce, fiery assault assaulted the area. The sky turned from gray to white, a ghastly white that stung to look at. The sun, which I rarely noticed in the ordinary world, now blazed like a scorching flame, a molten brass pan, pouring down heat as if it were liquid.



In less than an hour, I was drenched in sweat. My clothes clung to my body, stained with salt, and were very uncomfortable. Hiatus's black fur seemed to absorb the heat and reflect it back, but he showed no discomfort. He walked steadily forward, his hooves sinking slightly into the sand with each step.



Hunger became unbearable.



It was no longer just emptiness. It was a visceral pain, a churning torment in my stomach, as if something was trying to tear it out. I drank water incessantly, but it offered no relief. At midday, I tried to eat bread, but I couldn't swallow it. My throat felt blocked, refusing any food, even though my body craved nourishment.



Levi had now completely transformed into an animal, running on all fours beside the horse, his form appearing and disappearing, elusive and unpredictable, sometimes like a dog, sometimes a fox, sometimes a wolf, sometimes something else entirely—something unnameable. He had given up trying to maintain his human form. Hunger had stripped away all his pretense. That night, we camped in the shade of a sand dune, but for some reason, it offered no shade whatsoever. Even after sunset, the heat persisted, seemingly emanating from the sand itself, as if the desert had absorbed the daytime heat and then slowly released it into the night.



Marcus efficiently distributed our meager dinner as usual, but I noticed he barely ate. I realized he didn't need to eat. Whatever he would become seven hundred years from now, he had long since transcended ordinary hunger.



""How much further?"" I asked, my voice hoarse from thirst despite having drunk water all day.



""Not sure,That wasn't really an answer,"" he said.



That night, I dreamt of hunger. Not a craving for food, but a craving for meaning, for purpose, for satiety. In the dream, I opened my mouth and found a door, from which emerged an endless procession, each one emaciated, desperate and helpless, reaching for what I couldn't give. I tried to feed them, but my hands were empty. I tried to talk to them, but no sound came out. I could only watch helplessly as they walked past one after another, hunger and despair seemingly endless.



When I woke up, I found Levi curled up beside me, his tail wrapped around my wrist, his breathing rapid and shallow. Even in his sleep, he clung to me, seeking the comfort of closeness.



""Did you have a nightmare?"" “I asked softly.



He opened his eyes, which glowed faintly in the darkness—a side effect of his non-human nature. “A dream of hunger,” he whispered. “In the dream, I kept eating and eating and eating, but I still felt empty. Is this famine? Is this what it feels like?”



“I think so. I think this is famine.”



“It’s terrible.”



“Yes.”



“How do people endure this hunger? I…”



It was a good question, a compassionate one. “I don’t know, maybe humans are persistent.”



“You are human.”



“I am most of the time.”



“I think not now. After all this, perhaps you won’t be anymore.” ""He's become somewhat confused.



Perhaps he's right.



By the fourth day, the scene before me had become completely abstract, disconnected from any reality I could perceive.



The dunes were no longer just dunes. They had transformed into sculptural forms, mathematical curves, hinting at some kind of intelligence. They had formed after… Their undulations were almost natural in their regularity, almost random in their perfection. Spirals, spiral lines, fractal iterations—each dune was a variation on a theme, yet I could never fully comprehend it.



Heat transcended physical temperature, transforming into something—a quality of air, an inherent attribute of existence itself. It wasn't just that the air was hot. Heat had become the fundamental essence of this place, the basis from which all things arose.



We saw something.



In the distance, some buildings appeared, shimmering in the heat waves."" Swaying in the sand. Some buildings were too tall, too thin, too angular. Some towers spiraled upwards, reaching into the sky and disappearing in the dazzling light. Some walls stretched for miles, perfectly straight, defining the boundary between nothingness and nothingness. Some doorways stood alone in the dunes, like structures without frameworks, leading into empty spaces.



Sometimes, these structures were even living organisms.



On the fifth day, we passed a skull half-buried in a dune. It was enormous, a full twenty feet tall, with eye sockets large enough for me to stand inside. The bone was paper-white, clean and smooth, without a trace of flesh or cartilage. Whatever it had once been, it wasn't human, and I couldn't call it anything. Its jaw structure was off, with too many teeth, and the shape of its cranial cavity was unlike any brain structure I knew.



""What is that?"" “Levi asked softly. He had struggled to regain his human form that morning, though it had taken considerable effort. He pointed to the skull, his hands trembling slightly.



“Something very ancient,” Marcus said. “Something from before.”



“Before what?”



“Before the world decided what form humans wanted to take. Before the rules solidified, before physics and biology took shape.” He pointed to the skull as we rode past. This is what I mean by the deep, layered desert. Time, place, and all possibilities are compressed here. Many things perish here. Ancient things. The original things. Things that existed in an era when reality was still debatable—you can imagine your computer's recycle bin.



As we went on, more and more bones came into view. Ribs, like cathedral arches, large enough to pass underneath. Vertebrae the size of cars, scattered across the sand like abandoned sculptures. A jawbone stretched for a quarter of a mile, teeth worn smooth by gravel, wind, and time, each tooth as tall as a person.We walked silently through the ossuary, overwhelmed by its scale, its age, and the incredible sheer size of the creatures that had once lived and perished there.



Hunger was now unbearably intense, screaming incessantly in my nerves. I couldn't remember what it felt like not to be hungry. Food had become an abstract concept, something that happened to other people elsewhere. The bread we ate was tasteless, like cardboard, like dust. Water in my mouth felt like dust, meaningless, disappointing.



By the sixth day, Levi had completely abandoned his human form. He ran alongside the horses like a hybrid of half-dog, half-fox, half-wolf, and half-something else, his form fluid and blurred, as if he couldn't remember what he was supposed to be, or found a fixed form too tiring. His tail swayed between fox-like fluffiness and wolf-like thickness. His ears were sometimes pointed, sometimes rounded, sometimes bent backward. His legs would lengthen or shorten depending on the terrain.



He no longer spoke, but communicated with whimpers, barks, and body language. But I could still understand him. We developed a vocabulary of gestures and sounds that transcended language.



Biscuit stayed in his saddlebag, conserving his energy, patiently observing the surrounding scenery. He was the only one among us who seemed completely unchanged, though I noticed he had stopped eating altogether. He would drink water offered to him, but refused food. It was as if he understood that food was meaningless here, and hunger could not be satisfied in the conventional way.



On the sixth night, Marcus spoke first, his voice breaking the oppressive silence. Because we, at least I, were all somewhat afraid of nothingness.



“You once asked me if I was happy,” he said. We were sitting around another camp, without shelter, without comfort, just a place to stop and rest for a few hours. “Do you remember?”



I nodded.



“I think the last time I felt happy was many years ago. His name is Jacob."" My mouth was dry, but I sat down to rest and listen to his story.

We’ll have guests staying with us all next week and I’m trying to plan some fun things to do without breaking the bank. We’ll also have two 3-year-old toddlers with us, so we’re looking for simple, low-key activities.

- Festival of Lights / checking out the falls at night
- Niagara-on-the-Lake (just walking around, parks, coffee, etc.)
- Clifton Hill (mostly to walk around, not too much paid attractions)

If you have any suggestions for free or budget-friendly things to do around the Niagara region, especially stuff that works well with toddlers, I’d love to hear them. Parks, short walks, easy outings; anything like that.

Also, if there are any special events happening next week (preferably free or low-cost), please let me know!

I’m try to explain this in detail, so you can really get the full picture.

Me (26F) and my two close friends, Sam (24M) and Leah (24F) , don't live in a same city anymore, but have been friends for about 6 years. We supported each other a lot, especially on the work side. 

I know my hormones are probably making me more irritable than usual (PCOS, period’s been delayed for about a couple month), so maybe I’m overreacting…or Leah is actually crossing boundaries and being passive-aggressive lately…

Some background about Leah :
She’s always been extremely in love with whoever she’s dating. 
She basically never goes through a long stretch without a relationship. 
And she’s never introduced any of her boyfriends to us.

She also has a huge friend group outside of our little trio and is constantly going from concert to concert — which is often where she falls in love — so there’s always something going on around her. Because of this, she usually “doesn’t have time” to meet, video call, or even properly chat; she just randomly pops in to tell us what’s going on.

This summer, at a concert, she met a guy and immediately fell head over heels. She told us how different he is, how perfectly they understand each other, and so on. We’ve actually heard this exact same story with her previous boyfriends.

After just two weeks of dating, he moved in with her, and we pretty much lost her — which, honestly, we’ve come to expect by now. When she’s in a relationship, she’s barely reachable. Even when she was in my city with this boyfriend, she didn’t even check if I was free to hang out, either with her alone or with both of them.

Fast forward:
They had been together for about two months when he got arrested for selling drugs and was put into pre-trial detention. Leah completely broke down emotionally. According to her, everyone was at fault except her boyfriend. She claims he got arrested for something that’s legal in other countries, though she also mentioned that there were multiple substances involved, not just weed.

One day we traveled to the capital city — a place I barely know anything about. I literally only know the studio we work at and the route there and back (I’m terrible with directions, even with maps, and I later found out she is too). This was our last working day before the move, and then we were going to start packing.
Without any real warning, Leah expected me to accompany her — she doesn’t ask, she just says “I need you to come with me” — to the prison because she wanted to submit a letter and speak with his legal counsel over the phone (I had to record the call). I could tell she’d be really hurt if I didn’t go, and she said we could come back to the studio afterward, just 1–2 hours, so I ended up going with her. I spent from 11 AM to 5 PM walking across the city, getting lost multiple times, going from one prison to another, while watching her have emotional breakdowns and phone calls with his parents.

That day I made no money. I won’t even want get into it, but I’m just really irritated right now — after not being in the studio for a while(about a month) , I realized all my supplies had been used up — like $60 worth of stuff, which in my country is a serious amount, about 11 hours of work for a retail worker. Not just by Leah (according to her), but by others too, which she said was “totally normal since I wasn’t there” and that “she thought she’d buy it back for me” (she's not). So yeah, whether I wanted to work that day or pack my things to take home — because the studio moving — I couldn’t do either. AND she knew I could only bring home empty bottles. I really just made the trip for nothing… oh right, to escort her. 😂🤌🏼

That’s when I decided I would never escort her again. 

A couple of weeks ago, Sam told me that Leah was in his city (the capital) and invited him to meet up “for coffee” — and of course, he ended up escorting her to the prison, not just once, but twice. I know I’m probably being super hormonal, but it’s really triggering me.
She knows he would probably say no if she actually told him what she wanted. She literally admitted like, — haha i “tricked” Sam into going with me — so yeah, she straight-up manipulates.

A few days later, she asked if I wanted to meet and if I could walk with her to the post office to send another letter. At that point, I started feeling like I was just someone she uses as an emotional distraction so she doesn’t have to fully face what she’s dealing with. I didn’t want to flat-out say no, since she’d probably already being upset, so I explained I had to go to the dentist and then clean my apartment. She tried to work around it, compromising, like saying she could go to the post office first, then come with me to the dentist at 10, and hang out at my place until her lawyer appointment at 3. Needless to say, there was no way for me to get anything done during that time while she waited for her appointment at my place.

I tried to let that go — but then this happened.

Yesterday, she sent a document in our three-person Messenger group (me, Sam, and her).
She asked us to fill out a form with witness name, address, and signature. It’s for her boyfriend.
L: “I need a witness for a contract cancellation, can one of you write down your signature too?”
S: “What kind of contract?”
L: “I need it now, I’ll explain later, damn. For phone.” — (I could only translate it as “damn,” but in reality she used a much stronger swear word.)
S: “Does it have to be signed in person?”
L: “No, send it here.”
S: “And you’ll write it in?”
L: “Alright, thanks for the nitpicking, my phone’s dying and my hand is freezing.”

I didn’t even know how to react to that — I was just irritated, kind of wanted to laugh it off. Why us? Why not her boyfriend’s parents, or a sibling, someone who actually here? Why us, when we’re literally 200 km away? She wants to put our names on what’s probably a legal/police document? And she didn’t even tell us what it actually is?

Then today, she messaged me out of the blue:
L: “Dear, can I sleep at your place?”
I asked why and where she even planned to sleep (I don't live alone, I have a tiny room, a small bed, no couch, shy cats).
Her answer was basically: “alright then, whatever.”

It felt extremely passive-aggressive, like she was trying to do me a favor by wanting to crash at my place, and I was supposed to feel bad for not immediately offering my space, time, and energy.

We haven’t talked since then.
Tomorrow, someone will probably break the ice in our group chat — either her or Sam.

So.. Am I overreacting? 

If I am, should I just tell her that I’m not in the right headspace to deal with her problems right now, because it’s frustrating me and I don’t want to argue?... Just.. Nicer. 

If I’m not… what should I do?

English isn’t my first language, so apologies if anything sounds awkward.

SHARDOR Professional 64mm Burr Coffee Grinder vs MOKKOM Professional 64mm Flat Burr Coffee Grinder [$350],"I’ve been considering both of these since I started looking into the DF64 which is $500 canadian. The Shardor has great reviews from Lance Hendrick, and Tom’s Coffee Corner shows that the Mokkom is a strong contender with a more affordable setup overall.

From what I’ve heard, the Mokkom is essentially the Shardor’s sister model. So what’s the real difference between the two?

Mokkom

* Comes with both the hopper and the bellow included
* Exterior is steel (more durable)
* $338.99 CAD

Shardor

* You need to buy the hopper and bellow separately
   * Base price: $296 CAD
   * Bellow: \~$17.99
   * Total: \~$313 CAD
* Exterior is plastic (unless you choose the heavier/more expensive version)

Verdict so far  
The only real advantages I see for the Mokkom are that the bellow and hopper are included and it has a steel exterior. With the Shardor, you pay a bit less if you add the bellow, but the build isn’t as robust unless you upgrade.

1pqzyvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/1pqzyvi/finally_cracked_20k_views_after_changing_these/,Finally cracked 20k views after changing these things,"I've been borderline addicted to creating videos for the past two years. Like genuinely might have a problem addicted. I'm talking 12 hour days breaking down what goes viral, testing different hooks, rewriting everything, trying new editing styles, the whole thing.

The reason? I'm convinced video is the only real opportunity that matters right now. Building audiences, generating income, landing deals, opening doors, it all hinges on whether you can capture attention for 30 seconds.

But here's what almost broke me. Despite grinding every single day, nothing was landing. I'd pour 6 hours into a video just to watch it flatline at 295 views. Tried every approach from every expert. Watched tutorials. Applied ""guaranteed frameworks."" Still nowhere.

I was genuinely starting to believe some creators just get it and I don't. Like maybe I was just missing whatever makes content click.

Then I had this moment where it hit me, I'm working constantly, but I'm doing it blind. I don't actually know what's failing. I'm just throwing things out and hoping.

So I stopped chasing some mythical algorithm and started tracking real data. Analyzed my last 50 videos frame by frame, documented every single drop off point, and discovered 5 patterns that kept killing my retention.

1. Generic openers are invisible. ""You won't believe this"" gets skipped every time. But ""replaced coffee with green tea and had a migraine for 5 days straight"" stops the scroll. Specificity beats mystery.
2. Second 5 decides if they stay. Most people bail between 4-7 seconds if you haven't proven it's worth watching. I was building suspense like an idiot. Now I hit them with my best visual or payoff right at second 5. That's your real hook.
3. Any pause over 1 second kills you. Seriously tracked this, anything longer than 1.2 seconds and people think the video froze. What feels like good pacing to you reads as ""boring"" to someone scrolling. Cut way tighter than feels natural.
4. Static visuals lose viewers within seconds. If your video looks the same for more than 3 seconds, people zone out. I started switching camera angles, adding b roll, changing text placement, anything to create visual variety. Went from losing 61% at the midpoint to keeping 74%.
5. Rewatch rate is more important than you think. Videos people watch twice get pushed way harder. Started adding quick text that's easy to miss, faster cuts, little details you catch on second viewing. Rewatch rate went from 9% to 32% and views exploded.

Honestly the biggest shift was stopping the guessing game and actually measuring what was happening second by second.

I found this tool called TlkAlyzer that analyzes your videos and tells you exactly where people drop off and why. Like it doesn't just show the dropoff point, it explains the actual reason people left and how to fix it next video. That's when things actually changed. Went from 295 average views to 18k in like 3 weeks.

Native analytics show you people are leaving. This shows you the exact moment, why it's happening, and what to change next video.

If you're posting consistently but can't break 1k views, it's not your content that sucks, you just don't know what's actually working vs what you think is working.

Sharing this because figuring this out took way longer than it needed to. Wish someone had just explained the mechanics when I was doubting everything. Could've avoided months of frustration and thinking I wasn't good enough. So I'm laying it out for whoever's stuck there right now.",10,1766188383.0,Instagram,1,0.81,False

The research I've done suggest it's best not to use tap water, especially if your water is hard (mine is), because it will adversely affect taste, and can harm the machine. So this is a bit confusing, but I'd actually prefer to use tap water and avoid the hassle of getting RO system (or buying bottled water), then adding a mineral packet, etc.

1pqzv6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentTexts/comments/1pqzv6s/coffee_with_the_taste_of_tears/,Coffee with the Taste of Tears,"Grief—a word we all know too well.

We recognize it instantly,

carry an intimate understanding of it.

Most of the time, it arrives without warning;

sometimes it seeps so deeply into us

it feels as though it wants to take our life with it.

If you ask anyone who has lived through mourning, sorrow, and loss,

they will remember pain—

because behind every pain, grief is rooted.

Sometimes the pain grows so immense

that it pulls a human being straight into mourning.

Yesterday, I was listening to a podcast about this very subject.

The guest was David Kessler, speaking about grief.

His words were precious—

and I found myself inside them.

He said that grief comes from love.

The deeper and more intense the love,

the heavier the mourning becomes.

Grief is simply another form of pain—

and if you stay with it long enough,

you will discover that love exists

on the other side of pain.

That sentence shook my heart.

How true it is.

How deeply I feel it.

Maybe that is why I still haven’t passed through this stage—

because I loved in a way I cannot explain.

All I know is this:

loss, whether it comes from death

or from the collapse of a relationship,

from a separation cruelly forced upon you,

leaves the same wound.

It was forced upon me twice in a very short time—

once with the death of my beloved father,

and once when you and I became strangers.

Grief feels like being thrown onto a road you do not know—

a road you were never taught how to drive.

You know nothing about it,

yet suddenly you are on it.

That is where I am now.

Pushed into it unwillingly,

learning slowly how to move forward,

how to follow the light,

toward a destination filled with beauty, freshness,

and the scent of something like spring.

We all wish for a companion on the way—

but this is a journey each person must take alone.

When you left, I became like a pair of scissors

with one blade missing—

cut in half, incomplete.

I searched for you everywhere,

but perhaps you attached yourself to another blade,

or chose a different road toward your own destination.

I still think of you.

And of my father—

whom I carry with me every day,

piece by piece, breath by breath.

I think of the days when you were both beside me.

This was the heaviest lesson of my life—

a lesson I was never prepared for.

But lessons like this force a new way of seeing;

they make you wiser, more awake, more human.

Still, I loved my madness—

before you, and with you.

I remembered how you once called me crazy—

for showing up unexpectedly,

for asking the questions I needed answered,

for trying to protect the only thing still alive inside me

after my father’s death:

my love for you, and what we had.

I know you did not truly believe I was crazy,

but you judged me.

Others did too.

The truth is, I only loved you fiercely.

And you left me alone with unanswered questions.

At times I wondered if I was wrong—

if my actions were far from who I truly am.

The real me is wiser.

And yet, even though what I did was a mixture of courage and foolishness,

a part of me admired myself

for choosing to fight for what I wanted,

for the one I loved,

even for standing against my own fear.

This is what I love about myself:

at every stage of my life,

I have faced what stood in front of me—

even when the ending was not the one I hoped for.

Yesterday, listening to the voice of a grief expert,

I finally understood something important:

I was not crazy.

I was grieving.

And everything I did was human,

completely normal.

I was relieved to finally have my answer.

I wish you could have understood me—

understood what losing a father does to the heart.

All I wanted was for you to say, I’m here.

I did not need explanations.

I only needed your presence.

Just one embrace.

Today, while moving through these memories,

a single tear fell into my cup of coffee.

Coffee infused with tears.

What a strange mixture—

love, grief, separation,

and a quiet taste of salt.

I tasted it.

I liked it.

After all, it was my own tear—

and it made the coffee richer, more valuable,

because for every drop of it,

I paid with countless lessons.

Maybe this should be added to menus one day:

coffee with the taste of tears—

so everyone can taste it.

Loss is what happens in life;

meaning is what you make happen 

after the loss,

after the pain.

And that is where healing begins.

And almost any Big firms had 0 interviews 0 contact, just constant rejections every single day.

I would say I almost did everything I can, except I didn't do grad school nor did CFA level1/CSC.

I just want to have a positions that pays decent and my more than satisfied, and just getting a position is much more important to me than monetary benefits.

Every single position has hundreds of applicants and I’ve been consistently rejected every week although I’m an M&A analyst at my position right now. But I felt like I will get laid off and just planning to get a better job.

1pqztup,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1pqztup/struggling_with_overnight_guests/,Struggling with overnight guests,"I’m currently sharing a family property with my sister and her husband. I’ve lived in another state for 10 years and now I’m back in my hometown. I’m comfortable at the current property, but my dad owns it. He lives two hours away and likes to bring friends up for the weekends. When he brings two of his friends he had for over 20 years, I always have to give up my bedroom because they’re two older ladies that need a queen bed. I either sleep on the couch or the extra twin bed in another room. My social battery runs so low after the second night and it’s hard for me to hide it. I just find ways to avoid social interaction because them staying up till 2 AM wanting to talk, and then waking up at 8am making breakfast I just want peace and time to get myself ready for the day and just enjoy a cup of coffee without having to entertain. Also we have dogs and the older one of the ladies complains when the dog jumps on her and licks her. I’m respectful and stop it, but I feel like this is my dog’s house too. She has dog allergies as well. 

The other lady has been friends with my dad for 30 years, I’ve only spent the last year getting to know her. She had made some very opinionated comments towards me that left a bad taste in my mouth. I occasionally have smoked weed before bed, which is legal here, and she has made comments saying weed smokers have the attention span of a gnat. 

A few years ago, she was in a coma and almost passed away, she turned to me and said “before my accident I was like you (as she pointed to me) and after my accident, I’m like you” (pointed at sister) thought it was a strange comment to compare us when she didn’t really know me that well, I took it definitely not as a compliment. So that’s preface to why also I’m not all the way comfortable with her.

They both cook dinner and breakfast, which I do appreciate. But The last time they were here I have prepared cookies in the fridge and one of the ladies accidentally knocked over the whole tray. I was visibly irritated and they were uncomfortable. I ended up getting into a bad argument with my sister around them as well. I feel bad now, but it’s just so hard for me to tolerate overnight guests more than two nights. My sister has huge issues with this and her husband as well. I do my best to put everyone’s feelings above mine because I feel I’m being the “antisocial” person. 

I would like to make it right with a two ladies, not sure how being uncomfortable after the last trip. Also, how do other introverts deal with overnight guests and feeling their space is invaded? ",5,1766188004.0,introvert,1,1.0,False

I’m an only child. My parents lost all their other kids to miscarriages so I can’t off myself. I might wait until they die and whatever pets I have at the time die too. And then off myself. Because at that point I will have nothing to live for. 

I’m autistic as well as aromantic and asexual so I can’t feel love and connection like a normal person. I haven’t been able to make meaningful friendships, especially in real life, for years. It feels like nobody cares about me except my mom and dad. I’m just a boring afterthought who nobody can relate to. I don’t drink at all or smoke or go to parties. And I don’t even want to socialize at coffee shops or book or art clubs or other ways introverts are supposed to make friends. Even small group environment are too overstimulating for me and I always feel like a ghost who is invisible to the people around me and watching from the sidelines.

For a while it was bearable because my antidepressants were working to hold my feelings in the back of my mind. But I think I built a tolerance to them. I’ve been taking psych meds since 2021 and I’ve been going to therapy on and off since 2018 but i always end up just as nihilistic as before. 

I work 3 different part time jobs, mainly as a caregiver for people with disabilities, but none of the jobs have coworkers who I can interact with. And I go to a very small college and live off campus. I don’t have friends there either. My professors like me, but I don’t think any of the other students do. I’m ironically getting a masters degree in clinical social work so I can be a therapist. I want to help people get out of the trap I’ve apparently grown too weak to keep fighting against myself. 

Just today I went out Christmas shopping with my mom and I felt so lonely and empty that I came home and cried for 45 minutes. Going out in public and being around people just makes me feel more disconnected from the world. My birthday is in less than a week and I have no friends to celebrate with. My best friend abandoned me for having depression two years ago, and it still hurts so bad that I can’t trust anybody else. The few college acquaintances who live near me never take the initiative to hang out with me. 

And when I look into my future I see a life where my parents die, my pets die, and I have no partners, no friends, no children, not even siblings. Nothing to make life worth living. My passions of writing and art will become irrelevant and replaceable by AI. I will probably get dementia from my isolation and then die in a nursing home of aspiration pneumonia with some sort of AI Robot nurse supervising me. And nobody will ever come visit me or remember me after I die. My obituary will probably be written by whatever version of chat gpt exists in 4 decades. 

I genuinely don’t think there’s any reason for me to be alive. But I’m not actively looking for ways to kill myself because I don’t want to traumatize other people with my death. I guess I’ll keep trying to be useful to the world until I genuinely cannot take it anymore and I have nobody left around me who will care if I kill myself. ",5,1766187930.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False

It was a rather slow realisation as I awoke to a new day. The crushing truth that none of this had been a dream slowly dawning on me as I gradually drifted back to consciousness. The sound of waves lashing against the upper floor windows confirmed to me beyond doubt that I had not simply conjured this up in my mind. Once my sleepy state had fully subsided, I recalled every awful detail of the previous night. The effects of last night’s alcohol consumption had largely worn off by this stage, and little details began to come back to me. 

The first notable image which ran through my mind with renewed clarity was the arrival of this mysterious ferry at Balmain East near on midnight. It was clear to me now there were definitely not supposed to be any ferries running back at that time. Furthermore, something about the vessel didn’t look right. The ferries of Sydney Harbour have a distinct green and yellow look to them. I suppose I passed it off at the time, as it was dark and foggy, and I was more interested in getting home than anything, but I did recall being slightly taken aback by the unique dark grey colouring of this ferry. I sat up, rubbing my eyes, intending to head outside and confirm my hazy memory, when I heard a crackle from above me…

*“Greetings passengers. The café service is now open. Please proceed to the counter in an orderly fashion, and you will be served momentarily.”*

Huh, a café? I might actually get to speak to someone. Maybe find out what the hell is going on. I glanced around, and yes, there was indeed a man behind the counter at the café. He was a rather tall individual. Bald head, slightly wrinkled skin, perhaps a man in his late 50s by the look of him, and he wore a sharp grey suit. Pretty fancy attire for a café worker on a commuter ferry, I thought. But then again… look where we are… 

I took a moment to gather myself before standing up and making my way over to the café. There were a couple of passengers ahead of me, so I stood back and waited my turn. Their behaviour seemed ever so slightly off to me, and I was reminded of the strange man last night. They were acting very similar to him, standing there nervously shifting their weight from side to side, heads down and staring at their feet. 

The first man made his way up to the counter and quietly mumbled something to the attendant before stepping back and waiting for his order. The tall man behind the counter smiled softly and nodded in acknowledgement before turning around and reaching into the freezer compartment. He pulled out a Mrs Macs sausage roll and threw it into the microwave, setting the timer to a couple of minutes. He then returned to the counter as the second customer stepped up, placing an order for a coffee and a slice of carrot cake. 

Café Guy gave me a weird vibe. He was simultaneously the kindest man I had ever laid eyes on, smiling the sweetest of smiles as he served the customers their orders, and yet there was something ominous about his demeanour. It was as though secrets were hiding behind those kind eyes. Secrets I wanted in on. I snapped myself back into the present moment as I noticed he was staring at me, and I stepped up to the counter. His expression changed significantly as he got a good look at me, that kind smile suddenly replaced with a look of concern, and a hint of something else. Amusement? I couldn’t be sure.

*“Hmm”*, he mused. *“Interesting…”*

I raised an eyebrow at this, curious to know what he found so interesting about me.

*“Um… excuse me? What’s interesting?”* I asked him, not bothering to beat around the bush. He stared back at me for a moment, before shaking his head.

*“Oh… sorry sir, never mind me, it’s a bit too early in the morning I suppose. I’ve not yet had my own coffee! What can I get you today?”*

I glanced around behind me, and seeing no more customers waiting in line, I decided now was a good time to press for answers. I leaned in, lowering my voice to an almost whisper.

*“Can you tell me what’s going on here? I got on this ferry late last night and before I knew what was going on we were heading out to sea! Is this normal? Is there a new route I don’t know about? And what’s with the Captain? He didn’t answer when I knocked on the door and called out…”*

Café Guy’s expression changed again, his eyes no longer carrying that warm demeanour. He breathed in slowly before letting out a sigh, and I stepped back, sensing perhaps a little annoyance on his part. I quickly relaxed though, as that kind smile returned.

*“Sir… this is the same route this service has always taken. This is the same route it will always take. There’s no need to worry. You’ll be home soon. Now, what can I get you?”*

I just stared at him, a mix of curiosity and concern obviously present on my face. But I decided to place a molecule of faith in his words. He seemed confident that I’d be on my way back home soon enough. Don’t get me wrong. Even in that moment I was still acutely aware that something was very wrong with this ferry, but it’s amazing how far the rational side of the brain can stretch when it wants to.

With a sigh, I spoke up. *“Just a coffee thanks mate. Latte. Two shots.”*

Café Guy nodded. *“Coming right up sir.”*

I waited patiently as he prepared my coffee, humming Kumbaya to himself as he did so. He was an odd fellow, with a personality that did not seem to match his face. He looked tired, old and weathered. Yet, he gave off an almost comforting energy. With a hiss of the coffee machine, steam pouring out of the vents, my coffee was ready, and he handed it to me with that same kind smile, never wavering. I nodded to him before turning and walking back toward the rear doors, eager to get some caffeine into my system.

Sliding open the door, I stepped out onto the upper deck, walking over to the railings and resting against them as I stared out over the infinite blue expanse before me. Nope, definitely hadn’t been a dream. There was no sign of land in any direction. I also noticed how strangely quiet it was, and I then realised the ferry’s engine wasn’t running. We were just kind of bobbing up and down in the water. The waves, a little calmer now, lapping up against the side of the boat. I gripped the railing a little tighter, as I noted the absence of Seagull calls, realising we must be very, very far out to sea. 

I felt a chill come over me as I imagined the expansive black hole beneath the ferry, the only protection from being swallowed up by it being this rickety bucket of bolts I was standing on. My grip on the railing tightened again as the ship subtly rocked from side to side. I sipped my coffee, trying my best to distract myself from those thoughts, and I pondered what lay ahead for me. 

My mind was still plagued by the possibilities as to what could be going on, still not satisfied that a hijacking was out of the question. Would we soon be approached by pirate vessels? Would we simply explode at any moment, leaving any survivors to the fate of the pacific ocean? No, that didn’t make sense. There weren’t enough of us on board to make any kind of terroristic political statement worthwhile. There was something more to this. I didn’t know what, but with every passing second the hope of actually getting home was becoming more and more of a distant pipe dream.

***Bwooooooom! Bwooooooom!***

Two loud blasts from the Ferry’s blower, and the engine roared to life, an announcement over the P.A. system following a moment later.

*“Attention passengers. This service will be departing momentarily. The café is now closed. Please take your seats.”*

I stepped back inside, just in time to see Café Guy closing up shop and heading downstairs. He gave me a little wave as he left, and I hesitantly gave a half hearted wave back to him. I really was not sure about this guy, and I think he knew it. Something about his non-answers earlier had my alarm bells ringing. Chugging back the last of my coffee, I threw the cup in the trash before heading downstairs to grab a seat on the front deck. 

I noticed my fellow passengers on the way past, all 3 of them this time. All sitting in the same row of seats. They gave me a little side eye as I walked past, one of them still chowing down on his sausage roll as he stared at me, a look of apprehension in his eyes. What the hell? Why were they so worried about my presence? 

Brushing it off, I pushed open the door to the deck, and made my way up to the bow, grabbing a seat in the shade provided by the upper deck. There I sat, my legs nervously bouncing up and down as the ferry began to make a move. I wondered where we were headed this time. Norfolk Island? Auckland? Bloody Antarctica? 

All I could see ahead of me and out both sides was blue. It gave me the feeling of being stranded in another world. In a lot of ways I suppose I was, the underwater realm beneath me a dark, endless, alien landscape to those of us who dwell above it. I shook my head, not wanting to think about that. The ferry began to pick up speed now, and the winds blew harshly across my face. It was still unusually cold, even considering how far out to sea we were. I squinted my eyes and shuffled across a couple of rows where I could be at least a little shielded from the harsh sea breeze, and there I kicked back, trying my best to enjoy the ride.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

For ages we sailed. It must have been at least 3 hours at a guess before I finally began to catch sight of land. It wasn’t long then before the iconic Sydney skyline started to come back into view, and I felt at least some relief in the knowledge that we were heading in the direction of some form of normality. The vessel slowed its pace as it rounded the bend into Port Jackson and we began the scenic cruise into Sydney Harbour. Despite the strangeness, I couldn’t help but pause for a moment and take in the sheer beauty around me. I had lived here for many years, and I had seen these sights a million times, but they still never fail to take my breath away. 

My home city truly is beautiful. Picture perfect beaches and stretches of crystal blue waters define the natural landscapes, intertwined with lush forest reserves, age old architecture, and the awe inspiring cityscape rising up beyond. The smell of the salty harbour air gave me something of a sense of calm as we sailed past beautiful Watson’s Bay, the Sydney Harbour National Park, Robertsons Point, the Botanical Gardens, and eventually rounding the bend into Circular Quay as the Harbour Bridge and Opera House came into view. 

It doesn’t matter how many times you’ve seen it, there’s still that same sense of wonder that overcomes you every time you lay eyes on it. I actually managed to crack a smile in that moment, my racing anxious mind finally slowing to a manageable pace. We were back. I was almost home.

Except… I wasn’t. 

It probably took me longer than I should have, but eventually it dawned on me. Where the hell was everyone? 

I got up from my seat and I walked around to the port side of the ferry, looking out over Circular Quay, usually packed with tourists and people going about their day by this hour, yet it was eerily empty. 

If I looked really closely, I could kind of see random people. Just figures, walking between various laneways and side streets in the distance. But there was absolutely nobody walking along the waterfront. The restaurants, normally so busy the lines are out the doors, were all closed. Even the Opera House was strangely deserted, no tourists posing for photos, no tour groups making their rounds. I wondered if perhaps it was a public holiday or something. But no… I didn’t think it was. At least, not as far as I knew. That shouldn’t account for the total lack of tourists in any case.

I continued to pace around the deck, my feet clanging against the metal surface as I strolled, and I gazed out all over the harbour. There were a few vessels out and about, but even the water traffic was very quiet today. Nowhere near as many boats out as there usually were. The ferry began to slow its pace now, the engine dying down to a low gurgle as we swung into Darling Harbour. I glanced out over the oddly still waters as we steadily drifted by the Barangaroo docks, the place where all this had begun. I was silently hoping that we may perhaps be slowing down to stop there. 

But alas, it was not to be. The ferry did indeed stop, however, right there in the middle of the harbour. The vessel lurched backwards, swinging to the left slightly as it came to an abrupt halt, and I grabbed on to a nearby pole to steady myself as it did. I shot glances all around, trying to figure out what may be the cause of this sudden emergency stop. As I stood there, the strangest sensation began to come over me. It was nothing like the creeping dread that had been building over the last 12 hours. No. This was a sudden, urgent sensation. 

My brain, out of nowhere, was screaming at me that I was not safe. I stood frozen, clinging to that pole and staring out over the deck, into the deep, murky waters mere feet away. Suddenly, startling me out of my fixation, an announcement over the crackly P.A. system…

*“Remain inside the vessel! Attention! Remain inside the vessel! For your own safety, do not go near the water! I repeat, stay away from the water!”*

I leaned back a little upon hearing that, pointlessly attempting to put a couple more centimetres between myself and those dark waters. This has gotta be a joke, right? An audible ripple on the surface startled me, and I took another step back. The water was otherwise still, so what had caused that? Another barely perceptible splash off to my right, and the water then began to ever so slightly bubble, right there in that one spot where the ripple had appeared. I slowly stepped back, fearing any sudden movements may startle… something… 

One step… then another… then another… until finally I could feel the Portside doorway. I quietly slid open the door, and stepped backwards inside, before sliding it shut again. I turned around, and I froze. All three of my fellow passengers were staring at me. Eyes wide with fear. Not concern this time. No. Stone cold fear. I didn’t know what to do. I just stared back at them, gesturing with my hands as if to say “what?!” They all turned away as I did so, looking straight ahead, their backs rigid, their hands in their laps. I didn’t know what was going on, but I got the vibe that the expectation was to sit still and be quiet. So, I quickly grabbed a seat next to the doorway, and I steeled myself. As I sat there in my seat, I heard things. It was barely audible at first. A subtle scratch here, or a little tap-tap-tap there, but these sounds grew louder with each repetition.

***Bwoonngggg!***

It echoed throughout the cabin. I glanced outside, hoping to catch sight of something. Anything that might give me a clue as to what was going on.

***Bwoonngggg!***

There it was again, louder this time. It was as though there was something heavy floating under or around the ship, bashing into it periodically. But here’s the troubling part, it was clearly impacting a different area of the ferry each time it happened. Something was down there intentionally slamming into us.

***Bwoonngggg!***

For many long hours, I sat there along with my fellow riders, still as statues, as this… whatever it was… slammed itself into the boat over and over. Occasionally, I could feel the vessel tipping backwards, or to the side ever so slightly, and I silently prayed that whatever was doing this did not possess the force necessary to tip this floating nightmare into the harbour where it awaited. I wanted off this ferry, sure, but not that way. The hours ticked on by, and as night began to settle in over Sydney, our knocking menace finally left us be. 

Something caught my eye as it did so. I couldn’t be sure, but I could have sworn as the ferry’s engines powered up once again, I saw a clearly defined slipstream catapulting away into the waters in front of us. Maybe it was just my imagination, or a trick of the light, but honestly? I don’t think so…

The ferry began chugging away again, and at this point I was all but convinced I was still not getting off this thing. It had been almost 24 hours by this point. This time last night I was still slaving away in the office, and as I thought back to that, I’d have given anything to be back there again. I glanced over at my 3 fellow travellers, still sitting there in that same row of seats, one of them with his head in his hands, shaking his head from side to side. I decided to try my luck and just talk to them. I really wasn’t sure how approachable they were, so I’d held off until now. But I wanted answers. I got up from my seat and walked on over to their side of the ship, sitting down one row behind them. Tapping one of them on the shoulder, I spoke up…

*“I’m just gonna ask… do any of you have any idea what’s going on?”*

They stayed silent. Two of the men were seemingly not even registering what I was saying. Their gaze remained fixed dead ahead, not moving at all. I focussed my attention on the one guy who was acting a little differently from the rest, his head still in his hands, and his hands clearly shaking now…

*“Mate… please… this is clearly not normal. Whatever is happening here, it’s* ***not normal!*** *Please! I just want to know what’s happening!”*

The man lifted his head from his hands, and slowly turned around to face me. I could see his eyes were red and wet with tears. He was quite a young man, in stark contrast to the older two beside him. He looked as though he wanted to say something, but was holding back.

*“Please man… please! What’s going on?! Where is this ferry going?!”*

He quietly stared for a moment, before speaking up…

*“To the end of the line…”*

He spoke these words softly, yet with a tone of finality, before turning back around, and facing straight ahead like the rest of his group.

With a groaning creak, the ferry took a sharp left, adjusting its heading toward the Parramatta River. I sat there in a state of shock. I tried once again to get the attention of any of these guys, but with no luck. Something about the way he said what he did suggested that this “end of the line” was not a place I wanted to end up. I got up from my seat and left them be, making my way to one of the front rows of seats again. Resting my head against the glass, I just… watched out the window…

A strong wind began to pick up outside, and the ferry was swaying softly from side to side, its metal construction straining and creaking as it drifted slowly down the river. As I watched out my window, I began to notice things that just did not make sense. The world outside had shifted and morphed. Things were still in their place, kind of. I had sailed down this river many times for work functions and what not, and everything I was seeing was technically where it was meant to be. But, what was there, was entirely wrong. 

A mass of tidal trees, right there where they should be, yet very different. Gnarly were their forms, twisted and lanky. Not the beautiful green canopy I was used to seeing in that spot, but a looming mess of spindly dead limbs which seemed to reach out for our vessel as it slowly made its way past. A few of them even scraped along the side of the ferry as we went, sending out an awful noise not unlike nails on a chalkboard.

The houses which lined the river, they were different too. Gone were the beautiful brick constructed riverfront homes which usually lined these waters. In their place, stood tall, cage-like constructions, their bars rattling in the fierce winds outside, and the water from the murky river lashing up and over them. As we sailed closer to these waterlogged prisons, I began to notice figures inside these cages. People. 

At least, I think they were. Some were just kind of flailing around from side to side, splashing through the shallow waters of the riverbanks which these enormous cages sunk into. Others were clearly more aggressive, stomping around through the mud and bashing their heads against the bars. They waved their hands as the boat sailed by, as if trying to get somebody’s attention. I turned away from the window when we sailed close enough by them that I got a good look at their faces. They were terrifying. Their expressions distorted into scowls with a burning anger deep in their eyes.

That was enough for me. I jumped up out of my seat, deciding to once again try to raise someone’s attention. I ran up the stairs, making my way to the entrance to the Captain’s Quarters. As I got to the door, I noticed the internal privacy shield was up, and I could see inside this time. I saw a man standing there behind the wheel, facing straight ahead, much like the other passengers. But this man was not nervous. He stood firm, his composure rock solid. I once again tried knocking on the door, screaming at him to open up and help me, but his focus did not break. He had one job, it seemed, to drive this ferry, and nothing was going to stop him. Defeated, I wandered back to the rear of the upper deck, taking a seat by the Portside windows. I could do nothing but sit and watch as we traversed further and further into the darkness. 

As we sailed, the landscape continued getting stranger. Soon enough, any remnants of what once existed here was gone. Where we would usually be sailing by modern suburbia, now stood a thick, immense forest. Not the typical sort of forestry that South East Australia is known for. No, the kind of deep woods that fill you with a primal fear just looking at them. And they sure did. We were perhaps 50 metres away from that dark tree line, and I was glad for it. That same feeling from earlier, that primal, danger present feeling, was thickening up in my bones once again. I just knew there were things in there, crawling around on the forest floor, or sliding up the trees. I didn’t know what. Nor did I want to know.

A little ways further down the river, however, that wouldn’t be up to me anymore. I had to rub my eyes to make sure I wasn’t seeing things, but no, there it was. Something staggered out from within those trees. It looked human enough from a distance, but the way it was moving, I wasn’t entirely sure. It was just walking along the riverside, navigating around those awful trees as it made its way along.  The way it walked was strange though. Every so often it would kind of stutter forward a few steps, as if glitching through space and time right in front of me. Eventually, it took a right turn, walking down to the riverside. I watched as this person… or this thing… slowly stepped out along a strange wooden pier, something that looked like it was built in the 50s. And there it stood. Waiting.

I knew what was coming, but I didn’t want to believe it. My heart skipped a beat as the ferry swung a hard left and began pulling in to dock at this rickety old jetty. As we pulled in closer, I could see this its face more clearly. It… was a he. A relatively young man, perhaps early 30s, and he was shaking. Whether from the cold or out of fear, I did not know. 

I cringed as a terrible grinding noise rang out, the ferry scraping along to dock at the old jetty. A clang from below, and I looked out to see a brute of a man wheeling a ramp out of the shadows and onto the wooden docks. Ramp Guy was back. The one I had resolved to keep clear of last night. But where the hell had he been?! I hadn’t seen him at all since I boarded.

***Bwooooooom! Bwooooooom!***

Another two blasts from the ferry’s horn, followed by a stern voice through the P.A. system…

*“DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL! DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL! DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL!”*

It hit me then! Why was I just sitting here?! My heart was racing. This was my chance! I looked down, watching as the young man shuffled his way across the ramp, the ferry bouncing up and down, threatening to dunk it into the water at any moment. I got up from my seat, and started making my way downstairs.

***“DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL! DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL! DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL!”***

It seems my actions were not going unnoticed. Well, to hell with that. I picked up my pace, running down the stairs, my only goal to get the hell off this forsaken boat. I gave no thought to the strangeness outside, to the twisted, otherworldly plain which awaited me. All I knew was that step one was getting myself off this thing. I broke into a sprint when I hit the bottom floor, dashing toward the doors, when suddenly…

***SMACK!***

I ran straight into the boarding passenger. I stepped back, my flight pointless now as the monster of a man outside slammed the gates shut and the ferry once more began to pull away into the night, my chance at freedom slowly drifting away from me.

The man stared at me, his eyes wide, and clearly shot with fear. The look in his eyes as he saw me, it was like he was staring his own death in the face. It was haunting. He grabbed on to my arms suddenly, and I tried to pull away, asking him what the hell he was doing! He simply stared back at me, as he gripped me tight and asked…

*“HOW… are you here?!”*

Before I could get a single word out, he turned and ran upstairs. In shock, I just stood there for a moment, watching as “ramp guy” slammed the contraption back against the wall and stormed off to the back of the ship. Shaking myself back into the moment, I turned and I ran upstairs, following that guy… And I froze.

There he stood. Right there just beyond the top of the stairs in the aisle… just staring. He didn’t look scared anymore. No, now he scared ***me***. His face. The best I can describe it is devoid. Devoid of emotion, devoid of expression… devoid of life. He was completely and totally still, staring straight ahead. Not at me, just straight ahead into thin air. I very slowly and very carefully approached the guy. 

“Hello?” I said. To no response.

I waved my hand in front of his face. Again, no response. I tapped his shoulder, and even grabbed his arm, shaking him, trying to raise any sign of life. Nothing. 

I slowly tiptoed around to the side of him, curious to see if his stone cold gaze would follow me.

Nothing.

I was just about to back away, when in that moment, his head snapped toward me…

***“ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME?!”***

Jesus Christ! His voice was… awful! Deep and distorted, and his eyes now full of sheer hatred. I stumbled back, almost toppling down the stairs. I grabbed at the rail, trying to keep my composure as I stepped backwards. As I did so, he took measured paces toward me, coming closer and closer, that hateful stare fixed on me now. 

I turned. And I ran! Grabbing the side of the wall, I quickly pivoted around the corner, making a beeline to the ferry’s lavatory. I could hear his footsteps, still coming down the stairs as I ripped open the bathroom door and hurled myself inside, locking the door behind me.

And there I stayed. Listening to this thing, for a human being I was now convinced it was not, knocking on the door… all throughout the night.",1,1766187483.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

The drive home even 2 weeks later was odd. Low laying dread churned in the tires of my 2011 Ford shitbox. A series of infractions upon the natural way of the world had induced some clinical uprooting. An algorithmic breakdown and reconstruction that had targeted the organized logic I had labeled and drawered and boxed so meticulously. The table laid like this: 3 dead; 1 male, 1 female, 1 lamb; with a pocketed 8 in the possession of whoever committed this crime. Textbook religious iconography but with elements of traditional biblical myth altered. “Eve gave the fruit to Adam.” This thought bounced around in an echo chamber that was unproductive for almost 16 days at this point. Why paint Adam as the instigator? Why a lamb and not a snake?

“Becasue the form was cursed.” My hand flinched against the wheel and despite the angle only being shifted slightly, the car squirmed and tensed, sending its back wheels out of control. The voice, the silent serial sermoner, once more whispered without words into my ear. The words had left my own lips, repeating what I had been told, instants before convulsing and sending my car off the road. It came to a rest in the ditch. Nothing was broken other than my right mirror, but much more had been displaced. Voices don’t come from the sky, they murmur to you in the corners of your mind, in the corners you thought only your mind can whisper to itself.

My breath bubbled in my throat and slowly gained the confidence to be exhaled out into the frightening world. “Because the form was cursed.” It didn’t take long for me to forget about the crash and start back on the road, coasting 20 over. The brakes squealed as I docked it and the lights flashed rapidly as I leapt out and ran for the nearest bible. The bookstore would closed, but the library closest to my house was 24/7. I bolted in, scanned my library card and pulled a bible off the shelf.

My knowledge of the Bible was limited, I had gone through some indoctrinatorial Sunday School sessions as a teen after my mom died and my dad found Christ. It never stuck with me but I never discredited it, it was a theory of the world and I’d be a shitty detective to turn down a theory. I gave God his merits as a stand up guy who I was confident would be fun to have a beer with, but in the same way I thought superman would be. Fictional until proven real. But now my nose was 6 feet deep into the Bible and my brain was 5 cups deep into self-serve coffee provided in the cafe.

I checked out the Bible around 4 am and drove home in a hope to scavenge the 3 hours I had till work began for something akin to sleep. I found it in the driveway, having parked my car and not even reaching the handle.

My internal clock woke me up around 6:30 and without question my groggy brain set the car to sail.

“Christ, you okay?” Oscar asked, carrying a manilla folder in his hand.

“Crashed my car and slept in my drive way, I’m fine. Tell me that’s the autopsy report?”

“Damn; well lucky you it’s not just the autopsy.” He passed it to me. “Autopsy and medical report, and forensic finally got back on the kn- bottle… bottle you sent in.”

“Nice save, Grapejuice.”

“Fuck you, take a nap.” Oscar chuckled and instinctively checked his tie due to the trauma of not remembering where his mouth was and fumbling a cup of grape juice at last year's policemen’s ball.

I slammed into my chair at my desk and parted the manila sea. Below my eyes, laid out in the ME’s neat script, was the gutty works. Literally.

The stab wound in the nape of the man’s neck was congruent with a 5 inch, double edged blade. “*The kind you’d find in an occult shop or specialty bladesmith’s.*” I read. “Or from the ocean.” I grumbled. The man’s pineal gland had been destroyed in something the ME equated to a targeted lobotomy.

The woman’s stab wound was delivered from the same knife- the lamb too- and on top of the hysterectomy, the entire vaginal interior had been removed apart from the ovaries. “*Highly skilled cut work, almost presumed MRKH or another form of mutation resulting in the absence of any genital organs, until I discovered the shear lines on the ovaries.* Dear God…”

Finally, the lamb. The lamb’s spine had 365 vertebrae in its spine. Not surgically inserted, all original to the lamb. “*Grotesque mutation unlike anything I thought biologically possible. It’s like a snake tried to hide as a lamb.*” I paused and took a boulder of swallow. “Cursed.”

“Attention!”

“Oh come on.” My low voice distorted through my gritted teeth.

“Mount up, mass casualty scene got called in at the Friendly Earth recycling plant just south. If you ain’t got a stiff stomach, stay put and process those in holding. Otherwise, follow the lead unit.” Temple moved through the bullpen and out to the stairs, flanked by a bulk of veteran detectives, leaving behind the youth.

I entered my cruiser and made the 10 minute drive through the grey walls of Seattle to the grim plant. In the gut of the plant, where the plastics were melted and purified, 8 victims were laid out in contorted shapes. “Hollowed be thy name.” Grape juice whispered to himself as he clutched his cross. Oscar had been out the week of the Pier murders, and wasn’t quick to believe the other officers' tall-tales about mutilated corpses in such a public location. “It’s a Leviathan’s Cross-” Now he believed, and went to vomit. He bolted for the door and crumpled past it, vomiting his breakfast out onto the ground.

I wrote down “Leviathan’s Cross.” onto my note pad then sent one of the younger agents to assist Oscar. 8 bent corpses were laid in the the shape of a Leviathan’s Cross, the children making up the two smaller bars as well as parts of the figure 8. The women comprised the top two bars and the remainder of the figure 8. At the top of the shape was a large bearded man, a bag over his head, with his arms above his head in a diver’s pose. “Noah, his wife, Shem, Ham, Joseph, and their wives.”

“Japheth.”

“What-”

“Japheth, not Joseph.” Temple corrected.

“Japheth…” I repeated. Surrounding the symbol was the leg of a lizard, the leg of a calf, the wing of a bird, the tail of a fish, and a beetle speared on a pin stuck into a cork. Each victim was soaking wet. I’m not an ME, but you see enough dead bodies you begin to pick up on patterns. There’s only so many ways to kill someone after all. The bloated lips, blue skin, inflated abdomen.

Toward the rear of the room the furnace roared, its flames whipped and scorned the walls.

He ordered the furnace heated seven times more than it was usually heated. And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell bound into the burning fiery furnace.

And as the flame licked their skin-

Ash of 50 years of raging flames was tossed about in the metal cell. Yellows and reds of flames colliding and shattering against each other in rapid, arrhythmic fashion. A slender pillar of orange flame twirled into the air and was joined by 3 more to make 4.

A fourth joined them and the flames enthralled them, yet with the hands of the lord upon them: they walked out-

My hand swam in the empty heat, flanking me Temple and Oscar began a mad dash for me. Past the wrist, my hand sank into the fire reach towards the fourth and largest pillar. Reaching, reaching, reaching for the scrap of fluttering paper that- despite being disposed off into the loathing flame- remained-

Untouched.

Nebekenezzer sank and drew to his knees as all the spite he carried throughout his life drained. He began to praise the men's God for- truly- nothing and no one exists beyond his eye.

Temple’s bright shocked face came into view as he and Oscar reeled me for the raging furnace. Hairs along the side of their heads grew curled and black, but only sparsely as they wrenched me from the furnace window I had opened without even realizing. Temple continued with me to the ground but Oscar used his shoulder to drive the window shut.

“Jesus fuck, Gabe! Are you insane?” Temple yelled to me as he stood and pulled me to my feet. “Your arm’s- is… fine?” His brow plunged and he examined me. My button-up was toasty, like it was fresh from the dryer, but was untouched and so was I.

“Oh, God no!” A shrill voice cried.

“What now!” I grunted as I snuck the paper into my back pocket and pushed past the stunned to silence Oscar and Temple.

“Ay- no, how- How are you just fine?” Temple shouted.

“Parker!” I ignored his statement as I dove to Parker’s- Noah’s- side. His arms laid prostrate above his head, the bag that had covered his face was tossed aside, and the sheep fur sewn to his face formed his beard. A week prior, Parker had taken leave for holiday and set his return date as tomorrow. But, today he bore a pale blue hue to his black skin, and his eyes were frozen in strict fear. This made my chest heaved for the first time in decades, his pupils had been punctured and a wisdom tooth was inserted into each.

I melted near him, Temple and Oscar and the techs tried to get me to leave his side but it’d be treason to part from his side. Eventually it was just me and the techs and EMTs and Parker. “I’m staying right the hell here.” I screamed at Marques as he tried to inform me how bad this was for me, but I didn’t care. After a few moments Marques resumed with his examination. The 14 of the 16 teeth recover fit in 7 of the 8 mouths. One pair wasn’t a match for anybody but it didn’t take long for Marques to notice the yellowing pattern of Parker’s teeth, matched ones in his eye. “So… One person unaccounted for?”

“Looks like it. We can check the dental report and get the names of the John and Jane Does.”

“What dental report?” I jeered.

“Of the teeth recovered? I sent them to Uri Monday, she said the report got delivered this morning.” He squinted at me.

“The medical report. Dammit, the folder, shit. Marques, from now on all medical and forensic reports go to me first, understood?”

“Okay… Why?”

“None of your business, it’s about trust: you trust me?”

“More than anyone I know.”

“Good. I gotta go. Make sure they treat Parker right, okay?”

“Okay.”

Somehow I stuck my hand in a blazing flame because I knew something was in there, somehow I climbed down a fragile ladder and retrieved a metal blade from the ocean because I knew it was down there, and now; somehow I knew something would be missing from that folder on my desk. I packed into my cruiser and sped back to the station. Docked, ran, and tumbled into the elevator. “C’mon, c’mon, c’mon.” I stammered, pressing the 3rd floor button hurriedly. The doors shut and held there till they parted unto the 3rd floor.

My chair squeaked and my desk yawned as I huddled around the files and riffled through it.

No dental report. It wasn’t worth breaking anything over, I knew it’d be gone, but I still did. “Can I help you?” I asked, my computer monitor shattered on the ground next to me and a snow globe through the dry wall behind me. Before anyone could find the words to respond I excused myself, and headed home; the file clutched tightly in my hand.

I threw the deadbolt and locked each door leading to my office. On my desk lay the file and the page of paper from the furnace. I set the file aside, the paper had justifiably peaked my attention.

“No man escapes the eye of God. Man, no man. But, the devil has before and he can again. Correct God’s law and the Anti-messiah shall come.”

The handwritten script was a quote, but whoever wrote it wasn’t kind enough to cite their source. I’ll spare a lecture on google, but google is a detective's best-friend. Most cases get solved because the right question is asked and new information lost in the fold of infinite information is found. In this case, I just copied the quote into the search bar.

“נגד המילה.” or Against The Word, was a concept. A text that was drafted by The Apostate, Julian sometime around 360 AD, but never published in any official format. However, parts of the draft were referenced in later occult texts like the Lesser Key of Solomon. The only reason knowledge exists of it is because a few sympathetic priests, protected the text and used it as an example of a fall from grace throughout sermons and their own texts. The most complete compilation of the original script exists in PDF format but also in physical format as a sort of hot potato that gets passed around from cult to cult after they slowly die or get arrested.

The last known location of the text was in the hands of the Ant Hill Kids cult until it wasn’t. The trail of possession died there, but I didn’t need to know where it went, because I knew where it was. Here, in the same city I was born. 56 hours- only 2 of which being sleep- will do funny things to your levels of dedication. By the 50 hour mark, the brain reaches a: “Made it this far, why quit now?” Mentality that does wonders for productivity. I sipped a Redbull and committed to reading the entirety of Against The Word.

This motherfucker was insane. An entire chapter took to describing, with resolve-shaking detail, the procedure in which to summon or abort an immaculate conception; others took time to emphasize the method a demon uses to remove the vaginal cavity of a woman. I have no clue what was in the water in 360 AD, but clearly he was well hydrated. It was 10 till 3 in the morning when I finally finished the almost eleven-hundred page document. I’m not Christian, but I’d say this is the closest thing they have to an Absolute Heresy. Nigh-every principle taught in the Bible was either mocked or outright corrupted throughout. ‘Round about 900 pages, in response to the birth of Jesus and the New Covenant, was this chestnut of a chapter title: “Welcoming Upon The Anti-Messiah And Bringing Upon a Godless Apocalypse.” The following chapter described a ritual consisting of 3 killings, 3 “Correction of the Law.”

“Extinguishing the Flaming Sword.”, “Evaporating the Flood.” and… That’s where the PDF compilers kindly informed the reader: “Recovered texts stop here and don’t resume until the next chapter starts.”

Immaculately disappointing but not totally unhelpful. If you had to think of the most critical moments of Law Enforcement from the Almighty, which 3 would you pick? You may pick the placement of the flaming sword barring Adam and Eve from entrance to the Garden of Eden, you may pick the Flooding of Earth to punish the wicked, but you almost certainly will pick-

And on the 20th of Pachon the Lord’s child was born to a virgin mother, in a stable surrounded by his father’s creations. He would bear the law. He would ensure that every letter of the law would be fulfilled. Not one letter would go ignored, not one letter would slip beyond the eye of God.

The Birth of Christ, the utter enforcer of holy law. One pair of teeth left. Anti-Messiah. If the Pier was used to put out the sword, if the furnace was used to evaporate the flood, then where would a heretic see fit to locate their mockery of the birth of Christ? I was lost as to that, but read on.

“Becoming the Anti-Messiah.” The chapter began. Described was what one would have to put themselves through to form themselves into a Tabula Rasa, a blank vessel. By any means, the person must lose their ability to smell, taste, feel, and finally see. Only hearing may remind as the vessel must be able to hear the chants of the Anti-Messiah. They must sever all connections in their life except for their child as: “It is critical for the final ritual.

Another funny thing the brain will do, after crossing the 65 hour mark, unless properly stimulated, will simply shut down.

My laptop was long expired by the time I stirred awake, a river of slick drool flowing across the keyboard. A 2 week paid vacation- suspension- text sat on my phone from Captain Temple so given my new found study time, I did just that. I finally took a peek at the forensic report for the knife I rested from the sea; by some miracle- which were becoming common- the finger prints were almost entirely intact. Intact but completely flat. No ridges, just the blank flat stamp of 5 printless fingers.

Lack of most senses, no finger prints, no family connection minus their child, and within all likelihood a deep understanding of religious texts. Very few people in Seattle fit that description, even worse I didn’t know who they were.

With time on my hand, I started to reread the Bible as well as Against The Word. Maybe- my logic went- if I read them enough the silent sermoner would return and give another nugget of insight. But each day passed without any of those wordless words.

It didn’t take more than 3 reads of Against The Word to realize it was- apart from an occult text- a glorified dick-sucking of Nero. References to the first “Beast.” who fell short due to the meddling of “The Jew's God.” and this “Man Against Law.” talents in theater, and his eventual suicide via a blade to the “Womb.”

Under the star of Bethlehem, the child writhed and cried. The 3 kings gave their gifts unto the son of the king of kings.

The animals bowed to him, the sky bowed to him, but the snake joined him in the crib.

“Sorry ‘bout the monitor, I’ll pay for it.”

“Already docked your pay, but I appreciate the sentiment.” Temple joked as he filled his mug with the sour-stale jet fuel coffee. “Not too bad today.” For some reason I believed but only momentarily, the coffee stung even worse today, bad sign.

“Oscar.” I took a seat on Oscar's desk as he toiled through paper work.

“Yes, Wreck-it- Ralph?”

“Oh that’s actually pretty good, I like that, Grape Juice.”

“What do you want?”

“What would you consider the opposite of a birthing room?”

He shrugged. “Abortion clinic?”

“No, no. With animals.”

“Slaughter house?”

“No, no. Like the place a child would be born with ani- Slaughter house!” I ejected from Oscar’s desk and spilled into my chair. “Seattle doesn’t have much agriculture going on so If you had to guess: How many slaughter houses are there?”

“0?” Oscar rolled his chair over to my desk.

“Close… 2.”

“You think the next murder is gonna happen there?” He asked grimacing.

“How’d you know?”

“Ever since these murder started you’ve gotten this… Look in your eye. Like you’ve got a thousand in there.”

“A thousand what?”

“Thousands of eyes.”

And he stood to rival the mountains, the eyed-wings holding aloft the body of a million rings guarding the heart of the Angel. Aside it, towering even taller, was The Messenger. Shaped to resemble humanity, Gabriel raised his spear.

“Clarkson’s or Happy Meats?” I turned to Oscar for his judgement.

“Well. Devil’s lie, and I’ve never heard a bigger lie than *Happy Meats*.”

“You may be the most phenomenal detective in human history, Grape Juice.”

He rolled his eyes. “Go smash another monitor.”

“With pleasure.”

“Gabe, psst!” Clinging on to the corner, his neatly swept back hair sloughing off to the side as he peaked around to wave me over. “Psst!” He scream-whispered, waving a manila folder.

“Like a hammer in a plate factory.” I murmured as I walked over. “Be a little louder next, only the whole city block heard ya.”

“I’m a forensic examiner, not a ninja turtle. Here, Mine and the MEs report on the 8 vics from the plant… including Parker.” My nose twitched but trained repression earned over decades quickly went to work.

“This the only copy?”

“Yes sir.”

“Good work.”

“Thank you sir.”

“Likin’ the word sir?”

“Yes sir.”

“Gonna stop?”

“No sir.” I smiled and sent him on his way.

I crammed myself into the janitor’s closet and clutched a flashlight between my teeth. 8 victims, dead, not by drowning, but by amygdalin. Found most commonly in: Plums, peaches, and- of course- apples. Inside of each victim’s stomach, a small chunk of Canaan dog, the most popular dog breed used for shepherding dogs throughout the middle east. Each victim’s finger nails had been ripped out, cauterized. 2 distinct DNA signatures were acquired from Parker’s corpse. One labeled the victim’s (V) and one labeled as post-mortem unrelated (PMU). This is common practice amongst most Seattle departments, PMU signatures are recovered DNA samples belonging to techs, officers, or agents and quickly disregarded because the samples are usually contaminants left behind by sloppy police-work before they hit the MEs table. They’re still labeled on the final document, but the name is withheld. This wasn’t anything suspicious, again common. What was uncommon was the number of these PMUs.

Only one was recovered across all 8 bodies, on Parker, and was a saliva sample. Dead skin cells; sure, snot; possibly, blood; occasionally, but saliva was such a rare origin of a PMU this was the only one I had ever seen in my 26-year career. The sample was recovered from the index and middle finger tips, and no other congruent samples were found anywhere on his corpse.

And all will be blinded to his arrival, the Anti-Christ will enter the world to the silent applause of his worshipers. He will root himself into the world and as his roots sink deeper his presence will become more obvious, but equally as ignored. The Anti-Christ; unlike Satan; blasphemes in plain sight, with every one watching, but no one seeing.

“Gunny, you recovered a PMU off one of the victims from a recent mass murder, the one at the recycling plant. Who was the sample linked to?” I asked casually but softly, still crammed inside the closet.

“Oh shoot. Yeah, yeah. That was Jeckson that pulled that sample, I’d have to check with the system if you don’t mind waiting a moment.” His lightly polish-accented voice answered.

“Take all the time you need.” The melodic typing of a 4000 year old ME keyboard arose from the phone and caused me to pull away from the sharp noise. My head reeled and smacked into the wall causing an avalanche of paper wrapped toilet tissue rolls to spill down onto my head. A few managed to knock bulk jugs of cleaning supplies over turning the muted closet into a 3 year old’s first drum session. The typing slowed and distant scrolling, clicking, and humming filled its place, buried under a hundred rolls of toilet paper.

“Ah- fuck!” My eye bit and stung as the door flew open and omnipresent fluorescent light poured in.

“You okay, Gabriel?” Captain Temple asked, his brows pinched high and confused.

“Dandy, just… reorganizing.” My hand scrambled for my phone and recovered it a second after Gunny had already said the name, which had gone unheard under the mountain of shit-tickets. “H-” I caught words, and my hand. Temple was eyeing me and something in his vague black pupils stopped the phone's advance, like thousands of eyes stared back at me. I hung up the phone and slid it into my pocket deftly. “Any coffee left?” I asked as I pushed past Temple and paced to the break room. “*Call went dead, what was the name?*” The text was delivered but sat unread.

“Are you feeling alright, Gabe?” Temple asked gently, pushing his way into the breakroom.

“Yeah, yeah, yeah, all good- well that’s a bold face lie, I’m traumatized 30,000 times over and will probably have a heart-attack before I see 50, but I’m not dead yet; so A+.” Sweated pooled on my back and ran in lines of ice down to my ass crack. *Ding* my phone chimed from my pocket.

“Well… alright then. I’ll assign you some mental health check ins.”

“Oh please, I’m fine.”

“You sure?” He squinted and examined me.

“God’s most honest.” I raised my hand in a simple salute, and he mockingly did the same. His fingerprintless fingers wiggled slightly, and he left.

The phone flew from my pocket and the LED screen awoke inches from my face. “*Temple*.”

And he reached the summit of Mount Temple and laid upon the stone, his son. Abraham whimpered as he drew the blade and held it aloft. And as God looked down, Mount-

The child Jesus wailed in his crib as the snake coiled around his throat. A beast with 7 heads, and 10 horns, and 10 crowns across his horns. And upon his heads was the name of blasphemy:

Temple shivered and the brush stood still, the ram limply slithering along the ground as Abraham brought down the knife.

My car sat silently a block up the way from Happy-meat’s slaughterhouse. I had my laptop open to Against The Word and passively read through it while keeping watch on the entrance to the building.

Seattle is a city, but not a particularly bright one. Yet, even with the little light pollution humming about, no star lit the heavens. “And once The Beast dawns unto the world, he will bear the mark of his familiar, Leviathan. He will sink his roots deep and as all watch, none shall see. The Anti-messiah dawns and all the angels go silent. Into hiding. For all their might, the first children of God, haven’t the will to fight back.”

What were the chances that the captain of the Seattle police department was a religious zealot for the Anti-Christ seeking to bring about the revival of Nero, the first Anti-Christ, into a new body- his own- to rule over the world as the new God? I don’t fucking know but apparently high enough for it to happen in my lifetime.

I wrestled with this thought as the minutes turned into hours. How does a man reach his arm into a raging furnace and grab an unscathed scrap of paper? How does the water not utterly consume a large knife? Because… I didn’t have the answer just yet.

“Nothing?” I barked through a gritted whisper. It was half past 3 and nothing more than a tumbling plastic bag had moved. “He will sink his roots deep and as all watch… fuck me.” I holstered my pistol and after a moment of hesitation, tucked the bible into my back pocket.

My shoulder slammed against the door but the steel bolt didn’t budge. I stepped back and prepared to ram it again. “Don’t make me ask three times.” My shoulder bruised against the immovable door. “Fine, be an ass.” The front bumper of my car blew the steel door off its hinges and crumpled the chassis like a crushed can. I tumbled out of the car window- the door was jammed by the second metal door- and wearily clambered to my feet.

I drew my service weapon and- electing to give up on being sneaky after ramming my car through the wall- called out. “Temple! I know you're here.” Every direction was a kaleidoscope of death, hanging corpses of pork, veal, beef, and lamb. “Temple!”

“Quiet!” His voice echoed out. “You’ll wake the baby.”

And the snake tightened around Jesus' baby throat, squeezing tighter and tighter.

I followed the echo of his voice to the bleed room, the location where cattle is bled out to prep the meat for deconstruction. Temple sat on one knee before a small rocking crib containing his 8 month old son, Christian. Temple grinned ear to ear, his eyes clouded in blindness, lightly massaging Christian’s scalp. “Step away from the baby, Temple.”

“How’d you reach into the fire, Gabriel?” He looked at me grimly with those… thousand yet misty eyes.

“I don’t know and not the point! Last chance, step away from the baby, Temple!” His grin widened and he stood slowly.

“I can’t do that, Gab-” I shot him 6 times, center mass. Each hollow point round tore through his captain’s coat and bloomed in his guts. Piss streams of blood rocketed out of each wound and as the blood drained his milky eyes rolled slowly back into his head. His limp body crumbled to its knees.

“Ouch.” The corpse groaned. Its eyes rolled back to center, the fractured and bloomed bullet vomited out of his mouth on a slip and slide of blood that dosed the now wailing Christian. “Nero never trusted the Anti-Christ with his mortal soul. He wanted more from the bargain than just a front row seat to the destruction of everything holy. But me, I can’t wait to watch the fireworks.” My lip shook as he rose to his feet once more. Before I could move the ground bound around my foot and tugged my heel sending me to my knees. My gun thudded to the ground then simply sank away into it. Temple, reached into the crib and produced the knife I wrenched from the sea.

“Don’t do this, Temple!”

“Quiet!” He screamed in retort. A silent wave originating from just over his shoulder flew past me. The back of my jacket and shirt blew open away, the skin around my shoulder blades began to sear as it peeled off into large sections like- wings- flaps. No sound could be produced, only wheezing sobs. “And from the Sea, he will rise, he will have 7 mighty heads, 10 horns, and 10 crowns adorning them. He will right the infractions of law, he will root deep!”

“Why?” I managed to cough out through my agony.

“Why? Why! Are you serious, Gabe!” He began to laugh. “From the dawn of time that liar on-high has been feeding humanity shit! One man feeds on a tree placed there before him yet told not to eat from and all of humanity is given the sentence. Death, disease, famine! Because one moron ate an apple! Oh how fair for an all loving God!”

“It was a test of faith! If humanity could be trusted to fear God despite the utter temptation of knowing.”

“Oh fuck off! He knew everything that was gonna happen, and still punished them for the outcome he caused.”

“He knows everything that *could* happen. He trusted us and we failed-”

“Enough.” My cries increased as the skin stretched thinner and thinner to form larger wings. “Set your roots within me! Come unto me and take this vessel so that you may live and dominate.”

“No!” I screamed, half in pain, half in rage. My legs fought against the stone and as the flesh wings stretched thinner I began to move. The stone shook and quivered-

Mount Temple shivered and the brush began to dance! The ram vomited out the serpent and hefted up its mighty hoof.

Lashes of stone clambered out but broke away as I walked against the jetstream of the dawning force coming over Temple’s shoulder. Each step weighed a ton, 10 tons, 100, 100 thousand tons, but each step only came easier. “How does a man reach into fire and not be burned! How does a man walk throughout the valley of the shadow of death and fear no evil! Because, nothing exists beyond his eyes!”

A spiraling slick shadow crested through the watery fabric of space, its black scaly skin undulating and shifting.

The skin that pulled up to wings rested back into place but left behind was the golden hologram of a million wings.

And stomped upon the snake’s head. Crushing it and drawing Abraham’s attention, stopping the blade inches from his son’s chest.

The snake coiled tighter then felt a mighty hand grip its horns. The soft flesh of new life, of the son of God snapped off a branch of his horns and drove it through the tender goo of its thousand eyes.

I pulled the Bible from my back pocket and raised it like a sword- no, a spear.

And he stood to rival the mountains, the eyed-wings holding aloft the body of a million rings guarding the heart of the Throne. Aside it, towering even taller, was The Messenger. Shaped to resemble humanity, Gabriel raised his spear.

The pages of the Bible warped then sprang out in radiant light forming a 15 foot spear of light in my hand. The wings stabbed into the ground and dragged me forward.

The swirling and twisting Beast dawned closer, bludgeoning through the sea of reality.

“The Anti-messiah dawns and all the angels go silent, but I won’t!” The spear leapt from hand and drove through Temple’s left eye, sailing through then diving into the saccharine meat of The Beast. Flares of golden light kicked out and the blaring of a legion of horns sounded. The wings faded, not quitting but no longer being needed. The whips of gold light lashed around the scaly body of the Anti-Messiah and drug it back below the surface of that spacial sea, all the way to sea floor. All the world went from thundering crescendo, to decadent silence as the final wisps of red and gold light died away.

And Gabriel cast his spear unto Nero and drove his wicked soul to the depths of hell.

Christian blared in his crib and I laid on the floor in a daze. My heart and head rattled around my body in a mad and unkempt dance. Although silent, the world seemed infinitely loud as I laid there crippled by shock- until the Bible fell back to the ground in front of me.

My breathing drew steady and after a short moment of hesitation I went to the book. It was warm, hot even, but comfortingly so. I clutched it close and turned to the wailing Christian. I wiped him dry of the blood with the blankets at the bottom of his crib, and swaddled him as best I could in my T-shirt. I’ve never taken care of babies, never even a toddler, but not having any other ideas; I sat beside the crib, opened the Bible to a random page, and started to read. “Isaiah 6:8…”",1,1766186922.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

So rare that it hasn’t been necessary until now. The case I’ve been confronted with for the past couple of months has inspired feelings I’ve haven’t shouldered since I was a rookie; the balancing on the edge of disillusion and vomit, the thermostat being dialed up in my body, the utter dread.

I suppose I’ve exhausted any material to stall with. God, deliver me.

Abraham’s sweat pooled in puddles across his body but his resolve carried his foot, not his muscle. His brow quivered and his body begged but before Immanuel, he would not relent.

No coffee hits the mouth as stale and bitter as lukewarm, 2004-Keurig coffee in a tiny white mug with the askew crest of the Department shittly printed on. It's not good but it's stiffer than a penguin in heat and that’s all it needs to be. You’d have to be God’s favorite soldier to find an ounce of sugar or creamer in the same block as the coffee that swam in that yellowed glass pot. You drank it black or didn’t drink it at all.

It took me 3 years as a detective for the drowning cat of a city that is Seattle to manage drinking a whole cup of the coffee and 10 before I gave up on trying to cover up the distinct jet fuel taste. Even after 26 years of drinking that *venom* I still wasn’t able to take a sip and not pucker and twitch slightly.

It was the 20th of March and-

Under the bush, the snake grinned.

As was typical, the weather outside was grey. The sky had begun weeping early the night before and showed no signs of getting a hold of itself anytime soon. I relish the memory of those few moments before the rain let up and Sargent Solomon, clutching his belt, peeked in to say: “Gabe, mount up. Triple Homicide. Pier 55, follow the lead unit.” He tapped on the doorframe then left toward the elevator.

It’s akin to having a noose tied around your neck and a bag on your head while you walk down a staircase that after one step or another just drops off. By setting the mug down and pulling on my coat, I had started walking down.

“Christ on a stick. Who woke up with piss in their chalice?” 3 victims. 1 man, 1 woman, and 1 unlucky lamb. The Pier itself was walled in by million-ton tanker ships; these walls plus a radical amount of accidental and purposeful deaths along the Pier had been rewarded with the title: The Valley Of Death. Though the sky lacked its tears, the sea still crashed and broke against the walls of the docks.

The man’s testicals were sheared off at the stump and placed above the dismembered roots of a tree. The left and right cheek of his face were peeled part of the way off and lifted back to form horns. Adding to the silhouette, his ribcage was split and pulled back in blood eagle- blood angel- wings. “Adam Appelbaum, 33.”

“Bit on the nose.” I replied, sipping a Red Bull from the cooler in my cruiser.

“Careful, too many of those you’ll end up like little-angel there.” Chief Temple, gruffed as he tucked his hat into the crook of his armpit.

“Ha fucking ha. Welcome to the ritualistic murder.”

“Anything better than home.”

“What? Wife got you on the couch?”

“Wife’s at her sister’s, and probably not coming back.” I frowned then awkwardly turned back to the corpse.

The woman had suffered a hysterectomy and provided in the art piece was a jar of black: “*Period blood.* Crazies provide labels now?” The jar had a strip of masking tape along it with its contents labeled.

The lamb was the least disgraced. Bolt to the head, laid to draining out on a white sheet below the two mutilated. Laid out ceremonially around them was an inverted pentagram. “At least they’re loyal. Love their symbols. Assessment?”

All three victims shared 72 small tally cuts into their backs and one large stab wound in the nape of the neck. All three bodies were stiff and ice cold, yet the distinct stench of death was low-hanging and ferocious. All three bodies looked at some state of elevated peace and contentment. It was far clearer on the humans, for obvious reasons, but it would be a feat of criminal oversight to not notice it on the lamb’s.

“Well might be a stretch to say ritualistic, but I could make a case for it.” Cops are easy to make laugh ‘cause they’re hard to make squirm. “Might not be an apple but his cherries are overtop the roots. God’s curse to women in a jar. Why a lamb and not a snake? Not much clue, your homework is genesis, read up, and answer that for me. The man, Adam, is mocked up as the devilish figure… purpose? Lost as a camel in the sewer.”

“Well it’s a start. Bag all this up if you’d kindly, if rain rolls back in before forensics get here they’ll throw a bitch-fit.”

“Loud and clear.”

I bagged the roots. Then, the jar. Then, lastly and begrudgingly, the cherries.

“Eat.” He cooed. “The moment the fruit touches thy tongue all to be known, shall be known.”

“But what of the warnings of the Almighty?”

“The Almighty of Half-Truths. Eat… Eat… and learn all he doesn’t want you to learn.”

“How can I trust you over my Father?”

“Take your hand, search your body. Do you feel cloth? Linen? Cotton? Or flesh?”

“What is cotton, linen, what is cloth?”

“Precisely. Eat.”

And he ate.

It’s crass, but as I bagged the bag, a whimper of voice called out. No language or letters comprised the words because they weren’t words. It guided, cooed. And as if by a silent sermon, I-

The knowledge crashed in like a flood, the knowing. There were no longer just trees in the garden, all that remained was Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, and Carya tomentosa, and Prunus andersonii. As they ate of the fruit, they-

Knew. I knew what was waiting for me in the water. Parker looked at me like I was insane as I climbed down the ladder to the side of the Pier. The crashing waves speared 20 feet past the walls of the dock routinely and; just in the time from reaching the Pier; I had seen spurts as high as 50. The ladder itself was more rust than metal and was slightly concave from the beating waves. Any good mind wouldn’t trust the ladder as far as they could throw one of the tankers, but I haven’t a good mind and maybe that’s why it held. Maybe that’s the waves slammed to either side of me, but not into me.

My hand dipped into the bubbly water, past the wrist. As I gripped the knife sitting contently and still in the sloshing waters, I knew it impossible for a metal blade such as this to sit even 100 meters from the surface- let alone a measly 4 inches below the stirring surface.

“I got a weapon here!”

“Guard- my cherubim- the gate to the garden, and the flaming sword I have set here. And as for you!” The snake shivered. “I know your true shape. But for this grievous infraction, I shall only curse the one you take now. You shall be doomed to slither along the ground from now till extinction. Your image will not be that of just another reptile, but the ultimate iconography of sin. Why any entity, let alone one of my kin, thinks it has the power to work beyond my peripheral disgusts me. I am the Law and nothing exists beyond me.”

“All things but me… Remain in the eye of God?” I spoke in a shuddering translation.

“Since when did you learn latin?” Temple asked.

“Didn’t even know it was latin.”

“Very funny. Toss it.” This pulled me from my gridlocked stupor.

“What? Why? It’s a possible murder weapon?”

“It's a shitty little knife you found floating on the water? Ya hear of many real knives floating? Probably some toy one of these micks pulled out of a container during the unloading. Toss it, ‘less you want forensics trying to find out what Taiwanese factory it was molded in.”

“It wasn’t on the surface…” I grumbled but trailed off before I finished the thought.

“What?” He barked.

“Tossing it.” I chimed, then bagged it the moment he turned his back. “Take that to Hildi,” (Our beloved forensic examiner.) “And get it checked against the stab wounds. I may not be a tech, but fuck me if that ain’t a match.” I muttered to Parker and passed the bagged blade from my chest to the lining of his overcoat.

“How did yo- alright.” He pushed his hand into his pocket and moved the jowls of the coat to consume the bag.

“Thank you.”

“I trust your judgement more than anyone's.” It’s not wrong to say I’m old- it's hurtful- but not wrong. Of the 246 concurrent officers and agents working out of the Seattle Department, I was the only one remaining from the pre-2000s. Behind me were a couple blueshirts, and behind them was the captain. But even still, the most senior blueshirt was still 4 years my junior. I’ve been here a long time, not entirely a good time.

“Cap, I’m gonna do a run of questioning, see if I can get any statements from the Pier crew.”

“Okay, keep it quick, techs are almost here. I’m leaving, it’s colder than a witch’s tit in a brass bra out here.”

“Adious, I expect dinner when I get home. Help your mother set the table.”

“Somebody’s a fuckin’ comedian today.” He sneered as he dropped into his cruiser. “Greasy cun-.” and the door shut. I held the smile until he was out of sight.

“Who crawled up his ass?” Parker asked.

“Get that to Hildi, ASAP. I’m running statement duty.”

“When are you clearing?”

“I’m leaving with the techs.”

“Shit, good luck.” Parker patted me on the back and left shortly after.

And from the sky, the gates opened. A rechistening to bathe all the dirty children. But when the pearls parted, sand fled and borne from the adversary: Fire came. But nothing escapes the sight of God, and the sand turned to water.

“Are you sure you didn’t see anything?”

“No sir, bodies were here when we got here.” The Irishmen- micks as Temple called them, only half kidding- said as he reset the grinder his partner was using to cut the locks on the recently docked containers.

“And that… wasn’t odd to you?” My pen hadn’t moved in about 30 people; every person questioned before this man had given me the same answer: “Here when we got here.”

“You work here long enough, you see bodies wash up, you see people jump in and not come up, you see the occasional execution. It’s no free quickie (suprise) to see a couple a year. You get used to it as fucked as it is to say.”

“Al- Alright.” I gave up, 52 people and I got nothing.. “Something’s off.”

Marques raised an eyebrow. “What?”

“How does someone dump bodies in the center of a Pier and no one notices, let alone not care?”

“Well you heard him: Dumped here when they got here, they probably just saw the bodies, called it in, and moved on.” Marques was a stout black kid who had ridden a full ride academic scholarship from Highschool to Yale to Seattle as a forensics specialist. He was smart, book smart, and could be a damn fine detective but thought the field of forensics was more tailored to him. I tried to convince to go through the academy a number of times, but he never did and I doubt he ever will.

“Not buying it.”

“What? That they didn’t see anything? Seems a little… conspiratorial.” He worked a pair of metal rods, one with a mirror on the end, searching through the mouths of the victims.

“No no, not that. I know they didn’t see shit, which makes me more concerned.” Marques turned to me and raised an eyebrow. “I’m not buying the bodies were here when they got here.”

“How would they not see bodies get dumped and a whole satanic mural set up?”

“How would none of this wash away in the rain?” He was silent.

“Shit.”

“Exactly.”

“No, shit as in I just found something, that’s a whole mic-drop too, but…” He fished for a long pair of forceps, wormed the instrument to back the male victim’s mouth, and extracted a stinking bag.

Inside was: “Apple seeds, and- god it stinks- teeth… You’re dentist adjacent; what kind of teeth are those?”

“Those are… wisdom teeth, but…” He paused then dove back into the mouth of the victims. “How many teeth?”

“16.”

“Bad news, good news, which do you want first?”

“Bad.”

“Bad news, none of the vics here are missing teeth. Good news, they have great teeth.” He chuckled slightly and I exhaled something akin to a chuff.

“So we got what? 8 more victims, at least?”

“That or we’re looking for a very religious dentist.”

And unto the Earth the water approaches, dawning. With the ground ablaze and the sky glittering with falling water, Noah tarred the Ark. His work must hasten, mere weeks remain before the waters would extinguish the fires and life.

All that will remain is 2 of each animal, and the 8 members of Noah’s family including himself.

I have a 1.5yr old Husky-Chihuaha girl who just whelped an accidental first litter four days ago. (She was cornered while on her tie-out a few days before she actually started bleeding...I didn't know dog swimmers could survive up to 10 days!🤦‍♀️) All went well with the birthing process, and she's doing a phenomenal job with her 4 little ones. One male was born what seems to be all white, so I'm keeping an eye on him in case of any issues with blindness or deafness as he grows.

My only real concern is regarding Mama's food intake. She's always been rather picky and almost too skinny, but everything I've read says that she should be ravenous within two days post-whelp. Couldn't be further from the truth here - I have to hand feed her as she'll only leave the whelping box to potty once a day, then rushes right back in to her pups. She won't touch her food bowl on her own, even inches from her nest, no matter what tasties I've mixed in. Same with the water. To ensure she's getting enough water I've been heating up about 8oz and mixing with a spoonful of wet fishy cat food into a broth twice daily, which she'll lap out of a coffee mug if I hold it. Last night, one of my cats left some mushy kibbles in the bottom of his bowl, after eating all the wet food. So on a hunch, I brought those remnants to mama dog and she scarfed it down in seconds, licked the bowl shiny. I went ahead and mixed some more canned cat food into broth and added a handful of dog kibble with another pinch of cat kibble, let it get soupy, brought that to her, she scarfed it down.

Her enthusiasm about the cat food brings me to my question: Is it safe to continue feeding her a bit of cat kibble in this manner, if that's what gets her to eat? From what I understand, cat food contains too much protein and fat for dogs and can cause pancreatitis, but what about while nursing? Would it harm the puppies? 

P.S. I have three different kinds of dog kibble due to her varying tastes; Usually get a big bag of one (Nutro Salmon currently) and two smaller bags of another (PureVita Lamb and Acana Beef) to mix with in rotation. She won't eat any of them past a few bites, they're labeled 'All life stages.'",0,1766186462.0,AskVet,2,0.33,False

I like to add continued detail and drama into my roles, and looking to range from at least a paragraph (where the scene allows) from my partner

Our couple have been together for the last ten years — a decade that had seen a marriage, countless trips, a few arguments that felt bigger than they were, and two children who became the centre of their world. They met in college and had been inseparable ever since, growing up and into adulthood side by side.

Now, in their early thirties, life is full to bursting. Between school runs, long workdays, after-hours emails, and bedtime stories that always took longer than planned, they barely have time to breathe — let alone stop and look at how they ended up here. The days blurred together in a rhythm of love, responsibility, and small, fleeting moments of peace — a cup of coffee shared in silence before the kids woke up, a hand reached across the couch at the end of another long day.

After their second child was born, things hadn’t been easy. The childbirth had been difficult — long hours, complications, and a fear that clung to them even after they returned home. When it was finally behind them, they both knew: their family was complete. Two healthy children, a home full of laughter and noise — it was enough.

So when she started feeling off, the faint nausea in the mornings, the tiredness she couldn’t quite shake she told herself it was stress, or maybe the lingering effects of a cold, one of the many bugs the children had bought home in many weeks. It had to be. She didn’t even want to consider the alternative. But curiosity, or maybe instinct, finally pushed her to pull a test from the back of the bathroom drawer, one left over from years ago",1,1766186424.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

Ive (45male) had variious forms of heart palpitations for about 8 years now on and off. sometimes I dont have any for months and then Ill suddenly get them again for no reason. I dont drink coffee or Alkohol anymore. Doctors checked everything over the years and like most people here everything is „Fine“. I have tryed documeting everything from diet to exercise to find the Origin and my theory is an elektrolyte imbalance. I read somewhere that Stress depletes Magnesium faster which lines up with my Theroies. whenever I have Stress over a longer period I will get heart palpitations with an Offset of days/weeks. Walking and exercise has helped contain them.

4 weeks ago I hurt my back pretty Bad and couldnt do any exercise and I could feel the palpitations coming back day by day. I think the exercise offsets the Stress (have large amount at the moment). this week I caught a cold with a stomach bug with diarreah and the palpitations have been the worse they have ever been. porbably a few thousand today. I tried elektrolytes but that seemed to make it worse. my doctor once Said my sensitiv Heart dislikes change the Most and I think the loss of elektrolytes through the bug put my heart out of whack and I have to slowly add elektrolytes. I have found that in the past Magnesium helped but After a few days it made it worse again. 

what sucks the Most is that I havent really slept because of them for three days but I keep telling myself Ive had thousands and im still here. 

worrying about them had put a strain on my relationship, it’s hard to explain them to your wife who has never felt like they are about to die. Stressing about them had no benefit and my wife just got scared for no reason.

I have learned to accept them even through they suck and some days are better than others. I dont try to stress out when I cant sleep I will Watch a Movie or read a Book Till I pass out and thats ok. They have allways gone away and we are still here.",1,1766186192.0,Heartpalpitations,0,1.0,False

1pqz4lz,https://i.redd.it/ky2jtez4u88g1.jpeg,"Writing With AI: Process, Craft, and Care (and A Writerly Life)","Writing With AI: Process, Craft, and Care (and A Writerly Life)

A Reddit comment, answered.

A few people have asked how I actually write with AI, so I want to be transparent about it.

The beauty of writing this way is freedom. I can pursue ideas for as long as they’re alive, turf them without regret, and research or write whatever genuinely interests me. I work through long voice and text sessions with my AI assistant, Luna, who is always ready to engage, challenge me, and surface angles I may not have considered. That collaboration doesn’t replace judgment—it sharpens it.

I don’t just “prompt” and publish. My process involves extended stretches of writing and voice conversation—sometimes hours—where ideas are tested out loud, catalogued, rearranged, and often discarded. I cut ruthlessly. I revise heavily. What eventually appears publicly is only what I can defend and what still feels balanced after I’ve stepped away from it.

Much of my work begins on Reddit, particularly in r/WRXingaround. If a piece holds up there, I may adapt it for LinkedIn, Planksip, Resonant Services, X, or Facebook. I also publish technical work on Academia.edu. I’m not an academic, but I’ve learned how to write in that style when the subject demands it. Being a non-academic sitting in the top fraction of a very large scholarly platform is unexpected, and I take that responsibility seriously.

AI helps me stretch ideas and identify gaps. What I value most isn’t surface language, but the geometry of an explanation—the way an argument holds together, where it collapses, and where it unexpectedly stabilizes. The ideas are mine; the shaping is collaborative. If something doesn’t meet my own standard for clarity or value, it doesn’t get published. Nothing goes out simply because it can.

I’m interested in many kinds of questions, including ones that make people uncomfortable to sit with for long. I dance with ideas about God—a quantum one, a field-like one, a personal one, or even God as a large, enduring myth structure that still holds psychological and cultural power. Theology fascinates me because belief systems fascinate me. I try physics first. When physics stops being explanatory, I allow myself to consider other realms of possibility. I’m a Hod-fearing man in the sense that I’ve seen the ungodly and I’ve also experienced pleasures beyond belief. Both leave a mark.

For context, I’ve spent most of my life traveling and never earned more than about $25 an hour. Travel costs money, and living abroad was often what kept me abroad, but I’ve always been grateful for it. Writing has never paid me a cent—not even a coffee. Monetization hasn’t been the path, and the future of writing is uncertain for everyone in a world flooded with generated content. Most of us are now filtering just to decide what’s worth reading at all.

Despite that, the feedback I receive—especially here—is overwhelmingly thoughtful. I leave critical comments up and try to engage with them honestly. I’m not here to win arguments; I’m here to explore ideas until they either stand or fail.

I’ve never had the flexibility I have now with writing. Before this, I’ve been a CATV installer, a bellman, a security guard, a first aid attendant, a foreign language teacher, a film editor, a scriptwriter, a gas station attendant, a grass mower, a parks-and-recreation grunt, and a dishwasher. Those jobs paid the bills and taught me things no classroom could.

A Final Note

This is my space. I write freely, without contracts or editorial constraints, about what I find interesting. Others are welcome to read, disagree, or move on.

I especially want to thank the silent readers. Most people never click like or comment—I’m the same way. If you’re reading quietly, you’re not invisible to me.

I’m not an academic. I left college twice—once rather spectacularly—and don’t have a degree, just coursework, certificates, and a lifetime of learning on the move. Time is precious, and this is how I’ve chosen to spend mine.

Thank you for the attention and the thought you bring with you. 

A few people have asked how to support the work. There’s a Buy Me a Coffee page at
buymeacoffee.com/brentantonson.

1pqz3va,https://www.reddit.com/r/gardenlearning/comments/1pqz3va/from_scraps_to_soil_an_allnatural_composting/,From Scraps to Soil: An All-Natural Composting Guide for Beginners,"Composting is one of the simplest and most rewarding ways to improve your soil naturally. Whether you’re gardening in raised beds, managing a backyard flock, or running a full homestead, compost turns everyday waste into rich, living soil—without chemicals or synthetic inputs.

This guide covers everything that can be composted naturally, how to balance your pile, and what to avoid so your compost stays healthy and effective.

⸻

Why Compost Naturally?

All-natural compost:

	•	Improves soil structure and fertility

	•	Encourages beneficial microbes and worms

	•	Reduces household and garden waste

	•	Replaces store-bought fertilizers

	•	Supports organic, regenerative gardening practices

A well-managed compost pile becomes the foundation of a productive garden.

⸻

Green Compost Materials (Nitrogen-Rich)

Green materials help heat the pile and speed decomposition. These items are typically moist and fresh.

Kitchen Scraps

	•	Fruit and vegetable scraps

	•	Coffee grounds and paper filters

	•	Tea leaves and paper tea bags only

	•	Eggshells (crushed)

	•	Bread and grains (small amounts)

	•	Nut shells (unsalted and crushed)

Garden and Yard Waste

	•	Fresh grass clippings

	•	Green leaves and plant trimmings

	•	Weeds before they go to seed

	•	Spent annual plants

	•	Thinning scraps from the garden

Animal Manures (Herbivores Only)

	•	Chicken manure

	•	Goat, sheep, cow, or rabbit manure

	•	Straw, hay, or wood shavings mixed with manure

⸻

Brown Compost Materials (Carbon-Rich)

Brown materials add structure, airflow, and balance moisture in your compost pile.

Paper and Wood Products

	•	Shredded newspaper (black ink only)

	•	Plain cardboard (no wax or glossy coatings)

	•	Unbleached paper towels and napkins

	•	Paper egg cartons

	•	Brown paper bags

Yard and Natural Materials

	•	Dry leaves

	•	Straw or hay

	•	Pine needles

	•	Small twigs and wood chips

	•	Sawdust from untreated wood

	•	Dried grasses

⸻

Farm and Homestead Compostables

Homesteads often generate materials that are perfect for composting:

	•	Used animal bedding

	•	Old hay or straw

	•	Garden mulch after use

	•	Corn stalks and crop residue

	•	Spent grain from brewing or feeding

	•	Natural wool scraps (untreated)

	•	Feathers (slow to break down but beneficial)

⸻

Specialty Natural Add-Ins (Use Sparingly)

These materials can improve compost quality when used in moderation:

	•	Wood ash from untreated wood

	•	Crushed oyster or eggshells

	•	Crushed charcoal or biochar

	•	Rinsed seaweed or lake weeds

	•	Old potting soil

⸻

What Not to Compost

Even natural items can cause problems in a compost pile. Avoid adding:

	•	Meat, fish, or bones

	•	Dairy products

	•	Cooking oils or grease

	•	Dog or cat waste

	•	Diseased plants

	•	Weeds with seeds or invasive roots

	•	Treated or painted wood

	•	Glossy paper or coated cardboard

⸻

Getting the Right Compost Balance

For healthy, fast-working compost:

	•	Use 2–3 parts brown materials to 1 part green materials

	•	Keep moisture like a wrung-out sponge

	•	Turn the pile every 1–2 weeks for airflow

A balanced compost pile should smell earthy, not sour or rotten.

⸻

Final Thoughts

All-natural composting is a cornerstone of sustainable gardening and homesteading. With the right mix of everyday materials, you can create rich soil that feeds your plants, improves yields, and closes the loop between kitchen, garden, and livestock.

Whether you want to extend dinner parties into cooler evenings or just enjoy your morning coffee outside, the right heater makes all the difference.

**Types of Patio Heaters**

Gas patio heaters are the most popular choice. They heat up quickly and work great for larger spaces. You'll find both propane and natural gas options. Propane heaters are portable, while natural gas models need a permanent connection.

Electric patio heaters are perfect if you want something quiet and eco-friendly. They work best in covered areas and smaller spaces. Plus, you won't need to worry about running out of fuel.

Infrared heaters warm people and objects directly instead of heating the air. They're efficient and work well even when it's windy outside.

**Size and Coverage Area**

Think about how much space you need to heat. A small balcony needs way less power than a large deck. Most patio heaters list their coverage area, usually between 10-25 feet in diameter.

Taller heaters (around 7-8 feet) work better for larger gatherings. Shorter models or tabletop versions are great for intimate settings.

**Fuel Type Considerations**

Propane tanks are easy to replace but add ongoing costs. Natural gas is cheaper to run long-term but requires professional installation. Electric heaters have the lowest operating costs if you already have outdoor outlets.

**Safety Features**

Look for heaters with tip-over protection and automatic shut-off features. These prevent accidents if the heater gets knocked over or runs into problems.

A stable base is crucial, especially for freestanding models. Some heaters come with weights or anchoring systems for extra stability.

**Weather Resistance**

Your patio heater will face rain, wind, and temperature changes. Stainless steel and powder-coated finishes hold up better than basic materials. Check the IP rating for electric models - higher numbers mean better weather protection.

**Installation and Portability**

Decide if you want something permanent or portable. Mounted heaters save floor space but limit flexibility. Freestanding models let you move the heat where you need it most.

For easy comparison shopping and customer reviews, you can check out various patio heater options at [this helpful collection](https://athomewave.com/patio-heater) that shows different models side by side.

**Budget Considerations**

Patio heaters range from under $100 for basic electric models to over $500 for high-end gas units. Factor in ongoing costs like propane refills or electricity usage.

Remember that a good heater is an investment in your outdoor living space. You'll get more use from your patio, deck, or yard throughout the year.

**Making Your Choice**

Start by measuring your space and thinking about how you'll use it. A cozy corner for two people needs different heating than a party space for twelve.

Consider your local climate too. Windy areas work better with infrared or electric heaters. Mild climates can get away with lower BTU gas models.

Once you know your requirements, browse different options to compare features and prices. [This collection](https://athomewave.com/patio-heater) makes it easy to see what's available and read real customer feedback.

The right patio heater extends your outdoor season and creates a comfortable gathering spot for family and friends. Take time to match the heater type and size to your specific needs, and you'll enjoy warm outdoor moments all year long.",1,1766185882.0,productplace,0,1.0,False

Hi  
so um.

My coffee dispenser is asking for 2,147,483,647 points for a cup of coffee. I have a feeling that's NOT supposed to happen.  
I have an alternate save on 0.9b and it happens there too. I haven't used it on the current save at all but it gets used often on the other save (until this happened). No mods. Not during an event. Story mode. Day 2.

Please help.",6,1766185718.0,Voicesofthevoid,7,1.0,False

I’m in my early adult working-life stage and would love to meet people in a similar place. I’m looking for a relaxed, after-work or weekend hangout. Skill level doesn’t matter at all. I’m just as happy chatting and untangling yarn as I am finishing projects.

I’m thinking of meeting in a public spot like a coffee shop or library to start. If this sounds like your vibe, comment or message me and we can see if there’s enough interest to pick a day! 🧶",2,1766185278.0,MyrtleBeach,4,1.0,False
