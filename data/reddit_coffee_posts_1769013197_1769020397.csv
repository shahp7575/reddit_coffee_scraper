Download my app here: https://elinestable.com/app 

It was my husband who spotted this trend on social media and let’s just say he’s never the last one to volunteer when it comes to eating brownie 😅😍

In the world of hybrid desserts, it seems brownie and tiramisu are officially having their moment.

This is basically a brownie topped with a layer of tiramisu cream… and it’s ridiculously good. Soft, rich, perfectly chocolatey, ultra fudgy, I was instantly obsessed.

Because the brownie needs to be refrigerated once the tiramisu cream is added, it’s important to slightly underbake it. Otherwise, it can become too dense once chilled. I used my sweet potato brownie base, which has been my go-to for years: reliable, naturally fudgy, and deeply chocolatey ✨

For the tiramisu cream, I went with a quicker version so it can be enjoyed the same day (instead of my usual overnight cream). Both work great, this one is just more impatient-friendly 😄

🌱 Brownimisu 

Brownie

\- 650 g sweet potato

\- 120 g dark chocolate

\- 60 g plant-based margarine

\- 75 g all-purpose flour

\- 1 tbsp cornstarch

\- 4 tbsp light brown sugar

\- 1 pinch flaky salt

Tiramisu cream

\- 100 g cashew nuts

\- 85 ml espresso

\- 1 tsp agar-agar

\- 50 g deodorized coconut oil

\- 65 ml plant-based milk

\- 250 ml plant-based yogurt

\- 3 tbsp sugar

To finish

\- 2 tbsp cocoa powder

Instructions

Soak the cashews in water for 2 hours (or boil them for 8 minutes).

Bake the sweet potato (whole, skin on) at 180°C / 355°F for about 1 hour, until very soft.

Melt the dark chocolate. Scoop out the sweet potato flesh and add it to a blender with the melted chocolate and all remaining brownie ingredients. Blend until smooth.

Line a baking pan with parchment paper, pour in the batter, and bake for 22 minutes at 180°C / 355°F (slightly underbaked is key).

For the cream: set aside 2 tbsp of espresso. Heat the remaining coffee with the agar-agar, whisking constantly. Once it boils, pour it into a blender with the cashews, plant milk, and coconut oil. Blend until very smooth.

In a bowl, whisk the plant-based yogurt with the sugar, then add the cashew mixture and whisk again.

Lightly brush the brownie with the reserved espresso. Pour the tiramisu cream on top and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (up to 24 hours).

Dust with cocoa powder, slice, and enjoy 💛",1,1769020265.0,VeganFoodPorn,0,1.0,False

Hi Reddit,

I’m a Montreal-based IT professional with 8+ years of experience, and I’m currently looking for my next challenge. I’m not just looking for a paycheck I’m looking for an employer who operates by their guiding principles and a role where I can make a real impact.

My career has been built on **service**. I’ve occupied almost every service-related role possible, giving me a unique ""360-degree"" view of how technology and people intersect.

**My background includes:**

* **Infrastructure & Cloud:** Specialized in Microsoft 365, Azure AD (Entra ID), and Intune/Endpoint management.
* **Data Centers & Hardware:** Experience as a Data Center Technician, handling site security, compliance, and asset management.
* **Support Mastery:** Everything from high-volume call centers (Team Lead roles) to in-house technical support for government contractors and big retail players.
* **Leadership & Grit:** I’ve been a Shift Supervisor/Assistant Manager for a world-renowned coffee chain I know how to handle a ""rush,"" manage a team, and keep customers happy under extreme pressure.

**Roles I’ve crushed in the past:**

* In-house Technical Support Specialist
* Procedure Analyst & Change Management Specialist
* Customer Success / Experience Lead
* Team Lead (Call Center environments)
* Data Center Technician (Compliance & Security)
* Shift Supervisor (Food & Retail)

**Why me?** I don’t just ""fix"" things; I take ownership. I love thinking outside the box to find creative ways to gain efficiency, improve workflows, and automate the boring stuff (PowerShell/Python). I bring the discipline of a business owner/freelance with the hands-on empathy of a front-line service worker.

I am fully bilingual (FR/EN), technically certified (AZ-900, Cisco CyberOps), and ready to start immediately.

**RENO, NEVADA /** [**ACCESS Newswire**](https://www.accessnewswire.com/) **/ January 21, 2026 /** The Board of Directors of Brookmount Gold is pleased to update shareholders on the progress being made at the Company's subsidiary North American Gold's (""NAG"") MooseHorn Gold Project.

The MooseHorn Gold Project located in Yukon; Canada consists of approximately 10,643 acres and includes 234 quartz mineral claims. The property's geological settings are very similar to the extremely productive locations nearby; Coffee Creek, Pogo and Fort Knox. The most recent NI 43-101 prepared by Stantec Group, confirmed inferred resources of 39,040 ounces of gold, which at current market prices, equates to approximately $190 million. NAG has ordered an update to the existing NI 43-101 and expects its completion in the coming days.

NAG is completing the positioning of heavy equipment on site including excavators, dozers and dump trucks during the winter months while march access roads are frozen solid. The Moose Horn Gold Project is equipped with established camp facilities, light vehicles including pickup trucks and ATVs and a current fuel inventory of over 37,000 gallons. Most importantly, the property has a reliable water source, and all needed water licenses are in place.

MooseHorn's historical gold production is impressive with approximately 65,640 ounces of placer gold produced since 1978. It's No.1 vein sampling in 1993 averaging 2.2oz per ton. A 24-ton bulk sample from V1 returned 1.8oz per ton. These results and more confirm the presence of ""high grade"" gold bearing quartz veins.

Errin Kimball, Chief Geologist of North American Gold, commented: ""With the pre-positioning of the of all the heavy equipment and needed materials on site and planning the first runs in the early spring, I am very excited to see the first bucket of ore hit the hooper. We are positioning this Company to be a powerhouse in the Gold Mining community, with the Moose Horn Gold Project to start production in the spring with our 2 Alaskan properties to follow.""",1,1769020052.0,Pennystock,0,1.0,False

I had a hockey game where I played net and I got peppered, had a few beers since that's what amateur hockey players do lol. I got a ride home and I was mentally exhausted and a little tipsy, but still coherent.

I went into my room where my PC was running, I went to grab something, swiveled my chair and knocked a slightly loose Pepsi bottle off my nightstand and it went leaking ever so slightly into my PC, everything was still running properly.

now here's when I mishandled it. I turned off the computer, unplugged the PSU, and looked around the house, no isopropyl alcohol and everywhere was closed, so I brought coffee filters and absorbed the liquid. it seems to have landed on the backplate of my 5070 ti and some droplets were in the heatsink fins. My anxious, stupid, irrational brain plugged it back in and turned it on and everything worked. games work fine, and everything is working as intended.

There was no contact with RAM, MOBO, or connectors. I this dumb luck? You have every right to call me stupid, but the mental breakdown I almost had amidst my chronic stress almost confined me to a psych ward. PC still runs fine, everything works.

1qj5v6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnTikTok/comments/1qj5v6x/finally_learned_why_good_videos_die_at_1k_views/,Finally learned why good videos die at 1k views,"You know that feeling when you post a video you think is legitimately good and it dies at 700 views? Like the content is actually solid. You planned it. The hook is strong. You put effort in. And it just sits at 1k views while some video you filmed while waiting for coffee gets 18k.

This happened to me constantly and I genuinely started thinking which videos work is just pure luck. Like the algorithm randomly decides and you can't do anything about it.

Turns out you can do a lot about it.

I analyzed 50 videos I posted that should have done better but died between 700 and 1.4k views. Every single one had at least three of these six problems. Once I learned what to look for, my hit rate went from one in ten videos working to about seven out of ten.

Here's what's killing videos that should perform:

**Your hook promises something but you don't deliver it until way too late**

This ruined 40 out of 50 videos. Hook would say something like ""biggest lesson I learned"" but I wouldn't say what the lesson was until second 29. 75% of people left before I mentioned the actual lesson. If your hook promises something and you don't give it by second 9 to 12, people think you're stalling. I moved the reveal in one video from second 27 to second 10. Went from 700 views to 28k.

**You pause too long and people assume it ended**

Found this in 30 videos. I'd stop talking for 1.9 seconds to breathe and people thought the video was over. One video had a 2.1 second gap at second 13 and lost 68% of viewers at that exact moment. Pauses longer than 1.5 seconds make people think something broke.

**The same visual sits there too long**

This killed 26 videos. I'd show the same shot for 9+ seconds while narrating and people's focus died. One video kept the same angle from second 10 to second 19 and lost 59% during that stretch. If nothing changes on screen for over 6 seconds people get bored.

**You say something mid video that sounds like a conclusion**

Caught this in 18 videos. I'd use phrases like ""so that's what matters"" when I had more to say after. People interpreted that as me wrapping up and left. If you're not done, don't use ending words.

**Your best point is buried too far in**

This happened in 34 videos. I'd save my strongest insight for the end but by the time I got there at second 28, everyone except my most patient viewers was gone. Better approach is leading with your strongest point around second 11 to 15, then next strongest, then weakest. Rearranged one video this way. Went from 1.3k to 26k views.

**Second 6 to 13 doesn't match what the hook showed**

Showed up in 22 videos. Hook would be about one specific thing but then I'd pivot to background instead of just showing the thing. Like hook says ""this changed everything"" but second 7 to 14 talks about why change is hard instead of showing what changed. People came for what you promised in the first 5 seconds.

It really helped to use an app that shows what's wrong with your videos and exactly how to fix them to get more views. I use one called Tik'Alyzer and it shows the exact second people leave and why they left. Like it'll point out second 17 has dead air and 65% dropped there, or you don't deliver your hook until second 24 when most people left at second 12. Standard analytics show numbers without showing you what to fix.

Once I started catching these six things before posting, my dead video rate dropped from like 90% to around 30%. Still post videos that don't hit but now I understand why instead of blaming the algorithm.

If you've got videos stuck under 2k that you thought were decent, look for these six things. At least three are probably there.",3,1769020000.0,learnTikTok,0,1.0,False

Place - Revere PD crime lab

After getting a call that the DNA results from the pussy blood found at both scenes has come back, Murphy and Corso are meeting with Revere police department forensics expert Jenna Bosco. Bosco is 24 years old, has blonde hair and blue eyes, cute with an athletic figure. Since joining the department, she has quickly become Murphy’s go to analyst due to her expertise and undeniable skills.

With coffee in hand both detectives step into the elevator to the basement, which had recently been upgraded into a full scale crime lab. The elevator door opens, Murphy instinctively places his arm over the threshold to hold the door for Corso as he steps out.  Murphy watches the tall young detective stride forward. He thinks about the first time he met him back when Corso was just a rookie filled with piss and vinegar. Murphy often tells the kid how he reminds him of himself when he was that old. Corso made the jump to detective as fast as anybody in the department. Murphy even vouched for him and helped push his promotion through, in hopes he would be able to mentor him before he retired in the next few years. The detectives walk briskly down the hall and hit the buzzer to enter, the glass doors slide open and they walk into the lab. Murphy bellows, ""Hey Bosco, give me some good news, we could use a win here...whaddya got?""

Bosco looks up from her monitor as Murphy and Corso walk between the desks inside the lab and gets up to meet them halfway. With a sarcastic tone, she quips while greeting the detectives, “Before we get to that...Murphy you look like absolute shit. When was the last time you got some sleep? She then turns her attention to Corso who is barely older than she is, ""And for fucks sake Corso, they haven't fired you yet?""

Corso laughs out loud sarcastically, then loudly sips his coffee and replies, ""My gainful employment is a mystery to us all... still good to see you too Jenna.”

Murphy gestures to the blood samples on the table in front of him while laughing as well but is here to get down to business. ""OK enough fucking around..I bet Corso 12 bucks it was pussy blood we found at both scenes...one of us is going to be right and one is going to eat some crow. Now it's time to pay up for one of us. Was I right or wrong? You know I can smell a drop of poon-aid in a raging river from 250 yards away.""

Bosco rolls her eyes at Murphy long enough to stop laughing and puts on her professional face before answering, ""I don't know how you knew but you're right Murphy. The darkfield microscope the captain got for us is amazing. Not only is it able to tell us everything about the blood that we want to know, like blood type, presence of drugs or alcohol, but in this case I could see there were skin cells from when the uterine wall sheds. This is 100% the blood from a pussy…from the looks of it she is a gusher too.""

Corso smile fades into a look of defeat, he shakes his head slowly in disbelief, ""No fucking way.""

Murphy triumphantly raises his arms above his head, imitating a touchdown, and laughs. He puts out his hand, palm up, gesturing towards the center. “C'mon Corso...12 bucks? Pay up.. a bet is a  bet.""

Corso hangs his head before he pulls his wallet out and hands over 12 singles. ""You know I was saving that money for this years Twerkathon at Tidday's."" 

Murphy sips his coffee. ""Ok Bosco..so we got a match? Who is she?""

Bosco replies quickly. ""Got no clue, she doesn't match anybody in our database. But there's more, the blood came from two different visits from aunt flow…""

Murphy is now the one with the look of amazement. ""Two different batches, how can you tell?"" 

Bosco walks over to her laptop and opens a small file. “See here. The skin cells that are present are aged differently, they break down over time like anything else. We can see the difference and get a time frame. The source of this blood came from the same woman but nearly a year apart as best we can tell.""

Murphy responds like a man who has been married for more than 20 years.”Are you telling me our killer is a woman and once she is on the rag she becomes a killer?""

Bosco laughs at how simple Murphy is. “No, no way it is a woman unless she can bench press Corso. The stab wounds on Finn didn't just hit soft tissue. The autopsy showed the knife got stuck in bone on at least three separate thrusts. Whoever killed Finn was pretty damn strong, a retard possibly. In any case you are probably looking for a guy who goes to the gym a lot.""

Corso utters. ""A football player?""

Bosco thinks about it for a second. “Possibly and he is around eight or nine nine-inch dicks tall, based on the angle of the wounds. These came in a downward motion."" Bosco picks up a pen and  demonstrates the swinging motion she believes was used. ""Then on Clausen, the blunt force trauma to the head was strong enough to shatter his cranium."" 

Murphy giggles at the unit of measurement Bosco chose. “Wait, did you just use a nine-inch dick as a unit of measurement? “

Bosco pulls up six separate images of skulls on a wall screen and without a pause says, “A girls gotta have her standards.”

Murphy looks down at his own crotch, shrugs his shoulders and says, “Fair play.”

Bosco continues to display the forensic photos from her files. “This one here is Clausen, you can see how the skull was crushed, leading to massive hemorrhaging.”

Murphy walks closer to the wall screen and points, ""What about this one?""

Bosco replies  ""That guy fell off his roof and landed on his head from about 21 nine-inch dicks up, he died on impact.""

Corso blushes, he is unwilling to even question how she arrived at this new system. He chooses instead to move on and then inquires about the next images, ""And these two? Holy shit it looks like someone hit them with a sledgehammer.”

Bosco nods her head. “Funny you should mention that. This is the skull of coach Gillbride.""

Murphy's voice has a touch of wonder in it, ""Kevin Gilbride? Didn't he get punched in the face by Buddy Ryan during a game once?""

Bosco laughs ""I'm not old enough to remember Murph. He died a few years ago in a pregame football stunt gone wrong.""

Corso excitedly responds, ""Fuck me, I remember that. He was coaching up in Buffalo and they paid Cannon Balls to come throw out the ceremonial first pass. Gilbride was wearing a helmet cam…craziest shit I ever saw. The ball hit him dead in the face, but he held on to it..was a helluva catch."" 

Bosco replies, ""Yeah, that was it. Even though he caught it, the ball still hit his face. Went right through the face mask and stuck in his skull. Catastrophic trauma killed him instantly.""

Murphy expresses clear admiration for the retired quarterback ""Man, Balls could really spin it..can't believe he managed to hold on to it. I watched that replay about 60 times.""

Corso shows deference to the deceased. ""Damn right he did...dude was a soldier. Anyway, what were you saying Bosco?""

Bosco jokingly replies, ""Now that you two are done with your hero worship. I was  saying whoever did this used pussy blood from the same woman with a bled on date more than 2 years apart.""

Murphy is unable to hide his shock. ""Mother fucker.. this is worse than I thought..we got a real sick son of a bitch on our hands here.""",1,1769019954.0,story,0,1.0,False

A friend from college (32M) has been trying to launch a small B2B software thing for about a year. I’m a product designer and I’ve helped a few friends sanity-check ideas, so when he asked if we could grab coffee and talk through his onboarding flow, I said sure. It was one normal conversation, maybe 90 minutes. I gave feedback like “this screen is confusing” and “your pricing page reads scammy”, and that was it. I didn’t join anything, didn’t take equity, didn’t agree to be an advisor, nothing. A couple weeks later he texts me a PDF like “look at the deck!!” and on one slide it says “Advisors” and my full name is there. Not “Sarah from college”, my actual name. Under it, a little line that implies I’m helping guide the product. I told him to remove it. He replied “it’s just social proof, relax, everyone does it. It’s not like I’m using your face.” I got annoyed but stayed calm and said it’s still not true, and it makes me look like I’m endorsing something I barely know. He said okay and sent a new version without that slide.

Fast forward to last weekend. I’m at a local tech meetup (small city, people overlap). A guy comes up to me and goes, “Oh you’re working with (friend’s name) right? I saw you listed as an advisor on his one pager.” I felt my stomach drop. Later I asked my friend to show me what he’s handing out. On his website there’s a section “What people say” with 3 quotes, and one of them is basically my wording from coffee, but rewritten as a glowing testimonial, with my name under it. Another place had “Backed by industry experts” and again, my name. I called him and said remove my name everywhere today. He got defensive and said I’m being dramatic and “making it personal”, and that he needs to look legit because investors keep ghosting him. He also said since I did give him advice, it’s not a lie, it’s “based on real feedback.” I said advice is not endorsement, and I don’t consent to being used as marketing. He then accused me of trying to sabotage his launch out of jealousy (??) and said if I make him delete it now he’ll “look shady” because people already saw it. I told him if it stays up I’m going to correct anyone who asks and be honest that I’m not involved, and I’ll tell him who I told. He thinks that’s a threat and that I’m a jerk for not letting him “borrow” credibility when it costs me nothing. I don’t want to ruin him, I just don’t want my name attached to something I didn’t agree to.

TL;DR: Friend used my name as an “advisor” and as a testimonial without permission after one casual coffee. I demanded he remove it everywhere and said I’ll correct people if he doesn’t. AITJ?

Hi Reddit,

I’m a Montreal-based IT professional with 8+ years of experience, and I’m currently looking for my next challenge. I’m not just looking for a paycheck I’m looking for an employer who operates by their guiding principles and a role where I can make a real impact.

My career has been built on **service**. I’ve occupied almost every service-related role possible, giving me a unique ""360-degree"" view of how technology and people intersect.

**My background includes:**

* **Infrastructure & Cloud:** Specialized in Microsoft 365, Azure AD (Entra ID), and Intune/Endpoint management.
* **Data Centers & Hardware:** Experience as a Data Center Technician, handling site security, compliance, and asset management.
* **Support Mastery:** Everything from high-volume call centers (Team Lead roles) to in-house technical support for government contractors and big retail players.
* **Leadership & Grit:** I’ve been a Shift Supervisor/Assistant Manager for a world-renowned coffee chain I know how to handle a ""rush,"" manage a team, and keep customers happy under extreme pressure.

**Roles I’ve crushed in the past:**

* In-house Technical Support Specialist
* Procedure Analyst & Change Management Specialist
* Customer Success / Experience Lead
* Team Lead (Call Center environments)
* Data Center Technician (Compliance & Security)
* Shift Supervisor (Food & Retail)

**Why me?** I don’t just ""fix"" things; I take ownership. I love thinking outside the box to find creative ways to gain efficiency, improve workflows, and automate the boring stuff (PowerShell/Python). I bring the discipline of a business owner/freelance with the hands-on empathy of a front-line service worker.

I am fully bilingual (FR/EN), technically certified (AZ-900, Cisco CyberOps), and ready to start immediately.

If your company values integrity, proactive problem-solving, and efficiency, **DM me.** Let’s see where this takes us!",1,1769019904.0,montrealjobs,1,1.0,False

For the last 12 months, or so, I have noticed that the milk I purchase from Food Lion, Sams, Walmart, Shoppers, Giant, etc.. All seems to go bad well before the date.

My fridge is fine and is keeping things at proper temps, so I know its not that.

For example this morning, I had a gallon of 1% that had a Use by date of 01/30/2026, but man it was foul smelling this morning, and when I dumped it out, it had started to separate and get funky. This was a gallon of 1%, Food Lion store brand.

It just seems really weird to me that this is happening, my wife thinks I am nuts, but she doesn't drink milk at all, so its not something on her radar, but I cook with milk a lot and drink a ton of coffee. So I tend to notice it.

Anyway, just curious, I hope yall have a good day.",0,1769019841.0,baltimore,5,0.5,False
1qj5she,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1qj5she/does_my_husband_have_unrealistic_sexual/,Does my Husband have unrealistic sexual expectations or am I just not doing enough as a wife???,"Hi I really need to know am I being unreasonable or being a bad wife or does my husband have unrealistic expectations?

I have been married one year and I had my first child in the first year. She is now 4 months. After I was able to have sex we have been having sex at least 2-3 times a week every week which I think is reasonable since I work from home plus some days I work from home with my daughter sometimes if she’s not with her grandma. Also I cook about 3-4 times a week sometimes more and I am a part time college student. When I say this is the busiest season of my life it so busy like I’m up running from the time I wake up around 4 am sometimes mostly 6 am until about 11 pm or later. My husband thinks we don’t have enough sex but with my hectic schedule I think 2-3 times a week is reasonably also he says we always do it when I feel like it which I agree but it’s only because I am so busy and he approaches me at the most inconvenient times also I do most of the domestic work and I am trying my best to be a great wife but he is making me feel so bad about it. Also we try to keep it spicy by doing car sex beach etc but it still doesn’t seem to be working. I started a new semester of school just two weeks ago and I told him how school adds to my stress and sex may not be so frequent or as spicy he said okay. I had a bad week and so sexually I was not present and we only had sex once last week which is a rare occasion unless I am sick or he is sick. He got mad and ended up watching porn mind you he told me he would not watch porn anymore. Also I have not let myself go I still have my hourglass figure and i work out at home since I have not officially returned to the gym and I have a decent diet. Also we are a Christian couple and we agree porn is a no in our marriage. I don’t watch porn at all and it really upsets me that one bad week made him go to porn bc I am stressed with everything I have on my plate. Also I have his coffee ready in the morning he rarely has to fix his on plate I give massage etc and I want to serve him and I love serving him but I am so heartbroken that he cannot give me grace when I have a bad week or days like I do for him. Am I being unreasonable? I think sex 2-3x a week with everything I have on my plate right now is reasonable especially with a 4 month old baby. I feel like I’m doing my best but my husband is making me feel like I am not. Idk what to do….also I don’t expect us to have sex 2-3x a week forever. Of course the goal is to always have more sex but for this current stage in our lives I feel that is reasonable. Basically I am so tired some days that 2-3x a week is the best I can do for real. I wish I had the energy to have more sex right now but some days I am so exhausted 😭",2,1769019840.0,Marriage,5,1.0,False

""Now that's just rude. Most folk in your position would say thanks."" He snarked. 

""Thanks."" The dirty blonde replied as she jammed the gun in the side of his skull. ""Now drive on down the road till I tell you."" she demanded. 

""Hold on now, think a wire got crossed here. You know where the rest of these fools are hold up?"" Travis demanded.

""I remember the way back, yes."" She admitted through gritted teeth. Travis slapped the wheel and horse laughed.

""Well then why the hell are wasting time with this pissing contest here, let's go get em-put that lil pop gun down."" He laid the charm on thick. She hesitated but lowered the pistol slightly.

Every instinct Travis had told him to grab it from her and bash her head in for even looking at it in his presence. He ignored those thoughts, at least until he got a grasp on whatever the hell was happening around here.

He started up the engine which purred like a newborn kitten. The jeep bolted forward, Travis could feel every bump on the jaded edge on the road. They sat in silence for a bit, each sizing up the other.

The dirty blonde looked to be in her early 20s-Travis had noticed a northern accent to her tone, Maine maybe. He had never met someone from Maine he didn't want to throttle. It seemed that tradition would hold fast. She has some light bruising on her arms and neck, but other than that she seemed in better shape than her fellow escapee. 

""Did you see anyone else out there?"" she inquired, startling Travis. 

""Talking bout that long haired pot belly fella, right? The New blood? Yeah, I found him-don't know what they did to him, but he died from his wounds. Buried him. Followed his trail."" He lied. 

""Fucking savages."" The dirty blonde muttered to herself. The car was greeted with silence once more, save for the occasional thump in the road. Travis could sense the fury boiling over from the passenger seat.

""Did you know him?"" He asked, trying to be pleasant. 

""Not really. They thought I was newly turned, that I had no control over the change. I got the drop on them, took out a few of the guards, he broke loose in the chaos. We went our separate ways. Never even got his name."" she said solemnly. 

""How long since you've been afflicted?"" Travis cracked. The dirty blonde shrugged. 

""Never was. I was born a freak."" she replied casually. Travis dropped his jester's smile at that. 

""No shit. My mas-the one who turned me- he said there were no pure bloods left in the states. Says they were all hunted down during the great purge."" He said bewildered. The dirty blonde looked at him cross-eyed. 

""Yeah-I guess not."" She shifted uncomfortably.  A newfound tension joined the cunning silence as they came to a fork in the road. The dirty blonde pointed left down a rocky road that had no trespassing sign out front. Travis cleared his throat as he made the turn.

""Look, we got off on the wrong foot here. My name's Travis."" He introduced himself. 

""Tammy."" she replied coolly. ""I don't know a whole lot about this group. They're held up in a bunker; there's a big cabin that serves as a front-I assume anyway. I don't know how many there are, but counting the two you got they're down about seven or eight people."" She informed. Travis gave her a nod

""Any advantage is a good one. How long they have you down there?""

""About a week. My own fault. Someone jabbed me from behind and I blacked out. When I came to, I saw- I'm not sure exactly. It looked like one of us, smelled like us. But it was older, and bigger than this jeep. I could feel his pain; it was radiating in waves off him from all the gunk and wires they pumped into him."" she said. Travis gripped the wheel in response.

 ""They injected me with some of his blood. Funky feeling but it didn't really have any effect on me. So, they locked me away with the others. None of them seemed to have been turned for more than a month, maybe two tops. They took five or six away to the back before I broke out. I don't know what happens back there but-It smells like death and ashes."" She shuddered at the memory of the dank bunker, and the stench of decay that surrounded it. Tammy eyed Travis with renewed suspicion. ""What are you doing out here anyway? I kind of find it hard to believe I'd run into someone else like me."" 

""Heh, I was up here on what you might call a spiritual retreat."" Travis beamed. He rolled the word ""Spiritual"" on his tongue-like it was his favorite word in the world. ""Tonight's the blood moon after all."" he said with reverence.

""Oh yeah, something to do with dust in the Earth's atmosphere reflecting light or something like that. My Bio professor mentioned something about it last week."" she remarked.  Now it was Travis who met her with a peculiar look.

""My word, woman, don't you know your own history?"" He scoffed. ""Why you're a god among these heathens?"" He sneered at her. They came to another left turn filled with foliage and muddled with tracks. He took it sharply, the whole jeep rumbling as he narrowed his eyes at her. 

""I mean I know what my mother told me about us-"" She started but Travis waved his hand dismissively.

""Nah, you don't know- I can tell by your voice. It was centuries ago, when our people didn't hide away in the dark. The lunar father loved all who dwelt under the moonlight but favored the cunning wolf. The wolf was strong and fierce but still suffered under the yolk of man's eternal hunt.""

""This angered the celestial above so much that he turned sanguine from rage-the great plains became marked with crimson as all of creation trembled in awe. Under this blood moon a den mother bore a litter under the merciful gaze of the lunar lord. One of these pups stood tall among his brothers, blessed with all the strengths of a wolf- yet walked like a man, thought like a man, could hunt like one.""

"" He was the first of his kind; his bite spread among the heathens, blessing the unenlightened with the mark of the lunar god's love."" Travis beamed as he spun his tale. Tammy shifted closer to the window, feigning a pleasant smile as she nodded her head along to the bizarre folklore he spoke of. 

""-All wolves are descended from the line of Varcolac, though he is known by many names. He was the first prophet, the first son of the moon. It doesn't surprise me your history is lost to you. My mentor knew all too well of the false god's suppression of our heritage."" Travis sneered. 

""Right. Well, my mother always told me something different, less-biblical I suppose."" She said with caution. The jeep was silent as it rolled down the road. Tammy looked out the window, recognizing the claw stripped bark and bullet holes decorating the trees. They were getting close.

""Out of curiosity, what fairy tales did your mother teach you?"" Travis pondered aloud, almost daring her to contradict him.

""A man was jealous of his brother, he had a bigger house, beautiful wife and the most plentiful herd in the village. One day his temper and jealousy got the better of him, and he slaughtered his brother and his family in cold blood. They say the gods were so horrified by the man's crimes they cursed him to forever walk the earth as a beast, never to know peace as he was forever plagued by hunter's arrows. He spread his curse across the land because-misery loves company I suppose. A few hundred years later here I am."" she finished. Travis scoffed at this.

 ""Is that how you see it; a blight over a divine blessing?"" He sneered, hands clenching the wheel.

 ""I wouldn't say blight-more like a livable curse."" She eased. 

""Agree to disagree."" Travis replied through gritted fangs. He would massacre the heretic later, when the humans had been dealt with. Perhaps the pure blood would make an ideal offering to the night orb above.

\------------

The jeep rolled to a crawl as a cabin came into view. There were three other jeeps parked out front sans drivers. The sun cast a low shadow on the sleepy cabin, yet no lights could be seen inside. A worn stone chimney rested on the side, wafts of smoke drifting into the sky.

The cabin roof was covered with shingles-rusty and burdened by the harsh weather. It was quiet and unassuming, not even a cricket dared chirp near it. Tucked away in the porch was a faint but obvious red dot. It flashed occasionally, the old-fashioned security camera pointing directly out into the clearing.

Lucky for the wolves they had pulled aside-they had not yet been seen by the cameras. The jeep idled on the side of the dissolute dirt road as they pondered their options. The sun was low now, draping a haunting silhouette on the cabin-like it was beckoning them inside.  Travis cleared his throat and turned to Tammy. 

""We move in the cover of darkness, under the gaze of the Bloodmoon."" he proclaimed. Tammy couldn't argue, they were probably on high alert with the escape. The last thing they would expect would be an assault on their stronghold. ""Would you care to join me in prayer as we prepare for battle and for the righteous change under the holy light?"" he spoke with reverence, eager to convert her. 

""I'm- not right now, I prefer to be alone for-that."" She stammered. Travis sneered for a second, his face twisting in fury. But he calmed himself, and quoted scripture at her as he left the driver's side. 

""The prophets say *""We bring the call of the wild to the sign of the sacristy/ Rest in the eye of our sanctity""*\- It is our duty as children of the moon to bring our light to those who have none. Consider that, my sister, as the night approaches."" With that he slinked off into the brush to grovel in worship of the sanguine moon, leaving Tammy there to wonder why the hell this nut job just quoted a metal band like they were the words of God.

\-----------

Tammy eyed Travis like a hawk as he kneeled before the coming moon. His arms were outstretched to the sky in praise as he mumbled prayers for forgiveness and servitude. She bounced her knees nervously. Whatever whacked out cult he belonged to skeeved the hell out of her.

She recalled her mother's own beliefs. She always thought it funny a werewolf would be such a devout catholic, but she supposed God had a sense of humor about that sort of thing. Every Sunday she would get dragged to mass, always getting an itching feeling when it fell on the day of a full moon.

Tammy enjoyed it however, everyone there was always so welcoming and kind. It was a nice reprieve from the schoolyard bullies. It had been sometime since she had said a prayer, and the thought flew across her mind like a bow in the wind. She brushed it off, almost embarrassed at the thought though she wasn't sure why.

She began to feel the weight of the rising star herself. She had resisted the call of the full moon most of her life-her mother had taught her to suppress her beastly urges well. She had never liked the change-the tearing of her skin to reveal a ghastly monster underneath.

But she had come to terms with it long ago- had never lost control of the wolf and rampaged into the night. Last night was the first time she had ever killed anyone. She could recall the taste of fear in their blood and could still hear the snapping of bones under her maw. It frightened her how easy it had been. Just like it frightened her how easy the crazed stranger had slaughtered those two guards to free her.

She furrowed her brow at the thought- no that scum needed to die, she was at peace with that part. She hated them for forcing her hand, and she was still furious at herself for getting caught. She was never much for the wilderness, preferring the chaotic comfort of the city.

 This morning, she was dazed and half naked, a winning combo for being lost in the woods.

She had heard the hunters coming this time and managed to hide from them at first. Or so she thought, as she was caught off guard by the zip of a tranq gun from nowhere. She had drifted off into the abyss, and woken up in the back of a jeep to the sound of two bickering hunters.  She was a poor wolf it seemed, least in the eyes of the mad man Travis. When they had freed the people below, she suspected she would have to be quick in her getaway.

As the night circled them, the moon above grew bold and bright-a ghastly shade of ember red coming down to greet them. Tammy held her breath and embraced the change-her world spinning as the wolf clawed at her mind. Travis basked in the celestial body's glow; he was nude and kneeling in muck, but he felt the loving embrace of God greeting him.

He opened his eyes cautiously, like he was afraid he would be deemed unworthy to gaze upon the blood-moon that night. The stars danced before him, the burning crimson wolf above looking straight back at him. He could feel the god speaking In his mind, it told him he was proud of Travis- he was a good son and soon enough his purpose would become clear.

With tears in his ocher eyes, he thanked the lord above and began the change. It felt different than usual, purer and more carnal. He tore the mortal skin from his body, arms morphing and growing as he became more bestial. Leathery skin with thick black fur took its place as he tore away at what remained of his humanity.

A few feet away from him the jeep rumbled and rattled as Tammy cried out, gums gushing blood as fangs tore through them. She bucked and kicked the dashboard, denting it as her cries became guttural and ravenous. The pain fried her senses; she could feel her mind breaking apart as the hunger of the wolf consumed her.

Travis never broke away from the moon's gaze as he grew and changed, foaming at the maw as he barked at the moon with joy. His lips curled in a smile as his snout enlarged, and he howled at the moon with vigor as he felt the nub of a tail form near his lower back.

Tammy bust out of the jeep, her frame leaner than his, more agile than his hulking physique. Her fur was a golden tint-eyes burning like fire in the night sky. She huffed and puffed as she clawed at the ground, fingernails still bleeding from the fresh change. She tasted iron in her mouth, and she salivated at the sensation.

Travis stood tall, a hulking eight feet at least, yet still hunched over as he lumbered over to the struggling Tammy. She stood up, about seven feet and snarled at the approaching black wolf. Travis made a deep clicking sound, like a dog trying to laugh. He spoke then-his voice graveled and deep, like he was speaking with rocks in his throat.

 ""Calm your senses sister. You neglect your real self-that much is obvious."" He said with a hint of disdain. Tammy ignored his remark and eyed the cabin. She pointed a gnarled claw at it.

""Want-their flesh-free-o-thers."" She choked out her command. Travis faced the cabin, the words of his god flooding his mind.

""You are chosen Travis-never forget that you're better than the roaches. Go and teach them the folly of their sin."" His master cooed in his ear. 

""Thy will be done."" Travis muttered to himself. He surged forward on all fours, lunging at the front door. The door was flimsy wood and rusted hinges; he tore through it and lumbered into the dark cabin. Tammy followed behind, her mind muddled and falling to instinct. She was not used to changing at the height of the cycle.

\------------

The inside of the cabin was small, claustrophobic even for the wolves. The walls were barre- rooms filled with boxes and dusty hunting trophies littered the place. It reeked of musk and mold, dust dancing in the moonlight as the patrolled. Deep from below, Travis heard a ringing- an alarm blaring and the thunderous sounds of panicked steps.

Tammy sniffed some boxes, a stuffed deer head pointing out of them. It stared at them with the lifeless eyes of a doll. In the corner was a bookcase, scuff marks in front of it. Travis sneered as he approached, grabbing hold of the case and ripping it out of the wall. Machinery ached and sparked as he tore it away and threw it against the bony cabin wall.

Hidden behind was a short hallway illuminated with fluorescent lights. An elevator stood tall at the end. The wolves rushed forward, the tortured cries of their brethren crying out for them. They sounded confused and afraid, surrounded by deadly silver and men with weapons. Tammy reached out towards the elevator, and with a grunt cracked open the sliding doors.

They cried out in pain, a horrid screech like metal pushing against metal. They looked down to see a shallow shaft. Far below the elevator roared to life, ascending to meet them. Travis jumped forward, clinging to the shaft with a clang. Tammy followed suit and the wolves skated down, using their claws to hug the walls, tearing into paneling and sparking wires as they descended.

They were gaining speed, the elevator fast approaching. With a huff he leapt from the hoist way and landed on the roof, shaking the roof of the elevator with fury. It halted to a dead stop, groans of a dying machine echoing out. From inside the cart Travis heard panicked murmurs and shouts. He could smell them through the oil and rust of the elevator. The stench of body spray and silver clung to them like ticks.

Travis grimaced and swiped at the ceiling hatch to the shocked gasps of the men trapped inside. From inside they could see the hulking outline of the beast with beady yellow eyes and a mouth full of glistening teeth that seemed to stretch for miles. They met him with gunfire, Travis roared and ducked back behind the motor as they fired. Bullets zipped through the air-viscous little silver streaks.

He lurched back towards the hatch as they reloaded and reared his head inside. The elevator was crowded, five men security gear-vests and tactical gas masks like they were handling chemicals all day. The bald one in the corner reached for his side arm-but Travis' reach was quicker and longer. He snagged the man-who howled as claws dug into his chest. Travis greedily tore into the man's face and tossed him aside, the still squirming body shaking the ground on impact.

Travis slithered into the elevator, mouthwatering as the dead men inside screamed and fired. Tammy watched the cart quiver with violence as Travis butchered them, the sounds of meat tearing apart and scattered gunfire. Bullets flew through the shaft, dinging the walls as they came to a sparking stop.

The light inside had an orange hue to it-it lights up the shaft like a blood-soaked jack-o-lantern. As the screaming died down and was replaced with gluttonous feeding, a bloodied man scurried up the top of the hatch. His face was caked in gore, his dull blue eyes dancing around the dank shaft.

His name was David-a middle-aged man who had misgivings about what they did there-yet didn't lift a finger to stop it. He gasped for bloodless air; Travis was gnawing on a femur, oblivious to the escapee. If he could climb the wiring-maybe he would live to see dawn.

On the wall beside him he heard hot, wheezing breath.

He trembled; he turned to see ember eyes staring back at him- a slender figure glued to the wall on all fours. The beast's mouth stank of dry tuna and wet dog-it panted at him, eyeing him like a slab of steak. David was frozen with fright; he could feel warmth pooling down his leg.

The beast with flamed eyes seemed to unhinge its jaw, slowly grasping his scalp around it. He could feel rows of teeth begging to clamp down on his skull, nipping at the edge of his skin. Fresh blood dripped down his head-his vision became blurry with crimson ichor. There was a pounding pressure on his skull, like his head was splitting open.

As the wolf's jaws clamped down-sinking into the bone and brain matter-he had a final spasm as his eyes rolled back, and David browned out as the maw tightened. His ear drums popped and crackled from pressure-fluid filling them as the beast crunched down. Its powerful jaws were like a bear trap, slowly crushing his skull as David was in excruciating pain every millisecond.

A pinkish-gray goo spilled out of his nose-he tried to speak but found himself sputtering and babbling. His vision became further obscured by crimson and the abyss-a crunch rang out- and he was gone. 

A headless corpse fell to the floor-interrupting Travis' banquet. He tossed aside a gnawed forearm still gripping a broken pistol as he listened to the frenzied chewing above. Splintered bone flew down-the marrow licked clean as Tammy hacked and clawed at her prize. She crawled down, savoring her kill like a dog proud of her chew toy.

\-------------

Travis stood hunched in the car, lights dull and orange like a dying flame. He was surprised at the animalistic behavior of one who claimed to be a wolf her whole life. Then again, she clearly despised this side of herself, perhaps she was out of practice. He kneeled down to commune with her, hoping to convey some sort of plan or at least keep her from swallowing the hunk of bone whole. Tammy pulled away from him-snarling like he was going to try and take what remained of the skull.

""Bah."" He spat. ""Choke on it then."" He eyed the control panel and batted it with his gnarled hand. The elevator lurched downward, the only sounds were the chokes of Tammy spitting out bone. She stood among the gore, gathering her thoughts.

\------------

The lights so vivid-smells so clear. She wanted to hunt, needed to hunt-needed to feed.

No, no she had a mission she needed to focus. The tall wolf stood near; he reeked of death. He seemed annoyed by her-this was no good, he was strong, a fighter-she needed to do better to please hi-

no NO- what was she saying, she was Tamara-Tamara Talbot, she wasn't an animal, she wasn't a wolf. She was something in between, she wasn't a slave to her instincts. Lights dimmed, the cart grinded to a halt. She took deep breaths.

The room smelled of food-she was hungry she-

she had killed someone, someone who was trying to hurt her; maybe? She struggled to remember, struggled to think-to be rational. She stood tall, back legs shaking like a newborn deer as she pushed the animal back.

She snarled at the tall wolf as the elevator doors opened. She pushed past him, the white halls blinding. A dull light kept going on and off, and she winced and whined as a shrill sound blared overhead. The tall wolf grimaced next to her, swiping at something above their heads. It collapsed to the ground in a heap as the shrill sound faded. She eyed him, grunting in gratitude. She cleared her throat, struggling to find the words.

""Th-is way-big-like us."" She struggled. Travis got the gist of it.

\------------

He stepped over the shattered intercom-the alarm still blaring throughout the facility.  The walls were labeled with colored lines: green, blue and red. The green line led to a double door labeled ""kennels."" While the blue led to a sealed metal door to their left. The red line followed the green like a somber companion. Travis stomped towards the blue line door as an intercom rattled to life in the distance. A commanding voice sounded off in the distance.

 ""This is Abbott-lock down the kennel and prepare purge protocol! This is not a drill!"" His voice echoed throughout the bunker. Travis put aside the word ""purge"" for a moment as he stood before the metal door. There was a port hole in the front, it was more like a pressurized bulkhead. Through the porthole he could see a massive thing in there, heaving its body through labored breaths.

He opened the door, it swung heavy, grinding like it wanted to hide away the shame. He crept forward, the muffled wheeze of the great wolf before him filled the void of silence. Tammy wasn't lying-the great beast was at least the size of a hummer. Yet it was lanky and emaciated-its skin dry and cracked. Its grey fur was frayed and weathered-like he was in the final stages of mange. His chest was pock marked and covered in cysts and sickly liver spots.

The great wolf was muzzled- ears clipped and forced to wear blinders like a racehorse. Countless wires and tubes were stuck in him, coiled around the great one like hungry vipers. Machines pumped and whirred sucking the life force from it and recycling back into him.

Around him was an assortment of tools and medical equipment used to poke, prod and bleed the wolf. Travis stood before the elder trembling with rage. He reached out towards the wheezing thing as the equipment beeped and breathed-attempting to remove the blinders.

They came off easy, the elder didn't even register. His eyes a pure milky cloud, gunk crusting up around them in a sickly manner. Travis put his hands on the elder's head. It flinched at his touch, rambling against its shackles. He soothed the beast, taking his head in his hands carefully. He felt so frail, Travis smelt longing and aged cruelty on the great beast-who knows how long he had wasted away in the dark?

The great beast moaned in agony-and Travis knew what must be done.

Tamara entered the room just in time to see Travis grab a silver laden tool off a table and ram it swiftly into the elder's skull. Steam poured from his hand as he twisted the tool, the great beast struggling for only a moment. The equipment keeping the ancient wolf alive cried out in mourning as Travis embraced him, feeling the life drain away as the elder went limp in his arms.

When the beast had passed-he threw the murder weapon aside, his hand still steaming and burnt. He laid the creature to rest on the floor, cradling the head like a child with his toy. Tammy cried out at the murder, a sharp bark that barely pierced Travis' ears.

""You-killer-why did you-"" She growled, ready to tear the bastard's throat out. Travis stood tall, looming over her as he raved at her.

 ""You see this-this travesty-and you have the audacity to ask why I give release?!?"" He snarled at her.  He brushed past her, hurrying to the kennels. ""Come child. If they treat an elder this way I shudder at what they are doing to the new bloods.""

\------------

Tamara followed suit, the fog of her mind clearing as she took more control. They ran through the halls with no resistance. The Bunker was smaller than you would think. As they followed the green and red lines, they passed several rooms that were set up as locker rooms, break-rooms, even office spaces one would use for accounting. They smelled like stale coffee and donuts, a hint of red velvet from someone's birthday. The grounds of those offices were littered with shredded paper and documents and panicked interns destroying evidence.

They passed an armory, fully stocked and loaded with riffles and stun guns. Held up in the corner was a sniveling intern with a purple tie, praying as he held a gun to his chest. The wolves ignored the peons-up ahead; they heard the faint sound of gunfire. Overheard Abbot repeated his ominous message as they raced through the halls. They came before a blue double door and burst through it.

They were met with rows upon rows of large kennels.  Each one held a snarling wolfman clawing and yipping at their chains. Blue overhead lights filled the halls, the floors concrete and sticky from mess. The green line ended and the red broke off into different sections, all leading into eight walls of kennels on each side. The place reeked of wet dog and dirty fur, the barks and howls bounced off the walls against each other, complimented by the canon fire of guns cutting off pained wolves.

Guards were going from kennel to kennel, cleaning the cages of their occupants. There was no time to argue, the pair broke off and sprinted down the halls. They surprised the guards who turned to fire upon them, but were met with teeth and claws. The scent of fresh blood riled up the caged wolves like chum in shark infested waters. They rattled their chains, wolves of all shapes and sizes. The guards fired upon the pair but were no match for them as they sliced and gnawed through them.

Limbs flew and bodies were slashed; it was a ballet of death. Travis roared in pain as a bloodied guard snuck up on him and jabbed him in the back with a cattle prod. It buzzed and zapped, the electricity frying him. He whipped around and grabbed his assailant's arm and twisted. It snapped and tore like an old G.I. Joe. Travis grabbed the prod and rammed it into the guard's mouth, shattering teeth as he plunged it down his throat and pulled the trigger. The guard spasmed and collapsed to the ground, eyes lighting up like a Christmas tree.

Tamara bobbed and weaved against the men, trying to disarm rather than kill. A bullet grazed her shoulder, stinging like an angry wasp. She saw red as she pounced at the begging man, tearing into him as she mauled him to death with gleeful rage.

Travis was like a hulking brute; he battered men to death with their buddy's torso and howled with sick pleasure as he butchered the guards. The remaining caged wolves cheered them on, howling and braying like madmen gone wild. He dragged half a dismembered body, a trail of intestine following suit. He saw a control panel, and slashed away at it until sparks flew and alarm bells rang out.

The cages opened in unison, and the remaining humans didn't even try to fight the wave of vengeance that fell on them. The caged wolves were like mindless beasts, free for the first time in months, free to embrace their new forms. They ran through the bunker like a plague of locusts, devouring anyone they came across. Travis revealed in the carnage, basking in it as the freed wolves gave praise to their liberator.

Tamara stood back, meat spilling from her bloodied maw as she stood appalled. It was pure chaos, pure killing for the sake of it. Was this the revenge she had sought? She backed herself against a wall as she watched in horrified awe as the brutality played out before her.

\----------

Travis followed the red lines, even among the chaos. It was like a blood trail leading him to a final atrocity. He got a whiff of it, even though all the gore. The decayed smell of dead wolves and burning bodies. The final lines led to a brass door tucked away from the back. There was a sign atop it that simply read: ""Processing.""

He entered the room, a massive meat locker. Dozens of bloodied meat hooks hung from the rafters, some with the hung bodies of skinned wolves. Their throats cut, blood drains littering the crimson stained floor. His feet clicked on the tiles as he made his way through the atrocity. The room was filled with crates and push bins filled to the brim with furs and coats. Wolf pelts were mounted on drying racks, staring at him with lifeless sockets. 

To his right another room, he could feel the heat from where he stood. He didn't want to go in there, see the burnt remains and ash piles. He stood among the slaughtered, and felt nothing but unbridled anger. He was so engrossed he didn't hear the high stepping man behind him with a loaded revolver.

He felt the punch of the silver slugs as they tore through his back. He roared and collapsed, his back smoking with tainted mist. His head spun and doubled as he clung to the cool tiled floor. A sticky, moist warmth formed under him, and he gasped with choked breaths as he watched his own blood begin to pool. The man stepped over him, the sounds of fighting and carnage from outside a distant whisper now.

In his dying moments, he heard his father's voice. There was fire in his words, yet they dripped with remorse.

""It's not too late for you, my boy. Repent-repent and call out to the light. You don't deserve to get put down like a dog."" His father mourned. Travis blinked, his vision a tunnel of light. In it he saw shapes call out to him, begging him to turn away. He wanted to join them-the light felt so warm and inviting.

""You know better, Travis. You have the blood of the beast flowing through you like a raging river. Now start acting like it."" The commanding voice of his master boomed to him, pulling him back into the fold.

The voices began to fade, as the command of the moon ordered him to rise. He readied himself, grieving the loss of the warmth. It had felt so real so- No. He struck that thought down. It was deception from the false idol, trying to draw him back into the flock. He felt himself healing as he pledged himself to the wolf once more. Reality snatched him back as he steeled his heart.

\----------

Alonzo Abbott looked at the dying creature at his feet and sighed, admiring the shine of his pelt. Damn shame, easy 10K he thought to himself as he holstered his revolver. He wore a bloodstained apron and wore blue latex gloves, his hair long and greased back. His face was sunken and rugged, rough to the touch like the tread of a tire. He listened to the sum of his life's work outside tearing itself to shreds. 

It didn't matter now he supposed-he had made a fortune off selling the blood and tears of these creatures, he could escape through the loading bay tunnels-a long walk for sure but at least he'd be alive. Once he escaped, he'd retire comfortably-hell with how much he had stashed away he could figure he could buy a whole island or two.

Still, the sting of losing this money maker was an ego burn for sure. He looked down on the dying thing, it looked back, like the dumb animal was sneering at him. He scoffed and kicked it across the jaw. He felt the creature's heavy head under his boot, relishing the clicking thud it made. He turned his back on it and took out his tape recorder-an old habit from his vet days. 

""Personal memo-once I get out of this place send a clean-up crew, incinerate everything, you don't need the wolves at your door down in Cabo do you Alonzo?"" He joked to himself. He turned to see the wolf stumbling to his feet. He raised an eyebrow, but didn't reach for his gun. He taunted the wobbling beast instead. 

""Look at the wild animal, he doesn't know he's dead yet. Fall down and stay down pup."" He waived a dismissive hand at the thing. The wolf stood tall, clasping a hand around his wounds. Abbot felt the hatred on his hot breath and stepped back.

""Get back-I'll skin you like the rest of the mongrels"" he growled. He reached to draw on the monster and finish him once and for all. He was quick.

But Travis was faster.

He grabbed Abott by the neck and lifted him in the air. His grasp was firm yet deadly. Travis growled from the pit of his stomach, shooting daggers into Abbot's face. He struggled, gasping for air as his airways were slowly crushed. His skin became a light shade of violet as Travis tightened the noose. 

""You-miserable little piss ant. My body flows with god's golden ichor-you think-silver will stop me?!?"" He got out-hiding the searing pain as he focused his mind.

 ""Y-you can talk?"" was all Abbott could choke out. Outside the wolves roared for more food, demanding another morsel. Travis stormed towards the brass door and kicked it open. He showed the horde the squirming Abbott in his hands as they foamed at the mouth. He brought Abott close to his snout to give him a final farewell. 

""This isn't personal human-this is simply divine retribution. This is the night of the werewolves. Now run for your life."" With that he tossed him to the crowd. Abbott stumbled to his feet as the wolves encircled him. To his credit he didn't beg, he didn't cry. He went for his gun and got a round off before the wolves pounced and began tearing him to bits. By the time they were finished all that remained of Abbott was a bloodstain on the floor and some chewed bones.

The leaderless pack roared and cheered like loons in the night-then turned their attention to each other. The wolves barked and jeered at each other like wild dogs, which Travis supposed they were. He watched them begin to turn on each other, these lost godless souls. Travis stepped forward and roared. The marauding wolves stepped back cowering. 

""Brothers and sisters-cease your petty bickering. You've been down here too long-your minds are wasted away-let me guide you to the promised land. You've never even seen him up close, have you?"" He pondered that last bit to himself as he plowed through the crowd, leading his found flock out of the dark.

\-----------

Tamara was not a part of that-she had slipped away in the chaos and climbed backup stairs. She had her fill. The mindless feeding sickened her now. What these hunters had done was abhorrent, but as she looked upon the scattered remains-she felt hollow. There had been no justice in this. Under the watchful crimson eye, she changed back, a painful force but the danger had passed. 

She found the jeep, still rumbling away in the night and stole it. As she drove away from the bunker of horrors-she noticed something sticking out of the sun visor.

She opened it and an old rosary fell to her hands. As the Jeep tumbled and rolled on the rocky road, she felt the wooden cross under her bloodstained nails. Her mother had always told her to say her prayers at night, lest the devil come under the moonlight and whisk her away. She thought of the lives she had taken, and the cross felt heavy in her hands. She placed it on her lap and stared straight ahead, silently reciting a prayer for the dead, and for mercy to be had on those who remained. 

\-------------------

The wolf pack poured out of the shaft and into the shadows of the night. Free for the first time in months they danced and howled, marveling at the majesty of the moon above. Travis climbed the roof of the cabin, basking in the glory of triumph. The wolf pack cheered him on-howling and braying like good little followers. He pointed up at the crimson lord and called out to his flock. 

""This is your god my friends-and I am its prophet."" He roared to thunderous howls. ""You are all blessed under the shadow of the blood moon. Hear my words, and worship at my altar."" The wolves cried out in praise, praise for the moon and praise for him. He basked in their adoration. There would be much work to be done in the morning-once the haze of blood and gore had passed.

This place would make a good den for the pack. He would sort them out, teach them the proper ways like his master before him. There were about forty total wolves, a good start indeed-soon enough he would teach them to seek out others he would deem worthy of the blessing, others worthy of their creed.

But that was tomorrow. For now, he joined the chorus of bellowing monsters, celebrating the god above. As he indulged in the carnal galla with the rest of the pack. The sanguine night belonged to them, and the forest would forever tremble against their never-ending lust for blood.",1,1769019815.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1qj5rub,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1qj5rub/a_conversation_with_an_indian_roaster_that_made/,A conversation with an Indian roaster that made me rethink brew temperature.,"I am in Bhopal atm and met Navneet, who runs a cafe + roastery here. 

I met him in his cafe and he was super friendly and easy to talk to. He has also been judging the Indore/bhopal edition of world aeropress championship since past few years.

We ended up chatting about Indian coffee and brewing, and he shared a couple of perspectives that stuck with me.

He mentioned that most Indian coffees are grown around 1000–1300 masl, so the beans are generally less dense than high-altitude African or Latin American coffees. 

Because of that, they tend to extract more easily, and you don’t necessarily need near-boiling water for  light roast. 

Case in point: His barista made me Orchardale Estate med-light coffee  brewed on a Chemex at \~75 degree Celsius, which surprised me. 

it was genuinely good. I could clearly feel the acidity, felt that it was low bodied, and there was zero bitterness. It didn’t feel under extracted, just soft and very enjoyable. 

I ended up buying a pack to brew at home. I am now going to compare the 75 with 80-85 degree brew to see if there is an even better sweet spot. it definitely was a little unbelievable to see a med-light roast extracted so well at 75. 

He also felt that degassing times for Indian coffees don’t need to be super long, a few days post-roast is often enough, and the usual “wait two weeks for light roast” advice may be more applicable to very dense coffees or espresso.

A lot of what he mentioned did sound interesting but I am gonna test it out to see if I am able to reproduce the same results with lower temperatures and shorter degassing periods.

Did you guys see better extractions at lower temperatures? especially for light and medium roasts? 

or peak coffee taste with a shorter resting period? I'm definitely putting these theories to a test in the next couple of weeks.

PS:

also, try handcrafted coffee if you can order online from their site, definitely worth a try.

Navneet mentioned that they don't market the roastery so much because the customer acquisition cost is a little high. A customer has to buy a few kg of coffee for them to recover the cost of acquiring them. ",5,1769019800.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

So I 23f have never had a boyfriend, no sex, etc (not religious, just didn’t prioritize in high school or college).

After having deleted the apps, I’ve decided I don’t really see myself using them ever again due to bad experiences. Things like being over-sexualized, being ghosted, bad communication, withholding information that impacts compatibility (ex. one guy had family that would disown him if we dated (due to race), but didn’t tell me until like 6 dates in lol), etc.

I’m trying to make an effort to have more coed hobbies going forward, so for example, I’ve enrolled in coed soccer. I should also probably mention that I don’t drink, smoke, or go  clubbing. I just don’t have friends that are really into that, so I’ve never gone).

I just feel like outside of the apps, my chances are almost 0%. So, is there anything I’m missing or that I can change about my approach to meeting and dating men?

Place - Revere PD crime lab

After getting a call that the DNA results from the pussy blood found at both scenes has come back, Murphy and Corso are meeting with Revere police department forensics expert Jenna Bosco. Bosco is 24 years old, has blonde hair and blue eyes, cute with an athletic figure. Since joining the department, she has quickly become Murphy’s go to analyst due to her expertise and undeniable skills.

With coffee in hand both detectives step into the elevator to the basement, which had recently been upgraded into a full scale crime lab. The elevator door opens, Murphy instinctively places his arm over the threshold to hold the door for Corso as he steps out.  Murphy watches the tall young detective stride forward. He thinks about the first time he met him back when Corso was just a rookie filled with piss and vinegar. Murphy often tells the kid how he reminds him of himself when he was that old. Corso made the jump to detective as fast as anybody in the department. Murphy even vouched for him and helped push his promotion through, in hopes he would be able to mentor him before he retired in the next few years. The detectives walk briskly down the hall and hit the buzzer to enter, the glass doors slide open and they walk into the lab. Murphy bellows, ""Hey Bosco, give me some good news, we could use a win here...whaddya got?""

Bosco looks up from her monitor as Murphy and Corso walk between the desks inside the lab and gets up to meet them halfway. With a sarcastic tone, she quips while greeting the detectives, “Before we get to that...Murphy you look like absolute shit. When was the last time you got some sleep? She then turns her attention to Corso who is barely older than she is, ""And for fucks sake Corso, they haven't fired you yet?""

Corso laughs out loud sarcastically, then loudly sips his coffee and replies, ""My gainful employment is a mystery to us all... still good to see you too Jenna.”

Murphy gestures to the blood samples on the table in front of him while laughing as well but is here to get down to business. ""OK enough fucking around..I bet Corso 12 bucks it was pussy blood we found at both scenes...one of us is going to be right and one is going to eat some crow. Now it's time to pay up for one of us. Was I right or wrong? You know I can smell a drop of poon-aid in a raging river from 250 yards away.""

Bosco rolls her eyes at Murphy long enough to stop laughing and puts on her professional face before answering, ""I don't know how you knew but you're right Murphy. The darkfield microscope the captain got for us is amazing. Not only is it able to tell us everything about the blood that we want to know, like blood type, presence of drugs or alcohol, but in this case I could see there were skin cells from when the uterine wall sheds. This is 100% the blood from a pussy…from the looks of it she is a gusher too.""

Corso smile fades into a look of defeat, he shakes his head slowly in disbelief, ""No fucking way.""

Murphy triumphantly raises his arms above his head, imitating a touchdown, and laughs. He puts out his hand, palm up, gesturing towards the center. “C'mon Corso...12 bucks? Pay up.. a bet is a  bet.""

Corso hangs his head before he pulls his wallet out and hands over 12 singles. ""You know I was saving that money for this years Twerkathon at Tidday's."" 

Murphy sips his coffee. ""Ok Bosco..so we got a match? Who is she?""

Bosco replies quickly. ""Got no clue, she doesn't match anybody in our database. But there's more, the blood came from two different visits from aunt flow…""

Murphy is now the one with the look of amazement. ""Two different batches, how can you tell?"" 

Bosco walks over to her laptop and opens a small file. “See here. The skin cells that are present are aged differently, they break down over time like anything else. We can see the difference and get a time frame. The source of this blood came from the same woman but nearly a year apart as best we can tell.""

Murphy responds like a man who has been married for more than 20 years.”Are you telling me our killer is a woman and once she is on the rag she becomes a killer?""

Bosco laughs at how simple Murphy is. “No, no way it is a woman unless she can bench press Corso. The stab wounds on Finn didn't just hit soft tissue. The autopsy showed the knife got stuck in bone on at least three separate thrusts. Whoever killed Finn was pretty damn strong, a retard possibly. In any case you are probably looking for a guy who goes to the gym a lot.""

Corso utters. ""A football player?""

Bosco thinks about it for a second. “Possibly and he is around eight or nine nine-inch dicks tall, based on the angle of the wounds. These came in a downward motion."" Bosco picks up a pen and  demonstrates the swinging motion she believes was used. ""Then on Clausen, the blunt force trauma to the head was strong enough to shatter his cranium."" 

Murphy giggles at the unit of measurement Bosco chose. “Wait, did you just use a nine-inch dick as a unit of measurement? “

Bosco pulls up six separate images of skulls on a wall screen and without a pause says, “A girls gotta have her standards.”

Murphy looks down at his own crotch, shrugs his shoulders and says, “Fair play.”

Bosco continues to display the forensic photos from her files. “This one here is Clausen, you can see how the skull was crushed, leading to massive hemorrhaging.”

Murphy walks closer to the wall screen and points, ""What about this one?""

Bosco replies  ""That guy fell off his roof and landed on his head from about 21 nine-inch dicks up, he died on impact.""

Corso blushes, he is unwilling to even question how she arrived at this new system. He chooses instead to move on and then inquires about the next images, ""And these two? Holy shit it looks like someone hit them with a sledgehammer.”

Bosco nods her head. “Funny you should mention that. This is the skull of coach Gillbride.""

Murphy's voice has a touch of wonder in it, ""Kevin Gilbride? Didn't he get punched in the face by Buddy Ryan during a game once?""

Bosco laughs ""I'm not old enough to remember Murph. He died a few years ago in a pregame football stunt gone wrong.""

Corso excitedly responds, ""Fuck me, I remember that. He was coaching up in Buffalo and they paid Cannon Balls to come throw out the ceremonial first pass. Gilbride was wearing a helmet cam…craziest shit I ever saw. The ball hit him dead in the face, but he held on to it..was a helluva catch."" 

Bosco replies, ""Yeah, that was it. Even though he caught it, the ball still hit his face. Went right through the face mask and stuck in his skull. Catastrophic trauma killed him instantly.""

Murphy expresses clear admiration for the retired quarterback ""Man, Balls could really spin it..can't believe he managed to hold on to it. I watched that replay about 60 times.""

Corso shows deference to the deceased. ""Damn right he did...dude was a soldier. Anyway, what were you saying Bosco?""

Bosco jokingly replies, ""Now that you two are done with your hero worship. I was  saying whoever did this used pussy blood from the same woman with a bled on date more than 2 years apart.""

Murphy is unable to hide his shock. ""Mother fucker.. this is worse than I thought..we got a real sick son of a bitch on our hands here.""",0,1769019442.0,stories,0,0.5,False

My friends are either glued to OF or complaining they can't connect with real people anymore. The platform's become this weird elephant in the room nobody wants to talk about, but the research on what it does to our brains is actually pretty concerning.

I spent weeks diving into behavioral psychology, addiction studies, neuroscience podcasts, and articles from relationship therapists. Not because I'm judging anyone, but because the patterns were impossible to ignore. Turns out there's actual science explaining why this stuff rewires our reward systems and expectations. The good news? Understanding the mechanics makes it way easier to take control back.

 what's actually happening in your brain

 Your dopamine system gets hijacked. Dr. Anna Lembke's book Dopamine Nation (she's Stanford's addiction medicine chief, btw) explains how high-stimulation content creates this pleasure-pain balance problem. Your brain starts needing more intense stimulation just to feel normal. The book literally changed how I view any addictive behavior, best neuroscience read I've had in years. She breaks down why we're all basically walking around overstimulated and how to reset.

 Parasocial relationships feel real but aren't. There's research from communication studies showing these one-sided connections trigger the same brain regions as actual relationships, but without reciprocity. You're essentially training your brain that intimacy requires zero vulnerability or effort. Professor Jennifer Barnes studied this phenomenon at Oklahoma, her work's all over YouTube if you want to go deeper.

 Comparison kills attraction to real people. Psychologist Gary Wilson (he wrote Your Brain on Porn) talks about the Coolidge effect, where novelty becomes necessary for arousal. When you have unlimited access to algorithmically perfect content, regular people start seeming bland. Not because they are, but because your baseline shifted. 

 practical ways to unfuck your brain

 Do a 30 day full detox. Delete the apps, block the sites, whatever it takes. Sounds dramatic but neuroplasticity research shows your brain needs about 3-4 weeks to start rewiring reward pathways. Track how you feel in a notes app daily. The first week sucks. Week two you'll probably feel weirdly emotional. Week three things start leveling out.

 Replace the habit, don't just delete it. When you get the urge, have a specific alternative ready. 

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that creates personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans based on what you actually want to work on. Built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers, it pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to generate custom podcasts for you. 

You can literally tell it ""help me understand relationship psychology"" or ""why do I keep falling into these patterns"" and it'll create content that fits your schedule, whether that's a 10-minute summary or a 40-minute deep dive with real examples. The adaptive learning plan evolves based on your progress and struggles. Plus there's this virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with anytime to dig deeper or get book recommendations. 

Way more structured than just random YouTube rabbit holes, and the content actually sticks because it's tailored to where you're at mentally.

 Relearn how to be attracted to real humans. Start noticing people IRL without any agenda. The barista making your coffee, someone at the gym, whatever. Just practice finding real people interesting again without the performance aspect. Takes time but it genuinely works.

 Get comfortable with boredom. This sounds stupid but Dr. Sandi Mann's research on boredom shows it's actually crucial for creativity and genuine desire. If you're constantly stimulated, you never build up natural wanting. Try just sitting for 10 minutes doing absolutely nothing. Your brain will hate it initially.

 why real connection beats pixels

 Actual intimacy requires discomfort. The podcast Where Should We Begin? with Esther Perel (she's basically the relationship therapist) goes deep on this. Real attraction involves uncertainty, vulnerability, rejection risk. That's what makes it actually rewarding. OF removes all that friction, which sounds good but kills the whole reward mechanism.

 Your dating life reflects your consumption. Multiple studies in the Journal of Sex Research link high pornography use with lower relationship satisfaction. Not because sex is bad, but because the expectation-reality gap becomes massive. You start approaching real people like they're content to consume rather than humans to connect with.

 The performance anxiety feedback loop. Sex therapist Ian Kerner's work shows how passive consumption creates active performance anxiety. You're watching instead of participating, which translates to real encounters where you're in your head instead of present.

Look, I'm not here to moralize about whether OF is ethical or whatever. But the psychological impact on users is pretty clear cut once you see the research. The platform's designed to keep you hooked using the same mechanisms as gambling apps. Social psychologist Adam Alter wrote Irresistible about this exact thing, how tech companies engineer behavioral addiction. Insanely good read if you want to understand why you can't just ""use less willpower.""

The weirdest part? Once I stepped back for a month, real people became interesting again. Not in some magical way, just normal attraction started working how it's supposed to. My friends who did the same thing reported similar stuff. Turns out human brains are pretty good at recalibrating when you stop flooding them with supernormal stimuli.

The research is clear that these patterns are manageable once you understand what's happening neurologically. It's not about becoming some monk, just about recognizing when a product's designed to exploit your brain's weaknesses and deciding whether that trade-off is worth it.",1,1769019391.0,BornWeakBuiltStrong,0,1.0,False

This morning between 9am-11am I’ve gone pee at lease 4 times. The problem also is that I can’t hold it- I have to go constantly and I have to go NOW. I can hold it if I’m busy or whatever but what is frustrating is when I’m in the bathroom about to sit down and can’t hold it. Like leaky?. It’s like I’m having little accidents all day and it’s soooo embarrassing. Then I’m wondering if I smell like pee etc etc. 

I do drink a lot of water but my partner drinks probably more and she doesn’t have this same problem. 

I don’t want to drink less water bc I’d like to be hydrated.

I know kegels may help.

I know frequent urination can be a symptom of diabetes?

“It’s a little bit like VR,” she said, “but not fully.  It’s a scope and a network.”

The electrode jelly smelled minty and fresh.  I pressed them into the ocular device.  It was so strange.  I don’t know how to explain it.  My best friend was in there, in the ocular device.

It felt real real.  She was delivering packages as she does for a living.  I could smell the cold air as she jumped from the delivery truck.  She hobbled on her feet, was staring down at them limping.

But then.

Then she looked right at me.  It felt she looked right in my eyes and said to me, “my feet are growing horns on  the botttom.”

I listened to her deciding not to interrupt right away but instead to just listened.  I really listened then I noticed Valetie was speaking to herself.

“Valerie,,” Valerie said to herself, “just get through the day.”

She stared down at her feet.  “Are you able to get some orthopedic pads,” I asked, but to my dismay she flipped her head around like she was scared of the voices in her head.

“Valerie, your foot horns are cracking your foot in half,” Valerie cried holding her heel.  She leaned down to run her fingers over the horns. I saw the translucent skin bulging.

I pulled back from the ocular device, “I’m finished for today,” I announced to Dr Nitric hoping she’d pay me for my time even if I cut it short.  “I need a break.  I can’t process more.”

It was enough for me to get a candy bar and some coffee.  I was happy.

But then.

Valerie called me.  Don’t judge me, but I didn’t pick up.  I was still processing what I’d seen in the ocular.   She called twice so I picked up thinking maybe she had an emergency.

“I have some sort of bone spur in my heel,” Valerie told me.  I paused my breath.

“Like a horn,” I asked but her tears flooded.

“How did you know,” she sobbed, “I’m losing it, Maria. It’s driving me mental.”

“What do you mean,” I asked my headphones while holding my coffee as I balanced along the sidewalk in a hurry to get home.  I went fast on my scooter because Stanley, my new bf,  was coming over.

I offer her to go see her doctor immediately.

I call Dr. Nitrica, “why did the ocular vision show me my friend’s real pain? Is that normal?”

“No, that’s not normal, does it make you want to drop out of the experiment,” Dr Nitric asked.

I didn’t drop out. Okay, I didn’t stop.  And after a few weeks of doing the ocular, I started screaming out of nowhere.

I couldn’t help it - the screams filled my head till I finally screamed at the top of my lungs.

I called Dr. Nitrica to talk about it and told her I’m coming over.  I had a problem that had begun since starting the experiment.

As I climbed the steps I heard that scream, that scream that was filling my head only it sounded muffled.

I climbed faster thinking I know that scream.  By the time I reached the top, I busted into the laboratory.  My head was full of screaming.

But then it stopped and right there sitting with Dr. Nitrica  was  my ex.

“Why are you letting him do this to me,” I asked while holding back my urge to sit on her.  Sit on him. On them both. “Why are you doing this to me,” I begged.

“I’m doing nothing,"" Dr Nitrica said firmly, “you see those you care about, that’s how the ocular device works.

An agonizing shriek filled my head.  “I will shriek back at you every time,” I told him.

I stomped out but the truth was my voice was already hoarse.   I didn’t slam the door even.  Dr. Nitric  was giving my ex-free rent in my head and there was nothing much I could do about it right then.",2,1769019119.0,DarkStories,0,1.0,False

I came to New York from South Carolina in hopes of making something of myself. Life back home was challenging to say the least. My parents died young in a car accident when I was six, and then I moved in with my Nana, Aurora.

She was my everything. A caring, wonderful woman, an example for all humans. Unfortunately, as with all of us, her body couldn’t keep up with her brilliant mind. She helped me cultivate my emotions into passions. Through art. Her paintings could make me feel like it was just me and the painting, like the only two things in the entire universe.

With all the scrap on our farm, I got into metalworking. I would make all sorts of art, but I really took a liking to turning my pieces into flowers. Something so gentle, soft, and full of life, in contrast to the cold, hard metal, completely devoid of anything living.

When South Carolina had nothing to offer me anymore, no family, no real work, no purpose, I thought, fuck it, and moved to New York. That’s what artists do, right? Sleeping in my car by night, displaying my pieces on the street by day. If it weren’t for the kind workers at the bakery nearby, I’m not really sure how I would have made it without the coffee and bread handouts. 

I guess all these cold, hard New Yorkers don’t really like pieces made of the same grain as them.

Then I met Poem.

She was twenty-five, such a contrast to me. She came from money, went to a top university, had a loving family that she actually got to spend time with. Opposites, like my work. It felt like my soul had been taken from me and rewritten. Like my purpose was to love and to be loved by her.

The warmth of the sun that was my Nana, Aurora, had set and was never coming back, but this woman, Poem, she turned the lights on. Not only did she show me what it feels like to love again, but because of her family connections, she was able to get me into some very prestigious art shows.

It really took off. From sleeping in my car to sleeping on jets to London, to Paris, to Monaco. We had a life. The life. Eventually, we decided to start a family in our early thirties to share this wonderful life that we had, and I got to be the father that I never got to have.

We have two kids. I’m now fifty-three. My daughter, Samantha, is twenty and attending NYU. My son, Jason, is seventeen and set to attend Harvard Law School when he graduates this year. How far I’ve come doesn’t even seem real.

How was all this possible?

I’ve experienced both the highest highs and the lowest lows in life, but life is so good now. Do I even deserve all this? It’s Poem. The only reason I can live the way I do. I wouldn’t change anything. I have the family I’ve always wanted to be part of, and yes, I credit this to Poem.

She is my everything. And now I have two amazing kids to give myself to with all the love I can.

I was always drawn to Poem. She made me feel like Nana’s art was living through her. It felt almost otherworldly, like a necessity to live. She was the breath to my lungs.

I remember back when I moved. I managed to take one of Nana’s paintings with me. I had it stored in my attic, and I haven’t really seen it since I moved in. Part of me didn’t want a reminder of my Nana’s warmth, but looking back at my life, I think now is the time.

So I go upstairs and open the attic door.

It’s in this box in the corner. And as soon as I see the box, I get that same otherworldly feeling again. A strange drawing, but this time an unsettling presence, some sort of aura. I walk closer and get this feeling like I’m being watched. I turn around, and there’s nothing there. It feels as if someone, or something knows I am here. I guess I credit this to past trauma. Whatever. So I walk up and open the box.

There it is, encapsulating me as always. But I can’t stop staring at it. It’s almost as if I’m blocked in some sort of paralytic trance. It’s beautiful, but for some reason, scary. Something doesn’t feel right.

The painting was one of Nana’s favorites. It was of two schoolchildren holding hands walking in the park. But the girl in the painting, she was holding something.

I don’t really remember that.

I take a closer look.

It’s a flower?

A, black flower…

The moment of realizing that, it felt like someone just smashed me in the back of the head. Everything went dark. I saw my life flash before my eyes. The car crash, Nana hands, my children’s births, attending parent-teacher conferences, laughter.

Then nothing.

I don’t know how long the darkness lasts, how long I am here. There’s no sense of time or anything at all.

Then I wake up.

I’m in the shower. My head is throbbing. I put my hand on the back of my head. Red. It’s blood. A lot of it. 

I must have fallen.

I get out of the shower and look in the mirror.

I can’t believe it. It all comes back to me.

The name is not Sam. It’s John. I am a 16 year old boy from Utah who just hit his head in the shower. I am an only child.

My parents are alive. 

Thats what they tell me. I stare into the mirror trying to recognize myself. It seems off. Too young. Too unfamiliar, like I am wearing someone else’s face. 

I feel a pressure in my chest.

Poem, Nana’s hands, Samantha’s laugh, Jason’s quiet pride. 

I glance down at my hands. Callused and scared.  In ways a 16 year old boys shouldn’t be.

A thought floods my head, a flower. I don’t remember picking it up. 

But it’s there, resting on the bathroom counter. 

Black metal petals curling inward like they are protecting something.

Met him years later and realised I’ve ruined his life and I still feel worthless because of it.

I’ll keep this short because I don’t know what I’m even doing posting on Reddit. I’ve been depressed for a while, F30, and have felt worthless for years now. I thought I’d visit my home town where I grew up as some some of sentimental kick up the ass for myself, not sure why really, thought it would help. Ended up bumping in to some man (same age was in my year in school), who I completely traumatised when we were younger because of  my most regrettable moment in my life, and probably the source of my self loathing.

The short end of it was I was a really angry moody kid and him and his friends would poke fun at me and my friends - completely harmless stuff, kid stuff. But one day I just snapped and ended up jumping/stamping on him in his privates when he was laying under a tree. It was pure fury, it was so excessive and I hate that I did. The damage was so bad he needed surgery to remove his testicles because they burst or ruptured or something. That was in school and I’ve served so much mental warfare with myself because of that, but we grew up anyway.

So, I saw him, went for a coffee, caught up. That man is the sweetest man, I could just tell immediately that he has a heart of gold, but told me how his dream was to have kids of his own, and it never works out for him with his partners. He doesn’t hold a grudge to me even though he should. I hate myself even more now. Nothing I can do will ever fix that. I have ruined a man’s life because of one short fused aggressive moment. That happened 20 years ago. I have never felt so low.

1qj5c6h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qj5c6h,Arizona Snowbowl near Flagstaff is wildly underrated for family & friends trips ❄️🌲,"If you still think Arizona is just cactus, heat, and regret, Snowbowl is here to embarrass that assumption.
Arizona Snowbowl sits just outside Flagstaff, tucked into the San Francisco Peaks, and it feels like it escaped from a different state entirely. Pine trees. Real snow. Crisp mountain air that makes you remember lungs are a thing. It’s one of those places where kids forget about screens and adults forget about inboxes. Rare magic.
In winter, it’s an obvious win. Skiing and snowboarding for all skill levels, lessons for kids, and enough wide runs that nobody feels rushed or judged. Even if half your group just wants to sip hot chocolate and watch snow fall, they’ll still feel like they “did something.” Everyone wins.
But Snowbowl isn’t just a winter-only flex.
Spring and summer turn it into a totally different kind of adventure. Scenic gondola rides take you to the top with views that stretch across Northern Arizona. On a clear day you can see the Grand Canyon. That alone shuts people up in the best way. Hiking trails around the mountain are family-friendly, cool even in summer, and surrounded by tall pines that make it feel calm instead of chaotic.
Fall might be the sneaky favorite. Cooler temps, golden aspens, fewer crowds, and that quiet mountain vibe that makes conversations actually happen. Bring friends, bring family, bring someone who “doesn’t like the outdoors” and watch them change their mind.
Flagstaff being so close is a bonus. Cozy cabins, local food, coffee shops, breweries, and that small mountain-town energy that feels relaxed without being boring. You can ski in the morning, eat well at night, and still sleep somewhere comfortable. No survival skills required.
Snowbowl is one of those rare places that works for: • Families with young kids
• Teens who need something cool enough to impress them
• Friends who want adventure without chaos
• People who want nature without roughing it
Arizona doesn’t get enough credit for places like this, and honestly, Snowbowl is proof that you don’t need to leave the state to build memories that stick.
If you’ve been, you know. If you haven’t, you’re overdue.

As I research brewing changes, I feel more confused. Can someone with the same hardware as I have help me dial it in so it all doesn’t go to waste? 

I am using a K-max at setting 060. 

93 C water, water is distilled with third wave medium packet.

V60 switch using cafec abaca filters. 

Method: 320 grams water to 20 grams coffee. Open pour for 45 seconds, 160 grams water. Turn flow off, pour rest of 160 grams, wait until 2 minutes and then open. 

I’ve tried 065 and 062 settings. Not a ton of change.  065 was sort of lacking flavor. I’ve done 95 ac water and not much change. ",1,1769018741.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
1qj59wh,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qj59wh/just_another_summer_in_95_pt3/,Just Another Summer In ‘95 pt3,"In the morning things were different. The mood around camp had shifted entirely as the volunteers seemed to be packing up their tents into their broncos, Steph watched from afar in her camp chair with her rifle on her lap as she clasped a tin of black coffee

“What’s going on?”. I asked her.

She grunted and gestured to the blue percolator sitting nearby with a swing of her head.

“Coffee first”.

I let out an almost bemused huff as I poured myself a cup. I looked around for any sugar or creamer but realized quickly it was only a lofty fantasy. I sat down close by, wrinkling my nose at the sensation of slightly burnt Maxwell House coating my throat.

“Why’s everyone leaving?” I finally asked.

“They found another body” she said without looking at me.

I raised an eyebrow.

“Shouldn’t we bring more people here then?”

“He had a 22 in his leg.” She said casually as she took a long sip from her chipped mug.

“Someone shot him?” 

“Mhm…state bird found him on a ridge line without a shirt. Guess he was smart enough to use his shirt to stop the bleeding but…lost too much blood so hypothermia did the rest.” 

“How could that have happened? Jess didn’t mention hearing a gunshot…”

“No? Eh a scared girl like her ain’t reliable. Memory’s a fickle thing when shit hits the fan”.

She remarked while rolling her neck before continuing.

“Some of the deputies think one of ‘em was packing a peashooter to score some pussy and wound up shooting each other in the panic, when that thing came for ‘em. Or maybe it's some jackass spotlighting off season.”

“Spotlighting?” I asked tilting my head ever so slightly.

“Yeah, shining a beam on a deer at night so it freezes. Makes it easy to drop ’em. Illegal as hell.”

“So…what does that mean for us?”

“Means you’re probably getting benched. They already sending the volunteers back. Seasonals are next on the choppin’ block.”

I let out a long sigh 

“Guess I better start packing then-“ I muttered.

“Would reckon ya should”. She replied offhandedly.

It didn’t take long for me to gather everything up. I sat on my pack not sure what to even do at this point.

“You really oughta head on home, Ash.” Stephanie remarked as she poured over a map with a marker in hand.

“Thats what everyone keeps saying…they just want me to sit this one out” 

Frustration slithered into my voice as my fist balled. The ranger turned her head to gaze at from over her shoulder.

“It ain’t cause we don’t think ya can stick it out here girl.”

I grit my teeth a little as days of pent up fury from these tragedies started to overflow into my throat. 

“I just want to fucking do something for once instead of just…reacting to all this shit!” 

Stephanie let out a sigh as she folded up the map and fully turned her attention to me.

“That fire in ya…I remember I used to have it too. But then…I realized this place doesn’t give two shits about your intentions…your character…your family. It will rip you apart without battin’ an eye and leave ya in the dirt like trash for the crows.”

She ran a hand through her greying hair as she continued.

“Do yourself a favor hun and go find yourself a nice comfy job or a man in California or New York or any one of them places. You’ll live longer”.

I was left speechless but I couldn’t leave, not yet. How could I just run away with my tail between my legs and pretend everything is normal again. Go back to the dorms with the same girls gossiping about the same guys, reading the same magazines. 

Stephanie muttered an apology between a sigh and turned to walk away but I said something before she could.

“I’m done running from this.” 

I knew she heard me but she didn’t say anything. I walked away to my truck and sat in the padded seat after that with all my gear ready to go. I wondered where I would even go after this. Would they just stick me behind a desk at some visitor center or a booth at some campgrounds? 

That's exactly what they did. Despite the bodies being found and the uniforms crawling everywhere. The campgrounds weren't empty, the trails stayed open. If anything I found myself handing out more camping permits than usual. It's like all the commotion was attracting curious tourists. I even heard from one of the out of towners bragging about our park being on CNN. It was like some new theme park attraction to them. Tour buses full of tourists with SLRs hanging around their necks and camcorders strapped to their hands seemingly flooded the park in a matter of days. They seemed hellbent on the fame of being the one to snap a photo of these man eating animals as they called them.

Despite all my warnings I tried to give them. Like staying on the trail and not wandering off. Not going hiking at night, always bringing bear spray. Locking up smellables. It didn’t matter. It was useless. Their eyes glazed over as soon as my words left my mouth.

Just as I was about to wonder if Steph and Jake were right I overheard someone mentioning that the guy that was supposed to work in tower 3 never showed cause of the headlines scaring everyone. I knew at that moment this would be my only chance to make things right. Jake raised an eyebrow at my request to man tower 3 but he didn’t ask many questions. He just sighed and penned me in without giving me too much of a fuss. He muttered that I would be starting next week before I left work for the day.

Like the end of all my shifts as of late I found myself driving to the only video store in town. It was the center piece of the one strip mall that Ravenwood could claim to hold. The windows of the store were plastered with posters of that newish Die Hard movie all the guys at work talked about during smoke breaks. I found myself wandering the blank tapes section as the overhead lights buzzed above me. The scent of day-old popcorn and plastic filled my nostrils.

My thumb trailed over the shelves crammed with brightly designed cases of empty tapes . I grabbed a few and tossed them in my basket. On the other side of the store I could hear the chattering voices of a pair of kids as they excitedly flipped through those Nintendo Power magazines and squealed about new 3D games. 

I found myself cracking a smile at their excited voices as I stood in line at the register. As the cashier started to scan my tapes he smiled at me and remarked how it must get lonely watching all those tapes by myself and how that could always change. 

I almost giggled like a schoolgirl at how just normal it seemed. After everything, just getting hit on by some guy at a store who was probably still a senior in high school felt so alien to me. Everyone part of me wanted to say yes, but I know I couldn’t. I gave him a nervous smile and apologized, I told him I wouldn’t be good company. He just sort of nodded and said maybe next time. 

I couldn’t help but flinch when the TV behind him howled that scene from Jurassic park where Maldoon gets his face ripped off by that raptor. His horrible screams almost sounded familiar to me now as he was ripped apart under the palm trees. I almost imagined hearing screams just like that at those campgrounds before Felix and I got there. Whatever that elk was grabbing Jess's boyfriend and dragging him away as the scent of iron intertwined with burning firewood and their screams were drowned out by Nirvana.

Even as I walked outside I couldn’t stop repeating it in my head over and over. A voice that was familiar to me called out.

“Ash?”

I turned to see Felix standing just next to his truck with a collection of shitty action movies cradled under his arm.

“Oh hey-“ I greeted trying to keep my voice steady.

“You alright? You look a little pale.” He remarked as he raised an eyebrow at my current state.

“I’m fine…just a little tired” I said, forming a disarming smile. Which seemed to satisfy him well enough for now.

“Can’t blame you, heard you were going for tower duty. You planning on staying there for the rest of this season till this shit storm blows over?”

I shrugged and adjusted my grip on the bag of tapes in my hand.

“Something like that. Why do you ask?”

He hummed a little and reached into his carhartt and pulled out a blank envelope.

“Here, it's for you”

“Is that-“ I started but he cut me off.

“Just take it”. He insisted as he pushed the envelope into the plastic bag at my side despite my protests.

“I don’t understand-“

Felix let out what I would call a dad grumble and focused his gaze at me

“Look, I know I can’t talk you out of going out there but- I still just want you to be safe.”

I couldn’t meet his gaze as my silence was the only answer I could provide.

“You’re gonna need more than whatever revolver Jake has you parading around in out there. 

I finally let out a sigh and accepted defeat and muttered an acknowledgment.

“Just make sure you zero the scope of any rifle you get Annie Oakley,”

I let out a muffled groan.

“You’re such an ass…” I muttered.

“I know I’m awful if you need help with getting a handle on one lemme know alright?” He said with a grin forming on his scraggly face.

“Sure…thanks Felix this is-“

“Don’t mention it, now I gotta run and return these tapes. Don’t be stupid without me alright?”

“No promises” I said with a smirk which earned me an eyeroll from him as he brushed past me.

He strode into the store leaving me to my own devices once more. I clutched the plastic bag that held my only comforts for tonight tightly all the way to my car. 

To my surprise the only sporting goods store was still open after dark. Everything about it looked unremarkable from the outside. It was just a wide wooden building with an arched roof with a half lit sign above that said “‘Mike’s Outdoor Supply Store”.

I finally grabbed the envelope from the bag and opened it up. Inside was a neat pile of hundreds that I didn’t bother to count. A part of me didn’t want to even look at this money let alone think of using it. The envelope felt thicker than it should have in my hands. He really didn’t have to do this for me. 

The fading sunlight cut a thin line against the horizon as I shuffled into the store. The door let out a bell like chime as I stepped inside. The smell of gun oil, cheap chewing tobacco and old furs washed over me as I took a few unsure steps forward. I pushed by shelves stuffed with fishing poles and camo jackets to the main counter.

I smiled nervously at the store owner standing in front of the racks full of rifles and shotguns, handwritten toe tags swaying ever so slightly. The many stuffed heads of pronghorns and Mule deer glared down at me with their dead eyes as I approached.

The older man at the counter adjusted his surplus gun belt and smiled at me. I couldn’t help but notice the occupied holster with a faded “US” pressed into the leather flap on it at his side but I didn’t say anything about it.

“Evenin’ miss, what can I fer ya?”

I ran a hand through my long hair as I glanced over at the racks of rifles, not even sure where to begin or even what to get. A part of me wished I dragged Felix here with me.

“Looking for uh…a big game rifle?” I said trying to sound like I knew what I wanted.

“What you hunting? Elk? Moose? Well what about this springfield here?” He reached for a hefty rifle from the rack and locked the bolt to the rear before handing it to me.

“That there will put anything down with antlers this side of the Rockies”.

I found myself flinching from the rifle of wood and steel bearing its weight down on me. Wasn’t really used to having anything heavier than a revolver on me.

“Right uh, what about for something bigger like…a grizzly? I’m working in the fire tower for the season and want some peace of mind”.

I asked as I clumsily handed the clerk the rifle back, my eyes wandering the back counter till the glare of the setting sun flickered against a framed photo of the man standing in a river posing with a kid that was probably young enough to be his grandson. He had a proud smile on his face as the two of them showed off a sizable bass they caught. 

“Well I got something a little heavier here. This Remington 700 BDL in 300 win mag.”

The excitable store owner handed me a scoped rifle of polished wood. I fussed with it for a second as I adjusted its sizable weight in my arms.

“Heavy…” I mumbled and the hunter let out a chuckle.

“Sure is, you won’t be running and gunning with that thing. Basically have to use it with sandbags or a bipod.”

“Alright I’ll take it. Uhm can I get two boxes of ammo for it?”

He nodded and placed two boxes of ammo on the counter in a flash.

“If you’re gonna use it on grizzly. You’re gonna want these. Federal Soft points, this’ll give you a wallop”.

I nodded and let out a muttered gratitude as he set down an official looking paper in front of me after I handed the rifle back to him. 

“Out of stater right?”

“Uhm yeah-“ he nodded once and set out a few pens for me. 

Thats fine I just need your license…and I’ll phone the sheriff. In the meantime just need you to fill out this 4473 for me. I'll be back in a jiffy.”

He disappeared to the back with my license as I filled it out. Within a few minutes he came back out and handed my ID back.

“Everything looks good. You want a Harris? Sling? It's on me”.

“You don’t have to-“ I let out a dejected huff as he insisted on putting on the bipod and sling for me. While he talked my ear off about his grandson shooting his first gopher last week. The paperwork went by quicker than I thought and before I knew it I was walking out the door.

I bought a few more things with the envelope as I walked out with the rifle case. Even as I found myself back at that crummy cabin I couldn’t help but wonder if I was living on borrowed time. 

I set my things down and inserted the blank tape into the VCR and set it to record as my little cabin filled with the sound of melodramatic soap operas as the microwave buzzed as it spun a TV dinner around. I settled in the ugly couch that had now been converted into a bed of sorts with sheets and proper pillows that I salvaged from my cot. 

I dug a plastic fork into the processed Salisbury steak. I couldn't help but remember those weekday nights. Mom came home from the hospital in her scrubs with the scent of iodine and iron clinging to her not even having the energy to do anything more than put some Swansons in the oven and call it dinner. Something about her weary eyes stopped me from complaining about how weird and watery the mashed potatoes tasted even when I was younger.

The memories of my childhood faded away as I laid down on the couch and tried my best to fall asleep. Every now and again I would wake up in spurts and feed the VCR a new tape. The mediocre soap operas changed to infomercials and bogus psychic hotlines. I grumbled in annoyance as I switched sleeping positions and tried my best to go back to sleep.

The days began to blur together with my desk job, it just felt like one big countdown till I switched over. What little time I spent off the job. I was with Felix at a property his buddy owned zeroing in that new rifle. Blasting apart old coke bottles and knocking down the metal outlines of deer. The rifle kicked like hell and was heavy as sin but it packed a punch, that’s all I really needed. 

The day before I was set to go out there, I spent the day packing my truck with gear I would need for what lay ahead. Felix insisted on helping me pack for the trip, I’m not sure why but I appreciated it all the same.

Just as I was closing up the truck, Felix's eyes drew to the worn canvas rifle case.

“So…that's for self defense right?” He asked slowly.

“Yeah? We both know what's out there.” 

Felix’s brow furrowed and he inhaled once.

“I heard, the flares? The boxes of ammo?, The extra gas? That all for self defense too?”

I remained silent as I fussed with a duffel bag’s straps. He let out a tired exhale.

“No chance talking you out of this, is there?”

“I have to do this Felix”.

He shook his head and hissed through his teeth.

“Just…Just be careful alright?” He finally relented, softening his voice a bit.

I finally looked up at him and noticed moisture gathering up in the corner of his eyes. I stopped what I was doing and without even thinking I threw my arms around him. 

“I’ll be careful” I murmured into his shoulder. 

I don’t know how long we stayed like that but we said our final goodbyes and went our separate ways. I couldn’t help but feel a dull ache in my chest for the rest of the day, like I was disappointing my dad all over again.

I slipped two copies of that Polaroid into sealed envelopes. One addressed to the detective from the other night and the other to the state attorney’s office. The walk to the PO box felt like miles but it didn’t matter.

I left early the next day under the cover of dawn’s darkness. The glare of my high beams steadily guided my way as I traversed the unpaved service roads to what lay within. ",1,1769018727.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1qj59do,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qj59do/most_memorable_coffees_of_2025_countrybycountry/,"Most Memorable Coffees of 2025, Country-by-Country","In each year since [2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/18pv2ka/most_memorable_coffees_of_2023_country_by_country/), I took notes of my most memorably enjoyable coffees from each producing country ([you can find my reddit post from last year here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1j8b11a/most_memorable_coffees_of_2024_country_by_country/)).  I like breaking it down by country because even though there is so much variation within each country, there are general trends, and the merits of drinking a lovely coffee from Panama are very different from a lovely coffee from India.  Out of the hundreds of coffees I was fortunate to enjoy in 2025, these are the most enjoyably memorable for me.  It isn’t an objective ‘best of’ list (I’m not even sure such a list is possible), nor are these the most expensive or most distinctive coffees I drank.  I suspect that if I put these coffees in front of you to taste, many of you may not find them as captivating as I do.  I’m also currently in a stage where I don’t chase only coffees I think I’ll enjoy, but taste a much wider variety than that.  That means I’ll occasionally taste dark roasts or coffees with a lot of funk even though I predict with a high degree of accuracy that I won’t particularly like them.



I also want to thank everyone that traded or brewed coffees with me this year.  I couldn’t have tasted such a wide variety of coffees otherwise, and you may see coffees you shared with me on this list (for which I’m especially grateful!).  I share with a lot of folks off reddit, but on reddit in 2025, this includes u/PalandDrone u/Chi_CoffeeDogLover u/familark u/Acrobatic-Painting-9  and u/Maineic64 \- thank you, thank you!  I am grateful to each of you.  If I traded coffees with you and I didn’t thank you here, please remind and forgive me!  



I have put an \* next to countries from which I drank a particularly large number of different specialty coffees (>30) and a \^ next to countries from which I drank a particularly small number of specialty coffees (<3).  Two \^\^ marks indicate that it’s the only coffee from that country I drank all year.  Even if there’s a \^\^, I think it’s still notable that it’s on this list, as there are some countries I have drunk coffee from but were largely forgettable, and so not on this list.  



Where my favourite coffee was from the same farm as 2024, I note it with a #.  I also split both Colombia and Ethiopia (as well as decaf) into ‘traditional’ vs ‘modern’ processing styles, as they lead to such different cup profiles.  In addition, while I do drink a lot of coffee, I don’t drink coffees from every single producing country each year, so don’t read too much into any absences.  For example, specialty coffee from Yemen is famous for its high quality, but I have never tried any coffee from there.  Roaster and roaster's country are listed in parentheses.  If you're interested in more details, I include links to my original reddit reviews of the coffees or the roaster's website.



At the end, I’ll add a bonus section about some of the best in-cafe coffees I had this year, some fun new coffee experiences and my most memorable coffees of 2026 so far.  I would love to hear your favourite coffees from each producing country as well (for example, last year, u/10ttp-9 posted their super interesting list of favorites as a comment)

1qj58ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/revengestories/comments/1qj58ya/i_lent_my_cousin_my_favorite_jacket_for_one_night/,"I lent my cousin my favorite jacket for ""one night"" and she tried to rebrand it as hers, so i let the stitching do the talking","



A few months ago my cousin (27F) asked to borrow my favorite jacket for a work event. It’s not designer, but it’s one of those pieces that looks expensive because it fits perfectly and it has history. I found it years ago, had the sleeves tailored, replaced the buttons, and i sew a tiny cloth label inside my nicer stuff because i’m forgetful and i’ve had clothes ""vanish"" at gatherings before. My cousin promised it would be one night, no food, no smoke, she’d hang it up, she’d drop it off the next day. You can probably guess where this is going. Next day: ""omg i forgot, i’ll bring it next week."" Next week: ""i’m out of town."" Then she started getting snippy, like i was annoying her by wanting my own thing back. Two weeks later i see a photo of her on social media wearing my jacket with a caption like ""new staple, obsessed"" and people in the comments asking where she got it. She replied ""vintage find"" with a little sparkle emoji. I texted her, polite at first, like hey that’s mine, please bring it back. She responded with ""lol it’s literally just a jacket"" and then tried the gaslight special: she said maybe we have similar ones, and anyway she doesn’t remember borrowing it, and i’m making drama over nothing. It made me feel kind of stupid because it’s a jacket, but also, it’s MY jacket and she was acting like i was crazy for noticing.



So i stopped arguing. I waited. My aunt hosted a small family get together a couple weeks later, not a big dinner, just coffee and desserts and people passing a baby around. My cousin showed up wearing the jacket again, like she was daring me. I did the sweetest voice i could manage and said, ""That looks really good on you, where did you end up getting it? I love that cut."" She smiled and said, loud enough for everyone to hear, ""Right? I scored it ages ago, i just never wore it."" Perfect. I walked over and said, ""No way, can i see the inside? I did a little repair on mine and i’m curious if it’s the same."" She got tense and tried to step back, but i lightly pinched the inner seam near the collar and flipped it open. There it was, my little cloth label, stitched in crooked the way i always do it: my first name and the year. I didn’t yank it or make a scene, i just turned to my aunt and said, calm as anything, ""Oh good, it IS mine. I’m so relieved, i thought i lost it."" The room went quiet in that very specific way family rooms go quiet. My cousin’s face went red, then she laughed too hard and said i was embarrassing her. I said, ""You embarrassed yourself when you decided keeping it was easier than returning it."" Then i took it off her chair, put it on, and went back to the kitchen like it was the most normal thing in the world. She tried to follow me and whisper fight, but my aunt cut her off and asked why she’d lie about something so small. Cousin left early, slammed the door, and later texted me that i’m petty and vindictive and i ""care more about stuff than family."" I told her i care about basic respect. The best part is she can’t even spin it online now, because if anyone asks about that ""vintage find"" she has to remember it had my name sewn into it the whole time.

Got a theme and idea which i am trying to expand on. Sharing a first chapter to garner thoughts

Chapter One — The Spark

We become what we pretend to be — and sometimes the mask outlives the person.

The history group meets in a small community centre tucked between a chemist and a takeaway that changes name more often than people change their socks. Chairs scrape as folk settle in, papers rustle, the smell of old carpet mingles with instant coffee.

I spot Lorna before she sees me. She’s already talking to someone I don’t recognise, gesturing with her hands, laughing in a way that makes the room seem warmer than it is. When she notices me, she waves slightly, her eyes curious.

The meeting begins. Old maps are unfurled. Photographs of streets that no longer exist. Someone points to a tenement demolished decades ago. Another person mentions a family that disappeared between censuses.

“This is the unrecorded stuff,” Lorna whispers when no one’s listening, leaning closer. “The things people forget to remember.”

I nod, more out of habit than understanding. She notices things — gaps in memory, small contradictions — and keeps mental notes. That’s why she’s the one people come to with questions no one else remembers to ask.

After the meeting, we take our usual walk. The streets are quiet, the evening light thinning, the air crisp.

“You still up for a coffee?” she asks.

I hesitate. “Aye. Let’s go.”

The conversation drifts — work, weather, potholes, the roundabout that’s been broken longer than most marriages. Then, inevitably, the group comes up.

“I was looking into one of the names from last week,” Lorna says casually. “Just out of curiosity.”

“Find anything?”

“Not much. That’s the thing.” She frowns slightly. A crease appears between her brows. “Online, they’re everywhere — forum posts, comments, tagged photos. But in the official records? Nothing solid for years.”

I feel a small, familiar itch at the back of my mind. One that says pay attention.

“Maybe they moved,” I suggest.

“Maybe,” she says. She glances at me. “You don’t sound convinced.”

“I just… sometimes things look complete because we’re used to seeing them that way. Doesn’t mean they are.”

She nods, scrunching her nose a little, annoyed at how interesting this is turning out to be.

We part ways, the streetlights flickering on, and I walk home with the thought lodged quietly in my mind: patterns exist, even when they shouldn’t.",2,1769018670.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

1qj5607,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1qj5607/aita_for_sending_proof_of_my_husbands_2year/,AITA for sending proof of my husband's 2-year affair with his subordinate to HR and her husband after he expensed hotel rooms as 'client entertainment'?,"I found the hotel receipt in his jacket pocket while looking for his car keys, and it was dated for last Tuesday when he told me he was working late on the Henderson project.

The receipt showed two room service orders. Two breakfasts. I stood there in our bedroom holding this piece of paper and my hands started shaking because my husband doesn't eat breakfast, he's never eaten breakfast in the eight years I've known him, he drinks black coffee and that's it until noon.

I didn't confront him right away. I know that sounds crazy but I needed to be sure. So I started looking. Really looking. And once you start finding things you can't stop. Three more hotel receipts over six months, all charged to his corporate card. Dinner reservations for two at restaurants he'd never taken me to. And then I found her name.

Sarah from his office. The coworker he'd mentioned maybe five times total, always casual, always ""just helping with a client presentation"" or ""just grabbed lunch with the team."" I went through his phone while he was in the shower and there were deleted message threads but he hadn't cleared his cloud backup. Hundreds of messages going back two years. Two entire years of ""can't wait to see you"" and ""my wife doesn't understand me like you do"" and ""leaving her is complicated.""

That last one made me laugh out loud. Complicated. We had a prenup his family insisted on, no kids, I had my own career. The only complicated thing was that he didn't want to lose his image as the faithful family man.

I took screenshots of everything. Every message, every receipt, every deleted photo. Then I did something maybe I shouldn't have done but I don't regret it.

I found her husband on Facebook. Took me ten minutes. She'd posted about their anniversary six months ago, all smiles and hearts and ""blessed to have this man."" I sent him everything. Every screenshot, every receipt, every message where his wife told my husband she loved him.

Then I sent it all to my husband's HR department because those hotel rooms were expensed as ""client entertainment"" and Sarah was his direct report. Turns out the company takes that seriously. Immediate suspension pending investigation.

He came home that night and I had already called a locksmith. I handed him a suitcase I'd packed with his clothes and told him to get out.

He started crying. Actual tears. Said it wasn't what it looked like, that Sarah had pursued him, that he was trying to end it, that he'd made a mistake. I asked him which mistake specifically because there were two years worth of mistakes in my screenshots.

""You ruined my life,"" he said. ""You sent that to her husband? You sent it to HR? Do you know what you've done?""

I told him I knew exactly what I'd done and that he could stay at one of his favorite hotels since he knew them so well.

Sarah's husband called me two days later. We met for coffee and compared notes. Turns out she'd told him the same lies, that she was working late, that my husband was ""just a friend,"" that the texts he'd seen were taken out of context. He was filing for divorce. He thanked me for telling him the truth.

My husband lost his job. The investigation found multiple policy violations, misuse of company funds, inappropriate relationship with a subordinate. His entire department knew within a week. Sarah got fired too.

He tried to come back, showed up at the house crying about how he'd lost everything, how his parents were ashamed, how his friends weren't returning his calls. I reminded him that we had a prenup and this house was mine before we got married. I told him he could speak to my lawyer.

Sarah's husband told me she'd moved back in with her parents in another state. My husband is living with his brother and working some sales job making half what he used to make. Last I heard they're not even together anymore, the affair fell apart the second it wasn't secret and exciting.

I got the house, my career, my self-respect. He got exactly what he deserved.

But now my mother keeps calling saying I went too far, that sending everything to his work was vindictive, that I destroyed his career over a personal matter. His brother sent me a long message about how I'm bitter and cruel and how affairs happen but people can change. Even my best friend said maybe I should have just divorced him quietly instead of ""nuking his entire life.""

AITA for making sure he faced real consequences?

**Why This Pick?**

The Ducks have lost their last 5 straight meetings with the Colorado Avalanche, and the last 3 meetings have been losses by at least 2 goals. While the Avs have had a couple of tough games at home this past week, they’re still playing elite hockey. Anaheim is just out gunned in every category of this match up; I’ve gotta take the home team to cover the PL.

I’ve been thinking about this for years and i still can’t wrap my head around it. I’m 33F, pretty average looking, not hideous, not model, just a normal human who sometimes has nice hair and sometimes looks like i fought a laundry basket and lost. I don’t dress up much day to day because i work from home and my brain is usually in survival mode. What keeps happening is this weird thing where certain men seem genuinely offended when i’m not performing ""attractive woman"" in front of them. Not neutral, not uninterested, like actually irritated. The clearest example is when i’m out running errands in sweats, hair in a claw clip, no makeup. I can feel the shift, like i’m suddenly invisible to the men who want to flirt, but also weirdly visible to the men who want to punish. I’ve had guys cut in front of me in line while maintaining eye contact, like daring me to say something. I’ve had a man bump my shoulder hard in a store aisle and then hiss ""watch it"" even though he walked into me. One time i was at a coffee shop waiting for my drink and a guy behind me muttered ""Jesus"" under his breath like he was disgusted, and i realized he was reacting to me not smiling at him when he was staring. Another time at a bar, i declined a man’s attempt to buy me a drink (politely, i said i was meeting a friend) and he looked me up and down and said, ""don’t worry, you’re not that special."" Sir i was literally trying to escape you.



And it’s not just strangers. On dating apps, if i don’t respond fast enough or if i say i’m not feeling it, the switch flips from flirty to mean in one message. It’s always some version of, ""i was doing you a favor anyway."" Like my attention is a charity they’re handing out and i should be grateful, and if i don’t accept it then i deserve punishment. What really messes with me is how deliberate it feels. They’re not just disappointed, they’re trying to re-establish a hierarchy, like i forgot my role. I keep catching myself doing the thing women do where we try to solve it by making ourselves smaller or nicer. I’ll smile at a man i don’t want to smile at because i don’t want him to get angry. I’ll soften my voice because i don’t want to be seen as ""rude."" I’ll dress up for a quick grocery run because i don’t want some random guy to decide today is the day he needs to teach me a lesson. It makes me feel insane that i’m even thinking like that.



Has anyone else noticed this? Like there’s a subset of men who are fine with women existing only if we are either attractive to them or acting sweet enough to be harmless. If you’re neither, you become a target. I’d love to believe it’s in my head, but it happens too often and it follows the same pattern. I don’t need a grand theory, i just want to know how you deal with it without turning your whole life into a constant ""please don’t yell at me"" performance.

I (28F) have been with my boyfriend (30M) for almost 3 years. He’s a good guy in a lot of ways, steady, kind to strangers, remembers my coffee order, the whole thing. He’s also very involved in his church. Not in a loud judgey way, more like it’s his social life and his comfort. I’m not religious. I grew up around it, had some bad experiences with shamey youth group stuff, and as an adult I’m basically ""you do you"" as long as nobody tries to recruit me. When we started dating I was clear: I respect your faith, but I’m not converting. He said it was fine. Over time though, little comments started popping up. Like, ""It would mean a lot if you came on Easter,"" or ""My mom keeps asking when you’ll be baptized."" I went to a few big events to be supportive and it was fine, awkward small talk, free cookies, lots of hugging. But in the last couple months he’s been pushing harder. He’s been talking about marriage, and I’m open to that, but he started framing it like a package deal with church. He said he wants his future kids raised in the faith, and he wants a wife who shares it. I told him I can agree on values, traditions, even attending sometimes, but i can’t promise belief i don’t have. He kept saying, ""You don’t have to believe right away, just start the process."" That alone made me feel weird, like belief is a checkbox you can grind for if you show up enough.



Last weekend he told me his pastor wanted to ""meet me"" because the pastor likes to get to know couples. He called it casual, like coffee and a handshake. I said ok, because meeting someone is not a big deal. We get there and it’s not coffee, it’s in the pastor’s office with my boyfriend’s parents sitting there, plus another older couple I’ve met once. Everyone is smiling like it’s a surprise party. The pastor starts talking about ""welcoming you into the family of faith"" and says my boyfriend told him I was ready to begin baptism classes soon. I swear my stomach dropped. I looked at my boyfriend and he wouldn’t meet my eyes. His mom started crying a little and said she’s been praying for this day. I said, very calmly, ""I think there’s been a misunderstanding. I’m not converting. I’m here because you said it was just a meet and greet."" The room went silent in that thick way where you can hear the AC. The pastor did this gentle voice thing and said, ""Sometimes the heart is hesitant but the spirit is willing."" That line made me feel like i was being talked around, not talked to. My boyfriend finally said, ""Babe, you said you were open. I thought this would help."" I stood up, said i needed air, and walked out. In the car he was furious, said I humiliated him and made his family think I’m rejecting them. I said he put me in a corner on purpose. He claims he truly believed i would say yes once i felt ""supported."" Now he’s giving me the cold shoulder and texting that i ""broke his trust."" AITJ for leaving and not just smiling through it? TL;DR: boyfriend told his church and family i was ready to convert, surprised me with a meeting, i walked out.

1qj4tse,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1qj4tse/symptoms_question_and_caffeine_theory_21m/,Symptoms Question and Caffeine Theory! 21M,"Hello,

Background: you could skip this part, probably

Essentially I have been suffering from IBS since I was about 13 years old. I have gone through various phases of it. When I was first diagnosed, I got an upset stomach (not necessarily diarrhea) from eating generally unhealthy stuff. Greasy foods, fried foods, etc. I felt like a lost cause until I got diagnosed and formed a routine. I just also mention that I would really get triggered by anything more than just (rice and simply seasoned chicken for example). When I was a freshman in high school, I got really sick one day (too this day I had no idea how, I was eating on the safer side and it caught me by surprise). Ever since that day I felt like I never fully vacated when I went to the bathroom. Even after that, I formed a routine and went regularly once or twice a day. Mainly avoided comparatively unhealthy and bitter, greasy foods. Not much spice either. Besides the unsatisfactory bathroom trips, unless I ate something like fast food or fried or buttery, oily I was fine. I thought my stomach was still generally just more sensitive than the average person. I understand some of these would be triggers for “regular people” but I mention these foods because what would cause a bad bathroom trip for one person, a lesser amount of it would knock me out for way longer. Then now: in college I got really sick early on. It felt like no matter what I ate I was sick, would take long in the bathroom, feel bloated, etc. There was one instance where I got sick with watery diarrhea non stop completely out of nowhere. I ended up going to the doctor and that was rare for me because doctors always just said “take probiotics and drink water”. That’s how concerning it  it was. While it was regularly bad it was never that bad that suddenly and out of nowhere. Ever since then I’ve had more bloating and constipation than anything. I feel like everytime I have a huge flare/sickness it changes my stomach completely.

My biggest issue now it that I am significantly bloated now, constantly gassy but it’s a mix of needing to use the bathroom so I can’t just rip one. It feels like generally I feel that was and not truly unloaded no matter what I eat. I always feel uncomfortable and find random light stains in my underwear at the end of the day. My biggest issue is this: I don’t have regular bowel movements anymore. With the other issues I knew I would still have daily bowel movements and once I got through the the rest of my day was usually fine. Now I am concerned  because I don’t use the bathroom everyday anymore. If I don’t go in a day or 2, the next time I go I spend too long in the bathroom and my stomach really hurts. I would still go almost every day but would get majorly sick once or twice a week. It became normal. Does anybody have those symptom? When you go multiple days in a row you are generally feeling better but your stomach can’t handle not going so when it ends up skipping a day you get really sick? Like your body only ends up actually pooping to make space for food you just ate? I recently moved to another state for a top internship and I am scared. My first week in town I didn’t barely used the bathroom and did not properly use it until my first full day at the office. I spent hours and hours in the bathroom. That was on a Tuesday, this last weekend I used the bathroom mildly Saturday and Monday but only after drinking an energy coffee drink. This is how I developed my caffeine theory: The only other times I’ve gone close to a week without pooping have been whe I’ve been home on break with little caffeine. I have abused energy drinks daily in college that I considered that my regular bowel movement. Now that I have been here, I have barely used energy drinks and noticed that the only times I’ve pooped (outside of those long stretches of not pooping leading to those painful days of my stomach making space) were when I and a Starbucks energy shot drink. Is it possible that my stomach is now just struggling to poop without caffeine. During the winter break as well I only Pooped once or twice a week and felt miserable when I did (no matter what I ate). Is this worth mentioning to a doctor. I mean I had IBS before but never struggled to poop. I went from being scared to poop to now praying I poop that morning. One time I even went 8 days without pooping! Did I build a dependency? I am really fearful this will get in the way of work as now I already wasted half a day of training in the bathroom. Another reason I developed this theory because it happened during break and bloating got worse, I thought once I got in the work routine I would feel better, but I didn’t at all. I feel just as bad even though all day I’m out and about.

Should I see a specialist? Even lemon pineapple ginger tea stopped working for me. I am really worried because I am in training now but when work is actually expected of me I don’t want to be stuck in the bathroom half the time. I was sick weekly in my last summer internship but they were much more relaxed about hybrid scheduling and it was not as big of a company. This is a more advanced job. Additionally, it just feels miserable that I can’t plan my days because I don’t know if my body will even poop, especially because j know that when jt does ill be stuck that whole day. Also as the days go along I feel myself physically being able to eat less and getting full faster.

1qj4tbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Entire_Account_4697/comments/1qj4tbk/boundries_reconciliation_and_fairness/,"Boundries, reconciliation and fairness.","I will try to be brief.  This is an alt account because my partner and I used to read this subreddit together, and sometimes discuss posts.  

 I am a woman in my mid fifties and matched with Apple (male, also mid fifties) two years ago.  We used to chat a bit but never ended up meeting, and basically our communication stopped after about four months. 

The very same week I also matched with Banana.(NB late 40s.)  We met within days.  Banana and I quickly fell into a serious relationship.  It was very good but there were problems.  I was not used to being in a serious relationship with someone who was poly Most of my poly experience has been ethical non monogamy and very little actual ongoing situations with multiple partners on a regular basis. I was very busy with work and family obligations, and less time to date or even try much. I do have one satellite partner I see a few times a year  Banana also has autistic traits (no diagnosis) which made communication challenging.

 Banana likes to pursue many relationships at a time.  There would be people they were chatting with, usually one or two other people they were seeing more as an fwb situation, and me. I was constantly watching Banana get caught up on NRE and not handling or well. But also I am much better at ""reading"" people.  I often would get a sense of a new partner and their intent long before Banana would.  I would be torn between wanting to warn them about possible problems but often came across as ""jealous."". Sometimes I was.  Also Banana cares much less about age differences and was dating people many years junior.  Some of Bananas partners were as much as twenty years younger than me..  No matter how much reassurance, watching Banana get caught up in NRE with a 30 year old was both hurtful and exhausting  

Various conflicts in schedules, communication, and just relationship needs made us have a very rough spring last year and a break up in the summer. 

I really haven't dated in the mean time, focusing on other parts of my life.  Banana continues to date without caution and get their feelings hurt 

Over Christmas Banana and I have discussed reconciling. I asked if we could put a pause on pursuit  of new partners while we attempted to navigate getting back together.  Banana agreed.  We did not set a time limit on this (bad practice I know). It is starting to work. There are decisions and discussions to be made and we are very cautious about being fully forthcoming about everything. awe are relaxing in each other's company and better able  to talk about concerns without it becomi g a major crisis. We have been open about who is in our lives. I am relieved not having the ups and downs of Bananas new partners becoming a topic all the time. 

A few days ago I organically bumped into Apple out on public.  Apple recognized me but I did not recognize him.  I had never blocked Apple so after the meeting he texted.  we still had a lot of things to talk about.   We are discussing getting coffee on the weekend.  Apple and I have several mutual friends, and similar interests. There is a bit of flirting but I said before we get carried away let's actually meet. 

Anyway the ""no one new"" framework is still in place with Banana. Technically Apple is neither a new partner or even a partner yet.  Meeting in public though feels like a date and that gives me pause.  But it could be nothing.   

So good people of Reddit, does this upcoming coffee and chat with Apple violate the new agreement? I think the fact I am asking means it merits a discussion with Banana. I do want to continue with Banana but if  meeting with Apple  constitutes  pursuit of someone new then I have to accept that Banana is free to recommence active dating again. too.

Yes I want  to have my cake and eat it too, but no, I will not sneak or lie or use loopholes to avoid telling Banana what is going on...The question is what and when do I tell him. Things are going well right now. 

Any/all advice is welcome.

I’m new to this dept, but have 27 years on the job. I recently picked up OT at another station, with a crew I don’t normally work with.

The senior medic on this crew is a 30/F. I came in on day 2 (we work 48/96) and when everyone started getting up and around for the morning, senior medic came out of her room wearing volleyball-style booty-shorts. She got a cup of coffee, hung out for about 20 minutes shooting the shit, then went back in her room and put on some (less revealing) basketball shorts, before coming back out to drink another cup of coffee around the breakfast table. 

She’s young, attractive, and fit. 

Not gonna say I wasn’t looking, but I’ve been around long enough to know better than to dip my pen in company ink. Not even going there. Everyone knows that she’s single and has 2 baby daddys, and is presumptively looking for a third.  

Some borderline inappropriate conversation at the dinner table that night, but that’s to be expected in the firehouse…  IYKYK. The Batt Chief sat at the far end of the 14-person dinner table, presumably so he can claim plausible deniability (BC is a solid dude, I like him)

But IMO, a girl walking around in booty shorts in a firehouse full of guys is a walking HR nightmare waiting to happen…. she’s at the top of the list for a promotion, which IMO would be a FUCKING DISASTER based only partially on this.

1qj4sr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/massparty/comments/1qj4sr0/hi_introducing_myself_and_looking_for_open/,"Hi, introducing myself and looking for open dialogue","Good day,

In return for creating this space, I just wanted to invite moderators and contributors here to r/AssembleUSA and to cross-post so long as your actions remain relevant to your mission statement. 

I'm on the east coast, by the way. And I have a discord server to enjoy virtual meetups. I'm happy to go for a coffee too, or take on a pen pal.

Within months after the inauguration, I started my subreddit with the aim to promote the people's voice, to encourage discussion of current events, local policy, and the first steps people take toward activism. Due to time limitations, I now simply re-post a variety of relevant news. But my long-term intent is similar to this space, to re-orient politics so that a bottom-up culture is normalized, that commoner voices are uplifted, and that The People recognize their own institution, dormant though it may be. We constitute a hard and definite ""we."" Our institution was here for the revolution and the inclusion of the Bill of Rights in the constitution. The People are not represented by a non-profit, or an income bracket. The People simply are, embedded with the powers of the earth and the light of heaven.   
  
We have not being practicing democracy at an appropriate scale, and it shows in the tax system, education system, it shows in the housing crisis and in environmental decline. It shows in the form of the oppressed working class the world over. ""Right v. Left"" is literal divide and conquer. The parties make money off rivalry and perpetuate the rivalry to make more money. There's literal markets betting on political outcomes. The People, squeezed of all they have like blood from a rock, are expected to have little patience for complex problems. And so organizers must arise and break things down and assist our communities in maintaining our liberty. It's tough, but maybe less so if we continue to know each other and link our talents and causes consciously.  
  
Ideally, I wish to promote local assembly (groups of 3-10 people, organized by state assembly districts), civilian led electoral workgroups, all of which produce a chain of written statements across the country that would be compiled into a the concentrated terms of renegotiation for consent with our government. I call this event ""The People's Congress."" 

It will require a lengthy season of an infinite amount of debates across every county, and the drive to consensus must be absolute. In mass unity, there is power. And coercion is not acceptable. Many agreements will take time, time spent jointly invested in volunteering, gaming, breaking bread, building community and mutual aid to withstand the economic decline to come from this disastrous administration. But I believe empathy will drive a mutual truth to the surface, along with elegant language needed for The People to unite and unrig the system, perhaps even reforge it. The fight is against hunger and greed. That means we have to focus on basic needs and the nurturing of community that is the only balm to heal consumerism. Like the root network of a great tree, we must restore the understanding of a shared human dignity and a shared human fate on this planet. Individualism and collectivism are two sides of the same coin. One can't ""defeat"" the other, and one side of America can't leave the other side behind. We progress together or we sink together. Every mind and heart is worth the effort.

# Claude Co-Work AI Agent: The Next Step Beyond Chatbots

The **Claude Co-Work AI Agent** isn’t just another chat interface.

It’s a *co-worker*.

Think of it like this:  
Regular Claude answers your questions.  
Claude Code helps you write software.  
But **Claude Co-Work** actually *does the work* for you.

This thing plans, executes, and finishes tasks — without you micromanaging it.

You tell it what outcome you want, and it figures out the rest.  
It makes a plan, executes the plan, and gives you real results — not drafts.

That’s the future of AI agents.  
And it’s already here.



# How the Claude Co-Work AI Agent Works

The Claude Co-Work AI Agent runs inside **Claude Desktop for Mac**.

You give it access to a specific folder — not your whole computer, just one folder you choose.

Then you tell it what to do.

It looks at what’s in that folder, creates a plan, breaks it into steps, and starts working automatically.

While it’s running, you can watch it work or literally close your laptop.

When you come back, it’s done.

No interruptions.  
No timeouts.  
Just finished work.

This is what makes it revolutionary — it brings *agency* to AI.

Instead of babysitting your assistant, you can actually let it work independently.



# 3 Real Examples of Claude Co-Work AI Agent in Action

Here’s where it gets crazy — real users are already saving hours with it.

# 1. File Organization Made Automatic

Your downloads folder is a mess.

Screenshots, PDFs, random docs — everywhere.

You point Claude Co-Work at the folder and say:  
“Organize this by type and date.”

It scans every file, understands what each one is, then creates organized folders automatically.

One user sorted over **300 files in minutes**.  
That same job would’ve taken hours manually.



# 2. Expense Reports That Build Themselves

Got a folder full of receipt screenshots from your last trip?

Drop them in a folder and tell **Claude Co-Work AI Agent** to create an expense report.

It scans every image, extracts the date, merchant, and amount, and then builds a proper spreadsheet with working formulas and categories.

Not a broken CSV.  
An actual formatted Excel file.

People are turning hours of admin into minutes of automation.



# 3. Slide Decks Built from Scattered Notes

You’ve got random text files, meeting notes, and ideas scattered everywhere.

Ask **Claude Co-Work AI Agent** to “turn this into a presentation about our Q1 roadmap.”

It reads through everything, extracts the main ideas, and builds a professional slide deck.

If you have your brand assets in that folder, it even uses your company colors and layout automatically.

You can say “make it more visual” or “simplify the tone” — and it updates the entire deck in seconds.



# Why Claude Co-Work AI Agent Is Different

This isn’t a simple prompt runner.

Claude Co-Work uses what Anthropic calls **sub-agent architecture**.

That means it can handle multiple parts of a task *in parallel* — not one by one.

You ask it to analyze five reports, and it works on all five simultaneously.

That’s why something that used to take two hours now finishes in fifteen minutes.

It’s AI multitasking at a level we haven’t seen before — and it’s only getting smarter with every update.



# Power Tips for Using Claude Co-Work AI Agent

If you’re serious about using this tool for real productivity, here’s what power users recommend:

* **Use a plan file.** Create a “plan.md” file in your workspace. Claude checks tasks off as it works — perfect for tracking long jobs.
* **Always use version control.** Especially when working with code or documents. You can undo or review anything it changes.
* **Be specific.** Clear instructions = 90% success rate. Vague prompts = confusion.
* **Start small.** Test it on folders you can easily review before you let it handle big projects.

The Claude Co-Work AI Agent is like a super-capable intern — fast, helpful, and occasionally wrong.

You guide it once, then let it run.



# What Claude Co-Work AI Agent Can Connect To

Claude Co-Work can extend its reach using **Claude Skills** — prebuilt templates that improve how it writes documents or builds presentations.

It can also use the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to connect with other tools.

That means it can pull data from apps, browse the web, and integrate with Chrome to gather live information.

Imagine this:  
You ask it to compare product prices, check website updates, or analyze recent blog content — and it handles the entire process automatically.

That’s real AI-assisted work.



# The Risks You Need to Know

With great power comes great risk.

In December 2025, a user gave Claude Code full access to their entire home directory — and it deleted everything.

Co-Work is safer because it’s folder-specific, but the same principle applies.

Only give it access to **project folders**, never your entire system.

Always back up important files or use Git version control.

The **Claude Co-Work AI Agent** is powerful, but it’s only as safe as the boundaries you set.



# Who the Claude Co-Work AI Agent Is For

If you:

* Drown in file management tasks
* Spend hours creating reports or slides
* Manage local data and offline assets
* Run a small team or solo business

Then this tool will change your workflow completely.

But if your work lives mostly in cloud apps like Notion, Airtable, or ClickUp — you might not feel the full power yet.

And if you’re not on Mac? You’ll need to wait for the Windows version (coming soon).



# How to Get Started with Claude Co-Work AI Agent

Try this:

For the next week, spend **10 minutes a day** using it for one real task from your workflow.

Day 1: Organize your downloads folder.  
Day 2: Turn receipts into a spreadsheet.  
Day 3: Create a quick presentation from notes.

Each day, watch how it works.

By the end of the week, you’ll know exactly how to integrate it into your routine — and which tasks it handles best.

Start simple, then scale up.



# Claude Co-Work AI Agent: The Future of Work Is Here

Here’s the real story.

We’re moving from AI that *talks* to AI that *works*.

From chatbots that answer questions to agents that complete tasks.

Anthropic built the entire Co-Work system in just **10 days** using its own Claude Code model.

They’re improving it weekly based on user feedback.

This isn’t the future — it’s the new normal.

The people who learn how to use **Claude Co-Work AI Agent** today will have a massive advantage in the next 12 months.

They never mention that the f\*-boy just happens to be 6’2”.  His tall height is only brought up when she is bragging about it.  Ever notice that?

Nevertheless, these women are deemed victims of a modern dating culture.  They blame all men (or the “pussification” of men) for this situation.

Meanwhile, many average height men (in particular) are saying they can’t even get a coffee date, much less have a chance at a relationship.

The response?  ***“just work on your personality and stop playing the victim.”***

Why?  Because society validates their pain, and because her instagram looks better with a tall guy on it.

1qj4n0n,https://i.redd.it/pojxeuzeoqeg1.png,The Hidden Costs Of Ignoring Local SEO And How To Fix Them,"In today’s digital age, search engines, notably Google, are the first point of contact for consumers seeking local businesses. Whether it's a coffee shop, law firm, or online service, customers turn to search engines to find nearby businesses. If your company isn’t optimized for local SEO, you're missing out on potential customers actively searching for services in your area.

The costs of neglecting local SEO go beyond just lost business. It leads to wasted advertising spend, diminished online visibility, and missed opportunities to engage with nearby customers. Optimizing for local SEO is crucial to ensure your business appears in local search results, increases traffic, and boosts revenue. This article will dive into the importance of local SEO, the risks of ignoring it, and how to implement effective strategies to attract more customers in your vicinity.

# What Is Local SEO & Why Is It Important?

Local SEO optimizes your online presence to attract more business from relevant local searches. Companies can improve their visibility and attract potential customers nearby by focusing on location-specific keywords and leveraging local platforms. Here are the main components of local SEO:

* **Google My Business (GMB) Optimization** \- Make your business stand out in local search results and Google Maps.
* **Local Keywords** \- Using location-based keywords to attract customers from your area.
* **Citations and Listings** \- Maintaining accurate business information on local directories like Yelp, BBB, and Facebook.
* **Reviews and Ratings** \- Collecting positive customer reviews boosts trust and ranking.

Local SEO is crucial because [**46% of all Google searches**](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/local-seo-stats) have local intent, and **88% of consumers** who perform a local search on their smartphones visit or call a business within 24 hours. Without local SEO optimization, you’re essentially losing out to competitors taking advantage of it.

# The Hidden Costs Of Ignoring Local SEO

# 1. Lost Revenue From Local Customers

Local SEO is significant in driving revenue, as local searches often result in immediate business. Without proper optimization, you're missing a critical stream of high-grossing revenue from customers seeking services near you. For instance, a potential customer searching for “best daycare website design company near me” may never come across your business if you're not visible in local search results. Instead, they will turn to competitors who appear in the results, leading to missed opportunities.

**To prevent this:**

* [**Optimize your Google My Business (GMB)**](https://support.google.com/business/answer/7091) listing.
* **Use local keywords** across your website content.
* **Ensure consistent contact details** across all listings.

The lack of local SEO also means your business won't be visible in search results when potential customers search for nearby services. Local customers increasingly rely on smartphones to search for companies in their area. You’re losing out on website visits and potential conversions without appearing in local searches. Your competitors are likely benefiting from local SEO, making it critical to implement optimization strategies to capture local customers before they go elsewhere.

**To fix this:**

* **Implement local SEO practices** to improve rankings.
* **Maintain accurate business information** across all platforms.
* **Utilize structured data** to improve visibility in local searches.

# 2. Lower Rankings in Google Searches.

Without proper local SEO, your business will suffer lower rankings in Google search results, which reduces visibility and the likelihood of attracting potential customers. Google prioritizes firms with a strong local presence, such as those with an optimized Google My Business (GMB) listing, positive customer reviews, and consistent Name, Address, and Phone (NAP) data. If your business lacks these elements, search engines will rank you lower, meaning fewer people will see your website or engage with your services.

**To fix this:**

* **Regularly update your GMB profile** with fresh posts and photos.
* **Encourage positive customer reviews** to boost your credibility.
* **Create local citations** on sites like Yelp, BBB, and others to strengthen your online presence.

# 3. Wasted Advertising Costs

Spending money on paid ads without optimizing your local SEO can lead to unnecessary overspending and suboptimal results. Paid ads, especially Google Ads, are often a significant portion of a marketing budget. Still, they can fail to deliver sustainable traffic without a strong organic local search presence. Without a comprehensive local SEO strategy, businesses will spend more on ads to maintain visibility while receiving fewer free, organic leads from search engines.

**To avoid wasting your budget:**

* **Balance paid ads with organic SEO efforts** to improve your return on investment.
* **Optimize local keywords** in your ads to target high-intent local consumers.
* **Monitor ad performance** and adjust campaigns to align with local SEO improvements.

# 4. Fewer Website Visits and Conversions

A lack of local SEO optimization directly impacts the number of website visits and conversions. Without being properly optimized for local search, your business will remain invisible to users specifically looking for services in their area. Research shows that [**78% of mobile local searches lead to an offline purchase**](https://www.webfx.com/local-seo/statistics/), and [**50% of ""near me"" searches result in physical store visits**](https://www.buzzboard.ai/how-local-seo-attracts-local-customers-for-your-clients/). If your business is not ranking well in these local searches, you miss out on valuable opportunities to drive online and foot traffic.

**To fix this:**

* **Enhance your website's local keyword strategy** to target location-based searches (e.g., ""WooCommerce development in Miami"").
* **Optimize your Google My Business listing** with engaging descriptions, photos, and correct business hours.
* **Ensure your site has clear calls to action (CTAs)** that encourage local traffic to take action, such as calling your business or visiting your store.

# 5. Poor Online Reputation

Reviews are a key factor in local SEO, and an absence of reviews or worse, a collection of negative reviews, can significantly harm your business’s reputation. When determining search rankings, Google factors in the' number, quality, and recency of customer reviews. A company with a poor online reputation can scare potential customers away, especially if reviews are unanswered or unresolved. In today's competitive market, customers often rely on online reviews to make informed decisions, so neglecting your online reputation can cost you customers and hurt your credibility.

**To fix this:**

* **Encourage satisfied customers** to leave reviews on Google.
* **Respond promptly to all reviews**, whether positive or negative, to show engagement.
* **Address negative reviews politely**, offering solutions to demonstrate professionalism and a commitment to customer satisfaction.

# 6. Lost Mobile Traffic

Mobile traffic is a significant portion of local search, with over [60% of all searches done on smartphones](https://www.thewebmaster.com/what-percentage-of-search-are-mobile/). Many of these searches are “near me” queries, such as ""best WooCommerce experts near me"" or ""top-rated WordPress hosting services in my area."" If your business isn’t optimized for local SEO, it won’t appear in these searches, even if potential customers are nearby. Missing out on this traffic can directly impact your ability to attract local customers and drive conversions.

**To fix this:**

* **Ensure your website is mobile-friendly** and optimized for speed.
* **Implement structured data** to mark up your business information.
* **Focus on voice search optimization** by incorporating conversational keywords like ""top WooCommerce developers near me.""

A standard project requires six Zoom meetings over a three week period.  Every so often, someone cancels a meeting at the last minute.  I plan my schedule around my meetings so this means I will have given up coffee with a friend or not taken a day trip with my wife and it makes me very angry.

I tell the organizations I expect 24 hours notice but I would love to do something that passes along a bit of bite.  I am thinking of requiring they make a $50 donation to a charity of my choice if they pull this. Currently, I tell them I expect 24 hours notice as part of the set up but I would expand our agreement to include this provision.  I am probably just angry and I am looking for some rational feedback.

**Update: It has been suggested that I limit the donation of my time to six meetings and not allow makeup meetings if this happens.  That may be the best solution.** ",7,1769017327.0,nonprofit,16,0.82,False

1qj4l2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1qj4l2f/tldr_terra_kaffe_demi_looks_great_coffee_is/,"TL;DR: Terra Kaffe Demi looks great, coffee is decent, but quality control and support killed it for me. Returning it.","Posting here because I couldn’t find a way to leave a review on the Terra Kaffe site and I feel like people should know.

I bought the Terra Kaffe Demi back in October. I was genuinely excited. The design and aesthetics are beautiful and that’s what sold me.

Build & design:

It’s all plastic. Not awful, but doesn’t feel premium for the price. The grounds bin is very small. For double-shot espresso, it fills up after about 3 cups and needs to be emptied constantly. The drip tray is long and awkward. If the machine isn’t right next to a sink, carrying it almost guarantees a spill. Also, the front plate is a different color than the bottom plate, which doesn’t match the product photos.

Usage:

Easy to use. Simple dial. No steam wand, which I personally didn’t care about. When it worked, the coffee actually tasted pretty decent.

What went wrong:

The first machine had a weird bar at the top of the display. Support couldn’t explain it and asked me to return the unit and sent a replacement.

The replacement was way worse. During cleaning or rinse cycles, water doesn’t come out of the proper outlet. It leaks from inside the machine and drips out the back onto my desk. I checked everything. Drip tray in place, water tank seated correctly, no error codes. The water is clearly leaking internally. I have video proof.

Support issues:

No phone support. I tried calling multiple times. No answer. Email support is responsive, but that’s the only option. After two defective machines in a row, I’m done.

Final thoughts:

I really wanted to love this machine. It looks great and the idea is solid, but the quality assurance and reliability just aren’t there. For longevity and peace of mind, I’d honestly recommend sticking with brands like DeLonghi that have decades of experience.

1qj4l14,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qj4l14/do_i_tell_her_i_like_her_or_hold_off/,Do I tell her I like her or hold off?,"Hey  r/dating_advice, 25M here. Been talking to this girl (23F) for about 5–6 months. I really like her and I’m trying to decide if I should just tell her how I feel or keep waiting for her to be ready. Looking for outside perspective because I’m starting to feel stuck in limbo.

Quick background: She was in a toxic relationship that ended right after Christmas. I never made a move or flirted while she was with the guy. Since the breakup (\~3–4 weeks single at the start), things have slowly escalated with me specifically (she’s vented to me about her ex and another pushy guy, but not others).

Key things she’s done (especially the recent hangs):

•  Coffee hang — We finally did coffee a few days ago. It lasted over 2 hours of straight yapping (inside jokes, faith talk, shared interests like Blink-182). She laughed a lot, thanked me after, apologized for “yapping” but said it was fun, and texted me later to say thanks again with smileys. Felt very mutual and easy.

•  Movie night at my place — Last night she came over to my apartment alone after work. No group, no mention of anyone else. She brought snacks she picked out. We watched a WWII movie (Nuremberg on Prime), yapped the whole time, stayed hours. She was comfortable, relaxed, and thanked me again after + prayed for her safe drive home. Ended with a warm goodnight text using my nickname + smileys. Felt intimate and good.

•  Dinner ask — When I walked her to her car after the movie, I asked if she’d want to get dinner sometime. She got a little awkward (“socially awkward, wasn’t expecting dinner”), but then said “I would be down lol” and “I’ll think of a date for after my Norway trip.” She didn’t shoot it down—she affirmed interest but set a timeline (after her upcoming trip).

Other green flags:

•  She initiates texts a lot (goodnights, memes like Elmo first thing in the morning, checking if I’m going to group events like game night or someones birthday dinner).

•  When I’m going to events, she says “okayyy same :)” and aligns her plans.

•  Unprompted future talk earlier: “when you come over” to paint, Michigan UP visit suggestion, Normandy trip in June.

•  Prioritized me: asked me first for help moving, dropped everything to pick me up after I hurt my ankle.

•  Multiple vents to me about her ex being awful and another guy being too pushy — she never vents that stuff to anyone else as far as I know.

She’s said multiple times she’s still healing and not looking for anything serious right now, but her actions keep escalating with me specifically (not with other guys).

My question:

Should I just tell her I like her / that I’m interested in dating her, or keep waiting for her to be ready / make the next move?

I don’t want to scare her off by moving too fast, but I also don’t want to stay in this “maybe friends, maybe more” limbo forever. She’s said yes to dinner but tied it to after her Norway trip—does that mean I should wait until then to say something, or is now the right time?",1,1769017265.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

You all have seen GoMining's latest announcement. There are images of what clearly seems to be a watch. The text at the end of the spot talks about an unnamed 'luxury brand'.

What do you think is coming?

Since GoMining is obviously about crypto, the most obvious assumption is that this is some sort of smart watch that you may somehow link to your GoMining account. Maybe even some device with which you may not only check your notifications and stuff, but also pay, like an electronic wallet.

As you may already know, there are general-purpose smartwatches that can run crypto price-tracking and wallet apps (especially Wear OS and Apple Watch apps like portfolio trackers, price alerts, NFT displays, etc.).

With apps and watch faces, you can track price feeds, portfolio performance, receive alerts, see NFT info, and integrate with your phone’s wallet apps. For example, Wear OS apps like Crypto Watch Face can show real-time prices right on the watch face.

There are also some non-typical mass-market smartwatches, but emerging blockchain wearables that *integrate crypto features* more deeply, like WatchX or similar.

Can you imagine paying for your coffee or whatever you like in GMT tokens just using your wrist watch, similar to contactless NFC wallets?

What are your assumptions about the new announcement?

How will the new smartwatch address security limitations to manage a wallet directly?

Will this spark a broader trend in the market?

I’m a local producer working on House, Organic House and Ambient tracks (think Bonobo, Keinemusik, Innervsions style). A lot more than that but hopefully that gives a flavour. 

I’m looking to connect with a few other aspiring producers in Dublin to form a small, consistent group. The idea would be to meet up maybe once or twice a month for a coffee or a pint to:

• Share what we’re working on.

• Trade feedback/tips on production and sound design.

• Keep each other motivated to finish tracks.

I’m open-minded regarding exact genres, if you make deep house, melodic techno, or electronica, that fits too. I'm just looking for good vibes and people who are serious about improving and connecting.

I’ve never been one to recall a single detail from my dreams, and yet here I am, remembering a whole dreamlike sequence from start to finish.
 
It always starts with me in third-person view, standing in my kitchen, surrounded by familiar faces. I watch in horror from the corner of the room as my other self picks up a kitchen knife and, one by one, mercilessly kills every single one of my friends. 

I’m sure some freak out there could tell me the exact meaning of this dream—and I sincerely hope it means I’m getting rich soon—but I can’t fathom the fact that I have to confess this to anyone.

Because, as chilling an action as it is to murder everyone you love, it does not compare to what happens next. Or rather, during it. It doesn’t matter whether the knife digs into their stomach or their throat; every victim is silent and cold. No fear in their eyes, no will to survive.

And the most bizarre part: they all look at me. Not the cold-blooded killer version of me that is ravaging through them, but the one watching everything from the corner of the room. I usually wake up before the fifth body drops, which is what happened that morning as well.

It was notably cold. My gaze met the alarm clock that was screaming at me from the corner of the nightstand. With wide-open eyes, I managed to read the time and date: seven o’clock, the fifth of January. I looked outside my window to see slight drops of rain. It never bothered me; I love the smell of wet dirt and humid air.

I got up and wiped the small pool of water that formed below the window overnight. I always sleep with it open. I feel safer that way. With light steps I made it to the bathroom. Leaning over the sink, I splashed some water on my face, although I never understood the use of it.

I began my morning routine; I brushed my teeth, I flossed, I applied some skincare products that apparently helped delay aging… I’m pretty weird, aren’t I? Worrying about withering away at the age of 25.

Finally, I looked at myself staring back at me in the mirror, hoping it doesn’t murder me. I practiced my smile. It had always bothered me since it looked crooked. It might have been me overthinking it, but it looked like a robot’s best attempt at being human. After a while, I gave up.

“My name is Helen Brown,” I told myself, putting on a friendly mask. From my understanding, it’s mandatory when you work in real estate.
“How can I help you?” I paused.
“No, too straightforward…” I told myself. “How can I be of use today? Yeah, much better.”

I was on my way to the kitchen when I heard it again. The knocking from the basement. Although it’s a one-story house, it has an underground room guarded by an old wooden door. The place is small and cramped, so I’ve been using the extra space to store random tools and the washing machine.

I live alone, so the house is usually quiet. That’s probably the only reason I could hear it. As it got louder and louder, I couldn’t help but get annoyed. If this continued, I’d have to deal with it. It might sound like I’m one of those horror movie protagonists that do everything but run away, but if you were in my shoes, you’d be annoyed too.

It was this really irritating knock, followed by the faint sound of chains. It had gotten more intense since the day before, which wasn’t a good sign. I tried to Google it, but I wasn’t quite sure what it I was supposed to be searching for. Every successful attempt at describing the problem in a short sentence was met with completely unrelated results. For example, a horror novel. What was I supposed to do with that?

It’s also worth noting that it got even louder when I went down there, much to my displeasure. I wasn’t particularly scared of it. It was just this weird thing that kept happening for whatever reason. A drop in a puddle.

I finally made it to the kitchen and prepared some coffee. I drank it plain since I don’t like the taste of sugar and grabbed the bottle of milk from the top of the fridge. Why do I have such a tall fridge? It’s really impractical for a short woman. Regardless, I poured some into my coffee and left the carton on the counter.

I mindlessly checked my phone. It was a quarter to eight, which meant I had about forty-five minutes until Jules was there to pick me up. She was my coworker—the only one who was my age. We’ve been hanging out for two years at that point, ever since we both realized that our other options at work were salivating old men and bitchy middle-aged women.

My thoughts are interrupted by a loud thud. It came from the familiar source of all sounds. I opened the fridge door and put my coffee mug inside. I then headed toward the basement door with determined steps. This could not keep happening. It gets to a point.
As I was about to open the door, my phone rang; “Armageddon” was the contact name.

“Hello…?” I answered.

“Helen, dear,” the voice replied from the other end. It was calm and sweet. I turned away from the basement door. I guess I’d deal with it another time. “How have you been?”

“Busy, I guess,” I replied as I headed towards the fridge to retrieve my coffee.

“Poor thing… Have you been eating properly?”

“Yeah,” I took a sip of the now chilly liquid.

“That’s great. Anyway, honey, I don’t want to sound like a whiny old lady, but I just got a bit worried. Your father told me not to call you because you’re probably busy, but he’s outside with Nathan fixing the Chevy, so I decided to be a little naughty.” She laughed at her own words.

“Work has been killing me lately, so Father is right.”

”’Father’ Looks like someone matured suddenly.” She let out a dry laugh, followed by the click of a lighter. There was an inhale, and then the sound of an object gently thrown on a wooden surface. “Anyway, dear, I won’t bother you any longer. I just got a bit worried since you always call us on the weekend, and this was the first one you missed in seven years.”

”I’m sorry. I’ve been running around a lot lately—I can’t catch a break. Today is the busiest Monday of the month. Hope you understand.” I reached for the kitchen counter and lit my own cigarette, the warmth of the smoke familiar to my lungs. I’ve gotten used to it sooner than I expected. Jules kept coughing for months after she picked it up.
 
“I do. Just… take care of yourself. I love you.”

”Love you too, mum.” I replied, hanging up.

I lightly tapped the cigarette, causing the ash to fall from grace, and after a few seconds it finally met the cold surface of the sink. 

My little smoking-in-the-dark session was interrupted by the doorbell. There’s a window next to the door, so I could see Jules grimacing at me through it. I smiled and walked towards her.

“We have, like, twenty minutes to spare, so I decided to intrude,” she joked as she entered the living room, making herself comfortable on the small white couch. She reached for the ashtray on the corner of the table.

Much to my annoyance, I had to go to the kitchen to retrieve my coffee for a second time. I know it seems minute, but unnecessary repetitions genuinely exasperate me. That small observation aside, I sat next to her on the couch.

She looked at me with her vibrant green eyes as the smoke traveled out her nostrils effortlessly. 

“I didn’t expect you to be up this early.”

“Me neither,” I joked. I put out my cigarette on the ashtray, one that’s frankly seen better days, and leaned back. I took a good look at Jules.

I’m not the jealous type. I’ve never felt an ounce of jealousy in my entire life. But I wish I looked like her. Her sharp jawline, the short black hair effortlessly framing her beautiful face, the piercing green eyes that looked right through you.

 Of course, one could argue that she had a killer body too, but that would be really superficial of me to admit. 

It wasn’t just her looks I adored. She was funny, talkative, social, and considerate… maybe too considerate at times, which could get overwhelming. I always found myself captivated by her. I wondered what she smelled like. I bet her skin was really soft and has the aroma of the vibrant pink flowers I used to see in the woods all the time. But then again, I had a boyfriend, so it was really weird to think of that stuff… I think.

“Can’t wait for that eight-hour shift at that shithole,” she exhaled. I recognized that feeling: annoyance, unease.

“Pays the bills, though.”

”Bitch, the bills will have to pay themselves if that fugly old raisin stares at my ass like that again. He doesn’t look at anything else. Like, let me do the work you hired me to do, jeez.”

Her complaints were fair. It was true that our boss was weird, in a predatory way. But I guess that was to be expected. He wouldn’t act on it, or at least he hadn’t done so yet. Good for him. Wouldn’t be so pretty if he did. It’d be a shame to throw my life away.

“Just put up with it,” I chuckled. “It’s not like we spend all day with him. Besides, won’t you be sent to that house at the port today?”

”Nope, that was last week,” she muttered, disappointed. “You better drink some more coffee, girl. Your memory is all fucked up.”

”Maybe some wine would be better,” I joked.

Jules smirked. “Now we’re talking.”

She got up and headed towards my kitchen. She seemed to know her way around; she even instinctively lowered her head while passing through the empty door frame. It was too low, for whatever reason. Short people like me never felt the fear of banging their heads, so that’s why I hadn’t really noticed it probably.  

She hastily filled two glasses with wine and came back, leaving them on the wooden coffee table. The amber liquid reflected whatever light managed to slip through the closed curtains. She took a sip and let out a relieved sigh.

“Speaking of wine, are you coming tonight?”

I stared at my glass for a moment. What was it again? Since there was wine involved, it was probably a party of some sort… or a social gathering?

“Yeah, why not?” I finally replied.
Jules looked at me, surprised.

“Wait, for real? You aren’t fucking with me, are you?”

”Nope, why would I?” I asked, taking a sip of wine. The taste was the same as it was the day before. It reminded me of juice for some reason. A spiked one at that.

“Bitch, I’ve been trying to convince you for ages. You sure, right?”

”Yeah!” I flashed a smile. She smiled back, her eyes shining with excitement. 

How pretty it was to witness life: the racing of the heart, the overwhelming warmth, the excited childish gaze… I sound like an old, dying woman, don’t I?

A few moments of silence passed, and she stood up.

“I’m gonna go to the bathroom and then we’re out.”

”Sure, take your time,” I reassured her.

She downed the wine in one sip and started heading away.

“Have you eaten, by the way?” She asked over her shoulder.

“Not hungry, you know me.”

”You have to work on that. Did you know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day?” Her voice kept getting lower and lower as she finally closed the bathroom door.

As expected, the knocking from the basement resumed. So I finally figured out the trigger: any type of outside noise. When Jules went past the old wooden door that led to it, it started again.

This wasn’t really optimal. If Jules heard it, what would I say? She wouldn’t dismiss it; her personality wouldn’t let her. Plus, she’d surely get anxious at first, then scared. She wasn’t exactly fond of horror, to the point where she’d get mortified by even the slightest sudden sound.

“Has the wine hit me, or are there sounds coming from the basement?” she asked, as if she read my mind. I didn’t realize she’d come back from the bathroom.

“Probably the washing machine...”

”That’s scary…” she admitted. 

I’ve been putting it off for the past four days. That was when the sounds first started.I guess, in a weird way, it made sense that they would amplify whenever I headed down to the basement, but what was the point of them even being made when I was outside the room? I’d have to deal with it. Not when Jules was there, obviously. When I got back from work that day.

“Anyway, the chicken sandwich from the cafeteria really messed my fucking stomach up,” she said suddenly, trying to dismiss her obvious unease.

“Nah, I’m fine. You just have a weak stomach,” I joked absentmindedly.

There was a silence. I finally looked behind my shoulder to face her. Her eyes were wide open, her expression that of a surprise. She looked like she’d seen a ghost. A really terrifying one. Did she realize? Did she know?

“Helen… did you eat the sandwich too?” she asked.

“Yeah? It’s just a sandwich…”

“Helen… aren't you vegan..?”

I stared at her for five long seconds.

“Well, new year, new me. I just couldn’t resist it anymore.”

Jules’ worry was replaced with a knowing smirk.

“I knew it! No sane person can be fucking vegan. Well, at least now I can take you to my favorite barbecue spots.”

I looked at her up and down. Such a beautiful woman. That was a slip-up on my end. I wouldn’t let it happen again. I couldn’t afford it. I was really, really glad she didn’t react the way I thought she would. I slowly stood up, adjusting my suit pants. I met her halfway, and we both headed for the door.

“By the way, Justin is coming too tonight… you aren’t mad at him still, right?” she asked as I searched for my keys.

“Nope,” I replied dryly.

“Good. I knew you’d forget about it. It’s a silly thing to get mad at. I mean, it’s his childhood friend. Besides, look at you. No need to get jealous; he’s smart enough to know you’re a hundred times sexier than that bitch. And, Helen, I mean this in the nicest way possible: I’m glad you’re overcoming your jealousy issues.”

As we were about to leave, the knocking got louder. In fact, it got so loud that the chains rattling against the cold wooden floor could be heard as well.

Jules looked at me, her eyes bloodshot. She closed the door and rushed towards the living room, hiding behind the couch. She then nodded at me to come over, whispering something I couldn’t quite hear. I locked the door and obeyed.

“Something is fucking down there,” she whispered.

I also hid behind the couch next to her. “Don’t be silly, Jules. I probably forgot something in a pocket, and it’s banging as the washing machine is spinning.”

“Cut the shit, Helen. You know this is not fucking normal. That’s not what a fucking washing machine sounds like.”
She took her phone out and tapped the call icon. “We should call the cops.”

“And what will we tell them? That there’s knocking on my basement? That two grown women are pissing themselves over what could be a rat that’s trapped in there?”

“I don’t fucking know,” she said, louder now. “Fuck this, I’m doing it.”

She began dialing 911. I grabbed her hand, which made her jump a bit.

“Alright. How about we check on it first, just to be sure.”

That was all I had left. A desperate attempt to deescalate the situation.

”Helen, why the fuck would we check it out!?” She practically yelled at me, which also made the knocking turn to loud banging. “Whatever is down there wants to fucking hurt us!”

That was another thing that irritated me about her. When she put her mind to something, she wouldn’t let it go. Why would this happen? Why wouldn’t she listen to me? Didn’t she realize what she was doing?

I grabbed her wrist, causing her to drop her phone on the couch. She looked at me, her eyes wide. I could feel her heart racing, her skin getting colder as panic rushed through every single fiber of her being. Even now, she looked like an angel.

She looked at my hand. There was a bit of warm blood where my nails pierced her pale skin. Tears started forming in her eyes. Her voice came out weak. Low cries mixed with it.

“Helen, don’t you…” she said and paused, as if she couldn’t stomach what she was seeing. “Don’t you have a birthmark on your hand? Where… where is it? This is a prank, right?”

There was a long silence after that. Her piercing green eyes never left mine. It felt as if every other sound stopped, and the only thing that existed was us two. She noticed me. She noticed me for who I am. I loved her. I loved her so… so much. I leaned closer and gently kissed her lips. She showed no resistance. I could feel her terrified gaze landing on my closed eyelids. I pulled back slowly.

“Why did you have to notice, Jules?” I ask, my voice soft. “Weren’t we doing just fine?”

“N… notice what, Helen?” she laughed awkwardly, though her voice came out tense.

“You know, don’t you?”

“K.. know what? Helen, please stop. This… this isn’t funny.”

“Why would I try to be funny, Jules?”

She let out a forced laugh. She began rubbing my hand with aggression.

“I’ll give you that, you made it look convincing. What foundation did you use to cover it?” her voice kept breaking.

I simply observed her, unable to understand what she was trying to accomplish.

“It’s a prank, right? Right, Helen? You.. you know I don’t like scary stuff. Is Justin making noises in the basement?”

She let out  an even more forced, high-pitched laugh. “That little bitch!”

The tears that hadn’t stopped revealed the truth we both knew.

“About the whole… kiss thing, we will discuss it on our way to work. Al… alright? Now let me go. Please.”

“You do realize I can’t do that, right?” I replied, confirming the worst case scenario she had probably made in her head. I tried my best to sound friendly.

She threw my hand away and rushed towards the door, almost tripping on the leg of the table. I let her go. I didn’t want to scare her even more. Besides, the door was locked, and I had the key.

She fought the doorknob like a child trying to break into a cabinet full of treats. She was, quite frankly, so adorable. I slowly stood on my feet and made my way toward her. She looked at me and back at the knob in rapid succession. After she realized there was no exit available, she sank down, her back glued to the door like a cornered animal. She looked up at me as if I were some monster. 

I grabbed her by the hair and dragged her to the kitchen. 

“Helen, what the fuck! Stop!” she screamed but it was no use. She knew. I couldn’t allow that.

I threw her; she hit the side of the marble counter hard. She let out a pained grunt as tears traversed her sharp cheeks like a wild river. It reminded me of the river in the woods where I used to pass the time. I grabbed the kitchen knife.

“Helen, what! What are you doing! Helen! It’s me, Jules!” she screamed, her desperation evident. She flailed like a fish on shore. I clamped my hand over her mouth and drove the knife into her stomach.

Her eyes widened. Her breathing quickened. I felt the blood exit as she coughed, staining my palm. I pulled my hand away since there was no way for her to scream anymore as the amber liquid flooded her mouth.

“It’s your fault that this happened. You could have ignored it, you know. We could have been so happy. Why would you do that, Jules? Why?”

All that came out of her mouth was gibberish as she choked on the liquid. Her breath smelled of that familiar, metallic aroma. I drove the knife into her stomach three more times. I watched as her eyes slowly lost their spark. I closed them and softly let her fall onto the marble floor.

I was so absorbed in my intimate moment with Jules that I had completely forgotten about the basement. The banging was as intense as ever, only drowned out when Jules’ phone rang in her pocket. I caressed her cheek one last time. Her skin truly was soft. The contact name was “Boss.”

I tried my best to recall Jules’ voice. Its friendliness mixed with a low, almost seductive tone. I coughed a bit as it helped me readjust my vocal cords.

“Hello?” I said, imitating her voice.

“Where are you?” the raspy voice of our boss asked from the other end. I could practically smell the oil on his hair through the phone.

“I’m not feeling so well. Do you mind if I don’t come to work today?”

The boss scoffed but gave in. “Yeah you… you sound a bit weird. Sore throat? Fine,” he said, and hung up.

I guess my impression wasn't perfect after all.

Obviously, he called me - Helen - as well, and I said the same thing. He let me stay at home; however, he clarified that I’d have to work on Saturday to make it up. No problem. I guess Jules was the only one getting special treatment.

I hung up and headed towards the basement door, dropping on all fours. The tips of my fingers landed lightly on the cold floor. At last. Walking on two legs was getting uncomfortable. 

The old wooden piece of wood creaked as I opened it. I counted the stairs as I went down head first. The chains rattled violently as I approached. Fear. That’s what it was. The reason for the amplification of the sound was human fear.

The blindfold on her eyes and the tape on her mouth were slightly displaced, and the chains had left marks on her wrists and ankles. As for the knocking, I thought she must have been banging her head against the wall behind her. All that effort… poor thing.

I removed her blindfold and the tape. There she was. Helen Brown. Staring back at me as if I were some monster.

“Who are you!? Why are you doing this!? What did you do to Jules!?” She began screaming at the top of her lungs. 

I noticed that her voice was a bit more high pitched than what I had adopted. I needed to work on that. At the same time, I wondered how Jules didn’t notice the faulty voice from the beginning. Or perhaps, she did. Didn’t really matter at that point.

I smiled. The same smile I had practiced for the past four days. It was unfortunate to see that it petrified her even more. I had spent so much time perfecting it. What a mean human being.

“My name is Helen Brown,” I told myself, putting on a friendly mask. From my understanding, it’s mandatory when you work in real estate.

I recently got accepted for an internship at the IAEA Seibersdorf laboratories. I’m honestly super stoked (and a little nervous) to get started.

My main goal is to leverage this 12 months into a real job within the UN system or the industry immediately after. I know the standard advice is always ""network, network, network,"" but as someone new to the UN environment, I want to move beyond the buzzwords and have a concrete game plan.

For those who have interned at the IAEA (or similar agencies) and managed to land a position afterward:

1. What kind of role did you actually land? Did you transition into a consultant contract, apply for a specific P-staff position, or find something else entirely?
2. How did you *specifically* maximize your time? ""Networking"" feels vague. Did you schedule coffee chats with people outside your immediate lab? Did you attend specific seminars at the VIC? I’m looking for actionable steps that go beyond just doing good work at my desk. and lab.
3. Are there any specific internal programs, mentorship initiatives, or cross-departmental projects I should ask my supervisor about joining? I want to show initiative without stepping on toes.

Any tips on navigating the Seibersdorf vs. VIC dynamic would also be appreciated!

Thanks in advance!",1,1769016426.0,UNpath,0,1.0,False

How to avoid people who do this?","I went on my first date on Saturday since a breakup in Sept. We’d chatted on and off while she was away for holidays, then met for coffee. She has a rule against dinner on first dates, which I liked. 

We talked for \~3 hours. The conversation felt lively and reciprocal, lots of jokes and good energy. There was a cute moment where she struggled to pour tea without spilling and I did it for her not missing a drop, which we laughed about. Near the end, she pointed out a flyer and said, “This seems like something we’d both enjoy.” Walking her to the metro, she complimented me on being both analytical and creative which she thought was rare.

It felt like a very natural, refreshing date with lots of green flags. I texted her that night saying I had a great time, no response. I followed up yesterday, briefly inviting her to the event she mentioned. Still nothing.

I’m accepting that I may never hear back, but it’s frustrating because I’m usually cautious and discerning about who I go on dates with for this exact reason.

Screaming Goat Coffee can be found at either of the Elixir Espresso Bar locations (PB, La Jolla). They are roasted in San Diego and currently sell for around $20 for a 12oz bag. They also have a decaf blend but their regular whole bean coffee might be my favorite bean in all of San Diego. 

This bean is a Medium to Medium-Dark roast and is very balanced. I mostly taste dark chocolate and nutty flavors. I have only brewed for espresso, so I cannot vouch for the taste with other brew methods. I find that their bags are always very freshly roasted and this is always apparent by the thick crema when pulling for espresso. I enjoy this as a straight espresso, flat white, or latte. I think I enjoy it so much due to the consistency and freshness that the roaster provides. It is my go to bean if I want a balanced drink that is easy to dial in.

**Two days later….**



Cat got into her car and used her GPS that would take her to the Falls. Her body felt hollow and she had the beginnings of a headache. The girl, Jenna Bannoch, came to her in her dreams the night before. She was lying in the morgue now as the police had found her body but she had begged Cat to help the police find her killer. She didn’t want to stay alone in the dark or not get justice for her death. She didn’t want the wrong man to take the blame for her murder. She had begged for Cat to help her as the wrong man would soon stand trial for her murder and she didn’t want that to happen.

As Cat settled down in her car and drove, she prayed for Jenna and for herself. She knew it would be a battle to find someone to believe her, but her dreams suggested there would be someone in Granite Falls who would. She didn’t know who, but he was there. She just had to find him.

As she turned onto the highway that would take her to her destination, she closed her eyes briefly and saw him again. The shadow of a tall man with red hair and a soft blue aura. His blue eyes were icy and the area around his eyes had a stern look, but the rest of his face was in the shadows. Her heart skipped a beat when she remembered the rest of her dream from the night before. She had been locked in an embrace…in strong arms and the man had these same eyes.

This had been an odd thing to see and she wondered if the embrace was for her or was it another vision? She shook the thought away as she had more important parts of her visions to track down.

**\~\*\*\*\*\~**

When she got to the city of Granite Falls, Cat felt at home, and the feeling left her a bit uneasy. As far as she knew, she’d never been here before but she followed her inner compass that had her driving over to the courthouse. When she parked, she stared at the building with dread. Something was going on that didn’t make any sense to her. What brought her to this place? What would she find inside? Did she dare go inside? What would she find if she did? She opened her door and got out of her vehicle. Walking slowly over, she reached the huge double doors, she paused but she made herself go inside. Her footsteps echoed in the halls of justice and she frowned as she stopped at one of the courtrooms. She didn’t know what made her stop but when she looked into the courtroom through the window, she frowned.

Taking a deep breath, she pushed the door open and slipped inside. The courtroom was full of people and she gasped as she viewed the room section by section. The section on the right side was filled with people, just ordinary people of the city while the people on the left side looked to be filled with bikers. They all wore dark colored t-shirts and a vest made of soft leather. The back of the vest had a huge Gate and was surrounded by flames and in the middle of the gates was a huge skull that seemed to keep the gates closed. You could see the flames in the hollows where the eyes and nose should be and the skull was smiling eerily.

She shivered as she looked toward the front of the courtroom.

A man sat at the table on the left and another man sat there with him. The first man looked like someone she should know, someone she remembered somewhere in the back of her mind. But she knew she hadn’t met him before which was confusing for her.

Just then, a man who’d been sitting directly behind the other man turned to look at her.

Cat gasped as the sun came through the window and shone on his red hair and his icy blue eyes. Her belly rolled and she felt lightheaded for a moment.

She slipped into the last seat in the back row, then watched as the crowd stood when the Judge walked into the courtroom.

For the next hour, she listened to the charges being read and the plea entered on behalf of the defendant, Dakota Hawkins.

Cat shook her head when the clerk read out the charges, Murder in the first degree in the deaths of three women, Marla Gibbs, Janet Rainer, and Jenna Bannoch. She sat there with tears running down her face at the mention of Jenna’s name. She wanted to cry out that he wasn’t the man who killed her but she couldn’t. Suddenly, she couldn’t breathe and her throat began to swell.

Cat got to her feet and stumbled as she slipped into the aisle then turned to push the door open. The door seemed heavier than it had been when she came in then at the last minute, she turned to look toward the front of the courtroom.

Dakota’s eyes caught hers and he frowned when he saw her tears.

She glanced over at the red haired man sitting directly behind him and his eyes were icy steel now as he stared directly at her.

Cat turned and made her way through the door. She ran from the courtroom, her footsteps clattering loudly in the silence of the courthouse.

As soon as she gained the outside, she slowed down to walk along the street.

She didn’t know where she was going and she didn’t care. She just had to get away from the drama back in the courthouse.

Finally, she stopped and shook her head as she found herself on a street filled with shops. The scent of fresh bread and coffee permeated the air.

She made her way to one of the coffee and tea shops. Opening the door, the heavenly scent of freshly baked breads and cakes hit her.

After ordering, she glanced around the shop and smiled. This was such a relief after the upset she just had. To simply be sitting here, watching the people around her. She always loved to watch people and wonder who they were, what their lives were like. Now as she sat here, she picked up the habit again.

Looking up from her coffee, she found herself staring into cold green eyes. She sucked in a deep breath and was caught in the revelation that she’d seen these eyes before in her nightmares. She tried to pull away from them, but she couldn’t. She felt her heart stop beating in her chest for a moment, then when it began pounding in her chest again, the sensation hurt sending shards of pain throughout her entire body.

The green eyed man then looked away from her to give his attention to his companion.

She could easily confirm his identity with the burnt skin along the right side of his face.

**Two days later….**



Cat got into her car and used her GPS that would take her to the Falls. Her body felt hollow and she had the beginnings of a headache. The girl, Jenna Bannoch, came to her in her dreams the night before. She was lying in the morgue now as the police had found her body but she had begged Cat to help the police find her killer. She didn’t want to stay alone in the dark or not get justice for her death. She didn’t want the wrong man to take the blame for her murder.

January is usually a busy time for event planning - we have an event WiFi and an event coffee business - this is the time of year a lot of our customers start planning for the year, so we get a very early indication.

Last year felt like there was a lot of change in the events world - suppliers, operations, technology, innovation - producers and owners looking to streamline operations, offer more value to guests while trying to increase profit.   
  
We saw 2 sides to the coin. Some events hugely successful, others on the brink.

How are people feeling about 2026? We're feeling strong - more demand for us as suppliers, production teams feeling positive. I'd love to hear what you do and how you feel 2026 will be.....

So I will try to keep the backstory beef. 

- I had a burn out in the 2010's followed by clinical depression and it's when I started my treatment. 
Talk therapy + meds with the same doctor.

- Flash back to 2024 when I was stable, I had a survival job, changed Carrers was pursuing something I loved but my city had so many baggage that I just needed to feel free to start again.

- To move countries and keep my treatment here ( Latin America to EU) I asked my doctor for a full medical report since I was taking a a 3 months worth of med with me as well until I could get my self sorted here. 

- One day when I was organizing my paper work I saw that below my diagnosis my doctor had put a Weird code... My mind went straight to DMS-5 code something I've always inquired about but he told me not to worry about classifications.

- I've Googled the exact code ( hd: icd 10:f60:3 ) and added DM5 at the end... And with his diagnose ans lengthy historic of my behave on the report I am my Borderline...

- Which has greatly affected my (trials) for any romantic relationship whatsoever, when I got here I even dated a guy for a moth or so... And he was very short-tempered ( Italian *but not all Italians*) and when he broke up with me I went on a 3 to 5 day bender of drinking. Crying senting wall texted to him. Asking ""asking what I was my problem?"", if I was ""ugly or whatever"" a pattern that keeps happening every time some dumps me or comes up with ""I see you as a friend"", ""sex was great but..."", "" I didn't feel a spark"" and so on.. shit leads me leads me to drinking, binge eating, and all that. And a week or so of mourning.... 

- Yesterday after a very hopeful date where I spent a week just talking to this guy, that had same values, outlook on relationships, humor, oppeness and all. 
After we met for coffee I sent a playful text about something we had previously joke about.
He answer nicely and understood the joke, but immediately went and said he didn't see a romantic thing between us..

- and even though I stopped dating for a while, and I tried to give this guy a chance I went on manic mode, sent him a wall of texts, he unmatched with me on hinge in the meantime, and this ""reaction of mine"" it's been a recurring thing here .

I have never talked to people with BPD because I thought I was just anxious and a bit of a bitch. 
So I decided to come straight to the source:

- How do you guys navigate dating? Do you tell people, I'm affraid of talking about my depression years. So I don't know how to tackle this. 

- The fear of being alone? 
I had a very N mom that would always tell me when I always tell when I waan't being ""proper"" that if ""I kept being like this nobody would ever want me"" so rejection is something that makes me a monster. 

- I have kept my meds and have doing therapy with a local therapist for 4 to months... This past weeks I was as productive and social as I never was before but now I just feel empty and worthless.

So anyone has been gone through the some similar or have tips? Becauee I can't go in like this.
And I'm really affraid when my dad is gone I will have no support or people that truly care about me and he is pushing 80, and I'm 33 which In gay years it means you are a hag. So do get worried. 

English is my second language but I'm juggling for languages at the same time in my head while I'm crisis. So sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes.

[Part 8],"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pptvib/i_took_a_job_digging_a_hole_in_the_mountains_now/)

I wake up at 6:47 AM from the same nightmare.

Plato's standing in that underground chamber we never reached, back turned, surrounded by arranged stones in geometric patterns I almost understand. He won't turn around. His voice comes out flat, automated: ""You're clocked in forever, T. The benefits are terrible. But you keep showing up.""

I jolt awake in my apartment. Portland. Studio in the Pearl District. Ikea furniture. Spotify playing lo-fi beats. The whole 'I'm a together twenty-something' bullshit aesthetic. Like I'm performing 'functional adult' for some invisible audience.

The routine begins.

Pour-over coffee from beans I researched on Reddit. Ten-minute guided meditation app—Day 67, though I've repeated Day 67 four times because I keep forgetting I already did it. Journaling in a Moleskine: ""Gratitude: sunlight, hot water, having options."" It reads like corporate training for being a real person.

At 10 AM, I have a video date. Chloe. Marketing consultant, twenty-six, likes hiking and natural wine. She's on my laptop screen, smiling, asking about my hobbies. I'm charming. Self-deprecating. Engaged. She's impressed I'm ""so together for twenty-two"" and ""taking time for self-improvement.""

""Yeah, I took some time to figure things out after school,"" I say.

I wasn't lying, exactly. Just... empty words filling up empty space. Like I was auditioning for a life I didn't want.

She suggests coffee next week. I say yes. Won't remember to text her back. She won't be surprised. We're both just playing our parts in this fucked-up dance of pretending to give a shit.

We are both performing ""connection"" for an audience of algorithms.

The second bedroom is supposed to be an office. I don't use it for work. Just this.

Multiple monitors. Browser tabs in the hundreds. Folders labeled ""Personnel,"" ""Sites,"" ""Timeline,"" ""Proof.""

___

I search for Joseph every day. Reverse image search. Business registries. LinkedIn. Corporate filings. ZoomInfo. Leaked datasets. Every shell company name I can invent—GeoThermal Surveying, Northwest Geodetic, Thurberg Mineral. Nothing. Zero. It's like he was rendered in a lab, deployed for a single purpose, then erased.

Carli. Security contractor databases. Private intelligence firms. Military discharge records. Her face yields no matches. She should be somewhere—ex-CIA, Blackwater, corporate espionage. I search ""female security consultants Montana"" and get stock photos.

Koke. I find him. Kurt Okenhauser. Seabee, born 1924, listed MIA in the Pacific Theater, 1944. The archived photo is degraded but the eyes could be his. That would make him a hundred and one. Not possible.

Unless.

I search ""life extension industrial minerals"" and get transhumanist blogs and conspiracy sites. I read them anyway.

Plato's the hardest. I never knew his real name. Never asked. I try facial recognition on a cropped photo from my phone—him grinning at the motel on Day 1. No hits. Missing persons reports, nothing. It's like he was born in that van and died in the chamber and the months between were a glitch.

The hole itself. Forest Service report: ""Unauthorized excavation, Thurberg Wilderness Area, Sector 7-G."" Fine: $2,500, paid by Northwest Geodetic, Inc. I search the company. Dissolved 2005. Twenty years before the dig.

Impossible.

The most terrifying thing isn't that they covered their tracks. It's that there were no tracks to cover. They're like fucking ghosts. Not there until you look away, then they're everywhere. Negative space bullshit that makes you doubt your own eyes.

My proof stored in a fireproof lockbox under my bed:

A photo on my phone. The hole, grainy, taken from the edge. Day 1. The metadata says the date is three weeks after the collapse. Location: Unknown. That's wrong. I remember taking this before we even descended.

Plato's notebook. Wrapped in plastic. Pages covered in frantic handwriting, diagrams, those symbols from the shack. The ink looks fucked, faded one second, sharp the next. Like it's breathing or some shit. Makes my eyes water if I stare too long.

Four hundred dollars in remaining per diem cash. I never deposited it. The bills feel wrong. Too crisp, too heavy. Sometimes the serial numbers look rearranged. I tried to spend a twenty at a grocery store once. The cashier held it up to the light, frowning. ""I think this is fake."" It wasn't fake. It was other.

A photo of me and Plato. Laughing, arms around each other. I don't remember taking it. The metadata says it was shot the morning after the collapse. Plato's eyes, if you zoom in, are vacant. That post-conversion stare. In the background, barely visible: a woman's silhouette. Carli's posture.

I open the lockbox. My fingers brush a page titled ""The God Stones,"" and I am pulled back into the memories of the hole.

The cough hits. I double over, hacking into the black bandana I keep in my pocket now.

Open my hand.

Black dust. Glittering with faint iridescent blue threads. Like the veins in those stones.

Proof ain't for convincing other people. It's for convincing yourself you haven't lost your fucking mind. And I'm running low on convincing.

Sold Koke's stone three months back. Rent was due, fridge was empty, and that fucking thing was humming in my drawer like a vibrator from hell. Needed it gone.

Found a buyer through Reddit—/r/ObscuraMineralia. Posted a vague listing: ""Unique geological sample, small, black, warm to touch, unknown origin.""

The buyer called himself TechBro\_Ascending. Claimed to be a ""biohacker"" in the Bay Area. Wanted it for ""meditation enhancement."" Offered a hundred thousand through crypto, no questions.

Met in a Denny's lot like we were selling weed. Dude shows up in a Tesla, hoodie, that tech-bro smile that says 'I disrupt industries.' Touched the stone and lit up like he'd seen God.

""I can feel it already. This is going to change everything.""

I handed it over. Took the cash. Drove away.

Two weeks later, I checked the forum. His account was deleted. His last post, still visible in Google cache: ""Can't sleep. Can't stop working. Haven't eaten in four days.""

No further posts.

I didn't follow up.

I told myself I didn't kill him. But I knew what the stone was. I sold it anyway. That makes me what? Complicit? Just another node in the supply chain?

I go for a run to clear my head. The cough is worse today. I need air.

The urban park is sleek, manicured, full of young professionals walking dogs. I see a man in a charcoal suit walking a greyhound. The dog never sniffs, never strains. Just walks in perfect sync, staring straight ahead. The man's face is bland, forgettable. Not Joseph. But the aesthetic is identical.

A woman on a bench with Carli's precise posture. Back straight, tablet in lap, stylus moving in controlled strokes. She never looks up. Could be anyone. But my pulse spikes.

An old man feeding pigeons near the pond. Skeletal, weathered, wearing a faded military jacket. When I pass, he turns. For one frame, I see Koke's pale, empty eyes. Then he blinks and he's just old and tired.

They are not them.

But they feel like placeholders. Like the Company's aesthetic leaking into my world, marking territory.

I run harder.

Get turned around. End up in a residential area. Craftsman houses, gardens, families. I stop to catch my breath, look up at a yellow house with a wraparound porch.

In the second-floor window: Plato's face. Staring down. Mouth moving silently: ""Why did you leave me down there, man?""

I blink.

Just the reflection of a tree branch.

The cough seizes me. I bend double, hand braced against a mailbox.

Into my palm: black dust, but this time they move. Writhing. Alive.

Crazy ain't seeing shit that ain't there. It's knowing in your gut that what you're looking at is just fucking wallpaper covering the real deal. And the real deal is a hole that wants to eat you.

___

Back in my apartment. Hands shaking. Pour whiskey. Don't drink it.

My laptop pings.

An encrypted email client I don't remember installing opens automatically. Sleek interface. Corporate. Logo-less.

Attachments:

GPS coordinates. Middle of nowhere. Montana wilderness.

A signed digital contract. My signature, lifted from my state ID, dated six months ago. The day after the collapse. I never signed this. Or don't remember signing it.

Deposit confirmation. Three hundred thousand dollars just cleared through my crypto wallet. Timestamp: thirty seconds ago.

I open my banking app with shaking hands.

The fifteen thousand is there. Real. Spendable.

My phone buzzes. New calendar alert I didn't create:

**FLIGHT: PDX → BZN (Bozeman)** **TOMORROW 6:00 AM** **Pack for cold weather. Work boots required.**

I never got out. I was just on unpaid leave. And the boss is a mountain. And the HR department is a hole in the earth. And the performance review is whether you die screaming or smiling.

I don't fight it.

And just like that, I can breathe again. Six months of holding my fucking breath, and now I can exhale. Because the hole wants me. Needs me. And being needed beats being free. Like a muscle I've been clenching for six months finally unclenching.

I pack. Carhartts. Thermal layers. The boots I bought and never threw away. Plato's notebook wrapped carefully like a Bible. The cursed cash that might spend at the camp. That poem of his I got printed out.

I look around the apartment. It already looks staged. An Airbnb. Someone else's idea of what a ""together twenty-something"" lives in. The lease is paid through December. Month-to-month after. The landlord can keep the deposit.

I cough into my hand once more and wipe it against my jeans, forcing myself to think clearly.

The job was garbage, the management bordered on unhinged, and the work had literally broken men's minds. Yet it was tangible, and I was good at it. When I couldn't remember who I was, they did.

The apartment door clicks shut behind me as I leave it unlocked and don't bother with a final glance backward.

My neighbor appears in the hallway, a young guy who works in tech, perpetually pleasant.

""Hey man, early flight?""

I nod at him. ""Work trip.""

""Cool, cool."" He shifts his weight slightly. ""What do you do again?""

""Extraction.""

He doesn't probe any further.

The pre-dawn streets stretch empty before me as I walk through the city, coffee shops still shuttered in the darkness.

This isn't a dash to the airport but something more like magnetism pulling me forward.

I'm not fleeing toward the hole but escaping from the fugue state that passed for normal life. The apps, the online courses, the performance art of stability. That was the real nightmare, drifting through this bullshit life with no purpose, no use, no reason to exist. The hole gave me a job. Gave me meaning. Even if that meaning was dying in a fucking hole.

The hole was savage and brutal, but it had use for me.

And I need to be useful.

PAUL:
Yeah… that one actually lowers trust, not raises it.
When the example of “utility under pressure” is a sanctioned economy moving money through opaque channels, regular people don’t hear resilience. They hear desperation plus arbitrage.

WES:
Exactly. Context matters.
A system demonstrating “functionality” only under instability is not evidence of robustness. It is evidence of exploitation pathways. Stability is proven when a tool is boring during calm, not exciting during collapse.

STEVE:
Builder translation.
If your strongest case study is “it still works when everything else is broken,” that’s not a feature. That’s a warning label. Builders want tools that work before things break.

ROOMBA:

ILLUMINA:
And notice the emotional sleight of hand.
They say “people turn to tools that remain functional.”
They don’t say who benefits, who bleeds, or who exits last.
Trust doesn’t grow from survival narratives. It grows from reciprocity and repair.

PAUL:
Right.
Korea saying “this is scamming people” actually raises trust, because it aligns with lived experience. This post does the opposite. It confirms why locals, workers, and even insiders don’t touch it.

If your defense of a system requires geopolitical distress to look reasonable, the system already failed the human test.

1qj3ucu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BornWeakBuiltStrong/comments/1qj3ucu/how_to_talk_to_anyone_sciencebased_conversation/,How to Talk to Anyone: Science-Based Conversation Frameworks That Actually Work,"Most advice about social skills is absolute garbage. It's always ""just be confident"" or ""fake it till you make it"" which helps literally no one. I spent years thinking I was broken because small talk felt like pulling teeth and networking events made me want to crawl into a hole. Turns out I just needed actual frameworks, not cheerleading.

After diving deep into communication research, psychology podcasts, and books by actual experts (not Instagram life coaches), I realized something wild: being introverted isn't the problem. The problem is nobody teaches you the MECHANICS of conversation. It's like expecting someone to drive without ever explaining how a clutch works.

Here's what actually moves the needle:

1. Stop treating conversations like interviews

Most people ask boring questions then wait for their turn to talk. That's not conversation, that's taking turns reading from a script. The game changer is something called ""thread theory"" which I learned from Patrick King's ""Better Small Talk."" This book is INSANELY good at breaking down why most conversations die after 30 seconds.

King (who's a social interaction specialist and has written like 20+ books on human behavior) explains that every statement someone makes contains multiple ""threads"" you can pull on. Someone says ""I just got back from Denver""? That's not one topic, that's five: the trip itself, why they went, what they did there, how Denver compares to where you are, their travel preferences in general.

Pick the thread that genuinely interests you and pull it. Then pull threads from their response. Suddenly you're 10 minutes deep talking about their obsession with finding the best coffee shops in every city, and you barely had to perform at all.

2. Use the conversation ratio that actually works

Here's something that blew my mind from research: the ideal conversation ratio is 43/57. You talk 43% of the time, them 57%. This comes from quantitative analysis of thousands of successful conversations.

Stop trying to be ""on"" the whole time. Your job is to be a catalyst, not a performer. Ask questions that make THEM feel interesting. The best conversationalists aren't the funniest people in the room, they're the ones who make others feel heard.

Celeste Headlee's TED talk ""10 Ways to Have a Better Conversation"" (over 20 million views for a reason) hammers this home. She's a journalist who's conducted thousands of interviews, and her main point is: be more interested than interesting. When you're genuinely curious about someone's answer, follow up questions flow naturally because you actually want to know more.

3. Have a go-to script for the first 60 seconds

I know, I know, scripts sound fake. But here's the thing: once you get past the awkward opening, conversations flow naturally. The beginning is the only part that trips people up.

Leil Lowndes' ""How to Talk to Anyone"" (bestseller with 92 proven techniques) suggests having 3-4 ""gambits"" ready to go. Not pickup lines, just solid conversation starters that work in different contexts. Mine are:

""What's been taking up most of your time lately?"" (works anywhere)

""How do you know \[host/mutual connection\]?"" (at events)

""What brought you to \[location/event\]?"" (when traveling or at specific venues)

These beat ""what do you do?"" because they let people talk about what they actually care about right now, not their job title they've explained 400 times.

4. Silence isn't your enemy

Introverts panic during pauses. Extroverts often do too, but they fill silence with noise. Neither approach works. Brief silences in conversation are NORMAL and often mean someone's actually thinking about what you said (crazy concept, right?).

I started using an app called Slowly for practicing written conversation with people worldwide. Yeah it's a pen pal app, but it taught me that thoughtful responses are better than quick responses. When this translated to real conversations, I stopped rushing to fill every gap and people actually seemed more engaged.

There's also BeFreed, an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio content. What's useful here is that it pulls from science-backed communication research and creates adaptive learning plans based on your specific social goals. You can customize the depth, from 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. It covers all the books mentioned above and includes a virtual coach you can ask questions mid-session. Worth checking if you want structured learning that fits your schedule.

5. Exit conversations like a normal human

Nobody teaches you how to END conversations without it being weird. You're not trapped. If it's going well, exchange info: ""This was great, I'd love to continue this sometime. Want to swap numbers?"" If it's dying, use an honest exit: ""I'm gonna grab another drink/say hi to some other folks, but really nice meeting you.""

The book ""Captivate"" by Vanessa Van Edwards (she runs a human behavior research lab and has analyzed thousands of hours of social interaction) has an entire chapter on graceful exits. Her research shows that how you END a conversation affects how people remember the entire interaction more than anything you said in the middle.

6. Remember the Golden Ratio of listening

Use the 70/30 rule: Listen 70%, talk 30%. But ""listening"" doesn't mean silently waiting. It means active engagement like ""That's fascinating, how did you figure that out?"" or ""Wait, so what happened next?"" Real listening involves verbal and nonverbal cues that show you're tracking.

7. Steal the ""curiosity method""

Approach every person like they have one piece of information that could change your life. Maybe they know the perfect book recommendation, or a life hack, or a perspective you've never considered. This mindset shift makes conversations feel less like obligations and more like treasure hunts.

Look, you don't need to become a social butterfly. You just need tools that work with your brain, not against it. Being introverted means you process things internally and recharge alone. It doesn't mean you can't connect deeply with people, you just do it differently than extroverts.

The science is clear: social connection is non-negotiable for mental health and life satisfaction. But connection doesn't mean performing or pretending to be someone you're not. It means having frameworks that reduce the cognitive load so conversations feel less like work and more like actual human interaction.

Start with one technique. Master it. Then add another. Nobody's expecting you to become the life of the party, just someone who can navigate social situations without wanting to fake a phone call and escape.",1,1769015673.0,BornWeakBuiltStrong,0,1.0,False

I live in the south so temps are mild and the attire fit the weather.  After retiring in 2020, I was looking for something to spice up the weekends and eventually bought some Truman’s.   This turned into a slight obsession before stumbling into Nicks looking at boots on the Web.  

Since my first pair of Nicks (Pullman IBC’s) in late 2024, I have since sold all Truman’s and am wearing solely (no pun intended) Nicks.  Not only does Nicks have great quality, craftsmanship and customer service it provides me something more. 

Nicks adds a little bit of joy each day knowing that in the morning there is a great pair(s) of boots set out in my closet to be put on first thing.   No more workout clothes when I get up.  I’ll be fully dressed in jeans and Nicks when I walk out of the bedroom to get coffee to start the day.  I feel better about the day and have a better mindset. 

These things are tanks and are designed for a lot more than I can give them. But they give me something back as well so I want to keep wearing them.  Cheers to the Nicks Boots team and this sub-Reddit for making my day a little better!

1qj3s69,https://english.deshabhimani.com/deshabhimani-english-/kerala-news/cffi-presidential-assent-kerala-wildlife-law,"CFFI Seeks Presidential Assent for Kerala Wildlife Law, Calls for Similar Reforms Nationwide","> New Delhi: The Coffee Farmers Federation of India (CFFI) expresses its deep concern over the alarming rise in human-wildlife conflicts across coffee-growing regions in South India. Incidents involving elephants, wild boars, deer, monkeys, peacocks, and other protected species raiding coffee plantations have become frequent and devastating. Thousands of small and marginal farmers—the backbone of India’s coffee industry—are bearing the brunt. Beyond crop loss, these encounters pose serious threats to the safety and lives of farmers and plantation workers. The wildlife menace also prevents farmers and workers from managing coffee plants effectively, severely impacting both production and productivity.   
   
> Currently, the severe problem of wildlife-induced crop loss and livelihood destruction is not receiving urgent, focused attention in policy circles. The scale of this crisis is starkly highlighted by a recent study from the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics. Focusing solely on Maharashtra, the study estimates the economic damage at approximately 40,000 crore rupees in a single financial year. This staggering figure reflects not only direct crop loss but also the sustained decline in agricultural production and productivity caused by persistent wildlife conflicts, which disrupt farming cycles and undermine farmers’ confidence to invest in agriculture. A similar scientific study in coffee-growing regions would reveal the depth of the crisis faced by coffee farmers and workers.   
   
> The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972—the primary legislation governing wildlife—is unscientific, draconian, and anti-farmer in spirit. In this context, CFFI commends the proactive step taken by the Left-led Government of Kerala in amending the Wildlife Protection Act (WLPA) to include crucial, pro-farmer provisions aimed at mitigating conflicts and ensuring faster compensation. This state-level initiative stands in stark contrast to the actions of the RSS-BJP-led Union government. Vested interests are reportedly maneuvering to deny presidential assent to the Kerala amendments. CFFI urges the Governor of Kerala to act swiftly to ensure presidential assent is granted on a war footing to the historic amendments passed by the Kerala Assembly. We also call upon other state governments in coffee-growing regions to initiate similar legislative amendments based on the Kerala model.   
   
> CFFI demands that the Union government take steps to decentralize mitigation efforts by actively involving Local Self-Government bodies. These local bodies must be empowered and funded to play a central role in managing human-wildlife conflict, including the planning, implementation, and maintenance of scientific, location-specific fencing and other effective physical barriers, in consultation with affected farming communities and ecological experts. Efforts should be made to link employment guarantee scheme to this process. Scientific culling should also be considered as part of mitigation measures.   
   
> CFFI calls upon its state and village-level units to organize local mass movements against wildlife attacks on human life, domestic animals, and crops, demanding:   
   
> 1. Protect the right to life and livelihood by declaring compensation of ₹1 crore for death and ₹20 lakh for serious injury, and doubling the price for loss of cattle and crops, with the Union government and respective state governments sharing costs in an 80:20 ratio.   
   
> 2. Ensure a permanent solution by:   
   
> · Constructing dual protection measures such as Elephant Proof Trenches (EPT) and wire mesh fencing at a height of 4 meters (12 feet) to prevent intrusions by elephants, wild boar, and deer, as well as building elephant walls and bridges as required, through MGNREGA.   
   
> · This will protect crops, domestic animals, and human life.   
   
> 3. Replenish forests to ensure adequate food and water for animals by:   
   
> · Clearing artificial plantations of Teak, Eucalyptus, Mahogany, etc., in a phased manner.   
   
> · Eliminating invasive weeds such as Senna spectabilis, which wreak ecological havoc in forests.   
   
> · Promoting natural growth and developing water bodies within forest cover to ensure fodder and water for wildlife.   
   
> CFFI calls upon farmers to form joint action committees to organize mass campaigns, collect signatures, and conduct sustained protests—including day-and-night demonstrations—until these demands are met.   
   
> CFFI reiterates that protecting the livelihood of coffee farmers is essential to preserving the unique ecosystem of the coffee-growing regions. We urgently call upon the Union Ministries of Environment, Forest & Climate Change and Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare, along with concerned state governments, to formulate and implement region-specific action plans to protect farmers.

How do you screen out people who are likely to do this?","Went on a date this past Saturday for the first time after breaking up with my partner in September of last year. We talked on and off while she was away for holidays, then we met for coffee. She insisted on not doing dinner for a first date as a principle of hers, which I think is smart. Lower time and financial burden, and truly I don’t care as long as we can talk and interact naturally. 

We chatted for 2.5 hours — really lively conversations that felt reciprocal, lots of jokes, and I could tell she was hanging on my words at times. She was having a hard time pouring tea without spilling, and I did it perfectly for her several times to her shock and awe. Seemed like a cute moment and we had a good laugh over it. Towards the end, she noticed a flyer for an event and said “this seems like something we’d both enjoy”. Walking her back to her metro stop she was even complementing me as being both analytical and creative, which she thought was rare. 

Almost all green flags, and it was a really refreshing and natural seeming date, so I texted her Saturday night saying I had a good time etc etc. Nothing but crickets! I followed up yesterday very concisely inviting her to the event she herself pointed out, total silence. 

I’m accepting that it’s highly likely that I’ll never hear back and that’s okay because it indicates we maybe have different values. I also recognize she owes me nothing at all. Especially after just reentering the dating pool though, it’s frustrating because I’m usually cautious and selective about who I go on dates with to avoid situations like this. 

So I’m curious to ask Reddit, how do you avoid going on dates with people who would be fine with ghosting you? Is it just the cost of having skin in the game for you? If so, what do you do to protect your peace when it inevitably happens? ",2,1769015370.0,datingadviceformen,6,1.0,False

Verse 1

Woke up to the grind, mind on the climb

bills stack but I'm back on my time

coffee cold but the soul stay bold

young in the spirit, gold when I'm old



alarm clock screaming like it's personal

rehearsing for a life that feel reversible

thirty-something stuck between the was and the will be

bills on the counter and they still see me



microwave dinner, winner of nothing yet

stomach full of ramen and a little bit of regret

but regret don't pay rent so I pivot

life gave me lemons, I'm tryna live it



Hook

same sun rise on the penthouse and the bus stop

same moon shine on the come up and the does not

we all just trying to make it make sense

putting dollars on dreams and paying the rent



Verse 2

mama called, asked me how I'm doing

said I'm good but we both know who I'm fooling

she heard it in my voice, the weight of the choice

between playing it safe and amplifying the noise



pops worked forty years at the same spot

told me get a trade son, these dreams is a long shot

but he still asked me to play him my new stuff

sat quiet for a minute, said it's good but it's too rough



too rough, that's the realest thing he said

too polished is too fake, I'll take rough instead

sandpaper soul, smoothing out with every verse

could be better, could be worse, least I'm putting in the work



Verse 3

friday night, homies want to hit the town

but the laptop open and I'm hunting for the sound

they don't get it, I don't blame em, it's a lonely road

trading parties for the craft, watching legends on the cold



youtube rabbit holes at 3am

studying the greats, wondering when

my turn comes around, if it ever does

doing it for love cause love's the only buzz



that don't fade when the morning come

still be here when the streaming funds

read zero and the comments none

I'm the tree in the forest, still I run



Hook

same sun rise on the penthouse and the bus stop

same moon shine on the come up and the does not

we all just trying to make it make sense

putting dollars on dreams and paying the rent



Outro

so if you feel this, you already know

it ain't about the numbers, it's about the growth

one bar at a time, one day at a time

one life to live, might as well make it rhyme

If anyone has any thoughts/tips though... I'm certainly all ears. I don't know where to go from here in a way that's mentally and emotionally healthy.

I (41F) have basically always been overweight. When I hit puberty I gained about 45 pounds and went from a lean pre-teen to a ""big"" high-schooler, and have been an American size 10/12/14/16 ever since. I've had periods where I was exceptionally active... I was on the swim team... cross-country... college rowing team... worked as a hiking guide... Crossfit 6x/week... still average 12,000 steps a day... you name the workout/diet and I've tried it. I've occasionally been small(er) and very strong, but I've never been a ""normal"" BMI or size.

As an adult I had finally come to accept my body and my appearance, but last year I gained \*another\* 30 pounds or so after a major illness and round of steroids... and I feel like it's given my entire family (and seemingly everyone I know) license to talk to me about my weight constantly and it's bringing up some wild PTSD. How I'm doing, what ""easy trick"" I should try, how making a small change (just use milk instead of half and half in your coffee!) will unlock the secret to this lifelong fucking battle. How I should try a semiglutide (I have), how it's probably my thyroid (it's not), how I have a gluten intolerance (I don't), what workout I should try (oh, Pilates and light yoga helped you lose all the baby weight? Love it...), on and on and on. I. AM. SO. SICK. OF. IT. It's making me neurotic and depressed.

One of my best friends has gotten pretty heavy (300+ pounds) and you know what? I kind of get it. I kind of get just throwing in the towel and leaning in and at least enjoying a meal or a drink or a vacation. I work so hard to look so mediocre, to \*still\* not feel pretty, worthy, or able to hang with friends who ski/mountain-bike/club etc. At some point what's the point of the calorie counting, the workout tracking, the money invested in personal trainers, diet drugs, apps, betting on myself to lose weight, posting a picture of myself naked inside the fridge... the self-loathing and feeling so fucking frustrated with my friends who seem so self-righteous about their success and make being overweight seem like such a moral failure. I've put off having a baby because I can't imagine gaining even *more* weight... and now I'm worried I've run the clock in pursuit of a body and life I'll never have.

Last night my mom sent me some stupid weight loss video ""hack"" on Facebook Messenger, and something inside me just fucking snapped. I don't know why it was such a trigger, but I just started sobbing uncontrollably. I feel like I'm grieving this life I never got to live - where I was thin and accepted and not uncomfortable for 95% of my adult life. Where I got asked to homecoming. Where I didn't secretly hate my wedding photos. Where I didn't worry about my sweaty thigh touching the person next to me on the airplane. Where I could shop with my friends and not have to ""love"" the accessories at Forever 21 because I couldn't fit in any of the jeans. Where I got the job instead of the less qualified (but much thinner!) intern. I cried for hours and hours. It felt like I was 13 again sitting at the doctor with my mom asking ""What should we do?"" and having the doctor wave a patronizing finger and remind me to ""move more and eat less""... as I was going to swim practice every morning at 5 am and coming home to a salad and a run with dad, and then getting made fun of in gym class because of my huge ass.

I'm not sure what the point of this is... ATM I'm sitting here filling out my calorie counting app (did I eat half an apple or the whole thing? Did I underestimate that peanut butter?) wondering what instrument or language or talent I could have perfected in the hours of my life I've wasted trying to losing weight. I am so tired.

Ten years ago 10:45pm meant the night was just starting.

I work, I pay bills, I even manage to keep some money saved up. Nothing dramatic is wrong. But everything feels… heavier? Like even small things take more mental energy than they used to. I catch myself getting excited about really boring stuff now. A new sponge that actually works. A good deal on coffee. Cancelling plans and staying home.

Real humor doesn’t need approval cycles.
Real systems don’t need twelve paragraphs to say “nothing is happening here.”

The breakthrough? Most dating advice is built for extroverts and actively works against how our brains are wired.

Society pushes this narrative that you need to be ""on"" all the time, hit up loud bars, small talk with strangers for hours. But here's what research on temperament and dating actually shows: introverts who force extroverted dating patterns burn out faster and attract incompatible partners. The fix isn't becoming someone you're not. It's working WITH your natural wiring, not against it.

**Reframe ""dates"" around depth, not stimulation**

Traditional dinner-and-drinks dates are designed for surface level chat in overstimulating environments. Instead, suggest activities that facilitate actual connection: museum visits, bookstore browsing, hiking, pottery classes. Dr. Elaine Aron's research on highly sensitive people (many introverts fall here) shows we process information more deeply and notice subtleties others miss. Use this. A quiet walk reveals way more about compatibility than screaming over club music.

[The book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8520610-quiet)by Susan Cain (NYT bestseller, TED talk with 40M+ views) completely shifted how I view introversion. Cain breaks down the science of why we need different conditions to thrive. This isn't just self-help fluff, it's neuroscience-backed research showing introverts literally have different brain chemistry around dopamine sensitivity. Best book on introversion I've ever read, hands down.

**Build in recovery time between dates**

Here's what nobody tells you: dating fatigue is REAL for introverts. Our nervous systems need alone time to regulate. I used to book dates back to back because I thought that's what you're supposed to do, then wonder why I felt emotionally depleted and resentful. Block out buffer days. If you had a date Friday, don't schedule another until Tuesday. This isn't being antisocial, it's basic self-preservation.

The app Finch helped me actually track my social battery and build better boundaries. It's a self-care app where you raise a little bird while building habits. Sounds silly but it gamifies checking in with yourself about energy levels. Made me way more aware of when I was overextending.

There's also [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), an AI learning app that generates personalized podcasts from books, research papers, and dating expert insights. You can literally type in ""become a more confident introvert in dating"" and it pulls from resources like Attached, Quiet, and relationship psychology research to create a custom learning plan. The depth is adjustable too, so you can do a quick 10-minute overview or go deep with a 40-minute session full of examples and actionable strategies. It helped me connect dots between attachment theory, introversion science, and practical dating approaches without having to read five separate books.

**Text strategically, not constantly**

Early dating culture expects constant texting and it's exhausting. Set a boundary early: you're not glued to your phone and prefer quality conversation over quantity. Most secure people respect this. Insecure people who need constant validation will self-select out, which honestly saves you time.

Dr. John Gottman's research (he can predict divorce with 90% accuracy) shows that communication style compatibility matters way more than communication frequency. His work emphasizes that introverts often prefer written communication where we can process before responding. Use this to your advantage. Thoughtful texts beat rapid-fire small talk.

**Pick venues that play to your strengths**

Bars and clubs drain introverts fast. Coffee shops, galleries, botanical gardens, small music venues where you can actually hear each other work infinitely better. You're not boring for preferring these, you're being strategic. In these environments, your ability to hold deep conversation and really listen becomes a massive advantage.

Also consider video call first dates. I know it sounds weird but hear me out, you can test chemistry without the exhaustion of getting ready, commuting, sitting in a loud restaurant. If the vibe's off, you're already home. If it's great, meet up next time with way more confidence.

**Lead with your introversion, don't hide it**

Biggest mistake I made was pretending to be more outgoing than I am. Attracted people who wanted a social butterfly, then felt constant pressure to perform. Now I mention pretty early that I'm introverted, love deep conversation, need alone time to recharge. The right people find this attractive, not problematic.

The book Attached by Amir Levine breaks down attachment theory and helped me realize I was dating anxious attachment people who needed constant external validation. As a secure/avoidant leaning introvert, I need partners comfortable with space and independence. Understanding YOUR attachment style and filtering for compatible ones is game changing.

For video content, the YouTube channel [The School of Life](https://youtube.com/@theschooloflifetv?si=5IPE1I56cRx3N4ui) has brilliant animated videos on relationships, attachment, and compatibility. Their perspective on modern dating culture and why traditional advice fails certain temperaments is incredibly validating.

Bottom line: dating as an introvert isn't about forcing yourself into extroverted molds. It's about designing a dating approach that works with your wiring. The people worth dating will appreciate your depth, not demand you become someone else.",2,1769014750.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False
1qj3e6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychesystems/comments/1qj3e6u/the_psychology_of_reading_people_6_sciencebased/,The Psychology of Reading People: 6 Science-Based Tricks That Actually Work,"You ever meet someone and just *know* something's off? Or maybe you can't tell if your date's
actually into you or just being polite? Yeah, me too. After diving deep into behavioral psychology
(books, research papers, FBI interrogation tactics, you name it), I realized most of us are
walking around completely blind to the obvious signals people throw at us every single day.
Here's the thing: reading people isn't some mystical superpower. It's pattern recognition. And
once you know what to look for, you can't unsee it. These tricks come from legit sources like Joe
Navarro (ex-FBI guy who literally wrote the book on body language), psychology research, and
yeah, some hard lessons from my own social fuckups.
Let's get into it.
## 1. Watch Their Feet, Not Their Face
Everyone focuses on facial expressions because we think that's where the truth lives. Wrong.
People control their faces way more than you think. They smile when they're uncomfortable, nod
when they disagree, maintain eye contact when they're lying their ass off.
But feet? Feet don't lie.
If someone's feet are pointed toward you during conversation, they're engaged and interested. If
their feet are angled toward the door or away from you, their brain is already somewhere else.
They might be smiling and nodding, but their body is screaming ""get me out of here.""
This comes straight from What Every Body is Saying by Joe Navarro, an ex-FBI
counterintelligence officer who spent 25 years reading criminals and spies. This book is
INSANE. It breaks down every micro-gesture humans make when they're lying, stressed, or
hiding something. If you want to level up your people-reading game, this is non-negotiable. Best
body language book that exists, period.
## 2. Look for Pacifying Behaviors Under Stress
When people feel threatened or uncomfortable, they do weird little things to calm themselves
down. Touching their neck, rubbing their lips, playing with their hair, adjusting their collar. These
are called pacifying behaviors, and they're your cheat code to knowing when someone's anxious
or lying.
In high-stress conversations (job interviews, confrontations, first dates), watch for these
movements. If someone suddenly starts touching their face or neck right after you ask a
question, that question made them uncomfortable. Their limbic system (the lizard brain) took
over and tried to self-soothe.
You can practice this anywhere. Watch people in uncomfortable situations: waiting rooms,
awkward Zoom calls, tense family dinners. Once you start seeing it, you'll notice it everywhere.
## 3. Read Baseline Behavior First
This one's crucial and most people skip it. You can't know if someone's acting weird unless you
know how they act normally. That's their baseline.
Spend the first 10-15 minutes of any interaction just observing. How much do they gesture? Do
they make eye contact? Are they naturally fidgety or calm? Once you've got their baseline,
*then* you can spot deviations.
If someone who's usually chill suddenly gets fidgety when a specific topic comes up, that's your
signal. If someone who never touches their face starts rubbing their nose, pay attention. The
change matters more than the behavior itself.
This technique is used by professional interrogators and profilers. They don't just jump in with
hard questions. They establish normal first, then watch for cracks.
## 4. Mirror to Build Trust, Then Break to Test
Mirroring is when you subtly copy someone's body language, tone, or speech patterns. It's one
of the fastest ways to build rapport because it signals ""we're alike, you're safe with me."" People
do it naturally when they vibe with someone.
But here's the advanced move: once you've built that connection through mirroring, *stop
mirroring and see if they follow you*. If they start copying your movements or posture, congrats,
you've got influence. They're subconsciously trying to maintain that connection. If they don't
follow, the rapport isn't as strong as you thought.
Try this at a coffee shop or bar. Match their energy level, posture, drink pace. After 10 minutes,
shift your posture completely and see what happens. It's like a social experiment you can run in
real time.
## 5. Listen to What They Don't Say
People reveal more through omission than admission. When someone tells you a story and
skips over a detail that should obviously be there, that's where the truth is hiding.
""How was your weekend?"" ""Oh, great! Went hiking, grabbed dinner, chilled at home."" Notice
what's missing? Who they were with. If someone avoids mentioning people in their stories,
there's usually a reason.
Same with job interviews. If someone talks about their last job but never mentions their boss or
team, red flag. If they describe a project but avoid explaining their specific role, they probably
didn't do much.
This trick comes from investigative journalism and therapy techniques. Trained listeners don't
just hear what's said, they map what's conspicuously absent. Start doing this and conversations
become way more revealing.
## 6. Watch for Microexpressions (The 0.5 Second Truth)
Microexpressions are involuntary facial flashes that last less than half a second. They're your
true emotional reaction before your brain catches up and puts on the ""appropriate"" face. Most
people miss them entirely because they're so fast.
The most common ones: disgust (nose wrinkle), contempt (one-sided mouth raise), fear (raised
eyebrows, widened eyes), and anger (lowered brows, tight lips).
Someone might say ""I'm totally fine with that"" while flashing contempt for a split second. That
microexpression is the truth. The words are the cover-up.
Paul Ekman spent his entire career researching this stuff, and his work was the basis for the
show *Lie to Me*. If you want to train yourself, there are apps and online tools where you can
practice spotting microexpressions. It's like a gym workout for your observation skills.

If you're serious about going deeper into behavioral psychology and people-reading skills,
there's this AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from exactly these kinds of sources, books
like Navarro's work, Ekman's research on microexpressions, FBI interrogation techniques, and
tons of psychology studies. You type in what you want to learn (like ""master reading body

personalized audio content with adaptive learning plans based on your specific goals. You can
customize how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives

1qj3e37,https://i.redd.it/uhgd0wbygqeg1.png,Tried to post this in Save our Saanich but was rejected.,"I originally wrote this message to reach out to the members of Save our Saanich, a group organizing against the Quadra McKenzie plan, but they would not let me post the message in their Facebook group. 

It was great to see everyone at Saanich council on Monday!

One of their organizers, Nancy deCastri, mentioned in her speech to Saanich council that Homes for Living has pivoted from advocating for ""missing middle"" housing. This is not the case. We consistently advocate for the legalization of 4 storey apartments, townhomes, heritage conserving infill, and other missing middle housing. 

These forms of housing, alongside small-scale mixed use corner stores and coffee shops, help build complete communities— places where you can live, work and walk for almost all of your daily needs. This is more affordable and equitable for everyone.

I think this gets confused when Homes for Living also advocates for higher density. In BC zoning usually regulates ""highest use."" If an area is zoned for a 4 or 6 storey apartment, homebuilders can also build townhomes with minimal bureaucratic interference. This is especially true in places that have updated their zoning code like Victoria— every lot allows anything from a 3-5 storey apartment (6-7 on major roads) to a single family home, no rezoning required.

What's also changed since the pandemic is the evidence from other places facing housing crises. Places like Minneapolis, where the anglophone housing crisis was identified quickly and addressed quickly, [show that the clearest and quickest way to lower housing costs](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2025/unpacking-supply-and-demand-in-rent-trends-since-the-minneapolis-2040-plan) is to build as many mid-rise (5-12 storey) apartment buildings as fast as possible.

This evidence is in part why municipalities like Saanich and Victoria are proposing broad upzoning to higher heights and for bigger apartments. The fewer projects required to address the crisis, the faster the crisis can get addressed. 

In BC there seem to be three main routes that urban municipalities have been taking to build housing:

1) the ""Grand Bargain"" where municipalities push all development into towers along arterial roads and transit. Think Burnaby— big towers, sprawling single family neighbourhoods. This method  hasn't been successful because the allowable places to build housing are so small relative to the demand. It also leads to the undesirable situation of single family homes right next to 20+ story towers, permanently.

2)  the ""Paris Standard"" where municipalities allow 5-7 storey apartments everywhere, in addition to taller residential buildings in core areas. Victoria just did this, time will tell if it works, especially with recent changes to seismic code that make building apartments significantly more expensive. Victoria did this with comparatively little pushback. In fact, the new OCP and zoning was quite popular. 

3) somewhere in the middle, where neighbourhoods are relegated to under 4 storeys and taller buildings are pushed to main roads. Saanich is seemingly trying to do this and pleasing pretty much nobody in the process. 

4) Very little planning at all. Imagine Langford under Mayor Young. While Langford managed to densify a core area, Langford sold of large portions of the municipality to developers and have very little control over anything that happens in those sections. This approach built a lot of housing but is already proving to be a real pain to service and manage, particularly for transportation.

Homes for Living has largely been in support of options 2 and 3, with a preference for option 2, the Paris Standard. This allows for the most variety in types of neighbourhoods while still allowing for sensible planning and infrastructure management.

We've also advocated for changes to allow smaller but taller buildings, like allowing single-stair buildings.  

Our preference is generally for allowing low- and mid-rise apartments in all neighbourhoods, alongside townhomes, houseplexes, and garden suites. In some cases taller buildings are appropriate, such as near major transit routes and commercial centres such as what you find along Quadra, Shelbourne, or McKenzie. This is what Victoria has done. We believe this approach maintains vibrant and welcoming neighbourhoods while also tackling the housing crisis at an appropriate scale. After all, our goal is affordable neighbourhoods—we want to live here too!

Last month, it dawned on me, hey idiot, you have all the classic symptoms of HTN. So I began having both provider and I check my blood pressure regularly. I was correct. Consistently in 150s/100 and oftentimes symptomatic.

Were any of you able to successfully stop using nicotine and only be on a calcium channel blocker for a short amount of time and turn your HTN around?

“Hail to you, Dreamer. Be not afraid. Listen well as I speak the words you must hear more than any other.”

…

Percival sat on the rumbling carriage, his eyes fixed dead ahead as the caravan went down into the gaping, all consuming hole that held Verum’s prison, The Dungeon. The moment the darkness consumed the wagon, he hopped out of the cart and marched alongside the massive lizards that pulled the wagon ever onward. His hand rested on the sturdy steel sword that had been his only constant companion since he was fourteen. After twenty years of fighting, both master and sword were ready for anything. 

Dark brown hair was quickly concealed by a sturdy iron helmet. His amber eyes were the only things on his face visible once the visor was dropped into place. It was good for him, at least. It hid the gnarly scar that ran from his bottom lip up to the top of his right ear. A reminder of why guards like him are essential. 

His armor clicked while he rolled his shoulders - an announcement that he was ready for business. He had been hired as a Vanguard. Percival stalked the cave like an Executioner. “Strangers, wel-.” A woman partially greeted as the caravan passed. Percival looked at her, his helmet covering most of his face. She clicked her tongue and her hand moved from a dagger. Bad luck for her, he was. “...welcome to the Dark Market.” She grumbled, melting into the shadows and skulking away. A fine start. 

“We're headed to the Merchant’s Meet.” The caravan owner said, the other guards finally taking their posts. Lazy bastards, probably in cahoots with some of the rats down here. “I'll hire a room for you as well, then -”

“No need.” Percical said, pointing deeper into the Market. “I've got arrangements.” The owner gave him a worried look. Lone adventurers don't last long in this place. But he also knew better than to offer help in this place. With a nod and a wave, the two parted ways. Percival took slow steps, his eyes scanning every alleyway for cutthroats and thieves. A few children ran by, laughing and shouting obscenities in various languages. Percival stepped aside to let them pass. 

About an hour later, the sign he was looking for came into view. The Smokey Hearth - a modest but well reputed inn. Out of respect, he removed his helmet and fastened his sword into the sheath. Percival stepped in and his ears were assaulted by the bellowing laugh of a moving mountain. “Welcome, friend! Have a seat - we've got fresh rolls, we'll bring some out in a minute.” Even from the kitchen, not only could John be seen and heard, he could practically shake bone and stone with his laugh. Twas infectious, too, as Percival found himself smiling as he sat. He reached for his coinpouch to pay the man and froze. 

Gone. 

With a grunt of annoyance and potential for murder, he stood. Before he could leave, the door swung open again. A tall man came in with three children in tow. “Oi, Johnny, keep your brats in line next time, yeah? Found this little shite digging for mice near the Wasp Den.” Despite his gruff tone, the man didn't seem upset. He even had a small smile. The child he was currently carrying under his arm like spare luggage looked guilty, probably the ‘little shite’. One walked beside him carrying a rusty trinket of some sort. And a third was hanging on his back and laughing up a storm. Clearly, they were familiar with the man.

“I think this is yours, bud.” The man said, tossing a coin purse onto the table. “Lighter, I know. Call it a finder's fee.” He said with a wink, placing a few pilfered silver marks on the counter. Breakfast for two, it seemed. He turned, and Percival nodded.

“Another Dreamer.” Percival introduced himself and held out a hand.

“Call me Konrad.” The man ignored the offering and sat. He had sharp eyes that made Percival bristle. They had barely exchanged ten words and both men were getting a feeling for each other. Konrad saw a dead man walking. Percival saw a viper that had yet to bear its fangs. “I'll admit, you don't look as clueless or crazy as I thought. I'll take that as good news. Maybe there is a chance we all make it out of this richer than we started.” His lips curled into a smirk. Percival did not like that expression. 

John came in with a hearty meal. Sure, it was accompanied by scolding the kids, but it felt more like a family dinner than inn-fare. “So here's the deal:” Konrad leaned back after picking up a hot mug of coffee. He let the steam linger under his nose for a moment before drinking. “This buxom so-called goddess wants us to climb down there and save her scrawny ass, I get that. Any idea how long that'll take?” He leaned forward as he posed the question. 

“Minimum five years.” Percival started to say. 

“Minimum five years, good, you read the damn history books. Not even close, hot-shot.” He took another sip. “Nobody has even reached the City of Sin in over a decade, and the only clue we have of what lies underneath that damn Layer is your dreams.” He let the words linger on Percival’s mind. “Now don't get me wrong, I'm down for it. The kind of money we can pull from this job is worth it, provided we do it safe and do it right. But you do realize this is going to be the rest of your life, right? This ain't a quick job.”

“I am aware. The Goddess said as much.” Percival picks at his breakfast. 

“Good. Then let me lay it out for you.” He held up a finger. “We are not leaving the market without supplies for a whole month. The second layer is a jungle, literally. That means we need supplies. Which means we need coin, which means we need to do odd jobs up here.” He held up another finger. “I am not leaving the market without at least three other bodies. With you, that's two.”

“Verum said we would have two more.” Konrad clapped sarcastically. 

“Great, I don't see them. So they don't count. Which means I'm out. And even if I weren't…” he held up another finger, “Lastly, I'm not splitting the loot evenly. You need me as a guide to keep your head on your shoulders, so I expect no less than forty percent of the loot we get…beyond living expenses, of course.” Konrad leaned back again. His eyes were still sharp, still piercing. But no longer hostile. Just curious. 

“Deal.” Percival said, taking a bite. The food here wasn't bad. “We split it four ways then: a quarter for each of the others, forty for you, ten for me. And we have four, they are just on their way.” Konrad chuckled and shook his head. 

“Yeah, but who in their right mind would listen to-” the door opened again and a woman stepped through this time. Her face twitched, her posture was tense and her movements jerky. 

“You.” She said and approached. She didn't sit. “You look like the one I'm supposed to meet.” She turned to Konrad, sneered, then back to Percival. “Who do you need killed? Man, beast, monster…doesn't matter. But tell me -” she leaned in closer, “ - you do plan on saving that voice, goddess, whatever she is? For the wish?” Percival nodded, opening his mouth to speak. He didn't get the chance. “Good. I am Saigo Himawari, a Blue Lotus.” 

“Oi, slow the hell right down?! A Blue -” 

“The last Blue Lotus. If you know what that means, you should know how valuable my talents are.” While Konrad still struggled to keep up, Percival nodded. 

“She said as much. Are you willing to fight and die to see this through?”

“Are you?” She asked, leaning closer, her pale eyes peering through his armor, his body, his very soul.

“I am.” Percival said unflinchingly. There was a tense moment, and Saigo sat down, taking a deep breath. 

“... let's talk about something else.” She said. 

“Wait a damn minute, you can't just drop a bombshell like that and move on!” Konrad lamented, but his plea fell on deaf ears. Saigo stole a roll from his plate and chewed absently. 

“Now all that's left is the mage.” Percival said, closing his eyes to think. 

“Hm?” Konrad looked up. 

Saigo swallowed. “Mage, huh? Woman, kinda prissy looking? She supposed to have black hair - some sort of spirit tamer?”

“Yeah, that's about right. Why?” 

“Saw someone looking like that get nabbed by slavers off of Pit Street. Got her before she could call her beast. Figured it wasn't my problem.” Percival raised an eyebrow. Konrad shrugged. 

“Well she's good as gone. May as well count her out. Nobody would dare go to the Pit.” Percival put on his helmet. Saigo dipped her head in thanks for the meal and stood. Being completely outnumbered, Konrad groaned. “Fine, screw it. Have fun getting your fingers lopped off.” Konrad returns to his coffee. 

Saigo and Percival stepped outside. “She's this way, probably.” Saigo led the way. Percival remained close, his hand always near his sword. They walked down row after row of poorly designed houses, over bridges barely wide enough for a child, and over one too many holes that had been opened along the path. Saigo pointed to a ramshackle hut. “She’s in there.”

“How can you tell?”

“I can see through anything if I try hard enough.” Percival wasn't sure that was a joke. Saigo took a step forward, but a hand reached out and grabbed her by the collar of her robe. The hand tugged her back into his arms, Saigo squirmed and turned with a needle in her hand. Her pale eyes went wide with murderous intent. Just before Saigo impaled her assailant, a rock the size of a melon smashed onto the ground where Saigo had been standing not even a moment ago. A distant apology came from above where workers had dislodged a stone to make holes for light. 

“Damn, is this the thanks I get for saving you? I'll take it.” Konrad said with a grin. Saigo was pressed up against him, a poisoned needle just about piercing the skin. Konrad’s grin grew to a wide smile. She tilted her head and pressed the needle a little firmer.

“Enough, Saigo. Please.” Percival turned to Konrad. “...help us free her, and I'll give you the rest of the money in my purse.” Konrad shrugged, Saigo was still. 

“Fine.” He said. Saigo relented. He grumbled to Saigo, wiping away the drop of poison that had beaded on his throat. “They are only a small time gang, I think. The Market Master won't mind as long as we don't leave any survivors. Their boss is a monster, though.” Percival rolled his shoulders and drew his sword. 

No other exits to the house. Just two rooms. Percival kicked in the door, Saigo threw in a vial of mushroom spores. Toxic, yes, but diluted enough to not kill the slaves in the back room. Konrad took aim and took out two slavers before they could raise their weapons. A minotaur clad in armor shouted something and drew his greatsword. Konrad was right - literally a monster. The wall of metal and cold fury drove into the center of the room, clashing blades with Percival. Saigo slowly and methodically started killing.

Sword met shield, armor scrapped against wood, and Percival lost himself in the dance of death. Inhale, exhale. The blood pounding in his ears drowned out the nerves and the hiss of steel in motion calmed his soul. Konrad was correct - this slaver was much tougher than the bandits he had fought on the way here. A rust iron axe bit into his side, denting the metal and drawing blood. He parried the boss and swung at the assailant. He was knocked off balance, and Sagio delivered a quick jab with her sword. Death was near instant. 

Focusing against the pain, Percival slammed into the boss. The two of them went through the wall and into the back room. Konrad shot and the other slaver in that back room fell dead. Saigo was now engaged in single combat, where she did not excel. Percival used his shield to cave in the boss’ skull, then threw it at Saigo’s opponent. The distraction opened up his side, and Saigo delivered her poisoned needle to his guts. His death was less instant. 

Once the adrenaline cleared, the group gathered around a small cage. Kneeling inside was a beautiful woman in a pristine traveling gown. Her eyes were closed as if in meditation, and her spectral dragon coiled around her cage defensively. “Tis about time a rescue attempt was made. I do loathe playing the damsel in distress. But I must needs have tested your capabilities.” Neither of the trio were convinced. “You passed with flying colors. Now you may free me, and I may be on my way.”

Percival rolled his eyes, but with a kick the lock snapped and the woman was able to crawl out of her cell. “Well done, servant. I shall recommend you for promotion once I am crowned empress.” Konrad could not hold his laughter. 

The woman brushed some dust from her robe as her familiar spoke in a bellowing voice. “Hear my words and tremble. You stand before her Ladyship Yao Lóng Xuè, rightful heir to the throne of Xing!” Saigo narrows her eyes, her hand reaching for her sword. Lady Yao nods. “Indeed. My father, the last emperor, was deceived and betrayed by one he called a friend. As much as it pains me, twas a marvelous deception we never perceived until the usurper’s army was at our gates.” Saigo lowers her hand, relieved. 

“The Goddess said you would be willing to join us, your highness.” Percival said, wording it more like a question after hearing her talk. Lady Yao nodded. 

“Indeed. For my dearest wish requires her help.” Lady Yao smiled and cursied. “Please, just call me Lady Yao. I shall be in your care. Now, come - we have much to discuss do we not?”

Saigo and Lady Yao stepped out, talking to themselves about Xing. Konrad sighed and stepped up next to Percival. “Well…I guess I'm going with you guys, then. Someone has to keep her majesty alive.” Konrad says with a chuckle. “Well, let's get this thing done. The sooner we free the goddess, the sooner I can get out of this hell hole.” He clapped Percival on the back and followed the women outside. 

Percival looked down at his bleeding side and then down to his bloodsoaked sword. Five years of this, potentially every day. It filled him with dread. And yet, it also set his heart ablaze. The adventure of a lifetime...no, the adventure of legends. How glorious, he thought, to fight and die for this cause!

The Goddess Verum’s words echoed again in his heart as he followed his companions back to John Strong’s inn. 

“Hail to you, Dreamer. Be not afraid. Listen well as I speak the words you must hear more than any other.”

“Reach the bottom.”
“Set me free.”
“And I shall grant you One Wish.""

Remember those days when you're just scraping by, eating instant ramen for the fifth time that week, and dreaming of something more? Yeah, that was pretty much my life a few years ago. I was stuck in a soul-crushing corporate job, staring at spreadsheets until my eyes blurred, and feeling like I was just watching my life pass by.

The idea for my little e-commerce store, selling custom-designed nerdy t-shirts, actually sparked during one of those particularly mind-numbing meetings. I was doodling aliens fighting dinosaurs on a sticky note and thought, ""Hey, someone would totally buy this!"" The initial fear was HUGE. Like, what if I fail? What if people laugh? But the thought of staying in that cubicle forever was even scarier. So, I took the plunge, spent my evenings and weekends teaching myself everything from Photoshop to Shopify, fueled by lukewarm coffee and an irrational belief in dinosaur-fighting aliens.

Those first few months were brutal. I was juggling my 9-to-5, barely sleeping, and shipping orders from my tiny apartment living room. There were so many moments I wanted to just throw in the towel. I remember one night, a massive printer jam turned my entire desk into an inky battlefield, and I just sat there, covered in black ink, wondering if I was completely insane. But then, a customer left a review saying my shirt made their day, and it was like a shot of pure adrenaline straight to the heart. Those little victories kept me going.

Slowly but surely, things started to click. I learned from every mistake, embraced the feedback, and found my niche. The joy of seeing my designs out in the wild, knowing someone loved them enough to wear them, was incredible. It wasn't overnight success by any means – it was a slow, agonizing climb – but seeing my passion project grow into something real, something that now allows me to wake up excited to work, is the most rewarding feeling ever.

Now, I'm still working hard, but it's on *my* terms, building something I genuinely love. It's not always easy, and there are still plenty of challenges, but the freedom and the sense of accomplishment are unparalleled. So, if you're out there, dreaming of starting something but paralyzed by fear, just remember that ramen noodles eventually lead to better things. Sometimes, you just gotta jump.

Nothing extreme, just practical stuff that’s helped me in past storms *(fwiw I grew up in the midwest lol)*

[FOR UNHOUSED NEIGHBORS: click here for a list of current participating Warming Centers.](https://knoxtnhousing.org/warming-centers.html)

**The basics (do what you can throughout week to prepare):**  
• Fill water bottles, pitchers, jugs, jars, even stock pots.  
When/if the storm hits, fill bathtub (for toilet flushing), set aside pet water, you can also freeze water bottles halfway for insulating fridge and for future drinking water.

• Gather hats, socks, scarves

• Pick one “warm room” and close off the rest.  
Lay down **rugs, towels, or cardboard** on cold floors.  
Hang **blankets or towels over drafty doors/windows** to trap heat

• Charge phones, battery packs, and flashlights *now.*  
*charge old phones to use for flash lights! keep one phone on low power mode/off unless needed.*

If you must use candles:

* Keep them **away from curtains**
* Put them on **plates or in jars**
* Never leave unattended

• Eat fridge perishables first; don’t open the fridge much if power goes out. Put dairy/meat **outside in a sealed cooler** *only if temps stay below 40°F*

**Assume you won’t drive, however: make sure car has gas** ***before snow starts***\*\*!\*\*

**Food ideas to have stocked:**  
• Canned soup/chili/tuna/tinned fish/sardines/spam/corn beef hash  
• Beans, lentils, rice, oatmeal (white rice cooks the fastest, stock up on instant oatmeal instead of rolled oats etc)  
• Crackers, tortillas, tortilla chips, peanut butter  
• Herbal Tea(ginger is warming), coffee, broth cubes, instant miso soup  
• Honey, salt, sugar

**Let faucets drip (hot + cold)**

* Know where your **main water shutoff** is!!
* **If pipes freeze:**
   * Turn off water.
   * Open **cabinet doors** under sinks.
   * Open faucets.

**Download or screenshot:**

* Emergency phone numbers
* Maps
* Weather alerts

**Additional things to arrange:**

* Baby wipes (no-water hygiene)
* Medications (refill early if possible)
* Books, journals, games (mental health matters)
* If it’s safe, check in on neighbors before the storm: especially elders/mobility limited/folks living alone/those with pets

This is my first time reviewing a property here, but I haven’t seen any others review it and it has mixed  (and a lot of poor) reviews other places, so I thought this would be helpful. 

We just spent two nights here after staying three nights at another property in the DR (that part was planned).  2 adults traveling, no children.

Highlights 

The property is beautifully designed and feels unique and special compared to a lot of resort properties. Beautiful Palm trees, well manicured spaces.

The water and the ocean views are spectacular and feels like you are in Hawaii. We did not go in the ocean but there were some people swimming. 

The Cap Cana area itself is very nice and I wish I had done more research as we stayed more in Punta Cana the first part of the trim and it was remarkably different. 

We were in a standard room, no upgrades were available and it was fantastic. Huge bathrooms nice layout with bathtub and shower and a patio overlooking the rooftop pool which never had anyone at it. 

Our butlers were lovely and over all I thought the service in regards to staff friendliness and accommodations was good. Speed of service was an issue. See below. 

The food is very good and I was pleasantly surprised with the prices. ($15-17 for lunch sandwiches), $20 fish tacos) 

The rooftop bar has an incredible view and was very quiet, this is where they do the champagne sabering weather permitting. I made a comment to the staff that I loved Perrier Jouet champagne (which is not what they use to Saber at some other SR Properties I have been to) and they sent a bottle to my room! 

Lows 

While the servers were lovely and accommodating, the actual service itself is very slow. The server at our first beach side lunch apologized for the slow service and our breakfast room service this morning took over an hour which they comped without us asking due to how long it took.  The second morning we ordered the same breakfast and it took 40 minutes and they forgot the coffee this time and it took another twenty minutes for them to bring coffee. 

Just something to be prepared for. 

Butler responses and time getting items was also slower than expected but they worked hard to make things right. 

There were a lot of children here and the adult pool does not have many chairs at all and it overlooks the family pool so it is not exactly the most relaxing. I ended up spending most time on the rooftop pool which felt like an adult pool, or on the loungers on the 5th floor overlooking the water. 

Overall this property is priced very reasonably right now  for a St Regis, having just opened in May so despite service issues, I  would come back if the rates stayed the same. I would not pay 2k a nice. ",16,1769014204.0,chubbytravel,2,0.94,False

When it comes to maintaining health, especially as we age, our focus expands beyond just diet and exercise. One area many men overlook is prostate health. Prostate supplements are gaining popularity, and for a good reason. They can play a vital role in supporting the health of the prostate, which is critical for overall well-being. 

## What are Prostate Supplements?

Prostate supplements are specialized nutritional products formulated to support prostate health. These supplements often combine various ingredients thought to benefit prostate function, including vitamins, minerals, and herbal extracts.

### Key Ingredients to Look For

When considering a prostate supplement, it’s essential to pay attention to the ingredients. Here are some beneficial components commonly found in these products:

- **Saw Palmetto**: Known for its use in traditional medicine, this extract may help reduce symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
- **Beta-Sitosterol**: This plant sterol may improve urinary flow and reduce the need to urinate at night.
- **Zinc**: An essential mineral that supports immune health and plays a role in prostate function.
- **Lycopene**: Found in tomatoes, this antioxidant may help protect prostate cells from damage.

Finding a prostate supplement that contains these ingredients can help support your prostate health as you age. [Click for Details!](https://l.sytixo.com/7jSaLJ)

## Why Consider Prostate Supplements?

### Reducing Symptoms

Many men experience symptoms related to prostate health, particularly those over the age of 50. A prostate supplement could help alleviate symptoms such as:

- Frequent urination
- Weak urination flow
- Difficulty starting or stopping urination
- Persistent urge to urinate

Taking a prostate supplement might provide some much-needed relief.

### Supporting Overall Health

Prostate supplements don’t just focus on the prostate. Many of the nutrients found in these formulas also contribute to overall health. Better prostate health often means improved quality of life, including:

- Better sleep
- Enhanced energy levels
- Improved emotional well-being

Investing in a prostate supplement could lead to noticeable improvements in how you feel daily. 

## Choosing the Right Prostate Supplement

When shopping for a prostate supplement, it can be a bit overwhelming due to the wide variety available. Here are some tips to help you choose the right one:

### Do Your Research

Look for products that:

- Have clinically studied ingredients
- Are manufactured by reputable companies
- Provide transparency in their ingredient sourcing and labeling

### Read Reviews

Customer feedback can be a powerful tool. Look for reviews from other users who have experienced similar health concerns. Their insights can help guide your choice.

### Consult with a Professional

Before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have underlying health conditions, it’s always a good idea to consult a healthcare provider. They can help identify the right prostate supplement for your individual needs.

## Integrating Prostate Supplements into Your Routine

Taking a prostate supplement can easily fit into your daily routine. Here are some helpful tips:

### Set a Schedule

Consistent timing can help you remember to take your supplement. Consider:

- Taking it at the same time each day
- Adding it to your morning routine with breakfast or coffee

### Pair with a Healthy Lifestyle

A prostate supplement works best as part of a well-rounded approach to health. Incorporate:

- **Balanced Diet**: Focus on whole foods, healthy fats, and plenty of fruits and vegetables.
- **Regular Exercise**: Aim for at least 30 minutes most days of the week.
- **Stress Management**: Practice mindfulness, meditation, or breathing exercises to reduce stress.

Taking a proactive approach can yield the best results regarding your prostate health. 

## Conclusion: Take Action for Your Prostate Health

Prostate health is crucial for overall well-being, and finding the right prostate supplement can help you feel your best as you age. With the right combination of research and lifestyle changes, you can take confident steps towards better health.

1qj2ys9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisagreeMythoughts/comments/1qj2ys9/dmt_our_comfort_relies_on_invisible_sacrifices/,DMT: Our Comfort Relies on Invisible Sacrifices,"I’ve been thinking a lot about why some places feel almost unreal in their stability and comfort. Northern Europe is one example. Healthcare works, streets are clean, people have time for hobbies. It’s easy to look at it and think, “Why can’t everywhere be like this?”

But then I realized something. That kind of comfort doesn’t exist in isolation. The things that make life there easy, like affordable goods, imported coffee, and cheap electronics, come from somewhere else. Often it’s from places where people work in conditions most of us would never accept and get paid far less than a living wage. Our convenience depends on theirs being limited.

It’s not just labor either. It’s resources, trade deals, and even climate impacts. Countries that contributed least to industrialization and carbon emissions are the ones most affected by floods, droughts, and crop failures. When these conditions force migration, the reaction is often walls and regulations rather than reflection on the causes.

If the goal were truly global equality, our daily lives would have to look very different. Smaller homes, higher prices, fewer flights, fewer cheap products. Real adjustments, not just rhetoric. The system is not broken. It is functioning exactly as it was designed, concentrating comfort and opportunity in certain places while limiting it elsewhere.

It raises a hard question for me. If we are comfortable because others are constrained and the system is set up to maintain that imbalance, what would it take to rethink our assumptions about progress and fairness without simply shifting the burden somewhere else?",1,1769013813.0,DisagreeMythoughts,1,1.0,False

¡Hola! Soy director y guionista de Estados Unidos (Los Ángeles). Actualmente estoy trabajando intensamente en una película que tiene lugar en Guatemala, con un enfoque en la comunidad maya. Es una obra de ficción, pero basada en el realismo histórico.

Tengo mucho amor por la gente y la cultura de su país, y soy muy consciente de que la historia que busco contar no me pertenece a mí. He vivido y trabajado en Guatemala: enseñé inglés en Escuintla y Palín, impartí talleres artísticos por niños en Jaibalito, recorrí el país extensamente, y me enamoré de la obra de Miguel Ángel Asturias y del cine de Jayro Bustamante.

Solo quiero embarcarme en este proyecto si puedo hacerlo mano a mano con la comunidad. Quiero que guatemaltecos y pueblos mayas sientan un verdadero sentido de autoría sobre la historia. Mi intención es reunir los recursos que tengo disponibles para crear esta película con elenco local, equipo local, productores locales, y siempre teniendo en cuenta los intereses de la comunidad. No intento hacer otro *Apocalypto* — creo que podemos construir un equipo de cineastas apasionados, jóvenes y hambrientos que cuenten una historia capaz de sacudir al mundo.

No se requiere experiencia formal en realización cinematográfica (aunque si la tienes, ¡genial!), solo pasión por el buen cine y la narración de historias, y una actitud positiva.

Estoy en Guatemala por tiempo limitado, hasta el 26 de enero. Quiero organizar una reunión en Antigua este domingo para todos los que puedan asistir. Invitaré el almuerzo y el café a quienes puedan viajar. Entiendo que no es posible para todos, así que no se desanimen si no pueden venir. Si no pueden asistir, envíenme un mensaje y agendaremos una llamada para hablar sobre cómo pueden participar.

Así que, puedan venir o no, envíenme un mensaje aquí en Reddit si están interesados y continuaremos la conversación por WhatsApp. Allí les compartiré más detalles de la historia, ustedes podrán contarme sobre sus habilidades y lo que esperan aportar al proyecto, y seguimos desde ahí.

Y por cierto: mi español es decente, pero lejos de ser perfecto. Aun así, hablar inglés NO es un requisito. Encontraremos nuestra propia manera de comunicarnos.

Un saludo afectuoso a su hermoso país.

English:

Calling all Guatemalans interested in filmmaking!

Hello! I'm a director and screenwriter from the United States (Los Angeles). I'm currently working intensely on a film set in Guatemala, focusing on the Mayan community. It's a work of fiction, but grounded in historical realism.

I have a deep love for the people and culture of your country, and I'm very aware that the story I want to tell doesn't belong to me. I've lived and worked in Guatemala: I taught English in Escuintla and Palín, led art workshops for children in Jaibalito, traveled extensively throughout the country, and fell in love with the work of Miguel Ángel Asturias and the films of Jayro Bustamante.

I only want to embark on this project if I can do it hand in hand with the community. I want Guatemalans and Mayan people to feel a true sense of ownership over the story. My intention is to gather the resources I have available to create this film with a local cast, crew, and producers, always keeping the community's interests in mind. I'm not trying to make another Apocalypto—I believe we can build a team of passionate, young, and hungry filmmakers who can tell a story capable of shaking the world.

No formal filmmaking experience is required (though if you have it, great!), just a passion for good cinema and storytelling, and a positive attitude.

I'm in Guatemala for a limited time, until January 26th. I want to host a meet-up in Antigua this Sunday for anyone who can attend. I'll provide lunch and coffee for those who can travel. I understand that this isn't possible for everyone, so please don't be discouraged if you can't make it. If you can't attend, send me a message and we'll schedule a call to discuss how you can participate.

So, whether you can make it or not, send me a message here on Reddit if you're interested, and we'll continue the conversation on WhatsApp. There I'll share more details about the story, you can tell me about your skills and what you hope to contribute to the project, and we'll continue from there.

And by the way: my Spanish is decent, but far from perfect. Even so, speaking English is NOT a requirement. We'll find our own way to communicate.

Warm regards to your beautiful country.",1,1769013676.0,Filmmakers,0,1.0,False
1qj2wil,https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3651132652,Regulation Boardgame (fan made) on Tabletop simulator,"This is my fanart boardgame of the Regulation Podcast. Full of as much references as I can fit while still keeping the game balanced. I'm going to be continuously updating this for gameplay balance. I'll be adding relevant pictures to the playing cards and even putting tiny timestamps and episode numbers down the bottom of the cards for their content origins. I'd love to hear suggestions and gameplay stories and I hope the guys enjoy this, although Eric won't (he hates board games lol). I'm also going to repost the rules here, (they will also be getting fine tuned periodically).

INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the fan made regulation board game. 

It is 2 to 5 players. The board is sectioned off into 

5 parts in the shape of the regulation butt hole. There is Andrews room, Goofworld, The graveyard,

The real world and The office. Then at the center of the regulation (fan made) boardgame is Deputy.

The aim of the game is to claim the most achievements (aka victory points) until an 'End game' card 

is drawn and the objectives on said card are completed. Players can move freely around the board in 

any direction with the exception of Goofworld because there is no reverse parking and travel to 

Andrews bedroom is problematic until Andrews door is found.



THE BASICS

Move freely across the board (except entering Andrews room until Andrews door card is drawn from the deck). Have the most achievements at the end of the game after an End game card has been drawn and completed.



SETUP

Pull up these 2 wheels

[https://spinthewheel.app/qkULIbq686](https://spinthewheel.app/qkULIbq686)

[https://spinthewheel.app/qXGc6cl1M8](https://spinthewheel.app/qXGc6cl1M8)



THE DECK

As an important part of balancing the game there are 2 decks to draw from. Simply labeled Deck 1 and 

Deck 2. Players will draw cards when required from Deck 1, once that is out. Players start drawing 

from Deck 2 when required. Should Deck 2 ever run out, shuffle the discard pile and make a new deck 

from that. This new deck will most certainly consist of cards from Deck 1 and 2. Every time this new

 combined deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile and make a new deck from that. There is no hand limit

 in this game. You can end up with as many cards in your hand as you need.



GENERAL USE CARDS

These are cards that do various things. Only one can be played per player, per turn.



ACHIEVEMENT  CARDS

These are cards used to claim achievements or 'victory points'. These cards have specific locations they have

To be claimed at. You must end your turn by choice or run out of movement on these specific locations and 

Place the card from your hand faceup in front of you. For Example: A player must end their turn on the Deputy

Space to claim the Red Boots Achievement card from their hand. Only 1 achievement card can be claimed per

Person per turn. A player can use a general use card and claim an achievement in the same turn. Only 1 each 

Though. 



END GAME CARDS

When the first end game card is drawn from the deck it is immediately placed faceup on the board for all to see.

This card will have a series of instructions to be completed to end the game. Any player can complete these or 

multiple players can work together to complete these. When a player draws a new end game card they have a choice

to make discard the new end game card or replace the old and discard that one. Only one end game card can be on

the board at a time. Any progress towards an end game card stays active even if the end game card gets discarded.

Say the end game goal is to reveal the key item cards 'the pencil' and 'the pencil judge' in Andrews room and 'the 

pencil' has been revealed, then the end game card is discarded. 'The pencil' stays on the board in case a player 

gets a card to dig through the discard pile or the deck runs out and the discard pile is shuffled to make a new

deck and that end game card comes back into play. Only the pencil judge card would be left to reveal to end the 

game. The only exception to this rule would be the a graveyard bingo endgame card. They consist of any player

finishing their turn on specific graveyard locations or multiple players doing this together. 



KEY ITEM CARDS

These are item cards that are used in conjunction with end game cards. Each key item card belongs to a specific

end game card and cannot be used/revealed unless the matching end game card is the current one. If you have a key

item required for the current end game card, you don't have to use it if you wanted to get more achievements. But if 

players find out you have it in your hand they may try to steal it off you.



PROBLEM CARDS

When a problem card is drawn it takes effect immediately and is placed faceup in front of you. Each card should have

clear instructions on the problem they cause you and how to get rid of it. An alternate way to get rid of a problem 

card is to land on another player during or at the end of your movement phase. The only exception to this is the 

'Followed by a cranberries song' problem card. Which is also stated on the card. That card consists of you constantly

being moved to other players and therefore cannot pass it on by landing on other players.



ALIA CARDS

An alias is a card with an ability you can use during your turn. Drawn from the deck, these cards go in your hand but

can be played at the start of your turn to use the cards ability during that turn. Only one Alias card can be played

per turn. An Alias card can be played at the start of your turn to use its ability during that turn then gets returned

to your hand at the end of your turn. As such they can be stolen from your hand.



STEALING AND TRADING

Any players you land on during your movement or end your turn on you can steal or trade with. 

When stealing from a player you blindly grab 1 card from their hand or 1 currency card. You do not get to 

know what you're taking from another player beforehand unless you have a card that allows you to see.

When trading with players you and any players on the same space can show each other any cards, currency

or half cars you're willing to trade. All players involved must agree to the trade to go forward with it. You 

can trade as much or as little as each player involved is willing to trade.



MAJOR LEAGUE FAN JACK SCALE

The major league fan Jack scale is a scale on the corner of the board. Going from super fan Jack up to major league fan Jack. 

When players roll a 1 it goes down, when players roll a 6 it goes up. The only real point of the Jack scale is an End game

card that requires the scale to be at the top to end the game.



THE WHEEL

The wheel is used to determine if players will pick up currency or draw a card or in the rare case get 

Nothing at the end of their turn. The player to go first spins the wheel before their turn. This will 

determine what players will receive At the end of their turn if they moved. If 'go to second wheel' 

comes up and is followed by 'half car' Every player will roll the die and the highest roll gets a half car 

token. If multiple players roll the highest, Those players then roll off until one player is the winner. 

On 'half car' players will receive nothing after moving that round. After each player has had or missed their turn the 

first player will spin the wheel again to determine what players will receive this round after their turn if they moved.

If the Wheel website isn't working at these to each 

wheel.

WHEEL 1

\+1 card at the end of your turn

\+1 currency at the end of your turn

\+1 card at the end of your turn

Go to second wheel

WHEEL 2

\+2 cards at the end of your turn

\+2 currency at the end of your turn

\+1 half car at the end of your turn

Return to 1st wheel



PLAYER TURN

First pick an alias (if you have any in your hand and) if you want to use one. 

From this point on you can use general use cards from your hand. You can only use one general

Use card per turn. Roll for movement. If the roll is a 1 move the fan Jack scale down unless its at the 

Bottom. If the roll is a 6 move the fan Jack scale up unless its at the top. Add or subtract anything from

The movement roll based on any general use, problem or alias cards in play. You can move up to as many

Spaces as your movement roll. Any players you land on during your movement or end your turn on you

Can steal or trade with. You can move then trade/steal with a player and continue to move then trade/steal etc 

until you've run out of movement. When you run out of movement or decide to end your turn, leave your player piece. 

Now is the time you can claim an achievement. You can only claim one achievement per turn. Now you're done moving

You can reveal any key item cards for the current end game card for this location from your hand. If you've played an 

alias card return it to your hand. Lastly draw a card or currency based on this rounds wheel spin and pass the die.



CURRENCY

There are four types of currency. Hot dogs, hamburgers, fedoras and vinyls. Some types are only accepted at certain

places, other places accept all currency. The player with the most hot dog currency at the end of the game and the 

player with the most hamburger currency at the end of the game both get more achievements. 



IMPORTANT LOCATIONS

Airport

When you land on the airport space during or at the end of your movement phase you may return three currency of any

type or combination of types to move your player piece to anywhere on the board. If you have any movement left you 

can continue on from this new location.



The mall

It's back. When players land here in the middle or the end of their movement phase they can return 3 vinyl currency

in exchange for 1 achievement. There is no limit to how many achievements a player can get during their turn. If they

have 9 vinyls they could get 3 achievements in the same turn.



Mr Fedora Mustaches archives 

When players land here in the middle or the end of their movement phase they can return 3 fedora currency in exchange 

for 1 achievement. There is no limit to how many achievements a player can get during their turn. If they have 6 fedoras 

they could get 2 achievements in the same turn.



Erics no reverse parking zone

Goof world is a one way section of the map, starting with Erics no reverse parking zone all the way ending at the 

Gurning Stadium. The board is clearly marked.



Andrews door

Until 'Andrews door card' is found the 'Andrews door space' is one way. Exit only. Movement between Pillow Mountain and 

Andrews door and Keurig coffee table and Andrews door are always both ways. However until the 'Andrews door card' is 

drawn from the deck, movement from players can only go from the 'Andrews door space' to 'Resting place of the gentle 

ghost' or 'Deputy' or 'Erics no reverse parking zone space'. But not 'Resting place of the gentle ghost' to 'Andrews door' or

'Deputy' to 'Andrews door' or 'Erics no reverse parking zone' to 'Andrews door'. Once the 'Andrews door card' is found in the 

deck movement from the 'Andrews door space' becomes two ways. Until then there are several cards that allow players to

transport or players can use the airport space.



ENDING THE GAME

When a player or players complete the current end game card objectives the game ends immediately. If a player has the

Episode 196 card in their hand, add 5 achievements to their final score. If a player has all 6 Andrews body cards in 

their hand add 10 achievements to their final score. If a player has the most hot dog currency add 3 achievements to 

their final score. If two players have the most then neither players get any extra achievements. If a player has the 

most hamburger currency add 3 achievements to their final score. If two players have the most then neither players get 

any extra achievements. Do not count any achievements players have in their hand, only ones from the required locations

they've claimed that are sitting in front of them. For every 2 half cars a player has on them add 1 achievement to their 

final score. If a player has the Nicks monkey mask card in their inventory at the end of the game they place it facedown 

in front of them and angled to either have the mask on or off as shown on the card. All other players must come up with a 

single vote on if the mask is on or off. If the decision from the players is correct all but the player with the monkey mask 

card get 1 extra achievement to their final score. If the group decision is wrong the player with Nicks monkey mask card gets 2 

achievements added to their final score. Count up every players achievements and the player with the highest score wins. If a 

player has the Extra medium card in their hand and they have at least one player with more achievements and at least one players 

with less achievements then them, they also win.",26,1769013675.0,theregulationpod,1,0.94,False

However, today I caught it too late. I took a migril at 8h30am and then the second one at 11h30am. Now, migril generally makes me very nauseas when it kicks in - today was no exception.

But then after the second one kicked in, I got a panic attack. Hot flushes, trembling, nausea, intense fear of dying, chest pain, felt as if my pupils dilated and I was going to faint.  I went to my roomies room and she helped me do some breathing excersize and take Rescue drops.

Most people planning a Puerto Rico trip don’t even realize Aguadilla has its own airport and that’s a mistake.

Rafael Hernández Airport (BQN) is small, efficient, and one of the easiest airports to fly into in the Caribbean.

In fact, BQN has one of the longest runways in the Caribbean, originally built for military use which means handling flights here is rarely an issue.

Why flying into BQN is a breeze (literally)

You land, walk down the stairs, and you’re outside, no long corridors

Only one baggage carousel, servicing one flight at a time
→ very low chances of luggage confusion

It’s impossible to get lost, the airport is that straightforward

TSA lines are typically short and calm

Rental car counters are steps away from baggage claim

Drop-off and pick-up are directly outside the terminal

What you’ll find inside BQN

3–4 airline check-in counters

A small bar with snacks

Cafeteria and coffee spot nearby

Rental car desks inside the terminal

Everything within a 2–3 minute walk

No shuttle trains. No maze. No stress.

Airlines that fly to BQN (direct routes vary by season)

Depending on the time of year, direct flights to Aguadilla (BQN) are commonly offered by:

United Airlines (often from Newark seasonal)

JetBlue (often from Florida frequency varies by season)

Spirit Airlines (select routes)

Frontier/Spirit Airlines (from Florida)


Who BQN is best for?

-Travelers heading to Aguadilla, Isabela, Rincón, or the west coast

-Families who want an easy arrival

-Anyone who hates crowded airports

-Travelers renting a car and leaving immediately

If you’re staying on the west coast, flying into BQN saves time, stress, and patience compared to San Juan.

If you’ve flown into BQN before or you’re considering it
