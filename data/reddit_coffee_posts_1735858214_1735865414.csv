So I was starting to get suspicious. Then out of the blue today he accused me of spitting in his sandwich. 


It really terrified me because they always say that a narcissists accusations are really a confession.

It is at the point I went around the kitchen area today looking for things he could be putting in my drinks. 

I’m sure I’m just being paranoid but the fact he said that to me has me even more worried.

I’ve had some stomach pains that I need to get checked out but I’m pretty certain that’s unrelated. Hopefully.

One thing that helped me focus with my job and get me through the day was vaping, I felt more focused and concentrated and enjoyed the feeling.

I quit vaping two weeks ago and feel absolutely lost every day without it. I can’t focus with work, and it feels like something’s missing everyday.

At first I thought it was lack of sleep, but it’s not that.

Thought maybe it’s lack of caffeine so I drank coffee some days and energy drinks another, it’s not that.

Lastly, I went and got a 0mg menthol vape for a good throat hit, and even that is doing nothing for me.

I didn’t realize how dependent I was on the nicotine buzz to keep me focused and through the day, and can’t seem to find anything that replicates it.

Following is an auto-translated version of it that may not be 100% accurate, so please, critique based on content and not use of language. As soon as I have time, I'll translate it myself to ensure it's as accurate to the original as possible, but before doing so, I'd appreciate hearing your feedback on the story.

The Mirror

Every morning starts with the same alarm clock song. That same annoying tune, which has grown old over time and has been distorted by repetition. Every day I want to change that song, to replace it. But something inside me won't allow it, as if this melody that so torments me will hurt and misunderstand me. Maybe it's that scary force of habit that keeps me in bondage to something I hate simply because that's the way it's always been.
Habit. Strange thing when you think about it. ""Action which by frequent repetition has somehow become formalized so that, though we perform it deliberately, it does not particularly occupy our thoughts or require any effort."" Sounds like brainwashing, doesn't it? The mind is manipulated in such a way that sooner or later it takes a certain behaviour or mindset for granted. The only difference is that the habit is brainwashing that we alone - usually - practice on ourselves.
So, because of a habit I am unhappy. A habit that I myself decided to have. I alone convinced my mind that I need. And no, of course I'm not talking about that same song that plays every time the clock strikes 6, no matter how tiresome my need to listen to it has become. The truth is, I've gotten used to an idea. An idea that God knows why it still exists. Her. She's to blame for everything. She with her blonde curls, her lovely greenish eyes. The one who, when I first saw her, bathed in moonlight, seemed to shine brighter than any star. She.
And then me. Me the coward. Me who never became a man. Me who would rather play with dolls than little soldiers. Me who couldn't help but panic at the mere idea of talking to a woman, let alone a woman like her. How could I talk to someone like that? So I was left with the desire. It was the itch I couldn't scratch. A thirst I couldn't satisfy except with her caress. I wanted her to see me, to know who I was. Was that so much to ask?
The days went by, I didn't forget. I didn't forget that sweet yet bitter evening when I saw her in the park for the first time. It was just another one of those days. Trying to get my thoughts in order, I used to leave the house and walk in the hope that each step would bring me closer to the end of my reflections. Often I would come to conclusions I had reached long before, but I was used to pretending that I liked to think while I walked. Perhaps I needed that more dramatic tone to my musings to make my problems seem more important. Another one of my meaningless habits.
While walking, I tended to stop at any point that caught my attention enough to inspire thoughts. Old buildings, churches, benches and fountains in parks became my places of contemplation. That day, I had chosen the park and I'm not sure if I'm glad or sorry I did.
That's where I saw her. She was shining under the full moon. The silver of the moon bathed her hair, and it was as if the night had given her the light of every star in the sky as her eyes sparkled. The reddest rose could not compare with her lips. The most beautiful work of art could not touch the perfection of her smile. In that moment, the earth could open up and swallow everything around her. I wouldn't realize it until she was gone too.
I had goose bumps. For the first time I felt so worthless, so vulnerable just at the sight of a girl. I had to talk to her. I had to do something. But what? How? I wasn't too much of a stranger and it was only a vision I happened to be lucky enough to face. It's amazing how I could spend an entire day immersed in a sea of thoughts, and yet, in front of her, my mind went blank. I was paralyzed in my seat, unable to move the slightest muscle. ""Fuck her,"" I thought. ""Do something.""
I didn't.
The road home was short, but every moment away seemed like an eternity. night, my usual grim and dark nightmares gave way to sweet dreams. Or I like to think. When I woke up I couldn't remember what I might have seen this time but I assumed something good. On the other hand, I didn't remember what I saw the other times either, but I always assumed something bad. Who knows?
From that night on, I kept looking for excuses to pass by the park in the hope of seeing her again. And indeed, I succeeded several times. But not once did I find the courage to speak. As the days went by, the walks in the park became a habit, and with them the idea of her became a habit. Just the idea of seeing her was enough to fill me up.
Over time, however, I began to feel resentment. Unfulfilled desire. Everywhere I looked I saw her. I wished she would appear before me. I couldn't work anymore. I couldn't concentrate. I needed her. And the idea of her wasn't enough.
I used to like to look at myself in the mirror and think. Sometimes I would think that something was wrong, that things weren't the way I wanted them to be. That's when I saw in my reflection what I wanted to be. Other times I felt pride in even my smallest accomplishments. It was then that I saw more than I could ever be. But there were also times when I didn't know what to think. Who am I? What am I doing here? What meaning is there? That's when I couldn't see anything. A blurry void where my face should have been. Or at least my mask. But even the void was something real.
All of this was the only thing unstable enough in my daily life that it didn't become a robotic thing like everything else. My thoughts. It wasn't something I typically did. And they were never the same thoughts every time.
It took a woman to change that too. By now, every look I gave the mirror ended in melancholy. Melancholy for what I wanted so badly and couldn't claim. Melancholy because the mirror reminded me of it. Melancholy because even my reflection was her. A person I had come to know so well, and yet I didn't know her at all.
The thought crossed my mind that I had become obsessed. I make no secret of the fact that I shuddered at the possibility. It would have been unnatural to have developed an obsession with someone I'd never really met. No, it couldn't be that. Obsessives are crazy. Psychos. I couldn't be obsessed. It was something else. Something like... Habit. Yeah, that's it. Habit. That's all it could be. I wasn't obsessed, I just had another habit.
Like any habit of mine, however, it became torturous over time. Every day, every hour, every minute, the same thoughts, the same images. The passage of time made me dislike this habit that was so annoying to me. I hated waking up and thinking about it every morning. I hated looking in the mirror and seeing her beautiful face. But most of all, I hated her. I hated her for the brainwashing she made me do to myself. For the need she created in me. My constant need to see her. My annoying need to see her. My awful need to see her.
The mirror became my own personal torture chamber. Every time I saw her through it, only one thought would cross my mind: ""Break it."" But I hesitated. I couldn't hurt her. Not even to her image. I was too fragile. Only the idea of destruction, the idea of violence frightened me. And yet, she managed to throw me out of myself. She trapped me in a vicious circle. The more I lost myself because of her, the more I hated her, and the more I hated her, the more I tore at my old skin. The more I lost my old self. The more violent thoughts I had.
One day, on the way home from work, my car hit a pothole in the road. I got out to see if there was any damage. Luckily, the car was fine. But I noticed the pothole. Water had collected in it. It had been raining this morning, so it was logical that it hadn't dried out yet. It wasn't the water that caught my attention. It was my reflection in it. Because it wasn't mine. I couldn't resist. I stepped on it furiously. Until the water was gone, until it was mud, so blurry that its image was no longer visible. Passers-by were astonished. I didn't care. It was enough for me to get rid of her.
At home, the first thing I did was to get rid of the dirt I picked up by stepping in the mud. Washing my face I made the mistake of looking in the mirror. There it is again. No matter how much I washed, her face wouldn't leave mine. I started scratching my face with my fingernails. To get her off me. Get her out of my mind forever. I was covered in wounds. Wounds that burned. But they burned well. Almost satisfactorily. My fingernails were covered in blood. My blood. Blood I took from myself. But in the mirror it wasn't me. It was her. In her hands was my blood. How dare she?
""Break it!""
There was no other solution. I tried to smother her through the mirror. I started beating her. More. More. In a twisted way, for the first time in days I felt good. I felt euphoric. I realized how much the shards of glass in my fists hurt only after the entire mirror had shattered. Only after every part of her image was gone, leaving only shards behind.
I looked at the floor and the walls. Everything was covered in red splashes. One for each bump on the mirror. I watched my blood reflect from shard to shard. I couldn't keep the smile from my lips. Blood. Blood where once there was only her. My blood, though. How dare she take my blood? How dare she do this to me? I couldn't leave it like that. It was then that I made the fateful decision to take another walk in the park.
I waited for some time on a bench near where he usually passed by. I waited. And I waited. And before I knew it, the night had covered the day with its black veil. I was cold. I was tired. I kept waiting, though. Eventually it would pass. Usually by this time I'd be home, but not today. Today I had to insist.
I observed the space around me. Like my house, the alleys in the park were filled with red splashes. I looked at my hands under a lamp. Every piece of glass stuck to my fingers reflected its light. But it wasn't white light. The blood on the shards of the mirror had given it a dark red tinge. Red gloomy light burst across the street here and there in a way that looked bloody, as if some hideous crime had just taken place. A crime. And the blood was mine. How dare he?
Several hours passed. The clock had struck midnight. But I held my ground. Alone. There wasn't a soul around. People were moving away at the sight of the bloody street. And the image of a man motionless for hours with his hands covered in blood, slowly dripping on the bench, his face disfigured by his wounds certainly didn't help. I had unwittingly created a truly terrifying scene for a mere passerby. Her. It was her fault. She made them all afraid of me. How dare she?
Then I saw her. She must have been coming back from some night out. I could tell by her clothes. She was stunning. Even more so than usual. Her smile was more intense, her eyes brighter. She was perfect.
I stayed watching her for several minutes. My gaze was glued to her as she got closer and closer to my bench. But she wasn't afraid. She wasn't walking away like the others. She was getting closer. Those who say the killer always returns to the scene of the crime are right. Why should he be afraid? She had caused it. She had painted the street with my blood. I could see the pride in her eyes for her crime. I could feel the satisfaction she felt for the harm she had caused me. How dare she?
""I'm sorry, are you okay?""
I was so engrossed in her movements that I didn't realize how close she had come. She was now beside me. She had seen my scars and was asking me if I needed help. How ironic that the person responsible for my injuries would offer to help me. He was playing with me. How dare he? How could he pretend not to know? As if it wasn't her own face in that damn mirror. As if it wasn't her image that tormented me so. I decided to play too.
""I just had an accident with some glasses, it's nothing"" I replied.
""What are you talking about? Look at your hands, your face! Listen, I can't leave you like this. I live nearby, do you want me to drive you to the hospital?""
""Thank you very much, but I wouldn't want to put you to any trouble...""
""I'm afraid you don't intend to go on your own. And I wouldn't want to leave you in that situation.""
Yes, sir. He was afraid for me. That's good. I didn't expect the joke to go that far. I followed her to an apartment building a few blocks away. She had her car parked outside.
""You look nervous, why? Do you want some water first?""
I wasn't nervous. But I agreed. I had to know where it was going. She seemed troubled. She was talking. But did she mean what she said? Did she want to help? We got into an apartment on the second floor. A real dump. How could someone like her live in a place like that? Plaster ready to fall, mold, damp. I wouldn't have lasted a day there.
""Why are you doing this?"" I asked her. ""You're bringing a stranger into your home. You promise him help. Why?""
""I found you badly injured sitting alone on a bench in the cold. Don't think that's my best all this. The opposite actually. But I don't know what else I could have done, I felt you needed help.""
Help. Yeah, right. Her hypocrisy had infuriated me. First she left me bloodied and battered, and now she wanted to help. She disgusted me. She disgusted me. I had to get her out of my life. Her and everything beautiful about her. Walking into the kitchen to get me some water, I noticed a knife on the counter. I picked it up without her seeing me and started bringing it around in my fingers. I began to observe the blade. And then I saw my reflection on it. I saw that awful yet beautiful image again. She. Her looking at me with a disapproving look as if she were mocking me. Enough. The torment had to end.
I didn't waste any more time. I hit three times in the throat. On the vocal cords. I never wanted to hear her melodious voice again. I saw the terror in her eyes. The realization that her life had come to an end. How horrible. To die and not be able to make a sound. Not being able to say the last words you planned, if you even had time to plan them. To walk away knowing you're dying at the hands of a man you wanted to help. To regret even talking to him. All that and so much more I could see in her eyes. So many thoughts. So much resentment. Horror. How lucky it wasn't happening to me.
But there was one thing I didn't see in her eyes. Regret. Even in her final moments, she refused to admit the harm she'd done to me. What irony. Those eyes. Those beautiful and terrible eyes. Those eyes that led to... my habit - not obsession - of thinking about her had become the source of my hatred for her. I never wanted to see their glow again. Two more hits were enough.
He was thrashing around on the floor like a fish out of water in a desperate attempt to stay alive. He tried to scream, but he couldn't. What a horrible way to die. But everyone gets what they deserve. And, oh, what satisfaction I got. Every drop of blood that spilled from her body was blood I got back for what she did to me. But I wasn't that selfish. Whatever satisfaction I got was not due to this ""revenge"" of mine. Because that wasn't revenge. Revenge is motivated by emotional factors. And it had left me with no other feelings. Only emptiness. A memory of the person I used to be. And now she's become the same. A memory. No. This was not revenge. It was punishment.
Feeling her soul leaving her body I may have felt a certain sense of sadness. Perhaps regret. But it was a small price to pay. The witch was dead. And every red splash on the wall brought me joy. The nightmare was over.
Some will call me crazy. Obsessive. But could a madman act as calmly as I do? With such clarity? Could a madman take her life as quietly, as calmly as I did? Could he remove one by one the shards of the mirror from his hands? Could he think clearly enough to place them inside her and rid himself of everything that reminded him of her? Could he clean the blood so carefully that nothing would give away the existence of a corpse? Could she dispose of her lifeless body as intelligently as I could? I don't think so. I wasn't crazy. I wasn't obsessed. I just had a habit. A habit I've now broken. Now it's over. It's all over.
The next few days passed calmly. I stopped seeing her. I stopped thinking about her. There was nothing left to remind me of her. Even the mirror I'd broken had been replaced. In its place I had put a bigger and nicer one that had a hidden cupboard behind it. Quite useful I must admit. Indeed, everything was perfect. Perhaps even better than before I met her. On the other hand, did I ever meet her? Was it normal that the loss of a stranger should bring me such happiness? No, it was her fault, not mine. She caused this. That's what I wanted to believe.
Sometimes, of course, a disturbing thought would cross my mind. I held her lifeless body in my hands, but I never knew her name. I wonder if she was as beautiful and special as she was? I had to find out. I needed to know. And it was this need that worried me. Because some habits might not go away.
Fortunately, this need was not long in coming and I was soon able to put her out of my mind again when I finally learned her name. I read it in the newspaper. Apparently, some of her relatives had reported her missing and the police were investigating the case. Personally, that didn't worry me. There was no evidence that I was involved in this disappearance. As I said, I had taken steps.
The days passed and I slept more peacefully than ever. The police investigations continued as usual, but they hadn't come to anything. They weren't even sure if it was a murder. That's how well I had covered my tracks. I wasn't crazy. In fact, from what I'd heard, they were thinking of stopping the investigation and only continuing if new evidence surfaced. So far, they'd only come up with the date of the disappearance. Various neighbors had reported that they hadn't noticed any movement of either her or her car from a certain date onwards.
Finally, shortly afterwards, someone gave information to the police about a strange figure sitting isolated from the others on a bench for hours. Asking left and right, it didn't take long to find someone who had identified me. It is not unreasonable that the police wanted to question someone whose description alone was suspicious and who just happened to be for hours in a place where the victim was known to hang out. It didn't take long to get the call from the police. They wanted to ask me some questions and were going to stop by my house. I can't hide the fact that I was scared. But without a body, I couldn't be accused of anything.
I started counting the minutes. I was trying to stay calm. They weren't supposed to understand anything. I had to be fully prepared to answer any question with ease. I rehearsed in my mind every possibility. Despite the anxiety I felt deep down, I was ready for anything.
Then I heard it. The bell. It was here. They were at the door, waiting. Taking one last deep breath before the show, I let them in. Two policemen were at the door. They showed me their badge. It was glowing. And it almost looked like... No, I was wrong, it couldn't. I led them into the living room, where we started talking. I answered their every question quickly and intelligently. They had no reason to doubt what I said. I even tried to maintain eye contact to show confidence. I looked at them so long that I could even see the entire room reflected in their eyes. I could even see... Nah, I was wrong.
Finishing our conversation, I picked up the now empty cups of coffee that I had offered them while they were preparing to leave. In the spoons, however, something caught my attention. In the reflection of the space I was making in their metallic material, I could make out a familiar figure. I began to have a terrible suspicion. From the living room, I discreetly tried to look at the bathroom mirror through the half-open door. I was now certain. Cold sweat washed over me.
My anxiety peaked when one of the two officers asked to go to the bathroom before they left. I couldn't refuse. I led him there and he closed the door. Now it was safe. One look in the mirror was enough. One look was enough to tell him everything. The game was over. And I had lost.
When he came out, he seemed unconcerned. I expected a different reaction. But he was already smiling. But he knew. He couldn't not know. He was playing with me. He wanted to make me confess. It wasn't enough for him to know the truth. He wanted to make it as difficult for me as possible. Yes, that's it. He was toying with me. Everybody was playing me.
""We are time to go. Unless you want to add something,"" he said.
He was laughing with me. He didn't show it, but I knew it. He and his partner. They both knew. They knew all along. They'd seen her. She was everywhere. There was no doubt.
""Stop! I can't take it anymore. You and everyone. Stop playing with me! These perverted games of yours are no longer going to get through to me! Enough! I know he spoke to you. I know you saw her. I know what you're trying to do. So let's finish an hour early.""
I went into the bathroom and showed him the mirror. I showed him the face in it. I showed him her. The one who decided to come back to get back at me. Or to punish me. Maybe both.
The policemen were stunned. Almost scared. They didn't know how to react. They played their part well. They acted as if they didn't know what I meant. As if they couldn't see. But I was going to show them.
""Here, then, there you are! No need to hide it! I know you've seen it. I know all about it, I'm not the crazy one. I know what you're doing! What? Don't you see? Take a closer look!""
With all the strength I had, I broke the mirror. I broke her image.
And with nothing to hold it back anymore, the only evidence of my guilt was free. Her head rolled out of the mirror's locker and fell to the floor.

He brings the coffee over and we asked for milk. He asked if we had changed our minds, and it slowly started clicking in that white coffee is just with milk added. We had never heard it called white coffee before. Here we were saying things like  ""I didn't know you could get white coffee beans!"" 🤦🏼‍♀️ We tried explaining, but the damage was done, he did not think it was as funny as we did.

My dad is concerned about me going overseas and to another country on my own. I'm also a bit concerned too. When I wasn't having seizures I did go to Budapest for 3 weeks and was fine. I was mostly with two other people though unless I went places myself like a coffee shop. This summer I went to Japan with my aunt and uncle and didn't have a seizure but I was always with someone. I visited my boyfriends family in Canada this summer as well but I did have a seizure. My boyfriend was there to help me though. With my internship it would be different.

Was sick n couldn't eat or drink, lost lotsa weight, was sick every morning like morning sickness, 1-3 hrs each morning, on toilet trash can between my knees, then I'd take my nausea meds, pass out for an hr, wake up go to work n make it through the day. I'm normally 190-210 lbs, 5'-10"". I get down to like 140 lbs, starts effecting mental health, balance, thinking, judgement, etc. 
     Positive for h-pylori n treated for it  like 7 times before I tested negative.Scoped from both ends. Treated for hpylori again. 
From then to now it happens every 3-6-9 months. I eventually was diagnosed with gastroperesis3yrs ago. No answers as to why. Continued seeing same gastro n same PCP till they started blaming alcohol , weed, and ciggerettes for causing it. When I rarely drink , like 1 or 2 drinks a couple years, I stopped weed for over a year and it came back still. I cut back to like 5-10 cigs 
a day still comes n goes at will. 
        Have seen 2 more pcps who after getting my previous records said same thing. Cigs alcohol n weed, even when I didn't do any of the above except barely smoke cigs. 
As it progresses, I do begin to use THC products when it gets to point I can't eat between bn Ill, no appetite, nausea ,and pain. Eventually thc products cease to help me eat at all.
   Gastroperesis comes n goes, when it's flaring up I can't take any any acids they worsen it. Can't eat cheeses. Barely eat half a sandwich daily. Only thing that helps is steroids(prednisone ) and antibiotics. If I just take one or the other I get temporary relief but comes back within weeks. If I take both n I take 1-3 courses of both it clears up.
          I've noticed that as I get back around my normal/usually weight it starts again.. 
          Starts with trouble swallowing, then loss of appetite, I literally get to point I don't think about eating drinking even. Don't feel hunger or thirst. Trying to eat get sick, throat locks up, can't swallow, right afterwards my spit gets so thick I can't scrape it off my tongue. So thick I can't spit out my spit. Swallowing it makes me feel sicker. I get to this point n as I breath in air goes into stomach. I get gas locked. Feel like bn stabbed through belly n out butt.  
             Now when I drink an occasional cup of coffee it feels like it's overdosing my organs on caffeine, I get the jitters in my stomach n organs. At new years I drank half a cup of margarita, 10%alcohol , 20 minutes later it felt like I had alcohol burning my abdomen. If I layed on rt side rt side burnt inside , left left side burnt, I spiked an instant fever, sweating, burning up, freezing, hurting severely, eventually past out. It reminded me of cotton fever, which I haven't used IV drugs in over ten yrs.
 No help, no HIV , no other major illness. Have had numerous back n neck surgeries. Lotsa nerve damage,A hernia surgery with mesh.

My kids' mom and thus the marriage succumbed to her serious mental illnesses when the kids were very small. And as demonstrated, I'd never had much patience for the Mormon cultural dress codes anyway. So when my daughter was to be baptized and she got a look at those frightfully ugly white polyester sacks they zip the little 8 year olds into, she said Ewww yuck, can I wear my favorite dress to the meeting instead (except for the actual dunking part). Sure, of course, I said. This was before I resigned and we were still somewhat active.

Well as it turned out, her favorite dress was a frilly party frock that was *bright red.* Slightly poofy skirt, and scandalously short cap sleeves. I didn't care. Neither did she. So when she marched into that chapel and sat on the front row with the wide-eyed white sack munchkins, she really stood out. And she totally owned it. Never batted an eye, neither one of us, even though I saw a lot of raised eyebrows. We still have the photos of her gleefully grinning in her vivid red dress next to all the other little kids in dull, predictable, unquestioned white.

Today that little girl is a beautiful young woman who loves coffee and Talisker, is headed to a T14 law school, and gleefully mocks Mormonism as a quirky cult she and her dad escaped before it did her any serious damage. Call me proud.",8,1735863975.0,exmormon,2,1.0,False

I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed and would love to hear from parents who’ve been through this. We’re thinking about growing our family to 3 under 5 (currently have 2), but we’re still on the fence because I’m not sure what life will look like with three. Right now, I’m job hunting but plan to be working full-time (probably 9-5) by the time we have our third. My partner also works full-time, and while we’re a great team, we don’t have any family nearby to help. The older two will be in daycare, which I know will help a lot!

We recently moved to the suburbs, so we’re still trying to settle in and figure out how to meet people and build a community. One of my biggest concerns is whether having three kids will mean losing our social life completely. For those of you with three little ones, do you still have time to connect with friends, do playdates, or even just grab a coffee with someone? Or does life with three kids feel like being on an island where it’s just you and your family all the time?

We’re still debating whether to even have a third because we really value having a life outside of our little bubble. I’d love to hear your honest experiences—how you manage everything, what’s been hardest, and if you’ve been able to maintain some sort of balance.

Honestly, we’re trying to have it all: the kids, the jobs, the friends, and I don’t know if that’s asking too much. I really would like a big family but I am incredibly nervous about the questions listed above.

Thank you so much for reading, and sending love to all the parents out there just trying to keep it together!",0,1735863885.0,Shouldihaveanother,1,0.5,False

Apologies for the novel. I’m not sure how to start this or what background to give. Most people start by saying how great their partner is and then go on to list all the ways they have been abused or mistreated. I’m gonna try to not do that lol I’ll just get into it. I am looking for any advice to help gain clarity on what’s going on and what I can realistically do about it. 

I am overwhelmed and desperate to make a change. I know I can’t sustain living my life the way it is right now for much longer before I have some sort of breakdown. I wake up every day stressed and depressed and I don’t like who I have become. My marriage is a mess and I need to do something about it. It’s time to walk away or buckle down and get serious and I need help making that decision. I recognize I’ve been abused to some degree, but I’m confused and foggy on identifying what is reality and what I am exaggerating or making up in my head. 

Here is some relevant information: 

- Married for almost 6 years, together going on 9. I have two stepchildren and no bio kids.

- I am getting set up with a therapist.

- I have downloaded both the books, “Why Does He Do That?” and “Should I Stay or Should I Go?” and have begun to read them.

These are the questions running through my head:

- Is it even possible to heal after years of this damage?

- How do I even begin to bring this up to a therapist?

- What sort of boundaries should I explicitly be setting with him? 

- What questions should I be asking myself? What questions should I be asking him?

- How do I know how much of this is my fault? I have got to the point where I feel like my tolerance level is just so low now that my reactions in response to him have become also toxic and maybe even abusive back to him (he says this is the case).

- I’m not sure what I should be looking for exactly. How do I know if things are actually on the mend and it’s not just “love bombing” or a “quiet period”? 


I’ll just get into it I guess.

Here are some of the more extreme things that I am trying to heal from and work through both on an individual level of course, but also within whatever is left of this marriage:

- he has strangled me twice (lifted me off the ground) for a few seconds each time and slapped me (the most recent time was in 2019 and he hasn’t since) and then said I must like it and wanted it because I had enjoyed it lightly during sex

- he had non consensual sex with me once (also in 2019) (we haven’t had sex in close to a year and a half also) and felt awful after I confronted him about it a week or so later.

- has said awful things to me in our yelling (told me I was dead to him, whore, bitch, piece of shit, etc.)

- I’ve had to lock myself in our bathroom because he would follow me when I would try to get away during the yelling attacks (I’ve had to do this a lot throughout the years) this hasn’t happened as much

- Purposefully would run the other water faucets in the house while I’m in the shower in order to make my water turn cold on me (hasn’t done this in years)

- Eavesdropped on my virtual therapy appointment by hiding around the corner then starting an argument during the middle of my appointment because I caught him and called it out (this was once probably around 2021ish)

- Shut me and locked me out of the house in the middle of winter in only a t shirt and underwear in an argument (years ago) (2021)

- When I was suicidal and confided in him, his first reaction was to tell me to make sure I do it somewhere else far away because he didn't want to deal with it

- Religious abuse (I was weak and agreed to humor his dabbling in religion- he got to the point where when we argued he would try to “perform an exorcism” on me, and repeatedly told me I was possessed) 

- Financial abuse (used to give me stipulations on the type of job I could have because he needed me around for the children and homecare because he was always gone for work but expected me to contribute 50/50 financially, he gets the final say in all financial decisions and has access to all financial accounts, while I only have access to my solo one. Mind you, we have no savings or emergency fund and he won’t budget unless I force it) (This month he recently offered to take out his 401k to pay off my student loans, I told him it was a bad idea and he decided he wanted to provide that for me to get the stress off my shoulders and did it anyways. I would have rather that gone into a HYSA for an emergency fund).

- Was (and may still be?) a conspiracy theorist (flat earth, astrology, numerology, reptilians, etc.) I don’t know his beliefs currently because he knows not to bring it up around me anymore but it scares me because I am scared of people with that sort of mentality. He used to make fun of people behind their backs for thinking the Earth was a globe and the kids used to come and ask me if I actually believed the Earth was flat like their dad, because they were too afraid to disagree with him openly.

- Said he wanted to kill me once years ago (like 2017)

- He got dangerously ill years ago and accused me saying I probably poisoned him

- I had a miscarriage (2022) and he not only wasn’t there for me at all emotionally, he verbally attacked me and accused me of baby-trapping him (we were already married)

He hasn’t done anything else nonconsensual and hasn’t physically harmed me since the times mentioned but there are still arguments far too frequently that get to that extreme level. He does show shame and sometimes remorse over things he does/says. 

I don’t even know how to get into the details of how things came to be, mostly because I am not sure myself, but I do know that there has been a mix of awful things he’s said/done, and other smaller things that I am worried now weren’t that “small” to begin with. Obviously I can’t include every detail. Basically, little instances of being emotionally unavailable or harsh I let pass by without standing up for myself and I blame myself for that and feel this set a precedent. I almost feel guilty now for no longer being able to be passive about any of it. I recognize that so many of my decisions were made in the moment with him as the default, me prioritizing his comfort or preferences over mine - first because it’s just what I knew to do, but then it became more out of fear of his reactions if things didn’t go smoothly or the way he would have liked. I don’t feel safe around his reactions when things inconvenience him. 

This all pretty much started around month 3 or 4 of our relationship and has gone on since. The more extreme things have mostly been done prior to the year 2022 but we still have the blow-up arguments at least every couple of weeks to a month it seems. Maybe the longest we’ve gone without a blow up ever in our relationship has been around 2 months.

I let things that hurt me go on for far too long and didn’t follow through on doing anything about it, so I feel guilty doing anything now about it. Almost like I’m taking something back. And I would feel awful especially if he really is changing and trying to change. Even thinking of leaving makes me feel sick to my stomach and like a terrible person. 

He says he knows things are awful and that he has done terrible things. He says he loves me and wants to be with me and work to make our marriage work. He says he knows he needs to change and is working on it. He is super kind to me other times which is confusing and it seems like it’s not to be intentionally manipulative… but what do I know. He makes me coffee every morning, he does housework, he cooks more than I even do, he wants to spend time with me. I just don’t know. 

Other things to note:

- My whole life I feel like things have been pretty “extreme”, so I worry I don’t have a reliable baseline to judge my experiences on and that I may actually be downplaying some of this. 

- I self medicate with cannabis (like… a lot. Like withdrawals are terrible a lot) and I am an addict. I plan to wean off and get sober but have been afraid to deal with the consequences of that while I am still in the midst of dealing with my home life. I had a year of sobriety two years ago and during that time all of the deeper emotions and realizations regarding this stuff came flooding up and I haven’t been able to ignore it ever since despite consuming every night again still. 

- Around the time I got sober, I also got a full time job that requires a lot of socialization and interaction with different types of people. Prior to that I worked from home and had little to no socialization in my life. I have no friends that live nearby (they all moved away) and get very little in-person socialization still that goes beyond my job. I do still communicate with my close friends and they are dear to me. My job has also shown me more of a glimpse on how other people live and socialize and cooperate within marriages and intimate relationships as it is a public health type of position within my community. 

I’m resolute to not be like the other women in my family - my mother waited a long time until she left my abusive father and my grandmother never left my abusive grandfather because she thought divorce was one of the worst sins a woman could commit (I’m not religious, myself). I never wanted to be like them. But I don’t know if my situation warrants leaving. I also don’t want to be the type of person who gives up and leaves my marriage without trying everything possible. I took my vows seriously. 

I don’t know where to go with my thoughts from here. I know I’ve made mistakes. I don’t want to keep making them and I want to really take control of my life and full ownership. ",1,1735863804.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

I love being a SAHM, but can't help feeling like I'm a personal assistant, not a wife. Even though, I am religious and believe strongly that a woman is made to be a help meet for her husband, I can't help but wonder where to draw the line. 

My husband (35 M), works from home and occasionally likes to get out and work from coffee shops to socialize. Totally fine by me. But I have notice his work takes longer, due to his slacking off watching YouTube videos. Again, totally okay to have breaks, but it is ALL day that he watches videos. Even hours after he is supposed to be off of work. 

Sometimes, I'll ask him to hold the baby while he is no longer at his desk and not on laptop working. At the max, he will hold our daughter for ten minutes. Then set her down, leaving her bawling her eyes out since she is a separation anxiety stage. 
I only ask him to hold her when I need to do chores, change, or take a shower. I don't really get the time myself to just sit around and relax. As I write this, my baby is using me as a pacifier to sleep.
On top of that, I do run a small online business to make up the difference for me being a SAHM. 
I do all of the house chores, grocery shopping, cooking, and childcare. Maybe once a week my husband will put away dishes, usually followed by complaints of how the dishwasher should always be empty. I have been falling behind on chores, but our apartment is never sloppy. 

I am wondering if maybe it's wrong for me to want my husband to stop wasting his time on his phone so much and do some light housechores, like sweeping, vacuuming, and scrubbing the toilets?
I totally agree that I can do a majority of the chores and cooking, but I am wanting a little help, like 20 minutes a day. Even just holding the baby for an hour, the WHOLE hour without putting her down, so I can do the chores that I can't do while holding her or having her in the Moby wrap.

We got married in late 2023, we each had two stressful, but worth it, career changes in early 2024. We then had our honeymoon to Croatia in May and bought our first home in August (went from paying $1350 a month, to now having a mortgage which is barely over $2000 a month). Then, we had our beautiful daughter in September. The last year was wild, and we are very much looking forward to catching our breath in 2025. Along with that comes dedicated future planning and hopefully more relax time, and fun along the way.  
  
We just set up an expenses tracker for January to track EVERYTHING. This is the first time we will have done this. We just want to have a better idea of exactly how much $$ is going where, and how much we have leftover. We are both pretty frugal, so we don't think this will be necessary for the entire year, but we might come to find out it's really useful, so we're pretty open minded.  
  
We both want to retire early, exactly how early we're not sure yet. But ultimately we just want to live more on our own terms, as well as provide a healthy future for our little girl (and any future kiddos).

**More about us:**  
I love my wife, my little girl, being a dad, and working with my wife to create a home that is truly ours. I also enjoy playing golf, buying and selling sports cards, and am working on more of a minimalist lifestyle at home so that I can create peaceful spaces for myself in our garage and our basement. My wife is working on finding more hobbies, but for now is solely focused on being a mom and currently coming to the realization of just how meaningless her job is when compared to being a mom. We love to travel and go on road trips (one annual trip to a specific low key place we like), and are looking forward to more trips with our little one. We also enjoy going on coffee shop dates, seeing live music, and going on family walks.

The previous two shifts this person rang every 30 minutes for toast, pudding, coffee, jello, etc.  On day two I started to keep track and  realized I’d brought them EIGHT PIECES of toast during my shift plus all the other snacks and beverages requested. This was in addition to the three square meals a day delivered to their bedside table. My last shift on New Year’s Day was insane, we’re talking IVs needed to be placed. Narcotics, multiple blow outs, washes, pad and linen changes. Nonstop ringing from the four other patients I had for their PRN dilaudid amongst other requests. One patient who required all of the above was also extremely sexually inappropriate and repeatedly threw themselves from bed to the floor. I was in their room with two others with the lift to transfer them back. It was the THIRD time that day.

Fast forward to when I was in the midst of assisting the other patient in the same room as this lady, she hits her call bell. Earlier in the day the care aid gave her toast (like the 10th slice of the day) She had the audacity to tell both the CCA and I to “fuck off” and mutter whatever else because **it wasn’t toasted to her liking.** Wanna know what she said when I told her I can’t get her tea right now …. “ you guys are ignoring me and you’re casting me aside….” This lady was independent, had a commode at bedside, on RA and was infuriated because I didn’t drop everything and sprint to grab her 20th tea of the day. I said “Hey , it’s busy, myself and the care aids have brought in snacks when you requested the past few days. When it comes to meds, and other important care we have to prioritize what we attend to first. I’ll get you your tea after I’m done here” 

This lady lost her damn mind and cussed me out while I was still in the room attending to the other patient after our ‘talk’ under her breath. Again.

Met a girl on Tinder and we're both in the same line of work (photography). She was really interested in me, was updating me on what she was up to and calling me every day.

We shared stories about our lives, our exes, our aspirations, and it was nice getting to know her. We also made each other laugh. A lot.

I told her about this, and she said she will help me get out of the rut by assisting her at work. She invited me to join her on specific dates for shoots. 

This was a big opportunity for me what she was offering. We talked through all the details - how she would pick me up, drop me off, and what I needed to buy to be ready (which I went out and got, and it wasn't cheap buying the equipment needed). She even told me to buy snacks for her and her friends to bring with me, so I went to the grocery store and bought her a gift bag of snacks that she requested. 

She confirmed with the boss and got the green light. We planned to meet beforehand and go for a coffee. 

The day came for us to meet, and in the morning, she said she really wanted to see me, but she was not feeling talkative after having an argument with her ex over their cohabiting situation. I said we didn't have to meet that day if she was feeling overwhelmed. 

After several hours of silence, she messaged me asking for my address and that she'd pick me up. 

We went out together, had fun, I caught her staring at me a few times and then blushing and quickly looking away when I caught her.  We were very touchy feely and playful with one another. So things seemed to go well. She pulled me into a hug when she dropped me home. 

And...I've not really heard from her since. No message when she got home. I messaged her the next day to check in on her and she was very aloof. 

A few days later, after more silence, I checked in again, and she said she was just in a bad headspace and not really talkative with anyone at the moment, so not to take it personally. 

I asked if she wanted me to completely disappear if she wasn't feeling it, and she just said she was in a bad headspace. So I left her alone not really knowing where I stand but wanted to respect her space but I felt very awkward by this sudden shut out. 

She still follows me on social media and watches my IG stories, but she basically has gone completely mute. 

I haven't heard from her for 3 days. The shoot is tomorrow. And I've not heard from her at all. 

And it feels pretty shitty as she got my hopes up about working together, and I invested money into getting the right equipment for this. 

I feel like a total idiot right now that I got my hopes up and went out and bought expensive equipment for something that I assume now isn't happening at all. I personally could never do this to someone, even if I had known them briefly, because if they went through the effort to buy expensive equipment and get excited to shoot, I couldn't personally just rip that way from them after making a promise. 

I can't lie, my heart hurts a bit. How do people think this is okay to do instead of just being upfront? How do I put a positive spin on getting my hopes up about a potential friendship/relationship and work opportunity that has now fizzled into nothing so quickly?",4,1735863572.0,ActualLesbiansOver25,4,1.0,False

So, last year I stopped drinking at home and switched to only allowing myself a glass of wine or two on dinners out. Now, I'd like to remove that as well, but here's my problem: I don't know what to order to drink and it honestly makes me anxious to think about. 

I've tried ordering club soda with lime, or diet coke, but the problem is I really don't care for cold drinks unless it's 90 degrees out! 

So what do I replace my red wine with at a restaurant? At Japanese restaurants, I can do green tea, which is satisfying enough and that works. But at other restaurants, I just don't know what to get. I'd rather not do coffee because even though I enjoy my morning cup, I really don't want it with a meal. It just overpowers the taste of everything else. 

So, am I down to joining my mother-in-law in her ""just water, no ice""? Doesn't sound appealing, but I really can't think of anything else.

I have a pic of them cuz my mom was fan girling lol but I don’t think I will include just cuz it feels weird posting a pic of people out in public.

Not OC but also in 2019 I believe, my then-bf and I were at knotts berry farm (theme park) with his family and his mom asked for a pic with bethany frankel. My mom was so jealous lol.

Firstly I suffered from anxiety and depression for the last 20 years. The below has given my massive anxiety and guilt mixed in with grief and a stabbing pain in my stomach. I really don't know what I'm looking for here. I feel lonely. I've now lost both parents. I have an older brother left, we're not close (see below).

My mother died the day after Christmas.

My mother had lung cancer for 6 years. She lived with my older brother for this time. I live overseas but I came back 6x this year. I took care of her for 5 weeks in September October but also came back for Christmas and rented a place. She had ceased treatment and was given 50/50 to make it to Christmas. She had Christmas with her 2 surviving children and 2 grandchildren. However, it all went bad when my kids left.

I have a bad relationship with my brother. He treated me badly as a child, he also sexually abused me too. I was 5-7, he was 12-14. He also took drugs and caused problems for my parents. Eventually he was jailed but later he turned his life around and became successful. I thought i had forgave him but apparently not. I had my own success but he always wanted to dominate for some reason and he loves to bait me.

So, after my kids left my brother, who turned up late brought a lot of beer. We both drank and he brought up the past and began to minimize it. I asked him to avoid the topic but he did it again and again and I completely lost it calling him every name under the sun while my mother lay in the bedroom. I eventually kicked him out at 7p.m. I fell asleep at 9p.m next to my mum who had been in the room and was very frail and incapable of eating or really doing anything other than lying in bed. I was drunk and don't recall what I said of anything. The fight makes me terribly guilty, what did I say, why did I drink rather than spend every precious moment. I know it was a terrible situation to see her like that but still.

I woke at 8a.m and she had labored breathing and had somehow moved to the sofa because I snore (I think). I said we should go to hospital. She said no. I wasted an hour doing fuck all. Maybe more. Got her a coffee, then went and watched  YouTube ffs. Hoping it would get better but I didn't call an ambulance. She didnt want to move but I moved her to the bed and proped her up. At 1030a.m my brother called. More fucking around. By 11.40a.m things were bad and we took her in his vehicle to hospital. Her body went limp as we lifted her but her eyes were open, lips moving. I held her as she died in the car, maybe in the wheel chair. They attempted cpr but no point of course. 

I know she died on her terms and made Christmas but I feel I was 'negligent'. Why didn't I call an ambulance, did my tirade again my brother push her over the edge, did I say something really hurtful before I fell asleep, why didn't I hold her hand in that last hour or 2 rather than hoping (assuming) or avoiding the problem. It could never have been fixed, she was 84 and on her very last saps of energy but I still feel shockingly guilty nonetheless.

Just wasn't my best self maybe in the last 24/48 hours but I did try. It was inevitable. She hated the idea of dying in hospital. Lucky I was here rathed than her dying when i was away.. Just beating myself up I guess.

She recommended a book I actually ended up buying. But failed to get her number due to my friend accidentally interjecting.

But today I was getting coffee again she came in to start her shift and stole some chit chat in between her making coffees as she was very busy. I said "" I bought that book you recommended"" I was wearing a cowboy hat today so after a double take she said ""yeah how far into it"" with a smile. I said ""not too far before I got busy"" she then said ""well don't tell me if you don't like it, it's my favorite book"" ""I won't"" i said. 

I then wrote on a note with my number ""text me you're cute"" handed it too her when I grabbed my coffee and said ""text me more recommendations? "" she said ""oh yeah?"" With a smirk and grabbed my note then back to work. 


Now I am a huge over thinker as I have adhd lol but for her being busy it seemed to go ok. In my head I feel like if she wasn't into it I would of been rejected already.

The fight started because I left a dish in the sink and was tired from not sleeping well (after he kept me up late talking), so I was late to get coffee with him. For multiple days, he kept me awake for hours arguing/fighting. He followed me throughout the house, berating and yelling at me, refusing to leave me alone when I told him to leave. He's had a lot of these types of episodes in the past, and I am beyond exhausted. It's ruined my holidays, destroyed my ability to study for finals for a graduate program I'm in, and has generally left me feeling emotionally destroyed. He's never hit me or physically harmed me, but he's caused me a lot of emotional distress and has made me feel very uneasy (borderline unsafe sometimes) with his out-of-control behavior on several occasions. In addition, he makes jokes about killing me daily, slap/bite me harder than I liked frequently, and puts his hands around his neck pretending to strangle me (without any pressure) sometimes.

I flew home last week and am finally able to relax without waking up with anxiety wondering what mood he'll be in. After a lot of guilt-tripping, blowing my phone up getting upset if I didn't respond right away, and keeping me on the phone for many hours (causing me to miss dinner with my family over the holidays), he finally agreed to give me some space while we both seek professional help and couples counseling. I am seeing a psychologist (I hope to talk with them about this relationship and how it's affecting me because I have crippling anxiety) and he's seeing a psychiatrist to work on anger management and impulse control for his ADHD, depression, and PTSD (which apparently causes him to have these anger outbursts). He has not officially been diagnosed with BPD, but he fits the description in many ways so I suspect he may have it in addition to ADHD/PTSD. Since I had a mental breakdown and told him I would fail out of my program if he didn't leave him alone, he allowed me to take several weeks to just focus on school/my mental health and not talk to him.

I am seriously considering ending the relationship even though I still deeply love and am trauma-bonded with him. Even though he can be a jerk, he is still my best friend and extremely kind/loving to me *most* of the time (otherwise, I wouldn't stay). He showers me with love, compliments, affection, believes in me, encourages and motivates me in my goals, and is generally kind and loving when he's not being cruel. My brain fog, confusion, and anxiety is absolutely crippling right now. Studying/concentrating is basically impossible and I'm afraid I'll fail or be kicked out of my graduate program because I'm so nonfunctional. I feel like I'm walking around in a stupor and I don't know how to get out of it. I also feel like I'm insane/overreacting/delusional/psychotic (as he's told me many times during our fights) because he never hit me so the abuse isn't real/isn't that bad.

It feels cathartic just to type it all out. I’m at a complete loss watching my best friend dissolve into a stranger and it’s impacting our business and my marriage.  I’m desperate to save our friendship, the business, and the health of my marriage, if any of it is in any way within my ability. 

TL;DR  I started a business with my husband W, and we hired my best friend M at great expense and strain. M doesn’t always see eye to eye with W, and W has been bending over backwards to compromise with my desire for peace by letting M’s work and personal missteps slide. M works hard but doesn’t communicate with me, ask for help in her role, or treat me as a friend any more. Two of our mutual friends are now ghosting me, and M stays in touch with them but won’t open up to me about why they’re upset. Pushing M to communicate gets me nowhere. I’m feeling incredibly hurt, and am watching M’s struggles in her role harm our business and my marriage. AITA for expecting an employee to remain a friend? Is there any way I can resolve this while keeping my friend, my business, and my marriage?


Mainly involved:
Me, 29F
My husband W, 29M
My friend M, 36F

Side involvement:
My friend’s mom, G, 65F
Our recently resigned employee, H, 50F.


I made what’s considered to be a classic mistake as a new business owner and hired a longtime friend, M. I’d heard plenty of advice against hiring any friends in business, but I just couldn’t imagine how working together with M could be anything other than amazing. 

Instead of the “rainbows and sunshine” magical adventure I naively anticipated, I feel like I am watching our friendship die a slow, painful death. 

I met my husband W 10 years ago in college in the USA. I am American and W is originally from the UK. We graduated, moved in together, and started jobs in the same area we went to school. This was a very expensive area of the states and so we always had roommates. For three years, our roommate was my career colleague-turned-friend, M. 

W got stuck visiting family in the UK during lockdown, so M and I lived together mostly without W through COVID. M and I cooked for each other, shopped for each other, shared the same social bubble, would share a bed when we travelled, etc - we were very close and despite my surprise long distance relationship and COVID circumstances, it was a really enjoyable time. I grew close with M’s family, especially her mom, G, who lived nearby. I often went to G’s house for dinner and to help her with various household chores. I grew so close with M’s family that I was invited on their family holidays, even when M occasionally couldn’t attend. G even started referring to me as one of her daughters, and M called me one of her sisters. 

Once lockdown lifted, I left America and moved to the UK to reunite with W.  We got married and settled in a microscopic terraced house in a suburban area near his childhood home/family house. Far away from the nearest city, our only option for continuing our careers was to work remotely. It was isolating, especially when I wanted to make new friends in a new country. After a few months, we decided to leave our careers and start a hospitality business in W’s nearby dilapidated family home. We moved into a 2 bedroom annex of the house - it was the nicest place we’d ever lived.

We took on nearly 1M in loans to get our business off the ground. We poured nearly all of the loan money into the house to bring it out of the Victorian ages (heat, electricity, plumbing) and the rest was invested into building a small team. 

Last year was our first open season, and while we are a long, long way from profitable, it was a very promising start.

Midway through our first open season, M called me from America in tears. Her relationship had fallen apart, her dog had passed away, and she needed a friend. My savings were empty and my self-employed salary was minute, so M bought me a flight to come and visit her in the states. 

When I got to M’s, her situation went from bad to worse. Her company started layoffs and she was let go.  M said “what am I even doing here? I need a change. I want to come and work with you and W.” I chatted with W who was excited (and nervous) about the idea, and by the end of my brief visit, W and I had agreed to sponsor M’s visa for her to join our business in the UK. 

M’s visa requires a minimum salary which is far, far less than what M was earning in the states, but more than triple what we are paying ourselves. It strained the business immensely to have an additional full-time member of staff at a comparatively expensive rate so early on. But we dug deep and took additional financial risk to make it work. M is a very hard worker, after all - we thought the strain would be worth it in order to have her on the team. M had no experience in the hospitality industry, but hey, neither did we before we started, other than a bit of restaurant work on my end! We were so excited and optimistic.

We were completely upfront with M about our business - it is very hard work, our roles were not yet clearly defined, and the company was financially unstable. We couldn’t make any promises. She was still eager to give it a shot, even going so far as to move her newly adopted puppy overseas with her. M and I agreed before she moved that our friendship should always come first.

M & her dog moved to the UK early this year, and I wanted to give M a proper start in her new adventure.  W was against having a roommate again now that we were married. But I wanted to help M build up savings, so i convinced W to let M and her dog live with us rent-free while she found her footing. She needed a car; so we shared our car with her and even paid for her insurance. She needed friends, so we introduced her to our UK friend group, and even paid a deposit for M to join us on a trip with our UK friends in the new year, which we embark on tomorrow. 

We gave and gave and gave, and despite W’s aversion to living with a roommate, he compromised daily to keep me happy and supportive of my friend. M is quite stoic so I never expected any thanks, but I suppose I’m lying to myself, because I’m upset that there has never been a word of gratitude from M for the sacrifice and strain we took on the business and unexpectedly on our marriage to have her here. 

After 4 months of living together, W was understandably at the end of his rope. In M’s first month in the UK she had found a new boyfriend who was staying at our place unannounced for up to 4 days a week - Especially tough when there’s only one bathroom, and our needy cats meant we couldn’t even close our bedroom door for privacy. We had asked M to communicate with us when her boyfriend would be staying and for how long, but M is not a good communicator and we were often surprised to find her boyfriend’s car in the drive. Another challenge in living together was that M’s new dog loved to chase our cats. Our once cuddly kittens were spending most of their time cowering in fear under our bed. 

I loved having M here but we wanted our peaceful and private home back. On numerous occasions, W and I gently suggested to M that she move to the vacant flat next door. We agreed to lease the flat for M through the business, then she could pay a slightly elevated rent to account for using our car. This would reduce a bit of the business’s financial strain. She seemed receptive to living in the other flat but wasn’t taking any action. Fast forward another 2 months, and W told M more directly that he’d had enough and we needed our guest room back. My family was coming to visit, and she needed to go so they’d have a place to stay. She moved into the flat next door at the last possible moment; the same day my family arrived.

Phew, unnecessary stress and drama, but she’d finally moved out, and now it would all be happy days, I thought.

A week after the move, M’s mom & my good friend G came to stay in M’s flat next door.  G highly disapproved of M’s move to the UK - she couldn’t fathom why her daughter would leave a career that paid her 6 times more money, and G missed having M so close by. 
G also told me in private that M was very hurt by the move out, and was upset by unfair treatment from W.  G told me that M felt W was trying to make money off of her by charging her an elevated rent (about £150 more per month than base rent, in order to cover the car). G also said that W and I made M’s new boyfriend feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. G mentioned that M is a terrible communicator and asked me to be the “go-between” for W and M in order to smooth it out “before it turns into a disaster.”  Ominous, right? I shared with G that I’m in therapy to work on my unhealthy feelings of responsibility for other people’s happiness.  G left at the end of her 3 week stay without saying goodbye.

After mulling G’s words over, I decided to go against my therapist’s advice and try to fix the alleged situation between M and W anyway. I took M out for a drink and tried to get her to open up. She swore up and down all was fine.  Over the next couple of weeks I approached her twice more to check if everything was OK between her and W, and each time she assured me all was well and she was happy. I even encouraged W to reach out to her apologetically, which he did, and she swore to him everything was all good and that she didn’t take the move personally.

OK, I thought, maybe G was making it all up because she’s upset that M moved to another country? I’ve texted G and called her a few times since she left 4 months ago, but I’ve been ghosted. It’s unusual as we used to talk weekly and I really enjoy her friendship. Earlier this year she had invited me on another family trip, but ghosted me before I was even able to decline the invitation. Uninvited, I suppose?

I’ve asked M why her mom isn’t speaking to me, and M just shrugs.  OK, it’s her family, I won’t pry, I thought. It would be unfair of me to push M for an explanation of her mother’s behavior.   I sent G a final message letting her know I value her friendship and my door is always open, and left it at that. I showed M my unanswered messages to G - another shrug. 

Recently someone else, H, who has worked for W’s family prior to joining our business (a total of 4 years) unexpectedly resigned over text on New Year’s Day.  It was very out of the blue, we had just had a great end of year review chat with H earlier in the week, and W and I are trying to get some feedback as to why she’s quitting. We responded to H’s resignation with a request to chat over coffee, something we’ve done weekly with H since the very beginning.  But our messages are left on read.

Instead of responding to either W or I, H instead reaches out to M to grab a coffee. I was actually thrilled she’s at least talking to someone.  M went during the work day and chatted with H for hours. When M came back she said nothing, didn’t share any feedback. Is it unfair of me, as a friend, as an employer, or as this weird mix of both, to expect M to share some info where it pertains to the health of our team and business?  This is my biggest question I am hoping for your advice on.


M and I’s friendship is dying. Since we introduced her to our friend group, she hosts them for dinner in her flat without extending the invitation to us.  She hasn’t stepped foot in our annex since she moved out and ignores our dinner invitations.  I have mentioned over and over again that I want to meet her boyfriend properly, and try to make plans that include them both, but again she dodges them.  She bailed on a trip to London with a mutual friend without a word. I’ve worn my heart on my sleeve and told M that I can feel us growing distant and it’s making me miserable. She said she thinks it’s just the difference of us not living together.

To top it all off, M’s work performance is inconsistent, and it’s adding further strain to our business because other team members can clearly see that we’re making exceptions for a friend. Our sole investor instructed us to let M go, but I’ve convinced them to let me have one more shot. I have til the end of Q1 to encourage M to become a productive revenue-generating member of our team. 


Should I…
- Give up on my friendship with M and warn her that she needs to meet her goals in Q1 or she’s out?
- Just let her go from the business and hope that our friendship bounces back in the future?
- Try to talk to her AGAIN and get stonewalled?
- Insert miraculous solution here

1hs8add,https://www.reddit.com/r/JetLagTheGame/comments/1hs8add/we_played_hide_and_seek_using_cars_heres_what_we/,We played Hide and Seek using cars! Here's what we found.,"Hello everyone! On Tuesday, my friends and I attempted to play Hide and Seek across Irvine, California! Due to the lack of public transit routes in the city, and the poor frequencies on many of the existing routes, we instead opted to play using cars. In order to do this, we had to make major modifications to the game, including changing parts of the core gameplay and most of the seeker questions. After posting the start of our game on Twitter, several people asked me to detail our expirence playing. I decided to post this here to share my expirence playing the game with cars, what went well, and what we would change for next time.

For this game, we decided to play in two teams of two people. The reason we did this was so that while seeking, one person could drive while the other person could research and ask questions. Having a second person also made hiding more fun, since you weren't alone for hours at a time. We decided to play with a small game, but we limited the hiding time to 15 minutes, since you could get everywhere in our map if we used the recommended 30 minutes. The high speed limits of the roads and the removal of wait times also allowed us to travel much faster than with transit. However, we did ban the use of freeways in order to prevent hiders and seekers from moving too fast and far. We decided to use the intersections of major roads as our train stations. We measured each radius from the central point of the intersection. We determined major roads based off our own judgement instead of using some sort of definition. We also included some roads that were smaller in order to hide in certain locations that would not be possible otherwise. For example, we included smaller roads around the Irvine Spectrum Center, a major shopping mall, in order to be able to hide there. I created maps of these roads and the hiding radius of each intersection on ArcGIS Pro, and exported them as web maps. I would reccomend doing this if you are able to use and access ArcGIS Pro or any similar software. We kept our hiding radius at a quarter mile. Since people had plans later that day, and because we did not want to play Hide and Seek for longer, we decided to limit our play time to 8 hours, or if both teams hid twice.

We modifyed most of the seeker questions to apply to our area and that we were playing using cars. For example, we changed the question that asks if the transit the seekers were riding would stop at the hider's station to whether the seekers would pass the hider's intersection on the road they were driving down. We also removed questions that asked about something that wasn't in the area, such as if the hider's foreign consulate was the same as the seeker's, since there were no foreign consulates in our area. We decided to add a one mile thermometer, and remove all radars larger than 5 miles to meet our needs. We also decided to add back in tentacles with a one mile radius, normally only reserved for medium and large games, because our entire area was very built up. We decided to change our places to schools, grocery stores, parks, and coffee shops. We did this because there were always multiple of each in the radius, as opposed to the places suggested. We also decided to change the widest street photo question to the two buildings photo question because most of the major street widths are similar in Irvine. When modifying the hider deck, we only had to remove 4 curses and modify an additional 2, as we found that most curses can still be used when playing the game with cars. I will attach our rules document for anyone who wants to look at the modifications we made.

The actual gameplay went very well. The game still felt like the original even with the addition of cars. We were worried that the drivers would feel less included since they could not ask questions while driving to prevent distractions, but at the end they said that they felt involved and had fun. In order to keep everyone safe, we banned driving over the speed limit, and an offense would add 5 minutes to the hider's time. In order to enforce this, we used Life360, which shows the speeds of the drivers as well as if they were distracted. This worked well, but it did drain our phones' batteries by a lot, so I would recommend bringing some portable chargers. Each round actually went above our expected time of around 75 minutes per round of average. The average round took an hour and 43 minutes, with the longest round taking almost two hours. Since we limited ourselves to 8 hours of play time, we could not have a fourth run since we ran out of time. This ended up not mattering, since the first run from the second team was the longest run, meaning they did not need to hide again. However, it is definitely something to note if you are trying to plan something similar. Another thing that I did not expect going into the game was the strategy of hiding the car. Finding the hider's car gave away that they were in the area, so hiding your team's car was a big strategy. This played out in many ways. For example, my friend and I decided to hide our car in a somewhat obvious spot but made it look like we attempted to hide it. We then went as far away as we could. Our hope was that the seekers would find our car, assume we were very close, and search the area around our car first. However, they never found the car and ended up parking very close to our hiding spot, meaning that once they found us they were close to their car to go and hide while we had to run 5 minutes back to our car before going to seek them. I would also recommend hiding in a spot that is somewhat comfortable and would not be seen as suspisious. My friend and I hid in a bush at a park for an hour and a half, which was not only awful to do but also would have seemed very strange if we were caught by someone else. 

I want to conclude by discussing some ideas for other ways the game can be adapted for cars. Our first idea was to do a county- or region-wide version of the game. We would have used the extensive Southern California freeway system as our transit lines and freeway interchanges as the stations. This would be more similar to a medium-sized game, but we would give ourselves half an hour to hide. We decided not to do this based on time, but it would be a good idea to do in the future. Another idea would be to adopt the idea of roads and intersections on a neighborhood scale instead of a city-wide scale. This would provide a much shorter expirence, and may work well for people who want to play while walking or biking. Overall we had a great time, the game worked very well despite being adapted for something it wasn't intended to do, and we would definitely do it again!

TL;DR: We played Hide and Seek using cars, major roads were our transit lines and intersections were our stations, we made many modifications to the game and the questions, overall the game went well and we had a lot of fun!",20,1735861654.0,JetLagTheGame,4,1.0,False

The fight started because I left a dish in the sink and was tired from not sleeping well (after he kept me up late talking), so I was late to get coffee with him.

Since I had a mental breakdown and told him I would fail out of my program if he didn't leave him alone, he allowed me to take several weeks to just focus on school/my mental health and not talk to him.

Kimi and Darien walked into their first class, *Intro to Philosophy* together and took their seats next to one another. Students piled in, some quiet and some chatting among themselves. Darien's plan weighed heavily on Kimi's mind. She had already contacted Mr. Burgess and he okayed her coming by after her classes. The teacher walked in, a young man in his late 20's with shaggy light brown hair and glasses holding a thick stack of stapled papers. He walked with confidence up to the large board and introduced himself as Professor Danis. Kimi looked briefly at Darien who was leaning on his hand, watching her with a smile. She smiled back before pulling out her notebook and pen. 

Kimi's first day of classes went nicely. For the first day, each professor went over the course syllabus and class expectations. In each class everyone had to do a brief introduction of themselves, something Kimi hated with a passion but that was expected in a private, smaller university with smaller classrooms. Kimi pushed her earlier public speaking embarrassment out of her mind as she made her way down the familiar long corridor and to the coffee shop inside Mr. Scott's business. She found the partially secluded table Mr. Burgess had sat her at last time and took her seat. She took a deep breath and looked around nervously. 

Within a few minutes Mr. Burgess walked in with Mr. Scott trailing behind looking pompous and smug. Kimi suppressed her desire to scowl. Mr. Burgess stood by the table and greeted her with a polite smile as Mr. Scott took his seat in front of her once more. He sat back confidently and smiled at her before leaning forward clasping his hands. 

""I wasn't expecting you to contact me so soon Ms. Wayland...have you come to your senses already? Are you ready to make a deal that will benefit us both?""

Kimi took out her cell phone and tossed it on the table in front of Mr. Scott angrily. 

""Did you send this to scare me?"" She asked in a quivering voice. 

Mr. Burgess and Mr. Scott both looked shocked. Mr. Scott motioned for Mr. Burgess to pick up the phone and check out what Kimi was referring to. Mr. Burgess picked the phone up gently and looked at the screen, his eyes widening. Under the video of a blurred out Kimi being attacked in the alley way was a message, 

*Don't be like the others and sell your soul for money.* 

Whil holding the phone another message came through. 

*I'm watching you, make the right choice!* 

Mr. Burgess showed the phone to Mr. Scott who snatched it. He read it over and over his face taking on a serious appearance. 

""When did you get this?"" Mr. Scott asked handing the phone back to Kimi. 

""A few minutes before I contacted Mr. Burgess. Did you send this as some kind of game?!"" Kimi demanded shaking. 

""Ms. Wayland, I assure you, I'm far too old for games."" 

""Mr. Burgess has the computer guy made any progress?"" Mr. Scott whispered. 

Suddenly both Mr. Burgess's and Mr. Scott's phones pinged in unison. They both checked them, their faces taken on horrified appearances. On their screens a list of Mr. Scotts past cover-ups. Mr. Scott jumped up from his chair knocking it backward. People began staring and whispering. Mr. Burgess picked up the chair and attempted to calm Mr. Scott by gently grabbing his shoulder and whispering something in his ear. 

""What is going on?!"" Kimi demanded shaking in fear. 

Mr. Scott's face went completely pale as he glanced blankly at his phone. He sat back down calmly and cleared his throat. Before he could speak Kimi, Mr. Burgess and his phone pinged off simultaneously. They all checked with shaking hands. The message read in bold letters, 

*I'm always watching!* 

""I'm done with this! I'm done with all of it! I just want to be a normal student and live a normal life!"" Kimi said fearfully. 

Mr. Scott angrily placed his phone in his pocket before whispering to Mr. Burgess to get security to do a detailed sweep of the building. He also demanded that he hire more tech guys to find the individual sending the messages and videos. Mr. Burgess quickly ran off making phone calls along the way. Kimi looked around nervously. 

""Ms. Wayland, we will get to the bottom of this I promise!"" 

""No, I'm finished. I want nothing to do with you or your son. Stay away from me!"" Kimi said standing up dramatically.

""Ms. Wayland wait! We still need to come to an agreement..."" Mr. Scott said desperately standing up. 

Kimi showed Mr. Scott the message on her phone that read, ""I'm always watching!"" before shoving it in her purse. 

""Like I said, I'm done. You don't have to worry about me saying anything. I just want to go back to my normal life. Please stay away from me...and please tell your rapist son and his friends to stay away from me. I don't want to be involved with this mess any longer."" Kimi said with her eyes watering. 

Kimi quickly turned and ran as Mr. Scott watched her. She exited the coffee shop just as Mr. Scott's phone rang. He answered angrily and was met with the panicked voice of his attorney Matt Fleming. 

""Armand... it's all over! Someone just exposed everything!"" Mr. Fleming yelled. 

""What are you saying?! What do you mean everything?!"" Mr. Scott demanded. 

""I mean everything...it's all out there, the contracts, payoffs, videos, and voice recordings! It's all online. You, Senator Ryan, the Ashers, Mr. Burgess and even myself... We're all fucked."" Mr. Fleming said despairingly.

""Something has to be done! Do something!"" Mr. Scott screamed angrily into the phone, no longer caring about drawing attention. 

""It was just released, not even 10 minutes ago! I've already started the process of having the info removed but once it's out there...it's out there."" 

""Was it the Gordon's or Hernandez's...or one of the pieces of shit that worked here?!"" Mr. Scott asked shaking furiously. 

""I don't think so. I did as you asked and had people keep an eye on them. They've been quiet and kept with the deals. This is bad Armand, really fucking bad!"" 

Mr. Scott sat back down, his shoulders slumped, his face pale and his mouth dry. Mr. Burgess ran back into the coffee shop in a panic with his phone pressed tightly to his ear. Mr. Scott placed his phone on the small table and sat back. He leaned his head back and started laughing before placing his face into his hands. 

""Everything I've worked hard for is about to be destroyed..."" He whispered through manic laughter. 

Kimi exited her Uber, returning to the apartment complex and made her way to Darien's apartment. He was waiting for her by his front door. She stood staring at him with a huge smile before running full speed and jumping into his arms. He lifted her up, hugging her right. 

""You did great Kimi."" He whispered in her ear. 

""So did you, he didn't suspect me at all. You should have seen his stupid face."" She whispered back. 

""Now let's just sit back and watch the show."" Darien responded softly putting Kimi down. 

She stared up at him and smiled beautifully causing him to blush from face to neck. Many feelings and thoughts flowed through her mind. Darien was smart but sneaky, she needed to be careful around him. His plan to send threatening messages to her and Mr. Scott while in Mr. Scott's presence was a smart move. Darien clearly cared a lot about her, but what that meant, Kimi didn't fully know. She wasn't sure of her own feelings. The only thing she was sure of is that watching Mr. Scott and her attackers suffer was great but it wasn't enough. She still had her own plans to see through concerning them.

""I don't think so. I did as you asked and had people keep an eye on them. They've been quiet and kept with the deals. This is bad Armand, really fucking bad!"" 

Mr. Scott sat back down, his shoulders slumped, his face pale and his mouth dry. Mr. Burgess ran back into the coffee shop in a panic with his phone pressed tightly to his ear. Mr. Scott placed his phone on the small table and sat back. He leaned his head back and started laughing before placing his face into his hands. 

""Everything I've worked hard for is about to be destroyed..."" He whispered through manic laughter. 

Kimi exited her Uber, returning to the apartment complex and made her way to Darien's apartment. He was waiting for her by his front door. She stood staring at him with a huge smile before running full speed and jumping into his arms. He lifted her up, hugging her right. 

""You did great Kimi."" He whispered in her ear. 

""So did you, he didn't suspect me at all. You should have seen his stupid face."" She whispered back. 

""Now let's just sit back and watch the show."" Darien responded softly putting Kimi down. 

She stared up at him and smiled beautifully causing him to blush from face to neck. Many feelings and thoughts flowed through her mind. Darien was smart but sneaky, she needed to be careful around him. His plan to send threatening messages to her and Mr. Scott while in Mr. Scott's presence was a smart move. Darien clearly cared a lot about her, but what that meant, Kimi didn't fully know. She wasn't sure of her own feelings. The only thing she was sure of is that watching Mr. Scott and her attackers suffer was great but it wasn't enough. She still had her own plans to see through concerning them.

For the past 3-5 years, I barely left the house because of body dysmorphia and other issues. Then COVID happened, which only made me more isolated. When I finally resolved those issues and started going out again, I became addicted to being outside. Now, I just can’t stand staying at home.

The problem is, every time I go out, I end up losing money. I’ll grab a coffee, spend on transportation, or find some other way to drain my wallet. Staying home would be so much better for my mental health and finances, but I just can’t sit still. ",1,1735861484.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown and can't function. I feel stuck, confused, completely emotionally incapacitated, and unable to think.","I am long-distance with my partner, and I left our trip (I flew across the world to see him) early because he ruined it by having several emotional/verbal abuse episodes where he flew off the handle with rage, yelling at me, calling me names, throwing things around, and threatening to tear the whole apartment up when I told him I was feeling scared. The fight started because I left a dish in the sink and was tired from not sleeping well (after he kept me up late talking), so I was late to get coffee with him. For multiple days, he kept me awake for hours arguing/fighting.  He followed me throughout the house, berating and yelling at me, refusing to leave me alone when I told him to leave. He's had a lot of these types of episodes in the past, and I am beyond exhausted. It's ruined my holidays, destroyed my ability to study for finals for a graduate program I'm in, and has generally left me feeling emotionally destroyed. He's never hit me or physically harmed me, but he's caused me a lot of emotional distress and has made me feel very uneasy (borderline unsafe sometimes) with his out-of-control behavior on several occasions. In addition, he makes jokes about killing me daily, slaps/bites me harder than I like, and puts his hands around his neck pretending to strangle me (without any pressure) sometimes.

I flew home last week and am finally able to relax without waking up with anxiety wondering what mood he'll be in. After a lot of guilt-tripping, blowing my phone up getting upset if I didn't respond right away, and keeping me on the phone for many hours (causing me to miss dinner with my family over the holidays), he finally agreed to give me some space while we both seek professional help and couples counseling. I am seeing a psychologist (I hope to talk with them about this relationship and how it's affecting me because I have crippling anxiety) and he's seeing a psychiatrist to work on anger management and impulse control for his ADHD, depression, and PTSD (which apparently causes him to have these anger outbursts). Since I had a mental breakdown and told him I would fail out of my program if he didn't leave him alone, he allowed me to take several weeks to just focus on school/my mental health and not talk to him.

I am seriously considering ending the relationship even though I still deeply love and am trauma-bonded with him. Even though he can be a jerk, he is still my best friend and extremely kind/loving to me *most* of the time (otherwise, I wouldn't stay). He showers me with love, compliments, affection, believes in me, encourages and motivates me in my goals, and is generally kind and loving when he's not being cruel. My brain fog, confusion, and anxiety is absolutely crippling right now. Studying/concentrating is basically impossible and I'm afraid I'll fail or be kicked out of my graduate program because I'm so nonfunctional. I feel like I'm walking around in a stupor and I don't know how to get out of it. I also feel like I'm insane/overreacting/delusional/psychotic (as he's told me many times during our fights) because he never hit me so the abuse isn't real/isn't that bad.",4,1735861452.0,abusesurvivors,3,1.0,False

She knew Tamas was aware of it, but chose to do nothing, continuing his stubborn decades long distance from his father. There was no convincing a man like him of anything, it was pointless, but she couldn’t have her husband come to regret it one day that he never reconciled with his father or at least cleared the air. She had to try. 

She’d start with the return address on the letter. It was from within the city, she figured she could stop by when she went out for groceries. The following day she did, her search leading her to a crumby apartment building in the centre of Mada, apartment seven.

Coming up to the wooden door, she lightly knocked on it and stepped back a respectable distance.

A man soon opened the door, just enough to peak through, “Who are you?”

“Kíra Csama… I believe I’m your daughter in law.”

“Are you now?” The man opened the door more. In an instant Kíra could see the resemblance  to her Tamas, except about twenty years his senior, with thinning grey hair. Still not a man whose days looked numbered. In those moments his expression softened, with Kíra seeing a grin come to the man’s face not unlike Tamas’ seldom seen, “Well come in. I’m Valentin but you seem to know that.”

Kíra took him up on that, coming inside the door. Inside was pretty bare bones. There was small messy bed, dresser and a chair with a single chair. A small kitchenette was by the door. 

“I’m sorry about the state of this place. I wasn’t expecting company. I can get you some coffee?”

“I’m good thank you.” Kíra answered, “Tamas got your letter… I’m sorry. I’m sorry about your…”

“My liver?” He chortled, “You got nothing to be sorry about, I did that to myself and now I’m paying the price.” He seemed to accept the grim implications but soon changed the subject, “Is Tamas going to see me?”

“No, he’s not.”

Valentin sighed, “Sad but I can’t say I blame him.”

“He was too stubborn to even tell me. I just can’t bear the thought that one day he may regret that.”

“Not with how I was, how he remembers me. Everything he’s said about me, well it’s true.”

“You don’t seem that way now.” Kíra said.

He smiled, it wasn’t often someone thought the best of him, “Maybe not, but it’s too little, too late.” Valentin replied, “I’ve destroyed my life, hurt so many people, my son included.”

“What if I said I could get him to see you?”

“I doubt you could. I don’t know why I wrote to him. There is no way he would willingly be in the same room as me…”

“Maybe not, but the least we can do is try. Even if you just came over one day, you could try to talk this out.”

°Avoid dehydration seriously
°Keep blood levels in check, act accordingly if necessary.
°Sleep very well

Have coffee job for flexible hours. Pursuing IT degree in Cybersecurity but that’s probably going to change unless I decide to make school my life for another year or two.
Sounds like an obvious choice I know but I genuinely have never been interested in anything I’ve tried studying in school. From engineering, to IT I am not into it. I suppose IT is the most interested I’ve been in a degree but it’s still just not engaging to me at a deep enjoyable level. 

Am I supposed to force myself to be interested in something I’m supposed to do the rest of my life?
Is that just growing up and maturing?

I’ll be honest and acknowledge I’m not the most mature person in the world no doubt there. But as I work hard in school on a subject I care very little of in comparison to my hobbies, I see other young guys my age(friends, people online) with no degree or at best something like a communications degree or whatever loving their lives, going out most days having their own place to stay.
I don’t know how they afford to live on their own with bs jobs and live happy lives.
I do the simple math on paper and if I got a bs job and moved out and tried to continue school It wouldn’t look good on paper let’s just say.

Where I’m at mentally is I feel I really need to move out and take school and living entirely into my own financial hands. Perhaps I’d take school more seriously if I was the one paying for it. 

But don’t know any type of full-time let alone part-time jobs that would allow me to afford all that on my own where I’d still have the mental stamina at the end of the day to do school work.

Parents strongly advise against anything like that and believe I should stay at home another year to try and finish school then get a good job then move out. Ofc that makes so much sense it pisses me off.

Kiddo in my head says “oh just write a hit song and I’m good” I love music, play piano, guitar fairly well, everyone compliments my voice at karaoke for what that’s worth. Genuinely never felt compatible with school but maybe I just haven’t grown up yet. 

I don’t know if I’m asking for advise or just venting tbh but I feel like I am wasting my 20s at my parents house. At least I have a free home to live in and I have supportive parents so I’m very lucky in that sense. But just everything seems off.

1hs831t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1hs831t/my_friend_i_created_a_viral_gossip_girl_persona/,My Friend & I Created a Viral Gossip Girl Persona on Facebook in HS (2008-09). The Cops and Local Press Got Involved.  AMA.,"Summer after Sophomore year of high school (2008) my friend and I became rather prolific “catfishers”, operating under the same Facebook account—as a hot 16 y/o blonde “Ellen” who was moving here (undisclosed, USA) from the UK soon and wanting to make some friends / get to know her new city before school started in the Fall. Of course, the term “catfishing” didn’t become a thing until years later - we just called it *having fun fucking with people*.    
     
We/Ellen had our tentacles in dozens of high schools, mostly those located within city limits, but some in suburbia as well. This helped us establish mutual friends, to gain more followers faster and solidify our authenticity. Additionally, our fake persona was actually a real girl from the UK who gave us the O.K. to use anything and everything posted on her Bebo account. Old pictures and new.
    
At first we carried on convos with boys around our age (15-17), some we knew personally, some we fringe-knew, and some we didn’t know at all/complete strangers. Maybe 50+ that first month in June - masterfully dividing and conquering these faux relationships and their friend groups. Basically all of whom who wanted to meet up in person at some point—whether that be the day after Ellen officially moved to town in late July, for coffee after school once the year starts (late August), or at “my boy’s party” after the first football game, which of course meant someone’s parents’ basement. Obviously these meetups would never happen but it was fun to make fake plans, *having fun fucking with people*.    
     
Some convos went deeper than others, some romantic in nature, some friend-zoney who just wanted to chat. Either way, we were getting the tea, and lots of it. By the end of summer, Ellen was *known*. Our convos with boys exclusively turned into convos with everyone. A few girls reached out to us inquiring about our off-the-record messages (or “DMs” as they’re known now) with their guy friends and wanted to know more—who Ellen was, what was she about, etc. Once we realized we could navigate the female psyche just as well, we dove the fuck in. Getting piping hot goss from all high schools, public and private within a 20-mile radius, and from all walks of life. The preppy kids, the jocks, the IB kids, the stoners, the Jack & Jill’ers and even the weird camo-wearing hunter types—everyone. 50+ turned into 200+ by end of summer. Things were getting a bit sticky especially with us, for the most part, navigating our own set of relationships separately.     
     
Ellen would be enrolling into our rival high school (10-min drive down the road) so she’d be close enough to people we knew IRL but not TOO close. We avoided having ***convo*** convos with anyone who went there, just adding those kids as friends and nothing more. However as syllabus week (first week of new school year) came to a close, we realized we formed way too many relationships with people from our actual school + nearby schools who had friends that went there. They wanted eyes on the prize. Ellen, in the flesh.     
    
We went dark on (or “ghosted” as the kids say these days) those most eager to meet Ellen and/or had close ties to her new school. It was still fun but not nearly as so. Either way, we were getting bored and wanted to shake things up. So during Winter break Junior year (Dec ‘08) we hatched up a plan for new-Ellen. 

She/WE would become a gossip-girl type character, commenting witty things under photo-dumps or under wall posts, as well as drip releasing info we gathered over the past 6 months with beautifully-crafted GG style postings.    We never made a formal announcement on this switch to new-Ellen, just sorta trickled out the comments and a few posts at first.      
     
Old-Ellen operated in the shadows. New-Ellen was out and proud;  brazen but not too brash, comedically clever, and cool with everyone — all in all, a wildcard. In hindsight, new-Ellen (and old-Ellen to some degree) was all the things we secretly publicly aspired to be.     
      
She became an icon of sorts, In-person/in-classroom and online. Some people loved her, understanding completely what new-Ellen was about and feeding us info from that weekend’s shenanigans. Some didn’t care one way or another, just there to lurk. And some hated her, wanting her to be outed or banned from FB altogether. For the most part, those individuals were the ones we had fooled/conversed intimately with over the summer. But they’re not gonna blow that cover, no, no, - it was because “she’s spreading lies” or whatever.      
     
By start of Senior year Ellen was ***known AF***, infamous in a way, at least from our 15ft purview. Us two quiet and quirky gals would regularly overhear classroom clique circles talking about Ellen’s comments and/or speculating when her next wall post would drop or what tea she’d spill next. We felt like we finally had friends, as strange as that sounds. Whilst the notoriety made me want to tame down our online rhetoric, it fueled my partner in crime’s, with her comments/posts getting more and more revealing.  By Thanksgiving break (late Fall ‘09), the cops sent out a warning via the literal local newspaper (I still have the article saved down if Mods need proof) and had our admin send out a school-wide press release via email. All of which essentially said **SHUT THIS SHIT DOWN. NOW.**    
     
It’s true, mad moms do make things happen, and fuckin quick too! The abortion that broke the camel’s back we’d say…      
    
And no, we were never caught :)

Just a few things to keep in mind to understand the context of these guides and to avoid disappointment.

Some products may have mistypes (I believe every recent product guide since BBW started making these have all had at least 1 typo of some kind). For example, you might have a fragrance that has the key icon that it will be coming in body care, but ends up never being released in that product form and was just a typo.

Everything is also subject to change, sometimes certain product forms of a fragrance may not come out due to manufacturing issues or anything of that sort, so some fragrances or forms of it may not all release.

Any scent that does not have a ""Coming Spring 2/3"" note under it on the product guide will be available sometime during the Spring 1 timeline. Just a note that sometimes fragrances that are kept around even after Semi-Annual, or that are released during the Spring season can absolutely end up having their production entirely halted, and there may not be anymore replenished of a certain fragrance or a certain product form at any point during its life being available on the shelves (including Spring). 

Outside of this product guide, online exclusive items are generally not shown, and certain product forms (such as room sprays, car fragrance scents, etc.) will may not be directly shown so we will not know what is going on with those until they actually release. And a fragrance may have the Body Care icon listed for it as the product form it will release in, but sometimes it may be printed on there to include things like hand sanitizers, rather than a full FFM, Body Cream, and Body Wash collection.

He knew the routes they took when they got morning coffee, the sports teams their children were on, their spiritual gurus, and even their preferred dentists.

The stars knew him too, because it was impossible not to. Frank was a constant fixture in Hollywood, and some stars found it amusing they saw him even when they moved to their estates in other parts of the country, other parts of the world. Everyone assumed he hustled, and no one was scared because Frank followed everyone. He couldn’t be a stalker or unhealthily obsessed, because he was showed everyone an equal amount of undue attention.

The police questioned him after the death of a golden era movie star, a nonagenerian who he’d photographed on her last morning walk, with her pet Maltese. The internet had eaten it up, because Iris Beckman had smiled at him. They loved that she’d lived a long life, and that she had been so happy even a few hours before dying in her sleep. 

It continued a few more times. Celebrities tended to die early, so even when he had caught a picture of a sports star a few minutes before he died in a flaming crash on the freeway, no one even gave it a second thought. The problem happened when two celebrities had died in the same hour, on two different continents. And Frank had taken both of them. Then the police started digging, finding other times so close together he couldn’t have traveled between the two places. They called Frank in for questioning, and Frank went. While he was in the interrogation room, another celebrity died, another last picture came to light. And Frank had taken that picture too. 

The police let Frank go, and for the first time, Frank was scared. If one Frank was under suspicion, it meant all of them were.",2,1735860793.0,arushi,0,1.0,False

before i went to her house i had really bad cramps in my lower abdomen but i thought it was from taking laxatives and it went away after a bit so i thought i was good. we pulled an all nighter and had some coffee in the morning, i got really n* and had a panic attack but i wanted to calm myself and thought to myself it was just because my stomach gets upset easily and i had coffee on an empty stomach. I ate some of my safe food and everything was fine. a few hours later my friend said she felt kind of weird, comparing it to the time she was hospitalized in south africa with some flu-ish virus, but minus the n*, i was still feeling okay though, just that i couldn't really eat because my stomach felt gassy and i just didn't want to risk sending myself into another state of panic.

fast forward a couple hours later, i get home and immediately fall asleep and when i woke up like 3-5 hours later (i can't pinpoint how long i slept) i felt like i was catching a cold or something, my throat felt sore and dry, my head and limbs hurt, i was feeling chilly and hot simultaneously and just felt really exhausted and crappy altogether. at first i thought it came from a lack of sleep, but then my mom said she felt like she was coming down with something as well and also told me she had a fever.

i asked my friends if they also felt sick and one said she kinda does, but the real killer was my best friend saying that her 2-3 year old niece had a fever AND I WAS WITH HER AND READ HER A STORY ON NYE (3 days ago).

Oh, r/NevilleGoddard, the glorious subreddit where logic gets evicted, replaced by a parade of wishful thinkers trying to Jedi mind-trick the universe into giving them free stuff. Forget the “law of attraction”—this is the law of let’s all pretend we’re not broke and lonely while repeating affirmations into the void.

First, let’s give a shoutout to the believers. You’ve got people on here acting like they’re rewriting the Matrix because they visualized a parking spot for 10 seconds and—gasp—found one. Congrats, Karen, you’ve officially mastered the mystical art of basic probability. Next stop? Enlightenment through lottery tickets.

Then there’s the “success stories,” which are basically the subreddit’s version of bedtime fairy tales. “I imagined my SP texting me, and two months later, they liked my IG story!” Amazing! Your manifestation powers got someone to accidentally tap their phone while scrolling half-asleep. Clearly, the universe is working overtime to make your dreams come true.

Let’s not forget the real gems: people manifesting exes back after being ghosted harder than a haunted house. “How do I get my SP to unblock me after I ruined their life?” Bro, maybe stop pretending the universe owes you a do-over and learn about boundaries instead. But no, why do that when you can sit in front of a candle chanting “They love me” like a spiritual knockoff of Gollum?

Oh, and Neville himself? This man realized he could monetize people’s desperation by slapping “spiritual” on top of common sense and calling it a revelation. Y’all treat him like the Yoda of manifestation when he’s just the OG life coach with a thesaurus. His teachings boil down to “think rich, be rich,” yet here you are visualizing your dream mansion while splitting rent with three roommates and a cat.

And the comments section—chef’s kiss. It’s like a circus of delusion.
	•	“I manifested a free coffee!” No, Brenda, the barista felt bad because you looked like you just cried in your car.
	•	“I imagined getting my crush to notice me!” Yeah, after you stared at them so long, they got uncomfortable. Congratulations, you manifested awkwardness.
	•	“I’m trying to shift into a reality where I’m a millionaire.” Good luck with that, Kevin. The only thing shifting is your credit score—downward.

And let’s talk about the toxic positivity. If it’s not working, it’s your fault. “You’re thinking too negatively,” they say. Right, because the universe is apparently a middle school drama queen who only delivers blessings if you smile 24/7 and avoid critical thinking. Meanwhile, everyone’s sitting there broke, single, and wondering why their vision boards haven’t updated to 2-day shipping.

Ultimately, r/NevilleGoddard is where self-help goes to die. It’s a digital group hug for people who’d rather pretend they’re manifesting their dream life than, you know, actually doing something productive. If delusion paid the bills, this subreddit would be full of billionaires. But instead, they’re here, “assuming the feeling” of success while the universe hits unsubscribe.

Thanks for coming to my TED Talk. Now excuse me while I “manifest” y’all some critical thinking skills.",8,1735860559.0,NevilleGoddardCritics,0,1.0,False

I never drink, I never smoke, I don't drink coffee nor tea, my diet is totally balanced. I do not take any medication. I just take a magnesium supplement and a baby aspirin daily.

I get dental cleanings twice a year, I floss with cocofloss daily, and I brush 2x/day with a fancy Oral-B electric toothbrush.

I swear I am doing all the right things.

A little over a year ago these stains started appearing on my teeth. I went to a get a cleaning, and they started reappearing literally a few days later. Since then, I have gone to FIVE dental cleanings because they just will not stop re-appearing. 

They are all over my teeth. I have seen 3 dentists. They all confirmed I do not have ANY gum issues (gums are totally healthy), I don't have any weird saliva bacteria (did a saliva test), and the stains themselves are a normal type of stain (they are removable with normal dental tools). 

HOWEVER, not a single dentist can tell me why these stains keep reappearing on my teeth despite me being so on top of my dental hygiene at home, and despite literally getting five cleanings in the past year.

I am so confused and frustrated by this problem. I have tried baking soda at home a couple times but 1. that's not sustainable for the enamel and 2. it's so hard to properly clean my own teeth given the scale of this issue.

In case it's important for context: I'm a female mid 30s.

She has motivations. She has a backstory that fuels them. She is highly relevant to the message.

Vitamin c made my pain worse, also when I drink coffee, soda or juice my bladder pain worsens.

Fosfomycin, probiotics and Fluconazole+Tindazole did nothing or helped maybe by placebo effect for half a day.

And the estriol cream gave me crazy moods wings and made me bleed at the 4th application (period kinda bleeding , but it isn't my period)

1hs7sf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hs7sf1/the_elevator_doesnt_stop_on_certain_floors_i_wish/,"The elevator doesn’t stop on certain floors, I wish I never found out why","I saw my little boy die right in front of me. It’s a moment burned into my mind—his tiny frame crumpling at the bottom of the stairs, the sickening crack of bone, the silence that followed. God the silence. 

I know that is an odd way of starting this, but I just mean—I hate silence. Silence has a way of stretching moments like that, making them infinite. The paramedics said it was an accident, but the look in their eyes told me they didn’t believe it. Neither did my wife. 

It’s been years, but the sound of silence still gets under my skin. So much so that when I was a kid, my parents used to tell me to turn off the TV and go to bed, but I couldn’t sleep without something playing in the background—a sitcom, the hum of a fan, anything to keep the quiet away. I even slept with headphones on for many years. Silence stretches things out, makes my mind wander to places I don’t want to go. 

That’s why this building is so hard to live in. It’s dead quiet. No neighbors arguing through thin walls. No music playing in the distance. Just this oppressive, suffocating silence. I don’t even hear footsteps in the hall. Not once in the six months I’ve lived here.

The apartment is part of a government housing program. They called it temporary, just a way to help me get back on my feet after everything fell apart. The paperwork was vague, but I didn’t have the luxury of asking questions. I needed somewhere cheap, and this place was free.

It’s old. Wallpaper peeling in the corners kind of old. Water stains creeping across the ceilings kind of old.. It’s horrible. My unit is basic—one bedroom, a tiny kitchen, a window that overlooks a cracked courtyard. At first, I thought it was decent, all things considered. Then I started noticing the dust.

It’s everywhere. No matter how much I clean, it comes back. A thin, gray film that coats every surface overnight. It’s in the hallways too. Everything feels untouched, like the building’s been abandoned for years. It’s like the building is a place where they put you to get you out of society—then forget about you in the process. 

I told myself the place must be mostly empty. It would explain the silence, right? But then I noticed other things—like how the elevator skips certain floors. The button for the third floor is there, but it doesn’t light up when you press it.

I thought maybe it was broken. Until the night the elevator stopped there on its own.

It happened a few days ago. I was coming back late from a walk in the lobby, trying to shake off another sleepless night, when the elevator stopped on one of those “inaccessible” floors, the third floor. I didn’t press the button. I didnt even realise it had not reached my fourth floor yet. 

Then the doors opened. 

There was a faint buzz coming from the fluorescent lights inside, one of them kept flickering at irregular intervals.

It didn’t look like the rest of the building. The entire area was bright white and smelt like rubbing alcohol, the kind that would burn your nose. Very clinical. I eventually stepped out, half-expecting someone to jump out and yell “Boo!” like it was some elaborate prank. But the hall was empty.

And silent. 

I walked forward, my footsteps seemed to echo through the hall. There were doors lining the walkway, but all of them were locked. They had little glass windows, but since the lights were off in their rooms I couldn’t see in. One door stood out in particular though, a metal door directly at the end. A soft hum came from behind it, the only sound breaking the stillness.

When I opened the door, I found an office. It was as run down as the other floors in the building. Rusted filing cabinets, a desk cluttered with papers, but with a modern computer and monitor showing security cameras from a bunch of different rooms on each floor. Someone was spying on us. At that moment I realised there were actually a lot of other residents. I looked down and saw a coffee sitting on top of the desk, still hot and steaming. Someone had just been in here.

Then I saw the files.

There were stacks of them, spilling onto the floor. All labelled ‘CONFIDENTIAL.’ The top one caught my eye because it had my name on it.

My hands shook as I opened it. Inside were pages of typed notes, observations written in sterile, clinical language. Words like “delusional episodes” jumped out at me.

I flipped through and found photos of myself. One was from years ago—me smiling, holding my son, Thomas. He was so small, so full of life. The second photo was different. I looked older, haggard. Wearing all white clothing. Thomas wasn’t in that one.

The notes grew darker: “Fixation on deceased son.” “Fixated on growing silence.” My throat tightened. Someone was clearly trying to screw with my head. Someone was trying to frame me. I am not crazy. 

I dropped the file back onto the desk and backed away. A noise behind me snapped me out of my thoughts.

Footsteps.

I spun around, but the hallway was empty. The only sound was the fluorescent light buzzing overhead.

I grabbed the folder and bolted for the elevator.

I couldn’t sleep that night, obviously. I sat at my kitchen table, the folder spread out in front of me for what felt like hours.

The notes felt like they’d been written by a stranger, someone who’d been watching me through a warped lens. Someone wanted me to be sick. They described things I didn’t remember doing, conversations I didn’t recall having. 

The next morning, I went to the building manager’s office in the lobby.

I demanded to know who keeps the files on residents. Demanded to know what’s going on—He looked baffled so I held up the file for him to see I was not crazy.

He frowned, looking genuinely confused, as if it were me who wrote it. “We don’t keep any files like that,” he said. “Where did you even find that?”

I didn’t answer. His confusion seemed real, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was lying. He had to be right? I am not crazy. 

When I went back up to my room I tried the elevator’s third floor button again, but nothing would light up. 

That night, I woke to a sound outside my apartment door.

A soft rustling, like someone sliding something beneath the door.

I crept to the peephole, but no one was there. When I looked down, I found another folder lying on the floor.

It didn’t have my name on it, so I thought that it wasn’t mine at first.

This one was labeled “Administrative Notes #427.”

I opened it. Inside was what looked like records of staff rotations for a particular room. One page stood out:
""Patient #427 displays increased curiosity about restricted areas. Recommended measures: heightened observation and restricted access to communal areas. Check in through in-room security cameras periodically.""

The blood drained from my face. Patient #427. My apartment number.

I looked around the room trying to find a camera, but there was none. I must have torn apart the entire place trying to find one. I am not crazy. Someone is screwing with me. I don’t know why.  

I don’t know what’s real anymore.

I hope this reaches someone out there. Most websites are blocked on the buildings wifi, but they don’t realise there are ways to get around it. 

So now, I’m writing this from the desk in my apartment, my door locked, every light in the room turned off so they can’t see me. 

I keep telling myself this is all a misunderstanding. That it’s just some bureaucratic mistake, because I am not crazy.

But deep down, I think I know the truth about what’s happening here.

This isn’t an apartment building. It never was. 

And I’m not a tenant. 

I’m a patient, in their fucked up experiment. 

I am not crazy. 

They’re watching me.

I am not.

I need to work in this room as well so the desk must also stay. Thoughts on how to make this room look less awkward and maximize seating? Also thoughts on the rug size and coffee table size? I’ll be getting a new one of both so very open to ideas. You can assume all the items on the right including the media console will be gone but the white block is an island so there needs to be room for the chairs to come out as well.

People say Oprah, Seinfeld, name a rich celebrity.   All wrong.  It was me.

Here is the story.....

I was in my home relaxing and I received a phone call from an unknown number.

I answered anyway.  A gentleman introduces himself and asked if I was so&so which I confirmed to him.  He says that he works for a marketing company in Boston I think and wants to talk to me about my AMEX Platinum card.

My spidey sense is now on high alert.   All I had to do was wait until he starts asking personal questions in order to break into my account. 

To my great surprise and relief, he did not.

He tells we that his marketing company has been hired by American Express to market test a new product/card.   He did not tell me much more about it.  I was still very skeptical.   Then he said that I should expect a package in a few days.

Sure enough a package is delivered three days later.  The box is labeled #101.   I studied Marketing when I was in B-school, so I know that you never number tests in order.     I just got a feeling from the guy that I was his first test subject.  I might have been his only one.  

I open the box and there is a Black AMEX card and a diary.

The instructions asked that for one month I should keep a diary of my transactions.   What,when and where.  And most importantly I was to record the reactions to the card the moment that I presented it for payment.

So I did that.   At restaurants mostly, but shopping too.   And traveling.

I was eating out six days a week at great, well known restaurants and for about a year they would all tell me that they have not seen another black card.

So, I filled the Diary, sent it back and neve heard from them again. LOL

I was told to keep the card and they waived the annual fee for the next three years (about 3 I think)  then later on started charging me until it increased to full price.  The original fee was $1000, then increased to $2500, now $5000.

  
Why me?  I do not know.  When I was younger  I did some focus groups for them.    They paid well for that, it was easy money.   I was a trader making good dough.  I fit some profile they wanted to survey I guess..

  
I did not see another black card until about a year later.  I was eating lunch with friends at Coffee Shop and when the bill came a model friend from the UK threw hers on the pile.  I put mine on top of hers, she was very surprised.  It was funny.    The black card was released in Germany and the UK before the USA, fyi.",1,1735859780.0,u_Zardoz-Zed,0,1.0,False
1hs7kd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1hs7kd5/i_hate_the_concept_of_decaf_coffee/,I hate the concept of decaf coffee,"I’ve been on vacation with my parents recently. They drink SO MUCH coffee. First, it’s with a caffeinated cup in the morning. Then another one in the afternoon. Then, they drink a decaf cup in the evening.


At that point, I’m just like, *why?* You ALREADY had coffee, there is no need to drink a third one, decaf, just for the taste. JUST DRINK WATER


I don’t care if you like the taste of coffee. I genuinely think it only makes sense to drink it for the stimulating effect of staying awake. Otherwise, it stains your teeth, and the only good-tasting coffee for a lot of people (like said parents) is pumped with loads and loads of sugar, unless you’re part of the minority that would take decaf black coffee. It has no nutritional value either, and it dehydrates you greatly.


I feel the same way about other drinks too, like most juices and all sodas. I would only take a juice or a smoothie once in a while. Protein shakes have nutrition, so they’re fine. Otherwise, WATER! DRINK WATER! 


I get if you’ve been used to drinking coffee all of your life and now it’s a health concern, but seriously, CONVERT TO WATER!! It’d be a better use of your time AND a much better effect on your health. 


Fuck decaf coffee!!

EDIT: I didn’t think I’d need to clarify that I’m not genuinely offended 😭 The purpose of this post is that I think decaf coffee is an unnecessary product, not that I hate the people that drink it, and that water is a better substitute!

1hs7jun,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelancesuccesshub/comments/1hs7jun/8_best_practices_for_remote_working/,8 best practices for remote working,"Transitioning your team to fully remote work might be an appealing option — it certainly comes with desirable perks, and you've likely already seen other companies do the same. 

But before you make the switch, it's essential to know how to implement a remote workforce strategy. Setting remote work expectations can be challenging for employers, and managing remote employees comes with its own unique hurdles.

If you're employing a remote team, you should assess your current remote work strategy and consider whether you're following best practices.

Continue reading to learn the key challenges and benefits of remote work, along with our 12 best practices for remote working.

# What are the key challenges of remote work?

Managing remote teams is becoming increasingly common for employers, but it's not without difficulties. You need effective remote work policies in place to avoid significant obstacles. Consider the following key challenges of remote work: 

# Keeping regular hours

Traditional office hours typically go from nine to five, Monday through Friday. But employees working from home may find it more challenging to create a similar structure. In some instances, working from home has extended the work day by up to two and a half hours. 

# Maintaining personal connections

One of the main benefits of in-office work is connecting with co-workers. Conversely, working from home can sometimes feel isolating, and employees may feel disconnected from their teammates without adequate team building. 

# Hiring international employees

Whether an existing employee wants to move abroad or you're interested in hiring remote candidates from foreign countries, it can be time-consuming, risky, and expensive to hire international employees. Consider using a global staffing solution like Remote to easily hire candidates from all over the world. 

# Functioning as a team

Without an effective communications strategy, it can be difficult for your remote employees to remember they're participating in an entire team. Consider using tools like Slack, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams to ensure employees work together more effectively and have open lines of communication with one another. 

# Managing employees in different time zones

As you're hiring remote employees, you have the option to hire from all over the world. While this opens you up to an enormous candidate pool, having employees who live in different time zones can make it challenging to communicate effectively and set deadlines. 

# [12 remote work best practices](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01d72498331fb8e9ed)

Consider the following work-from-home best practices to ensure your organization continues running smoothly.

# 1. Set schedules for team meetings

One of the best practices for working from home is scheduling regular video team meetings. It's essential that your employees don't feel isolated or think to themselves, ""I'm the only one doing any work around here."" You can nip this in the bud by reminding them they're part of a team.

Through weekly calls, you're not wasting your employee's time with endless meetings. At the same time, you're still allowing your team to meet and discuss what they're working on.

They can also use this time to clarify any questions they may have and foster a good working environment amongst each other.

# 2. Provide employees with a flexible schedule and flexible hours

You'll have a far more productive team if you offer a flexible work schedule to your employees. While you should draft a policy around your business hours and what times employees are expected to be available, employees will be more empowered if they can control their work hours. 

According to a study from Owl Labs, employees feel more productive, balanced, and loyal to their companies when they have flexibility. 

In addition, remote workers typically work more than their in-office counterparts. Airtasker reports that employees who work from home work an average of 1.4 more days per month than those working in an office. This is because employees can get more done when they work around times that they feel productive.

# 3. Enable effective collaboration

The technology industry has the highest share of remote employees worldwide, with 67.75% of global tech industry employees working fully or mostly remotely. Unfortunately, however, one of the top concerns of tech leaders is enabling effective collaboration. 

Plus, 53% of people who work at home at least some of the time say remote working hurts their ability to feel connected with their co-workers. 

Here are two great ways to enable effective collaboration for remote teams: 

* **Implement the right tools.** Invest in reliable and user-friendly communication channels to allow teams to keep in touch. Enabling people to message in a Slack channel or talk face-to-face on a Zoom call are just a few examples. 
* **Organize** **virtual team-building activities****.** Help remote employees bond by hosting lighthearted team-building activities like online scavenger hunts or virtual coffee breaks. This helps build relationships between remote teams, ultimately contributing to successful teamwork and collaboration. 

# 4. Prioritize your remote company culture

On top of effective collaboration, tech leaders are concerned about preserving their organizational culture in hybrid and remote work environments. Why? Because it can be hard to create a strong company culture when employees are distributed around the world. 

However, maintaining a strong company culture is important for any business. It can increase motivation, improve job satisfaction, and boost employee retention.

The good news is that there are lots of ways you can improve your company culture with a remote team. Having regular catch-ups with remote team members, rewarding hard work, investing in professional development, and promoting a healthy work-life balance are just a few examples.

# 5. Don't skimp out on employee recognition

One of the primary drawbacks of remote work is a feeling of employee isolation. Therefore, it's essential for remote employers to show their employees how much they care and recognize their hard work. 

Whether you choose to do this with holiday bonuses, employee stock options, or corporate retreats, employee recognition programs matter to your workers. Employers who implement employee recognition programs experience a more than 31% reduction in voluntary employee turnover. 

Employee recognition should occur on a micro-level, with managers continually checking in with their subordinates, and on a macro-level, with your organization showing its appreciation for your entire team. 

# 6. Be proactive with potential cybersecurity threats

Preparing for potential cybersecurity threats is essential for employers of remote teams. When employees work onsite, they typically use company computers to perform their duties on a company-wide server.

However, remote teams often use personal computers and work laptops with fewer restrictions, which can ultimately lead to compromised security. According to a survey of IT professionals, 54% believed that remote companies are at a higher risk of cybersecurity threats than those whose operations occur in a central location. 

Best practices for remote work include regular training for all employees regarding cybersecurity and an IT project management team that oversees and manages the potential threats to your company.

# 7. Set aside time to discuss professional development with virtual employees

Show your employees that you care about the value they bring to your company by setting aside time to discuss their professional development. Building connections across departments and companies is easier in an office setting, and remote employees lose many opportunities to mingle face-to-face with supervisors in other business areas. 

Take time to find out how your virtual employees want to grow within your organization and what you can do to help them achieve their goals. 

Whether you provide employee scholarships for continued education, opportunities for cross-training, or mentorship programs, investing in your employees’ future will not only make them feel like valued members of your team, but it will also provide them with deeper insights into growing and improving your company.

# 8. Measure employee motivation

Fifty-five percent of organizations with hybrid and remote employees are concerned about not being able to see signs of demotivation among team members.  If you’re concerned about spotting demotivation in your remote workforce, here are some signs to look out for: 

* Frequent sick days 
* Reduced productivity
* Lack of engagement in calls and meetings
* Lack of focus 
* Negative comments or communications 

To turn things around and increase motivation, you can follow some of the steps we’ve already outlined here. Offering professional development, setting time aside to catch up, and focusing on employee recognition are all known to increase motivation and make employees feel valued as part of the team.

# 9. Make your company values clear

Your company values matter to your employees, and finding remote workers who will be a good fit is essential to the overall success of your business. By making your company values clear, you'll be sure to attract the right candidates.

One survey found that 77% of job-seekers care about company values so much that they take the company's culture into consideration before applying for a job. Consider making your company values more transparent with clear messaging regarding how your business positively impacts the world and the lives of its employees. 

Also, make sure to let the top talent know why they should work for you, highlighting items like fair wages, competitive benefits packages, and generous time off.

# 10. Promote employee engagement through team-building activities

Feelings of isolation are a running theme amongst remote teams, so providing employees with ample opportunities to engage with one another in a casual setting is very important. 

Team-building activities show that you value your employees as individuals — not just as workers — and that you want to foster an enriching environment where everyone gets along and feels like they're pulling together as a team. 

If your employees are all located in the same area, opt for a group bowling night or corporate retreat. Team-building activities can be challenging with a globally dispersed team, so you may have to get creative. Activities can include company-wide competitions with prizes, virtual movie nights, and more. 

# 11. Ensure employees have access to company resources

Having your remote workforce all on the same page is essential, but this can be difficult to gauge as your team continues to grow. Setting up a central location where your employees can access all the company resources they might need can help them stay up to speed with company expectations and save managers time. 

If you're hiring a globally distributed workforce, a global staffing solution like Remote can help.

Our software keeps all onboarding documents and company resources in one place and even allows all employees to access resources in their preferred language.

# 12. Keep tabs on productivity

With a remote team, you can’t simply walk past an employee’s computer and ask them how things are going. Instead, you need measures in place to ensure they’re working efficiently. 

This is where tracking productivity can help. 

If you keep tabs on productivity, you can be sure that your remote team members are completing the right tasks within the right time frames. This could involve setting monthly goals or holding regular check-ins to see how things are going.

However, tracking productivity can also backfire if handled incorrectly. Team members may feel micromanaged or scrutinized, for instance, if you monitor them too closely. The trick is knowing how to boost motivation and accountability without micromanaging and making life hard for them. 

Speak to employees directly about the best way to monitor their outputs without being overbearing. 

# The benefits of remote work for employers

When asked what kind of remote work structure employees would like to have, fully remote comes out on top.

One of the reasons that fully remote work is so popular is because of the day-to-day benefits employees receive — benefits they wouldn't be able to receive if they were required to go into the office each day (or even if their work follows a hybrid at-home and onsite model)

Here are the primary benefits of remote work for employees. All of them translate to a happier, more productive workforce that ultimately benefits employers. 

# Happier employees

A 2022 study conducted by Tracking Happiness surveyed 12,455 individuals and found that remote employees were as much as 20% happier than employees required to work in a traditional office environment. 

Working remotely directly impacts employees' lives in a positive way. Namely, it gives them a degree of freedom and control over their schedules and how they complete their work, which is difficult to achieve in a traditional work setting.

Furthermore, when employees are happy at work, their overall happiness improves. The average work week is 40 hours, which is a significant portion of one's waking life. It's no surprise that when employees are unhappy at work, this can make them generally unhappy. 

# Work-life balance

Research shows that when remote teams have a conducive work-from-home setup, their work-life balance is greater than when they're working in an office. In fact, 78% of remote workers say that their work-life boundaries are healthy.

But it's important to note that a positive work-life balance through remote work depends on the individual and the company's working conditions.

The key takeaway from this is that part of the benefits of remote working comes from flexibility. 

Of course, if employers don't trust that their workers will be productive and go on to micromanage them, their work-life balance will be reduced. But with the right workplace boundaries and team dynamic, remote work offers employees the potential for a significantly better work-life balance. 

# Employee retention

One significant benefit for employers who offer remote work is reduced employee turnover. Companies that have work-from-anywhere policies enjoy lower turnover than those that don’t. In addition, employees are willing to take pay cuts for more flexibility.

Remote working also increases employee retention by allowing employees to work from anywhere. Gone are the days when employees needed to consider finding a new job before moving to a new place. 

You can now hold on to your best employees while offering them the flexibility of living wherever they want, so long as they have a functioning internet connection.

# Is it time to make the switch to remote work? 

Switching to an entirely remote team provides your company with numerous benefits, such as improved employee happiness and retention. However, it's also crucial for companies to consider every aspect of managing a remote team.

Employing the above remote working tips can increase productivity in your workforce, ensure employees are satisfied, and protect your company's best interests down the road. They're recommended for any employer considering switching to a fully remote team.

Whenever you decide to make the switch, Remote is here to help. Download our guide to hiring remote employees to learn more about what your company can do to make this transition successful.

This happened to me a few hours ago and I am trying to figure out if I was scammed in some way so I can protect myself. I know that I made a mistake by loaning the stranger the phone and am beating myself up about it quite a bit. I would appreciate any advice about what to do now that this happened, and I definitely won't loan my phone again in the future.

**Here's what happened:** I was at a coffee shop. A woman approached me asking to borrow my phone (iPhone) to text her mom. She said her phone was broken (alarm bell 1). I asked if she wanted to call her mom and she said ""No, she only responds to text messages"" (alarm bell 2). Here is my mistake: I opened the text message app and handed her the phone. For approximately 2 seconds, I wasn't looking at what she did on the phone, and then I stood up and watched the screen, which was open to the text message app. She pressed send, handed the phone back to me, thanked me, and sat down at the coffee shop for another 20 minutes.

When she handed the phone back to me, I looked at the message she sent and all the rest of my alarm bells went off. It was SUPER scammy. It was an iMessage and said: ""Mommy this is \[XXX\] urgent $369 was stolen from my account. I need to get my car fixed and it's $800. Can you give me $300 to help? I'm sending my paycheck later can you confirm the balance is still $4000? I need it I'm trying to get apartment please confirm balance and send $300 right now. $369 was stolen from my account last night i've only had my paycheck 1 day""

*(She used an actual name, but I redacted it, and adjusted the amounts of $ asked)*

Here's what I've done already:

1. I dialed the number and it went to voicemail. The phone number is associated with a lawyer (cross-checked via the state's bar website, which lists this number under their attorney profile). I didn't leave a message. The number hasn't texted back.
2. I checked all my banking apps and Venmo. Nothing amiss there. Changed all the passwords.
3. I looked at my Safari history, outgoing calls, other text message threads. Nothing amiss. 

Am I missing something? Did I get scammed? Is there anything else I should be doing to protect myself? I am freaking out a little and feeling really dumb for loaning my phone.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

1hs79lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/demisexuality/comments/1hs79lg/well_its_finally_over/,"Well, it's finally over","I've talked a bit over the last 3-4 months on this sub on comments on a connection that I had with a girl. I've been struggling for years with this girl. She is just has the most beautiful soul of anyone I've ever met. We are such a match I've told myself over and over for the last two years as I get lost in her eyes as we talk about our similar niche hobbies or get lost in discussion at work for hours about random problems of practice. The way we can just go on and on like time is non existent had me enraptured from the day I met her. 

She reminded me how rare my feelings are. She was the first girl since high school that I ever had feelings for. This strong emotional connection and how much energy I have to invest to even acknowledge someone as a potential partner has made my love life so painfully agonizing. The anxiety once I realize that I have feelings for someone, how I can't even be myself around them because I have no clue how to act when I am in love and they haven't said in clear language that they feel the same, how those words feel so hollow when I look around at any representation in any media and how they almost feel as if they mean nothing to me other than two people having primal lust. She was my main hope to get free of that cycle. A girl I've known for years, that conversation after conversation she continued to surprise me and impress me and intrigue me and bring me on an intellectual journey of twists and turns every time she opens her mouth. The way she banters with the rest of our friends and coworkers in a group makes me want to proudly prance around with her around my arm across every friend group I've had and every friend group I would have in the future. The perfect blend of chaos and optimism, of roasts and put ups, its not some image I have build in my mind as someone whose infallible, its just someone that I adore every side that I've seen of her. 

  
At long last we had made plans to go out a few weeks ago. But I got sick with covid, so I had to cancel. Two weeks later, we rescheduled. But the day of she bailed, saying she got sick. Then today, a week after we had those plans, I asked her if she wants to go out Saturday. But she said no, she has to go grocery shopping and run errands. I know that she is just trying to let me down easy. I know that she's realized that I was planning on finally telling her how I feel, finally trying to at least get my feelings to reach her, maybe they would, if I just did it in this way, in this other way... I had a whole plot. She celebrates three kings day. I was going to get her 3 gifts, ending with a rose to ask her to be my girlfriend at the end of the celebration. It was going to be a night for the record books. Surely she would finally realize how perfect we would be together. 

  
We are such good friends, I can't even hate her. I've tried before but she always found a way to crawl on back. I started going to therapy because I can't get over my feelings for her, because I couldn't accept the few negative messages shes sent me. Because I couldn't get over the fact she would come after work to talk to me about random shit for hours on end, or how she would rely on me for seemingly mundane things just because. My coworkers saw it too, making comments, asking what's happening, asking what's happened. To the very end, one even mentioned that I should make a move, try something, that she feels like shes a third wheel when this girl was in the room with me. 



But thats just how she is. She showers me with attention because shes sweet and we are friends and she relies on me for work. The connection goes no further. I can't even fathom how I could possibly find someone else. Through the weeds of our on and off relationship I've gone on other dates which end in my crying on the way home about how unfair it is that she isn't the one besides me.

  
I even worked so hard on myself. Lost 20 pounds over the summer and overhauled my entire sense of fashion to fit in line with the type of person I actually am. I have a resolution to watch movies because I've never really cared for popular media to try and work on my cultural vocabulary so that people don't see my hobbies as boring. I'm taking Lexapro to try and deal with my anxieties when it comes to texting conversations and opening up to people. 

  
But how tf am I supposed to have feelings for someone I've seen 6 profile pictures of and a stupid ass caption and have talked to for 30 minutes on a coffee date? How the hell am I supposed to feel close to someone that I don't even know how they act around people other than me? How am I supposed to be a ""man"" and kiss some chick on the first date because we made each other laugh a few times over some stupid unfunny references and jokes????? Or just approach a random girl and smile and ask for their number or some shit and make some bullshit ass up to try and convince her shes the love of my life? Why because she has the same fucking eyes as 30 other people I walked by but shes the only one that happened to make eye contact with my ass?

  
I guess my life is just doomed. Any Wizards on the sub? I'll be joining you in a few years, because theres no fucking way that I fall for another person within 2 and a half years before I turn 30. Not a chance in fucking hell. 

  
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

1hs77uy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Renters/comments/1hs77uy/landlord_from_hell_put_responsibility_of_healthy/,Landlord from hell put responsibility of healthy pregnancy on me. Wtf?,"I've moved into an overpriced city apartment quickly due to a break up and mobility issues making it difficult to find somewhere suitable. 

My landlord has 0 boundaries and is cheap as hell, and doesnt seem to understand anything about her own property. She's now trying to break the lease a month in. Claiming I can't cope in the property alone due to my injury/mobility issues. Wtf. 

Firstly, when I moved in the hot water didn't work properly. Two plumbers said it needed looking at, she kept saying she'd bring someone out but telling me to stop playing with timer and just go shower at the gym. She then contacted her old tenant who was on holiday overseas in a different timezone and requested I call her at nearly midnight to prove I'd just set it up wrong. This back fired, as the old tenant agreed with me and we've been chatting ever since, swapping our stories from hell. We're meeting for coffee this weekend after a month of texting. 

She brought over an ""engineer"" but didn't realise I'd clock on it was clearly a family member when they spoke in depth in their own language about IVF (IVF doesn't translate completely) and have similar features etc. So now I have a working timer, but just a faulty boiler that doesn't hold enough hot water to have more than one shower or bath on timer. The old tenant has confirmed it has more capacity than this and had similar settings to me, so now I go without hot water most the day. The landlord wanted me to arrange the boiler man, like I've had to do for every repair. If she had got it looked at by an actual professional the first time around, it would have been less expensive and easier. 

The spare room is still empty because her apartment is overpriced and the more expensive, like studio level price. The first person she interviewed, would only move if I I paid more electric, despite us both doing remote work roles. She wanted me to agree to this because she's worried I'll get lonely. Right, I declined. She then invited someone round for a viewing on Christmas day, and requested on boxing day I interview her remotely over the phone as I had gone away for the holidays. Guilting me because she'd took me in after my break up. 3 days later she's back at the apartment, making snidey remarks about how the new tenant found somewhere else as I was too busy to call on boxing day and telling me to hide some of my personal items (furniture) because she doesn't like them. I told her I was working and she said she'd only be here 30 mins. 2 hours later she's drilling and banging around. It's the same everytime she comes in to do errands on the place. Stays for hours, brings random people with her and is loud and disruptive. Or she sends random people on her behalf pretending they are professional companies, who never turn up when they say they will (like 9/10 hours later) and gives out my number to them without asking me. 

Last one before the big one, the window in the spare room is completely blown, so cold air is blowing into the apartment. It's always been cold in the flat, and the plug in heater never managed to keep it warm, and now I know why. She won't let me turn the heating on properly because it's too expensive, despite me paying the bill. I had a friend stay and went to stay in the spare room (put own bedding on) and told her I realised the seals blown as you can feel the wind into the bed and road noise. She kicks off accusing me of dirtying the room, tells me I'm not allowed to use that room, and that she's happy for me to break the contract if I can't cope with the property. She said as she is currently doing fertility treatments, and wants me to leave as the stress of all these repairs means she might have a miscarriage, apparently she used this card on the previous tenant too. I told her the comments are totally inappropriate and id happily discuss this if I found a more suitable property, as the previous tenant has made me aware of issues with mice, overly high electricity bills and dodgy workmen. 

Honestly I'm just don't with renting at this point.

So... here's what has happened since my last post: I did what one of you recommended, and in the evening, I went to the local market to pick up some sage, resin incense, and whatever else could fit into a chain-held incense censer; which I also purchased in one of those... weird stores, in which they also sell crystals and angel statues.

It really makes it hard to believe in the power these items hold when they're on sale.

I hid everything from my partner and stashed it all under the bed, I didn't want him to worry about my mental health of all things... I come from a very cynical background, a rarity in a mostly Catholic nation... so my out-of-the-blue purchase would be impossible to explain.

Just when I returned home I received another notification... someone in my last post mentioned the ""fae"" and I remembered that such tales are common here in Colombia as well.

I stumbled upon a particular term; ""Duende"" which comes from the words ""Dueño de casa"" which means something along the lines of ""The master of the house"" They are indeed described as tiny fae creatures that invade a person's home and pester them.

But I feel this goes vastly beyond ""pestering"" this feels malicious.

I investigated further on the matter... but it's mostly old wives' tales, nothing concrete. There wasn't a particular chant or ritual to get them out, nothing like that, so no luck there.

One of you mentioned I should try to contact the previous owner, but he left for Europe as soon as I paid and nobody we know has his new phone number... I think the bastard wanted to run away from the situation before it blew over, but... it could be the powerless feeling speaking.

For all I know my tormentor could simply have entered the house in the short period in which it was abandoned....

I figured then that if I was out of options I might as well try to follow the advice one of you gave me...  I went to sleep with resolve in my mind.

...

I wake up in the middle of the night. I'm staring straight at the ceiling, in my bed...

I try reaching for my phone... and my hand doesn't move.

I felt as if every single one of my limbs had been nailed down violently to the bed, my eyes barely moved, and my mouth was frozen...

The first thing I saw were those elongated, pale fingers crawling into view from my left side, where the bed ended, like a hideous tarantula perching itself in my face... slowly treading the stone-like appendages through my face... in a circular motion.

That disgusting little monster was caressing my face almost mockingly. I tried screaming, but my body didn't answer... I could feel my anger boiling inside, my eyes tearing up from the helplessness of experiencing this so close to someone who cared for me and would likely help if I could produce but a murmur.

...This ritual lasted the whole night...

As soon as sunlight came in from the window the little monster went away again, I sat on the bed... the tiredness in my joints and the tears in my cheeks confirming that I hadn't just awoken from the most horrible nightmare in my life... the bed was drenched in sweat.

I was downstairs, my hands struggling to hold a coffee cup when the alarm clock of my partner started ringing... I looked like such a mess that he immediately bought into the fact something wasn't right.

I shrugged him off as having night terrors... it wouldn't be the first time. He eventually had to leave for work.

And I began executing my plan like I had been born for it, opened every window in the house, one by one, even in the rooms that were a mess; grabbed the stuff from beneath the bed and began walking through the house with the incense sensor smoking the whole place...

I'm not a person of faith, by any means, but I am certain I have never prayed to my God with so much fervour before... I spent the early morning doing it asking to any powers of the divine providence I could recall to get this evil off my house, to extinguish the hold it had on me... until the clock marked 12 pm.

At that point I sat down, sweating profusely, the house filled with a smoke that slowly escaped through every window like a holy-mist of some sort... and I felt...

Free...

I saved up all of it and closed the windows back up... I even used the rest of the afternoon to clean up the mess in the rooms I had once locked... I no longer feel fear in this house.

It feels mine now.

I'm writing this with tears in my eyes, I can't believe it's over.

Reacted badly to scopolamine patch, basically couldn't open my eyes surgery day, and when I attempted, eyes teared badly. Had eye pain as well. Tolerated liquids and urinating great. Put on abdominal binder before bed. 

Day one vision was blurry. Shoulder pain was excruciating. Peeing was going great, didn't want any food, but had lots of fluids. Tolerated a protein shake and a jello in addition to other fluids (liquid IV/protein20 water as well). Pain meds around the clock and 3 stool softeners/gasx a day.

Day two, vision cleared. Felt more coherent. Been coughing lots to clear the anesthesia from my lungs. My husband picked up a special shoulder/neck heating pad and it was amazing. Tolerated small solid meals. Managed to rinse off in the shower and put on clean pj's. The goal of the day was farting. Getting up and walking is getting easier.

Day three (today 1/2/2025)
Had a coffee in the am (also day 2). Walking is feeling much more stable and comfortable (more upright). More farting. After some walking bowels get going and I have first bm. Lots more gas follows. Instant relief today in my shoulders. Can still feel it rolling in my guts. No pain in my abdomen at incisions. I have only taken ibuprofen this morning along with a stool softener/gasx. Resting. Walking. Switch to a body suit compression. 

Have an afternoon coffee and within two sips I have shat MYSELF. Cool. I am not new to this (rectal surgery in April). Lots more gas and instant relief in my abdomen. I am currently on my couch covered in pillows and a blanket so I can see my poor Weiner dogs who cry when I'm upstairs.

1hs74co,https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1hs74co/some_trashycheap_gifts_to_give/,Some trashy/cheap gifts to give,"Just a little note for any new players... It's easy to get friendship points with some common cheap items. Also this is how I do most of my gift giving -- out of convenience as much as possible. For instance, if I see Harvey, Linus or Leah I probably have something already on me that they will like or love. If I get broken glasses while fishing I'll stop by Granny's house on my way home... It's very easy to max out gifts with them every week (which gives you a +20 friendship bonus on Sunday morning). 

This is a very brief list and is not at all inclusive -- the point of this list is just to give some people some ideas of gifts you might have around. 

Evelyn -- broken glasses and tulips (tulip seeds are 20g - leave them in the ground until you need them or the last day of the season so they don't crowd your inventory). She also likes a lot of the beach forageables but usually I save those for crafting or I sell them). 


Leah -- driftwood and forged food items, her loves are all pretty pricey except for salad, so if you see her at the Saloon you can spend 220g for a loved item. Otherwise I literally give her my spring onions and salmonberries when I see her. She even likes Holly (along with Harvey and Linus).

Linus - like Leah he likes these cheap forged items. It's easy to give them to him any time you're near the Mountain Lake. He loves coconut, desert cactus and yams so it's easy to get 10 hearts by the end of Fall with these, even if you've ignored him. (Don't ignore him though, he gives you the magic bait and sushimi recipes). He'll also send you catfish in the mail sometimes. 

Harvey -- Like Leah and Linus he enjoys some of the cheap forageables such as Spring Onions as well as almost all the mushrooms. He loves coffee and pickles as the cheapest items to make. 

Sam - he likes those Joja Colas which are 75g in the Saloon vending machine. Otherwise I just give them when I have them. He seems to always be around town (easy to find when I need him). He also likes pizza, so if I find that is an easy gift. 

Vincent -- I give this little guy all my snails. Makes us both happy. 

Sebastian -- frozen tears and sashimi. All day every day. 

Robin -- loves spaghetti (sold at the Saloon) and likes hardwood and quartz. 

Lewis -- he loves tea and hot peppers, before summer I just give him parsnips or green beans if I feel like it. I never focus on this relationship. 

Wizard -- loves void essence and likes quartz and all geode minerals (even sandstone/limestone). Never go empty handed to turn in a quest! 

Maru -- likes quartz, loves pepper poppers, strawberries and cauliflower. 

Willy - likes quartz and loves sea cucumbers and catfish. He likes a lot of cooked dishes but by the time I am cooking I'd rather just give him a loved item (plenty of easy ones when you're established on the farm). 

Abigail -- she likes ancient swords, bone flutes and quartz of course. She loves amethyst and it's cheaper than a gold-quality pumpkin that's for sure. 

Alex - loved items are ridiculous, just give him eggs. But not fried ones, he wants the raw ones. Not my cup of tea but whatever. 

Shane - my favorite! He loves beer and pizza sold at the pub for 400 and 600g respectively. Too expensive (except on his birthday). I give him and Pam (and whoever else) parsnips until summer than I give him and Lewis gold-quality hot peppers. He sends you pizza (a loved item of Sam), pepper poppers (good speed and farming boosts and loved by Maru) or you can just give them back to him as loved items. 

Demetrius -- loves strawberries. He'll send you some good stuff in the mail so it's worth it even though his personality can be hard to take sometimes. 

Caroline -- of course I focus on her early on with Daffodils, but she loves Summer Spangles and green tea. She likes the tea leaves so it can be easy to grab them from her tea room and just give them to her right there. 

Penny -- likes dandelions, loves poppies and sandfish. 

Jodi -- loves pancakes which are 160g at the Saloon. Otherwise I'll give her veggies if I want a friendship with her. 

Jas -- she loves strange dolls and ancient dolls, otherwise I'll give her forageables that she likes such as daffodils and sweet peas. 

Dwarf -- all dwarf artifacts are liked items (I believe) 

Clint & Emily -- just give them topaz and amethyst, I focus on Clint first cause he sends you bars in the mail. 


I struggle with Marnie and Elliot friendships, Elliot loves expensive things and I just throw veggies at Marnie when I feel like it. 


My point with this list is to help someone streamline the friendship aspect of this game. Going to see Robin? Bring some strawberries, a hardwood and frozen tear with you. Find yourself at the Saloon? Buy Sam a Joja cola and give Leah and Harvey a consumables from your inventory. Going to Pierre's? Bring some quartz and a couple cups of tea with you.

So sad to miss out on some delicious homemade lattes and to have to pack up the machine and send it back! ",1,1735858509.0,nespresso,5,0.66,False

1hs71a9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hs71a9,Shadow BaB + Forgotten voice box?,"Hey all! New to buying BaB products, and didn't really have a great time. Want to ask a question about what I can do, but here's some context (skip to the end for a TLDR). I decided to go ahead and grab myself a Shadow BaB a while back, my favourite character ever, and was absolutely thrilled to have managed to get him. Especially given the demand for him. But my overall experience was not so great. 

To start off, awful website. Despite putting in the EXACT name of his accessories nothing came up, leading me to believe the emerald was sold out. Only finding out AFTER purchasing my BaB that it was actually in stock and just refused to show up on the site. Bummer, but was fine missing out on a bit of green fabric. I added a coffee scent (iykyk) and the 4 phrases voice box to him. He got to me on Dec 16th and was absolutely in love. He smelled just like coffee as I asked, but came to find no matter where I pressed on him he wouldn't talk. They forgot my voice box. 

Upon getting in contact with guest services I was put through to the US team. Not great given I'm from the UK, but I decided to go along with them and clue them in on what's happening. They have me 2 choices, refund or go get the chip myself. I chose the latter, given that I wanted to hear Keanu's incredible voice whenever I wanted to. But I was told to just ""go to a store and get one"". This isn't possible as the UK has Shadow as an ""Online Exclusive Only"". I was then given an email (see photo attached) with very confusing information. I cannot tell if they are still telling me to go to a store  even though I know it's not going to be there, or that they will be sending one for me to collect specifically. I have nudged them for clarification and received nothing but an automatic ""how did we do"" email. I'm sort of lost on what to do unless they get back to me, which they haven't since Christmas. 

Which brings me onto my inquiry. What do I do from here? I don't want the refund and still require the voice chip, but the conflicting retail environments of support, as well as their lack of understanding is not helping me. Plus, I was informed they will not ship the chip seperately, despite this being a fault on their end. As BaB veterans, are your suggestions here? Thanks a bunch if you're able to give me some advice, or have been through similar and had it resolved. 

TLDR: Got a Shadow bear as a UK online exclusive, the Shadow 4 phrases voice box I bought was missing, got put in contact with US support after making a ticket (I'm UK), told me I could refund or go get a new chip for ""free"", refused to send me a chip, told me to go to a store to get one but they're not stocked in stores, sent me a confusing email (attached in pics) and haven't elaborated since Xmas, now lost on what to do to get this chip. Seeking advice on what I can do from here.",7,1735858399.0,buildabear,7,0.9,False

I left the Siren back in July, but there’s a possibility I’ll be rehired this weekend.

I’m curious about how likely it is that I’ll retain my sick time, original pay rate, and my Coffee Master apron.

Since I’m transferring to a different district, I was informed I might need to redo the Coffee Master program—which I’m open to if needed.",1,1735858382.0,starbucksbaristas,2,0.67,False

I’m looking for state parks/conservation areas, activities, coffee shops, and third shift spaces. I’d like to make a plan to visit these spots on our weekends. 

We moved recently from Chicago and have been adjusting to our schedule. Breakfast spots are always appreciated (we really like Uncle Wolfies) and I’d love to find a few parks that are an hour or less drive from here to walk the dog and bird watch. ",2,1735858328.0,milwaukee,3,1.0,False

I ordered a package off of Amazon and built it today. I built half before I went to work and when I came home and began to build the second half I realized the flat wood desk top had a fair amount of fiberglass on it. I deduced it was from the Styrofoam that was in the package, two sheets of which had been on the coffee table for the last few hours (when I was at work). I do not think my cat had any contact with the Styrofoam/fiberglass and I immediately cleaned the carpet I was building it on. Should I bathe or brush her? Or leave her alone? It was a very small amount of fiberglass that had fallen to the coffee table/on my hands but out of caution I figured id ask!",1,1735858222.0,CATHELP,1,1.0,False
