1lzqofh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIreland/comments/1lzqofh/why_is_bank_of_ireland_so_ridiculous/,Why is Bank of Ireland so ridiculous?,"Silently raging once again after trying to use the Bank of Ireland app to find the most basic information. It’s genuinely absurd how bad it is. A few lowlights:

1. **Transaction filters** – absolute dogshit. Want to search for a specific payment? Nah sorry we don’t do text. Just want to see incoming payments? Nope, not allowed. But hey, you *can* filter by cheques! Super helpful in 2025.

2. **Statements** – two excellent options here: 1) paper statements by post, once a month, or 2) an online statement... *but only if you specifically request it*, and then there’s a 2 day delay before you get it.   
  
I DO not understand the logic. Why can’t we have automatic monthly statements like before but instead of posting them, put them online?!

3. **The new “monthly money in and out” feature** – handy out? Could’ve been! But no, it only shows transactions **up to today’s date** for each past month. So on July 14th, you can only see data *up to the 14th* for every other month too. Want to compare full months? Oh no no, gotta wait until the end of the month! Want to see it in February? Just ignore the last 2-3 days in all the other months, I’m sure you didn’t make or spend any money at the end of a month...

There are so many other little things. You’ve got Point of Service info with such a short character limit you sometimes can’t even tell who took the money. Adding a new payee is so labour intensive when you’re not setting them up for a monthly rent payment, just want to pay for a flipping coffee table off of Facebook marketplace and they don’t have Revolut for some reason. And recurring payees still showing the same reference you used the first time. There are so many redundant fields for a payment reference, one of which you can’t edit later, so hope you like “money” being the reference for payments to your significant other for the rest of time.

Last year I applied for a savings account. It took 7 weeks to set up and involved so much identity verification you’d swear I had just appeared from an unknown overseas territory instead of being a BOI customer since I was a literal child.

How is it still this bad?

1lzqnbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/soulslikes/comments/1lzqnbv/i_am_really_trying_but_flintlock_is_the_worst/,"I am really trying, but Flintlock is the worst soulslike game I have ever played","From the creators of Ashen? This? I am very disappointed.

I never really played the real shitters like Dolmen, but I played almost every notable soulslike, and I was never really this disappointed overall. For example I really liked Bleak Faith and Hellpoint, but it feels bad to even put them close to this shit.

From the ugly aesthetics, mixing generic environments with medieval castles and villages, napoleonic trenches and coalition, undead enemies, knight enemies, final fantasy animals, all blended into some weird sterile color pallet.

The only design that stands out is the coffee shop keeper, Enki and the god from the start.

Sound is utterly fucked, either too loud or too quiet, no real audio setting to pick headphones/stereo.

Floaty movement and combat, which would be fine if the animations weren't so shit and frame locked.

Every parry feels like luck.

Every dodge feels like shit because the particles make micro stutters.

The level/world design is really weird, as in I like how you can move all over, but hamlets you save are huge but empty, areas you move around are complex in terms of number of platforms and nooks, but with almost no real loot or stuff to find. Enemies just blend into the environment, and can be completely ignored.

Weird inventory design that looks like a mobile game screen, but it gives you a fucking cursor even on a controller.

1lzqn8w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lzqn8w,V60 vs Switch: Light & Sparkly Sey Colombians,"Spent a nice bag of Octavio Rueda’s 3rd Harvest El Mirador from Sey on Hario Switch for the first time this week. My daily home brews are usually V60 on T90’s for washed lights, maybe April on Sibarist fast for more dank naturals (rare for me), and Aeropress with Prismo and Sibarist fast for travel. Home grinder is a Zerno with Brew Burrs. Travel grinder ZP6. 

I usually run my Sey V60’s on the Zerno Brew Burrs around 700 microns from chirp at 87°C and a pretty low ppm custom water treatment. It’s sweet, bright, sparkly, and extremely clean and clear on notes. Obviously body is tea-like, yet not watery. I’m quite pleased with the experience and it beats 99% of cafe cups. 

Having not tried switch before, I ran the gamut. All with tighter grinds and hotter waters. I wanted to try to find something with a touch more body for days when I want it to kick up a notch. Tetsu’s gods and devils, Coffee Chronicler’s original and sweeter timings, Emi Fukahori’s daily, and yes even Lance’s new spoon switch from last week. Nothing really brought me as much joy as the lower temp v60 recipe that I learned long ago. I’m curious if it comes down to the combination of Sey’s roast profile, Zerno/SSP’s blind brew burrs, and obviously my water recipe that finalizes V60 as the way to go for me. The switch just kind of mutes what’s going on and I’m not finding much more sweetness, just more roast notes building as body if anything. 

A side note, my pour style is quite consistent on v60: 22g/350g, 50g bloom, med viscous pour to 200g wait to almost drain, lighter viscous pour to 300g, let drain a few mm and finish to 350g with no agitation on drain down to pull right at bed. No full drip out. 

There are a lot of great reasons the switch  wins for many home brewers, but I do wonder if when the water, burrs, coffee type, filters, etc all point in one stylistic direction (v60 tea juice)… maybe it’s not the way for my setup? Or it’s just a taste thing for me. Just an interesting observation after A/B’ing a lot of methods this week.


V60 still hails for me!

Anyway…

Happy Brewing!

1lzqm4j,https://i.redd.it/xre0zfyk6vcf1.png,They're still out there... Chapter 2,"Most people would walk right up to the window and see whatever’s outside.   You could probably think that after what I just saw… or didn’t see… it’d be better to grab the shotgun or run upstairs to my room. Lock myself inside like a trapped animal, hoping whatever’s behind that window is just my imagination. In the end, it kinda did.

  But it’s not that simple. You don’t know what to do. You’re just… frozen. Like—is this really happening? Or am I going crazy? And I’m not gonna lie: I was scared shitless. Still am. It’s getting harder to write—maybe it’s the alcohol… maybe it’s the fact that I don’t have much time left. I… I think I just heard a stick crack outside. But I’m not looking. Not again. 

  Well… what did I do? Yeah, you guessed it—I looked. But not the way you might think. I started walking slowly and quietly toward the living room. The knocking could still be heard. I hid behind the wall near the door that led to the living room—and to that window. My pulse was racing, heart pounding like crazy, sweat dripping down my brow… and I hadn’t even seen anything yet.  

  Suddenly, the knocking stopped. No more knocking—just silence. And that silence was eating me alive. You might wonder why I didn’t run toward my shotgun, still lying on the couch. Well, I could’ve… But whatever was out there—I didn’t want it to see me going for it. But i gathered the last pieces of courage I had left and slowly peeked from behind the corner… just enough to glimpse the window.

  But before I could even see anything… Suddenly, the light bulbs  shattered, plunging the room into complete darkness. Then came the sound— of someone… or something— running away.  

  I yelled and stumbled back—almost fell. Breathing heavily, I stared into the darkened kitchen. I could barely see anything… except the faint glow of moonlight cutting through the shadows. I stood there, trying to process what had just happened. How could the light bulb shatter on its own? Sure, it’s an old house—everything here’s outdated. But light bulbs don’t just explode by themselves.  

  Well, the first thing that came to my mind was to grab the flashlight I always keep in the nightstand in my bedroom. But first, I quickly headed to the living room and grabbed my shotgun, checking to see if it was reloaded. Feeling the cold steel in my palms gave me a small sense of security— if there was still something out there, at least I had a way to defend myself.  

  I headed upstairs to my bedroom and turned the lights on. Grabbing the flashlight from my nightstand—luckily, it still worked. I placed the shotgun on the bed and moved toward the window overlooking the garden. This time, I didn’t hesitate. I opened it and pointed the light downward— and saw my back door… wide open.  

  My heart stopped, and my breath caught in my throat. I hadn’t left that door open. I knew I locked it— I even checked it twice to be sure. They were locked. I swear.  

  Creak... Creak of the stairs—that’s what I heard. I froze, eyes wide open. It’s strange how such a simple sound can flood your entire body with waves of terror in just a matter of seconds.  

  I slowly turned around, hands trembling and eyes wide open, to face the hallway behind me. It was swallowed in darkness—no lights, just blackness. And I hadn’t even heard a bulb shatter. Before I could logically piece together how any of this happened… I heard it. Another creak. Then a footstep. And another. And another. Whoever—or whatever—was making those sounds… was taking its time.

I could tell the downstairs was probably swallowed in darkness too. I didn’t know what to do. I was too paralyzed to even point my flashlight into the shadows— let alone call out, “Hello.” I don’t think I could have dragged a single word out of myself.  And then...my room lights went out too.

  another set of footsteps followed—only to vanish into silence once again. That’s when I realized… whatever was out there had finally reached the second floor. And with no more sound… I knew it was probably standing there in the darkness. I couldn’t see a thing. But I was certain— that thing was staring straight into my soul. My flashlight was still pointed down… That’s when it hit me. I quickly turned it off. Call me an idiot. Call me a coward. That’s exactly what I am. But there was no way I was going to look at whatever was waiting for me in the dark.  

  Just as I turned off the light, without warning, I heard it— The sound of something running toward my room. Instinct took over. I charged toward the door, and just as it was probably too close, I slammed it shut and locked it as fast as I could. A massive crash slammed against the other side. I pressed my back to the door, bracing myself in case it tried to break in. But to my surprise— and maybe my luck— it didn’t.  

  When I was closing the door, I couldn’t quite see what was out there. But in the split second before it shut—just a glimpse from the corner of my eye— I saw a small figure. Like a child. On all fours.   

  For a moment, there was silence. As someone who saw horrors during my teenage years, I would’ve expected it to try breaking down the door. Sure, that thing was small— but the door wasn’t in the best condition either. And if it really tried… it might just succeed. Who knows. But— nothing. No scratching. No knocking. Not even breathing. I almost would’ve welcomed the knocking… just to drown out this dreadful silence.  

  As if it could hear my thoughts… It began to scratch at the door. Slowly. Deliberately. Loud enough to remind me it was still there—waiting. Each sound sent shivers down my spine. And then… I saw it as i turned my light on towards the bed. My salvation. The shotgun—still lying on the bed. I should’ve grabbed it earlier.      

  Just then, the scratching stopped— and it caught me off guard. I pressed my ear against the door, but heard nothing. Was it still there? Did it leave? Didn’t matter. I needed that shotgun. I hurried to the bed, grabbed it, and let out a small sigh of relief.

  But that relief vanished in an instant… as I heard the door behind me slowly begin to open. And now, as I write this, I realize— every time a flicker of hope appeared, it was torn away by unimaginable dread. As if they knew. As if these things were toying with us— with me— with my emotions… waiting until just the right moment to strike.  

  I continued to stand still. I don’t think I could’ve moved anyway— it felt like my legs were stuck to the floor. The only thing I could do was stare at my trembling hands clutching the shotgun. I don’t know how… but I could feel a presence behind me. Not speaking. Not moving. Just standing there. Watching me. Waiting for me to turn around.

You’re probably thinking I should’ve pulled the trigger by now. But it’s not that simple. Even in the face of danger, your mind tears itself between fight and flight. I’ve never shot anyone before— and that’s a world apart from firing at a dummy. But whatever was behind me… was clearly feasting on my fear. I gripped the shotgun tight, trying to take deep, silent breaths. Somehow, I gathered the last scraps of adrenaline still left in me. I dropped the flashlight. Spun around. And I… pulled the trigger.  

  A sudden storm of light flooded the room— followed by the thunder of a shotgun blast. And in that blinding flash,  I breathed heavily, still gripping the shotgun in trembling hands. The sound of the shot was still ringing in my ears. I lowered the weapon and looked toward where the body should’ve been— but I couldn’t see anything. Slowly, I reached down, searching the floor for my flashlight. After a few seconds, I felt it. I grabbed it, flicked it on, and pointed the beam toward the spot where I thought the body would be. And then I saw it… Saw her. Amanda.  

   Lying on the ground in a pool of her own blood, her pajamas soaked and smeared with something that looked like dirt, I stepped closer—carefully— flashlight in one hand, shotgun in the other. She didn’t move. She just lay there. Her eyes… Her fucking eyes. No—they weren’t eyes. Just two empty black holes. No pupils. Her teeth—fucking hell—she was different. Small. Some missing. But the ones still there… they were sharp. Animal sharp. Her hair was a matted mess, and her limbs twisted unnaturally, each finger tipped with filthy, broken nails and, her tonque was gone. I still got the image in my head, it wont let go.

  My body couldn’t handle it anymore. I dropped the shotgun, stumbled back slightly— and then everything went dark. I lost consciousness and collapsed to the floor.  

  I won’t ever forget that night. Not ever. Though soon enough, I’ll probably forget everything else. The most intimidating part wasn’t what happened— but what came after. And God… if only I had realized sooner. All those little hints she gave me. I don’t know if anything would’ve changed, but maybe I could’ve been more prepared. Warned everybody. I don’t know when I woke up. But when I slowly opened my eyes, I was blinded by sunlight. I groaned and tried to sit up, but my whole body—and especially my head—ached. Still, I managed to sit up, confused, with no idea what had happened. Until my gaze landed on the pool of blood. Dry. Staining the floor. Blood. But no body.  

  And everything came rushing back to me at the speed of light. For a moment, I thought maybe it had all been a dream. And honestly… maybe I could’ve believed that. I could’ve told myself I drank too much yesterday— even though I didn’t drink at all. Blamed it on sleepwalking. Said I fell and hit my head. I know how absurd that sounds. But accepting that everything that happened was real— and not just a nightmare? I couldn’t do it.  

  But that thought faded away as I weakly stepped out of the room. Then I remembered the scratching. I turned back and closed the door— and that’s when I saw them. Claw marks. Small... but unmistakable. They were still there. What scared me the most wasn’t the marks— but what was written by them. One word… Leave.  

It’s funny how everything starts to make sense only after the disaster strikes. With my shotgun and flashlight in hand, I headed downstairs and looked around. The whole house was now flooded with sunlight, everything appearing just as it was before. Except for one thing— the back door was closed.  

  And even with sunlight flooding all around me, and a shotgun gripped tight in my hand, I could feel it again— that now familiar sense of unease.  

  Yet even with the sunlight, I felt only slightly more confident. I slipped the flashlight into my pocket, gripped the shotgun with both hands, and made my way toward the garden door. As my hand reached the handle, I pulled it open— quickly raised the shotgun— and, with my foot, nudged the door open just slightly. And there it was... My garden. Normal. Small, yet beautiful. I wandered through it, unsure of what I was even looking for. Maybe I just needed to be certain— certain that everything was fine. And for a while, it was. Until the moment I saw them. Small tracks. Right by the window.  

  They looked… human. Small. You don’t need to study rocket science to figure it out. They were Amanda’s tracks. God, every time I even think about her name… I feel sad. Angry. Like maybe— if I wasn’t such a coward, it wouldn’t have ended like this.  

  Something moved in the bushes as I’m writing this. I think they want me to know they’re still out there. The light outside… the last thing keeping me alive is slowly, yet quickly, fading— barely lighting the area anymore. I have to finish this., i dont have much time.

 Amanda’s tracks weren’t the only ones I noticed. Hers led toward the door. But in the more overgrown parts of the garden, I saw them— faint, barely visible. Another set of prints. They didn’t start from within the garden— they came from outside. Straight to the window where Amanda had stood. At first, I wasn’t sure if they were human. But now I know… they weren’t. They were too big. Too heavy. More animal than anything else. A fresh wave of fear gripped me. If those tracks were real… then that means there was more than one. Maybe not just in the garden— maybe inside the house. 

  Later, though, I began to piece things together. She was here to warn me. Warn me from what—I had no idea back then. Maybe it was something connected to the tracks. But even then… I couldn’t wrap my head around it. If she truly wanted to help me— then why? Why would she shatter my lights? Why would she run? Why would she leave me like that— alone, scared, in the dark?  

  Even now, I haven’t fully wrapped my head around it. But I have a theory. She was there to warn me. She knocked on the window—just to get my attention. But that thing outside… it didn’t like that. It ran toward her. She noticed. And maybe—just maybe—she didn’t want that thing to see me. So she covered my house in darkness. Then she escaped and entered my house so she could warn me there. I’m not entirely convinced. Believe what you want. But it’s the only explanation I’ve got.

  Staying in the garden didn’t feel right, so I went back into the house. But I couldn’t help myself— I glanced toward the woods. Back then, the peaceful view had shifted into something else… like staring into a pit of dread. The trees stood tall, overgrown. Their shadows blanketed whatever might be hiding beneath. And now, looking back… I think I was being watched. Probably stared at the whole time.    

   I figured I’d just walk in, make myself a coffee, and figure out what to do next. And for a moment, it was going exactly that way— until I heard the ringing. The doorbell. Ringing. I stood there, debating if I should open it. Then I heard a voice. Familiar. Too familiar.  

  “Jackie... Jackie, you there, man?”  

  It was Michael. My friend who was 3 years older than me. Honestly, the one person I’d still call my best friend around here— even though we hadn’t really done anything together in the past two weeks. At first, I thought it might be a trick again. Another illusion. Another trap. But then I heard him call me by the nickname. The one only he uses.

  “Come on, don’t make me scared—open up, you hobbit.” Yeah… don’t ask me why he picked that. Sure, I wasn’t the tallest, but somehow he settled on that silly name for me. And what I’d give— to hear it just one last time.  

  In that moment, I knew—it had to be him. I almost rushed to open the door, until I realized I was still holding the shotgun. So I slipped over to the couch, quickly tucked it away under the blanket, and tried to look normal. Not that it really mattered. Because when I opened the door, relieved, even smiling—yet he was not okay.

  Oh God, you scared me, Jackie. You good, man?    —he asked, trying to play it cool. But he sounded genuinely concerned. Despite his always cheerful bravado, he’d always been caring. The kind of guy who wouldn’t leave a friend behind. He was basically the first person I met when I moved here, and with him around, I never felt alone. Even now, my eyes get a little wet thinking about those times with Michael. He was the kind of friend everyone should have in their life.  

  “Yeah, I’m good, I’m good—just… haven’t slept well, you know? Bad dreams and stuff like that. How about you?”  

  “Well, you’re not alone,” he answered. “From what I’ve heard, everyone’s got their sleep schedule messed up. But yeah, I guess I’m… f-fine. Hey, is your phone working?”  

  “Well, uh… I don’t know. I haven’t checked it today yet. Why?”  

  Because nobody’s phone is working around here. Remember the two police officers who were supposed to arrive? They never did. And when we tried to call them, no one picked up. Like there wasn’t even any signal. And the worst part? Everyone’s cars stopped working too. We checked them—engines, batteries, everything seemed fine. But they just… wouldn’t start. 

  That caught me completely off guard. Those two officers last night… they— they weren’t them. I thought to myself. Me and Michael tried both my phone and my car, but neither of them was working.

    At first, I didn’t know what to think. But now I understand— she wasn’t trying to hurt me. She was warning me. The knocking on the window, the hallucination she tried to tell me that this wasnt people… the fact that she could’ve struck when my back was turned—and didn’t. And when I closed the door behind her, she left one final warning becasue she wasnt able to speak. Leave.  

  I understand what it means . And I should’ve listened.   Because the nightmare wasn’t over. It hadn’t even begun. And she tried to warn me.

My car was basically the only thing that didn’t feel outdated— though it had seen better days too. And yet… it stopped working. No issues with the battery. Nothing. Just... dead.  

  Michael took me to another part of the village, where dozens of people had already gathered. From the looks of it— and the air itself— it wasn’t good. The villagers were shouting over one another, voices tangled and chaotic. I could barely make out a single word, but one thing was clear— they were scared.  I was suprised nobody mentioned the shooting sound from my shotgun tho.

  Sometimes, through the chaos, I caught scattered voices: “Have you seen him?” “Where is he?” “I saw something in my house.” Were other people going missing? Had… had they seen what I did? I asked myself, unsettled. And that’s when a woman stepped forward and shouted— loud enough to cut through every conversation. Everyone stopped mid-sentence. The woman was Valeria. Twenty-five. Young, pretty, and stubborn as hell. I’d always wanted to ask her out— maybe a date, maybe just coffee— but I never did.  

  “Alright, I know you’re all scared. Something is happening here. You’re not alone—I’m scared too. But we can’t let fear take over. We have to think rationally. Even without cars, I have an idea. If you’ve got a bike, grab a few essentials and come with me. We’ll try to reach the nearest police station. I know it sounds stupid— but what else can we do?”  

  The villagers looked at one another, murmuring quietly before nodding in agreement. They realized this was probably the best option. A few people stepped forward to join her. One was Peter, the nearby food store shopkeeper. Another was Elizabeth, who always sold homemade vests. And then there was Patrick— a guy I honestly can’t tell you much about. Michael only had a car, and I had a bike that probably wouldn’t survive the first three miles. So it was settled: they would head to the police station themselves, while the rest of us stayed behind, waiting in our homes.  

  It was strange, though. Cars or phones can stop working, sure— but not all of them at the same time. We were basically trapped here. No way out. No connection to the outside world. Surrounded by… woods. Whith no idea that later we wont be alone....any longer.

She forwarded it from the SGI global account, and it has all these hashtags that I won't include here to prevent the search engines from picking it up. 

Here, Icky loosely says that we should try to be our authentic selves, as we were made, and not try to be something we're not. 

Is it me, or is this contradictory to what SGI actually does in practice? I'm thinking specifically of someone I know who decided he was *""born the wrong gender""* and went down that path, encouraged by SGI members to pursue it. His life hasn't changed at its core--he's still the same person, swishing around in a skirt, experiencing the same kinds of problems that plagued him as a man.

For years I've had these horrible 'cycles' of constipation where I wont go for a week or more and then I'll spend a whole morning on the toilet. Then repeat.

I've had the fibre (made things worse), taken mag citrate, tried enzyme pills, senna teas, etc. I've had stool samples and blood samples and tried gluten free. I workout 6 days a week, I drink 3 litres of water, and I eat a variety of foods!

So, given all that,

I've begun to pay attention more to my patterns and triggers. Maybe this will help someone who also seems to have psychological reasons behind their constipation.

Makes me go:
-Early morning
-Monster Energy drink (This has become a routine thing as well as the caffeine. Coffee doesnt work)
-Nobody is home/awake
-Need to do work/homework on the computer
-Having a very upsetting conversation

1lzqkl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYTools/comments/1lzqkl4/could_the_axth_17in1_ratchet_screwdriver_be_the/,Could the AXTH 17in1 ratchet screwdriver be the ultimate tool? Review inside!,"The AXTH 17in1 Right Angle Ratcheting Screwdriver Set (item model number 17in1-Ratchet) found its way to my toolbox, and after weeks of consistent testing, I’ve developed some strong opinions—good, bad, and a bit in between. This unique tool, boasting an innovative design and practical versatility, has been my companion for various tasks, from bike maintenance to furniture assembly. Let’s dive into my firsthand experience with it.

**Unique Right-Angle Design for Tight Spaces**

The first feature that genuinely impressed me was its unique right-angle design, which allows the screwdriver to perform exceptionally well in tight or awkward spaces. I’ve used it while working on my kid’s toy car, trying to fix a battery panel located in a nearly inaccessible corner. It worked beautifully, where a traditional screwdriver simply wouldn’t have fit. The compact 90-degree angle head was game-changing, offering accessibility without unnecessary wrist acrobatics.

**Ergonomic Handle for Maximum Comfort**

Another highlight is the ergonomically designed handle. The combination of non-slip textures and soft rubber materials felt great during prolonged usage. I noticed this benefit especially when repairing an old coffee table that required careful tightening of nearly a dozen screws. Despite spending over an hour holding the tool, no hand fatigue crept up—a testament to its clever design.

**Bearing Steel Bits Built for Durability**

The bits in this set aren’t just ordinary—they’re made from high-quality bearing steel with a hardness rating exceeding HRC65, which ensures excellent resistance to wear and corrosion. To test their toughness, I used the screwdriver to unscrew some rusty old fasteners on a garden chair. Surprisingly, the bits held their ground without a scratch, and the magnetized tips made it super easy to retrieve small screws when I accidentally dropped them.

**Wide Range of Applications**

This tool isn’t just versatile; it’s indispensable for DIY enthusiasts and professionals alike. I leaned on it for minor car repairs as well as assembling shelves for my garage. My coworker, who borrowed it to fix a wobbly desk at the office, swore by its convenience and adaptability. Whether the task involves household appliances or automotive tweaks, this screwdriver more than rises to the occasion.

**Positives**

- Designed to reach tight and awkward spaces with ease.
- Comfortable, non-slip ergonomic handle that reduces hand fatigue.
- Durable bearing steel bits offer excellent longevity.
- Magnetized tips for better precision during work.
- A versatile tool suitable for both home repairs and professional fields.

**Areas of Concern**

- While the screwdriver works well in most scenarios, the plastic components on the handle feel slightly less durable in comparison to the bits.
- The packaging, albeit elegant, doesn’t serve as the best long-term storage solution for the tool and bits.
- The size, while perfect for tight spaces, can feel a bit too compact for larger, heavy-duty tasks.

**Competing Products**

Comparing this to similar ratcheting screwdrivers, the AXTH tool performs admirably in tight spaces where many others falter. For instance, a competitor like the Wiha PocketMax Magnetic Ratchet is comparable in portability but doesn’t offer the same grip comfort for extended use. Alternatively, Klein’s Heavy-Duty Multi-Bit Set features greater torque but lacks the creative angle design that makes the AXTH screwdriver special. Where AXTH shines is its rare balance between compactness, comfort, and utility.

**True Value**

What you’re getting with this screwdriver is more than just a basic tool; it’s a dependable sidekick for everyday repairs and professional needs. Compared to pricier alternatives in the market, this model offers impressive performance at a reasonable cost. It’s especially suitable for those who frequently work on intricate or awkwardly placed screws and need a tool that reduces effort while improving accuracy.

1lzqjfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lzqjfx/theyre_still_out_there_chapter_2/,They're still out there..... chapter 2,"Most people would walk right up to the window and see whatever’s outside.   You could probably think that after what I just saw… or didn’t see… it’d be better to grab the shotgun or run upstairs to my room. Lock myself inside like a trapped animal, hoping whatever’s behind that window is just my imagination. In the end, it kinda did.

  But it’s not that simple. You don’t know what to do. You’re just… frozen. Like—is this really happening? Or am I going crazy? And I’m not gonna lie: I was scared shitless. Still am. It’s getting harder to write—maybe it’s the alcohol… maybe it’s the fact that I don’t have much time left. I… I think I just heard a stick crack outside. But I’m not looking. Not again. 

  Well… what did I do? Yeah, you guessed it—I looked. But not the way you might think. I started walking slowly and quietly toward the living room. The knocking could still be heard. I hid behind the wall near the door that led to the living room—and to that window. My pulse was racing, heart pounding like crazy, sweat dripping down my brow… and I hadn’t even seen anything yet.  

  Suddenly, the knocking stopped. No more knocking—just silence. And that silence was eating me alive. You might wonder why I didn’t run toward my shotgun, still lying on the couch. Well, I could’ve… But whatever was out there—I didn’t want it to see me going for it. But i gathered the last pieces of courage I had left and slowly peeked from behind the corner… just enough to glimpse the window.

  But before I could even see anything… Suddenly, the light bulbs  shattered, plunging the room into complete darkness. Then came the sound— of someone… or something— running away.  

  I yelled and stumbled back—almost fell. Breathing heavily, I stared into the darkened kitchen. I could barely see anything… except the faint glow of moonlight cutting through the shadows. I stood there, trying to process what had just happened. How could the light bulb shatter on its own? Sure, it’s an old house—everything here’s outdated. But light bulbs don’t just explode by themselves.  

  Well, the first thing that came to my mind was to grab the flashlight I always keep in the nightstand in my bedroom. But first, I quickly headed to the living room and grabbed my shotgun, checking to see if it was reloaded. Feeling the cold steel in my palms gave me a small sense of security— if there was still something out there, at least I had a way to defend myself.  

  I headed upstairs to my bedroom and turned the lights on. Grabbing the flashlight from my nightstand—luckily, it still worked. I placed the shotgun on the bed and moved toward the window overlooking the garden. This time, I didn’t hesitate. I opened it and pointed the light downward— and saw my back door… wide open.  

  My heart stopped, and my breath caught in my throat. I hadn’t left that door open. I knew I locked it— I even checked it twice to be sure. They were locked. I swear.  

  Creak... Creak of the stairs—that’s what I heard. I froze, eyes wide open. It’s strange how such a simple sound can flood your entire body with waves of terror in just a matter of seconds.  

  I slowly turned around, hands trembling and eyes wide open, to face the hallway behind me. It was swallowed in darkness—no lights, just blackness. And I hadn’t even heard a bulb shatter. Before I could logically piece together how any of this happened… I heard it. Another creak. Then a footstep. And another. And another. Whoever—or whatever—was making those sounds… was taking its time.

I could tell the downstairs was probably swallowed in darkness too. I didn’t know what to do. I was too paralyzed to even point my flashlight into the shadows— let alone call out, “Hello.” I don’t think I could have dragged a single word out of myself.  And then...my room lights went out too.

  another set of footsteps followed—only to vanish into silence once again. That’s when I realized… whatever was out there had finally reached the second floor. And with no more sound… I knew it was probably standing there in the darkness. I couldn’t see a thing. But I was certain— that thing was staring straight into my soul. My flashlight was still pointed down… That’s when it hit me. I quickly turned it off. Call me an idiot. Call me a coward. That’s exactly what I am. But there was no way I was going to look at whatever was waiting for me in the dark.  

  Just as I turned off the light, without warning, I heard it— The sound of something running toward my room. Instinct took over. I charged toward the door, and just as it was probably too close, I slammed it shut and locked it as fast as I could. A massive crash slammed against the other side. I pressed my back to the door, bracing myself in case it tried to break in. But to my surprise— and maybe my luck— it didn’t.  

  When I was closing the door, I couldn’t quite see what was out there. But in the split second before it shut—just a glimpse from the corner of my eye— I saw a small figure. Like a child. On all fours.   

  For a moment, there was silence. As someone who saw horrors during my teenage years, I would’ve expected it to try breaking down the door. Sure, that thing was small— but the door wasn’t in the best condition either. And if it really tried… it might just succeed. Who knows. But— nothing. No scratching. No knocking. Not even breathing. I almost would’ve welcomed the knocking… just to drown out this dreadful silence.  

  As if it could hear my thoughts… It began to scratch at the door. Slowly. Deliberately. Loud enough to remind me it was still there—waiting. Each sound sent shivers down my spine. And then… I saw it as i turned my light on towards the bed. My salvation. The shotgun—still lying on the bed. I should’ve grabbed it earlier.      

  Just then, the scratching stopped— and it caught me off guard. I pressed my ear against the door, but heard nothing. Was it still there? Did it leave? Didn’t matter. I needed that shotgun. I hurried to the bed, grabbed it, and let out a small sigh of relief.

  But that relief vanished in an instant… as I heard the door behind me slowly begin to open. And now, as I write this, I realize— every time a flicker of hope appeared, it was torn away by unimaginable dread. As if they knew. As if these things were toying with us— with me— with my emotions… waiting until just the right moment to strike.  

  I continued to stand still. I don’t think I could’ve moved anyway— it felt like my legs were stuck to the floor. The only thing I could do was stare at my trembling hands clutching the shotgun. I don’t know how… but I could feel a presence behind me. Not speaking. Not moving. Just standing there. Watching me. Waiting for me to turn around.

You’re probably thinking I should’ve pulled the trigger by now. But it’s not that simple. Even in the face of danger, your mind tears itself between fight and flight. I’ve never shot anyone before— and that’s a world apart from firing at a dummy. But whatever was behind me… was clearly feasting on my fear. I gripped the shotgun tight, trying to take deep, silent breaths. Somehow, I gathered the last scraps of adrenaline still left in me. I dropped the flashlight. Spun around. And I… pulled the trigger.  

  A sudden storm of light flooded the room— followed by the thunder of a shotgun blast. And in that blinding flash,  I breathed heavily, still gripping the shotgun in trembling hands. The sound of the shot was still ringing in my ears. I lowered the weapon and looked toward where the body should’ve been— but I couldn’t see anything. Slowly, I reached down, searching the floor for my flashlight. After a few seconds, I felt it. I grabbed it, flicked it on, and pointed the beam toward the spot where I thought the body would be. And then I saw it… Saw her. Amanda.  

   Lying on the ground in a pool of her own blood, her pajamas soaked and smeared with something that looked like dirt, I stepped closer—carefully— flashlight in one hand, shotgun in the other. She didn’t move. She just lay there. Her eyes… Her fucking eyes. No—they weren’t eyes. Just two empty black holes. No pupils. Her teeth—fucking hell—she was different. Small. Some missing. But the ones still there… they were sharp. Animal sharp. Her hair was a matted mess, and her limbs twisted unnaturally, each finger tipped with filthy, broken nails and, her tonque was gone. I still got the image in my head, it wont let go.

  My body couldn’t handle it anymore. I dropped the shotgun, stumbled back slightly— and then everything went dark. I lost consciousness and collapsed to the floor.  

  I won’t ever forget that night. Not ever. Though soon enough, I’ll probably forget everything else. The most intimidating part wasn’t what happened— but what came after. And God… if only I had realized sooner. All those little hints she gave me. I don’t know if anything would’ve changed, but maybe I could’ve been more prepared. Warned everybody. I don’t know when I woke up. But when I slowly opened my eyes, I was blinded by sunlight. I groaned and tried to sit up, but my whole body—and especially my head—ached. Still, I managed to sit up, confused, with no idea what had happened. Until my gaze landed on the pool of blood. Dry. Staining the floor. Blood. But no body.  

  And everything came rushing back to me at the speed of light. For a moment, I thought maybe it had all been a dream. And honestly… maybe I could’ve believed that. I could’ve told myself I drank too much yesterday— even though I didn’t drink at all. Blamed it on sleepwalking. Said I fell and hit my head. I know how absurd that sounds. But accepting that everything that happened was real— and not just a nightmare? I couldn’t do it.  

  But that thought faded away as I weakly stepped out of the room. Then I remembered the scratching. I turned back and closed the door— and that’s when I saw them. Claw marks. Small... but unmistakable. They were still there. What scared me the most wasn’t the marks— but what was written by them. One word… Leave.  

    At first, I didn’t know what to think. But now I understand— she wasn’t trying to hurt me. She was warning me. The knocking on the window, the hallucination she tried to tell me that this wasnt people… the fact that she could’ve struck when my back was turned—and didn’t. And when I closed the door behind her, she left one final warning becasue she wasnt able to speak. Leave.  

  I understand what it means . And I should’ve listened.   Because the nightmare wasn’t over. It hadn’t even begun. And she tried to warn me.

It’s funny how everything starts to make sense only after the disaster strikes. With my shotgun and flashlight in hand, I headed downstairs and looked around. The whole house was now flooded with sunlight, everything appearing just as it was before. Except for one thing— the back door was closed.  

  And even with sunlight flooding all around me, and a shotgun gripped tight in my hand, I could feel it again— that now familiar sense of unease.  

  Yet even with the sunlight, I felt only slightly more confident. I slipped the flashlight into my pocket, gripped the shotgun with both hands, and made my way toward the garden door. As my hand reached the handle, I pulled it open— quickly raised the shotgun— and, with my foot, nudged the door open just slightly. And there it was... My garden. Normal. Small, yet beautiful. I wandered through it, unsure of what I was even looking for. Maybe I just needed to be certain— certain that everything was fine. And for a while, it was. Until the moment I saw them. Small tracks. Right by the window.  

  They looked… human. Small. You don’t need to study rocket science to figure it out. They were Amanda’s tracks. God, every time I even think about her name… I feel sad. Angry. Like maybe— if I wasn’t such a coward, it wouldn’t have ended like this.  

  Something moved in the bushes as I’m writing this. I think they want me to know they’re still out there. The light outside… the last thing keeping me alive is slowly, yet quickly, fading— barely lighting the area anymore. I have to finish this., i dont have much time.

 Amanda’s tracks weren’t the only ones I noticed. Hers led toward the door. But in the more overgrown parts of the garden, I saw them— faint, barely visible. Another set of prints. They didn’t start from within the garden— they came from outside. Straight to the window where Amanda had stood. At first, I wasn’t sure if they were human. But now I know… they weren’t. They were too big. Too heavy. More animal than anything else. A fresh wave of fear gripped me. If those tracks were real… then that means there was more than one. Maybe not just in the garden— maybe inside the house. 

  Later, though, I began to piece things together. She was here to warn me. Warn me from what—I had no idea back then. Maybe it was something connected to the tracks. But even then… I couldn’t wrap my head around it. If she truly wanted to help me— then why? Why would she shatter my lights? Why would she run? Why would she leave me like that— alone, scared, in the dark?  

  Even now, I haven’t fully wrapped my head around it. But I have a theory. She was there to warn me. She knocked on the window—just to get my attention. But that thing outside… it didn’t like that. It ran toward her. She noticed. And maybe—just maybe—she didn’t want that thing to see me. So she covered my house in darkness. Then she escaped and entered my house so she could warn me there. I’m not entirely convinced. Believe what you want. But it’s the only explanation I’ve got.

  Staying in the garden didn’t feel right, so I went back into the house. But I couldn’t help myself— I glanced toward the woods. Back then, the peaceful view had shifted into something else… like staring into a pit of dread. The trees stood tall, overgrown. Their shadows blanketed whatever might be hiding beneath. And now, looking back… I think I was being watched. Probably stared at the whole time.    

   I figured I’d just walk in, make myself a coffee, and figure out what to do next. And for a moment, it was going exactly that way— until I heard the ringing. The doorbell. Ringing. I stood there, debating if I should open it. Then I heard a voice. Familiar. Too familiar.  

  “Jackie... Jackie, you there, man?”  

  It was Michael. My friend who was 3 years older than me. Honestly, the one person I’d still call my best friend around here— even though we hadn’t really done anything together in the past two weeks. At first, I thought it might be a trick again. Another illusion. Another trap. But then I heard him call me by the nickname. The one only he uses.

  “Come on, don’t make me scared—open up, you hobbit.” Yeah… don’t ask me why he picked that. Sure, I wasn’t the tallest, but somehow he settled on that silly name for me. And what I’d give— to hear it just one last time.  

  In that moment, I knew—it had to be him. I almost rushed to open the door, until I realized I was still holding the shotgun. So I slipped over to the couch, quickly tucked it away under the blanket, and tried to look normal. Not that it really mattered. Because when I opened the door, relieved, even smiling—yet he was not okay.

  Oh God, you scared me, Jackie. You good, man?    —he asked, trying to play it cool. But he sounded genuinely concerned. Despite his always cheerful bravado, he’d always been caring. The kind of guy who wouldn’t leave a friend behind. He was basically the first person I met when I moved here, and with him around, I never felt alone. Even now, my eyes get a little wet thinking about those times with Michael. He was the kind of friend everyone should have in their life.  

  “Yeah, I’m good, I’m good—just… haven’t slept well, you know? Bad dreams and stuff like that. How about you?”  

  “Well, you’re not alone,” he answered. “From what I’ve heard, everyone’s got their sleep schedule messed up. But yeah, I guess I’m… f-fine. Hey, is your phone working?”  

  “Well, uh… I don’t know. I haven’t checked it today yet. Why?”  

  Because nobody’s phone is working around here. Remember the two police officers who were supposed to arrive? They never did. And when we tried to call them, no one picked up. Like there wasn’t even any signal. And the worst part? Everyone’s cars stopped working too. We checked them—engines, batteries, everything seemed fine. But they just… wouldn’t start. 

  That caught me completely off guard. Those two officers last night… they— they weren’t them. I thought to myself. Me and Michael tried both my phone and my car, but neither of them was working.

My car was basically the only thing that didn’t feel outdated— though it had seen better days too. And yet… it stopped working. No issues with the battery. Nothing. Just... dead.  

  Michael took me to another part of the village, where dozens of people had already gathered. From the looks of it— and the air itself— it wasn’t good. The villagers were shouting over one another, voices tangled and chaotic. I could barely make out a single word, but one thing was clear— they were scared.  I was suprised nobody mentioned the shooting sound from my shotgun tho.

  Sometimes, through the chaos, I caught scattered voices: “Have you seen him?” “Where is he?” “I saw something in my house.” Were other people going missing? Had… had they seen what I did? I asked myself, unsettled. And that’s when a woman stepped forward and shouted— loud enough to cut through every conversation. Everyone stopped mid-sentence. The woman was Valeria. Twenty-five. Young, pretty, and stubborn as hell. I’d always wanted to ask her out— maybe a date, maybe just coffee— but I never did.  

  “Alright, I know you’re all scared. Something is happening here. You’re not alone—I’m scared too. But we can’t let fear take over. We have to think rationally. Even without cars, I have an idea. If you’ve got a bike, grab a few essentials and come with me. We’ll try to reach the nearest police station. I know it sounds stupid— but what else can we do?”  

  The villagers looked at one another, murmuring quietly before nodding in agreement. They realized this was probably the best option. A few people stepped forward to join her. One was Peter, the nearby food store shopkeeper. Another was Elizabeth, who always sold homemade vests. And then there was Patrick— a guy I honestly can’t tell you much about. Michael only had a car, and I had a bike that probably wouldn’t survive the first three miles. So it was settled: they would head to the police station themselves, while the rest of us stayed behind, waiting in our homes.  

  It was strange, though. Cars or phones can stop working, sure— but not all of them at the same time. We were basically trapped here. No way out. No connection to the outside world. Surrounded by… woods. Whith no idea that later we wont be alone....any longer.

Both married (M 39) (F 38),"(M 39) have a complex relationship with one of my coworkers (F 38). We’ve worked adjacent for a few years but in the last couple months we’ve started working directly with each other so we’re talking WAY more. It feels like we have a “work marriage”. We’re both married. We message each other constantly and when we run into each other at work we end up talking and joking for like half an hour. There’s not really any flirting but we’re so playful with each other I’d be embarrassed if either of our spouses read them. I’ve noticed I can get kind of territorial with her too when other guys talk to her. She engages in light touching when we’re joking around. 

I have no intention in leaving my wife (relationship far from perfect but don’t want to blow up my life) but I can feel attachment for this work colleague growing and I’m comparing my wife to my coworker a lot. Initially I didn’t feel much sexual attraction to her but lately that’s changed and I’m experiencing some sexual fantasies involving her. The problem is I really enjoy our friendship and don’t want to turn cold on her because of nothing that’s her fault, plus I really don’t know if she feels anything similar; part of me is worried I developed feelings for a “nice woman” like those guys who fall for their baristas at a coffee shop. Any advice from someone who was in a similar situation would be appreciated.


TL;DR

I (M 39) have developed feelings for a coworker (F 38). We message each other constantly and talk for a while when we run into each other at work. We’re both married and our messages would embarrass me if either spouse read them. Turning into attraction on my part. Need advice.

The US doesn't grow coffee, as I recall, and I think that Dole has long ago closed all its commercial pineapple cultivation in Hawaii.  What about other ""tropical"" fruits -- even including bananas?  Are those being actively tariffed right now?

1lzqfyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1lzqfyq/tips_for_a_beginner/,Tips for a beginner,"Hi all,

After having a couple of very difficult months in my personal life, i'm now ready to move on from feeling lost and sad. These last months I couldn't get myself to eat healthy and exercise but now this has to change and intermittent fasting is a huge step in the right direction.

I was always intrigued by intermittent fasting since I couldn't comprehend not eating for such a long time haha. But now I want to challenge myself and find the discipline to keep up this healthy way of living. Also i've read some great success stories on here (well done everybody!)

My goals are (in order or priority):

1. Lose weight. Currently at about 100kg at 175 cm, should be able to get to 80 kg

2. Improve stamina

3. Muscle building. I have a pretty muscular build so it would be primarily to get some better shape overall

My original plan is to do a 16h/8h plan and only drink water or black coffee during fasting. I also got myself  a gym membership but i'm currently trying to figure out how to time this ideal with my meals. I work from 7:00 to 15:30 and would prefer to workout directly out of work. 

So as a complete rookie I really would appreciate some tips and tricks. How to plan and fill in meals/workouts, how to deal with the hunger, do I need to look into special diëts with whey proteins or supplements? What are some common pitfalls and how to avoid falling into them?

I would really appreciate the help from this community and I can't wait to really get started. Thanks in advance :)",1,1752509142.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

1lzqcwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lzqcwr/oblivion_by_jennifer_l_armentrout/,Oblivion by Jennifer L. Armentrout:," Chapter 1  
  
  Faster than any human eye could track, I moved soundlessly among the trees in my true form, racing over the thick grass and the dewy, moss-covered rocks. I was nothing more than a blur of light, speeding along the tree line. Being an alien from a planet thirteen billion light years away was pretty much made of awesome.  
  
  I easily passed one of those damn energy efficient cars that was coasting up the main road past my house.  
  
  How in the hell was that thing pulling a U-Haul trailer?  
  
  Not like that was important.  
  
  I slowed down and slipped into my human form, keeping to the thick shadows cast by the oak trees as the car went by the empty house at the start of the access road, and then grinded to a halt in front of the house next to mine.  
  
  “Shit. Neighbors,” I muttered as the driver’s car door opened and a middle-age woman stepped out. I watched as she bent down and spoke to someone else in the car.  
  
  She laughed and then ordered, “Get out of the car.”  
  
  Whoever was with her didn’t listen, and the woman eventually closed the car door. She all but bounced up the porch steps and unlocked the front door.  
  
  How could this be happening? The house was meant to stay vacant—any house around here was supposed to remain empty of humans. This road was the freaking gate to the Luxen colony at the base of Seneca Rocks, and it wasn’t like this house went up for sale and those suited assholes didn’t realize it.  
  
  This could not be happening.  
  
  Energy crackled over my skin, humming, and the urge to slip back into my true form was hard to ignore. And that pissed me off. Home was the only place that I—that we could be ourselves without fear of discovery, and those assholes—the Department of Defense, the D-O-fucking-D—knew it.  
  
  My fingers curled into my palms.  
  
  Vaughn and Lane, my own personal government-issued babysitters, had to have been aware of this. It must’ve slipped their damn minds when they checked in on us last week.  
  
  The passenger door of the Prius creaked open, drawing my attention. At first, I couldn’t see who got out, but then she walked around the front of the car, coming completely into view.  
  
  “Oh shit,” I muttered again.  
  
  It was a girl.  
  
  From what I could see, she was close to my age, maybe a year younger, and as she turned in a slow circle, staring at the forest that crept onto the lawn around the two houses, she looked like she expected a rabid mountain lion to pounce on her.  
  
  Her steps were tentative as she neared the porch, as if she was still debating if she really wanted to walk into the house. The woman, who I was guessing was her mom based on the similar dark hair, had left the front door open. The girl stopped at the bottom of the steps.  
  
  I sized her up as I drifted silently through the trees. She appeared of average height. Actually, everything about her seemed average—her dark brown hair, pulled back from her face in a messy knot; her pale, roundish face; her average weight—definitely not one of those skinny girls I hated—and her… Okay. Not all of her appeared average. My gaze was hung up on her legs and other areas.  
  
  Damn, they were nice legs.  
  
  The girl turned around, facing the forest as her arms folded along her waist, just below her chest.  
  
  Okay. Two areas in particular were not average.  
  
  She scanned the line of trees and her gaze stopped—stopped right where I was standing. My hands opened at my sides, but I didn’t move, didn’t dare force my lungs to take a breath. She stared right at me.  
  
  But there was no way she could see me. I was too hidden among the shadows.  
  
  A handful of seconds passed before she unfolded her arms and turned, slowly heading into the house, leaving the door wide open behind her.  
  
  “Mom?”  
  
  My head cocked to the side at the sound of her voice, which was also…average. No real discernible accent or indication of where they came from.  
  
  Wherever it was, they must have no sense of personal safety, since neither of them thought to close the door behind them. Then again, around these parts, most humans believed they were completely safe. After all, the town of Ketterman, located just outside of Petersburg, West Virginia, wasn’t even incorporated. Deputies spent more time chasing after roaming cattle and breaking up field parties than handling any real crime.  
  
  Even though humans did have a nasty habit of going missing around here.  
  
  The smirk twisting my lips faded as an image of Dawson formed in my thoughts. Not just humans…  
  
  When I thought of my brother, anger bubbled inside me, rushing to the surface like a volcano about to erupt. He was gone—dead because of a human girl. And now there was another damn one moving in next door.  
  
  We had to…simulate humans, blend among them, and even act like them, but being close to them always ended in disaster.  
  
  Always ended in someone missing or dead.  
  
  I had no idea how long I stood there, staring at the house, but the girl eventually appeared again. Pulled out of my thoughts, I straightened as she walked to the back of the U-Haul. She dug a key out of her pocket and then opened the metal door.  
  
  Or tried.  
  
  And tried some more.  
  
  She struggled with the lock and then with the lever for what had to be the longest amount of time in history. Her cheeks were flushed, lips pursed. She looked like she was seconds from kicking the back of the U-Haul. Good God, how long did it take one person to open a trailer door? She made it a marathon event. I was half tempted to make myself known and walk my ass over there and open the damn door for her.  
  
  Finally, after an eternity, she opened the trailer and pulled down the ramp. She disappeared in and reappeared moments later with a box. I watched her carry it in and then return again. Back up the ramp, she stumbled down it this time, carrying a box that had to weigh more than her by the strained look on her face.  
  
  She shuffled around the trailer, and even from where I stood, I could see her arms trembling. I closed my eyes, irritated over…everything. She’d made it to the steps, and I knew there was no way she was going to get the box up that porch without falling and possibly breaking her neck.  
  
  I raised my brows.  
  
  If she broke her neck, then I guessed that solved the whole “moving in next door” problem.  
  
  One foot made it onto the bottom step and she teetered to one side. If she fell then, she would be okay. She made it up another step, and my stomach growled. Damn, I was hungry even though I’d eaten about ten pancakes an hour ago.  
  
  She was almost to the top of the steps, and granted, if she fell, she wasn’t going to break her neck. Maybe an arm? A leg would be pushing it. As she planted a foot on the next step and then slowly lifted the other foot beside it, I was reluctantly impressed by her sheer determination to muscle that box into the house. When she wobbled dangerously at the top, I muttered a rather obscene list of curse words and raised my hand.  
  
  Zeroing in on the box in her hands, I tapped into the Source. In my mind, I focused on raising the box just the slightest, taking the brunt of the weight off her arms. She stopped on the porch just for the tiniest of seconds, as if she recognized the change, and then with a shake of her head, she walked into the house.  
  
  Slowly, I lowered my hand, somewhat shocked by what I had done. There was no way she could ever guess that some random dude standing in the woods was responsible for that, but man, that was still a dumbass move on my part.  
  
  There was always the risk of exposure whenever we used the Source, no matter how insignificant it was.  
  
  The girl reappeared again on the porch, her cheeks bright pink from the work so far, and headed back to the cargo container as she wiped her hands along her denim shorts. Once again, she stumbled out of the trailer with a box of death in her arms, and I had to wonder: whe  
re in the hell was her mother?  
  
  The girl’s step faltered and the obviously heavy box rattled. Glass was inside.  
  
  And because I was competing for world’s biggest dumbass, I stayed out there, in the trees, stomach grumbling like a damn engine, and helped her carry in box after box without her even knowing.  
  
  By the time she/we finished hauling every last item into her house, I was wiped, starving, and certain I’d risked tapping into the Source enough to get my damn head examined. I hauled my tired ass up the steps to my house and slipped inside quietly. No one else was around tonight, and I was too exhausted to cook, so I gulped down half a gallon of milk and then passed out on the couch.  
  
  My last thought was of my annoying new neighbor and my too-awesome-to-fail plan to never see her again.  
  
  Night had fallen, and thick clouds, dark and impenetrable, blocked out the stars and covered the moon, squelching even the tiniest amount of light. No one could see me. Which was probably a good thing.  
  
  Especially considering I was standing outside the once-empty house like a total creeper in one of those true-crime shows—yet again. So much for my never-see-the-chick-again plan.  
  
  This was quickly becoming a disturbing habit. I tried to argue with myself that it was necessary. I needed to know more about our new neighbor before my twin sister, Dee, spotted her and decided they were gonna be besties. Dee was all I had left in this world, and I’d do anything to protect her.  
  
  Glancing over at my house, I blew out an aggravated breath through my nose. Would it be such a terrible thing if I just, I don’t know, just burned the damn house down? I mean, I wouldn’t let those…those humans inside burn or anything. I wasn’t that terrible. But no house, no problem.  
  
  Seemed simple to me.  
  
  The last thing I needed was another problem—the last thing any of us needed.  
  
  A light was on in one of the bedrooms upstairs despite the fact that it was late. It was her bedroom. Only a handful of minutes ago, I’d seen the outline of her pass in front of the windows. Sadly, she was completely clothed.  
  
  That disappointment took creeper status to a whole new level.  
  
  The girl was a problem, a big one, but I had all the working guy parts, which sometimes zeroed out the whole problem thing.  
  
  Having someone move next door, someone who was our age, was just too risky. This girl had only been here two days, but it was just a matter of time before Dee saw her. She’d already asked me a couple of times if I’d seen the new neighbors, if I knew who they were. I’d shrugged and said probably just an old couple retiring to the country to ward off her initial enthusiasm, but I knew Dee’s excitable personality would be impossible to contain for long.  
  
  Speaking of the hyper devil…  
  
  “Daemon,” a voice whispered from the shadows of my front porch. “What in the world are you doing out here?”  
  
  Debating on whether or not burning down a house next time they head to the store is a reasonable response to getting new neighbors?  
  
  Yeah, I was gonna keep that one to myself.  
  
  Sighing, I pivoted around and headed toward the porch. Gravel crunched under my boots. My sister was leaning against the railing, staring at the house next door, a curious expression pinching her face as a soft breeze tossed her long, dark hair around her.  
  
  It took unbelievable effort to walk at a normal speed as I joined Dee. Normally, it wasn’t something I even attempted when I was home since I could move fast as light, but with the new neighbors, I needed to get back in the habit of appearing…well, human.  
  
  “I was out patrolling.” I cocked a hip against the railing, my back to the house as if it didn’t exist.  
  
  Dee raised a brow as she glanced up at me. Bright emerald eyes, the same color as mine, were filled with skepticism. “It didn’t look like that.”  
  
  “Really?” I crossed my arms.  
  
  “Yeah.” Her gaze flicked over my shoulder. “It looked like you were standing outside that house, watching it.”  
  
  “Uh-huh.”  
  
  Her brows knitted. “So, someone has moved in there?”  
  
  Dee had been over at the Thompsons’ house the last couple of days, which was a freaking blessing even though the idea of her being there with another alien our age, Adam, overnight did not make me a happy camper. But it worked out. She had no idea who had moved in next door, and knowing her, a human girl of her age would be like discovering an abandoned puppy.  
  
  When I didn’t answer, she sighed heavily. “Okay. Am I supposed to guess?”  
  
  “Yeah, some people moved in next door.”  
  
  Her eyes widened as she whipped back around and leaned out over the railing, eyeing the house as if she could see through it. While our abilities were pretty awesome, we didn’t have X-ray vision. “Oh my, they’re not Luxen. They’re humans.”  
  
  Obviously she would’ve sensed if they were of our kind. “Yep. They’re human.”  
  
  She shook her head slightly. “But why? Do they know about us?”  
  
  I thought of the girl struggling to carry the boxes inside the other day. “I’m gonna go with a no.”  
  
  “That’s so weird. Why would the DOD let them move in there?” she asked, and then immediately added, “Who cares? I hope they’re nice.”  
  
  My eyes drifted shut. Of course Dee wouldn’t be worried about it, not even after what happened to Dawson. All she cared about was if they were nice. It didn’t even occur to her, not for one second, the kind of danger the close proximity of a human posed to us. Not my sister. She was all unicorns puking rainbows.  
  
  “Did you see who they were?” she asked, excitement crowding her voice.  
  
  “No,” I lied, opening my eyes.  
  
  Her lips pursed as she drew back from the railing, clapping her hands, and turned to me. We were almost the same height, and I could see delight sparkling in her eyes. “I hope it’s a hot guy.”  
  
  I clenched my jaw.  
  
  She giggled. “Oh! Maybe it’s a girl, like, my age. That would be awesome.”  
  
  Oh God.  
  
  “It would make this summer so much better, especially since Ash is being a you-know-what,” she went on.  
  
  “No. I don’t know what.”  
  
  She rolled her eyes. “Don’t play innocent, you jerk. You know exactly why she’s as cuddly as a honey badger right now. She thought you two would be spending all summer together doing—”  
  
  “Each other?” I suggested slyly.  
  
  “Oh, gross! Seriously. I wasn’t going there.” She shuddered, and I barely hid my grin as I wondered if Ash had admitted that the doing-each-other part still happened although not in a while. Not often, but it did. “She was complaining about not going wherever you promised to take her this summer.”  
  
  I had no idea what Dee was talking about.  
  
  “Anyway, I really hope whoever is next door is cool.” Like a hamster on a wheel, Dee’s mind kept on cycling. “Maybe I’ll stop over—”  
  
  “Don’t even finish that sentence, Dee. You don’t know who they are or what they’re like. Stay away from them.”  
  
  She placed her hands on her hips as her eyes narrowed. “How will we know what kind of people they are by staying away from them?”  
  
  “I’ll check them out.”  
  
  “I don’t particularly trust your judgment of humans, Daemon.” Her stare turned into a glare.  
  
  “And I don’t trust yours. Just like I never trusted Dawson’s.”  
  
  Dee took a step back as she drew in a deep, slow breath. The anger faded out of her expression. “Okay, I understand. I get why—”  
  
  “Let’s not go there. Not tonight,” I said, sighing as I lifted my hand and scrunched my fingers through my hair, making the ends stick up. I needed a haircut. “It’s late and I need to make another round before I call it a night.”  
  
  “Another round?” Her voice had dropped to a whisper. “Do you think…any of the Arum are nearby?”  
  
  I shook my head, not wanting her to worry, but the truth was they were always nearby and they were our only natural predator—our enemies from the time wh  
en our true planet existed. Like us, they weren’t from this Earth. They were, in many ways, the exact opposite of us in appearance and abilities. But we didn’t kill like they did. Oh no. They derived their use of the Source from feeding off the Luxen they killed. They were like parasites on steroids. The Elders used to tell us that when the universe was formed, it was filled with the purest light, making those who lived in the shadows—the Arum—envious. They’d become jealous and determined to suffocate all the light. That was how the war started between our two planets.  
  
  And our parents died in that war, when our home was destroyed.  
  
  The Arum had followed us here, using atmospheric displays to travel to Earth without detection. Whenever there was a meteorite shower or a rash of falling stars, I was on edge. The Arum usually followed such occurrences.  
  
  Fighting them wasn’t easy. We could either take them out with the Source directly or with obsidian—sharpened into a blade, it was deadly to the Arum, especially after they’d fed. It fractured light. Getting ahold of it wasn’t easy, either, but I tried to always keep one on me, usually attached to my ankle. So did Dee.  
  
  Never knew when you’d need it.  
  
  “I just want to be careful,” I said finally.  
  
  “You’re always careful.”  
  
  I smiled tightly.  
  
  She hesitated and then sprang forward. Stretching up on the tips of her toes, she kissed my cheek. “You can be a demanding jerkface, but I love you. Just wanted you to know.”  
  
  Chuckling, I wrapped an arm around her shoulders and briefly pulled her in for a hug. “You can be an annoying chatterbox, but I love you, too.”  
  
  Dee slapped my arm as she stepped back, once again smiling. “Don’t be too late.”  
  
  I nodded and then watched her dart into the house. Dee rarely did anything slowly. She’d always been the one with the endless energy. Dawson had been the laidback one. And I was—I laughed under my breath—the jerkface one.  
  
  We’d been triplets.  
  
  Now we were just twins.  
  
  Several moments passed as I stared at the spot my sister had stood in. She was one of the only things left on this planet that I genuinely cared about. I turned my attention back to the house. I wasn’t even going to lie to myself about this. The moment Dee realized it was a girl next door, she was going to be all over her like barnacles on a hull—a crusty, seen-better-days hull. And no one could resist my sister. She was a damn fluffy ball of hyped-up sunshine.  
  
  We lived among humans, but we didn’t get close to them for a metric ton of reasons. And I wasn’t going to let Dee make the same mistake that Dawson had. I’d failed Dawson, but that wasn’t going to happen to Dee. I would do anything to keep her alive and safe. Anything.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  Pressing my forehead against the glass, I cursed under my breath, mainly because I was staring out the window—at that house. Waiting. I was waiting. There were better things to do than this. Like beating my head against cement. Or listening to Dee describe in painful detail every intricate and disturbingly personal attribute of each of those guys in that band she loved.  
  
  I forced myself away from the window, yawning as I rubbed my palm along my jaw. Damn near three days later and a part of me still couldn’t believe people had moved into the house next door. Could be worse, I decided in that moment. Our new neighbor could be a dude. Then I’d have to lock Dee in her bedroom.  
  
  Or at least it could have been a girl who looked like a dude. That would’ve been helpful, but oh no, she didn’t look like a guy at all. She was average, I reminded myself, but definitely not a dude.  
  
  With a wave of my hand, I turned on the TV and flipped through the channels until I found a repeat of Ghost Investigators. I’d seen this episode before, but it was always fun watching the humans run out of the house because they thought they saw something glowing. I lounged on the couch with my legs on the coffee table and tried to forget about the girl with not-so-average tan legs and a killer ass.  
  
  I’d seen her a total of two times before today.  
  
  Obviously the day she moved in, when I’d been a dumbass and helped her from afar. I wanted to punch myself in the gonads for that. Sure, she didn’t know that I’d lessened the weight of the boxes so she didn’t fall right over, but I shouldn’t have done it. I knew better.  
  
  I’d seen her yesterday. She’d dashed out toward a sedan and grabbed a stack of books out of the car. Her face had lit up with the biggest smile, as if the leaning tower of books were really a million bucks.  
  
  It was all very—not cute. What the hell was I thinking? Not cute at all.  
  
  Man, it was hot in here. Leaning forward, I grabbed the back of my shirt and pulled it over my head. I tossed it to the side and idly rubbed my chest. I’d been walking around shirtless more than ever since she’d moved in.  
  
  Wait. I’d seen her three times if I counted seeing her through the window last night.  
  
  Dammit, I needed to get out and do something. Preferably something that required working up one hell of a sweat.  
  
  Before I knew it, I’d stalked across the room and ended up right in front of the window. Again. I didn’t want to examine why too closely.  
  
  I brushed the curtain aside, scowling. Hadn’t even spoken to the girl and I felt like a stalker staring out the window, waiting once more…waiting for what? To catch a glimpse of her? Or to better prepare myself for the inevitable meeting?  
  
  If Dee saw me now, she’d be on the floor laughing.  
  
  And if Ash saw me right now, she’d scratch out my eyes and blast my new neighbor into outer space. Ash and her brothers had arrived from Lux about the same time as we did, and a relationship just sort of…happened…more from proximity than I could honestly say real emotion. We hadn’t dated for months, but I knew she still expected that we’d end up together eventually. Not because she really wanted me, but it was expected of us…so of course she probably didn’t want me with anyone else. I still cared for her, though, and I couldn’t remember a time without her and her brothers around.  
  
  I caught movement out of the corner of my eye. Turning slightly, I saw the screen door on the wide porch next door swing shut. Shit.  
  
  I shifted my gaze and caught her hurrying off the porch.  
  
  I wondered where she was going. Not much to do around here, and it wasn’t like she knew anyone. There hadn’t been any traffic next door, with the exception of her mom coming and going at odd hours.  
  
  The girl stopped in front of her car, smoothing her hands down her shorts. My lips curved up at the corners.  
  
  All of a sudden, she veered toward the left, and I straightened. I fisted my hand around the curtain, and my breath got stuck somewhere in my chest. No, she was not coming over here. She had no reason. Dee didn’t even realize there was a girl here yet. No reason…  
  
  Oh hell, she was coming here.  
  
  Letting go of the curtain, I backed away from the window and turned toward the front door. I closed my eyes, counting the seconds and reminding myself of the valuable lesson learned at Dawson’s expense. Humans were dangerous to us. Just being around them was a risk—getting too close to a human inevitably ended with one of us leaving a trace of the Source on them. And since Dee was obsessed with befriending anything that breathed, it would be especially dangerous for this girl. She lived right next door, and there’d be no way I could control how much time Dee spent with her.  
  
  And then there was the fact that I’d been, you know, watching her. That could possibly be a problem. I clenched my fists at my sides.  
  
  My sister wouldn’t have the same fate as Dawson. There was no way I could bear the loss of her, and it had been a human girl who had brought him down, led an Arum right to him. Time and time again it had happened with our kind. It wasn’t necessarily the human’s fault, but the end result was always the same. I refused to let anyone put Dee in danger, unknowingly or not. It didn’t matter. Throwing out my hand, I flung the coffee table across the room but caught myself and pulled back just before it crashed into the wall. Taking a deep breath, I settled it back down on four legs.  
  
  A soft, almost tentative knock rapped against our front door. Shit.  
  
  I exhaled roughly. Ignore it. That was what I needed to do, but I was moving toward the door, opening it before I even knew it. A rush of warm air wash  
ed over my skin, carrying the faint scent of peach and vanilla.  
  
  Man, did I love peaches, all sweet and sticky.  
  
  My gaze dropped. She was short—shorter than I’d realized. The top of her head only came up to my chest. Maybe that was why she was staring at it. Or maybe it was the fact I hadn’t had the inkling to put on my shirt.  
  
  I knew she liked what she saw. Everyone did. Ash had once said it was the combination of dark, wavy hair and green eyes, the hard jaw and full lips. Sexy, she’d said. I was hot. Might sound arrogant, but it was the truth.  
  
  Since she was blatantly checking me out, I figured I could do the same. Why not? She came knocking on my door.  
  
  The girl… She wasn’t cute. Her hair, not really blond or brown, was out of the messy bun, and it was long, hanging over her shoulders. She was short as hell, barely five and a half feet. Still, her legs seemed to stretch forever. Dragging my eyes away from her legs took effort.  
  
  Eventually, my gaze landed on the front of her shirt. my blog is better than your vlog. What in the world did that mean? And why would she have that on her shirt… And the words blog and better were stretched taut. I swallowed. Not a good sign.  
  
  I lifted my gaze with even more effort.  
  
  Her face was round, nose pert, and skin smooth. I bet a million dollars her eyes were brown—big, old doe eyes.  
  
  Crazy as hell, but I could feel her eyes as her gaze made the slow perusal from where my jeans hung from my hips, back up to my face. She sucked in a sharp breath, which overshadowed my own inhale.  
  
  Her eyes weren’t brown, but they were large and round, a pale shade of heather gray—intelligent and clear eyes. They were beautiful. Even I could admit that.  
  
  And it pissed me off. All of this pissed me off. Why was I checking her out? Why was she even here? I frowned. “Can I help you?”  
  
  No answer. She stared at me with this look on her face, like she wanted me to kiss those full, pouty lips of hers. Heat stirred in the pit of my stomach.  
  
  “Hello?” I caught the edge in my voice—anger, lust, annoyance, more lust. Humans are weak, a risk…Dawson is dead because of a human—a human just like this one. I kept repeating that over and over again. I placed my hand on the doorframe, fingers digging into the wood as I leaned forward. “Are you capable of speaking?”  
  
  That got her attention, snapping her right out of the ogling. Her cheeks turned a pretty shade of pink as she stepped back. Good. She was leaving. That’s what I wanted—for her to turn and rush away. Running a hand through my hair, I glanced over her shoulder and then back. Still there.  
  
  She really needed to get her cute ass off my porch before I did something stupid. Like smile at the way she was blushing. Sexy, even. And definitely not average. “Going once…”  
  
  The flush deepened. Hell. “I…I was wondering if you knew where the closest grocery store is. My name is Katy.”  
  
  Katy. Her name was Katy. Reminded me of Kitty. Kitty cat. Kitten. Look at me, putting all these words together.  
  
  “I moved next door.” She gestured at her house. “Like, almost three days ago…”  
  
  “I know.” I’ve been watching you for almost three days, like a stalker.  
  
  “Well, I was hoping someone would know the quickest way to the grocery store and maybe a place that sold plants.”  
  
  “Plants?”  
  
  Her eyes narrowed just the slightest, and I forced my face to remain expressionless. She fidgeted some more with the hem of her shorts. “Yeah, see, there’s this flower bed in front—”  
  
  I arched a brow. “Okay.”  
  
  Now her eyes were thin slits, and irritation heightened the blush and rolled off her. Amusement stirred deep inside me. I knew I was being an ass at this point, but I was perversely enjoying the spunk slowly igniting behind her eyes, baiting me. And…the flush of anger was sort of hot in a weird, there’s-really-something-wrong-with-me kind of way. She reminded me of something…  
  
  She tried again. “Well, see, I need to go buy plants—”  
  
  “For the flower bed. I got that.” I leaned my hip against the doorframe, crossing my arms. This was actually almost fun.  
  
  She took a deep breath. “I’d like to find a store where I can buy groceries and plants.” Her tone was one that I used with Dee about a thousand times a day. Adorable.  
  
  “You are aware this town has only one stoplight, right?” And there it was. The spark in her eyes was a blazing fire now, and I was fighting a full-on grin. Damn, she wasn’t just cute anymore. She was much, much more, and my stomach sank.  
  
  The girl stared at me, incredulous. “You know, all I wanted were directions. This is obviously a bad time.”  
  
  Thinking of Dawson, my lip curled into a sneer. Playtime was over. I had to nip this in the bud. For Dee’s sake. “Anytime is a bad time for you to come knocking on my door, kid.”  
  
  “Kid?” she repeated, eyes widening. “I’m not a kid. I’m seventeen.”  
  
  “Is that so?” Hell, as if I didn’t already notice she was all grown up. Nothing about her reminded me of a kid, but dammit, as Dee would say, I had piss-poor social skills. “You look like you’re twelve. No. Maybe thirteen, but my sister has this doll that kinda reminds me of you. All big-eyed and vacant.”  
  
  Her mouth dropped open, and I realized that I may have gone a little too far with that last statement. Well, it was for the better. If she hated me, she’d stay away from Dee. It worked with most of the girls. Ah, most of them.  
  
  Okay. That didn’t work with a lot of girls, but they didn’t live next door, so what the hell ever.  
  
  “Yeah, wow. Sorry to bother you. I won’t be knocking on your door again. Trust me.” She started to turn, but not quickly enough that I didn’t see the sudden glisten in those gray eyes.  
  
  Dammit. Now I felt like the biggest dick ever. And Dee would flip if she saw me acting like this. Stringing together a dozen or so curses in my mind, I called out to her. “Hey.”  
  
  She stopped on the bottom step, keeping her back to me. “What?”  
  
  “You get on Route 2 and turn onto U.S. 220 North, not South. Takes you into Petersburg.” I sighed, wishing I’d never answered the door. “The Foodland is right in town. You can’t miss it. Well, maybe you could. There’s a hardware store next door, I think. They should have things that go in the ground.”  
  
  “Thanks,” she muttered and added under her breath, “douchebag.”  
  
  Did she just call me a douchebag? What decade were we in? I laughed, genuinely amused by that. “Now that’s not very ladylike, Kittycat.”  
  
  She whipped around. “Don’t ever call me that.”  
  
  Oh, I must’ve hit a sore spot there. I pushed out the door. “It’s better than calling someone a douchebag, isn’t it? This has been a stimulating visit. I’ll cherish it for a long time to come.”  
  
  Her little hands balled into fists. I think she wanted to hit me. I think I might’ve liked it. And I think I seriously needed help.  
  
  “You know, you’re right. How wrong of me to call you a douchebag. Because a douchebag is too nice of a word for you.” She smiled sweetly. “You’re a dickhead.”  
  
  “A dickhead?” It would be too easy to like this girl. “How charming.”  
  
  She flipped me off.  
  
  I laughed again, lowering my head. “Very civilized, Kitten. I’m sure you have a wide array of interesting names and gestures for me, but not interested.”  
  
  And she looked like she did. Part of me was a bit disappointed when she spun around and stomped off. I waited until she yanked open her car door and because I really was an ass…  
  
  “See you later, Kitten!” I called out, chuckling when she looked like she was about to race back to the door and kangaroo kick me.  
  
  Slamming the door shut behind me, I leaned against it and laughed again, but the laugh ended in a groan. There’d been a moment where I’d seen what flickered behind the disbelief and anger in those soulful gray eyes. Hurt. Knowing that I’d hurt her feelings made the acid in my stomach churn.  
  
  Which was stupid, because last night, I’d considere  
d an arson-assisted relocation plan and hadn’t felt guilty then. But that was before I saw her up close and all kinds of personal. Before I actually spoke to her. Before I realized her eyes were intelligent and beautiful.  
  
  Returning to the living room, I wasn’t at all surprised to find my sister standing in front of the TV, her slender arms crossed and green eyes burning. She looked just like that girl’s expression—like she wanted to kick me in the nuts.  
  
  I gave her a wide berth as I headed to the couch and dropped down on it, feeling a dozen years older than the eighteen I was. “You’re blocking the screen.”  
  
  “Why?” she demanded.  
  
  “It’s a damn good episode.” I knew that wasn’t what she was talking about. “The one guy thinks he’s possessed by a shadow person or some—”  
  
  “I don’t give a crap about a shadow person, Daemon!” She lifted

It said my streak was 1. I then finished Sunday and it returned my streak to what it was prior to Sunday (in the 1000s). 

The long version: I was nearly finished with the Sunday puzzle when our power went out. I usually complete weekend puzzles on my laptop, so I figured I would wait till the power was restored to get back on WiFi. I probably had three clues left to solve.

The power didn’t come back on until late in the evening, and by then I had forgotten to finish the puzzle. Woke up this morning to do my normal routine … some coffee, spelling bee, and then the crossword. 

I finished today’s puzzle, and upon completion it said my streak was 1. My heart sank, because I realized I had forgotten to finish the Sunday puzzle! My streak was at 1,035 before that, and my goal was to get three straight years before I would try to stop caring about it (easier said than done). 

So I quickly finished Sunday’s puzzle immediately afterwards, went to the main games page, refreshed the page, and somehow it allowed me to keep my streak. It’s now 1,037. 

I had assumed my streak wouldn’t count if completed out of order, so now I’m not sure how the NYT operates.

Drowning in the sea of social media noise? Feeling like your competitor's content is everywhere while yours gathers dust? You're not alone! Many US small businesses struggle to make their mark online without breaking the bank. But guess what? You can level the playing field. This guide provides a no-cost, actionable social media strategy that will help you rise above the competition and attract your ideal customers.

**The Challenge:**

The landscape of social media marketing is constantly evolving. It can feel overwhelming, especially when you're juggling a million other things. Most small businesses face these common hurdles: limited budgets, lack of time, and uncertainty about which platforms to prioritize. Throw in the ever-changing algorithms, and it's easy to feel defeated. The biggest challenge? Creating engaging content that resonates with your target audience and cuts through the digital clutter.

**Unlock Social Media Supremacy: The No-Cost Game Plan**

This isn’t about vanity metrics; it's about building a community, driving traffic, and generating leads. Let's break down the steps to social media success, all without emptying your wallet.

*   **Step 1: Know Your Audience (Inside and Out):** Before you post anything, define your ideal customer. Where do they hang out online? What are their pain points? What kind of content do they engage with? Conduct simple online polls, use free social listening tools (mentioned below), and analyze your competitor's followers to gather insights.

    *   **Brief Example/Hypothetical Case:** Let's say you run a local bakery. Instead of just posting pictures of pastries, research your target audience (e.g., busy parents, young professionals). You might discover they're looking for quick breakfast ideas or gluten-free options. Tailor your content accordingly, sharing recipes, tips, and behind-the-scenes glimpses of your baking process.
    *   **Pro-Tip:** Don't assume you know your audience. Continuously gather data and adapt your strategy as needed.

*   **Step 2: Choose Your Battlegrounds Wisely:** Don't try to be everywhere at once. Focus on 1-2 platforms where your target audience is most active. For visually appealing products, Instagram and Pinterest might be ideal. For professional services, LinkedIn could be a better fit.

    *   **Brief Example/Hypothetical Case:** A freelance web designer targeting small businesses might focus on LinkedIn and Twitter. They can share valuable articles, participate in industry discussions, and showcase their portfolio.
    *   **Common Pitfall:** Spreading yourself too thin across multiple platforms. This leads to inconsistent content and diluted results.

*   **Step 3: Content is King (and Queen):** Create high-quality, engaging content that provides value to your audience. This doesn't mean you need expensive equipment or a professional photographer. A smartphone and a little creativity can go a long way. Types of content to consider:
    *   Informative blog posts or articles (link to them from social)
    *   Behind-the-scenes glimpses of your business
    *   Customer testimonials or success stories
    *   Interactive polls and quizzes
    *   Short, engaging videos (e.g., tutorials, product demos)
    *   Eye-catching graphics and images
    *   User-generated content (encourage your customers to share their experiences)

    *   **Brief Example/Hypothetical Case:** A local coffee shop could create short videos showcasing their brewing techniques or interviewing loyal customers.
    *   **Pro-Tip:** Repurpose your content. Turn a blog post into a series of social media updates, or create a video based on a frequently asked question.

*   **Step 4: Consistency is Key:** Develop a content calendar and stick to it. This helps you stay organized and ensures you're consistently posting fresh content. Even posting 3-4 times per week is better than sporadic bursts of activity.

    *   **Common Pitfall:** Posting sporadically or only when you have time. This makes it difficult to build momentum and engage your audience.

*   **Step 5: Engage, Engage, Engage:** Social media is a two-way street. Respond to comments and messages promptly, participate in relevant conversations, and build relationships with your followers.

    *   **Brief Example/Hypothetical Case:** If someone asks a question about your product, answer it thoroughly and politely. If someone leaves a positive review, thank them for their feedback.
    *   **Pro-Tip:** Don't be afraid to show your personality and have some fun!

*   **Step 6: Leverage Free Tools:** Plenty of free tools can help you manage your social media presence. These are outlined below.

*   **Step 7: Monitor and Adapt:** Track your results and see what's working and what's not. Pay attention to your engagement rates, website traffic, and lead generation. Use this data to refine your strategy and improve your results.

    *   **Common Pitfall:** Ignoring your analytics and blindly posting content without knowing what resonates with your audience.

*   **Canva:** A free graphic design tool for creating eye-catching visuals for your social media posts. It's user-friendly, has a ton of templates, and is an invaluable resource for crafting a visually appealing presence.
*   **Buffer/Hootsuite (Free Plans):** Social media management platforms that allow you to schedule posts in advance, track your analytics, and manage multiple accounts. The free plans are typically sufficient for most small businesses getting started.
*   **Google Alerts:** Monitor mentions of your brand, your competitors, and relevant keywords online. This helps you stay informed about what people are saying about your industry and identify opportunities for engagement.
*   **AnswerThePublic:** A great tool for finding questions that people are asking online related to your industry. Use these questions to create content that addresses your audience's needs and pain points.

What are your biggest social media challenges? Share your experiences, ask questions, and let's learn from each other! What free tools do you swear by? Let's build a valuable resource list for everyone!

**Conclusion:**

Social media success doesn't require a massive budget. By focusing on your audience, creating valuable content, and consistently engaging with your community, you can crush your competition and achieve your business goals. It's time to take control of your online presence and unlock the power of social media!",1,1752508781.0,GrowMyBusinessNow,0,1.0,False

Replying to an earlier comment of mine re the Passport, someone suggested I post this setup. So here it is!

**So often we need tear-away sheets or somewhere to put quick lists, right?** My answer: **staple a simple pad onto the cover of the first TN notebook**.  This lets me put disposable lists nearby, without using valuable pages of my long-term TN notebook. It's also great if I need to write something and tear if off to give someone.

The whole setup is:

* vinyl zipped pouch and biz card slots on the out layer
* plain TN notebook with pad stapled to cover
   * **Passport**: a cheap **Mead 3x5 pad**. These come in 5-packs for $5 ($1/pad) which seems too cheap. It's workable and does the job perfectly.
   * **Full-size**: I absolutely love the professional quality of the [**Portage Reporter Notebooks**](https://portagenotebooks.com/reporters/). You can find them [HERE](https://portagenotebooks.com/reporters/). I live on these 4"" x 8"" reporter pads, which are great for notes and lists of all kinds. Especially if I'm at a business lunch and need to take notes in a tight space, next to the lunch dishes and coffee, etc.
      * BTW I also buy [Portage's great **steno pads**](https://portagenotebooks.com/steno-notebook-with-ultra-sturdy-backing-gregg-ruled-6-x-9-4-pack/) (6"" x 9"") for daily biz notes, writing, etc.
      * All Portage pads work beautifully with everything from pencils to fountain pends. The **paper quality is excellent**. First-rate.
      * The **backing cardboard is very firm**, so you can use reporter & steno pads in any situation, like standing up etc..
      * I never have fewer than 10–12 of each of these pads in my cabinet.  Absolute must-haves for me.
      * I'm geeking on my paper products here, but I suspect the rest of you share my passion.
* in this setup I only use one TN notebook, but one could add more
* at the back of the Passport, I clipped on a few 3x5 index cards…because I love index cards!

And that's it!  I just set up my full-size TN this morning, so I have yet to use it. But I've been using my Passport set-up since January, and love it. It's a great EDC versatile rig.

We generally get along, but lately, there’s been tension over her borrowing habits, and I need some perspective on whether I overreacted. Now here’s an interesting problem, I own a car, and Sarah doesn’t. I’m happy to help out occasionally, like driving her to the grocery store or giving her a lift to work if her ride falls through. I’ve always made it clear, though, that I need advance notice and that my car isn’t a free for all. It’s not just about gas or wear and tear, it’s my only way to get to my job (I’m a nurse with odd shifts), and I can’t risk it being unavailable or damaged.
About three months ago, Sarah started asking to borrow my car more frequently which sometimes for small things like grabbing takeout or visiting friends. I let her borrow it a couple of times after she promised to be careful, but I noticed she wasn’t great about refilling the gas or cleaning up like leaving coffee cups or muddy footprints. I gently reminded her to respect my car, and she apologized, so I let it slide. Last month, things escalated. Sarah asked to borrow my car for a quick errand as usual but kept it for six hours without texting me. I had to cancel plans because I couldn’t get to them, and when she returned, the gas tank was nearly empty. I was frustrated and told her I wasn’t comfortable lending it out anymore unless it was an emergency. She got defensive, saying I was being petty and that roommates should share resources. I explained that my car isn’t a shared resource and this is my personal property, and I need it for work. She rolled her eyes but seemed to drop it. Last week, Sarah asked to borrow my car again to visit her sister, who lives an hour away. I said no, citing the previous issues and my upcoming 12 hour shift. She got upset, saying her sister was having a rough time and she really needed to see her. I felt bad, so I offered to drive her there myself on my day off, but she said that wasn’t convenient for her schedule. She then accused me of being selfish and said I was holding my car over her head to control her. I stood my ground and said I wasn’t comfortable lending it out after she disregarded my boundaries before.
Since then, Sarah’s been cold, barely speaking to me, and she told a mutual friend I’m being unreasonable and unsupportive. Our friend thinks I should’ve just let her borrow the car since her sister’s situation sounds serious, but I feel like Sarah’s not respecting my needs or my property. I get that she’s stressed, and I don’t want to seem heartless, but I also don’t think I’m obligated to let her use my car, especially after she’s been careless.

1.  High Caffeine: Equivalent to a large cup of coffee may cause jitteriness, insomnia, or increased heart rate, especially for caffeine-sensitive individuals.
2.  Proprietary Blend: The exact amounts of each ingredient in the 3,375mg blend are undisclosed, making it hard to assess potency or safety.
3.  Sodium and Potassium Levels: While low, the combination with caffeine and other stimulants might affect blood pressure in sensitive individuals.
4.  Not Medically Evaluated: Statements are not FDA-approved, so efficacy and safety claims lack official backing.
5.  Potential Side Effects: Contains citric acid and preservatives (potassium sorbate), which may cause digestive discomfort in some people, especially if consumed in large amounts or built up too quickly (as warned).
6.  Consultation Required: The need to consult a physician suggests potential risks for those on medication or with health conditions, limiting accessibility.

1lzpul7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lzpul7/my_job_is_to_make_snow_and_the_strange_things/,"My Job is to Make Snow, and the Strange Things Won’t Stop pt:1","I’ve just finished my third winter making snow. It’s a strange job, so it only makes sense I’ve experienced some strange things while doing it. I’ve decided to catalogue some of the odd experiences I’ve had so far on here.

If you don’t know what snowmaking is, I basically am part of a team that use snowmaking machines or “guns” to make man-made snow for a ski hill so they can extend their winter seasons. I work on this small hill deep in the Canadian Rockies that’s also the oldest still operating hill in the region. There’s a small town about a 10-minute drive away, but sometimes at night that road extends longer for no apparent reason, but I’ll tell that story another time. I moved out here for the winter after failing to get rehired as a lifty at my old ski hill, and desperate to stay in the industry, I decided to apply to this snowmaking position. I figured it’d be a good fit as I don’t mind being wet and cold and I wouldn’t have to deal with customers. I got hired, and training started around the beginning of October. That’s where I first learned of the challenges this job has that few other jobs do.

Training was held in a bay of the mechanics shop. They had set up fold-out plastic chairs and tables that looked like a typical classroom. All two dozen or so of us snowmakers arrived as a group, as we all shared accommodations and had left it as a group. We were preceded by our superiors, who told everyone to take a seat as we walked in. They started training by introducing themselves; they all have real names, but honestly everyone only ever refers to them by their nicknames which are so ubiquitously used that I’ve even heard the ski hill’s owner call them by their nicknames in a professional meeting. They’ve all acquired these names from something that happened at the hill, all stories I might tell at some point. There was the manager, Jonah, the kind of guy who looks like he could be anywhere between the ages of 35 and 55, with greying curly hair and sunken features. He wore a flannel shirt and jeans with a blue Chevrolet ball cap and a pair of safety glasses, which he would never be seen without. He is average in height and slightly overweight with a goatee that doesn’t quite match his face shape. Then there was the foremen. The first to introduce themselves was Foxbody, who was a tall skinny guy in his late 20s with a head of buzzed brown hair, a curly moustache, and a tanned leathery complexion. Carrie was the only female foreman. She was on the shorter side, but you could tell was relatively brawny even with a baggy hoodie on; she had long black silky hair in a ponytail coming out the back of her plain black trucker cap. Next was Sonny. He had a stocky frame and was about 6 feet tall with unkempt long blonde hair mostly hidden by the hood from his worn-out brown Carhartt hoodie. Finally was Gremlin, a smaller Australian guy, only a little taller than Carrie but far less brawny and with wiry red hair and a long moustache in the same red on his head that almost fully covered his mouth; his neck and arms were covered in tattoos of snakes and roses.

After introductions, Jonah explained our responsibilities. It was a long, boring lecture that I’ve sat through three times now, and all the returners usually fall asleep listening to it. The gist of it was that we would work 2pm-2am or 2am-2pm because we needed to run the snowmaking guns 24/7, and night is the best time to make because that’s when the temperature is coldest. The snowguns work by firing high-pressure water and high-pressure air at the same time to break apart water droplets coming out of their nozzle so they turn to snowflakes as fast as possible. We would need to go out and adjust the air and water ratios depending on the wet bulb temperature; the different settings to do this are called banks. In general our goal was keep the guns running as effectively as possible in turn making as much snow as possible.

My back was aching by the end of the lesson from sitting in those uncomfortable chairs for so long, but unfortunately we weren’t done yet because all the foremen started handing papers to everyone. 

“This here is a list of safety precautions that are specific to this department that they didn’t outline in your online onboarding course. We’ll go over it now, and if anyone has questions about it, I’ll answer those at the end.” Jonah said. After he read out the list, there was a litany of questions, most of which were answered by the foremen and Jonah with phrases like “that’s not important for your position” or “we are not certain of the answer to that ourselves, but if we figure it out, we’ll get back to you.” Around 10 people quit and left the job because of this list, which Sonny later told me drunkenly at the bar wasn’t unusual and happens every year. Heck, some days I wonder why I didn’t join them. I’ve decided to directly put this list on here; hopefully this won’t get me in trouble, but we are working on updating this list for this upcoming season, so I should be in the clear, as it isn’t technically company documents anymore. I also put extra context in parentheses, as there is a lot of industry jargon in this list. Here’s the list, almost exactly as given to me.

Safety Precautions and Tips for Snowmakers

1. Ensure you dress properly for the weather, as we work in extreme weather conditions.
2. We work on snow and ice, so be cautious of slips, trips, and falls.
3. Be cautious when driving snowmobiles and follow all rules in the upcoming snowmobile operators course.
4. Do not approach or feed any animals you see. Instead, report it to dispatch if the animal is bigger than a porcupine.
5. Do not go onto any runs with a winch cat operating on the run (a winch cat is an industrial snowplow with a large winch on it so they can operate on steep ski runs while minimizing the risk of flipping over) the cable has enough force to seriously injure or even kill you.
6. If foreign substances, i.e., rust, mud, sticks, rocks, or animal parts come out of an air or water hydrant, allow it to flush out before connecting a hose. If you fail to do so the substance could clog the filters on the guns or burst the hose open. (Guns are connected via hoses to hydrants, which themselves are connected to a hill-wide water and air pump system.)
7. If you hear animal noises that don’t sound quite right, especially at night, just ignore them and do not report them to dispatch, as the noises themselves pose no threat. 
8. If you go on a run where there are no currently operating snow guns, report it to dispatch before proceeding.
9. If dispatch asks you what run you are on, do not respond; that is not actually dispatch, and they already know where you are anyways.
10. If a snowboarder wearing all pink is riding on an unopened run, do not stop them; simply let them proceed.
11. If you are in a hut for a break (we take breaks in whatever building is nearest to the run we are working on, usually a ski lift hut), do not leave open food containers in there when you leave the hut, as mice or something else could take it.
12. Watch for cracks in whales (piles of snow made by our snowguns), as they could split and you’ll fall in. Be careful; no matter the size of the whale. The crevasses can go deeper than seems logical.
13. If you return to where you left your snowmobile and it has disappeared, follow its tracks; they usually don’t take them farther than a few hundred feet. Remember to radio dispatch if you need to travel onto a run without any snowguns to retrieve it.
14. If you see a headlamp in the darkness that does not belong to you or your partner, nod twice with your headlamp turned on. If it does not nod twice back, report it to dispatch and calmly head back to whatever building you are using to take your break in.
15. Only report eyes in the treeline to dispatch if there are greater than 10 pairs looking at you.
16. Leave hoses to freeze after shutting off a gun (I later learned this is not industry standard; then again, not much of this is).
17. Before moving a frozen hose, inspect it for any sections unfrozen or with melting snow on top of it. If you find a section that meets these qualities, squeeze it to feel for something that will have a feeling similar to squeezing raw chicken. Should you find a hose like this, bring it to the dumpster at the base straight away and get a new hose from dispatch.
18. If you are on a run where snowcats are not scheduled to be and you see a snowcat driving along your run, stop what you are doing and hastily make your way into the treeline. Try to hide yourself and put your head down because you don’t want to see what’s in the snowcat. If you are in the alpine and above where the trees grow and there is nowhere else to hide, just go into the fetal position and put your face into the ground.
19. If the same person comes up to you from the same direction more than once to ask you the same question, don’t question them and reply as you did the first time no matter how many times this happens.
20. Take note of how you left each gun; if something has changed on it since the last time you were at it, calmly leave the area and go to dispatch, where they will have you call your foreman on the phone.
21. If you notice anything or anyone else odd or unexplainable that poses or posed an immediate threat to you or your partner, radio your foreman with the code 10-66. If it did not pose a threat to you or your partner, report it to your foreman at the end-of-shift meeting.

Reading that back, I don’t know why I didn’t decide to quit right then and there. I guess I’d figured other people had done this for several years and I was no stranger to dangerous jobs; I had spent the last summer working on a cattle farm and had a few close calls with both animals and machinery. Either way too, snowmaking is by default a very dangerous job. We were told earlier during the training session that in the last 20 years only one snowmaking crew in the region has gone without needing to make an insurance claim for a worker's injury. Despite this I still remember to this day the first time I felt the kind of danger unique to this job.

It was a clear night, and the moon was full, which was nice for us because it meant my surroundings weren’t a murky blackness outside the light of my headlamp but instead a vague image of the trees and mountains that surrounded me. My partner for the shift was a tall German guy named Deitrich; he was taking a gap year fresh out of school to do this as a working vacation. He was naive to the world but always excited to participate in it. We were both equipped with our high-vis winter coats, helmets, headlamps, and shovels. As it was the early season, the ski runs were nothing more than grassy clearings with disappointing piles of snow dotted along their paths. As we showed up to what was probably the 15th gun on this run that was placed on a flat spot at the base of a steep section which towered like a wall over us. We were around midway up the mountain, so pine trees towered over us on either side of the run. In the distance we were able to make out part of the valley and the mountains on the other side. We were off to the side of the mountain, therefore we couldn’t see the light of the base area nor that of the town. Occasionally if we were far enough away from the deafening hum of the snow guns, we could hear the rumble of the trains that frequently roll through the valley; sound really carries out here. Dietrich walked over to where the snow from the snowgun was falling in order to check the quality of the snow. I went to the gun to check for any ice buildup and be ready for if we needed to change banks. After using my shovel to knock ice off the frame of the gun, I looked down the slope to check on Dietrich, and he nodded his head twice. Even though it was a relatively bright night, it’s still difficult to make out a person’s body with their bright headlamp facing you. Head movement is the only way we can communicate when we were either too far or it was too loud to hear each other. I assumed his nodding meant the snow quality was good, so I started to walk over to him. When I had closed about half the distance, he nodded again, but it didn’t seem to be at me. I looked over my shoulder at what his light was facing, and that’s when I saw a headlamp up on the ridge that towered above us. 

It was maybe 100 feet from us. I turned back and hustled over to Dietrich. When I got to him I asked, “Hey, were you nodding at that light up there?”
Dietrich responded, “Yeah, they’ve not nodded back. That’s not good, right? What do we do?”
“Oh shit, we need to get out of here and get back to the lift hut.”
I barely got done exclaiming that sentence when we both dropped our shovels and turned to bolt down the hill. The hut was where we were taking our breaks, as well as it was the nearest building. It was a blur the whole way down except for when I briefly turned around and the light was chasing after us and had seemed to have gained 25 feet on us. I remember the light was about 8 feet off the ground, but because of the same issue with us not being able to see each other through the beams of our headlamps, I could not make out the figure the mysterious light belonged to. We kept running at full speed; I was in tunnel vision the whole time. My legs started to get tired, but the adrenaline wouldn’t let me slow down because I knew if I did I would not be able to push my legs back up to the same speed. I was sweating like a dog under all my gear, but that was the last thing I cared about at that point. Dietrich had beat me to the hut; his tall stature and lean frame made him a lot faster than me. He just about took out the door when he slammed into it trying to get it open. He held the door open for me, and I nearly wiped out trying to stop my momentum on the concrete floor inside the building.

Dietrich slammed and locked the door as I slid a chair over to him that he jammed the door with. I threw myself down onto the floor in the corner of the hut between the wall and the metal cabinet of fuses, gauges, and other controls for the ski lift. Dietrich did the same on the other side of the cabinet. My eyes darted around the room for something I could use to defend myself with. The only thing I could come up with was the thermos of coffee in my backpack; I felt so vulnerable. Now I was wishing we hadn’t dropped our shovels when we took off running. The lift operator's tools were just as out of reach, sitting outside against the wall where I could see the light was just arriving at the shack. It wasn’t bobbing up and down the way a headlamp does when someone is walking, it moved smoothly like it was floating. The light paused for a minute and seemed to get brighter, going from about as bright as a flashlight to a brightness that rivalled the sun. I had to look away as it lit up the shack like it was noon. I held my hand up to shield the source of the light from my eyes, I should’ve looked away but something urged me to want to try and look at it. I had to move my hand as the light moved. It moved to the door and I wanted to look at it directly so I could tell if it was about to attack. I knew however if I did move my hand away it was so bright I would be blinded. The attack I was expecting never came; it just began to circle the shack. It started moving at a running pace and thankfully I closed my eyes before it moved from behind my hand and I saw it directly. Through the powerful light being able to partially shine through my closed eyelids I could tell it about half a dozen laps around the building without making a sound. Afterwards it had stopped behind the hut, which was the only side with no windows. That’s when the light suddenly went out like someone flipped a switch and turned it off. I leaned around the corner of the control box to look at Dietrich. “You think it’s gone now?” I whispered.
“I think so. Should we radio Sonny?” Dietrich replied, his voice shaky. I nodded to him and pulled my radio out of the holster on my chest. “Colt to Sonny”. I said into the radio. 
“Go ahead.”
“We just had a 10-66.” I was trying and failing to sound calm about it because everyone working on the mountain used the same radio channel and I wanted to seem tough.
“10-4, what’s your 20?” His tone had changed from his usual casual speech to a tone that told me that even he had become concerned.
“Bottom of Spruce Chair”
“10-4, I’m on my way; you two hang in there.”
Sonny approached the hut on the side-by-side with caution, scanning the area and wielding a shovel. We moved the chair and unlocked the door to let him in. Once he was inside, he took off his helmet and said, “So, you guys okay? What happened?” 
I told him we weren’t hurt but we were pretty shaken. I told him how Dietrich saw it first and when it didn’t nod back we bolted for the hut and hid in it. “Ok, luckily you guys were quick and not too far from the building. If you see it again, though, treat it like a grizzly and don’t run. Next time walk back calmly, as hard as that sounds.”
“How often do people see that thing?” Dietrich asked with concern in his voice. “Usually once or twice a season, but it hasn’t harmed anyone since my first season 4 years ago. A couple of snowmakers were making a run with a long setup where the gun was out of sight from the hydrant. They started the gun up, and the guy down at the gun walked into the trees quickly to take a leak and he shut off his light. The guy up at the hydrant walked over the ridge and saw the same mysterious light you guys saw tonight. He assumed it was his partner and walked right up to it. The poor dude was put into a coma, and had to be airlifted out of there. He didn’t wake up for a couple weeks, and when he did, he was blinded. Last I heard, he still is sadly. So you guys got lucky it didn’t catch up before you got in here.” Sonny was pretty uncharacteristically serious in his tone telling the story, which I wouldn’t hear again for a while.
“Oh shit, that’s awful.” I responded. It was probably a lacklustre response, but so much was bouncing through my head that it was all I could muster to say. Dietrich stayed silent, which was probably the better thing to do in that moment. “You guys rest in here for a bit; I’ll go check on your guns for you. At the end of the shift you guys will have to fill out a strange occurrence form. Good work out there; you both have killed it this season so far.” Sonny said, his usual light hearted tone had returned.

That was the first of a few strange things I’ve witnessed during my time here. I’ve got to get back to work now, though. We’ve got a safety meeting this afternoon where it’ll be just foremen, Jonah, and our safety rep attending, so it’s probably going to be about these strange occurrences like that one. Maybe I’ll be reminded of a story I can write about and put onto here.",2,1752507829.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1lzpues,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/1lzpues/gluten_free_in_cbus_reviews/,Gluten Free in CBus - Reviews,"Just got back from a weekend in Columbus and I’m still reeling from the sheer number of gluten-free options. I didn’t hit every spot (I’m only one woman), but here’s the rundown: rated on a scale of 1 to 5 ⭐️’s, with a heavy dose of personal bias and dramatic flair.

Agave & Rye: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
First stop post-flight, looking for something casual near North Market and WOW. Chips? Crisp perfection. Elote? Freshly carved right off the cob like some beautiful street corn ceremony. And let’s talk taco flights. If you’re not intrigued by tacos served flight style, we can’t be friends. I tried the Plain Jane, Swipe Right, and Filthy Fajita. The Filthy Fajita lives rent-free in my dreams.

Macaron Bar: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Not your average macaron joint. We’re talking Earl Grey, Lavender Lemon, and more. I blacked out from joy halfway through. Delicate, flavorful, and impossible to choose just one. (So don’t.)

Lindey’s: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
A classy spot with solid GF offerings. I had the halibut special with a crab béarnaise that I would gladly pour over every protein I eat until the end of time. They had a light app menu, but I have a hard time knocking them because the experience was simply delightful for me and my fancy little palate.
 
Daddio’s Biscuits: ⭐️⭐️(+ .5)
A fully GF biscuit shop? Sign me up. The cinnamon biscuit was stupid good. Like, sit-in-your-car-and-contemplate-life good. Unfortunately, the breakfast sammies were a bit less than okay. Frozen egg and grocery store cheese totally dragged down what could’ve been a biscuit love story.

Little West Tavern (Junto Hotel): ⭐️
Cute vibe, not-so-cute GF selection. No GF buns (not that I love them anyway, but still). Ended up with a bunless burger and Caesar salad. They were super careful with cross-contamination, so they get a point for effort - but I’m still annoyed about the lack of options. One star and a grumble.

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Fried calamari and onion rings?! I almost wept. It’s been years since I could eat either. Bone-in filet. (I die.) The peanut butter pie? An out-of-body experience. Took it back to the hotel thinking I’d save it for breakfast. Spoiler alert: I ate it that night watching the Hope Solo doc. Zero regrets.

Cherbourg Bakery: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Yes, I said 1-5 stars. No, I don’t care. This place breaks the scale. A dedicated GF bakery slinging quiche, strata, cinnamon rolls, apple pie bars - and coffee brewed by angels. I’m not religious, but this place is holy. It’s a little outside downtown, but worth the Uber, Lyft, or hell, a rented donkey if that’s all you can find.

The Pearl: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
As a girl raised on seacoast New Hampshire seafood, I was skeptical about fish & chips in landlocked Ohio. But this perch-based Great Lakes version? Chef’s kiss. Light rice flour batter, crispy steak fries, and nothing greasy or heavy. I just wish they had liiiiittle bit more variety - but I’d go back in a heartbeat.

Bake Me Happy: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
This place is all nostalgia and flavor. A GF bakery with throwback treats galore. I rolled in late, so the case was a little sparse, but the butterscotch blondie? DIVINE. And yes - they ask if you want a middle, edge, or corner piece. (Middle or bust.) The dark chocolate brownie was so rich I needed a moment. Also, get the coconut chai tea. Trust.

Cento: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
I had the best GF pasta of my life here. Fettuccine & clams with a sauce so light and perfect I wanted to write it a thank-you note. The GF garlic bread was so convincing I questioned reality. Also: sitting across from the massive parm wheel and prosciutto slicer had me considering a casual serve yourself moment. Social norms? Never heard of her.

Needless to say, Columbus came through for my gluten-free self. Still salty I couldn’t try everything - but hey, now I have an excuse to go back. 🥂",1,1752507819.0,Columbus,6,0.56,False

I initially attributed this to not having seasoned my burrs yet, but then I noticed that this happens whenever I move the grinder on my countertop (to clean under it) or when I tap the funnel after grinding.

Buckle up, because this is peak *me* being a disaster gay.  


I’ve been crushing on this guy, let’s call him *Ethan*, for MONTHS. We met at a mutual friend’s game night, and ever since, I’ve been a nervous wreck around him. Flirting? Couldn’t do it. Eye contact? Barely. Smooth conversation? Forget it.  

The problem? **I wasn’t even sure if he was gay.** He’s one of those effortlessly hot guys who gives off *vibes* but could also just be a really stylish ally.  

Last weekend, our friend group went out for drinks. I was *slightly* tipsy (okay, maybe more than slightly) and decided—*genius idea*—to ""subtly"" test the waters.  

Me, slurring: *""So, Ethan… do you, like, *like* like anyone right now?""* (Yes, I actually said ""like like"" like a middle schooler.)  

Ethan, smirking: *""Maybe. Why?""*  

My brain short-circuited. Instead of playing it cool, I blurted: *""Because I *like like* you, and I don’t know if you’re into guys, and I’ve been stressing about this for weeks!""*  

**Silence.**  

Then, he starts *laughing*. Not in a mean way, but like… relieved?  

Ethan: *""Dude, I’ve been dropping hints for months. You never picked up on any of them?""*  
 
Turns out:  
- The ""random"" gym selfies he sent in the group chat? **For me.**  
- Him ""coincidentally"" showing up at my favorite coffee shop? **On purpose.**  
- That one time he ""joked"" about us being boyfriends? **NOT A JOKE.** 

I was *oblivious*.  

The Happy Ending:
We’ve been texting nonstop since then, and we have our first *official* date this weekend. Moral of the story? Sometimes being a disaster pays off.  

Got drunk, confessed my crush in the cringiest way possible, only to find out he’d been flirting with me the whole time.

1lzprn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1lzprn8/new_to_carnivore_diet_but_not_the_scene/,"New to Carnivore diet, but not the scene","Hey everyone! 

I tried animal based in the past and had good success, but some personal things happened and I stopped caring for a long time. Jumping back on the lifestyle change now. 

I know its a bit of a privilege, but I work at a specialty food/butcher like shop that sources regenerative and pasture raised meats and organs, so I'm working on making meat organ blends to cook with. 

I kind of have tossed between keto carnivore and animal based (saladino), but to be honest, I have ADHD, an anxiety disorder and a long history of binge eating, especially fried foods and ice cream, and it doesn't help that these hit the dopamine hard for my brain. Also I am obese, I've already seen improvements with gut/gastrointestinal stuff and was seeing some improvements in skin redness/inflammation.


Based on what I've read, it might just be best for me to cut the carbs almost completely. As much as I don't want to give up some things (right now, it is ice cream. I switched to ice cream for bears as a compromise with my taste buds, but moderation is not a strong word in my vocabulary.)  But attempting to get into ketosis seems to be helping me with that moderation aspect because there isn't much room for cheat foods, if at all by the end of the day.

I don't know if anyone else here as experience with managing their ADHD utilizing nutrition or this diet in general, but if you have any anecdotes, it would be appreciated. I am on medication right now, but I think I recall seeing improvements in my symptoms when i did Saladino style two years ago. 

Also, kind of confused about the protein vs fat macros. I know less than 20 carbs a day, zero if possible. But what about protein? I know too much can convert to glucose, but I want to support lean muscle. Also I am counting calories, because again, I have a history of binge eating, I don't need advice on that.

I am basically doing mostly beef, beef heart, some beef liver, eggs, some chicken thigh if I need a protein boost, raw cheeses and then vat pasturized heavy cream, as I still drink coffee 🤷. Also using MCT oil in my coffee as well. 

I made a blend, but it's too lean so I've been cooking burgers and ground meat in tallow, which fixes the issue. I'll switch to higher fat meat blend next time. 

But anyway, yeah. 

TLDR, protein to fat ratios on ketovore and anyone have anecdotes on Ketovore or carnivore helping them with ADHD and or anxiety disorders? Thanks! ",4,1752507649.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False

I imagined my graduation marking a bright new chapter—achievement, celebration, love. But instead of standing beside me, Caleb, the man I trusted most, spent the day in the arms of someone he once called ""just a friend.""

Shattered, I wandered into a bar, desperate for escape. I never expected that night to end in darkness—my drink tampered with, my body violated, my voice ignored. And with that horror, I lost a life I hadn’t yet told him about: our unborn child.

The hospital walls couldn’t contain the truth. A live stream revealed it all—Caleb’s betrayal, Bianca’s smug smile, their mockery of my pain. The life I thought I had with him? It was a lie.

He used to say I’d fall apart without him.

But this time, I’m walking away—not broken, but rebuilding. And I won’t be looking back.

\--

The hospital ceiling above me was blank—white, cold, unforgiving. I lay there, aching from the inside out, a thousand invisible cracks spider-webbed through every part of me. My physical wounds were painful, yes—but they were nothing compared to the weight pressing down on my chest, the kind that made it hard to even breathe.

For a while, I stared at the empty chair beside me, waiting—naively—for Caleb to walk through that door. I imagined his arms wrapping around me, his voice trembling as he asked if I was okay. But he never came. He wasn’t coming.

I tried to call him. The line rang, over and over, but he didn’t pick up. A piece of me still hoped he didn’t know what had happened, that maybe—just maybe—he’d come running once he did. But when I opened my secret Instagram account and saw the live video, any sliver of hope I had left turned to ash.

There he was. My boyfriend of over a year. Holding Bianca like she was his prize. She smiled with smug satisfaction, draped across him as if she’d won.

And maybe she had.

“Hey, Caleb,” someone behind the camera laughed. “What would your girl think if she saw this?”

“She’d believe whatever I told her,” he replied with a lazy smirk. “She always does.”

I felt the betrayal physically. My stomach twisted, and my vision blurred as the phone slipped from my hand.

Just last night, I was fighting for my life. I had gone to a bar alone—broken and humiliated because Caleb ditched my graduation celebration. I drank to forget, unaware someone had spiked my drink. By the time I realized, it was too late. The men dragged me away like I was nothing more than a forgotten possession.

My body had failed me. I had screamed in my mind, but no words would come. I managed to call Caleb, desperate for help.

""Help me,"" I had whispered.

He didn’t believe me. He didn’t even hesitate.

""Stop pretending,” he said. “You’re just upset I wasn’t there.”

Then came Bianca’s voice—seductive, cruel. “Should I take off the lingerie now?” she teased.

And that was it. The call ended. I was left alone, surrounded by monsters, deprived of power and dignity.

But the worst part wasn’t even the physical violation. It was what I lost that night—something no one knew about yet. I had been carrying a secret inside me, a new life. I was going to tell Caleb after graduation. I had imagined him smiling, holding me, whispering promises for our future. But that moment never came.

Instead, I lost the baby I had barely begun to love.

I lay in a cold, unfamiliar field afterward, blood-soaked and broken, and thought I might die. Maybe I wanted to.

But I didn’t. I woke up. I survived.

And as I stared at that empty chair in the hospital, I realized something: I couldn’t keep waiting for someone who had already chosen to leave.

So I picked up the phone again. This time, with purpose.

“Mom,” I said.

“Rhea? Sweetheart, are you okay?”

“I’m going to take the job in Sydney. Please help me get out of here.”

It was the beginning of the end—and the start of something new.

I wasn’t going to waste another minute on Caleb or the dream I used to cling to. I would rebuild myself, piece by piece, no matter how long it took.

Because he had abandoned me at my lowest.

But I?

I would rise.

Chapter 2

My hands wouldn’t stop shaking, even as I curled tighter beneath the hospital blanket. Every time I closed my eyes, the memories stormed back like a flood I couldn’t contain—the cruel chuckles, the rough hands, the helplessness pressing down on me until I could barely breathe. I gripped the edge of the sheet, forcing air into my lungs, trying to steady myself. I kept whispering in my head, You’re okay. You’re safe now. But it didn’t feel true.

I was surviving, but I wasn’t really living. I was still alone in this fight.

At some point, exhaustion must have pulled me under. When I opened my eyes again, it wasn’t because of a nightmare—it was because someone was touching me.

Fear shot through my veins like ice. My muscles tensed, and before I could think, I shoved the hand away with every ounce of strength I had.

“Whoa! Rhea, it’s me—it’s just me,” a voice said quickly.

My vision adjusted to the low light, and I saw him standing there—Caleb. His expression was one of confusion and mild concern, as if I’d simply woken up from a bad dream.

“Babe, are you okay? You looked terrified.”

His voice. That voice I used to run to for comfort now made my skin crawl. After everything I had been through—after the night I begged him to help me, sobbing through the phone—and he dismissed me as if I were acting dramatic… How dare he show up now, pretending like nothing had happened?

“What are you doing here?” I asked, my voice cold and raw, laced with disbelief.

He gave me a casual smile and held up a plastic bag. “I just got back. Thought I’d surprise you. Got a few things for you—souvenirs and stuff.”

I turned my back on him without a word, bile rising in my throat. His presence alone felt like poison.

His tone changed, sharp and defensive. “What the heck is your problem? Are you seriously still mad I missed your graduation? You’re being ridiculous.”

I clenched the blanket so hard my knuckles turned white.

“This is about Bianca again, isn’t it?” he added with a huff, already rolling his eyes.

I said nothing, trying to hold myself together.

He winced and ran a hand through his hair. “Rhea, for God’s sake. She’s a client. A business contact. Why are you always so insecure?”

That was it.

I turned to him slowly, my voice trembling with fury. “You think this is about jealousy? About graduation?”

He opened his mouth, but I didn’t let him speak.

“They tied me up, Caleb. They beat me until I couldn’t scream anymore. They laughed while I cried and begged. And where were you?” My voice cracked. “I called you. I begged you.”

His expression flickered, maybe with guilt—maybe just annoyance. I couldn’t tell.

Before he could say anything, his phone buzzed.

He answered immediately. “Bianca?” he said, his voice softening, filled with concern.

Of course.

He listened for a moment, then nodded. “Yeah, I’ll come now. Don’t worry. I’m on my way.”

He ended the call and turned to me with urgency.

“Bianca’s in the hospital,” he said. “She needs me.”

I stared at him, stunned. “And I don’t?” I whispered, barely audible.

“She’s not well,” he said flatly. “You’re strong. You’ll be fine.”

I laughed bitterly, though it came out as a broken sound. “I was attacked. I’m bleeding on the inside, Caleb.”

“She’s like a sister,” he said, exasperated. “Why do you always twist everything? You say you love me—so act like it. Understand that sometimes other people need me too.”

That was the moment something inside me snapped.

“No,” I said, stepping away from him. “Loving you means breaking myself into pieces to make you whole. I’m done.”

I didn’t wait for his reply. I grabbed my phone, my hands still trembling, and stormed out. My feet carried me to the nearest bathroom. I slammed the door shut and collapsed onto the floor, pressing a towel to my face to muffle the sobs that burst from my chest. Tears streamed down my face, hot and endless, soaking the towel as I cried like something inside me had died.

Because maybe it had.

There were no words left to say to Caleb. No strength left to argue, to explain, to beg him to care.

Then my phone buzzed again.

It was my mom.

“Rhea?” she said gently, “I’ve made all the arrangements. Everything’s set. You’re going to Sydney, just like we talked about.”

I wiped at my tears, trying to breathe. “I don’t know if I can go through with it…”

Her voice was soothing but firm. “You have to, honey. You need a fresh start. And you won’t be alone. Jasper will be waiting for you. He’s going to help you settle in.”

“Jasper?” I asked, frowning slightly. The name tugged at a distant part of my memory.

“Your childhood friend. You used to build sandcastles together every summer, remember? He offered to help when I told him what happened. He’s a good man, Rhea. And he’ll look out for you.”

I hesitated. Leaving meant closing a chapter I wasn’t ready to let go of. Not entirely.

“Honey,” she added softly, “the authorities are investigating. We’re going to catch the men who did this to you. You’re not alone in this anymore. They’ll face justice. I promise you.”

Her words cracked something inside me—not from pain this time, but from resolve. I wasn’t just leaving to run away. I was choosing to survive. And more than that—I was choosing to heal.

“Thanks, Mom,” I whispered. “Really.”

As I ended the call, my gaze drifted to the window. Beyond it was the city where I had lost so much—my innocence, my trust, my future with Caleb. But now, I had the chance to start over. A chance to rebuild.

And somewhere deep in my soul, anger began to harden into something stronger—determination.

Caleb hadn’t just ignored me. He had minimized my pain, invalidated my trauma, and walked away when I needed him most. He had made me feel like nothing.

But I wasn’t nothing.

I wasn’t powerless.

I stood up, wiped the last of my tears, and walked out with a newfound clarity. My suitcase waited quietly in the corner. I began packing—deliberately, forcefully. Clothes, documents, pieces of a past I was finally ready to leave behind.

I was leaving in three days.

And when I left, I wouldn’t look back.

Not at Caleb.

Not at the pain.

Not at the shattered girl who once waited for a man who would never choose her.

This time, I was choosing me.

Chapter 3

My fingers trembled slightly as I closed the final zipper on my luggage. The police had contacted me earlier in the morning—they had apprehended one of the men involved in my assault. The moment I heard the news, a knot formed in my stomach. The thought of facing it all over again—of confronting that night—made my skin crawl. But deep down, I knew I couldn’t run from it. Not anymore. I had to face the past, even if it meant reliving my worst nightmare. I couldn’t let fear define me any longer.

I was just about to walk out the front door when it flew open with a thud. Caleb stormed into the room, his expression stormy and volatile.

“Where are you going?” He barked, eyes narrowing on me.

I adjusted my bag on my shoulder, refusing to meet his gaze. I didn’t owe him an explanation—not after everything he’d done.

“Oh, I get it,” he sneered. “You’re off to meet your boyfriend, right? You’ve been sneaking around, haven’t you?”

His words made me stop in my tracks. I turned toward him, my brows furrowed. “What are you talking about, Caleb?”

With a twisted smirk, he reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a thick set of photographs. He tossed them dramatically onto the floor between us, the glossy images fanning out in every direction.

I looked down—and froze.

There I was, sprawled on a bed, unclothed and unconscious. The photos were taken from angles that made my stomach lurch with disgust and horror. My breath caught in my throat as the realization hit me: they were from that night. The night I had been drugged and violated.

“Where did you get these?” I demanded, my voice trembling as my eyes remained locked on the images.

Caleb’s voice turned cruel. “Does it really matter? The truth is right in front of me—you betrayed me.”

I took a step back, the sheer weight of his accusation making my chest tighten. “Betrayed you?” I asked. “I didn’t betray anyone! I was assaulted, Caleb! I was drugged, deprived of my dignity, and tortured—don’t you get it?”

He shook his head stubbornly, his eyes cold and unyielding. “Save the lies. Bianca told me everything.”

I gave a bitter, disbelieving laugh. “Of course she did. Because whatever Bianca says must be gospel to you.”

“She’s not a liar,” he snapped. “She was devastated when she found out. She only told me because she thought I had a right to know the truth.”

The air around me felt suffocating. I was exhausted—mentally, emotionally, physically—from constantly defending myself, from being weighed down by his blind loyalty to the one woman who had manipulated everything.

“You know what, Caleb?” I said quietly but firmly, locking eyes with him. “I’m done justifying myself to someone who refuses to hear me.”

I turned to leave, my fingers tightening around the handle of my bag. But before I could take another step, Caleb’s hand shot out and grabbed my arm, his grip bruising.

“You’re not walking away from me,” he growled.

“Let go of me!” I cried out, yanking my arm, but his hold only tightened.

The next thing I knew, pain exploded across my cheek. His hand had struck me—hard. I stumbled backward, stunned. My face throbbed, my vision swimming with disbelief. He had hit me.

For a moment, the room was dead silent.

Then I slowly raised my head, my entire body trembling—not from fear this time, but from rage.

“I can’t believe you just did that,” I whispered, voice raw.

He stood there, chest heaving, eyes wild.

“This is it, Caleb,” I said, my voice rising with fury. “You want to believe Bianca? Fine. You want to think I’m the villain? Be my guest. But I’m done being your punching bag—literally and figuratively.”

Without thinking, I lifted my hand and slapped him across the face. The sharp crack echoed through the house.

“I’m leaving,” I declared, fire burning in my chest. “And there’s nothing you can do to stop me.”

As if summoned by our chaos, the door creaked open again. Bianca stepped in, looking every bit the part of a concerned, delicate flower.

“What’s happening?” she asked, voice laced with false innocence. “Is this about me?”

I glared at her, my patience obliterated.

“I didn’t mean to cause any trouble,” she continued softly, her voice trembling like she was about to cry. “I just couldn’t keep it in anymore. When I saw those pictures… I was broken. You’re like a brother to me, Caleb. I just wanted to protect you.”

I could barely contain the fury rising in me. My fists clenched at my sides, my nails digging into my palms.

“You liar,” I spat, stepping toward her. “You’ve been the one tearing us apart. You’ve been the one crawling into his bed behind my back.”

Her eyes widened, a flicker of real fear flashing through her carefully constructed facade.

“Don’t act like the victim now, Bianca,” I continued, my voice shaking with emotion. “You manipulated him. You fed him lies while playing the perfect little innocent. But I see through you now. And I’m done pretending.”

Chapter 4

Bianca burst into loud, dramatic sobs the moment my hand connected with her cheek. She clutched her face like I had committed some horrific crime, her cries echoing through the room.

Caleb immediately pushed past me and stepped protectively in front of her, glaring at me with fire in his eyes. Without warning, he shoved me backward, hard enough to make me stumble.

“What on earth is wrong with you?” he shouted. “She just got discharged from the hospital, and you think hitting her is okay?”

I steadied myself, rage burning in my veins as I stood tall again. “Of course,” I said bitterly, staring him down. “Of course you’re defending her—like always. That’s all you’ve ever done. You know what, Caleb? I’m done playing this game. If she’s what you want, go be with her. I’m finished with you. We're done.”

“No,” he said instantly, his voice shaking with disbelief. “You don’t get to leave me. You’re not walking away from this.”

I let out a laugh—sharp and humorless. “No, Caleb. You’re the one who can’t survive without me. And soon, you’ll understand exactly what that means.”

I turned toward the door, lifting my bag onto my shoulder, ready to leave it all behind.

But before I could step out, I heard his voice behind me—calm, casual, like this was just another day. “Relax, Bianca. She’ll come crawling back like she always does. She’s just throwing another tantrum.”

That cut deeper than anything he’d ever done.

For a second, I stood there in silence, the weight of his words pressing down on me like stones. I remembered all the times I’d gotten angry at him—hurt by his indifference, his gaslighting—only to end up apologizing, even when he was the one in the wrong. I always forgave him. Always found a way to excuse his behavior. Always hoped he’d change.

Once, I genuinely believed he loved me.

He used to do the little things—hold my hand when we crossed the street, text me good luck before every exam, show up with coffee when I’d pulled an all-nighter. There were moments that felt so perfect, like the surprise picnic he planned for my birthday or how he stayed up all night helping me cram for finals. Those were the memories I clung to when everything else started to fall apart.

But as time passed, things began to shift. He stopped listening when I spoke. When I cried, he called me dramatic. When I tried to explain why I was upset, he’d say, “You’re just too sensitive.” And somehow, I always ended up feeling guilty.

The love I thought we had became one-sided. He only cared when it was convenient—when he needed comfort, praise, or someone to stand beside him in public. When I needed support, he was always busy or indifferent.

I couldn’t pinpoint when it happened, but I stopped recognizing the version of myself that stayed with him.

Maybe it was fear. Maybe it was the hope that he’d go back to being the boy I fell for. Maybe I thought I didn’t deserve anything better.

But not anymore.

This time, I was leaving for good. No more explanations. No more apologies for loving too much. I was done.

Without glancing back, I walked out the door. A black luxury car was parked at the curb. My mother’s driver stood waiting and opened the door the moment he saw me. I got in wordlessly, my grip tightening around the handle of my suitcase as the car pulled away.

Every second, the distance between me and Caleb widened—not just physically, but emotionally too. And with each passing block, I felt a small part of myself begin to return.

When I arrived at the police station, two officers were already waiting for me. One of them offered a reassuring nod and led me to the interrogation room.

“We have him,” the officer said. “He confessed to being involved.”

My chest tightened. I stepped inside, my hands clammy as I faced the man who had haunted my nights.

He sat in a chair, chained at the wrist, wearing a smirk that faded the moment he saw me. I sat across from him, my heart pounding.

“Why did you do it?” I asked, my voice cold and controlled.

He leaned back and shrugged. “Wasn’t personal. I was paid.”

My breath caught. “Paid?” I echoed.

He nodded, nonchalant. “Yeah. Bianca Kingsley. She was the one who hired us. Said you needed to be taught a lesson. Said we should make sure you didn’t have anything left to hold onto—especially not the baby.”

I froze. The air left my lungs.

“Bianca?” I asked in disbelief, my voice barely audible.

He nodded again. “She wanted you gone. Claimed you were ruining her plans with your boyfriend. Told us to make you suffer, but not kill you—just break you enough that you wouldn’t come back.”

I sat there in stunned silence, every word he spoke driving a dagger deeper into my chest.

Bianca had been the one to orchestrate everything. Not just the manipulation, not just the betrayal—but the violence, the trauma. My body, my baby, my peace… all stolen because of her.

I stood up slowly, my fists clenched tightly.

“Make sure Caleb Grayson hears every word of this,” I said to the officers. “Send him the full report. I want him to see the truth he refused to believe.”

They nodded, assuring me they would deliver the information.

As I stepped outside into the night, the air hit my face like a wave of reality. The cold didn’t sting. I welcomed it.

Later that evening, I stood at the airport, watching the blinking lights of the departure board. My flight to Sydney was boarding soon. A strange calm settled over me.

Then my phone rang.

Caleb.

His name flashed on the screen, but I felt nothing—not anger, not sadness. Just finality.

I answered.

“Where are you?” he demanded, breathless and panicked. “Rhea, please. Let’s talk.”

I held the phone to my ear, my expression unmoving. “I’m going somewhere you’ll never find me,” I said quietly. “And this time, I won’t be coming back.”

Before he could reply, I ended the call and blocked his number.

The gate attendant called for boarding. I walked forward, heart steady, eyes clear.

*Where Injuries Meet Opportunity, and the Spread Gets a Little Spicy*

### Contextualizing the Chaos: Suns in Crisis, Kings in Control

The Phoenix Suns are currently playing basketball like a group of improv actors who forgot their lines. Key players—Ryan Dunn, Khaman Maluach, and Rasheer Fleming—are sidelined, leaving them with the roster of a team that raided a fantasy camp. Their last game? A 98-80 loss to the Atlanta Hawks, where even Oso Ighodaro’s 15-point, 7-rebound heroics couldn’t stop the bleeding. It’s like watching a magician perform with one hand tied behind his back and a leaky faucet in his pocket.

Meanwhile, the Sacramento Kings are the smooth-talking barista who always knows your coffee order. Fresh off a 109-92 win over the Bulls, they’re coming into this matchup with the swagger of a team that’s seen the future—and it’s a highlight reel. The Suns, on the other hand, are the underdog who bet their last $20 on a slot machine and now have the eyes of the casino on them.

---

### Key Data Points: When Numbers Tell a Story (and a Few Jokes)

Let’s start with the obvious: The Kings are favored by 5.5 points, with odds hovering around **-5.5 (-110)**. That’s a 51.3% implied probability, which sounds reasonable until you remember the Suns are missing **three rotation players** and their offense looks like a broken VCR—glitchy, confusing, and nobody knows where the tape ends.

But here’s the twist: The Suns’ defense isn’t exactly a fortress. In their loss to the Hawks, they allowed 98 points, which is about as secure as a screen door in a hurricane. If the Kings’ offense (which scored 109 against the Bulls) keeps firing on all cylinders, we might be looking at a **high-scoring game**. The total line is set at **181.5**, and with the Kings’ offensive firepower and the Suns’ defensive… *enthusiasm*, the Over feels like a roll of the dice with a 52% implied chance (per the market).

Now, let’s talk about the **same-game parlay**. The most tantalizing combo? **Sacramento to win and cover (-5.5) + Over 181.5**. Why? Because the

It feels a bit like a crime to move on with life and share my thoughts and experiences (just a bit of it) with friends who have shown me more kindness and emotional warmth than my damned parents.   
Almost a year of going no contact but it still feels heavy at times. Emotions that were buried for years haunt me asking for justice and solace. But sadly I do not feel like keeping up with them no more. I've tried to restablish the connection with them by giving them chance and asserting my boundaries it did not last long. It felt like drowning. I was carefully measuring out the time I spent with them, then spending the rest apart to maintain distance and peace.  
 I'm not even sure if they actually hold me dear. In some twisted way I guess yes. For sure my mother is more attached to the imaginary world she lives in, full of live and wishes. But I cannot help someone who doesn't want it in the first place.

At times it feels lonely as I cannot relate to other when it comes to the childhood and the family bond thay had forged. It seems abstract and logical at same time. No matter what I did while growing up, it was never enough, one mistake was enough to paint me like a monster and most useless member of the household.

  
I mean, imagine being a teenager and refusing to bring coffee to your mother's bed every single morning was enough for her to throw tantrum and silent treatment me for a week, while waiting for a growling apology (my father promised her to bring her coffee every morning, but for some reason she decided I should do it while he was not here). Or just simply not reading in her mind and start either cleaning or preparing a diner while she was doing shoping (not always but often enough), it was enough for tantrum.   
There was a time I was doing pottery classes, I made a lizard (a reference to certain artist she likes), while offering it to her she smiled weirdly and grabbed a lizard's limb and started to ""wrestle with it"" by simply trying to break it. It did break. But the only thing she had to say was ""oups I though it was more solid"", and she left it like this.   
Once I painted a simple object (simply by adding colors, not adding shadows or anything, I found basic colors to be nice enough at this time. I was around 14y old) and I gifted them to my parents. Obv, they were insulted by my gift as it was too simplistic, it ended as an argument as I refused to ""improve it"", cuz I was hurt. Anyway, the irony of it is, that year later they were proundly showing it to others. Anyway, it was always about a controll and serving well. I didn't want to kiss her on the mouth while saying goodbye ? Tantrum and silent treatment when I started to refuse. The only thing that worked well on me complying in was threatening to throw out my pet. The list goes on.  
  
My father was passive in my childood for sure when it came to my mother opinion, but what was worse he was participating in the screaming contests. It rarely occured that he actually contradicted my mother and stood his ground. 

In his mind, it was fine to rage scream and even insult me when I wasn't doing something right fast enough (as he said later - it was to motivate me, what a bullshit). It was part of the discipline. He was as well participating in the mocking contest. He did change a bit afer falling super sick, still on treatment. I hate to say it but, he became more gentle as his perspective shifted. It's one of the main reasons why I decided to actually give them a chance (also I felt morally conflicted, and I do still feel to some point). 

Finacially they were there but not emotionally.

I'm definitly doing better with time, by discovering myself, my wishes and working on myself to catch up with the world. I feel like I'm starting to really be alive and having a personality.   
I'm aware that the work is part of the journay and that I need a therapy. I think the hardest thing for me is showing vulerability and accepting the fact that I do deserve love (from which I'm shielding for some reason). In the back of my head I feel like a villain, I guess time will show.

### Contextualizing the Chaos: Spurs vs. Jazz in Las Vegas

The NBA Summer League is where dreams are forged, reputations are tested, and occasionally, a team’s entire identity is reduced to a meme about their mascot’s questionable fashion choices. This July 14 clash between the **San Antonio Spurs** and **Utah Jazz** is no different. The Spurs, undefeated in their first two games, are riding a wave of Summer League swagger, led by the enigmatic duo of David Jones-Garcia and Dylan Harper. Their efficiency? It’s like watching a Swiss watch play basketball—precise, unrelenting, and slightly unnerving.

The Jazz, meanwhile, are the underdog story we love to hate. Two losses in two games, and their offense looks like a broken VCR: glitchy, confusing, and nobody knows where the tape ends. But hey, underdogs have a way of making history. After all, who *doesn’t* want to bet on a team named after a bird that’s somehow still in the game?

---

### Key Data Points: The Numbers That Make You Question Reality

Let’s start with the **Spurs’ dominance**. Their first two games have been a masterclass in Summer League efficiency: shooting 52% from the field, outrebounding opponents by 8.5 boards per game, and holding teams to a pedestrian 48% shooting. David Jones-Garcia, the team’s secret weapon, has averaged 14 points and 6 assists per game, while Dylan Harper’s 12 rebounds per contest have turned the Spurs into a rebounding juggernaut.

On the flip side, the **Jazz** are a statistical enigma. Their offense has been so anemic that even their mascot, the “Jazz Bear,” has started bringing a thermos of coffee to games. In their first two matches, they’ve shot 38% from the field and turned the ball over 15 times per game. Cooper Flagg, the top pick, has shown flashes of brilliance (18 points in a loss to the Kings) but has yet to string together a complete performance.

*Recent history?* The Spurs and Jazz haven’t met in Summer League since 2022, but the narrative is clear: when the Spurs play with discipline, they’re a nightmare to beat. The Jazz? They’re the team that forgot to bring their playbook to Vegas.

### Odds & Strategy: The Parlay Playbook

The **DraftKings line** has the Spurs at **-4.5** with a total of **178.5**.

We fell deeply in love, building a life on whispered dreams and cheap coffee, a bond that felt truly unbreakable.

But then his memory returned, and my gentle Alex vanished, replaced by Alexander Sterling III, a cold, ruthless heir.

He discarded me like tr**h, his mother paid me off to disappear, and his cruel world, with his chillingly silent consent, shattered my artist's hand.

I watched the man I loved stand by as they destroyed me, wondering how a heart could turn so utterly indifferent.

Broken but not defeated, I used the 'hush money' to rebuild myself in Paris, emerging five years later as a renowned sculptor, alongside a man who truly cherished me.

My renewed happiness, however, ignited a terrifying obsession in Alex, unleashing a horrifying wave of vengeance on everyone he perceived to have wronged me--or so he twistedly claimed.

He thought this brutal ""justice"" would finally win me back, but all it revealed was the true, monstrous stranger the man I loved had become",1,1752507196.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

## **The Continuing Adventures Mouse Capone - Kincaid Montague in: “The Knockoff”**

---

### **Premise:**

Kincaid Montague, still searching for balance after *Mou5e Party (We Squeakin')* and his soul-shaking moment at Mr. Benedict’s acting class, wanders through New York’s neon-drenched night.

He stops at a flickering billboard above a bodega.

It’s an *advertisement* for a **cheap, knockoff Mouse Capone streaming show**:

> **“*The Rat's Ramblings!*”**
> *Starring* **Vern Vermin**
> *“He’s small, he’s brash, he’s got a coat, and he likes coffee! Streaming now.”*

Kincaid’s jaw drops.

---

### **The Poster:**

* A mouse vaguely shaped like Mouse Capone, but *off*:

  * Hat too small.
  * Grin too wide.
  * Dual laser pistols for *no apparent reason*.
  * Wearing *neon green goggles* for aesthetic.
  * Holding finger guns pointed at his shirt “COFFEE IS MY FUEL.”
* Taglines like:

  * “He Squeaks, He Leaps, He Carries a Grudge!”
  * “This City has a pest problem!*”
  * “Catch all 47 episodes—new misadventures weekly!”

---

### **Kincaid’s Reaction:**

He stares, slack-jawed, at the cheap animation loop playing on the l.e.d.'s:

Vern Vermin (knockoff) shouts:

> “The name’s Rascal. *Rat Rascal.* I’ll take a triple espresso, darling.”

He slams a palm over his face.

> “They even got the pet-name thing wrong…”

He looks around, but no one seems to notice the *fraudulence*.

He mutters to himself:

> “They’ll sell anything to a squeak with a trench coat these days.”

---

### **Kincaid Tries to Walk Away... But Can’t**

He circles back, watching a clip on a kid’s tablet:
Vern Vermin *dabs* after catching a falling safe, then looks at the camera:

> “Another day, another squabble!”

The kid laughs, munching neon popcorn.

Kincaid:

> “That’s not even… that’s not how… *it was never about the catchphrases!*”

---

### **The Final Beat:**

He sighs, standing beneath the ad, New York wind tugging at his too-large coat.

> “If you’re gonna steal the rhythm… at least get it right.”

He walks off into the neon glow, past another ad for “*Rat Rascal: Misadventure Galactic*.”

---

### **Post-Credit Stinger:**

Kincaid Montague, questions *reality*, elsewhere in a diner sipping coffee.

He sees Vern Vermin on the diner’s TV.

Kin mutters,

> “Wait 'til boss hears about this.”

1lzphb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/zoloft/comments/1lzphb6/my_room_is_clean_and_ive_kept_it_clean_for_the/,My room is clean and I've kept it clean for the first time in my life,"Started sertraline about 3 weeks ago. Was hesitant since SSRIs have never worked for me but my anxiety has been through the roof for the past year and I just chalked it up to the idea that I had moved on from suicidal levels of depression, and as a result suddenly caring about things made me worried about everything. Been on a variety of meds for 10+ years and wellbutrin helped with severe depression, but ultimately I just figured I was a person with depression, that has always been anxious.

As a result of my anxiety and depression, cleanliness around the house has never been my sweet spot. I've always had a messy room, cluttered and unorganized desk, constantly unfolded and unwashed laundry, etc. I've always been deeply embarrassed and wondered how my friends managed to keep their living spaces clean and organized consistently. If I ever did clean my room, it was undone within days and it would be months before it was cleaned again. 

Within days after starting sertraline, I felt this urge to just get organized. I tore out old cat pee stained carpet and replaced it, finally got rid of the tiny twin bed I've slept on for years now as an adult and upgraded, and deep cleaned my storage room. All in two days. After that, I deep cleaned my room, which considering I have about 2 dozen terrariums in it and countless reptile supplies, was an ordeal. I organized my desk, and throughout all this, threw away and donated at least 10 garbage bags of nonsense I had borderline been hoarding for some unknown reason. 

Since then, ive kept it clean. My laundry gets done as soon as my small laundry basket gets full. I can move freely through my room. Ive kept my desk organized. I take my dishes to the sink as soon as Im done with them (no more walks of shame carrying a dozen coffee mugs to the sink once it piles up too much). On a whim I've organized and cleaned out our nightmarish silverware drawer, the junk drawer is next. And I feel motivated to keep it this way, and feel unbelievably satisfied from it all. I honestly get a bit bored of playing videogames now unless Im playing with friends, whereas I used to rot in front of my PC for hours on end from the moment I woke up. 

Its only been a short time and I cannot say just how grateful I am to my GP who recommended I give it a try despite my hesitations since I was already taking 3 medications for my depression and anxiety. Its changed my life.

I dont care if my dick is basically numb, my dick be damned. Im 25 years old and Im finally living as a functional adult. And Im so grateful for this. I think Im going to bake some cookies for my doctor for my next appointment. 

Not much point to this post other than to just express my gratitude to some people who may have also experienced how good this feels. Thank you sertraline.",1,1752507010.0,zoloft,0,1.0,False

Have you guys noticed the AI chatter lately? It's like everyone and their grandmother is talking about it, right? Well, if you haven't dived into this yet, let me tell you—you might just be standing at the edge of a gold mine! 💰

So, here’s the deal: **Upskilling in AI isn’t just cool; it’s downright essential!** Think about it: thriving in today’s job market is all about working smarter, not harder, and AI is your best buddy in this quest. 

If you’re still on the fence or like, ""Why should I bother?"" here are a few reasons you might want to start learning ASAP:

- **High Demand, High Rewards**: Companies are tripping over themselves to find AI-savvy talent. According to a report I read (somewhere in the deep, dark depths of the internet), jobs in AI are expected to grow by *over 30% in the next few years!* Just think about the opportunities that could open up for you.

- **Work from Anywhere**: Want to escape the cubicle life? Equip yourself with AI skills, and suddenly the world is your office. Beach? Coffee shop? Your couch in pajama pants? Yes, please!

- **Future-Proof**: Let’s be real—if you’re not adapting, you’re left behind. With AI emerging everywhere from healthcare to marketing, gaining these skills now means you won’t be scrambling to catch up later.

Now, I get it. Where do you even start with all this, right? That’s where programs like those from [Imagine Education](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals) come in. 🍏 They're designed to be user-friendly and engaging, even if you’re starting from scratch. 

A little personal story: I picked up some AI skills last year, and honestly, it’s like I unlocked a cheat code for my career! 💃 I went from struggling to find gigs to having clients come to *me*. It’s like I transformed into some kind of AI wizard overnight! (Okay, maybe not overnight, but you get the picture. 🤓)

Now, I’m not saying it’s all rainbows and sunshine. Upskilling takes time. You might need to put in some late-night study sessions or swap Netflix binges for online courses (but trust me, it’s totally worth it!).

So, how about you? Have you jumped on the AI train yet, or are you still living in the pre-AI era? 🚂💨 Let’s chat about where you see yourself fitting into this big, AI-driven world! And feel free to share your thoughts or experiences, because cheers to learning together! 🍻",1,1752506811.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

Looking for a book I read a few year ago about a mortician who was cursed by being invisible to death, except when they were asleep, at which time people around them die suddenly. There are other characters like them, including a hitman who can sleep with half his brain at a time, and uses coffee and nicotine to stay awake. These characters can be sedated safely, as it is only natural sleep that causes the issue, and I have a vague recollection of an organisation that keeps people afflicted in comas to avoid incidents 

Main plot involves helping someone who's powers have recently manifested, and an infamous opal ring (perhaps the one owned by Alfonso XII?) which is believed to allow death to see you, and the knowledge he can come get you at any time stops the attacks. All events take place in central Europe.

I read this book in English however I have a feeling it was originally written in and translated from German.

Hi everyone. 

I live in an apartment that has five rooms and can hold six people. I’ve had the same consistent roommate for the two years I have lived here, who the same hallway as me. I never had a problem with her. When our past roommates lived here before moving out, id always invite her to our roommate gatherings but she would never attend. She opened up and said she had social anxiety and bad experiences with roommates in the past, so she didn’t want to get to know us. I respected that and stopped contacting her about events we planned. 

Now that it’s just us living together, it’s a mess. 

Our bathroom is very odd. It’s one long bathroom with a shower on each side, two toilet rooms, and three sinks along the opposite wall. We shared the same shower, sink, and toilet since it was convenient and on our side of the apartment. Though, she stopped cleaning which led me doing it constantly. I’d reach out about it and she wouldn’t answer my texts. The only time id see her is if she was washing her dishes or passing through, but she would ignore me saying hi or asking how she was. 

Fast forward to a month and a half ago, my boyfriend and I came in after a night out and were taking our shoes off in the living room. I was a bit loud coming in, talking, but then in less than ten seconds I was like “oh it’s pretty late, I don’t want to bother neighbors” and started to whisper. Literally less than a minute of us being on the couch to remove our shoes, she stormed in and yelled at us, telling us to be quiet because it was late and she was sleeping. I was drunk so my boyfriend responded for me, saying we’d quiet down and go to my bedroom. Very respectful even though we were BARELY making noise. She also had her outside clothes on too, so I doubt she was sleeping. But regardless, I was in the wrong for coming in loudly at first so I took responsibility. 

Anyway, I sat down for a moment in my room before going to the bathroom to use the toilet. When I came out, she was standing in the hallway and blocked me from walking past her. She started screaming at me and telling me to not do anything inappropriate with my boyfriend, as she didn’t want to hear anything. We only ever did things in my bedroom when she was gone (her car wasn’t home and her shoes weren’t there) so I found that to be really strange. 

Next occurrence was less than a week later. My boyfriend and I were having a few seltzers while watching tv in the living room during the day. Normal activities. She came inside from being gone for a few hours and again, didnt respond to me or my boyfriend saying hi. He quickly left because he felt uncomfortable, and I went to my room to change into more comfortable clothes before cleaning up the few cans on the coffee table. Before I could even change, my roommate was banging on my door furiously and then screamed at me. She told me she was a recovering alcoholic and that I needed to clean up the mess NOW. I quickly apologized as I literally didn’t know out of the two years we lived together, since she never told me. My roommates drunk in the apartment all of the time and even left a mess for over a day sometimes after doing so. She never said anything to them. But again, I just apologized quickly cleaned it up. Then went on with my day.

Another week later, my family was in town because i graduated from uni. It was only my mom, grandma, and brother who is nearing 10 years old so he didn’t make noise at all. They were only ever over during the daytime and even helped clean the place due to the stress I had been under with having to clean after me AND her. She even sent a text of body wash I accidentally put on the shower wall. Instead of asking me to clean it up, she accused me or my family of doing inappropriate things in the shower and thought that the body wash (sensitive skin dove body wash) was…yeah. I didn’t even respond to her because it was a crazy and disrespectful accusation. She even took that as an excuse of why she didn’t clean the bathroom and said I was dirtying the place. My family purchased a bunch of items to set up the other side of the bathroom for me, so I would only have to clean up after myself. Since then, my side has been completely clean, while hers is a complete mess and smells. 

One day, my family was about to leave because they had other plans and I wanted to rest, but my roommate came into the living room and asked when they’d be leaving TOWN since she was tired of them coming over. My mom defended me, explaining that I’m allowed to have guests if they’re respectful (ESPECIALLY family who are only in town for five days out of a year), but she snapped and began to hit herself and claim that she has ptsd. My grandma tried to comfort her with words but she started cursing at her. Yeah, cursing at my GRANDMA. And then she stormed out. I didn’t feel safe at all because she started throwing stuff in her bedroom and yelling at her cat, so I went to my family’s hotel for the night. 

These are just the three major things. She’s since then yelled at me for having my pajamas folded on my side of the bathroom, having boxes in the living room since I am NOW moving soon, and my friend coming inside for less than two minutes to help me carry my belongings inside after a trip out of town. She also accused me of having people over too much. Our old roommate gave her boyfriend a literal key to the place and he practically lived here and slept here every night. She never said anything to them. Me, I only have people over during the daytime, and my boyfriend has only slept over a few times after a night out since he literally works six days a week AT night. 

I also think she has a literal camera or voice box near my bedroom. I can’t prove it but from everything she’s said and her coming to my side of the hallway at times and making noise as if she’s rummaging through something, it’s very strange.

# Chapter 1- Kiss Me

Cora

“The child you were carrying is not mine!”

My husband, Zach, burst into the conference room and slammed a DNA test into my face, shouting loud enough to shake the walls.

Just a second earlier, the manager had started to say my name in the promotion meeting.

Smirks. [Whispers.My](http://Whispers.My) wolf coworkers looked pleased—like watching me get dragged was the highlight of their day.

It gave them the perfect excuse to ignore my work, my late nights, everything I’d done to get here—

and reduce me to a woman who “couldn’t even keep her legs closed.”

The Manager didn’t even look at me. Just crossed his arms and frowned, like I’d fooled him somehow.

“Maybe take this outside?” he said, nodding toward the door.

It wasn’t a suggestion. My stomach dropped.

I heard snickers behind me. My face burned, but I forced a smile.

“Of course. I’ll be right back.”

Zach kept yelling as I dragged him into an empty office. He shook off my grip and started pacing like a caged animal.

“Why would you even ask that?” I said, barely keeping my voice steady. “Of course he’s your son.”

“That’s not what the test says.”

“Then the test is wrong. We used your sperm in the tube, Zach. It has to be yours.” I glanced at the door. I couldn’t be gone long. I still had a promotion to claim.

Zach folded his arms. “The machine was checked. I think you lied.”

“I didn’t,” I snapped. “But I don’t have time for this right now. We’ll talk at home.”

He called after me, but I didn’t stop. I half-ran back to the conference room—

and found it empty.

Gone. My moment. My name. My shot.

I stood there like an idiot, praying maybe someone had waited. But no one had.

I told myself my work would speak for me. That maybe, just maybe, the manager wouldn’t hold Zach’s drama against me.

But then I saw her.

Amy. Sitting on my desk like she owned it. Reapplying lipstick, like this was some kind of joke.

She didn’t even look at me until she was done. Then she smirked.

“These need to be finished before I get back tomorrow.”

She jabbed a stack of files with a perfectly manicured nail.

“I’m not your assistant,” I said, my voice low.

She slid off the desk, all smug and slow.

“How would you know? Check your email, single mother.”

I froze.

No. No way.

She didn’t just take my promotion. She waited for me to leave—and stole it.

And now she was rubbing it in my face.

I wanted to scream. But if I did, I might lose everything.

So I bit my tongue. Sat down. And started on her work.

The stack was massive. I’d probably throw out my back just trying to deliver them.

“At least I’m not a single mother,” I muttered. “I still have Zach.”

Amy paused mid-strut. Turned back with a grin.

“Now who can guarantee that?”

She winked and walked off, swinging her hips like she’d just won the world.

I finished the files late that night, every bone in my body aching.

The drive home was a blur—I barely remembered the red lights, the turns, or even parking. I just wanted to collapse into bed and disappear.

As I slid the key into the front door, I heard it.

A moan. High-pitched. Familiar.

“Oh yes! Right there! There! Go faster!”

Amy.

Her voice cut through the stillness of the house like glass shattering.

I froze, hand on the doorknob, breath locked in my throat.

But then—

“You’re the best baby! ”the man's voice was filled with ambiguous gasps.

It’s my husband, Zach.

The man I defended. The man I just told myself I still had.

He gasped,“Can you imagine? Cora actually says 'I love you' during sex.”

They laughed together. Soft. Intimate. Cruel.

My jaw tightened, and for a second, I thought I might be sick.

I stepped inside, the house smelled like soup.

It took a second to register—the stove light was still on, a pot gently steaming, as if this were just another normal night.

Something cold and sharp settled in my chest.

I grabbed the pot and made my way up the stairs.

It was heavy, hot, but I barely noticed.

I didn’t knock, just opened the bedroom door—and threw the soup straight at them.

Screams. Chaos. Burnt skin. Two naked bodies scrambling like rats.

Amy shrieked. “How dare you, you lowly human!”

Right. Human. Not a werewolf. Not his mate.

Just the one who sacrificed everything for him.

He said he didn’t need a mate. That he didn’t care about blood or status.

Liar.

And of all people—Amy? The one who humiliated me daily?

Did he not remember the nights I cried myself to sleep because of her?

Zach growled. “What the hell is wrong with you?! I was finally getting satisfied—and you ruined it.”

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

My body was frozen. My mind blank.

I had spent the whole day working late to hold our family together—

And this was what I came home to.

He didn’t even blink.

Just looked at me with that same smug, lazy smirk.

“You’re always tired. Always busy.”

He shrugged like this was obvious. Reasonable.

“I got tired of waiting.”

That was it.

No guilt. No apology.

Just facts. Like I should’ve seen it coming.

Amy stretched like a satisfied cat, chest bare, lips still swollen from kissing my husband.

“Oh, baby,” she purred, her voice dripping sugar and poison. “She never deserved you.”

She arched her back, fingers trailing slowly down her stomach like I wasn’t even there.

“I always knew you’d end up in the right bed.”

Then she looked at me—dead in the eyes—and smiled.

“Honestly, Cora,” she added sweetly, “you should thank me. At least someone’s keeping him satisfied.”

Then, without shame or hesitation, they started kissing again.

His hands roamed over her body like I was invisible. Her moans filled the room.

And I just stood there. Watching.

Like I didn’t exist.

My chest tightened, the pressure building beneath my ribs until it hurt to breathe. My throat burned.

But I didn’t scream. There was no point. They wouldn’t hear it.

They never did.

I turned away, eyes stinging, rage boiling beneath the numbness.

And then I saw the thermostat.

I walked over and cranked it down—every degree, until it was set to freezing.

Let them freeze together. Let the air bite their skin the way their betrayal was biting through me.

It wouldn’t fix anything. I knew that.

But I needed to do something.

Anything.

I had left this disgusting place but didn’t know where I was going.

I just kept walking, numb, until I saw a warm light glowing through a window.

No one stopped me. I sat and started drinking—whiskey, straight. One after another.

My body went numb. My chest didn’t.

So I called Daisy. She answered like nothing was wrong.

Like my whole world wasn’t collapsing.

When I told her everything, she sighed softly. “Look, maybe this is your sign to let go.”

“I can’t just let go. I’m still married. Riley—”

“I know. But just for tonight, can you stop being the responsible one?” Her voice dipped into something playful. “Go wild. Drink. Flirt. Find someone hot and forget everything.”

I pressed the cold rim of the glass to my lips. “Like who?”

She laughed. “It’s a hotel bar. Maybe there’s someone already waiting upstairs. You’ve earned at least one good night, haven’t you?”

Her voice wrapped around me, the only comfort I had left.

“Thanks,” I whispered. “You always know what I need.”

“I’ve got you,” she said. “Always.”

The more I drank, the fuzzier everything became—until I found myself stumbling into the elevator, barely steady on my feet.

When the doors slid open, I drifted out and knocked on the first door I saw.

The door opened, and temptation looked me in the eye.

All muscle, shadows, and silent power.

A man with black hair, tousled like he’d just rolled off satin sheets.

Whiskey-dark eyes raked over me, slow and deliberate, like he was undressing me with a single glance.

Bare chest. Defined abs. Thick arms like they were carved to hold me against the wall until I forgot my own name.

Lips full enough to do damage—perfect for ruining a woman like me.

He looked like every bad decision I’d never had the courage to make. And tonight, I didn’t care if I burned for it.

He didn’t speak. Didn’t smile. Just stood there, still and composed, like he was used to being in control of everything.

But those eyes? They watched me like I was something he hadn’t decided on yet—something dangerous, or something he might want.

The air between us buzzed, thick with something I couldn’t name. My skin prickled. My legs wobbled, and not just from the alcohol.

Somewhere in my haze, I remembered Daisy’s voice: Maybe there’s someone already waiting upstairs…

And looking at him now—this stranger with a body built for sin and a gaze sharp enough to cut—I believed it.

This had to be her surprise. A distraction.

God, she really did think of everything.

I didn’t ask his name. Didn’t care.

I just stepped closer.

“Kiss me.”

That was the last full sentence I spoke that night.

# Chapter 2- Small Change

Cora

His mouth crashed into mine, possessing me with his kiss. Immediately, I was consumed by him. Every other thought, fear, and stressor that had plagued me fled in an instant.

He pulled me into his apartment, his muscular arms crushing me against his broad chest. I let myself be consumed by him as he directed me toward his bedroom. He pushed me down onto his bed.

One minute I was clothed and the next I wasn’t. He tore layers from me savagely.

And I let him. I allowed myself to be lost in him, to lose myself to his skilled hands.

His kisses were rough as he pressed his lips to my neck. I felt the scruff of his stubble scratch pleasantly and moaned.

A growl escaped him when he heard it. Whatever thin leash had been holding him back snapped.

His hands claimed me. His mouth devoured me.

I gasped and whimpered, utterly at his mercy. He was clearly well-practiced, and I let him take the lead, giving myself over to him and my own pleasure. Everywhere he touched seemed to light up, to burn beneath him.

When he entered me, I gasped at his size. Every thrust brought me closer to climax, the tension building between us.

He really knew what he was doing.

This stranger, this escort, was the perfect escape. When he brought me to the edge, when he broke me apart and made me cry out, I didn’t think there could be a better feeling in the world.

I needed that moment more than I knew.

\*\*\*

Sunlight was already glaring through the curtains, assaulting my eyes. I blinked once. Twice. My head throbbed from the whiskey and bad decisions of the previous evening.

I rolled over and checked the watch I had hastily thrown on the unfamiliar nightstand last evening—8:00 a.m.

“Shit,” I hissed, jolting upright. I had exactly one hour before I’d be officially late.

I threw the covers off and jumped to my feet, my heart thudding against my ribs like a warning bell. As I reached for my clothes, the sound of running water came from the bathroom. More details from the night before came rushing back to me.

Zach and Amy’s betrayal.

Daisy’s advice and a few shots of whiskey.

The escort.

My stomach flipped. There were so many things racing through my mind, but the most vivid of them all was the memory of his hands. His smell was still lingering on me, deeply masculine and delicious.

No. I was in no shape to be thinking about him. Not now.

Getting dressed felt like a race against time and shame. Just as I reached for my bag, I realized with a jolt that I hadn’t paid him for his time.

My face burned. Had it come to this? Paying a man for his attention?

Fumbling through my pockets, I came up with a pitiful handful of crumpled bills. Great. Nothing screamed “thank you for the night” like loose change.

I tossed the cash on the table and rushed out, hoping it was enough. Maybe if I was lucky I would never see him again.

I skirted into the building a minute before 9 o’clock, just barely arriving on time, But I had no time to dwell on my small win.

“How long are you planning to keep your junk here? That spot’s for the new hire,” came a voice I’d hoped to avoid altogether.

Amy.

I turned just in time to catch the box she flung at me, the corner of it smacking against my forehead. It was too early to deal with her like this, and my head had already been pounding from last night’s whiskey.

I staggered, just barely biting back a retort, and noticed a paper fluttering inside.

A transfer notice from the Sales Department. My heart dropped.

“‘Reassigned to the President’s office’?” I read aloud, stunned. “What is this?”

Amy’s smile was as sweet as it was venomous. “Signed by yours truly. I decided it was time for a change.”

“I didn’t do anything wrong. On what grounds?”

My heart was racing in my chest. This couldn’t be happening.

She shrugged, too satisfied. “Just on the grounds that I’m your supervisor, sweetheart.”

My fist clenched around the paper. This wasn’t just a transfer; it was a power move. And it had its intended effect: humiliation.

But I couldn’t let her win. Not when I had someone counting on me.

I looked at my phone, which I was clenching desperately to remain upright. Riley’s little face grinned up at me from the lock screen.

My strength. My reason.

“Oops, only five minutes left until reporting deadline. Maybe you’d rather go home and cry—alone?” Amy pouted mockingly and glanced at her watch for emphasis.

It was all I could do not to shout at her in front of all of our coworkers. Who did she think she was? I narrowed my eyes at her, wondering what would happen if I decided to publicly hurl her affair with Zach in her face.

Angrily, I grabbed the box and made my way to the top floor of the company building. The CEO’s office loomed ahead, glittering with luxury. The top floor felt like another world. I took a deep breath, trying to calm the bubbling anger in my chest.

Maybe this wasn’t all bad. Sure, most junior assistants were glorified errand runners, but the salary was better than sales. And if I played my cards right, maybe I could work my way up.

The office buzzed with energy. Everyone was on edge, whispering about the new CEO’s arrival. I rarely saw the werewolf colleagues in the company this serious.

“Hey, you—new girl,” someone called. “Go take care of this.”

A stack of prep work landed in my hands. Decorations, catering coordination, IT setup—it felt like planning a royal visit. Must be one hell of a boss.

By the time I finished my first list of assignments in my new position, sweat clung to my back, and my legs ached. Just about then, the announcement came: the CEO canceled the induction meeting.

I scoffed at the message. Typical.

But the silver lining? I got off work on time for the first time in seven years.

I picked Riley up and we headed to his checkup. At least, that was the plan. On the way there, between songs Riley and I were happily singing along to, the secondhand car I was driving started making a grating noise.

We barely got another few yards before the car sputtered, coughed, and died.

“Of course,” I muttered, as I punched on my hazards. I tried to hide my panic from Riley as I got out of the car.

We couldn’t miss this appointment. I wasn’t certain when the next time I would be free to take him would be.

I stepped out onto the road, stuck out my hand, and prayed for a miracle.

I began frantically trying to hail a car, waving down anyone who passed by. But they all kept going, merciless as they continued driving. One of the cars had even honked at me teasingly.

Just as I was about to give up, the universe finally delivered my miracle wrapped in a sleek, black luxury sedan. The passenger window rolled down, and I froze.

Him.

The escort.

His gaze locked onto mine, and I felt the temperature drop ten degrees. His jaw was tight, expression unreadable—but those eyes? Unmistakable.

Recognition flashed between us like lightning. I could see him hesitate, and I stiffened, waiting for him to acknowledge this strange feeling passing between us.

But he said nothing. Just unlocked the door.

I hesitated for half a second before climbing in, heart pounding like a drumline. I had been intimate with this man, but I didn’t really know him. It wasn’t like I had many options, though.

Riley happily chattered in the back seat as the escort drove, oblivious to the awkward silence threatening to choke me.

I realized, with a sinking heart, that I might’ve insulted the man beside me. I had no idea how much escorts made, but leaving a few crumpled bills? That was low. Disrespectful, even.

As soon as we pulled up to the clinic, Riley flung the door open and dashed up the steps in pursuit of a promised lollipop.

I turned to him. “Listen, about the money—”

His expression changed instantly, darkening like a storm. I could practically hear his molars grinding, almost like he wanted to devour me.

I swallowed dryly, feeling my heart stutter in my chest. Before I could finish apologizing, Riley tripped over a step.

“Riley!” I screamed, lunging forward.

And then—he moved.

One moment the escort was standing next to me. The next second, the man appeared on the opposite set of steps, tightly holding Riley in his arms.

# Chapter 3- These Cards

Cora

“Careful!” He was cradling Riley in his arms like he’d always been there.

No sound. No blur. Just impossible speed.

My mouth dropped open. It hit me all at once.

He was a werewolf.

It explained the raw power, the eyes, the instincts, the fury.

And it explained why my tip had offended him so deeply. What could be more insulting to a werewolf who drives a luxury car than being handed loose change?

I blushed deeply as all of these realizations rushed at me. Though I had started out the morning humiliated by Amy, I was filled with even more shame now.

He gently set Riley down, his touch oddly tender. And then he turned to go, quick as that.

I watched him leave, my mind spinning. It seemed impossible, what had just happened. What were the odds?

I held Riley’s hand tightly as we stepped into the examination room. I was still unnerved from everything that had just happened, my legs feeling weak beneath me. Being under the fluorescent lights did nothing to help calm my mounting anxiety.

The doctor greeted us with a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. He asked Riley to sit on the exam table, and I helped him up, smoothing his shirt and brushing his hair from his forehead.

“We’ve finished running all the tests,” the doctor said, turning to me. He was a middle-aged man who meant all business.

I nodded, bracing myself.

“Riley’s developmental speed has clearly surpassed the average for his age. His physical metrics, cognitive ability, and reflexes… they are all advanced. But that alone isn’t a cause for concern.”

There was a pause. My heart paused as well as I waited.

“There’s more?” I pressed, voice thin.

The doctor glanced at Riley, then back to me. “His bloodwork revealed some anomalies.”

My breath caught. “What kind of anomalies?”

Again, that long look. It was like he was silently weighing how much to say.

He lowered his voice. “We believe that if Riley were to get injured, especially if it involved bleeding, it must be stopped immediately. His blood coagulation is… unusual. It could pose a serious risk if left unchecked.”

I felt the floor tilt under me.

“What are you saying?” I whispered so that only the doctor could hear. I didn’t want Riley to pick up on this next part. “That he’s fragile?”

“Not exactly,” the doctor said carefully. “There’s something… different in his blood composition. Not weak, just unpredictable. We’re still trying to figure it out.”

He leaned in closer, his voice dropping even lower. “That’s why we recommend testing the biological father. Without that, we can’t draw concrete conclusions.”

Of course. The biological father.

Not Zach.

Not anyone I knew.

The pain of everything—Zach’s betrayal, the divorce, the humiliation of publicly being accused of cheating—rushed back like a flood.

I remembered the report Zach had thrown at me, accusing me of ruining his life, claiming Riley wasn’t his son while all of our coworkers watched on. And in the thick of all of my recent emotional chaos, I hadn’t even had time to confirm anything with the hospital.

And now, it mattered more than ever.

Riley was looking up at me with a question in his dark eyes. He seemed so small sitting there. It was clear he knew that something was wrong.

I took Riley’s hand again and kissed his forehead. “We’re going to figure this out, okay?”

He nodded like the brave little soul he was.

\*\*\*

Later that day, I made a trip to the IVF specimen collection center with Riley in tow. I set him down in the lobby before approaching the front desk. I couldn’t stand the thought of bringing Riley to overhear whatever might be revealed.

The receptionist scanned my ID and tapped the keyboard for a while, frowning slightly as she read the screen.

“Yes,” she said, drawing the word out. “You’re one of the flagged cases.”

“Flagged?” I echoed, dreading the answer.

“A former employee—he made several… errors. Left three years ago before he left. One of those errors was your file.”

I closed my eyes for a moment. “So the sperm I was impregnated with wasn’t the donor I chose?”

“We believe that’s the case. We’ve narrowed it to two possible donors based on the timing and storage logs.”

She looked up at me with an expression that seemed almost like pity. “To confirm, we need the original IVF documentation. The one we issued at the time of your procedure. Without that, we can’t verify the father.”

Just as I was about to ask more questions, a shout rang out from the next room.

“How could you lose the sperm?!”

The door flew open and a man stormed out. His footsteps were heavy, and his fury was radiating off of him.

I froze.

Him.

The werewolf. The escort. The man I’d spent one unforgettable night with.

Of course he’d be here.

Of course.

But what were the odds that he would be here too? I hadn’t seen this man before last night and now I had run into him three times within twenty-four hours! Was my luck truly this bad?

As he strode angrily, I couldn’t help but pause to admire him. Tall, broad-shouldered, jaw clenched tight with rage. Even angry, he was distracting.

Suddenly, I ducked my head instinctively, praying he wouldn’t recognize me.

But he barely glanced my way. Fury was wafting from him, and he was clearly too filled with rage to pay me any mind. He stormed down the hall, muttering about incompetence and legal action.

I turned away from where he had just left, doors swinging in his wake. Before me was a wall, and my eyes caught on the posters that were layered over it.

My eyes landed on one that read: “Sperm Donor Compensation – Elite Rates for Enhanced Genetics.”

The list beneath it was quite detailed: bonuses for rare bloodlines, high stamina, regenerative ability…

My eyes flicked back toward the hallway where the werewolf had disappeared.

I exhaled a shaky laugh, partly from exhaustion, partly from disbelief.

It was clear now how he was able to afford his nice car and clothes. Not only from escorting, but from sperm donations as well. Given his stamina, he was an excellent candidate to rake it in here.

I turned back to the payment counter and handed over my main credit card. The clerk swiped it.

Declined.

I blinked. That couldn’t be right. “Can you try it again?”

She did.

Still declined.

I tried another card. And another. All of them bounced back with the same cold, robotic message: Transaction Rejected.

“Sorry, ma’am.”

No, there was only one reason all of these cards wouldn’t work. There was only one person who could be behind all of it.

Of course they’d all been frozen. Zach’s handiwork. He probably saw this coming and preemptively locked me out.

My heart sank to my shoes. I could feel the judgmental stares from behind me. Before I could say anything, a hand slid past me on the counter, placing a card that shimmered slightly under the lights.

“Use this,” a deep voice said.

I turned slowly.

It was him.

Of course it was him.

Again, I blinked stupidly. I almost couldn’t believe he had returned.

He didn’t even look at me, just handed over the card like it was nothing.

The clerk’s demeanor changed immediately. “Right away, sir.”

I turned back to him. “Thank you, but I can’t accept this without paying you back somehow. Let me at least write you an IOU or—”

He glanced at my pile of useless credit cards on the counter and smirked. “With what, those cards?”

I flushed. This might be the most humiliating day of my life.

“I—” I didn’t have an answer.

Before I could stammer out anything remotely intelligent, he turned and retrieved his card from the clerk. He gave her a tight, unconvincing smile. For me, he offered nothing.

And with that, he walked away without another word.

I stared after him, stunned and mortified and… confused.

Again.

\*\*\*

When Riley and I finally got back to the house, I was hoping for a break. I desperately needed one.

I would’ve given anything for a moment of quiet. I might have even been satisfied with five blessed minutes to think about nothing.

But of course, I couldn’t have that.

Instead, I opened the door to find Amy—of all people—sitting on the couch, legs crossed like she belonged there.

She looked up with faux surprise. “Oh! I thought you would be gone longer.”

“What are you doing here?” I snapped.

“Oh, Zach said I could stay,” she said casually, gesturing to her overnight bag. The bag in my hallway.

In my house.

“Zach!” I yelled, voice echoing through the hall.

He appeared, stumbling slightly, reeking of whiskey.

“What?” he slurred.

“What the hell is going on?” My eyes flicked back and forth between him and his smug mistress. Amy’s mouth was quirked in a smirk as she watched on.

He laughed. “You don’t get to question me. This house is mine. You think you can run around, get knocked up by some random wolf, and still come back here?”

Riley pressed his face against my leg, hiding.

“Zach,” I started, my voice tight and barely restrained. “This is our house too. Don’t—”

Zach cut me off, pointing at Riley with a shaky finger. “Get out of my house! And take that bastard kid without a father with you!”

# Chapter 4- New Chance

Cora

I stepped between them so fast my vision blurred, my hands covering Riley’s ears before he could hear that last part.

“Don’t you dare say that again,” I said coldly.

Zach didn’t.

For a moment, it looked like he had plenty to say, the options hanging on the tip of his tongue. But then he turned abruptly and disappeared into the bedroom, slamming the door behind him.

I crouched to pick up Riley, whispering gently. “We’re leaving, baby. Right now.”

I didn’t care where we went. We just had to go.

I packed up the essentials we would need as quickly as possible and in silence, my body moving on autopilot while my mind spun in circles. I pulled Riley behind me hurriedly, eager to get him out of the house in case Zach decided to return and begin shouting again.

As we left, I heard Amy laugh shrilly behind us.

Riley snored softly in the car while I drove. He deserved so much better than this chaos.

I took us both to the old house—the one I’d kept paying rent on after our parents passed. It still smelled like lemon cleaner and dusty books. It was familiar. Safe, in a way.

Daisy was already there with her son, Ben, their toys strewn across the living room floor like nothing had changed. They had moved in years before when Ben’s father had left them without warning, leaving Daisy and their newborn child with nowhere else to go.

Daisy watched me enter the home with a concerned look. She stood, wasting no time before asking me what was wrong. My sister could always tell when something was amiss.

I sat down on the couch with a huff. After I told her everything, Daisy came over and sat beside me on the couch, her expression serious.

“So, Riley’s not Zach’s son?” she asked quietly.

I shook my head.

She frowned. “Then who is?”

I pulled the IVF report out of my bag and unfolded the worn paper. I pointed at the bold, sterile number near the bottom.

“No. 59,” I said. “Anonymous donor. Maybe he was an athlete? Even the doctor mentioned that Riley’s development has been… advanced.”

Daisy didn’t look convinced by this assumption. She kept glancing between the paper and Riley, who was now sharing popcorn with Ben and giggling at cartoons. Her lips pressed into a tight line.

“I’ll bring the report to the hospital this weekend,” I added. “Try to confirm his identity. Maybe I can talk to someone more about everything.”

Daisy looked at me, worried. “You sure you want to dig into this? What if it’s something weird? Something you don’t want to find out?”

I didn’t answer her right away. I wasn’t sure what I wanted. But something in my gut told me I had to know.

For Riley, I needed to figure this out.

\*\*\*

The next morning, just after breakfast, the doorbell rang.

I opened the door to find a middle-aged man in a charcoal suit, holding a clipboard. His expression was neutral, but his eyes were sharp like he was taking in every detail about me and the house.

“Hello. I apologize if this is too forward, but are you the one who did IVF at Silverpine General about six years ago?” he asked.

I opened my mouth to reply, but before I could answer, my phone buzzed. A message popped up in my work group chat: ""Mandatory meeting at 9 a.m. CEO introduction. No late arrivals tolerated.""

My heart stuttered. I had thirty minutes to get there.

I glanced back at the man, who was still drawling on, but I barely registered his words. I tuned him out, nodding quickly, before I murmured something polite and motioned for him to speak with Daisy.

I didn’t have time for this. It was probably just another safety check.

Werewolf communities had strict policies about human residency. I’d learned to live with the constant background hum of suspicion.

I made it to the office ten minutes early, my hair slightly frizzy and one heel scuffed. But I was there.

I exhaled, clutching my coffee like it was a lifeline, and took a seat in the assistant bullpen. With a few minutes to spare, I finally called the divorce lawyer I'd found online. My hands were still shaking when I hung up.

Zach had filed for a freeze on our joint assets. His claim? That I’d committed adultery and had a child out of wedlock.

I could have screamed right there in the middle of the office.

He knew about the IVF mistake! He knew Riley wasn’t born from some affair. But instead of owning his own infidelity, he had weaponized this mistake, twisting the truth.

I’d always known Zach was selfish. But this? This was cruel.

With a quickly sent text, I set up an appointment with the lawyer for later that week and shoved my phone back into my bag.

Every card I owned was frozen—except for my payroll card. And as a junior assistant? My salary barely covered groceries, let alone food for four, rent, school fees…

I rested my head in my hands, a wave of nausea hitting me. How was I going to make it all work? I had to figure something out—fast.

A new message popped up in our group chat, tearing my attention away from my self-pitying.

“The new CEO will select one of the junior assistants to promote as his personal secretary,” it said.

I sat up straighter.

It wasn’t much, but it was something. The secretary position came with a pay raise, benefits, and influence. It could be a lifeline in this deepening mess that was my life.

I typed a quick message to Daisy: “Tell Riley I’ll be home late tonight. Big opportunity. I need this.”

Hurriedly, I typed out my application at my desk, filling it out as fast as I could so that I could get to the mountain of work waiting for me.

I sent it in and sighed with relief. No sooner had I completed the task than the gossip group on our groupchat lit up. Curiously, I clicked open the thread.

“Have you seen the new boss yet?”

“He looks like a damn supermodel. I swear I forgot how to breathe.”

“Did you see the boss’s face? He looks like he just walked off a runway.”

“I’d die in his arms.”

I rolled my eyes. This was completely unprofessional. But I couldn’t help scrolling through the full chat thread.

Everyone was in a frenzy over this new CEO. Despite my initial hangups about their conversation, the flood of emojis, memes, and grainy hallway photos made me laugh for the first time in days.

Surely they were blowing this all out of proportion.

“Probably just some narcissist in a nice suit,” I muttered to myself.

Footsteps echoed down the hall. A hush fell over the office like a flipped switch.

And just like that, he was here.

I turned my head slowly, resisting the urge to act too eagerly. But then I saw him, and my heart slammed into my ribs.

No. Fucking. Way.

It was him.

He looked striking in his black tailored suit. Even at a glance, it was clear that he was covering a powerful, muscular figure beneath.

He had the face that could inspire an artist with a strong, perfectly chiseled jaw and flawless, smooth skin. I could still remember the feel of his stubble brushing against my neck the previous evening.

His eyes were gray and cutting, so beautiful I could get lost in them. And I had.

The escort. The angry man who had given me a ride. The same man I had seen at the clinic the day before.

He was walking toward the other employees who were still openly ogling him. When he moved, it was like he owned the world.

But he was still lost in another conversation, his phone pressed to his ear.

“So you found the woman who used my sperm?” he said tensely into the device.

I froze.

His gaze lifted.

He was headed straight toward me, eyes locked on mine.",1,1752506402.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

What's happening: The July 1 statutory budget deadline has passed without a budget agreement in  
Lansing and lawmakers remain gridlocked over competing priorities.

 

Why it matters: While the upcoming fiscal year doesn’t begin until Oct. 1 for state and local  
governments, Michigan school districts started their fiscal year July 1 and now face planning  
uncertainty.

* Businesses are also watching closely how programs like the Going PRO Talent Fund — used toupskill workers — will be negotiated.

One key thing: The related debate over road funding continues, with growing momentum behind  
dedicating more resources to infrastructure.

* What we're saying: The MI Chamber believes we need smart solutions to fix our roads, but weoppose the proposal to raise the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) by 40% because it would hurt jobcreators or stall economic growth.

What's next: Negotiations between lawmakers and the Governor are expected to continue through  
July.

* The MI Chamber continues to advocate for a budget that builds workforce strength, supportsinfrastructure and prioritizes transparency and efficiency — without unduly raising business costs.

Dig a hole 3-5 inches deep and “plant” a new pair of 100% cotton underwear. Lay  
the underwear flat so that it has good soil contact.

Mark the spot you planted them, so you don’t forget. Consider planting two pairs

in different areas (garden, crop field, lawn, woods, grassland) to compare results.

Wait at least 8 weeks and dig the underwear up.

Share your results by posting a photo of your “harvest” on social media and tag

the Shiawassee Conservation District. #SCDSoilYourUndiesChallenge. Better yet -

bring your underwear to the District office to show them off.

**#SCDSoilYourUndiesChallenge**

The Soil Your Undies challenge is an experiment to demonstrate soil health.  
Soil is filled with billions of microbes - in fact, just one teaspoon of soil has more  
microbes than there are people on Earth. These microbes break down organic  
matter (like cotton), hold water, resist erosion, and boost nutrient cycling.  
Healthy soil gives us clean air and water, bountiful crops and forests, productive  
grazing lands, diverse wildlife, and beautiful landscapes.  
Healthy soil = healthy life!

Test the activity of the soil microbes in your soil by “planting” cotton underwear.

“Harvest” them after 8 weeks to see the results. The healthier the soil is, the less

underwear will be remaining!

Not all soil can eat yourunderwear, but healthy soil can!

What did you discover?  
How healthy is your soil?

1lzp5ff,https://www.reddit.com/r/OurLifeFanPage/comments/1lzp5ff/our_life_beginnings_always_the_sunofficial_patch/,"Our Life: Beginnings & Always (The ""Sunofficial"" Patch) [Windows]","Five thousand years after I've last posted on here, I'm coming back with something (hopefully) useful!

Something people who only see my content on Reddit don't know is that I've found various things in the game's code, partly thanks to the asks I get on my Tumblr. Such things range from little amusements to events/checks that don't work as intended (example being the funny fact that Cove uses his Studiousness to beat Baxter in rock-paper-scissors, *but* the game is actually checking your *Step 2* Cove's ""stats,"" *not* Step 3's).

I've already modded the game before to put my own scenes/options in, and so I thought I'd release a fanmade patch to the code. GB Patch is deep into working on Now & Forever and I just figured that I'd dust off the original to fill any metaphorical holes I saw.

*(note that this is not a mod that adds much new content to the game besides very basic things like what I put down for* ***Shopping*** *and new conversations with Lee for the moved menus, so it's still in a largely ""pure"" form;* [***my own personal edits/modifications***](https://www.tumblr.com/riding-the-sunset-bird/tagged/type%3A%20script%20editing) *aren't in here, though* [*GB Patch has already stated*](https://gb-patch.tumblr.com/post/677127068257058816) [*their opinion on modding to be positive*](https://gb-patch.tumblr.com/post/750679102160257024)*)*

I have the itch.io Windows version of Our Life and thus that's the version I ""patched,"" though this should work for the Steam version as well.

How to make this work:

* Optionally, clone the entire Our Life folder that the game and its files are in; this is only necessary if you're paranoid/worried about something going wrong, so you can have the original *and* the patched version.
* Unpack the .rpa files in Our Life's ""game"" folder. This can be done in a variety of ways, but I recommend [rpaExtract](https://iwanplays.itch.io/rpaex). Simply drop the .exe into the ""game"" folder of Our Life, then select and drag all the .rpa files (yes, you can do them all at once) onto it; a window will pop up to show you its progress.
* Once the unpacking is complete, delete the .rpa files you just unpacked, then open the game to confirm that it loads up without error.


After that, download the files from [this link here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DVFprASsYWcQIPb-zDIYPP59sEhRsMx5) and replace the original Our Life files with them.

If you don't have certain DLCs, the files in their folders for my patch should be deleted/ignored. For example, not having Derek's DLC means ignoring the files in the folder ""DLC\_Derek"".

I tried to touch on as much as possible, but I may have missed something along the way (whether from my own edits or the original work). I also *do* welcome comments/chat messages pointing out other oddities as well, even as minor as typos, and I'll fix them at my soonest opportunity. The nice thing about having the .rpa files unpacked is that edits to singular moments/scenes only requires redownloading one or two of the script files, so it's easy on one's internet. Whether any issues have cropped up due to having the files unpacked, I'm not sure (nothing happened during playtesting on my end), but I'll deal with as many as I can as they're pointed out to me.

I'll say that replaying the game isn't required for most fixes, though stuff such as [the ](https://riding-the-sunset-bird.tumblr.com/post/785255104687243264)[**Sandcastle**](https://riding-the-sunset-bird.tumblr.com/post/785255104687243264)[ issue](https://riding-the-sunset-bird.tumblr.com/post/785255104687243264) would require playing that moment again, since it's a new variable I had to put in (any save that did the split bill scene prior to having this patch won't meet the requirements to get the split bill proposal anymore).

Finally, the last thing I'll say is that I've split the Changelog into two categories: **Fixes** and **Quality of Life**. Fixes are self-explanatory in that they're things I patched out/adjusted from the original game that appeared to be errors, oversights, or something that just seemed *off* from what was expected, whereas Quality of Life leans towards things I've done for convenience/immersion's sake. You can consider the latter like optional bonuses.

Happy playing\~

# ☆Changelog☆

**⚙Fixes⚙**

* edited the line of Noelani's eyelids in one of her eye expressions to better match the others


**STEP 1**

**Shopping**

* added a check and extra narration during the keychain scene if the MC took the money from Cove in Sandcastle (it varies slightly depending on if they also accepted the money Cliff offered them)


**Sandcastle**

* added variables for if the MC tells Cove about the deal and accepts the money he offers to prevent a false check in Cove's Step 4 proposal, which made it possible for Cove to propose with the split dollar bill despite such a dollar never existing


**STEP 2**

* evened out the values required to get Sporty/Studious Cove
* fixed Cove's blue pajama shirt, which was four pixels too high compared to his purple pajama shirt with the compass on it (you can see this in action if you swap between both shirts in the Step 2 Cove Creator)


**Step 2 Intro**

* removed a check if the MC is crushing on Cove, which sets a variable signifying that the MC can see themselves in a romantic relationship with a boy; the way in which the variable appears again in the orientation/sexuality menus imply that this is different from simply crushing on a boy, and the Step 3 intro doesn't have such a check at all, thus my removal of it
* added dialog so Lee will now comment on if the MC is crushing on Derek instead of Cove or is crushing on both boys at once; according to Derek's DLC, the MC would have known him for a few months by then, so Lee would naturally have known/figured it out by then
* fixed a couple checks in the orientation/sexuality menus (for why this bullet point is here rather than in **Growing**, see the **Quality of Life** section):
* ↳ added checks in the *""you didn't really have a romantic interest in other people,""* *""there was only one person you'd ever had romantic/those kinds of feeling for,""* and *""You weren't interested in guys""* options, since they only checked for the MC's feelings on Cove and not Derek
* ↳ there is now an additional menu for the MC's physical attraction if they're crushing on both Cove and Derek, where they may choose between them; conversely, the *""only one person you'd ever had romantic feelings for""* option will no longer appear if the MC is crushing on both boys
* Kyra will no longer ask the MC about cream in their coffee if they're vegan


**Family**

* fixed the gossip section where Lee talks about Derek, blocking off negative options if the MC is crushing on him; Lee will also not press the MC on how much they like Derek if the player has the Derek DLC (since a crush or lack of one would already be more defined there)


**Dinner**

* fixed a check during the card game scene that caused a Warm-Moderate Cove to not speak up about paying for the MC's round


**Birthday**

* fixed a check during the scene where ice cream and cake is passed around; an MC who is at Fond/Crush with Cove, lactose intolerant, and also vegan would get both branches of dialog+narration where he asks if they have pills but also lament that they can't have anything due to animal products
* fixed a vegan MC being able to ask Cove for a bite of his dessert


**Escapade**

* fixed the onion rings option so it disappears if the MC is vegan; I thought it was intentional at first for vegans to be able to eat them, but it's locked off for MCs in both **Late Shift** and **Baxter's Step 4**


**Responsible**

* moved a reaction a vegan MC has to a question Derek presents about their dietary preferences; it was originally set after Mr. Suarez spoke up, which made it somewhat confusing


**Siblings**

* the game now checks if the MC likes marshmallows or not when deciding whether to remove the ""cereal with marshmallows"" option; originally, it only checked if they were vegan/vegetarian


**STEP 3**

* changed the necessary requirements for Cove's personality for balance, and adjusted the values the previously-fallible Cove Creator buttons gave to match; Moderate Step 3 Cove is now feasible, and being tied in Warm+Cold or Studious+Sporty points no longer defaults to Cold/Studious, returning to the coin flip of old
* fixed initiative variables for MCs that crushed on both Cove and Baxter, causing Baxter's initiative level to be set for Cove as well; the variables in Baxter's moments have been adjusted to compensate for the oversight
* cleaned/touched/fixed up Baxter's sprites (most notably his khaki shirt shifting colors when he has a bag, his swimming trunks not being complete when he takes his shirt off, a smudge of white underneath his hiking bag, and a pixel of his unshaded skin color on his shaded upper arm)


**Step 3 Intro**

* added a missing ""'s"" in Baxter's introductory dialog
* copied over a variable confirming that the MC wants to have dance lessons with Baxter in an option that should've had it (considering where it's relevant)
* carried over a variable for the MC's best friend status with Cove in Step 2, as well as if the MC chooses options during the Step 3 intro (if not dating Cove) that state he's their best friend; the lack of this prevented dialog from playing on poppy hill in the Step 3 ending where Cove would call the MC his ""best friend in the entire world"" (if they're not in a relationship and not on Indifferent with him) due to the game never setting the variable in the first place
* added a setting if the MC's hobbies didn't change from when they were younger, allowing their athletic points from Step 2 to carry over into Step 3
* fixed checks in the orientation/sexuality menus (as with the **Step 2 Intro**, see the **Quality of Life** section for why this is here instead of **Talks**):
* ↳ as in Step 2, the game will now check for the MC's attraction to Derek instead of only checking their attraction to Cove; however, this time it will ignore a crush on Derek if the MC has fallen out of contact with him
* ↳ fixed a missing check; in the original **Growing** orientation/sexuality menu, the game wouldn't ask for the MC's feelings on genders if they were both asexual and aromantic (for obvious reasons), but it neglects to do that in Step 3's version
* blocked off certain negative options for Baxter if the player has the Baxter DLC and chose Fond/Crush for him


**Hang (Cove's Version)**

* fixed a check where Cove would call the MC his best friend even if they're not; I added narration for this since otherwise they were either his best friend or simply his neighbor with no in-between
* adjusted dialog/narration so Miranda will ask about vegan options for the MC if the MC is on Indifferent with Cove; this seemed more in line with what happens in **Birthday**, where Cove would only comment on the MC's veganism/lactose intolerance on Fond/Crush
* fixed options that would normally set Step 4 Cove's pants, but don't due to old/scrapped variables being used instead; this caused any Cove not made using the Cove Creator to have the tan shorts with polka dot trim


**Errands**

* fixed variables that mixed up giving Cove studious/sporty points depending on what the MC offered/asked him to do; offering to carry his bags (+1 studious because they're encouraging him not to be active) and asking for a piggyback ride (+1 sporty since it's a physical task) worked as intended, but asking him to carry their things gave +1 studious whereas offering a piggyback ride gave +1 sporty


**Late Shift**

* fixed some missing checks in the fast food menu, such as jalapeno poppers still being available for vegans


**Boating**

* fixed arm wrestling with Baxter to properly account for the player's chosen version of Hang and check their athletic points if they've not yet played either; while I was at it, I also enabled non-muscular MCs to win with enough athletic points
* fixed a check that was looking at Step 2 Cove's sporty/studious values instead of Step 3's during the arm wrestling contest, as well as when he plays rock-paper-scissors against Baxter


**Sightseeing**

* removed a duplicate word in one of the MC's optional pieces of dialog
* added missing words in a couple lines of narration
* switched a word to singular rather than plural
* added an option during the ""first crush"" conversation to account for the possibility that the MC met and began crushing on Baxter in Soiree but started crushing on Cove by Step 3; the game initially prevented the MC from saying that they crushed on Baxter first so long as they're crushing on Cove in Step 3, even if the timeline with Soiree wouldn't line up with it
* fixed the menu when the MC decides to date Baxter that checked the MC as being okay telling people about their relationship or not; the option to shrug implied the variable it had set originally, but Baxter's response implied the opposite and followed up with contradictory dialog, so I kept the variable but moved Baxter's response to a new option


**Hang (Baxter's Version)**

* removed unnecessary word
* adjusted the dessert options since it previously didn't check for vegan MCs
* fixed a voice line of Baxter's that didn't play due to the audio in question being empty; I changed it to a different take of the intended line
* fixed a check that looked at Step 2 Cove's values instead of Step 3's when the MC is choosing to live commentate on what's happening with the sprinklers
* adjusted narration/dialog in case the MC wants to try everyone's desserts but is vegan, as originally they would try Miranda's non-vegan dessert of the chocolate-dipped ice cream cone; this also means that such an MC is (unfortunately) locked out from trying Baxter's since the ice cream sandwich and cartoon face popsicle are both creamy


**Drinks**

* adjusted checks for the menus at the cafe for dietary preferences (such as excluding the lunch meat sandwich for pescatarian MCs and making it so the waitress no longer asks vegan MCs if they want cream in their tea/coffee)
* excluded citrus sunshine mocktails for vegan MCs since they tend to be sweetened with honey


**Mountain**

* fixed the food menu, which initially only checked for a vegan or vegetarian MC


**Planning**

* added an ""'s"" where one was previously missing
* as in Hang, fixed a voice line of Baxter's that didn't play by changing it to a different take
* fixed an incorrect variable when the MC recalls their day of party planning; originally, it checked for a kiss in Planning in general rather than the ""non-dating"" kiss specifically
* added a space after a period where one was previously missing


**STEP 4**

* as in Step 3, fixed the Cove Creator buttons, returned the coin flip in case of a tie, and rebalanced the point system
* fixed Cove's smaller blush not being properly blocked off by his nose
* cleaned/touched/fixed up parts of Baxter's sprites (notably one of his eye expressions having the shadow bleeding into his hair, the belt buckle being partly-transparent on his normal sprite, said sprite and the one with the purple shirt but no blazer not being consistent around his waist area, some of his skin being shaded the wrong color on both of his brown suit sprites, and his reception and brown outfits in general)
* fixed options that didn't set the variables they should've; this caused skipped narration when the MC spots Cove at the open window (in his Step 4) for any MC that did not see him as family nor was in a relationship with him


**Cove's Step 4**

* adjusted the check when Cove proposes to the MC to properly account for the potential split dollar variable
* fixed multiple instances of height-related narration (along with the ability to give Cove a piggyback ride) not playing properly due to checking for height variables that were never set; the game now checks for the ones from Step 3
* adjusted a check for the MC to say *""Here we go again…""* when Cove jokes about who gets the single bed; it originally checked only for the MC and Cove to be dating in Step 3 (which can still miss out on bed sharing disagreement scenes), but now checks to see if the MC did not want/tried to share/offered to give Cove the bed in Drive, or spent the night with him in the Step 3 ending but didn't share the bed, regardless of relationship status (basically, any scenario where there was a bed that they didn't share)
* moved a variable that made certain narration (exclusive to MCs who had a plan to propose, tried to do so, then backed out) inaccessible, and added in a missing variable for the MC cancelling the proposal they'd planned


**Cove's Wedding DLC**

* fixed a check that prevented toned and buff MCs from scooping Cove into their arms (unless they were also tall) due to checking for an unused variable instead
* as in Cove's Step 4, fixed height-related narration not playing due to checking for unused height variables rather than Step 3's
* fixed how the game defines Baxter's hair as ""dark gray"" instead of ""black"" (it's meant to still be dyed)
* fixed a check when the MC leaves the decision on the catering up to Cove; the dev notes imply that the game should check on whether the MC is lactose intolerant or not yet doesn't, so I adjusted it to check for the new variable of if a lactose intolerant MC avoids lactose (see the **Quality of Life** section)


**Derek's Step 4**

* removed a variable that would be incorrectly set for MCs who were short in Step 2 but average height in Step 3, giving the option for them to say that they were taller than Derek when they're not
* fixed a check that prevented muscular MCs from throwing Derek over their shoulder at the waterpark due to using an unused variable (MCs who were tall or tall in addition to being muscular were allowed)


**Baxter's Step 4**

* added a missing word in a line of narration
* added an ""'s"" where one was previously missing
* fixed the food menu at the bowling alley to check for pollotarian MCs
* Miranda will no longer offer a vegan MC nachos (which are already excluded from the food menu for them) if they chose to order nothing
* swapped the checks after Baxter finishes using the stencil; before, he would improperly give the MC credit for the guideline if the MC didn't involve themselves, and give *both of them* credit otherwise
* fixed variables for MCs where a line of narration (exclusive to romancing Baxter) was completely inaccessible due to the game checking for the MC being upset with Baxter, which is impossible due to the block the line it's in requiring the MC to *not* be upset with Baxter; I changed them to initiative checks instead
* copied over a missing variable that prevented Baxter from properly thanking a Nervous MC who complimented him on his ""shorts""
* fixed a line of narration for pollotarian MCs that would improperly list most of the food as ""pescatarian""
* fixed a check in Baxter's intimacy scene with the MC if the MC wears both skirts and dresses according to their character creation, then takes their dress off; this could cause Baxter to slide his hand under the hem of their skirt even if they were just established to have been wearing a dress
* fixed the food menu to better match the one in Drinks since it's the same cafe; for example, Drinks prevented vegan MCs from ordering pastries whereas Baxter's Step 4 didn't
* adjusted the drink menu to knock off the citrus sunshine mocktail for vegan MCs, as in Drinks
* added a missing word to a line of Jude's dialog


**❁Quality of Life❁**

**STEP 1**

**Step 1 Intro**

* moved the confirmation for lactose intolerant MCs from **Barbecue** to here, as well as added a menu for if the MC takes medicine or avoids lactose completely; this makes it so a player doesn't need the Step 1 DLC in order to have a lactose intolerant MC, and the latter option mentioned removes lactose options from future menus
* ↳ for avoiding lactose, I looked through all food/drink menus and adjusted as best as I could to account for this, since it wasn't a thing before; moments that had their menus adjusted include **Shopping**, **Barbecue**, the **Step 2 Intro**, **Growing**, **Escapade**, **Boardwalk**, **Late Shift**, **Hang (Baxter's Version)**, **Drinks**, **Mountain**, and **Baxter's Step 4**; moments overall that have had added/edited narration to account for this include **Shopping**, **Long Day**, **Fireflies**, **Library**, **Barbecue**, **Mall**, **Birthday**, **Responsible**, the **Step 3 Intro**, **Hang (Cove's Version)**, **Hang (Baxter's Version)**, **Planning**, and **Baxter's Step 4**
* added the other two bracelets (beach-themed and candy) back in, which are seen during the mini CG in **Fireflies**


**Long Day**

* edited narration for if the MC took Cliff's money, took the money in Sandcastle if they told Cove about the deal, or both


**STEP 2**

**Step 2 Intro**

* added a menu for a lactose intolerant MC so they can decide if they still avoid/no longer avoid lactose
* moved the orientation options from Growing to the call with Lee, meaning the player is no longer forced to play Growing in order to set their Step 2 orientation; I've added additional dialog to fit it
* ↳ *(I didn't delete any dialog/narration for this, so you're really just getting more Lee content)*


**Growing**

* adjusted the narration to compensate for the ""missing"" orientation menus (Cove will still ask the MC about it, it's just that the MC doesn't decide during **Growing** what their orientation is)


**Mall**

* added minor narration for reassuring vegan MCs when they approach the smoothie kiosk


**Birthday**

* adjusted some of Cove's dialog when he asks the MC for their leftovers, depending on if the MC chose to eat some of the dessert or none of it


**STEP 3**

**Step 3 Intro**

* continued the menu from the Step 2 Intro where the MC can choose whether they still avoid lactose or take medicine for it
* moved the orientation menus in Talks to the call with Lee here, meaning the player is no longer forced to play **Talks** in order to set their orientation (they can still talk to Cove about it in **Talks**, the menus are just moved to here instead)
* ↳ this also means that Baxter has unintentionally been appointed Specialest Bean™ because he's met after the call with Lee, so if the MC was initially uninterested in boys but crushes on him, then they can ""realize"" that Baxter is an exception to the rule; I added minor narration for this as well as narration if the MC originally only had interest - physically or romantically - to Cove/Derek
* ↳ (as with Step 2, I didn't remove any dialog/narration, unless one counts the copy-pasted option that just replaced Cove's name with Baxter's if the MC was dating Baxter; it obviously wouldn't fit this early, but he gets his own menus in exchange)


**Errands**

* made the requirements for the MC to piggyback Cove more difficult *~~(listen, my tiny scrawny MC could do it if I'd just played Charity beforehand and it felt like a crime)~~*


**Boating**

* removed pointless checks during Cove's arm wrestling match and rebalanced it so non-muscular MCs can still beat him with enough athletic points (it was originally an automatic loss)


**Sightseeing**

* balanced the check for whether the MC can lift the heavy bowling ball or not; originally, they could automatically do so if they hadn't played either version of Hang, but now it requires the MC to pass an athletic point check if they've played/not played **Hang** and aren't muscular


**Hang (Baxter's Version)**

* added narration for a vegan MC when Miranda and Terry are debating on ice cream


**STEP 4**

**Cove's Step 4**

* added narration where Cove will be referred to as ""the object of your affections Cove Holden"" if the MC is crushing on him but not in a relationship with him; as stated above, narration at all would've been skipped regardless, but even if it wasn't, it would've defaulted to simply ""friend"" due to a menu that the player never gets if their MC is crushing on Cove even if not dating him
* balanced whether the MC can give Cove a piggyback ride to take into consideration if he's buff (thus heavier) or not, meaning it's possible for tall MCs to not be strong enough to give him one (unlike in **Errands**)


**Baxter's Step 4**

* lactose intolerant MCs (whether they take pills or avoid lactose) can now receive the ""special muffin"" that vegan MCs would
* refined checks for whether or not the MC can get the suggestive narration with Baxter

I don't host, which is proving to be a barrier with anyone else who is ENM themselves, so I'm finding that I'm having more success with single women than ENM/Poly partnered women. Tips?

  
**Non-app** places to meet ENM people - where/what do people do to meet ENM folk outside of apps these days? My partner and I are wanting to explore this separately, not together, so clubs etc aren't really an option as a 'single' guy.

Not as innocent as I look. Petition for Feeld to add a review section.  
  
I like being with friends over a coffee or a drink, looking at vestiges of colonial-imperialist architecture, a book in the park. Don’t smoke.

Sir,

I regret to inform you that I have accidentally broken time again.

Some asshole had been speed-running their midlife crisis and created a temporal feedback loop in Sublayer 12 (Lifetime developmental arc). Standard procedure, right? Just recalibrate the circadian rhythms and reset the hormonal cascade.

But here's where it gets weird. I was using the new Quantum Time Wrench™ (you know, the one from the Planck-scale toolkit) when I accidentally cross-threaded the Narrative Time Layer (Layer 5) with the Cultural Time Layer (Layer 6).

Now every Tuesday is simultaneously the Renaissance AND the apocalypse. The coffee machine keeps dispensing mead, and Karen from accounting won't stop speaking in iambic pentameter about her quarterly reports. Also, everyone's wearing those weird ruffled collars but they're made of recycled plastic because we're apparently also in a post-climate-disaster future.

The Psychological Time Layer (Layer 4) is completely fucked. People are experiencing their childhood trauma in real-time while simultaneously having their mid-life crisis and retirement anxiety. Bob from Security is currently 8 years old, 45, and 73 simultaneously. He's both crying about his lost teddy bear and complaining about his 401k.

I tried to fix it by adjusting the Relativistic Time Layer (Layer 7), but that just made everything worse. Now the break room exists in a gravitational time dilation field where lunch break lasts 6 months but also negative 3 seconds. The sandwich I made this morning is both perfectly fresh and archaeologically significant.

The Cosmic Time Layer (Layer 8) is sending me passive-aggressive notifications about entropy violations. Apparently, I've caused the heat death of the universe to happen next Thursday, but also never, but also it already happened last Tuesday (the Renaissance apocalypse one).

And don't even get me started on the Recursive Time Layer (Layer 9). It's become self-aware and keeps leaving me sticky notes that say things like ""Remember when you broke time? That's now. Also then. Also always."" It's developed a personality and I think it's depressed.

The 13 Temporal Pillars are completely out of alignment. Continuity is on strike, Irreversibility is working backwards, Simultaneity is arguing with itself, and Birth/Death has submitted a transfer request to the Spatial Dimensions Department.

I've tried turning it off and on again, but ""off"" apparently means ""primordial void"" and ""on"" means ""everything that has ever happened occurring at once in the supply closet.""

The worst part? The Atomic Time Layer (Layer 2) is still working perfectly, so all the clocks are running normally while reality is having a complete breakdown. It's like watching the Titanic sink while your wristwatch keeps perfect time.

I'm currently writing this report from 17 different time periods simultaneously. My past self is really disappointed in me, my present self is having an existential crisis, and my future self apparently becomes a time-traveling insurance adjuster who specializes in causality claims.

Please advise. Also, could you approve my request for hazard pay? I think I accidentally created a temporal union and they're demanding better working conditions across all possible timelines.

Attached:

* 47 complaint forms from various versions of myself
* A bill from the Cosmic Time Layer for entropy damage
* A love letter from the Recursive Time Layer (it's... complicated)
* One (1) Renaissance apocalypse turkey leg (still warm)

Current Status: All of time is broken, but at least it's Tuesday



**DIRECTOR'S RESPONSE:**

Jerry,

1lzozb6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lzozb6,Waldorf Seychelles Review,"We recently returned from our South African and Seychelles vacation. In Seychelles we stayed at Mango Houe, Waldorf Astoria Seychelles and Cheval Blanc Seychelles. All three were wonderful with real soul and vibe...WA and CB were amazing and be worth combining. MH was our first night and truly better than expected...the best value proposition.

This review is of Waldorf. 

Arrival and departure:
WA treated us with white gloves. On arrival we were taken to their private lounge...shower, snacks and great view of the runway. Personally walked us to ticketing and luggage drop. On arrival to their price runway on the island, we were greeted by a team with towels, drinks and introduced to our butler. On departure, the management, our butler were there to say goodbye. We Never touched our luggage.

Rooms:
We got the Grand Hawksbill Pool Villa (two levels above the entry Villa). This is technically a one bedroom plus a second ""nanny"" bedroom...comes with its own full bathroom (best deal as it's really two bedrooms)and perfect for our daughter. The hard product is exceptional. No cracks, cheap items and carries an island vibe that feels very upscale while grounded in the culture. It's a different feel from the Maldives property but both beautiful. 
The high quality sun hats and beach bags were free for us to take home. Nice gesture that few high end places do...that is smart marketing...keep the quality high, make it something we'll actually use and get free publicity. Along with that we each got luggage tag gifts.
The entire back is glass walls that can open onto a massive deck with a private infinity pool overlooking a large private back yard. This in turn leads to a private pathway through trees and vegetation to your private beach and ocean.

Hard product:
Like the rooms, very impressive. They have massive public infinity tiered pools, tennis, volleyball, beautiful very nice spa, a sanctuary for turtles (they're huge) and an upper deck bar overlooking the pier. We enjoyed dancing to the DJ spinning our favorite tunes or night...the DJ was supposed to be done by 9pm but as we only came at 8:50 stayed and spinner tunes till we left after 10pm...we were only ones there (thankfully too as I know I was embarrassing myself). No questions and fully at our service with big smiles and danced with us...a classic example of the level of service.
Now the downside is it's not the best beach island...most places have small crabs and some seaweed. However, it's a good place to enjoy walks and their supplies bikes to each room were high quality and fun.

Food:
Overall great. The dinners were exceptional especially at their oriental restaurant. Lunches were delicious and while the breakfast was great quality the options were not as varied if you stay several days. Overall very impressed with the variety and quality of the food given they on an island. They do grow their own vegetables and you will see their farm. Very good food but prices to match.

Service:
This is where WA has really proved themselves to us over the recent years (especially their newer properties). They have consistently been on the top tier. Easily the best service out of all resorts we stayed on this trip.
Everyone knew our names on by the first day. 
Butler, she was exceptional...showed us around, was always the one to take us anywhere even in the evenings (only twice did she have someone else pick us up and apologized in advance via WhatsApp), came and found us at least once a day to make sure we were good...even though we had her on WhatsApp (this was when we were at lunch, or out and about). Another example: My wife tripped after a sunrise yoga class on the pier...her cell went into water. The instructor jumped into the ocean and retrieved it. Later, wife noticed she had a scratch  and I asked if they had a certain ointment. They didn't. The nurse then went home got it and came back with her own personal one accompanied by our butler. We later got three plates of goodies and champagne when we returned from dinner that night.
Their coffee shop person(I'm hopeless in names...where is my better half!) was so personable and made drinks for off menu every time we met him.
Lastly, (am I really writing this much?) we were going to CB once we landed back in Mahe. CB quoted us some crazy transfer price. I asked our butler what she could do. She came through...private car and driver (at 1/5 CB price). We paid driver directly. But not done yet...when we arrived at Mahe airport after WA, there were two WA employees who waited for us, got our bags, and escorted us to the private car. Again, small things like these make a resort...as we left in the car to CB, all we could think of was WA.",9,1752505875.0,chubbytravel,4,1.0,False

I have a quick question and I’d love your thoughts.

I’ve been chatting with a guy for a little over a week now. He was traveling recently, so our communication was a bit limited, but now he’s back in his hometown. He lives about an hour away from me.

Whenever we talk, the conversations are nice and I enjoy them a lot. I’m curious to meet him in person, but I get the feeling he’s a bit slow or careful in his approach.

So here’s my question, especially for the men in this sub:

Do you like it when a girl makes the first move? I was thinking about telling him when he’s in my city, we could grab a coffee. Or should I just wait for him to take the initiative?

1lzovsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1lzovsj/does_bonsenkitchen_cm3302_single_serve_coffee/,Does Bonsenkitchen CM3302 Single Serve Coffee Maker Deliver Great Brews? Full Review,"**Compact Design That Fits Anywhere**

The Bonsenkitchen CM3302 Single Serve Coffee Maker truly excels in its design. I have a small kitchen, and counter space is always a premium commodity, so the fact that this machine measures just 9.09"" x 4.65"" x 11.1"" felt like an instant win. It fits snugly in a corner without looking out of place. Plus, the sleek silver finish gives it a modern touch that complements the rest of my appliances. It's also lightweight, so I’ve been able to move it around the house pretty easily—even packing it for an overnight work trip wasn’t an issue. During weekends when I set up a mini coffee station in the living room, this machine blends in so well that a neighbor visiting for some company barely noticed it was there.

**Ease of Use Makes Morning Coffee a Breeze**

Operating this coffee maker is as straightforward as it gets, which is perfect for someone barely functional before their first cup of coffee. You literally just pop in a K-Cup pod, press one button, and voilà—your coffee is ready in about 3 minutes. The first time I tried it, I doubted the “one-touch” claim, thinking there would be hidden steps. Thankfully, no gimmicks. On groggy mornings, when my brain can’t handle complicated machines, this brewer saves me a ridiculous amount of frustration.

[Check Bonsenkitchen CM3302 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0d73979bx/)

**Strength Control for Your Perfect Cup**

One feature I appreciated is the strength control option. The water reservoir lets you adjust between 6oz and 14oz, and this, in turn, affects how bold or light your brew turns out. My personal sweet spot has been 10oz, with just the right balance of boldness to kick off my day. On the weekends, I usually opt for 14oz because, well, more coffee equals more happiness. My younger sister, who prefers weaker coffee, visited last week and used the 8oz setting, swearing the taste was still great despite being significantly milder. It genuinely accommodates a range of preferences.

**Good Points**

- Compact, portable design fits minimal counter space.
- One-touch simplicity for effortless operation.
- Strength adjustability ensures personalized coffee taste.
- Quick brewing delivers coffee in under three minutes.

**Cleaning Won't Drive You Nuts**

Let me just say, I’ve had machines in the past that were absolute nightmares to clean. This one, however, surprised me. The water tank and drip tray are both removable and dishwasher-safe. My forgetful self doesn’t always think to clean appliances regularly, meaning previous machines would end up stained and smelly—gross, I know. With this coffee maker, the ease of cleaning has definitely helped me keep everything in check. Plus, regular cleaning seems to genuinely elevate the coffee’s taste, which is a nice bonus!

**Negatives**

- The water reservoir isn't large enough for multiple cups in quick succession.
- No automatic shutoff feature, which could have been handy for forgetful users.
- While functional, the machine is slightly noisy as it brews.

**Durability and Safety First**

It’s constructed using BPA-free materials, which immediately eliminated my safety concerns. The build feels solid for its size, and it doesn’t give you that flimsy plastic vibe. Being ETL-certified and adhering to UL standards didn’t go unnoticed either—it’s small details like these that helped establish trust in this product for me. I’m confident this machine will last for a while, even with daily use.

**Competitive Options**

When I compared this machine to rival models like the Keurig K-Mini, it became clear that portability and compactness gave the Bonsenkitchen coffee maker a slight edge. While the Keurig offers similar brewing times, it doesn’t save as much counter space. On the other hand, Nespresso machines blow both out of the water on espresso quality, but they lack compatibility with standard K-Cups, so they’re pricier to maintain. The closest substitute was the Hamilton Beach Flexbrew, but its cleaning process is more tedious. For balancing versatility, price, and size, this product stands out quite well.

**Cost Efficiency**

Considering its features versus competitors, this coffee maker delivers fantastic value for its price range. It’s not feature-bloated but focuses instead on quality essentials like fast brewing, space efficiency, and ease of use. Any coffee machine can make your daily brew, but this one fits especially well into cases where both budget and real estate are tight. If you brew one or two cups daily, the cost-performance ratio leans heavily in your favor.

I'm a Lifetime Platinum and regular Disney World tourist, and my spouse is a Disney fanatic, so we stay regularly at Disney's properties.  Recently, we celebrated our 25th anniversary, and I surprised my wife with a long weekend at Disney. I booked the Swan Reserve hotel on points.  After following this subreddit and experiencing some less-than-stellar hotel stays over the last few months, I was not expecting an amazing stay.  But the Autograph Swan Reserve resort hotel at Walt Disney World made me believe again that you can stay at a Marriott-branded hotel and have an exceptional experience.  

Here's the whole story.  So I booked 2 nights at the Swan Reserve a week before the stay. I chose a standard room with 2 Queens.  We arrived on-site before lunchtime at the hotel and were warmly greeted by staff upon entry. The hotel lobby is bright and relatively calm compared to other Disney resort hotels.  Upon check in, I asked with no expectations, for an upgrade and was pleasantly surprised with a Signature Suite room that was available immediately, the desk agent was absolutely one the nicest desk staff I have encountered at a Marriott Hotel, he was positive, asked politely if we were here for a special occasion to which I mentioned that I was surprising my wife for our 25th.  He took the time to explain how we could use the resort fees for services at the resort and neighboring Swan / Dolphin resorts as well.  He also explained that a hotel is made up of a large number of suites. 

Upon entering the suite, I was pleased to find a large living room/dining room area with floor-to-ceiling windows with a pool view. The room was spotless, the bathroom had a full shower and a toilet/sink that could be made private from the rest of the bathroom.  The room was spacious and bright, the suite had 2 independent HVAC controls that were capable of lowering the temperature down to 65F, which was exactly what any hotel in the US should be capable of.  

We partook of the complimentary Buffet breakfast at Amare for Platinum members, which covers a continental breakfast.  Our server explained that the restaurant offers a hot breakfast upgrade for $15 / person, which was very affordable for the full buffet, which included an omelet or fried egg offering.  The buffet had a wide assortment of offerings, all well prepared, similar to other high-performing Marriotts, but some of the offerings at Amare were just a little better themed to Amare's Mediterranean style.   The service at the restaurant was impeccable, the servers were polite, fast, and went the extra mile.  Upon our second morning, the server not only greeted us by name, but remembered our preferences for beverages and condiments, which was a high-quality touch of class from the restaurant.  

At the end of the first day of stay, we returned after 10 pm, and the coffee/snack shop had closed for the day. I inquired with the concierge who was still staffing the desk if there were any onsite services where I could purchase a soda.  The concierge said there was not, but offered to go to the snack shop and retrieve two cold sodas and bill them to our room, which was another example of just going the extra mile for guests. Marriott-branded

The best part of the experience was the second night returning from our theme park activities, we were surprised to find a complimentary bottle of Champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries along with a hand-decorated card congratulating us from the Ambassador Welcome team at the resort.  This extra was the chef's kiss on an amazing trip (Disney also went the extra mile in their customer service, but that's for another subreddit)

I want to convey that most Marriott branded hotels do a decent job and provide solid service, the majority of the time I stay.  However, when a location like this achieves this level of high-quality service, it needs to be called out and promoted.  This is what all mid-range and better Marriott-affiliated hotels and resorts should strive for in their properties, services, and customer care.  ",12,1752505572.0,marriott,3,0.88,False

Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED)
That's what the therapist said.
It sounded like a bad bomb joke.

Mandi couldn't always control her temper. Apparently there was a reason for that, but whatever. Having a diagnosis doesn't make dealing with it any easier.

It starts small. It always does with her, it just never stays that way. A scratchy sweater, a loud talker, sideways glances, crowded rooms, too much cologne, too little bathing. It didn't matter what the trigger was, just the results.
This time, it was a blonde across from her at the table in the study hall. She wasn't doing anything, really. She's just sitting there chewing gum and tapping her pen while she studies and takes notes.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Mandi presses her thumbnail into the meat of her palm. It doesn't ground her like she was hoping for, so the pencil and coffee cup become her lifelines. She breathes in through her nose like her therapist taught her — big, slow, and grounding. Count your senses. Name the colors. Smell the fucking coffee. Something! But the sound cuts through it all. The university always had too many people packed into these rooms.

Tap, chew, smack, pop, tap, chew, smack, tap.

She tries to focus on her notes, but the words are bleeding into each other like wet ink. Her jaw is tight, her shoulders are tighter. Her chest feels like there is an elephant sitting on it. It's like listening to a shitty song on repeat.

Tap, chew, pop, tap, smack, tap, chew, tap.

It’s stupid. She knows it’s stupid. Normal people don’t lose their minds over a pen.
It's just so hard to ignore the way her mind keeps begging to make it stop. Deep breath in, deep breath out. Her lungs begin to burn from the strain of trying to keep calm, measured breaths.

Tap.

Today’s been too long. The air is too stale. When was the last time someone had opened a fucking window? The lights are too bright. The new detergent is too itchy, the class is too loud, the people are too close.
Make it stop.

Tap, tap, tap, tap.

She's so, so tired of pretending it doesn’t bother her. Mandi tries to breathe through the building storm. Her skin feels tight, and her nerves are raw. Frayed at the edges like a poorly cut string.
Make it stop.

Tap.

She visibly flinches, her brain is in a meat grinder. She feels the heat crawl up her neck like a fever. Her face is burning, and she knows she's blushing. Her ears feel hot, and her lungs burn from the strain of controlled breathing exercises.

“Sorry,” the girl at the table mutters, barely looking up. She doesn’t stop. If anything, she actually speeds up that infernal tapping as she loudly pops at the gum in her mouth. Her brows furrow in concentration. To Mandi, this girl is concentrated evil. 

Tap. Pop. Smack. Tap. Chew. Pop. Smack. Tap

It's like a bad mixtape playing over a food processor. Please, God, make it stop.

Mandi swallows the apology already trying to claw its way up her throat. Why is she always the one apologizing when it’s someone else who pushed her? When it’s someone else popping their gum, or jiggling their leg, or standing too close in line, or whispering just loud enough to sound like they’re talking about her.

Tap. Chew, smack, pop, tap.

“Can you not?” she snaps, her voice sharper than she intended. The girl looks up and blinks at her in confusion. She laughs nervously like Mandi’s the weird one.

Mandi’s stomach flips. Her fingers are ice, and she can feel the body shakes starting. Beads of sweat trickle in her hairline, causing her irritation to raise another tick.

“It’s just a pen,” the girl scoffs. Rolling her eyes and laughing with the boy next to her.

Something inside her cracks.

She stands too fast. The chair legs screech like a dying rabbit. Heads turn fast enough to cause whiplash. Shame flares with the heat, but it’s too late. Her arms are shaking. She slams her hands on the table in front Blonde Bitch. Her whole body is vibrating, she doesn’t even know what she wants to do. Throw something? Scream? Cry? Crawl out of her own body and disappear?

Blissful silence.

Everyone’s looking at them now. The attention stifles the reprieve. Mandi's chest aches, her limbs are trembling, and her lungs continue to burn. Tears sting the back of her eyes and nose, clogging her throat.
Breathe in, breathe out.

""Fucking Hell,"" someone mutters. “What’s her problem?”

That’s the part that stings most. Not the noise. Not the tapping. Not even the rising tide in her chest that threatens to suffocate her.

It’s the fact that no one ever sees it building up. They only ever see the explosion.

Only the mess.

Once again, she’s the villain in a story she didn’t mean to write. Alone fighting a battle she never asked for.
Before she can explode, another set of hands join her on the table. Both girls look up to find the most intense grey eyes bouncing between them. When they land on Mandi, her breath catches in her throat. All of the rage filling her veins like thick poison evaporates. She honestly can't even tell you why she was mad just now. She takes a deep, fortifying breath. His eyes take her in slowly. Striped shirt, nice skirt, black hair, black bag. High socks up her legs, studded combat boots. She's got chains on her neck, and damn does she make it work.


He turns his attention to Miss Little Pen Tapper. His voice comes out deep enough to rattle Mandi's bones. ""She obviously finds it annoying. She's also not the only one. You've sat here smacking like a cow chewing its cud and tapping that fucking pen for an hour now. This is a three hour study session.""
He leans over her now, stooping into her space. The boy next to her leans back, offering no protection. ""Enough.""

Bubble Gum Bitch pales and swallows her gum. She sets her pen on her notebook and doesn't touch it again. He stands upright, satisfied with her fear, and turns to Mandi. His eyes soften as he meets her eyes. 

""Grab your stuff, we're leaving.""
She doesn't hesitate. She scoops everything into her pack with speed and efficiency. It's not her first time fleeing a scene, so her system is flawless. In less than ten seconds, all of her books and papers are packed. She looks up to see him watching her. The heat comes back, creeping slowly up her neck and to her ears. He watches it spread. Mandi can't help but notice there is no rage accompanied by it this time; strange.

He reaches out and gently takes her pack from her, hefting it over his shoulder and jerking his head towards the door. They're out of there quickly, making a beeline for the parking lot as soon as the building sets them free.
Someone saw the storm. He saw her.

--

Devon knew this girl was going to lose it. He could see it in the way her shoulders sat too rigid. Her grip was so hard on her pencil that you could see it bending in her fist. 
Her other hand clutched her coffee cup, and he wondered if the cup would implode from the pressure. That blonde bimbo was over there smacking away on her gum and tapping that mother fucking pen. Poor Mandi. 

He had watched her flatten a boy's face with a metal lunch tray in freshman year. Right in the middle of the cafeteria, too. She had to be pulled off of him by campus security. The student body didn't really know what started the altercation, but the rumor was he had touched her. It had effectively made her a pariah to many. Some thought he died from the injuries, and they often wondered aloud why she wasn't in prison. 

All Devon could say was good riddance. He had watched the perve lower his phone beneath her ass and snap a picture. The dumbass had left the flash on, causing Mandi to turn around. She caught him red handed. However, Devon hadn't expected her to take the tray she was holding and smash it into his face. The first hit busted his nose wide open, the second crushed his eye socket, the third knocked him down flat onto his back. She straddled his lap and brought that tray down again and again. He had stopped fighting by the fifth time, and nobody at school ever saw him again. To Devon, it was the hottest thing he'd ever seen.

""Can you not?"" 

Her voice carried across the room. Oh shit. He stood and began to cross the room. He caught the blonde rolling her eyes, and he picked up the pace. Mandi slammed her hands on the table and stood so fast that her chair screeched.
Move. Move. Move!
She was literally vibrating. The poor girl was shaking so damn bad trying to maintain control. Devon leans onto the table, mirroring Mandi. They both look up at him in unison. When his eyes meet hers, he swears his heart skips a beat. The most beautiful eyes he had ever seen stared back at him. Absolutely breathtaking..

He turned his attention back to the Bubble Gum Bitch. He warned her in his low and dominating tone, then got into her space for good measure. Once it was apparent that his message had been received, he stood and gave his attention back to the dark haired beauty before him. He used the same tone, telling to grab her things. She immediately obeyed. Seemingly thankful for the excuse to run. When she looks back up, catching him watching her, she blushes so beautifully. 

He tentatively reaches out and grabs her pack from her. No crushed face, good sign so far. 
They escape into the fresh autumn air outside and go straight for the parking lot. He slows down and turns towards her. The sunlight catching on her big cornflower blue eyes. Her dark hair was impossibly long and had gorgeous natural Irish waves. She came up to his chest, just barely clearing his pecs.
""Are you okay?"" He asks her softly.

--

Mandi looks up into those striking grey eyes. The overwhelming calm she experiences around him has her filled with concern. There are still traffic sounds, boisterous students hanging out around their cars, and the constant background noise that makes up West Campus. It just didn't scream at her nerves and pull apart her sanity like usual. The peace was so unusual, that she didn't know how to answer his question. 

""I-I'm not sure, honestly.""

He gave her a small smile, nodding his head. ""That's okay too.""

She looked around, realizing her car was two lots over.  She peered back up at him, squinting one eye against the sun. 
""Would you like to walk with me to my car? I'd like to enjoy the calm for a while.""

He smiled, and it was radiant. She had never seen eyes like his, either. This deep, stormy ocean grey that just sucked you under and held you there. His quiet calm was like being surrounded by cool water, drowning out the world around her. Mandi didn't know if she could survive without it now that she'd had a taste. 

The walk was quiet.

Not awkwardly so—just still. Like the world had been muted for her sake. For them.

Mandi’s boots clicked softly against the pavement as they stepped from the edge of the main parking lot toward the quieter overflow area. Each step stirred a swirl of leaves, crisp and dry beneath their feet, but even the crunch of Autumn seemed muffled. A subtle hush had fallen around them, made softer still by the snowfall that had started without warning.

Big, slow flakes drifted lazily from the grey-lavender sky, too fat and fluffy for October. She tilted her head slightly, watching one land in the crook of Devon’s dark hair. It stayed there, a single flash of white against the sable strands, and something about it made her throat tighten.

“Early for snow,” she murmured, breath ghosting in the chilled air.

Devon didn’t answer right away, just walked beside her in that silent, grounding way of his. Like gravity moved differently around him. Like her body didn’t know how to be on edge in his presence.

She’d tried to explain it to herself—rationalize it—but it was useless. It wasn’t logical. She should’ve still been shaking from the adrenaline, pacing and seething over that shrill, pen-tapping waste of space back in study hall. But instead… her pulse was steady. Her limbs felt loose and warm, like she'd just stepped out of a hot bath. Her thoughts were quiet. Like the snowfall itself was happening inside her.

She felt him watching her.

When she glanced up, his eyes were already on her—storm grey, unreadable, impossibly deep. Like looking into the middle of a thundercloud, seconds before it split open the sky.

“I think I’m addicted to your calm,” she said before she could stop herself.

Devon’s lips quirked in the faintest smile. Not smug. Not surprised. Just a quiet understanding.

The sun had dipped low enough to cast everything in amber-blue. Gold light glanced off the soft waves of her hair as it swept past her waist. She brushed a few flakes from her sleeve, then looked up again as they reached the final row of the lot.

There it was.

Her car.

A 2005 Maybach Exelero, pitch-black and glistening under the snowfall.

It didn’t belong here. Not among scratched-up Civics and clunky Jeeps with fading Greek life bumper stickers. It looked like it had arrived, not parked—like it had stalked into the lot on sleek legs and settled here, waiting to be called.

Low, long, and obsidian smooth, the Exelero reflected the half-light like a pool of oil. The curved hood looked sculpted from shadow itself, its front grille parted in a predatory grin. The headlights narrowed at the corners, sharp and knowing; like they could see through you. No chrome. No badging. Just matte black accents and a whisper of menace beneath the grace.

Mandi watched Devon’s reaction as they approached, an almost shy satisfaction curling in her chest.

He stopped a few feet away, brows lifted faintly. “That’s yours?”

A soft smile played at her lips. “She purrs when you get her over ninety.”

Devon laughed under his breath—a warm, rich sound—and stepped closer, brushing one hand across the cold glass of the passenger window. He turned to her, something unreadable in his eyes.

“I’ve seen a lot of beautiful things,” he said. “But this car… and you standing next to it? That’s a different kind of dangerous.”

The flakes danced around them like ash from a burning sky, soft and soundless. The moment felt suspended, like the snow was holding its breath for them.
Mandi tilted her head, eyes glinting with something unspoken. “You think I’m dangerous?”

“I know you are,” he murmured. “But not with me. Not right now.”

Her lips parted slightly, and for the first time that day, she didn’t feel the need to fill the silence.

She wanted to stay in it.

She pressed the key fob in her palm. The Exelero gave a low, obedient chirp, and the headlights flared to life like eyes opening in the dusk.

“Get in,” she said softly. “I’ll drive slow. I want to make this last.”

And she meant it.
Not the drive.
The calm.
The snow.
Him.

While she’s getting dressed for her executive meeting, I’m ironing her blouse, packing her lunch, and going over the grocery list for the day. 

Once she’s out the door, I tackle the laundry, tidy the living room, and finally sit down to plan dinner: a rosemary roast chicken with garlic potatoes. I scroll through Pinterest for centerpiece ideas because my wife invited her team over next week and I want the house to feel warm, welcoming—Pinterest-perfect. 

Some people don’t get it. They ask if I’m okay “just being at home.” But this is where I thrive. I like caring for her, making things beautiful and functional. Just as I enjoy to look pretty for her, before she comes home I dress up in a long skirt and crop top and patiently wait for her to hand me her purse and take off her jacket and shoes. I‘m just finishing off the dinner preparations while she tells me about her day and I hand her her favorite drink.

My ambition isn’t tied to a paycheck. It’s tied to the rhythm of her and the way she leads our relationship!

I hope you enjoyed this little piece, the lines were just living rent free in my head! Maybe I’ll find a partner that makes me their boytradwife someday!

Roused by the sharp clatter of something tumbling off my desk, I blinked into the gray morning like a man slapped awake by a debt collector. The light creeping through the blinds had the same mercy as a hangman’s rope.

My head throbbed like a funeral drum, and the taste in my mouth was somewhere between kerosene and copper. Last night’s bottle—cheap, angry, and half-poisoned—sat on my desk like the guest who overstayed and wrecked the place. You might imagine me the way the dime rags do: the down-and-out shamus with a badge in the rearview and a flask in the drawer. But that romantic stuff? That’s for the tourists. Truth is, I’m a man the city spat out, now just scraping enough change for bad liquor and worse company. If any of my old buddies from the force walked through that door, I’d half expect 'em to slap on cuffs instead of a handshake.

Los Angeles wasn’t doing much better. Once the land of orange blossoms and second chances, now she wore a mask of smoke and neon. The Depression hadn’t just bruised the city—it gutted it. The streets were crowded with hollow-eyed men chasing jobs that didn’t exist and women who sold what was left of their youth in alleyways reeking of turpentine. You ain’t seen desperation ‘til you’ve seen it through the fog of a morning like this.

The office door creaked, hinges complaining like an old man’s joints, and there she was—Mary. Just a wisp of a girl when she first walked in off the street, seventeen and shaking like a leaf in November. Now eighteen, she kept the place running on coffee, kindness, and stubborn faith in a man who didn’t deserve it. She stepped carefully across the worn floorboards, clutching a folded note like it might vanish if she loosened her grip.

Mary had a way of slipping through the cracks life left open. Never asked for much. Never got much. I promised myself I’d get her something for her birthday—a necklace maybe, or one of those dresses with the ruffled sleeves she admired in shop windows. But the promise buckled under rent, booze, and the wages of being yesterday’s man. “Only way but up, boss,” she’d say with a smile that tried too hard. But we both knew better. I was the kind of ship that didn’t sink all at once—just took on water, one shameful drop at a time.

The paper in Mary’s hand bore a single word, scrawled in sharp ink: *Sully*.

A bitter smirk twisted across my face. Captain Elliot Sullivan—golden boy of the L.A. force. My old ghost, walking tall in polished shoes while I staggered through gutters he barely noticed. His name showed up in the dailies more than the crossword, always with the same grin and same hollow praise. What the hell did he want with me?

“Let him in, kid,” I muttered, striking a match against the desk drawer since my lighter had gone missing—probably with my last scrap of dignity.

Mary nodded, heels echoing like a judge’s gavel across the hardwood. A moment later, the door opened wider, and there he was—same squared jaw, same pressed coat, same air of smug composure that made you want to punch him or elect him. Maybe both.

“Still carrying yourself like the parade never ended, Captain,” I said, shifting in my chair to cover the unease in my gut.

He smiled without warmth. “Benny. You look like hell.”

“I live there now. Rent’s cheap.”

He offered a cigarette from a silver case. I took it, even though it wasn’t the kind I liked. Sully never smoked, but always had a pack ready. Typical. Always playing the host, even in another man’s wreckage.

He walked to the door and slid the bolt with a click, then turned back, eyes sweeping the office like he was inspecting damage after a fire.

“That your breakfast?” he asked, nodding to the glass of brandy on my desk.

I downed it, grimaced, and wiped my mouth with the back of my hand. “Keeps the ghosts company.”

He pulled up the chair across from me, the legs groaning against the wood.

“What’s the angle, Sully?” I asked, voice low.

He took his time answering, clasping his hands like he was about to deliver a sermon. The silence stretched long enough for me to hear the rain begin tapping on the windows—soft at first, like hesitation, then harder, like urgency.

“I’ve got a case,” he finally said. “The kind nobody wants. The kind that disappears when you ask too many questions.”

I barked a humorless laugh. “You’ve got a dozen fresh blue boys dying to earn their stripes. What makes you think I’m the one?”

“Because you’re already off the board. You don’t scare easy. And you’ve got nothing left to lose.”

I leaned back, cigarette smoldering between my fingers. “Flattery’s not your style, Sully. So what’s really going on?”

He hesitated. That alone told me everything. Sully didn’t hesitate. Not unless the ground under him was cracked.

“I’ll make sure Mary’s taken care of. This office too,” he said. “I just need your eyes on this. Quietly.”

He slid a heavy envelope across the desk. The weight told me it wasn’t full of paperclips.

“This is black hat stuff, isn’t it?” I said.

He didn’t nod. He didn’t have to.

“You sure you’re not sending me into a fire just to see if I burn?”

“I’m not here to bury you, Benny. I’m here because this thing is bigger than the badge.”

I lit the cigarette, drew in a long drag, and stared at the smoke curling toward the ceiling. “Alright, Captain. Spill it.”

Sully didn’t hand over a file. No manila folder, no photos, no fingerprints. Just the envelope, and a look in his eyes I hadn’t seen since France—back when the sky itself seemed like it might fall if you stared too long.

“This doesn’t go on the books,” he said, low and clipped. “No reports. No questions asked down at Central. You’re the end of the line.”

I leaned in, the chair creaking under me. “You’re being followed?”

“Not just followed. Fenced in. Every call I make, I get a whisper back in triplicate. I sneeze, and three guys say ‘bless you.’”

He rubbed his hands together, like he was trying to scrub something invisible off his skin.

“You ever hear of Edward Sterling?”

“Doesn’t ring any bells. Actor? Politician?”

“British. War vet. Scientific type. Came over after the armistice. Ended up working at Mount Wilson Observatory.”

“Stars and such?”

“Not just stars. Stuff even the stars don’t understand. Astrophysics, theoretical equations, cosmic rays... things the brass don’t like talked about too loudly.”

That last line hung in the air like smoke.

“He worked under George Hale—Throop College of Technology. It’s Caltech now. Sterling had a wife, two kids. Lived quiet. Kept to himself. Then one day he goes for a walk after supper... and never comes back.”

“Was it foggy?” I asked, half-joking. “Men vanish easier in fog.”

Sully didn’t crack a smile. “His wife filed a report. I got wind of it. Thought maybe it was a domestic thing, maybe the man just cracked. But the next morning, Feds show up. Two of them. Suits so clean you could see your sins in ‘em.”

“What did they say?”

“They said they were ‘monitoring the situation.’ But then, just a day later, the wife retracts the report. Says maybe he left on his own. The same woman who was hysterical the night before, suddenly calm as a Sunday sermon.”

“Sounds rehearsed.”

“It was. I know panic. And I know fear. That wasn’t either. That was *coached silence.*”

Sully stood and paced to the window. Rain whispered against the glass.

“His daughter—Dorothy—didn’t buy it. She came to the station herself. Nineteen. Sharp. Angry. Said her mother was lying. Said her father had been acting strange for weeks, talking about something he wasn’t supposed to, something called the Aetheric Theory.”

“Never heard of it.”

“Neither had I. She said he mentioned a Dr. Thorne. Claimed he was being watched.”

“And you followed it?”

“Of course I did. I went to Mount Wilson. Spoke to the scientists. Most of them clammed up the second I mentioned his name. One guy even pretended not to know him—and I’d just seen a photo of the two of them in the lobby.”

“That’s government-level hush,” I muttered.

“I reached out to a friend in D.C.—used to be in military intelligence. Said he’d poke around. Week later, his office is cleaned out. No goodbye, no explanation. Just ‘on leave.’”

Sully sat back down. The tired in his eyes was different now. It was *infected.*

“Then I get a visit. Two men in gray. No names, no badges, just polished threats. Said if I kept sniffing, I’d find myself reassigned to a desk in Nome.”

“Or a ditch in the desert,” I said.

He nodded slowly. “And that’s when the secretary came forward. Quiet girl. Said she overheard Sterling arguing with military brass. Sounded like he was resisting something. Only phrase she remembered was ‘Hamilton Feed.’”

I frowned. “What the hell is that? A place?”

“Your guess is as good as mine.”

I took another drag, the cigarette nearly burned to the filter. “So let me get this straight. War hero scientist disappears. Wife gets leaned on. Daughter’s the only one pushing. Military’s involved. Feds are circling. And now you’re handing it off... to me.”

Sully leaned in. “They’re not watching you, Benny. You’re off the radar. Damaged goods, yeah—but no one suspects the broken ones.”

He slid the heavy envelope closer. I didn’t open it. Not yet.

“You’ll look into this?”

I stared out the rain-blurred window. Somewhere out there was a missing man. Or a dead one. Or something stranger than both.

I tapped the cigarette into the ashtray. “Yeah,” I said. “I’ll look.”

After Sully left, I stared at the envelope for a long while before stashing it in the drawer under my .38 and the photo of me in uniform, back when my coat still had buttons and my eyes still had hope. I called out to Mary without turning around.

“Take your lunch break, kid. I’m heading home to make myself resemble the living.”

She was already halfway out the door with her umbrella. “You sure you’ll be okay?” she asked, like she always did.

“No,” I said. “But I’ve looked worse.”

That was a lie.

My apartment greeted me with its usual charm: mildew in the corners, a radiator that coughed like a miner, and the unmistakable perfume of damp socks and loneliness. I peeled off last night’s shirt—it had the texture of sandpaper and the smell of regret—and let the bath fill.

I lit a cigarette and sank in. The heat clawed at my skin like penance. Through the steam, I muttered Sully’s name. It still didn’t sit right. He was clean, too clean, and this case smelled like week-old fish in a locked trunk. But the envelope had weight, and weight meant time. Time to dig. Time to make rent. Time to buy flowers.

By the time I stepped out of the tub, the mirror had fogged up so thick I barely recognized the man behind it. I wiped it clear and winced. My forehead sported a jagged gash—a leftover from a tumble with a trash can or a sidewalk or both. The memory was foggy, but the blood was real. I patched it up from the crusty first aid kit under the sink, slicked back my hair, and threw on the cleanest shirt that still had buttons. It was as close to “respectable” as I got.

On the walk back to the office, the sky was spitting again. I passed a flower stall and bought a modest bouquet. The girl behind the counter gave me a look—half pity, half confusion—but took my cash without a word. I didn’t tell her it was for a girl who looked after me better than I deserved.

Back at the office, Mary was nibbling a tuna sandwich, a paper napkin spread like a dinner cloth on her desk.

I dropped the bouquet beside her elbow. “Happy birthday, kid.”

She blinked at it, then at me. “You remembered.”

“Would’ve gotten you pearls if I had Sully’s salary. But this’ll have to do.”

Her fingers brushed the petals like they were made of spun glass. “You didn’t have to, Benny.”

“Maybe not. But I wanted to.” I handed her the envelope Sully gave me—still thick with promise. “Keep this close. If anything happens to me, you take that and run. It’ll keep you fed and safe until you find someplace warmer than this dump.”

Her lips parted in protest, but I cut her off. “No arguments. Just take it.”

She hugged me—tight, no hesitation. The scent of her cheap perfume and the press of her fragile body against mine caught me off guard. It had been a long time since I’d been held without a motive. I didn’t hug back, not fully. I didn’t trust myself to.

“You can vote now,” I said, trying to make light. “Get yourself a real job. Something that doesn’t involve wrangling my whiskey-fueled tantrums.”

She laughed—a tired, lovely sound. “Ain’t nobody worth voting for, Benny. And this job? It suits me just fine.”

Before she left for the day, she handed me a small slip of paper. “Dorothy Sterling. Found her number and address. Real fancy place up in the hills.”

There was a little heart drawn at the bottom of the page. I didn’t mention it.

“Thanks, kid. Go enjoy your birthday.”

“You sure you’ll be okay tonight?” she asked again.

I gave her my best crooked grin. “I’ve got a scientist’s daughter to bother. Should be a hoot.”

The address Mary scribbled led me into the hills—where the city sheds its grime and pretends it’s Paris. Even through the mist and rain, the Sterling estate loomed with that unmistakable old-money arrogance. Spanish tiles. Iron gates. A garden left to ruin.

I stepped out of the cab, shoes sinking slightly into the wet gravel. The place was too quiet, like the world around it had been muted. Across the road, tucked just off the shoulder, sat a man under a black umbrella.

He was perched on a folding chair like it had been there for years. His outfit was... impossible. A mechanic’s jumpsuit with shimmering shoulder pads—opal-toned, subtly shifting colors with every twitch of light. His gloves were white. His face unreadable. The kind of getup that made you wonder if you’d finally gone around the bend.

I lit a cigarette, watched the flame flicker in the wind. He turned to me with an elegant motion and raised a gloved hand.

“You are not from here,” he said, thick French accent, smooth as cognac and just as flammable.

“Neither are you, pal,” I replied.

He stood slowly, umbrella tilting like a ship’s sail. “My name is Jean-Jacques. You may call me that, or not. It will not change the story.”

“I didn’t know there was one.”

He smiled. Not kindly. Not cruelly. Just... knowingly.

“Do you believe in ghosts, monsieur?” he asked, eyes searching mine like he already knew the answer.

“Depends,” I said, shielding my cigarette. “You mean the sheet-and-two-eyeholes kind? Or the ones that live in the mirror?”

He turned, gesturing toward the cliffs opposite the estate. “Look.”

I followed, boots crunching wet gravel. The wind cut through my coat as I stepped toward the edge. Fog rolled along the hills like spilled smoke. And there it was.

Hovering—no other word for it—was something shaped like a crescent moon. Sleek, silver-black, a hundred feet long, impossibly still in the mist. Not a zeppelin. Not a plane. No sound. No lights. Just... there.

I blinked. It didn’t.

Then, just as suddenly, a car rounded the bend behind me, headlights slicing the scene in two. I turned back to Jean-Jacques.

He was gone.

The folding chair remained. Empty. Damp.

A man in a tan overcoat emerged from the gatehouse, squinting through the rain.

“You here for Miss Sterling?”

I nodded, still trying to make sense of what I’d seen. He led me through the gate and up a winding path flanked by moss-slick stones. The house loomed ahead—stucco walls the color of old bones, red tile roof glistening with rain.

Inside, the air was thick with cinnamon and smoke. A maid appeared, silent as a shadow, and handed me a towel and a black coffee that tasted better than it had any right to. I stood warming my hands, waiting, when I heard the click of heels on tile.

She came down the staircase like something out of a perfume ad—half-robed, half-aware of the effect she had. Blond waves tousled, cheekbones sharp enough to make an honest man flinch. She wore her confidence like silk. Literally.

“So. You’re Benny,” she said.

I looked away, trying not to count the places her robe didn’t cover. “Elliot mentioned you,” she added. “Didn’t say you only had one eye.”

“They call me Cyclops,” I muttered. “But I still see trouble just fine.”

She smirked. “I’ll be the judge of that.”

She poured herself a vodka, the good kind, and didn’t offer me any. Just as well. My head was still a half-lit billboard.

“My father’s gone,” she said, cutting to it. “And no one wants to admit it matters.”

“I do,” I replied. “That’s why I’m here.”

“Elliot said you’re a wreck.”

“He’s not wrong.”

“Then why should I trust you?”

I leaned forward slightly, letting my voice drop to where it mattered. “Because I’m not afraid of looking where I’m not supposed to. And I don’t care who gets nervous when I do.”

That earned a flicker of something in her eyes. Not quite respect. But close.

She sipped. “He talked about... theories. Things he wasn’t supposed to share. Aetheric pressure. Frequencies between stars. Said he felt watched. Mentioned a man named Dr. Thorne.”

“Where can I find this Thorne?”

“If I knew, I’d have asked him myself.”

She stepped to the window, rain streaking the glass behind her.

“I think they took him,” she said. “I think he found something and they made it vanish.”

I watched her silhouette against the pale light, a ghost of her own.

“I’ll dig,” I said. “Just be ready for what I might shovel up.”

As I turned to go, a thought struck me. “There was a man out by the road. Jean-Jacques. French. Looked like he stepped off a stagecoach from Mars. You know him?”

She frowned. “There’s no one like that on the grounds. Must be one of the neighbors.”

Her voice said neighbor. Her face said mystery.

I stepped out into the rain again. The crescent object was gone. So was the folding chair.

The city below shimmered like a bruise.

I lit another cigarette, held it between wet fingers, and exhaled a ribbon of doubt.

Usually I dress very glamourous when I go with my girlfriends there for dinner and drinks but yesterday I went on a solo date wearing a simple kurti jeans and almost no makeup as I went directly after commercial street saree shopping. 

After errands there I was standing nearing Starbucks contemplating whether to try matcha for first time in my life or not. A dude appeared, I thought he wants to know directions and honestly I am pretty bad at it so I lied that I am new to Bengaluru.

He started asking me details and obviously I lied. He then offered me coffee from Starbucks and I started getting paranoid so I started booking rapido in front of him telling I need to go somewhere. 

Then he told 'I will be straightforward, I have a deal for you. I will buy myself a coffee and you just spit into it and I will give you 5000 rupees'

So I need to have a vent, and that might stop me from accidentally losing it at my husband and saying something I'll regret later.

He's driving me mad, and I know a lot of it is my hormones, but he's also not listening to me when I tell him to stop doing things that piss me off! And our sex life is the worst right now. I've always had a really high libido, much higher than him, and so I've had to deal with constant rejection throughout our 13 years together. 

When peri hit my libido died and holy fucking shitballs, did he MOAN about it. Like poor fucking him, he suddenly didnt get laid whenever he wanted it and he got knocked back sonetimes. While I used to just feel sorry for myself and try chat about how we could deal with it better as a couple, he would sit me down for these big talks about how I needed to TRY harder. Because he needed a certain level of intimacy. It was so infuriating to deal with because his hypocrisy was painful.

Oh, and now I'm firmly in menopause and been on HRT for a while, my libido is totally back in force. And guess who's the one getting rejected again. So, I feel like screaming at him that now I'm fucking TRYING HARDER but he doesn't want to get off his phone long enough to do anything. 

I'm also wondering if he's trying some form of weaponised incompetence to get out of sex. Because when we do have it he's started doing things that he knows I don't like. I tell him to stop but then he does it again next time. And it's clearly a chore to him. He asks what I want and then he just gets in position and does it. No intimacy, no kissing or touching. Despite having a raging ladyboner all the time it makes me not want to have sex with him, funnily enough, I'd rather slink off and have a wank. 

He's also picked up some nasty personal hygiene habits that are such a turn off. Like not brushing his teeth. He's grown a beard that always holds a bit of the iced coffee he drinks too much of, and so it emits a spoiled milk smell. You know, like unwashed baby clothes. Soooo sexy. 

I'm so touch starved and affection starved that I think im going crazy. And the worst part is I used to think we had a great relationship. In some ways he's a good partner, and he never used to be so stubborn about listening to me. Scarily enough, it's like he's turning into his Dad as he gets older which is a terrifying thought.

A questi andrebbero aggiunti i cicloturisti, che spesso viaggiano in gruppo e hanno esigenze particolari rispetto a pendolari e ciclisti per svago.](https://preview.redd.it/q49k561xtmue1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3ea2a4bb09a7f2fa26f17aa7b0d225b4823da0f)



# Quando si parla di ciclisti spesso molti fanno un calderone di ‘ciclisti 100% indisciplinati’ alimentando uno sciocco pregiudizio secondo cui chi va in bicicletta è un anarchico senza patente ([non è vero](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2018/10/11/i-ciclisti-guidano-meglio-lauto-e-hanno-meno-incidenti-degli-automobilisti-che-non-vanno-in-bici-accident-analysis-prevention-study/)) mentre l’automobilista è un disciplinato cultore della legge (e anche questo non è vero).

Entrambe le categorie commettono numerose infrazioni, con la differenza che chi guida un suv da 2,5 tonnellate ma anche un'utilitaria da una tonnellata è molto più pericoloso della stessa identica persona quando va in bicicletta. [Un’auto che a 50 km/h investe un pedone ha un impatto pari a circa cento ciclisti che vanno a 20 km/h](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2019/09/10/essere-investiti-da-unauto-a-50-km-h-e-come-essere-investiti-da-tutto-il-plotone-del-giro-ditalia/).

Il punto importante è che ci sono molte categorie di ciclisti, illustrate nell’immagine sopra, e cioè:

1. **Ciclista quotidiano.** È il ciclista, uomo o donna, che usa tutti i giorni la bici per andare al lavoro, a scuola e per fare commissioni familiari. Si va dall’impiegato che lavora dalle 9 alle 18 [all’agente di commercio](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2018/09/18/lagente-di-commercio-che-fa-50-km-ogni-giorno-in-bicicletta-elettrica/) che visita numerosi clienti tutti i giorni, dallo studente all’insegnante.
2. **Ciclista sportivo.** È il ciclista che usa la bicicletta per allenamento sportivo, professionale, semiprofessionale o amatoriale, ma anche per esplorare i dintorni della sua città, facendo spesso centinaia di km alla settimana. Di questa categoria fanno parte anche i paraciclisti che si allenano con biciclette speciali. Il codice della strada italiano è particolarmente impietoso nei suoi confronti, con una normativa particolarmente confusa sia a proposito dei [gruppi](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2017/04/08/codice-della-strada-lart-182-comma-1-e-contraddittorio-pericoloso-scritto-male/), sia a proposito delle [piste ciclabli](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2016/11/29/quiz-i-ciclisti-sono-sempre-obbligati-ad-usare-le-piste-ciclabili-e-ciclopedonali/).
3. **Ciclista del tempo libero.** Chi usa la bici per fare un giro, per andare al caffè, uscire la sera o passare un pomeriggio festivo, tanto nella propria città quanto in vacanza
4. **Ciclista attento.** È il ciclista che vuole circolare in sicurezza, desidera seguire le regole del codice (che però in italia sono spesso [confuse](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2017/04/08/codice-della-strada-lart-182-comma-1-e-contraddittorio-pericoloso-scritto-male/), contraddittorie e [controproducenti](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2017/12/20/perche-la-norma-dei-gilet-riflettenti-per-ciclisti-e-assurda-e-vessatoria/)) e ha bisogno di segnaletica chiara e intersezioni sicure. È il ciclista che più facilmente rinuncia alla bicicletta se pensa di essere in una situazione di pericolo. Spesso [le donne preferiscono non usare la bicicletta](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2019/12/30/come-sarebbe-una-citta-progettata-dalle-donne-bbc-video/) se pensano che gli automobilisti siano troppo pericolosi e aggressivi. Molti italiani vorrebbero usare la bicicletta per lavoro o per commissioni, ma non lo fa perché ha paura del traffico.
5. **Ciclista vulnerabile.** Si tratta principalmente di bambini, [disabili](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2018/04/27/ma-e-gli-anziani-e-i-disabili-come-fanno-ad-andare-in-bicicletta/) con bici a due o tre ruote, e [anziani](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2018/09/07/perche-tutti-tutelano-gli-anziani-costretti-a-usare-lauto-per-andare-in-farmacia-o-in-parrocchia-ma-nessuno-tutela-gli-anziani-in-bicicletta/), sempre con bici a due o tre ruote. Hanno bisogno di percorsi particolarmente sicuri, e particolare rispetto da parte degli utenti motorizzati.
6. **Corrieri in bici.** Sono persone che lavorano in bici per fare consegne o per trasportare la propria attrezzatura: corrieri, fattorini, postini, [artigiani](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2018/06/19/si-puo-fare-lidraulico-in-bicicletta-e-senza-furgone-a-roma-si/), [tuttofare](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2019/02/19/alessandria-il-caso-dellartigiano-aggiustatutto-con-la-cargo-bike-che-lavora-e-vive-meglio-senza-furgone/) in bicicletta. Da notare che, mentre i corrieri con furgone quando parcheggiano sui marciapiedi, in doppia fila o sulle piste ciclabili sono sempre giustificati con ‘solo cinque minuti, sto lavorando’, i corrieri in bici vengono spesso etichettati come delinquenti che non rispettano il codice della strada. Come mai questo doppio standard?
7. **I** **cicloturisti**. Categoria non prevista nell’illustrazione sopra, sta diventando sempre più importante in Europa anche per [il giro d’affari che comincia a muovere](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2014/01/12/miliardi-di-euro-per-il-cicloturismo-in-europa-e-in-italia/). I cicloturisti viaggiano spesso in gruppo, hanno spesso bisogno di usare anche il treno, e hanno bisogno di servizi e assistenza lungo la strada. Fortunatamente molti alberghi si stanno attrezzando per servire al meglio questo tipo di clientela che, in proporzione, spende di più e pesa di meno sul territorio rispetto agli ingombranti turisti in automobile. [I cicloturisti si suddividono a loro volta in almeno tre categorie](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2021/04/11/ci-sono-3-tipi-di-cicloturisti-e-molti-albergatori-non-lo-sanno-perdendo-clienti/).

È evidente che queste sette categorie di ciclisti hanno caratteristiche particolari e hanno bisogno di una attenzione specifica da parte delle amministrazioni pubbliche, delle aziende, delle scuole e anche un’attenzione particolare da parte di chi guida mezzi motore. [I ciclisti, per il codice della strada, sono utenti vulnerabili, come pedoni e disabili](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2017/06/26/la-bici-e-un-veicolo-ma-il-ciclista-e-un-utente-debole-come-pedoni-e-disabili/).

È altrettanto evidente che è del tutto inutile e anche stupido dipingere sempre i ciclisti come anarchici che non rispettano il codice della strada. Nessuna delle categorie di utenti della strada rispetta tutte le norme: gli automobilisti fanno le loro infrazioni, i motociclisti le loro infrazioni, i pedoni le loro infrazioni e i ciclisti le loro infrazioni. Non è con l’invito astratto a rispettare il codice della strada che si riducono gli incidenti, ma riprogettando le strade, realizzando più piste ciclabili e potenziando i mezzi pubblici.

È invece utile progettare strade sicure anche per queste categorie di ciclisti, che pesano meno su ambiente e territorio ma portano più benessere e una mobilità migliore.

Quando una città è progettata per bambini, pedoni, ciclisti è meglio per tutti, compresi gli automobilisti. Quando una città è progettata prioritariamente per l’automobile, con autostrade urbane e parcheggi dappertutto, è peggio per tutti, compresi gli automobilisti.

1lzoo2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lzoo2x/i_think_i_just_hit_one_of_the_lowest_lows_of_my/,"I think I just hit one of the lowest lows of my life, and I don’t know how to move through this breakup.","Hi Reddit family,

I guess I’m turning to this space because I feel like I’ve hit a real low — maybe even the lowest point I’ve had in terms of relationships, connection, and self-worth. And while it feels embarrassing to admit, I also don’t really have a safe place or people who would fully get it right now. So here I am.

For the past year, I was in what I now understand was a deeply messed-up situationship. I met this guy in my neighborhood — it felt organic, magical even, especially after feeling so disillusioned by dating apps and the idea of “meeting someone naturally.” From the moment we met, there was a spark. But it also came with a ton of complexity.

He’s five years younger than me, and at a very different stage in life. He was about to leave the country for further studies, came from a difficult family background, and had a lot riding on his shoulders. I, on the other hand, am in my early 30s, live alone in a new city, and have been trying to build a life and business from scratch. It's been a vulnerable phase for me — professionally, emotionally, and relationally.

Despite all the differences, we got close. Really close. What was supposed to be a brief connection before he left became a year-long emotional entanglement. We’d video call all the time. He was my companion through some of my loneliest days. We shared deeply, fought passionately, and somehow always made up.

When he told me he was coming back to India for two months, I panicked. I knew seeing him again would only deepen the attachment — and we had no real plan for the future. We fought a lot before he arrived. Still, I picked him up from the airport. And from the moment he returned, it was chaos — constant tension between me, him, and his family (who always knew about me, and clearly disapproved).

Things escalated badly. His mother confronted me got his sisters along. She screamed at me, told me to back off, to never cross paths with them again. His sisters even took me out for a chai afterward. I left feeling confused and deeply unsettled.

After that, he blocked me. I emailed him, hoping to just say what I needed to. That same day, I asked a friend to call him. He didn’t really say much — just that he couldn’t guarantee if he’d ever call me back. Later, I found out his mom got hold of my email. She sent me angry texts, called me, threatened to involve my family. She said if I ever reached out again, she’d escalate it. She even accused me of hurting him and said she had “evidence.” It was bizarre and terrifying.

We didn’t speak for a while. Then, out of the blue, he called. I didn’t pick up. The next day was Sunday — I sent out my weekly email (I write a newsletter), and it must have reached him, which meant he had unblocked me. He messaged me to say it was over. I agreed. We both admitted we were heartbroken.

He asked if we could still be friends, meet for a coffee. I said no — I didn’t think it was safe, especially given how hostile his mother had been. But he reassured me she was okay with it. We ended up talking more. He told me he wanted to spend some nice time together before he left. We had good conversations. It felt like maybe we were finding some peace.

He told me he wanted to make things right. I asked him to do it before assuming his mother wouldn’t allow it. He said he would. That night, I told him I just wanted to fall asleep on call, to feel like we could end this connection gently. He promised not to block me again. We stayed on the phone for five hours, asleep.

And then today, I found out he’s blocked me. Again.

He still hasn’t removed me from Instagram. It’s like he wants to see me, but not actually talk to me. I feel so discarded, so invisible. I’m ashamed that I still care, that I keep hoping he’ll unblock me and just say something kind or real. But instead, I’m just left with this heartbreak and silence.

I don’t know what this post is — a rant, a goodbye, a plea for solidarity. I know I need to let go, but god, it hurts.

It took us a lot of tries to make tracking of expenses work, often times we got too distracted or too lazy to enter the transactions into the app or excel sheet. Especially that the banks in our country have no integration with popular finance tracking apps. 

What we needed:

* Easy to add transaction, the moment of willingness to do it is short, so this must be easy 
* Automated way of tracking limits/budgets per category 
* Automated way of knowing how much is left in the budget for particular category 

Solutions:

* Mobile apps: limited on category creation and needs an purchase/upgrade, costly time wise to learn UX (many of them have UX outdated)
* Google Sheets: I built a perfect Google Sheet template that does it all, counts the left budget, how much can be saved etc. but adding the transaction in a moment was always hard as it needs a laptop, mobile experience isn't perfect

So I built a Telegram bot. 

It has prebuilt categories of expenses, you can set a budget per month per each category, it records a transaction from a simple message ""coffee 7"" into Food category recording the time and the person who added it within a family.

1lzoni5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoetryWritingClub/comments/1lzoni5/monday/,Monday,"Monday comes like a scar you stopped tracing.
Familiar. Healed. But still tender in places.

Not a villain.
Not a savior.
Just the weight of what begins again
before you’re ready.

The coffee doesn’t cut it.
The mirror shows too much.
And somewhere between the undone bed
and the undone self,
you remember
discipline is a kind of devotion,
and survival isn’t always soft.

You greet the day like an old flame.
Careful.
Respectful.
Still burning in the background of everything you do.

And maybe you don’t pray anymore
but you still listen.
To the rev of the engine.
To the voice in your head that sounds like someone
you used to be.
To the footsteps that say,
“Go anyway.”

Because Monday isn’t a punishment.
It’s a pulse.
A promise with no music
just the rhythm of showing up
when no one’s watching.

And if that isn’t poetry,
what is?

Unicorn Pee pigment: pictures, thoughts, and feelings.","The polish is Indigo Bananas [This Shift is Bananas](https://www.indigobananas.com/products/this-shift-is-bananas-dark-purple-up-shimmer). This polish is a dark purple/indigo made with the original Unicorn Pee green-to-red shifting shimmer pigment. I used 1× KBShimmer Fillin’ Groovy, 2× This Shift is Bananas, 1× Mooncat Speed Demon.

Pictures 1–4 are direct sunlight showing the different shifts, 5–7 are indirect office lighting and 8 is outside in indirect lighting while cloudy.

I bought this because I missed it out on the era of Clarins 230 and wanted to see what the fuss was with the Unicorn Pee pigment. Indigo Bananas makes a few polishes with the OG UP pigment. I picked up this one, and [A Damn Fine Cup of Coffee](https://www.indigobananas.com/products/damn-fine-cup-of-coffee) which I'm pretty excited to wear this fall.

To start, these were my first purchases from Indigo Bananas and I think the formula was lovely. I like a slightly thinner polish, so for someone who prefers their polish thicker they might be disappointed, however I wouldn't say it was exceptionally thin either. I flooded since cuticles, but that was mostly because I recently got rid of nail length and did a poor job of realizing I needed less polish on the brush. I would definitely buy more of their polishes especially considering the bottles are 15 mL and their non‑UP polishes range from $10 for cremes to $15 for magnetics which is pretty great pricing. Obviously the UP polishes are more expensive ($18–28 for the full size bottles), but they also sell mini 8 mL bottles for all of their polishes which are generally half the price.

For the polish/pigment, I think it's extremely pretty! …If it's in the sun. It's not ugly in indirect lighting, it's still very pretty. It just doesn't look all that special. Honestly I think this suffers from what linear holographic polishes suffer from and it's just kind of blah if it's not in direct lighting. I don't regret the purchase, mostly because I wanted to experience UP for myself. But I do wonder if the hype is mostly nostalgia for a shimmer pigment that was unique for its time.

Overall, I don't regret the purchase, but I do kind of wish I bought a mini bottle, or one of the toppers that IB makes. I imagine this pigment would be bonkers on top of black. I am still enjoying seeing the sparkle in the sun, where it looks best.",18,1752504940.0,RedditLaqueristas,3,0.95,False

1lzok5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1lzok5e/trip_report_july_2025_nayara_tented_camp_and_andaz/,Trip Report - July 2025 - Nayara Tented Camp and Andaz,"We recently got back from our trip to Costa Rica and wanted to post our thoughts for anyone else looking at these two resorts. We did a split stay of four nights at Nayara and 3 nights at Andaz and had our trip planned by Rachel Peck at Costa Rica Vacations (highly recommend her if you want to use a travel agent). We decided to use a travel agent for this trip because it was our first big international one and there were 8 of us with ages ranging from 7-62.

We flew into SJO and had a driver take us on the 3-hour ride to Nayara. The first half of the drive was great and we stopped for lunch at a restaurant just off the highway. The second half though turned to narrow and windy roads which really tested the limits of my Dramamine. But otherwise, the driver was great and kept checking in with us to make sure we were all comfortable. We ended up stopping one time for a bathroom break at a roadside convenience store/restaurant and again at a fruit stand which had amazing fruit and there was a sloth hanging out in the tree outside!

Nayara Tented Camp was by far the best resort we have ever been to. The entire grounds were so beautiful, I almost couldn’t believe it. The “tents” were very luxurious and having your own thermal pool right on your deck was awesome. Also, I know they use the term tent at the resort but there was very little that was tent-like with the room outside of the walls had canvas on them. Since we have 4 kids, we ended up getting the family one which included the main tent and a second tent right next to it. The tents are secluded with all the vegetation so we literally couldn’t see anyone else’s tent while staying there which we loved. The food was very high quality and our kids loved the breakfast at Ayla every morning. My personal favorite was La Terraza which had an amazing view of Arenal once the fog/rain cleared. The restaurants all have a kid’s menu too which helped a lot with my little kids. The hot springs are so relaxing and sitting in them in the middle of the rain forest is just the greatest. The regular pool was also fun and had really nice service for drinks or lunch. I would be hard pressed to find a negative thing to say about this place but the only changes I would make would be to have the gelato store open later so we could get some after dinner and also have a coffee store that allows kids to come in.

While at Nayara, we did the Sky Adventures rainforest hike/hanging bridges and the zipline. I can’t recommend that place highly enough. Our guide on the hike and bridges was so knowledgeable and did a fantastic job of finding wildlife and flowers to point out to us. The zipline was equal parts terrifying and amazing. It was raining the day we were there which didn’t feel great while flying 40+ mph down a zipline but it was easily the highlight of the trip. The next day my wife and older kids did the waterfall repelling through Pure Trek and said it was a fantastic experience as well. 

We then switched resorts and headed to Andaz Papagayo. Unfortunately, this meant another long ride in the car but I knew enough this time to double up my Dramamine dose. The resort grounds at Andaz were amazing and well-manicured. The lobby itself was stunning and had great views of the bay.  We booked adjoining rooms at this resort and while they were very nice, it was no comparison to Nayara. The staff here was also fantastic and the What’s App messaging with the front desk worked very well to ask about dining reservations or to call for a golf cart ride. The restaurants were also high quality with my favorite being La Piazza (especially the Caeser pizza). The coffee shop, Coffee & Vinyl’s, was a great place to stop in for a drink and a treat. The resort offers a boat and shuttle service to take you over to the Beach House which is a very nice area with a restaurant but with small kids, we got bored fairly quickly and headed back to the resort. Our kids loved the pool area at the resort and swam for hours. The main pools at Andaz were a little better than Nayara just because there were three of them vs one which allowed for people to be more spread out. The biggest difference for us though was the lack of activities around Andaz vs Nayara. We knew that going in and that part of the trip was going to be our hang out by the pool and relax portion but we found that we’re not hang out by the pool for hours people. The older kids and I booked the Aerial Adventure which was really fun but underwhelming after experiencing Sky Adventure. The guides there were very good though and made it a really enjoyable time. I also booked a tee time at the Four Seasons golf course which is an absolutely beautiful course. Andaz offers a shuttle service to the Four Seasons grounds so it was very easy to get to the course. We also used that to go over and eat at Pesce which was our favorite meal of the trip. The food was beyond delicious, our server was great, and our table was out on the screened in patio where you could hear the waves washing up on the beach. The nice part about leaving for home from Andaz is that we flew out of Liberia airport which was only 30 minutes away.

Overall, this was the best trip our family has been on. We travel fairly often but with young kids, we mostly stuck to trips in the US or if we went “international” it was on a cruise. We have already started planning a return trip but will be staying in the Arenal area the whole time and maybe just trade out Andaz for The Springs if we do a split stay.",1,1752504908.0,CostaRicaTravel,2,0.67,False
1lzok46,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lzok46/i_think_i_just_hit_one_of_the_lowest_lows_of_my/,"I think I just hit one of the lowest lows of my life, and I don’t know how to move through this breakup.","Hi Reddit family,

I guess I’m turning to this space because I feel like I’ve hit a real low — maybe even the lowest point I’ve had in terms of relationships, connection, and self-worth. And while it feels embarrassing to admit, I also don’t really have a safe place or people who would fully get it right now. So here I am.

For the past year, I was in what I now understand was a deeply messed-up situationship. I met this guy in my neighborhood — it felt organic, magical even, especially after feeling so disillusioned by dating apps and the idea of “meeting someone naturally.” From the moment we met, there was a spark. But it also came with a ton of complexity.

He’s five years younger than me, and at a very different stage in life. He was about to leave the country for further studies, came from a difficult family background, and had a lot riding on his shoulders. I, on the other hand, am in my early 30s, live alone in a new city, and have been trying to build a life and business from scratch. It's been a vulnerable phase for me — professionally, emotionally, and relationally.

Despite all the differences, we got close. Really close. What was supposed to be a brief connection before he left became a year-long emotional entanglement. We’d video call all the time. He was my companion through some of my loneliest days. We shared deeply, fought passionately, and somehow always made up.

When he told me he was coming back to India for two months, I panicked. I knew seeing him again would only deepen the attachment — and we had no real plan for the future. We fought a lot before he arrived. Still, I picked him up from the airport. And from the moment he returned, it was chaos — constant tension between me, him, and his family (who always knew about me, and clearly disapproved).

Things escalated badly. His mother confronted me got his sisters along. She screamed at me, told me to back off, to never cross paths with them again. His sisters even took me out for a chai afterward. I left feeling confused and deeply unsettled.

After that, he blocked me. I emailed him, hoping to just say what I needed to. That same day, I asked a friend to call him. He didn’t really say much — just that he couldn’t guarantee if he’d ever call me back. Later, I found out his mom got hold of my email. She sent me angry texts, called me, threatened to involve my family. She said if I ever reached out again, she’d escalate it. She even accused me of hurting him and said she had “evidence.” It was bizarre and terrifying.

We didn’t speak for a while. Then, out of the blue, he called. I didn’t pick up. The next day was Sunday — I sent out my weekly email (I write a newsletter), and it must have reached him, which meant he had unblocked me. He messaged me to say it was over. I agreed. We both admitted we were heartbroken.

He asked if we could still be friends, meet for a coffee. I said no — I didn’t think it was safe, especially given how hostile his mother had been. But he reassured me she was okay with it. We ended up talking more. He told me he wanted to spend some nice time together before he left. We had good conversations. It felt like maybe we were finding some peace.

He told me he wanted to make things right. I asked him to do it before assuming his mother wouldn’t allow it. He said he would. That night, I told him I just wanted to fall asleep on call, to feel like we could end this connection gently. He promised not to block me again. We stayed on the phone for five hours, asleep.

And then today, I found out he’s blocked me. Again.

He still hasn’t removed me from Instagram. It’s like he wants to see me, but not actually talk to me. I feel so discarded, so invisible. I’m ashamed that I still care, that I keep hoping he’ll unblock me and just say something kind or real. But instead, I’m just left with this heartbreak and silence.

I don’t know what this post is — a rant, a goodbye, a plea for solidarity. I know I need to let go, but god, it hurts.

Over the weekend, my wife and I had a dance party. We are both big Madonna fans (fond memories as a teen boy waiting for her videos to come on, not gonna lie). Anyway...this mix album is better than the later mix albums in my opinion. The ""*Finally Enough Love: 50 Number Ones*"" album that came out in 2022....I have to say even though it has a lot of songs on it...I was bored by it. We started listening to it for the ride from SC to FL on route to see Madonna in concert last year and... turned off that album about 10 songs in.

 ANYWAY>>>> back to the point. Summer of 1987, I was working with my dad in NYC. He was a carpenter working for someone who owned a bunch of buildings in NYC. I was the 13-year-old helper who would go down to the car to get tools, hold the flashlight incorrectly, etc. Apparently, back then it was ok (shouldn't have been) for a 13-year-old to run down to a corner store and get his dad cigarettes, coffee, and a snack. I spied with my little eye, a record shop. Living in a small-town rural area in NJ (yes they do exist), I hadn't seen an actual record store before. There was posters and a big display of Madonna's ""You Can Dance"" remix album. I had $4 on me, so I bought it! All the songs are good mixes (I like mixes that have original music of the original song and some extras vs those mixes that have generic music pulsating).  I would make my own mix tapes and make songs longer (The Monkees Star Collector, Hall and Oates had an extended version of Out of Touch and I made it 45 minutes longer).  THIS Madonna remix album did it so well, I didn’t have to add anything.  Add on vinyl singles remixes over the years (not just Madonna by the way I have a collection of all sorts from Janet Jackson to the B-52s, etc), of Express Yourself and Like a Prayer, and cassette singles remixes of Vogue and Frozen, and CD singles remixes of songs like Ray of Light and Beautiful Stranger I had quite the collection.  When it came time to DJ, even though the songs were from THIS remix album were 10 years older, they got the party going.  Can’t resist when Madonna says “I’m Waiting”!

This last weekend’s dance party was so good, my Australian Shepherds and Chihuahua got in on it too.

1lzoce8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lzoce8/explore_the_smeg_drip_coffee_maker_review_is/,Explore the Smeg Drip Coffee Maker Review: Is Retro Style Worth it?,"Testing out the Smeg DCF02CRUS drip coffee maker was an experience filled with both nostalgia and practicality. This machine, with its iconic retro design, easily became the centerpiece of my kitchen. Smeg has married vintage aesthetics with modern features, making it an excellent choice for coffee enthusiasts who crave beauty and functionality in equal measure. Boasting features like a fully automatic mode, a 10-cup glass carafe, and an adjustable coffee strength option, this machine does more than just look attractive—it delivers on performance.

**Aesthetic Appeal and Build Quality**  
The retro look of this coffee maker had my guests guessing if I’d pulled it straight out of the ’50s. The cream color and polished finish scream vintage charm, while the buttons and LED display lend a subtle hint of modernity. Despite its nostalgic appearance, it feels exceptionally solid, weighing a little over seven pounds. Its compact dimensions mean it doesn't hog too much precious kitchen counter real estate, which is perfect for my small apartment. Smeg really nails the whole “form meets function” thing here.

**User Interface and Ease of Use**  
Accessing the controls through the LED display and buttons felt intuitive, not overwhelming. The programmable auto-start quickly became my favorite feature—it only took a few tries to set it up so coffee was ready right as I stumbled into the kitchen every morning. For folks like me, who don’t always want to make a full pot, the machine includes a 4-cup brewing option. I wasn't too keen on trying out the descaling alarm at first, but I appreciated how it reminded me when maintenance was due, ensuring the machine stayed in top shape.

[Check out Smeg DCF02CRUS deals on Amazon now.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07rjtpr4y/)

**Customizable Coffee Brewing**  
Coffee strength is a personal obsession of mine. I loved how this coffee machine offered both light and intense aroma settings. I went all-in with the intense setting on workday mornings, savoring every bold sip, while my partner, who prefers milder brews, opted for the lighter setting on weekends. Another standout was the adjustable water hardness feature. Tweaking it to suit my locality gave the brew an extra level of uniqueness that I hadn’t experienced with other machines.

**Performance and Additional Features**  
The true test of any coffee maker lies in whether it delivers hot, delicious coffee—and this one certainly does. The coffee tasted consistently fresh across multiple brewing cycles. Its extended ""keep warm"" function kept my coffee at a drinkable temperature for a full hour after brewing, which was a lifesaver on particularly chaotic mornings. The reusable coffee filter was an eco-friendly addition I didn’t know I needed, significantly reducing the waste from paper filters.

**What Worked Well**  
- The combination of 10-cup capacity and a compact footprint impressed me.  
- Saving settings like brew-time and coffee strength was ultra-convenient.  
- Eco-conscious touches, especially the reusable filter, earned big brownie points.  

**What this Coffee Maker Could Improve**  
- The audible alerts can get a tad annoying; thankfully, turning them off is an option.  
- It does take a bit of trial and error to master water hardness adjustment.  
- While the lid’s design was improved from the earlier model, it still doesn’t feel entirely seamless during pouring.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this retro-style coffee maker to other brands like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 and Breville Precision Brewer, some stark differences emerge. The Cuisinart model is more affordable and comes packed with more specific options for brewing temperatures. On the other hand, Breville excels in features like adjustable bloom time and water temperature calibration. However, what sets this product apart is its sheer aesthetic appeal combined with a robust performance. Neither of the competitors can claim to double as a statement piece for your kitchen.

**True Value for Buyers**  
For a coffee machine that blends reliability, customization, and vintage design, the price feels justified. It does lean on the higher end of costs in its category, but the added charm and innovation make it worth considering. Features like the auto-start, aroma settings, and keep-warm function translate to convenience I’ve come to appreciate every day. If aesthetics and functionality carry equal importance to you, this machine delivers both with flair.

1lzoc3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/PelvicFloor/comments/1lzoc3c/encouraging/,Encouraging,"Following this page for a while and I know how depressing this can be so wanted to share my progress in hopes that some will feel encouraged. I’ve been on this journey for almost a year and wow!, it’s been just awful (active, healthy F 61) but I finally believe I have turned a corner. For me this all started with running to pee more than usual. Thought I was just drinking too much coffee but things escalated greatly over the course of a few weeks. I had a rotating list of symptoms - urge to urinate 24/7, pain in lower back and lower right side, bladder spasms, burning pelvic pain. I was unable to do anything without triggering symptoms. Even just walking brought on extreme discomfort. I felt a little let down by my doctors. Initially insisting it was a UTI even though I told them it didn’t feel like it. I ended up at a Urologist who eliminated various causes via in depth Urinalysis, CT, Ultrasound & Cystoscopy. While it was great to know everything looked good the Urologist then just dismissed me without any suggestions on what to do next or potential causes. I was left feeling pretty helpless and miserable. At that point, which was around Jan of this year, I stumbled across a podcast about pelvic floor issues. This was a lightbulb moment since the symptoms closely mirrored my own. I had not even thought about this and none of the doctors I attended had mentioned it either. After some trial and error I found an amazing Physical Therapist! Here is what I’ve been doing since Feb:

1) Twice weekly PT for first month. This started with an in depth 90 minute evaluation. The PT started by saying that everyone is different so need to find out root cause. In my case, it’s a tight PF muscle on the right side but cause is my right hip tilt and very tight tissue which has caused a malfunction and over compensation of the PF muscles. Subsequent sessions have been focused on myofascial release with a combination of internal and external work.

2) After month 1 moved to weekly PT sessions with daily exercises focused on hip movement/mobility. 

3) Increased protein intake in diet to maximize healing and deep breathing techniques.

While I am not 100% yet I am up to about 95% and finally feeling progress every week. I have about 3 PT sessions left. I have not had any major flare ups in a month which is huge. A few minor flare ups but nothing intense and they pass quickly. I feel like I am back to my old self. This was a long post but wanted to show that it is possible to heal for those who think it’s hopeless. I will say it’s not easy and it takes consistency. You might find it’s a bit of a roller coaster if you are just starting PT and may feel things get a little worse before they get better. My therapist said it’s like if you haven’t been to the gym in years and suddenly decide to do an intense work out. You are likely going to have sore muscles. You can’t just go to PT a few times and expect to be “cured” immediately. Hang in there everyone! You can get better. Keep in mind that most folks posting here are not there yet so it can feel like it’s a helpless battle but many people can “fix” the problem. It’s definitely not an overnight fix, more of a journey! Hope this encourages some. ",3,1752504394.0,PelvicFloor,2,1.0,False

I’m not viral.
I’m not backed by money, or connections, or anything fancy.
Just heart, and the stubborn belief that this dream of mine matters.

I’m a writer and a freelance copywriter. Right now, I’m working on a novel I’ve poured my entire heart into — the kind of story that’s painful, healing, and deeply human. I’m also slowly building a copywriting business, helping small brands and creators put real emotion into their words.
But here’s the part I’ve never really talked about — the big dream:

One day, I want to open a bookstore café.
A quiet, cozy space filled with shelves of meaningful books, warm coffee, soft chairs, and peaceful lighting.
A place where people can write, study, escape, breathe.
Where it’s okay to show up alone and just exist for a while.
I picture the smell of espresso and old pages.
I imagine stocking the shelves with my own book one day.
And creating a place where people feel seen — without having to say a word.
But right now, the dream feels really far away.
My Instagram (@traces.of.innk) barely gets any traction.
My posts don’t get likes, and my writing mostly lives in silence.
It gets discouraging, honestly.
But I keep going.
Because even if nobody else sees it yet… I do.

If you’ve ever built something from scratch especially when it felt like no one was watching — I’d love to hear how you pushed through.
What kept you going?
What helped you build momentum in the early days?

I’m here. I’m building. I’m writing.
And I’m believing this will one day be more than a dream.

1lzo2rh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HQMC/comments/1lzo2rh/urina_orina_mear_pipi_pis/,"Urina, orina, mear, pipi, pis...","Olá a todos.

Já há muito que ando para partilhar esta história que se enquadra na perfeição neste fórum. 

Sou um sortudo, confesso. A vida tem-me corrido às mil maravilhas: trabalho em algo que gosto, sou casado, tenho uma família linda. E essa felicidade toda, essa sensação de que ""tudo vai dar certo"", por vezes leva-me a cometer pequenos (grandes) erros de cálculo.

Já confiei que o depósito do carro dava para mais uns quilómetros (não deu, claro). Já achei que o meu ""portunhol"" me safava na Catalunha (não safou). E o meu português gesticulado em Itália bastaria (Nem pensar).

É uma confiança cega que vem de uma série de ""sortes"" acumuladas: carteiras esquecidas que voltam sempre com tudo no sítio, e outras peripécias que me fazem, lá no fundo, acreditar que sou o tipo mais sortudo do mundo.

Mas, como a vida adora uma boa piada, tende a fazer com que nos esqueçamos dos momentos menos bons, a não ser quando é para os partilhar e rir com amigos. 

E foi numa dessas fases boas que me meti em Madrid. Férias em família, Parque Warner, hotel de 4 estrelas… E como bom português, habituado a aproveitar cada cêntimo (e cada buffet de pequeno-almoço), ataquei a mesa como se não houvesse amanhã. 

Ovos mexidos, chocolate quente, iogurte, galão, croissant com queijo e fiambre, pães, sumos, café para respirar, e depois… bolos, churros, fruta, e tudo o que lá estivesse e eu nunca tivesse provado! 

Terminei com o café, claro. Eu sou um patriota que honra as tradições.

Foi então que surgiu aquela ""ligeira"" vontade de ir à casa de banho. Mas era hora de saída, tínhamos planos! ""Aguento, aguento"", pensei eu. 

Entramos no carro, e Madrid, caótica como sempre, decidiu que estacionar seria uma odisseia. A vontade, que era ligeira, começou a acentuar-se. Pernas a tremer, joelhos a bater um no outro, suores frios. Finalmente, um estacionamento, era apertado, mas sou um ás a estacionar, mas cada manobra era uma eternidade de agonia. Preciso urinar.

O carro ficou impecável, mas a bexiga… essa estava à beira da implosão!

Comecei a invocar todos os santos, a procurar um café, uma casa de banho pública, um arbusto onde pudesse aliviar-me. E aqui abro um parêntesis: sou pai desde os 21, sempre tentei ser um exemplo para a minha filha, uma educação alicerçada no diálogo, e gosto de pensar que a minha filha tem orgulho em mim.

Fechado o parêntesis, a busca continuou. 

Avistei uma daquelas *coffee shops* modernas e arranquei como se fosse o Papaléguas. Entro, a minha esposa pede um café, e eu, numa dança hilariante de joelhos juntos e ancas a balançar, pergunto pelo ""aseo"", ""WC"", ""baño"", ""retrete""! A funcionária aponta para um corredor à esquerda. Estou a tremer, as mãos a limpar o suor, a gesticular como quem pede socorro.

E então, a voz inocente da minha filha: ""Pai, também quero ir!"". Desespero total. Vou explodir! Dou a mão à minha pequena e apresso o passo pelo corredor rumo à casa de banho.

A partir daqui, o tempo quase parou. Cada milésimo de segundo era uma eternidade. 

Entro, desaperto o botão dos calções, com a minha filha ao lado. Estou quase lá. 

Eu aponto para uma sanita onde ela podia ir, e eu, a meros centímetros do urinol, com o botão desapertado… 

não aguentei mais. Mijei-me todo.

A minha filha, ao meu lado, ria-se. Ria-se com toda a força.

E eu, em loop: ""E agora? E agora? E agora?"". 

Sem outros calções, uma viagem longa até ao hotel, planos marcados… tudo arruinado. Mas o pior? A minha filha a rir-se. Nada é pior do que ver os calções do pai, que de repente, ganham uma mancha enorme de urina, como se um balão de água tivesse explodido lá dentro.

(Urina a escorrer pelas pernas) Limpei com papel, vezes e vezes sem conta, mas nada melhorava. 

Peguei no bocadinho de dignidade que me restava e assumi: tenho de sair assim. Como a Cersei Lannister na sua caminhada da vergonha, lá segui, calmo, de mão dada à minha pequena filha, em direção à mulher que amo. Os olhos dela ganharam uma forma inesperada, como se quisessem rir, mas por pena e por estarmos em público, mantiveram a postura de solidariedade.

Tomei o café de cabeça erguida, como se nada tivesse acontecido. Saí calmamente e dirigi-me ao carro. 

Sou um homem digno. 

Entrei no carro, acelerei até ao hotel, tomei banho, mudei de roupa e rimo-nos imenso. Mas enquanto as piadas voavam, num ping-pong de frases humilhantes e de como iriam contar isto aos amigos e família. Eu sabia que aquilo que aconteceu naquela casa de banho marcaria para sempre a relação de pai e filha. Fingimos que está tudo igual, mas nós sabemos. 

Nós sabemos… o que ali aconteceu.",7,1752503788.0,HQMC,2,1.0,False

1lzo1em,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypothyroidism/comments/1lzo1em/whats_the_most_natural_commonly_prescribed/,"What's the most ""natural"" commonly prescribed medication for hypothyroidism?","Hi all. So, I am a huge hippie. Like a Birkenstock-wearing, Ani DiFranco/Dave Matthews Band-listening, green lentil-eating, apple cider vinegar-drinking 90's baby hippie. I might be exaggerating a little bit, but you get the idea. I've also had some really negative experiences with pharmaceutical drugs throughout my life. I understand that in some medical circumstances they are necessary and life-saving, but my tendency is to be skeptical/suspicious and have as much info as I can before taking the risk of trying one.

I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism (technically borderline subclinical) and Hashimoto's over this past Spring. I was given Synthroid, because I did have fatigue, weight gain, sluggishness, and a little bit of hair loss going on. HOWEVER I had a horrible reaction to the Synthroid (my dose may have also been too high --  a young inexperienced doctor started me off on 75mcg although I'm sensitive to medications, instead of starting at a baby dose). I ended up in the ER with pretty out-of-control shortness of breath, heart racing, panic attacks. One of the scariest experiences of my life. 

Long story short two endocrinologists I have spoken with recommended Tirosint. They said I may have had a reaction to some of the inactive ingredients in Synthroid, but I'm confused because I didn't have an anaphylactic reaction -- I had side effects that tend to be common for levothyroxine. I'm pretty scared that I'm intolerant to the levo itself rather than whatever weird filler shit they put in Synthroid is.

I got a prior authorization (which took a while) for Tirosint and am debating trying it. It supposedly has pretty much just the pure hormone, with a couple ingredients to make the capsule around it (including gelatin which I don't like/feel weird about) and so it's better for people who might be allergic to other stuff they put in pharmaceuticals.

But I'm really curious about Armour. Isn't it a more natural alternative? The hippie food bible Prescription for Nutritional Healing recommends Armour. It's made from pig thyroid (weird! I know!) rather than being synthetic. BUT the two endos I talked with said they DON'T recommend it. One of them said it's even worse for people who had the kind of reaction I had to Synthroid (the heart racing, feeling like I had drunk 100 cups of coffee, etc). I've also read that it is not generally recommended for pregnant women, since it's harder to regulate or to keep the levels even batch to batch (I may not be expressing this accurately -- hope you know what I mean). I may become pregnant at some point in the next few years, so that concerns me. However even on the Tirosint package it says something like ""This may hurt your unborn child"" in fine print -- very concerning. 

Wondering what y'all's thoughts on this are? I don't like the idea of taking something synthetic. I try to always do the most natural thing when faced with a choice, and Armour seems most natural. However the fact it's not recommended, causes similar side effects, could be uneven for pregnant women, etc all give me pause. I'm honestly pretty scared to try ANYTHING after the experience I had with Synthroid -- but I really do want to feel better and move forward with my life. I want a solution. I WANT MY ENERGY BACK!

I noticed I can't eat the following:  
\-Gluten (diarrhea)  
\-Lactose (headache and other gerd symptoms)  
\-More than 1 egg (usually I will get bloated / headache if i eat more)  
\-Oats or oat milk (makes me bloated)  
\-Soya milk (makes me bloated)

I used to drink coffee/tea but have totally cut it out because of gerd, so normally I just skip breakfast and eat lunch. I also cant eat much fruits because its acidic which in turn trigger gerd too. I notice only carrot, watermelon and mango doesnt trigger my gerd. I have yet to try banana (but I have a feeling I will feel bloated). I started drinking carrot juice for my breakfast to increase my fibre intake but without sugar I have trouble drinking it. With sugary water added to my carrot juice, its much easier but it makes me lethargic the whole day (the sugar itself just trigger my gerd). I swapped to stevia (one with Erythritol in the ingredients) to make my sugary water and I do not feel lethargic anymore but instead I have diarrhea the whole day.

I am trying to find alternative but because of gluten and lactose it just seems impossible to find any. So I am stuck with carrot juice and finding stevia that does not use Erythritol. Any suggestion is appreciated.",1,1752503694.0,GERD,2,0.67,False

Like, if someone is 30, still lives at home with their parents, and is happy doing their pizza delivery job, I'd understand if someone wouldn't want to pursue them. 

But at 40, how much does it matter to most of you? My career path doesn't pay well but I've been doing it for years, I'm good at it, and it's secure. I make enough to keep my child fed and happy. I pay my bills. I rent an apartment and I've accepted that my career won't ever be enough to own a home, and I'm personally fine with renting an apartment. Some might consider that not having ambition, but to me, I consider it comfortable. 

I also know that if/when I find a partner, we will eventually want to get a place together, so we will be able to afford something better because we'll likely be splitting bills (or ""I pay rent/mortgage, you pay utilities"")

I personally have no issue dating someone who makes coffee for a living, or is a waitress. As long we have a connection and they're able to provide for their kids (I only date parents) and can pay their bills, that's all I care about.

There was a “shoot” in his eyes. General Coffee and Major Reid placed themselves between him. The troops stared at the trio. Old Hickory croaked out an oath. The first man who advanced to Tennessee would get a bullet through the brain.
Minutes passed. No one moved. No man had the courage to tempt the “shoot” in Jackson’s eyes. Then a few loyal companies formed behind their general to block the road. And that did it. Several mutineers returned to their post. More followed. The remainder of the brigade saw the hopelessness of their situation and backed away.

* Cooking (but not eating lol, protein > flavor)
* Video Games (played on Xbox from 5-14 then switched to PC ever since, have almost 600 games on Steam and a newly built PC so we almost def can find something to play)
* Music (let's do some spotify jams together!)
* Movies/Shows (let's watch stuff together and overanalyze every detail lol)

More niche interests:

* (Non-alcoholic) Drink Brewing (used to brew freshly-ground coffee but stopped because it made my anxiety worse but I can still talk about it; currently make tea with my favorites being matcha, green tea, and chamomile; trying to get into juice-pressing atm)
* Psychology (I have a habit of repeatedly looking up things about my personality I don't like, finding what trauma caused it, and changing my thoughts for a better me tomorrow)
* Meditation and Journaling (can't stress enough about how much these improved my life)

Trying to get into (would appreciate if you could show me the ropes):

* Learning Spanish (beautiful language imo)
* Photography (help me take better selfies lol)
* Game Development (I have a Computer Science degree that's unused other than some small personal projects 😭)

If any of this sounds interesting to you, please send me a chat with your discord username, what part(s) of this post interested you, which time(s) you wanna chat, and anything about yourself you feel comfortable sharing with an internet stranger.

Me (30m) was told by my sister that i should date her friend (25f) and she told her friend the same thing about me. My sister hyped me up to her, and her to me. We both did the whole “scroll the insta”, found mutual attraction, and i slipped into her dm’s and got her number. We’ve made GREAT convo only over a week in. Making jokes, light flirting, sending numerous texts, getting to know eachother, etc. we have similar humor and all together its felt effortless honestly. She seems like she’s genuinely interested in getting to know me, and she confided the same thing about me to my sister. I asked her out on a coffee date and she agreed. Things felt like they were headed in a good direction.

Her, my sister, and a friend went out of town on a spontaneous girls trip. We still texted off and on. Just giving me fun updates of what they’re up to. She says “FYI we’re going to a nightclub, be prepared for funny pictures!” And i said “funny pictures are welcome!” Received pictures of her with my sister having fun. Texted me later saying they made it back safely.

My sister texted me saying that at the nightclub, while they were lounging with their drinks (they only had one drink), a guy came over and inserted himself into the group, started flirting with the girl, she welcomed it, and made out on the couch for a few minutes right in front of my sister and her friend. Guy got up, and walked away. The rest of the night, the girl was saying “gosh i can’t believe i did that” and “i should be in jail” type of comments. She still texted me like normal the next day, asking genuine questions about my family and getting to know me. My sister told me what happened the day after. She was irritated at her for doing that.

Let me be clear and say that i’m aware she has no obligation to me. We’re not officially dating, we’re just getting to know eachother. I’m just disappointed. It’s one thing if she went on a casual coffee date with another guy, but making out with a total stranger is another. I know people make mistakes and all that …i just don’t quite know what to do or think. Idk what she’s thinking either… whether its a bit of guilt… or none at all.

But here's the real magic, especially for those *delicate* family situations: the **PCC structure**. What's PCC? It's like having a wise, old Hoca (teacher/scholar) overseeing your assets, ensuring they're protected by an invisible evil eye 🧿, always accessible, and ready for whatever life throws your way – from a new business venture to passing on your legacy. 📜🤝

Let me tell you about my 'auntie's neighbor's cousin,' Cem. Cem's family owned a beloved, generations-old spice shop in the Grand Bazaar. 🌶️🌿 His grandfather, a shrewd businessman, had quietly diversified some family funds into shiny crypto investments over the years. When the time came for the old man to rest, Cem braced himself for what could only be described as a full-blown family council meeting, complete with passionate arguments over every single kuruş and digital coin! 🗣️💸

Inheritance in Turkey can sometimes be... *lively*. You know, the kind where distant relatives suddenly remember they're related, and everyone has an opinion on how the assets should be divided. Cem imagined endless paperwork, squabbles, and perhaps even a few dramatic fainting spells. 🎭

But here's where Cem's grandfather (or perhaps Cem's smart suggestion!) had a stroke of genius. He had wisely set up the family's digital assets through Echo Exchange, leveraging their incredible PCC structure. When it came time for the inheritance, instead of a chaotic market brawl, it was surprisingly… peaceful. 🕊️

The PCC structure meant Grandpa's digital assets were clearly documented, easily verifiable, and could be seamlessly transferred to the rightful heirs with minimal fuss. No endless arguments over who gets the Bitcoin that was bought when it was ""just a few liras,"" no suspicious relatives trying to sneak away with the digital gold. 🤫

Cem was stunned! 😮 ""No endless phone calls to foreign institutions? No fighting over crypto keys? No family drama that lasts longer than a Turkish soap opera?"" He just shook his head in disbelief. The family, for once, was united in their pleasant surprise, enjoying fresh tea and baklava instead of bickering. 🥳🍰

So, whether you're building your wealth like a magnificent mosque, planning for your family's future, or simply want to ensure your legacy is handled with grace and ease, Echo Exchange and their PCC structure are truly a blessing for Turks. It's like having a digital guardian angel ensuring everything runs as smoothly as a well-oiled lokum machine! ⚙️🍬

No more financial headaches, just prosperity and peace of mind! 🚀🌟

**Disclaimer:** This is a fictional story for illustrative purposes and is not a true account. However, the benefits of streamlined financial management and asset protection offered by services like Echo Exchange and their PCC structure *could* make such a smooth process a reality!

The number one thing that contributes to weight gain, in my observations, seems to be any type of sugary/high calorie drink, such as sodas, iced coffees; beer, etc. 

Water serves its purpose. It’s the best drink. Cut out sugary drinks/alcohol,  and you will have solved half the problem. Sugary drinks provide little to no nutritional benefit. Empty calories and the easiest way to gain weight. 

Some healthier alternatives would be black coffee, maybe a home made fruit smoothie with milk or water (instead of processed juice), cutting out sodas completely (Soda is the worst- tell yourself there’s absolutely no benefit), and even drinking spirits instead of beer. 

I understand people might have cravings toward these types of drinks but you have to have the willpower to stop yourself. No one said it was going to be easy 

Edit - I never said that this was the only factor to losing weight. There are many. Or that diet sodas are bad. Everything you drink should have a purpose, such as nutrition, caffeine or hydration. This is most optimal for the human body. ",0,1752503142.0,loseit,50,0.25,False

Oh and on mobile, so formatting will probably be terrible.


A bit of background. I'm 33F and got my autism and high IQ (142) diagnosis when I was 25. Because I didn't know about my autism, I lived life like any other girl my age. Went to college, partied, was generally an outgoing happy person. I was a bit 'weird' socially but my partner and friends loved me for me, so no problems there. Until everything came crashing down 10 years ago. From one day to the next, my body refused. I thought I had the flu, but I didn't recover. I couldn't keep food down, lost 15 kg in a month, effectively making me underweight, and everything was too much. Hospitals and tests followed, all with the same conclusion: you're healthy, nothing is wrong with you. I got into a program for people with unexplained physical issues, where we did group therapy. For the first time in my life I was mixing with people of all ages and all intellects. And I did NOT fit in. The psychiatrist there suspected I was on the spectrum and after tests I got my results: high IQ and Aspergers. And I'm a girl, so getting those diagnoses was rare and a success of its own. The general consensus after that was autistic burnout which was handled incorrectly (since we didn't know about my autism), turned chronic.

Since then, my body has not recovered. I can't work for more than 2 hours a day, and grocery shopping is hard. I can't see my friends for more than an hour and they have to visit me. I can't go to them, because I had a completely traumatizing meltdown in the car which I'm still working through, so no car rides for me currently. On top of all that, my therapist retired and I probably won't get a new one before May 2026. As you can imagine, my world is small.

My husband is my rock and protector in all this and I would not be able to do this without him. He makes me braver than I am.

Now for my family. Tomorrow is my birthday, but I'm not really celebrating because it's too much. My brother is also sickly, so we hardly see each other now, but he mentioned that he and my dad had a gift for me and if it would be possible for them to stop by for a bit and drop it off. It's been a challenging month, so I agreed on the premise that they would stay no longer than an hour. They visited me this afternoon, and it was lovely. They were on time, which is rare with my dad, but he knows how much it helps me to plan these things so he really tries to help me.

Cue my mother. She and my dad divorced 15 years ago, but are cordial.
While I was preparing to ask my brother and dad to leave, the doorbell rings. It's my mom. Unannounced, no heads up, just there. ""I figured I'd drop by since tomorrow is your birthday, and if it's too much I'll just go."" Yes, it's too much. Her showing up unannounced already made it too much and makes me spiral. So I told her that my battery for the day was already empty, so thank you for the flowers but please leave again. She did, but now I'm spiraling and my brother and dad see this, take their cue and leave. Told me they understood and that they had a nice time. But the goodbyes were rushed and that happy feeling I had of seeing them is completely replaced by anxiety.

My mom does these things when she thinks it would be a nice surprise. I've had it out with her over the years that for me, a surprise is never nice. To be able to barely function I need to plan my days, surprise is not in my working vocab. Last time I visited her for coffee, her step-grandchild was there. The kid is 2,5 so cute but a small wrecking ball. Didn't see the need to mention this to me, figured I'd be fine. That this 2,5 year old's screaming would trigger me never occurred to her. That doing these things sets back my recovery by weeks if I'm lucky, months if I'm not.
She just doesn't get it, and is annoyed and sad that I keep my distance nowadays. I love her, but her inability or refusal to understand just makes me angry but mostly sad.

End of rant, thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

Why is it that some of us get labeled “jowa material”? The kind of person who’s supposed to be dateable, lovable, relationship-worthy and yet somehow, we remain undated, unloved, and perpetually single?

I’ve opened myself to the possibilities. Swiped right on hope. Said yes to coffee. Laughed at the right moments. I’ve made eye contact across crowded rooms. I’ve flirted. I’ve waited. I’ve wondered. And still, nothing.

Was it something I said? Or worse… something I am?

Friends tell me I’m cute. Some even say I’m pogi. On good days, I’ve been called a catch. The kind who deserves a real shot at love. And yet, no one ever invites me past the first drink.

So why does it always stop before it even starts?

Maybe it’s the way I look. Or maybe it’s the way I’m seen. A subtle, but brutal difference.

So there I was, alone in bed, scrolling through couple selfies, anniversary posts, and proposal videos, and I had to ask myself:

If I’m really relationship material, why do I always feel like a rough draft that never gets picked up again?

Maybe the real heartbreak isn’t being single.

If my father were going to leave me the house, of course, he’d leave his stain on it. In this situation, the stain was literal, ash black cement in the centre of the basement marking where he took his last gurgling breath. The sickly-sweet smell of him lingered. The single air freshener I had packed wouldn’t do, and I’d have to go into town eventually, no matter how much I dreaded it.  

The basement had been the first place I checked. I ended a call with my older brother, one of my many relatives who thought they were more deserving of the house, as I made my way down the plank wood stairs.

Now looking at the burnt smear in the centre of the room, too deeply marked for even the local cleaner to scrub away, I imagined I was the only one of my family who could stomach it.

I would have to find a rug to cover it up, and I hoped that there was a spare somewhere in the house. If not, it’d be an hour driving into the nearest non-hick town to try and find one, and I’d done enough driving for today.

*This part of my father would have to stay in the house*. *For now*.

The rest of the house lifted my spirits. The familiar birdsong greeted me as I crested the stairs. Some of the only fond memories of my childhood were accompanied by those noises.

Dark mahogany floorboards and bookshelf walls in every room. What was contained in the books I couldn’t tell, recognizing some more recent purchases, but with the majority being in other languages, I did not know. The smell of old books and their leather-bound covers was enough for me.

The fireplace sat squat on the wall opposingly.  So close to the musty kindling surrounding it. I probably wouldn’t be lighting any fires for a bit anyways. It would seem in poor taste, no matter how I felt.

The family home seemed right out of a movie set in the Victorian Age. From outside, the crimson panelling and gray rooftop meant the building looked best when under a gloom. The large, rounded turret at the corner of the manor, stretching a story higher into the sky and tipped with a pointed spike, only accentuated this feeling.

And despite all that, and even though I had not seen it in seventeen years, I felt more comfortable than I had ever been in it before. With only myself.

My phone rang again, ripping me out of my moment of peace.

“Hey sis—“

“What the actual fuck Thomas,” Emma snapped, cutting me off.

Honestly, that was better than the insults or threats I had been receiving from the others.

“I know none of us were close, but I at least sent cards. You never reached out, not once.”

“I don’t think birthday cards qualify you for real estate, Emma,” I said, sharper than I meant it to be.

“Thomas.”

To be fair, I didn’t have an answer for her.

“I honestly don’t know Emma,” I sighed, pacing through the house. “Maybe, it was one last middle finger to us. Maybe he grew a heart. Or maybe he just picked me right before lighting himself on fire. Whichever it is, I don’t know.”

“So, what’re you going to do with the place?” she asked. “If you’re planning on giving it up, at least give me first dibs.”

“Will do, sis.” I had made my way to the kitchen window that looked into the backyard. “I have some stuff I have to figure out first.”

I looked out the window. The fresh patch of dirt at the far end of the yard had my attention, and I flashed it the finger.

*Why me?*

*\*\*\**

Unpacking came next. I hadn’t brought too much, just the essentials, but even that took me the rest of the afternoon. My speaker comforted me, with the screaming and strumming of the bass guitar keeping me company. Still, it had taken me well into dusk to get it in a state that I could fall asleep with.

Turning down the music to prepare myself for bed, I heard it. Knocking. I didn’t know if I just hadn’t heard it before or if it had begun as I lowered the volume, but there was someone knocking on the front door. I checked the clock quickly: 8:47 pm.

It was gentle, polite despite the hour. After two minutes of its persistence, I realized whoever was out there wasn’t going to be leaving on their own. They had heard the music. They knew I was home. Maybe they were coming to give a noise complaint.

Whatever. It would take five minutes to sort out. Teary-eyed grief or a smile and a chuckle of misunderstanding would keep it short. I strode towards the door, preparing, and realized the lack of a peephole. In fact, there weren’t any windows around the door. The thick lacquered door obscured everything about who was on the other side. I would have to open it to check.

Crocodile tears on the edge of my eyes, I opened the door.

“Oh,” was all that she said at first. She hadn’t expected me to answer. Maybe not like that. Her wrinkled hand was still awkwardly raised at the door, holding something made from sticks. The other held a Tupperware container with what looked like lasagna inside.  

There were two of them,

The woman, dressed in a knit sweater, was stood right at the door. So close that I almost bumped into her.

The man, whom I assumed was her husband, was further back. Staying off the porch, down the steps, looking off at something further down the dark road.

“How can I help you?” I asked, wiping my eyes.

“Sorry to intrude,” she started. Her tone was gentle; I imagined in hopes of comforting me. “I’m Linda, and this is my husband, Paul,” gesturing at the man further down the stairs.

I realized this would take a bit longer. “Is there anything I can do for you?” I asked. “Was the music too loud? I’m done for the night anyway.”

“Nothing of the sort. We just wanted to do our neighbourly duty and introduce ourselves.”

“Well, it’s appreciated, thank you,” I said. Food was another thing that I would have to go into town for. I waited for Linda to hand over the lasagna, but she didn’t.

“You don’t look like how I expected. Nothing like your father.”

The dyed black hair and piercings helped that.

Her husband, Paul, finally spoke. “Be respectful, Linda. He’s his father's son, no matter how he looks.” His eyes were still focused elsewhere.

“No offence taken,” I said with a smile. If anything, what Paul said was worse.

“Apologies, Thomas. Paul’s right, you’re to be respected. In any case, here you go,” she said, handing over the lasagna and the strange bundle of sticks. “Do with it what should be done.”

After a few more long minutes of pleasantries, Linda turned, and the two of them made their way back down the rural road in the direction of what I assumed was their home.

Inspecting the sticks, I saw that it was intertwined with vines. Hair woven in. A bird, maybe? I had no idea what was to be done with the thing. I also realized I didn’t remember ever introducing myself to Linda.

\*\*\*

The couch wasn’t comfortable, but it had been the only option. Anything that could generously be considered my room was repurposed, and my father’s master bedroom was out of the question. So, the couch it had been.

I made myself a coffee and started to plan the day. Town was inevitable. There was a handful of things I would need if I had any intention of staying here, and I had just eaten through the last of my meager rations. The inevitability of speaking with a local was also very real and if Linda, Paul, and my faint memories were anything to go on I wasn’t enthused.

The question of how long I could survive if I never left the house flittered to my mind. If the water worked, surely, I could get past the first few days. Food would be another issue, but I’d been resourceful in the past. Other than that, what else? Shelter was easy. Warmth was easy. Social Interaction?

It was stupid. The deeper question was how long until I’d have to interact with people like my father. *In a perfect world, never*, I thought. Still, I grabbed my car keys and locked the door behind me. It was a nice thought.

Calling it a town was generous. The most interesting building was a crafts store, its exterior adorned with birdhouses and other handcrafted knick-knacks. Other than that, the place sucked. There was no church, no cemetery, no history. Thankfully, there was a liquor store because, of course, there was.

The gas station doubled as a general store simply called Clark’s. It supplied the residents with the necessities, and now that I technically fall under that description, it would do the same for me.

The middle-aged cashier, whom I assumed was The Clark, lit up seeing me.

“Thomas! An honour”

*Was this going to be a thing?*

“Nice to meet you too,” I said, walking through the store. Trying to pick out what I needed, Clark took my silence as an invitation to speak.

“I think it’s a damn good thing. You coming here.  Not the store I mean, the town,” he said, laughing. I meanwhile focused on the fact that the candles were tucked at the back of the shelf, having not been restocked.

“Your father was a great man. Big shoes to fill, I reckon. It’s a tragedy what happened to him, but that’s the life of people in his position. Always a tragedy.”

Now that was funny. However, I realized, listening to Clark speak, I didn’t know exactly what my father did. From what I remembered, our family had been entrenched in the community. In what way, I didn’t actually know.

I decided that Clark might be the perfect person to ask.

“So, what exactly did my father do for a living?”

For the first time since meeting me, Clark went silent.

“What do you mean?”

“Aside from the obvious,” I said, chuckling. “I hadn’t seen him in a while and wanted to know how he spent his last days.”

“Oh,” Clark said, seemingly appeased. “Well, your father was taken care of by the community, rest assured. By our Lord as well. He kept up.”

Realizing something, Clark quickly fished around under the counter and fetched a small wooden object.

“Could I give this to you now?” he said, handing me the carving.

Looking it over in my hand, it was another bird. It had been whittled out of wood, stained dark with something that flaked off in brown pieces. Long stringy hair, I hoped from an animal, had been attached to the head.

“Save me the trouble of going to yours,” Clark said.

I looked him in the eyes. It didn’t seem I had a choice.

“Thanks, and don’t worry about paying. On the house.”

Halfway down the road, I opened the car window and threw it. Whatever my father had been up to, I wasn’t participating.

I reached the front steps of the house, birdsong filling my ears and the smell of burning filling my nose. I would be searching the house top to bottom and intended on figuring out what was going on, but my foot was blocked.

*That’s where the candles went*, I thought. Small crafts were littered in front of my door, all like the ones Clark and Linda had given me. Dozens of bundles of sticks, vines, hair, and feathers were spread. Some were hanging from the porch roof; most were arranged in circles. Wax candles were melting onto the wood, and bowls of dried bread covered the porch.

“Fuck,” I muttered, brushing past it to the kitchen to fetch a garbage bag. As I entered, I saw something even more concerning. The patch of dirt at the far end of the yard was no longer a patch. It was a hole. A deep, open grave.

Someone had dug him up.

Fuck.

\*\*\*

Three months before my father kicked us out of the house, I remembered when we had moved in, and I first saw the house. I remembered seeing the study, and how I called it a tower.

“It’s called a turret. If it’s in a house it’s a turret,” my father said.

“Like a gun?”

“It’s a homonym,” he said, eyes unwavering from the road ahead.

I didn’t really get it, but decided he was probably right.

“I like it,” I said. “Can you put my bed up there?” Emma whined from the back seat. “It’s a princess tower! It should be mine!”

“It’s actually a homonym,” I said, looking toward my father.

“It was your grandfather’s office, and I’m planning on continuing that,” he said, eyes still focused ahead.

And for most of my time in the house, that was the most I ever knew about my father’s office at the top of the turret. He worked at the top of the spiralling staircase every day. Forbidding us from ever going up there, even in an emergency. At seven years old I did not have the words or knowledge to call it neglect, so I called it working.

Over the next three months, he spent most of his time up there working. The scarce times he came out, were mostly for the basics. Feeding us, telling us if we were being too loud, etc. The exception was once a month when he would leave in the morning to head into town. 

On these days he would be gone for the entire day, and my siblings and I would take advantage of this fact. Playing games outside our rooms or playing hide and seek across the entire house.

I had only dared wait to see my father return a couple of times, staying up far past my bedtime. On those rare occasions, I would hear him drag all the boxes and garbage bags past my room, up the stairs, and into his office. Even rarer, I only ever waited at the bottom of my bedroom door once, peeking through the small crack to catch a glimpse of what he was doing. Three months after we had first moved in. My last day in the house.

It was hot. The whippoorwills and woodcocks called, through the humid summer heat, making me feel as if I was suffocating. Birdsong filled my ears, while the hot air choked my lungs. 

The day had been unremarkable otherwise, with none of my siblings having any motivation to play in the heat. So, I was bored. And with that boredom, I decided that I was going to figure out what my father went into town to get once a week, even if it was just a peek.

So, I waited, fighting against everything to stay awake. After what seemed like hours, my effort finally paid off, and my father returned. I watched him slowly drive down the long gravel driveway and roll to a stop at the front of the house.

He hefted the garbage bag from the bed of the truck with what looked like considerable effort and quickly maneuvered to the front door. Once he was inside, I silently crept to the bottom of my door. It was only a couple of seconds before I heard him again. He had given up on carrying the bag, now dragging it behind him down the hall.

It felt like forever. Crouched on the hard wooden floorboards with my face pressed painfully against the edge of the door, it couldn’t have been more than a few seconds. And as I saw my father shuffle into my view, dragging the black garbage bag behind him that long awful moment stretched even longer.

My father passed by my view, his leather shoes wet and slick. Then came the garbage bag, black and taunt. Its contents bulged out from inside it, begging the plastic to tear and release it from my father. As time seemed to slow, the bag stared back at me. Or whatever was in the bag did.

My father was not alone though.  After his leather shoes and the bag, next came his guest. Bare feet, wrinkled and muddy, walked calmly after him. Each toenail lay atop a layer of dirt and fungus, following my father without regard for what I had seen.

Then, as that eternity ended and the nightmare squelched out of my view, I noticed what my father and his guest had left behind. Blood. A long smear followed him up the turret and into his study. 

I never went to bed after that, and before I could run away or tell the police that my dad was a murderer, I was kicked out at only seven years old. Sent to live with a far-off aunt. Only reconnecting with my siblings years later and learning they had similar fates. Each of them sent away to different branches of the family tree. 

Now, staring out the window, seeing his grave excavated I had confirmation that what I saw was real. That something about the house — my father — was wrong.

I knew what I had to do. Grabbing the garbage bags from the kitchen, I went back to the porch, propped open the door, and started roughly sweeping and spilling all the “gifts” I had received from my neighbours into them.  In my seventeen years away from home, I’d never been one for religion, but I respected it. However, this was different. Whatever cult my father had been a part of, and had now dragged me into, I was not going to be a part of it.

Spilling the bag’s contents into the fireplace, I knew I wouldn’t need to search for where my father had stored the kindling. Instantly, and almost eagerly, the fire engulfed the various dreamcatchers, idols, and effigies. 

That was the first problem addressed and if any neighbours keen to espouse their faith came along when I was at home, that problem would be addressed too. Violently if required. The problem of my father miraculously deciding to come back from hell and make my life worse was another. I walked to the end of the property where the grave now sat empty and waiting, the woods that surrounded the edges full of loud birdsong and calls.

Where first I had expected shovels, boot prints, and a clean excavation, what now sat in front of me was far more worrying.

It wasn’t clean. Nothing about it was clean. Not unlike the front porch, the grave was cluttered. Feathers and splintered wood surrounded it on all sides. The hole was equally weird. It was open sure but unlike a grave you’d find in a cemetery. It wasn’t neat or orderly, but rough and jagged. Instead of the dirt being piled next to the hole, the walls drifted in.

As if it wasn’t someone digging down to reach my father, but my father digging up to escape the earth. The last thing that caught my eye pushed me over the edge.

Ashen footprints, burned into the grass crawled out from the hole. Walking towards the woods.

*Nope.*

I only saw two options. One: Linda, Paul, Clark, and probably the rest of the town were insane. Or two: my father had decided to make a posthumous appearance at the family reunion in all his burnt awfulness. Not that those two were mutually exclusive. I was pretty sure that Linda would make me into a pot pie for the next of my siblings to inherit the house if given the opportunity.

Still, I didn’t exactly like either option. I wouldn’t be walking into any giant burning wooden statues or seeing my father again any time soon if I had it my way.

The house was probably safe. And the study had answers. 

*I could leave now. Pack my stuff, rip out the driveway, and never come back.*

I went back inside and up the staircase.

*I have to see it.*

\*\*\*

There were no taxidermied heads on the shelves. No obvious bloody pentagrams on the floor. All things considered, I might have almost felt disappointed. Seventeen years of expectations and it looked like a normal study.

Like the rest of the house, every wall of the circular room was lined with bookshelves. There were a few end tables with lamps and knickknacks on them, and a couch, but in the middle of the room was a large wooden desk.

Desk was the wrong word. It might’ve been one once, but it seemed to have been repurposed into something else. Cleared of everything to allow for space, old dark stains and deep gouges covered the surface. The red stains flowed from the table onto the floorboards, and I saw that the entire room was similarly marked. I then realized, it wasn’t just the floor and the desk. Every inch of wood was bloodstained, deepened to a dark brown with age. 

On the desk remained only one thing: a single sheet of paper. Written on it in heavy, dried ink were a few words. It wasn’t long, only a couple sentences, but that didn’t mean each word didn’t stretch on.

*“Your great-great-great-grandfather fed it first. He found it in the woods, and it gave him miracles. So, it was only fair when he gave it himself and his family. That was the deal. We feed it; it feeds on us. Now it is your turn.*

*Starve it, Thomas. Let it starve. If not for me, for you. For your family who comes next. 17 years it has starved. I sent you away so it would. And now I bring you back so it will. I will let it starve in me and in you.”*

I didn’t touch the note. It would’ve felt wrong. Had he kicked us out to protect us? Was he just corrupted by whatever it was he was trying to feed?

A part of me wanted deep down to believe my father was a good man. To take this note and the cult as a sign he was manipulated. Or maybe he was just awful. Selfish enough to sacrifice his son to achieve his goal. Enough of a bastard to move us to a deathtrap cult.

Still, the blazing fireplace full of offerings and my dad's recent return to the land of the living were damning. I knew something strange was going on, and no matter my opinions of the man, he was warning me. 

As much as it pained me to agree with him, I would stay. If only for a small while.

\*\*\*

The garbage bag of meat, bread, and various crafts made from human detritus landed at the far end of the study. I bent over in the middle trying to catch my breath. If I had anything positive to look forward to, the developing six-pack from my daily workout of lugging the offerings up the tower was it. 

I looked across the room at my two weeks of work. The pile had easily grown as tall as me. Every day, multiple times a day, my neighbours would make their deliveries. At first, it was much of the same: home-cooked meals, rotting meat, and handcrafted idols.

The longer my charade continued, however, the more things escalated. From what I had heard in our brief interactions, small unfortunes were happening around town. Power outages, crop failures, personal injuries, and even deaths in the family. All were placed upon me. And with that, more serious offerings. Freshly butchered livestock, home-cooked casserole, and family heirlooms. Someone had even brought their three-year-old son. I was able to convince them to change their mind on that one. Barely.

I looked again at the blasphemous pile. I would have to figure out some other place to store the junk they kept giving me. The basement would work, but the smell hadn’t departed yet. Eerily, that wasn’t the only place I’d smelled it. On the few days, I’d left the house or opened a window, I could catch it on the wind. I’d stopped opening and started locking the windows after that.

As I descended the turret, I looked out the windows absentmindedly and my heart dropped. Paying attention, I could hear the birdsong from my childhood again. Now though, I knew its source.

Chances were, Linda and Paul were outside. I thought I could see Clark. I couldn’t see all of him, but someone who looked his size was kneeling in the long grass surrounding the manor. Even if it wasn’t him, dozens of others were arranged similarly around the house.

Every window I passed going down the turret, quickened my descent. I could see someone outside each one. Some had their hands stretched into the sky, others bowed low to the ground. It had to be the entire town. They had made a circle. A wall around the house. They were all singing in birdsong.

I sprinted down the stairs. If they got in, I had no idea what they’d do to me. All I knew was that they were crazy enough for me to be worried. 

The back door was locked, I remember that, same with the windows. The front door though, I couldn’t remember. As I exited the turret and bolted down the hall, I prayed with everything I had that I locked it.

Turning the corner and placing my hand on the brass door handle, for a single second I was filled with relief. It was locked.

Knock Knock.

The door handle slowly turned in my hand. It was imperceptible, so slow that to tell someone was trying to get it, you would have to feel it twisting dreadfully in your hand. And I did. Whoever was turning the handle had the strength of the world, a force of nature

Again, it came. Knock knock knock.

The scent of the basement seeped from beneath the door. Fresh now, the sickly-sweet odour hurt my nose. Its noxious rancid smoke bringing tears to my eyes with its foulness. I panicked for a second trying to find the peephole to see the other side and remembered it didn’t exist. I was blind to whatever was behind the door.

Knock knock.

I had to get out of here. That was a long shot though, even with a plan. Lucky for me, I could feel one forming. I prepared myself.

It was twilight when I was ready. The boarded windows, not even allowing moonlight inside. I unlocked the front door and bolted. Running back across the now dark house.

My childhood bedroom door was already open; I couldn’t waste any time. Closing it behind me, I squatted to the floor. The summer heat hotter than any night in my childhood. The birdsong so much louder now than any time before. I waited for my guest.

The door opened. I could hear the footsteps slowly shuffling down the hallway. Passing the door in a few seconds, I only caught a glimpse of the feet. Burnt and charred, leaving blackened prints. Then they were gone, right up the stairs. He knew the way.

As soon as they were up the turret, I bolted out of my room locking the front door. Placing my steps carefully in the few bare spots of the floor not littered with books. If I went any faster, I’d slip on the gasoline.

I lit the fireplace.

The living room went up in flames immediately. The explosion of heat sent me flying across the room, hitting my head on the far wall.

Stars filled my view. Every inch of the old house was ablaze. Embers drifted onto me, burning my skin and threatening to ignite my clothes. It was hard to hear over the roar of the fire, but the birdsong had stopped, now replaced by furious knocks from every wall of the house.

The windows shattered, whether from the heat inside or my neighbours outside.  The boards held though, and any attempts at breaking through were stopped with the lick of flames. He wasn’t leaving the house. He was going to burn. I’d finish my father’s work.

Smoke burned my lungs. The room was filling with nowhere for it to go. I choked on the heat, coughing as I blindly stumbled through the house towards my escape route. I hoped with the frenzy of fire, I would be able to slip out unnoticed. If not, I’d fight my way through. Then, I heard it. Through the roar of flame and collapsing of home, it was deafening in comparison.

His footsteps echoed down the stairs. I stabilized myself and waited as he descended.

Seventeen years ago, when he had kicked me out, he had never said anything to me. He had never said goodbye. I hadn’t either.

I didn’t even remember what the last words I had said to him were.

Silhouette vague from the inferno around him, I took his form in. The fire and smoke didn’t allow for much visibility, but I could see parts of him. He was burnt. Some of that from when he was alive, some from whatever he was now. One of his arms had fallen off, the waxy fat dripping to the floor in clumps. An alien limb had grown in its place. A small skinny thing with hardened skin ending in four digits, each pointed with a talon. Small needles of burnt away feathers grew out of his flesh. 

I couldn’t see my father’s face. The smoke and heat obscured it. I could tell it was changed. No longer human, but still unrecognizably my father.

I smiled. Not for him. Not really.

I said nothing.
