I‚Äôve been working in corporate data and analytics for 6 years at a few large companies, but recently I built something a little different in my spare time ‚Äî a tool called Business Insights Pro that I originally made to help my girlfriend understand her Etsy store performance.

Her shop is on the smaller side, but the tool has really helped her see what‚Äôs selling, where customers are coming from, and which products bring in the most revenue. Now, I‚Äôd like to test it with larger datasets from other Etsy shops to make sure it works for sellers of all sizes.

I‚Äôm looking for 5 - 10 Etsy sellers who are willing to share their store data (CSV exports from Etsy). 

In return, I‚Äôll give you:
	‚Ä¢	A full, professional data analysis of your store‚Äôs performance (the same level of detail I do at work ‚Äî totally free)
	‚Ä¢	If you don‚Äôt want the analysis, I can also send you a coffee gift card as a thank-you for helping me test the tool

If you‚Äôre interested, just comment below or DM me and I can explain exactly what data I‚Äôd need and how I‚Äôll keep it private.

# Best Chocolate Rum of 2025: Expert Reviews & Buying Guide

Chocolate rum stands out as a luxurious and versatile spirit, perfect for sipping neat, mixing into cocktails, or adding a decadent twist to desserts. The market for chocolate rum has exploded in recent years, with a diverse range of offerings from established distilleries and craft producers alike. This guide aims to navigate the landscape, presenting our top picks for 2025 after rigorous testing and analysis, along with a comprehensive buying guide to help you choose the best chocolate rum for your palate and budget. We'll delve into the unique characteristics of each rum, explore their key features, and provide expert recommendations.

## Key Features Analysis

The best chocolate rums boast a harmonious blend of rich cocoa notes and the inherent characteristics of the rum itself. Several key features distinguish the top contenders in this category.

**Chocolate Infusion Method:** The method of infusing the rum with chocolate substantially impacts the final product. Some distilleries use natural cocoa beans or nibs during distillation or aging, while others employ chocolate extracts or syrups. The use of natural ingredients generally results in a more complex and nuanced flavor profile,although well-crafted extracts can also deliver excellent results.

The ideal chocolate rum uses a process that allows the chocolate flavor to meld seamlessly with the rum's natural profile without overpowering it. Methods that involve aging or allowing the flavors to integrate over time tend to produce a superior product compared to those relying solely on artificial flavorings.

**Rum Base Quality:** The quality of the rum base is paramount.A well-aged rum with notes of caramel, vanilla, and spice provides a solid foundation for the chocolate flavor, creating a rich and layered experience. Rums made from molasses or sugarcane juice each offer distinct profiles,contributing to the overall complexity.Selecting a premium rum base is critical to achieving the desired end product which is a balance of rum character and chocolate flavor. The higher-quality the rum, the better the chocolate notes will showcase and the more the consumer will enjoy the end result.

**Sweetness Level:** Chocolate rums vary in sweetness, ranging from dry and intensely cocoa-forward to sweet and dessert-like. The ideal sweetness level depends on personal preference and intended use.Dry chocolate rums are excellent for sophisticated cocktails, while sweeter varieties are perfect for after-dinner sipping or drizzling over ice cream.

The perceived sweetness level should enhance the chocolate and rum flavors, not mask them. The best chocolate rums achieve a perfect equilibrium, allowing the inherent qualities of each ingredient to shine through.

**Alcohol Content (ABV):** The alcohol by volume (ABV) plays a role in the rum's intensity and warmth. Higher ABV rums tend to have a bolder flavor profile, while lower ABV rums are smoother and more approachable. The optimal ABV for a chocolate rum depends on the desired drinking experience.

The chocolate-rum balance is imperative and ABV contributes to the experience.Typically, ABV ranges between 30-40% and the higher end of the range delivers a more robust flavor and allows for usage in cocktails or as an after-dinner sipping rum. Lower ABV will lean towards chocolate liqueur and restrict versatile usage.

**Ingredient Sourcing and Transparency:** Reputable brands prioritize high-quality ingredients and transparency in their production processes. Knowing the origin of the cocoa beans and sugarcane used in the rum can provide valuable insights into the product's character and ethical sourcing.

An ideal chocolate rum is made with high quality ingredients and has transparent sourcing. The origin of the rum base and the original of the chocolate ingredients will determine the complexity and the balance of the final result.

 A high quality rum
 Aged rum base
 Natural chocolate flavors
 Balanced sweetness

She‚Äôd cancel plans last minute, say I didn‚Äôt love her, tell me to ‚Äúfind someone else,‚Äù then get upset when I didn‚Äôt show up. When I tried to open up emotionally, she‚Äôd threaten to leave.

She wouldn‚Äôt let me meet her family, take pictures together, or arrive early when we had plans. Sometimes she suggested I download dating apps‚Ä¶ only for me to later find her on those apps after we broke up.

There were sweet moments  holding hands at the movies, cuddling, little gifts  but they were always followed by sudden coldness, talk of breaking up, or jealousy games.

Even during hard times (like when I was robbed), she barely checked on me. And when I finally ended things, she cried, blocked me, said I ‚Äúsent her to a mental clinic,‚Äù then called later saying she missed me ‚Äúmore than she thought she would.‚Äù

She tried pulling me back multiple times  inviting me to her mom‚Äôs birthday, calling me over for coffee, even getting her mom to call and ask if I loved her. But when I held my ground and refused, she accused me of ‚Äúabandoning‚Äù her and ‚Äútaking away her happiness.‚Äù

1mlc5r4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlkalineWaterBetter/comments/1mlc5r4/why_coffee_workouts_and_stress_can_make_acid/,"Why Coffee, Workouts, and Stress Can Make Acid Reflux Worse ‚Äî And How I Learned to Neutralize It","I‚Äôve always been the type to push through long days with coffee in hand, squeeze in workouts when I could, and try to keep stress under control. But a few years ago, I started noticing a frustrating pattern: the more I leaned on caffeine and training sessions ‚Äî especially during stressful weeks ‚Äî the more my acid reflux seemed to flare up.

At first, I thought it was just coincidence. Then I started reading about the link between **acid load** and **lower esophageal sphincter irritation**. Coffee, exercise, and stress all have something in common: they can temporarily increase stomach acid and, in some cases, reduce the body‚Äôs ability to buffer that acid effectively.

# The coffee connection

Coffee isn‚Äôt just acidic ‚Äî it also contains compounds that can relax the sphincter at the top of the stomach, making it easier for acid to travel upward. Even decaf can have this effect. If your body‚Äôs buffering systems are already stretched thin, that morning cup can tip the scales toward irritation.

# Exercise and acid balance

Intense exercise produces lactic acid as a byproduct, and while that‚Äôs normal, it still adds to the body‚Äôs total acid load. Combined with the mechanical bouncing of the stomach during activity, this can trigger reflux in some people ‚Äî especially if their mineral reserves for buffering are low.

# Stress as the silent amplifier

Chronic stress ramps up cortisol, which can alter digestion, slow gastric emptying, and shift electrolyte balance. It‚Äôs like the perfect storm: more acid, slower clearance, and fewer resources to neutralize it.

# What changed for me

After piecing together the science, I started experimenting with adding **alkaline buffers** to my routine. Specifically, **bicarbonates** and **citrates** ‚Äî the same compounds your body naturally uses to regulate pH ‚Äî can help neutralize excess dietary and metabolic acids before they cause trouble.

That‚Äôs when I came across **Alklyte**, a simple blend of sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, and citrates. I started adding a serving to water before coffee or after workouts, and the difference was noticeable. Coffee stopped feeling like a gamble, post-gym reflux became rare, and I could manage stress spikes without my digestion rebelling.

# What the science says

* **Bicarbonates** have been shown to reduce gastric acidity and improve systemic buffering capacity.
* **Citrates** not only help neutralize acid but can also support mineral balance and reduce the absorption of certain pro-inflammatory compounds.
* Combining multiple buffer types may give a broader, more sustained pH-balancing effect than relying on one alone.

# The takeaway

If coffee, workouts, or stress seem to trigger your reflux, it‚Äôs worth looking beyond simple avoidance strategies. Supporting your body‚Äôs acid-buffering systems can make a real difference ‚Äî and for me, that meant keeping bicarbonates and citrates in my daily routine.

*Where the Swans Sink and the Lions Roar*

**Parse the Odds: Implied Probabilities & Spreads**  
The Brisbane Lions are the undisputed favorites here, with decimal odds of 1.22 (Bovada) implying a **81.9% chance to win**. That‚Äôs not just confidence‚Äîit‚Äôs mathematical dominance. For context, if the Lions were a coffee brand, they‚Äôd be the one that‚Äôs *always* in stock. Meanwhile, the Swans, priced at 4.0, have a **20% implied win probability**‚Äîabout the same chance of me correctly spelling ‚ÄúBrisbane‚Äù without looking it up.

The spread tells an even starker story: Brisbane is -23.5, meaning they‚Äôre expected to win by almost a quarter‚Äôs worth of goals. Sydney is +23.5, which is generous enough to let them lose by 22 and still cash the bet. The total line sits at **165.5**, with both Over and Under at 1.87 (decimal), suggesting bookmakers expect a high-scoring clash. Given Brisbane‚Äôs third-place standing and Sydney‚Äôs five-game losing streak, this feels like a mismatch between a sports car and a shopping cart on a downhill slope.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Momentum, and Desperation**  
The Lions are coming off a **win over Collingwood**, a team that‚Äôs like the AFL‚Äôs version of a hydra‚Äîevery time you think they‚Äôre beaten, they grow another head (and somehow lose). Brisbane‚Äôs lineup appears intact, with no major injury updates, which is surprising given their recent habit of winning while key players ‚Äúrecover from mysterious kitchen appliance accidents.‚Äù

The Swans, meanwhile, are a cautionary tale. They‚Äôre **out of finals contention** and desperate to end a five-game losing streak against Brisbane. Their motivation? A mix of pride and the faint hope that maybe, just

Welcome to the 2025-26 S√ºper Lig opener, where Gen√ßlerbirliƒüi‚Äîfresh off a four-year exile‚Äîtries to avoid an immediate relegation scare against third-place finishers Samsunspor. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a Turkish coffee sipper.

### The Odds: Samsunspor‚Äôs Got the Edge, But Is It Justified?

* **Moneyline**: Samsunspor is the clear favorite at **-161** (implied probability: **61.7%**), while Gen√ßlerbirliƒüi is a **+490** long shot (17.2%). The draw sits at **+380** (26.1%).
* **Spread**: Samsunspor is **-0.75 (-425)**, meaning they must win by more than a goal to cover. Gen√ßlerbirliƒüi (+0.75 at +350) gets a half-goal head start.
* **Total Goals**: The line is **2.5 goals**, with **Over** at **-185** (54.3% implied) and **Under** at **+185** (34.7%).

### Key Context

* Gen√ßlerbirliƒüi‚Äôs return to the top flight is a feel-good story, but they‚Äôre missing key players: Oƒüulcan √úlg√ºn (yellow card suspension) and Ensar Kemaloƒülu (injury). Their new-look squad includes Henry Onyekuru (Galatasaray alum), but they‚Äôre replacing Amilton, a key Brazilian

I used to believe that a full schedule meant a full life.
If my calendar was packed, I thought I was moving forward, doing something meaningful. But deep down, I wasn‚Äôt feeling full, I was just occupied.

When I discovered the idea of ikigai, I thought it was simply about finding a passion or a dream job. But as I sat with it longer, I realized it‚Äôs about living with intention, weaving purpose into the small, everyday moments, not just the grand milestones.

It‚Äôs about waking up for something, even if it‚Äôs just for peace, for passion, or for the people you love. It‚Äôs knowing there‚Äôs a quiet reason behind your steps, even on days that feel ordinary.

So I slowed down. I stopped rushing through mornings. I started tasting my coffee instead of gulping it. I listened to people without waiting for my turn to speak. I let myself pause, even if nothing ‚Äúproductive‚Äù was happening.

And something shifted.
The emptiness that busy-ness could never fill began to fade. My life felt less like a checklist and more like a story I was choosing to write. I began to feel full, with gratitude, connection, and meaning.

Now I understand that being busy is about speed; being full is about depth.

The night before I finished the outline for Conventional Ways to Please a Women. I wasn't planning to finish it but the it just came to me. I might write something tonight but who knows? I may just let myself continue doing anything but. It always leaves me feeling sluggish and off when I don't write for a day, though. I've only been on a plan twice but I'm rather sure it is quite a lot like how jet lag feels. My mind has trouble comprehending the time. 

A few other small anecdotes. Father's eager to take someone, anyone on a ride in his car but as you'd expect the weather has neither mother nor I interested in going out. He wants to go to the drive-in in it tomorrow so we'll see. Cooper saw a bunny right by the back door and was quite literally shaking in eagerness to get at it. He spent a half hour staring eye-to-eye with it, howling and barking like a madman. It was quite amusing.

Well, wish me luck in shaking off this writer's lag. Maybe I'll be ravenous for writing tonight when I have my evening coffee. Here's hoping.

1mlbrje,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mlbrje/room_409_pt_4/,Room 409 - Pt 4,"The room doesn‚Äôt imprison you‚Äîit convinces you that you left of your own free will.

But every hallway I manage to escape becomes a replica, a false sense of security and safety. Grief doesn‚Äôt die; it decorates. 

It builds walls out of the memories that I don‚Äôt trust, gifts me keys I don‚Äôt remember earning, and it multiplies the number of doors I must walk through.

Some doors lead to moments that I swore never happened, but I couldn‚Äôt tell you if they did or not. Others feel too tender to be false. 

The room knows that I will open any door if I think she‚Äôs behind it.

My one hope is finding the right door so that I can take my little girl home‚Ä¶

If haven‚Äôt read parts 1, 2, or 3, I urge you to start there. What follows won‚Äôt make sense otherwise.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I navigated my way through the thick darkness of the closet only to emerge back into the hallway this time.

Not in bed. Not on the floor.

Just‚Ä¶ there.

Too quiet. Too clean. Too curated.

My knees gave out and I slid down the wall, slumping against the peeling wallpaper like a drunk dragged out mid-dream. 

The rough texture of the wallpaper pricked at my skin like thorns as the lights above me buzzed with indecision ‚Äî flickering in and out, caught between seconds.

For a long moment, I couldn‚Äôt move.

I didn‚Äôt want to.

Because I knew the truth before I even looked:

I was back.
Not free.
Just deeper.

I stood slowly, joints stiff, breath stale in my throat.

And that‚Äôs when I saw them.

Not one Room 409.

But two.

One door ‚Äî rusted over, scorched black around the handle like it had once been set ablaze.

The other ‚Äî soft sea-glass green, lit from within by the kind of warmth only nostalgia can fake.

I reached for the burnt door first only to realize it wouldn‚Äôt budge.

Locked.

The green one?

It opened by itself, as if imploring me to explore its interior.

The hallway behind me vanished. The path led only forward now.

I walked into the room slowly only to realize that this was my own living room. It didn‚Äôt feel like home though.

It felt like a replica, like a too-perfect stage set, waiting for actors who never come. The throw blanket was folded neatly across the arm of the couch, the air was stale, but free of dust. Familiar, but‚Ä¶ wrong.

It was as if someone had reconstructed it from memory instead of experience.

There was a book on the coffee table that I didn‚Äôt recognize.

A Study of Grief in Nonlinear Time

I picked it up to study it further and noticed that there was no author or a barcode.

I opened the cover and noticed a handwritten note inscribed on the first page:

‚ÄúWhat you bury does not die. It waits in corners, closets, and in the reflection that lags a little too long.‚Äù

My hands were shaking before I realized I was holding the journal again, but not in my hands...in my daughter‚Äôs hands.

I screamed in fright and dropped the journal but like a cat that lands on its feet, it landed perfectly, open.

New words filled the page where the old ones were:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the only one who lived here. Memory is a hallway. You didn‚Äôt build all the doors.‚Äù

I backed away from the journal quickly and noticed that silence of the house had grown deafening.

I moved room to room ‚Äî kitchen, bedroom, hallway ‚Äî every space eerily pristine, untouched like a crime scene scrubbed clean. Sanitized grief.

That is when it shifted.

The hallway lengthened to disorienting proportions.

It was subtle at first. A few extra inches. Then feet. Then yards.

That old rose-colored wallpaper peeled from the edges, revealing something familiar beneath it.

The bones of Room 409.

It was bleeding through my life again.

I followed.

‚∏ª

The door was new this time.

It was sea-glass green.

Worn brass knob scuffed down to silver, a victim to the erosion of time.

I hesitated before I opened it.

Inside, a child‚Äôs room awaited me. But it was not Emily‚Äôs.

Different toys littered the floor, and the walls were covered in drawings I didn‚Äôt recognize. They consisted of stick figures with hands too long, all smiling like they didn‚Äôt know how not to.

And in the center of the bed sat a boy.

He had chestnut brown hair with tiny freckles that adorned his face. He had eyes that looked far too old to belong to someone that small.

He looked up at me and smiled.

‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

I froze, unsure who this child was. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm in the wrong‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou came back,‚Äù he said.

I blinked in confusion, ‚ÄúDo I know you?‚Äù

He tilted his head slightly as if he found my question funny. ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù

It was in that moment that I felt it. That static that buzzed behind my eyes like a hive of enraged hornets. The one I‚Äôd learned to associate with the room.

It was watching me again.

The boy‚Äôs smile faded. ‚ÄúYou remember her, don‚Äôt you? Your daughter?‚Äù

I nodded stiffly, fear guiding my movements like a marionette.

‚ÄúThen remember me.‚Äù

The walls vibrated intensely as the drawings that decorated them on them twisted and distorted until the stick figures became‚Ä¶me.

The drawings depicted me crying, screaming, blank faced and standing in between a black and green door.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù The question lurching from my throat.

The boy stood up from his position on the bed, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the morning you left the blinds closed. The day her laugh slipped away. The moment you stopped caring ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm the version of you that never left the room.‚Äù

The sound of a door screeching open came from behind me.

I turned to see that it wasn‚Äôt a closet anymore that I was looking at.

It was a hospital room, Emily‚Äôs hospital room.

The bed was empty, the sheets disheveled. Mr. Grey, the stuffed elephant was torn apart, the stuffing strewn across the linoleum like snow.

When I turned back, the boy was gone. The journal was in the place where he had been standing.

A new page was open for me to read:

‚ÄúYou thought grief ended when the tears stopped. But silence is where it grows strongest.‚Äù

‚∏ª

I ran through shifting rooms and bending hallways.

Furniture contorted into unnamable shapes.

Doorways opened into impossible spaces ‚Äî reality glitching and gasping for its final breaths.

Static droned in my ears as Emily‚Äôs voice echoed from within the walls like a voice trapped inside a cave.

Faint. Distant. Warped.

‚ÄúYou left me in the dark too long. I became something else.‚Äù

I burst into the living room again‚Ä¶but it wasn‚Äôt mine anymore.

The photographs were all wrong.

One showed me with no face.
In another, Claire‚Äôs eyes were scratched out.
In the last, Emily stood alone at the playground by the swing set.

I rushed to the front door and pulled at the door begging to be free but‚Ä¶

Nothing.

It wasn‚Äôt stuck. It wasn‚Äôt locked.

It just‚Ä¶wasn‚Äôt real.

‚∏ª

The journal was waiting for me on the dining table, like a guest waiting for dinner.

I didn‚Äôt want to read it, but at the same time‚Ä¶I did.

With morbid curiosity, my eyes befell the pages again.

‚ÄúSometimes the room doesn‚Äôt show you what happened. Sometimes it shows you what you‚Äôre becoming.‚Äù

Then came the knocks.

Soft, restrained.

At the window.

I looked to see that standing outside, in the rain‚Ä¶was me.

A younger version of me somehow.

His eyes were wilder than mine, consumed with grief. A cracked and splintered smile adorned his face.

He was clutching something in his hand, something I recognized immediately.

It was a room key.

409.

He raised his hand and dropped it on the windowsill, before turning to walk away.

I flung the window open and cried out after him.

But there was no man or rain, just a hallway.

It was stretched out like an open wound, the rose wallpaper pulsing beneath the beige paint like a beast in a deep slumber.

My world had become the room.

‚∏ª

I collapsed onto the couch in a disheveled heap, unsure if I was exhausted or just empty.

The air buzzed slightly, not with sound but with sorrow.

It had shape now, actual weight to it.

Then a voice permeated from the walls.

It wasn‚Äôt Claire‚Äôs or Emily‚Äôs voice I heard, it was my own. 

But it was older, gruff, significantly more bitter.

Worn down by time, guilt, and memory.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt bury grief like a body. It doesn‚Äôt rot‚Äîit roots.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do I do?‚Äù I asked, uncertainty dripping in every word of my question.

‚ÄúYou do the hardest thing, you remember everything. Even the parts that hurt, those especially.‚Äù

The voice dissipated as yet another door appeared before me.

It was sea-glass green again.

It opened before I reached for it.

I stepped through and saw the same child‚Äôs room as before only now the boy was gone.

The bed sat empty, perfectly undisturbed like a lie frozen in time. 

On the wall rested a mirror.

That wasn‚Äôt there last time‚Ä¶I thought as I found myself walking towards it.

I closed my eyes, fearful of the reflection that awaited me.

I opened them slowly, reluctantly.

It revealed‚Ä¶me.

Finally, me.

There was no smile, no delay.

The man in the mirror perfectly reflected me.

For the first time in what felt like hours‚Ä¶ days‚Ä¶ maybe years‚Ä¶

My reflection wasn‚Äôt lying.

Beside me, the journal hovered in the air like it had been waiting for this exact moment.

The pages turned like a wind was directing it to do so until it landed on the final page.

It read:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about leaving the room. It‚Äôs about choosing what you bring with you when you do.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt look away from the mirror, I held my gaze like I was delivering a testimony.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here.‚Äù I spoke, my eyes focusing with intent.

My reflection nodded as if to say: For now.

The room didn‚Äôt slam shut; it quietly closed and folded like a book after its final chapter.

The air became heavier, warmer, as if someone had been crying in it for hours.

I turned back to see that the hallway was gone and had been replaced with a stairwell.

There was no railing, just worn wooden steps spiraling downward into the cold depths below.

As I approached, I noticed something was carved into the first step:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve remembered too much to go back.‚Äù

I swallowed nervously and took the stairs one step at a time, slowly descending towards whatever fate awaited me at the bottom.

Each step beneath my feet echoed wrong.

Not with footsteps but with faint whispers.

‚ÄúIt was your fault.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt there.‚Äù
‚ÄúShe was waiting.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt come.‚Äù

I tried to remember her laugh but the room was louder, it drowned out my every thought like TV static.

It was enough to make me scream but I stayed resilient until I made it to the bottom.

When I reached the last stair, I noticed a door.

It was unmarked and‚Ä¶weeping?

Thick, blackened water leaked from beneath it. Slow as molasses. Heavy as oil.

I reached for the handle and felt a harsh heat burn my palm like the room on the other side was ablaze.

I pulled away, but the door opened on its own accord.

Inside: a kitchen.

The low sound of a child laughing from another room.

It felt familiar and safe.

Too safe.

It felt like a trap disguised as comfort. 

Every chair was perfectly angled. Every photo frame dustless. The lamp light illuminated the room in a soft gold, like memory filtered through nostalgia.

I stepped toward the counter and noticed an open lunchbox sitting there. It was a deep shade of purple and covered in stars.

A sticky note sat beside it.

It read:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll do better today. I believe in you.‚Äù ‚Äî Dad

I stared at the note. It was in my handwriting, but I never wrote it.

The hallway compelled me toward the framed photos lining the wall.

Birthday parties she never had. 

Beach vacations we never took. 

Her graduation, years too far ahead.

All these memories decorated the wall.

I reached out to touch one and felt the image ripple, like I was touching water.

The room wasn‚Äôt showing the past; it was fabricating an entire future.

It was nothing more than an elaborate lie.

It was offering forgiveness I hadn‚Äôt earned.

And I almost accepted its apology.

Almost.

That is, until I saw the final door.

It was a small and narrow closet.

Inside, sat a woman in a chair. Head bowed as if she were napping.

‚ÄúClaire?‚Äù Her name hung in the air in quiet suspension as I awaited a response.

She lifted her head slowly to reveal her bloodshot eyes and sickly pale skin.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to be here,‚Äù she warned tiredly.

I knelt beside her, ‚ÄúI had to know.‚Äù

She looked at me with something like pity. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason we buried it. The room showed me too. What comes after and what you won‚Äôt survive.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did it show you?‚Äù I pleaded, eager for more answers.

Her pregnant pause filled my heart with tension before she finally spoke to me again:

‚ÄúEmily and I‚Ä¶ we forgave you, didn‚Äôt we? That‚Äôs what you needed us to do...what you wanted.‚Äù

I reached for her hand.

It was cold but not lifeless.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not her.‚Äù I acknowledged as I pulled my hand away.

She offered a soft smile laced with sadness. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the version of me you needed. The peace you imagined. Not the truth.‚Äù

I stood and watched as the closet and the darkness behind her deepen.

In the distance, I could see the faint outline of the three numbers on a placard that have come to haunt me:

409.

The loop always ends here.

I looked down one last time, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not real.‚Äù

Claire nodded, ‚ÄúAnd neither is the version of you that keeps pretending you‚Äôre healing.‚Äù

She faded before my eyes as did the world around us as I found myself back inside Room 409, alone.

Then came several loud knocks.

At first, I thought it came from the door. Then I realized that they were coming from beneath the bed.

I slowly crouched to peek underneath.

There was no figure, just a piece of folded paper.

It was written in Emily‚Äôs handwriting.

‚ÄúYou said you‚Äôd stay but you left me with the room.‚Äù

I dropped to my knees and wept, the emotional dam finally giving way.

My tears were not ones of fear; they were of recognition from finally understanding that I had never left.

My body went home, filed reports, and wore smiles.

But the part of me that held her hand when the machines turned off?

That part never made it out.

And the room?

It fed that part comfort, false memories, and just enough hope to continue to play pretend, until the truth was just one version of the story.

I wiped the tears that stained my face and saw it.

A door had manifested itself in the middle of the room.

It was new, but not.

The door was numbered:

409.

The journal sat in front of it, its pages fluttering.

I opened it and noticed there was only one line embedded into the page:

‚ÄúIf you walk through this door, there‚Äôs no forgetting again.‚Äù

I turned the page.

Blank.

Except, there was a key.

Etched into it were the numbers 409.

And beneath it, Emily‚Äôs name.

I whispered it aloud like prayer, surrendering myself to the room.

It shuddered and drew its breath before letting out an exhale that felt final before I opened the door and stepped through the doorway.

Inside, things were familiar once again, but not mine. 

The room looked almost untouched: bed made, curtains drawn, no blood on the carpet. There were details I couldn‚Äôt explain, however. 

There was a pair of women‚Äôs shoes by the dresser and a little girl‚Äôs coat draped over the chair. 

Static blared from the TV in a deafening manner as I approached it.

As I got closer, I noticed a VHS tape resting on the nightstand.

Its worn-out label read: Room 409 ‚Äî short film.

I inserted the tape into the battered VCR under the television and watched the screen crackle to life. 

At first, only a title card: The Lotus Hotel presents‚Ä¶

Then: me. Standing with Brenner and other investigators in a brightly lit room, looking down at the photographs of a man and a woman, narrating the scene.

Only‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt speaking. My mouth moved, but a different voice spilled out ‚Äî slower, brittle, almost stitched together from a dozen different recordings like memories falsifying their own reconstruction.

A voice made from fragments rather than complete thoughts.

The lines it spoke‚Ä¶ they were mine. 

From the briefing with Brenner. 

From the report. 

From the story I told myself.

‚ÄúThe detective believes he‚Äôs solving a crime‚Ä¶ but what he‚Äôs really doing is running from the ending.‚Äù

I shut it off and as I did, the light to the bathroom turned on.

It was like I was being beckoned by the room to explore further.

I headed towards the bathroom and found a file folder on the sink. 

The cover bore my name, handwritten.

Inside were intake forms, psych evaluations, and words like disassociation and trauma-fueled construct. 

There were dates on the reports as well. Some matched the timeline I remembered, and others were from almost a decade earlier. 

There was even a photo of me. I had shorter hair, wore a hospital bracelet, and had eyes that looked like they hadn‚Äôt slept in years.

That‚Äôs when I noticed it: the mirror behind the sink.

And the version of me staring back.

He didn‚Äôt move when I did. He didn‚Äôt flinch when I recoiled. He just stood there, smiling. Slowly. Sadly.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I trembled.

He mouthed back: ‚ÄúThe real one. The one who never left.‚Äù

I ran out of the bathroom and down the hallway, adrenaline coursing through my veins as my feet thudded against the carpeted flooring.

My feet guided me through the stairwell. The lobby flickered‚Äîpristine, then rotted‚Äîtwo timelines fighting to overwrite one another. 

A bellhop stood at the front desk, humming to himself.

When I approached, he turned‚Äîand had my face.

‚ÄúWelcome back, Mr. Cartwright,‚Äù he said courteously. ‚ÄúWill you be staying with us long this time?‚Äù

I backed away, the color draining from my face as the elevator dinged behind me. 

I watched the doors open and heard a child‚Äôs voice singing softly from within.

Emily‚Ä¶

‚ÄúRow, row, row your boat‚Ä¶‚Äù

I practically leapt into the elevator and pressed the buttons in a frantic plea that one of them will lead me towards the exit.

I hit every floor. Each opened to a different version of the Lotus. One looked like a hospital. One like a courtroom. One like a funeral home. In one, I saw myself sitting with a doctor. In another, I stood at a graveside alone.

All timelines. All versions of me.

I couldn‚Äôt breathe.

Eventually, I made it back to Room 409‚Äîthe original one, I think. Or maybe a new copy. It didn‚Äôt matter anymore.

I stepped inside. The lights were dim. Dust settled in slow motion. The air felt ancient.

And there, burned into the wallpaper above the bed in blackened letters:

you: someone who says what they mean, but doesn‚Äôt need to explain every silence. someone who can match me in stubbornness and softness, who understands that ‚Äúforever‚Äù is just a word until you make it real.

send me a dm if this feels like you.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of heavy cream is determined by specific attributes that affect its performance in various applications. Choosing the right gallon involves understanding these characteristics and selecting based on your individual needs.

**Butterfat Content:** A higher butterfat content, generally between 36% and 40%, is essential for achieving stable whipped cream and rich sauces. Products with lower butterfat may not whip as well or hold their shape, and they can curdle more easily in hot dishes. Look for products that clearly state their butterfat percentage.

A high butterfat content ensures a luxurious texture and flavor, making it ideal for demanding culinary applications. This characteristic contributes to the overall stability and richness of the cream, enhancing the final product's taste and appearance. The specified quantity typically reflects a promise to quality that can be trusted.

**Pasteurization Method:** Ultra-pasteurized (UHT) cream has a longer shelf life but may have a slightly cooked or altered flavor compared to traditional pasteurized cream. Some find the difference negligible, while others prefer the fresher taste of regular pasteurization, even if it means a shorter storage period. Be sure to weight the convenience of durability against any alteration that affects its natural flavors.

Pasteurization is vital for food safety. During this process, the product is heated to a set temperature for a specific amount of time to kill pathogenic organisms. The UHT method extends the product's usability by minimizing the possible ways through which it can spoil.

**Homogenization:** Homogenization prevents the separation of fat molecules, resulting in a consistently smooth texture. While some artisanal producers may opt for non-homogenized cream, most commercially available heavy cream gallons are homogenized for better stability and ease of use. It also influences aspects of its texture.

The homogenization process creates a visually appealing and palatable product. Lack of this stabilization can reduce the appeal of a recipe using heavy cream in its list of ingredients. Homogenization is usually preferred.

**Packaging material:** The packaging material of a heavy cream gallon affects its shelf life and convenience. Options include plastic jugs, cardboard cartons, and even aseptic packaging for ultra-pasteurized products. Consider the environmental impact and ease of storage when making your choice.

Good packaging should protect the product from exterior elements and ensure ease of handling. Some are more recyclable than others, so be sure to examine all the factors that are crucial to you when purchasing.

**Additives and Stabilizers:** Some heavy cream gallons may contain added stabilizers like carrageenan or guar gum to improve texture and prevent separation. While these additives are generally safe, some consumers prefer to avoid them and seek out products with minimal ingredients. As with any food item, it is best to read the ingredients label thoroughly.Additives can affect the mouthfeel and overall flavor profile of the cream. Consider the use cases for your bulk purchase of heavy cream gallons and determine if you would rather have a pure product that requires more consideration to storage.

I'm fairly new to the world of perfumes and writing indie reviews -- I only got into it a few years ago, but I tend to consume slowly and haven't bought new scents often enough to expand my experience very fast --  but over the last two years, the house I focused on the most when it came to trying out scents and profiles was Death and Floral.

Over the course of the last few years, I've had the opportunity to sit with and think about \~14 of their perfumes, and wrote some reviews at various points in the year as I did so. I tried to be fair and to test them all at different points in time and in different weather, though some perfumes I de-stashed quicker than others. Unfortunately, it's easier to figure out what I love or really don't like than it is to wrestle with and detangle why a perfume felt mid on me, and, as it turns out, Death and Floral makes a lot of middle-of-the-pack perfumes to me. Those middle of the road perfumes were definitely the hardest to write about -- it's easy to gush or pan, but to figure out what to say about a 4/10 perfume when you're new to the art form is just difficult. Oh well, you live and you learn, and there are enough hits in this house that I'm overall happy with it and might continue to experiment and try out new things in their catalogue when they come back.

**Color Me Blood Orange (7/10)**  
*fresh Italian orange blood blended with autumnal spices and honeysuckle*

Like I just got my thumbnail under the thick skin of a navel orange and a little of the oil sprayed back out at me. Not as fresh or astringent an orange smell as the bottle whiff made it seem ‚Äî there‚Äôs a white floral underneath it that rounds it out into almost a fleshy orange scent, and a somewhat clove-and-cinnamon-ish brown spice scent as well that is very, very faint. As it dries down, it gets more floral and spiced. It‚Äôs well blended though so it‚Äôs mostly just a warm yellow-orange scent. I swear I get a little pleasant waxy vanilla candle wafting through.

**Crunchy Baguette (5/10)**  
*The warm sniff of bread upon entering a bakery, sweet and savory breads piled into a cafe, with the soft hint of coconut bonbons and fresh tarts lingering in the background*

In the bottle, I smelled hazelnut coffee creamer. Wet on skin: sweet, coconut-y, very pastry-smelling, but with a generous dose of that sweetened hazelnut coffee creamer smell. After a bit of time to dry, I can really smell flaky croissants and very buttered bread, with a faint whiff of salt. The creaminess of the butter comes through strongly, much more so than the bread notes for me. I also smell a coconut more like coconut flakes. It almost smells like an egg tart to me?

Drydown: Much fainter and more of a skin scent now (about half hour after application), I smell a hint of bread piled under mildly salted butter. This was a random freebie, and it instantly made clear to me that I personally don't enjoy smelling like baked goods, no matter how well the baked goods are evoked.

**Don't climb inside fridges! Do not CLIMB INSIDE OF FRIDGES (2/10)**  
*The inside of a freezer burnt fridge, with slight frozen floral undertones*

In the bottle: plasticky slightly vanilla playdough?

Wet on skin: Slightly ‚Äúoff‚Äù chemical scent that reads both stale and plasticky, with an unpleasant edge to it. Can‚Äôt really get a read on what that unpleasant edge is, though to give Death and Floral credit, it definitely pings the same ‚ÄúMOLD?‚Äù part of my hindbrain that some anonymous fridgesmell can also hit. I don‚Äôt get the cold ozonic freezerish smell I was hoping for. It's almost like if harsh chemicals could smell stale and moldy?

Drydown: 30 minutes in ‚Äî less sweet and vanilla-y, much more of that stale mold plastic. I like that it's unusual, it's just not unusual in the direction I was craving, which I suppose is unfair to punish Death and Floral for. Oh well, I'm a capricious dilettante.

**Electricity (6/10)**  
*Electricity*

Something about this smell is almost vegetal? It prickles in my nose, sure, but if I close my eyes and really think about what it evokes, it‚Äôs cutting open the stem and pith of a fat chili pepper. Or a bell pepper. It sweetens and becomes less fresh as I smell longer, almost gaining a powdery note? But that is spot on capsaicin, I‚Äôm a little convinced anything else I‚Äôm trying to smell is me hallucinating.

After an hour, I'd occasionally move my wrist near my face and get a waft of the scent that ‚Äî well, this is now so specific as to nearly be useless, but it smells at first exactly like the aloo chaat they use in pani puri. No clue what's causing that, and I would never wear this in public due to, well, not wanting to be a desi person in the West who smells like desi food, but it's actually so nice and comforting in a Proust's madeleines way. Underneath the pani puri impression remains the cleaner and sharper vegetal/bell pepper scent. It all vanishes into a skin scent I have to really huff to smell within the two hour mark of applying, which is about average for this brand and my skin. I rated it a 6/10 because it's still kind of impressive how exact those smells are, even if it's not what I asked for.

**Hallows' Eve Museum Heist (4/10)**  
*Stolen jasmine sambac and golden heart amber, orange bitters, luscious aged cognac, dinosaur bones*

There's a relatively strong jasmine and orange opener with a musty scent behind it that feels a little like stumbling into an ancient temple in the heart of a city. Then, it all but vanishes within an hour, so the drydown is hard to smell, but the dusty must scent does begin to dominate. The whole perfume is so muted and faint that it was hard to smell much of anything without really huffing my wrist as soon as I applied the perfume, and the opener, which was unarguably the most interesting thing about it, vanishes too quickly for me to enjoy.

**Kodachrome (8/10)**  
*Bright red lychee fruit, sweetgrass, cornmeal, rolled oats, fresh dates*

I‚Äôm writing this after having recently peeled open a small bowl of fresh lychees to eat, so I can say with a strong scent memory in my head: this is not fresh lychee. It might resemble canned lychees in syrup? (I‚Äôm less familiar with that scent).

It‚Äôs extremely juicy and fruity (almost screechily so), with a warm and round baked-dessertish backing beat, but the fruit I identify it most strongly with might be green apples, if green apples were genetically modified to burst on impact. There‚Äôs something artificial hovering over all of it, as well as something very, very sweet. It‚Äôs also a primarily wet scent, at odds with the distinctive dry oat smell. It‚Äôs not quite a sour apple tart, but more like if someone in a SoCal boba shop had the idea of turning sour apple tarts into a drink. The throw is very strong for a Death and Floral scent (which usually doesn‚Äôt go too far on my skin), and it does last at a high intensity for a while.

After a while, I think the perfume does settle down and mix into something very warm, with a fruit-and-floral musk to it. It really evokes a hot lazy summer afternoon at a boba shop where they mix the drinks with flavored powders and popping boba. This review makes it sound like I don't like it, but I do! It's a nice, young summer scent.

**Melodrama (9/10)**  
*black patchouli and cognac, blended with toasted oats*

Wet on skin: Warm honeyed spices come through, as well as a scent that feels like what a Jack and Coke would smell like if it had no alcohol or carbonation. There‚Äôs nothing sharp in this smell at all ‚Äî it‚Äôs molasses-thick and warm. I do think I can smell the toasted oats, too ‚Äî or at least something that smells the slightest bit breakfast-y, but in a grown up way.

I put it on to walk around in my bathrobe getting ready for a New Year‚Äôs party and I can almost close my eyes and imagine dark paneled oakwood bookshelves and jammy apricot-colored sunshine coming in through leaded windows, instead of primer-paint studio apartment walls. As it opens up, I think I smell more of the alcohol in the cognac, and the sweetness is starting to fade into a more rounded scent. It‚Äôs sexy for sure, in an old-moneyish way? Just like other people who reviewed it on IMAM, I would never have picked it out myself, but I got it as a freebie and am now really in love with it. It's a winter scent and it does last more than a few hours on me (where most Death and Floral scents barely survive a couple hours), and it's such a great date night scent that I'm already half done with the bottle and will need to order a rollerball at some point.

**Misspent Youth (5/10)**  
*Iced cold root beer, the glowing hum of a 7-11 parking lot, peppered vanilla, blood orange & ginger candy, fuzzy grey amber*

Sticky root beer syrup and vanilla ice cream, but it‚Äôs complicated a bit by the jag of ginger candy which, while sweet on top of sweet notes, does also come off as a bit peppery. The ginger candy, which reminds me more of crystallized ginger than ginger chews, is the tiniest bit fuzzy and sparkly. Like being wrapped in a big fuzzy blanket and sitting on top of marshmallows and gumdrops while watching winter holiday lights twinkle outside. If I really, really concentrate, after reading that there's supposed to be orange, I can kind of smell something that also is a bit like an orange hard candy, but it's very faint and mostly serving to round out the vanilla. The ginger and pepper are the MVPs here, doing the most to keep the very present root beer float from going too childish on me, but it‚Äôs still not a favorite. It does get less sweet over time, though that only means it goes from literally tooth-aching to just ambient candy-store smell levels of sweet, but I‚Äôm a hater who just doesn‚Äôt want to smell sugary at all like that. Really love that ginger, though.

**Morton Salt Girl (3/10)**  
*Yellow musk, salt, and rain on concrete*

Wet: I smell the minerally saltiness alongside the citrus (which seems to have more on common with pomelo or grapefruit than lemon/lime). I think the yellow brightness is overpowering any rainy grey musk that could come through, though there‚Äôs a not insignificant mineral smell underneath. Unpleasant in that there‚Äôs a bit of a wood-varnish edge to it.

Dry: Citrus edge remains, but much fainter now. I just cannot get away from the scent image of pickles. A Mountain Dew pickle of a bright yellow-green smell. I, unfortunately, never got ""rain on concrete"" or something that could distinctly be picked out as ""salt"".

**Nothing rusts in the desert the air is full of ghosts (5/10)**  
*Pink cactus flowers and sweet grass, with notes of warm rain and woody dry vanilla*

Warm, lemongrass-ish floral. Very clean, but I smell a little of the humidity too. Pink and green smell, where the green is going very soapy. If I wanted to smell like an Aveda salon, this is the perfume I'd go for.

**Pink Peony Club (4/10)**  
*Pink peonies blended with sweet peaches and hazelnut*

Garnier Fructis shampoo.

**The People You Love Become Ghosts Inside You (1/10)**  
*Heavenly musk, lingering funeral flowers, cold scent of vanilla in an empty corridor, handprints on a foggy window*

In the bottle: Smoky sweet BBQ.

Wet: Sweet BBQ? As I huff it longer, the BBQ smell sort of separates into a rounder musk and an acrid odor underneath. After thirty minutes, the overwhelming punch of BBQ just barely fades (STILL VERY PRESENT) and I can smell a little of the foggy glass in a very dusty home. By hour 2, the BBQ has faded to just the acridity, which does mix nicely into the sweet-in-a-formaldehydey-way base of the scent.

In high school I used to TA for the bio teacher and helped her run fetal pig dissections ‚Äî it‚Äôs not an exact match to the fetal pig formaldehyde solution (the perfume is definitely the more pleasant of the two) but the structure of the scent is similar. This perfume has low sillage on me but does last quite a while (4 hours in and I can smell it if I bring my skin right up to my nose). There‚Äôs a slight warm Vaseline-yness to it as well. But I just can‚Äôt escape the BBQ smell association enough to like this. Weirdly enough, it always smelled kind of warm on me, too, despite all the cold descriptors in the notes. Destashed.

**Two Cups of Tea, a Summer Monsoon, and Me and You (9/10)**  
*Rain on cracked soil, wet creosote, a swelling monsoon, desert cedar, black tea*

Wet: Loamy wet petrichor, something floral, sweet black tea in the very background and mistakable for something else too. Almost like stepping outside after the rain shower into a now sunny, wet world.

To me the flowers are unfortunately stronger than the tea note, so it reads a lot as a sunny post-rain scent with a splash of clean cotton laundry, with no tea unless I let myself power-of-suggestion hallucinate it. However, it‚Äôs just so spot on as a monsoon-soaked-the-laundry-lines smell that I am still absolutely obsessed with it.

Drydown: More dirt (in a slightly sweet way that I can see someone interpreting as beets). Fainter, earthier, darker. I‚Äôm very obsessed. Perfect everyday rain scent to me. Unfortunately, I lost my rollerball in a move, so I'll have to wait until the website opens up again to get another.

**With the fishes and the dead (6/10)**  
*Black squid ink and mile long oceans. Black ambergris, black labdanum absolute, salty ocean water, and black pits of stretched out emptiness*

It starts almost medicinally ‚Äî that‚Äôs the rock rose, for sure, which I associate with dry, dusty, desert environments. Here it‚Äôs sweetened out, almost into those medicinal candies you can get from Chinese specialty grocers. In fact, for the first initial wet application phase of this perfume, that‚Äôs what rises to mind: a dusty linoleum floor and high ceilings, the spice aisle of a Chinese grocery store. Something star-anise-y and dark too, which might be the ink?

The perfume settled into something almost humid and less dusty over the space of a half hour, though the licorice-star anise smell never really evaporated, it just mixed with a more salty base.

1mlbgsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/badreviewer/comments/1mlbgsl/plaud_note_159_worth_every_penny/,PLAUD Note: $159? Worth Every Penny.,"I needed a reliable voice recorder for lectures and interviews, and the [PLAUD Note](https://amzn.to/4osxl6e) caught my eye due to its sleek design and advertised long battery life.  I‚Äôve been using it for the past month, putting it through its paces in various environments.

## Audio Quality

The PLAUD Note delivers surprisingly crisp audio recordings, even in moderately noisy environments.  The built-in microphone effectively minimizes background chatter, resulting in clear and intelligible voice recordings. I tested it in a busy coffee shop and a relatively quiet library, and the difference in audio quality was minimal.  The clarity is definitely a standout feature, making transcription much easier than with my previous, cheaper recorder.

## Battery Life

Plaud advertises a long battery life, and in my experience, it largely delivers.  I managed to record over eight hours of continuous audio on a single charge, which is impressive.  This easily covers most of my lecture recordings and interviews.  However,  the charging time is a bit longer than I'd prefer ‚Äì around 3 hours for a full charge.

## Ease of Use

The recorder is incredibly intuitive. The controls are simple and straightforward, making it easy to start, stop, and manage recordings.  The device itself is lightweight and fits comfortably in my bag.  The only slight learning curve is mastering the file management system, which took me a few minutes to understand fully.

## File Management & Transfer

Transferring files to my computer was seamless via the included USB-C cable. The files are saved as standard .wav files, easily compatible with most editing software.  The on-device file organization is functional but could benefit from a more user-friendly interface.  Finding specific files amongst many recordings can be slightly cumbersome.

## Build Quality & Durability

The PLAUD Note feels robust and well-constructed. The casing is made of a sturdy material that feels resistant to accidental drops and bumps. After a month of regular use, it shows no signs of wear and tear. This is a critical feature for a device that will likely be carried around frequently.

## Features

While the PLAUD Note lacks some advanced features found in higher-priced models (like voice activation or remote control), its core functionality is excellent. The simple design is a strength, prioritizing reliability and ease of use over a multitude of potentially less-used features.  The built-in LCD screen provides clear information about recording status and battery life.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros:**

* Excellent audio quality
* Long battery life
* Easy to use
* Durable build
* Seamless file transfer

**Cons:**

* Somewhat slow charging time
* File management could be improved
* Lacks advanced features

## Value Proposition & Price Analysis

At $159, the PLAUD Note sits in the mid-range of voice recorders.  While most rivals in this price bracket offer similar audio quality, many lack the PLAUD Note‚Äôs impressive battery life and robust build quality.  Compared to the more expensive options, you sacrifice some advanced features, but you gain a reliable and durable device that excels in its core function.  For its performance and build, it‚Äôs a strong value proposition.

## Final Verdict & Recommendation

The PLAUD Note is a highly capable voice recorder that delivers excellent audio quality and boasts a long battery life. Its simple design and durable build make it an ideal choice for students, journalists, or anyone needing a reliable and easy-to-use device for recording audio. I highly recommend it to those who prioritize audio quality and battery life over a plethora of advanced, potentially unnecessary, features.  Skip this if you absolutely need voice activation or remote control.",1,1754698568.0,badreviewer,0,1.0,False

It's a revolving door of staff. The caf√© is chronically understaffed as a cost-saving measure, but don‚Äôt expect that to mean decent hours. You can get as little as **5 hours a week**, even after repeatedly asking for more. Rosters drop late more often than not‚Äî like Sunday night for a Monday morning shift.

The couple who own and run the place are emotionally abusive and treat their staff terribly. The husband blamed me for things that weren‚Äôt my fault, threatened me, and created such a hostile work environment that I ended up quitting. His reputation precedes him ‚Äî check out some of their negative review responses (the ones he hasn‚Äôt managed to get removed). Staff were often scapegoated for the caf√©‚Äôs declining business.

The wife would lie about having a dog allergy to refuse service to blind people with guide dogs.

Staff don't get fed, and their card tips are taxed for ""managment charges"" including the cost of the machine. You‚Äôll be expected to work unpaid overtime cleaning and closing, and forget about bank holiday pay ‚Äî he‚Äôll lie straight to your face about both, claiming he pays overtime and that he‚Äôs unaware of bank holiday entitlements. Hilariously, he likes to brag that he ‚Äúbrought coffee culture to Cork‚Äù - fooling absolutely nobody but himself on all counts.

If you want to keep your mental health and actually get paid for your time, steer well clear. If anyone else has stories or experiences, please share!

1mlbg1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1mlbg1f/i_dont_care_that_we_were_13/,I don‚Äôt care that we were 13.,"This is a vent post about something that happened to me recently. 

When I was 11 years old I was going through hell. I had been moved to my father‚Äôs custody a year prior, open and shut custody case because my mom was so bad. His wife was abusive, but she was the only mother I knew, so when she left suddenly I was heartbroken. She blamed me, so I blamed myself. My dad works 12 hour shifts, 5 days a week, sometimes longer. 
I was left alone a lot, and I didn‚Äôt have friends, so I tried to make friends. Long story short, CP was involved. I ended up intwined in a CP ring in my state, they were the only ones who told me they cared about me, and I was willing to do anything to keep these grown ass men around if it meant they cared. My dad eventually found out, and to his credit he started taking a lot better care of me after that, and reported it to the police. I can‚Äôt go much into it, but the main 6 men were arrested, and the one who groomed me died in prison to ‚Äúblunt force trauma‚Äù so I can only hope he got what he deserved. 

When I was 13, in 8th grade (2016 ish?) one of my friends went through the same thing. He told us, he was open about it. I never was, I was also scared to tell people because what if I had to stand in court again? What if it got around and someone found those photos? It terrified me, even though my face wasn‚Äôt in any of them. I told my best friend I understood my other friends pain, and I told her that I had been through something similar. She told me it was disgusting, that I was asking for it, that I was a horrible person and a horrible friend. That I should be in prison alongside him for supporting his actions, and taking the photos. 
I was absolutely heartbroken. She was my best friend and she was telling me to kill myself because of a situation I had very little control over. 
Because of that, I didn‚Äôt tell anyone else until I was 17. I was working at a casual dining restaurant, closing the register area, and my friend had told me that I was acting strangely. I started sobbing and told her everything. I got back into therapy, but even now I struggle with sex because of that trauma. Luckily I have an amazing partner that couldn‚Äôt care less if we ever have sex again, but it still weighs on me. 
I saw that girl recently at a coffee shop I frequent and she acted like we were old friends, that we left off on good terms. I wasn‚Äôt rude, but I wasn‚Äôt nice either. I was cold, I admit that I was. I didn‚Äôt want to talk to her, I didn‚Äôt want her making my drink, I didn‚Äôt want her anywhere near me. She messaged me on Instagram today (which I don‚Äôt know how she found) asking why I was so rude to her. I told her that what she said to me when we were kids really fucked me up, and that it prevented me from healing properly. She told me it wasn‚Äôt a big deal, that we were 13. 
I don‚Äôt care that we were 13. I don‚Äôt care because why should I? I told her I didn‚Äôt care that we were 13, it was horrible of her to say, and it really fucked with the healing process. Then she said that it couldn‚Äôt have been that bad because it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúreal assault.‚Äù I‚Äôve been physically assaulted before, and the CP incident fucked me up worse than that. I blocked her, and found out  through a friend that she doesn‚Äôt work at that cafe anymore. I‚Äôm just glad I don‚Äôt run the risk of seeing her anymore. ",1,1754698512.0,sexualassault,1,1.0,False

1mlbewx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mlbewx/the_square_root_of_all_evil/,The Square Root Of All Evil,"I signed the lease because the hallway smelled like old lemons and the supers kept their keys on hooks that looked like fingers. The building had those thin, tired walls that make every neighbor feel like an organ sharing your blood. I told myself that was a good thing. I‚Äôd hear someone cry for help. I‚Äôd hear a fight before it got out of hand. I‚Äôd hear a laugh and remember what it‚Äôs for.

The door across from mine opened the first night as if it had been waiting. She leaned on the jamb like she‚Äôd grown there. Late twenties, hair a spill of black rope. A cotton T-shirt turned inside out. One sock. The other foot bare and strangely clean.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the new one,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Lena.‚Äù

‚ÄúEvan,‚Äù I said, and immediately hated how smiling made my teeth feel on display. I added, ‚ÄúNice to meet you,‚Äù in the voice I save for strangers I don‚Äôt want to remember.

Her gaze flicked over my boxes‚Äîas if she could read the contents from the tape‚Äôs shine. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre mirror apartments,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf you ever get lost, knock on mine and I‚Äôll reverse it for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúReverse what?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever room you‚Äôre standing in.‚Äù She pointed to my door number, then to hers, like an equation.

I went to say something neutral, something that didn‚Äôt reveal how lonely I was, but she slipped back inside and the deadbolt thunked, and the hall returned to the sound of a building breathing through its vents.

The lemons came from a mop bucket someone had given up putting away. The supers‚Äîan old couple who spoke with each other more than anyone else‚Äîkept their keys like trophies beside a bulletin board scored with staple scars. A flyer dated three months ago asked if anyone had seen a cat named Rook. A bottle left by the mailbox said: ‚ÄúDo not drink. Ant traps inside.‚Äù The mailboxes were heavy steel with narrow mouths that bit catalogs until they bled glue.

I stacked my boxes into the shape of furniture, boiled pasta, ate it out of a coffee mug I wasn‚Äôt sure was clean, and listened. Pipes clicking to themselves. Someone dragging something heavy and then stopping to rest. The quiet war of small machines. I slept in my clothes with the window open to the soft industry of the city.

It was the smell that woke me the second night‚Äîchlorine cut with metal. It seeped through the seam around my door like fog around a tomb lid. I lay there trying to place it, then gave up and went to the hall.

Lena‚Äôs door was open a thumb‚Äôs width; the interior dark, conditioner-cool. I made the kind of mistake that yields consequences and knocked.

‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù she said, from the dark.

I didn‚Äôt, but she did open the door wider and step back. I waited, peering past her shoulder. Everything inside was arranged with that careful kind of disarray that looks accidental: books stacked like steps, towels folded into the idea of softness, a cactus in a teacup that had never held tea. A long silver tub behind a half-drawn curtain gave off the chlorine bite.

‚ÄúPool chemicals,‚Äù she said, catching my face. ‚ÄúI use it to clean grout. Landlords don‚Äôt, so someone has to.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou could just use bleach.‚Äù

Her smile did something with one corner that suggested I‚Äôd failed a test. ‚ÄúBleach is for paying rent. Chlorine is for living,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWant a drink?‚Äù

It was late. I had to be at a job I didn‚Äôt truly have‚Äîa string of contract shifts pretending to be a career. But loneliness makes liars of sleep schedules. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said.

Her kitchen was clean in a way that felt staged. The trash can had a mint tucked under the lid as if for breath. She poured whiskey into glasses that were heavier than they looked.

‚ÄúTo mirror apartments,‚Äù she said. We drank. It burned. The chlorine sat on top of it like a lid.

‚ÄúYou just move here?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúYesterday.‚Äù

‚ÄúRunning from something?‚Äù

‚ÄúRunning to something. Cheaper rent.‚Äù It came out too quick.

‚ÄúThose are the same thing in this city.‚Äù She took a long sip, put her glass down, aligned the ring it left with a stain it matched. ‚ÄúYou can call if you need to borrow sugar or a reason not to sleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou always say things like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly to people who deserve it.‚Äù She turned her head like a bird finding north. ‚ÄúYou know your ex is here.‚Äù

It took me a moment to realize what she meant: the bar downstairs, the one with the fake Irish name and real Irish bartenders. I hadn‚Äôt gone in. I had walked past fast each time, not looking, feeling the bruise on the world where Maya and I had sat not talking, years ago.

‚ÄúYou saw her?‚Äù

‚ÄúHer and the new husband. They were arguing about whether to say hi if they saw you. He wanted to be gracious. She wanted to be science.‚Äù

I shouldn‚Äôt have asked, but I did. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs being science?‚Äù

‚ÄúObservation without contamination.‚Äù She leaned her hip against the counter and watched me like she was waiting for me to do something she could name. ‚ÄúWe should go,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo she can test her theory.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù she said, and grinned like mischief had been invented for this floor.

The bar seemed constructed from endgrain: the cut faces of wood and men. I had rehearsed accidentally running into Maya hundreds of times since she married Elliot, since she‚Äôd told me she wanted someone ‚Äúless thinking and more doing,‚Äù as if those were disjoint sets. Seeing her at a corner table felt like getting the right answer on a question you never wanted to take.

She saw me in that way people see things they planned not to see. Elliot turned, smiled with the charitable warmth of a sturdy man who made decisions with his shoulders. Maya‚Äôs smile was a more precise instrument. It cut me into portions and plated them.

‚ÄúEvan,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis is‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúLena,‚Äù Lena said, before I could, and offered her hand. Maya shook it like a ref making coins disappear. Elliot offered to buy a round. We ended up sitting because all four of us were trained to pretend we didn‚Äôt dread exactly this.

‚ÄúCongratulations,‚Äù I said to no one in particular.

‚ÄúMarried three months,‚Äù Elliot said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still learning where the forks go.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the kitchen,‚Äù Lena said, and Elliot laughed. Maya didn‚Äôt.

The conversation felt like bones moving under skin. Small talk about the building. About how the super couple had marriage like a password. About the cat on the bulletin board and the ant traps and how cheap rent comes salted with ghosts. Elliot asked what I did and I told him nothing. He took it as a joke and did that laugh again, the kind that says he will forgive you when you don‚Äôt need it.

When the drinks were dead, Maya shifted the topic like she was tuning a radio. ‚ÄúWe actually ran into someone you know,‚Äù she said to me. ‚ÄúOnline.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúDNA thing,‚Äù she said, and sipped water like it was wine. ‚ÄúYou still keep your sample up, don‚Äôt you? The genealogy site.‚Äù

‚ÄúCould be,‚Äù I said, though I knew exactly which password I had forgotten.

‚ÄúSomeone matched,‚Äù she said, her eyes on my face and nowhere else. ‚ÄúFull sibling match. It happens. Kids show up. Clinics did weird things in the nineties.‚Äù She smiled with no teeth. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a mystery, it seems.‚Äù

‚ÄúCongratulations?‚Äù Lena said. ‚ÄúAnother reason to celebrate.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt swallow for a second. I felt my pulse in the gaps of my molars. ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù I asked.

Maya put the last of the water on her tongue and held it like a coin. ‚ÄúMessage them,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see.‚Äù

We left with more or less the faces we‚Äôd brought. Outside, the night had that wet confessional quality it sometimes gets in September. Lena walked beside me like a secret that needed legs.

‚ÄúDo you do those sites?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI do everything I shouldn‚Äôt,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou?‚Äù

‚ÄúI let my mother talk me into it. She wanted to prove she‚Äôs part Basque.‚Äù I heard my voice and didn't recognize the pettiness. ‚ÄúThey keep the data, you know. They sell it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course they do,‚Äù she said cheerfully. ‚ÄúSome of us are worth more in pieces.‚Äù

Back upstairs, I tried to sleep. The building made its list of noises. I turned over and over until that felt like a ritual. At three-thirteen my phone buzzed. A match request. Full sibling. The name on the screen made the walls exhale: LENA C‚Äî‚Äî. The picture was her kitchen with the cactus. A short message: hi. quick weirdness. call if you‚Äôre awake?

I stared at my ceiling like it was going to answer the questions my head was filing. Then I walked across the hall and knocked.

She didn‚Äôt act surprised. ‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs pretend it‚Äôs not four AM.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou matched me.‚Äù

‚ÄúSeems like it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think someone made a mistake in a room with a spinning chair.‚Äù She poured two drinks and didn‚Äôt seem drunk, which made me worry.

‚ÄúWhat does it mean?‚Äù I asked, even though I knew what it meant‚Äîthe blunt math of DNA, the way statistic weight becomes fate when it settles.

‚ÄúThat we share a father,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOr a mother. Do you want it to be the one you like less?‚Äù

I pictured my mother smoking an apology into a tissue. I pictured a man I‚Äôd never met donating parts of himself into a clinic refrigerator and calling it money. I pictured a hundred families with faces like mine and my face as a receipt.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have to be‚Ä¶close,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt could be a lab screwup.‚Äù

‚ÄúCould,‚Äù she said, that single corner of her mouth doing its work. ‚ÄúBut I already called the clinic. The woman on the phone got very quiet when I gave her your birthdate. Quiet like she had to put a hand somewhere to hold it down.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou just called.‚Äù

‚ÄúI call all kinds of people at all kinds of hours,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my gift.‚Äù

We drank in a silence that never relaxed. When I left, she hugged me in that careful way you hug someone you might have to throw away. ‚ÄúGoodnight, mirror,‚Äù she said.

The days that followed felt threaded together by one kind of string: a new noise under the old ones. Lena moved around her place like someone conducting a band only she could hear. A new smell‚Äîozone‚Äîjoined the chlorine and lemons and sat in the hall like it paid rent. I saw her at odd hours returning with groceries that looked like bait. She smiled at the supers with the affection of someone who collects things.

The building had a rhythm you obeyed or you didn‚Äôt. A boy on the fifth floor practiced piano in the afternoons; his scales were clean like math. Someone on two ran their dryer at midnight every night like a prayer. I started hearing something not on the list: a soft, intermittent tapping at just the height a hand makes when you knock and don‚Äôt want anyone to know. It came from inside Lena‚Äôs apartment. It stopped when I listened too hard.

We ran into Maya and Elliot again because that‚Äôs what proximity is‚Äîa curse that pretends to be chance. Maya was wearing a new pair of glasses that made her look like she wanted to edit you. ‚ÄúSo?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo the match.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt matches,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI figured,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre efficient at that.‚Äù Elliot squeezed her hand because it helps people like him to do something. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre happy for you,‚Äù he said, and I hated how he said we like a door closing softly.

I made the mistake of asking Maya how she was. She told me about her job and then she told me a story she had been saving for the moment she wanted to watch me climb out of my skin: ‚ÄúDo you ever think,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthat some people are purely reactive? Like they don‚Äôt have a self, they just reflect? You used to bend around me. It made me feel like I could be anything. It also made me feel like you were nothing. Elliot doesn‚Äôt do that.‚Äù She smiled, small, as if she‚Äôd finished a proof. ‚ÄúHe is what he is.‚Äù

‚ÄúCongratulations,‚Äù I said again, and realized I sounded like a priest who‚Äôs late to confession.

Back upstairs, Lena was in the hall with the super woman, both of them looking at a brown streak on the wall at knee height. ‚ÄúRust,‚Äù the super said. ‚ÄúPipe inside.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot rust,‚Äù Lena said. ‚ÄúA dog leaned against it.‚Äù She touched the streak with a gloved finger, smelled it, smiled. ‚ÄúA medium dog with a problem.‚Äù

The super looked at me like I could control what my neighbor found interesting. I shrugged like a man who rented honesty by the month.

The first missing poster went up two days later. Not for a dog. A woman this time. Smiling in the way people do for pictures taken by men who love them. The flyer was quick work, printed at a bodega, a number with too few repeats to be real. The building hummed. The boy on five switched from scales to Debussy with the stubbornness of a child who will make beauty even if it hurts someone.

It‚Äôs hard to explain exactly when I recognized something was wrong and harder to explain why I did nothing about it except take notes I wouldn‚Äôt share with anyone. The chlorine got stronger. The ozone softened like a curtain had been closed around it. I saw Lena in the stairwell carrying a duffel bag with the shoulders of a person trained by sports she never played in public. She smiled at me like she had pockets full of prizes. ‚ÄúBig plans tonight, mirror?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúI have to do laundry.‚Äù

‚ÄúLiberation for lint,‚Äù she said, and brushed past, leaving a smell I could only label as interference.

The news found the building the way wind finds corners. Not police sirens, not yet. A notification on my phone: body discovered near the river, woman last seen in our zip code. The article was old by the time I saw it; the city eats tragedy fast. No name given. Then one updated: name given. Not someone I recognized. Then: no suspect, DNA sample collected from under nails.

It took my brain an hour to notice the important part and my body another hour to admit that it had. The important part wasn‚Äôt the DNA. It was the phrase ‚ÄúDNA consistent with a close male relative of \[redacted for ongoing investigation\].‚Äù I didn‚Äôt sleep that night. I didn‚Äôt sleep the next. Sleep began to feel like something I had to deserve.

The second bar night wasn‚Äôt an accident. I went to push the door open just as Maya and Elliot were coming out, and we did the sidewalk choreography of strangers. ‚ÄúWe were just talking about you,‚Äù Maya said, in a tone that suggested it wasn‚Äôt slander if she would say it to my face.

‚ÄúBeware of that sentence,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never a blessing.‚Äù

‚ÄúWould you‚Äîdo you want a drink?‚Äù Elliot asked, because he‚Äôs a good person, which is simply a different kind of complication.

We sat at the bar and the bartender polished a glass like he was considering it for parole. Maya ordered soda water with lime and a bitter twist of judgement. She turned to me and set her voice to scalpel. ‚ÄúDid you read that piece about police using family DNA? They say it‚Äôs good for closure. They don‚Äôt talk about collateral.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do you keep bringing this up?‚Äù I asked, and felt my face flush, and hated my face for telling on me.

‚ÄúBecause I know you,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI know you think your life happens to you. I know you assume stories end when you close your eyes. They don‚Äôt.‚Äù

Elliot put his hand on her elbow. She shook it off like a dog shakes river water. ‚ÄúAnd because,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI got a call from a blocked number asking if you and I had ever‚Ä¶shared DNA. Intimately. They were polite about it. Clinical. But the question was the question.‚Äù

I stared at the bartender‚Äôs hands until they weren‚Äôt hands anymore. ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù

‚ÄúI said we were careful,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhich is a lie people tell to feel like they‚Äôre not part of anything.‚Äù

Elliot paid the bill because that‚Äôs what men like him do when they can‚Äôt fix the world with a wrench. Maya kissed his cheek, a gesture as practiced as a signature. When they left, Lena appeared in the mirror behind the bar like a magician whose trick is timing.

‚ÄúYou look like a man who just learned he has organs,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúHow much do you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúEnough,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúEnough to be fluent.‚Äù She smiled at our twin faces in the mirror and tilted her head to make them match. ‚ÄúDo you want to hear the story or do you want to keep inventing it?‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were donor-conceived,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMe too. Same clinic. The doctor liked to save money. Pool donors, reuse what should have been discarded, play armies with lives. He liked to think of it as charity. The law doesn‚Äôt catch up to men like that. You and I were born near each other but far enough that nobody would trip on a coincidence.‚Äù She finished my whiskey. ‚ÄúYou can shake your head if it helps.‚Äù

I shook my head because it was something to do. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt explain‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy the city smells like a swimming pool?‚Äù she asked brightly. ‚ÄúWhy your phone keeps buzzing with news? Why you‚Äôre suddenly interesting to people who do math with probability and handcuffs?‚Äù She leaned close. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not paying attention. That‚Äôs the problem with mirrors. They show you, but only the surface.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me what‚Äôs happening,‚Äù I said, and heard the thin whine of pleading in my voice, and wanted to bite it out.

She put a hand on my knee like a nurse about to lie. ‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNothing is happening. Go home.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt. I sat there until the bar emptied and the bartender put chairs on tables and the night exhaled. When I went upstairs, there was a new flyer on the bulletin board. This one didn‚Äôt have a picture. Just a note written in a neat, angry hand: ‚ÄúStop poisoning the hallways. Some of us have children.‚Äù Someone had underlined children twice until it gnawed the paper.

The knocks started the next night at three. A slow, patient tapping from inside Lena‚Äôs door as if someone were asking to be let out and had learned to be polite about it. I sat with my ear against the wood until my ear heard blood. I knocked back once‚Äîa childish, stupid thing. The tapping paused and then resumed but closer, like it had made a choice.

I don‚Äôt know if it makes sense to say this, but the air got heavy. Like a storm thinking something over. The building‚Äôs bones ached. The piano on five had switched to minor. The dryer on two paused mid-prayer.

I didn‚Äôt open the door. I don‚Äôt know what would have happened if I had. Maybe nothing. Maybe something that would make this all easier to tell because there would be a scene, an image, a nerve I could point to. Instead I went to my bathroom and turned on the shower and sat on the tile and tried to hide from water.

Two days later, a different kind of paper appeared on the bulletin board: a letterhead with a badge and a phone number. ‚ÄúThis is a courtesy notification,‚Äù it said, ‚Äúthat officers may be conducting inquiries in your building related to an ongoing investigation. We appreciate your cooperation.‚Äù There was a smiley face drawn in blue pen next to the word appreciate. Below, someone had written: CLEAN YOUR FILTH. Below that, in different ink: KID SAW A DEAD CAT IN A BAG.

I didn‚Äôt ask the supers. The supers never knew anything with their mouths. They knew everything with their eyebrows. Their eyebrows that day made steps downward.

When the police finally came to my door, it was not with handcuffs. It was with questions that want hands. ‚ÄúMr. R‚Äî‚Äî?‚Äù the younger one said. ‚ÄúDo you have a minute?‚Äù

They asked if I knew the woman in the photo. I didn‚Äôt. They asked if I had seen anything unusual. I lied in the way that protects you until it doesn‚Äôt. They asked if I‚Äôd be willing to provide a buccal swab ‚Äúto eliminate you,‚Äù and the way they said eliminate made the hallway feel like a throat.

I said I needed to call someone. They said of course. I went inside and called Maya because my nervous system has old paths it enjoys walking even when they no longer go anywhere. She didn‚Äôt pick up. I called Lena. She did.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre here,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúLet them in,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBe helpful. Smile with your teeth. Think clean thoughts.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause the story requires it.‚Äù She hung up.

They took the swab. I watched the cotton disappear into a plastic tube that looked like a calm disaster. The older one told me not to worry. He had a face that had learned to be furniture inside bad rooms. When they left, I sat on my couch and looked at the door in the way a dog looks at a door when it knows the person on the other side is not coming back.

For a day or two, I did the things you do when pretending to have a life. I went to work and typed words into boxes that were not hungry for them. I bought food I didn‚Äôt want because the routine of food is a kind of leash. I slept for hours at the wrong times and woke up with the shape of my body carved into the couch. I didn‚Äôt go to the bar. I didn‚Äôt knock on Lena‚Äôs door. I listened to the building relearn its noise.

This is the part where I should tell you why I didn‚Äôt run. I didn‚Äôt run because I didn‚Äôt think it was about me. I didn‚Äôt run because running would make a story and I had been escaping stories my whole life by refusing to have a shape. I didn‚Äôt run because something in me wanted to see how exactly the knife was going to fall.

It fell on a Monday. Late afternoon light was in that mood where it turns the hallway into a photograph of itself. I heard voices in the stairwell and then the wet slam of a body‚Äôs weight on tile. I opened my door because curiosity and duty look the same from the inside. Down the stairs, there was a smear where a shape had been dragged. A woman‚Äôs shoe lay on its side with the exhausted dignity of an object after it‚Äôs done its job. The smell of chlorine announced itself like a guest you can‚Äôt turn away.

Lena‚Äôs door was ajar. The apartment beyond was wrong in small ways. The cactus had been broken and reset with tape. The towels were folded into new animals. There was a line of mint candies along the kitchen counter like breadcrumbs left by a person without a destination. The bathroom door was closed, and under it the light made a desirous line.

‚ÄúLena?‚Äù I called. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù she said, which is what she always said.

I opened the door and found a mirror that didn‚Äôt need glass. She lay in the tub like it had grown around her. The water was clear and angry-smelling. Her hair floated like ideas. Her arms were a ruin of red. The way the cuts ran told me a story I didn‚Äôt want: deliberate, practiced, a kind of calligraphy. I made the mistake every story wants you to make and stepped forward.

On the sink, laid out with the kind of love a thief gives a secret, were the artifacts of me: a toothbrush, a razor, a comb with my hair still in it. A glass with a rim that knew my mouth. A napkin from the bar with my lip‚Äôs print. My DNA collected like stamps. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù I said, and meant it for time.

‚ÄúYou took too long,‚Äù she whispered. Her voice had the high, thin quality of distance. ‚ÄúIt needed to be today.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I vanish better on Mondays,‚Äù she said, and coughed a laugh that came with bubbles. ‚ÄúAnd because you finally noticed.‚Äù

I reached for the towel. ‚ÄúGet up.‚Äù

She shook her head in the calm, stubborn way of someone who will not be made. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ruin it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt has to look like you were here, frantic. It has to look like you love me. It has to look like you did it and then tried not to have done it.‚Äù

I stared at her and the room tilted until the world was a trap door. ‚ÄúYou want them to think‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI want the story to end correctly,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúA woman is dead because a man thought he was the absence of choices. The city is a stomach with teeth. The police will do math with samples. The mouth of the bottle will lead to you. The math will say we match. They‚Äôll call it science. You‚Äôll call it corruption. Your ex will call it closure. The husband will bring her water and she‚Äôll drink it like a tarnish. And the kid‚Äî‚Äù She blinked, a slow, underwater blink. ‚ÄúThe kid will do what kids do when they believe what they‚Äôve been shown.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kid?‚Äù I asked, and then I heard it‚Äîthe tapping. Not from the bathroom but from behind the closet door beside me. A slow, patient knock at a height that made my stomach drop. I opened the closet because I had to know which story I was in.

Inside, on a chair with a coat folded like a parent, sat a boy of maybe twelve. Brown hair that could have been mine if mine remembered how to be that age. Eyes that had learned too much patience. He looked at me and then at Lena and then at me again, as if you could tell who someone is by checking twice.

‚ÄúI told you not now,‚Äù Lena said to him, gently. He didn‚Äôt move. His hands were in his lap, folded into apology. He had a thin red line on his wrist as if he‚Äôd practiced.

I didn‚Äôt know Lena had a child. I didn‚Äôt know if he was hers. I didn‚Äôt know if he was ours. I didn‚Äôt know anything except that the room had become a crime I hadn‚Äôt been trained for. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù I asked him, which is a stupid question for a child sitting in a closet.

‚ÄúWaiting,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor you,‚Äù he said, and in his voice I heard my own shape‚Äîeven the parts I had refused to keep. DNA isn‚Äôt blood. It‚Äôs a plot. ‚ÄúShe said you‚Äôd come.‚Äù

Lena watched us like a director about to yell cut. ‚ÄúHe likes you,‚Äù she said, and there was real warmth in it, which made me want to set fire to the idea of warmth.

I wrapped one of the towels around her arm and she hissed like the towel had insulted her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be an idiot,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs already written.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not,‚Äù I said, and my voice cracked in a way that betrayed how much I wanted it not to be. ‚ÄúYou can stop.‚Äù

She looked at the boy with a tenderness that made my teeth ache. ‚ÄúHe needs a reason,‚Äù she said quietly. ‚ÄúHe needs a scene to act out when it‚Äôs time to reenact. This is the cleanest reason I could give him.‚Äù

The boy looked down at his hands. He wasn‚Äôt crying. He had the dry-eyed stare of someone who has practiced not needing. I took a step toward him and he flinched so little you could call it a trick of light.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù I asked.

He shook his head. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù

Lena smiled in that sideways way and blood made its argument with the white towel. ‚ÄúHe won‚Äôt use the one I gave him,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt believe in gifts.‚Äù

Sirens arrive before they arrive; you hear them in your bones first. The building shifted, listening. The piano on five held a note and stopped. The dryer on two forgot its prayer. I heard feet in the hall. I heard the supers say something too fast for words. I heard our story catching up.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I said to Lena, and meant everything and nothing.

She reached up and touched my cheek with the hand that wasn‚Äôt ruined. Her fingers were cold and kind. ‚ÄúYou can be anything,‚Äù she said, and smiled in a way that made me understand how she had survived this long. ‚ÄúYou chose to be fog. Fog is a thing that lets other things happen in it. That‚Äôs your crime.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt remember everything about the next minutes. I remember pulling the plug because water felt like a cliff. I remember the boy moving without moving, slipping out of the closet and past me with the grace of someone invisible. I remember Lena‚Äôs eyes on him like a benediction and on me like the opposite. I remember the door opening on policemen and the hallway widening into accusation.

The rest unspooled at angles. They took my hands and smiled and told me to breathe as if breath hadn‚Äôt been what brought me here. They asked questions with their bodies and with their mouths. I answered with a mouth that didn‚Äôt feel like mine. The towel in my hands made an object lesson out of being caught red-handed. The evidence laid itself out like a confession. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll sort it,‚Äù the older one said, and I could tell he meant it in the way you mean sorting socks. The building watched and took notes.

They found the boy later. Not in the closet. Not in the hallway. On the roof, sitting close to the edge as if listening. The supers had a key and a prayer. The police had a loud voice and a quiet one. I had nothing anyone needed. When they reached him, he stood up with the careful deliberation of a person measuring what is owed. He looked down at the street and then at us and then at the far buildings with their windows like eyes. He didn‚Äôt jump to make a point. He jumped because the story had been loaded and the mechanism released and even good men with late-night DNA and better intentions couldn‚Äôt catch him.

After, it was all brightness and forms. They took my statement in a room that smelled like coffee futures. They swabbed my mouth again because some beasts must be fed. They told me not to go anywhere and I nodded like I had places to be. I called Maya because even a person you left will sometimes be the person you meant to call when your life falls apart. She came, because she is not a villain. She sat in a plastic chair and didn‚Äôt touch me. Elliot stood behind her with his hand on her shoulder and his set jaw and his enormous kindness like a piece of furniture that couldn‚Äôt be moved.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll think it‚Äôs you,‚Äù she said, in the voice of a scientist who loves her microscope more than her subject.

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have gone in,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should have called.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I said, and realized I had been saying I know my whole life as a way to stop other people from entering.

The detective came back with a face like a diet. ‚ÄúThe lab is fast when it wants to be,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe blood in the tub is a mess. Too much chlorine. Too much mixing. But the samples around the apartment, the items in the bathroom‚Ä¶they‚Äôre yours.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre mine because they‚Äôre mine,‚Äù I said, and laughed in a way that hurts a throat.

He nodded like we were partners in a comedy. ‚ÄúThe blood under the fingernails of the prior victim was a partial,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut now, with yours, the database is confident. The word is match. You understand what that means?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt means story,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt means you get to close the file.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt means we have questions,‚Äù he said, deftly, and sat down. ‚ÄúHow well did you know Ms. C‚Äî‚Äî?‚Äù

‚ÄúBetter than I met her,‚Äù I said.

Maya took a breath like a monsoon. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt do this,‚Äù she said, as if saying it changed mass.

The detective looked at her with a softness that surprised me. ‚ÄúI have a kid,‚Äù he said, as if that meant anything, and maybe it does. ‚ÄúWhen my wife and I fight, he folds napkins into shapes. Swans, usually. He makes them fly across the table. It‚Äôs how he decides which parent is the river.‚Äù He turned back to me. ‚ÄúYou want a lawyer?‚Äù

‚ÄúI want a time machine,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYou can have the lawyer,‚Äù he said, and handed me a card like a napkin.

The days since are a string of things tied together by a hand not mine. They didn‚Äôt charge me that first week, which is a kind of cruelty. They let me go home to an apartment that has been cleaned the way a room is cleaned when you have to erase not just dirt but the concept of dirt. The hallway still smells like lemons and chlorine and the ozone that comes when you scrub the past with a wire brush. The supers keep their eyebrows to themselves. The boy‚Äôs chair is gone from the closet but there is a square of carpet there that looks like a question. The piano on five returned to scales with a persistence that embarrassed me.

The thing about family DNA is that it‚Äôs not a thread you voluntarily pull. It‚Äôs the seam that gives when someone else decides you‚Äôre a sweater. The clinic sent me a letter written by a lawyer who loves numbers more than nouns: apologies for the ‚Äúlack of clarity in donor usage policies,‚Äù apologies for ‚Äúresultant alignment of identities,‚Äù apologies for ‚Äúthe difficulty you may be experiencing.‚Äù No money. No explanation that doesn‚Äôt require a second explanation.

I have a lawyer. He is a man who doesn‚Äôt flinch when you say blood. He says the case is more theater than substance. He says chlorine complicates everything. He says police math can be argued with if you bring your own numbers. He says the dead boy complicates everything in the opposite direction. ‚ÄúJuries are sentimental,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey will want a shape they can recognize.‚Äù

I‚Äôve been asked to stay offline. Of course I‚Äôm not. I read everything. I read the comments under articles and the comments under those comments where people do their own math. I read a thread where someone with a username that sounds like a threat explains how genealogical databases are maps and maps mean there‚Äôs a destination whether you like it or not. I read the way the word match is used like destiny. I read the way people want to believe stories end where they‚Äôre convenient to end.

Lena‚Äôs obituary is a paragraph that chooses its words like a bomb squad. It calls her a beloved daughter and an avid swimmer and a person whose smile lit rooms, which is true if you‚Äôve ever seen a fire. It does not say mother. It does not say anything about me. Maya sent it to me with no note. I stared at the word beloved until it stopped being a word.

The boy‚Äôs obituary is shorter. It doesn‚Äôt say his name. It says a ‚Äúyouth beloved by his community,‚Äù which means, in this case, a building where people listen at doors. It says donations can be made to a foundation whose name is designed to make you feel like you can change a future without having to forgive a past. I tried to make a donation and then closed the tab before entering my card. It felt like trying to wash a bloodstain out with more blood.

You want the worst part? It isn‚Äôt the police. It isn‚Äôt the DNA. It isn‚Äôt even the way the hall still sounds like someone knocking softly to be let out. The worst part is that I keep having the thought, uninvited and unforgivable: that she was right about me. That I chose fog. That I allowed a story to pick me up and place me where it needed me to be because it‚Äôs easier to be used than to be something. I can‚Äôt tell if that thought is an infection or a cure.

I ran into Maya and Elliot again last night because proximity is a habit. She looked at me like a scientist looking at the wrong sample. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll make their case,‚Äù she said, not unkindly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll make ours.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe?‚Äù I asked.

She sighed and for a moment looked tired in the way you only look when you stop for a second on a staircase and admit how far up you are. ‚ÄúYou were a part of my life,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat makes me part of yours whether or not a judge agrees.‚Äù

Elliot shook my hand. His grip was the same‚Äîit made me feel like a piece of wood that might be useful later. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about the kid,‚Äù he said, and his voice had a break in it, and I realized he had been a boy once, too.

I don‚Äôt know how this ends, which I suppose is honest. Maybe it ends with a court date and a judge and a word that sounds like a verdict and tastes like metal. Maybe it ends with me leaving the city with a new name and an old face. Maybe it ends with another knock under another door and me deciding to open it. Maybe it ends with me learning the piano scales from the boy upstairs, even if he doesn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs teaching.

Here are the parts I can say without lying: the hallway still smells like lemons and chlorine and a third thing I can‚Äôt identify. The supers keep their keys on finger hooks and never look like they sleep. The cactus grew a crooked new arm where it was taped. The towel I used is gone and I dream about it. The bar pours whiskey that knows my mouth. I keep my toothbrush in a drawer and count its bristles.

Sometimes at three in the morning, I wake to the tapping again. It‚Äôs faint now, like memory. I lay there and listen to each knock like it might be the last. I don‚Äôt knock back. I don‚Äôt open the door. I don‚Äôt call anyone. I stay very still and tell myself I can be something if I remain a shape long enough. I recite this like a prayer against a religion I no longer understand.

The other night, I heard a new sound after the tapping: a child‚Äôs footsteps, hesitant and then sure. I sat up and went to the door and pressed my forehead against it. On the other side, something paused and then moved away. I waited until the building resumed its list of acceptable noises.

This is the closest thing to a moral I have. There‚Äôs a line on the bulletin board now, written in thick marker under the finger-keys and the cat poster and the notice about paint chips: IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING. Beneath it, in smaller letters someone has added: IF YOU FEEL SOMETHING, DO SOMETHING. Beneath that, in a different hand: IF YOU ARE SOMETHING, BE SOMETHING.

I‚Äôm trying.

I‚Äôm writing this because there‚Äôs a chance that‚Äôs what being something looks like for me. I‚Äôm writing this because somewhere in a drawer there‚Äôs a bag with my hair in it and somewhere in a database there‚Äôs my mouth and somewhere on a roof the wind is still measuring the shape of a boy who made a choice because a woman loved him in a way that sharpened the world.

They will say, if it comes to that, that the science is sure. They will say matches don‚Äôt lie. They will use words like inevitable and pattern and profile and match again and again until the word stops asking permission and becomes a law. They won‚Äôt mention chlorine or lemons or mints on a counter or towels folded into animals or a cactus that learned to grow around its wound.

I have a different word I keep in my pocket like a talisman: mirror. It is a word that does nothing by itself. It needs someone to stand in front of it. It needs a face. It needs a choice.

Tonight I‚Äôm going to the bar. I‚Äôm going to sit where I can see the mirror and not my face but the room behind it: the door, the hall, the stairs, the place where a shoe waited, the hooks shaped like fingers, the board with its ugly honesty. I‚Äôm going to order water because I don‚Äôt trust anything that burns. If Maya and Elliot walk in, I‚Äôll nod and not wait to be forgiven. If the detective walks in, I‚Äôll nod and not wait to be condemned. If the boy walks in‚Äîif he does, if he can‚ÄîI‚Äôll stand up and ask him what song he wants to hear and then I‚Äôll learn it even if my hands shake.

When the tapping comes, I‚Äôll open the door. I‚Äôm saying that here so I can‚Äôt pretend I didn‚Äôt mean it. I‚Äôll open it and I won‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù and I won‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúGo away.‚Äù I‚Äôll ask what is needed and I will try not to be fog.

If you‚Äôre reading this because you live with thin walls and you tell yourself that‚Äôs a kind of safety, consider this your sign. Remove the mint from the trash. Throw out the chlorine. Know that science is a vocabulary for truth and also for hiding what truth makes us do. Know that matches can be masks. Know that sometimes a woman can be a door and a knife and a mirror and a mother all at once and that none of those things excuse the others. Know that sometimes children take our scripts and recite them to the last line. Know that a hallway is a mouth.

I don‚Äôt know how long I can stay here. The building learned my steps and now I hear myself when anyone walks. The cactus is thriving in a way that feels like a rebuke. The piano on five is moving to pieces with names. The dryer on two is faithful. The supers‚Äô eyebrows tell a story I‚Äôm not fluent in. The bar glasses keep their shine. The DNA sites send me emails about new cousins as if the solution to a problem of blood is more blood.

If anyone asks me what I saw, I will tell the truth, such as it is: I saw a person who decided the shape of her life with knives and a person who tried not to decide the shape of his at all and a child who believed both and stepped into the only space left. I saw a city that treats stories like currency and blood like a ledger. I saw a hallway that learned a new smell and couldn‚Äôt unlearn it.

There‚Äôs a knock at the door now. Not the tapping. A full, crisp, daylight knock. I‚Äôm going to answer it. I‚Äôm going to be something. If it‚Äôs the police, I‚Äôll give them my mouth again and let them think they own it. If it‚Äôs Maya, I‚Äôll let her science me and try to remember that observation without contamination is a lie. If it‚Äôs a neighbor with a complaint about the lemons, I‚Äôll buy them limes.

If it‚Äôs a boy with dry eyes, I‚Äôll say his name even if he doesn‚Äôt.

If it‚Äôs you, and you live in a building like mine and you think thin walls mean someone will hear you if you knock‚Äîconsider this me knocking back.",1,1754698417.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

The Brian Lara Cricket Academy in Trinidad is about to host a clash that‚Äôs part international rivalry, part chess match, and 100% crickety chaos. Let‚Äôs break down why Pakistan is favored to win this ODI‚Äîand why the West Indies might still pull off a Houdini act.

### Parsing the Odds: Why Pakistan‚Äôs Price Tag Feels Like a Sale

The bookmakers have Pakistan at **decimal odds of 1.3** (implied probability: **76.9%**), while the West Indies sit at **3.45** (**28.9%**). If this were a sale at your local cricket shop, Pakistan would be the 50%-off clearance item‚Äîstill expensive, but *technically* a deal. The West Indies? They‚Äôre the ‚Äúbuy one, get one 300% more confused‚Äù special.

Pakistan‚Äôs recent form is a mixed bag: they‚Äôve won three of four bilateral ODI series but got thrashed 3-0 by New Zealand. Meanwhile, the West Indies are riding a **four-match home ODI winning streak**, which feels less like a streak and more like a Lara-ge (yes, that‚Äôs a pun) of confidence.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Comebacks, and a Very Tired Shepherd

**West Indies**: Captain Shai Hope is their emotional and statistical backbone, but their bowling attack is missing Alzarri Joseph (rested due to ‚Äúworkload management‚Äù‚Äîread: he‚Äôs human). Enter Romario Shepherd, whose name sounds like a dairy farmer but whose bowling might be less predictable than a weather forecast in Trinidad.

**Pakistan**: Babar Azam is here to remind everyone why he‚Äôs the ‚ÄúKing of the ODI Batting Thronedom.‚Äù Saim Ayub, fresh off a fractured ankle, returns like a phoenix‚Ä¶ if the phoenix in question had spent three weeks on a couch eating pizza.

**Parse the Odds: When Math Meets Mayhem**  
Australia (-224) is the overwhelming favorite against France (+400) in this T20 clash, with implied probabilities of **72.5%** for the Aussies and **20%** for the French. These numbers aren‚Äôt just stats‚Äîthey‚Äôre a mathematical middle finger to France‚Äôs ambitions. For context, Australia‚Äôs T20 squad isn‚Äôt even resting their *A* team; they‚Äôre resting their *B* team‚Äôs coffee break. Star fast bowlers Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins are on a tropical vacation called ‚ÄúNot This Series, Mate,‚Äù while France fields a squad that includes players named ‚ÄúWhy Not?‚Äù and ‚ÄúEiffel Tower.‚Äù

**Digest the News: Injuries, Absences, and Kangaroos**  
Australia‚Äôs lineup is a masterclass in ‚Äúmeh, we‚Äôll wing it.‚Äù Without Starc and Cummins, their pace attack loses two of its three most dangerous weapons‚Äîthough they‚Äôve still got Mitchell Marsh to flick on the afterburner. France, meanwhile, is a team of contradictions: they‚Äôve got a player named ‚ÄúDupont‚Äù (yes, like the rugby guy) and a coach who once declared, ‚ÄúCricket is like chess‚Ä¶ but with more hex.‚Äù Oh, and Linde (Trent Rockets‚Äô Swiss Army knife) is MIA for South Africa‚Äôs T20 series, replaced by Akeal Hosein, who‚Äôs basically the cricketing equivalent of a Swiss Army knife‚Äôs missing screwdriver.

1mlbdb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1mlbdb1/i_miss_my_exboyfriend_update/,I miss my ex-boyfriend - UPDATE,"It‚Äôs been two months since my first post, which you can see on my profile, and three months since the break up, and we‚Äôve done the meet-up that I mentioned. Also, I‚Äôm fully moved out and living with my friend

Before I get into how it went, I want to thank the comments on my first post. You didn‚Äôt let me get my hopes up about him staying in my life. I always would‚Äôve understood if he didn‚Äôt want to, and I always would‚Äôve respected his decision, even if it hurt. Instead of going in and it hurting more that he wouldn‚Äôt want to stay in my life after I hoped for it, I went in without an expectation. I didn‚Äôt assume the worst, but I tried to not have an expectation

We decided not to talk for about three months. I figured that was enough time for me to figure myself out fully and completely, and I needed to do that while not talking to him. Even if I came out of it not a lesbian, I don‚Äôt think we would‚Äôve gotten back together. So the three months gave him time to start the healing process. Then at our meet-up, we would talk about how we found life without each other, and I would share if I figured myself out. That was always the plan - because he also said that he couldn‚Äôt see a life without me

Now, the update. The first thing I did was confirm my sexuality, that I‚Äôm a lesbian, and I apologized for stealing six years of his life, basically everything I said at the end of my last post. He surprised me with his response. He said that the six years weren‚Äôt a waste, that he didn‚Äôt regret a single moment of our time spent together. He said I was his best friend before, and I always was his best friend, that he didn‚Äôt just lose a girlfriend (I accidentally left out the fact that we were friends for about two years before getting together in my last post). He said that he always saw me as more than just his girlfriend, that I was my own person outside of being his girlfriend, and that I‚Äôm now a person outside of being his ex. He said that I helped him become the person he is, that I gave him a safe space to learn and grow. He said he wouldn‚Äôt trade the years for anything

I didn‚Äôt know what to say to that. I was just silent. As much as I didn‚Äôt want to go in with any expectations, I was still expecting him to resent me, and maybe he does and doesn‚Äôt want to tell me, but that meant more than I could imagine

He knows me well, so I think he knew I didn‚Äôt have a response, and he kept talking. He said that he did research on lesbians, on comphet, sexuality, all of it. He wanted to understand me, he said he didn‚Äôt want to be that guy who acted like a jerk just because he didn‚Äôt understand. He said he obviously wouldn‚Äôt understand fully, but he thinks he has a good grasp. I said that he didn‚Äôt have to do that, and he said that he wanted to be the best friend he could for me

After that discussion, I told him my revelations that he was my best friend, and just how important that was to me. Also listed in my previous post (sorry, just don‚Äôt want to repeat myself, haha). He said he came to that conclusion, too, but he does still have romantic feelings for me. He says he‚Äòs not ready for me to be fully back in his life yet, which is completely understandable, and that he wants a few more months, or however long it takes, to keep going  with the healing process and to try to get over me. He said that if I‚Äôm down, we can meet up once a month for coffee or lunch, and slowly build on our friendship more and slowly bring each other back in our lives, as it wouldn‚Äôt be healthy to interact like we used to immediately, and I agreed

I don‚Äôt think there will be another update, so another thank you to the comments. Not sure how to end this post, haha, so this is the end

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Australia vs. South Africa T20 Series: A Kangaroo‚Äôs Stroll or a Springbok‚Äôs Surprise?**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a T20 clash where Australia‚Äôs ‚ÄúA-Team‚Äù meets South Africa‚Äôs ‚ÄúB-Team minus David Miller.‚Äù The odds? Australia is the statistical equivalent of a kangaroo in a cricket uniform‚Äîunstoppable and slightly terrifying. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a dot ball and the humor of a stump mic that‚Äôs *just* loud enough.

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie (Unless They‚Äôre on a Bookmaker‚Äôs Spreadsheet)

The bookmakers are throwing their weight behind Australia, with decimal odds ranging from **1.41 to 1.47** (implied probabilities of **68-71%**). South Africa, meanwhile, is priced between **2.8 and 2.96** (**34-36%**). Translating this to real-world terms: Australia is the coffee machine in Darwin that never runs out of espresso. South Africa? They‚Äôre the ‚Äúfringe players‚Äù reality TV show‚Äîentertaining, but not exactly a sure bet.

Why the lopsided pricing? Australia‚Äôs recent form (22 wins in 26 matches) screams ‚Äúdominance,‚Äù while South Africa is using this series as a dress rehearsal for their T20 World Cup understudies. Even with Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins on the sidelines, Australia‚Äôs return of Travis Head (a man who turns boundaries into afterthoughts) and Josh Hazlewood (the bowling equivalent of a firewall) makes them a fortress. South Africa‚Äôs absence of David Miller, their Swiss Army knife of a batter, is like bringing a spoon to a sword fight.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Strategy, and the Art of Geo-Blocking

Australia‚Äôs management has opted to rest their star pacemen, presumably to avoid overuse. Think of it as taking your car‚Äôs ‚Äúsport mode‚Äù for a joyride‚Äîstill fast, just slightly less terrifying for the transmission. South Africa, on the other hand, is rolling out a squad that reads like a ‚ÄúMost Likely to Survive a Cricket Apocalypse‚Äù list. Fringe players? Check. No David Miller? Check. A team that‚Äôs 60% ‚Äúwho?‚Äù according to your grandpa? Double-chec

1mlbb81,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1mlbb81/i_have_no_friendswondering_if_this_gets_better/,I have no friends‚Ä¶wondering if this gets better,"I moved from my beloved African country (yes I am adding to the disproportionately high number of black woman on this subreddit) (no this is not my first account) for many many reasons but mainly to pursue higher education in Paris, and hopefully build a life here. Honestly there were so many advantages ‚Äî free education, great quality of education, all the discounts students get ‚Äî I really felt like this was the best choice for me. I‚Äôm done with undergraduate, going on to masters, sooo I‚Äôm three years in; and I cannot say that I have a good friend here.

I thought I could easily make friends at university and I thought that the fact that I was from such a different country would peak some curiosity in people I interact with, but it turns out when I say what country I‚Äôm from most of the time they don‚Äôt even know it exists and just think ‚ÄòAfrique noire‚Äô, and are completely disinterested. The only friend I had was my ex-boyfriend who in hindsight definitely had an African fetish as well as a feederism thing going on (gained 20kg with him, he even took away my scale and told me it was lying. When I lost the weight, that‚Äôs when he admitted he was taking actions to ensure I gain weight because all the women in his family are fat). Anyways, we‚Äôve been broken up for a year and a half anyways. I made friends with this group of North African girls‚Ä¶all have black boyfriends‚Ä¶weird that the entire time I‚Äôve been living here no black guys have taken a real interest in me beyond sex. Anyways, I was cut off because the one boyfriend was making sexual advances to me (that I rejected!!!) and apparently that was my fault. 

Nightlife here is boring. People don‚Äôt dance. The clubs have taken a toll on my self-esteem, I‚Äôve only attempted twice. First time I was immediately rejected, I suppose I wasn‚Äôt attractive enough but it was a real shock to my system because back home getting into a club was as easy as being a woman who is not morbidly obese. Second time was okay I guess, no one was dancing, drinks were expensive, and the bouncer got my number from a friend and went on to call me and text me obsessively for about a month. I wouldn‚Äôt even respond, but he would just carry on, so I had to block him. Also, I‚Äôve been to bars here and they‚Äôre not exactly places where you make friends. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶you go there with your own friends and leave with your own friends; even if you make small talk with other people, it‚Äôs really not as if it goes anywhere. 

I‚Äôve been trying this Timeleft app, absolute bore. A table of six people, deeply introverted westerners. You can take the girl out of Africa, but you can‚Äôt take the African out of the girl ‚Äî in social settings I am quite extroverted and really not afraid to speak up. I‚Äôve been to like three of these, every singe time, I become the centre of the conversation because‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know if people are just shy or if they genuinely do not have much to say. When I need to be, I am a conversationalist and I can talk about most topics. I try to engage people, I try to ask open ended questions; the responses are always very surface level. Goes without saying, this has gone absolutely nowhere. None of these people have reached out to me, and I have not reached out to any of them. 

I‚Äôve met expats. A lot have been really out of touch Americans who claim they‚Äôre not rich, but by most measures they actually are. Also met a weird amount of American men in their early 30s claiming they have ADHD, come to find their symptoms seem more in line with drug addiction,,,and a lot of them are. The African girls are hypocritical Quran/Bible bashers who almost always have some level of contempt for people from my country. The Brits are always surprised that I speak good English, as if I‚Äôm not from a former British colony. I could go on but this post is already super long. 

From time to time I see my older neighbour. She‚Äôs only really willing to hangout if it means we can gossip or I can help her with someone. 

Just wishing I had literally a friend, a person that I could just message any day and ask to get a coffee or a drink or something like this. There‚Äôs a few acquaintances here and there, but truly outside of coincidence, I only see those people once every three months. There was a point where I was putting in a real effort to make consistent plans with them. It got to a point where they would always have a reason they couldn‚Äôt make it, so I stopped asking, and they literally never reached out. 

I‚Äôve visited Berlin and Amsterdam‚Äî found that people were more social and friendly in a way that felt familiar to me and that made social interactions just so much easier. For these past years I feel as if I have been just talking into thin air, as if my words go nowhere, but it is a comfort that there are still places on this earth where I feel somewhat normal. I‚Äôm thinking of transferring to a different university in a different country, but I also am not sure if that will help things.

I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll ever read this. But I‚Äôm sending it anyway.

You want to know why I‚Äôve gone no contact. Why it feels cold. Why it looks like betrayal. It‚Äôs not because I stopped caring. And it‚Äôs not to punish you. I left because this situation broke me. I could not spend another day in what amounted to non-consensual, unethical non-monogamy with asymmetrical expectations around intimacy and fidelity.

You stated clearly from the start no poly, no sharing, one partner at a time. That was your hard line. Mine too. One of the founding agreements of the relationship.

In March, we got serious. I forced my family out a year early because you were getting jealous. I stopped sleeping in the same bed as my then STBX and turned my basement into a separate living space. I was upfront with everyone. Not because I owed it to her, but because I wanted a clean slate. I was building a bridge assuming you‚Äôd meet me halfway. You said you would. After graduation. After May 31st. That was the plan.

Then came the delays. Therapy. More time. Six months. Then back to two. I offered everything. My home. My time. My money. I offered to move, take any job, let you ease in however you needed. You canceled a visit as I was walking out the door. Refused to reschedule. Wouldn‚Äôt even discuss it. Every time I tried to clarify or set a boundary, you dodged it, changed the subject, or made it about my reaction.

The mental health crisis didn‚Äôt come out of nowhere. I told you up front I‚Äôm a twice deployed combat vet, early 40s, ACE score of 8, MDD, past self harm, abandonment trauma, just out of a marriage I learned had been a lie. I said clearly need you to protect my heart. Treat it gently. Two months apart is the max I can handle. I told you I didn‚Äôt know how I was going to make it.

By then, I‚Äôd been living in near total isolation for a year. My house was a haunted space of loss. I told you that all the time. You accused me of being manipulative. I was begging. When it got worse, when I reached the edge, you ignored it. You kept sleeping beside your husband, turning your phone off nightly, knowing what it did to me. You told your combat vet boyfriend with a life expectancy of 46 you‚Äôre on your own, every night.

You scoffed at every attempt to mitigate the pain. It took four weeks of hell just to get you to admit it might be difficult for me. You kept repeating that you regulate long distance, why couldn‚Äôt I? When I broke down, you framed it as weakness. Then moral failure. Then made me apologize for being triggered by behavior you knew was triggering. You painted your husband as dangerous and made secrecy a necessity. I accepted that. I stayed silent. I defended you. And it turns out it was a lie. He‚Äôs harmless.

You said trauma made it hard to act. But you had capacity to lie about a concert. To post online like I was delusional. To moralize in public while I fell apart in private. That‚Äôs not trauma. That‚Äôs behavior.

You say I scared you when I got reactive. But your pattern was withhold, delay, gaslight, then call me unsafe when I reacted. You said it‚Äôs not reactive abuse if it's your trauma. But if you can‚Äôt keep us safe and don‚Äôt trust me to either, then someone has to drive. If you can‚Äôt co-pilot, get in the passenger seat. I‚Äôve always respected your limits. Never weaponized them. Never withheld love.

There are two moments I can‚Äôt come back from.

First, the danger narrative. It shaped everything. It justified your secrecy and delays. It won sympathy. And it was false. You weren‚Äôt trapped. You just weren‚Äôt ready.

Second, the concert lie. You went. You lied. When I found out, you gaslit me in the most unhinged way imaginable. I walked. For ten days, you posted all over Reddit about how to handle being falsely accused. I broke no contact to come back. You never checked on me. You acted only to make yourself feel better publicly. When I finally got the truth out of you, you reframed it as protecting me. Refused to apologize. That was manipulation. You knew it would devastate me. You did it anyway.

At this point, I can‚Äôt trust your self-reporting. Not after this. If we ever rebuild anything, it starts with external verification, co-authored safety plans, crisis roles, and the understanding that your reactivity doesn‚Äôt get to override our safety.

But we‚Äôre not there. And we may never be. The trauma symptoms are real. The relational instability is real. The physiological distress is real. The loneliness is real. I‚Äôm not lashing out. I‚Äôm telling you the truth because it‚Äôs the only way I could reach solid ground again. Hope was killing me. Constant hope was shredding me daily and you knew it.

I gave you a hard 30 day timeline. You dodged it. Then you revealed you were going to visit family and¬†*then*¬†move in. That made no sense. You refused to meet me in any neutral city. Rejected every offer I made. I showed you the data. I told you the toll. You said I was too much. Sent me a crisis line and an AI generated message that you loved me. Then left me on read for six hours. When you did reply, you were cold. Distant.

That night I unraveled. I sent a final message in caps I REALLY NEED YOU RIGHT NOW.

You left me on read.

I recorded a series of short goodbye videos. Tear streaked. Honest. Loving. You watched two. Then nothing. I unsent them. Blocked you everywhere but email. Our agreed emergency channel.

At first, all of this seemed plausible because of your framing‚Äîhe was dangerous, you were hiding for survival. But now I know better. The lies were conscious. Calculated. You protected the relationship you cared about. And gambled mine.

Then came the vacation. The concert. The excuses. The ‚Äúwe‚Äôll be together all day so I can‚Äôt talk much‚Äù trip. That broke something permanent in me.

I waited for you every day. Every car in my driveway, I checked‚Äîwas it you? After fights, I cleaned the house, prepped your coffee, stocked your favorites. You had no job. No kids. No pressing obligations. You were two hours away. You could have come anytime.

But you stayed. And every day you deepened your bond with the person you claimed not to love. While I was crammed into negative space.

You could have done what I did sleep in a separate room, stay up late talking to me, visit often, let me help. But you didn‚Äôt.

You yourself said ghosting and silence are unbearable. I‚Äôve lived with that feeling every day for six months.

Let me be clear I will not spend one more second being anything less than your top priority. I am not an unplugged boyfriend appliance. That‚Äôs not love.

Or maybe you just wanted a pet boyfriend. One that didn‚Äôt ask for things.

If there‚Äôs ever going to be a future, it starts with you admitting your limits. Trusting someone else to lead when you can‚Äôt. And taking responsibility for what you put me through.

And then maybe, just maybe, we finish this summer like two reckless teenagers. Legendary sex. Road trips. Skinny dipping. Not that we‚Äôd ever do such a thing.

I already ran away. It‚Äôs your turn to stop looking through the window at me starving across the street and meet me at the old abandoned library.

In portuguese, adjectives arent neutral, they finish with ""o""(masculine) or ""a""(feminine).
I think in adjectives you use or the neutral ones or the thing gender
Words in portuguese have ""gender"" because we dont have it, so in the coffee case, we would use ""o"" because in portuguese we say ""o caf√©"" (the coffee). But for feminine words, like flower, we use ""a"". A flor (the flower)

I was browsing through the front table of new releases when I came upon this strange book filled with philosophical, comedic, metaphysical, and practical little quips. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was really worth my buying it so I walked around a bit before sitting down and reading some of it. 

It was bizarre in its prose that swung wildly from delightfully existential to the literal ‚ÄúI like two creamers in my coffee‚Äù. While looking for a chapter guide (which didn‚Äôt exist) I saw a hand scrolled message inside the front cover saying something to the effect of ‚Äúfree to a good home. Something to think about. Share me with your friends.‚Äù I also noticed there was no printed price to be found anywhere on the book?

When checking out, I asked the woman if the offer of a free book was legitimate as I wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted to buy it. After radioing for her manager to help to see if this was a local author that is perhaps doing some sort of event, the manager quickly appeared with a somewhat stern look to her. She looked me in the eye and asked where I got it in the store and if there were others(?!). I told her where I found it and that there was one other that had disappeared when I went back to see if it too, had writing inside. She then grabbed the book from the teller and walked purposefully away to where I told her I found the book. 

The teller looked at me, and I her, and didn‚Äôt know what to say. The book‚Äôs name was Posthumous Now by Mark Cook. To break the tension, I uttered that it was my birthday so maybe there‚Äôs a little magic going on around me. She laughed and I paid for my other treasures.

I paid for new pots, paid for the soil with fertiliser, and paid for the repotting service. Then at check out, there's the question-- do you want to tip? The woman was very friendly, and we chatted about our plants. But there was a sudden change in demeanour when I decided to ""only"" tip $1 on an overall bill of $60. (I don't understand why a percentage tip was even expected-- I feel like I'm being penalised for choosing a more expensive pot and spending more money at your business?)

I've worked in various retail shops for years, on my feet, breaking down giant pallets and cleaning and working the till. Never received a tip, never expected one. I worked front desk at a hotel, never expected a tip but constantly saw the bellmen and valet fight over tips and complain when guests didn't tip. I don't know why they were blaming the guests (especially non-Americans) for not paying their wages. Why don't you instead direct your blame the management who pay you $9/hr telling you to rely on tips? Front desk made $17/hr, no tips, they can afford to pay you the same.

Why is it that EVERY establishment in our lives now has to include this shitty practice? 

Repot plants? Tip. 
Get a haircut/manicure/eyebrows done? Tip. 
Eat at a restaurant? Tip. 
Taxi/Uber/Lyft ride? Tip. 
Get a massage? Tip. 
Need help carrying luggage? Tip. 
Get groceries delivered even though you pay a membership fee for the service? Tip. 
Pop-up shop or farmer's market? Tip.
Housekeeping service? Tip. 
Coffee shop? Tip.
Get a croissant from a bakery? Tip.
Local florist makes your bouquet? Tip.
Counter service when I haven't even gotten my food yet? Tip.
Pizza delivery for which I've already paid a delivery charge? Tip.
""All-inclusive"" resort? Tip tip tippity tip tip tip

Yes, I understand you can choose to tip zero, but as many posts here have highlighted, you can expect service to be subpar or even sabotaged if you don't tip. Some places pre-select a 20 % tip as the default, and you have to go out of your way to tip zero. I don't know why business owners expect tips--you set your own prices, and luring people in with low prices only to turn around and beg for tips is deceptive. I have friends who shame me for not tipping or tipping too little. It's so dysfunctional to see people defending this practice like it's a kind of virtue signal to be a defender of tips!

Why don't we see the same people being shamed for not donating to charity? I've never seen them hesitate to hit ""no"" when the screen asks them to round up 43 cents to donate to cancer research or hurricane relief and never shame them for choosing no.

I'm talking about the clothing you can buy for less than a coffee. Its amazing for our wallets, sure, but the supply chains must involve some heavy compromises.

Specifically,I'm wondering about worker exploitation.Maintaining incredibly low prices almost certainly pressures manufacturers too cut costs somewhere, and regrettably, that often translates to low wages, unsafe working conditions, and long hours for garment workers.Are there any certifications or labels we can actually trust to ensure fair labor practices, or is it all just greenwashing?

Beyond labor, the environmental impact also worries me. The sheer volume of clothing produced and quickly discarded is contributing to massive textile waste, and the dyes and processes used can pollute water sources.

The day would begin for Weasel, Stinky and Donk at first light as I, Stinky, had a very regular gastrointestinal schedule. Since I had woken everyone up anyway we‚Äôd all pack up and start hiking. No coffee, no yoga, no Good Morning Starshine , let‚Äôs just get some miles in.

After 3 to 8 miles, hopefully near water, we‚Äôd stop for breakfast. For 180 days my breakfast was dried cereal, powdered milk and local water. Huckleberry or blackberry sometimes added a soup√ßon of vitamin C to the Cheerios.

A break usually included reading ahead in the 1981 Jeff Schaefer PCT guidebook for upcoming water, river crossing s or recommended side trails. We always took his advice. Mount Whitney, Crater Lake, steampots in Lassen Park, were all inexplicably not on the actual PCT.

Lots of miles in late morning with a break every 2-5 miles to dry feet. At what we guessed was lunchtime it was big break time. We‚Äôd dry our sleeping bags in the sun , read (paper things called books), and listen to Donks Tales of the City ( he had taken a year off podiatry school in San Francisco to do the hike). If we‚Äôd gotten 15 miles in we‚Äôd read ahead for a good campsite in another 6 to 10 miles.

FYI , on a typical day we‚Äôd see anywhere from zero to 3 other thru hikers.

1mlatgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/1mlatgd/open_house_the_warmth_of_school_at_night/,Open House: The Warmth of School at Night,"Felt like sharing this memory. It‚Äôs from about 15 years ago, maybe more at this point. Just one of those quiet nights that stuck with me. With back to school and the fall season approaching, it was a memory I was thinking about quite a bit recently. I hope it evokes the same feelings from you that it did from me as I wrote it and relived it.

_________________________________________________

There was something about fall in the country. The way the air cooled and sharpened. The way the clouds turned slow and heavy, gray like flannel. They grew denser, softer. The vivid sunsets. I remember the crisp air and the smell of the leaves. I remember how the sky changed, one moment golden, the next already dark, and how the buildings at school glowed differently at night.

I‚Äôd often find myself at school after hours, thanks to sports and practice, but Open House was different, something special. Unlike the usual hustle and bustle of games and drills, Open House brought a calm warmth that filled the halls and made the school feel like a second home in a way no other night did.

Open House was one of my favorite nights of the year. Most kids didn‚Äôt go, just their parents, but I always tagged along. I wanted to. I loved being in my school at night. The halls were quiet, but not exactly empty. They were full of a warm energy. Teachers smiling, parents asking questions, the faint smell of cookies, brownies, and coffee from the refreshment table. You could hear the echo of laughter and voices through the wings.

The best part for me was always the woodshop. The place I spent countless hours in, the place where I built things. My home away from home. I couldn‚Äôt wait to make my way there with my parents. I couldn‚Äôt wait to see Mr. Pompeii. During the first month and a half of the school year, we had been working on two new dugouts for the ball fields. Building Design and Construction was the official name of the class. It was a big project. Real work. I was one of the few students Mr. Pompeii trusted to help build them.

After visiting with a few of my teachers on the upper floor, I eventually moseyed my way down to the woodshop with my parents in tow. After we got settled, Mr. Pompeii and the other shop teacher immediately began speaking about me with such genuine pride and kindness. Right there in front of my parents. Their words were full of encouragement and praise. There is no better feeling than hearing that kind of praise directed towards you from people you truly respect, admire, and look up to. Especially in that moment, knowing they were sharing these things with my parents made me feel like a million bucks. It was one of those rare moments where you feel completely seen and valued. I felt like I was on top of the world.

Sitting with them around the large wooden workbench in the shop, just us and my parents, maybe the parents of one other kid, was something I‚Äôll never forget. It was quiet. The air smelled like sawdust. It was so cozy with the nighttime sky visible through the windows, with the hum of equipment in the background. Being there with them felt safe and steady. I felt like I belonged. I didn‚Äôt want to ever leave.

Mr. Pompeii was a seasoned shop teacher, in his early sixties by the time I got to know him. This year, my freshman year, would mark my third year in the shop. He was funny, smart, sharp, encouraging, and deeply knowledgeable. The other shop teacher would always say that Mr. Pompeii forgot more than he would ever know. That saying always stuck with me.

Mr. Pompeii didn‚Äôt just teach, he built alongside us, and we learned through hands on experience. Like with the dugouts. I remember helping him mix the concrete in the wheelbarrow for the wall anchor bolts. We hauled the bags, poured the water, and mixed the wet concrete until our arms burned. Then we set the anchor bolts. A couple days later, we got to work framing with hammers and nails. A couple weeks later came the siding. Once that was finished, we built the scaffolding and got to work on the roof. I was afraid of being up there initially, but Mr. Pompeii made me feel completely safe as we began laying shingles. Lastly came the fascia. He was so impressed with my attention to detail. The whole thing came together piece by piece. After a month and a half, the first dugout was mostly complete. Mr. Pompeii was proud of me the entire way through. He made sure I knew it. I already couldn‚Äôt wait to get started on the next one in the spring. That project was just one of the many things we built together through my school career.

After we all sat around the workbench and talked for a long while, Mr. Pompeii encouraged me to take my mom out to the ball fields and show her what we had built. So I did. We walked through the cooling air. The sky was getting darker. I showed her the nearly completed dugout. The walls, the roof, the fascia, the clean cuts, the clean lines, and of course, the anchor bolts set deep and true. She was proud. I could feel it. When we came back into the shop afterward, Mr. Pompeii was glowing. He looked so genuinely happy that I had brought her to see it. That look on his face meant the world to me.

After leaving the shop, we made our way through the rest of the secondary school, room by room, teacher by teacher. All my teachers spoke highly of me. We moved through the building like it was a second home.

Eventually, after meeting with all my teachers, we reached the elementary wing. The one I had walked through years earlier as a little kid. That was where my little brother was now. He never came to these Open House nights. Just me and my parents. We met with his teachers, some I knew, others I didn‚Äôt. The rooms were as I remembered them. The smart boards still glowed, casting soft light across the gray carpeting. The wall clocks ticked gently in the background. Desks were pushed neatly in the corners or arranged in clusters. Books lined the shelves in quiet rows. Student artwork was pinned to the bulletin boards. Paper leaves, poems, pumpkins, you name it. Everything felt calm and still. You could feel the warmth of the day lingering in those rooms, even though it was nighttime by now. The floors were just slightly warm from the heaters kicking on. The windows showed the night sky outside, deep and dark by this point. Cool and crisp air blew against the glass, but inside it was safe and warm. The rooms smelled like crayons and construction paper. It was comforting to be back there. Everything felt smaller, more personal. Familiar in a way only foundational places can be. Again, I didn‚Äôt want to leave.

When the night ended, we drove home in our Ford Econoline. I sat in the back with a brownie from the refreshments table and a cup of hot chocolate. The windows were cold to the touch. My parents talked quietly up front. I felt safe. Seen. Settled. Tomorrow we‚Äôd be putting up my 12-foot Frankenstein inflatable, along with some other Halloween decorations.

This was over 15 years ago. I‚Äôd give anything to do it all again. Not to change anything. Just to be there. Just to feel it. Just to experience and enjoy it again.

Still, I remember.

At the time we weren‚Äôt rlly friends in fact I kind of hated him I don‚Äôt know the real reason but I did always find his voice annoying (Jake was born in Louisville and had a thick accent) so I tried rlly hard to avoid him. Over time I kinda forgot he existed until one day we had ran into each other at the grocery store, I had spotted his dad first and gave him a wave when i realized that the tall (kinda cute) guy standing next to him was Jake. 

Jake waved at me with a confused expression on his face I wasn‚Äôt surprised tho cs we have haven‚Äôt seen each other in yearss, I walked over and said hi (not rlly remembering who Jake wasüòÖ) he smiled and said ‚ÄúWow! I haven‚Äôt seen you in forever, you look good. How are you?‚Äù Looking confused I said ‚Äúaww thank you! I‚Äôm great. you look great as well how have you been?‚Äù Blah blah blah we talked for about 5 minutes then I left, after walking away I had asked my mom who Jake was cs I had remembered his name but not his face. 

When she told me that he was Jake from karate I STOPPED in my tracks looked my mom dead in her face and said‚Ä¶.‚ÄùThe one with the annoying southern accent!?!‚Äù yea great reaction right üò≠. I started remembering us back in karate and thought to myself ‚ÄúFuck it. He looks good and seems like he‚Äôs changed a lot, I might go get his number‚Äù, so I did. I went back and asked him for his number to catch up a bit, he agreed then we started talking. Fast forward to a week later we were getting along great, talking a lot until I had an accident at work. 

I had gotten caffeine poisoning and ended up in the hospital Context: I work at a coffee shop that‚Äôs painted black on the inside and out, it‚Äôs summer and that day it got to 93¬∞ outside which made it way hotter inside. We have fans but they are rlly old and don‚Äôt work very well, I also work the morning shift (5am-11am the busiest time of the day) so as usual when I came in I made myself a 24oz iced coffee to cool off and wake up a little. Little did I know that wasn‚Äôt the only coffee I would have that day, our main barista was going to move and she had asked me to help her make a special menu for her leaving day. Yall‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not kidding when I tell you this was the most coffee I had in my life. 

When I got home I had taken a nap then when I woke up i couldn‚Äôt feel my legs like they were rlly tingly and felt numb. I had went to my mom to inform her what was happening and she said to just rub ice on my legs then take sum pain meds so I did, The next thing I know I‚Äôm waking up in an ambulance with very little memory of what happened. I was in the hospital for about a week but I was so drugged up and dehydrated I lost more of my memory, I thought I would be stuck like that forever but then I got a text one day from Jake. 

I checked my phone and saw he was texting me the whole time I was in the hospital and my sister had arranged a day for him to come by to say hi. The day he came Jake had brought Lego flowers (my favourite thing in the world) for us to build to take my mind off the chaos, unfortunately I was too drowsy from the meds the doctors gave me so he built them for me ü•π. Some more fast forwarding after I had gotten out of the hospital Jake and I went on a few dates then started dating, it had been so great since then‚Ä¶.until today. 

I have sum mental health struggles and the night before my depression got rlly bad to the point i ended up relapsing and i was absolutely terrified to tell Jake this cs I didn‚Äôt know how he would handle this situation but the bigger problem is that I didn‚Äôt want to keep secrets from him. So i debated on telling him until l finally did, that‚Äôs when he told me that everyone has demons in their closet and that I shouldn‚Äôt worry about him reacting weird cs he will be there for me. 

THIS is where everything started after our heartwarming conversation he brought up that he had sum secrets of his own, Jake had told me he was into polygamy‚Ä¶.

For those who don‚Äôt know polygamy is where a man ( most of the time a man who is Mormon) is married to 2 or more different women. I hope that kinda helps idk much about it cs i have never rlly seen or heard much about it. 

When Jake told me this i didn‚Äôt know what to think so ofc i did a normal reaction any girl would do to crazy new‚Ä¶.I IMMEDIATELY called my best friend. I won‚Äôt get into how our conversation went too much, pretty much she just told me to ask him if he currently was into anyone else and so I did. That‚Äôs when I found out sum worse‚Ä¶he was still into his ex, THE SAME EX WHO MENTALLY ABUSED HIM BTW! 

After Jake told me that I had no idea what to do I was literally speechless so I thought to bring it here to reddit and see if you guys had any advice on what to do. I rlly love him and feel like we connect so much especially on an emotional level but my beliefs are just so different and In my eyes that‚Äôs cheating. 

I want to see if there is a way to maybe ‚Äúpull him out of it?‚Äù Or in better terms see if we could compromise to where it‚Äôs just us in the relationship but my biggest concern on that is what if he then cheats. 

Ughhh idk this is all so abrupt and confusing please please please help If anyone can I would really appreciate it ü•≤

A long oak table stretched from one end of the bunker to the other, littered with maps, compasses, and half-empty cups of bitter black coffee. By all accounts, the German high command was not eager to listen to this debriefing.

At the head of the table sat General Oberst von Hammersmark ‚Äî a man whose moustache seemed perpetually on the brink of desertion from his upper lip. He had a thick file folder in front of him, stamped ***GEHEIM*** in bold red letters. He tapped it ominously with a pencil.

‚ÄúGentlemen,‚Äù he began, in a tone as warm and inviting as a tax audit from the Reichsfinanzamt. ‚ÄúWe are here to discuss Operation Sonnenhut ‚Äî our ‚Äòbrilliant‚Äô plan to sweep into Spain, secure the ports, and establish supply lines for our Mediterranean forces.‚Äù

The officers shifted nervously. One fiddled with his cap; another found the ceiling very interesting.

Von Hammersmark snapped the folder open.
‚ÄúOur intelligence told us it would be a swift and bloodless victory. We were told the Spanish defenses were minimal. And yet‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äî he slapped down a grainy reconnaissance photo ‚Äî ‚Äúthis is what happened to our 5th Panzer Division.‚Äù

The picture showed tanks immobilized in a narrow street, surrounded by upturned orange carts, furious townsfolk wielding broom handles, and what appeared to be an extremely aggressive goat perched on the turret of a Panzer.

‚ÄúWe lost three divisions in a single day,‚Äù von Hammersmark thundered. ‚ÄúSupplies gone. Morale shattered. And all because we underestimated their response. Tell me‚Äî‚Äù his voice dropped to a growl ‚Äú‚Äî how could you not have anticipated Spain‚Äôs retaliation?‚Äù

A long silence followed. Somewhere in the distance, the ventilation hummed. 

At the far end of the table, a young lieutenant shifted in his seat and cleared his throat.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ sir‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the problem, sir,‚Äù He swallowed. ‚ÄúNobody‚Ä¶ nobody expected the Spanish imposition.‚Äù",2,1754696452.0,Jokes,2,0.6,False

The INSANE World of 'Get Paid to Click Captchas' ‚Äî Is This the Strangest AI Side Hustle Ever?,"Hold up‚Äîhave you all seen these ‚ÄúGet Paid to Click Captchas‚Äù ads everywhere lately? I can't tell if I'm living in the Matrix or if this is just the wildest job market shift since that TikTok AI trend!

I literally clicked on a link out of curiosity and fell into a **rabbit hole**‚Äîand trust me, I‚Äôm BRIMMING with questions and *so much* confusion right now. I mean, how are we here, talking about earning REAL money by pressing buttons and clicking those ‚ÄúSelect all cars‚Äù puzzles?! ü§®üö¶

Let‚Äôs break down what‚Äôs going on with these App Testing Gateways because my mind is actually in three pieces after this research. And YES, I‚Äôll drop the infamous link if you‚Äôre as nosey as me: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**

Here‚Äôs what floored me:

- You click on a gateway ad.
- They send you to a platform like **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**
- Your ‚Äútask‚Äù? Solving captchas or tapping the sneaky ‚Äúverify‚Äù boxes (what is this, a game show?).
- In return, they promise micro-payments in your wallet every time you ‚Äúcomplete a task.‚Äù

Wild, right? But hold on‚ÄîI‚Äôm not just buying into it. üòµ‚Äçüí´

I kept seeing **GET PAID INSTANTLY!** and ‚ÄúJust Test a Few Apps‚ÄîEarn Now!‚Äù So, I dived deeper (because, hi, FOMO). Here‚Äôs what I pieced together, and‚Äîseriously‚Äîprepare for whiplash:

- Most of these sites, like **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**, ACTUALLY pay out‚Äîbut it‚Äôs MICRO cents per click, not $$$ like they tease in flashy banners.
- The ‚Äútesting‚Äù bit isn't always about finding bugs or playing around. Sometimes it‚Äôs just making sure automated bots *don‚Äôt* get through.
- Occasionally, you have to TEST MULTIPLE APPS or complete a chain of captchas before seeing any money (think‚Ä¶ those puzzle games that tell you ‚Äújust one more level!‚Äù)
- Some require referrals‚Äîif you‚Äôre not inviting friends, your progress is snail-level slow.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs TRULY mind-bending:

- People ARE making a little cash, but not ‚Äúquit your job‚Äù type cash‚Äîmore like ‚Äúbuy a coffee once a week‚Äù if you‚Äôre grinding daily. ‚òï
- The ‚Äúminimum withdrawal‚Äù can take AGES to reach on some gateway sites
- You need to read all the T&Cs at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** because sneaky fees or crypto pay-outs sometimes come into play

I can't decide if I‚Äôm SHOCKED (that people make *anything* this way!) or just CONFUSED that companies need us for this. Like, somewhere, an AI is crying because humans are still beating it at Captcha. üòÖ

What do you all think about these App Testing Gateways? Is anyone out there actually collecting a decent payout, or is this the ultimate digital side hustle myth? 

If you want to go down the captcha rabbit hole and judge for yourself, here‚Äôs the gateway everyone talks about: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**

Anyone else spent hours on these weird ‚Äútasks‚Äù and lived to tell the tale?! SPILL. I‚Äôm ready for some first-hand SHOCK or HYPE. 

And, by the way‚Äîfor science, one more time: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (because apparently, the Internet never stops testing us üòÇ).

1mlai5a,https://i.redd.it/y17b9xjcnvhf1.png,What's the plan with Claudio Cassano? (Heading back to Italy?),"I've caught moments from Cassano, looks promising.

He's thriving in MLS NEXT‚Äîbut apparently angry he's at that level? (At least according to something I read on this sub, that he moved here fully expecting to play on the first team.)

And interestingly, when I searched around, I found a local Italian news report from June that said he's leaving the Fire on to join US Avellino (Serie B) this summer. [Here's the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKEby6ieH00) and translation below.

Anyone have more of the story? Seems like he's earned a cup of coffee on the first team, or at least a loan to USL Championship? Curious how he'd perform at a higher level.

  
\##



>Claudio Cassano is very close to joining US Avellino. The 2003-born playmaker grew up in Roma‚Äôs youth academy and recently played overseas with Chicago Fire in the MLS Next Pro. He‚Äôs now on the verge of moving to Irpinia. The deal has been in the works for a while, with sporting director Mario Iello quietly negotiating it. Everything suggests it will soon be finalized as a loan with an option to buy.

>Cassano has already agreed to the transfer, and he‚Äôs seen as a strategic addition to the ‚Äúbiancoverdi‚Äù squad, especially for the under-players quota in attack. Club president D‚ÄôAgostino has targeted him to strengthen the attacking midfield, choosing a versatile technical profile with decent experience despite his young age. Standing 1.65 m tall, Cassano has shown quality both in Italy and in the United States.

>In the first part of the 2024‚Äì2025 season, he made nine appearances with Cittadella, scoring once. Then he moved to the U.S., where he found more consistent playing time, scoring three goals in 10 matches for the American side, totaling over 800 minutes. Returning to Italian football could be a turning point in his career, with the Roma-trained talent aiming to re-enter the Italy Under-21 national team setup. Avellino, for its part, would secure a high-potential player with plenty of room to grow.

i never told her we were still together at the time. and i never told him i knew. something in me decided that giving him the chance to explain or lie would only make me feel worse. so i stayed silent.

he texted a few times after the breakup. little things like asking if i had watched some show yet or sending a song we used to listen to. i answered politely at first then less and less until it stopped.

he probably still thinks we ended on neutral ground. maybe he thinks i just moved on easily. the truth is i just did not want to give him the satisfaction of knowing he had hurt me.

It's very cool that this place exists, I didn't realize this band still had an audience after all this time.

I'm a musician based in Dublin, Ireland. I became a huge fan of Midori back in 2023, definitely one of those bands who really made me feel excited about music again. It's funny since I've listened to their whole discography so much by now and know all the songs to hear but I couldn't name pretty much any of them as I don't speak Japanese and the streaming service I use doesn't include English titles haha.

  
Anyway, I thought I'd share two piano covers I did from the Shimizu EP back in 2023! I only ever posted these on Instagram so the website might nag you to log in if you're on a computer. I painstakingly figured this tune out by ear by slowing down the songs to a snail pace and then approximating sounds from there and making some small handwritten notes (I seem to have stained this sheet with a coffee mug at some point but I have included this below for anyone interested in learning it lol). The mix itself is so chaotic that it's really tough to hear everything clearly, for that reason alone it was definitely the hardest thing I've ever learnt by ear. It took me weeks to get the hang of all the different parts. Absolutely nuts stuff. Such a cool band though, I don't know how anyone could write something like this and still have it sound coherent... but somehow they do!!

The year 2025 brings forth a plethora of new options, each vying for the title of the best dairy-free creamer.

## Key Features Analysis

The landscape of dairy-free creamers is rapidly evolving,with manufacturers constantly innovating to improve taste,texture,and nutritional profiles.To discern the best options, a thorough analysis of key features is crucial.

**Base Ingredients:** The foundation of any dairy-free creamer lies in its base ingredients. Common options include almond milk,oat milk,coconut milk,soy milk,cashew milk,and blends thereof. Each base imparts a distinct flavor and creaminess. For example, oat milk tends to offer a naturally sweet and creamy texture, while coconut milk provides a richer, more tropical flavor. The ideal base depends on individual taste preferences and dietary needs.

**Added Sugars & Sweeteners:** Many dairy-free creamers contain added sugars or artificial sweeteners to enhance palatability. Though, excessive sugar consumption can be detrimental to health. Look for creamers that utilize natural sweeteners like stevia, monk fruit, or erythritol, or opt for unsweetened varieties to control your sugar intake. Carefully examine the nutrition label to assess the sugar content and make informed choices.

**Fat Content & Type:** Fat contributes significantly to the creaminess and mouthfeel of a creamer. Dairy-free creamers typically derive their fat content from plant-based oils such as sunflower oil, coconut oil, or avocado oil. Saturated fats, often found in coconut oil, should be consumed in moderation. Look for creamers with a balanced fat profile, prioritizing those with a higher proportion of unsaturated fats, considered healthier options.

**Additives & Stabilizers:** to achieve a smooth and consistent texture, many dairy-free creamers contain additives like gums (e.g., guar gum, xanthan gum), emulsifiers, and stabilizers. While generally considered safe, some individuals may experience digestive issues from certain additives. Opt for creamers with minimal additives or those that use natural alternatives, if sensitivity is a concern.

**Flavor Varieties:** Dairy-free creamers are available in an array of flavors, ranging from classic vanilla and hazelnut to more adventurous options like salted caramel and pumpkin spice. The availability of diverse flavors allows consumers to customize their coffee or tea experience and cater to seasonal preferences. Be mindful of artificial flavorings and prioritize those derived from natural sources.

**Certifications & Labels:** Look for certifications such as ""Certified Vegan,"" ""Non-GMO Project Verified,"" or ""Certified Gluten-Free"" to ensure the creamer meets specific standards.Thes labels provide assurance regarding the product's origin, ingredients, and production processes, allowing consumers to make ethical and informed choices.

Key features of high-performing dairy-free creamers include:

*   low added sugar content.
*   Utilization of healthy fat sources like avocado oil.
*   Minimal use of artificial additives.
*   Wide availability of flavor options.

## Core Benefits

Dairy-free creamers offer a multitude of benefits, extending beyond simply catering to dietary restrictions. They provide unique advantages for health-conscious consumers and those seeking to diversify their flavor profiles.

**Improved Digestive Health:** For individuals with lactose intolerance or dairy sensitivities, switching to dairy-free creamers can significantly improve digestive health. Eliminating lactose, the sugar found in dairy, can alleviate symptoms such as bloating, gas, and abdominal discomfort, leading to a more agreeable and enjoyable coffee-drinking experience. Users report feeling lighter and more energetic after replacing dairy creamers with plant-based alternatives, which translates to improved overall well-being in daily life.**Reduced Cholesterol Intake:** Dairy products are known to contain cholesterol,which can contribute to heart disease when consumed in excess. Dairy-free creamers,derived from plant-based sources,are inherently cholesterol-free,offering a healthier alternative for maintaining cardiovascular health. This means users can enjoy their favorite beverages without the worry of increasing their cholesterol levels, promoting long-term heart health.**Diverse Flavor Profiles:** Dairy-free creamers open up a world of flavor possibilities beyond traditional dairy-based options. From the subtle sweetness of oat milk to the nutty notes of almond milk, each base ingredient imparts a unique flavor profile that can enhance the taste of coffee or tea. This offers a delightful opportunity for consumers to experiment and discover new flavor combinations, enriching their daily beverage ritual.

**Vegan & Cruelty-Free Option:** For those adhering to a vegan lifestyle or concerned about animal welfare, dairy-free creamers provide a guilt-free alternative to traditional dairy products. Choosing plant-based options supports ethical and enduring food choices, aligning with values of compassion and environmental obligation. This empowers users to enjoy their daily coffee knowing that they are contributing to a more humane and sustainable food system.

## FAQs Section

**are dairy-free creamers suitable for baking and cooking?**
Yes, many dairy-free creamers can be used in baking and cooking as a substitute for dairy cream or milk. Though, the consistency and flavor may vary depending on the base ingredient. Opt for thicker creamers like coconut cream or cashew cream for richer recipes, and always adjust the amount of liquid accordingly.

**How long do dairy-free creamers typically last after opening?**
Most dairy-free creamers have a similar shelf life to dairy milk after opening, generally about 7-10 days when stored properly in the refrigerator. Always check the expiration date and look for any signs of spoilage, such as changes in colour, smell, or texture.

**Do dairy-free creamers contain significant amounts of vitamins and minerals?**
The nutritional content of dairy-free creamers can vary depending on the brand and type. Some are fortified with vitamins like vitamin D and vitamin B12,as well as minerals like calcium,to mimic the nutritional profile of dairy milk. Check the nutrition label to determine the specific vitamin and mineral content of the creamer you choose.

**Are there any dairy-free creamers specifically designed for frothing?**
Yes, some dairy-free creamers are formulated to create a stable and long-lasting foam, making them ideal for lattes, cappuccinos, and other specialty coffee drinks. These typically contain stabilizers and added gums to enhance their frothing ability. Look for creamers that are specifically labeled as ""barista blend"" or ""frothing creamer.""

You‚Äôve poured hours into coding it, testing it, refining it until it‚Äôs something you‚Äôd happily introduce to your own mother.

You click ‚Äúpublish‚Äù in the Shopify App Store. You wait.

And wait.

But the merchants? They‚Äôre not stampeding toward your install button. They‚Äôre busy running their businesses, managing inventory, handling customers, maybe even Googling ‚Äúhow to get coffee stains out of a hoodie.‚Äù

The Shopify App Store is crowded. Your app is a brilliant whisper in a stadium of noise.

So how do you get noticed?

Not with expensive ads. Not by starting a blog that will take months to build traffic. You start by showing up where your potential users already are, with something they actually care about.

Here are three ways to do just that.



# 1. Cold Email the Right Merchants

Cold email can be a beautiful thing when it‚Äôs done thoughtfully. The key is targeting merchants who already understand the problem you solve.

If a store is already using a competitor‚Äôs app, you‚Äôre not introducing a brand-new concept. You‚Äôre simply offering a better option.

Here is how:

Go to [StoreCensus.com](http://StoreCensus.com) and search for merchants using your competitor‚Äôs app.

Export their contact details.

Send a short, personal email that shows you understand their situation and how you can help.

**Example script:**

>Subject: Quick question about your \[feature they care about\]

>Hey \[First Name\],

>I noticed you use \[Competitor App\] for \[function, e.g. order tracking\]. Have you run into \[specific problem\]?

>I built \[Your App Name\], which \[main benefit\], and it could save you \[time/money/etc.\].

>Here‚Äôs a one-minute demo: \[link\].

>Would you like me to set you up with a free 14-day trial? No strings attached.

>Best,

>\[Your Name\]

tip: Clean up your list with emailable and use a platform like email chaser, instantly, apollo to send out emails.

Start small. Fifty relevant, well-written emails a day is plenty. This is about quality, not carpet bombing inboxes.



# 2. Borrow Trust Through Reviews

Merchants believe other merchants. Especially when they read reviews in the App Store.

You can borrow that trust by leaving thoughtful reviews for apps that complement yours. Not competitors, but tools that can work alongside what you offer.

If you built a tracking app, look for upsell or delivery scheduling apps. Install one. Use it. Then write a specific, genuine review mentioning your app naturally.

**Example review:**

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been using \[App You‚Äôre Reviewing\] for three months, and it‚Äôs been great for \[specific result\]. We also run \[Your App Name\] alongside it, and the combination has cut our support tickets in half.‚Äù

Keep it human. Keep it unique. A few reviews a week are enough to plant seeds in the minds of merchants already shopping for apps.



# 3. Get Featured on App Lists

Merchants love a good ‚Äúbest of‚Äù list. They trust them because someone else has done the vetting.

You can get yourself on those lists if you know where to look.

Start by browsing the StoreCensus App Directory to find lists like Best Order Tracking Apps. These lists already attract the exact people you want to reach.

Reach out to the curator with Backlink + article trade in exchange for listing you, or you could just ask they might just add you out of the goodness of their heart.

If they update their list regularly, they might add you. And if a paid sponsorship is available and affordable, it can be worth it.

For extra impact, ask if they can embed your retargeting pixel in the link to your app. That way you can run inexpensive ads to readers who have already shown interest.



# Pulling It All Together

1. Cold emailing the right merchants.
2. Borrowing trust through reviews.
3. Getting featured on app lists.

Individually, each tactic can move the needle. Together, they can get you to your first 100 installs faster than waiting for the App Store to ‚Äúdiscover‚Äù you.

And here‚Äôs the bonus: when you show up in these places with genuine value, you‚Äôre not just chasing installs. You‚Äôre building relationships. Those relationships turn into word-of-mouth. And word-of-mouth turns into the installs you didn‚Äôt even have to ask for.

Because in the end, the first 50 installs aren‚Äôt the hardest part. The hardest part is deciding to get out there and earn them.

1mla0be,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1mla0be/ongoing_stomach_problems_for_almost_3_years/,Ongoing stomach problems for almost 3 years,"Hii this is my first time posting on Reddit so I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm doing this right, forgive me if I‚Äôm not!! But I‚Äôm a 17 year old girl who has been dealing with debilitating stomach problems for about 3 years now. They started in March of 2023 and are still going strong. I‚Äôve struggled with stomach problems since I was little, but nothing like this. What I was struggling with before was just occasional nervous diarrhea/ constipation and feeling nauseas, typical IBS stuff. In March of 2023 that all changed. I had gone to bed one night and woke up constipated, didn‚Äôt think much of it as it had happened to me before and usually an iced coffee would do the trick and clean me out and I‚Äôd be better again. This time, when I went to drink my coffee, it didn‚Äôt clean me out. Instead, it made me feel incredibly sick like I was going to pass out. I felt like it gave me diarrhea, but I couldn‚Äôt get the diarrhea out of me. I went to the bathroom a few times that day, but each time only a little bit would come out and I didn‚Äôt feel satisfied at all. This continued on for about a week until a nurse friend of my mom‚Äôs recommended doing a miralax clean out. I took the miralax, shat out an entire ecosystem, and thought that would be the end of it. Spoiler alert I was wrong!! After that day, it went right back to the same cycle of feeling sick because I couldn‚Äôt evacuate myself fully. I began to feel super bloated, and even laxatives began not working. I went to a gastroenterologist to try and figure out what was wrong (summer of 2023 at this point) and she just told me to take laxitives every day and see a counselor. She also told me to do a SITZ test(I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called) where I swallowed some rubber bands and they did x rays to track how it moved through my system to see if I had slow motility. Everything came back normal as I was taking 4 senna tablets and one dose of miralax per day. It helped in some sense, for the most part I was feeling ‚Äúbetter‚Äù because I was having crazy diarrhea and I felt less full, but even then, The diarrhea felt ‚Äústuck‚Äù inside of me. I was (and still am)  spending an hour on the toilet waiting for it to fall out of me because when I pushed nothing would happen. Eventually the gastroenterologist ended up retiring and wound up with some pretty bad reviews online, so I switched to another gastro. This was now November of 2023, this gastro assigned me to do a stool sample , which came back normal , and do an anorectal manometry. The anorectal manometry  results said that I wasn‚Äôt using the right muscles to push. Oh I forgot to mention that the doctor also put me on linzess which I was taking at the time, I started out on the lowest dose which I believe is 55 mg and I‚Äôm now taking 105 mg. It‚Äôs helping because it‚Äôs a stool softener so it makes it easier to fall out, but I‚Äôm still having the issue when I push nothing happens, it‚Äôs not addressing the root cause. By then the doctors were all telling me that it was just IBS and the thing I could do was just a diet change. But no matter what I ate I still felt the same, didn‚Äôt matter if it was a bag of chips with some kfc or a super balanced meal with salad and protein and fiber. I also do consider myself to have a pretty good diet already, I try to limit my junk food and I eat a lot of vegetables and keep up with my fiber intake. One doctor suggested pelvic floor therapy would help, so I was doing that for about 5 months and didn‚Äôt feel any improvement whatsoever. Then also did biofeedback that I just finished today. I did 6 sessions coupled with some pelvic floor therapy and still no results. The pelvic floor therapist said it could be a motility problem but I‚Äôm not sure. The biofeedback machine I also saw isn‚Äôt always super accurate so I really don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôm also leaving for my freshman year of college in 2 weeks, and I‚Äôm worried about how this will affect me while I‚Äôm away from home and from my doctors. I know this was super lengthy and might not make a lot of sense but really any help or advice is appreciated. I might edit it and try to clean it up so it makes more chronological sense. I‚Äôm just really tired of dealing with this it‚Äôs been almost 3 years now and I‚Äôm in so much pain and discomfort. Thank you guysü•π",1,1754694622.0,DiagnoseMe,0,1.0,False
1ml9zty,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ml9zty/m20_how_do_you_stay_positive_in_dating_after/,M/20 How do you stay positive in dating after experiencing broken trust and toxicity?,"So for a little context, Hey I‚Äôm Envy, I‚Äôm a 20 year old male, I work as a teacher and I am a full time student. I am half Sri Lankan and Japanese and I am straight.  I‚Äôm pretty shy but I have an outgoing and empathetic personality. I see the good in people and it‚Äôs hard for me to see the bad.

So this is pretty personal but I wanted to get some perspective and advice, last year when I was 19 years old I started getting out there in the dating scene I took out 2 girls both kinda just friendzoned me after the 1st date but i still tried to find someone, I started using dating apps at the time I was a very addicted to a game called Valorant and tried to make friends through it. Anyways fast forward to summer I was teaching my class of about 6 kids and I got a texted form this girl, her name was Yuni. I added her and we started talking she was really quite and cute, a light personality, she was way better than me at the game and that‚Äôs how we bonded, I‚Äôd face time her and show her how I teach and what my placed looked like cause she lived in china at the time.

After 2 weeks of getting to know her I asked her to be my girlfriend, I told her that I loved the way she listened to me and called me cute, and how she sounded. I found out at this point she was 25 years old. I told her age really didn‚Äôt matter to me because I really liked her. She said yes and we started dating, every thing was going great.

I‚Äôd sleep call with her and I‚Äôd make sure to check up with her while I work. Even stayed on call with her during my shift and showed her how I teach my classes. I made to buy her a coffee and favorite food everyday, since it was long distance I tried to make sure i was in constant contact. But as the days went on I started to feel off, when I did something she didn‚Äôt like she would get mad which is normal and I made sure to ask for forgiveness and make sure I‚Äôd never do it again, for context she hated when I said shutup to her as a joke but I didn‚Äôt think much of it. The issue was she would say shutup, or call me a bitch for fun, and when I said I didn‚Äôt like it she said I can do what I want. This was like this for most of our relationship, when she did something it‚Äôs never wrong but when I do something wrong it‚Äôs my fault and she would just stop talking to me and go no contact.

I hated that, cause long distance relationship needs constant communication and she would never talk to me about anything, it felt as though I was trying 110% to make this work and I didn‚Äôt mind that cause I actually started to love her.

Fast forward to 4 days before our 3 month anniversary, we were playing a game and I made joke about her male friend who was in our lobby at the time, his name was Jamie and for some reason I never liked his vibe, he was a good guy but I just didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with him and my girlfriend and I told yuni this but she said I was crazy. Either way they would play together when I was at work, the thing that pissed me off was when I made a joke about his friend talking about how his aim shaky, MY GF defended him, and told me to stop, mind u Jamie was fine with me joking around cause he did the same to me but when I did it my GF got mad. I did not let this go I confronted her about it and she pulled the silent treatment, I said I wasn‚Äôt gonna sleep till we talked about it.

2 days no sleep, I‚Äôm not joking I waited for her to text, call, something, nope nothing, she‚Äôd wake up, play her games and sleep.  Not once did she try to contact me. I cried for 2 days straight, my emotions going rampant. I called her on our 3 month anniversary‚Ä¶

I asked her why did she do this, why she didn‚Äôt care for me like I did for her, I made sure I put her over my own happiness just to see her smile, I‚Äôve spent soo much money on her just so she wouldn‚Äôt have to waste her own. I even learned Chinese so I could talk to her parents and fly over to her. You know what she said, ‚ÄúYou never showed me love so why should I‚Äù that line broke me. I had enough and I told her I‚Äôm done. And I broke up with her. She thought it was a joke until she saw me delete her contact, pictures and started to block her on everything, she called me on my cellphone and said I love you, but I said where was this 10 mins ago when I was crying. I ended the call and blocked her number. I later found out she was texting other guys behind my back.

This was my first relationship and I still haven‚Äôt forgotten about it even though it‚Äôs been over a year.

To sum things up I am wondering how can u tell if someone is toxic, and is there any hope of finding love again.

I‚Äôve been rejected about 23 times by girls she was the only that said yes to me.

I don‚Äôt look for looks, I only care about personality but based on this shit show idk anymore,

Love Creepcast! Been a fan since the beginning. This isn't my first story I've written but I'm still improving. Criticisms are appreciated.

I've been exploring the forest around my county ever since I was a teenager. There's no cave, abandoned graver yard or ancient tree I haven't seen ( within a 40 mile radius of my home.) It's funny what you can find just strolling along the trails on a random weekend. My family doesn't understand, but there's a call I get, a pulling sensation whenever I'm far from the forest. It's hard to explain but I'll try: Have you ever been addicted to something? You get that urge to do it, either pull out your pack of smokes or twist open your flask. Drown the urge until it comes back tomorrow or a few hours later. Have you ever tried to quit? Hard isn't it? You realize it's a problem so you stop. You'll get a few urges, a feeling that something's missing. Maybe you'll be sad for a few days or weeks but eventually you will overcome your addiction. Congrats you're free.
  
Those urges, that feeling of missing something, that's what it's like when I'm not on a trail or making new ones. Except there's no overcoming it. It lasted till I planted my bare feet into the leaves and began trekking. ( yes i hike without shoes.) Now this might sound terrible, but that's why it's hard to explain.

My Pawpaw is the only one who understands this. Before he was placed in the nursing home we would walk the trails together. He'd show me the best spots for views and how to toughen my feet up properly. He's a tough man with a hard shell but when he's out walking that exoskeleton falls off. He's a different person. I've learned much about his life and our family history on these walks. I might be the only person he's ever opened up too.

Now he spends most of his days looking out the window of the nursing home staring at the magnolia out back. I'm the only one to visit him with any sort of frequency. 

Nursing homes smell of nothing, like they mopped and sprayed the halls with something that hunted and killed the scent of anything human. It was a good hunter. The rooms were the only thing that reminded you that people lived there. My Pawpaw was in one of these rooms, he sat by his window watching a cardinal build a nest amongst the glossy leaves of the magnolia.

‚Äú Has she finished it yet?‚Äù

‚Äú no, but she's  close. she'll be ready to lay those eggs soon.‚Äù he turned to me with a smile few have truly seen.

‚Äú Is the babydaddy still flapping around? Or has he finally kicked rocks?

‚Äú He's gone. I think he finally wised up.‚Äù

I slid my arm around him and squeezed. Despite his great strength in the past he seems weaker like this place drained him of energy. I pulled up my chair and placed the chilly cheese fries I brought with me on the windowsill. We talked about nonsense while the bird worked. After we'd finished the bowl he pulled out his phone.

‚Äú Have you found anything interesting on Big Brother?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, only the same old stuff, but I do have the coordinates for that cave now, should make it easier to find later. What about you?‚Äù

‚Äú Yeah, I found something you haven't seen yet. See this?‚Äù
He handed me his phone with google earth pulled up. It was zoomed in on a portion of trees. I scanned it, seeing nothing at first.

‚Äú the big magnolia?‚Äù

‚Äú Yes son, but look around it‚Ä¶ Here‚Äù 
Beside the massive tree was a roof top barely visible under the smaller oaks surrounding the magnolia. It was hard to make out details but I could tell it was a roof by its angle.

‚Äú Huh, never seen a house that far in the mountains. How old do you think it is?‚Äù

‚Äú It's old, deep in there too. Must've been  built before I was born. But look at this. It's right beside that new bike trail you mentioned.‚Äù He looked at me with glazed eyes. 
 
""Would you- would you get some pictures for me?‚Äù 

‚Äú Yeah Pawpaw will take some pictures. How about I grab you a souvenir too?‚Äù 

""That would be good.‚Äù He pulled me close for another hug. We sat there for a long minute as the bird flew away from the nest, now finished. ‚Äú Just‚Ä¶ be careful. Do you understand me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes sir.‚Äù

the sensitive man I'd come to know vanished, replaced by that rough exoskeleton.

‚ÄúMr. Phillips, time for your lunch. Chickpea salad‚Äù said the young nurse pushing a server into the room.

‚Äú wonderful. Call me if you need anything, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure Pawpaw.‚Äù

The scent vanished as I stepped out into the hall.

The new trail snaked across  the biggest mountain in the state. It sat at the end of the Appalachian foothills. A lone giant surrounded by valleys and smaller mountains. I always wondered how it escaped the erosion of time much unlike those around it. You could see it no matter where you were in town like an omnipresent being watching over our daily lives.

The city decided to add the trail as a way to bring attention to the city. The trail along with three new hotels were just a few ways the city profited off the mountain.

I passed under the Three Little Bears Trailhead sign that hung between pines over the loose gravel drive. Parking, I stepped out into the heavy air of southern spring. The trees overhead blocked the sun's harsh rays but hindered the breeze making the world feel like a laundry mat.

I packed light only carrying a hip bag with some oatmeal bars, a canteen of water, my phone, a lighter and white medical tape.

7:30.am

The trail had three starting points. Each named after the bears from the children's story. Baby Bear was the easiest and Papa Bear was the hardest. Papa was recommended for experienced bickers only. The map at the start of the trail showed each trail eventually met at the top of the mountain. You could go back, turning around on one of the trails  or finish on Goldy Locks down the other trail head across the mountain.

I started on Papa Bear. It was the closest trail to the house. I'd have to step off the trail and trek though the brush for another mile or so. It was risky but I'd done it before.

A large boulder marked Papa Bear's start. I slipped off my shoes and socks and placed them there. The gravel would hurt most of you reading this but my soul was tough from years conditioning. The packed red clay felt like refrigerated butter. I was home, no doubt about it. That urge, the feeling of missing something subsided as a wave of relief washed over my mind, calming me in a way few have experienced. Birds sang to my arrival welcoming me back and wondered where I'd left too. Moss covered oaks swayed in the breeze bowing to my arrival. The fast growing pines washed me with their citrus scent,  
cleansing me of my modern stank. And, like every other time I set out into the forest, goosebumps rose over my body.

Over my years, I'd learned to walk quietly so as not disturbed nature around me. It's harder in shoes that crunch everything under foot. 
So I walked the trial for hours as the sun climbed its daily climb while I climbed over obstacles and weaving paths. The map wasn't wrong, this was a different trail. More rugged and untamed than most, you'd have to be a good biker to make it over this trail without crashing. I'd had my own difficulties on foot.

It was noon when I reached my destination.

I took a rest before traveling deeper, snacking on one of the bars. In hind sight, this was a dumb idea, I'd done it before but never this far off from the trail itself. My plan was to tie little markers to the trees leaving a trail to follow back. 

Once satiated, I took my first step of the trail. My foot crunched the leaves from last fall. I took another step, tied my first piece of surgical tap around a hickory sapling and crunched my way deeper into the forest. The trail was gone after only twenty feet. Young saplings, ancient giants, chirping birds all surrounded me. I was the only thing that resembled order in this chaotic old world. Goosebumps crawled across my body; they were not from joy.

The trek slowed. Getting lost was one thing, stepping on a rattlesnake was another. Trees began blending together unrecognizable from ones ten feet back. Fear set in when I spent two more hours walking when I should have been at the giant magnolia by now. It must have been my slow trek. The sticks and leaves were more dangerous than the packed clay of the trail. I could still see my medical tap so I wasn't worried about being lost. But time was no longer on my side.

I took a break near a large boulder to think. Grey green lichen grew all over it. I crouched on the rock to think, all while the cicadas sang around me. Turn back, and possibly get back to the car. Missing the chance to take photos for Pawpaw, but being safe from a night out in the woods, Or push on, get to the house and get photos. I'd need to stay the night in the forest without cover or shelter, but I'd get the photos. An image of my pawpaw came to me. He was strong walking though the forest with me behind him guiding me along while the sun burned yellow over head. But now the sun was replaced with dull fluorescent bulbs and he was replaced with a withered old man barely clinging to strength sitting by his window alone..

 Power drained from him each day. He would not last another year. This could be the last thing I discover for him.

I tied another marker and pushed forward.


It took me another hour of hiking but I finally made it. The giant magnolia stood proud over the others and could be seen even from beneath the canopy. I slumped past the tree line and into the clearing covered by the magnolia's giant reach. Its trunk was covered with small circular holes that ringed around its trunk. Sap leaked from a few holes. 
A rank scent wrapped around me like a blanket as I approached the tree. I couldn't pinpoint exactly what it smelled like at the time. There, a few steps away was a log cabin with the same wood shingle roof I'd seen from google maps. A bit of sunlight shone down on the roof. But now a thick layer of moss climbed up the siding. It had a small porch with the two crude wooden chairs, one was broken and laid on its side. There was a doorway but no door and looking at the cabin straight on it seemed to be sinking, tilted on the left side. I took a picture and moved forward.

The porch groaned as I tapped onto the rough wood floors. I could see where the traffic areas were, though the occupants no longer lived here, their foot patterns still shown . the wood darkened and smoothed out in these lanes. I craned under the doorway. It was one large room and on one side a hand crafted stone fireplace sat. There was a mantel where a few oddities like animal skulls scattered across it. Two pieces of wood, even with each other on the mantel stood out to me. It was l;ike they were meant to hold something. Three beds sat in the corners of the room, one was large enough for two and seemed to be in the best shape while the others were small and deteriorating. 
I took pictures of everything interesting in the house. A makeshift window without glass, only sticks for framing was on the furthest wall. It led to an overgrown shed in shambles. Sticking out from the tall grass was a makeshift cross. the old twine binding it had dry rotted. Getting closer I saw two more crosses beside the big one, but they were broken and laying on their side. Smaller mounds 
accompanied the smaller crosses.

I took a picture of this as well.

The sun settled, casting amber rays across the scene. I bowed my head and said a quick prayer for the deceased then gathered up some sticks for a fire. 

The chimney was seasoned with soot from years of use. A few pieces of aged charcoal sat at the bottom of the chimney making it easy to get a fire started. Revitalizing orange rays breathed life over the bare log walls of the cabin. likely the first fire this home had seen in years. The fire's warmth washed over me as I sat huddled on the smooth wood in front of the fire. Its heat eased the tension in my mind. Orange light mixing with the moon's glow from the doorway.

My thoughts swirled with the warmth as slumber took me. I wonder why a lonely empty cabin sat in the woods. I wondered what Pawpaw would say about the pictures, if I'd get to see his face light up with wonder one last time. My body was more tired than I realized‚Ä¶


The fire was out when I woke. The room felt cold. I wanted to start the fire again, but something told me to wait. Cacadas no longer sang their peaceful song, nor did the crickets call. The forest around me was dead.

 That rank smell was back filling the cabin. It wofted over me in waves, each second getting worse. I knew why it was familiar.
It was human. The smell of an unwashed body and that body stood in the doorway. Its features were hidden by darkness but its shape was unmistakable. Large bare feet like my own. Strong toned legs from years of wilderness life. Wild, unbrushed hair tangled and matted with a stick hanging from its side.

‚ÄúH-hello‚Äù I sounded like a child who was caught doing something naughty.

There was no response, only a loud click coming from the object it held.
 
It was pointed at me.

The flash from the gun showed me for a moment the complete figure of the woman, but I only saw her face. Twisted and mangled with scars and wrinkles. Her teeth bared at me contorting into what I could only understand as hatred. 
The mantel exploded from the bullet sending wood shrapnel over me. I ducked and ran for the window, slamming through the stick frame.

She ran and grabbed my foot digging in with sharp nails. I kicked connecting with her nose, falling through the window as she scraped off thin sheets of skin from my calf. The forest erupted now animals hooted and haloed around the anticipated violence. She too howled at me with an unknown yet familiar language. I knew what it meant, LEAVE.

I sprinted past the magnolia and the front of the cabin. She was there, loading the flintlock with powder, wide eyes so filled with hatred I felt them burning holes in my back as I booked it through the bushes.
 
White tape white tap were the hel- there! A beacon that i ran for no longer caring what I stepped on, and neither did my pursuer. She stomped and screamed her mangled words at me. She never caught me but as I gained distance her scream became sobs. Painful sobs of sadness. And as ridiculous as it was at that moment, I wanted to stop. 

I kept running. Her voice drowned under a cicada and cricket symphony.


I don't know how long it took me to find the bolder, but it was still night. My feet ached and cacked blood mixed with leaf litter and dirt creating a grotesque batter that smelled of iron. I crouched beside it, calming my breath. What was she doing there? Did she live in these woods if so how long? Her language did remind me of English if it was thrown through a wood chipper. If she followed, I could hear her. The forest was quiet.

I sat and waited for something to happen. Now that I'd calmed down, my feet were more than hurting, one still leaked warm blood from a large gash. The other had smaller cuts all over it. I took off my tie and wrapped the laserated foot in it. Blood soaked through it, but at least I could walk. I grabbed a stick that seemed sturdy and began to hobble along the trail.

I had to stop for balance and that when I heard a stick shatter further ahead, oh god had she lapped me? But then I saw a fluorescent beam bouncing off the canopy. Another snapped twig sounded.

‚Äú over here!‚Äù

The light grazed over me and kept moving for a moment, but snapped back over my frame.

‚Äú there he is‚Äù there were two men in police jackets walking toward me. One carried my shoes.

‚ÄúAre you the owner of these shoes?‚Äù he said pointing to the ones his partner carried.

‚ÄúYeah‚Äù

‚Äú You know the park is closed at dusk, right?

‚ÄúYeah‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why the hell did you stay?‚Äù the other piped up annoyed. His radio buzzed and he answered, ‚Äú yeah we got him.‚Äù

‚Äú i‚Ä¶ I was hunting for a picture. What time is it.‚Äù I swayed without control against a rough pine.

‚Äú It's 12:35 am.‚Äù

‚Äú Jake grabbed him, he looked injured. Sally, get an ambulance down here now!‚Äù 


My injuries were minor. The worst was my foot which got infected after stitches.all and all, it could have been a lot worse. I'd sacrifice a few nights in the hospital , when the other option was  being shot dead by a crazy bitch in the woods.


The janitor scuzzed the hall while I recanted the events of my trip to the three bears hiking trail. He listened as I described the whole scene and provided him pictures. 

‚Äú But you didn't get a picture of her?‚Äù

‚Äú yeah, kinda though more about getting shot than getting her good side‚Äù 
he chuckled

‚Äú that's a fine story son, but I see what you're doing‚Ä¶‚Äù he sighed and looked out the window.

‚Äú What? Pawpaw it's the truth so help me god. She was some kinda hermit living up there all by herself‚Äù

‚Äú What did the police say?‚Äù He looked down at the pictures.

‚Äú I didn't tell them‚Äù

‚Äú Why not? She tried to kill you?‚Äù he tilted his head and looked me dead in the eyes.

‚Äú Well, it's like this. She's been up there for god knows how long by herself. The only reason she tried to kill me was because I invaded her home‚Ä¶ I think. And if the police did believe me and went to check it out she probably responded the same way.‚Äù

‚Äú That's some interesting logic. Hopefully no one else goes looking for it.‚Äù We both looked away, staring at the rainy day outside.

‚ÄúYou know I wouldn't mind living like that.‚Äù

‚Äú I know.‚Äù

He gave me a thoughtful look. We stared at each other for a time, then looked away out the window. 

‚Äú Alright Pawpaw, I've got to go. Works already upset that I missed two whole days.‚Äù

‚Äú I understand‚Ä¶ son could you do me a favor? I'm not strong enough to get this window open. The handyman painted right over the latch, could you open it for me? Just a creak?‚Äù

‚Äú absolutely.‚Äù

I took the butter knife off his tray and sawed at the crease loosening the paint. It was difficult. Under the paint there was a layer of rust seasing it up, but i got it open with a forceful shove.

‚Äú Thank you. It will be nice to get some fresh air.‚Äù
Before leaving I looked at the nest. The mother cardinal sat over her eggs. And I was surprised to see the father bird beside her?
‚Äú He came back?‚Äù
He looked up and smiled.

‚Äú i guess so‚Äù

‚Äú how about tomorrow i take you out for a stroll?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, I'd like that.‚Äù Although he smiled, there was a sadness in his eyes that made me want to drag him out that day. Keep him in my spare room and walk the trails with him until his last day. But that was impossible. I was a single kid barely making enough to support himself. There were people in my family who could have stepped in, but they were caught up in their own lives to worry about one dying old man.


When I walked though the threshold of his room the next day, I expected to see him by the window watching the mother bird warming her eggs, or lying in bed eating the bland eggs and grits. Instead two police officers talked over coffee while someone dusted the windowsill. Another man, dressed in formal clothes, talked with the nurse that brought over lunch. Taking notes of the routine and behaviors of my Pawpaw.
His shoes were placed neatly in his chair and the window stood wide open.

‚ÄúWere is my grandfather?‚Äù I said stepping into the room . the shoes had no dirt on them, but outside there were two foot prints in the mud.

‚Äú Sir, it seems your grandfather broke from hospice last night. Do you have any idea where he might have gone?‚Äù said the well dressed man.

‚Äú No sir, I have no idea.‚Äù

1ml9vt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ml9vt8/i_work_night_shift_at_a_hospital_the_closed_wing/,I work night shift at a hospital. The closed wing keeps paging me.,"They tell you the night shift has a different gravity. The lights are lower, the halls feel longer, and sound travels in ways it doesn‚Äôt during the day. You learn the language of machines‚Äîthe sigh of a ventilator, the soft cough of an IV pump, the staccato alarm that means someone‚Äôs heart just decided it‚Äôs had enough. You also learn which noises to ignore. Hospitals make a thousand harmless sounds in the dark.

But there‚Äôs one sound I was taught to ignore the first week: the overhead page to Wing C.

Wing C is closed.

If you walk the main corridor past the double fire doors, you‚Äôll hit a lit sign that still reads C-WING, but the doors themselves are chained from the inside with a thick brass padlock. Behind them is a dead hallway, a stretch of tile that used to lead to oncology. Five years ago there was a fire‚Äîno one died, but the whole unit was gutted with smoke and water damage. Administration decided it was cheaper to expand elsewhere than to renovate. Maintenance sealed it. Lights cut. Vents capped. Off the map.

And yet, sometimes around two or three in the morning, the overhead speakers will crackle and a female voice will say: ‚ÄúDr. Rahman to Wing C. Dr. Rahman, please report to Wing C.‚Äù

The veterans told me it was a glitch in the old paging system that nobody wanted to pay to fix. ‚ÄúIf you hear it, you didn‚Äôt,‚Äù my preceptor said, only half joking. ‚ÄúKeep your head down and keep charting.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt think about it much my first month. Nights are a fog of meds, vitals, empty coffee cups. But three weeks ago, on a Tuesday that felt like a Thursday and tasted like stale gum, I was covering observation beds when the speakers popped.

‚ÄúDr. Rahman to Wing C.‚Äù

Two seconds later, it repeated, a little louder. ‚ÄúDr. Rahman, please report to Wing C.‚Äù

I looked up at the ceiling tile, then at the clock. 3:12 a.m.

‚ÄúOld system burping,‚Äù said Hadi, the tech at the station. He didn‚Äôt even glance up from the monitor. ‚ÄúIgnore it.‚Äù

We went back to charting. At 3:17, five minutes later, the page chimed again.

‚ÄúDr. Rahman, Wing C.‚Äù

Now the voice sounded wrong‚Äîwarmer than the usual automated page, like a person leaning toward a mic. Hadi‚Äôs fingers froze on the keyboard for a heartbeat, then resumed. He pretended not to hear.

I wish I could say I did the same.

The third time it came, something in me tightened‚Äînot a big thing, just a knot under the ribs. I told myself I was curious, or maybe I wanted a walk to wake up. I told myself a lot of things as I stood and grabbed the master keys from the hook.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to grab blankets from supply,‚Äù I told Hadi.

‚ÄúCool,‚Äù he said, still not looking.

I didn‚Äôt go to supply.

The corridor to Wing C isn‚Äôt far from Observation. The hospital was built in phases, and you can feel the seams where one decade attaches to another. The floor tiles shift color. The walls jump from modern antiseptic gray to older plaster painted a shade they probably once called ‚Äúsoothing sage‚Äù and now looks like the undertone of a bruise.

The C-WING doors looked like they always do: chained and padlocked with a tag that read DO NOT REMOVE. Beyond them, only dark.

I don‚Äôt know what I expected‚Äîvoices, movement, something to make me laugh at myself and turn around. Instead, I got the smell.

Hospitals have a smell. Even scrubbed clean, they keep a base note of disinfectant and human breath, with hints of coffee and sadness. The air near the C doors was wrong. It was colder, and underneath the cold was a whisper of burned plastic. If you‚Äôve ever left a cheap kettle on too long and caught it just before it died, you know the smell. Hot, faintly sweet, a little poisonous.

I stood there a full minute, listening. Nothing.

Then I noticed the chain wasn‚Äôt actually threaded through both handles. It was looped through the left handle and around a bar welded to the right. If you lifted the left handle hard enough, the chain would slacken just enough to slip an arm through.

I didn‚Äôt decide to try. My hand just moved.

The handle was stiff, colder than the metal should have been. It squeaked when I pulled. The chain bowed. I slipped my arm through, awkwardly, and found the interior bar. It took three tries to catch it with my fingers and lift. The doors gave a little, enough to let me lean my shoulder in and slide.

I know what you‚Äôre thinking: stupid. I‚Äôve thought it too, a hundred times since. But at the time it felt inevitable, like the voluntary part of me had stepped aside to let something older do the walking.

Inside, the dark had weight. I clicked on my penlight. The beam picked out dust like snow in a tunnel of air. The hallway past the doors felt abandoned in a way that clean spaces never can. There were outlines on the wall where signs used to be, squares a few shades lighter than the surrounding paint. A rolling chair with one wheel missing lay tipped on its side, the split plastic of the broken caster sharp as a snapped tooth.

I told myself I‚Äôd go twenty steps and turn back.

I took twenty-one, then twenty-two, then lost count.

‚ÄúDr. Rahman to Wing C.‚Äù

The page came again, but it sounded different in there‚Äîlike it wasn‚Äôt coming from above me, but from ahead. The penlight shook in my hand. I kept walking.

I passed the old nurse station. Someone had draped a dusty sheet over the counter, and the sheet had settled around the equipment like a frozen wave. I lifted a corner. Underneath was an intercom module with big square buttons, the kind you‚Äôd see in a school hallway thirty years ago. The PA switch had a crack across it, a lightning fork through faded plastic.

The page came again. This time the speaker wasn‚Äôt the ceiling; it was the intercom box. The tiny grille hissed, and that same woman‚Äôs voice‚Äînot automated, human‚Äîcame through, soft as brushing your cheek.

‚ÄúDr. Rahman, please.‚Äù

For a second, I wasn‚Äôt on night shift in an empty wing. I was eight years old, and my mother was calling my father‚Äôs name from the kitchen, tired and trying not to sound it.

The feeling hit hard and vanished. I backed away from the counter and nearly tripped over the corner of the sheet.

The patient rooms in Wing C were square and small. My light found the numbers above the doors‚ÄîC-301, C-302, C-303. The third had scorch marks around the frame that weren‚Äôt there on the others, little fingers of soot reaching out across the paint. My throat tightened. Stupid. I moved on.

At C-307 I stopped.

The door was shut like the rest, but the call light above the frame‚Äîthe flat plastic rectangle that glows when a patient hits their button‚Äîwas on.

It pulsed slowly, sickly yellow, the color of old teeth.

I stood there, very still. Another hospital, another year, someone might have wired the system to test. But this wing wasn‚Äôt wired to anything. The power feeds were cut. If you shoved a plug into an outlet in here, it would give you only silence.

The light pulsed once, twice.

I put my ear to the door. The wood was cool. I heard nothing from inside except my own breath, and beyond that, the building‚Äôs heartbeat: vents that weren‚Äôt supposed to be running, something settling overhead, pipes you swear you can hear thinking.

The handle turned when I tried it. The hinges creaked. The smell got thicker‚Äîburned plastic and something else, a medicinal sweetness like old cough syrup.

The room was empty.

No bed, no chair. The window was blacked out with plywood, the edges caulked. On the far wall, someone had drawn a square with a carpenter‚Äôs pencil‚Äîfour precise lines, like they intended to cut into the drywall and then changed their mind.

On the floor sat a call bell unit, the plastic casing yellowed with age. The cord snaked out under the door, up to the light. Someone had hardwired it directly to the indicator.

It shouldn‚Äôt have been on.

I crouched. The unit wasn‚Äôt connected to power in any way I could see. The cord ran into the wall and ended. Still, the light above me pulsed, like a slow breath.

I thumbed the ‚Äúcancel‚Äù on the bell. Nothing.

‚ÄúDr. Rahman to Wing C.‚Äù

The voice came from behind me this time, in the hall, as if whoever was paging had stepped into the corridor and was calling to me by my wrong name, asking me to be someone else.

I left the room. I told myself I‚Äôd seen enough. Curiosity satisfied.

At the nurse station, the intercom‚Äôs little red ‚ÄúTRANSMIT‚Äù LED was lit. My hand hovered over the button marked RESET.

I pressed it.

The light went out. The intercom went quiet. My penlight framed a small label under the unit, written in old adhesive tape, the kind that turns brown at the edges: R. RAHMAN.

I don‚Äôt know why that felt like a punch. People leave labels. It means nothing. I turned away.

That‚Äôs when I heard the footsteps.

They weren‚Äôt the heavy thump of boots or the clack of heels. They were the flat, damp sound of bare feet, quick and close. They ran across tile somewhere to my right, then stopped. I spun the light. It found only dust and an overturned laundry cart.

Something brushed my shoulder.

Not air, not imagination. It had direction and weight, the way a child‚Äôs hand has weight when it patters past your sleeve. I swung the light and saw a smear on the fabric of my scrub top‚Äîa brownish print the size of a small palm, as if someone had pressed their hand there and left a whisper of iodine.

I walked out.

I didn‚Äôt run. My brain instructed my legs: walk, do not run, because running makes it real, and your back is too open. I walked the same number of steps out that I had taken in, or tried to. I reached the chained doors and shouldered through the gap, bumping the metal hard enough to bruise a rib.

Back in the lit corridor, the hospital‚Äôs normal smell hit like a wave of sanity. The burned-plastic sweetness was gone. The overhead speakers were quiet. The clock read 3:36.

At the station, Hadi glanced up.

‚ÄúBlankets?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt have any,‚Äù I said. My voice was too thin. I cleared my throat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll grab from third.‚Äù

He nodded and went back to the screen. I sat down with my charting and watched my hands not shake.

I told myself I‚Äôd dreamt half of it. Lack of sleep puts cracks in you where weird things leak in. But the smear on my scrub top didn‚Äôt dream. I tossed the shirt at home and tried not to think about it.

The next two nights were uneventful. I let myself believe the old guys‚ÄîPA system glitch, nerves, nothing more. Then Friday came.

It was busy. We had a double admission at 1 a.m., then a combative withdrawal at 2:20. By the time I sat to breathe, it was 3:05. I took one sip of coffee that tasted like cigarette filters and then the speaker cracked.

‚ÄúDr. Rahman to Wing C.‚Äù

The hair rose on my arms.

I kept typing. Hadi didn‚Äôt look up. The second page came and then the third, spaced in fives like someone watching the clock.

I held the keys for twenty minutes and didn‚Äôt stand.

And then Patient Deeb in Obs 6 hit his call bell with the insistence of a toddler with a new toy. He wanted to tell me the TV remote wasn‚Äôt responding to channel up, only channel down. I replaced the batteries and told him to sleep.

When I stepped back into the hallway, a second call light was glowing at the far end, in the direction of C-Wing. Not the sealed doors‚Äîthe light above the small service door across from them that led to a linen closet. The indicator above it pulsed the same old-teeth yellow as the one I‚Äôd seen in C-307.

The service door wasn‚Äôt supposed to have a call light. It wasn‚Äôt even on the same system. I stood there, coffee clawing its way up my throat, and watched it blink.

I don‚Äôt remember unlocking that door. I remember the closet smell‚Äîwarm dust, the starch of folded sheets. There was a hatch in the back wall I‚Äôd never noticed, a rectangle cut into the drywall and screwed back in place. The screws looked fresh compared to the rest of the wall. Someone had put a strip of duct tape across one corner. On the tape, a word in black marker: SPARE.

I peeled the tape back and put my ear to the panel. From the other side came the faintest sound, like a radio in another room tuned between stations. Not talk, not music. The idea of voices.

I closed the door carefully and locked it. The light above it went out.

When I turned back toward the station, Hadi was watching me. His face had that carefully blank expression nurses use when someone‚Äôs doing something they shouldn‚Äôt and you don‚Äôt want to write it down later.

‚ÄúYou hearing it?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe page.‚Äù

I nodded.

He let out a breath through his nose. ‚ÄúUsed to be before the fire, Dr. Rahman was oncology night. He was‚Ä¶ good. He‚Äôd sit with people who were dying like he had nowhere else to be. After the fire, the first month we came back, the page would call him every night. Then less. Then just on some weeks. I don‚Äôt know why it started up again.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened to him?‚Äù I asked.

Hadi looked at the ceiling in a way that meant he truly didn‚Äôt know. ‚ÄúTransferred? Retired? Everyone old enough to remember is either days or gone.‚Äù

The rest of that shift felt like the kind of dream where you keep trying to pack a bag but your hands won‚Äôt pick up anything you need. I finished my charting by force and drove home as the sky went colorless behind the buildings.

Two nights later, I was off. I woke at 3:17 exactly, heart like a fish in my chest. The room smelled faintly like burned plastic. I got up, turned on all the lights, and told myself I was being dramatic.

On my next stretch, the page came at 3:12, 3:17, 3:22. It was almost funny in its punctuality. I didn‚Äôt go to Wing C. I cleaned IV poles like a man scrubbing guilt. I let Hadi field the noise with his practiced ignoring.

Then Mr. Deeb coded at 3:29. Real alarms screamed; real feet ran. We worked him for six minutes and bought him a heartbeat, a ragged, fragile thing, but it held. In the aftermath, as we gathered our chests back into our bodies, the overhead cracked.

‚ÄúDr. Rahman to Wing C.‚Äù

Something in me snapped.

Maybe it was exhaustion, or the electric aftertaste of adrenaline, or the way the page cut through real life like a knife through the line that divides then from now. I took the keys. I didn‚Äôt lie to Hadi. I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to C,‚Äù and he said nothing and looked at his hands.

The doors gave the same way they had before. The burned smell met me like a friend I didn‚Äôt like. I went straight to C-307. The light above the door was already on, pulsing.

Inside, the square on the wall had changed.

It wasn‚Äôt pencil anymore. Someone had cut it. The drywall rectangle leaned against the baseboard. Beyond the hole was a space‚Äîtwo studs wide, dusty, the inside of a wall. My light sowed its little beam into the cavity and found wires, a dead roach, and, at the bottom, a box.

It was a small plastic case the size of a paperback, the kind they sell at electronics stores to keep components safe, with a cracked, smoky lid. Inside, a circuit board sat like a fossilized leaf.

Printed across the board in ink that had run from heat were two words: Rahman Pager.

I picked up the box and nearly dropped it. It was warm‚Äîhotter than it had any right to be, like it had been sitting in sunlight. I set it on the floor, pried the lid, and saw the board was wired to a battery pack grafted in with electrical tape. Old. Improvised. Wrong.

Someone had built a device, shoved it into the wall, and left it to cook. And the intercom‚Äîreset or not‚Äîkept obeying it.

That‚Äôs when the monitor woke.

Hospitals are full of screens. Even in a dead wing, there are terminals. Most won‚Äôt boot without power. This one did, somehow, though the plug drooped out of a socket that wasn‚Äôt live. The screen flickered and spit a green cursor into a black field like a relic from a forgotten decade.

Letters rolled across in a slow type no human could duplicate.

SUBJECT: R. RAHMAN
STATUS: ALREADY FAILED
INSTRUCTIONS: ERASE MEMORY. START LOOP.

My mouth went dry. I stepped back. My heel hit the corner of the hole and the drywall scraped my ankle. Something moved in the intercom behind me, a tiny rattle like a bead in a child‚Äôs toy.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not him,‚Äù I said out loud, because the room had become a person you had to address. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not.‚Äù

The words felt futile. The monitor didn‚Äôt care. The cursor blinked twice and then new text slid in.

NEW SUBJECT: [ ]
ENTER NAME

I turned to go. I made it to the hall. I made it three steps, five, nine. Then the overhead speaker in the dead ceiling opened and whispered‚Äî

‚Äînot the woman‚Äôs voice, but my own. Recorded, slightly tinny, but mine.

‚ÄúDr. Rahman to Wing C.‚Äù

I wish this is where I say I ran. I didn‚Äôt. I stood there, dumb, and let the sound pass through me. It felt like standing in a doorway with a hand on both frames and realizing you‚Äôre the door.

I went back to the nurse station like I‚Äôd been underwater and finally found air again. Hadi looked up and paled. ‚ÄúYou look like hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a‚Ä¶ device. In the wall. Something built. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ paging itself.‚Äù

He shook his head. ‚ÄúAdmin said they pulled all that after the fire.‚Äù

‚ÄúAdmin says a lot.‚Äù

We didn‚Äôt call anyone. Who would we call? Maintenance would shrug. Security would give us a form. The house supervisor would tell us to focus on patient care. So we did. For the rest of the night, no pages came. At 6 a.m., I went back to C-307 to convince myself I‚Äôd overreacted.

The hole was still there. The box wasn‚Äôt.

On the way out, at the intercom, I saw the old tape label again: R. RAHMAN. I peeled it back. Underneath, in smaller, faded handwriting, was a second label, almost erased by time.

R. RAHMAN ‚Äì TEMP.

The next day I spent an hour in the basement records room. The clerk, a woman with glasses that magnified her eyes, let me browse the old staff rosters from the year of the fire. There was no Dr. Rahman in oncology. There was a Rahman, R., but not a physician. A night orderly. Six months on the job. Terminated after the fire. Reason: ‚ÄúWorkplace violation.‚Äù

When I asked what that meant, the clerk shrugged. ‚ÄúCould be anything. Taking supplies home. Sleeping on shift. Something worse. We didn‚Äôt digitize the details from that year.‚Äù

As I left, she called after me. ‚ÄúWe did have one doctor who used to sit nights with patients. He was a pediatrician who volunteered when he couldn‚Äôt sleep. Not a Rahman, though. Different name.‚Äù

I drove home with the taste of burned plastic in my throat and the feeling that the building had a mouth and I had been talking into it.

I wish I could tell you I quit. I pictured writing a tidy email and walking out into a life where nights are for sleeping and walls are just walls. I pictured that and then found myself clocking in again at dusk, as if the punch reader had a gravity I couldn‚Äôt fight.

The following shift, the pages started earlier. 2:57. 3:02. 3:07. Every five minutes like a metronome. I didn‚Äôt answer. Patients needed meds and encouragement and blankets and human things. I gave those and pretended the other need wasn‚Äôt there.

At 3:21, Obs 6‚Äôs monitor blared a false lead-off alarm. I silenced it, checked the wires, taped them down. When I stepped back into the hall, the lights flickered. Not a full stutter, just a blink long enough to take one image of the world and steal it, so when the light returned you had to compare the two and decide what was missing.

What was missing was my key ring.

It had been clipped to my waistband. Now it wasn‚Äôt. My left hip felt naked.

I checked the floor, my pockets, the station, the bathroom. Nothing. Hadi raised his eyebrows, sympathy plus we‚Äôre so screwed. Without master keys, you are a body without hands.

We retraced my steps, me with the suspicion-taste of a stolen wallet rising. When we reached the hall by Wing C, the keys sat on the floor three inches inside the chained doors, as if someone had dropped them on the other side and nudged them into view with a toe.

I looked at Hadi. He shook his head once, emphatic.

I slid my arm through the gap.

The keys were warm.

I wish that was the end. It wasn‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt get an end with these things. You get a narrowing, a pressure, and if you‚Äôre lucky, a place where you can stand with your back to something solid and keep breathing.

Last night, the page came not at five-minute intervals but as a continuous whisper. It didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúDr. Rahman‚Äù anymore. It said my name.

Not the name on the schedule or the roster. The name my mother used when she wanted me to come home. The one I haven‚Äôt heard in years except inside my own head.

It called it soft, patient, as if it had all the time in the world. As if it could wait. As if it had been waiting since long before me and would keep waiting long after.

I took the keys and went to Wing C and stood in front of C-307 and didn‚Äôt go in. The light above the door pulsed and I let it. I said, quietly, to the empty hall, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt remember you.‚Äù

The intercom clicked. The old computer in the nurse station hummed though no one had touched it. Somewhere in the walls, a battery warmed a circuit board and sent a signal into the dark.

I took a marker from my pocket‚Äîthe kind we use to label tubing‚Äîand wrote on the wall outside 307 at the level of my eye: IF YOU SEE THIS, DO NOT GO IN.

Then I went back to the living, to the patients who ask for extra ice and the ones who need a hand to hold at 4 a.m. when the long thoughts come.

When my shift ended and the sun did that pale trick it does at dawn, I walked out past the chained doors, past the sign that says C-WING, past the smell that might be in the air or just in my head. I walked into morning and the ordinary world and said my name out loud to hear it from a human tongue.

When I came back tonight, the marker writing was gone. Not scrubbed‚Äîgone, like no one had ever written anything there. The wall looked the way it did the day of the fire, if that makes sense, the paint holding its breath.

So I‚Äôm writing this down here while I still remember. Because maybe that old screen wasn‚Äôt talking to me. Maybe it was leaving a note the way you leave a nightlight on for your own return. Maybe the loop isn‚Äôt a trap so much as a bargain the building made to keep something behind the walls from coming out. Give me a name and I will drop a page. Give me a name and I will keep them busy while the living sleep. Give me a name and I will erase it at dawn.

If you work nights in a hospital and you hear a page to a wing that doesn‚Äôt exist anymore, don‚Äôt answer. If you do answer, don‚Äôt go past the third door on the left. If you do go past it and you find a call light pulsing over a room with no bed and a hole where a square used to be, don‚Äôt pick up the box. Don‚Äôt press the intercom button. Don‚Äôt read the screen.

And if you hear a voice on the PA that sounds like your own, remember that buildings learn the language of the people inside them. If you tell them your name enough times, they will learn how to say it back.

If I forget this tomorrow, someone reading will remember for me. That‚Äôs the other trick of nights: the way strangers hold each other‚Äôs stories up to the weak light like x-rays, seeing what‚Äôs broken and what‚Äôs missing and what‚Äôs trying to heal.

I‚Äôm going to finish my round now. The page just came again. It didn‚Äôt call any name this time. It said, softly, like a parent standing at a door that won‚Äôt open:

‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù

And whatever you do‚Äîif you ever hear that‚Äîdon‚Äôt answer.",4,1754694289.0,nosleep,1,0.84,False

This guy (25m) i‚Äôve (25f) known online recently got out of a 7 year relationship because his fiance cheated on him multiple times. I just got out an 8 year abusive relationship. 

We started talking more and comforting one another since we had a lot in common. He decided to take an impulse trip to meet me and we spent an entire week at a cabin together this last week. This was totally unlike either of us since we‚Äôve basically never been single adults. We were intimate almost immediately and it felt special. We cried to each other, i comforted him as much as I could. I took him out to all the places i knew and paid for it too. I made him coffee every morning, gave him massages and lots of affection. He honestly seemed smitten by me. He‚Äôd get lost talking to me and tell me how pretty I was. I felt good for the first time in a really really long time. He told me no matter what happened we‚Äôd be friends if we weren‚Äôt together romantically. 

Him and his ex still live together since it was recent, he talked to me about how he was going to make her move out within a couple months. He seemed like he had a hatred for her until he got home. He texted me the night he got home and felt guilty and told me he didn‚Äôt want to talk to me anymore. 

I understand that I should‚Äôve known better with the situation being so fresh, I‚Äôve already been hitting myself repeatedly for the impulsive decisions. I can‚Äôt help but feel so used and gross with myself. I was just so lonely and in need of touch. I have cried so many times already. I didn‚Äôt even feel this sad about my long relationship ending.

1ml9sb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/1ml9sb2/my_ultimate_recovery_guide_for_dpdr/,My ultimate recovery guide for DP/DR,"When I had DP/DR, it felt like it would never go away, but I never lost hope that this day would come. And I want to note that many people leave this community after overcoming DP/DR without sharing their experiences. When I was struggling with this condition, I promised myself that if I recovered, I would do everything I could to help others. I‚Äôve been planning to write this guide for a long time, but I never found the right moment and even drafted and deleted it several times. Now, here it is!


What is DP/DR?
DP/DR is a defense mechanism that our brain deploy to protect us from excessive stress. During moments of intense stress, such as panic attacks, trauma, anxiety, or severe depression, the brain may disconnect us from ourselves and our environment to cope. This mechanism prevents us from ‚Äúfully‚Äù experiencing the overwhelming stress. It‚Äôs a quite interesting process, and that‚Äôs how it works. According to an article, most people experience DP/DR at some point in their lives, but typically only briefly. Normally, when the extreme stress subsides, DP/DR resolves as well. However, in some individuals and situations, it persists and becomes chronic.


What happens in the brain during DP/DR?
The exact mechanisms of depersonalization/derealization are not fully understood, but it is hypothesized that some brain regions are underactive while others are overactive, leading to miscommunication between these regions. Other potential factors include glutamate dysregulation, kappa-opioid receptor agonism, and insufficient oxygen supply to certain brain areas. In the following chapters, I will revisit these issues and discuss available treatment options.


Who are more likely to develop chronic DP/DR?
As I mentioned, DP/DR is a very under-diagnosed condition that many people experience at some point in their lives. For most, it resolves spontaneously without intervention. However, in some cases, it persists. Based on my observations, those with chronic DP/DR often have an underlying mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, OCD, panic disorder, or bipolar disorder and so on. In short, individuals with these conditions are more likely to experience chronic DP/DR.


How did I develop DP/DR?
My experience is not much different from others‚Äô stories. One day, I smoked weed with a friend and, for the first time in my life, I had an extremely severe panic attack. My heart pounded incredibly fast and powerful for two hours, and during that time, I was convinced I was going to die. I couldn‚Äôt go to the hospital because weed was illegal. If I had to describe those moments in one word, I would say, ‚Äúterror‚Äù. And eventually, the panic attack subsided, and I went home.
When I woke up, a different world awaited me. My hands felt foreign, my face seemed unfamiliar, and the world appeared unreal. Everything felt incredibly artificial. At first, I didn‚Äôt understand what was happening. I was terrified that I damaged my brain and could only cry. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, but when I shared this with my roommate, she was incredibly supportive. She, my friend, and I went on a vacation to escape it all, and by the end of five days, the DP/DR was completely gone. I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes. Was that really all it took? (As I mentioned, it resolves quickly for most people.) But one night, while sleeping, I had a vivid flashback of that night and when I woke up, the DP/DR was back. Later, it faded on its own again. But one day, a text notification from my friend with whom I smoked marijuana triggered my entire trauma all over again. The content of the message was quite ordinary, but my brain likely associated my friend with my trauma. Seeing the notification, or rather, my friend's notification, literally triggered my trauma again, and this time, the DP/DR became permanent.


Recovery
This is the chapter everyone wants to read, and I can assure you that DP/DR is an absolutely recoverable disorder. I say this with 100% confidence. For some, recovery is easy for others, it requires a lot of dedication and hard work. There are dozens of ways to recover, and I‚Äôll share what I‚Äôve learned so far from people that cured DP/DR, articles, clinical trials and etc. 

1.  Address Underlying CausesAs mentioned earlier, one of the first and most critical steps to overcoming DP/DR is tackling its underlying causes. If you struggle with anxiety, depression, panic disorder, or other mental health conditions, treating these should be your top priority. For many, resolving the underlying issue causes DP/DR to disappear on its own.

2.  Stop Obsessing Over DP/DRConstantly reading about DP/DR is like pouring gasoline on a fire. If you view DP/DR as a fire, your goal is to extinguish it, not fuel it. My advice is to read only recovery stories for a couple of days to see for yourself that recovery is possible and to learn about the many ways others have healed. However, after a short period, stop reading about DP/DR entirely.

3. Socialize
Go out, have coffee with a friend, take a vacation, or join a reading, cycling, or dance club. Immerse yourself in nature, learn a new language, or pick up an instrument. Try dating or adopting a cat or dog. I can‚Äôt stress enough the importance of socializing. As I mentioned earlier, a five-day vacation helped clear my head and temporarily eliminated my DP/DR. By the way, I highly recommend adopting a cat a natural serotonin booster!

4. Drop Harmful Habits
Eliminate sugar, refined carbohydrates, processed foods, alcohol, and smoking in short, anything harmful to your body. Reducing these lowers stress and cortisol levels, which naturally benefits DP/DR.

5. Adopt a Ketogenic Diet
Implementing a ketogenic diet is challenging, but the rewards are significant. I‚Äôve seen many people fully recover from DP/DR simply by following a ketogenic diet. During my time on keto, my motivation, mood, and energy levels increased, and I felt healthier overall, even noticing improvements for my digestion. Though I‚Äôm not an expert, research shows the ketogenic diet supports cognitive function, neuroprotection, reduced inflammation, and improved mental health. 

6. Intermittent Fasting
I‚Äôve read on this subreddit and other forums that intermittent fasting benefits many people. Someone shared a scientific article highlighting IF‚Äôs positive effects on brain function and neuroinflammation. I encourage you to research and explore these benefits for yourself.

7. Exercise and Cardio
Exercise, including bodybuilding and cardio, is incredibly beneficial for mental health. It‚Äôs well-known that building muscle naturally boosts endorphins, enhancing mood. Physical activity is vital not only for the body but also for the brain, as it increases self-confidence. The better our bodies look and the more conditioned we are, the more confident we feel. My advice is to keep workouts moderate, lasting no longer than 45 minutes, to avoid excessive cortisol spikes, which can worsen stress. I recommend a full-body workout 3‚Äì4 times a week and 10‚Äì15 minutes of daily cardio.

8. Meditation
I don‚Äôt know a better way to relax and release stress trapped in our bodies. Before I started meditating, I thought it was nonsense. How could sitting quietly and clearing your mind help? But meditation calms the mind, quiets the constant inner chatter, and reduces stress. No need to overcomplicate it. I meditated for 5‚Äì10 minutes every morning upon waking and before bed each night.

9. Full-Body Muscle Relaxation
There are several videos on YouTube explaining how to perform this technique. In essence, you tighten and then relax each muscle group in your body, from your hands to your feet. This practice not only promotes relaxation but also helps release tension and stress stored in your muscles.

10. Trauma Release Exercises
I highly recommend these exercises if your DP/DR developed after a traumatic event. In brief, these exercises involve shaking to release trauma trapped in the body.
https://youtu.be/FeUioDuJjFI?si=0IoLH8C3ruoa1ACR

11. Affirmations
I can‚Äôt stress enough the importance of convincing your brain that you are healthy and everything is okay. I learned a powerful tactic from a woman named Wizard Liz in her video ‚ÄúThis Video Will Change Your Life,‚Äù and I applied everything I learned there.
https://youtu.be/Lk6AkrT5g5w?si=47vbMPjBp86pAHTj

12. Vagus Nerve Stimulation Exercises 
The vagus nerve regulates the parasympathetic nervous system in our body. Chronic stress, trauma, and similar events might dysregulate it, causing the body to remain stuck in fight-or-flight mode under the control of the sympathetic nervous system. There are numerous vagus nerve exercises available on YouTube, and I highly recommend trying them. I also purchased a Vagus Nerve Stimulation Device, which you wear in your ear or around your neck. It sends low-power electrical signals to activate the vagus nerve. Check it out.

13. Breathing Exercises
We breathe in and out tens of thousands of times each day, making it essential to optimize this constant process. There are many breathing exercises, most of which share similar principles. My favorite is the 4-7-8 breathing technique. Research I‚Äôve come across suggests that breathing exercises can reduce stress and alleviate dissociation, making them highly effective for overall well-being.

14. Eye Exercises
In my experience, these are particularly helpful for derealization. When DP/DR, my eye muscles felt drained and constantly fatigued, making it torturous to focus on a single point. To perform this exercise, place two objects at eye level one far away and one nearby. Close one eye and focus on the far object, then switch to the near object, alternating to train your eye muscles. Repeat 20‚Äì30 times or more for each eye. You can find guided eye exercises by searching on YouTube.

15. Trauma Release Yoga
This was my favorite activity during my healing process because it felt incredibly rejuvenating for my body. I loved relaxing my muscles, pushing my body to its limits, and holding specific poses. Yoga is, in my opinion, one of the best activities for nurturing both body and mind.
https://youtu.be/24qDdn2QXjk?si=vcORXf4B_9_ubYbc

16. Cold Shower Upon Waking
When I was experiencing DP/DR, I constantly felt tired and sleepy. Cold showers delivered such a shock to my system that I felt wide awake and energized immediately afterward, with the effects lasting all day. 

17. Comprehensive Blood Test
Getting a comprehensive blood test is crucial, as deficiencies in certain vitamins or minerals can worsen DP/DR. I recommend testing for B vitamins, vitamin D, iron, magnesium, DHEA, DHEA-S, cortisol, testosterone, and thyroid function.

18. Supplements
During my healing process, I tried numerous supplements, many of which I found unnecessary. However, some were quite helpful, including magnesium glycinate, omega-3, phosphatidylserine, probiotics, taurine, glycine, and ginkgo biloba. Also I suggest taking Vitamin D and Iron injections regardless of your levels. High level of Iron will supply more oxygen to brain which in theory should help to DP/DR. 

19. Regular Sleep
I should have mentioned this earlier, but I overlooked it. Getting 7‚Äì8 hours of uninterrupted sleep daily is crucial. On days when I slept enough, I felt more alert and energetic, and my DP/DR symptoms were less severe. Conversely, on days when I didn‚Äôt get enough sleep, my DP/DR especially derealization worsened significantly. Using BreatheRight strips at night greatly improved my sleep quality, and I highly recommend them.

20. Medications
Medications can be hit-or-miss. A drug that works quickly for one person may have no effect on another. My advice is to choose medications based on the underlying cause of your DP/DR. For example, if someone experiences frequent anxiety attacks, an antidepressant to manage anxiety may also alleviate DP/DR symptoms. In my opinion, the most promising medications include clomipramine, lamotrigine, naltrexone, clonazepam (for intense anxiety and panic attacks), Adderall, and pregabalin. Always research these medications thoroughly and consult your doctor before starting any treatment.

21-Neurobic Exercises
One of the primary causes of dissociation is believed to be an imbalance in brain activity, where some areas are overactive while others are underactive. This imbalance disrupts communication between different parts of the brain. As a result, our perceptions, environment, and bodily sensations feel altered or unfamiliar. To address this, we need to engage in exercises that stimulate various brain regions. These exercises help the brain create new neural pathways and repair those that are malfunctioning. Examples include brushing your teeth with your non-dominant hand.

Treatments I Haven‚Äôt Tried but Believe May Help

1. Norbinaltorphimine
As mentioned earlier, I hypothesize that kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) upregulation contributes to DP/DR symptoms. The KOR mechanism is highly complex, directly or indirectly affecting serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate levels. Research suggests that KOR agonism can induce out-of-body experiences and DP/DR-like symptoms. If KOR agonism triggers or exacerbates DP/DR, its antagonism could, in theory, alleviate these symptoms. Many individuals on forums and subreddits report overcoming DP/DR using naltrexone, an opioid antagonist. However, naltrexone inhibits not only KOR but also Mu and Delta opioid receptors, preventing endorphins from binding to these receptors, which are crucial for experiencing pleasure and well-being. Additionally, naltrexone has low affinity for KOR, meaning it does not fully inhibit it. Through my research, I found norbinaltorphimine (nor-BNI) as a promising alternative. Nor-BNI has an exceptionally high affinity for KOR, enabling near-complete or complete inhibition, while its affinity for mu- and delta-opioid receptors is minimal, preserving endorphin function, an advantage for DP/DR treatment.
I must emphasize that norbinaltorphimine is an experimental substance. It is not FDA-approved, and to my knowledge, no clinical trials in humans have been conducted. Anecdotal reports suggest benefits for some individuals, but it remains unapproved for clinical use. If you are considering nor-BNI, I strongly recommend conducting thorough research and consulting with medical professionals experienced in this area.


2. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy
As I mentioned earlier, I hypothesize that insufficient oxygen supply to the brain may contribute to DP/DR symptoms. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can increase oxygen delivery to the brain by approximately 20 times compared to normal conditions. If brain dysfunction in DP/DR is linked to lack of oxygen, HBOT could address this by providing significantly more oxygen. Anecdotal evidence suggests that HBOT has helped some individuals reduce DP/DR symptoms and brain fog. Dr. Daniel Amen, founder of Amen Clinics, has noted HBOT‚Äôs potential promise for DP/DR patients, further supporting its exploration as a treatment option.


3. TMS and Neurofeedback
As I previously discussed, DP/DR is often associated with imbalanced brain activity, where some regions are overactive or underactive, leading to disrupted communication between brain areas. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and neurofeedback both address these dysregulations but differ in approach. TMS uses magnetic pulses to directly stimulate specific brain regions, while neurofeedback trains individuals to self-regulate brainwave patterns through real-time feedback. Both therapies leverage external interventions to restore balanced brain function. I liken these two, especially Neurofeedback, to Neurobic exercises. The only problem is that they are both very costly treatment options.



I‚Äôve shared everything that has helped me to the best of my ability. I understand that applying all these things may feel overwhelming, but my advice is to do as much as you can, as often as you can. With persistence, you can reclaim your freedom and return to your former self. I hope this guide offers hope and practical support to those having DP/DR.",1,1754694037.0,dpdr,1,1.0,False
