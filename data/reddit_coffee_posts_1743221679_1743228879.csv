1jmfy6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1jmfy6a/went_to_the_er/,Went to the ER.,"Last Saturday I went all out started with about 200 ml of whiskey in my coffee, then moved over and drank about 13 9% IPA's.  I went to bed at 830 pm that night stumbling drunk.  I woke up the next morning at 4 am and drank water to recover and I couldn't breathe, I wanted to puke but I was afraid because I couldn't swallow properly and was terrified I was going to choke on my vomit.  I immediately started having a anxiety/panic attack I said to myself I either lay down in bed and hope to ride this out or I go to the hospital.  

I went checked myself in I am sure they knew i was coming down because they admitted me stuck me in a room looked in my throat and said maybe strep throat but I doubt it.  Did their tests and literally left me in there from 430 am til 9 am alone sleeping.  The whole time I felt like my stomach was so full it would explode, but I wanted to drink water but knew if I did it would make my stomach worse or I'd puke, still not being able to swallow I had another panic attack alone in the ER.  I started having these terrible hot flashes my face got real hot like my body was trying it's damndest to push the alcohol up to my head and sweat out the poison.  After 9 am I drove back home and slept all day. I was so embarrassed I went to the ER but it was the wake up call I needed.  Alcohol free since last Sunday morning.  

I have been fighting the urge to drink everyday.  The cravings are real and I have to push them out of my head because I will not get like that again.  I haven't had a day not hungover or drunk in 2 years.  What helps with the urges?",5,1743228436.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

Imagine a world where billionaires bid for your vote like it’s a Black Friday deal. That’s not democracy; it’s an auction.","**When Wealth Buys the Ballot – Elon Musk’s Wisconsin Gambit**

In Wisconsin, a state Supreme Court race set for April 1 has become ground zero for a disturbing experiment in American democracy: the unchecked power of wealth to tilt the scales of justice. **Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, is pouring millions into this election — not just to influence voters, but to buy their participation outright.** His plan? Host an event where he’ll personally hand over two $1 million checks to attendees who’ve voted, calling it “appreciation” for civic duty. This isn’t a one-off stunt; it’s a playbook he tested in Pennsylvania’s presidential race last fall. And **it’s a direct threat to the integrity of our elections.**

Let’s be clear: **this isn’t about encouraging turnout. It’s about leveraging obscene wealth to drown out the voices of everyday Wisconsinites.** Musk has already funneled over $18 million to back conservative candidate Brad Schimel, whose victory could lock in a court friendly to GOP priorities — think abortion bans, gerrymandered maps, and election law rollbacks. Now, **he’s dangling million-dollar carrots to juice turnout for his side, a move that reeks of dystopia.** Imagine a world where billionaires bid for your vote like it’s a Black Friday deal. That’s not democracy; it’s an auction.

**Wisconsin law forbids offering “anything of value” to induce voting.** Musk’s checks might skirt the letter of that statute — rewards after the fact, not promises before — but the spirit is shattered. With early voting still underway, his cash splash is a neon sign to get out and vote, knowing a payday awaits. Legal experts like us see a felony staring back; Wisconsin’s Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler calls it “blatant.” Attorney General Josh Kaul has sued to stop it. Yet even if the courts strike it down, the damage might be done by April 1. Elections don’t wait for gavels.

This isn’t Musk freelancing alone. It’s part of a **broader Republican bet: flood the system with money, bend the rules, and shrug off consequences.** Look at their plans to gut Social Security or Medicaid — wildly unpopular moves they’d never risk if they feared voters could hold them accountable. They’re counting on tactics like Musk’s, paired with election law tweaks, to rig the game before 2026 midterms. **Wisconsin is their test case. If Schimel wins, expect this billionaire playbook to go national.**

Contrast that with a decade ago, when Starbucks faced a right-wing firestorm for offering free coffee to “I Voted” sticker-wearers. They backed off, terrified of crossing a norm. Today, Musk flaunts million-dollar giveaways, and the same crowd cheers. The Overton window hasn’t shifted — it’s been smashed. Democrats, meanwhile, play by yesterday’s rules, litigating after the fact while Republicans reshape the future.

We’re not powerless. **Wisconsin voters can fight back by showing up for Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate who’d keep the court a check on GOP overreach.** If you live there, vote. If you know someone who does, drag them to the polls. This race isn’t just about one seat; it’s about proving democracy can’t be bought. But it starts with us.

Musk’s gambit lays bare a brutal truth: **wealth doesn’t just amplify speech — it can silence everyone else’s.** On April 1, Wisconsin decides if that’s the country we’ll become. Let’s hope the answer is no.

Online dating is new to me, so bear with me. I’m told writing essays online isn’t the way to go, but it’s the only way I know how to communicate something that is so important to me.

My experience with online dating is virtually zilch. I’ve met my previous partners in the real world over the years and always love the old fashioned way of sparking a connection: putting myself out there and being playful. The threat of failure was part of the process, which made it even better when you met someone you truly clicked with.

I’ve recently decided that not finding the right partner that I click with, on a very deep emotional level, is no longer an option. For me that means finding a woman who is nurturing and caring at her core, who has a strong desire or curiosity for lactation and desires the deepest of intimate connections with some intrigue about the concept of breastfeeding their partner. I’m putting myself out there and posting here with the goal of making my own luck. I genuinely believe someone out there is waiting for what I have to offer, and I want to complete them as much as they will complete me. 

Physically, I am 6’1” tall, broad shouldered, carry myself with confidence. Women describe me as tall, dark and handsome, however I’m convinced that women conflate what they think as handsome with their attraction to my assertive, ambitious and dominant nature. Women have told me they feel more feminine and sexual with me and that they see me as the “provider”, Daddy, type.

I’m looking for a needle in a haystack. I want to meet a woman who loves breast and nipple play, and has a strong desire to produce breastmilk and feed their partner. I love everything to do with breasts. Truly. I love breasts, areolas and nipples of all sizes and colour. I can suck and play with them all day if I could. I also have strong hands and give great massages, which can be handy if you’re inducing or attempting to relactate. I have also been told I have a good latch, but know everyone is different, and look forward to figuring out what’s perfect for you.

So here is what I have in mind. Once we exchange a few texts, let’s try to meet for a walk or coffee to feel each other out. From there we can decide the pace that feels natural knowing that at the end of that journey is the potential for a connection with each others mind, body and soul at the deepest level possible.

If anything I’ve mentioned interests you, please send me a DM. Even if you’re slightly curious or nervous, I encourage you to message me.  Life is too short, and I don’t want us both to miss any more chances of meeting each other.

1. The communicated interest is too superficial.

""Hey, I think you're really cute. Could I get your number?""

2. Not assessing her interest level.

""Hey, I was also gonna get that pizza!""  
""Okay....""  
""What do they taste like? I've never tasted one before.""  
""Good, I guess....""  
""Hey, do you want to exchange numbers?""

**I believe the solution is:**

1. Use our brain and think of an interesting topic to talk about in relation to what she's currently doing. ( I know this part is hard, but with practice, we'll be able to come up with something)
2. Assess her response and expression. She must be engaged in the convo and smiling.
3. If #2 goes well, ask whether she would like to go out for coffee sometime, then ask for her number. Otherwise, play it off as a friendly convo, wish her a nice day and leave.

**Final thoughts:**

If we pop the question only after we clearly see she's engaged in the convo and smiling, I believe the risk of a rejection is minimized substantially. Probably only if she's already in a relationship.

End result will probably be a lot of convos that end up just being friendly convos, and a few where you pop the question at the right vibe and they say yes.

*My need: clever but unique ideas for business options (everything from kids play area to leasing it to a call center or hub for a business to a halfway house) 

*The scene: a small rural town in the northern Midwest (South Dakota) our town has two gas stations (with pizza and broasted chicken) a bar (that isn’t doing well at all) a small town grocery store, a coffee shop that opened up a couple years back and has a lil boutique of women’s clothes l, a bank, insurance company, a lil mechanic shop, a hair salon/ reiki place, a small bakery opening up in June,  and within 20 miles we have approx 8-10 other small towns all approx 1000-3000 people. With approx same offerings. 

*The space: I own two storefronts (two whole historical (1902) buildings that got turned into one by putting a hole in the walls since the buildings are 18in apart. These are big brick buildings 12ft ceilings  and two stories.

*We run a small clothing brand and also have renovated it to be our house on the first story. 

**Although we did allocate a 1/6 of the bottom floor (approx 25 x 30ft)  25 ft across which is the glass walled storefront on the one building by 30 ft back.  When we partitioned this area we also built in an extra small room for storage or such (4x8) in this area as well. 

**Now upstairs (the stairs were built between the buildings when they made them one )

There’s a landing that is 6ft x 10ft to the left at the top. That left leads to a 2bedroom apartment that is operable. To the right is a door that leads to a small hall with a door straight ahead that opens up into a room approx 12ft with a extra wide walkway into a room to the right that’s also large and then go right again into a another room 10x 15 and two other small rooms off this. Back also in the small hall there’s a door that leads to the right into one of the previously mentioned rooms. 

*** now back on the landing coming up the stairs There’s a long hall built forward from the stairs all the way to the back where another door exits to the one story roof add on in the back. The upstairs waaaay back use to be apartments. So the hall is split with 4 doorways on the right 4 on the left (the first on the left was turned into a smaller room for laundry area  and to accommodate a bedroom for the operable apartment. 

So I have 3 doorways on the left 4 on the right these ALL have a smaller room when you first walk in with another doorway into the larger room. The smaller rooms are approx 8ft x 15ft 8ft to a doorway straight through and approx 15ft wide. These rooms then lead into a large room approx 15ft x 18ft..

Currently the upstairs has old lathe and some plaster with most intact (which depending on the idea could be redone or just painted. A skylight in one of the rooms on the right.  There’s a little random junk up there but easy to remove. 

*the knowledge- my husband and I have knowledge for construction and have done all renovations ourselves from wall demo or construction. Drywall electric. Plumbing. Etc for any things we want to do- except for an exterior wall that’s 18in from the new neighboring bar we are having stucco removed from the 2nd story as it shoulda never been put on chalkstone and also is separating due to lack of maintenance from previous owners over the years. 

**the community- now I’d love to see something to bring to the area that can attract people, assist people, let people have some form of entertainment, bring jobs, or be able to truly bring something to the local area.  (things are  truly lacking as big town with a Walmart is 35 min away and big town with anything to do for real is Sioux Falls, SD which well could use a lot still. SD is behind comparably. 

**demographic and other details**

Our town is at least 50% born and bread farmers, rodeo, etc midwesterners. 

At least 25% of our community is over 60 years old. 

There’s a lot of random implants as housing prices have skyrocketed. And if you didn’t know SD is definitely on the cheaper end of living. 

Medical marijuana is legal in our state. 

In 10 years as of 2024 there was a 200% increase in Methamphetamine use abuse and arrests. 

The kids around here really have no options for things to do places to go the extras you get with city and burb life.


We had a haunted house that was one of the best around done by a group n volunteers and all donations for entry etc went to something. That did not open its doors last year as volunteers with zero pay are hard to get enough of and the building wasn’t doing so well as well as a change in committee head as the old one left. Revenue went way down the one year. The next it was closed. People travelled from 2hours away for this place. 


Now I’ve probably laid that out in way too much detail I want to tell you the ideas I’ve had that hold any weight in my heart already in case someone has a crazy twist on something. I am open to any and all ideas not based on just the few that made my short list compared to the hundreds I’ve considered. 

***For downstairs— an old school candy place with hard candies gummies in bulk etc. something instagramable for the fun  and then hard ice cream and fresh cotton candy. 

A small cozy unorthodox theater with projector and comfy lounge seating for 30 and popcorn drink and candy concessions playing films released for purchase. 

***For upstairs— a halfway or sober living house (huge shortage) but I would want it unorthodox preferably as I do support use of medical marijuana for ptsd, addiction relief from opiates etc. 

An array of RAGE rooms. 

A haunted house (I know the numbers they made good money at the other one) 

A kid to youth style hang out center

Air bnb suite rooms with bathrooms. Like a hotel kinda possibly themed. (We have a lot of hunters during hunting season and there isn’t a hotel for 35 miles) concerned we wouldn’t do well the rest of the year 


Now my slight concerns are due to older laws at the time and all the buildings on Main Street being wall to wall the right side has no windows for ‘legal bedrooms’ I’m still looking into this in case any ideas need this. 

My other concern comes in with whatever the plan for upstairs is.. as it’s well upstairs. Businesses in cities do this all the time but well that isn’t the case here. 

I’d like something to generate covering the bills in the next 5 years. Current monthly bills approx $2200.00. Core building bills. 

All call to all the intelligent and creative minds for unique ideas.

1jmfi42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1jmfi42/business_ideas_for_this_unique_scene/,Business ideas for this unique scene?,"Okay so I need some unique and collaborative minds to help me out please! 

*My need: clever but unique ideas for business options (everything from kids play area to leasing it to a call center or hub for a business to a halfway house) 

*The scene: a small rural town in the northern Midwest (South Dakota) our town has two gas stations (with pizza and broasted chicken) a bar (that isn’t doing well at all) a small town grocery store, a coffee shop that opened up a couple years back and has a lil boutique of women’s clothes l, a bank, insurance company, a lil mechanic shop, a hair salon/ reiki place, a small bakery opening up in June,  and within 20 miles we have approx 8-10 other small towns all approx 1000-3000 people. With approx same offerings. 

*The space: I own two storefronts (two whole historical (1902) buildings that got turned into one by putting a hole in the walls since the buildings are 18in apart. These are big brick buildings 12ft ceilings  and two stories.

*We run a small clothing brand and also have renovated it to be our house on the first story. 

**Although we did allocate a 1/6 of the bottom floor (approx 25 x 30ft)  25 ft across which is the glass walled storefront on the one building by 30 ft back.  When we partitioned this area we also built in an extra small room for storage or such (4x8) in this area as well. 

**Now upstairs (the stairs were built between the buildings when they made them one )

There’s a landing that is 6ft x 10ft to the left at the top. That left leads to a 2bedroom apartment that is operable. To the right is a door that leads to a small hall with a door straight ahead that opens up into a room approx 12ft with a extra wide walkway into a room to the right that’s also large and then go right again into a another room 10x 15 and two other small rooms off this. Back also in the small hall there’s a door that leads to the right into one of the previously mentioned rooms. 

*** now back on the landing coming up the stairs There’s a long hall built forward from the stairs all the way to the back where another door exits to the one story roof add on in the back. The upstairs waaaay back use to be apartments. So the hall is split with 4 doorways on the right 4 on the left (the first on the left was turned into a smaller room for laundry area  and to accommodate a bedroom for the operable apartment. 

So I have 3 doorways on the left 4 on the right these ALL have a smaller room when you first walk in with another doorway into the larger room. The smaller rooms are approx 8ft x 15ft 8ft to a doorway straight through and approx 15ft wide. These rooms then lead into a large room approx 15ft x 18ft..

Currently the upstairs has old lathe and some plaster with most intact (which depending on the idea could be redone or just painted. A skylight in one of the rooms on the right.  There’s a little random junk up there but easy to remove. 

*the knowledge- my husband and I have knowledge for construction and have done all renovations ourselves from wall demo or construction. Drywall electric. Plumbing. Etc for any things we want to do- except for an exterior wall that’s 18in from the new neighboring bar we are having stucco removed from the 2nd story as it shoulda never been put on chalkstone and also is separating due to lack of maintenance from previous owners over the years. 

**the community- now I’d love to see something to bring to the area that can attract people, assist people, let people have some form of entertainment, bring jobs, or be able to truly bring something to the local area.  (things are  truly lacking as big town with a Walmart is 35 min away and big town with anything to do for real is Sioux Falls, SD which well could use a lot still. SD is behind comparably. 

**demographic and other details**

Our town is at least 50% born and bread farmers, rodeo, etc midwesterners. 

At least 25% of our community is over 60 years old. 

There’s a lot of random implants as housing prices have skyrocketed. And if you didn’t know SD is definitely on the cheaper end of living. 

Medical marijuana is legal in our state. 

In 10 years as of 2024 there was a 200% increase in Methamphetamine use abuse and arrests. 

The kids around here really have no options for things to do places to go the extras you get with city and burb life.


We had a haunted house that was one of the best around done by a group n volunteers and all donations for entry etc went to something. That did not open its doors last year as volunteers with zero pay are hard to get enough of and the building wasn’t doing so well as well as a change in committee head as the old one left. Revenue went way down the one year. The next it was closed. People travelled from 2hours away for this place. 


Now I’ve probably laid that out in way too much detail I want to tell you the ideas I’ve had that hold any weight in my heart already in case someone has a crazy twist on something. I am open to any and all ideas not based on just the few that made my short list compared to the hundreds I’ve considered. 

***For downstairs— an old school candy place with hard candies gummies in bulk etc. something instagramable for the fun  and then hard ice cream and fresh cotton candy. 

A small cozy unorthodox theater with projector and comfy lounge seating for 30 and popcorn drink and candy concessions playing films released for purchase. 

***For upstairs— a halfway or sober living house (huge shortage) but I would want it unorthodox preferably as I do support use of medical marijuana for ptsd, addiction relief from opiates etc. 

An array of RAGE rooms. 

A haunted house (I know the numbers they made good money at the other one) 

A kid to youth style hang out center

Air bnb suite rooms with bathrooms. Like a hotel kinda possibly themed. (We have a lot of hunters during hunting season and there isn’t a hotel for 35 miles) concerned we wouldn’t do well the rest of the year 


Now my slight concerns are due to older laws at the time and all the buildings on Main Street being wall to wall the right side has no windows for ‘legal bedrooms’ I’m still looking into this in case any ideas need this. 

My other concern comes in with whatever the plan for upstairs is.. as it’s well upstairs. Businesses in cities do this all the time but well that isn’t the case here. 

I’d like something to generate covering the bills in the next 5 years. Current monthly bills approx $2200.00. Core building bills. 

All call to all the intelligent and creative minds for unique ideas.

In the morning I toke a 10 mg and an adderall Xr 20mg. I was planning to go to Wisconsin and Chicago for a trip for a few days. Later arriving at the building and meeting my group I was appointed. I excused myself to the bathroom because I started to feel nauseous and dizzy. Heading to the door to the building, I started to panic and started to pull doors. Thankfully someone ringed the door and held the door for me. When getting to the bathroom door , I started to drag my feet and losing consciousness and when I arrived to the bathroom I passed out and hit the sink with my head. I was unsure how long I was passed out but I think for 5-7 mins. When I regained consciousness, all my stuff like my phone was all over the floor.And I just layed on the floor with my head reclining on the wall. Later, a kid about 7 years old came in with a look confusion and froze for a sec before heading in to the stalls. Before he enter I told him sorry because I was laying on the floor. I went in one of the stalls to use the bathroom for like 20 mins. I was sweating and having diarrhea. After 20 mins, I got out and laid on a bench in the lobby. After, being told to go to the nurse and asking staff to just call my mom and leave. I was in my mom’s car and telling her what happened. Later in the day I would throw up the food that I ate like grapes, carrots, and the coffee I drank in the morning. I don’t think I have in plans of taking this medicine soon.

1jmfbys,https://i.redd.it/yjg4srw59kre1.jpeg,JW Marriott Absheron Baku,"If I had to guess I would say the JW Marriott Absheron Baku was built in the late 2000s. It looks and feels like your typical skyscraper-style hotel from 2004-2010. It could be in any big city anywhere in the world. 

For my stay, the JW Marriott was more expensive than the Ritz-Carlton. Around US$240 per night. 

Staff were good to very good, especially the bellmen and the restaurants. Front Desk was so-so. Management are from other countries while guest-facing staff seem to be Azerbaijani. A lot of the staff are 20s or 30s. English is spoken widely with many staff fluent or near-fluent.

At check-in I tried to use my American Express but it kept getting rejected. Visa worked no problem.

No upgrade. Supposedly no suites were available. Quite strangely, every category of rooms and suites were available for booking until 3 days before arrival. Then suddenly the only categories available were entry-level rooms and the multi-room presidential suite that's like US$7,000 per night. There is no way the hotel was sold-out. It felt like a ghost town.

No pre-arrival email.

No turndown service.

Room was well-appointed. No USB outlets anywhere. Plenty of electrical outlets. No adaptors, however. So bring your own. I was a little surprised an international hotel built within the last 15 or so years didn't have USB outlets.

I did get an in-room amenity in keeping with my Ambassador preferences. Also received a handwritten, personally addressed thank you card from the hotel manager.

They have a massive executive lounge (club lounge) on the 5th floor but that was closed, except for coffee and sodas. Breakfast was the full buffet in the 1st floor lobby restaurant. One of the better hotel breakfast buffets that I've seen outside Southeast Asia. Open from 6:30 am to 11 am. Something for everyone, including sugar free donuts and pastries. Front Desk told me the executive lounge when open normally has a ""dinner"" service. I can't speak to what that includes but the buffet in the lounge is big enough that it's probably quite extensive. 

Meysari, one of Azerbaijan's wineries, has a tasting room off the lobby too. The wine they sell was the same wine that was gifted to me as the in-room amenity. By the glass, the Meysari chardonnay at the hotel bars and restaurants is about US$10 per glass. The chardonnay is dry and lightly oaked. Quite drinkable for by the glass. 

On the 2nd floor are (1) OroNero Italian restaurant, (2) a supposed steakhouse that was really just a modern open-kitchen restaurant with steak on the menu at US$200 for a Wagyu filet, (3) an unmanned bar, and (4) what seemed like a night club with hookah smoking. Again, the hotel was supposedly sold-out but I only saw many 4 people eating and drinking at night and maybe a dozen people at breakfast.

Overall, the breakfast buffet is what makes this hotel. Otherwise, the JW Marriott in Baku is entirely forgettable. It's just your generic international business hotel.",2,1743225883.0,marriott,0,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?**

The Celtics are 4-0 ATS in their last 4 straight outings, friends. And while the Spurs have been putting a decent number of points on the board lately, Boston comes to this game with nearly a full squad – Jayson Tatum has been confirmed to play; only Payton Pritchard & Al Horford remain ‘Questionable’. In addition, the Celtics have claimed victory over the Spurs in their last 4 straight meetings and all of them have been by more than 12 points. Sorry San Antonio, but I’m betting on your rested visitors to pull off the cover.

1jmf8z4,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1jmf8z4/togo_trip_report/,Togo- Trip Report,"The main reason I am writing this is because it was hard to find any real good travel guide to Togo specifically. Togo is a beautiful country with great people and more need to experience the culture and beauty. To start, my trip was unique. I was hosted by a friend I made in the USA’s family. Though, they did not speak English, only French and Ewe. Life is different but similar enough to get by there. I know very minimal French but learned enough to be functional. 

To start, 22 year old white male. I primarily only stayed in the south part of Togo. Spending most of my time in Lomé and Kpalimé. I went in February. I had a unique opportunity by having a Togolese friend I met in the US. He helped me rent the apartment upstairs with him and his family staying below. Rent was cheap, for safety reasons I rented for the month, which cost me $500, a bit costly ik but much cheaper than a week long stay anywhere in the US. It was mainly just a place to sleep and revert back to personal time when needed, I primarily stayed with my friend or the family. For 7 days, I lived like a local. Though unique circumstances, I’ve had very similar experiences couch surfing elsewhere. For Lomé I don’t think you would have a problem finding a couchsurfing host. I brought along doxycycline (for malaria) which the antibiotic kinda messed up my stomach. Take a good probiotic with it if you choose to have that prescribed. Additionally doxcycline gave me a bad ulcer because I took it right before bed. Don’t do that. 

I know very minimal French, I speak English and Spanish, but I knew enough French to get by. Most of the employees in the airport knew English. I bought a sim card there for about $8 from Moov Togo, 15 GB and lasted me the entire trip. Learning the basics of French is a must, especially numbers up to 30. I would recommend learning the basics of Ewe, a little bit such as “hello” or “thank you”, or learning the chorus of  Jimi Hope’s song “It’s too late” went a long way in how I was treated. Learning and engaging in the culture is a big compliment in most places I’ve been to. For the most part, people are very friendly, and they love America, especially Trump for some reason. I saw a bunch of American flags on Taxis and a painting of Trump for sale. Some people I talked to know American politics much better than I do. But for the most part, the people and their hospitality is incredible. Most people were indifferent to my skin color but I would have the occasional kid(s) giggle and stare. A lot of people came to me to practice their English. But of course, you still have your hustlers trying to up charge white people and tourists, but that is everywhere. If you can travel with a local who speaks the dialect it will help you out immensely by not getting harrassed. 

I would not recommend renting a car. Driving is hectic here, it’s a very crazy organized chaos that I never manage to understand. Parts of Lomé have traffic lights, which for the most part are obeyed. They actually have a countdown to green which I think is a beautiful idea. Lomé also has traffic police which again, for the most part of obeyed. But I saw motor bikes and cars driving the wrong way on the road, on the sidewalk, and running redlights. For roundabouts, the people coming on have the right away and those in the roundabout must stop. It’s terrifying. I traveled around using Gozem, it’s just like Uber. It’s an app, you can summon a car or a motorbike at any time and have an experienced driver guide you around. Again, I wouldn’t recommend you to drive in this country, especially at night. But if you are, I only saw manual transmission cars, so make sure you can drive that.

Everything is pretty cheap in Togo. The currency is the West African Franc but in this post I will be using dollars for transparency reasons. A nice hotel costs only about $20, you can get AC and hot water with that. Meals only cost $1-$3, beer is good and only costs about $1. I recommend the local beer Castel. The tap water is not safe to drink. Most people drink water out of little bags, but I was told to avoid it due to the quality of it. Instead, I just bought a lot of bottled water, specifically the brand Verna. The food is generally pretty good, my favorites were fufu and adémè. Though, the meat is mostly bones and gristle, locals eat the bone but that was never my style so I never did that. I would personally avoid the street food, it just didn’t seem greatly sanitary. It seems traditional here to have a little bit of whiskey before big meals. They poured it into a shot glass for me, so I shot it back in one big swallow and they looked at me like I did a backflip. Apparently they just sip whiskey here. Nonetheless, people thought it was cool and lined up to try shots with me. It was pretty funny. 

If you plan to visit Lomé, you probably heard of the fetish market. I personally thought it was smelly and unsanitary. It was cool for the most part, I had an English-speaking guide and I bought a voodoo object blessed from a priest there for about $30. I wouldn’t go if you are an animal lover. I saw the heads of horses, cats, dogs, and essentially any other animal you can think of for sale. Lomé is mostly christian and a bit muslim, I didn’t meet anyone to seriously practiced voodoo. 

Definitely recommend Kpalimé. It’s very beautiful, near where the highest peak in the country is, and the locals were very nice. They grow and sell really good coffee there, $5 for a bag. There is a nice waterfall I checked out. It’s the dry season in February so the water was a bit dirty and I was advised not to swim, but others were swimming, some tourist and some locals. 

I also checked out the Mansion de Esclaves in Agbodrafo. A giant house where the captured slaves would wait until transfer to the Americas or Europe. The masters would live in the house, and the slaves in the crawlspace below. They let me go down into the crawlspace, it was a mix of erie and sadness that I will never forget. 

Parts of Togo are very sad, it is still developing after all. Lots of kids, it seems like more than a third of the population is under 15. I saw kids begging, selling whatever, and hustling in whatever way they could. I heard a child nearby getting beat on the other side of a walk. It was sad, but there was nothing I could do about it. I was physically abused myself as a child and it really set me off. 
I didn’t see many people begging, a lot of people were selling though. Phone cases, shoes, shirts, whatever. They don’t sell aggressively, they’ll walk up to you in a restaurant or at a stop light and not say a word; just show you the product. Just don't make eye contact and they will go away. I did see the occasional homeless, though nothing like the United States. The beach had a lot of trash there and I was told to leave before nightfall, as muggings do happen. People burn their trash there as well. I remember seeing people playing soccer with a giant trash pile burning next to the field. 

All in all, the people of West Africa are very hospitablable and smart. Everyone knows two or more languages. Africa is still developing, no one is doing anything wrong here, they were just born here and are doing their best to get by.

Corruption runs in the government, though I read they are cracking down on it more and more. Just make sure you don’t take a picture of any police, military, or government buildings, I’m told they will cease your camera and not give it back. 

I wouldn’t recommend Togo as a solo travel destination, unless you are very experienced in solo travel and know French. It’s not rare to find an English speaker from Ghana or Nigeria but I wouldn’t rely on it. I did see plenty of white people there, mostly from Europe. It was a beautiful experience and I am so glad I went. If you can find a local by having friends or couchsurfing, I would highly recommend traveling to Togo. Beautiful culture here.

This version:

✅ Covers all your dream destinations

✅ Minimizes backtracking

✅ Keeps a good balance of culture, nature, and rest

✅ Has one big travel day (Matagalpa → Estelí → Granada) but smooths everything else out  



**❌ Left Out (or Trimmed)**



**1. San Juan del Sur**

• 🏖️ Beautiful surf/beach town with a party vibe

• **Why it didn’t make it**:

• You’re already getting **beach & chill time** in the **Corn Islands** (and it’s way more remote + unique)

• Time was tight — adding this would require cutting Ometepe or Granada



**2. Laguna de Apoyo (as an overnight)**

• 🌊 Volcanic crater lake near Granada

• **Why it didn’t make it**:

• You’ll likely visit on a **day trip from Granada**, not stay overnight

• Keeps your base stable in Granada and avoids constant packing/unpacking



**3. Pearl Lagoon**

• 🌴 Creole community + Caribbean cays (stunning)

• **Why it didn’t make it**:

• Getting there is much harder — usually requires **a full day of boat/bus travel from Bluefields**, or charter flight

• Since you’re already doing **Corn Islands**, you’ll get a very similar vibe + easier access



**4. Montelimar & El Castillo (Río San Juan)**

• Resorts + river fort, both unique

• **Why they’re out**:

• Too far out of the main route

i do my best to help him feel supported while going to work and school full time. i wake up at 4 am with him to make coffee, i try to make sure he has lunches packed, the whole works. yet it’s like pulling teeth to try and get more than an “i love you” or “thank you” out him. i guess just the lack of thoughtfulness has been getting to me, and i never ask for something that takes much.

this does make me feel selfish to want more from him when he’s already drained enough from work, but is it ? like is it just impossible to be present in a relationship and be a team chief? every time i bring it up, nothing gets resolved. today i brought up that i don’t feel secure in our relationship and i just want to feel heard. that i understand he’s going through a lot with work and how he doesn’t have much time out of work and i just wanted to communicate how ive been feeling. and he said something along the lines of “yeah that’s what happens when you’re preparing 18-22 year old kids to go to war and make sure they come home.” 

that put it into perspective for me, yet i feel like completely looked over. idk at this point, does anyone have advice on how to navigate this? i do keep myself busy so its not the lack of time, but rather the lack of substance. feel free to ask any questions or for clarification as well.",1,1743225089.0,USMilitarySO,6,1.0,False

But now? I might be the last line of defense between this company and complete financial chaos.

Last week, our Head of FP&A quit after the CEO refused to make him CFO. The guy saved the company $130k, renegotiated contracts, and even reclaimed tax refunds, but apparently, that wasn’t enough. The CEO basically saw him as the guy who canceled coffee and turned off the heat at 3 PM.

So, my boss (the Financial Analyst) just inherited ALL his responsibilities… without a promotion. Or a raise. He’s now in charge of things like tax filings, vendor negotiations, payroll oversight, and “finding more money in places we forgot about” (actual CEO quote). My boss has been here for eight months. He has a marketing degree. I think he might be in shock.

And me? I’m just the intern. But suddenly, my boss keeps saying things like, *“Hey, can you double-check this cash flow report?”* and *“Remind me how to do a VLOOKUP again?”* and *“If I quit, you could technically be the most senior finance person here.”*

I laughed. Then I realized he wasn’t joking.

Payroll is due next week. People are asking about budgets. The CEO keeps looking at me like I should be doing something important. I just wanted to learn Excel.

1jmetoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_KaleidoscopeAnthem/comments/1jmetoo/holy_water/,Holy Water,"Kat had spent her entire life defying expectations. As the eldest daughter of a well-respected Christian family, she was supposed to be poised, virtuous, and soft spoken. Instead, she rode motorcycles, had more tattoos and piercings than you could count, and kissed strangers in the moonlight just to feel alive. Her family was proud when she graduated, with honors, completing her master's degree in therapy. They all but disowned her when she told them how she would be using her degree. So, it was no surprise that she’d left behind the suffocating world of Southern high society for something quieter, something real.

A year ago, she packed up her life and moved to a small town in Washington state, right in the shadow of Mount Rainier, where she opened a discreet but thriving practice as a sex therapist. For her the quiet, rugged beauty of the Pacific Northwest wasn't just about reinvention—it was about freedom.

Her practice was fulfilling, but heavy. People brought her their deepest fears and longings, their aching wounds, their silent shame. She needed something lighter, something simpler. So, three days a week, she worked the morning shift at Wild Pines Coffee, a small shop just off the main road.

That was where she met River.

He came in every morning like clockwork—black coffee, no sugar, nod of acknowledgment, and a lingering glance that made her pulse skip. He was all rough edges and quiet strength, the kind of man who carried the weight of his past in his eyes but never spoke of it. At first, he barely spoke more than a few words. Just a deep, gravelly “Thanks, Kat” before settling into his usual corner by the window, a well-worn leather notebook in hand.

Then one morning, he lingered at the counter.

""You're a therapist, right?"" he asked, voice careful.

Kat arched a brow. ""If this is a roundabout way of asking for free advice, at least buy a pastry first.""

His lips twitched. ""Not therapy. Just... another pair of eyes.""

That’s how it started.

River would come in a little earlier each morning, sliding a few handwritten pages across the counter with his coffee. A novel, he told her—one he’d been working on for years but never let anyone read. It was rough, raw, but achingly beautiful—like him.

Kat told herself it was nothing, just easy conversation over caffeine and ink-stained pages. But then she started slipping a warm muffin into his bag when he wasn’t looking, making sure he had breakfast because she could tell he’d never take it if she offered outright. She tried not to read into the way he ran a hand through his graying hair when she complimented his writing. Or the way his stormy blue eyes started watching her instead of the words when she read aloud a passage that moved her. And then one evening, he showed up at her doorstep with a loaf of homemade bread wrapped in a kitchen towel.

“I bake when I can’t sleep,” he admitted, looking almost sheepish.

Kat traced her fingers over the still-warm loaf, inhaling the scent of rosemary and sea salt. “River, this is—”

“A thank you,” he interrupted. “For reading my pages. For... being a breath of fresh air.” He hesitated, then exhaled. “One I didn’t know I needed.”

That was the moment Kat knew. She was falling. Falling for his quiet intensity, his hesitant kindness. For the way he softened around her in ways she didn’t think he even noticed. For the way he made her feel steady when she had spent her whole life running.

The next morning at the coffee shop, Kat invited him over for dinner.

She planned the menu carefully—rosemary chicken with a side of garlic butter green beans, a simple salad, and slices of his homemade bread, toasted and brushed with olive oil.

When River arrived, he seemed almost hesitant, standing in her doorway like he wasn’t sure if he belonged. But as the evening unfolded, something shifted. He relaxed as they moved around her kitchen together—Kat plating their meal, River pouring them each a glass of wine.

""You're using the bread,"" he observed, watching as she plated the warm, golden slices.

""Of course I am,"" Kat said, meeting his gaze. ""It's too good not to.""

Dinner stretched into hours, conversation winding effortlessly between sips of wine and flickers of glances that lingered too long. They talked about everything—his novel, her practice, the ghosts they had each left behind, and the strange comfort they’d found in this little town neither had planned to call home.

When the plates were empty and the wine glasses half-full, the air between them grew thick with the kind of silence that buzzes with anticipation.

River reached across the table, brushing a loose strand of hair from Kat’s face, his fingers barely grazing her cheek. She stilled, breath catching, heat blooming low and deep, an ache that had been building all evening.

“I should have brought you flowers,” he said.

“You brought me bread,” she replied and dabbed her lips with her napkin one final time.

“I should go,” he murmured, voice rough and laced with something hesitant. But he didn’t move.

Kat leaned in slightly, her lips curving. “You could stay. Just a little longer.”

She stood, slow and certain, her bare feet whispering against the hardwood. She reached for him, fingers curling around the front of his shirt, and when she kissed him, it was not tentative—it was soft, yes, but there was fire underneath. A pull. A dare.

River responded like he’d been waiting for this—for her—for far too long.

His hands found her waist, firm and hungry, pulling her close, molding her against him until there was nothing but heat between them. The kiss deepened, turned hungrier. When they finally parted, gasping, foreheads pressed together, he whispered, “Kat…”

She smiled, her voice low and wicked-sweet. “Stay.”

He did.

—

The warmth of the evening still clung to the air as they stepped into her bedroom, the scent of rosemary and wine trailing behind them, layered now with something heavier—desire thick and undeniable.

Kat stood before him in the soft glow of the bedside lamp, her eyes dark and steady as she reached for him again. Her hands moved with practiced intention, slowly unbuttoning his shirt, one button at a time. Each release revealed more of the hard, sculpted planes of his chest, and River’s breath hitched the lower she went.

When her fingers skimmed over his stomach, he caught her wrists, gentle but firm.

“Kat,” he said, voice hoarse. Needing her to know. Needing to be sure.

“I know,” she whispered, stepping closer, brushing her lips along his jaw. Her breath was hot against his skin. “You don’t have to be careful with me.”

But he wanted to be—and not in the way she meant. He wanted to worship her, to take his time and burn her into memory.

He kissed her again, slower now, deeper—his hands sliding under her shirt, pulling it over her head in one smooth, reverent motion. Her bare skin shimmered in the low light, soft and flushed and begging to be touched.

“God,” he whispered, his hands framing her waist, his mouth finding the curve of her shoulder, her throat, her collarbone. “You’re killing me.”

“Good,” she breathed, tilting her head back, offering more.

His mouth trailed down her body, leaving behind a map of heat, his tongue flicking lightly against her skin as she moaned, quiet and breathy, her hands in his hair, urging him on. He peeled away the rest of her clothes like he was unwrapping something sacred, until she stood before him, bared and bold and utterly unashamed.

And then it was his turn. She pushed the shirt from his shoulders, then the rest—leaving nothing between them but the kind of silence that speaks in shivers and stares.

River laid her down against the sheets, sliding over her, his body fitting against hers like he had always been meant to belong there. Their mouths met again, more desperate now, more open, teeth and tongue and need, and when he finally entered her, it was with a low, guttural sound torn from deep in his chest.

Kat gasped, her nails biting into his back, legs tightening around his waist. “River…”

He moved slowly, deliberately, like every thrust was a declaration, every touch a vow.

You matter. You are wanted. I am not going anywhere.

The world narrowed to the sound of their bodies moving in sync, skin against skin, soft cries and muffled moans, and the firelight flickering over sweat-slicked skin. He made love to her like he was trying to undo every wound she’d ever buried, like he could heal her with every stroke, every kiss, every whispered word pressed against her skin.

When they finally came—together, shaking, tangled, and breathless—it was less release and more surrender. A shattering kind of closeness that neither of them had known they’d been starving for.

—

Afterward, River lay behind her, his hand splayed across her stomach, holding her close. Kat reached back, fingers tangling with his, her chest still rising and falling, slower now, but her heart still racing. She had never been held like this. Never been touched like this. And she had never wanted anyone to stay like she wanted River to stay.

She turned, brushing a kiss to his temple, her lips barely touching his skin. “That was…”

He let out a low, sleepy rumble. “Yeah.”

Kat smiled, her body sore in the best ways, her soul cracked open. She rested her head against his chest, his heartbeat steady beneath her ear.

Sleep took them, wrapped in each other, the scent of rain and skin and something new beginning.

\---------------

The early morning light crept in through the blinds, painting soft golden stripes across Kat’s bedroom. She lay there for a moment, tangled in the sheets, tangled in him, listening to the slow, steady rhythm of River’s breath beside her.

She smiled.

Carefully, she slipped out of bed, moving with practiced ease, not wanting to wake him—not yet. Not when she could spare him the chance to second-guess staying. She knew River well enough to see the hesitation in his eyes last night, the way he had almost pulled away when reality crept in. Not because he didn’t want this, but because he wasn’t used to letting himself want like this.

So she let him sleep. Kat pulled on his discarded button-down from the night before, the fabric soft and smelling like him, and padded barefoot to the kitchen.

The smell of coffee drifted through the small kitchen, rich and warm, mingling with the soft sizzle of butter in the skillet. Rain tapped lazily at the windows, the early morning sky still dusky and gray.

Kat stood at the stove, barefoot, wearing nothing but River’s shirt—too big on her, sliding off one shoulder, hem brushing dangerously high across her thighs. The top few buttons were undone, leaving just a whisper of cleavage exposed, enough to distract anyone within a ten-foot radius.

River was *definitely* within that radius.

He leaned against the doorway, arms crossed, wearing her robe, the sash barely tied, and nothing—clearly nothing—underneath. His hair was tousled, lips kiss-swollen, and his eyes were fixed on her like he was still trying to decide if she was real or a very, very good dream.

“You left,” he grumbled, his voice thick.

“I made breakfast,” she Kat stated but didn’t turn around. “*And,* you’re staring,” she said, smug.

“You’re cooking in my shirt with no pants,” River replied, his voice low and rough, like it had just crawled out of bed and didn’t mind going right back in. “I’d be a damn fool not to.”

She flipped a slice of bread in the pan, smiling to herself. “Well, you’re wearing my robe, so I guess we’re even.”

River pushed off the wall and stalked toward her, slowly, deliberately, until his chest brushed her back. She could feel the heat of him through the thin cotton. He leaned in close, his mouth grazing her ear.

“You’re not wearing anything under that shirt, are you?”

Kat didn’t answer—just hummed, slow and sultry.

His hands slid around her waist, fingers finding the buttons. “Are you trying to kill me?”

“Maybe,” she whispered, leaning her head back against his shoulder as he undid one button, then another, the curve of her breast just visible. “Wouldn’t be a bad way to go.”

River chuckled, but it was low and dark and *hungry*. “Come here.”

Before she could react, he spun her gently, lifting her onto the kitchen counter with deliberate strength. The heat from the stove was nothing compared to the heat in his eyes as he stepped between her thighs, his hands spreading over her bare legs. His robe had parted slightly, brushing against her skin in a teasing promise.

“You’re dangerous like this,” he murmured, sliding his palms up her thighs. “All warm and soft and smug, thinking I wouldn’t touch you because it’s morning.”

Kat grinned, wrapping her arms around his neck. “You’re the one who couldn’t stay away.”

He kissed her hard then—hungry, claiming, a little desperate—like he’d been holding back all night and now there was no reason to anymore. Her legs locked around his hips, tugging him closer, and she gasped when she felt just how *not* dressed he really was under that robe.

The skillet hissed behind them, forgotten.

She broke the kiss, breathless, lips kiss-bitten and swollen. “We’re going to burn breakfast.”

River’s voice was a growl against her throat. “I’d rather burn the whole damn house down than stop right now.”

Kat pulled him back to her, hands sliding under the robe, voice husky against his mouth. “Then put the fire out, River.”

He reached back and moved the skillet from the heat while he sank into hers.

\---------------

That evening the fire crackled low in the hearth, casting flickering shadows against the wooden walls of Kat’s cabin. Outside, the Washington rain drummed steadily on the roof, a gentle rhythm that should’ve lulled them into quiet, contented rest. But tonight, the storm outside had nothing on the storm between them.

Neither of them could sleep.

Kat lay on her back, the sheets tangled around her legs, her skin still flushed from the way he had touched her—slow, aching, thorough. River propped on one elbow beside her, shirtless, sweat-slicked, his chest rising and falling, one hand tracing slow, reverent circles along the bare curve of her shoulder, then down to her collarbone.

His touch wasn’t idle. It was intentional, like he was still memorizing every inch of her, still convincing himself she was real—and his. She turned her head to look at him, heart skipping at the way he looked at her—like she was something holy and sinful all at once. Like he couldn’t decide whether to worship her or ruin her all over again.

""You're staring,"" she whispered, her voice rough from moaning his name into the pillow less than an hour ago.

River let out a low, gravelly chuckle. ""Yeah.""

Kat reached up, fingers combing through his damp, graying hair. Her nails grazed his scalp lightly, drawing a soft sound from him. “What are you thinking about?”

His hand slid lower, fingertips brushing the underside of her breast before trailing down her stomach, his touch a whisper of fire. “How I ever did this before you,” he said, voice ragged. His gaze moved with his hand, following the path like he wanted to leave a mark.

Kat’s breath caught as his fingers ghosted over the crease of her hip. She swallowed hard. “Did what?”

“Lived,” he murmured, pressing his palm flat to her stomach. “Slept. Breathed.” His voice dropped even lower. “Felt.”

The words sank into her, hot and weighty. She had wanted plenty in her life—lusted, even loved—but this? This aching pull toward someone else’s gravity?

This was different. She needed him. And the need was dangerous.

“You’re such a poet,” she said, trying for a smirk, but her voice shook. Her fingers traced the edge of his mouth, soft, trembling.

River caught her wrist, turned it gently, and pressed a kiss to her palm. Then to the inside of her wrist. Then to the crook of her elbow. Each kiss slower, lower, hungrier.

“I mean it, Kat.” He looked up at her, eyes dark and dilated. “I’ve never wanted someone like this.”

She pulled him down, threading her fingers through his hair, lips crashing into his with a heat that surprised them both. The kiss was deep and dizzying, all tongue and teeth and need.

River groaned into her mouth as she arched up into him, wrapping her legs around his waist. He was already hard again, pressed against her thigh, the heat between them building with every breathless second.

“Again?” she breathed against his lips, smiling at the hungry look in his eyes.

“I’m not done with you,” he rasped, voice dark and full of promise. “Not even close.”

And when he moved over her, kissed her like he meant every raw word he’d said—Kat knew this wasn’t just lust.

It was want, yes. Craving, yes. But it was also the beginning of something feral and tender and *unrelenting*.

Something that she would never be able to walk away from.

And in that fire-warmed cabin, wrapped in sheets and shadow and each other, they gave in again.

1jmeq06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1jmeq06/it_wasnt_bad_at_all/,it wasn’t bad at all,"I’d like to start by saying that I [21F] have been browsing this subreddit before I had my surgery, during, and now after- and this sort of exposure did a bit more harm than good. 

I have taken advantage of all the tips and tricks you guys have mentioned in here, but I also took special attention to how 90% of people on here described the pain as the worst pain of their lives, describing it as stabby and sharp, and how it gets worse around a week post-op. This TERRIFIED me, I was anticipating the pain every second of every day and it had me in a constant cycle of stress- but I’m here to tell yall.. it wasn’t bad at all.

I got kidney stones around two years ago, and had a gastric bypass surgery done and both of these were insanely painful and all the meds they gave me didn’t do much to help with the pain so I knew since then that I’m very highly sensitive to pain and would need strong narcotics to deal with this issue. This’s the first thing I asked my surgeon to provide and mentioned this subreddit, he said that I’ll be on Diludid which’s the liquid form of hydromorphone (?). 

Day 0 (March 5th)
Surgery day, I was SO close to just cancelling the whole surgery before going under because of the pure fear of pain but I didn’t. I woke up post-op and had really bad pain and dryness but I was half awake and still kinda sedated, the nurse immediately asked how bad the pain is in which I said “7/10” and she immediately injected some morphine via IV- took what felt like five minutes to completely erase the pain and I went back to sleep. This whole day I was basically sleeping and not really aware of what’s going on so the pain wasn’t there per say. 

Day 1
I stayed on top of my medication schedule, taking a bunch of things every four hours all day which was sorta annoying but I knew I had to stick w it. I tried to drink water to the best of my abilities, it wasn’t painful it was just so weird.. one thing I started doing is keeping a humidifier on in my room 24/7 and also sleep at a 90-120° angle but NEVER on my back 
 - pain 4/10

Day 2
Felt almost identical to day one but I had a bit more energy as sedation started to wear off, I was able to study a little bit and tried vegan Mac n cheese which was disgusting lol
 - pain 4/10

Day 3 
I spent that day just sleeping, I even missed taking my meds and drinking water but the pain never got worse than a 5 at times 

Day 4 
Some people reported day 4 as the day when their pain peaked, that wasn’t the case for me. I tried to drink water to make up for the lack of it from the day before, my throat felt just weird.. like really.. wide? And my breath def gave rotten even tho I brush normally day and night since day 0

Day 5 
I started question when’s the pain gonna start at this point, I’m only taking Tylenol and saving up my strong medications for the scary days. The pain is not even a 3 at this point but this’s what I’m supposed to expect according to this subreddit so I didn’t get my hopes high or anything. 

- pain 3/10

Day 6 
I was absolutely terrified since this’s THE infamous day it seems like. I was expecting insane burning pain any moment and trying to keep drinking water and staying next to an emisis bag at all times but.. nothing happened. I woke up once at around 6am with pain that radiated to my ears and it was def a 6 or 7 out of 10, I took my Diludid and immediately went to bed, it didn’t stop me from sleeping so the whole thing lasted like 10 mins lol
 - pain: 5/10?

Day 7
An official week! I was told not to get ahead of myself at that point as well, but I’ve decided to try more food like sweet potatoes and some bread and it didn’t kill me! Was glad to find out that I can finally eat (more info on this later) and I had some energy that day but didn’t want to get too excited just yet 
 - pain: 2/10

Day 8 and 9
Went back to work and uni, I was actually fasting for both of these days (Ramadan) so I hadn’t had the chance to eat nor drink for most of the day which def made my throat feel disgusting but not painful, I was able to fast easily despite being so tired 
- pain: 2/10

Day 10 
My first emergency responder shift post-op which is usually 6+ hours, I also managed to fast during the whole thing and also study a bit. After that shift I just took the hugest nap ever because I was so exhausted 
 - pain: 2/10

Day 11 
Oh I had tiramisu that day because I thought the chocolate would burn my throat before but it def didn’t, felt SO heavenly. Had yet another EMR shift that didn’t go too bad 
 - pain 2/10

Day 12,13, and 14
At this point I’m back to normal, my throat still felt disgusting but there was basically no pain other than a slight sore throat and my voice sounding weird lol


Things I did that you definitely should NOT do but it still didn’t worsen my experience somehow:

1- I didn’t eat anything for two weeks. I would have one bite of something every like 2-3 days and live on that basically. This’s mostly because I didn’t like the weird texture of the food I was advised to eat nor did I like how my throat felt when eating. I guess this’s why I didn’t feel my scabs falling off since there was no food to forcibly push or move them off (?)

2- I didn’t drink water for like days sometimes.. I have ADHD and I would forget to drink water which’s not great, I would try to make up for it the next day but it def got me feeling so dehydrated 

3- I skipped half of my medication and also went back to work and school semi early

Things I did that you should definitely do:

1- HUMIDIFIER at all times.. life saving.

2- don’t sleep on your back for two weeks, sleep at an 90-120° degree angle, this helps with the inflammation and your breathing too

3- cough candy (idk what it’s actually called) is AMAZING for your dry throat and they somehow don’t burn at all 

4- brush your teeth like you normally would from day one! Your mouth will get so nasty, especially your tongue and it’s gonna be hard to manage that but brushing helps a lot 


Today marks day 24 I think? Post-op and I can easily eat chips, drink coffee and carbonated drinks, haven’t tried spicy food yet but so far I haven’t had anything that burnt my throat or felt painful :)",1,1743223499.0,Tonsillectomy,0,1.0,False

1jmeoqw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jmeoqw,Making liquid culture medium vs. straight LC,"There are a lot of benefits from using a medium versus pure liquid and water soluble contents for your ""Liquid culture"" this is a liquid medium. 

What I'm using here is sterile water for a CPAP with a neutral PH level. 

First add your water to your jar of choice you're using.

Next I add in 6-8 yellow corn kernels to a good food processor or blender of your choice. 

Next I add chicken manure pellets, for this size about 4-6 pellets.

Add 10mls of gypsum.

Add 10 to 15mls of Erythritol. 

Add 6 full coffee beans. (I use dark French roast)

Finally at in 20mls of light Karo corn syrup. 

Blend until it's as fine as it can get. 

**Next add in your water into the food processor and blend away. (Distilled water is perfectly fine, spring water works as well but I recommend sterile CPAP water)**

Blend it into a beautiful oblivion. 

**Pour it into your jar. (In this case I used a pint plastic organic peanut butter container with a 3/8 and 1/4 inch holes for inoculation and the 3/8 for gas exchange.)**

If you're using plastic make sure it's at least grade 3 and cover the holes with polypore or micropore tape and wrap the entire jar in tin foil. 

Place in your PC for 20-30 minutes depending on your elevation.

Wait for it the PC to cool down naturally. 

**Viola you have made a super charged mushroom medium for liquid culture**

**If you're using a magnetic stirrer put your magnet in prior to PC, with this recipe you do not have to have a magnetic stirrer just swirl manually gently daily.**


**You've successfully made a mushroom medium. They're far superior to liquid culture IMO and you use what you use in your bulk substrate and spawn. So if you use rye, substitute the corn for rye or millet etc. and adjust accordingly to your liking**

Any questions send them my way.

I brush this thought off quickly, remembering that it doesn't matter anyways, I still have to change the garbages. The ones next to the gas pumps usually have dumped ashtray remnants and discarded piss bottles and takeout bags from mcdonald's or dave's hot chicken. As I am pulling out the garbage bag, a woman emerges from her car with two bottles in hand, she says ""can I throw this in there?"" I feel like I am the garbage bag sometimes. I clean up after these people. Pick up their used napkins and straw papers when they leave them on the table. Wipe their shit from the toilet seat (no seriously). I smile and laugh at the jokes I don't think are funny. Honestly that is the worst part to me. Talking to them and interacting feels like peeling my skin back. It feels like raw meat on a platter. I give myself to them, my vulnerability, insecurities. I try to make them happy. 

Frowns and single word sentences from old men I regret trying to be kind to. 

I am taking the inside garbages under the counters and I see a red faced boy, maybe 18. I don't know, he looks young. He looks high. He comes over and leans against the counter and asks me how I am. I don't feel the need to lie to him, he is clearly out of it anyways. ""Well, I'm... As good as I can be,"" I say with a smile. He says ""you're smart."" I'm not sure what makes him say that. Maybe the glasses I am wearing, but who knows, he is somewhere else right now. I laugh and tell him ""that's why I work here."" He starts mumbling about something else as he fixes his coffee, and it almost seems like he should be talking on the phone, the way he is talking out but at no one here. Maybe he is still talking to me, but I don't know what he is saying. I bend down to get the next garbage. I am caught off guard when he bends down too, facing me. His eyes look strangely sad, or afraid, and I notice how sweaty he looks now. ""Are you okay?"" ""What? Yeahh."" He doesn't seem to get why I would ask that. 

""I just got out of jail."" 

Customer service alter ego formulates my response because regular me doesn't know what the fuck to say to that. ""I'm sorry to hear that.""

I recently had what I can best describe as a false awakening. Is this common and from you experiences, how likely is it to have a spontaneous AP event from something like this?

I woke up from sleep, went to the bathroom and came back to bed.

My fiance and I cuddled for a while and he got up to get our son ready for school. 

I went back to lay down on my left side, after a while my fiance came back in asking if I wanted coffee, then came back shortly after to let me know if was ready and make sure I wasn't still asleep.

I say up, intending to sit on the end of the bed and clothe myself but I felt an intense desire to lay back on the bed, legs touching the floor.

From there I felt huge waves of energy and started hearing a whirring sound, I knew what was coming next if I continued but I needed to get up and help get our child ready for school and told myself ""not right now, we need to go"".

When I opened my eyes I wasn't laying as I perceived, but on my left side in my normal sleeping position. 

I asked my fiance and he didn't come back in the 2nd time so this was part of a dream I would imagine.",1,1743223186.0,AstralProjection,1,1.0,False

For some context:

Right now, I'm in my third year of a physics degree and I'm thinking of applying for a master or PhD outside. Where I live (LATAM), there aren't many opportunities to research and participate in research groups, since physics isn't very relevant here in my country. We don't even have a dedicated physics lab at my university, so it's somewhat difficult to gain research experience.

The thing is, a call was put out to go to another country with a project on the study of a highly acclaimed type of coffee produced here. Several professors are participating, and they've included physics students for the spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and other aspects. I decided to participate because it was a chance to gain experience as a researcher, but what they didn't say is that the students who attend (if they win the call) must write a thesis on the subject they're going to research, or at least something related to it (so that the proposal carries more weight, for some reason). I honestly don't know yet if I want to write my thesis on that topic.

Lately I've been quite interested in materials physics, statistical and quantum physics for my thesis, which would be largely theoretical (topics in which I would like to continue with a master's or PhD), but I feel that if I do not participate in this I may miss out on a great opportunity, where I could travel to another country, obtain very good training in equipment and experimental techniques, etc.

I'm doing all this to develop skills, gain experience and hopefully publish something so I can maximize my chances for an acceptance when I apply for a graduate degree.

1jmek1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jmek1w/dating_advice_i_wish_i_had_revived_sooner/,Dating advice I wish I had revived sooner,"
Sharing my experiences in modern dating—especially app-based dating—along with advice I wish I had at a younger age. Hope it resonates!

1. Keep Dates Short

First dates don’t need to be 4-8 hours long. I aim for 1-2 hours max—coffee, a drink, or a short walk. Within 20 minutes, you usually know if there’s chemistry or not, if you want to see them again or not. If things flow naturally, stay longer. But don’t waste your time on people who don’t respect you when you could be with loved ones instead. Socially in the 9-5 economy, we already have e little time to enjoy ourselves why waste on people who can ghost you next day?

2. Stop Explaining Yourself

If someone ghosts or disrespects you, don’t send long messages explaining how they hurt you. They know—they just don’t care. Again: they DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS. Walk away. Don’t expose yourself and  let them know the harm they caused you, some people  even like that so… Block or unfollow, but close the door!  

3. 50/50 Means Everything

If you are  50/50 kind of person on bills learn that: effort should be equal too—planning dates, emotional support/responsibility and active listening. Don’t settle for someone who expects you to do all the work but thinks that paying 50% of the bill makes it ok for the lack of effort. 

4. No Means No

If you say “no” and they keep pushing, leave. Or you set a boundary and they cross it, LEAVE. Someone who doesn’t respect a clear boundary is not safe they don’t like you or care about you. 

5. Learn to Leave

You don’t have to stay. If a date feels wrong or you don’t want to be there anymore—politely excuse yourself and go. Learn polite words/phrases for rejection, and learn how to respect your boundaries. 

6. Are They Really Listening?

Active listening is key. If they keep repeating questions like “Where do you work?” or forget things you told them minutes ago, they’re not paying attention. How can they like you if they don’t even hear you? I even go beyond, on second or their date I’ll make reference to a story or personal detail I already told them, if they hear it as it’s the first time hearing it, on well. 

Exemple, first date, they ask me if I have a brother and I say “yes”, second date I’ll tell them a story about my brother. If they ask me “oh you have a brother?” That’s a big no for me. Or if they ask me the same personal question many times in the same date…. 

6a. Watch for Red & Green Flags
	•	Do they complain a lot?
	•	How do they treat staff?
	•	Are they making an effort to keep the conversation going?
	•	Do they interrupt me to talk about themselves?

7. Don’t Talk About Exes

Avoid ex-talk, especially in the first months. If they bring it up a lot, that’s a red flag. If they do bring it notice how they talk about it, the words to describe their exes are important. “my ex is crazy” oh well, run! 

8. Match Their Energy—or Leave

If someone was warm and interested but suddenly becomes distant and acting different, don’t chase them. No long messages, no asking for explanations. Just move on, they are not for you. You must accept the reality of who they are, even tho they showed you other side of themselves that now you miss it, you either match their energy or leave.

9. Do You Like Them—or Just Want to Be Liked?

Feeling obsessed with someone too fast? That could be limerence (look it up!). Or you want to be liked by them! You can’t truly like someone you barely know. Ask that “I really like them or I want them to like me?” If you think you like someone, try to write it down the reasons you believe you like them and read it, you’ll be surprised to find almost nothing to say or how basic the things can be. Once I wrote it down “I like him because he treats me well” and I was like “wait a minuet isn’t that the minimum?” 

10. Date Slowly

Take your time getting to know someone. One date per week—or even every 10 days—helps prevent rushing into something that isn’t real and creating false expectations. Letting people in into your life too fast can cause more harm than good. 

11. Listen to Your Body

Do you feel anxious (bad anxiety) before meeting them? Mentally, emotionally/ physically drained  after the date? Sometimes we “like” people who aren’t actually good for us. Trust your gut and leave. 

Do you feel you can be yourself with them? If so it’s a good sign, if not super red flag. 

They correct you in any way or say things like “don’t do this or don’t say that”? If so… 🚩🚩🚩🚩

12. Are You Actually Having Fun? 

I’m a very social person  and can carry a conversation with anyone so I like to ask myself after the first date : “Did I have fun, or was I the fun?” If you’re always the one carrying the conversation, step back and see if they put in effort too. Silence can be revealing. If you are in the other side of the spectrum, try to engage with what they are saying, don’t let them carry the conversation. 

Besides think about how did you felt during the date. Did you felt like it was worthy to leave home? Did you really had a good time and felt like a burden sometimes ? 

13. Silence
different from ghosting—can be far more powerful and healing than exhausting and endless conversations with someone who has already shown they don’t care or listen. Save your explanations, boundaries, and feelings for someone who truly values them. 


14. You’re not their therapist!
You just met a person, you are not their therapist, you’re not going to change them. If they use excuses as  “I have ADHD, anxiety, I was cheat it on before and etc ” to justify behaviour problems and do not get medicated or do therapy, do not settle . LEAVE

People who are aware of their mental symptoms/issues and do nothing about it are no good to you. Repeat after me: they won’t change for you! You won’t change them, Because people only change for themselves and not to please others people. 

————————————————————————
Don’t chase after people who don’t 
want you! WRITE YOUR BOUNDARIES DOWN AND LEARN WITH MISTAKES.  

If you have something to add, please share it too!

1jmej5s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jmej5s,Sandals Curacao Review from Sandals and Curacao first timers,"After reading many reviews I wanted to share our review being a first time Sandals visitor and first time Curacao visitor. The posts recommending a car are spot on, especially if you were like us and love snorkeling and exploring the island and beaches. We did through Bo's Car rental and they were great. You can park in the employee manager lot right off the rooms. They met us at the resort and we returned at the airport. We had an SUV but recommend a smaller car for the roads as they are narrow! 

We did a couple of the complimentary snorkel boat tours that they offer but we did not have the best experience probably because the boat went very fast and the water was really choppy and windy which kicked up the strong fuel smell. It only took us to Tug Boat both times but glad we saw it though a little weird to snorkel next to the remnants of an oil rig. For those that are beach and snorkel people you definitely will want a car. The roundabouts and traffic can be daunting at first, but you get used to it. Just look up what the road signs are. Youtube videos others made was great for showing us where the best snorkel beaches were but all were about 45 minutes away. 

We were able to get into both reservation restaurants, Butch's and Vincent's and both were good. We hit all the restaurants and were good to sample, and the only one we would pass on is the buffet except to get some fresh fruit and smoothies. The breakfast was better at Butch's.  We don’t really drink alcohol so this is where the free drinks may be lost on us but they made us great mocktails everytime we asked. I’ve heard mixed things about tipping - a handful of times we did tip people in cash when they went above and beyond and people were grateful. Food at the food trucks was just okay but painfully slow. The coffee bar is usually just one person making coffee and crepes but It was nice to have fancy coffee options. 

Club level room was fine - they showed us to our room upon arrival which was nice. When we asked to inquire about staying an extra night when we knew they had rooms, no one ever got back to us. Since we needed no alcohol in our fridge they did stock with lots of water and sodas. It was nice that they had room service for club level (one pic is of the baked Mac and cheese dish) And maybe it’s just me but it seemed like everyone there brought their own giant Stanley or Yeti cup 😂 Thought it odd that I mentioned it was our 20th wedding anniversary when they asked when we booked why coming - no mention or anything when we checked in and we did not get flowers on our bed like another anniversary couple we met but didn’t really bother us. The furniture in the room was a little weird. Those little chairs in front of the bed were hollow and light and fell over all the time so we just moved them out of the way. The usb outlets to charge devices on the lamps did not work. AC worked great but since it’s a warm climate it does feel damp at times. We did use the soaking tub but to wash our snorkel gear 😎

WiFi was so so - if you need to be dialed in suggest getting a SIM card at the airport. Even though AT&T had roaming it kept saying 3G which felt like dial up. Our other phone on Tmobile was no better. Where our room was it had bad signal so when I needed to work or download sight seeing directions, I went to the lobby but some spots around the resort had stronger WiFi signals than others. We didn’t have this issue when we stayed downtown. 

For the pool and beach, all the chairs are almost gone by about 8am except the quiet pool (I attached a pic of that ) The big pool was nice to hang out during the day but we switched to the smaller quiet pool when we just wanted less people. The beach was nice to sit on the floating rafts. 

We ended up booking a night downtown for our last night and glad we did as it was fun to stay and see that part of the island and be walkable. I just recommend not trying to go there when cruise ships are docked as it’s 3x as busy.   


For the pics, wanted to show the room and plug types and you definitely need extra converters if coming from US. The difference in the beach pics - the one of the beach at the hotel in contrast the beach you see when you drive an hour up the coast - huge difference. For those wanting to know about the quiet pool - it was hard to find, near the golf course and by the single story duplex type rooms. But bathroom was all the way at Alo restaurant - not close! 

 For those that attract bugs, bring spray - I am one of those people and definitely got bit! The island is more desert and windy unlike than other Caribbean islands we've been to- if you've ever been to Cabo San Lucas I would say similar feel.

**Eleven days ago, London burned.**
---

Sergeant Thomas Miller was in Whitehall when the sky split open. A deafening thunderclap cracked overhead, rattling windows and shattering streetlights, as cloaked figures riding broomsticks in tight formations poured from it, descending into the streets. For a heartbeat, he froze, staring in disbelief as his mind failed to process the scene unfolding; arcs of emerald bolts tore violently into cars, buildings, and fleeing people.

The tube station beside him exploded, belching a torrent of flame and debris into the air, as time seemed to slow. Tom's training surged to the surface, combat instinct displacing panic. The chaos around him sharpened into tactical clarity as military discipline overrode primal fear.

Three...*whatever they were*...enemies were rapidly approaching down the corridor, and firing into any clear target on their approach. The street was a killbox; tightly packed storefronts left no escape.

*Shift yourself. Bloody move. LEG IT YOU FUCKING IDIOT!*

Tom snapped into action, seizing the young couple frozen beside him, their faces pale with shock as they stared at a massive spectral serpent rearing up from the smoke-filled street.

""Move! There, behind the bus!"" he yelled, pushing them into the nearest cover–-an overturned Routemaster, its twisted metal hull already scorched black. From beneath its steel wreckage, they watched as the three terrors rushed past overhead.

""Stay down,"" he hissed, his hand instinctively reaching for a sidearm that wasn't there. *Bloody civilian life. Years out, and still the soldier.*

The robed figures rose up and veered off, choosing another street to strafe with fire. Tom pressed himself closer to the couple, staying hidden in the wreckage. *They're moving on. Stay put. Don't be stupid.*

It felt like an eternity, but when replayed in his mind, could only have been minutes, and then it was over. The whizzing streaks of energy ceased, and monstrous glowing forms of serpents and dragons faded. One by one, the figures vanished, leaving behind the smoldering remains of what was once his home.

When they crawled out from their sanctuary under the bus, choking on the ash-filled air, Tom stood to find Whitehall unrecognizable, painted in fire and ruin. He had known war before–Bosnia had left its scars–but it was nothing like this. There was a horrible stillness to it all. A kind of serenity almost more horrifying than the screams that had come before it.

A lot has happened since then.

Whitehall wasn't the only target–devastation blanketed the city. Shelters sprang up in surrounding towns, while the army steamed into London to evacuate the survivors.

Shortly thereafter, a call went out across the emergency camp Tom found himself in for certain military personnel to gather, and he was dumped into a truck headed for Debden with other squaddies. It was a tiny farming village in Essex, only on the map because it had an old air base from the war. As their convoy pulled off the M11, the truck joined an endless column of military vehicles destined for the air base. When they arrived, the place was a beehive of activity. Something big was unfolding, far beyond a relocation effort.

They were directed towards a building that looked impossibly small for the endless stream of personnel being guided into it. Only once inside it did they understand; it was merely a facade, a shell of a structure enveloping a funicular lift that plunged soldiers and equipment deep underground, into the abyss of a massive subterranean complex, with urgent purpose.

The next few hours passed in a blur. They stripped out of soot-blackened civilian clothes and changed into combat fatigues. They were fed, eating quickly, and silently, eyes darting around anxiously among strangers united by shock and confusion. And then they were organized by their armored division, and shuffled into a briefing room.

Magic, they were told, was real.

It sounded impossible–absurd, even–but Intelligence wasn't joking. There was a parallel Earth out there, veiled by spells and sorcery. And for decades, incursions from their world had been meticulously tracked. First detected in the 60's, when radar meant to watch for Soviet missiles began picking up flying objects across the countryside. In time, the effort to learn more, and defend against it, grew into a blacksite program rivaling the Manhattan Project. The hole, it seemed, through which so many classified budgets drained.

They listened in stunned silence. It was like Intelligence had just revealed that Santa was real–and that the North Pole was an existential threat to humanity.

But the revelations didn't end there. After London, war was a foregone conclusion–a strategic counterattack had been planned, but…how?

That's when they dropped the second bombshell.

They'd spent decades channeling humanity's brightest minds into creating a bridge between worlds.

They called it the LookingGlass.

At the command of the Captain giving the briefing, the blast doors covering the thick glass windows opened with a heavy electric drawl. Beyond was an expanse of open floor, crowded with machinery–vehicles, aircraft, equipment, and soldiers in formation.Tom’s eyes scanned the columns—he immediately recognized the Warriors, FV432s, and even the newly fielded Challenger 2’s, but he couldn’t place the odd radar-domed vehicles.

All were lined up, ready to travel through the device at the center of the chamber. Standing several stories tall, surrounded by a web of cables and conduit, stood a gateway to another world. Its rectangular frame pulsed with energy at its edges, and at the center they could make out a forested valley lashed by violent storms.

""Jesus Christ,"" mumbled the wiry man next to Tom, in a thick Cockney accent.

Wind and rain gusted into the complex, buffeting personnel clad in yellow ponchos waiving signal wands to guide the next column of an expeditionary task force into position. A klaxon blared sharply, echoing through the chamber, and the column began to move through the gateway, into the turbulent land beyond.

The Cockney soldier shifted anxiously, then leaned closer.

""Guess we're next, eh, mate?""

**Washington, DC.**


British Defense Attaché, Brigadier Ian Wolsey sipped from a styrofoam cup. Stale American coffee was an acquired taste since his transfer to the embassy. He'd skipped his morning tea, and needed the caffeine for the intelligence shakedown that was unfolding.

Wolsey glanced around the secure DIA briefing room. He'd been in this building before, but never this deep underground.

""Brigadier Wolsey,"" began the silver-haired senior chief conducting the briefing, ""We appreciate the intel you've shared on the London attacks. It's clear we're facing something unprecedented. But there's one more thing I'd like explained."" He motioned to the analyst nearest the projector. ""Next slide.""

**Ka-chick.**

The slide shifted, revealing a grainy satellite image over Dubden, timestamped 24 hours ago. He knew the Americans watched them–if he had enough satellites, he'd have done the same, but showing it was brazen–typical Americans.

""Brigadier, what I can't fathom is what's going on here. We see the amassing of…"" He thumbed through some papers until his finger landed on a highlighted list, ""...a full British mechanized force; one Armored Brigade Combat Team at strength, two mechanized Infantry Battalions, one Aviation Detachment…and more,"" he finished, a third through the list.

Wolsey felt eyes in the room shift towards him. In return, he calmly met the senior chief's gaze, betraying nothing.

""Now, if I saw this exact build-up anywhere else, I'd say you were staging an invasion. But there's a problem, Brigadier—Next slide, please.""

**Ka-chick.**

The next slide was a montage of 9-images, each timestamped 45-minutes apart–orbital intervals of the satellite. The first showed about half the force gone, and in the last, nothing remained but empty troop carriers and scattered armored transport vehicles.

""They've vanished.""

The senior chief's voice was cold, measured.

""So, what exactly are you hiding beneath Debden?""

---

**Debden, Essex.**


Not one of the enlistees in the briefing had opted out of the mission. Those who hadn’t personally witnessed the sacking of London, had watched the events unfold again and again on TV. They were each eager to settle the score.

Tom’s gut churned with tension as he sat in his Warrior IFV, third vehicle from the front, positioned before the towering gateway of the LookingGlass. With the hatches sealed, the roar of wind and rain became a muted vibration through the hull. Inside, the sharp tang of ionized air from the gate grew stronger, almost metallic.

Through the periscope optics in the commander’s hatch, Tom gazed ahead. Beyond the rippling gateway stretched a feral landscape of forests and valleys, now scarred by the construction of a forward operating base. Whatever awaited them, it wasn't Bosnia, and it sure as hell wasn't anything he'd trained for.

\*What the fuck are you doing Tom?\*He brushed the thought aside and instinctively checked comms. They’d barely had twenty minutes to learn each other's names before climbing into their vehicles. His driver, Lance Corporal Davies, gave him a thumbs-up. Beside him, Private Cooper—the lanky Cockney from the briefing—chewed nervously on a stick of gum, fidgeting with the controls of the 30mm RARDEN cannon. Tom glanced back at the seven infantrymen squeezed into the troop compartment, Corporal Ellis giving them a last-minute equipment check.

""Section ready, Sarge,"" Ellis called up.

Tom nodded, feeling the engine's reassuring rumble beneath his boots as they idled, awaiting their turn. Minutes dragged by as the column ahead cleared. The crew sat in tense silence, listening anxiously to the muffled chaos beyond the armor.

A sharp rap jolted him back into focus. Tom twisted the locking handle and cracked the hatch, revealing a harried young corporal in a yellow poncho.

""What's the word, Corporal?""

""New orders, Sergeant,"" the corporal shouted above the din, thrusting a sealed dispatch into Tom’s outstretched hand. ""Recon's picked up a village ten kilometers east of the main corridor under attack. Suspected members of the Resistance. Command wants you to take a detachment, push out, neutralize hostiles, secure the site, and hold until your platoon leader links up.""

Tom's chest tightened. ""Enemy strength?""

The corporal shook his head, rain dripping from his helmet. ""Uncertain. But aerial recon showed—some sort of incendiary weapons. When you go through the gate, the marshals will guide you to your platoon and out of the FOB, from there head east until you pick up a road. The rest is on the op sheet.""

Tom nodded grimly. ""Understood.""

Slamming the hatch shut, Tom keyed the comm. ""Listen up. New objective. A village is taking fire ten klicks east. Cooper, Davies–eyes sharp. Ellis, prep for dismount. Civilians on-site.""

""Roger, Sarge,"" Ellis responded firmly.

As the staging klaxons wailed, their echoes muffled through armored steel, Tom skimmed the op sheet. He’d been assigned platoon sergeant of a four-vehicle mechanized element–three Warriors plus one MMJV, \*whatever that was–\*some kind of special equipment marked as mission-critical. He started digging through the plastic wallet for details, but outside, marshals in glowing ponchos were already signaling them forward.

Tom steadied himself, taking a slow breath as he peered into the optics.

""Right then,"" he said firmly. ""Driver, take us through.""

---

Passing through the LookingGlass had been strangely anticlimactic—just a flash of static, the hair on Tom's neck prickling with the sudden charge, and a brief, stomach-churning sensation of weightlessness.

Then they were simply there. Another world.

On the other side was a proper, squaddie-approved clusterfuck under a torrential downpour. Harsh halogen lights strung high on generators cast stark shadows through sheets of rain, illuminating a muddy, chaotic hive of activity. Marshals with bright ponchos and red torch-wands gestured sharply, desperately directing the unending flow of vehicles and troops pouring through the gate. Shouts, engine noise, and the hammering of construction equipment fought against the relentless storm to dominate the night air.

Royal Engineers—soaked, exhausted, and smeared with mud—worked feverishly, setting up defensive barriers, stringing razor wire, and erecting prefab structures that already sagged under the relentless rain. The steel-grated roads sank deeper into the mud with every passing vehicle. Puddles of oily water pooled across its surface, gleaming dully under the silver cast of moonlight.

""Christ,"" Tom muttered under his breath, taking it all in through the periscope. It was somehow both impressive and disheartening. He knew the RE lads were probably working double shifts with no end in sight, fighting a losing battle against mud, exhaustion, and urgency.

""Welcome to paradise, boys,"" Tom said, voice thick with sarcasm, over the internal comms.

A marshal waved them forward, aggressively pointing eastward as their vehicle moved off the steel grates and onto raw, muddy earth. Ahead stretched dozens of tracks already carved into the grassland—nothing but deep, muddy ruts winding into the darkness.

The road was located exactly as marked on the grid map. The platoon turned onto it and continued east, their vehicles bucking hard over previously buried boulders and thick roots, now exposed by the heavy traffic of tracked vehicles.

“Sorry, Sarge–roads are absolute shit.”

“Understood, Davies,” Tom replied evenly, “Just do the best you can.”

Tom pulled out the contents of the plastic wallet, and glanced over each file before passing it onto the crew. He stopped on the Special Equipment Brief, containing the MMJV–Mobile Magic-Jamming Vehicle, callsign SPELLBREAKER-2.

*Nice and subtle, that. Bet the lads in Strategy had a laugh.*

He skimmed the sheet, eyes flicking quickly across jargon and warnings. Magic-suppression, 10-minutes max of continuous effect. He grunted softly. *Then what?* His mind flashed back to Whitehall.

Sliding the spec sheet away, Tom turned back to the optics. Rain slashed across the periscope, blurring the view of dense trees and tangled brush as they rolled deeper into the surreal landscape. The woods around them thickened, older and wilder than anything back home. Gnarled oaks and towering pines flanked their muddy route, limbs twisted by years of overgrowth.

""Looks bloody medieval out here,"" muttered Cooper, peering through his own scope. ""Half expect Robin Hood to jump out.""

""Keep your eyes open for more than merry men,"" Tom replied, deadpan. ""Recon said incendiary weapons—whatever the hell that means out here.""

Three clicks out, they entered a clearing through the trees, rumbling up to a dilapidated stone hut off the roadside, the structure half-collapsed and choked by ivy.

""Davies, slow it down–halt just ahead,"" Tom instructed.

""Roger, Sarge."" The Warrior slowed, then came to a stop a hundred meters ahead of the shack.Tom squinted through the optics. Smoke curled faintly from a moss-covered chimney, vanishing quickly in the storm. Nothing on thermals. 

“Oi, look at that thing,” piped up Cooper, “We’re in the fookin’ Shire now lads.”

“Jesus mate, shut it,” snapped Davies.

They watched the hut closely, each second stretching as tension tightened the air. Nothing moved but leaves whipped by rain. It remained dark and quiet, its windows vacant and unblinking.

Tom keyed the comm channel, switching briefly to the platoon frequency. ""SPELLBREAKER-2, how long to deploy your field?""

""Training said ninety seconds, Sergeant.” A pause in static. “But we haven’t tested it in combat, over.""

""Copy,"" Tom said. It felt dangerously slow in a fight, but it was what it was.

""Davies, push on,"" Tom finally said, relaxing a fraction. ""Probably abandoned. We’re still a ways out from the objective.""

The Warrior lurched forward again, tracks grinding mud beneath them. Just as Tom started to settle, something flickered at the edge of his vision—movement in the trees. He swung the periscope sharply, eyes straining to penetrate the curtain of rain. Nothing but shadow and gloom met his gaze.

Then it shifted again, clearer now.

""Contact right! Tree line, seventy meters!""

""Can't confirm target,"" Cooper barked, turret already rotating, his voice tight.

""Hold fire!"" Tom snapped. His pulse quickened as he steadied his view. A shape emerged from behind dripping foliage—thin, wobbly, and thoroughly bizarre.

It was some kind of animal, tall and gangly. Bulging blue eyes, elongated neck, webbed feet. It stood motionless, blinking in apparent confusion.

""Tracking now,"" Cooper yelled, then hesitated, sounding incredulous. ""Jesus Christ, Sarge—what is that thing? Looks like a drowned alpaca!""

Tom stared in disbelief. The creature tilted its head, regarding their armored vehicle with an expression disturbingly close to curiosity.

""Just hold your fire,"" Tom repeated, forcing calm into his voice. 

Seconds passed with the creature watching them, then it ducked its long neck down to pluck leaves from a bush, and chewed them in satisfaction.

Tom let out a breath. ""Right then. Whatever it is, it's not a threat.""

The infantrymen in the troop compartment had gone silent, straining to see anything through their limited viewport. Ellis finally broke the silence.

""Sarge, you mind tellin' us what's going on out there?""

""Local wildlife,"" Tom replied dryly. ""Stand by for Attenborough to give you the details.""

Suddenly the animal shuddered, let out a mournful, echoing call that cut through even the storm, and then turned abruptly, bounding awkwardly into the deeper woods. In its wake, the forest shifted subtly, branches bending and swaying despite the wind having momentarily stilled.

""Trees are bloody moving now,"" Cooper muttered, voice subdued. ""Proper haunted forest, this.""

A brief crackle over comms interrupted before Tom could reply. ""Iron-Two to Iron-One,"" Sergeant Harris's voice was tight, tense. ""Did we just see an alien goat? Or have you been spiking our tea again?""

Tom clicked his radio to respond. ""Alien goat confirmed, Iron-Two. Putting Cooper on nature-watch. Keep your heads on straight, all vehicles.""

""Roger that,"" Harris replied. ""We'll keep an eye out for unicorns next.""

Tom’s finger hesitated to press his PTT button to respond, before deciding against it.

""Davies, steady on. Cooper, any more zoological commentary, save it for the debrief. Let's get back to soldiering.""

The Warrior lurched onward, drawing the platoon beyond the clearing, into the gnarled treeline as the unnatural forest closed in around them.

**Washington, DC.**


Wolsey closed his eyes for a moment, easing back into the embassy chair as the day’s tension seeped out of his muscles. They’d pressed him hard, and he'd held firm. Official denials, a well-practiced look of diplomatic confusion, just enough doubt planted to keep the Americans spinning their wheels. 

He opened his eyes, rubbing the bridge of his nose. Outside the window, D.C. traffic crawled by, headlights blurred beneath steady rain. It wasn't Oxfordshire rain—too loud, too insistent—still, it felt familiar. So many postings, so many different cities, yet he always found comfort in small familiarities—and every place had rain.

The phone rang, shrill and unwelcome. With a sigh, he answered.

""Wolsey.""

""Brigadier Wolsey,"" came a crisp, familiar voice—Major General Braddock, his tone both curt and tired. ""Good show with the Americans. I've heard you handled yourself quite well.""

""Sir,"" Wolsey replied, sitting upright. A call at this hour, from Braddock himself, was never good news.

""I'll skip the formalities, Ian,"" Braddock continued. ""Your embassy posting is terminated effective immediately. You're being recalled to London, what's left of it.""

""Recalled, sir?"" Wolsey echoed, mind racing. ""Understood. What's the posting?""

""Field deployment–mirror side. You’ll be the liaison officer between our frontline forces and the local resistance. We have to forge alliances, build trust with the locals, and fast.”“What’s changed?,” asked Wolsey.“We’re taking ground faster than expected. Once we've shattered the current regime, we'll be sitting on a powder keg–armed refugees on one side, and magical Europe on the other. If it all goes tits up, it may trigger Broken Sovereign.""

Wolsey's gut tightened at the mention of one of the worst-case dust-covered doctrines, never meant to see daylight.

""Why me, sir?"" The question slipped out before he could stop himself.

""You know why, Ian, and frankly, we don’t have another subject matter expert with your background."" The general paused briefly. ""Your jet leaves within the hour. Briefing packet waiting aboard. Pack lightly.""

The line went dead. Wolsey sat frozen for a long moment, handset still pressed against his ear, his mind churning over the implications. Finally, he returned the phone to its cradle with deliberate care, stood slowly, and moved to the window. Rain streaked across the glass in distorted rivulets, casting the city outside in strange, shifting shapes.

He exhaled deeply. Wolsey had deliberately kept himself at arm's length from the project—years of intelligence gathering, endless drone reconnaissance, painstaking invasion and defense scenarios–but now it was pulling him back in, unavoidable, like gravity.He’d left it for a life of desks–navigating quiet embassies, sterile briefings, and carefully worded exchanges, where there was structure to it, rules. Now, he’d be heading straight into the sort of grey theatre he'd once sworn he'd never revisit.

It felt all too familiar. Different skies, perhaps, but the same tension that prickled beneath his calm exterior, and the same echoes of quiet orders whispered in places officially denied. A younger version of himself had learned that the rules of war blurred quickly once you stepped off the map–ventured off the ledger. He'd thought those days behind him. And yet, after London, something about him was different–more willing.

His expression hardened, resigned to his fate. He pulled on his suit and gathered his things, fingers pausing briefly at the faint ridge of a worn-out passport—a quiet reminder of old ghosts and forgotten borders.

""Never say never,"" he murmured quietly, turning away from his desk.

**Objective Thistleford.**


The village was burning.

From their position along the ridgeline, hidden by the thick curtain of rain and dense trees, Tom's platoon watched silently. Tom stared through the periscope, mouth pressed into a tight line, the optics fogging slightly from the humid breath escaping between his teeth.

Buildings crackled and groaned beneath the flames, painting the forest in a hellish glow.

""Jesus Christ,"" murmured Davies from the driver’s seat.

Tom took in the familiar sight. *War never changes.*

The radio crackled as other vehicles in the platoon checked in, tension lacing every clipped word.

""Iron-Two, eyes on. Holding position.""

""Iron-Three, set. Ready.""

""Spellbreaker, standing by.""

Tom drew a slow, steady breath. ""Copy, all. Hold positions and await my signal.""

As he spoke, a dark shape suddenly swept through the smoke-filled sky, blotting out the fires. It descended rapidly, wings outstretched, unleashing a searing torrent of flame that engulfed a fresh line of houses. Timber and stone burst instantly into roaring firestorms, pushing a wave of heat across the valley.

""Oh, fuck me sideways,"" Cooper whispered, voice strangled. ""Is that a dragon?""

Tom didn't answer, couldn't answer. He tracked the creature through the optics, as it banked sharply, landing heavily in the village square. Claws tore gouges in the muddy earth as the beast crawled forward, lowering its head submissively toward three hooded figures waiting calmly amidst the inferno. One figure reached out a pale hand, stroking the creature’s snout without hesitation.

Silence fell inside the Warrior for a beat, broken only by the soft hiss of rain against metal armor.

""Sarge,"" Ellis’s voice crackled quietly through the intercom. ""That building at village center—something odd about it.""

Tom swung the periscope sharply toward the structure Ellis was indicating, a two-story Victorian house. It sat untouched amid the inferno, the flames curling strangely around it—seeming to part, or slide off some invisible barrier. Embers drifted close, only to twist aside, as if repelled by an unseen force.

""Bloody hell,"" Tom muttered under his breath. ""Yeah, I see it, Corporal. Some kind of shield?”

""Don’t know, Sarge,"" Ellis replied tightly. ""Maybe.""

Tom considered this silently, eyes narrowing. ""Magic?"" he asked quietly, almost rhetorically.

Ellis didn’t respond.

Tom chewed his lip, scanning the perimeter. The building wasn't burning, but every avenue leading to it was consumed by flames. A magic shield complicated things. If it was the only thing protecting the structure from burning, they’d have to move fast once Spellbreaker did its thing.

""All right, we punch through, neutralize hostiles, and extract civilians. Our training on this was brief, so eyes open and remember—anyone holding a wand is armed. Treat accordingly.""

Tom flicked the comm to platoon-wide broadcast.

""All callsigns, Alpha Actual. Objective is the intact structure at village center—likely civilian holdout. Confirmed hostiles on-site, including a... dragon. Spellbreaker, hold minimum safe distance, maintain suppression as long as possible. Iron-Two, Iron-Three, wedge formation on my lead. Infantry dismount upon arrival. Rapid breach, neutralize threats, extract civilians. Standby to move on my command.""

A chorus of steady acknowledgments followed, the troops' professionalism pushing past disbelief.

""Copy, Alpha Actual. Standing by.""

Tom gave himself one breath, just long enough to slow the hammering in his chest, then twisted the hatch handle and pushed it open, rising into the storm.

""Cooper, steady on the cannon. I’m taking the MILAN.""

They were cornered.

Hermione ducked sharply as a jet of green light exploded against the window frame above her, showering wood and glass across the room. She quickly glanced to her friends. Luna was crouched near the opposite window, calm and composed despite the chaos, wand tightly in hand. Behind her, a frightened third-year named Will crouched with wide eyes, his knuckles white around his wand. Too young, Hermione thought bitterly.

They’d bought the others precious seconds–enough for them to escape–but it would cost them dearly. The feeling of dread seeped into her.

Another spell slammed into the wall, sending dust cascading down from the ceiling. Outside, Death Eaters laughed cruelly, taunting them, savoring the hunt.

""Hold still–stay in cover!"" Hermione shouted, forcing steel into her voice. She caught Luna’s serene gaze, receiving a gentle nod in return.

Will whimpered softly, flinching as spellfire crackled dangerously close. Hermione reached over, placing a firm, comforting hand on his shoulder. ""Keep down,"" she said urgently. ""We’ll get through this.""

The lie tasted sour. For months, she’d watched what was left of her friends be whittled away, just like this.

The village outside burned savagely, its flames roaring louder, consuming every path that might have led them to safety. Her pulse quickened against the weight of a truth she could no longer deny—this was the end. No clever plan could save them now–it was the moment she'd finally failed.

She looked briefly around the room, at the grim, soot-stained faces of her friends, of those she'd sworn to protect, knowing they were waiting for her guidance, for a scrap of hope that she couldn’t give.

It all surged back at once: Voldemort’s return, the Ministry’s collapse, Hogwarts under siege, the Order fracturing—one loss after another. Hermione felt a painful lump in her throat at the memory of the public executions.

Even then, the fighting hadn’t ended. Instead, it unraveled, scattering into fragments, driven by desperation and stubborn courage as they ground against an unstoppable force. She had led them to this final moment. Without consensus, minutes ago, she had weighed their three lives against the survival of the others, a tactical calculation made in silence. Like a chess move.

Hermione drew a slow, hollow breath, letting the last fragile thread of belief slip silently away. Her expression shifted subtly—fear replaced by grim acceptance, uncertainty by resolve, leaving her gaze bleak yet steady, fixed resolutely on the inevitable.

Her attention shifted slowly toward Luna, their eyes meeting in silent, shared understanding.*I’m so sorry.*

Then, suddenly, she felt it—a sickening emptiness spreading from her core, something fundamental abruptly torn away. Hermione gasped sharply, her stomach lurching.

Her magic was gone.

Across the room, Luna’s expression flickered with confusion, eyes widening in alarm. Will turned toward Hermione, panicked, wand trembling uselessly in his grip. ""Hermione, what just–""

Before he could finish, a deafening crack split the night outside. A searing white bolt ripped through the storm, piercing the dragon with a violent flash. The shrapnel from its shattered scales spattered the house’s facade, breaking windows, as the massive creature let out a gut-wrenching shriek. Its wings flailing, it twisted in on itself and convulsed weakly, before it stilled, steam rising from the gaping wound.

Hermione recoiled, horror etched across her face.

A heartbeat later, the Death Eaters dissolved into a bloody mist, their panicked yells silenced abruptly by a thunderous barrage. The sudden, brutal violence lasted only seconds.

Hermione stared numbly, gripping her wand as though it might return her magic. Luna rose carefully, her normally dreamy voice tense. ""Something’s changed. We should leave, Hermione. Quickly.""

Hermione snapped back into focus, heart hammering. ""Right—everyone out the back, now!"" She reached down, grabbing Will’s trembling arm, pulling him along. ""Stay with me, Will, keep moving.""

They pushed through the kitchen, debris crunching beneath their feet. Hermione reached the back door first, throwing it open. ""Come on—""

She froze as blinding white lights slammed into her vision, harsh voices slicing through the darkness.

""DROP YOUR WANDS! HANDS ON YOUR HEADS, NOW!""

Hermione flinched, squinting through the glare. Soldiers advanced swiftly, rifles up and aimed steadily at the group. Their faces were hidden by helmets and shadow, their outlines stark against the burning backdrop of the village.

Will let out a frightened cry, taking a half-step backward, panic seizing him.

""DO NOT MOVE!"" another voice barked sharply. ""ON YOUR KNEES! NOW!""

Hermione’s pulse hammered desperately as her mind raced through any possible alternatives. But with the cold, relentless glare of floodlights fixed on them and the soldiers already tightening their perimeter, there was nowhere left to run.

The voice shouted again, cutting through her thoughts: ""WANDS ON THE GROUND, HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEADS. LAST WARNING!""

Hermione swallowed tightly, heart thudding painfully in her chest. Slowly, deliberately, she dropped her useless wand into the mud and raised her hands, sinking to her knees. Luna followed without hesitation, gently guiding Will down beside her.

Boots splashed quickly through puddles as the soldiers closed in. A figure moved forward aggressively, rifle unwavering as he kicked Hermione’s wand away. His voice was clipped, authoritative.

""Secure them fast. Bag the wands. Eight minutes ‘till the field drops.""

Hands roughly grasped Hermione’s wrists, pulling them behind her back. She felt the sharp bite of plastic ties against her skin as they tightened into place with a zzzzip. Her breathing was rapid, uneven, a painful tightness clenching her throat.

""Structure clear!"" called another voice. ""Civilians secured!""

""Good. Let’s move it!""

Strong hands guided her forward, half stumbling, half running through the churned mud. Rain lashed at her face, blurring her vision, smoke stinging her eyes as the fires surged higher now, unchecked. Without magic, the protective wards had failed. Flames advanced rapidly, swallowing everything in their path.

She stumbled, and a soldier steadied her roughly by the arm, urging her forward. Luna stayed close to Will, who was visibly trembling. Hermione struggled to process the chaos, her exhausted mind trying desperately to anchor onto anything familiar.

They rounded the corner of the house, and Hermione froze.

Waiting ahead, starkly illuminated by blazing buildings, were three hulking metal vehicles, angular and menacing, like beasts of steel crouched low on muddy tracks. They were military tanks—or something very like them. She had read about them, seen pictures in newspapers her parents used to read, even watched them on TV, but to see them here, in the burning heart of Magical Britain…

It was impossible. Her mind rejected it outright.

A soldier shouted something lost in the roar of the fire, sharply tugging her forward. Hermione moved numbly, barely aware as they reached the first vehicle. The steel hatch at the back lowered rapidly, revealing the cramped interior lit dimly by green and amber lights. Another soldier—young, face smeared in soot—quickly moved aside to make room, gesturing urgently.

""In you go, move!""

Hermione was practically lifted inside, Luna following silently, Will pressed tightly against her side. More hands guided her to a narrow bench, and she sank into the cold metal seat, the tightness of the flex-cuffs biting into her wrists. Luna sat next to her, offering only a quiet nod of reassurance, her calm expression now tinged with a faint unease. Will hunched beside Luna, his eyes darting around the dark, claustrophobic space.

The hatch slammed closed with a sharp clang, locking them inside. Hermione flinched at the noise. The muffled roar of flames and distant shouting became dull, distant, replaced now by a new noise—the low, persistent growl of an engine rumbling through steel beneath their feet.

The vehicle jerked suddenly, tracks grinding beneath them as it began to move. Hermione pressed back into the seat, fighting to steady herself as panic threatened to slip past her mental defenses. Her mind spiraled—dragons exploding, Muggle soldiers shouting commands, her magic torn away, leaving her hollow. It was chaos, impossible yet undeniably real, pressing on her from every side.

She closed her eyes tightly, sensing the sharp rise of fear, the familiar tremor that meant she was dangerously close to breaking. Her pulse pounded relentlessly in her ears, tongue hitching painfully in her throat. She'd felt this way before—in the Department of Mysteries, Malfoy Manor, Hogwarts as it burned—each time barely escaping the panic that threatened to consume her.

*No. Not now. They need you.*

Drawing a long breath, Hermione mentally reached inward, grasping for control. Slowly, she forced herself to push emotion away, leaving behind nothing but cold logic. It was a practiced skill—one she wished she'd never needed to learn. Her trembling eased gradually, heartbeat slowing enough to let her think clearly.

When she opened her eyes again, she viewed the cramped, dimly-lit interior of the armored vehicle through a clearer lens. The surreal nature of the moment still pressed against her mind, but now she observed it with calculated detachment: disciplined soldiers, tense and alert, rifles held ready. Luna beside her, calmly comforting a terrified Will. Hermione bit the inside of her cheek sharply, pain focusing her thoughts, cementing control.

One of the soldiers, older than the rest, leaned slightly toward her, gaze firm but not unkind.

""We’re taking you somewhere safe. Don’t try anything foolish. Understand?""

Hermione nodded, not yet trusting herself to speak.

In spite of everything—the firestorm, the impossible soldiers, her stolen magic—she clung fiercely to the one solid fact amidst madness:

My only loose plans so far are to head out for a few drinks on Tuesday night after I arrive (helps reset the body clock and minimises jet lag) as well as see Notre Dame and Galeries Bartoux at some point during my stay. That and hopefully find a few good bars that have a social crowd and live music.

This is all such a shit show - all the millennials are telling me to ""just have fun"" with dating, but it hasn't been fun at all, and frankly, feels like a waste of time.
