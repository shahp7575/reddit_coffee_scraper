Why? Why are we told to do all the hard, least efficient and least cost effective stuff first? 

I posted this in the Realtor subreddit as a comment to a new agent who was really discouraged. I’m re-posting here because I keep seeing the same questions over and over. 

Repost:

Don’t be hard on yourself. If this business is for you, it’s probably too early to say. You’ve joined the industry at the worse AND best time to do so. I was licensed in 2010 - the aftermath of the housing crash. Nothing sold. I did 3 deals my first year. Ended up in major debt. The best part? I learned how to conquer this industry in the worst circumstances.

Within 4 years I was netting 6 figures and within the next year I was in the top 1%. And I’m an introvert who does no “lead generation”, ir buying “online leads”.

I’ll be honest, the moment I read you were working as an assistant for a team, I cringed a bit. No, it’s not a bad thing. You can learn a lot through that process. But after 2 years you’ve probably learned all that you can there. Teams too often unintentionally keep people from their true potential in this industry. I’ve literally says this to my own team members as I “let them go”. You become dependent on “their” leads and their business while never taking that big and necessary scary risk to go out on your own.

Here’s the thing. If you’re properly mentored, every single agent should be able to make $100k in their first year. Most don’t because they play this profession part time. They keep their old job. Their broker and/or team lead is too busy. They waste money on bus benches instead of coaching. They look for the cheapest brokerage instead of the one with the most value.

The agent market is just too saturated to care about you. So you need to take action into your own hands. If you want some extra money to scrape by, keep working for someone else. But if you want to find out if you can really do this, then do it.

Start looking for conversations. Find 6 people every single day to have a conversation about real estate in some form. 3 of those should be people you know, 3 people you don’t. For the 3 you don’t, those should be at networking events, open houses, anyone you randomly meet. If you take interest in the lives of others, they’ll take interest in yours.

Don’t buy leads. Buy coffee. First year in real estate: 2000 business cards. 1 cheap website (no more than $60 per month). Budget for 40 lunches, 100+ coffee meetings.

Make a list of everyone you know well enough to have a drink with. You only need 80-100 to make $100l. Scrape your Facebook, phone contacts, high school, college, etc. Put them into 3 categories:

A - people who will definitely use you, refer you. Later on you can make this people who have used you and/or referred people to you.

B - people who would probably use you, or referred hou, may need reminding.

C - people who might use you but will take some convincing.

Put them all in a spreadsheet or CRM with as much information as you can. Contact info. Kids names. Birthdays. Jobs. Social media links.

Call or text 3 of them everyday. Catch up. Tell or remind them you’ve gotten in real estate. Don’t ask for business. Tell them you’re going to do the realtor thing absolutely send out calendars. Or maybe you are going to have a launch party. You need their email or mailing address if you don’t have it. Get permission to send calendar or invite.
Set a lunch/coffee/wine with at least 1 of these people per week.

For your “A” group, treat them to lunch. For your B and C treat them to coffee or wine. Conversation = FORD. Ask them about their family, occupation, recreation, dreams. Listen. Don’t be quick to speak. Ask lots of questions about their life and note their answers. Of course when you ask about their job they will ask about yours. Don’t ask for business. Talk about how excited you are about your job for like 1-2 minutes and then move on about something you saw on their Facebook or instagram (vacation, etc). At the end of the meeting, remind them, tactfully, “hey, could you do me a favour? If you know anyone thinking of buying or selling real estate, could you mention my name?” Done. Simple. You connected.

1 lunch per week. 2 coffees per week. You can make six figures in your first year without spending a dime on wasteful online leads, flyers, bus benches, etc. More importantly is that you’ll create connections that last a lifetime much faster and build a repeat and referral business that could grow to a million dollar business if you’re consistent.

Additionally, send out a monthly enewsletter. It doesn’t matter if no one reads it. It’s a reminder. Be consistent. Engage on social media. Comment on other people’s post. Take interest in their life. Make excuses to post 20% real estate content. Go to open houses. Go to real estate events. I have a list of 300 topics to talk about.

The more you do, the more it’ll come back to you. The toughest part is doing.",1,1739477229.0,u_Bradrichert,0,1.0,False
1ios6qr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1ios6qr/the_forgotten_room_a_true_horror_story/,The Forgotten Room: A True Horror Story,"There are places in this world that should remain undisturbed. Some doors, once opened, can never be closed. This is the story of a man who entered a room that should have never existed—and was never seen again.

# The Room That Wasn’t There

In the heart of **Edinburgh, Scotland**, there stood an old apartment complex that had seen better days. It was the kind of building where time seemed frozen—dusty hallways, flickering lights, and an unsettling silence that lingered between the walls.

James Holloway, a journalist specializing in urban legends, had moved in temporarily while investigating **a series of disappearances** linked to the building. He was skeptical—ghost stories and curses were nothing more than folklore to him.

Until the night he found **the room that wasn’t there.**

# A Door That Shouldn’t Exist

It was past midnight when James returned from a long night of research. As he walked down the hallway to his apartment on the **fourth floor**, something caught his eye.

A **door**.

It was an old, wooden door with **no number, no handle—nothing**. He was sure it hadn’t been there before. His apartment was at the very end of the hall; there had never been a room there.

His curiosity got the best of him. He reached out, pressing his hand against the wood.

**It was cold. Ice cold.**

Then, the door **creaked open on its own.**

# Inside the Forgotten Room

The air inside was heavy, thick with the scent of old wood and something else… something **rotten**.

The room was small, empty except for an **antique mirror** standing against the far wall.

James stepped inside cautiously, pulling out his phone to take a picture. But the second he lifted the camera—

**The door slammed shut behind him.**

The temperature dropped instantly. His breath turned visible in the air. Then, in the silence, he heard it—

A whisper.

*""You shouldn’t be here.""*

James spun around, his pulse pounding. There was no one in the room. Only his own reflection in the mirror.

Except… it **wasn’t his reflection.**

The figure staring back at him had **his face—but the eyes were black, empty voids.**

Then, the reflection **smiled.**

# The Last Recording

Panicked, James tried to open the door, but it wouldn’t budge. His phone screen **glitched**, the camera app opening on its own.

The front camera flickered to life, showing his own terrified face—

And behind him, a shadow. **Tall. Watching. Waiting.**

The whisper came again.

*""You shouldn’t have come.""*

The phone **went dark.**

That was the last anyone ever saw of James Holloway.

The police found his apartment unlocked, his belongings untouched. But there was no sign of him anywhere. The only thing left behind was his phone, lying in the middle of the empty room.

The last video in his gallery?

**A still image of his own face… but the eyes were not his.**

# The Mystery Remains

The strange door was gone the next day. The hallway was back to normal, as if the room had never existed.

But late at night, some tenants swear they hear **whispers** coming from the end of the hallway.

And sometimes, if you pass by that spot…

**You might see your own reflection in the dark, smiling back at you.**

1ios6bo,https://www.reddit.com/r/politicaldiscourse/comments/1ios6bo/this_cold_war_between_democrats_and_republicans/,This Cold war between Democrats and Republicans is wrecking my marriage.,"Every day when I wake up the first thing I do is look at the news. Mostly Reuters and bbc. I obsessively look for concrete evidence that Trump and Elon are destroying the United States. Every day I think I find the thing that will break my husband’s illusion that trump has our nations best interest at heart. He uses the constitution as toilet paper, I text him along with an article about trump seeking to end birth right citizenship. Then I listen to podcasts like ‘Leaving Maga’ I take notes. I read about cults and people who escaped them as if they are instruction manuals.

But for some reason nothing breaks through. I am no stranger to cult mentality or cognitive dissonance. I was raised Mormon and I loved it. Mormonism shaped who I am and a lot of the doctrine resonated with me. Until it didn’t. My exit from Mormonism was slow. Many exmormons describe a singular moment where their “shelf” broke. The shelf is a metaphorical place where they keep all their doubts. I can’t say I really had a moment where my shelf broke. I had to painstakingly deconstruct each Mormon belief one by one until there was little left. It took me four years. And there are bits and pieces that I still hold onto. My husband was patient with me through all of it. He seemed to be leaps ahead of me in the deconstruction process. How could he be so patient with me through all of that even when I judged him harshly for drinking coffee? He was gentle during late night talks about marijuana, alcohol, coffee, sex and more. I’m so thankful that he never pushed me to mental places when I wasn’t ready. I am grateful and want to do the same for him. But it’s hard.

Even now my closest siblings are liberal Mormons. They hate trump like me but still practice Mormonism. For some reason I find it a lot easier to have grace for them than for my trumpie in laws. I have to remind myself that Mormonism is quite authoritarian. Many of the beliefs I had growing up were quite facist. Us vs them. A romanticization of the past, a belief in ‘traditional families’. Some of the same things I hate about the trump administration. If my husband were to go back to Mormonism I would be ok as long as he didn’t force his opinions on me. Why then am I obsessed with breaking him out of the cult of trump?

I find it almost impossible to restrain myself from sending him articles every day. I read books about facism and tell him bits about it hoping he will connect the dots back to trump. The odd thing is his political beliefs typically align with mine when trump isn’t in the picture. He’s pro Palestine, pro abortion, supports free healthcare, doesn’t subscribe to gender roles, does the majority of our housework and more. But then when he says he likes trump I’m sick. How could I possibly be married to someone who believes so differently than me? How did I get here? 

Recently I wanted to talk politics with him. I want to understand why he supports trump even tho he wouldn’t support anyone else who did what trump is doing. After a heated fight he told me he just wants to stay ignorant. He wants to live his life worrying about things he can control not what he can’t change. He said he wishes we could just go to church and enjoy the community and pretend it’s true even tho it isn’t. I know that to most ppl that will sound disgusting. To me it was a glimmer of hope. I want him to put Mormonism and trump in the same box bc if we can deconstruct Mormonism we can deconstruct this too. 

I also have no real fear that he will get into Mormonism again. I don’t think either of us could believe if we wanted to. And he gets so board at church and is addicted to coffee and weed so it would be a difficult road back for someone who is just pretending to believe. 

I don’t expect anyone to forgive my husband for voting trump into office. I know a lot of people don’t have the emotional bandwidth to have those conversations and they shouldn’t have to. But I see a way out of this for my husband if I’m just patient. I get glimmers of hope sometimes and I think this too will pass. After all my husband often says that if the next four years are bad he will admit I’ve been right all along. 

Last disclaimer: I’m expecting lots of mixed responses, some saying I should divorce my husband and others saying I suck bc it isn’t right to stay with someone in hopes that they will change. I know. Please be gentle with me Reddit ",1,1739477169.0,politicaldiscourse,0,1.0,False

1iorzwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iorzwo/my_new_role_at_facility_xjv14_and_first_assignment/,My New Role at Facility XJV-14 and First Assignment,"A close friend of mine, Saed, requested my transfer to Facility XJV-14. He needed to replace the senior technician who had recently been reassigned to a new facility. My role would be similar to my previous one: handling all physical and psychological evaluations of the patients.

That was fine with me. I hated Facility XJV-06 anyway; it was far too cold for my liking.

I arrived at Facility XJV-14 via the most concealed route the Institute could devise: a deep underground railroad system extending for hundreds of miles, hidden from the public. I was surprised they even had the funds to invest in such transportation.

After a grueling 12-hour commute, Saed greeted me as I stepped off the train. ""Hello, my friend! How are you today?""

""I'm fine,"" I replied. ""A little sleepy, though. I can never sleep on those blasted things.""

""How come?"" Saed inquired. ""They're super quiet with very comfy beds.""

""I never know why,"" I said. ""I guess I'm just restless when I use those trains.""

""Of course,"" Saed said. ""Let me show you to your quarters. I'll help you with your bags. Get some sleep. We'll talk more tomorrow.""

As Saed guided me to my quarters, I took in the sight of Facility XJV-14. From the outside, it appeared small, covered in a multitude of artificial lights that cast an eerie glow on the concrete structure. The train departed almost immediately after we, along with a few other passengers, disembarked and entered the facility. The sound of the train's departure echoed faintly in the underground tunnel, a reminder of the constant movement below the surface.

Despite the small number of people, the train stop was a hive of activity. Passengers hurriedly gathered their belongings, some exchanging brief nods or words of farewell before heading in different directions. The air was filled with the low hum of conversations and the occasional clatter of luggage wheels on the tiled floor. Security personnel moved efficiently among the crowd, their presence both reassuring and imposing.

The facility's entrance was a stark contrast to the bustling train stop. As we stepped inside, the noise from the platform faded, replaced by the soft hum of the facility's ventilation system. The lobby area, though not crowded, had a steady flow of people moving purposefully from one area to another. Clean white tiles covered the floors, reflecting the bright overhead lights and giving the space a sterile, almost clinical feel. Despite the vastness of the lobby, it wasn't very busy, though there was a steady flow of foot traffic, with people moving purposefully from one area to another.

Inside, the facility was much larger than it seemed from the outside. The lobby area spanned multiple levels, each connected by sleek, modern staircases and glass elevators. The clean white tiles and bright overhead lights further emphasized the facility's secretive and controlled environment.

Armed security personnel greeted us at the entrance, their presence a stark reminder of the facility's importance and secrecy. They checked our IDs at a small security post that resembled a foot border crossing, complete with barriers and surveillance cameras. The guards were efficient and thorough, their eyes scanning us with a mix of suspicion and professionalism.

As we passed through the security checkpoint, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The facility's cold, impersonal atmosphere was a stark contrast to the warmth and familiarity of Saed's greeting. The walls were lined with various signs and directions, but the lack of windows and natural light made it easy to lose one's sense of time and place.

Saed led me down a long corridor, the sound of our footsteps echoing off the concrete walls. The corridor branched off into numerous other hallways, each leading to different sections of the facility. Despite the labyrinthine layout, Saed navigated it with ease, his familiarity with the place evident in his confident stride.

Finally, we arrived at my quarters. Saed opened the door and gestured for me to enter. ""Here we are,"" he said with a smile. ""Get some rest. We'll talk more tomorrow.""

I stepped inside, the door closing behind me with a soft click. The room was small but functional, with a bed, a desk, and a small bathroom. It was a far cry from the comfort of home, but it would have to do. My previous room in Facility XJV-06 had been larger, but it was much colder due to its location, making it difficult to ever feel truly comfortable. I set my bags down and took a deep breath, trying to shake off the lingering sense of unease. Tomorrow would be a new day, and I had a feeling it would bring its own set of challenges.

The next morning, I woke up to the soft hum of the ventilation system. I stretched and rubbed the sleep from my eyes before heading to the small bathroom to brush my teeth. The cold water splashed on my face, helping to shake off the remnants of sleep. I made myself a cup of coffee, black as usual, savoring the bitter warmth as it coursed through me.

*Damn*, I thought to myself. *I forgot to ask Saed for directions to his office.*

Determined to find my way, I exited my dorm and began to explore the dormitory. The corridors were quiet, with only the occasional sound of distant footsteps or the murmur of voices behind closed doors. The dormitory was a maze of identical hallways and doors, each one leading to another section of the facility. After a few wrong turns and dead ends, I finally found a directory mounted on the wall.

The directory was a detailed map of the facility, with color-coded sections and clear labels for each area. I traced my finger along the map, locating my current position and plotting a route to Saed's office on the tenth level. With a clearer sense of direction, I headed to the nearest elevator.

The elevator ride was smooth and silent, the kind that made you feel like you were floating. As the doors opened on the tenth level, I stepped out into another labyrinth of hallways. The walls were lined with signs and directions, but they all seemed to blur together in my mind.

I walked down several hallways, each one looking much like the last. The facility's size was overwhelming, and I found myself getting lost a few times along the way. The sterile, white-tiled floors and bright overhead lights only added to the disorienting effect. Despite the confusion, I couldn't help but be amazed at the sheer scale of the place. It was a stark reminder of the Institute's power and resources.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity of wandering, I found Saed's office. I took a deep breath and knocked on the door, ready to face whatever challenges the day would bring.

I heard footsteps approaching, and then the door opened. ""Hello, my friend! Come in, come in,"" Saed said warmly, gesturing for me to enter his office. It was a small space with a window overlooking the lobby. Fortunately, I wasn't afraid of heights, as the view could be quite intimidating for the faint of heart.

I sat down in the chair opposite Saed's desk. As he took his seat, he looked at me with a mixture of concern and urgency. ""I hope you managed to get some sleep,"" he began. ""However, I'm afraid we need to start your assignment right away. I can't delay this order, my friend, even though I wish you could be well-rested for it. Director Anya has requested that patient 20134 be evaluated immediately.""

I wasn't surprised. Director Anya had a reputation for always rushing things. I knew that Saed valued keeping his team happy and well-rested, believing it was key to their success. When situations like this arose, it went against his principles, and I could see the frustration in his eyes, despite his efforts to hide it.

""Understood,"" I replied, trying to sound as composed as possible. ""I'll get started right away.""

Saed nodded, his expression softening slightly. ""Thank you. I know it's not ideal, but your expertise is crucial. Patient 20134 has been exhibiting some unusual behavior, and we need your assessment to proceed.""

I stood up, feeling the weight of the task ahead. ""I'll do my best,"" I assured him.

Just before I exited the office, Saed walked towards me and whispered, ""I shouldn't be telling you this, but you need to know that this priority directive came as a result of an incident with patient 20133. Director Anya believes that patient 20134 is somehow linked to patient 20133, and we need to conduct this evaluation before something unexpected happens. I'll be assigning you two armed security members to keep you safe.""

I nodded, absorbing the gravity of his words. Saed continued, ""If you ever feel unsafe, my friend, leave the area immediately and lock the patient's door. Make sure all staff present are outside the room before you lock it. The patient's isolation is crucial for ensuring the safety of you and the other people.""

His concern was palpable, and I could see the worry etched on his face. ""Thank you for the heads-up, Saed,"" I said, trying to convey my appreciation and resolve. ""I'll be careful.""

Just as I exited his office, I was greeted by two members of the security team. 

“Salutations. My name is Cecilia. This is my partner, Dmitri. We will be keeping you safe today,” said Cecilia as she shook my hand firmly. Dmitri followed with a silent but equally firm handshake.

“Let’s guide you to patient 20134,” Cecilia continued. “Follow us.”

As we walked down the hallway, Cecilia handed me a rather thick binder and began to speak about the details of the patient. “I will give you a brief description of patient 20134 so you know who you’re handling. He used to be a lifeguard in a small, isolated town. One day, he found some black glass or crystal at the bottom of the pool and was somehow teleported to a body of water in another world. After returning to our world, he suffered some intense side effects, which seem to come from his time swimming in the other world. First, we noticed hard white and black patches appearing all over his skin. Within months, these patches began to expand across his body, leaving only his face untouched. Wherever the hard patches appeared, he lost the ability to move and feel in those areas. It’s all very sad, really.”

She paused for a moment, allowing the gravity of her words to sink in, then continued. “After about a month, his skin began to crystallize, covering all but his head. His body has become more see-through, and he is now unable to move. We can see some of his organs through his skin.”

Cecilia's expression grew more serious as she continued. ""The doctors and researchers here tried all sorts of treatments to cure him, but nothing worked. They used everything from advanced skin therapies to experimental drugs, but his condition just kept getting worse. It's like his body isn't part of this world anymore.""

The weight of her words hung in the air. The binder in my hands felt heavier as I realized the severity of the situation. The hallway seemed to stretch on endlessly, each step bringing me closer to the patient.

We crossed another security checkpoint before entering a section labeled *Patients Ward*. The atmosphere grew even more tense, the air thick with the scent of antiseptic and the low hum of machinery. Dmitri, who had been silent until now, began to speak in a thick Eastern European accent. “Cecilia has provided agood description of the patient, yes. But I should mention that he used to talk clearly with people a few weeks ago. Now, he talks in riddles. He speaks of things like a giant tower on an island. Could be relevant, yes?”

I nodded silently, pondering what that could mean. The idea of a giant tower on an island seemed like something out of a dream—or a nightmare. The cryptic nature of the patient's speech added another layer of mystery to an already perplexing case.

As we walked further into the ward, the environment became more oppressive. The walls were lined with doors, each one leading to a room housing another patient with their own set of challenges. The sterile white tiles and bright overhead lights did little to dispel the sense of unease that hung in the air.

Cecilia continued to brief me as we approached patient 20134's room. ""We've tried to make him as comfortable as we can, but he's getting worse quickly. The crystallization is speeding up, and we're running out of time to figure out what's happening to him.""

I took a deep breath, steeling myself for what lay ahead. The door to patient 20134's room loomed before us, a barrier between the known and the unknown. With a nod from Cecilia, Dmitri unlocked the door and we stepped inside.

The sight that greeted me was both fascinating and horrifying. Patient 20134 lay on the bed, his body almost entirely encased in a crystalline shell, with only his face untouched. His eyes followed our movements with a mix of curiosity and despair. The translucent nature of his skin revealed the faint outlines of his internal organs, a grotesque display of his condition.

The crystalline shell covering his body was a mosaic of white and black patches, each one glistening under the harsh fluorescent lights. His limbs were rigid and immobile, the crystal formations rendering them useless. The patches had spread unevenly, creating a jagged, almost artistic pattern across his skin. His chest rose and fell with labored breaths, each movement causing the crystals to shimmer slightly. Through the translucent shell, I could see his lungs expanding and contracting, their rhythmic motion a stark contrast to the stillness of his crystalline exterior. His heart beat steadily, pumping blood through his visible veins, a macabre display of his internal organs working in unison to sustain him despite his condition.

""Hello,"" I said softly, trying to keep my voice steady. ""I'm here to help you.""

The patient’s eyes flickered with recognition, and he began to speak in a low, raspy voice. ""The tower... the island... it's calling me...""

His voice was barely more than a whisper, each word strained and filled with a haunting sense of urgency. The mention of the tower and the island gave me goosebumps, the cryptic nature of his speech adding to the unease in the room.

I exchanged a glance with Cecilia and Dmitri, both of whom looked equally unsettled. The gravity of the situation was clear, and I knew this was going to be a difficult evaluation. The patient's condition was unlike anything I had ever encountered, and the mysterious world he had visited seemed to hold the key to understanding his transformation.

Determined to uncover the truth, I approached the bed and began my assessment, my mind racing with questions and possibilities. The crystalline shell, the cryptic speech, the connection to another world—all of it pointed to something far beyond the ordinary. I was resolved to find answers, not just for patient 20134, but for the safety and well-being of everyone in the facility, and possibly, the entire world.",3,1739476737.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1iorxjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1iorxjf/the_window/,The Window,"My boots crunched over damp leaves as I followed the winding trail deeper into the woods. The air smelled of moss and earth, thick with the scent of rain that had passed through earlier in the day. I was supposed to stick to the main path, but curiosity had gotten the better of me.

The forest was quiet. Too quiet.

I had hiked these woods before, but I had never seen this clearing.

The trees parted around it, their skeletal branches curling inward like fingers. The grass was overgrown, patches of wildflowers dotting the landscape. But none of that mattered—because in the very center of the clearing stood a window.

Just a frame. No glass.

It was tall and weathered, the paint long stripped away by time. It looked like it had been ripped from an old house and placed here, upright, with no walls to support it.

My stomach twisted. Something about it felt… wrong.

I stepped closer.

From this side, I saw only the forest beyond. Trees stretched toward the sky, the same as before. But when I moved—just slightly—so that I was directly in front of it…

I stopped breathing.

Through the empty frame, I saw my bedroom.

Not just a bedroom that looked like mine. My bedroom.

The familiar bookshelf stood against the far wall, overflowing with half-read novels and trinkets. My desk, cluttered with notes and empty coffee cups, sat beside it. The curtains were drawn, the dim glow of my bedside lamp casting long shadows over the walls.

And there, lying in bed, was me.

I stumbled back, my heartbeat slamming against my ribs. My mind scrambled for a rational explanation, but nothing made sense. I wasn’t dreaming—I could feel the cool air on my skin, the dampness from the earlier rain still clinging to my jacket.

I took another step forward, peering through the frame again. The scene hadn’t changed.

The figure—I—was still there, curled under the covers. My chest rose and fell with steady breaths, my head turned slightly toward the window. But then, as I watched…

I opened my eyes.

Not the me standing here.

The me in the bed.

I stared at myself, and myself stared back.

The figure in the bed didn’t move. Just lay there, eyes wide, locked onto mine through the window in the forest.

A chill ran down my spine.

I raised a shaking hand.

The me in the window raised one, too.

I turned my head slightly.

So did they.

I was about to step back—to run—when something changed.

The figure’s lips parted. A slow, stretching smile spread across its face. Too wide.

Then, ever so slightly, it shook its head.

I gasped and stumbled backward. My foot caught on a root, and I hit the ground hard, my hands scraping against damp earth. The moment I was out of view, the connection broke. I couldn’t see the bedroom anymore—just trees, rustling slightly in the wind.

My breath came in ragged bursts.

I pushed myself up and bolted, not stopping to look back.

But as I ran, a new, horrifying thought crept in:

What if, when I got home, I wasn’t the one waiting there?

I ran.

Branches whipped at my arms as I pushed through the undergrowth, feet slipping on the damp earth. My heartbeat pounded in my ears, my breath ragged. The forest felt darker now, the trees pressing in, shadows stretching longer than they should.

I kept expecting to hear footsteps behind me, but the woods were silent. Too silent. No wind. No birds. Just my own panicked breathing.

I didn’t stop until I reached my car.

It sat where I had left it, parked at the end of the trail, half-hidden by the overgrown brush. My hands shook as I yanked open the door and threw myself inside, slamming it shut behind me.

For a moment, I just sat there, gripping the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles turned white. My mind raced, trying to make sense of what I had seen.

It wasn’t possible.

It had to be some kind of trick.

Maybe I had inhaled something weird in the woods. Maybe there was some logical explanation—an optical illusion, a hallucination, anything other than what my gut was telling me.

That I had just seen myself.

And that it—whatever it was—had seen me too.

I forced a deep breath and turned the key. The engine rumbled to life, breaking the awful silence. My headlights flicked on, illuminating the trees ahead, casting long, skeletal shadows across the dirt path.

I didn’t look back.

The drive home was a blur.

I kept checking my rearview mirror, expecting to see something on the road behind me. A shape in the distance. A figure standing in the middle of the street.

But there was nothing. Just the empty highway stretching out behind me, the headlights cutting through the darkness.

By the time I pulled into my driveway, my nerves were raw.

My house looked the same as always—porch light glowing softly, curtains drawn over the windows. Familiar. Safe.

But the moment I stepped out of the car, I hesitated.

What if I was already inside?

The thought sent a shudder through me. It was irrational. Impossible. I had just imagined it.

Right?

I swallowed hard and walked up to the front door. My hands were clammy as I unlocked it and pushed it open.

The house was quiet.

I stepped inside, locking the door behind me. My ears strained for any sound, any sign that someone—or something—was here. But all I could hear was the soft hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen, the distant ticking of the clock in the hallway.

I let out a slow breath.

Everything was fine.

Still, my skin prickled as I made my way down the hall. My bedroom door was closed. It hadn’t been when I left.

I stood there, staring at it. My pulse pounded in my throat.

What if I opened that door and saw myself lying in bed?

I reached for the handle.

Turned it.

Pushed the door open.

The room was empty.

The bed was neatly made, the curtains drawn, the dim glow of the bedside lamp casting soft shadows over the walls. Exactly how I had left it.

My breath shuddered out of me. I felt stupid now, standing there in my own bedroom, shaken over nothing.

I was exhausted. My mind was playing tricks on me.

I closed the door behind me and sat on the edge of the bed, rubbing my face with my hands. The image of that thing in the window was burned into my brain. That smile. The way it had shaken its head, like it knew something I didn’t.

I needed to sleep.

I crawled under the covers and reached for my phone on the nightstand. The screen lit up.

And then, every nerve in my body went cold.

Because there was a notification.

A photo.

A new AirDrop request from an unknown sender.

My breath hitched. My thumb trembled as I opened it.

And there, staring back at me, was a photo of my bedroom. Taken from the doorway.

I whipped my head toward the door.

It was still closed.

But I wasn’t alone.

I couldn’t move.

My fingers clenched around my phone, my breath coming in short, shallow bursts. The photo on the screen—it wasn’t possible. I had just walked into my room. The door had been closed. Locked.

But someone—or something—had been standing right there, taking a picture.

I forced myself to look up, my eyes locked on the bedroom door. It was still closed. The brass handle gleamed in the dim light, perfectly still.

No one was there.

At least, no one I could see.

I swallowed hard, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. My mind raced through explanations. A prank? But who? The woods were miles away from anything, and I had been alone all day.

A hacker? But how would they have taken that picture?

My hands shook as I tapped the screen, heart hammering as I checked the AirDrop sender.

Unknown.

Of course.

I tapped the photo, zooming in, searching for anything—a shadow, a reflection, something that would give me a clue. But it was just my room. Empty. Like the photo had been taken a second before I entered.

A cold sweat prickled down my spine.

I needed to check the house.

I slid out of bed slowly, my bare feet touching the floor without a sound. Every nerve in my body screamed at me to stay put, to pretend I never saw the photo.

But I couldn’t ignore it.

I crept to the door and pressed my ear against it. Silence. Not even the hum of the refrigerator now. Just a thick, unnatural stillness.

I turned the knob.

The door creaked open.

The hallway was empty, bathed in soft shadows from the nightlight in the wall. My living room was just beyond, the kitchen tucked to the right. The air felt wrong, like the house was holding its breath.

I stepped out.

Every instinct told me something was here, something unseen, watching.

The floor was cool under my feet as I padded down the hall, scanning every dark corner, every doorway. The front door was locked. The windows were shut. Nothing seemed out of place.

But then I noticed something.

The curtain in the living room.

When I had left earlier that day, it had been open, letting in the soft afternoon light. Now it was drawn.

I stared at it, dread pooling in my stomach.

I took a step forward.

Another.

I reached out, hesitating just before touching the fabric. A single breath of cold air brushed against my hand.

Then—the curtain twitched.

I stumbled back, heart slamming against my ribs.

For a moment, nothing happened. The curtain hung still. Just fabric. Just my imagination.

Then, slowly, the fabric parted.

And behind it—

There was nothing.

Not a wall. Not a window. Just a pitch-black void.

I choked on a breath, my legs locked in place.

That wasn’t my window.

It wasn’t anything.

Just an endless, empty dark.

Then, from that darkness, something moved.

I didn’t wait to see what it was.

I ran.

I tore down the hall, feet barely touching the floor, throwing myself into my bedroom and slamming the door behind me.

My hands fumbled for the lock. Click.

I backed away, panting. My phone was still clutched in my hand, the screen glowing in the dim light. The photo was still open.

But now, there was a second picture.

My stomach turned to ice.

I didn’t AirDrop this.

I didn’t take this.

But there it was. A new photo, taken from the same doorway.

Except now, I was in the bed.

And standing over me—

Was a shadow.

Not a person. Not a shape I could define. Just wrongness. A smudge of black, featureless, leaning over my sleeping body.

The air in my lungs turned to stone.

My gaze darted to the bed.

It was empty. Untouched.

I looked back at the photo.

And this time—

The shadow’s head had turned.

It was looking at me.

I couldn’t breathe.

I wanted to scream, to move, to do something, but all I could do was stare at the photo.

At it.

That shadowy figure, that formless, wrong thing was no longer just standing over my sleeping body. It was facing me.

My fingers felt numb as I lowered the phone, forcing myself to look at my room.

The bed was still empty. The doorway was clear.

There was nothing there.

But that didn’t mean I was alone.

I swallowed hard, my throat dry, my ears straining for any sound. The house was silent. Not the normal, peaceful quiet of the night.

This silence felt heavy. Suffocating. Like something was waiting.

I needed to get out.

I turned, grabbing my bag from the chair. My car keys were inside. I just needed to make it to the front door, get in the car, and drive. Anywhere.

I reached for the doorknob.

The second my fingers touched it—

A sound.

Soft.

A creak.

Like weight shifting on the floor behind me.

I froze.

The bed was empty. I had checked. I knew it was empty.

But something was there now.

I turned my head just enough to glance at my phone’s screen.

The photo had changed again.

The shadow wasn’t over my bed anymore.

It was standing right behind me.

I spun around—

Nothing.

But my mirror—

The mirror on the far wall, the one across from my bed—

It wasn’t empty.

I was there. Standing. Staring.

But I wasn’t alone.

A shape loomed behind me.

Not quite touching.

Not quite human.

Just a mass of blackness, shifting, twisting, watching.

I barely had time to think before the lights flickered.

Then went out.

The darkness swallowed me whole.

I gasped, my heart hammering so hard I could feel it in my throat. My phone—the only light left—flickered too, the screen distorting, static warping the image.

I could still see my reflection.

And the thing behind me.

It was closer now.

So close that if it had a mouth, it could whisper in my ear.

I couldn’t breathe.

I squeezed my eyes shut, my fingers curling so tightly around my phone it hurt.

This isn’t real.

It couldn’t be.

I had to move.

I forced myself to take a step back, reaching for the wall, for the door, for anything solid.

My fingers found the handle.

I turned it.

The door wouldn’t open.

Something pressed against my back.

Not a hand. Not a body. Just pressure. Like the air itself had thickened, molding around me, holding me in place.

My reflection twitched.

My reflection smiled.

My reflection wasn’t me anymore.

The lights flickered back on.

And I was alone.

The pressure was gone. The room was silent again.

My legs nearly gave out as I stumbled away from the mirror, shoving my phone into my pocket, trying to catch my breath.

I had to go.

I didn’t care if the door was locked. I would break a window, run barefoot into the woods if I had to.

But when I turned back to the door—

It was open.

Just a crack.

And from the dark hallway beyond, something laughed.

A dry, rasping, inhuman sound.

I didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Didn’t breathe.

Then—

The door creaked open.

And I saw it.

Not a shadow this time. Not a reflection.

Something real.

Something that had been waiting.

And it was smiling at me.

I ran.

I didn’t think. Didn’t look back.

I ran.

The hallway stretched ahead of me, warped by shadows that flickered in the dim light. The walls felt too close, the air too thick. The thing behind me—whatever it was—was still there. Watching. Waiting.

But it wasn’t stopping me.

That was worse.

I didn’t care where I was going, just that I had to get out. Out of the house. Out of the town. Away from whatever had stepped through that window in the woods.

My hand slammed against the front door.

Unlocked.

I didn’t hesitate.

The night air hit me like a shock of cold water, but I didn’t stop. My car was pointless—keys still in my bag, bag still upstairs, and I wasn’t about to go back.

The only place left to go was the one place I never should have been in the first place.

The woods.

I sprinted across the yard, my lungs burning, my legs screaming. I didn’t care. The trees loomed ahead, dark and endless, swallowing the last bits of moonlight. My chest tightened at the thought of stepping back into them.

But I had no choice.

Because something was behind me.

I heard it. A slow, dragging step. Not running. Not chasing.

Because it didn’t have to.

I hit the treeline at full speed, branches clawing at my arms, twigs snapping beneath my feet. The deeper I went, the quieter the world became.

Like it was holding its breath.

I didn’t know where I was going. My phone was still in my pocket, but I wasn’t about to slow down and check the time. Or the messages. Or the camera.

Not after what I had seen.

The clearing.

That was the only answer.

I had to find it again.

I pushed forward, lungs burning, feet aching, my mind screaming at me to turn back—but there was nothing to turn back to.

The laughter followed me.

That dry, rasping sound. Closer now.

I bit down on a whimper, refusing to look back. I wasn’t fast enough. It was always right there.

A root caught my foot.

I hit the ground hard.

Pain shot up my arms, my palms scraping against rock and dirt. I gasped, trying to push myself up—

And then I saw it.

Ahead, in the distance.

The window.

Still standing in the clearing. Still wrong.

Still showing something I knew wasn’t real.

I scrambled to my feet, ignoring the way my body ached, the way my breath came in sharp, uneven gasps.

I had come back here for a reason.

I didn’t know what it was.

But something did.

The laughter stopped.

And I knew, without looking—

It was standing right behind me.

I didn’t want to turn around.

I knew it was there. I felt it. Close enough that if I moved too slowly, if I hesitated for even a second, it could reach out and—

No.

I couldn’t think about that.

The window was in front of me. Still standing in the clearing. Still impossible.

The scene inside hadn’t changed.

My bedroom. Exactly as I had left it.

Except for one thing.

The figure in my bed was sitting up now.

I could see its head tilt toward me. A shadowy blur, just out of focus.

I didn’t have time to think.

I ran straight for it.

My body slammed into the frame, and for a brief, impossible second, I thought I’d just crash through it. Fall forward into nothing. But instead—

The world snapped.

A cold rush of air sucked the breath from my lungs, like I was being pulled through a vacuum. My ears popped, and everything went silent. My vision fractured, like looking through broken glass—flashes of movement, color, but nothing that made sense.

Then—

I hit the floor.

Hard.

My limbs tangled beneath me, and I gasped as the air punched from my chest. The world spun. My head throbbed. The silence stretched out, thick and unnatural, pressing in from every direction.

I forced myself to sit up, blinking against the disorientation.

And then I saw it.

I was home.

Or—

It looked like home.

I was sitting on my bedroom floor, facing the bed. The sheets were rumpled, just like they had been when I left. My phone was still on the nightstand, its screen dark. The window in the wall showed the same quiet neighborhood street.

For a second, I almost believed it.

Then my eyes landed on the door.

It was wrong.

Slightly too tall. The edges too sharp.

And the shadows beneath it—

They moved.

A slow, pulsing shift, as if something on the other side was breathing.

I pushed myself to my feet. My hands were shaking. I didn’t know what I had expected, but I knew this wasn’t right.

I turned back to the window, hoping—praying—that I could step through it again.

But it was gone.

Just a blank wall.

Like it had never been there at all.

A soft creak behind me.

I spun around, heart slamming against my ribs.

The door had opened.

Not all the way. Just enough to show the darkened hallway beyond.

And in that hallway, something stood waiting.

Not moving. Not breathing.

Just watching.

I swallowed hard. My throat was dry, my pulse hammering in my ears.

I wasn’t in my house.

Not anymore.

And whatever was in here with me—

It knew.

I didn’t move.

Neither did it.

The figure in the hallway was just standing there, its shape obscured by shadows. Too tall. Too still.

Then—

It tilted its head.

A slow, deliberate motion. Not human. Not natural. Like it was trying to understand me.

Something deep inside me screamed to run. But I didn’t.

Because behind me, from the wall where the window should have been, a voice whispered—

“Don’t.”

I stiffened. My breath caught in my throat.

It was my voice.

I turned my head slightly, just enough to see the mirror hanging on the far wall.

Except—

It wasn’t just a reflection.

I was standing in it.

My reflection was looking at me—but its lips were moving on their own.

“Don’t run. It wants you to.”

The thing in the hallway took a step forward.

I flinched. My reflection didn’t.

“It plays by rules.” The whisper came again. “Play back.”

Rules.

I swallowed hard, my mind racing.

Everything here was wrong, but it had structure. The window had worked like a portal. The door had opened when I acknowledged it. And this… thing… was waiting for me to react.

Like a game.

I looked at my reflection, meeting my own eyes. “What do I do?” I mouthed.

The other me smiled.

Not a reassuring smile. Not comforting.

It was a grin full of knowing.

“Use the board.”

I frowned. The board?

I glanced back at the room. My room. Everything was identical to how I’d left it. My bed, my phone, my desk—

Then I saw it.

My chessboard.

It was set up on my desk, mid-game. The last match I’d played against myself. White’s move.

I didn’t have time to question it.

I walked toward it slowly, forcing my breathing to stay even. Behind me, I could hear the thing in the hallway shifting, its movements slow, patient.

Waiting.

I reached the desk and studied the board. My last move had left my queen exposed. If I was playing against myself, I’d take it with a knight.

I lifted the black knight and moved it.

As soon as I let go, the door slammed shut.

A gust of air rattled through the room, making the walls tremble.

I turned back toward the mirror. My reflection was nodding.

“Good.”

The ground beneath me shuddered. The walls stretched, as if the entire room was breathing. The air grew thick, heavy, pressing in on me.

Another piece had moved on the board. Not by me.

Black pawn, two spaces forward.

My turn again.

A sick realization settled in my stomach.

I wasn’t playing alone.

I turned toward the door.

The thing in the hallway—whatever it was—was still there. Except now… it was smiling too.

I exhaled slowly and faced the board again.

If this was a game—

I had to win.

I didn’t look up from the board. I didn’t dare.

Whatever was in the hallway wanted me to react, and I wasn’t going to give it the satisfaction.

I studied the pieces, my hands clammy as I reached for my next move.

Pawn to e4.

I let go.

The second I did, the entire room lurched sideways, like the floor itself had tipped.

I staggered, barely keeping my balance as my stomach twisted from the shift. My desk dragged itself a few inches closer to the mirror. The air pulsed like a heartbeat, thick and suffocating.

Behind me, I could hear the thing move. Its footsteps didn’t match the floor. Like it wasn’t walking on wood, but something else entirely. Something wet. Something alive.

I clenched my jaw and looked at the board.

The next move had already been made.

A knight, creeping closer to my king.

I swallowed.

It was testing me.

I slid my fingers over a bishop, considering my options. If I took the knight, I’d expose my queen. If I moved my queen, I’d leave my king vulnerable.

Every move had a consequence.

I glanced at the mirror. My reflection was still watching, but its expression had changed.

No more grin. No amusement.

It looked worried.

That made two of us.

I shifted my bishop forward, threatening the knight. As soon as I let go, the room shuddered again.

The door to the hallway slowly creaked back open.

And the thing in the shadows stepped inside.

I gripped the edge of my desk so hard my knuckles turned white.

It was closer now. I still couldn’t see its face—if it even had one—but its shape was wrong. Its limbs were too long, its spine curved unnaturally. And worst of all, I could hear it breathing.

Deep, wet gasps. Like it was trying to taste the air.

I forced my eyes back to the board.

The game wasn’t over. I could still win.

The pieces rattled. Another had moved—on its own.

The knight was now right next to my king.

I was running out of time.

My reflection in the mirror shook its head.

Wrong move.

A chill crawled up my spine.

I turned back to the board, my heartbeat pounding in my ears.

I had to think. Had to be smart.

If this was a game, there was always a way out.

I looked at my pieces. Then I looked at my opponent’s.

And finally, I realized—

I wasn’t playing to win.

I was playing to survive.

The rules had been clear from the start. Every move I made changed the room. Changed what was coming for me.

But if I didn’t move—if I refused to play—

What happened then?

The thing in the room took another step closer.

I clenched my fists.

Then, for the first time since the game started—

I did nothing.

And the room went silent.

The silence pressed in on me, thick and absolute.

I didn’t move.

The thing in the room didn’t either.

The only sound was my own heartbeat, hammering inside my chest like it was trying to escape.

I kept my hands in my lap, fingers curled so tight they ached. My eyes flicked to the board.

No new moves.

The pieces remained frozen where they were. The knight still loomed over my king. A checkmate waiting to happen.

But it hadn’t happened yet.

The thing in the room shifted. I could hear it, the slow creak of weight pressing into the floor. The wet, dragging breaths—just behind me now. Close enough that I could feel the air change. Feel the cold creeping over my skin.

I kept my eyes down.

If I reacted, I’d lose.

My reflection in the mirror still watched, but something had changed. It wasn’t mirroring me anymore. It was moving on its own.

It raised its hand and tapped a finger against its temple.

Think.

I swallowed.

Then, slowly, I leaned forward and stared at the board.

There had to be something I was missing.

The game was still going. The thing in the room was still waiting.

Waiting for me to make the next move.

I studied the pieces. My opponent’s side.

And then—I saw it.

The one piece I hadn’t been paying attention to.

The king.

Not my king.

Theirs.

I inhaled sharply.

This wasn’t about survival. It never had been.

It was about winning.

And there was only one way to do that.

I reached out, slow and steady.

The thing in the room lurched forward.

I ignored it.

My fingers closed around my queen. I moved her.

The second I let go—

Checkmate.

The room convulsed.

A sound ripped through the air—something high-pitched and wrong, like metal scraping against bone. The walls blurred, folding in on themselves like paper. My desk split in half, the mirror cracked—

And the thing in the room—

It screamed.

Not a sound of pain.

A sound of rage.

I squeezed my eyes shut, gripping the edge of the table as the world collapsed around me.

And then—

Silence.

A different kind this time. Not heavy, not pressing.

Just... empty.

I opened my eyes.

The board was gone.

The room was normal again.

And I was alone.

At least, that’s what I thought.

Until I saw the mirror.

The reflection inside it?

It was still playing the game.

And this time—

It wasn’t me sitting in the chair.",1,1739476565.0,stories,0,1.0,False
1iorxd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iorxd3/the_window/,The Window,"My boots crunched over damp leaves as I followed the winding trail deeper into the woods. The air smelled of moss and earth, thick with the scent of rain that had passed through earlier in the day. I was supposed to stick to the main path, but curiosity had gotten the better of me.

The forest was quiet. Too quiet.

I had hiked these woods before, but I had never seen this clearing.

The trees parted around it, their skeletal branches curling inward like fingers. The grass was overgrown, patches of wildflowers dotting the landscape. But none of that mattered—because in the very center of the clearing stood a window.

Just a frame. No glass.

It was tall and weathered, the paint long stripped away by time. It looked like it had been ripped from an old house and placed here, upright, with no walls to support it.

My stomach twisted. Something about it felt… wrong.

I stepped closer.

From this side, I saw only the forest beyond. Trees stretched toward the sky, the same as before. But when I moved—just slightly—so that I was directly in front of it…

I stopped breathing.

Through the empty frame, I saw my bedroom.

Not just a bedroom that looked like mine. My bedroom.

The familiar bookshelf stood against the far wall, overflowing with half-read novels and trinkets. My desk, cluttered with notes and empty coffee cups, sat beside it. The curtains were drawn, the dim glow of my bedside lamp casting long shadows over the walls.

And there, lying in bed, was me.

I stumbled back, my heartbeat slamming against my ribs. My mind scrambled for a rational explanation, but nothing made sense. I wasn’t dreaming—I could feel the cool air on my skin, the dampness from the earlier rain still clinging to my jacket.

I took another step forward, peering through the frame again. The scene hadn’t changed.

The figure—I—was still there, curled under the covers. My chest rose and fell with steady breaths, my head turned slightly toward the window. But then, as I watched…

I opened my eyes.

Not the me standing here.

The me in the bed.

I stared at myself, and myself stared back.

The figure in the bed didn’t move. Just lay there, eyes wide, locked onto mine through the window in the forest.

A chill ran down my spine.

I raised a shaking hand.

The me in the window raised one, too.

I turned my head slightly.

So did they.

I was about to step back—to run—when something changed.

The figure’s lips parted. A slow, stretching smile spread across its face. Too wide.

Then, ever so slightly, it shook its head.

I gasped and stumbled backward. My foot caught on a root, and I hit the ground hard, my hands scraping against damp earth. The moment I was out of view, the connection broke. I couldn’t see the bedroom anymore—just trees, rustling slightly in the wind.

My breath came in ragged bursts.

I pushed myself up and bolted, not stopping to look back.

But as I ran, a new, horrifying thought crept in:

What if, when I got home, I wasn’t the one waiting there?

I ran.

Branches whipped at my arms as I pushed through the undergrowth, feet slipping on the damp earth. My heartbeat pounded in my ears, my breath ragged. The forest felt darker now, the trees pressing in, shadows stretching longer than they should.

I kept expecting to hear footsteps behind me, but the woods were silent. Too silent. No wind. No birds. Just my own panicked breathing.

I didn’t stop until I reached my car.

It sat where I had left it, parked at the end of the trail, half-hidden by the overgrown brush. My hands shook as I yanked open the door and threw myself inside, slamming it shut behind me.

For a moment, I just sat there, gripping the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles turned white. My mind raced, trying to make sense of what I had seen.

It wasn’t possible.

It had to be some kind of trick.

Maybe I had inhaled something weird in the woods. Maybe there was some logical explanation—an optical illusion, a hallucination, anything other than what my gut was telling me.

That I had just seen myself.

And that it—whatever it was—had seen me too.

I forced a deep breath and turned the key. The engine rumbled to life, breaking the awful silence. My headlights flicked on, illuminating the trees ahead, casting long, skeletal shadows across the dirt path.

I didn’t look back.

The drive home was a blur.

I kept checking my rearview mirror, expecting to see something on the road behind me. A shape in the distance. A figure standing in the middle of the street.

But there was nothing. Just the empty highway stretching out behind me, the headlights cutting through the darkness.

By the time I pulled into my driveway, my nerves were raw.

My house looked the same as always—porch light glowing softly, curtains drawn over the windows. Familiar. Safe.

But the moment I stepped out of the car, I hesitated.

What if I was already inside?

The thought sent a shudder through me. It was irrational. Impossible. I had just imagined it.

Right?

I swallowed hard and walked up to the front door. My hands were clammy as I unlocked it and pushed it open.

The house was quiet.

I stepped inside, locking the door behind me. My ears strained for any sound, any sign that someone—or something—was here. But all I could hear was the soft hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen, the distant ticking of the clock in the hallway.

I let out a slow breath.

Everything was fine.

Still, my skin prickled as I made my way down the hall. My bedroom door was closed. It hadn’t been when I left.

I stood there, staring at it. My pulse pounded in my throat.

What if I opened that door and saw myself lying in bed?

I reached for the handle.

Turned it.

Pushed the door open.

The room was empty.

The bed was neatly made, the curtains drawn, the dim glow of the bedside lamp casting soft shadows over the walls. Exactly how I had left it.

My breath shuddered out of me. I felt stupid now, standing there in my own bedroom, shaken over nothing.

I was exhausted. My mind was playing tricks on me.

I closed the door behind me and sat on the edge of the bed, rubbing my face with my hands. The image of that thing in the window was burned into my brain. That smile. The way it had shaken its head, like it knew something I didn’t.

I needed to sleep.

I crawled under the covers and reached for my phone on the nightstand. The screen lit up.

And then, every nerve in my body went cold.

Because there was a notification.

A photo.

A new AirDrop request from an unknown sender.

My breath hitched. My thumb trembled as I opened it.

And there, staring back at me, was a photo of my bedroom. Taken from the doorway.

I whipped my head toward the door.

It was still closed.

But I wasn’t alone.

I couldn’t move.

My fingers clenched around my phone, my breath coming in short, shallow bursts. The photo on the screen—it wasn’t possible. I had just walked into my room. The door had been closed. Locked.

But someone—or something—had been standing right there, taking a picture.

I forced myself to look up, my eyes locked on the bedroom door. It was still closed. The brass handle gleamed in the dim light, perfectly still.

No one was there.

At least, no one I could see.

I swallowed hard, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. My mind raced through explanations. A prank? But who? The woods were miles away from anything, and I had been alone all day.

A hacker? But how would they have taken that picture?

My hands shook as I tapped the screen, heart hammering as I checked the AirDrop sender.

Unknown.

Of course.

I tapped the photo, zooming in, searching for anything—a shadow, a reflection, something that would give me a clue. But it was just my room. Empty. Like the photo had been taken a second before I entered.

A cold sweat prickled down my spine.

I needed to check the house.

I slid out of bed slowly, my bare feet touching the floor without a sound. Every nerve in my body screamed at me to stay put, to pretend I never saw the photo.

But I couldn’t ignore it.

I crept to the door and pressed my ear against it. Silence. Not even the hum of the refrigerator now. Just a thick, unnatural stillness.

I turned the knob.

The door creaked open.

The hallway was empty, bathed in soft shadows from the nightlight in the wall. My living room was just beyond, the kitchen tucked to the right. The air felt wrong, like the house was holding its breath.

I stepped out.

Every instinct told me something was here, something unseen, watching.

The floor was cool under my feet as I padded down the hall, scanning every dark corner, every doorway. The front door was locked. The windows were shut. Nothing seemed out of place.

But then I noticed something.

The curtain in the living room.

When I had left earlier that day, it had been open, letting in the soft afternoon light. Now it was drawn.

I stared at it, dread pooling in my stomach.

I took a step forward.

Another.

I reached out, hesitating just before touching the fabric. A single breath of cold air brushed against my hand.

Then—the curtain twitched.

I stumbled back, heart slamming against my ribs.

For a moment, nothing happened. The curtain hung still. Just fabric. Just my imagination.

Then, slowly, the fabric parted.

And behind it—

There was nothing.

Not a wall. Not a window. Just a pitch-black void.

I choked on a breath, my legs locked in place.

That wasn’t my window.

It wasn’t anything.

Just an endless, empty dark.

Then, from that darkness, something moved.

I didn’t wait to see what it was.

I ran.

I tore down the hall, feet barely touching the floor, throwing myself into my bedroom and slamming the door behind me.

My hands fumbled for the lock. Click.

I backed away, panting. My phone was still clutched in my hand, the screen glowing in the dim light. The photo was still open.

But now, there was a second picture.

My stomach turned to ice.

I didn’t AirDrop this.

I didn’t take this.

But there it was. A new photo, taken from the same doorway.

Except now, I was in the bed.

And standing over me—

Was a shadow.

Not a person. Not a shape I could define. Just wrongness. A smudge of black, featureless, leaning over my sleeping body.

The air in my lungs turned to stone.

My gaze darted to the bed.

It was empty. Untouched.

I looked back at the photo.

And this time—

The shadow’s head had turned.

It was looking at me.

I couldn’t breathe.

I wanted to scream, to move, to do something, but all I could do was stare at the photo.

At it.

That shadowy figure, that formless, wrong thing was no longer just standing over my sleeping body. It was facing me.

My fingers felt numb as I lowered the phone, forcing myself to look at my room.

The bed was still empty. The doorway was clear.

There was nothing there.

But that didn’t mean I was alone.

I swallowed hard, my throat dry, my ears straining for any sound. The house was silent. Not the normal, peaceful quiet of the night.

This silence felt heavy. Suffocating. Like something was waiting.

I needed to get out.

I turned, grabbing my bag from the chair. My car keys were inside. I just needed to make it to the front door, get in the car, and drive. Anywhere.

I reached for the doorknob.

The second my fingers touched it—

A sound.

Soft.

A creak.

Like weight shifting on the floor behind me.

I froze.

The bed was empty. I had checked. I knew it was empty.

But something was there now.

I turned my head just enough to glance at my phone’s screen.

The photo had changed again.

The shadow wasn’t over my bed anymore.

It was standing right behind me.

I spun around—

Nothing.

But my mirror—

The mirror on the far wall, the one across from my bed—

It wasn’t empty.

I was there. Standing. Staring.

But I wasn’t alone.

A shape loomed behind me.

Not quite touching.

Not quite human.

Just a mass of blackness, shifting, twisting, watching.

I barely had time to think before the lights flickered.

Then went out.

The darkness swallowed me whole.

I gasped, my heart hammering so hard I could feel it in my throat. My phone—the only light left—flickered too, the screen distorting, static warping the image.

I could still see my reflection.

And the thing behind me.

It was closer now.

So close that if it had a mouth, it could whisper in my ear.

I couldn’t breathe.

I squeezed my eyes shut, my fingers curling so tightly around my phone it hurt.

This isn’t real.

It couldn’t be.

I had to move.

I forced myself to take a step back, reaching for the wall, for the door, for anything solid.

My fingers found the handle.

I turned it.

The door wouldn’t open.

Something pressed against my back.

Not a hand. Not a body. Just pressure. Like the air itself had thickened, molding around me, holding me in place.

My reflection twitched.

My reflection smiled.

My reflection wasn’t me anymore.

The lights flickered back on.

And I was alone.

The pressure was gone. The room was silent again.

My legs nearly gave out as I stumbled away from the mirror, shoving my phone into my pocket, trying to catch my breath.

I had to go.

I didn’t care if the door was locked. I would break a window, run barefoot into the woods if I had to.

But when I turned back to the door—

It was open.

Just a crack.

And from the dark hallway beyond, something laughed.

A dry, rasping, inhuman sound.

I didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Didn’t breathe.

Then—

The door creaked open.

And I saw it.

Not a shadow this time. Not a reflection.

Something real.

Something that had been waiting.

And it was smiling at me.

I ran.

I didn’t think. Didn’t look back.

I ran.

The hallway stretched ahead of me, warped by shadows that flickered in the dim light. The walls felt too close, the air too thick. The thing behind me—whatever it was—was still there. Watching. Waiting.

But it wasn’t stopping me.

That was worse.

I didn’t care where I was going, just that I had to get out. Out of the house. Out of the town. Away from whatever had stepped through that window in the woods.

My hand slammed against the front door.

Unlocked.

I didn’t hesitate.

The night air hit me like a shock of cold water, but I didn’t stop. My car was pointless—keys still in my bag, bag still upstairs, and I wasn’t about to go back.

The only place left to go was the one place I never should have been in the first place.

The woods.

I sprinted across the yard, my lungs burning, my legs screaming. I didn’t care. The trees loomed ahead, dark and endless, swallowing the last bits of moonlight. My chest tightened at the thought of stepping back into them.

But I had no choice.

Because something was behind me.

I heard it. A slow, dragging step. Not running. Not chasing.

Because it didn’t have to.

I hit the treeline at full speed, branches clawing at my arms, twigs snapping beneath my feet. The deeper I went, the quieter the world became.

Like it was holding its breath.

I didn’t know where I was going. My phone was still in my pocket, but I wasn’t about to slow down and check the time. Or the messages. Or the camera.

Not after what I had seen.

The clearing.

That was the only answer.

I had to find it again.

I pushed forward, lungs burning, feet aching, my mind screaming at me to turn back—but there was nothing to turn back to.

The laughter followed me.

That dry, rasping sound. Closer now.

I bit down on a whimper, refusing to look back. I wasn’t fast enough. It was always right there.

A root caught my foot.

I hit the ground hard.

Pain shot up my arms, my palms scraping against rock and dirt. I gasped, trying to push myself up—

And then I saw it.

Ahead, in the distance.

The window.

Still standing in the clearing. Still wrong.

Still showing something I knew wasn’t real.

I scrambled to my feet, ignoring the way my body ached, the way my breath came in sharp, uneven gasps.

I had come back here for a reason.

I didn’t know what it was.

But something did.

The laughter stopped.

And I knew, without looking—

It was standing right behind me.

I didn’t want to turn around.

I knew it was there. I felt it. Close enough that if I moved too slowly, if I hesitated for even a second, it could reach out and—

No.

I couldn’t think about that.

The window was in front of me. Still standing in the clearing. Still impossible.

The scene inside hadn’t changed.

My bedroom. Exactly as I had left it.

Except for one thing.

The figure in my bed was sitting up now.

I could see its head tilt toward me. A shadowy blur, just out of focus.

I didn’t have time to think.

I ran straight for it.

My body slammed into the frame, and for a brief, impossible second, I thought I’d just crash through it. Fall forward into nothing. But instead—

The world snapped.

A cold rush of air sucked the breath from my lungs, like I was being pulled through a vacuum. My ears popped, and everything went silent. My vision fractured, like looking through broken glass—flashes of movement, color, but nothing that made sense.

Then—

I hit the floor.

Hard.

My limbs tangled beneath me, and I gasped as the air punched from my chest. The world spun. My head throbbed. The silence stretched out, thick and unnatural, pressing in from every direction.

I forced myself to sit up, blinking against the disorientation.

And then I saw it.

I was home.

Or—

It looked like home.

I was sitting on my bedroom floor, facing the bed. The sheets were rumpled, just like they had been when I left. My phone was still on the nightstand, its screen dark. The window in the wall showed the same quiet neighborhood street.

For a second, I almost believed it.

Then my eyes landed on the door.

It was wrong.

Slightly too tall. The edges too sharp.

And the shadows beneath it—

They moved.

A slow, pulsing shift, as if something on the other side was breathing.

I pushed myself to my feet. My hands were shaking. I didn’t know what I had expected, but I knew this wasn’t right.

I turned back to the window, hoping—praying—that I could step through it again.

But it was gone.

Just a blank wall.

Like it had never been there at all.

A soft creak behind me.

I spun around, heart slamming against my ribs.

The door had opened.

Not all the way. Just enough to show the darkened hallway beyond.

And in that hallway, something stood waiting.

Not moving. Not breathing.

Just watching.

I swallowed hard. My throat was dry, my pulse hammering in my ears.

I wasn’t in my house.

Not anymore.

And whatever was in here with me—

It knew.

I didn’t move.

Neither did it.

The figure in the hallway was just standing there, its shape obscured by shadows. Too tall. Too still.

Then—

It tilted its head.

A slow, deliberate motion. Not human. Not natural. Like it was trying to understand me.

Something deep inside me screamed to run. But I didn’t.

Because behind me, from the wall where the window should have been, a voice whispered—

“Don’t.”

I stiffened. My breath caught in my throat.

It was my voice.

I turned my head slightly, just enough to see the mirror hanging on the far wall.

Except—

It wasn’t just a reflection.

I was standing in it.

My reflection was looking at me—but its lips were moving on their own.

“Don’t run. It wants you to.”

The thing in the hallway took a step forward.

I flinched. My reflection didn’t.

“It plays by rules.” The whisper came again. “Play back.”

Rules.

I swallowed hard, my mind racing.

Everything here was wrong, but it had structure. The window had worked like a portal. The door had opened when I acknowledged it. And this… thing… was waiting for me to react.

Like a game.

I looked at my reflection, meeting my own eyes. “What do I do?” I mouthed.

The other me smiled.

Not a reassuring smile. Not comforting.

It was a grin full of knowing.

“Use the board.”

I frowned. The board?

I glanced back at the room. My room. Everything was identical to how I’d left it. My bed, my phone, my desk—

Then I saw it.

My chessboard.

It was set up on my desk, mid-game. The last match I’d played against myself. White’s move.

I didn’t have time to question it.

I walked toward it slowly, forcing my breathing to stay even. Behind me, I could hear the thing in the hallway shifting, its movements slow, patient.

Waiting.

I reached the desk and studied the board. My last move had left my queen exposed. If I was playing against myself, I’d take it with a knight.

I lifted the black knight and moved it.

As soon as I let go, the door slammed shut.

A gust of air rattled through the room, making the walls tremble.

I turned back toward the mirror. My reflection was nodding.

“Good.”

The ground beneath me shuddered. The walls stretched, as if the entire room was breathing. The air grew thick, heavy, pressing in on me.

Another piece had moved on the board. Not by me.

Black pawn, two spaces forward.

My turn again.

A sick realization settled in my stomach.

I wasn’t playing alone.

I turned toward the door.

The thing in the hallway—whatever it was—was still there. Except now… it was smiling too.

I exhaled slowly and faced the board again.

If this was a game—

I had to win.

I didn’t look up from the board. I didn’t dare.

Whatever was in the hallway wanted me to react, and I wasn’t going to give it the satisfaction.

I studied the pieces, my hands clammy as I reached for my next move.

Pawn to e4.

I let go.

The second I did, the entire room lurched sideways, like the floor itself had tipped.

I staggered, barely keeping my balance as my stomach twisted from the shift. My desk dragged itself a few inches closer to the mirror. The air pulsed like a heartbeat, thick and suffocating.

Behind me, I could hear the thing move. Its footsteps didn’t match the floor. Like it wasn’t walking on wood, but something else entirely. Something wet. Something alive.

I clenched my jaw and looked at the board.

The next move had already been made.

A knight, creeping closer to my king.

I swallowed.

It was testing me.

I slid my fingers over a bishop, considering my options. If I took the knight, I’d expose my queen. If I moved my queen, I’d leave my king vulnerable.

Every move had a consequence.

I glanced at the mirror. My reflection was still watching, but its expression had changed.

No more grin. No amusement.

It looked worried.

That made two of us.

I shifted my bishop forward, threatening the knight. As soon as I let go, the room shuddered again.

The door to the hallway slowly creaked back open.

And the thing in the shadows stepped inside.

I gripped the edge of my desk so hard my knuckles turned white.

It was closer now. I still couldn’t see its face—if it even had one—but its shape was wrong. Its limbs were too long, its spine curved unnaturally. And worst of all, I could hear it breathing.

Deep, wet gasps. Like it was trying to taste the air.

I forced my eyes back to the board.

The game wasn’t over. I could still win.

The pieces rattled. Another had moved—on its own.

The knight was now right next to my king.

I was running out of time.

My reflection in the mirror shook its head.

Wrong move.

A chill crawled up my spine.

I turned back to the board, my heartbeat pounding in my ears.

I had to think. Had to be smart.

If this was a game, there was always a way out.

I looked at my pieces. Then I looked at my opponent’s.

And finally, I realized—

I wasn’t playing to win.

I was playing to survive.

The rules had been clear from the start. Every move I made changed the room. Changed what was coming for me.

But if I didn’t move—if I refused to play—

What happened then?

The thing in the room took another step closer.

I clenched my fists.

Then, for the first time since the game started—

I did nothing.

And the room went silent.

The silence pressed in on me, thick and absolute.

I didn’t move.

The thing in the room didn’t either.

The only sound was my own heartbeat, hammering inside my chest like it was trying to escape.

I kept my hands in my lap, fingers curled so tight they ached. My eyes flicked to the board.

No new moves.

The pieces remained frozen where they were. The knight still loomed over my king. A checkmate waiting to happen.

But it hadn’t happened yet.

The thing in the room shifted. I could hear it, the slow creak of weight pressing into the floor. The wet, dragging breaths—just behind me now. Close enough that I could feel the air change. Feel the cold creeping over my skin.

I kept my eyes down.

If I reacted, I’d lose.

My reflection in the mirror still watched, but something had changed. It wasn’t mirroring me anymore. It was moving on its own.

It raised its hand and tapped a finger against its temple.

Think.

I swallowed.

Then, slowly, I leaned forward and stared at the board.

There had to be something I was missing.

The game was still going. The thing in the room was still waiting.

Waiting for me to make the next move.

I studied the pieces. My opponent’s side.

And then—I saw it.

The one piece I hadn’t been paying attention to.

The king.

Not my king.

Theirs.

I inhaled sharply.

This wasn’t about survival. It never had been.

It was about winning.

And there was only one way to do that.

I reached out, slow and steady.

The thing in the room lurched forward.

I ignored it.

My fingers closed around my queen. I moved her.

The second I let go—

Checkmate.

The room convulsed.

A sound ripped through the air—something high-pitched and wrong, like metal scraping against bone. The walls blurred, folding in on themselves like paper. My desk split in half, the mirror cracked—

And the thing in the room—

It screamed.

Not a sound of pain.

A sound of rage.

I squeezed my eyes shut, gripping the edge of the table as the world collapsed around me.

And then—

Silence.

A different kind this time. Not heavy, not pressing.

Just... empty.

I opened my eyes.

The board was gone.

The room was normal again.

And I was alone.

At least, that’s what I thought.

Until I saw the mirror.

The reflection inside it?

It was still playing the game.

And this time—

It wasn’t me sitting in the chair.",1,1739476552.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1iorx4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1iorx4z/the_window/,The Window,"My boots crunched over damp leaves as I followed the winding trail deeper into the woods. The air smelled of moss and earth, thick with the scent of rain that had passed through earlier in the day. I was supposed to stick to the main path, but curiosity had gotten the better of me.

The forest was quiet. Too quiet.

I had hiked these woods before, but I had never seen this clearing.

The trees parted around it, their skeletal branches curling inward like fingers. The grass was overgrown, patches of wildflowers dotting the landscape. But none of that mattered—because in the very center of the clearing stood a window.

Just a frame. No glass.

It was tall and weathered, the paint long stripped away by time. It looked like it had been ripped from an old house and placed here, upright, with no walls to support it.

My stomach twisted. Something about it felt… wrong.

I stepped closer.

From this side, I saw only the forest beyond. Trees stretched toward the sky, the same as before. But when I moved—just slightly—so that I was directly in front of it…

I stopped breathing.

Through the empty frame, I saw my bedroom.

Not just a bedroom that looked like mine. My bedroom.

The familiar bookshelf stood against the far wall, overflowing with half-read novels and trinkets. My desk, cluttered with notes and empty coffee cups, sat beside it. The curtains were drawn, the dim glow of my bedside lamp casting long shadows over the walls.

And there, lying in bed, was me.

I stumbled back, my heartbeat slamming against my ribs. My mind scrambled for a rational explanation, but nothing made sense. I wasn’t dreaming—I could feel the cool air on my skin, the dampness from the earlier rain still clinging to my jacket.

I took another step forward, peering through the frame again. The scene hadn’t changed.

The figure—I—was still there, curled under the covers. My chest rose and fell with steady breaths, my head turned slightly toward the window. But then, as I watched…

I opened my eyes.

Not the me standing here.

The me in the bed.

I stared at myself, and myself stared back.

The figure in the bed didn’t move. Just lay there, eyes wide, locked onto mine through the window in the forest.

A chill ran down my spine.

I raised a shaking hand.

The me in the window raised one, too.

I turned my head slightly.

So did they.

I was about to step back—to run—when something changed.

The figure’s lips parted. A slow, stretching smile spread across its face. Too wide.

Then, ever so slightly, it shook its head.

I gasped and stumbled backward. My foot caught on a root, and I hit the ground hard, my hands scraping against damp earth. The moment I was out of view, the connection broke. I couldn’t see the bedroom anymore—just trees, rustling slightly in the wind.

My breath came in ragged bursts.

I pushed myself up and bolted, not stopping to look back.

But as I ran, a new, horrifying thought crept in:

What if, when I got home, I wasn’t the one waiting there?

I ran.

Branches whipped at my arms as I pushed through the undergrowth, feet slipping on the damp earth. My heartbeat pounded in my ears, my breath ragged. The forest felt darker now, the trees pressing in, shadows stretching longer than they should.

I kept expecting to hear footsteps behind me, but the woods were silent. Too silent. No wind. No birds. Just my own panicked breathing.

I didn’t stop until I reached my car.

It sat where I had left it, parked at the end of the trail, half-hidden by the overgrown brush. My hands shook as I yanked open the door and threw myself inside, slamming it shut behind me.

For a moment, I just sat there, gripping the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles turned white. My mind raced, trying to make sense of what I had seen.

It wasn’t possible.

It had to be some kind of trick.

Maybe I had inhaled something weird in the woods. Maybe there was some logical explanation—an optical illusion, a hallucination, anything other than what my gut was telling me.

That I had just seen myself.

And that it—whatever it was—had seen me too.

I forced a deep breath and turned the key. The engine rumbled to life, breaking the awful silence. My headlights flicked on, illuminating the trees ahead, casting long, skeletal shadows across the dirt path.

I didn’t look back.

The drive home was a blur.

I kept checking my rearview mirror, expecting to see something on the road behind me. A shape in the distance. A figure standing in the middle of the street.

But there was nothing. Just the empty highway stretching out behind me, the headlights cutting through the darkness.

By the time I pulled into my driveway, my nerves were raw.

My house looked the same as always—porch light glowing softly, curtains drawn over the windows. Familiar. Safe.

But the moment I stepped out of the car, I hesitated.

What if I was already inside?

The thought sent a shudder through me. It was irrational. Impossible. I had just imagined it.

Right?

I swallowed hard and walked up to the front door. My hands were clammy as I unlocked it and pushed it open.

The house was quiet.

I stepped inside, locking the door behind me. My ears strained for any sound, any sign that someone—or something—was here. But all I could hear was the soft hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen, the distant ticking of the clock in the hallway.

I let out a slow breath.

Everything was fine.

Still, my skin prickled as I made my way down the hall. My bedroom door was closed. It hadn’t been when I left.

I stood there, staring at it. My pulse pounded in my throat.

What if I opened that door and saw myself lying in bed?

I reached for the handle.

Turned it.

Pushed the door open.

The room was empty.

The bed was neatly made, the curtains drawn, the dim glow of the bedside lamp casting soft shadows over the walls. Exactly how I had left it.

My breath shuddered out of me. I felt stupid now, standing there in my own bedroom, shaken over nothing.

I was exhausted. My mind was playing tricks on me.

I closed the door behind me and sat on the edge of the bed, rubbing my face with my hands. The image of that thing in the window was burned into my brain. That smile. The way it had shaken its head, like it knew something I didn’t.

I needed to sleep.

I crawled under the covers and reached for my phone on the nightstand. The screen lit up.

And then, every nerve in my body went cold.

Because there was a notification.

A photo.

A new AirDrop request from an unknown sender.

My breath hitched. My thumb trembled as I opened it.

And there, staring back at me, was a photo of my bedroom. Taken from the doorway.

I whipped my head toward the door.

It was still closed.

But I wasn’t alone.

I couldn’t move.

My fingers clenched around my phone, my breath coming in short, shallow bursts. The photo on the screen—it wasn’t possible. I had just walked into my room. The door had been closed. Locked.

But someone—or something—had been standing right there, taking a picture.

I forced myself to look up, my eyes locked on the bedroom door. It was still closed. The brass handle gleamed in the dim light, perfectly still.

No one was there.

At least, no one I could see.

I swallowed hard, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. My mind raced through explanations. A prank? But who? The woods were miles away from anything, and I had been alone all day.

A hacker? But how would they have taken that picture?

My hands shook as I tapped the screen, heart hammering as I checked the AirDrop sender.

Unknown.

Of course.

I tapped the photo, zooming in, searching for anything—a shadow, a reflection, something that would give me a clue. But it was just my room. Empty. Like the photo had been taken a second before I entered.

A cold sweat prickled down my spine.

I needed to check the house.

I slid out of bed slowly, my bare feet touching the floor without a sound. Every nerve in my body screamed at me to stay put, to pretend I never saw the photo.

But I couldn’t ignore it.

I crept to the door and pressed my ear against it. Silence. Not even the hum of the refrigerator now. Just a thick, unnatural stillness.

I turned the knob.

The door creaked open.

The hallway was empty, bathed in soft shadows from the nightlight in the wall. My living room was just beyond, the kitchen tucked to the right. The air felt wrong, like the house was holding its breath.

I stepped out.

Every instinct told me something was here, something unseen, watching.

The floor was cool under my feet as I padded down the hall, scanning every dark corner, every doorway. The front door was locked. The windows were shut. Nothing seemed out of place.

But then I noticed something.

The curtain in the living room.

When I had left earlier that day, it had been open, letting in the soft afternoon light. Now it was drawn.

I stared at it, dread pooling in my stomach.

I took a step forward.

Another.

I reached out, hesitating just before touching the fabric. A single breath of cold air brushed against my hand.

Then—the curtain twitched.

I stumbled back, heart slamming against my ribs.

For a moment, nothing happened. The curtain hung still. Just fabric. Just my imagination.

Then, slowly, the fabric parted.

And behind it—

There was nothing.

Not a wall. Not a window. Just a pitch-black void.

I choked on a breath, my legs locked in place.

That wasn’t my window.

It wasn’t anything.

Just an endless, empty dark.

Then, from that darkness, something moved.

I didn’t wait to see what it was.

I ran.

I tore down the hall, feet barely touching the floor, throwing myself into my bedroom and slamming the door behind me.

My hands fumbled for the lock. Click.

I backed away, panting. My phone was still clutched in my hand, the screen glowing in the dim light. The photo was still open.

But now, there was a second picture.

My stomach turned to ice.

I didn’t AirDrop this.

I didn’t take this.

But there it was. A new photo, taken from the same doorway.

Except now, I was in the bed.

And standing over me—

Was a shadow.

Not a person. Not a shape I could define. Just wrongness. A smudge of black, featureless, leaning over my sleeping body.

The air in my lungs turned to stone.

My gaze darted to the bed.

It was empty. Untouched.

I looked back at the photo.

And this time—

The shadow’s head had turned.

It was looking at me.

I couldn’t breathe.

I wanted to scream, to move, to do something, but all I could do was stare at the photo.

At it.

That shadowy figure, that formless, wrong thing was no longer just standing over my sleeping body. It was facing me.

My fingers felt numb as I lowered the phone, forcing myself to look at my room.

The bed was still empty. The doorway was clear.

There was nothing there.

But that didn’t mean I was alone.

I swallowed hard, my throat dry, my ears straining for any sound. The house was silent. Not the normal, peaceful quiet of the night.

This silence felt heavy. Suffocating. Like something was waiting.

I needed to get out.

I turned, grabbing my bag from the chair. My car keys were inside. I just needed to make it to the front door, get in the car, and drive. Anywhere.

I reached for the doorknob.

The second my fingers touched it—

A sound.

Soft.

A creak.

Like weight shifting on the floor behind me.

I froze.

The bed was empty. I had checked. I knew it was empty.

But something was there now.

I turned my head just enough to glance at my phone’s screen.

The photo had changed again.

The shadow wasn’t over my bed anymore.

It was standing right behind me.

I spun around—

Nothing.

But my mirror—

The mirror on the far wall, the one across from my bed—

It wasn’t empty.

I was there. Standing. Staring.

But I wasn’t alone.

A shape loomed behind me.

Not quite touching.

Not quite human.

Just a mass of blackness, shifting, twisting, watching.

I barely had time to think before the lights flickered.

Then went out.

The darkness swallowed me whole.

I gasped, my heart hammering so hard I could feel it in my throat. My phone—the only light left—flickered too, the screen distorting, static warping the image.

I could still see my reflection.

And the thing behind me.

It was closer now.

So close that if it had a mouth, it could whisper in my ear.

I couldn’t breathe.

I squeezed my eyes shut, my fingers curling so tightly around my phone it hurt.

This isn’t real.

It couldn’t be.

I had to move.

I forced myself to take a step back, reaching for the wall, for the door, for anything solid.

My fingers found the handle.

I turned it.

The door wouldn’t open.

Something pressed against my back.

Not a hand. Not a body. Just pressure. Like the air itself had thickened, molding around me, holding me in place.

My reflection twitched.

My reflection smiled.

My reflection wasn’t me anymore.

The lights flickered back on.

And I was alone.

The pressure was gone. The room was silent again.

My legs nearly gave out as I stumbled away from the mirror, shoving my phone into my pocket, trying to catch my breath.

I had to go.

I didn’t care if the door was locked. I would break a window, run barefoot into the woods if I had to.

But when I turned back to the door—

It was open.

Just a crack.

And from the dark hallway beyond, something laughed.

A dry, rasping, inhuman sound.

I didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Didn’t breathe.

Then—

The door creaked open.

And I saw it.

Not a shadow this time. Not a reflection.

Something real.

Something that had been waiting.

And it was smiling at me.

I ran.

I didn’t think. Didn’t look back.

I ran.

The hallway stretched ahead of me, warped by shadows that flickered in the dim light. The walls felt too close, the air too thick. The thing behind me—whatever it was—was still there. Watching. Waiting.

But it wasn’t stopping me.

That was worse.

I didn’t care where I was going, just that I had to get out. Out of the house. Out of the town. Away from whatever had stepped through that window in the woods.

My hand slammed against the front door.

Unlocked.

I didn’t hesitate.

The night air hit me like a shock of cold water, but I didn’t stop. My car was pointless—keys still in my bag, bag still upstairs, and I wasn’t about to go back.

The only place left to go was the one place I never should have been in the first place.

The woods.

I sprinted across the yard, my lungs burning, my legs screaming. I didn’t care. The trees loomed ahead, dark and endless, swallowing the last bits of moonlight. My chest tightened at the thought of stepping back into them.

But I had no choice.

Because something was behind me.

I heard it. A slow, dragging step. Not running. Not chasing.

Because it didn’t have to.

I hit the treeline at full speed, branches clawing at my arms, twigs snapping beneath my feet. The deeper I went, the quieter the world became.

Like it was holding its breath.

I didn’t know where I was going. My phone was still in my pocket, but I wasn’t about to slow down and check the time. Or the messages. Or the camera.

Not after what I had seen.

The clearing.

That was the only answer.

I had to find it again.

I pushed forward, lungs burning, feet aching, my mind screaming at me to turn back—but there was nothing to turn back to.

The laughter followed me.

That dry, rasping sound. Closer now.

I bit down on a whimper, refusing to look back. I wasn’t fast enough. It was always right there.

A root caught my foot.

I hit the ground hard.

Pain shot up my arms, my palms scraping against rock and dirt. I gasped, trying to push myself up—

And then I saw it.

Ahead, in the distance.

The window.

Still standing in the clearing. Still wrong.

Still showing something I knew wasn’t real.

I scrambled to my feet, ignoring the way my body ached, the way my breath came in sharp, uneven gasps.

I had come back here for a reason.

I didn’t know what it was.

But something did.

The laughter stopped.

And I knew, without looking—

It was standing right behind me.

I didn’t want to turn around.

I knew it was there. I felt it. Close enough that if I moved too slowly, if I hesitated for even a second, it could reach out and—

No.

I couldn’t think about that.

The window was in front of me. Still standing in the clearing. Still impossible.

The scene inside hadn’t changed.

My bedroom. Exactly as I had left it.

Except for one thing.

The figure in my bed was sitting up now.

I could see its head tilt toward me. A shadowy blur, just out of focus.

I didn’t have time to think.

I ran straight for it.

My body slammed into the frame, and for a brief, impossible second, I thought I’d just crash through it. Fall forward into nothing. But instead—

The world snapped.

A cold rush of air sucked the breath from my lungs, like I was being pulled through a vacuum. My ears popped, and everything went silent. My vision fractured, like looking through broken glass—flashes of movement, color, but nothing that made sense.

Then—

I hit the floor.

Hard.

My limbs tangled beneath me, and I gasped as the air punched from my chest. The world spun. My head throbbed. The silence stretched out, thick and unnatural, pressing in from every direction.

I forced myself to sit up, blinking against the disorientation.

And then I saw it.

I was home.

Or—

It looked like home.

I was sitting on my bedroom floor, facing the bed. The sheets were rumpled, just like they had been when I left. My phone was still on the nightstand, its screen dark. The window in the wall showed the same quiet neighborhood street.

For a second, I almost believed it.

Then my eyes landed on the door.

It was wrong.

Slightly too tall. The edges too sharp.

And the shadows beneath it—

They moved.

A slow, pulsing shift, as if something on the other side was breathing.

I pushed myself to my feet. My hands were shaking. I didn’t know what I had expected, but I knew this wasn’t right.

I turned back to the window, hoping—praying—that I could step through it again.

But it was gone.

Just a blank wall.

Like it had never been there at all.

A soft creak behind me.

I spun around, heart slamming against my ribs.

The door had opened.

Not all the way. Just enough to show the darkened hallway beyond.

And in that hallway, something stood waiting.

Not moving. Not breathing.

Just watching.

I swallowed hard. My throat was dry, my pulse hammering in my ears.

I wasn’t in my house.

Not anymore.

And whatever was in here with me—

It knew.

I didn’t move.

Neither did it.

The figure in the hallway was just standing there, its shape obscured by shadows. Too tall. Too still.

Then—

It tilted its head.

A slow, deliberate motion. Not human. Not natural. Like it was trying to understand me.

Something deep inside me screamed to run. But I didn’t.

Because behind me, from the wall where the window should have been, a voice whispered—

“Don’t.”

I stiffened. My breath caught in my throat.

It was my voice.

I turned my head slightly, just enough to see the mirror hanging on the far wall.

Except—

It wasn’t just a reflection.

I was standing in it.

My reflection was looking at me—but its lips were moving on their own.

“Don’t run. It wants you to.”

The thing in the hallway took a step forward.

I flinched. My reflection didn’t.

“It plays by rules.” The whisper came again. “Play back.”

Rules.

I swallowed hard, my mind racing.

Everything here was wrong, but it had structure. The window had worked like a portal. The door had opened when I acknowledged it. And this… thing… was waiting for me to react.

Like a game.

I looked at my reflection, meeting my own eyes. “What do I do?” I mouthed.

The other me smiled.

Not a reassuring smile. Not comforting.

It was a grin full of knowing.

“Use the board.”

I frowned. The board?

I glanced back at the room. My room. Everything was identical to how I’d left it. My bed, my phone, my desk—

Then I saw it.

My chessboard.

It was set up on my desk, mid-game. The last match I’d played against myself. White’s move.

I didn’t have time to question it.

I walked toward it slowly, forcing my breathing to stay even. Behind me, I could hear the thing in the hallway shifting, its movements slow, patient.

Waiting.

I reached the desk and studied the board. My last move had left my queen exposed. If I was playing against myself, I’d take it with a knight.

I lifted the black knight and moved it.

As soon as I let go, the door slammed shut.

A gust of air rattled through the room, making the walls tremble.

I turned back toward the mirror. My reflection was nodding.

“Good.”

The ground beneath me shuddered. The walls stretched, as if the entire room was breathing. The air grew thick, heavy, pressing in on me.

Another piece had moved on the board. Not by me.

Black pawn, two spaces forward.

My turn again.

A sick realization settled in my stomach.

I wasn’t playing alone.

I turned toward the door.

The thing in the hallway—whatever it was—was still there. Except now… it was smiling too.

I exhaled slowly and faced the board again.

If this was a game—

I had to win.

I didn’t look up from the board. I didn’t dare.

Whatever was in the hallway wanted me to react, and I wasn’t going to give it the satisfaction.

I studied the pieces, my hands clammy as I reached for my next move.

Pawn to e4.

I let go.

The second I did, the entire room lurched sideways, like the floor itself had tipped.

I staggered, barely keeping my balance as my stomach twisted from the shift. My desk dragged itself a few inches closer to the mirror. The air pulsed like a heartbeat, thick and suffocating.

Behind me, I could hear the thing move. Its footsteps didn’t match the floor. Like it wasn’t walking on wood, but something else entirely. Something wet. Something alive.

I clenched my jaw and looked at the board.

The next move had already been made.

A knight, creeping closer to my king.

I swallowed.

It was testing me.

I slid my fingers over a bishop, considering my options. If I took the knight, I’d expose my queen. If I moved my queen, I’d leave my king vulnerable.

Every move had a consequence.

I glanced at the mirror. My reflection was still watching, but its expression had changed.

No more grin. No amusement.

It looked worried.

That made two of us.

I shifted my bishop forward, threatening the knight. As soon as I let go, the room shuddered again.

The door to the hallway slowly creaked back open.

And the thing in the shadows stepped inside.

I gripped the edge of my desk so hard my knuckles turned white.

It was closer now. I still couldn’t see its face—if it even had one—but its shape was wrong. Its limbs were too long, its spine curved unnaturally. And worst of all, I could hear it breathing.

Deep, wet gasps. Like it was trying to taste the air.

I forced my eyes back to the board.

The game wasn’t over. I could still win.

The pieces rattled. Another had moved—on its own.

The knight was now right next to my king.

I was running out of time.

My reflection in the mirror shook its head.

Wrong move.

A chill crawled up my spine.

I turned back to the board, my heartbeat pounding in my ears.

I had to think. Had to be smart.

If this was a game, there was always a way out.

I looked at my pieces. Then I looked at my opponent’s.

And finally, I realized—

I wasn’t playing to win.

I was playing to survive.

The rules had been clear from the start. Every move I made changed the room. Changed what was coming for me.

But if I didn’t move—if I refused to play—

What happened then?

The thing in the room took another step closer.

I clenched my fists.

Then, for the first time since the game started—

I did nothing.

And the room went silent.

The silence pressed in on me, thick and absolute.

I didn’t move.

The thing in the room didn’t either.

The only sound was my own heartbeat, hammering inside my chest like it was trying to escape.

I kept my hands in my lap, fingers curled so tight they ached. My eyes flicked to the board.

No new moves.

The pieces remained frozen where they were. The knight still loomed over my king. A checkmate waiting to happen.

But it hadn’t happened yet.

The thing in the room shifted. I could hear it, the slow creak of weight pressing into the floor. The wet, dragging breaths—just behind me now. Close enough that I could feel the air change. Feel the cold creeping over my skin.

I kept my eyes down.

If I reacted, I’d lose.

My reflection in the mirror still watched, but something had changed. It wasn’t mirroring me anymore. It was moving on its own.

It raised its hand and tapped a finger against its temple.

Think.

I swallowed.

Then, slowly, I leaned forward and stared at the board.

There had to be something I was missing.

The game was still going. The thing in the room was still waiting.

Waiting for me to make the next move.

I studied the pieces. My opponent’s side.

And then—I saw it.

The one piece I hadn’t been paying attention to.

The king.

Not my king.

Theirs.

I inhaled sharply.

This wasn’t about survival. It never had been.

It was about winning.

And there was only one way to do that.

I reached out, slow and steady.

The thing in the room lurched forward.

I ignored it.

My fingers closed around my queen. I moved her.

The second I let go—

Checkmate.

The room convulsed.

A sound ripped through the air—something high-pitched and wrong, like metal scraping against bone. The walls blurred, folding in on themselves like paper. My desk split in half, the mirror cracked—

And the thing in the room—

It screamed.

Not a sound of pain.

A sound of rage.

I squeezed my eyes shut, gripping the edge of the table as the world collapsed around me.

And then—

Silence.

A different kind this time. Not heavy, not pressing.

Just... empty.

I opened my eyes.

The board was gone.

The room was normal again.

And I was alone.

At least, that’s what I thought.

Until I saw the mirror.

The reflection inside it?

It was still playing the game.

And this time—

1iorwx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1iorwx5/the_window/,The Window,"My boots crunched over damp leaves as I followed the winding trail deeper into the woods. The air smelled of moss and earth, thick with the scent of rain that had passed through earlier in the day. I was supposed to stick to the main path, but curiosity had gotten the better of me.

The forest was quiet. Too quiet.

I had hiked these woods before, but I had never seen this clearing.

The trees parted around it, their skeletal branches curling inward like fingers. The grass was overgrown, patches of wildflowers dotting the landscape. But none of that mattered—because in the very center of the clearing stood a window.

Just a frame. No glass.

It was tall and weathered, the paint long stripped away by time. It looked like it had been ripped from an old house and placed here, upright, with no walls to support it.

My stomach twisted. Something about it felt… wrong.

I stepped closer.

From this side, I saw only the forest beyond. Trees stretched toward the sky, the same as before. But when I moved—just slightly—so that I was directly in front of it…

I stopped breathing.

Through the empty frame, I saw my bedroom.

Not just a bedroom that looked like mine. My bedroom.

The familiar bookshelf stood against the far wall, overflowing with half-read novels and trinkets. My desk, cluttered with notes and empty coffee cups, sat beside it. The curtains were drawn, the dim glow of my bedside lamp casting long shadows over the walls.

And there, lying in bed, was me.

I stumbled back, my heartbeat slamming against my ribs. My mind scrambled for a rational explanation, but nothing made sense. I wasn’t dreaming—I could feel the cool air on my skin, the dampness from the earlier rain still clinging to my jacket.

I took another step forward, peering through the frame again. The scene hadn’t changed.

The figure—I—was still there, curled under the covers. My chest rose and fell with steady breaths, my head turned slightly toward the window. But then, as I watched…

I opened my eyes.

Not the me standing here.

The me in the bed.

I stared at myself, and myself stared back.

The figure in the bed didn’t move. Just lay there, eyes wide, locked onto mine through the window in the forest.

A chill ran down my spine.

I raised a shaking hand.

The me in the window raised one, too.

I turned my head slightly.

So did they.

I was about to step back—to run—when something changed.

The figure’s lips parted. A slow, stretching smile spread across its face. Too wide.

Then, ever so slightly, it shook its head.

I gasped and stumbled backward. My foot caught on a root, and I hit the ground hard, my hands scraping against damp earth. The moment I was out of view, the connection broke. I couldn’t see the bedroom anymore—just trees, rustling slightly in the wind.

My breath came in ragged bursts.

I pushed myself up and bolted, not stopping to look back.

But as I ran, a new, horrifying thought crept in:

What if, when I got home, I wasn’t the one waiting there?

I ran.

Branches whipped at my arms as I pushed through the undergrowth, feet slipping on the damp earth. My heartbeat pounded in my ears, my breath ragged. The forest felt darker now, the trees pressing in, shadows stretching longer than they should.

I kept expecting to hear footsteps behind me, but the woods were silent. Too silent. No wind. No birds. Just my own panicked breathing.

I didn’t stop until I reached my car.

It sat where I had left it, parked at the end of the trail, half-hidden by the overgrown brush. My hands shook as I yanked open the door and threw myself inside, slamming it shut behind me.

For a moment, I just sat there, gripping the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles turned white. My mind raced, trying to make sense of what I had seen.

It wasn’t possible.

It had to be some kind of trick.

Maybe I had inhaled something weird in the woods. Maybe there was some logical explanation—an optical illusion, a hallucination, anything other than what my gut was telling me.

That I had just seen myself.

And that it—whatever it was—had seen me too.

I forced a deep breath and turned the key. The engine rumbled to life, breaking the awful silence. My headlights flicked on, illuminating the trees ahead, casting long, skeletal shadows across the dirt path.

I didn’t look back.

The drive home was a blur.

I kept checking my rearview mirror, expecting to see something on the road behind me. A shape in the distance. A figure standing in the middle of the street.

But there was nothing. Just the empty highway stretching out behind me, the headlights cutting through the darkness.

By the time I pulled into my driveway, my nerves were raw.

My house looked the same as always—porch light glowing softly, curtains drawn over the windows. Familiar. Safe.

But the moment I stepped out of the car, I hesitated.

What if I was already inside?

The thought sent a shudder through me. It was irrational. Impossible. I had just imagined it.

Right?

I swallowed hard and walked up to the front door. My hands were clammy as I unlocked it and pushed it open.

The house was quiet.

I stepped inside, locking the door behind me. My ears strained for any sound, any sign that someone—or something—was here. But all I could hear was the soft hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen, the distant ticking of the clock in the hallway.

I let out a slow breath.

Everything was fine.

Still, my skin prickled as I made my way down the hall. My bedroom door was closed. It hadn’t been when I left.

I stood there, staring at it. My pulse pounded in my throat.

What if I opened that door and saw myself lying in bed?

I reached for the handle.

Turned it.

Pushed the door open.

The room was empty.

The bed was neatly made, the curtains drawn, the dim glow of the bedside lamp casting soft shadows over the walls. Exactly how I had left it.

My breath shuddered out of me. I felt stupid now, standing there in my own bedroom, shaken over nothing.

I was exhausted. My mind was playing tricks on me.

I closed the door behind me and sat on the edge of the bed, rubbing my face with my hands. The image of that thing in the window was burned into my brain. That smile. The way it had shaken its head, like it knew something I didn’t.

I needed to sleep.

I crawled under the covers and reached for my phone on the nightstand. The screen lit up.

And then, every nerve in my body went cold.

Because there was a notification.

A photo.

A new AirDrop request from an unknown sender.

My breath hitched. My thumb trembled as I opened it.

And there, staring back at me, was a photo of my bedroom. Taken from the doorway.

I whipped my head toward the door.

It was still closed.

But I wasn’t alone.

I couldn’t move.

My fingers clenched around my phone, my breath coming in short, shallow bursts. The photo on the screen—it wasn’t possible. I had just walked into my room. The door had been closed. Locked.

But someone—or something—had been standing right there, taking a picture.

I forced myself to look up, my eyes locked on the bedroom door. It was still closed. The brass handle gleamed in the dim light, perfectly still.

No one was there.

At least, no one I could see.

I swallowed hard, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. My mind raced through explanations. A prank? But who? The woods were miles away from anything, and I had been alone all day.

A hacker? But how would they have taken that picture?

My hands shook as I tapped the screen, heart hammering as I checked the AirDrop sender.

Unknown.

Of course.

I tapped the photo, zooming in, searching for anything—a shadow, a reflection, something that would give me a clue. But it was just my room. Empty. Like the photo had been taken a second before I entered.

A cold sweat prickled down my spine.

I needed to check the house.

I slid out of bed slowly, my bare feet touching the floor without a sound. Every nerve in my body screamed at me to stay put, to pretend I never saw the photo.

But I couldn’t ignore it.

I crept to the door and pressed my ear against it. Silence. Not even the hum of the refrigerator now. Just a thick, unnatural stillness.

I turned the knob.

The door creaked open.

The hallway was empty, bathed in soft shadows from the nightlight in the wall. My living room was just beyond, the kitchen tucked to the right. The air felt wrong, like the house was holding its breath.

I stepped out.

Every instinct told me something was here, something unseen, watching.

The floor was cool under my feet as I padded down the hall, scanning every dark corner, every doorway. The front door was locked. The windows were shut. Nothing seemed out of place.

But then I noticed something.

The curtain in the living room.

When I had left earlier that day, it had been open, letting in the soft afternoon light. Now it was drawn.

I stared at it, dread pooling in my stomach.

I took a step forward.

Another.

I reached out, hesitating just before touching the fabric. A single breath of cold air brushed against my hand.

Then—the curtain twitched.

I stumbled back, heart slamming against my ribs.

For a moment, nothing happened. The curtain hung still. Just fabric. Just my imagination.

Then, slowly, the fabric parted.

And behind it—

There was nothing.

Not a wall. Not a window. Just a pitch-black void.

I choked on a breath, my legs locked in place.

That wasn’t my window.

It wasn’t anything.

Just an endless, empty dark.

Then, from that darkness, something moved.

I didn’t wait to see what it was.

I ran.

I tore down the hall, feet barely touching the floor, throwing myself into my bedroom and slamming the door behind me.

My hands fumbled for the lock. Click.

I backed away, panting. My phone was still clutched in my hand, the screen glowing in the dim light. The photo was still open.

But now, there was a second picture.

My stomach turned to ice.

I didn’t AirDrop this.

I didn’t take this.

But there it was. A new photo, taken from the same doorway.

Except now, I was in the bed.

And standing over me—

Was a shadow.

Not a person. Not a shape I could define. Just wrongness. A smudge of black, featureless, leaning over my sleeping body.

The air in my lungs turned to stone.

My gaze darted to the bed.

It was empty. Untouched.

I looked back at the photo.

And this time—

The shadow’s head had turned.

It was looking at me.

I couldn’t breathe.

I wanted to scream, to move, to do something, but all I could do was stare at the photo.

At it.

That shadowy figure, that formless, wrong thing was no longer just standing over my sleeping body. It was facing me.

My fingers felt numb as I lowered the phone, forcing myself to look at my room.

The bed was still empty. The doorway was clear.

There was nothing there.

But that didn’t mean I was alone.

I swallowed hard, my throat dry, my ears straining for any sound. The house was silent. Not the normal, peaceful quiet of the night.

This silence felt heavy. Suffocating. Like something was waiting.

I needed to get out.

I turned, grabbing my bag from the chair. My car keys were inside. I just needed to make it to the front door, get in the car, and drive. Anywhere.

I reached for the doorknob.

The second my fingers touched it—

A sound.

Soft.

A creak.

Like weight shifting on the floor behind me.

I froze.

The bed was empty. I had checked. I knew it was empty.

But something was there now.

I turned my head just enough to glance at my phone’s screen.

The photo had changed again.

The shadow wasn’t over my bed anymore.

It was standing right behind me.

I spun around—

Nothing.

But my mirror—

The mirror on the far wall, the one across from my bed—

It wasn’t empty.

I was there. Standing. Staring.

But I wasn’t alone.

A shape loomed behind me.

Not quite touching.

Not quite human.

Just a mass of blackness, shifting, twisting, watching.

I barely had time to think before the lights flickered.

Then went out.

The darkness swallowed me whole.

I gasped, my heart hammering so hard I could feel it in my throat. My phone—the only light left—flickered too, the screen distorting, static warping the image.

I could still see my reflection.

And the thing behind me.

It was closer now.

So close that if it had a mouth, it could whisper in my ear.

I couldn’t breathe.

I squeezed my eyes shut, my fingers curling so tightly around my phone it hurt.

This isn’t real.

It couldn’t be.

I had to move.

I forced myself to take a step back, reaching for the wall, for the door, for anything solid.

My fingers found the handle.

I turned it.

The door wouldn’t open.

Something pressed against my back.

Not a hand. Not a body. Just pressure. Like the air itself had thickened, molding around me, holding me in place.

My reflection twitched.

My reflection smiled.

My reflection wasn’t me anymore.

The lights flickered back on.

And I was alone.

The pressure was gone. The room was silent again.

My legs nearly gave out as I stumbled away from the mirror, shoving my phone into my pocket, trying to catch my breath.

I had to go.

I didn’t care if the door was locked. I would break a window, run barefoot into the woods if I had to.

But when I turned back to the door—

It was open.

Just a crack.

And from the dark hallway beyond, something laughed.

A dry, rasping, inhuman sound.

I didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Didn’t breathe.

Then—

The door creaked open.

And I saw it.

Not a shadow this time. Not a reflection.

Something real.

Something that had been waiting.

And it was smiling at me.

I ran.

I didn’t think. Didn’t look back.

I ran.

The hallway stretched ahead of me, warped by shadows that flickered in the dim light. The walls felt too close, the air too thick. The thing behind me—whatever it was—was still there. Watching. Waiting.

But it wasn’t stopping me.

That was worse.

I didn’t care where I was going, just that I had to get out. Out of the house. Out of the town. Away from whatever had stepped through that window in the woods.

My hand slammed against the front door.

Unlocked.

I didn’t hesitate.

The night air hit me like a shock of cold water, but I didn’t stop. My car was pointless—keys still in my bag, bag still upstairs, and I wasn’t about to go back.

The only place left to go was the one place I never should have been in the first place.

The woods.

I sprinted across the yard, my lungs burning, my legs screaming. I didn’t care. The trees loomed ahead, dark and endless, swallowing the last bits of moonlight. My chest tightened at the thought of stepping back into them.

But I had no choice.

Because something was behind me.

I heard it. A slow, dragging step. Not running. Not chasing.

Because it didn’t have to.

I hit the treeline at full speed, branches clawing at my arms, twigs snapping beneath my feet. The deeper I went, the quieter the world became.

Like it was holding its breath.

I didn’t know where I was going. My phone was still in my pocket, but I wasn’t about to slow down and check the time. Or the messages. Or the camera.

Not after what I had seen.

The clearing.

That was the only answer.

I had to find it again.

I pushed forward, lungs burning, feet aching, my mind screaming at me to turn back—but there was nothing to turn back to.

The laughter followed me.

That dry, rasping sound. Closer now.

I bit down on a whimper, refusing to look back. I wasn’t fast enough. It was always right there.

A root caught my foot.

I hit the ground hard.

Pain shot up my arms, my palms scraping against rock and dirt. I gasped, trying to push myself up—

And then I saw it.

Ahead, in the distance.

The window.

Still standing in the clearing. Still wrong.

Still showing something I knew wasn’t real.

I scrambled to my feet, ignoring the way my body ached, the way my breath came in sharp, uneven gasps.

I had come back here for a reason.

I didn’t know what it was.

But something did.

The laughter stopped.

And I knew, without looking—

It was standing right behind me.

I didn’t want to turn around.

I knew it was there. I felt it. Close enough that if I moved too slowly, if I hesitated for even a second, it could reach out and—

No.

I couldn’t think about that.

The window was in front of me. Still standing in the clearing. Still impossible.

The scene inside hadn’t changed.

My bedroom. Exactly as I had left it.

Except for one thing.

The figure in my bed was sitting up now.

I could see its head tilt toward me. A shadowy blur, just out of focus.

I didn’t have time to think.

I ran straight for it.

My body slammed into the frame, and for a brief, impossible second, I thought I’d just crash through it. Fall forward into nothing. But instead—

The world snapped.

A cold rush of air sucked the breath from my lungs, like I was being pulled through a vacuum. My ears popped, and everything went silent. My vision fractured, like looking through broken glass—flashes of movement, color, but nothing that made sense.

Then—

I hit the floor.

Hard.

My limbs tangled beneath me, and I gasped as the air punched from my chest. The world spun. My head throbbed. The silence stretched out, thick and unnatural, pressing in from every direction.

I forced myself to sit up, blinking against the disorientation.

And then I saw it.

I was home.

Or—

It looked like home.

I was sitting on my bedroom floor, facing the bed. The sheets were rumpled, just like they had been when I left. My phone was still on the nightstand, its screen dark. The window in the wall showed the same quiet neighborhood street.

For a second, I almost believed it.

Then my eyes landed on the door.

It was wrong.

Slightly too tall. The edges too sharp.

And the shadows beneath it—

They moved.

A slow, pulsing shift, as if something on the other side was breathing.

I pushed myself to my feet. My hands were shaking. I didn’t know what I had expected, but I knew this wasn’t right.

I turned back to the window, hoping—praying—that I could step through it again.

But it was gone.

Just a blank wall.

Like it had never been there at all.

A soft creak behind me.

I spun around, heart slamming against my ribs.

The door had opened.

Not all the way. Just enough to show the darkened hallway beyond.

And in that hallway, something stood waiting.

Not moving. Not breathing.

Just watching.

I swallowed hard. My throat was dry, my pulse hammering in my ears.

I wasn’t in my house.

Not anymore.

And whatever was in here with me—

It knew.

I didn’t move.

Neither did it.

The figure in the hallway was just standing there, its shape obscured by shadows. Too tall. Too still.

Then—

It tilted its head.

A slow, deliberate motion. Not human. Not natural. Like it was trying to understand me.

Something deep inside me screamed to run. But I didn’t.

Because behind me, from the wall where the window should have been, a voice whispered—

“Don’t.”

I stiffened. My breath caught in my throat.

It was my voice.

I turned my head slightly, just enough to see the mirror hanging on the far wall.

Except—

It wasn’t just a reflection.

I was standing in it.

My reflection was looking at me—but its lips were moving on their own.

“Don’t run. It wants you to.”

The thing in the hallway took a step forward.

I flinched. My reflection didn’t.

“It plays by rules.” The whisper came again. “Play back.”

Rules.

I swallowed hard, my mind racing.

Everything here was wrong, but it had structure. The window had worked like a portal. The door had opened when I acknowledged it. And this… thing… was waiting for me to react.

Like a game.

I looked at my reflection, meeting my own eyes. “What do I do?” I mouthed.

The other me smiled.

Not a reassuring smile. Not comforting.

It was a grin full of knowing.

“Use the board.”

I frowned. The board?

I glanced back at the room. My room. Everything was identical to how I’d left it. My bed, my phone, my desk—

Then I saw it.

My chessboard.

It was set up on my desk, mid-game. The last match I’d played against myself. White’s move.

I didn’t have time to question it.

I walked toward it slowly, forcing my breathing to stay even. Behind me, I could hear the thing in the hallway shifting, its movements slow, patient.

Waiting.

I reached the desk and studied the board. My last move had left my queen exposed. If I was playing against myself, I’d take it with a knight.

I lifted the black knight and moved it.

As soon as I let go, the door slammed shut.

A gust of air rattled through the room, making the walls tremble.

I turned back toward the mirror. My reflection was nodding.

“Good.”

The ground beneath me shuddered. The walls stretched, as if the entire room was breathing. The air grew thick, heavy, pressing in on me.

Another piece had moved on the board. Not by me.

Black pawn, two spaces forward.

My turn again.

A sick realization settled in my stomach.

I wasn’t playing alone.

I turned toward the door.

The thing in the hallway—whatever it was—was still there. Except now… it was smiling too.

I exhaled slowly and faced the board again.

If this was a game—

I had to win.

I didn’t look up from the board. I didn’t dare.

Whatever was in the hallway wanted me to react, and I wasn’t going to give it the satisfaction.

I studied the pieces, my hands clammy as I reached for my next move.

Pawn to e4.

I let go.

The second I did, the entire room lurched sideways, like the floor itself had tipped.

I staggered, barely keeping my balance as my stomach twisted from the shift. My desk dragged itself a few inches closer to the mirror. The air pulsed like a heartbeat, thick and suffocating.

Behind me, I could hear the thing move. Its footsteps didn’t match the floor. Like it wasn’t walking on wood, but something else entirely. Something wet. Something alive.

I clenched my jaw and looked at the board.

The next move had already been made.

A knight, creeping closer to my king.

I swallowed.

It was testing me.

I slid my fingers over a bishop, considering my options. If I took the knight, I’d expose my queen. If I moved my queen, I’d leave my king vulnerable.

Every move had a consequence.

I glanced at the mirror. My reflection was still watching, but its expression had changed.

No more grin. No amusement.

It looked worried.

That made two of us.

I shifted my bishop forward, threatening the knight. As soon as I let go, the room shuddered again.

The door to the hallway slowly creaked back open.

And the thing in the shadows stepped inside.

I gripped the edge of my desk so hard my knuckles turned white.

It was closer now. I still couldn’t see its face—if it even had one—but its shape was wrong. Its limbs were too long, its spine curved unnaturally. And worst of all, I could hear it breathing.

Deep, wet gasps. Like it was trying to taste the air.

I forced my eyes back to the board.

The game wasn’t over. I could still win.

The pieces rattled. Another had moved—on its own.

The knight was now right next to my king.

I was running out of time.

My reflection in the mirror shook its head.

Wrong move.

A chill crawled up my spine.

I turned back to the board, my heartbeat pounding in my ears.

I had to think. Had to be smart.

If this was a game, there was always a way out.

I looked at my pieces. Then I looked at my opponent’s.

And finally, I realized—

I wasn’t playing to win.

I was playing to survive.

The rules had been clear from the start. Every move I made changed the room. Changed what was coming for me.

But if I didn’t move—if I refused to play—

What happened then?

The thing in the room took another step closer.

I clenched my fists.

Then, for the first time since the game started—

I did nothing.

And the room went silent.

The silence pressed in on me, thick and absolute.

I didn’t move.

The thing in the room didn’t either.

The only sound was my own heartbeat, hammering inside my chest like it was trying to escape.

I kept my hands in my lap, fingers curled so tight they ached. My eyes flicked to the board.

No new moves.

The pieces remained frozen where they were. The knight still loomed over my king. A checkmate waiting to happen.

But it hadn’t happened yet.

The thing in the room shifted. I could hear it, the slow creak of weight pressing into the floor. The wet, dragging breaths—just behind me now. Close enough that I could feel the air change. Feel the cold creeping over my skin.

I kept my eyes down.

If I reacted, I’d lose.

My reflection in the mirror still watched, but something had changed. It wasn’t mirroring me anymore. It was moving on its own.

It raised its hand and tapped a finger against its temple.

Think.

I swallowed.

Then, slowly, I leaned forward and stared at the board.

There had to be something I was missing.

The game was still going. The thing in the room was still waiting.

Waiting for me to make the next move.

I studied the pieces. My opponent’s side.

And then—I saw it.

The one piece I hadn’t been paying attention to.

The king.

Not my king.

Theirs.

I inhaled sharply.

This wasn’t about survival. It never had been.

It was about winning.

And there was only one way to do that.

I reached out, slow and steady.

The thing in the room lurched forward.

I ignored it.

My fingers closed around my queen. I moved her.

The second I let go—

Checkmate.

The room convulsed.

A sound ripped through the air—something high-pitched and wrong, like metal scraping against bone. The walls blurred, folding in on themselves like paper. My desk split in half, the mirror cracked—

And the thing in the room—

It screamed.

Not a sound of pain.

A sound of rage.

I squeezed my eyes shut, gripping the edge of the table as the world collapsed around me.

And then—

Silence.

A different kind this time. Not heavy, not pressing.

Just... empty.

I opened my eyes.

The board was gone.

The room was normal again.

And I was alone.

At least, that’s what I thought.

Until I saw the mirror.

The reflection inside it?

It was still playing the game.

And this time—

It wasn’t me sitting in the chair.",1,1739476519.0,deepnightsociety,0,1.0,False
1iorwq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepystories/comments/1iorwq0/the_window/,The Window,"My boots crunched over damp leaves as I followed the winding trail deeper into the woods. The air smelled of moss and earth, thick with the scent of rain that had passed through earlier in the day. I was supposed to stick to the main path, but curiosity had gotten the better of me.

The forest was quiet. Too quiet.

I had hiked these woods before, but I had never seen this clearing.

The trees parted around it, their skeletal branches curling inward like fingers. The grass was overgrown, patches of wildflowers dotting the landscape. But none of that mattered—because in the very center of the clearing stood a window.

Just a frame. No glass.

It was tall and weathered, the paint long stripped away by time. It looked like it had been ripped from an old house and placed here, upright, with no walls to support it.

My stomach twisted. Something about it felt… wrong.

I stepped closer.

From this side, I saw only the forest beyond. Trees stretched toward the sky, the same as before. But when I moved—just slightly—so that I was directly in front of it…

I stopped breathing.

Through the empty frame, I saw my bedroom.

Not just a bedroom that looked like mine. My bedroom.

The familiar bookshelf stood against the far wall, overflowing with half-read novels and trinkets. My desk, cluttered with notes and empty coffee cups, sat beside it. The curtains were drawn, the dim glow of my bedside lamp casting long shadows over the walls.

And there, lying in bed, was me.

I stumbled back, my heartbeat slamming against my ribs. My mind scrambled for a rational explanation, but nothing made sense. I wasn’t dreaming—I could feel the cool air on my skin, the dampness from the earlier rain still clinging to my jacket.

I took another step forward, peering through the frame again. The scene hadn’t changed.

The figure—I—was still there, curled under the covers. My chest rose and fell with steady breaths, my head turned slightly toward the window. But then, as I watched…

I opened my eyes.

Not the me standing here.

The me in the bed.

I stared at myself, and myself stared back.

The figure in the bed didn’t move. Just lay there, eyes wide, locked onto mine through the window in the forest.

A chill ran down my spine.

I raised a shaking hand.

The me in the window raised one, too.

I turned my head slightly.

So did they.

I was about to step back—to run—when something changed.

The figure’s lips parted. A slow, stretching smile spread across its face. Too wide.

Then, ever so slightly, it shook its head.

I gasped and stumbled backward. My foot caught on a root, and I hit the ground hard, my hands scraping against damp earth. The moment I was out of view, the connection broke. I couldn’t see the bedroom anymore—just trees, rustling slightly in the wind.

My breath came in ragged bursts.

I pushed myself up and bolted, not stopping to look back.

But as I ran, a new, horrifying thought crept in:

What if, when I got home, I wasn’t the one waiting there?

I ran.

Branches whipped at my arms as I pushed through the undergrowth, feet slipping on the damp earth. My heartbeat pounded in my ears, my breath ragged. The forest felt darker now, the trees pressing in, shadows stretching longer than they should.

I kept expecting to hear footsteps behind me, but the woods were silent. Too silent. No wind. No birds. Just my own panicked breathing.

I didn’t stop until I reached my car.

It sat where I had left it, parked at the end of the trail, half-hidden by the overgrown brush. My hands shook as I yanked open the door and threw myself inside, slamming it shut behind me.

For a moment, I just sat there, gripping the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles turned white. My mind raced, trying to make sense of what I had seen.

It wasn’t possible.

It had to be some kind of trick.

Maybe I had inhaled something weird in the woods. Maybe there was some logical explanation—an optical illusion, a hallucination, anything other than what my gut was telling me.

That I had just seen myself.

And that it—whatever it was—had seen me too.

I forced a deep breath and turned the key. The engine rumbled to life, breaking the awful silence. My headlights flicked on, illuminating the trees ahead, casting long, skeletal shadows across the dirt path.

I didn’t look back.

The drive home was a blur.

I kept checking my rearview mirror, expecting to see something on the road behind me. A shape in the distance. A figure standing in the middle of the street.

But there was nothing. Just the empty highway stretching out behind me, the headlights cutting through the darkness.

By the time I pulled into my driveway, my nerves were raw.

My house looked the same as always—porch light glowing softly, curtains drawn over the windows. Familiar. Safe.

But the moment I stepped out of the car, I hesitated.

What if I was already inside?

The thought sent a shudder through me. It was irrational. Impossible. I had just imagined it.

Right?

I swallowed hard and walked up to the front door. My hands were clammy as I unlocked it and pushed it open.

The house was quiet.

I stepped inside, locking the door behind me. My ears strained for any sound, any sign that someone—or something—was here. But all I could hear was the soft hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen, the distant ticking of the clock in the hallway.

I let out a slow breath.

Everything was fine.

Still, my skin prickled as I made my way down the hall. My bedroom door was closed. It hadn’t been when I left.

I stood there, staring at it. My pulse pounded in my throat.

What if I opened that door and saw myself lying in bed?

I reached for the handle.

Turned it.

Pushed the door open.

The room was empty.

The bed was neatly made, the curtains drawn, the dim glow of the bedside lamp casting soft shadows over the walls. Exactly how I had left it.

My breath shuddered out of me. I felt stupid now, standing there in my own bedroom, shaken over nothing.

I was exhausted. My mind was playing tricks on me.

I closed the door behind me and sat on the edge of the bed, rubbing my face with my hands. The image of that thing in the window was burned into my brain. That smile. The way it had shaken its head, like it knew something I didn’t.

I needed to sleep.

I crawled under the covers and reached for my phone on the nightstand. The screen lit up.

And then, every nerve in my body went cold.

Because there was a notification.

A photo.

A new AirDrop request from an unknown sender.

My breath hitched. My thumb trembled as I opened it.

And there, staring back at me, was a photo of my bedroom. Taken from the doorway.

I whipped my head toward the door.

It was still closed.

But I wasn’t alone.

I couldn’t move.

My fingers clenched around my phone, my breath coming in short, shallow bursts. The photo on the screen—it wasn’t possible. I had just walked into my room. The door had been closed. Locked.

But someone—or something—had been standing right there, taking a picture.

I forced myself to look up, my eyes locked on the bedroom door. It was still closed. The brass handle gleamed in the dim light, perfectly still.

No one was there.

At least, no one I could see.

I swallowed hard, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. My mind raced through explanations. A prank? But who? The woods were miles away from anything, and I had been alone all day.

A hacker? But how would they have taken that picture?

My hands shook as I tapped the screen, heart hammering as I checked the AirDrop sender.

Unknown.

Of course.

I tapped the photo, zooming in, searching for anything—a shadow, a reflection, something that would give me a clue. But it was just my room. Empty. Like the photo had been taken a second before I entered.

A cold sweat prickled down my spine.

I needed to check the house.

I slid out of bed slowly, my bare feet touching the floor without a sound. Every nerve in my body screamed at me to stay put, to pretend I never saw the photo.

But I couldn’t ignore it.

I crept to the door and pressed my ear against it. Silence. Not even the hum of the refrigerator now. Just a thick, unnatural stillness.

I turned the knob.

The door creaked open.

The hallway was empty, bathed in soft shadows from the nightlight in the wall. My living room was just beyond, the kitchen tucked to the right. The air felt wrong, like the house was holding its breath.

I stepped out.

Every instinct told me something was here, something unseen, watching.

The floor was cool under my feet as I padded down the hall, scanning every dark corner, every doorway. The front door was locked. The windows were shut. Nothing seemed out of place.

But then I noticed something.

The curtain in the living room.

When I had left earlier that day, it had been open, letting in the soft afternoon light. Now it was drawn.

I stared at it, dread pooling in my stomach.

I took a step forward.

Another.

I reached out, hesitating just before touching the fabric. A single breath of cold air brushed against my hand.

Then—the curtain twitched.

I stumbled back, heart slamming against my ribs.

For a moment, nothing happened. The curtain hung still. Just fabric. Just my imagination.

Then, slowly, the fabric parted.

And behind it—

There was nothing.

Not a wall. Not a window. Just a pitch-black void.

I choked on a breath, my legs locked in place.

That wasn’t my window.

It wasn’t anything.

Just an endless, empty dark.

Then, from that darkness, something moved.

I didn’t wait to see what it was.

I ran.

I tore down the hall, feet barely touching the floor, throwing myself into my bedroom and slamming the door behind me.

My hands fumbled for the lock. Click.

I backed away, panting. My phone was still clutched in my hand, the screen glowing in the dim light. The photo was still open.

But now, there was a second picture.

My stomach turned to ice.

I didn’t AirDrop this.

I didn’t take this.

But there it was. A new photo, taken from the same doorway.

Except now, I was in the bed.

And standing over me—

Was a shadow.

Not a person. Not a shape I could define. Just wrongness. A smudge of black, featureless, leaning over my sleeping body.

The air in my lungs turned to stone.

My gaze darted to the bed.

It was empty. Untouched.

I looked back at the photo.

And this time—

The shadow’s head had turned.

It was looking at me.

I couldn’t breathe.

I wanted to scream, to move, to do something, but all I could do was stare at the photo.

At it.

That shadowy figure, that formless, wrong thing was no longer just standing over my sleeping body. It was facing me.

My fingers felt numb as I lowered the phone, forcing myself to look at my room.

The bed was still empty. The doorway was clear.

There was nothing there.

But that didn’t mean I was alone.

I swallowed hard, my throat dry, my ears straining for any sound. The house was silent. Not the normal, peaceful quiet of the night.

This silence felt heavy. Suffocating. Like something was waiting.

I needed to get out.

I turned, grabbing my bag from the chair. My car keys were inside. I just needed to make it to the front door, get in the car, and drive. Anywhere.

I reached for the doorknob.

The second my fingers touched it—

A sound.

Soft.

A creak.

Like weight shifting on the floor behind me.

I froze.

The bed was empty. I had checked. I knew it was empty.

But something was there now.

I turned my head just enough to glance at my phone’s screen.

The photo had changed again.

The shadow wasn’t over my bed anymore.

It was standing right behind me.

I spun around—

Nothing.

But my mirror—

The mirror on the far wall, the one across from my bed—

It wasn’t empty.

I was there. Standing. Staring.

But I wasn’t alone.

A shape loomed behind me.

Not quite touching.

Not quite human.

Just a mass of blackness, shifting, twisting, watching.

I barely had time to think before the lights flickered.

Then went out.

The darkness swallowed me whole.

I gasped, my heart hammering so hard I could feel it in my throat. My phone—the only light left—flickered too, the screen distorting, static warping the image.

I could still see my reflection.

And the thing behind me.

It was closer now.

So close that if it had a mouth, it could whisper in my ear.

I couldn’t breathe.

I squeezed my eyes shut, my fingers curling so tightly around my phone it hurt.

This isn’t real.

It couldn’t be.

I had to move.

I forced myself to take a step back, reaching for the wall, for the door, for anything solid.

My fingers found the handle.

I turned it.

The door wouldn’t open.

Something pressed against my back.

Not a hand. Not a body. Just pressure. Like the air itself had thickened, molding around me, holding me in place.

My reflection twitched.

My reflection smiled.

My reflection wasn’t me anymore.

The lights flickered back on.

And I was alone.

The pressure was gone. The room was silent again.

My legs nearly gave out as I stumbled away from the mirror, shoving my phone into my pocket, trying to catch my breath.

I had to go.

I didn’t care if the door was locked. I would break a window, run barefoot into the woods if I had to.

But when I turned back to the door—

It was open.

Just a crack.

And from the dark hallway beyond, something laughed.

A dry, rasping, inhuman sound.

I didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Didn’t breathe.

Then—

The door creaked open.

And I saw it.

Not a shadow this time. Not a reflection.

Something real.

Something that had been waiting.

And it was smiling at me.

I ran.

I didn’t think. Didn’t look back.

I ran.

The hallway stretched ahead of me, warped by shadows that flickered in the dim light. The walls felt too close, the air too thick. The thing behind me—whatever it was—was still there. Watching. Waiting.

But it wasn’t stopping me.

That was worse.

I didn’t care where I was going, just that I had to get out. Out of the house. Out of the town. Away from whatever had stepped through that window in the woods.

My hand slammed against the front door.

Unlocked.

I didn’t hesitate.

The night air hit me like a shock of cold water, but I didn’t stop. My car was pointless—keys still in my bag, bag still upstairs, and I wasn’t about to go back.

The only place left to go was the one place I never should have been in the first place.

The woods.

I sprinted across the yard, my lungs burning, my legs screaming. I didn’t care. The trees loomed ahead, dark and endless, swallowing the last bits of moonlight. My chest tightened at the thought of stepping back into them.

But I had no choice.

Because something was behind me.

I heard it. A slow, dragging step. Not running. Not chasing.

Because it didn’t have to.

I hit the treeline at full speed, branches clawing at my arms, twigs snapping beneath my feet. The deeper I went, the quieter the world became.

Like it was holding its breath.

I didn’t know where I was going. My phone was still in my pocket, but I wasn’t about to slow down and check the time. Or the messages. Or the camera.

Not after what I had seen.

The clearing.

That was the only answer.

I had to find it again.

I pushed forward, lungs burning, feet aching, my mind screaming at me to turn back—but there was nothing to turn back to.

The laughter followed me.

That dry, rasping sound. Closer now.

I bit down on a whimper, refusing to look back. I wasn’t fast enough. It was always right there.

A root caught my foot.

I hit the ground hard.

Pain shot up my arms, my palms scraping against rock and dirt. I gasped, trying to push myself up—

And then I saw it.

Ahead, in the distance.

The window.

Still standing in the clearing. Still wrong.

Still showing something I knew wasn’t real.

I scrambled to my feet, ignoring the way my body ached, the way my breath came in sharp, uneven gasps.

I had come back here for a reason.

I didn’t know what it was.

But something did.

The laughter stopped.

And I knew, without looking—

It was standing right behind me.

I didn’t want to turn around.

I knew it was there. I felt it. Close enough that if I moved too slowly, if I hesitated for even a second, it could reach out and—

No.

I couldn’t think about that.

The window was in front of me. Still standing in the clearing. Still impossible.

The scene inside hadn’t changed.

My bedroom. Exactly as I had left it.

Except for one thing.

The figure in my bed was sitting up now.

I could see its head tilt toward me. A shadowy blur, just out of focus.

I didn’t have time to think.

I ran straight for it.

My body slammed into the frame, and for a brief, impossible second, I thought I’d just crash through it. Fall forward into nothing. But instead—

The world snapped.

A cold rush of air sucked the breath from my lungs, like I was being pulled through a vacuum. My ears popped, and everything went silent. My vision fractured, like looking through broken glass—flashes of movement, color, but nothing that made sense.

Then—

I hit the floor.

Hard.

My limbs tangled beneath me, and I gasped as the air punched from my chest. The world spun. My head throbbed. The silence stretched out, thick and unnatural, pressing in from every direction.

I forced myself to sit up, blinking against the disorientation.

And then I saw it.

I was home.

Or—

It looked like home.

I was sitting on my bedroom floor, facing the bed. The sheets were rumpled, just like they had been when I left. My phone was still on the nightstand, its screen dark. The window in the wall showed the same quiet neighborhood street.

For a second, I almost believed it.

Then my eyes landed on the door.

It was wrong.

Slightly too tall. The edges too sharp.

And the shadows beneath it—

They moved.

A slow, pulsing shift, as if something on the other side was breathing.

I pushed myself to my feet. My hands were shaking. I didn’t know what I had expected, but I knew this wasn’t right.

I turned back to the window, hoping—praying—that I could step through it again.

But it was gone.

Just a blank wall.

Like it had never been there at all.

A soft creak behind me.

I spun around, heart slamming against my ribs.

The door had opened.

Not all the way. Just enough to show the darkened hallway beyond.

And in that hallway, something stood waiting.

Not moving. Not breathing.

Just watching.

I swallowed hard. My throat was dry, my pulse hammering in my ears.

I wasn’t in my house.

Not anymore.

And whatever was in here with me—

It knew.

I didn’t move.

Neither did it.

The figure in the hallway was just standing there, its shape obscured by shadows. Too tall. Too still.

Then—

It tilted its head.

A slow, deliberate motion. Not human. Not natural. Like it was trying to understand me.

Something deep inside me screamed to run. But I didn’t.

Because behind me, from the wall where the window should have been, a voice whispered—

“Don’t.”

I stiffened. My breath caught in my throat.

It was my voice.

I turned my head slightly, just enough to see the mirror hanging on the far wall.

Except—

It wasn’t just a reflection.

I was standing in it.

My reflection was looking at me—but its lips were moving on their own.

“Don’t run. It wants you to.”

The thing in the hallway took a step forward.

I flinched. My reflection didn’t.

“It plays by rules.” The whisper came again. “Play back.”

Rules.

I swallowed hard, my mind racing.

Everything here was wrong, but it had structure. The window had worked like a portal. The door had opened when I acknowledged it. And this… thing… was waiting for me to react.

Like a game.

I looked at my reflection, meeting my own eyes. “What do I do?” I mouthed.

The other me smiled.

Not a reassuring smile. Not comforting.

It was a grin full of knowing.

“Use the board.”

I frowned. The board?

I glanced back at the room. My room. Everything was identical to how I’d left it. My bed, my phone, my desk—

Then I saw it.

My chessboard.

It was set up on my desk, mid-game. The last match I’d played against myself. White’s move.

I didn’t have time to question it.

I walked toward it slowly, forcing my breathing to stay even. Behind me, I could hear the thing in the hallway shifting, its movements slow, patient.

Waiting.

I reached the desk and studied the board. My last move had left my queen exposed. If I was playing against myself, I’d take it with a knight.

I lifted the black knight and moved it.

As soon as I let go, the door slammed shut.

A gust of air rattled through the room, making the walls tremble.

I turned back toward the mirror. My reflection was nodding.

“Good.”

The ground beneath me shuddered. The walls stretched, as if the entire room was breathing. The air grew thick, heavy, pressing in on me.

Another piece had moved on the board. Not by me.

Black pawn, two spaces forward.

My turn again.

A sick realization settled in my stomach.

I wasn’t playing alone.

I turned toward the door.

The thing in the hallway—whatever it was—was still there. Except now… it was smiling too.

I exhaled slowly and faced the board again.

If this was a game—

I had to win.

I didn’t look up from the board. I didn’t dare.

Whatever was in the hallway wanted me to react, and I wasn’t going to give it the satisfaction.

I studied the pieces, my hands clammy as I reached for my next move.

Pawn to e4.

I let go.

The second I did, the entire room lurched sideways, like the floor itself had tipped.

I staggered, barely keeping my balance as my stomach twisted from the shift. My desk dragged itself a few inches closer to the mirror. The air pulsed like a heartbeat, thick and suffocating.

Behind me, I could hear the thing move. Its footsteps didn’t match the floor. Like it wasn’t walking on wood, but something else entirely. Something wet. Something alive.

I clenched my jaw and looked at the board.

The next move had already been made.

A knight, creeping closer to my king.

I swallowed.

It was testing me.

I slid my fingers over a bishop, considering my options. If I took the knight, I’d expose my queen. If I moved my queen, I’d leave my king vulnerable.

Every move had a consequence.

I glanced at the mirror. My reflection was still watching, but its expression had changed.

No more grin. No amusement.

It looked worried.

That made two of us.

I shifted my bishop forward, threatening the knight. As soon as I let go, the room shuddered again.

The door to the hallway slowly creaked back open.

And the thing in the shadows stepped inside.

I gripped the edge of my desk so hard my knuckles turned white.

It was closer now. I still couldn’t see its face—if it even had one—but its shape was wrong. Its limbs were too long, its spine curved unnaturally. And worst of all, I could hear it breathing.

Deep, wet gasps. Like it was trying to taste the air.

I forced my eyes back to the board.

The game wasn’t over. I could still win.

The pieces rattled. Another had moved—on its own.

The knight was now right next to my king.

I was running out of time.

My reflection in the mirror shook its head.

Wrong move.

A chill crawled up my spine.

I turned back to the board, my heartbeat pounding in my ears.

I had to think. Had to be smart.

If this was a game, there was always a way out.

I looked at my pieces. Then I looked at my opponent’s.

And finally, I realized—

I wasn’t playing to win.

I was playing to survive.

The rules had been clear from the start. Every move I made changed the room. Changed what was coming for me.

But if I didn’t move—if I refused to play—

What happened then?

The thing in the room took another step closer.

I clenched my fists.

Then, for the first time since the game started—

I did nothing.

And the room went silent.

The silence pressed in on me, thick and absolute.

I didn’t move.

The thing in the room didn’t either.

The only sound was my own heartbeat, hammering inside my chest like it was trying to escape.

I kept my hands in my lap, fingers curled so tight they ached. My eyes flicked to the board.

No new moves.

The pieces remained frozen where they were. The knight still loomed over my king. A checkmate waiting to happen.

But it hadn’t happened yet.

The thing in the room shifted. I could hear it, the slow creak of weight pressing into the floor. The wet, dragging breaths—just behind me now. Close enough that I could feel the air change. Feel the cold creeping over my skin.

I kept my eyes down.

If I reacted, I’d lose.

My reflection in the mirror still watched, but something had changed. It wasn’t mirroring me anymore. It was moving on its own.

It raised its hand and tapped a finger against its temple.

Think.

I swallowed.

Then, slowly, I leaned forward and stared at the board.

There had to be something I was missing.

The game was still going. The thing in the room was still waiting.

Waiting for me to make the next move.

I studied the pieces. My opponent’s side.

And then—I saw it.

The one piece I hadn’t been paying attention to.

The king.

Not my king.

Theirs.

I inhaled sharply.

This wasn’t about survival. It never had been.

It was about winning.

And there was only one way to do that.

I reached out, slow and steady.

The thing in the room lurched forward.

I ignored it.

My fingers closed around my queen. I moved her.

The second I let go—

Checkmate.

The room convulsed.

A sound ripped through the air—something high-pitched and wrong, like metal scraping against bone. The walls blurred, folding in on themselves like paper. My desk split in half, the mirror cracked—

And the thing in the room—

It screamed.

Not a sound of pain.

A sound of rage.

I squeezed my eyes shut, gripping the edge of the table as the world collapsed around me.

And then—

Silence.

A different kind this time. Not heavy, not pressing.

Just... empty.

I opened my eyes.

The board was gone.

The room was normal again.

And I was alone.

At least, that’s what I thought.

Until I saw the mirror.

The reflection inside it?

It was still playing the game.

And this time—

It wasn’t me sitting in the chair.",1,1739476504.0,Creepystories,0,1.0,False
1iorwnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1iorwnk/i_make_100000_and_spent_5638_moving_crosscountry/,"I make ~$100,000 and spent $5,638 moving cross-country from Boston to San Francisco.","**Section 1: Bio**

I’m 25F and work as a Senior Research Associate in the biotech industry. My partner (also 25F) and I were previously living in Boston but wanted to try out the West Coast so made the cross-country move to SF. We also used the job break to travel around Europe for 7 weeks and spend time with friends and family in New England. 

Due to the timing, we ended up moving before having jobs and an apartment lined up. We had both been looking prior to the move but companies either wanted someone who could start right away or who was local to the area. This worked out for us but wouldn’t necessarily recommend unless you have a decent emergency fund, decent job opportunities, and few responsibilities (which we did!)

**Section 2: Assets and Debts**

Net worth at the time of the move was ~$57k (401k $25k, Roth IRA $17k, HSA $2k, company stock $1k, savings $12k). Accumulated in 2 years of full-time work. No home equity but also no debt. 

**Section 3: Income**

I was previously making $85k but received a raise to $96k 3 months before I left (after 2 years of working full time). Other sources of income include annual bonus, credit card rewards, gifts, and HYSA interest which total ~$5k. Take home pay after retirement, insurance, and taxes was $4,750/month. Expenses in Boston averaged around $2,700/month excluding travel. 

In comparison, my new role in SF has a total comp of $100k with target 10% bonus. Take home is similar ~$4,450/month. Expenses in SF after 3 months of living here (subject to change) average $3000/month. 

**Section 4: Day-to-Day Expenses**

Worth noting, I do not combine finances with my partner but we split costs for rent/utilities/groceries/etc. Numbers shown below will be for my portion only. SF numbers are based off of 3 months living here. 

Rent: $1,450 in Boston / $1,600 in SF
Utilities: $85 in Boston / $40 in SF
Food & drink: $440 in Boston / $440 in SF
Home & auto insurance: $55 / $110 in SF
Transportation: $75 in Boston / $170 in SF
Entertainment: $300 in Boston / $120 in SF

**Section 5: Moving Expenses**

*Total expenses: $11,276 total // $5,638 per person*

This is broken down into three sections: moving our belongings cross country, moving ourselves cross country, and settling in. 

We chose UBox instead of movers because we weren’t positive on timing and liked the option to store the boxes until we were ready for them. There are mixed reviews online but we had a good experience with the process and the movers on either end. 

We drove cross-country with the rest of our belongings and to get the car over there. Didn’t pack the car too full but brought: camping supplies, cleaning supplies, work appropriate / interview clothes, bike, cooking supplies, and plants along. Drove a 2015 Mazda CX5 with no issues. Decided to extend the road trip to see some National Parks/friends along the way, took ~16 days total. 

For settling in, this included apartment hunting and new resident costs. My partner’s relocation package included a full day rental tour with a broker which was helpful. 

*Moving belongings cross-country: $4668 total // $2334 pp*

* 2 UBox rentals: $425. This was more than enough to fit our belongings from a 2B apartment. Bulky furniture included: foldable bed frame, 2 dressers, 6 chairs, 1 disassembled table, 2 end tables, 2 night stands, 1 3 drawer cabinet, 1 disassembled couch, 1 tv, 1 bar cart. Plus all of our clothes and belongings and we had ~1/3 of a box to spare. 
* UBox transport Boston - SF: $2180. No issues here, we put an airtag in each box and took a picture of the number so we could track to make sure it made it. Our boxes actually made it to SF before we did because we took time to on our roadtrip. 
* UBox storage in CA: $221. Not necessary if you can move in right away. We found our apartment quickly but needed to wait to move in so paid to store the boxes for an extra month. 
* Movers: $1074. 2 movers each for each end of the trip. They loaded/unloaded the UBoxes for us completely and drove it to the storage locations. This includes tip and drinks for them. Could save some money by just getting the box delivered and packing/unpacking yourself. 
* Parking permits: $266. Unfortunately live on a busy road so couldn’t just double park, needed to reserve a spot for the truck and boxes on both ends. 
* Moving supplies: $69. Includes boxes, tape, packing paper, and locks for the UBoxes. 
* New roof rack for car: $433. My parents had a spare cargo box but needed to fit a roof rack to the car. This was helpful for fitting stuff we would need during the first few weeks of living in SF before moving our stuff into the new apartment. 

*Moving selves cross-country: $1470 total //  $735 pp*

* Lodging: $420. 5 campgrounds, 3 airbnbs, 1 hostel, and 2 free stays with friends/family
* Food & drink: $460. Mostly groceries with some stops at restaurants (primarily Culvers) and liquor stores. 
* Gas, tolls, parking: $350. 
* Activities: $90. Already had a NP pass so this includes entrance to state parks, a cave tour, and boat ride across Jenny Lake. 
* Souvenirs: $150. Got a couple of T shirts, hats + magnets/stickers for the national parks we stopped at. 

*Settling in: $5138 total // $2569 pp*

* Airbnb: $917. Rented an Airbnb for 2 weeks while apartment hunting. Was more expensive than expected but needed parking and good transit access for reaching different neighborhoods. We found our apartment and moved in early so received a partial refund. 
* Apartment application: $50. Only applied to one and we were accepted :)
* Security deposit: $2895. 
* Car registration and new license: $906. This one hurt. Had to pay the sales tax on the current value of the car because it was out of state, get new plates, and a new real ID. 
* New furniture: $370. Replaced what we got rid of before the move through a mix of FB marketplace and Wayfair. TV stand, coffee table, 2x bookcases, headboard, plants. 

Tried to make this as comprehensive as possible, but might be missing some things. Happy to answer any questions!

1iorwjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1iorwjj/the_window/,The Window,"My boots crunched over damp leaves as I followed the winding trail deeper into the woods. The air smelled of moss and earth, thick with the scent of rain that had passed through earlier in the day. I was supposed to stick to the main path, but curiosity had gotten the better of me.

The forest was quiet. Too quiet.

I had hiked these woods before, but I had never seen this clearing.

The trees parted around it, their skeletal branches curling inward like fingers. The grass was overgrown, patches of wildflowers dotting the landscape. But none of that mattered—because in the very center of the clearing stood a window.

Just a frame. No glass.

It was tall and weathered, the paint long stripped away by time. It looked like it had been ripped from an old house and placed here, upright, with no walls to support it.

My stomach twisted. Something about it felt… wrong.

I stepped closer.

From this side, I saw only the forest beyond. Trees stretched toward the sky, the same as before. But when I moved—just slightly—so that I was directly in front of it…

I stopped breathing.

Through the empty frame, I saw my bedroom.

Not just a bedroom that looked like mine. My bedroom.

The familiar bookshelf stood against the far wall, overflowing with half-read novels and trinkets. My desk, cluttered with notes and empty coffee cups, sat beside it. The curtains were drawn, the dim glow of my bedside lamp casting long shadows over the walls.

And there, lying in bed, was me.

I stumbled back, my heartbeat slamming against my ribs. My mind scrambled for a rational explanation, but nothing made sense. I wasn’t dreaming—I could feel the cool air on my skin, the dampness from the earlier rain still clinging to my jacket.

I took another step forward, peering through the frame again. The scene hadn’t changed.

The figure—I—was still there, curled under the covers. My chest rose and fell with steady breaths, my head turned slightly toward the window. But then, as I watched…

I opened my eyes.

Not the me standing here.

The me in the bed.

I stared at myself, and myself stared back.

The figure in the bed didn’t move. Just lay there, eyes wide, locked onto mine through the window in the forest.

A chill ran down my spine.

I raised a shaking hand.

The me in the window raised one, too.

I turned my head slightly.

So did they.

I was about to step back—to run—when something changed.

The figure’s lips parted. A slow, stretching smile spread across its face. Too wide.

Then, ever so slightly, it shook its head.

I gasped and stumbled backward. My foot caught on a root, and I hit the ground hard, my hands scraping against damp earth. The moment I was out of view, the connection broke. I couldn’t see the bedroom anymore—just trees, rustling slightly in the wind.

My breath came in ragged bursts.

I pushed myself up and bolted, not stopping to look back.

But as I ran, a new, horrifying thought crept in:

What if, when I got home, I wasn’t the one waiting there?

I ran.

Branches whipped at my arms as I pushed through the undergrowth, feet slipping on the damp earth. My heartbeat pounded in my ears, my breath ragged. The forest felt darker now, the trees pressing in, shadows stretching longer than they should.

I kept expecting to hear footsteps behind me, but the woods were silent. Too silent. No wind. No birds. Just my own panicked breathing.

I didn’t stop until I reached my car.

It sat where I had left it, parked at the end of the trail, half-hidden by the overgrown brush. My hands shook as I yanked open the door and threw myself inside, slamming it shut behind me.

For a moment, I just sat there, gripping the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles turned white. My mind raced, trying to make sense of what I had seen.

It wasn’t possible.

It had to be some kind of trick.

Maybe I had inhaled something weird in the woods. Maybe there was some logical explanation—an optical illusion, a hallucination, anything other than what my gut was telling me.

That I had just seen myself.

And that it—whatever it was—had seen me too.

I forced a deep breath and turned the key. The engine rumbled to life, breaking the awful silence. My headlights flicked on, illuminating the trees ahead, casting long, skeletal shadows across the dirt path.

I didn’t look back.

The drive home was a blur.

I kept checking my rearview mirror, expecting to see something on the road behind me. A shape in the distance. A figure standing in the middle of the street.

But there was nothing. Just the empty highway stretching out behind me, the headlights cutting through the darkness.

By the time I pulled into my driveway, my nerves were raw.

My house looked the same as always—porch light glowing softly, curtains drawn over the windows. Familiar. Safe.

But the moment I stepped out of the car, I hesitated.

What if I was already inside?

The thought sent a shudder through me. It was irrational. Impossible. I had just imagined it.

Right?

I swallowed hard and walked up to the front door. My hands were clammy as I unlocked it and pushed it open.

The house was quiet.

I stepped inside, locking the door behind me. My ears strained for any sound, any sign that someone—or something—was here. But all I could hear was the soft hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen, the distant ticking of the clock in the hallway.

I let out a slow breath.

Everything was fine.

Still, my skin prickled as I made my way down the hall. My bedroom door was closed. It hadn’t been when I left.

I stood there, staring at it. My pulse pounded in my throat.

What if I opened that door and saw myself lying in bed?

I reached for the handle.

Turned it.

Pushed the door open.

The room was empty.

The bed was neatly made, the curtains drawn, the dim glow of the bedside lamp casting soft shadows over the walls. Exactly how I had left it.

My breath shuddered out of me. I felt stupid now, standing there in my own bedroom, shaken over nothing.

I was exhausted. My mind was playing tricks on me.

I closed the door behind me and sat on the edge of the bed, rubbing my face with my hands. The image of that thing in the window was burned into my brain. That smile. The way it had shaken its head, like it knew something I didn’t.

I needed to sleep.

I crawled under the covers and reached for my phone on the nightstand. The screen lit up.

And then, every nerve in my body went cold.

Because there was a notification.

A photo.

A new AirDrop request from an unknown sender.

My breath hitched. My thumb trembled as I opened it.

And there, staring back at me, was a photo of my bedroom. Taken from the doorway.

I whipped my head toward the door.

It was still closed.

But I wasn’t alone.

I couldn’t move.

My fingers clenched around my phone, my breath coming in short, shallow bursts. The photo on the screen—it wasn’t possible. I had just walked into my room. The door had been closed. Locked.

But someone—or something—had been standing right there, taking a picture.

I forced myself to look up, my eyes locked on the bedroom door. It was still closed. The brass handle gleamed in the dim light, perfectly still.

No one was there.

At least, no one I could see.

I swallowed hard, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. My mind raced through explanations. A prank? But who? The woods were miles away from anything, and I had been alone all day.

A hacker? But how would they have taken that picture?

My hands shook as I tapped the screen, heart hammering as I checked the AirDrop sender.

Unknown.

Of course.

I tapped the photo, zooming in, searching for anything—a shadow, a reflection, something that would give me a clue. But it was just my room. Empty. Like the photo had been taken a second before I entered.

A cold sweat prickled down my spine.

I needed to check the house.

I slid out of bed slowly, my bare feet touching the floor without a sound. Every nerve in my body screamed at me to stay put, to pretend I never saw the photo.

But I couldn’t ignore it.

I crept to the door and pressed my ear against it. Silence. Not even the hum of the refrigerator now. Just a thick, unnatural stillness.

I turned the knob.

The door creaked open.

The hallway was empty, bathed in soft shadows from the nightlight in the wall. My living room was just beyond, the kitchen tucked to the right. The air felt wrong, like the house was holding its breath.

I stepped out.

Every instinct told me something was here, something unseen, watching.

The floor was cool under my feet as I padded down the hall, scanning every dark corner, every doorway. The front door was locked. The windows were shut. Nothing seemed out of place.

But then I noticed something.

The curtain in the living room.

When I had left earlier that day, it had been open, letting in the soft afternoon light. Now it was drawn.

I stared at it, dread pooling in my stomach.

I took a step forward.

Another.

I reached out, hesitating just before touching the fabric. A single breath of cold air brushed against my hand.

Then—the curtain twitched.

I stumbled back, heart slamming against my ribs.

For a moment, nothing happened. The curtain hung still. Just fabric. Just my imagination.

Then, slowly, the fabric parted.

And behind it—

There was nothing.

Not a wall. Not a window. Just a pitch-black void.

I choked on a breath, my legs locked in place.

That wasn’t my window.

It wasn’t anything.

Just an endless, empty dark.

Then, from that darkness, something moved.

I didn’t wait to see what it was.

I ran.

I tore down the hall, feet barely touching the floor, throwing myself into my bedroom and slamming the door behind me.

My hands fumbled for the lock. Click.

I backed away, panting. My phone was still clutched in my hand, the screen glowing in the dim light. The photo was still open.

But now, there was a second picture.

My stomach turned to ice.

I didn’t AirDrop this.

I didn’t take this.

But there it was. A new photo, taken from the same doorway.

Except now, I was in the bed.

And standing over me—

Was a shadow.

Not a person. Not a shape I could define. Just wrongness. A smudge of black, featureless, leaning over my sleeping body.

The air in my lungs turned to stone.

My gaze darted to the bed.

It was empty. Untouched.

I looked back at the photo.

And this time—

The shadow’s head had turned.

It was looking at me.

I couldn’t breathe.

I wanted to scream, to move, to do something, but all I could do was stare at the photo.

At it.

That shadowy figure, that formless, wrong thing was no longer just standing over my sleeping body. It was facing me.

My fingers felt numb as I lowered the phone, forcing myself to look at my room.

The bed was still empty. The doorway was clear.

There was nothing there.

But that didn’t mean I was alone.

I swallowed hard, my throat dry, my ears straining for any sound. The house was silent. Not the normal, peaceful quiet of the night.

This silence felt heavy. Suffocating. Like something was waiting.

I needed to get out.

I turned, grabbing my bag from the chair. My car keys were inside. I just needed to make it to the front door, get in the car, and drive. Anywhere.

I reached for the doorknob.

The second my fingers touched it—

A sound.

Soft.

A creak.

Like weight shifting on the floor behind me.

I froze.

The bed was empty. I had checked. I knew it was empty.

But something was there now.

I turned my head just enough to glance at my phone’s screen.

The photo had changed again.

The shadow wasn’t over my bed anymore.

It was standing right behind me.

I spun around—

Nothing.

But my mirror—

The mirror on the far wall, the one across from my bed—

It wasn’t empty.

I was there. Standing. Staring.

But I wasn’t alone.

A shape loomed behind me.

Not quite touching.

Not quite human.

Just a mass of blackness, shifting, twisting, watching.

I barely had time to think before the lights flickered.

Then went out.

The darkness swallowed me whole.

I gasped, my heart hammering so hard I could feel it in my throat. My phone—the only light left—flickered too, the screen distorting, static warping the image.

I could still see my reflection.

And the thing behind me.

It was closer now.

So close that if it had a mouth, it could whisper in my ear.

I couldn’t breathe.

I squeezed my eyes shut, my fingers curling so tightly around my phone it hurt.

This isn’t real.

It couldn’t be.

I had to move.

I forced myself to take a step back, reaching for the wall, for the door, for anything solid.

My fingers found the handle.

I turned it.

The door wouldn’t open.

Something pressed against my back.

Not a hand. Not a body. Just pressure. Like the air itself had thickened, molding around me, holding me in place.

My reflection twitched.

My reflection smiled.

My reflection wasn’t me anymore.

The lights flickered back on.

And I was alone.

The pressure was gone. The room was silent again.

My legs nearly gave out as I stumbled away from the mirror, shoving my phone into my pocket, trying to catch my breath.

I had to go.

I didn’t care if the door was locked. I would break a window, run barefoot into the woods if I had to.

But when I turned back to the door—

It was open.

Just a crack.

And from the dark hallway beyond, something laughed.

A dry, rasping, inhuman sound.

I didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Didn’t breathe.

Then—

The door creaked open.

And I saw it.

Not a shadow this time. Not a reflection.

Something real.

Something that had been waiting.

And it was smiling at me.

I ran.

I didn’t think. Didn’t look back.

I ran.

The hallway stretched ahead of me, warped by shadows that flickered in the dim light. The walls felt too close, the air too thick. The thing behind me—whatever it was—was still there. Watching. Waiting.

But it wasn’t stopping me.

That was worse.

I didn’t care where I was going, just that I had to get out. Out of the house. Out of the town. Away from whatever had stepped through that window in the woods.

My hand slammed against the front door.

Unlocked.

I didn’t hesitate.

The night air hit me like a shock of cold water, but I didn’t stop. My car was pointless—keys still in my bag, bag still upstairs, and I wasn’t about to go back.

The only place left to go was the one place I never should have been in the first place.

The woods.

I sprinted across the yard, my lungs burning, my legs screaming. I didn’t care. The trees loomed ahead, dark and endless, swallowing the last bits of moonlight. My chest tightened at the thought of stepping back into them.

But I had no choice.

Because something was behind me.

I heard it. A slow, dragging step. Not running. Not chasing.

Because it didn’t have to.

I hit the treeline at full speed, branches clawing at my arms, twigs snapping beneath my feet. The deeper I went, the quieter the world became.

Like it was holding its breath.

I didn’t know where I was going. My phone was still in my pocket, but I wasn’t about to slow down and check the time. Or the messages. Or the camera.

Not after what I had seen.

The clearing.

That was the only answer.

I had to find it again.

I pushed forward, lungs burning, feet aching, my mind screaming at me to turn back—but there was nothing to turn back to.

The laughter followed me.

That dry, rasping sound. Closer now.

I bit down on a whimper, refusing to look back. I wasn’t fast enough. It was always right there.

A root caught my foot.

I hit the ground hard.

Pain shot up my arms, my palms scraping against rock and dirt. I gasped, trying to push myself up—

And then I saw it.

Ahead, in the distance.

The window.

Still standing in the clearing. Still wrong.

Still showing something I knew wasn’t real.

I scrambled to my feet, ignoring the way my body ached, the way my breath came in sharp, uneven gasps.

I had come back here for a reason.

I didn’t know what it was.

But something did.

The laughter stopped.

And I knew, without looking—

It was standing right behind me.

I didn’t want to turn around.

I knew it was there. I felt it. Close enough that if I moved too slowly, if I hesitated for even a second, it could reach out and—

No.

I couldn’t think about that.

The window was in front of me. Still standing in the clearing. Still impossible.

The scene inside hadn’t changed.

My bedroom. Exactly as I had left it.

Except for one thing.

The figure in my bed was sitting up now.

I could see its head tilt toward me. A shadowy blur, just out of focus.

I didn’t have time to think.

I ran straight for it.

My body slammed into the frame, and for a brief, impossible second, I thought I’d just crash through it. Fall forward into nothing. But instead—

The world snapped.

A cold rush of air sucked the breath from my lungs, like I was being pulled through a vacuum. My ears popped, and everything went silent. My vision fractured, like looking through broken glass—flashes of movement, color, but nothing that made sense.

Then—

I hit the floor.

Hard.

My limbs tangled beneath me, and I gasped as the air punched from my chest. The world spun. My head throbbed. The silence stretched out, thick and unnatural, pressing in from every direction.

I forced myself to sit up, blinking against the disorientation.

And then I saw it.

I was home.

Or—

It looked like home.

I was sitting on my bedroom floor, facing the bed. The sheets were rumpled, just like they had been when I left. My phone was still on the nightstand, its screen dark. The window in the wall showed the same quiet neighborhood street.

For a second, I almost believed it.

Then my eyes landed on the door.

It was wrong.

Slightly too tall. The edges too sharp.

And the shadows beneath it—

They moved.

A slow, pulsing shift, as if something on the other side was breathing.

I pushed myself to my feet. My hands were shaking. I didn’t know what I had expected, but I knew this wasn’t right.

I turned back to the window, hoping—praying—that I could step through it again.

But it was gone.

Just a blank wall.

Like it had never been there at all.

A soft creak behind me.

I spun around, heart slamming against my ribs.

The door had opened.

Not all the way. Just enough to show the darkened hallway beyond.

And in that hallway, something stood waiting.

Not moving. Not breathing.

Just watching.

I swallowed hard. My throat was dry, my pulse hammering in my ears.

I wasn’t in my house.

Not anymore.

And whatever was in here with me—

It knew.

I didn’t move.

Neither did it.

The figure in the hallway was just standing there, its shape obscured by shadows. Too tall. Too still.

Then—

It tilted its head.

A slow, deliberate motion. Not human. Not natural. Like it was trying to understand me.

Something deep inside me screamed to run. But I didn’t.

Because behind me, from the wall where the window should have been, a voice whispered—

“Don’t.”

I stiffened. My breath caught in my throat.

It was my voice.

I turned my head slightly, just enough to see the mirror hanging on the far wall.

Except—

It wasn’t just a reflection.

I was standing in it.

My reflection was looking at me—but its lips were moving on their own.

“Don’t run. It wants you to.”

The thing in the hallway took a step forward.

I flinched. My reflection didn’t.

“It plays by rules.” The whisper came again. “Play back.”

Rules.

I swallowed hard, my mind racing.

Everything here was wrong, but it had structure. The window had worked like a portal. The door had opened when I acknowledged it. And this… thing… was waiting for me to react.

Like a game.

I looked at my reflection, meeting my own eyes. “What do I do?” I mouthed.

The other me smiled.

Not a reassuring smile. Not comforting.

It was a grin full of knowing.

“Use the board.”

I frowned. The board?

I glanced back at the room. My room. Everything was identical to how I’d left it. My bed, my phone, my desk—

Then I saw it.

My chessboard.

It was set up on my desk, mid-game. The last match I’d played against myself. White’s move.

I didn’t have time to question it.

I walked toward it slowly, forcing my breathing to stay even. Behind me, I could hear the thing in the hallway shifting, its movements slow, patient.

Waiting.

I reached the desk and studied the board. My last move had left my queen exposed. If I was playing against myself, I’d take it with a knight.

I lifted the black knight and moved it.

As soon as I let go, the door slammed shut.

A gust of air rattled through the room, making the walls tremble.

I turned back toward the mirror. My reflection was nodding.

“Good.”

The ground beneath me shuddered. The walls stretched, as if the entire room was breathing. The air grew thick, heavy, pressing in on me.

Another piece had moved on the board. Not by me.

Black pawn, two spaces forward.

My turn again.

A sick realization settled in my stomach.

I wasn’t playing alone.

I turned toward the door.

The thing in the hallway—whatever it was—was still there. Except now… it was smiling too.

I exhaled slowly and faced the board again.

If this was a game—

I had to win.

I didn’t look up from the board. I didn’t dare.

Whatever was in the hallway wanted me to react, and I wasn’t going to give it the satisfaction.

I studied the pieces, my hands clammy as I reached for my next move.

Pawn to e4.

I let go.

The second I did, the entire room lurched sideways, like the floor itself had tipped.

I staggered, barely keeping my balance as my stomach twisted from the shift. My desk dragged itself a few inches closer to the mirror. The air pulsed like a heartbeat, thick and suffocating.

Behind me, I could hear the thing move. Its footsteps didn’t match the floor. Like it wasn’t walking on wood, but something else entirely. Something wet. Something alive.

I clenched my jaw and looked at the board.

The next move had already been made.

A knight, creeping closer to my king.

I swallowed.

It was testing me.

I slid my fingers over a bishop, considering my options. If I took the knight, I’d expose my queen. If I moved my queen, I’d leave my king vulnerable.

Every move had a consequence.

I glanced at the mirror. My reflection was still watching, but its expression had changed.

No more grin. No amusement.

It looked worried.

That made two of us.

I shifted my bishop forward, threatening the knight. As soon as I let go, the room shuddered again.

The door to the hallway slowly creaked back open.

And the thing in the shadows stepped inside.

I gripped the edge of my desk so hard my knuckles turned white.

It was closer now. I still couldn’t see its face—if it even had one—but its shape was wrong. Its limbs were too long, its spine curved unnaturally. And worst of all, I could hear it breathing.

Deep, wet gasps. Like it was trying to taste the air.

I forced my eyes back to the board.

The game wasn’t over. I could still win.

The pieces rattled. Another had moved—on its own.

The knight was now right next to my king.

I was running out of time.

My reflection in the mirror shook its head.

Wrong move.

A chill crawled up my spine.

I turned back to the board, my heartbeat pounding in my ears.

I had to think. Had to be smart.

If this was a game, there was always a way out.

I looked at my pieces. Then I looked at my opponent’s.

And finally, I realized—

I wasn’t playing to win.

I was playing to survive.

The rules had been clear from the start. Every move I made changed the room. Changed what was coming for me.

But if I didn’t move—if I refused to play—

What happened then?

The thing in the room took another step closer.

I clenched my fists.

Then, for the first time since the game started—

I did nothing.

And the room went silent.

The silence pressed in on me, thick and absolute.

I didn’t move.

The thing in the room didn’t either.

The only sound was my own heartbeat, hammering inside my chest like it was trying to escape.

I kept my hands in my lap, fingers curled so tight they ached. My eyes flicked to the board.

No new moves.

The pieces remained frozen where they were. The knight still loomed over my king. A checkmate waiting to happen.

But it hadn’t happened yet.

The thing in the room shifted. I could hear it, the slow creak of weight pressing into the floor. The wet, dragging breaths—just behind me now. Close enough that I could feel the air change. Feel the cold creeping over my skin.

I kept my eyes down.

If I reacted, I’d lose.

My reflection in the mirror still watched, but something had changed. It wasn’t mirroring me anymore. It was moving on its own.

It raised its hand and tapped a finger against its temple.

Think.

I swallowed.

Then, slowly, I leaned forward and stared at the board.

There had to be something I was missing.

The game was still going. The thing in the room was still waiting.

Waiting for me to make the next move.

I studied the pieces. My opponent’s side.

And then—I saw it.

The one piece I hadn’t been paying attention to.

The king.

Not my king.

Theirs.

I inhaled sharply.

This wasn’t about survival. It never had been.

It was about winning.

And there was only one way to do that.

I reached out, slow and steady.

The thing in the room lurched forward.

I ignored it.

My fingers closed around my queen. I moved her.

The second I let go—

Checkmate.

The room convulsed.

A sound ripped through the air—something high-pitched and wrong, like metal scraping against bone. The walls blurred, folding in on themselves like paper. My desk split in half, the mirror cracked—

And the thing in the room—

It screamed.

Not a sound of pain.

A sound of rage.

I squeezed my eyes shut, gripping the edge of the table as the world collapsed around me.

And then—

Silence.

A different kind this time. Not heavy, not pressing.

Just... empty.

I opened my eyes.

The board was gone.

The room was normal again.

And I was alone.

At least, that’s what I thought.

Until I saw the mirror.

The reflection inside it?

It was still playing the game.

And this time—

It wasn’t me sitting in the chair.",1,1739476490.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1iorwc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1iorwc1/the_window/,The Window,"My boots crunched over damp leaves as I followed the winding trail deeper into the woods. The air smelled of moss and earth, thick with the scent of rain that had passed through earlier in the day. I was supposed to stick to the main path, but curiosity had gotten the better of me.

The forest was quiet. Too quiet.

I had hiked these woods before, but I had never seen this clearing.

The trees parted around it, their skeletal branches curling inward like fingers. The grass was overgrown, patches of wildflowers dotting the landscape. But none of that mattered—because in the very center of the clearing stood a window.

Just a frame. No glass.

It was tall and weathered, the paint long stripped away by time. It looked like it had been ripped from an old house and placed here, upright, with no walls to support it.

My stomach twisted. Something about it felt… wrong.

I stepped closer.

From this side, I saw only the forest beyond. Trees stretched toward the sky, the same as before. But when I moved—just slightly—so that I was directly in front of it…

I stopped breathing.

Through the empty frame, I saw my bedroom.

Not just a bedroom that looked like mine. My bedroom.

The familiar bookshelf stood against the far wall, overflowing with half-read novels and trinkets. My desk, cluttered with notes and empty coffee cups, sat beside it. The curtains were drawn, the dim glow of my bedside lamp casting long shadows over the walls.

And there, lying in bed, was me.

I stumbled back, my heartbeat slamming against my ribs. My mind scrambled for a rational explanation, but nothing made sense. I wasn’t dreaming—I could feel the cool air on my skin, the dampness from the earlier rain still clinging to my jacket.

I took another step forward, peering through the frame again. The scene hadn’t changed.

The figure—I—was still there, curled under the covers. My chest rose and fell with steady breaths, my head turned slightly toward the window. But then, as I watched…

I opened my eyes.

Not the me standing here.

The me in the bed.

I stared at myself, and myself stared back.

The figure in the bed didn’t move. Just lay there, eyes wide, locked onto mine through the window in the forest.

A chill ran down my spine.

I raised a shaking hand.

The me in the window raised one, too.

I turned my head slightly.

So did they.

I was about to step back—to run—when something changed.

The figure’s lips parted. A slow, stretching smile spread across its face. Too wide.

Then, ever so slightly, it shook its head.

I gasped and stumbled backward. My foot caught on a root, and I hit the ground hard, my hands scraping against damp earth. The moment I was out of view, the connection broke. I couldn’t see the bedroom anymore—just trees, rustling slightly in the wind.

My breath came in ragged bursts.

I pushed myself up and bolted, not stopping to look back.

But as I ran, a new, horrifying thought crept in:

What if, when I got home, I wasn’t the one waiting there?

I ran.

Branches whipped at my arms as I pushed through the undergrowth, feet slipping on the damp earth. My heartbeat pounded in my ears, my breath ragged. The forest felt darker now, the trees pressing in, shadows stretching longer than they should.

I kept expecting to hear footsteps behind me, but the woods were silent. Too silent. No wind. No birds. Just my own panicked breathing.

I didn’t stop until I reached my car.

It sat where I had left it, parked at the end of the trail, half-hidden by the overgrown brush. My hands shook as I yanked open the door and threw myself inside, slamming it shut behind me.

For a moment, I just sat there, gripping the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles turned white. My mind raced, trying to make sense of what I had seen.

It wasn’t possible.

It had to be some kind of trick.

Maybe I had inhaled something weird in the woods. Maybe there was some logical explanation—an optical illusion, a hallucination, anything other than what my gut was telling me.

That I had just seen myself.

And that it—whatever it was—had seen me too.

I forced a deep breath and turned the key. The engine rumbled to life, breaking the awful silence. My headlights flicked on, illuminating the trees ahead, casting long, skeletal shadows across the dirt path.

I didn’t look back.

The drive home was a blur.

I kept checking my rearview mirror, expecting to see something on the road behind me. A shape in the distance. A figure standing in the middle of the street.

But there was nothing. Just the empty highway stretching out behind me, the headlights cutting through the darkness.

By the time I pulled into my driveway, my nerves were raw.

My house looked the same as always—porch light glowing softly, curtains drawn over the windows. Familiar. Safe.

But the moment I stepped out of the car, I hesitated.

What if I was already inside?

The thought sent a shudder through me. It was irrational. Impossible. I had just imagined it.

Right?

I swallowed hard and walked up to the front door. My hands were clammy as I unlocked it and pushed it open.

The house was quiet.

I stepped inside, locking the door behind me. My ears strained for any sound, any sign that someone—or something—was here. But all I could hear was the soft hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen, the distant ticking of the clock in the hallway.

I let out a slow breath.

Everything was fine.

Still, my skin prickled as I made my way down the hall. My bedroom door was closed. It hadn’t been when I left.

I stood there, staring at it. My pulse pounded in my throat.

What if I opened that door and saw myself lying in bed?

I reached for the handle.

Turned it.

Pushed the door open.

The room was empty.

The bed was neatly made, the curtains drawn, the dim glow of the bedside lamp casting soft shadows over the walls. Exactly how I had left it.

My breath shuddered out of me. I felt stupid now, standing there in my own bedroom, shaken over nothing.

I was exhausted. My mind was playing tricks on me.

I closed the door behind me and sat on the edge of the bed, rubbing my face with my hands. The image of that thing in the window was burned into my brain. That smile. The way it had shaken its head, like it knew something I didn’t.

I needed to sleep.

I crawled under the covers and reached for my phone on the nightstand. The screen lit up.

And then, every nerve in my body went cold.

Because there was a notification.

A photo.

A new AirDrop request from an unknown sender.

My breath hitched. My thumb trembled as I opened it.

And there, staring back at me, was a photo of my bedroom. Taken from the doorway.

I whipped my head toward the door.

It was still closed.

But I wasn’t alone.

I couldn’t move.

My fingers clenched around my phone, my breath coming in short, shallow bursts. The photo on the screen—it wasn’t possible. I had just walked into my room. The door had been closed. Locked.

But someone—or something—had been standing right there, taking a picture.

I forced myself to look up, my eyes locked on the bedroom door. It was still closed. The brass handle gleamed in the dim light, perfectly still.

No one was there.

At least, no one I could see.

I swallowed hard, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. My mind raced through explanations. A prank? But who? The woods were miles away from anything, and I had been alone all day.

A hacker? But how would they have taken that picture?

My hands shook as I tapped the screen, heart hammering as I checked the AirDrop sender.

Unknown.

Of course.

I tapped the photo, zooming in, searching for anything—a shadow, a reflection, something that would give me a clue. But it was just my room. Empty. Like the photo had been taken a second before I entered.

A cold sweat prickled down my spine.

I needed to check the house.

I slid out of bed slowly, my bare feet touching the floor without a sound. Every nerve in my body screamed at me to stay put, to pretend I never saw the photo.

But I couldn’t ignore it.

I crept to the door and pressed my ear against it. Silence. Not even the hum of the refrigerator now. Just a thick, unnatural stillness.

I turned the knob.

The door creaked open.

The hallway was empty, bathed in soft shadows from the nightlight in the wall. My living room was just beyond, the kitchen tucked to the right. The air felt wrong, like the house was holding its breath.

I stepped out.

Every instinct told me something was here, something unseen, watching.

The floor was cool under my feet as I padded down the hall, scanning every dark corner, every doorway. The front door was locked. The windows were shut. Nothing seemed out of place.

But then I noticed something.

The curtain in the living room.

When I had left earlier that day, it had been open, letting in the soft afternoon light. Now it was drawn.

I stared at it, dread pooling in my stomach.

I took a step forward.

Another.

I reached out, hesitating just before touching the fabric. A single breath of cold air brushed against my hand.

Then—the curtain twitched.

I stumbled back, heart slamming against my ribs.

For a moment, nothing happened. The curtain hung still. Just fabric. Just my imagination.

Then, slowly, the fabric parted.

And behind it—

There was nothing.

Not a wall. Not a window. Just a pitch-black void.

I choked on a breath, my legs locked in place.

That wasn’t my window.

It wasn’t anything.

Just an endless, empty dark.

Then, from that darkness, something moved.

I didn’t wait to see what it was.

I ran.

I tore down the hall, feet barely touching the floor, throwing myself into my bedroom and slamming the door behind me.

My hands fumbled for the lock. Click.

I backed away, panting. My phone was still clutched in my hand, the screen glowing in the dim light. The photo was still open.

But now, there was a second picture.

My stomach turned to ice.

I didn’t AirDrop this.

I didn’t take this.

But there it was. A new photo, taken from the same doorway.

Except now, I was in the bed.

And standing over me—

Was a shadow.

Not a person. Not a shape I could define. Just wrongness. A smudge of black, featureless, leaning over my sleeping body.

The air in my lungs turned to stone.

My gaze darted to the bed.

It was empty. Untouched.

I looked back at the photo.

And this time—

The shadow’s head had turned.

It was looking at me.

I couldn’t breathe.

I wanted to scream, to move, to do something, but all I could do was stare at the photo.

At it.

That shadowy figure, that formless, wrong thing was no longer just standing over my sleeping body. It was facing me.

My fingers felt numb as I lowered the phone, forcing myself to look at my room.

The bed was still empty. The doorway was clear.

There was nothing there.

But that didn’t mean I was alone.

I swallowed hard, my throat dry, my ears straining for any sound. The house was silent. Not the normal, peaceful quiet of the night.

This silence felt heavy. Suffocating. Like something was waiting.

I needed to get out.

I turned, grabbing my bag from the chair. My car keys were inside. I just needed to make it to the front door, get in the car, and drive. Anywhere.

I reached for the doorknob.

The second my fingers touched it—

A sound.

Soft.

A creak.

Like weight shifting on the floor behind me.

I froze.

The bed was empty. I had checked. I knew it was empty.

But something was there now.

I turned my head just enough to glance at my phone’s screen.

The photo had changed again.

The shadow wasn’t over my bed anymore.

It was standing right behind me.

I spun around—

Nothing.

But my mirror—

The mirror on the far wall, the one across from my bed—

It wasn’t empty.

I was there. Standing. Staring.

But I wasn’t alone.

A shape loomed behind me.

Not quite touching.

Not quite human.

Just a mass of blackness, shifting, twisting, watching.

I barely had time to think before the lights flickered.

Then went out.

The darkness swallowed me whole.

I gasped, my heart hammering so hard I could feel it in my throat. My phone—the only light left—flickered too, the screen distorting, static warping the image.

I could still see my reflection.

And the thing behind me.

It was closer now.

So close that if it had a mouth, it could whisper in my ear.

I couldn’t breathe.

I squeezed my eyes shut, my fingers curling so tightly around my phone it hurt.

This isn’t real.

It couldn’t be.

I had to move.

I forced myself to take a step back, reaching for the wall, for the door, for anything solid.

My fingers found the handle.

I turned it.

The door wouldn’t open.

Something pressed against my back.

Not a hand. Not a body. Just pressure. Like the air itself had thickened, molding around me, holding me in place.

My reflection twitched.

My reflection smiled.

My reflection wasn’t me anymore.

The lights flickered back on.

And I was alone.

The pressure was gone. The room was silent again.

My legs nearly gave out as I stumbled away from the mirror, shoving my phone into my pocket, trying to catch my breath.

I had to go.

I didn’t care if the door was locked. I would break a window, run barefoot into the woods if I had to.

But when I turned back to the door—

It was open.

Just a crack.

And from the dark hallway beyond, something laughed.

A dry, rasping, inhuman sound.

I didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Didn’t breathe.

Then—

The door creaked open.

And I saw it.

Not a shadow this time. Not a reflection.

Something real.

Something that had been waiting.

And it was smiling at me.

I ran.

I didn’t think. Didn’t look back.

I ran.

The hallway stretched ahead of me, warped by shadows that flickered in the dim light. The walls felt too close, the air too thick. The thing behind me—whatever it was—was still there. Watching. Waiting.

But it wasn’t stopping me.

That was worse.

I didn’t care where I was going, just that I had to get out. Out of the house. Out of the town. Away from whatever had stepped through that window in the woods.

My hand slammed against the front door.

Unlocked.

I didn’t hesitate.

The night air hit me like a shock of cold water, but I didn’t stop. My car was pointless—keys still in my bag, bag still upstairs, and I wasn’t about to go back.

The only place left to go was the one place I never should have been in the first place.

The woods.

I sprinted across the yard, my lungs burning, my legs screaming. I didn’t care. The trees loomed ahead, dark and endless, swallowing the last bits of moonlight. My chest tightened at the thought of stepping back into them.

But I had no choice.

Because something was behind me.

I heard it. A slow, dragging step. Not running. Not chasing.

Because it didn’t have to.

I hit the treeline at full speed, branches clawing at my arms, twigs snapping beneath my feet. The deeper I went, the quieter the world became.

Like it was holding its breath.

I didn’t know where I was going. My phone was still in my pocket, but I wasn’t about to slow down and check the time. Or the messages. Or the camera.

Not after what I had seen.

The clearing.

That was the only answer.

I had to find it again.

I pushed forward, lungs burning, feet aching, my mind screaming at me to turn back—but there was nothing to turn back to.

The laughter followed me.

That dry, rasping sound. Closer now.

I bit down on a whimper, refusing to look back. I wasn’t fast enough. It was always right there.

A root caught my foot.

I hit the ground hard.

Pain shot up my arms, my palms scraping against rock and dirt. I gasped, trying to push myself up—

And then I saw it.

Ahead, in the distance.

The window.

Still standing in the clearing. Still wrong.

Still showing something I knew wasn’t real.

I scrambled to my feet, ignoring the way my body ached, the way my breath came in sharp, uneven gasps.

I had come back here for a reason.

I didn’t know what it was.

But something did.

The laughter stopped.

And I knew, without looking—

It was standing right behind me.

I didn’t want to turn around.

I knew it was there. I felt it. Close enough that if I moved too slowly, if I hesitated for even a second, it could reach out and—

No.

I couldn’t think about that.

The window was in front of me. Still standing in the clearing. Still impossible.

The scene inside hadn’t changed.

My bedroom. Exactly as I had left it.

Except for one thing.

The figure in my bed was sitting up now.

I could see its head tilt toward me. A shadowy blur, just out of focus.

I didn’t have time to think.

I ran straight for it.

My body slammed into the frame, and for a brief, impossible second, I thought I’d just crash through it. Fall forward into nothing. But instead—

The world snapped.

A cold rush of air sucked the breath from my lungs, like I was being pulled through a vacuum. My ears popped, and everything went silent. My vision fractured, like looking through broken glass—flashes of movement, color, but nothing that made sense.

Then—

I hit the floor.

Hard.

My limbs tangled beneath me, and I gasped as the air punched from my chest. The world spun. My head throbbed. The silence stretched out, thick and unnatural, pressing in from every direction.

I forced myself to sit up, blinking against the disorientation.

And then I saw it.

I was home.

Or—

It looked like home.

I was sitting on my bedroom floor, facing the bed. The sheets were rumpled, just like they had been when I left. My phone was still on the nightstand, its screen dark. The window in the wall showed the same quiet neighborhood street.

For a second, I almost believed it.

Then my eyes landed on the door.

It was wrong.

Slightly too tall. The edges too sharp.

And the shadows beneath it—

They moved.

A slow, pulsing shift, as if something on the other side was breathing.

I pushed myself to my feet. My hands were shaking. I didn’t know what I had expected, but I knew this wasn’t right.

I turned back to the window, hoping—praying—that I could step through it again.

But it was gone.

Just a blank wall.

Like it had never been there at all.

A soft creak behind me.

I spun around, heart slamming against my ribs.

The door had opened.

Not all the way. Just enough to show the darkened hallway beyond.

And in that hallway, something stood waiting.

Not moving. Not breathing.

Just watching.

I swallowed hard. My throat was dry, my pulse hammering in my ears.

I wasn’t in my house.

Not anymore.

And whatever was in here with me—

It knew.

I didn’t move.

Neither did it.

The figure in the hallway was just standing there, its shape obscured by shadows. Too tall. Too still.

Then—

It tilted its head.

A slow, deliberate motion. Not human. Not natural. Like it was trying to understand me.

Something deep inside me screamed to run. But I didn’t.

Because behind me, from the wall where the window should have been, a voice whispered—

“Don’t.”

I stiffened. My breath caught in my throat.

It was my voice.

I turned my head slightly, just enough to see the mirror hanging on the far wall.

Except—

It wasn’t just a reflection.

I was standing in it.

My reflection was looking at me—but its lips were moving on their own.

“Don’t run. It wants you to.”

The thing in the hallway took a step forward.

I flinched. My reflection didn’t.

“It plays by rules.” The whisper came again. “Play back.”

Rules.

I swallowed hard, my mind racing.

Everything here was wrong, but it had structure. The window had worked like a portal. The door had opened when I acknowledged it. And this… thing… was waiting for me to react.

Like a game.

I looked at my reflection, meeting my own eyes. “What do I do?” I mouthed.

The other me smiled.

Not a reassuring smile. Not comforting.

It was a grin full of knowing.

“Use the board.”

I frowned. The board?

I glanced back at the room. My room. Everything was identical to how I’d left it. My bed, my phone, my desk—

Then I saw it.

My chessboard.

It was set up on my desk, mid-game. The last match I’d played against myself. White’s move.

I didn’t have time to question it.

I walked toward it slowly, forcing my breathing to stay even. Behind me, I could hear the thing in the hallway shifting, its movements slow, patient.

Waiting.

I reached the desk and studied the board. My last move had left my queen exposed. If I was playing against myself, I’d take it with a knight.

I lifted the black knight and moved it.

As soon as I let go, the door slammed shut.

A gust of air rattled through the room, making the walls tremble.

I turned back toward the mirror. My reflection was nodding.

“Good.”

The ground beneath me shuddered. The walls stretched, as if the entire room was breathing. The air grew thick, heavy, pressing in on me.

Another piece had moved on the board. Not by me.

Black pawn, two spaces forward.

My turn again.

A sick realization settled in my stomach.

I wasn’t playing alone.

I turned toward the door.

The thing in the hallway—whatever it was—was still there. Except now… it was smiling too.

I exhaled slowly and faced the board again.

If this was a game—

I had to win.

I didn’t look up from the board. I didn’t dare.

Whatever was in the hallway wanted me to react, and I wasn’t going to give it the satisfaction.

I studied the pieces, my hands clammy as I reached for my next move.

Pawn to e4.

I let go.

The second I did, the entire room lurched sideways, like the floor itself had tipped.

I staggered, barely keeping my balance as my stomach twisted from the shift. My desk dragged itself a few inches closer to the mirror. The air pulsed like a heartbeat, thick and suffocating.

Behind me, I could hear the thing move. Its footsteps didn’t match the floor. Like it wasn’t walking on wood, but something else entirely. Something wet. Something alive.

I clenched my jaw and looked at the board.

The next move had already been made.

A knight, creeping closer to my king.

I swallowed.

It was testing me.

I slid my fingers over a bishop, considering my options. If I took the knight, I’d expose my queen. If I moved my queen, I’d leave my king vulnerable.

Every move had a consequence.

I glanced at the mirror. My reflection was still watching, but its expression had changed.

No more grin. No amusement.

It looked worried.

That made two of us.

I shifted my bishop forward, threatening the knight. As soon as I let go, the room shuddered again.

The door to the hallway slowly creaked back open.

And the thing in the shadows stepped inside.

I gripped the edge of my desk so hard my knuckles turned white.

It was closer now. I still couldn’t see its face—if it even had one—but its shape was wrong. Its limbs were too long, its spine curved unnaturally. And worst of all, I could hear it breathing.

Deep, wet gasps. Like it was trying to taste the air.

I forced my eyes back to the board.

The game wasn’t over. I could still win.

The pieces rattled. Another had moved—on its own.

The knight was now right next to my king.

I was running out of time.

My reflection in the mirror shook its head.

Wrong move.

A chill crawled up my spine.

I turned back to the board, my heartbeat pounding in my ears.

I had to think. Had to be smart.

If this was a game, there was always a way out.

I looked at my pieces. Then I looked at my opponent’s.

And finally, I realized—

I wasn’t playing to win.

I was playing to survive.

The rules had been clear from the start. Every move I made changed the room. Changed what was coming for me.

But if I didn’t move—if I refused to play—

What happened then?

The thing in the room took another step closer.

I clenched my fists.

Then, for the first time since the game started—

I did nothing.

And the room went silent.

The silence pressed in on me, thick and absolute.

I didn’t move.

The thing in the room didn’t either.

The only sound was my own heartbeat, hammering inside my chest like it was trying to escape.

I kept my hands in my lap, fingers curled so tight they ached. My eyes flicked to the board.

No new moves.

The pieces remained frozen where they were. The knight still loomed over my king. A checkmate waiting to happen.

But it hadn’t happened yet.

The thing in the room shifted. I could hear it, the slow creak of weight pressing into the floor. The wet, dragging breaths—just behind me now. Close enough that I could feel the air change. Feel the cold creeping over my skin.

I kept my eyes down.

If I reacted, I’d lose.

My reflection in the mirror still watched, but something had changed. It wasn’t mirroring me anymore. It was moving on its own.

It raised its hand and tapped a finger against its temple.

Think.

I swallowed.

Then, slowly, I leaned forward and stared at the board.

There had to be something I was missing.

The game was still going. The thing in the room was still waiting.

Waiting for me to make the next move.

I studied the pieces. My opponent’s side.

And then—I saw it.

The one piece I hadn’t been paying attention to.

The king.

Not my king.

Theirs.

I inhaled sharply.

This wasn’t about survival. It never had been.

It was about winning.

And there was only one way to do that.

I reached out, slow and steady.

The thing in the room lurched forward.

I ignored it.

My fingers closed around my queen. I moved her.

The second I let go—

Checkmate.

The room convulsed.

A sound ripped through the air—something high-pitched and wrong, like metal scraping against bone. The walls blurred, folding in on themselves like paper. My desk split in half, the mirror cracked—

And the thing in the room—

It screamed.

Not a sound of pain.

A sound of rage.

I squeezed my eyes shut, gripping the edge of the table as the world collapsed around me.

And then—

Silence.

A different kind this time. Not heavy, not pressing.

Just... empty.

I opened my eyes.

The board was gone.

The room was normal again.

And I was alone.

At least, that’s what I thought.

Until I saw the mirror.

The reflection inside it?

It was still playing the game.

And this time—

It wasn’t me sitting in the chair.",1,1739476475.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I just finished my first (and likely only) watch of Big Love. I didn't love it - I'd probably give it a 6/10 rating on IMDB. But the last season (which seems universally hated here 🤣) was really poignant for me. 

I served a mission for the LDS church from 2007-2009. I was married in the temple, wore garments, paid tithing, listened to the leaders in Salt Lake, and did what I was asked until I lost my faith in 2021. 

When I was serving my mission, there were a number of things in the news in the US that people wanted to talk to us about. Mitt Romney was running for president, the Church was getting involved in proposition 8 in California, and the church was making a push to seemingly ""normalize"" themselves with the ""I'm a Mormon"" campaign. And Big Love. 

The church warned against watching the show, especially when the episode with pieces of the temple ceremony aired. I remember thinking how evil the show must be and how hard Satan was fighting against the church. 

If I had watched the show as a missionary, there are things that I now know to be true about the church that I would have said were anti-Mormon lies, as the church would have called it.

Sadly, the two things I found most unbelievable about the show as it related to the church and Utah were that 1) it didn't snow and wasn't cold in the first 4 seasons and 2) there is very little chance that a bishop in the church would contact the authorities immediately regarding abuse. Their first call is to church lawyers who typically handle the matter internally as much as possible.

The last season and Barb's journey of self-realization resonated with me because I think many believers begin to find that their current belief structure and lifestyle don't align with what they find fulfilling or true. As they realize this, they look to find happiness in other places and the people in their life ostracize and criticize. This sometimes leads to dabbling with coffee, wine, sexual relationships, etc that they have never been taught how to handle maturely. Mostly, it leaves us being misunderstood and feeling alone. It's such a lonely feeling when you lose what you've always believed in and no one will take the time to ask and understand why.

Anyway, if you read this rant, thank you. If you're a former believing Mormon, I see you. I know how it feels. If you have friends or family who once believed, in anything really, ask them why they no longer do. Ask them what they need. And listen. 💙",4,1739476106.0,biglove,1,1.0,False

I left my local post acute about a week ago and something that the DON said to me stuck with me. Before I get to that I want to say I was a CNA for more than 5 years (Medsurge, SNF, assisted living, home health) so answering call lights and helping residents out is just in my blood, I can't help it. PLUS it's part of my job to just HELP in general. So one of my residents came up to the nursing station asking for more OJ to be poured in his mug. This gentleman is sweet, i miss him already. Anyway, as I happen to be doing my medpass I decided to stop what I'm doing and help him out cuz it won't take long anyway. The DON happen to come by and saw what I was doing. He asked me what I was doing and if I needed any help. I said I'm just giving a resident some more juice. He said ""well you're a nurse now, you have to prioritize things. You can always get CNAs for that"" 🙃 

See, I'm the type of nurse that will put a resident to bed because my CNAs are busy, I will make coffee, I will put away trays, I will PASS MEAL TRAYS, I will feed a resident, I will CHANGE a resident, etc etc etc. Whatever it is i can do to make this shift SMOOTH for everybody. And yes, I'm also doing nursing shit .

Help Me Make This Home!,"Hey neighbors! My boyfriend, our dog, and I are moving to LIC next month at a TFC building on the waterfront, and I’d love to hear your favorite things about living here. I want to settle in quickly and make this place feel like home—so I’m looking for recommendations from you!

* Where are the best ways to exercise here (especially socially)? I'm a fair-weather runner, love exercise classes and Pilates, and pickleball.
* What are your favorite walking routes or dog-friendly spots? I'm also excited by the proximity to Greenpoint, so if you have any recs within walking distance I'd love those too.
* Which local coffee shops or libraries are great for breaking up the WFH routine?
* What small businesses should I check out and support? Any meaningful volunteering opportunities?
* What are your fave food trucks/pop-up spots? I already have a long list of restaurants (tho feel free to share your faves!) but I'd love to get excited about trucks or other casual spots.
* Where can I find great art, live music, or creative events?
* And with spring and summer coming up—what are the must-do outdoor activities, festivals, or hidden gems? I don't have any friends in the neighborhood (yet) so would love to plan around some exciting activities to get my friends to Queens!
* Any pro-tips to living here like a pro? e.g., windy alleyways to walk around, subway tips (I'm coming from Downtown Brooklyn, so it's all new train lines for me), 5-star-rated restaurants that the locals know to avoid, or other tips for staying safe, healthy, and happy.

Would love any recs, and if there are local groups or meetups for newcomers (or newcomers + their dogs), I’m all ears. Thanks in advance—excited to join the community! 😊",1,1739475589.0,longislandcity,4,0.67,False

Long story short, I'm 26 and a veteran, so I can have my schooling paid for. The problem is, that I'm having a lot of trouble picking a career to pursue. I'm looking for something that doesn't feel like I'm learning a skill just to trade it for money, but also pays enough to live a modest, happy life.  

The only thing I can think of that resonates with me is physical therapy because I've always loved fitness, I like activity and working with others, and the idea of coaching someone towards pain relief sounds very fulfilling to me.

1iorjh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/WidespreadPanic/comments/1iorjh4/ac_for_first_timers/,AC For First Timers,"I saw a previous post mention that it was their first time going into AC and as someone born and raised in South Jersey, I am painfully aware that NJ gets a bad reputation. I have yet to meet a WSP fan from NJ, so I assume many out-of-towners are coming into town, especially as Jimmy is back.  I am not from the shore but have spent countless summers renting full-time to work. I also have many friends from the area who live there full-time. Hopefully, I can help you get a positive impression of my polarizing home state.

First thing to understand is the Eagles are fresh off a SuperBowl (Parade Friday Morning) and the quickest way to have an ugly conversation this week is to bring up something negative about said Eagles (we are all here for a good time; we know you hate the birds, just hold your breath and walk away).

The next thing to understand is while South Jersey does not come close to the cost of NYC/North Jersey, the Jersey Shore as a whole is a tourist destination for the very affluent of the Philly suburbs and onshore prices reflect that (as soon as you cross the bridge to an island). Any major purchases of alcohol, dispensaries, food, and groceries should be made offshore (avoid Pleasantville, the adjacent suburb. It is not a good area to hang around). Whilst some may be flying in and not have a car, your next best option is Ventnor (avoid Margate and Longport as it is ultra-wealthy and prices heavily reflect). Avoid casinos at all costs, if possible, for bars, restaurants, or pretty much anything besides gambling, as the costs in the casinos are ridiculous. Some will say AC as a whole is not expensive, but keep in mind that AC is not a nice place to linger in, except for specific areas.

The people there are mostly great, but there is a significant difference between South Jersey and shore people. Locals from the area love their towns and can be hostile against out of towners. Try to understand they love their home, and if you treat it with respect, the locals will reciprocate. Trash it, and they may not be friendly. Every summer they deal with drunk out of towners running wild (myself included) so be understanding. 

Recommendations

Breakfast: Please do not go to the buffets. Gilchrist is a great option, or any amount of small bagel shops will suffice if you want a bacon, egg & cheese.

White House Subs will be mentioned a lot, and rightfully so, it is an institution. It has an old-school vibe with a cheesesteak different from Philly's due to the difference in bread. I have not been there in years, so I cannot vouch for the current quality, but the old-school aesthetic will make it worthwhile, and the meatball sub I remember is fantastic.

Chef Vola and Cafe 2825 are the best restaurants in the city, but due to the old-school vibe, finding a reservation is borderline impossible but worth the effort to try. Angelos on Fairmount, Girasole, and Scannichios are other places where I have had great meals. The Old Homestead and Hells Kitchen is a great casino option but, as mentioned previously, a costly meal. 

Vagabond is a great bar with a good menu, but I have seen a drop in food quality. It is still worth checking out if it is nearby.

If you're traveling by car, you can get the ""real"" Jersey Shore experience. Take Route 40 or the Longport Bridge in to avoid AC Expressway tolls. Brigantine is the town north of AC and a very nice town to look at, although I am unfamiliar with it compared to others. Margate and Longport are worth driving through as some of the houses are ridiculous to see and of course.... Lucy. Mazza Market is a local gem in Northfield with sandwiches, pastries, and coffee. Venturas Offshore, Carluccios, and the Crab Trap are three of the best restaurants in all of South Jersey, with an emphasis on the Crab Trap. Two of the best bars are D'Orios and Charlies. Maynards and Roberts Place are two great options in Margate. All are great local spots with great food. There is an abundant Mexican population in the area as well so any Mexican restaurant is bound to be a homerun (Los Olas is the best).

I cannot emphasize enough that if this is your first time and you can travel, do not spend all your free time in AC. The Jersey Shore is a fantastic place, and if you drive along the coast from Ocean City to Stone Harbour, you will be rewarded with amazing views and local spots. AC is great for what it is, but it is not Vegas and not a representation of the State or Shore as a whole. I care deeply about the Spread community and want everyone to have a great time while visiting. Feel free to reach out with any questions and I would love to hear any other recommendations or disagreements from other locals. Have a great show and it is awesome to be back.

1iorggs,https://www.reddit.com/r/anxiety_support/comments/1iorggs/the_hidden_faces_of_social_anxiety_what_type_are/,The Hidden Faces of Social Anxiety – What Type Are You & How to Overcome It,"Do you ever feel like you're being watched, judged, or scrutinized in social situations? Like every word you say could be the wrong one, every move you make could be awkward, and every interaction could end in embarrassment? If so, you’re not alone. Social anxiety isn’t just a single fear—it has different forms, each affecting different personality types in unique ways.  

And the truth? Some people are naturally more prone to it than others.  

## **The 3 Faces of Social Anxiety – Which One Are You?**  

Not all social anxiety is the same. In fact, it tends to manifest in three different ways:  

### 1. **The ""Observer"" (Performance Anxiety & Fear of Judgment)**  
- You avoid being the center of attention.  
- You feel like people are silently critiquing you.  
- Public speaking, presentations, or even just raising your hand in class/work terrify you.  
- You rehearse what you’re going to say in your head but still struggle to get the words out.  

This type of social anxiety hits people who tend to be **perfectionists, deep thinkers, and highly self-aware individuals.** You want to be seen as intelligent, composed, and likable—but the fear of messing up keeps you silent.  

### 2. **The ""Avoider"" (Fear of Social Interactions & Small Talk)**  
- You dread social events, even casual ones.  
- You often cancel plans or avoid making them in the first place.  
- You struggle with casual conversations and fear awkward silences.  
- You replay interactions in your head, analyzing everything you said wrong.  

This form of social anxiety is common in **introverts, people with past social trauma, and those with low self-esteem.** You might long for deeper connections but feel exhausted by the idea of socializing.  

### 3. **The ""Escapist"" (Fear of Authority & High-Stakes Situations)**  
- You avoid confrontation at all costs.  
- You have trouble speaking up to teachers, bosses, or authority figures.  
- You feel intimidated in professional settings, interviews, or formal meetings.  
- You struggle with asserting boundaries and advocating for yourself.  

This type affects **people-pleasers, those raised in strict or high-pressure environments, and individuals with imposter syndrome.** You may be highly capable, but your self-doubt keeps you playing small.  

## **Who Is More Prone to Social Anxiety?**  

Social anxiety isn’t random. Certain personality types and experiences make it more likely, including:  

✔️ **Highly empathetic people** – You’re overly aware of others’ feelings and assume they’re judging you.  
✔️ **Overthinkers & perfectionists** – You set impossibly high social standards for yourself.  
✔️ **People with past rejection or bullying experiences** – One bad memory can shape your entire social confidence.  
✔️ **Sensitive introverts** – Social energy drains you, and the fear of rejection makes it even worse.  

But here’s the thing: **social anxiety isn’t permanent.** You can break free from it.  

## **How to Overcome Social Anxiety & Take Your Power Back**  

1. **Challenge Your Thoughts**  
Your brain tells you that everyone is judging you. But ask yourself—**do you judge others that harshly?** Most people are too busy worrying about themselves to overanalyze you.  

2. **Expose Yourself to Discomfort Gradually**  
Avoiding social situations only strengthens anxiety. **Start small.** Order your coffee with confidence. Ask a store worker a question. Compliment someone. These small wins build resilience.  

3. **Shift Your Focus from ""Me"" to ""Them""**  
When talking to someone, instead of thinking, *How do I sound?* shift to *How can I make them comfortable?* Making others feel at ease naturally makes you feel less anxious.  

4. **Use Practical Tools & Techniques**  
From cognitive behavioral exercises to mindfulness strategies, there are proven ways to take control of your social anxiety. **[This guide](https://www.anxietysupports.com/p/social-anxiety-tools-and-techniques-for-control/67805aa1bec79232b47e03e8)** breaks down actionable techniques that help you break free from fear.  

5. **Practice Self-Compassion**  
You are not broken. You are not weird. You are human. Social anxiety is just your brain trying to protect you—it just needs rewiring.  

## **Final Thought: You Are Not Alone**  

If social anxiety has been holding you back, know this—you are not a lost cause. You are not doomed to live in fear of conversations, interactions, or being seen. **You can take control, step by step.**

Being a plant parent comes with its set of joys and challenges. To keep your greenery thriving, utilize these **DIY plant care hacks** that every plant parent should know. These simple, creative tips will make your plant care routine more efficient and effective.

One essential hack is using *ice cubes for watering*. Instead of overwatering your plants, simply drop a few ice cubes on the soil. As they melt, the water will gradually seep into the ground, preventing root rot and ensuring a slow, steady hydration. This method is particularly useful for plants that prefer moisture but can be sensitive to sudden watering.

For pest control, consider a *DIY soap spray*. Mix one tablespoon of mild dish soap with water in a spray bottle. This solution can effectively eliminate aphids and spider mites without harmful chemicals. Just spray it on the affected areas, and watch your problems fade away.

- **Coffee grounds**: Enrich your soil by using leftover coffee grounds. They provide essential nitrogen and improve drainage.
- **Eggshells**: Crush used eggshells and mix them into your potting soil for a calcium boost.
- **Toothbrush and water**: For dusty leaves, use a soft toothbrush dipped in water to gently clean them, enhancing photosynthesis.

Repurposing *yogurt containers* can also be a game-changing hack. These containers make excellent pots for starting seedlings, as they already have drainage holes. Just remember to cover the top with cling film to retain moisture until germination.

Lastly, using a **dry-erase marker** can help you remember when to water your plants. Just write the last watered date on the pot, and you'll never lose track again. Implementing these DIY plant care hacks can save you time, effort, and help you cultivate a thriving indoor jungle. Happy planting!

I (21F) live with Jess (20F) and Lila (20F). We are now juniors in college and have lived together since freshman year. At the beginning of this school year (fall of 2024) we moved into an apartment off campus. Last semester everything was great, we had very few arguments or issues, the biggest being over how to properly load the dishwasher.
Jess has a boyfriend Austin (20M) and they have been together for close to 2 years at this point. Austin , Lila, and I are all in very similar majors and therefore share a lot of classes. I genuinely like Austin, he's a good guy and I'm friendly with him outside of our mutual knowing of Jess. The problem comes with the start of this semester.
Last semester it seemed Jess and Austin had a set schedule for when they were at his place vs our place (he rents a house with 2 other roommates). This semester neither Lila or myself can figure out this schedule. Thus, Austin is often at our apartment without real forewarning. I wouldn't have a problem with that if it weren't for a few things.

1) Jess doesn't cook often. She just doesn't really like it. Lila and I cook a lot and I use baking as a stress outlet. Austin does cook, and a lot of times he will use our kitchen, which I don't have a problem with. However, there have been multiple instances where I have a plan for dinner, and by the time I'm ready to start cooking he has already taken over the kitchen. He uses some of our ingredients, never an exorbitant amount, and our cookware obviously. I've said in the past he can do this, but it's getting to be 3+ times a week that my kitchen is stolen for an hour or more because Austin is making dinner for him and Jess. That's the other thing, he almost always obky makes dinner for himself and Jess, which is perfectly understandable, but when that's the case I have to wait an additional hour before I can start cooking my dinner in my kitchen. He and Jess also sometimes forget about leftovers so there will be rotting food in our fridge that Lila and I have to deal with. We've spoken to them about the leftovers and have been told they will be better about it and that conversation was like 2 days ago so it's to early to tell.

2) Our apartment doesn't have physical keys, it has a code lock. The lock can be opened with any of our phones as well. Austin has Jess's code memorized meaning he can get into the apartment without her. I don't mind this, because she asked us if he could have it when we moved in and Lila and I both said sure. The issue is he will come to our apartment 1-2 hours before Jess gets home sometimes. Sometimes Lila or myself are home, sometimes not. So there are times where he is just in our apartment alone, which I find a little weird. I would understand it if he was making dinner so he showed up early to start cooking before Jess got home, but he only ever cooks after she gets home. 

3) Our TV. So this one is kinda me being picky, but our TV is mine. It was my Christmas gift from my parents  our freshman year of college. Most of the streaming services are signed in on my family's accounts. This past year for Christmas I got a switch so we (the roomies) could all play games and stuff. Jess and Austin use the TV the most out of any of us. They have a roster of around 4 shows they are watching together that they rotate through most nights. Literally the day I set the switch it Austin made profiles for himself and Jess on it. I don't mind sharing the TV, it's in the living room and I view it as a Communal thing, but I'd like for it to actually be shared. They never really ice Lila and I out if we happen to join them in watching one of their shows, but it feels a lot like third-wheeling so neither of us stays out in the living room when Jess and Austin are using the TV. 

There's a few other little things, Austin will sometimes leave some of his stuff here, never enough to really be an issue just noticeable as not ours. Jess is a big coffee person and Austin always takes it upon himself to make her coffee everyday, which in his mind must include grinding the beans every morning and currently the days Jess has 8am classes are the days I do not and would appreciate a bit more sleep. 

The culminating annoyance that finally got me to tell Lila what I had been feeling (and hear her perspective, she shares a wall with Jess's room and I do not so I wanted to hear her side) was this past weekend. Austin and Jess are going to her parents this weekend including Valentine's day. Therefore they wanted to do something for Valentine's day early. They elected to have a nice dinner at home Sunday night. Jess approached Lila and I and asked if we could be out of the apartment from 6pm-8pm Sunday. We said sure and went out to eat with some friends. Then a few days ago, Austin says ""thanks for leaving Sunday, I told Jess you would be fine with that idea"". It seemed like a weird phrasing and I pushed a but more, it turned out the entire night, including asking Lila and I to leave was all Austin's idea. I had no problem giving them privacy for 2 hours, but it rubs me the wrong way that Austin was the one to come up with the idea to ask Lila and I to leave our apartment.

I am currently sick and being sick is literally one of my least favorite things in the world so I'm in a bad mood and want to make sure I'm not overreacting. I also want to approach this in a non bitchy way because I really do like both Jess and Austin. So how do I politely tell Jess that her boyfriend is too comfortable in our apartment?

Tldr: My roommate's boyfriend is at our apartment a bit too much for my taste and I want to know how to broach the topic peacefully.",3,1739474906.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

**Context (might be important somehow)**

The city is London, UK. I am a 39M (Italian), who met on a dating site this 34F girl (Russian). We both work in the same industry with good positions. She has been together with her ex husband for 6 years, of which 3 as married. They moved together to the UK approximately 1.5 years ago and then almost immediately got divorced/ separated (I am not sure which one exactly). She grew up partially in the middle East due to the job of her father and seems quite family oriented.

The temporal space between date 1 and date 4 was of two weeks.

**Date 1**

We met for a coffee at a bar and we immediately clicked on as we have very similar interest - art, poetry, books, history, languages. We talk for almost 3.5h and I can feel the connection. She touches me often during the date. When we leave, I ask her number (we didn't exchange it before). I notice that she has multiple dating apps installed on her phone (at least 3).

When she gets home, she writes to me and we start chatting - she says that she felt a great connection and actually wanted to kiss me, which is unusual for her at a first date. She even makes a cheeky joke about my bedroom. She keeps me writing and also compliments me about my interests, how interesting and educated I seem etc. We continue texting about lots of stuff over the next days and a couple of days later, I ask her for another date and she immediately accepts.

**Date 2**

We go to a pizza place I know and we have a good meal, touching hands, looking at each other eye and talking. I pay for the dinner and after the pizza, she insists to have a walk together despite the cold and we take a walk to towards the train station. She asks me a lot of questions about relationships, if I am using other apps, if I am dating other people etc. I try to avoid this conversation as I think is too soon and I would really like to focus on ourselves and enjoying our time together.  We spent almost 4h together on the date and then, while we are on the platform of the station, I kiss her and hug her multiple times. She decides to miss the train and take the next train in 15 minutes to spend more time with me.

When she gets back home she keeps texting me and says that she could have spent hours kissing together with me.

**Date 3**

The day after the last date, I invite her to meet on Sunday evening (I was busy on Saturday due to a gig). We were originally supposed to go to a light festival but due to circumstances I decide to bring her to a very nice bar I know (we continue kissing and touching each other frequently) and then for a meal at a Chinese restaurant (it was Chinese New Year). She tells me more about her family, the death of her mom, about her friends and some problems they are having etc. We also hold hands while we have a meal. I bring her some chocolates as a gift and she brings me a book of poems from her favourite author. We take a long walk and she teases me that I am finally starting to open to her, get more touchy etc. We spent 3.5h together. We keep texting for a bit even after each other had reached home.

The day after we keep texting and I mention about dinner at my place with me cooking and she says she is looking forward for the invitation - I invite her for the Friday. She even calls me that evening while she is out and in a bit of a dodgy area. We continue chatting all the week and she teases me again asking if she is in my top priorities and wondering (in a playful way)  if I am more interested in her or in my hobby. It almost seems that she is more into me than I am into her but she also says that she likes that at the last date I became more touchy, and opened up more.

**Date 4**

Friday (day of the dinner at my place). I have a very small surgery planned and she had been busy at work (she mentioned that she had work dinners for the last 2 days). We talk during the day, she tells me that she is very tired and she will have very low energy this evening and asks me if I am ok with it. I tell her that we can just chill without stress but also that if she is too tired we can reschedule. She says that she still would like to come. I go back home with a small plaster between my eye and nose because of this small surgery,

She comes at my place with a small gift for my home, and I also gift her some flowers and I give her a card with a poem I had written for her in Italian. I read and translate the poem for her and she seems to love both the poem and the flowers. I show her my place and the art in my place then I start cooking and I talk with her while cooking. While eating, we talk (she always asked me a lot of questions about how a woman should be, a man should be, what a relationship should be like etc) and we also compliment each other about eyes, smile. After dinner we have tea with chocolate, then we go to the sofa. While on the sofa, she tells me she is cold and she feels a bit tired so maybe will not stay for much longer - we listen to some music while talking and kissing/touching each other, then I show her some family videos with me and my town, she seems to be interested/ make comments (one comment was also about how handsome I was in an old picture) but eventually says she really feels tired and would like to go home. I mention multiple times that she could sleep at my place but she insists she would like to be in her bed, have a very long sleep and a bit of lazy day tomorrow. I try to touch (near her leg/breast) and kiss her a bit more sexually to see if I spark any reaction , she accepts my touches and also touches me on my hair/kisses etc.  but she does not seem too much interested in escalating to sex (or this was the impression I had) and I also decide to not further insist given she had said multiple times she was feeling tired and cold and wanted to go home. She asks me about my plan for the weekend and then she asks me to go downstairs with her to wait for the taxi. At that point we had spent 4.5h together in the evening.

When she reaches home, she writes me a message to thank me for the beautiful evening, I wish her good night and sweet dreams, she reacts with a heart. I thank her for coming to my place and give up  the opportunity to rest, she replies asking me what I mean with a smiley of a kiss. I don't reply to this message because I had fallen asleep.

**Post Date 4**

In the morning of Saturday I reply to her message from the night before and ask her a question related to one of her future work trips. Then I go on with my day. I assume she is sleeping till late so I don't worry about any late reply. In the afternoon, I notice that she had read my message but not yet replied, I see she keeps connecting to WhatsApp (from the ""Last access"" time) but I think she might be busy or something like that. I go to a birthday party and then she replies to my message around 10.30 PM (so almost 12h later) - she apologizes for the delay, mentioning she was tired, feeling overworked etc. but her reply sound a bit cold. I see her reply only a couple of hours later and I say no problem, then I wish her goodnight and ask her if she would like to meet on Sunday evening (I had an event but I was free afterwards) but she ignores this message just wishing me goodnight as well.

The day after (Sunday) she is completely silent - I decide to not text her at all and wait if she would do it (in the past, while I was busy with work, she had reached me joking if I was alive/ why I was not writing her) - she doesn't, so I decide to send a brief text to ask her how she was and if she had recovered.

She does not reply to this text for almost 3 days (in the meantime, I could see she was on/was accessing Whatsapp) and then replies on Tuesday evening with three short messages apologizing for the delay, saying she had been unwell/overwhelmed by work and asking how I am and how was my event on Sunday.

I don't believe her at all - I reply to her messages one day later in a bit of cheerful/funny way to show that her behaviour had not impacted me but she has not texted back since (now it has been a bit more of a day)...

**Questions in my head**

What do you guys think it happened? How I should continue?

I am so confused as it seemed she was really into me till and including Date 4. The only thing that smells weird to me during Date 4 was her not wanting to stay at my place and (perceived by me) low willingness to escalate to sex but both should be because she was tired (she highlighted that even before coming to my place) and perhaps the evening was a little too long (but more or less in line with our previous dates in terms of duration). She seemed also very interested to come given that when I offered her to reschedule due to her being very tired she said she still wanted to come.

I see 3 main possibilities:

1. She expected sex on Date 4 and when it didn't happen she lost interest
2. She was dating someone else in parallel (very possible given she was on multiple dating apps) and decided that liked someone more than me (or maybe someone who she liked and dumped her returned)
3. Something turned off her interest/attraction during Date 4 (could it be because due to the flowers/poem she perceived I was more into her than how she was into me, especially as in the first dates/ interactions she was often joking about it being the opposite?)

As a teen who has had historically an unhealthy relationship with food I wanted to go on a healthy diet to help lose some of the weight I put on during my injury+the off season. I was 200 pounds at 5'11 heres what I did and have lost 15 pounds in about 7 weeks while still have high energy on the court and keeping my ideal body shape goals.( I will also try and factor in cost for all of this because I know thats a huge hinderance into losing weight)

Exercise

I go to the gym every saturday for about 2 hours, I work nights so I usually go in at about  2pm and leave at about 3:45-4, Normally gym memberships cost about 58 dollars a month but my since my father is in the military I get to work out at a military gym for free! 

I do about an 30 minutes of basketball, mostly just shooting so nothing too strenuous. 

Then I do 45 minutes on the stairmaster at level 4-9 (i know high variety but I usually start high then work my way down to the middle then go back to a hard level) 

Then 15-30 minutes of rowing! I love rowing so much and its a great workout

Now every week day I have basketball practice or a game for about an hour, its usually very easy and im down low so I usually just have to just put my hands up and shoot 

And finally everyday I watch and follow these exact youtube videos

which are like pilates-esque idk 

  
Now the diet (the hardest part) 

I love food so much so this was really really hard 

Breakfast 

\- Tater-tots and Veggie Sausage 

Its what my dad makes and I have 0 time in the morning 

I also make a smoothie using a costco pack with trader joes coffee creamer and milk yes i know it has a bunch of calories and sugars but its tricking me into eating kale so idrc

its 12 bucks for 42 ounces

  
Lunch 

Glucerna! Vanilla Flavored + Trail Mix+ Random Fruit in my house 

or Salad 

or Rice

at 42 dollars for 24 bottles, its a little expensive but honestly totally worth it. It has protein and a shitton of vitamins like really a bunch. I use the subscribe and save feature on amazon so its a little better but not much. 

Somedays ill also have a trader joes ceaser salad or rice 

The rice is when im really desperate but ill just have plain japanese cooked rice from costco, it doesnt really give me energy but sometimes i dont have food at home so ill just eat those plus like a protein bar 

Then some trail mix or some days when I dont have any ill go to the vending machine at my school and buy kettle cooked chips (those are healthier right?) 

  
Dinner 

I eat a variety of different things for dinner so ill just tell you what I dont eat to save time 

\- Red Meat, I already didnt eat pork for religious reasons and beef tastes so good but makes my stomach bloated  afterwards and I feel super heavy

\-  unnecessary cheese, so like ill eat a pizza (usually my homemade ones bc i work at a pizza place and um we use hella grease and other things) but what I used to do is when I ate spaghetti id like load it up with cheese so I dont do that anymore

\- White potatoes, I love these japanese sweet ones so Ill just eat those instead of regular baked ones, but ngl giving up french fries was a definitely hard.

\- Dessert, I miss it every day 

Thats it they were such a big part of my diet before so it definitely feels like a lot more

  
I also just eliminated snacking (sometimes)

  
Yep so thats my diet! 

I dont really drink soda but if youre craving something sparkly and sweetish try the lychee CHI sparkling water.

1ior7r6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ior7r6,Skyclad Emporium March 5th-17th,"Portland, Meet Skyclad Emporium – A Pop-Up Worth Showing Up For

Portland has always been the kind of place where you can find something weird and wonderful tucked into an alley, sitting on a street corner, or hidden behind an unassuming storefront. Skyclad Emporium is exactly that kind of place. Alchemy, candle-making, perfumery, divination, books, vintage treasures, and the kind of rebellious oddities that latchkey kids grew up curating before they even knew what curation was.

We’re setting up shop March 5 - 17 at 718 SW Alder, Downtown Portland (by Pioneer Square). Maybe it’s a pop-up, maybe it’s the beginning of something more permanent. That part’s up to you.

So what the hell is Skyclad Emporium?

It’s the scent of the record store you loitered in when you were fifteen bottled into perfume. It’s hand-poured intention candles that feel like they were dug up from some long-forgotten Victorian witches den. It’s a place where riot grrrl zines, oddities, and books you won’t find at the airport bookstore sit side by side with other vintage finds, houseplants, and artisan body scrubs that feel more like a ritual than self-care.

Inside you’ll find a lot of handmade stuff from us, vintage clothes, Locally launched and made Eau De Parfum, and even nostalgic pop-culture inspired stuff (think less MJ, and more John Waters/Klaus Nomi - though we super love Drop Dead Fred)
Everything inside has a story—because why the hell would we bother making something if it didn’t?

What you’ll find inside this temporary (maybe not), weird, wonderful little shop:
🕯️ Hand-poured candles – Some inspired by mythology, some inspired by the fever dreams of latchkey survivors.
🖤 ‘Something Wicked This Way Comes’ Eau de Parfum collection + off-menu scents
📖 Vintage zines, hand picked books, and forgotten relics of the past.
🛁 Exfoliating potions, body scrubs, and small-batch apothecary goods.
🎭 Art, decor, incantations, house plants, and anything else we manage to create or unearth.

This is a pop-up, but it doesn’t have to stay that way. If you want Skyclad Emporium to carve out a permanent home in Portland, show up, spread the word, and let’s see what happens. This won’t feel like a normal witchy shop (we love those though!), it’ll feel more like a witch shop mixed with Empire Records, that old mercantile where the elders drink their coffee and argue about l absolutely nothing, mixed with a distro spot from the late 90’s selling Riot Grrl, hardcore, and local punk merchandise! It’s literally tiny pieces of every part of our personality. 

📍 March 5 - 17
📍 718 SW Alder, Downtown Portland (next to Pioneer Square)
📍 Hours TBD—stay tuned

See you there.

Feeling Used and Confused,"I met this girl through a friend on a Friday at a meetup with friends. We hit it off really well—both of us were drunk and high, but we connected and ended up making out at my friend’s place. We decided to go to her place, and while nothing sexual happened since she was on her period, we spent the whole night making out until we fell asleep.
The next morning, we exchanged contacts and made plans to meet on Sunday for a proper date at her place. When Sunday arrived, I brought her flowers, and everything seemed great. We ended up having sex (At least we tried, neither of us were able finish ). Later that day, our friends invited us to hang out, and although we were hesitant, we decided to go, traveling about 50 minutes to get there.
On the way, she opened up to me about her six-year toxic relationship, going into great detail about how it unfolded year by year. She didn’t finish the story during the ride, but later that night, we drank, smoked, and stayed up all night at our friend’s place. Early in the morning, we left for her place to get some sleep before our classes. After resting for a while, I headed out, and we agreed to meet again whenever we were free. She told me she wasn’t ready for a relationship, which I was okay with since I felt the same way. We decided to just see where things naturally went.
She had a party planned with her work friends on Monday night. Tuesday went by normally. On Wednesday, I happened to be near her college for work, so I asked if she wanted to meet after her class. She agreed, and we grabbed some coffee, having a great time talking. I asked how her party was, and she simply said it was good before changing the subject. She then continued telling me more about her past relationship and how traumatic it was.
After spending a couple of hours at the café, we decided to go to her place to chill and watch some movies. We had a relaxed night, and in the morning, after having tea together, I left. We planned to meet again on Friday after class.
When Friday came, we met at her place again. We smoked a little, had dinner, and since she was exhausted, we just went to sleep. The next morning, she had to work over the weekend, so I left, and we continued chatting over text.
Then, on Sunday night, after she got home from work, she told me that during the party on Monday, she had made out with another guy. We talked about it, and I told her I couldn’t be in something that wasn’t exclusive. She, on the other hand, said she wanted the freedom to meet new people and explore new things. So, we decided to end things.
I know this was still in the early stages of us getting to know each other, but what hurts the most is that I felt like I wasn’t good enough—that even after everything, she still went to someone else. And she didn’t even tell me until nearly a week later. It makes me feel like I was just being used. I know it’s nobody’s fault, but I can’t help but wonder what I did wrong to deserve this.",2,1739474752.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Quick Day 17 check in because I was pleasantly surprised when I stepped on the scale this morning. 

I am officially down 4 pounds in 17 days. I stopped taking the bupropion after a week because it should not be mixed with Adderall, which I very quickly realized I cannot go without if I want to successfully perform my job. So while I am prescribed kit 6, I’m essentially following the plan for kit 5 since I omit the bupropion. 

The first couple days I felt pretty lousy but now I feel fantastic! No side effects really other than a minor headache once every few days usually later at night. But it goes away with water. I have been striving to fast for 12-16 hours and walk 6000+ steps every day. There are some days I don’t hit that goal, though. I go to Orange Theory 1-2x a week, but 2 of the 3 weeks it has only been once so far. 

I absolutely drink the recommended water every day, usually double it. No alcohol and mostly clean eating so far. I drink coffee when I feel like I need it. Decent sleep, 7 hours minimum, 8.5 hours maximum. I shoot for 100g of protein daily, including one 40g high quality protein shake a day and the rest from “real” food, but have def fallen short a few times. Still always hitting at least 75g on my worst days though. I’ve successfully stayed in a calorie deficit except for the day of the Super Bowl, which I really just broke even calorie wise that day. 

Ready to start incorporating more weight training 3x a week and daily 10-15 min ab workouts to make sure I am bikini ready by the end of this program 🥳",5,1739474567.0,HersWeightloss,0,0.86,False
1ior4fc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ior4fc,Started the pen !!,"So here’s the first post, Monday started on the first dose, live in Malta so managed to get 2 pens when I was in the UK last week.

Would love to put my numbers on my name but have no idea how to do it.

Age is 54 (55 this year)
Weight: 125.5 kg according to my scales (trust me when I say this, they really do have a mind of their own can move 2 kilos by getting on and off and on again!!)
Goal weight: 80kg (I know this is a crazy number)
it equates to 100lb which when I write it down seems totally unachievable.

So after 3 full days, I am managing to keep the gym working ok, do around 40mins of cardio (walking at the moment) split into 3 splits 20mn/10mn/10mn with maybe a couple of minutes jog in each session. Then weight work light but 15x3 reps between the cardio.

Meals are:

1 protein shake with banana and peanut butter after workout
1 protein shake with fruit (blueberries or avocado) and peanut butter around lunchtime
Meal in the evening (had spaghetti Bol, chilli con carne and rice and chicken and veg being 2 potatoes and broccoli over the last 3 nights.

Snacks 1 grenade bar and almonds (50g) per day so far apart from today where I missed protein shake as I wasn’t hungry  

Trying to up water - only getting about 2 litres a day at the moment.

Coffee with 1 sugar and 2 coffee mate spoons x about 3 per day 

Using Nutracheck calorie counter app to help make myself accountable

So hoping that all this manages to work, used Ozempic previously which worked a little and then just stopped me from gaining but nothing lost (never did gym and ate whatever I wanted food wise) feeling a lot more focused and having joined this group I can see the support you give each other.

Sorry about long message but any help is appreciated when it comes to apps to use and good food strategies including how you work out you fat/prot/carb split into the apps to monitor as well.

1ior16l,https://i.redd.it/2kevxe55iyie1.jpeg,Yet another Sorce review post 💗💗💗 pt.1,"Hi y'all! This is my first time really sharing any reviews outside of occasional SOTD comments and I will admit I'm not the best with describing things like many of you are, but it's still fun to try haha.

I recently visited Sorce's new retail shop in Charlotte NC and had such a lovely experience; I'm still basking in the positive glow of the wonderful time I had and absolutely can't wait to go back! I feel very fortunate this house is located near enough to me I could make a little day trip out to see it and would highly recommend visiting if you're able!

I left with a generous amount of samples and decided this would be the perfect time to do my first review post. Prior to my visit I had only ever tried one Sorce perfume so it's all new to me and I gotta say...I fully understand the hype now!

*I'll have 13 to review in total so this will be split into two parts to keep it from getting too long.*


- - - 

 **Sit for a Spell** - *Salted cantaloupe, a light drizzle of wild rosemary honey, fresh spring air, ambrette seed, and winding honeysuckle vines*
 
*Rating:** (5/5)

Immediate love! Delicately sweet and contrastingly salty cantaloupe, juicy and ripe like you managed to pick the best one in the bin at the market, accented with herbal honey and a gentle airy freshness, like a springtime breeze wafting the aroma of blooming honeysuckles. This is a bit of everything, sweet, herbal, fresh, and floral, all at once. Everything about this is beautiful and when I first sniffed it it nearly brought me to tears. This first scent I tried coupled with the kindness I experienced from the people working in the shop completely sold me on this house! Truly they deserve all the success and praise. So far this is my top favorite and I would love to have a full bottle!

**Serpentine** - *Ripe figs, fig leaf, cardamom, caramelized honey, vanilla, Peru balsam, Cedar, Iso E Super*

**Rating:** (4/5)

Honey bomb!!! This is incredibly sweet, the caramelized honey is definitely the star of the show, followed up with juicy figs, vanilla, and cardamom. I don't get as much of the balsam or cedar as I would like, but I couldn't stop sniffing my wrists after applying and was reminded how much I enjoy honey notes in perfume when they're done as well as it is here. I'm surprised this isn't listed with the gourmands on their site as it comes across very edible and not so much ""aromatic woods"" to me. This does start to lean into toothachingly sweet territory and would likely not be something I could wear often, but boy do I love smelling it! Absolutely will keep the sample and bring it out from time to time. 

**The Ghost Wants Birthday Cake** - *warm peach cake spiced with ginger, cinnamon, and cardamom; vanilla bean ice cream*, Indian sandalwood Mysore, Australian sandalwood*

**Rating:** (5/5)

As someone who has tended to shy away from gourmands, especially when meant to smell like literal dessert, this perfume was eye-opening. Do I...like gourmands? Amazing! This is delectable and magical, somehow giving me feelings of nostalgia I can't quite place. This is like warm peach cobbler (or cake as the notes say, but I'm going with cobbler) pulled fresh from the oven, left to cool on the counter for just a little while, then topped with cold vanilla ice cream that immediately starts to melt from the warmth, all grounded with the comforting notes of sandalwood. Does it smell like a delicious dessert I want to eat? Yes it does. But somehow it doesn't make me feel like I smell like food, it feels more like the smell of a happy and youthful memory that I'd like to live inside forever. I would get a bottle of this one too!

**2am in Lafayette** - *Vanilla co2, oakmoss, cafe au lait, ribbons of caramel, beignets dusted with powdered sugar*

**Rating:** (3/5)

First I'm hit with a beautiful milky coffee scent that makes me crave coffee something fierce! I recently cut way back on my coffee consumption and have been limiting myself to only tea so the urge to go brew a pot despite it being 5:30pm when I applied this was unfortunately Strong!! Next I'm picking up on the smell of fried dough, both oily and powdery sweet. As it dries I smell more of the vanilla, cool and silky, and the earthy scent of oakmoss. Altogether a lovely scent that smells exactly like it says it will and really gives the feel of a late night/very early morning, but as much as I love the smell of coffee and drinking it, I don't want to smell like it. I think part of my issue with gourmands has been they tend to induce a craving for whatever it is I'm smelling on myself (or just sweets in general) which I find to be an annoying sort of feeling. This is no exception, but I will say it is by far the best coffee scent I've smelled yet! It's a wonderfully composed scent, just overall not for me.

**Dreaming Evil** - *Vanilla, tonka bean, labdanum, benzoin, cocoa, oud, treemoss, dark woods*

**Rating:** (4/5)

Ooh this is silky and darkly sweet, like a bar of expensive dark chocolate. I get a lot of the oud, woods, and the earthy moss which is great because woody and earthy scents are my favorite and they really temper the sweeter notes. It's such a smooth, resinous and mysterious sort of scent. I haven't really liked cocoa/chocolate notes in perfumes before, but this is another Sorce scent that seems to be changing and opening my mind to notes I thought I would never like. I'm not quite sure yet if I'd full size this despite enjoying it, though. This would not be an all occasion, apply whenever perfume for me so a bottle would likely be too much, but I still find it compelling so I'm definitely going to hang onto the sample!

**Your Girlfriend is a Badass** - *Yellow cake with a rich fudge frosting, Himalayan cedarwood, oakmoss, and forest floor*

**Rating:** (4/5)

Moist yellow cake with deep chocolate frosting on top, and a warm, musky earthiness underneath. The forest you found this cake in is damp and humid like after a summer rain. This is kind of in the same category as Dreaming Evil with it being an earthy chocolate scent and I think I feel similarly that while I enjoy it and want to keep the sample, it wouldn't be one I'd want in a larger size. Still impressed that Sorce has shown me there are gourmands I like!

**The Lovers** - *Bergamot, iris, jasmine sambar, bamboo, vetiver, green banana, mysore sandalwood, animalic amber*

**Rating:** (2/5)

Initially this is a blast of jasmine and iris, followed by bamboo and a barely sweet unriped banana, altogether floral and green like a spring day. It's light and pleasant, wears close to the skin and something that could be great as a work scent. I'm not the biggest fan of jasmine though and unfortunately that's the note I pick up on the most. In the dry down the sandalwood becomes a little more apparent, but the scent goes toward powdery and non-descript on my skin. I don't dislike it, but it's also not doing too much for me personally. I'd say this is my least favorite of the samples so far, but again I don't dislike it and could see some occasions where I might like to wear this.

- - -

So this is 7 out of the 13 total samples I have to try and so far there are two I would like to full size (Sit for a Spell + The Ghost Wants Birthday Cake) with zero I completely dislike, which is a pretty great hit rate for me I think. I'll be keeping all of my samples around in my collection regardless of how I rated to cherish for the happy memory I now associate with them. My first impression of this house is a very positive one that has me so excited to try more! Thank you for reading 💓 ",15,1739474292.0,Indiemakeupandmore,9,0.94,False

Let me first tell you about me (19F) and my crush (19M) from my class. We met in biology lab last year and we wrote lab reports together all the time because we sat together. We had a nice chem. (the seats in the lab are decided by the class's list and I am 3rd and he is 4th in the list) we have known each other for 1.5 years now. I think he was kinda making silent moves last year but I didn't realize it back then. (he has sent me hearty lovey dovey stickers while messaging etc. etc.) And this year I started liking him because it felt right and fun. Then my liking started getting serious and I got so excited everytime I see him but I seriously have no idea if he likes me or not now. (I at least know he doesn't have a lover thanks to mutual friends) I normally would rather taking things slow and start flirting but. Guys. I get so much anxiety whenever I seriously like someone and I haven't been able to sleep properly for a week now. I have my exams coming and I can't afford to ruin academics by ignoring my feelings. So I decided to make a move. Here is my plan: I will text him saturday night asking ""wanna hang out whenever you are free? (or would you ever be free)"" He will understand it is a date because we don't text often and we haven't met outside of school before. If he accepts I plan to tell him about my feelings while drinking coffee. Also I will probably stress my assss offf so I thought would it be cute if I brought sticker sheets with me so we can cut them together while talking so it's like crafty kinda date. I am also stressed about dating with him what if it gets awkward and he don't enjoy ittt AAAHHH so scary. I am sorry if I overshared. I just don't know if this is a good idea or not. (extra: Lab groups changed this year so we normally don't have labs together anymore. But tomorrow we will be in the same lab after a long time because of the schedule change. is this luck? tomorrow is valentines day.

1ioqztk,https://i.redd.it/7xy6u38vhyie1.jpeg,I eradicated H Pylori without antibiotics,"After being infected for 7 years, but just finding  out in October, I followed this protocol from mid November to Jan 1. Before that I took some herbs like garlic, mint, and turmeric but not in an organized manner. I only took a PPI for a few days before having unpleasant side effects. I never took any antibiotics, though I had them on hand in case the herbs didn't work. I tested positive in October with a CLO and endoscopy, maybe the most specific kind of test. Then after my protocol, I tested negative 3 times with home stool tests. But I wanted more certainty, so I did this urea breath test at Quest Diagnostics. 

Whether to take antibiotics or not is a personal choice. But if a doctor tells you ( like mine did) that the only way to eradicate H Pylori is with pharmaceuticals,  they're wrong.

However, I bought half a dozen for $11. It's expensive but I figured that perhaps that's due to the donuts being fresh. 

Well, they aren't?

Maybe my expectations were too high but the toasted coconut, at least, tasted stale. It  was no better than Tim Hortons.

[Beginner],"Hi everyone, I recently went from ordering coffee from the common chains and being constantly disappointed to having a LaPicolla ESE machine at home. It was life-changing, even though I know that using these pods is just barely dipping my toes into making incredible espresso at home. 

I'm traveling and going to be away from home for 14 days, and I'm panicking. I have about 2-3 drinks a day and feel invigorated for the first time in years, so I don't want to struggle with chain coffee while I'm away. But bringing the entire machine with me sounds insane, though I MAY be that person if things are truly dire.

So I am coming to the experts for help: what do you guys do when you travel? Is there a decent travel-friendly machine that works with the ESE pods?",2,1739474107.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

**1948 - 2013:** Meditation from Episode 3  
  
Next week, from Monday to Thursday, I won't have so much time to meditate, because I will be at a meeting, which will also have a social event at the end of each day. I will however definitely do a ""find the present moment"" meditation daily (20 mins). Maybe at least something unexpected will happen in this unknown place with unknown people.  
Actually, I don't even know why I don't want to go there. Well, for one I have to do a 20 min presentation on some stuff, I don't really know about. And this presentation I just finished preparing today. After and before my presentation it is just being in a ""consumption stance"" (sit, listen and try to not fall asleep). Apart from that, in these 4 days, the work which I could have done during these 4 days, have to be postponed. And it will be more stressful later on. But, well. Doesn't matter anyway, since I can't change it.

**Another thing I**  
As I did my taxes and had to get access to one of my stock accounts, I found one account with about 1000€ in stock. I put orders of selling the 10 stocks, so I after selling, I will be left with about 900+€. I will either invest them into ETH (daily average buy) or keep them, because I will need money in the future to cover mortage. But then again 1k into ETH has more value if ETH pumps, as having paid one more mortage rate.

**Another thing II**  
If the tax office agrees to my tax return, I could get the following amount of money:  
2021  2.375€  
2022  2.954€  
2023 about 2000€  
However, my tax guy will probably take about 500 € to 750 € for each tax return. At least that's the number I remember paying back in the year 2020.  
I will myself to finally do my tax return my self for the last 3 years, but stuff happened and I didn't had to motivation to do it myself and I had to do 3 years of tax return, so I decided to pay someone else to do my tax return for me. Hopefully, I will have the motivation to do my taxes for 2024 on my own. July 2025 is the deadline to do my tax return for 2024.

**Todays's total meditation time: 25 mins (13.02.25)**  
\------------------------------------------------------

**Fast, short and very effective NLP techniques to get rid of negative thoughts & pictures**

**Italian love**

* See, hear or feel that negative thought/ picture / voice appear in your mind and give it some Italian love with a back hand slap.
* Then see that negative thought cry, while holding its slapped cheek, run back into its room, close the door and staying in its room forever.
* Which of your future negative thoughts would you like to give some Italian love?

**Sexy Strobes or Catch & Choke (not sure which name is better haha)**

* When a thought/ image/ sound occurs in your mind, grab it in your mind.
* And if you like it rough, choke that f\*\*\*er like you would choke a BDSM fetishist.
* Then shrink it down to the size of a penny and let it blink black and white extremely fast and say ""brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt"" (like machine gun fire) in your mind or out loud.
* Finally, throw it way back into the distance, until it disappears completely and lights up like a shining star/ dot at the end of the universe.
* Like in Pokemon, where the bad guys get blown away into the distance.
* Now, how much of your negative future shit can you catch & choke & let it blink black and white in the next minute?

**Cultured Catch (same as Catch & Choke just less sexy and for prude people only) (I'm kidding)**

* Grab that thought and throw it way into the distance or hit that thought with a baseball bat from the get-go
* see it explode like fireworks on New Year's Eve and
* know now that these fireworks are shining bright in celebration of you
* having already banished your old self from your current life and
* your new self has already emerged and is already stabilizing in your new life right now.
* PS: I'm not kidding.

**Banana Boss**

* I forgot the instructions, so I will write how this played out for me. This will be enough for you to visualize it yourself.
* Picture a naggy boss/ wife/ husband or whomever is being naggy with you.
* As the person gets naggy notice 8 mischievous monkeys jumping out of the next room or corner and coming into his direction.
* Now, how many monkeys do you need to order on amazon prime now to re-adjust how you see some people at your environments?
* NEVER EVER tell the other person or anybody else that you did picture this.
* It might hurt the other persons feelings and it won't be good for your relationship.
* One monkey jumps him at puts a banana in his mouth.
* Two monkeys shove a chain, made out of bananas, over his head.
* Three monkeys throw one banana each onto him and he begins to juggle them bananas.
* One monkey strikes the ground with his whip ordering him to dance in a circle, while juggling the bananas.
* One monkey jumps on one of your shoulders and touches you with his elbow like bro and says ""This asshole. Look how stupid he looks"" while laughing and pointing at him.

About a month later, I decide to give them a second chance with their ice cream maker.   The machine is a little noisy (nothing egregious), but more importantly the knob that controls the hardness setting seems to be loose, mounted at an angle, spins free and then a quarter turn later spins like it's rubbing on something.  

We approached customer service and they agreed and sent us a replacement device (with a $180 hold and the contingency of mailing back the original device).   We received the replacement device last night and haven't plugged it in yet, because it appears the knob on this one has similar issues:  mounted at an angle, spins free-ish, then gets hard to turn.    Except this knob isn't quite as loose it's actually more difficult to turn.

Has anyone experienced this with their own Breville?   Should I be concerned about the control board below it potentially being susceptible to damage (if not already damaged)?   Is your control knob wonky too?   If I return this altogether and give up on their brand, what would you recommend as an alternative?",3,1739473627.0,icecreamery,1,1.0,False

1ioqpuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ioqpuy/22m_and_24m/,22M and 24M,"I met a guy in college and we started hooking up. At first it was all just for fun and seemed to be a fwb thing however we wouldn’t just hook up but would get coffee, gym, and other stuff and he was the one to first initiate these things. 

I started getting feelings for him and thought that his initiation to do other things and texting somewhat everyday was a sign that things were turning into something more. We wouldn’t talk about deep stuff and really got to know each other. However I noticed some red flags about him such as only connecting through snap, not wanting to share instagram, and rarely texting back on weekends. 

It was 4 months in and I didn’t want to bring it up and have the “what are we talk” because I’m not a confrontational type of person and didn’t wanna ruin the vibe. However i caught an std and I told him about it and we stopped talking for a month. I was in the worst mindset ever and thought I had ruined my entire life. I thought I was never gonna hear back from him and I wouldn’t expect him to but he reached out asking how I was doing and insisted we go gym. When we met up again at the gym he was sincere about how I was doing and afterward kept flirting with me basically the whole gym session. After the gym, he insisted that he drive me to my car because we parked in different structures. When I got in his car he put his hand on my thigh and leaned in to kiss me and we started to make out. We held hands as he drove me back to my car and I went into my car confused and overwhelmed and started crying after he drove away. I should have asked him why he did that but I didn’t want to ruin the moment and was happy that it seemed like everything was going to be okay.

We then continued talking again and slowly got back to hooking up again. However months slowly kept going by and he hadn’t  brought up anything about us being something more. I got fed up and finally went over to his place and asked him what is going on with us and if wanted something more. He told me that he isn’t looking for a relationship and that he had one back when he was a teenager and that it was when he was a stupid kid. He then followed up saying that we should stop all intimacy. I didn’t know what to say or how to respond because I get so flustered by any sort of confrontation or disagreement of any sort that my mind goes blank. Everything that i was feeling when i first caught the std came flooding back and i told him that i should go. He was shocked that i wanted to go and he said that i should stay to hang out. I just said that i can’t because have work soon and we hugged at the door and i got into my car and drove to a parking lot and broke down. 

We didn’t talk for another month, however he then messaged me on snap asking how I was doing and we began snapping everyday again. Months after of just hanging out and texting everyday, he invited me over to his place asking if I wanted to hook up and I caved and said yes. 

I regretted going over to his place and letting it all happen again. So I texted him again asking whether he wanted something more and he said that he was dealing with some financial stuff with being in debt and still living with his parents. I also asked him if he wasn’t dealing with those things would he want us to be something more and he said “he wasn’t opposed to the idea of it”. That to me sounds like he’s on the fence about us and I followed up asking whether he see us being something more and he said that he hadn’t had time to think about it. All this was concerning to me because how can you not had time to think about us being something more with it being more than year of us knowing each other. I then told him that I think it’s best for my own mental well being that we stop talking at least until he’s ready for something more. 

I apologize for the rant, but I’d love to hear your thoughts. It’s been over two months since we last spoke, and I can’t stop thinking about him. I’m constantly analyzing every situation, trying to figure out if he genuinely liked me or if he was merely leading me on for attention. I hold onto hope that he’ll text me soon. While I’m trying to focus on my personal goals, including my health and career, this entire situation constantly occupies my mind. I still want there to be something more between us, but only if he reciprocates those feelings. Any advice on the situation?",1,1739473501.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

And it was amazing!,"I came home with a huge smile plastered on my face. The kids are lovely, they're cute, well behaved, polite, playful, and fun to be around. We went to a cool playground with huge slides and a zip line, I could let my hair lose, play with them, make them laugh and truly be in the moment with them. I think it healed my abused inner child a little. After that we went to a nice family-friendly restaurant, and my friend was pretty anxious because it was the first time the kids went to a proper restaurant, they've only been to McDonald's once or twice before. It went so well! They loved the food and ate everything, they were well behaved, we only had to discipline them a few times when they got a bit louder while playing with the toys the restaurant provided, and they listened immediately, so we had a coffee and a grown up conversation while they played. After that we drove around for a while so they could have their nap in the car and we continued catching up with each other. After they woke up we said our goodbyes and I got the biggest hugs from them. 

I'm glad I could come home to my quiet apartment to have a nice meal, smoke some weed, have sex with my partner and cuddle together with our kitty afterwards. I love my child-free life. I also love children.

I felt like posting, because I kind of got sick from all the negativity towards kids and parents here. There are shitty people who have kids, but the kids themselves are not shitty, they're products of their environment. All children are innocent, cute as hell little fuckers, they're a blank slate. They are not at fault if they're never taught manners, empathy, life skills, if they don't have the love or attention they deserve, and they act out to get it, or if they're brought up by ipads instead of their parents. I think loving children and being child-free are two different things, I have many reasons to be childless, but also so many reasons to love children. Time spent with children shouldn't be insufferable, and some parents actually love their children and know how to raise them. 

My opinion might be unpopular, but I love being the cool auntie, and the nice teacher (I work in special ed kid development), getting love from children is priceless in my eyes.

1ioqn1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1ioqn1f/what_do_you_guys_think/,What do you guys think?,"I met a guy in college and we started hooking up. At first it was all just for fun and seemed to be a fwb thing however we wouldn’t just hook up but would get coffee, gym, and other stuff and he was the one to first initiate these things. 

I started getting feelings for him and thought that his initiation to do other things and texting somewhat everyday was a sign that things were turning into something more. We wouldn’t talk about deep stuff and really got to know each other. However I noticed some red flags about him such as only connecting through snap, not wanting to share instagram, and rarely texting back on weekends. 

It was 4 months in and I didn’t want to bring it up and have the “what are we talk” because I’m not a confrontational type of person and didn’t wanna ruin the vibe. However i caught an std and I told him about it and we stopped talking for a month. I was in the worst mindset ever and thought I had ruined my entire life. I thought I was never gonna hear back from him and I wouldn’t expect him to but he reached out asking how I was doing and insisted we go gym. When we met up again at the gym he was sincere about how I was doing and afterward kept flirting with me basically the whole gym session. After the gym, he insisted that he drive me to my car because we parked in different structures. When I got in his car he put his hand on my thigh and leaned in to kiss me and we started to make out. We held hands as he drove me back to my car and I went into my car confused and overwhelmed and started crying after he drove away. I should have asked him why he did that but I didn’t want to ruin the moment and was happy that it seemed like everything was going to be okay.

We then continued talking again and slowly got back to hooking up again. However months slowly kept going by and he hadn’t  brought up anything about us being something more. I got fed up and finally went over to his place and asked him what is going on with us and if wanted something more. He told me that he isn’t looking for a relationship and that he had one back when he was a teenager and that it was when he was a stupid kid. He then followed up saying that we should stop all intimacy. I didn’t know what to say or how to respond because I get so flustered by any sort of confrontation or disagreement of any sort that my mind goes blank. Everything that i was feeling when i first caught the std came flooding back and i told him that i should go. He was shocked that i wanted to go and he said that i should stay to hang out. I just said that i can’t because have work soon and we hugged at the door and i got into my car and drove to a parking lot and broke down. 

We didn’t talk for another month, however he then messaged me on snap asking how I was doing and we began snapping everyday again. Months after of just hanging out and texting everyday, he invited me over to his place asking if I wanted to hook up and I caved and said yes. 

I regretted going over to his place and letting it all happen again. So I texted him again asking whether he wanted something more and he said that he was dealing with some financial stuff with being in debt and still living with his parents. I also asked him if he wasn’t dealing with those things would he want us to be something more and he said “he wasn’t opposed to the idea of it”. That to me sounds like he’s on the fence about us and I followed up asking whether he see us being something more and he said that he hadn’t had time to think about it. All this was concerning to me because how can you not had time to think about us being something more with it being more than year of us knowing each other. I then told him that I think it’s best for my own mental well being that we stop talking at least until he’s ready for something more. 

I apologize for the rant, but I’d love to hear your thoughts. It’s been over two months since we last spoke, and I can’t stop thinking about him. I’m constantly analyzing every situation, trying to figure out if he genuinely liked me or if he was merely leading me on for attention. I hold onto hope that he’ll text me soon. While I’m trying to focus on my personal goals, including my health and career, this entire situation constantly occupies my mind. I still want there to be something more between us, but only if he reciprocates those feelings. Any advice on the situation?",2,1739473309.0,askgaybros,1,1.0,False

My every-day bag is a eBag Professional Slim that I've traveled around the world with since 2016 - it still looks and works like new. But, of all its features I regularly only use the laptop compartment and accessory pouch on the bottom. 

My ideal features for a business tote would include:

* Large opening for lunch and stuff
* Laptop sleeve (accessible when the bag is closed would be great)
* 1 - 2 Exterior pockets for my cables, mouse and other stuff I carry on the daily
* 2-3 Interior pockets for other things
* 2 water bottle sleeves (I carry a bottle for coffee and a bottle for water)
* Stiff enough to stand up with a reinforced bottom since it lives on the floor at work
* Long straps for everyday, and a removable shoulder strap
* Ancillary attachment points for a couple of carabiners, hooks, or other misc. that might come in handy.
* A way to slide it onto my luggage  and passport pocket would be great, but are optional for me.

1ioqffb,https://www.reddit.com/r/GTAV/comments/1ioqffb/catties_car_reviews_2007_karin_beejay_xl/,Cattie's Car Reviews: 2007 Karin BeeJay XL,"Hello everyone and welcome to Cattie's Car Reviews. Today we are reviewing the 2007 Karin BeeJay XL. In order to do this, I acquired one & took a day trip around San Andreas, testing a variety of its qualities and features. The vehicle I had was a mid-trim 4WD model valued at $27,000 USD, with a smattering of options & equipped with a 4.7L V8 coupled to a 5-speed automatic transmission. It had low mileage for it's age, with just over 91,000 miles on it's odometer. The vehicle was stock & unmodified, and all service was up-to-date. The vehicle was graciously provided to me by Simeon Yetarian at Premium Deluxe Motorsport in Pillbox Hill, you should check them out!

Background:

The BeeJay XL was introduced in 2004 for the 2005 model year, at the Los Santos National Motor Convention (LSNMC) at Maze Bank Arena, and produced until 2015. It was intended to compete with the fourth-generation Canis Mesa, which was beginning to sell rapidly in the mid-2000s after its iconic appearance in ""Prime Mate"" in 2003, the precursor to the 2013 blockbuster film ""The Simian"". The BeeJay XL was marketed as a versatile & rugged SUV for the younger generation, who were quickly beginning to lose interest in full-size SUVs like the Mammoth Patriot.  

Performance: 

The BeeJay XL accelerates rather slowly. It goes 0-60 in about 9.2 seconds, and that's flooring it. Despite the beefy engine, the SUV feels sluggish even at full throttle. I felt as if it was fighting against me, not working with me when I gave it gas. It's safe to say the BeeJay XL is not meant for spirited driving, and it feels like wasted potential given it's 4.7L V8, but it comes detuned into oblivion. 

In terms of handling, the suspension feels far too stiff for a vehicle of its size, and its high center of gravity made it prone to understeering at high speeds, and tapping the gas even slightly during a turn would cause it to quickly lose traction & fishtail. The front & rear dampers are hard, causing further loss of grip when cornering & preventing weight transfer on uneven roads. The SUV quickly lost traction 

The stock brakes are powerful & fast-acting, but feels jolty & the anti-lock system is prone to failure. It was challenging to brake even at low speeds without producing an unpleasant screech. The entirety of the vehicle is designed for torque over power, which makes sense for this general type of vehicle, but leads to an everyday driving experience that feels underwhelming at best, though it does fare quite well on inclines.

The recommended tire pressure is just incorrect 46 PSI for the rear tires and 32 in the front causes the tires to skid at an aggressive launch & excessive wheelspin in the front. The recommended tire sizes are fine, but don't use the recommended tire model; the treads are far too shallow in an effort to preserve fuel economy, but the BeeJay XL is already not particularly economical to begin with. The tires lose grip & become sloppy in the rain. 

The BeeJay XL was marketed as having comparable gas mileage to the Mesa, but in actuality I got about 14 in the city & about 20 on the highway. I struggled to keep up with other vehicles on I-1, and the vehicle was unable to reach 90mph. Weight distribution seems like an afterthought in this vehicle. 

In terms of actually driving off-road, it's lackluster in most ways but it does have upsides. It's sluggish on the road but it's almost irritatingly slow & unresponsive on dirt roads & trails, but it doesn't slide on dynamic surfaces like sand or fine gravel. It's throttle response is too slow to gracefully maneuver it, but It's high torque means it can climb inclines slowly but it doesn't slip or redline under the stress, which is impressive given how heavy it is. I took it through the mud, and it was able to power through a 2 feet & a half of quagmire without getting stuck, and the engine didn't waterlog under water up to the bottom of the hood. The ride height is, frankly, too low, and the suspension & weight distribution are unforgiving & not dynamic enough for reliable use off-road. Front suspension parts are poorly-engineered and prone to getting stuck on themselves and/or failing entirely.

Comfort/Interior:

The BeeJay XL that I was provided had grey leather seats which felt too hard for my liking and the circular headrest may have been aesthetically interesting in 2007 but caused my neck to strain as it came too far forward. One thing I will give it is the BeeJay XL has legroom for days. The interior is incredibly spacious; I'm 5'10 and I can practically extend my arm up all the way without touching the ceiling, but it's probably unusable if you're under \~5'8. My only gripe in terms of space is the unnecessarily large & blocky steering wheel, and the entire dashboard & center console feel supersized to me, which seems mostly to have been done out of aesthetics, but I'd prefer if it were more compact for ease of use. Rear passengers will be able to put their legs out forward & stretch without issue.

The materials used are basic but not low-quality, although the faux-leather seats aren't plush & feel stiff, they are aptly ventilated. The creative use of polypropylene compounds in creating certain dashboard components protects the dash & center console from cracks, and the leather & fabric components are of a high tensile grade. The seats & carpets are designed to be stain-proof, which I learned when braking at a medium speed caused my coffee to fly out of the cup holder. 

The ride quality is not very good because of the stiff suspension components. When I drove on the dirt roads near Lago Zancudo & through Raton Canyon, I could feel every bump along the way. It doesn't roll too much, but it is top-heavy. They tried to combat roll with a stiff suspension, but it ended up making it feel like you were riding in a very big & blocky horse-drawn carriage. The unforgiving brakes blast you and your loose items forward even at a low speed. 

The SUV lacks proper sound insulation & the engine noise blares & resonates throughout the entire cabin. Interior panels vibrate violently along with what seems to be the entire body, but they do not produce a rattling noise. Screechy brakes & suspension noises are also audible from the car interior. 

Climate control is actually pretty decent. Heated seats were equipped on this model, but aren't useful in San Andreas. Front and rear A/C is functional & there's a good airflow circulating throughout the cabin, with two large cabin air filters mounted at either end of the dash. I get stuffy in some car interiors, but that was not so with the BeeJay XL, so I'll give it credit where credit is due. 

Technology/Amenities: 

The interior is pretty barebones in terms of actual content. It has a standard AM/FM radio and a CD player & MP3/aux jack in the dash. The dashboard & radio controls really feel far bigger than they need to be. The 2007 model does not have Bluetooth compatibility, but this was eventually added in 2012. There's no touchscreen as is to be expected in most cars from 2007, and a touchscreen was never available until its discontinuation in 2015. The sound system is okay, with 6 mid-range Wiwang speakers positioned discreetly around the interior. There was an option for an 8-speaker system with adjustable bass & treble, but mine did not have that. Power everything is standard as well as a power steering system & ABS, but both of those systems have been recalled several times and are known to be faulty. Cruise control is standard. There is no traction control. 

Practicality:

The BeeJay XL does have plenty of storage space. The trunk has more than enough room to carry a small household appliance, bookcase, push-mower, or similar items. It also comes with tie-down straps built into the floor, a compartment for a first aid kit & repair kit, a chassis-mounted spare tire, and a massive passenger glovebox. However, mine lacked the optional roof rack. There are more cup holders than are necessary: the center console has four, with one in each door and three that extend out from the center console for the rear passengers. 

The SUV comfortably fits five people with good legroom and space to breathe. One interesting feature is rubber floor mats built into the carpet, which is all well & good until you have to clean them & they can't be removed. The floor mats read ""KARIN"" in huge letters, which is pretty useful if you forget what brand your SUV is. While the BeeJay XL could tow a small cargo or 2-person travel trailer with the optional hitch, I'd advise against it out of handling concerns. Materials for the interior are durable, as well as the hefty exterior plastics which are scratch-proof, and the paint is protected with a hydrophobic coating & resistant to iron contamination. One advantage of such a stiff suspension is that it is not easily weighted down by intense payloads. Engine cooling is very well-organized with a large air vent in the hood & powerful radiator.

The biggest practicality issue is what I would call the Achilles heel of the entire car, which is the horrendously-engineered suspension & steering rack. This part of the car is absolutely horrible, and some mind-bogglingly poor packaging choices were made here. Moving parts are crammed in close together and at awkward angles, meaning even just driving over too large of a pothole can cause one or both of the front wheels to completely lock, immediately rendering the car unusable. If something is hit head-on at a low speed, the oversized front bumper will retract & push the inflexible crossmember backwards, completely destroying the front suspension. 

I will note however that it's easy to modify with off-road components, and \*tends\* to be easily serviced by oneself with the exception of the awful front suspension mess. 

Safety:

The BeeJay XL is prone to rollovers due to a high center of gravity, and its seatbelts are far too slow to lock. There are driver & passenger airbags, but no side airbags even as an option, which is an awful decision safety-wise. The huge steering wheel & dashboard can't retract due to the amount of space taken up by a large engine, so they will be pushed into the driver & passenger in a collision. The front subframe & suspension crossmember prevent the BeeJay XL from sufficiently absorbing an impact & get pushed backward during a collision, and the body can come loose from the ladder frame in the worst case scenario.  In a small overlap collision the vehicle has a high chance to roll over. How it passed crash testing is beyond me, this vehicle is disturbingly unsafe. 

Driver assistance systems are there but badly designed & have been recalled several times over. You have ABS and mechanical power steering, but these are known to be faulty & unpredictable. The car lacks ESC and traction control, both of which are things that it desperately needs. The BeeJay XL has a lower profile than most of its competitors & surprisingly the windshield visibility from the driver is quite good, but has enormous blind spots from the A & C pillars in the periphery, with no monitoring system and no real reason for them to be that big. The glass is chemically treated and avoids fogging up. It is also glare-resistant. The BeeJay XL has powerful headlights, but to a blinding extent, and oncoming traffic will be blinded by the low beams. There's no reason for them to be that bright, it could cause an accident.

Design:

In terms of styling, the exterior has actually held up quite well. It's not my cup of tea, but it's someone's & it doesn't look too outdated, even in 2025. I think it's a bit gaudy but it's not overdesigned or overly-simplistic. I'm not a huge fan of the massive vent on the hood, I think personally it should be body-colored, but that's only subjective. I couldn't help but note that the tail lights kind of look like okras. The stock rims are chunky & kind of silly: they have the same general design language as discount store action figures, but they're far from the worst I've seen.

I'd also like to note that the BJXL was available in some fun colors as well, such as dark green or bright yellow, which is a plus in my eyes. Most were made in two-tone. The model I was provided was dark grey with a white roof, and the color was fitting for the design in my eyes. I'm not a big fan of the car, but I didn't mind looking at it. 

The interior design is a different story. Once you step inside, it makes it VERY clear you are stepping inside something designed in 2005, and the interior was never updated until discontinued in 2015. Seats, door cards, and most importantly the dash & steering wheel are giant & blocky. The interior is very much a product of its time, however I do appreciate the body-colored trim on the door cards and dashboard/center console liner. It's a basic interior, yet somehow manages to be over-the-top and cheesy at the same time. 

The car isn't aerodynamic at all which causes the driver to hear wind noises on the highway. There's ample interior lighting, and a light inside the glovebox, in each footwell, and all dashboard dials & the gauge cluster clearly light up & are visible at night. 

Value/Ownership:

It's not worth the price, in my eyes. A Canis Mesa is $7,000 USD cheaper, better off-road, and better on fuel economy. The repair costs are random: most of the time, it's low-maintenance, but if the front suspension fails (which it will at some time or another) the repair cost is through the roof. Karin does have a good warranty on these, but it's plagued by recalls & the suspension seizing risk is just too high. It's going to depreciate, and I don't see values rising for BJXLs any time soon, even if well-maintained. Overall, I don't see the point in buying one. They tend to be overpriced & underwhelming in terms of features & performance. 

Fun Factor:

I will say that it is a car where you can feel the speed, the braking, and the acceleration. Which is something I like, but most people don't actively seek out. You can also feel every bump in the road because of a rigid suspension. The ride isn't fun in a sports car type way or an off-roader type way, but it could be fun in a ""I might flip over at any time on a 40mph stroad"" type of way. The car elicits a deep hum from a loud engine & can be taken on mild off-road trails, but it's not half the off-roader it was marketed as. It's great if you're nostalgic for the mid to late 2000s & don't care about safety. 

Conclusion: 

The 2007 Karin BeeJay XL just... isn't very good. I'm a big fan of Karin cars 90% of the time, and I like their brand philosophy of making ""cars for everyone"". But this is a somewhat disappointing contradiction to that: I don't know who this is for. It's got some big drawbacks & is otherwise mediocre & overpriced. I'm not sure who exactly it was buying one new, and who exactly is buying one now. It feels like it's all show, it's performative, it's more about a macho off-roader image than actually being capable. 

I tend to see this most commonly in Rockford Hills being driven by frat guys or entitled, clueless, impulsive 20-something stoners with rich parents. It's an outlier when compared to other Karin vehicles, which are characterized as versatile and uber-reliable. 

To conclude, I would rate the BeeJay XL a 3.5/10. Let me know your recommendations for cars I should review, within reason (OOC: that spawn somewhere on the map & I can take). 

See you soon!

The Growing Trend of Vegan Options in Fast Food Establishments
--------------------------------------------------------------

Fast food has long been associated with burgers, fries, and sugary sodas. However, a new wave is changing this perception. As more individuals embrace healthier and more sustainable lifestyles, fast food establishments are responding by adding vegan options to their menus. This trend is not only catering to vegans but also appealing to anyone looking for healthier choices. Here are some key insights into this rising trend.

### The Appeal of Vegan Options

Vegan options offer a plethora of benefits. Many people choose to go vegan for health reasons, while others do so for environmental sustainability or animal welfare. Fast food chains realize that by offering these options, they can attract a broader customer base. You might be surprised by how many people are willing to try vegan meals, even if they are not full-time vegans.

### Notable Chains Leading the Charge

More fast food chains are introducing vegan dishes, some of which might surprise you. Here’s a closer look at a few noteworthy establishments:

- **Chipotle:** This Mexican grill has a wide range of options for vegans. Their sofritas, a spicy tofu filling, is a hit, and their customizable burritos and bowls make it easy to create a satisfying meal.
- **Subway:** With its “Veggie Delite” sandwich, Subway offers a customizable experience that allows you to pile on your favorite fresh veggies and choose from a selection of bread.
- **Starbucks:** Not only famous for its coffee, but Starbucks also offers several vegan options, including the famous Impossible Breakfast Sandwich and various plant-based snacks.
- **Taco Bell:** Known for its zest and unique flavors, Taco Bell has a “Vegetarian Menu” that includes a variety of customizable items that can easily be made vegan.
- **Little Caesars:** Recently, they introduced a vegan pizza with a plant-based pepperoni option. This move caters to the growing demand for plant-based meat substitutes.
- **KFC:** The fried chicken giant has tested vegan chicken sandwiches and nuggets, aiming to satisfy customers looking for plant-based alternatives that don’t sacrifice flavor.
- **Dunkin’:** With their Beyond Sausage Sandwich and various vegan snack options, Dunkin' is ensuring that vegan choices are just a coffee stop away.

### Changing Consumer Demands

The explosion of vegan options correlates with changing consumer demands. As people become more health-conscious, they seek quick meal options that don’t compromise their dietary choices. This shift is driving fast food chains to rethink their menus. In turn, it not only benefits those who are vegan but also people who are looking to make healthier decisions on the go.

-Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
### Environmental Factors

Another compelling reason for the increase in vegan menu items is environmental awareness. A significant number of studies show that a plant-based diet can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As more consumers become aware of their ecological footprints, they are seeking establishments that align with their values. This has led fast food chains to offer plant-based meals, allowing customers to enjoy their favorites while being conscious of their impact on the planet.

### The Future of Fast Food Choices

This trend is likely to continue growing. Fast food is focusing on convenience, speed, and taste, but the demand for healthier and sustainable options will prompt more changes. As more chains introduce vegan menus, you can expect to see diverse flavors and innovative menu items that satisfy various taste buds.

This shift is indicative of a more significant change in society where the demand for ethical eating and healthy options reigns supreme. Whether you’re a full-time vegan or just curious about plant-based meals, there is something for everyone to enjoy. You may even find yourself enthusiastically trying new vegan dishes that you never would have considered before!

So whether you are grabbing a meal on your lunch break or enjoying a quick snack, keep an eye out for these exciting vegan options emerging in your favorite fast-food chains. They not only cater to vegans but also provide delicious alternatives that everyone can enjoy.

1ioqega,https://www.reddit.com/r/cabincrewcareers/comments/1ioqega/cjo_alaska/,CJO!! 🏔️ Alaska,"I accepted my CJO with Alaska this week. Wanted to share some insight to help others without outright spoiling what to expect.

Context:
- I got a CJO last year from Horizon but declined for personal reasons
- I had a F2F with Delta but did not get the CJO
- I have no previous airline experience and this was my first time applying for Alaska

Experience:
The night prior, I met up with a group of 12 other candidates to have dinner. It was fantastic! We got to know each other and break the ice. I loved this. It made going into the interview less scary because others were with you. The people I met were all so incredible: kind, empathetic, and all with unique backgrounds. We also spoke over the pillars of the company and brainstormed ways to be prepared. I found this so helpful and left the dinner even more motivated.

Day of, myself and others arrived about an hour early and checked in. I was able to hug and greet my new friends from the night before. We all waited until 8am when the day started.

We all were sat together and the four FAs leading the day introduced themselves and allowed us to ask questions while checkin began. They were all very kind and had great stories about the Alaska journey. For example, one was recruited at 21 and had been there many years and another had jumped a few airlines before landing at Alaska. During check in, they excused anyone who didn’t have their resume or the other required documents.

We all watched an informational video before being led to a lounge area where we could help ourselves to coffee and cocoa. We got to mingle with other candidates as people were pulled into their one on ones. The four FAs hung out with us and socialized. I can only compare this to Delta. When I was at that F2F, everyone was crowding around the one or two FAs mingling in the room. Here, it felt like folks broke into smaller groups. Some candidates hung out with friends and the FAs went around to mingle. I really appreciated this. It felt less stressful and very “chill”.

They provided some snacks around noon as one on ones continued. Throughout the day, they walked some candidates out who didn’t make it past their interviews. I could tell this stressed folks out. No one wanted to be walked out.

The group activity was much more relaxed compared to Delta’s. While I won’t be specific on what we did, it was solving a problem with our team. My team communicated great and we all didn’t speak over each other and collaborated well. Out of my group, 4/5 of us were offered CJOs.

Out of the group that met for dinner the night before, 7/12 of us got CJOs. I felt like hanging out with them and going in as friends made the day so much more relaxing. We all were rooting for each other all day! They gave around 20 people offers but it was sporadic throughout the day so I cannot confirm the actual number. Some folks let go were so incredible, so I can’t share why they were not given an offer other than maybe it wasn’t the best time for them. I hope they reapply.

After, we got finger printed and drug tested and we are waiting on our training dates. Several of us are aiming to be in the same class together. I am grateful for the experience and opportunity. Alaska, to me, felt like a warm hug. Everyone seemed genuinely interested in the candidates and excited to learn more. It was less formal (no STAR method) and very conversational. They for sure want to know you researched Alaska so go in knowing their bases and their pillars.

Best of luck to anyone applying in the future. I can’t wait to get my wings!

Let me first tell you about me (19F) and my crush (19M) from my class. We met in biology lab last year and we wrote lab reports together all the time because we sat together. We had a nice chem. (the seats in the lab are decided by the class's list and I'm 3rd he is 4th.) we have known each other for 1.5 years now. I think he was kinda making silent moves last year but I didn't realize it back then. (he has sent me hearty lovey dovey stickers while messaging etc. etc.) And this year I started liking him because it felt right and fun. Then my liking started getting serious and I got so excited everytime I see him but I seriously have no idea if he likes me or not now. (I at least know he doesn't have a lover thanks to mutual friends) I normally would rather taking things slow and start flirting but. Guys. I get so much anxiety whenever I seriously like someone and I haven't been able to sleep properly for a week now. I have my committee exams coming and I can't afford to ruin academics by ignoring my feelings. So I decided to make a move. Here is my plan: I will text him saturday night asking ""wanna hang out whenever you are free? (or would you ever be free)"" He will understand it is a date because we don't text often and we haven't met outside of school before. If he accepts I plan to tell him about my feelings while drinking coffee. Also I will probably stress my assss offf so I thought would it be cute if I brought sticker sheets with me so we can cut them together while talking so it's like crafty kinda date. I am also stressed about dating with him what if it gets awkward and he don't enjoy ittt AAAHHH so scary. I am sorry if I overshared and if it's dum to ask but do you think this is a good idea? would he like it? Should I do it? (extra: Lab groups changed this year so we normally don't have labs together anymore.

Back story the girlfriend (let’s name her Jen) has a lot of issues. Her mom left her dad and her and her sister when she was 12, the mom came back into her life and they have a friendly relationship now. She has an eating disorder as well. Her dad also died and her therapist of 10+ years also died 1 month after her dad. My brother has been there for her through everything. My brother also has tunnel vision for her. She is his EVERYTHING. He would never even think about thinking about another girl no one else exists in his world but her. Almost 2 years ago she dumped him for not understating her and being too clingy. In all honesty he was too clingy. He LIVED and breathed to please her and still does even though she avoids him. He has written her letters messages etc to try to talk to her but she has evidently moved on. We just found out Jen’s MOM contacts Jim regularly. It was his birthday a few days ago and she sent him a message and invited him out to coffee. At this coffee date she spent 2 hours telling Jim how well Jen is doing and how happy she is. She told Jim she would love to see him more. Jim came home and started crying and told my mom and I all this. He told us he feels like he has nothing to live for without Jen. After I asked why the hell Jens mom is talking to him he only said she sometimes invites him to where she works (tennis club) to hang out not too often but often enough. He no longer wants to talk eat work etc. I told my mom she should fight Jen’s mom. Jim was doing better. Not great or even good but better.

In this Latin soap opera, a woman with brown hair in a bun in a white sweater is seen slipping sleeping pills into a pot of coffee. She entices her friend, a woman with jet black hair in an off-the-shoulder sheer blouse (her character is named Elisa, I was able to pick up) to have coffee and conversation with her. The second woman has flashbacks to previous conversations. She eventually falls asleep from the pills, and wakes up to find herself handcuffed to a bed with green and blue sheets. She's been changed into a dark blue crop top and gray pants, and a strip of pink tape has been placed over her mouth. The woman who knocked her out has changed into an orange shirt and spends the following scenes feeding her captive with a tray, giving her pasta, spaghetti, and coffee, and constantly taunting her throughout. Later on, we see the captured woman slide out of bed to write a note with a blue pen, using her one free hand, alerting her family to rescue her. She clutches the pen's cap in her mouth as she writes. She shoves the note back into her bag and reassumes her position on the bed. Finally, after some negotiation, she is released from her predicament.

None of my breakers were thrown and nothing else has stopped working. I tested the breakers for the dinning room and surrounding rooms to see if that could reset them (father-in-law's suggestion) this fixed nothing.

Choosing the right location for your PMP exam isn’t just about convenience. Various factors, including your learning preferences, available testing formats, and even practical concerns like travel and timing, can significantly impact your exam-day success.

This guide breaks down all the considerations you need to make when deciding where (and how) to take your PMP exam. By the end, you’ll feel confident that you’ve chosen the perfect place to set yourself up for success! 

# What Is the PMP Exam and Why It Matters

The **PMP Exam**, short for the Project Management Professional exam, is one of the most respected certifications for project managers globally. Offered by [PMI](https://www.pmi.org/) (Project Management Institute), the PMP certification demonstrates your competence and expertise in managing projects effectively, making it highly sought after in industries ranging from IT and construction to marketing and healthcare. 

Passing the exam isn’t easy—it tests your knowledge of project management best practices, principles, and frameworks. But don’t worry! Deciding where to take it is one step you can control to set yourself up for success. 

# Key Factors to Consider When Picking Your Location 

Before we dive into specific locations, let’s discuss some important factors you should consider when deciding where to take your PMP exam. 

# 1. Testing Formats Available 

PMI offers two methods for taking the PMP exam, so your decision starts here:

* **Online Proctored Exam** – Allows you to take the exam from the comfort of your home or any quiet location with a stable internet connection. 
* **Test Center Exam** – Requires you to go to a designated test center, often with a controlled environment. 

Each format has its benefits and challenges, so picking the right one comes down to personal preference (more on this later!). 

# 2. Location Convenience 

If you’re opting for a test center exam, accessibility is key. You’ll want to find a center close to you to avoid unnecessary travel stress on exam day. Search if there’s a **PMI-accredited testing center** nearby through the official PMI website or Pearson VUE (PMI’s examination partner).  

Some practical questions to ask include:

* How far is the test center from home or work? 
* What are the transportation options? 
* Are there parking facilities? 

# 3. Environment & Comfort 

Your exam environment plays a crucial role in your ability to concentrate. 

* Are you someone who thrives in a quiet, controlled testing room? A **test center exam** might provide the perfect setup, free from home distractions or internet issues. 
* Prefer familiar surroundings and your favorite coffee mug within arm’s reach? The **online proctored option** might feel more comfortable for you. 

# 4. Scheduling Availability 

Timing is critical. Depending on when you’re ready, one format may have greater availability than the other. **Test centers might have limited slots**, while the online exam offers more **flexibility with scheduling**, including evenings and weekends. 

# 5. Technological Requirements 

For those taking the online proctored exam, your technology setup must meet PMI’s requirements. Test your computer in advance using the system test provided by PMI to ensure you won’t encounter technical glitches on exam day.

It’s also essential to have a stable internet connection to avoid disruptions. 

# 6. Your Personal Learning Preferences 

Finally, consider how you learn and take exams best:

* Do you like structured settings? Test centers provide a rigorous exam environment. 
* Do you perform your best in relaxed, familiar surroundings? The online proctored option could be a game-changer. 

# Should You Choose an Online Exam or a Test Center? 

Still unsure? Here’s a side-by-side comparison of both options to help you decide! 

# Online Proctored Exam 

# Advantages: 

* Take the exam from anywhere (even your living room!). 
* Flexibility to schedule an exam time that works best for you, including evenings and weekends. 
* No commute, saving valuable time and energy on exam day. 

# Challenges: 

* Requires a distraction-free space at home. 
* Internet or technical issues could occur during the exam. 
* You must follow strict rules regarding desk setup and visibility, which some find limiting. 

# Best for: 

Individuals who are tech-savvy, good at managing their environment, and want scheduling flexibility. 

# Exam at a Test Center 

# Advantages: 

* A professionally monitored environment ensures minimal distractions. 
* No need to worry about technical difficulties disrupting your exam. 
* Familiarity with traditional testing settings (a bonus for those who struggle with online exams). 

# Challenges: 

* Limited availability for convenient locations or times. 
* Travel and parking could add extra stress. 

# Best for: 

Individuals who feel more comfortable in a structured, in-person environment with fewer technical uncertainties. 

# Preparing for Your Exam Day 

No matter which option you choose, preparation is key to a smooth exam day. Here’s what to do before the big day. 

# For Online Exams:

* Ensure your computer meets PMI’s compatibility requirements (they provide a system checker for this). 
* Test your webcam and microphone. 
* Find a quiet space where you won’t be interrupted for the entire exam duration. 

# For Test Center Exams:

* Arrive early to avoid last-minute stress. 
* Bring the required identification documents. 
* Dress comfortably and bring a sweater or jacket in case the testing room feels cold. 

# How to Book Your Exam 

Booking your PMP exam is simple:

1. Head to the official PMI website once you’ve completed your PMP application and received approval. 
2. Choose your preferred testing format (online or test center). 
3. Select available dates and times that work for you. 
4. Confirm your details, pay the exam fee, and you’re good to go! 

Keep in mind that PMI members receive a discount on the examination fee, so it’s worth considering membership if you’re not already a part of PMI. 

# Take the Next Step Toward PMP Certification 

Choosing the perfect location or format for your PMP exam is about understanding your needs, preferences, and circumstances. Once you’ve mapped it all out, you’ll be ready to ace your exam in a setting that works best for you. 

Are you ready to take your project management career to the next level? Don’t wait—book your PMP exam today and take one step closer to earning the certification that will elevate your professional growth.

So, for Valentine’s Day, I decided to do something small. Nothing extravagant, nothing over-the-top. Just a handwritten letter. Something that would make him smile in the middle of his long day, maybe remind him that no matter how difficult work got, he had something good waiting for him at home.

I spent longer than I’d like to admit writing it, curling up on the couch with a warm blanket and a glass of wine, tapping my pen against my chin as I thought of the right words. I wrote about the first time we met, the awkward, fumbling early days of our relationship, the late-night talks that stretched into early mornings. I wrote about how grateful I was for him, how much I loved the life we had built together. I even threw in a few of our inside jokes, the stupid ones that made no sense to anyone else but had us gasping for breath from laughing too hard.

When I was satisfied, I folded the letter neatly, placed it in a pink envelope, and sealed it with a kiss. The next morning, I made sure to stop by his office on my way to work. His law firm was in an older building, one of those places with too much marble and not enough personality, but the receptionist at the front desk was friendly enough. She told me to place the envelope in the mailbox just outside the building. She smiled, nodded, and I told her to have a great day.

That evening, Daniel came home as usual. Tired but smiling, just like always. He dropped his bag by the door, loosened his tie, kissed me hello. We had dinner together, talking about our day, well, mostly his day. He didn’t mention the letter, but I didn’t bring it up, either. Maybe he hadn’t gotten around to reading it yet. Maybe he wanted to save it for later.

I figured I’d hear about it soon enough.

But the next morning, before I even had time to get out of bed, I heard the sound of the mail slot opening. The usual stack of letters slid onto the floor, the soft thump barely registering in my half-asleep mind. 

For a second, I smiled. Daniel must have written back. It wasn’t like him, he’d always been more of a talker than a writer - but maybe my little Valentine’s surprise had inspired him.

I sat up, rubbing the sleep from my eyes, and made my way over to the mailbox.

I tore the envelope open and pulled out the letter inside.

It was written on the same stationery I had used. The same smooth, off-white paper. The same faintly embossed edges.

At first, it was sweet.

“I got your letter. Thank you, my love. It means more to me than you know.

You always know how to make me smile. Always. “

For a moment, I felt a rush of warmth.

But then I read the next line.

“I need you to listen carefully. This is important.

I don’t know who has been coming home to you every night.

But it isn’t me.”

I froze.

I felt the ghost of a shudder ripple through me, forcing myself to keep reading, my hands suddenly clammy against the paper.

“I haven’t left the office in months.

I don’t know what’s happened, I don’t know how. But something is pretending to be me.	“

I let the paper slip from my fingers.  
  
I sat there, staring at the letter in my hands, my breath coming slow and uneven. The words blurred in front of me, my mind scrambling for any rational explanation.

It had to be a joke. A cruel, elaborate prank. Someone at Daniel’s office must have found my letter, copied his handwriting, and sent this back to mess with me. Maybe even Daniel himself, though I didn’t understand why he’d do something so strange.  
  
Yet still, my skin prickled with unease.

I forced a laugh under my breath, shaking my head.

It was absurd. Completely ridiculous.

Still, when I heard him stir in the bedroom, when I heard the faint sound of sheets rustling and the floor creaking under his weight, something in me hesitated. Just for a moment.

I folded the letter, slipped it back into the envelope, and shoved it into my purse before heading to the kitchen to make coffee, trying to shake off the unease.  
  
I walked into the kitchen and reached for the matches. We had one of those old gas stoves, the kind where you had to turn the knob and light the burner yourself. It had been finicky for years, sometimes requiring two or three tries before the flame would catch.  
  
By the time Daniel walked into the kitchen, rolling his shoulders and rubbing a hand through his hair, I had convinced myself that I was being ridiculous.

""Morning,"" he murmured, pressing a quick kiss to my temple.

I twisted the knob, and the familiar hiss of gas filled the air. The smell was sharp, pungent, but I struck the match anyway, letting the tiny flame flicker to life between my fingers.

Then, with a quick motion, I brought it to the burner.

The fire flared up instantly.

A small whoosh of heat, a soft burst of orange and blue as the gas finally caught. The kitchen was filled with the quiet crackle of the flame settling, the warmth spreading outward.

And that’s when, for some reason, Daniel flinched. Not just a small, startled twitch, but a sharp, full-body jerk. His shoulders tensed, his hands curled slightly at his sides, and for a fraction of a second, his eyes weren’t on me.

""You okay?"" I asked casually, glancing at him over my shoulder.

He blinked, the stiffness in his body vanishing as quickly as it had come.  
  
""Yeah,"" he said, his voice smooth. ""Just spaced out for a second.""

I searched his face, his movements, the little details of him, the way his lips felt warm against my skin, the familiar sound of his bare feet padding against the tile, the casual way he leaned against the counter as he took his first sip of coffee.

This was Daniel. My husband.

I was letting my imagination get the best of me.

But still…

""Hey,"" I said, forcing my voice to sound light, teasing. ""You didn’t leave me a love letter back, huh?""

He raised an eyebrow, mid-sip. ""Love letter?""

I hesitated. ""The one I left at your office.""

For a split second, just a fraction of a moment, his expression didn’t change. Then, too quickly, he smiled. ""Oh. Yeah, sorry, I meant to say something. That was really sweet.""

I forced myself to smile. ""Did you like it?""

""Of course,"" he said, taking another sip of coffee. ""Best part of my day.""

I nodded, pretending to be satisfied with his answer.

But I knew he was lying.

If he had actually read the letter, he would have said something about the inside jokes, about the memories I’d written down, about any of the personal details that made the letter special. That’s what he had always done. Some of our inside jokes were played simply because he had mentioned them so much, and he loved it when I brought them up myself.

I swallowed hard, glancing down at my phone. Work. I had to get to work. I had to let this go.

That evening, we sat on the couch watching TV, just like we always did.

The warmth of his body was familiar, his arm draped lazily over the back of the couch, fingers grazing my shoulder. To anyone else, it would have seemed perfectly normal, perfectly safe.

But the letter sat heavy in my purse, the words echoing in my head.

I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

So, after a while, I turned to him with a grin, keeping my voice light. ""Hey, remember when we first met?""

He blinked, caught off guard.

""You’re testing me?"" he asked, laughing softly.

""Maybe,"" I teased, nudging his arm. ""Come on, you better remember.""

He smirked, tilting his head like he was thinking. ""It was in college, right? Second year?I remember these things, you know this. June 28th""

I felt my chest tighten.

My husband was forgetful with dates, that much I knew. But I knew this specific date was important to him. In fact, it was such an important date, he’d inked it into his skin.

I forced out an exaggerated gasp, smacking his arm playfully. “Of course you remember!”  
  
He didn’t glance down. He didn’t laugh. He just smiled at me.

Now I knew for certain, that this wasn’t my husband. Tomorrow, I had to get out.  
  
The next morning, I did everything exactly the same. I woke up before him, brewed the coffee, kissed him on the cheek, and told him I had a long day ahead. He smiled at me like always, a perfect, effortless thing, the way he always had. He ran a hand through his dark hair, sipped his coffee, and told me to have a good day.

But as I grabbed my purse and stepped outside, I forced myself not to hesitate. I drove the same way I always did, following my morning route, taking the usual turns, sticking to routine just in case. But once I was out of sight of the house, I turned in the opposite direction. Instead of heading toward my office, I drove straight to Daniel’s law firm, gripping the steering wheel so tightly my fingers ached.

I don’t know exactly what I was expecting. Maybe to walk into the building, see him at his desk, laughing with his coworkers, proving that this was all just some elaborate misunderstanding. That the letter had been a joke, a mistake, something stupid and explainable. Maybe I wanted to see the normality of his workspace, to remind myself that the man who came home to me every night really was my husband.

But deep down, I already knew that wouldn’t happen.

The receptionist looked up at me from behind the desk.

""Hi,"" I said, forcing a smile.""I’m just dropping by to see my husband.""

The woman’s brows knitted together slightly, and for a moment, she just looked at me, as if I had said something confusing, something she couldn’t quite make sense of. Then, after a beat, she gave me a small, gentle smile, one I immediately hated.

""What’s your husbands name?."" she said, her gaze fixed on the monitor in front of her.  
  
“Daniel.” I muttered  
  
“Oh, honey…"" she said softly. “He hasn’t been here in weeks.”

The words felt like a slap.

My breath stalled in my throat, my heart stuttering violently against my ribs.

My fingers tightened around the strap of my purse. ""What do you mean? That’s uhm.. there has to be some mistake. He works here. He comes in every day.""

The receptionist’s face shifted slightly, uncertainty flickering behind her eyes. She hesitated, then let out a slow breath. ""I… I’m sorry, but no one’s seen him in a long time. We thought maybe he took another job and just never told us. His things are still here, but…"" She shook her head. ""I really don’t think he’s been in.""

Something in me felt like it was folding in on itself. My vision narrowed slightly, as if the entire world had tilted sideways and I was struggling to stay upright.

""Can I… can I see his office?"" I asked.

The receptionist gave me another uncertain glance but nodded. She led me down the hallway, past the rows of desks, past the open offices where people typed away at their computers, where conversations hummed in the background. All of it normal. All of it completely detached from the fact that something in my life had cracked open into something monstrous.

We stopped in front of a locked storage room.

She hesitated, placing a hand on the handle, as if she wasn’t sure she should be showing me this. Then, in a quiet voice, she said, ""His things are still inside. We thought he just quit one day and never told anyone.""

My stomach felt hollow.

The woman turned the knob, and the door creaked open.

Inside, everything was untouched.

His work bag sat on the chair, the strap slightly askew, like he had tossed it there with the intention of picking it up again soon. His coat hung on the wall, neatly pressed, not a single sign of dust or age. On the desk, a pile of unopened mail sat undisturbed.

I stepped forward slowly, the air thick around me, pressing down on my shoulders like a weight I couldn’t shake.

And then I saw it.

A single sheet of paper, placed neatly in the center of the desk.

My name written on the top.

My hands shook as I reached for it.

The moment I touched it, I knew.

The handwriting was his.

“If you’re reading this, I’m still here.

Something else took my place. It knows everything I know. It acts like me. But it isn’t me.

I don’t know how long I have. I messed with something I shouldn’t have.

It’s afraid of fire.

I love you.”

My vision blurred slightly. I wanted to collapse, to let the panic finally crash over me, to break down the way my body was begging me to.

But I didn’t.

Because now, I knew.

It wasn’t about understanding what had happened. It wasn’t about figuring out where Daniel had gone or what had taken his place.

It was about stopping it.

I folded the note carefully, sliding it into my pocket.

Then, without another word, I turned and walked out of the office.

I wasn’t going to run.

I was going to burn it alive.  
  
The house was dark when I pulled into the driveway, its windows staring back at me like empty eyes. The porch light was on, casting a soft glow across the steps, and for a split second, everything looked normal.

But the moment I stepped inside, I knew.

It was waiting for me.

It stood in the center of the living room, perfectly still, its hands resting at its sides. The expression on its face was one of casual curiosity, but there was something wrong with it, something in the way the corners of its mouth stretched just a little too wide, the way its eyes followed me without blinking.

""Where have you been?"" it asked.

Daniel’s voice.

I forced a smile, shrugging as I shut the door behind me. ""Nowhere important.""

It didn’t respond right away. It just watched.

The air felt heavy, thick with the weight of what I knew was coming. Every instinct in my body screamed at me to run, but I didn’t. I couldn’t.

I had to see this through.

So I walked past it, moving toward the kitchen, my pulse hammering against my ribs.

Its head turned slightly as I moved.

""You’re acting different tonight,"" it murmured.

I laughed softly, keeping my voice light. ""Long day.""

The thing smiled at that.  
  
I clenched my jaw, pushing down the growing nausea curling in my stomach. I couldn’t let it sense my fear.

Not yet.

I made it to the kitchen without breaking my stride. The bottle of whiskey was already within reach, sitting on the counter where we always kept it.

I grabbed it.

The thing’s smile didn’t falter, but something changed.

A shift in its posture. A slight tilt of the head.

And then, in a voice that was almost concerned, it asked, ""What are you doing?""

I didn’t answer.

I unscrewed the cap.

Turned the bottle over.

And poured.

Dark liquid splashed across the floor, soaking into the old wooden panels, spreading in uneven puddles toward the living room. The smell of alcohol filled the air, sharp and potent.

The thing’s expression finally faltered.

Its voice darkened. ""Stop.""

I didn’t.

I reached into my pocket and pulled out the lighter.

The click of the flint wheel sounded deafening in the silence.

A single flame flickered to life.

The thing’s mouth twisted into something unnatural. I couldn’t help but flinch.

""You don’t want to do that,"" it said softly.

But I did.

I flicked my wrist.

Dropped the flame.

And the fire erupted.

The fire surged forward, swallowing the floor in hungry waves, licking up the walls with greedy fingers. It rushied outward, creeping up anything in sight. Heat exploded against my skin, and in the middle of it all, the thing screamed.  
  
In rage.

Its body convulsed, twisting violently, as if something beneath the surface was trying to break free. Its skin peeled away in strips, revealing something underneath that wasn’t flesh.

Blackened appendages stretched, elongating, writhing like smoke. Its hands curled into a strange amalgamation of shapes and colors, skeletal in nature, but not quite. The suggestion of a head buckled and cracked, folding in on itself, the remnants of its features disassembling like shattered porcelain.

It lunged at me.

I stumbled backward, barely dodging as one of its limbs whipped toward me, missing by inches. The fire spread fast, swallowing the walls, curling around the windows, devouring the curtains. The heat was unbearable now, choking the air, stealing my breath.

The house was collapsing, I turned and ran.

I didn’t stop, not when the walls groaned and cracked, not when the ceiling above me shuddered. The front door was only a few steps away - I could make it.

Behind me, the thing was still screaming.

But I didn’t look back.

I threw myself outside, hitting the pavement hard, rolling onto my side, gasping for air as the heat roared behind me.

I lifted my head just in time to see the roof cave in, flames bursting through the structure, sending embers flying into the night. The fire consumed everything, turning my home into nothing more than a funeral pyre for whatever had taken Daniel’s place.

And the thing inside kept screaming.

Until finally -

Silence.  
  
For a long time, all I could hear was the fire.

The flames hissed and crackled, devouring what was left of my home, filling the air with thick, choking smoke. The heat pulsed against my skin even from a distance.

I sat there on the pavement, my chest heaving, my fingers digging into the ground. My body ached from the fall, my lungs burned from the smoke.

Movement.

A shuffling sound, barely audible over the roar of the fire. My stomach clenched as I whipped my head toward the house, my breath catching in my throat.

A shadow was moving inside the flames.

Staggering.

I froze, unable to breathe, unable to move. My hands trembled as I pushed myself up onto my knees, my entire body bracing for whatever was coming.

But then, Daniel stepped forward.

His clothes were scorched, his face smeared with soot, his hair a mess of ash and sweat -but his eyes. His eyes were his. The same warm brown that I had memorized a thousand times over. 

My real husband, I could tell at a glance. 

He took one more shaky step before his knees buckled, his body giving out, collapsing onto the pavement.

I barely had time to think before I was running to him, my heart hammering against my ribs, my hands grabbing his shoulders, his arms, his face.

Tears blurred my vision as I cupped his face, my fingers trembling against his skin. I swallowed back the sob choking my throat, forcing my voice to be steady.

For a moment, neither of us said anything. His breath was weak, barely there. My grip on him tightened, desperation clawing at my chest.

But then, he smiled.

""College,"" he rasped. ""First-year orientation. Sarah introduced us."" His voice hoarse but sure. ""You were wearing that ugly red sweater.""

A sob broke from my lips.

I pulled him against me, burying my face into the crook of his neck, sobbing against his skin, clutching him like if I let go, he would disappear again. His arms were weak, but he wrapped them around me anyway, holding on with everything he had left.

The house burned behind us.

The doctors said it was a miracle.

Minor burns. Smoke inhalation. Nothing worse.

I sat beside his hospital bed, my fingers wrapped tightly around his. His hand was warm, solid, his. Every so often, my grip would tighten, just to make sure he was still there.

And every time, he would squeeze back.

The first time he woke up, he turned his head toward me, his eyes heavy with exhaustion but clear.

""Hey,"" he murmured, voice hoarse.

I smiled, even as my eyes stung with unshed tears. ""Hey.""

His lips curved into a small, tired smile. ""You look like hell.""

A laugh tumbled from my throat, shaky and genuine. ""Yeah, well,"" I sniffed, swiping at my eyes. ""So do you.""",1,1739471765.0,CreepsMcPasta,1,0.67,False
1ioq0hn,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ioq0hn/my_ex_32f_broke_up_with_me_41m_because_she_felt/,"My ex (32F) broke up with me (41M) because she felt ""unsure about the relationship from the start"". How do I cope with this feeling of complete loss and confusion over her reasons? And how do I let go of being angry that she wasn't honest from the start?","My ex and I dated since June 2023 and broke up in December 2024. We met on a dating app and got exclusive seven months later (I asked her to be exclusive more than once and she eventually agreed).

Throughout the relationship, she often behaved as if she were still single and/or treating me like a guy friend instead of a boyfriend (my friend would say that she was not giving me ""relationship-y respect""). Sometimes, her behavior around other guys made me think she was a bit naive about what was appropriate to do when you're in a relationship (ex. I wouldn't feel comfortable grabbing a coffee with someone I once hooked up with without speaking with my partner first. She on the other hand had no issues with doing that and only told me about it because one of her girlfriends recommended so.).

On several occasions, she said things like, ""I want to apply for this job that will see me in a different country for several months a year"" or ask me, ""Are our personalities compatible?"" One time even, she told me about her therapy sessions and said that all she talked about was how ""different we were"" and wanted direction from her therapist on ""what to do next and how long to stick it out"". All of this obviously made me feel very insecure and unsafe in the relationship (if that makes sense).

We did have our disagreements and didn't see eye-to-eye on some things, but overall I really enjoyed her company and loved her very much. When she ended things, all she said was she was unsure about us and didn't feel as confident about us as I was.

When I called her a month later for closure, all she did was reiterate that she was unsure about us from the start, but didn't say anything because she wanted us to work. However, after a full year of being exclusive, she was still unsure and she didn't think it was fair for me if she stuck around. I spoke to my therapist about this and his response was, ""You dated an emotionally immature person who wasn't able to meet your needs. She's still waffling around and figuring herself out, while I've already done that and looking for solid commitment. There's no reason why she couldn't tell you early on that she was unsure and afford you the option of leaving or talking things out.""

After all of the above, I still love/miss her and I'm angry at myself for feeling this way. How do I just let it go and accept that she wasn't my person and that her behavior would've ended things no matter how much I tried to be the 'perfect' partner?

**TL;DR:** I can't get over my ex, even though her behavior seems to have doomed the relationship and there's no other outcome that could've been reached. I also feel like this whole ""unsure"" response was an excuse and it's left me feeling perplexed and confused.",1,1739471733.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

Section 2: Potential Future Valuation (Local & Self-Sufficient Economy)		
		
Once the community prioritizes local production and self-sufficiency, prices and values will stabilize. Items made, grown, or crafted within the community will have more predictable pricing.		
	•	Locally grown and homemade food will have stable values due to predictable supply.
	•	Services will be worth more in trade as skills become more necessary.
	•	Imported goods will be devalued, reducing dependency on outside sources.
		
For now, all prices will remain equal to their market-based values, but over time, the community will vote to adjust values based on supply, demand, and sustainability.		
		
Final Summary: How This Destroys the Dollar’s Power		
	•	We remove the dollar symbol and trade in pure value.
	•	No inflation. No taxes. No banks.
	•	Trade remains fair because the value system is transparent.
	•	As local production increases, outside reliance decreases, making the community stronger.
	•	The power of the dollar fades as it is no longer needed for exchange.
		
Next Steps:		
	•	Try the system for one week using these values.
	•	Adjust based on community feedback.
	•	Encourage self-sufficiency to lower trade costs.

My mum basically pushed me into getting a trade just to fall back on incase the farm ever went downhill. I always liked the more practical subjects at school so I thought why not give joinery a go. The first few months on my course were ok but I wasn’t sure if I had made the correct choice. I persevered and slowly started to gain more confidence in making the basic joints. On the lead up to Christmas my tutor let us all make a small coffee table what we could take home. I asked if I paid for some oak would I be able to take it into college and have a go at a slightly more complex table with a drawer. He was all for the idea and actually ended up sourcing me the oak himself so shoutout to martin for that if you ever somehow end up reading this😆 Over the next few weeks he helped me make this and I was so happy with it in the end. I managed to make it just in time for Christmas and took it home to wrap up as my mums Christmas present (btw table sized boxes are very hard to keep hidden😆)She was over the moon and it’s still going strong next to her bed 9 years later.

1iopu5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceclones/comments/1iopu5g/my_fragrance_journey_a_chronological_review/,My Fragrance Journey: A Chronological Review,"I’ve always had a passion for collecting things. It started with watches, then evolved into sneakers, but eventually, both collections reached a point of saturation. So I found this. I started my fragrance journey last October. Even though I had some fragrance in the past it's all gifted to me like some random brand Carlo. I never really bought anything for myself. My first blind buy was **Afnan 9pm**, and since then, my collection has grown to over 10 fragrances and 10+ designer samples. And most of the designer fragrances don't justify the price tag. So I will stick with dupes for a while.

I made a review of the scents I bought in chronological order.

**1. Afnan 9pm:** This was my first purchase, and I loved the sweet scent and the presentation. I wore it frequently, especially to work, but noticed longevity issues. It doesn’t seem to last long on my skin, and I’ve almost emptied the bottle. (Frequent usage) 7/10

**2. Rasasi Fattan:** I bought this because I liked Terre d’Hermès. Very woody smell. Little overpriced and don’t feel like keeping it even though it smells similar to OG. So I sell it to my friend. But after some time I think its performance becomes better. (I made a decant) 6/10

**3. Rasasi Hatem:** Nothing much to say. I needed a fresh scent after selling Fattan, and this fit the bill. It’s a simple, citrusy fragrance that I bought at a great price. 6.5/10

**4. Lattafa Khamrah:** This fragrance turned my curiosity into an addiction. The sweet, cinnamon-vanilla combo is fantastic, and it was the first scent that earned me compliments. This one made me realize what a strong scent meant to be. 9/10

**5. Lattafa Fakhar Black:** I loved the ysl y EDP. So I researched and found out the clone. It smells very similar. But I sometimes smell some rotten egg in the initial notes(similar happened to me with Aqua di Gio). However, it dries down to a pleasant, aromatic scent. 7/10

**6. Khamrah Qahwa:** I couldn’t decide between this and the original Khamrah, so I bought both. And, I prefer Qahwa over the OG. The coffee note is prominent, and it reminds me of my favorite childhood candy. Initially, the performance wasn’t great, but after maceration, it’s now on par with the original. Currently my favorite winter scent .10/10

**7. Rasasi Hawas Ice:** I searched for a very good lasting fresh and the hype got me. I blindly bought this based on the hype, and my first impression was disappointing. However, after letting it sit for two weeks, it transformed into a long-lasting, fruity freshie. It’s now one of my top fresh fragrances .9/10

**8. Maison Alhambra Vicoriso Nero:** I had a sample of Invictus Victory and hoped this would be a good dupe. But, it didn’t live up to expectations. The scent and performance were poor, and I’ll be having second thoughts with Maison Alhambra in the future. 3/10

**9. Lattafa Ameer Al Oudh Intense Oud:** Another blind buy, but it turned out well. I often layer it with Khamrah, and the combination is magical. The smokiness and oud add depth to the sweetness, making it more mass-appealing. For that reason, I can give a higher rating.7/10

**10. Lattafa Liam Grey:** I bought this for a friend but couldn’t resist trying it myself. It reminds me of spiced tea. While it’s not my style, I appreciate its uniqueness. Extremely strong and long-lasting. 7.5/10

**11. Afnan Thurathi Blue:** The last and most favorite summer fragrance in my collection. The top citrusy notes from the first spray punctured my nose and I loved it. After some maceration, it becomes even better. Now it is long-lasting and more refreshing .10/10

My fragrance journey has been a mix of hits and misses, but it’s been rewarding. I’ve learned a lot about my taste and the importance of maceration and layering. In the future, I plan to explore more designer fragrances and refine my collection. If you have any questions or recommendations, feel free to ask!

Researchers employed a novel diagnostic method called Adaptive Force (AF) to assess neuromuscular function. They then administered a personalized pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy targeting the C7/T1 spinal region. Post-treatment, the patient experienced significant improvements in muscle strength and a complete resolution of symptoms within a day.

""The symptoms intensity improved immediately 1-day post-treatment and sustained until now (6-month post-treatment; [Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9874300/#F1)). The day after treatment she gave feedback (e-mail; translated): “I woke up this morning for the first time since months without a feeling of hangover. I don't have headache; my head feels broad and open (…). An incredible feeling. I don't have any nausea, I feel as 1,000 kg burden were removed from my body. I feel totally easy and energetic. I had no problems to fall asleep yesterday and slept through without melatonin pills. This morning I got out of bed without any difficulties, directly felt like doing Yoga and went for a bicycle trip.” She also felt like having “drunk 10 cups of coffee. I don't know where to go with my energy. It almost feels uncomfortable since my body is so twitchy.” It appears that the treatment led to sympathetic hyper activation. However, this adverse unanticipated reaction dissolved the next day.""

Switched to the generic for Vyv 60mg, and it chilled me out/made me sleepy, but zero help with task initiation, distractions, executive function, etc. Doc went ahead and upped it to 70 a week ago and it’s the same as 60 except I have been kinda sad and when I went to Walmart yesterday for groceries, it was like my head was spinning I was so overstimulated and distractible that I got upset. Like there was so much going on that I didn’t even know where to look. I’m getting zero done at home.

With all the recent talk about buying Canadian, I thought it would be helpful to break down what these labels actually mean, since there's been some confusion. Here's what you need to know:

**""Product of Canada""** (The Gold Standard):

* At least 98% of the total direct costs were incurred in Canada
* Basically means it's as Canadian as maple syrup (well, actual Canadian maple syrup)
* If something's 100% Canadian, they can explicitly state that

**""Made in Canada""** (The Silver Medal):

* Minimum 51% of production costs happened in Canada (but less than 98%)
* Usually comes with a qualifier like ""Made in Canada with imported parts""
* Still needs to have had its ""last substantial transformation"" happen here (think: turning ingredients into a finished pizza)

**Other Common Labels You'll See:**

* ""Assembled in Canada with foreign parts""
* ""Roasted and blended in Canada"" (for coffee)
* ""Packaged in Canada""
* ""Refined in Canada"" (for stuff like sugar)
* ""Distilled in Canada"" (for water)

**Pro Tip:** Just because you see a maple leaf on something doesn't automatically make it Canadian. Companies need to meet the ""Made in Canada"" standards to slap our beloved leaf on their products.

**Fun Fact:** Companies can face fines up to $10M for first-time violations of these labeling rules. They take this stuff seriously!

Edit: Since some people are asking - yes, you can have a Canadian-made product from a foreign company. Example: Lay's chips are made in Cambridge, ON with Canadian potatoes and workers, but PepsiCo owns them. Whether that counts as ""buying Canadian"" is up to you!

TL;DR: ""Product of Canada"" = 98%+ Canadian. ""Made in Canada"" = 51%+ Canadian. Everything else = varying degrees of Canadian involvement that they have to specify.

I am a SAHM with a three year old boy and have a nanny for medical reasons (I suffered a miscarriage, ivf, and am now 7 months pregnant, with a healthy although difficult pregnancy due to first trimester bleeding/bed rest and several viral illnesses). My doctor has instructed me to avoid picking up my son. We have had a nanny two days a week since my son was five months old (to give me time to do housework/batch cooking/or get out). This nanny has been wonderful, but in the past year she is taking tons of time off. Six weeks last summer and she's already taken off a month's worth of work days in 2025...mostly just for vacations but recently for sickness. She was very pushy about requesting sick pay, which we have given her in the past, but I thought was pretty audacious considering she's barely worked for us this year. Homepay would not allow her to enter the sick pay or us to enter it because it says that she has not accrued enough hours this year to warrant it. But she says that her pay stub stays she has 37 hours accrued that have rolled over from last year. I'd appreciate some advice on how to deal with this. 

  
After my miscarriage, we got another nanny for wed-fri to allow me to recover, and once I started ivf, make all my appointments, and help me when I could not be physically active due to procedures. The second nanny was a total dud. I should have fired her early on but I was desperate for help and in a bad place mentally so I kept trying to fix things...basically no matter what I provided her with she just wanted to watch tv with my son, and avoided going outside even in good weather. We have a pool next door and I think she took him once, at my insistence. She was constantly sleeping on the job. Feeding my son junk food without my permission. Making and leaving huge messes for me to clean. Also tried to convert me to the Jehova's Witness faith. I had several conversations with her and she would improve for a few days and then it would be the same all over again. I (nicely) let her go and put my son in preschool, where he was thriving, but then I got pregnant again and he was constantly sick. I got covid twice, something unknown, rsv, and I couldn't take it anymore. During this time I also had to be on bedrest for a hematoma. We decided to take him out of school for the remainder of my pregnancy, and it was such short notice we hired on the old nanny as a stop gap. She continued to be useless, until she walked out one day when my son wouldn't nap (the first time this has ever happened, and the only time I ever left her to sort him out herself). I was left with no help and started looking for a new nanny. Got ghosted on phone calls, a first day no show, and a temporary nanny that yelled at me within five minutes of meeting me for not having a filtered water for her (I had offered her coffee, tea, seltzer etc. but nothing was to her liking). Mind you we are paying the rate the nanny names, with PTO, sick leave etc. we are not cheap. She also brought her daughter with her...I told her we were staying home due to repeated illness during my pregnancy and she pushed us to go to an indoor playground...where we all got norovirus within hours. She left sick before lunch, and left me in the lurch. I was so ill I had to go to the hospital for iv hydration. 

Finally, we interviewed a nanny who did not sound insane. She has many years experience, returned our calls, showed up etc. And she is better than the rest...but I feel like I have to keep careful tabs on the situation or it devolves into tv watching, bribing with candy etc., not following through with timeouts so that after a few days my son is acting up. But there are also many good things about her, she is good humored, timely, reliable, available, has tried to do activities with my son, but has been discouraged by his disinterest. I do think this will improve when the weather is better because she is eager to take him out to the park and pool. I don't want to lose her. But I have to constantly have to reiterate the rules around here and somehow they are flouted. After my past experience I am reluctant to keep looking, because I know it can be worse...

I'm at my wits end with this situation. I wish I were well enough to do everything myself. I don't think I'm being picky. I just want my son to have some structure (limits on tv, unhealthy food, timeouts for unacceptable behavior), and to maintain the cleanliness of my house as is. Nothing crazy. I'm tired of paying good money and feeling taken advantage of. ",4,1739470712.0,NannyEmployers,7,1.0,False
