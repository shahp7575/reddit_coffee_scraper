And: considering Epigenesis in the Glirarium; the lessons we learn of turning Dinosaurs into Chickens and back again.","# III, ID. DUODECEM. APPROACHING THE IDES OF TERMINUS; FINAL FULL MOON OF THE FINAL MONTH OF THE ROMAN LUNAR YEAR.

Where were we? Oh, that’s right: our disagreement on Artificial Intelligence; my linguistic definition of it as to describe the surface-layer or scum on the surface of a society which perpetuates various false notions (and if not Artificial Intelligence then what is the word for it?), versus their definition of the promise of “amazing computer software (porn and things)” – well I don’t know, if we’re looking at asteroid mining or deep space projects then we’ve had the technological capacity in computer systems to accomplish all of this since the 1960’s; and have done basically nothing with it, whilst we reached the comparative quantum level with the early Dell desktops one found in school libraries. You see how the premise for “we need better computers” is a non-starter right off the bat when considering the utilities of this shit; my opinion, reader, is that this society is a collection of slavering morons who seek to find a work-around for being so lazy and dumb. That is: is not the want for technology to enable people to accomplish things, but the want for people in the first place – consider the telephone and text messaging, how as we possessed the ability to have rapid communication we fostered a culture of “not bothering to reply” and “thinking that replying quickly was a social faux pas” meaning that despite the novel notion of useful technologies “changing the world” that after they arrive the Human proves feckless in utilizing the thing:

The notion is that “if XYZ is introduced” that the Human will change for the better, whereas I argue there is no means to accomplish this other than a reasonable education in fairly advanced grammar which our governments in the 1970’s worked very hard to destroy and of which the general population, always being a fairly dumb bunch in need of a good kicking, had always considered beneath them.

Alright, but let us consider; as I mean to do here, the notion of this work-around; to create super-smart robot governors to administer to a population of irrational losers who wish to maintain a very low intellectual calibre amongst themselves – to create a new cyborg class to pick up the slack. Well, okay. I cannot say I am against this but I think it is very unlikely that such a society 1) can, and 2) would treat the cyborgs any different than they treat ordinary persons who advise them not to do stupid things and call them idiots when they do, and so on.

In reality: the truth is that the further one goes up the ladder in our society today, and this seems to have been the case for several centuries, the more mentally retarded people you encounter in those important positions; not to add even the criterion of obvious mental illness to those persons, rather: in easily demonstrable manners of poverty of speech, subsequent inability to reason, the track record of such persons laughable failures abroad and at home for decades (if not centuries), economic mismanagement added to that, and that therefore the “premise” of “we need super smart \[punch card computers yesterday, now quantum cyborg today\] to manage this stuff” is entirely dissonant; “intellect” is not wanted in England or America or in any society which wishes to maintain one or more irrational precepts any more so than Jesus was wanted by the Jews, or Mohammed was wanted by the Christians or Gaius Julius Caesar or President Kennedy were wanted by their respective Senates, and, indeed, any manner of addressing the myriad profligacies of our people in our part of the world has been shunned by us for millennia – with only brief blips of Strong Man dictatorships to correct some of the ills albeit temporarily and it is always ‘violent Strong Man’ only so because actually forcing through changes on such matters involves kicking the chief opposition to death who have been acting to impede peaceful reformation or even discussion of the subjects themselves.

One may think what they like about this, my question is:

Would a cyborg government or a robot patriarch, then, be somehow the exception to the rule of this? If so, how so? I am curious to hear real cases made ‘for’ this thing rather than the tamagochi “wow!” advertising that my people are so fucking fond of substituting for proof-based reasoning. Would Saddam Hussein or the Israel Lobby relent to the ICC demands and surrender themselves if the demands were made by a clunky robot spinning around on motorized treads and throwing off sparks rather than a Man? Obviously not. So we are still back to the same non-starter as this pertains to every matter that “super smart robots” are supposedly going to solve.

You see why I reverted to the study of the mind and physiology, reader, in determining the Cause and Solution for such problems; as the overt or surface-layer thrown over a matter tends to speak to nothing of the true motivation at the core of the being – to address nominal claims produces little outcome when the individual is motivated by some secret ulterior thing and his nominal claims only exist to conceal those motivations.

Anyway, let’s talk about something more important,

# THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EPIGENESIS OF GLIS GLIS ETRURIS, or: DAY FIFTY SIX IN THE BIG BROTHER MOUSE HOUSE

I seem set on the idea of transferring the Mice into a larger enclosure; it has been almost sixty days since their Winter incarceration in an insulated heated tube, and although I have not really had any success in finding something with the right dimensions for them – cages for very very small Mice are beyond the range of the present day’s commercial capacity apparently, and I am leaning more towards a wide aquarium with a gauze covering for the roof; largely to show them off under my coffee table.

More interesting is the experiment ‘of’ placing them from one into the other and I have an idea to give them a sort of liberty experience; to damage the tube in such a way that they might be able chew a hole or escape in some way, that they might credibly “believe” they are free as they emerge into a larger luxurious environment which should seem to them large enough and “like the world under the floorboards” so as their “escape” may pass credibly to them as a true feat of autonomy on their part.

I am very curious as to how the time in confinement over the Winter will play out socially in a much larger enclosure – will they not want to hang out with each other anymore and make burrows on opposite ends? That would be hilarious. I think, however, that my proximity hypothesis is going to be proven true; the physiology will be shaped – in the manner, I think, that Early Man ‘domesticated’ the Wild Dog, the Auroch, Dinosaur to Chicken, and so on, truly displaying in ancient in times a far greater grasp of the most formidable natural sciences of the breath of life as compared anyway to the crass and largely laughable efforts of lesser Men of our own times; turning Watermelons into Square Watermelons whilst their own population devolves before their eyes and their own bodies succumb to what is, I suppose, the effects of Epigenesis upon their own physiology; the mental and intellectual dulling from city-life, the impoverishment of the immune system from careless diet, and so on.

In the beginning there were two Mice named Hypnos and Thanatos; Sleep and Death, and from whence would come the nations of far-flung future-times.

But as we sit here, sipping on lukewarm coffee, it's clear that things haven't turned out as she'd hoped.

The conversation turns to the latest environmental policy rollbacks, and Jenna shakes her head, ""It's like we're moving backward,"" she says, her voice tinged with frustration. She tries to lighten the mood with a Doge meme, ""Much pollution, very sad,"" but the humor doesn't quite mask her concern.

Economic recovery was supposed to be a given, but instead, her parents' restaurant is struggling more than ever. The tax breaks seemed to bypass them entirely, favoring the big corporations. ""Guess we're all betting on Doge now,"" she quips, referring to the volatile cryptocurrency that's become a symbol of our times.

Then there's the social fabric of our community, fraying at the edges. Jenna's brother has faced increased hostility because of his sexual orientation, something she attributes to the divisive rhetoric coming from the top. She often uses Doge to comment on this, saying, ""Such divide, wow,"" highlighting the irony and sadness of it all.

Immigration, too, has become a personal issue for her. Her friend from Venezuela, who's been here on a work visa, now lives with the constant fear of deportation. Even the work of USAID seems less impactful, caught up in the political games at home rather than making a difference abroad.

Healthcare has been another disappointment. With no real reform, Jenna's family is feeling the pinch of rising costs. She sometimes jests, ""Got health issues? Better pray you've got some Doge coins,"" though there's little humor in her tone.

The political landscape has turned into a battleground, with little room for bipartisan agreement, making it hard to push forward on issues like education and infrastructure. Jenna's frustration is palpable; she's tired of the gridlock.

And then there's the chaotic approach to foreign policy, where decisions feel as unpredictable as the Doge meme economy. ""Much trade war, such instability,"" she comments, capturing the sense of whiplash we all feel.

Jenna confesses her regret, ""I voted for change, thinking it would lead to a better place. But here we are. I didn't see how it would tear us apart, hurt our planet, and leave small businesses like my folks' out in the cold."" Her regret has pushed her into local activism, using memes not just for laughs but to engage in deeper conversations about what policies really mean for people's lives.

Through this experience, Jenna's learned to look beyond the slogans, to see the long-term effects of policy, and to use her vote with more caution. It's been a hard lesson, but one she's sharing with a touch of humor, even if it's through the eyes of a Doge meme.",3,1739131324.0,OptimistsUnite,0,0.8,False

“I guess not,” he said with a tone of resignation.  “After all, it must be rough getting free money,” he quipped sarcastically.

She winked at him.  “It’s hard to be me.”

“You can always return the money,” he noted.  After a short pause, they both burst into laughter.  Returning to a more serious tone, he pondered what was going on.

“Is it really that mysterious?” she asked.  “I figured you of all people would understand.”

“So should I be threatened by him?”

She reassured him there as nothing to worry about.  “He’s way too young for me—he’s just a boy.  And he’s not nearly as rich as you,” she playfully added.

**A few days ago**



“What’s your PIN?” Steffi asked.  “I always forget.”

Being familiar with the routine, John recited his PIN to her.  She then proceeded to withdraw the maximum amount from his checking account as he watched helplessly.  She tried to do the same with his savings account, but was denied by the ATM.

“Oh, that’s a shame,” she said, noting the relatively high balance in the savings account.

“Maybe we can try again tomorrow,” he said, trying to minimize her disappointment.

In her mind, she already knew there would not be a next time.  “Let’s get some coffee,” she suggested. “We need to talk.”

Sitting together in the café, he appeared a bit nervous.  “What did you need to talk about?” he wondered.

She smiled at him to ease the tension.  “Can I see your wallet?”

Without hesitation, he handed her his wallet.  She opened it and quickly pulled out all his cash.  It appeared to be a few hundred dollars, but she didn’t bother to count it before putting it in her purse. She then unceremoniously placed the wallet on the table in front of him.

“John, we have to stop seeing each other,” she finally dropped the news.  “This is our last cashmeet.”

Blindsided by the announcement, he was confused and assumed he did something wrong.  He begged for an explanation.

“You knew this day was coming.”  She reminded him their arrangement would need to end when things became serious with Mark.  “Well, that day is now.”  She lifted her left hand to show off the diamond engagement ring on her finger.

“Please, Steffi…” he pleaded, being on the verge of tears.

“No, it wouldn’t be fair to Mark or you.”  She offered him some helpful, yet painful advice.  “Go date a nice girl.  Go lose your virginity.  And please don’t contact me again or I’ll have to block you.”  In an attempt to put him out of his misery, she stood up to finally leave.  “Goodbye, John.”",0,1739131204.0,paypigsupportgroup,0,0.4,False

I thought a sweet hot milk coffee would satiate me but it always gotta be some sweet food item baked or deep fried usually has butter/ghee/oil and flour, for example uncrustable, sweet wafer, biscotti...

2) Can these sweet cravings be just supressed until they no longer show up like without following the whole science based mechanism on how to not crave sweets, can I achieve success by just avoiding them long enough, this way will they ever just stop showing up?

Im gonna try my best to organize my thoughts but there’s a ton and I really need help.

im 18 male in my second semester of college. I go to a school that is rather expensive and quite far away. She always claims she’s worried about me even though I’ve never said or done anything to make her feel that way.

just after I left to college she said she would just sit in my room back home and stuff, which is kinda weird. She kept saying she missed me and all that, even though she doesn’t miss my older sister as much and still has my little sister at home.

during my first semester of college I had a few friends, most friendly people in my major weren’t in my classes, but I had a few people, they were all girls btw. Eventually that friend group fell apart, one of the girls started to bully me relentlessly and I left. The second girl stuck with the bully, but the other (we’ll call her Tina for now) stuck with me. Me and Tina hadn’t really talked a ton up until that point, but we were obviously friends. After the group split up me and Tina hung out almost everyday, we‘d get lunch, coffee, go to parties, go get dinners of campus, watch movies, and once she even cut my hair. I started to develop a crush on her and eventually feelings. The way I saw it was we were already super close, and she kept dropping hints and saying stuff that made it seem she felt the same way. Soon enough she finds a new group of friends and starts to leave me behind, I realize I might as well ask her out because I’m gonna loose her if I don’t, so I do. And lo and behold there’s been a secret long distance boyfriend this whole time.

 I realize I’ve been used for emotional cheating and cut her off entirely. I tell my mom and she starts freaking out about how I have no friends, which wasn’t true. And she even kept pressuring me to talk with those girls again and make amends. Even tho I was the one mistreated and abused.

‘that semester ends, I go home and my mom is still on about me going back to them. I tell her I don’t want to but she doesn’t listen to me. She’s also on this new kick about me having crippling social anxiety and that’s why I cant make friends. Even though I just wanted to finish that semester and try again next time, because by the time the whole Tina drama ended, it was like 2 weeks from winter break. So my mom’s making me watch these social anxiety videos, which okay fine. But they’re all about dealing with annoying coworkers and stuff, not being a kid in college.

i go back to school for the second semster, and would you believe I make new better friends right away, just like I said. Who would have thought I know something’s about myself more than my parents do, weird huh? But apparently that’s not enough for my mom, because she still wants me to talk with Tina and the other girls, which I refuse to do. She also wants me to become best friend with my roommate. me and my roommate rarely talk, we coexist but we’re not friends, I don’t care and neither does he. We never fight, we just ignore each other, that’s fine by me. My mom hates that and tries to get me to talk to him, even though I did before but he wasn’t responsive. So even after finding better friends that don’t use me and actually want me around, my mom still doesn’t think I’m doing things correctly. But now she’s also all about me getting a job, which I agree with. I tried and am still applying to most of the jobs I see. But I haven’t been very lucky, and she keeps blaming me saying I should have gotten one in the first semester even though I was doing a stage play to maintain a scholarship. And now she won’t get off my back about getting a job, but I’m trying to really hard.

and what just happened is the straw that broke the camels back.   


We need to have roommates figured out for housing next year by Monday, and I did. my one friend not in my major said we should room together, I said yes and he seemed all excited. We made those plans like 2 weeks ago. I texted him Friday asking if that’s still the plan but he says “oh yeah, I’m actually rooming with someone else.” So great. I know 2 days before our final plans are due that my plans haven’t matted for weeks, and my “friend” hasn’t had the basic courtesy to tell me. I scramble and ask all of my other friends what they’re doing, but all of their rooms are full and planned out. I did apply to be an RA so I need to pray that I get that job at this point. But i told my parents and of course my mom blames me again like it’s a natural instinct. She says I should have been confirming the housing plans with my friend all along, which I agree with, but it’s also not my fault that he canceled on me and didn’t tell me. It’s not my responsibility to figure that out, I should have been told that without having to pry the answer out of him. She then asked that dreaded question again of “are you sure your happy“ I finally snap and I yell. 

I say “YES! IM HAPPY HERE AND I WANT TO STAY! STOP ASKING THAT! IF I WASNT HAPPY I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU!” And she just tells me to stop getting upset. That got me mad. Why am I not allowed to be upset? when nothing goes right people get mad, my mom gets mad all the time, but apparently it’s not allowed for her son to get mad at her.

shes driving me crazy. I’m an adult and I cannot be treated like this anymore. I’m one more fight away from setting a boundary that says “if you ask if I’m happy at school, without any evidence that I’m not. I will hang up the phone and not talk to you for the rest of the day.” It’s harsh but it needs to be done. I don’t want or expect her to fix all my problems. I’m an adult I can do it myself. But there’s no doubt I’ll make mistakes along the way. And I have made many, but it’s the fact that she has never once said, to me, in her life “it’s okay. you're still growing, making mistakes is okay. Just learn from them. I believe in you.”

never once have I ever heard that, she always goes straight to blaming me for everything that’s outside of my control. i can’t keep fighting her anymore. She’s so stubborn and doesn’t give up. But then gets all upset and defensive when I don’t call her, even when I know it’ll just end in us yelling and me getting frustrated.

The situation with his kids is difficult and he doesn't see them that often. A few weeks ago, his son's mum messaged me and I met her for coffee. She said she wants him to start seeing his son again and we've arranged to meet at a soft play centre next Thursday. For now, she is supervising visits. But she's said that in the future that I can supervise visits and even have him overnight once they've built a father/son relationship and she's got to know me more. I don't currently live with my partner but I have a spare room while my partner lives in a house share so I have more space. I've never dated anyone with children before so I'm really nervous about meeting his son and I hope he likes me. I said that I was happy to be introduced as a friend for now, but she said she'll introduce me as daddy's girlfriend as she doesn't want to hide anything and that I'll be step-mum in the future.

*How many insolent failures must we experience in order to succeed? How many times must one gratuitous compound be dissolved away, only for two more properties as unclean as innermost thoughts to expose themselves in the mixture? With each solid reflection fermented in disagreeable solution, a billion microorganisms are suffered the throes of birth from the loins of a god that simply does not want them.*

Toad glowered downward in hatred at the sickly yellow brew that bubbled in a wastebin at his feet. Mild carbonation buzzed a funeral song. He stole a moment and fumed, the stench vile and unrelenting. It was in this putrid, pitiless moment after disposing of the night’s hard work, that revelation simmered in his mind but had yet to cross the threshold of his heart. He returned the overused pan to his stove and sunk into his armchair. *Billions of unseeable living characters sacrificed day in and day out and not even an ounce of fool’s gold to justify this practice.* He sat sullenly and an oft-recited verse came to mind.

*If all wishful thinkers completed the Great Work, gold would be valueless*

*If the desire for wealth turns lead into gold, all men would be alchemists*

There are very few who possess the cold steel within their gut, the sheer molten patience and viscous resolve it requires to turn *lead* into *gold* — a ridiculous and laughable proposition to the chemists of modernity with dull imaginations. Those attempting the Great Work must go above and below simple chemistry, simple philosophy — but rarely, if ever, do they taste the fruit of their moil. Nevertheless, Toad continues his work; ceremonial, byzantine processes and nightly affairs with feminine tinctures, varying ratios, conduit, essence, combinations, combinations, combinations. If each particle he tinkered with were a different human and his mission that of sexual conquest, Caligula himself could not rival Toad’s pansexual proclivities. But alas, he is always cut short of a climax; his concoctions fail him and are disposed of nightly with little remorse, rather the flagellation of facing one’s own failure.

Another verse came to mind.

*If you wish to change the nature of something, you may only change your relationship to it*

He sat with these words for several seconds, then glided from his silken armchair to the kneehole desk, taking a limonoid moment in between to open his shutters to the evening air. After settling, he poured himself into his journal.

*All my moons spent in towering, selfish recuse from the drudge of menial toil and peasant communion, wherein I offer many a detesting downward look-see from my tower, from the eye opposite my Great Work, never, till now, have I begun to see my placement as unrightful, unreasonable, and an ultimate failure. I have committed a murder. A murder of the very purpose of they who deserve this position.*

Toad read his own spewed thoughts once over, then twice, and again, and again, until a ninth time. He paused in absentminded contemplation, tapping his pen on each his opposite hand’s fingertips before pinpointing a thought with furled brow, then continued scrawling.

*Alas, were someone else given this tower, what knowledge have they to be in my stead? What congenital gift have they to complete the Great Work before me? None, says I! No man from any city nor village nor caravan has venerated himself to the Ether, nor staked claim in its prospect as have I. And for that, I am owed the position of the Ether itself!*

He looked up from his page suddenly, eyes narrowing. A large black Crow had been perched on his windowsill, staring blankly at him. As the two beings locked eyes, the Crow cocked its feathered head to a side, peering with noticeable skepticism. *God knows how long you’ve been there.* On a rash impulse, Toad flung his pen at the looming bird, which deftly stepped aside and dodged the projectile. The Crow looked out and downward at the fallen pen in mocking imitation, then back at Toad, again cocking its head to one side. Toad started from his seat, angrily and forcefully, knocking books from his desk. The Crow screamed menacingly. A sound of uncanny human rage, nearly rupturing Toad’s eardrums in the enclosed space and sending him to the floor. Toad bellowed a guttural curse and shot up again with ears singing. As he stormed toward the open window with murderous intent, the Crow exposed a threatening wingspan of five feet or maybe more, and within two flaps disappeared.

*Never have I set ablaze to a part of my own being in pursuit of calcined retribution. Never have I laid my own body to rest in destitute cast iron, nor have I, myself, drunk the frothing microbials of dissolution. I have dedicated my thoughts and actions entirely toward what material can offer me, and it is only now, in my heart’s most perplexed moments, reflecting on my defeat at the talons of a mere Crow, that I realize I must offer myself to the material world. If I wish to change the nature of something, I must change my relationship to it. I must change myself.*

A pondering glance upward at both nothing and everything cemented this notion in Toad’s small but growing mind as the singing in his ears reverberated and descended into silence save the evening breeze once again.

*If this is not God themself urging me, then who would? My ambition was wrought long before my birth. What strange subtle body has compelled me to this new rationale? My own supplication towards God surely has placed me in their favor.*

A meal of beef stewed in tomatoes and Persian spices sank into his stomach with coffee that sipped like dark matter in the night’s new moon. Spanish tobacco ritualized his time unspent in labor. *Labor.* He inhaled deeply and let the smoke out with a loud laugh at himself. The scream of the Crow tongued his ears’ memory as he smoked breathless. Toad distilled his thoughts into a plan. He was to awaken early the next day and ascend a nearby mountain while sunlight still bathed earth, gleaning hours that were once as wasted as his failed concoctions.

He knew of a path, carved by the people of the mountain centuries ago, that coiled in figure-eight around each protruding peak, but this path was well-worn by locals with homesteads along its sides, and the likelihood of wanderers who would pull at his attention. Instead, he would start at its basin but allow himself to stumble into nestled cavities of the surrounding forest that he had not yet seen*.* He was to retrieve a new set of materials to obsess over, and therefore a new insight into his Great Work.

The small flame of a suet candle waltzed in Toad’s peripheral, and the words of a great Alchemist soundlessly slipped from his mind.

*All our purification is done by fire, in fire, and with fire.*

In exchange of his nighttime liveliness for deep rest, he thrice recited his favored verse in written word.

*If all wishful-thinkers completed the Great Work, gold would be valueless*

*If the desire for wealth turns lead into gold, all men would be alchemists*

*All men would be alchemists*

*All men would be alchemists*

*All men would be alchemists*

*If*

*If*

*If*

He pinched the flicker between his middle finger and thumb and was scolded by darkness.

…

Toad shot awake from his desk, having bit his tongue while under, and spat out saliva and blood onto the pages he had scrawled the night before. He had dreamt of the ocean and its protean vastness. The anxious caws of Crows sounded through his still open window while he gathered himself in haste and bushy-tailed haze. It was midmorning, and he considered this limbo of time an exceptional condition for his prophesized duties. He broke fast with a usual tuft of bread he had purchased at the market days before, washed down with a cup of syrupy red wine to coat his insides. After filling a lambskin canteen with the rest of his wine, he folded himself into a specially chosen chartreuse robe, journal and pen in one pocket. A bollock knife and an empty sack would be all else he needed for his journey.

Toad began his ascension by locking the door to his ivory tower and trudging through the dusted streets of the village on route to the mountain. As he marched, he paid no mind to the merchants peddling pelts and furs that they had trapped with only their knowledge of the natural wild. The blacksmith who molded sturdy weaponry from hot, wet base-metal. The women who fermented and preserved crops that would otherwise spoil within days. The tailors who quilted large, detailed tapestries and dolmans with tiny threads and tiny tools. The children at play in the vacuum of work. Toad thought only of Gold and did not let his eyes roam much further than the ground in front of his determined feet.

Miles of land smelted under his soles, and Toad eventually came upon a wall of birch trees. *Took you long enough*. Beyond the canopy the earth sloped upward and trees ivied the mountain. He surveyed the dense thickets before him and spied a sliver that seemed to have been macheted to allow entrance. Toad seized a moment of calculation.

*How unusual. The salient path that the mountain-dwellers etched long ago is a half-mile North, and the surrounding forests are mysterious and inhospitable.* *Who is the bold soul who entered from here? A sign!*

A breath caught in his chest just before he entered the mysterious sliver, and the delayed exhale was an experience of sudden euphoria accented with his quickening heartbeat. Javelins of light tore through the treetops. Greens, browns, oranges, and grays of varying shade and hue scored the maze of bark and leaf and dirt and plant.  Everything in the forest danced and swayed and made subtle rhythmic sounds. Hisses, chirps and creaks embraced his nerves and entailed music. He smiled, wide-eyed, and the woods seemed to simper in return. A feeling of excitement, mania once dormant. *My God is a prodding one, I shall always allow myself to be prodded.*

Toad was no longer unsettled by the peculiar path that wormed deeper into wooded elysium as he followed. The land began to curve steeply underneath his feet and winged insects formed whirling miasmas around him as he scurried. Further upward into the mountain forest and the brambles and tree trunks began to thin. Ahead he could see a clearing. *Who all has touched these parts before me?*

He entered the clearing as though it were a fairy ring, and his steps took on rhythm. The ground in the clearing was covered with starchy bulbs protruding from the earth, each about the size of a crabapple, with a clouded orange color. Toad knelt and held one of the bulbs. He pulled, and it uprooted itself effortlessly as the soil caved in around it. He held it up for inspection. Hiding below the surface were folded flowers, stemming from the bulb-like roots that showed themselves opposite aboveground. The petals opened as he observed. The flowers were ethereal indigo, with green-yellow stigma and ovules. Toad pulled two more. Flowers. Using his knife, he cut the bulbs from their rootflowers and gently placed them in a pouch. *Thanks*. He did not notice the smaller bulb that he stepped on and burst with his heel while kneeling to take the loot.

Toad continued past the clearing, again through thick woods and unknown air. *What oddity will show itself next?* As he followed the path that seemed to already be carved out, he tripped over sudden awareness of living beings that he could see not with his eyes but feel with his nerves. He quickened his pace and checked over his shoulder, as even those with a purpose chosen by God must be careful along the way. Soon, he came upon a nurse log; large, felled and decaying, but with countless tiny lives born and raised and nurtured from it. He sat on the mothering wood and thought of himself as one of those tiny lives for a moment, then took out his journal and pen, in ponderance of a sequence of words pulled from the Emerald Tablet of the Thrice-Great Hermes themself.

*Its power is complete if turned towards earth, it will separate earth from fire, the subtle from the gross.*

Toad began poking.

*While in my mastering of the Seven Great Processes, I have never felt so ensured of my place as I do now. But what will become of the world when I reach my nirvana?  When God shines their radiant eyes on one man, darkness is bound to the world around him. Truths are not easily digestible. Will this equally sweet and bitter truth change more than just myself?*

A rumbling began to sound overhead. His eyes fell upward as hundreds of black bodies darted over the canopy above him, their shadows cast onto the forest floor at his feet, darkness rippling and jigging over earthly light. Hollering like soldiers going to war with the passion of righteous suicide. Toad ducked and his flesh tingled in response to the unsettling appearance and frightening power of the swarm. Once the Crows passed, he tucked away his writing material and continued, swiftly and self-aware.

The mountain grew steeper, and Toad climbed limestone ledges, the presence of which indicated that he was nearing the large and well-excavated mine of saltpeter, the supplier of gunpowder for the tribes and their conflicts. Thinking himself too sophisticated for war, he decided there was no need to enter it, to avoid an explanation of his mission, manner and garb to the tribesmen who occupied it. He tasted sweat on his upper lip and decided to seat himself on a ledge for a moment. Taking a gulp of wine from lambskin, he observed the canopy and terrain below him in slight. The sky was milky, and the sun through it neared deep red. Another sip of wine and Toad started up.

Trees thinned and gave way to brush and shrubbery. He followed a small path between large twin rock formations and spat at a burnt smell that filled his nostrils. Foliage became blackened and barren, the remnants of a wildfire. Toad surveyed the decimation, but he knew better than most the necessity of fire. He bent, filling a small pouch with ash, then kissed his fingertips and ran them across the ground before starting again. Somewhere, a Crow chirped approvingly at this gesture.

About a half mile of tall, suntanned grass and limestone flooring melted into an odd, soft black soil smattered with golden wildflowers. Toad’s mind wandered and chose no one style of terrain, much the same as the mountain whenever it felt like it ought to change or elaborate on itself. He stared at the soil as he moved, watching it fizzle and succumb under each bootstep. He felt a crunch and a Crow let out a yap from somewhere in the distance. Lifting his boot, he saw porous grey-white peeking through disturbed grainy black soil. Bones. Toad brushed away at the unnecessary soil and scooped up a small handful of small, slightly curved bones. Tiny riblets and peckers. He placed the bones into his sack and continued. More piles of bones began to show themselves to him, and he could not help but feel a rush of enthusiasm as he surveyed his surroundings. Soon he could not take a step without the crunch of bone underneath. *Quite satisfying*.

The bones grew in size, rabbit spines became cow femurs, and Toad released himself in near frolic. He was joyful, for the first time in as long as he could recall. A sensation of all-encompassing knowing took him over. As if every prayer, every wish, every question aimed at God was now his own to answer. Animal bones became distinctly human as Toad continued his dance. Two crows in the distance on either side of him crooned a distant duet. Toad danced and danced, forward with closed eyes, syncopated with the birdsong and the talkative wind and the crunch of decayed matter. The symphony of the mountain sang circles around him.

A crescendo, and a break.

Toad opened his eyes and was face to face with a wall of rock, jutting out from the earth at least twenty-five feet in height. The silence was heavy. His pupils dilated and dismissed the color in his iris. He looked up and down the rock wall. The skeleton of a massive figure sat embedded into it. It was long; scolopendrian, twisting itself in coils, each bone stacked in specified sections like human vertebrae but far from human. Grotesque and centipedal. Hundreds of legs protruded like nubbins along its sides, crawling motionlessly upward to a defined jaw and honed teeth. Frozen in stone but clawing and biting to free itself from entombment. Toad was raptured out of his trance, gooseflesh startled out of the surface of his skin as he panned his eyes up and down the fossil. He began to tremble and took a step back, shattering a caucasoid skull under his foot, and beheld in agony the long dead remains before him. He could feel it slither, see its stature, its fluidity, its lethality. He shuddered deeply and felt it in his own bones. A very large Crow fell from the air and perched atop the rock wall. It cocked its head to the side and stared at him.

*Well?*

Without an answer, Toad picked up a skull from below, stashed it in his sack, and fled.

…

*I have spent my dwindling days dinking and doddering with potion and porridge and preparation, but never have I prostrated my soul to the firmament, paid my tax to the salt and the core below, or pasteurized my practice into raw material to be of attested use. The crime of waste is mine to answer for. It is now that I pay my restitution in Gold.*

The large tortoise shell on Toad’s stove began to crackle, and he poured in milky orange liquid from a tumbler. He measured out a spoonful of grey-white powder, ground in his trusty mortar and pestle, and plopped it into the mixture shortly after the boil began, stirring surreptitiously. Tiny droplets spattered on his ceremonial chartreuse robe. Hours of simmering and stirring and the liquid became velvety and pale brown with purple tinge. Toad transferred the tortoise shell to his drying shed. Later, he retrieved the moistureless marrowbark from the shed and broke it into pieces in a small clay pot. The yield was always smaller, simpler, than the base material. *God is watching. Must do this right.*

After placing the pot in a Dutch oven, Toad returned to his stove as a beaker of thin liquid rolled and steamed below a mesh surface, held up by four wooden rods. He sprinkled in the pouch of ash and the steam turned black. Tiny dark droplets gathered on the mesh, and he carefully bottled them in a miniature vial. As the marrowbark baked, Toad used his fingers to break down strings of tobacco into his pipe, then lit them and inhaled deeply. He drank strong tea and bathed in patchouli soap and scrubbed himself with course sea salt. *We like your rituals*.

When finished bathing, he slipped back into his chartreuse robe and pulled the clay pot from its comfortable home in the Dutch oven to let it cool in open air. The baked marrowbark broke down easily into powder and Toad retrieved the vial of black droplets, pouring them in and stirring to a paste. The paste was placed on open fire, beginning to bubble and scream, coerced into letting go of its depravity and the shadow components it clung to, flittering away with smoke and filtered through suffering. *Transformation can be painful.*

Toad stared with flickering eyes as the powder began to turn a golden-brown color under the fire. He added a syrupy substance to the pot and the sleek liquid shimmered as it was stirred. A Crow watched from the window. *Gold is close, but what are you to offer us?*

All quieted. Toad brought the pot to his lips. He sipped, then downed the golden liquid in a gulp.

…

…

…

The tribespeople of the mountain were dressed in rugged wool and thick leather; sturdy materials that served the purpose of evading the tumult of the exposed mountain. The people were large, with plenty of fat to insulate stinging winters. They chattered in a native tongue and moved fluidly through the terrain that they knew in the same way they knew themselves. Hundreds of wild mountain Crows circled the air and followed and fraternized with the tribespeople, singing delighted and sweet tunes as the people cooed along. Tall, suntanned grass turned to an odd, black soil that was soft under their leather-wrapped feet.

Heading the group were three particular tribespeople. Lean and tall, regal in fine silk. They were androgynous, beautiful and koinophilic, draped in leather belts and gold jewelry. Groups of woolly tribespeople followed, and stocky, leather-clad men marched with iron trowels in the back. Cracks and crunches began sounding under their light-footed steps and the Crows oohed, the wind a calm warble. The music of movement slowed in morendo. Bodies formed themselves in rows around a wall of rock, at least twenty-five feet high. Faces alight. Crows congregated, and perched on every surface, whispering pleasantries in ears from shoulders, gossiping and gawking.

The Three Epicene Superiors knelt before the rock wall and spoke softly to the black soil and bone, kissing the feet of the monument. Every nearby being watched attentively, silently. A moment passed and the Three Superiors stood, gesturing toward the crowd which parted without seam or sound as the men with trowels moved hastily to the front. They dug at the ground before the wall as four more tribespeople were ushered in, carrying a pram, a chartreuse figure sprawled across.

The men finished digging, and the pallbearers poured the entanglement of chartreuse cloth and deadweight into the shallow hole, like spent stock tendon and bones for the wastebin. The tribespeople clucked in pity and the Three Superiors prayed.

The hole was covered, the Three Superiors bowed, and all the wild beings of the mountain gathered and gazed in enraptured anticipation at the wall fixed with their scolopendrian God Shape. Moments passed, subtle movement ensued, and long-settled dust began to stir and fall away from the monstrous wall.

The Crows laughed and laughed.

*Finally put to use.*

This was around last week of June to first week of July 2022, I matched with a girl named Ai**. She was 27 that time. I was 24.

She had tattoos. She had this flower tattoo on the lower part of her body.

We talked for a week. It started as catch  up lang after a long day at work ganon. Tapos we talked about her work and how amazed I was because she was working as a programmer.

Then we were slowly enjoying the conversation, di nalang about work. All the specific stuff I remember  was that she told me she wanted us to watch (G)-idle, my favorite color is yellow, and she even used the question ‘anong favorite number mo sa electric fan?’ just to start the ball rolling. She had all these questions that would stir a conversation, that I appreciate din kasi I’m not used to making the first move. Tapos nag match pa kami sa songs and artist choice because hello Hozier?? 

Dumating kami sa point na we were replying to different topics sa convo namin kasi di maubusan ng kwento.


Fast forward after 7 days of talking. We planned to meet already. I was excited pa back then that I even asked my friends what should I wear. Had my nails done, basta yon all the good stuff.  I prepped so much for that meet up because it was my first time to go out on a date again. 


The day before the said meet up, sabi niya kikitain na daw niya ako ng earlier since pabalik naman na daw siya ng Manila ng araw na yon. She told me she brought coffee beans from her town kasi she wanted me to try it. 


So ayon, ako naman bigay ako ng landmark na malapit sa place ko. I didn’t give her the exact place where I lived back then kasi takot pa ako lol

Sa fastfood malapit samin, doon ang suggested place ko. But lo and behold, on that very same day na sabi niya ay pabalik na siya mg manila, she deleted her account sa app. 

I was shocked and I literally didn’t move for a few seconds nung nakita ko deleted na account niya. 

There were no other ways for me to find her kasi hindi kami nag exchange ng soc med accounts. 
I know, sobrang dumb move ko na hindi ko man lang hiningi other accounts niya. Besides, it was my first time sa app noon. I was uncultured hahaha 

After my experience with her, I made sure the next person I match with has atleast another soc med account in her profile.

Although, there are days  I still wonder if she was a real person or she just used another person’s identity. 

Tingin niyo, ghosted ako or catfish lang talaga siya? 
Also, kung nababasa mo to. I don’t hold grudges, I just want to know if there was a real person behind the profile I matched with when I was 24. :) 

And if I’m being honest, you were worth my while back then.  ",2,1739130322.0,WLW_PH,1,1.0,False

1iln69z,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTableCentral/comments/1iln69z/minosys_computer_desk_review_model_b0cwp3lghy/,MINOSYS Computer Desk review model B0CWP3LGHY: compact design meets functionality,"I’ve been using the MINOSYS Computer Desk for a few weeks now, and it has seamlessly blended into my daily routine. Being someone who toggles between writing, gaming, and occasional crafting, having a reliable desk is non-negotiable. This 47-inch desk offers just the right balance of modern aesthetics, functionality, and durability.

Starting with its **design and comfort**, the desk has a modern ash finish that looks sleek enough to complement any room setup. The engineered wood and metal construction feel solid, and I didn’t notice any wobbling even when I leaned on it to reach for my coffee. The monitor stand, which can hold up to two monitors, is a game-changer for my posture. I didn’t realize how much my shoulders appreciated the elevated screen until I used this desk. However, I must note that if you're taller or use bifocals, the monitor stand may need adjustments for optimal comfort.

The **size and space** are well thought out, especially for smaller home offices or bedrooms. With dimensions of 19.7”D x 47”W x 29.5”H, it fits snugly into tight corners without feeling cramped. I comfortably fit two monitors, my keyboard, and a few knickknacks on it. The additional shelves on the side are a blessing for storing books, stationary, or even a printer. That said, those with larger gaming setups or bulkier PC towers might find the legroom slightly limited due to the side shelves.

[Grab MINOSYS Computer Desk at the best price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/product/minosys-computer-desk-review-model-b0cwp3lghy-with-details/)

The **functionality and features** of the desk are where it really shines. The 2-tier shelves can be installed on either side, making it adaptable to different room layouts. The removable monitor stand adds versatility—I initially used it for my monitors but later shifted it to the bottom shelf for extra storage space. While I love the flexibility, assembling the shelves proved a bit tricky because some screw holes didn’t align perfectly. I ended up skipping a screw for one shelf, but it still feels stable. The surface is scratch-resistant, which is perfect for someone like me who occasionally drags mugs or crafting tools across the desk.

**Assembly** was relatively straightforward, though it took me just under two hours to put together. The instructions were clear, and all parts were neatly labeled. I did appreciate that the tools were included in the package, but I’d recommend having an extra screwdriver handy. One reviewer mentioned that they finished assembly in 20 minutes—I’m honestly impressed because it wasn’t that quick for me!

**Pros:**

* Compact design fits small spaces without compromising functionality.
* Adjustable shelves and monitor stand for versatile setups.
* Scratch-resistant surface that’s easy to clean.
* Sturdy construction with no noticeable wobbling.
* Clear assembly instructions with labeled parts.

**Cons:**

* Screw holes for shelves don’t always align perfectly.
* Limited legroom for those with larger PC towers.
* Monitor stand may not suit taller users or those using bifocals.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to similar desks like the CubiCubi Study Desk and the SHW Home Office Desk, the MINOSYS desk stands out for its adjustable shelves and additional monitor stand. While CubiCubi desks often feature stylish designs, they lack the flexibility of MINOSYS’s 2-tier adjustable shelving. On the other hand, SHW desks are known for their ease of assembly, but they don’t offer as much storage or surface area. However, both competitors tend to have a slightly lower price point, making them appealing for budget-conscious buyers. If you prioritize customization and durability, MINOSYS has the upper hand.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
While I can’t give you an exact price due to fluctuating rates, I’d say the MINOSYS Computer Desk offers excellent value for its features. You’re essentially getting a desk that combines the functionality of a gaming desk with the aesthetics of a home office desk. It’s not the cheapest option out there, but the added shelves, sturdy build, and ergonomic benefits justify the price. For anyone looking for a reliable and versatile workstation, this desk is worth considering.

We're thinking about separation.","It’s too hard for me to put everything in our relationship into words. It will be a very long post because I think you guys need a lot of information to help me solve my dilemma. Please have look at my TL;DR! first.

…

I (34M) met my wife (36F) 4 years ago. We married after 1 year together. We have a 2-year-old daughter.

She’s a gorgeous woman. She has a calm and bright vibe that lights up the whole room and brings joy to everyone around. She’s a considerate person. She genuinely cares for everyone and everything and is willing to take immediate action if needed. She always has everything planned out and well executed.

She used to study fashion design in Paris but didn’t stay long in the fashion industry. She now has a career in energy healing (spiritually/mentally), which fits well with her character. She loves having everything high-standard, or even high-class. She has had high expectations for life since she was a child, despite being born into a middle-class family in Vietnam.

On the other side, I’m a casual and laid-back guy. I mean, I’m enthusiastically doing things that I’m passionate about (many things). But apart from that, you could say I’m a bit slack. I love to spend time on what I love (a bit too much) but not practically. I don’t care much about clothing (opposite to her). I don’t have any clear far-future plan in general. I could say I’m a nice guy but somewhat messed up my life before I met her (and she fixed it miraculously).

The reason we clicked to each other maybe because we’re on the same page when talking about music and other kinds of entertainment (high-class stuff, to her). Also, my vocation is teaching and blogging about Go (a kind of chess usually played in the East). It’s often considered a game for high-intellectual persons in Asia. To me, I love all of those things just because they’re wonderful; I don’t care much about class.

We also have lots of good laughs together.

…

Before having our daughter, we usually had some disputes about our expectations of life. She usually accused me of being too content with what I have and lacking ambition.

To my defense, contributing to Go could be my Ikigai. I’ve many times broken out from it and tried working in a design career, but I came back to Go every time. And I’m not that unambitious, I have plans to expand my business.

I’m one of the lucky persons who made my living by my ‘passion’. I don’t earn a lot, but my income is above average in my city (Ho Chi Minh City) and I occasionally have prize money from playing in Go tournaments.

She’s also lucky to have a job that she’s gracefully doing, and making at least twice as much as me. On top of that, we’re not doing them all day so we often have some extra time to spare.

So, before having our daughter, we often had arguments, but it wasn’t too bad because we didn’t have any real pressure and responsibility. Actually, we had lots of great times together at that time.

…

Since she earns at least twice as much as me, she tends to spend more. After marrying, we lived almost on separate accounts and tried to pay essential things equally: apartment renting (not so affordable one), food, meals (more than it should be), cats, health… Even though she usually pays more (55/45), I’m always living paycheck to paycheck to afford her standard.

She always has savings and could afford to buy some not-so-cheap items occasionally.

(For this matter, I’ve been consulted in another post that we should share our spending equitably, not equally. I’ll discuss this with her for sure).

…

After our daughter was born, everything became hard-mode. We take turns working and taking care of the baby and chores almost equally. We barely have anyone to help, except for a 3-month period with a babysitter.

To some extent, I even spend more time with our daughter than she does because she sometimes has more clients to work with. My plan on expanding my Go business has slowed down for almost 2 years now. I still maintain my teaching and make enough income to contribute to the family.

As the pressure is suddenly getting higher, she brings back all the arguments from before (about income and the standard of living). It’s beyond my power to do something about it since I spend a lot of time taking care of the family. (I cut short all of my pleasurable time, including playing ping pong and coffee with friends).

All of those arguments took up a lot of (precious) time and energy for nothing. Because I literally can’t do anything about it. She usually says: “I don’t say now, but I mean I wish you could have done better in the past”.

Since I’m not making good-enough money (at least close to hers), she attributes that to how unorganized, undisciplined, unambitious, and lacking in determination I am for serious work. In reality, I documented all of my working hours within 2 years into a well-laid out and well-categorized Notion database.

Ironically, in that database, a lot of time we used is to argue.

…

She loves cleanliness—not to the point of perfection, but she’s far above anyone I’ve ever met. I know that and try my best to help her keep the apartment as clean as possible (we never let dishes stay in the sink, vacuum here and there 5-10 times per day, …). Everyone says ""wow"" the first time they enter our apartment.

Apart from chores, I also do all the “dirty” work (clean all household appliances’ filters, fans, storage, cats’ litter box…) and maintain all the “man” stuff. I love making the house the most convenient one so I often buy useful things (shelves, hooks, lights,…) and play around with them.

However, due to my nature of being forgetful and a bit hasty, I leave some small things undone occasionally. Many of these instances are also due to chasing and playing with our super active daughter around the house. I’m still on my way to continuing to improve it. For instance, I have my apps to remind me or I read books about mindfulness.

She thinks I’m a disaster and feels tired every time she finds a towel not hung (in a clean room) or a pot not washed (in a clean kitchen), even though she agrees that I’ve improved a lot.

…

She loves being loved and being the woman in the house. She totally deserves it. According to the 5 languages of love, I’m doing great to show her how I love her. I never forget to say I love her every other day. I spend a lot of time with her, listening to her, driving her everywhere, helping her make websites and many graphic design items for her business… I touch and hug her any possible time (I love it), I casually massage her, offer to dry her hair after a shower, I gift her creative birthday presents, I buy her flowers, snacks, and small gifts occasionally.

I care about her well-being. I care about what she eats and should not eat. I take care of her every time she feels sick (she easily catches colds 2-3 times per month and I'll perform Gua Sha/coining to help her release the cold as it works for her). I join yoga classes with her. I ask her to go jogging with me. I pay for her ping pong lessons. I remind her to learn to swim. I remind her not to use the phone too much, especially at night.

She feels disappointed because I never buy her clothes or accessories or makeup. This is due to my lack of knowledge about her personal and high-standard choices and my lack of money since I always live on the edge.

Because of that, she said she hardly feels loved by me. Everything else, she counts them as obligations.

…

Without a doubt, she improved my quality of life by a distance. She showed her love and care to me in her ways (but not the same as mine, like she doesn’t love to touch or say she loves me). She’s always there to listen to my troubles and give the best advice. She never hesitates to give me some money to spend on my work. She even helps my parents and sister in many ways. Above all, she gave me the most beautiful thing I’ve ever cherished - our daughter. I feel I can never thank her enough, and I never forget it.

I think we’re luckier and happier a lot more than average. But for her, “more than average” is equal to a failure. She always strives for a higher and higher quality of life, while I strive to have a balanced life.

From the day our daughter was born, she often starts the argument (with frustration) that we are not on the way to “get higher”. She has sacrificed a lot of her privilege to compromise on living with me. The perspective of the never-ending compromise freaks her out, to the point that she would prefer living without me dragging her down.

I thought that was her postpartum depression. Since we’ve been through a lot of ups and downs together, I believe she still loves me even though she claims the opposite. So I tried to navigate through that period by mellowing her and trying harder to be helpful.

Until now, it’s almost two years and everything seems just like before. A few days ago, she said exactly the same thing as she said to me a year ago that she doesn’t love me anymore because of every trouble (and not-high-standard things) I bring to her life.

…

Thank you for reading until now. Time for some ending.

I would say more than 70% of the time we spend together is on happy moments, and it keeps me thinking that we can work it out. But the rest is so fatal; it wrecks our relationship like a tempest.

What I could do is try to be better to meet her expectations. I tried a lot and told her that many times. And every time, she replied: “You think that is enough trying?”. To my frustration, I don’t even know if I can do anything else.

Lately, I gave her a questionnaire for her to reflect on our relationship. It is:

What did she give me? A list of 7 things, in summary, untold support, as I wrote above.

What does she appreciate from me?

1. Buying petty household items.
2. Playing with our daughter and cats.
3. Making an effort to do housework, trying to do whatever I am asked to do, but not consistently.

My strengths? Good deeds, capable of playing with children and animals.

My weaknesses? A long, long list. As I’m the worst person she could ever meet in terms of striving for a better life.

How could we sustain this relationship? I get rid of all the weaknesses (and then live a better life).

…

After reading the answers, I suddenly felt empty knowing that all of my love and effort are not appreciated by her. That’s why she always feels that she is the sole giver and I’m the sole taker. She cares too much and wants to see something in return.

In every argument that happened before, I always believed that she appreciated the time we spend together and we are a part of each other that cannot be separated. We only need to get over any obstacles and we will get by.

Now, I feel a huge release that this could be the ringing bell for me to give up this relationship and stop wasting my time anymore. If I choose to stay, I don’t see any solution for us to not feel frustrated and want to end this over and over.

The biggest “but” is our daughter. I can't bear the thought of my daughter growing up without her father always by her side.

So, tomorrow night, we will sit down and I will say that I offer a separation. To me, this is so ridiculous that we exchange our “above average and improving” life for a nightmare called divorce

  
How can I solve this dilemma about whether to separate or not?

…

TL;DR!:

* I (34M) met my wife (36F) 4 years ago. We married after 1 year together. We have a 2-year-old daughter.
* She’s a gorgeous woman with high expectations in life. I’m a normal guy who is lucky to make a living with my passion, but not much.
* The differences between our points of view were not yet a problem until our daughter was born. For almost 2 years, she has been disappointed about 3 things from me: 1. My lack of work skills. 2. My lack of household skills. 3. My lack of love and caring for her.
* While she’s correct in many points, I’ve admitted it and taken action to change. Some of her points are not valid to me, as I explained above.
* We’re constantly frustrated because she feels like she has to compromise her whole life to an above-average life. Even though I think I’ve tried my best to meet her expectations.
* I found out she doesn’t love me anymore because she never appreciated me enough to compensate for her sacrifice and compromise. I’m about to offer a separation.",3,1739129838.0,relationship_advice,22,0.64,False
1iln37o,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1iln37o/vertuo_not_making_full_cups_but_only_with_decafe/,Vertuo Not Making Full Cups - but only with decafe pods,"My three year old Vertuo Original - Breville - has been putting excessive grounds out and NOT making the full 7.7 oz cup......BUT ONLY when my wife brews her Melozio Decaffeinato.  This is a recent development.

I use it daily for regular coffee and sometimes espresso or double espresso and it's working fine with those.  Every once in a while it's done something strange but, that's usually because I managed to hit to brew button too many times, run out of water or something that threw it off.  And it worked fine after that one off incident.

Just in the last week, in response to the decafe issue, I've tried cleaning it twice.  And, I just factory reset it a few minutes ago.  I haven't descaled it in a couple of months.

After I just reset it, I brewed up a cup of Melozio Decaffeinato for the Mrs. and it brewed a full cup without grounds, as it should.  But a bit slowly and noisily it seemed.  Of course, she told me it ""tasted funny"".

This machine has gotten louder over time.  To the point where it hurts one's ears if you are standing close to it.  And, it sometimes seems to sputter a bit.

Wife is insisting on a ""new machine"".  I say she got a bad batch of Melozio Decaffeinato pods.  No reason to replace it and, a new one might not fix the problem if it's a batch of bad pods.

What do the redditers here say?  Pods or machine?  I've got $154 and possibly my relationship hanging in the balance.  ;-0

1iln28o,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeingScaredStories/comments/1iln28o/broken_heart_hunter/,Broken heart hunter,"I was in my mid 20s when I found myself alone in Paris during one summer. Through luck and some connections, I could catch a nice summer job at a government facility that paid really well. It was just for a few weeks but I decided to make the most of it. Plus, as a poor student, I really did not get many opportunities like these. My aunt lived in Paris with her husband during this time and I could come to live with them in their apartment, saving some money on lodging. For the last 2 weeks they would be on a vacation and I had the place for myself. 

Everything went well. I enjoyed my work. Everyone at the office was kind and the apartment was in a nicer area of Paris since my aunt and her husband were well off.  In the mornings I got myself a baguette or croissant, go to work, do my job, which mainly consisted of organizing their little office archive and go home. Sometimes I would chat with my partner through skype. On my days off I’d roam around, visit the sights and some markets. All in all, I made most of my time there until this one night.   

 

It was the evening before my last day at the office. I had baked a cake as a parting gift to everyone in the office and I was chatting with my partner when I realized, that he was a lot more distanced than usual. 

When I asked him about it, he flat out broke up with me, apologized and logged out, leaving me dumbfounded. I was so shocked, that I sat there, staring at the screen for God knows how long, before it started to sink in. For me it came out of nowhere. I had just started to open up to him more and this was like a slap in the face. I cried all through the night and felt like a train had hit me the next morning. Normally, I wouldn’t have left the apartment that day to do anything. But I am a compulsive person...and this was my last day... 

So, I put myself together, grabbed the cake and went to the office. However, when I arrived there and everyone kept looking at me as if I was in an accident, I quickly realized, this wouldn’t work and I made an excuse about me being sick before quietly leaving. 

 I don’t remember making any conscious decision, but a moment later, I found myself in a small super market looking for cookies and things to bring home, as this was my last day in Paris. I randomly grabbed things without really looking what it was, when I suddenly realized, that someone was staring at me.  

 From the other side of an isle full of fresh baked goods a young man was looking at me, smiling. 

He looked nice enough. Tall, tanned skin, dark curls, dark eyes. A face that seemed to smile a lot. Not wanting to be rude, I gave a little smile back and he immediately started talking to me. He told me how pretty he thought I looked and asked where I was from, quickly realizing that I wasn’t a local. I should have been skeptical at him calling me pretty when I clearly looked like a zombie at this point of time, but I wasn’t myself. 

My French was mid-level at best. The governmental agency where I had my summer job luckily was an international organization where most peoples talked English. So, I only needed enough French to buy groceries or for quick base level conversations on the street. Nothing too deep. I quickly found myself out of words and had trouble following him. But I understood that he wanted to drink a coffee with me. Under any normal circumstances I would have said no, as I am typically a rather shy person. But I heard myself say yes.  

Before I knew it, he would guide me through some backstreets, all the while chatting with me and I followed like a brainless puppy. After a while, we came to a halt in front of a building complex. No Café in sight. All there was, was a garage. Yes, you read that right. A garage. More precisely, an underground car park. And he was trying to get me to follow him inside of said car park.  

When I saw the gaping black hole of that gate alarm bells started going off in my mind. It was like waking from some kind of trance by getting a glass of cold water in your face.  

While my new acquaintance was trying to get me to go down this garage for some “coffee”, gently but surely grabbing my arm and guiding me closer to the gate, I planted my feet into the ground and tried to find a way to politely decline. At that moment an older guy came out of the gate. He seemed to know my smiley new ""friend"" and they exchanged some greetings in passing. I did not understand all they said, but the jest of it was pretty simple. This was a routine for Mr. Smiley. I will never forget the way that old guy looked at me with this unmistakable smirk, then shaking his head and turning to go barking out a loud old man's laugh.   

At this point, I was out 100. I signaled that accordingly and maybe the way I vehemently declined any further attempts of luring me sank in because he relented after a short while.  

Still, he insisted on bringing me to the next metro station so I could go home. I don’t remember much of what was talked about on that way. I gave him my mobile number (firmly resolved on blocking him) and we parted ways.  

 

You may think, what the hell? Where is the scary part? But believe me, this was one of the scariest moments of my life. It is absolutely scary, what the human mind can do when in shock and it is even more scary, that there are peoples out there who seem to have a sixth sense for finding vulnerable peoples. 

Of course, it could have been an innocent romantic invite that is absolutely in line with French custom. But my instinct tells me, that this was exactly what it felt like. Some hunter looking for prey. And I was the prey that day. 

What do you think? Was it just an innocent invite? Would actual coffee have been involved in any part of it? Or did I unwillingly say yes to sex by accepting a coffee invite? I really don’t know the social etiquette here... ",1,1739129746.0,BeingScaredStories,0,1.0,False

Who is the Kameena?,"So me and a girl talk once in a while. I was doing quite well careerwise. Took a break. Around the same time she moved to Chennai for a new job. We are friends. Hang out here and there. 

She began to ask me to visit her in Chennai since I was on a break nearby. She asked me four times to visit her on my count and eventually we made a full plan. Chennai Pondy etc. 

I stress we are friends. We have gone on several coffee meet ups like once a year. But this time I was going out of my way to meet her in another city and introduce her to my friends etc. 

We planned this together. We picked stops to eat and stay. There was some disagreements here and there. I was adding another leg to which said YOLO yes. Then two days later no. Can't be groggy back at work. 

I said ok said I will go and booked a return bus ticket for her early as i noted the seats were few and women seats were few. She seemed upset I did this and I cancelled it. 

To make it relaxed I had another friend join me for the drive which was gonna be 2500 km overall for me. Also we had separate rooms at places we were planning to stay. 

My cousins run multiple Airbnbs in Pondy and some hotels in Pondy and Karaikudi - so I had secured those for free etc. I informed her about those as well. 

I was also supposed introduce her to people I know in Chennai who were foodies and filmophiles. I was going to introduce her to professional contacts in Pondy which she was very keen on. 

On the way to Chennai, with 600 km of 800 km completed, she called and said she is cancelling the trip as her dog is sick (adopted street dog) with renal failure.

She would be going two days later to the vet. But the trip itself would be cancelled. She said i could come and see her. After a long pause, she said 'If I want too'. 

My friend who was in the car with me was aghast at the tone. He told me to cut this person off. I was bemused and confused. I said its okay but I was seething at the inconsiderate nature of this. 

I also didnt fully buy the story. She went to work next day leaving the sick dog alone etc. Meanwhile i continued to meet people, tried exotic food and watched movies (first show tamil movie experience) to have fun with friends / cousins. 

I checked in with her on the day we were supposed to go. Enquired about the dogs condition. She said it was the same. She was sticking by her decisions. Eventually I left and continued to Pondy. 

On advice of friends I scrubbed her from my phone. None of them fully bought her story and told me not to remain in touch. All of this was most perplexing but I am unsure if I am right in not believing her and if I overreacted.

1ilmvh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/sterilization/comments/1ilmvh6/my_bisalp_experience/,My Bisalp Experience,"I had my bisalp this week!!! I've been so thankful for this sub and the wealth of information you all have shared, so I definitely wanted to do my part by sharing my experience, too. 😊 By in large my experience has been pretty similar to others here so I thought I would just focus on parts that may be a little different or unique.

For reference, I'm a married 45 year old female living in the US in a red state. I scheduled my consult in November the day after the election, pre-op was in January, and my surgery was Wednesday. I did not have an ultrasound, do any blood work, bowel prep, or use a special soap pre-op. I was just instructed not to eat or drink after midnight the night before, no perfume, lotion, or jewelry. I was allowed to take my thyroid medicine the morning of the surgery.

My insurance is Regence BCBS and CPT code 58670 was used for my bisalp which is different than the code I see most commonly referenced here. Prior to the day of my surgery I did have some back and forth with the hospital to confirm the surgery would be covered at 100%. I spoke to a representative from my insurance company who verified it falls under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ""PPACA"" and they advised me to relay this exact information to the hospital which I did. Since my bisalp was just a few days ago I'll have to wait and see if I run into any issues with billing post-op and will update here if so.

I have 20+ ear piercings and some are at various stages of healing so I really did not want to have to remove them for the surgery. I asked my doctor about this at my pre-op and she said they could put hospital tape over them to ""ground"" them instead, and thankfully this is what they did. Apparently this option is procedure-dependent and also would not have been an option for piercings on other parts of the body but I am grateful it was a possibility for me in this case.

My surgery went well but I did have a hard time peeing for the first time afterwards. I was at the hospital much longer than I anticipated because of this (I checked in at 8:30am, surgery was around 11, and I didn't leave until 4-4:30pm). They almost had to send me home with a catheter, but luckily after drinking some coffee the caffeine stimulated my bladder enough to go. Since the surgery, peeing has continued to take some effort and concentration. Gently leaning forward toward the end of peeing has helped ensure my bladder is fully empty. This is slowly improving each day.

I was prescribed 800mg ibuprofen every 8 hrs for 10 days and 5mg oxycodone every 6 hours as needed. I took the oxy the first 2 nights after my surgery but haven't felt the need to take it since. I'm still taking the ibuprofen and can feel it when I get off schedule. 

I was fully prepared to experience some serious gas pains but that hasn't been too bad at all. Despite using a stool softener and eating prunes regularly leading up to my surgery date and after, I did not have a bowel movement until Day 3 post-op. It wasn't much and I've yet to have a normal, complete BM. Last night I also had a pretty bad stomachache but not sure if this is related.

Overall the actual incision sites have not been super painful but moreso uncomfortable, like a constant nagging tugging feeling. I couldn't stand up straight for the first few days but now on Day 4 I can stand almost completely straight without feeling too much tugging or discomfort. My belly button has been especially uncomfortable for me but this is in part because I absolutely hate anyting touching it so having a constant pulling sensation there has not been pleasant.

My throat is still very sore. It is painful to eat most solid foods. It feels like my throat is bruised and it feels worse while eating. I meal prepped before my surgery so I've eaten a little of that, but honestly all I really want to eat is Jell-O or broth. My husband picked up some chloraseptic spray for me yesterday which had helped temporarily numb it a little. I am hoping this subsides soon because it's been one of the worst parts for me.

Oh I also wanted to mention I tried sleeping in my bed the first night and could not sleep at all even after taking an oxy. Since then I've spent all my time and slept on the couch which has helped me a ton. I'm normally a stomach sleeper so having the extra support of the back of the couch to lean on or lay up against has been a game changer for me! I will continue to sleep on the couch until I can sleep on my stomach again.

Overall I am thrilled I finally did this after years of thinking about it. I've never wanted kids, so in a weird way having this surgery makes me feel like my body is now the way it was always supposed to be. Thanks again to everyone who has taken the time to share their experiences here, it really is such an incredible resource! 💕",8,1739129280.0,sterilization,0,1.0,False

i asked why would that be an issue

he replied “idk i thought you were dating someone”

i said “geez you’re acting like you’re into me never mind i asked” in a lighthearted manner 

he said “😂wth”

he asked me multiple times to explain what do i know and i did. he said he doesn’t know why that person assumed he’s like that when he’s clubbing. i also clarified i didn’t ask him to go clubbing with me to fuck around

I wanted to share my setup as an actual college student (lol). I recently upgraded to flair 58 from rok gc, and have been extremely happy with the shots I have been able to pull. I mostly drink non-milk drinks so I save money by using an 18 dollar milk foamer from amazon which produces underwhelming foamed milk but for the money is not so bad.

Full setup includes IMS precision basket, normcore tamper, temperature regulated kettle, scale with timer, dosing funnel, and wdt tool. I bought everything except the baratza encore esp used, so the total cost of this setup is only a little over 500. I focus on buying good, local, fresh beans. I track most variables and shots in a spreadsheet so I can look back and better dial in shots, plus it is fun to see the data. This to me is pretty close to endgame, I want to get a water filter and maybe upgrade to the flair plunger which has the locking clasp just for workflow, but otherwise I am quite happy with this setup. In a few years I would like to get a nicer grinder, but as I said, this setup to me is really quite good and produces excellent espresso most of the time. I make 12 or so shots a week, both decaf and caffeinated.

Anyways, I hope you all enjoy seeing what a college student who is quite into espresso does for coffee",2,1739129036.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Hi, this is a throwaway. So just a little bit about me. I’m a middle aged woman. Not bad looking imo. Been told I’m very attractive by quite a few men but it’s subjective isn’t it. Anyway I take good care of myself, I’m slim, workout, eat clean 90%, don’t drink, don’t smoke so while I look early 40s, I do look very well for my age. I dress well etc etc. Anyway getting to the point. I’ve been separated from my partner the last year. We were in a dead bedroom and for other reasons. He lost interest in me. I have a healthy sex drive and because it had been 2 yrs since I was intimate with my ex, a friend suggested dating apps to help me meet someone who might be interested in an ongoing fwb type of thing as I don’t have time for long term and it would just be to scratch an itch. 

I really struggled to meet anyone really. I’ve been open about the fact that I’m looking for a fwb. Some men either just wanted a pen pal or sexting which I don’t want. Some were attached which I defo didn’t want. I went on some coffee dates and two men seemed like the ‘right’ type. I was very attracted to one guy and after chatting quite a bit via text and then meeting irl, we eventually got together one night and had sex. It was good and I thought it might become an ongoing thing because he said he enjoyed it but he hasn’t contacted me in nearly 2 months so I guess it was a ons. The second guy was similar only we didn’t have sex. We just fooled around. I love giving head so I gave him a bj and I know he loved it and he said it was ‘wow!’. We said we’d see each other again for casual fun but then when I text him he said “I don’t want to be a spontaneous text. I have feelings and emotions. It’s not you. Sorry”. 

So my question is: am I doing something wrong? I’m sure I am. I’ve only ever had relationships so this is so new to me. How do I find a ‘fwb and avoid the ons kind of guys? My male friend who suggested the apps said I’d have no trouble finding a fwb. But it’s like trying to find a needle in a haystack. I thought it would be easier and (no disrespect to men) but I thought most guys would jump at the chance for ongoing, no strings attached sex with an attractive woman. 

Genuine advice please 🙏 I don’t want just one night stands with random strangers. I’d still like some kind of a connection with someone but without the expectation of anything serious. (Sorry for the long post)",1,1739129027.0,AskMenAdvice,8,1.0,False

Hello! I was until fairly recently quite happily (mindlessly) using the delonghi dedica with its original pressurised portafilter basket. I used freshly ground coffee each morning, but only from the Delonghi KG79.

Then it stopped 'going'. The coffee machine is, admittedly, some 10 years old. I replaced the portafilter basket and realised I hated the new delonghi design with the silicone removal ring (it always ended up in my knock box) and purchased an off brand one from aliexpress. Therein discovering the joy of a nonpressurised basket - I of course have fallen down a rabbithole and purchased a Baratza ESP grinder. I also gave the unit a good descale.

But here's the rub. On using it with a nice full portafilter - the delonghi is still just not getting up to pressure, I think maybe the pump is doing its job. I can make a coffee with about 16g beans but its not getting a good crema. Thats not ground super fine or anything.

Question: is this an issue I can likely repair easily/cheaply? Could it be a 'deep clean' thing? Should I just be looking to replace the thing? Having just purchased the grinder, I was hoping not to make further coffee purchases other than actual coffee. Although I enjoy drinking it I am not rich and not looking to spend! :( I am disabled and have some tools but not an array.",1,1739128937.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1ilmirk,https://www.reddit.com/r/skincaredevices/comments/1ilmirk/circadian_optics_lampu_review_does_it_really/,Circadian Optics Lampu review: Does It Really Boost Mood and Energy?,"Using the Circadian Optics Lampu Light Therapy Lamp has been an interesting addition to my daily routine. As someone who works long hours in a home office with limited natural light, I’ve definitely felt the effects of the dark winter days creeping in. The Lampu has been a game-changer in some ways, but as with everything, there are a few areas where it could improve.

The design of this lamp immediately caught my attention. It’s compact, modern, and looks great on a desk or bedside table. Unlike some other therapy lights that can be clunky and unattractive, this one blends seamlessly into my workspace. The materials feel durable, and although it’s lightweight, it doesn’t tip over easily. My cat, who loves knocking things off my desk, gave it her best shot, and it held its ground. If you're someone who values aesthetics as much as functionality, this design will definitely appeal to you.

The light intensity is a big selling point for the Lampu. It's marketed as delivering 10,000 lux, which is the standard for light therapy, but after reading some other reviews and doing my own research, I found that it might not quite hit that mark. That being said, it’s still incredibly bright. The touch-sensitive control allows you to cycle through three brightness levels, which I found useful when adjusting to the light. On its highest setting, it can feel a bit overwhelming at first, so I often start on the medium setting before gradually increasing it.

[Check Circadian Optics Lampu price on Amazon.](https://agegene.com/product/circadian-optics-lampu-light-therapy-review-b075xrztv1/)

The color temperature of this lamp leans towards the cooler spectrum, giving off a crisp white light that’s meant to mimic natural daylight. It’s UV-free, so there’s no risk of skin damage, which is a relief. I’ve been using it for about 30 minutes each morning while sipping my coffee, and it does seem to help wake me up and shake off that groggy feeling.

Ease of use is another highlight. The one-touch button is incredibly responsive—you barely need to tap it. However, I do wish it had an automatic timer. Setting a timer on my phone or using an external device isn’t a big deal, but having a built-in option would make it even more convenient. It’s a small gripe, but it’s worth mentioning.

Portability and size are just right for my needs. It doesn’t take up too much space on my desk, and moving it from my office to the living room is a breeze. Despite its compact size, it provides a wide enough beam to be effective. However, the fixed angle can be limiting. To get the light shining at the right angle, I’ve had to prop it up on a stack of books—a bit of a DIY solution.

As for safety and comfort, the lamp performs well. The light is flicker-free, and I haven’t experienced any eye strain, even during longer sessions. It’s also backed by medical research, which gives me confidence in its effectiveness. However, the base of the lamp is smooth, which makes it prone to sliding on certain surfaces. Adding rubber pads or bumpers underneath can easily solve this issue.

**Pros**

* Sleek, compact design that fits into any space.
* Bright light with three adjustable settings.
* UV-free and medically certified for safe use.
* Durable and stable, even when bumped.
* Easy-to-use touch controls.

**Cons**

* May not truly deliver 10,000 lux as advertised.
* Fixed angle can limit placement options.
* Lacks a built-in timer for added convenience.
* Smooth base causes sliding on some surfaces.

**Comparison to Competitors**

When comparing the Circadian Optics Lampu to other light therapy options like the Verilux HappyLight and Carex Day-Light, it holds its ground in terms of design and ease of use. The Verilux HappyLight, for example, offers a similar compact design but includes a built-in timer and customizable color temperature settings, making it slightly more versatile. On the other hand, the Carex Day-Light provides a larger light surface and adjustable angles, which might be better for those seeking more flexibility or a more intense light source. However, both competitors come at a higher price point, making the Lampu a more budget-friendly option without compromising too much on performance.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

Considering its features and performance, the Circadian Optics Lampu offers excellent value for money. While it doesn’t include some of the premium features found in higher-end models, like adjustable angles or timers, it delivers where it matters most—providing bright, effective light to help combat seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and improve mood and energy levels. If you’re looking for an affordable, stylish, and functional light therapy option, this lamp is worth considering.

The Lampu is a solid choice for anyone new to light therapy or looking for a budget-friendly option. It’s not perfect, but it gets the job done and looks good while doing it. Whether you’re battling the winter blues or just need an energy boost, this lamp is a great addition to your daily routine.

1ilmf17,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1ilmf17/to_my_husband_whoever_he_may_be/,"To my husband, whoever he may be.","Dear husband, 

I woke up the other morning thinking of you, wondering where you are and when you are coming home. I have been looking for you for so long now that I wonder if perhaps I am never meant to find you, if perhaps this life will not be something that I can share with you. I’m being pessimistic, I know, and there are so many times throughout my days that I swear I can feel you, but you aren’t there. Can you please come and find me? I'm tired of waiting.  

I lay in bed at night, in the morning, and I can feel the imprint you make when you’re laying next to me. I can feel myself wake up, quietly, and I go to start the coffee. I make mine, I make yours - black with a little bit of milk - I know exactly how you like it, because you are my husband and you are the one that I know the best only after myself. On nights that I cannot sleep, when I give in to those moments of anxiety and memories that are decades-years-days old but still haunt me, you are there to tell me it’s over, it’s done, you don’t need to keep going there anymore but if you do, I’m there with you, I’ll go too. I hear you say these things to me, and you hold my hand until I fall back asleep. Because you do this for me, I know how to make your coffee for you, and I am so lucky to give that love back to you in any form that I can. 

But you still aren’t here with me, even though I can feel you - we still haven’t met, and I think we are growing old without each other. This isn’t supposed to happen, how can we let this happen? Every day, I am without you, and maybe you are missing me but don’t know who I am or where to find me. I know that you are on one of the many roads that I have yet to travel, you are waiting in some secret place that I have yet to find but can feel it calling me, and I just hope that I can find you while I still have some time and memories to give to you and the life we will lead. It will be beautiful, I know, with our little brick house in the woods, I sing while I make cookies and you do yard work, smiling because you love my voice like I love your hands and they are always reaching for each other in so many ways. We have so many trips to take, so many places to see - I want to show you the paths that I have taken before where dinosaurs once walked (you can see still them if you squint), I want to take you to the desert, I want to walk through ancient cities with you, always holding your hand. I want you to take me to your places, share your stories, weave your story through me until I can no longer remember whose memory it is - yours, mine, or ours, all the same anyways. I try to do this now, imprint memories into my brain that I can share with you when we meet, stories that I want to tell you of things that I have seen, places that I have been, but I'm getting tired of doing this by myself, always waiting. I would like you to fill the space next to me, make the journey with me, it's time now, can you please come with me? 

I send this letter to nowhere, to the empty space in bed next to me, to the person who will someday sit next to me at family dinners and brag about my baking skills, to the man who will stand next to me and want me to be there, ride or die no matter the road, the husband that will show my son that his mom is loved, so loved, so that he can now grow in the directions that he needs to without looking back because he knows I'm good, with you. I want to meet the person who will be there when I’m leaving this earth, who understands those lyrics - I got you in the end I wish I had you from the start - and feels them when we look at each other. 

I am tired of walking through this life alone, I am tired of trying to find you in other people and it just isn’t right, they don’t feel right because they aren’t you, whoever you may be. Can you please come home now? I’m not sure how I am supposed to keep doing this without you but I will continue doing the best I can until we find each other. 

Love, 

Your wife

For those with flow control machines, what sort of flow profiles are you experimenting with for lighter roasts?

I woke up really wanting a hot coffee today. I’m just as broke today as I’ve been for months, although I’m working and trying to catch up, I just don’t have extra cash at all. But I do have an EBT/SNAP/Food Stamps card. I looked up online if the #Chevron gas station by my house takes EBT, they do. Plus EBT sent an email the other day saying we can use the benefits on hot and prepared food until March 5, 2025. I walked over to the Chevron, asked the attendant if they accept EBT and she said yes so I proceeded to make the biggest cup of coffee they had. It was perfectly hot creamy and sweet and everything I wanted this morning (because sometimes it’s the simple joys that make our mornings so much more livable). They took out their machine to run my card but then said their machine had been having problems for a few weeks and they couldn’t accept my payment. I let them know that was the only money I had and I already started sipping my coffee. Then, with a line of people behind me, they took back my coffee and said sorry we can’t accept your food stamps. I walked out so disappointed and ashamed and embarrassed. I couldn’t afford my one cup of coffee that I had been looking forward to. 
That was it. That was my whole rant. I cried my whole walk home because it was the one joy I was going to allow myself to indulge in and I couldn’t even do that. ",6,1739127776.0,foodstamps,8,0.8,False

1ilm99m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ilm99m,Redesigned an old OC into a WOF Dragon!,"
NOTE: Post is spoiled for mentions of: Taxidermy/Death, as well as a flesh and blood reference! 

Remade an old closed species OC of mine into a Skywing/Sandwing hybrid since I didn’t like the species anymore! He’s like 2 years old, so he was waiting for a long time for a redesign. His name is Carcass! He lives along the outer edges of the Kingdom of Sand, has a little shop setup out there, hoping to capitalize on travelers and such. 

He is based on a Bearded Vulture, albeit very loosely. I won’t be showing his old design since it isn’t my art and doesn’t apply to the sub, so give a look to his new design instead! :P Questions and comments are ofc always welcome! 


A few little fun facts about him for anyone interested:

- He’s incredibly antisocial, and only socializes with others to sell his wares and make a living. Outside of his Shopkeeping, he keeps to himself and is rather grumpy if bothered. He will actively attempt to shoo off other dragons, ESPECIALLY dragonets. 

- Carcass finds metal and gem jewelry to be gaudy and unappealing. He finds the fashion sense of most Skywings and Seawings to be rather ugly, but he keeps it to himself, minus a few snout wrinkles and eye rolls behind backs. 

- His voice is deep and gravelly, likely from the dry environment of the desert in which he lives. The sand doesn’t exactly help. He sounds like a disappointed cowboy who also happens to be your uncle or grandfather. 

- Carcass knows a thing or two about medicine. Given he lives on his own and has to defend himself, he took up learning a few salves, ointments, and wound dressing methods. He’s especially good with treating venom-based wounds and burns, though whether he’s inclined to help you or not is another question altogether. 

- He refuses to harm living animals for his taxidermy. Of course, he will hunt and eat as necessary, but unless an animal has died in its own, he will not use them for Taxidermy. This is out of respect for the wildlife. Dragons, on the other claw… 

- He prefers coffee over tea. He drinks it bitter and black. 

- Actually a deeply accepting individual when it comes to identity. He doesn’t judge based off of tribe, sexuality, or appearance. Well, unless you count what you’re wearing. Surely you’d look better with some tooth earrings or a bracelet made of Skywing talons or something…

- He uses EVERYTHING. Everything. He is not one to waste. If he kills something, he puts every single thing he can to good use. Every scale of a dragon, every tooth, every pound of flesh, every organ. It is all used for something! 

- Good at preservation, and has a deal with an Icewing who provides him with frost breath and ice from Icewing territory. They meet along the border so neither of them are too hot or too cold. Thankfully he is a fast flier, so he gets the ice home in time to store it away in his root cellar. ",15,1739127759.0,WingsOfFire,0,1.0,False

We’ve talked about this a couple of times and he’s explained to me why he has been so frustrated with my behaviour lately but I’m struggling to figure out how I can do better. 

I feel like the best way to explain the situation is to describe our recent arguments:

- One day, I was making us coffees in his very nice espresso machine. When I had the milk frother going, the machine showed a clear indicator that the water tray was full and would overflow if not emptied. I quickly signalled to him so he could help empty it as I had my hands full. He rushed over very frustrated, saying it was overflowing to which I calmly said “no it’s not”. This made him really angry as to him it obviously was overflowing whereas to me I was thinking ah yes caught it right in time, crisis averted! He found this to be unreasonably disagreeable and he was very upset with me. 

- We were walking down the stairs of his building to go out and grab some food. While walking down he goes “you’re going to get soaking wet” to which I responded “it’s not even raining!”. He said nothing at this point, until we walked outside and there was very light rain (nothing that requires much protection). He points out that it is in fact, raining. And then I said “It’s not reaaally…” and again, he found that to be needlessly disagreeable as it quite literally was. He took this as me trying to justify my initial comment when I said it wasn’t raining, and I wouldn’t just accept that yes it was raining. Not a lot, but definitely raining. 

Similar situations have happened quite frequently, and I fully acknowledge that it can be frustrating to have someone constantly saying no or disagreeing with you on minor things. It might be worth mentioning that he has ADHD and is on the spectrum, so he really just likes things being taken at face value and thinks very literally most of the time which is why I understand why my seemingly harmless disagreements can be frustrating. I don’t know how to even go about correcting this behaviour in myself, as it often is a knee-jerk reaction and I don’t think before I speak. He says I didn’t used to be like this before (we were broken up for some time so maybe something changed in me while we were apart?) but it’s causing quite a bit of tension between us and I want to try to better myself. But I also don’t want to feel nervous and tense whenever I’m speaking to him at the risk of saying the wrong thing because I usually am just very comfortable saying whatever is on my mind when I’m around him and don’t want to lose that element of our otherwise lovely relationship.

# Essential Gear for a Minimal Gravel S24O Adventure

The S24O trip is perfect for beginners or those looking to squeeze in a quick adventure mid-week or over the weekend. This minimalist approach focuses on carrying just what you need for a comfortable overnight experience in nature.

# Handlebar Roll Organization

Your handlebar roll should contain your sleep system, including:

* A compact sleeping bag or quilt for temperature-appropriate comfort
* A lightweight sleeping pad for insulation and cushioning
* A packable pillow for proper rest

# Fork Cargo Cage Setup

Utilize your fork cargo cages for camp essentials:

* Compact shelter (tent)
* Cooking system (Jetboil and fuel)
* Morning essentials (instant coffee and cup)

# Seat Pack Contents

The seat pack carries your clothing layers:

* Base layers (shorts, t-shirt, socks)
* Insulation layers (pants, jacket)
* Weather protection (hat/beanie)
* Quick-dry towel for moisture management

# Frame Cargo Storage

Your frame cargo area holds the bulk of your gear:

* Hydration (water)
* Nutrition (dinner, breakfast, snacks)
* Electronics (headphones, battery, headlamp)
* Tools and repair kit (Leatherman, bike tools)
* Personal care (bug spray, sunscreen, toiletries)
* Security (bike lock)

# Top Tube Bag Essentials

Keep frequently accessed items in your top tube bag:

* Trail snacks
* Bike pump
* Hand sanitizer

# And here is a quick list you can copy/paste into your notes app so you can keep track of what is packed!

Of course, your setup may differ, but all the essentials are listed so you can quickly rearrange things based on your bags, cargo cages, etc.

# Hotel Touring: A Different Approach to Bikepacking

Hotel touring combines the joy of long-distance cycling with the comfort of proper accommodation. This setup prioritizes riding efficiency and comfort while eliminating camping gear.

# Optimized Fork Storage

* Dedicated hydration storage with 1.5L capacity on each side

# Expanded Seat Pack

Focus on clothing management:

* Multiple riding outfits (shorts, shirts, socks)
   * I like to be able to switch off clothes day to day and do a little sink wash of the stinky stuff and let them dry overnight
* Off-bike comfort wear (light pants, shorts for sleeping)
* Weather protection (light jacket, long sleeve)
* Accessories (extra gloves, hat, handkerchief)

# Comprehensive Frame Bag

Your frame bag becomes command central:

* Electronics (fast chargers, battery)
* Footwear (casual shoes)
   * I only use flat pedals so I typically just use my biking shoes, but some may want to opt for something comfier!
* Extended repair kit (spokes, cables, brake pads)
* Tool collection (bike tools, Leatherman, pump)
* Personal care items (chamois butter, toiletries)
* Emergency supplies (first aid kit, extra straps)

# Accessible Top Tube Bag

Keep essentials within reach:

* Personal items (phone, wallet, lip balm)
* Emergency nutrition (Red Bull, Nuun tablets)
* Various snacks for sustained energy

# And here is a quick list you can copy/paste into your notes app so you can keep track of what is packed!

Of course, your setup may differ, but all the essentials are listed so you can quickly rearrange things based on your bags, cargo cages, etc.

# Key Differences and Considerations

The main distinction between these setups lies in their intended use. The S24O list prioritizes self-sufficiency with camping gear, while the hotel touring list focuses on extended riding comfort and mechanical preparedness. Both lists emphasize the importance of proper hydration, nutrition, and basic repair capabilities.

# Tips for Success

1. Test your packing setup before any major trip
2. Adjust quantities based on trip duration
3. Consider weather conditions when selecting clothing
4. Always carry basic tools regardless of trip length
5. Pack items you need frequent access to in easily reachable locations

Remember, these lists serve as starting points - modify them based on your specific needs, riding style, and destination. The key to successful bikepacking is finding the right balance between being prepared and packing light.

Whether you're heading out for a quick overnight adventure or planning an extended hotel tour, proper gear organization will enhance your bikepacking experience. Start with these lists and adapt them to create your perfect setup.",4,1739127610.0,bikepacking,0,1.0,False

Also upgrading from a Profitec Go to a Lelit Bianca v3. My top two grinder choices at the moment are the Fiorenzato AllGround Sense, and the Lagom P64.

I am used to, and am fine with continuing with the single-dose workflow. Have to admit that I am kind of attracted to the simplicity of a grind-by weight grinder. Grind, WDT, Tamp, Pull... Sounds nice, if it's accurate and consistent enough. AllGround Sense is also a good bit more affordable, and seems quite easy to clean and maintain.

Is there really a notable improvement in the grind quality going from the Fiorenzato to the Lagom P64?

Would swapping out the burrs in the Fiorenzato make up for some of that difference?

Open to suggestions on other grinders as well. Thanks!

Sounds like fun butttt it’s all the steps involved that make my brain shut down and say ‘nope’. I love socializing, going places, doing things.. but spontaneity makes it easier.

I titrated up every month and have been on 15mg now for 8 weeks. I iterated up in hopes of finally feeling the hunger suppression everyone else is feeling and rapid weight loss but instead I’m feeling hungrier than ever these past 2/3 weeks. I even had my doctor give me a metformin prescription thinking i need extra help due to my insulin resistance. 

 I’m now realizing that even though I never had major suppression, I had some and was eating less and able to have normal hunger without being ravenous on lower doses. Now these past 3 weeks I’m ravenous and shaky if I don’t eat soon enough. For example I ate a balanced breakfast this morning and I’m starving already and thinking about lunch and how soon I can eat. After some research I’m wondering if 15mg is giving me hypoglycemia?

Also been needing to sleep in the middle of the day and my sleep has gotten worse. Has anyone experienced this on 15mg and successfully gone back down? If so what dose did you settle on?

Whether it’s an early morning grind for a fresh pour-over or a late-night experiment with spice blends, this grinder has certainly been put through its paces in my kitchen. Let me break it down for you.

Aesthetically, the design of this grinder is both compact and modern. The slim profile means it doesn’t hog counter space, which is a blessing in my cluttered kitchen. Its gray, Eurocentric styling is subtle but sophisticated enough that I don’t mind leaving it out in the open. The build quality, however, is where I was initially skeptical. Weighing just over a pound, it felt lightweight, but the durable stainless-steel blades and high-quality plastic body quickly reassured me. This machine is built to last, as promised by Mueller’s reputation. That said, the attached power cord could use some improvement; its tendency to twist and lack of storage options was a minor inconvenience.

[Check Mueller MLR010556N price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/mueller-mlr010556n-coffee-grinder-review-b08wc6rhq7/)

When it comes to **grinding performance**, this grinder delivers. I’m a bit of a coffee snob and enjoy experimenting with different brews—French press, espresso, Turkish coffee—you name it. The Mueller grinder handles it all. It pulverizes beans into a fine powder in under 30 seconds or leaves them coarse for a French press with equal ease. The consistency is impressive for a blade grinder, though it’s worth noting that burr grinders still edge it out in precision. But for the price and convenience, this little device does the job admirably.

The **grinding mechanism** is straightforward: stainless-steel blades powered by a robust motor. While blade grinders often get a bad rap for inconsistency, this one seems to have addressed that issue better than most others I’ve owned. However, if you’re a purist who demands the ultimate precision for espresso, you might consider investing in a burr grinder instead.

Usability is another area where the Mueller grinder shines. It’s as simple as it gets—add your beans, pop on the lid, press the button, and you’re off. Adjusting the grind size is a matter of timing. Hold the button longer for finer grinds or pulse it for coarser textures. While this manual method of controlling grind size works fine for me, I can see how some might miss preset grind settings. The lid, doubling as a measuring cup, is a thoughtful touch, though cleaning it after grinding can be tricky with finer powders.

The **capacity** is just right for personal use. It comfortably holds enough beans for 2-3 cups of coffee, which suits my needs. If you’re brewing for a crowd, you may find yourself refilling it multiple times, but it works well for small households or solo coffee enthusiasts like myself. Speed-wise, it’s a beast; grinding a full batch takes less than half a minute, and it’s relatively quiet compared to other models I’ve tried.

**Pros:**

* Compact and stylish design that fits any kitchen.
* Consistent grind quality for various brewing styles.
* Simple and intuitive to use, with a quick grinding process.
* Durable stainless-steel blades for long-term reliability.
* Affordable compared to high-end burr grinders.

**Cons:**

* The power cord can twist and lacks storage options.
* Cleaning the grinding chamber can be challenging, especially for fine grinds.
* No preset grind size settings—timing control may not suit everyone.
* Limited capacity for large batches of coffee or spices.
* Some users reported occasional overheating if used continuously.

**Comparison to Competitors**

I’ve owned a few coffee grinders over the years, so naturally, I compared the Mueller MLR010556N to my previous Mr. Coffee IDS77-RB and a basic Krups blade grinder. The Mueller outperforms both in consistency and speed. The Mr. Coffee grinder had more features, like coarseness settings, but felt cheaper in build quality and was significantly noisier. The Krups grinder, on the other hand, was slower and less efficient at creating uniform grinds. That said, neither competitor matched Mueller’s stylish design or compact size, making it a better fit for small kitchens.

Compared to burr grinders like the Cuisinart DBM-8, the Mueller falls short in precision and grind size control. Burr grinders are superior for espresso aficionados, but they’re bulkier, noisier, and come with a higher price tag. If you’re seeking an affordable, efficient blade grinder for everyday use, Mueller’s offering is a strong contender.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

The affordability of this grinder is one of its standout features. High-quality burr grinders can set you back significantly, but this model offers a budget-friendly alternative without sacrificing too much in performance. For casual coffee drinkers or those just delving into home brewing, the Mueller MLR010556N is worth the investment. It’s not without its flaws, but the combination of durability, speed, and grind consistency makes it a great value for the price.

**Features and Settings**

This grinder is designed with simplicity in mind. It operates with a single button for controlling grinding time. The stainless-steel blades are built for efficiency, handling not just coffee beans but also spices, herbs, and even grains. I occasionally use it for grinding cumin seeds or making powdered sugar, and it performs admirably. While the grinding chamber isn’t removable, the lid can be easily washed, which helps with maintenance.

One notable feature is its quiet operation, a rare find in budget grinders. I can use it early in the morning without waking up the entire household. It’s also equipped with safety features to prevent the motor from overheating, though continuous usage can still lead to minor heating issues.

So last month I realised I was Demiromantic for one of my friends (Demiromantic=you only feel romantic attraction to like 1 or 2 people), she's always meant the world to me honestly. She's the reason why I realised people actually cared about me, and whenever I saw her I was generally just in a better mood than usual.

On Christmas Eve night I was hit by a pretty bad stomach bug (thanks Santa) and that has killed me for the past month and a half (it's gone now btw, I'm just experiencing the after-effects of it). However, whenever I started thinking about her I felt alright (still do), and one day I walked into school, saw her, and I found her way more pretty than usual (I always found her cute now that I think about it). After talking to some people about it and listening to CUPID by Fifty Fifty like 100 times I realised that I was Demiromantic for her.

I came out to her last week on Monday, and the next day she pulled me aside and told me that she would love to go on a few dates before like actually being in a relationship with me (a situationship basically). We plan a date on Saturday, we go get a coffee and walk around town. Yay I'm going on my first date! Saturday arrives and we meet up at a Costa and go to this other coffee place she likes called Kaplicino (Might have got that horribly wrong, ordered a coffee even though I don't like coffee for some reason don't ask me why I have no idea, left the worst feeling in my throat yipee) and then we walked around town.

I bought some decaf and am doing a little half-caf mix, and he thought that was a good opportunity to remind me that decaf still has some caffeine in it. 🙄 Yesterday at Costco he told me I wasn't allowed to eat a hotdog and I almost slapped him lol. When I told him I could have hotdogs as long as they were heated up, he said ""oh okay, I didn't know"" like, EXACTLY, you *don't know* so stop trying to police me!!

Right now my only symptoms are sore boobs, some cramping, and the nose of a bloodhound that makes it difficult to eat ANYTHING, so it's especially frustrating to be told not to eat the few things that are appetizing to me.

X and I have been best friends for over 15 years now. Y came into the picture maybe 6 years ago, through me. 

When we first all started hanging out it was always together, in a 3. But recently I've noticed that they seem to be excluding me, and I'd like to think it's not on purpose but I'm just not sure. 

On the off chance we do all meet up together, Y tries their hardest to hold all of X's attention and completely ignore me. Say we're walking somewhere, Y will be walking with X and almost whispering, whilst I am forced to either walk behind or in front because there is not enough room on the pavement. If I try to join the conversation or speak to them, it's almost like they just don't hear me speak. I often come away from these meetings feeling dejected and upset. 

Y has started inviting X exclusively to their house. They do not discuss this in the group chat so I am not aware until X usually mentions it in a passing comment. I am always up for going to Y's house to hang out. Y will point blank refuse to come to mine. 

In the past I have asked why I have not been invited to these hang outs, and Y has said things like ""you'd just be bored"" or ""we're working on projects"". Y started a podcast and initially invited me to do it with them. I said yes. Now Y only does the podcast with X and there is no further mention of me ever being involved. 

I am going through an extremely rough patch right now. My mental health is at an all time low, I'm off sick from work and more than anything I feel so *lonely*. Y knows this, I have told Y everything. X knows to a degree but they are not the best person to lean on so I don't go into detail. A simple meet up for coffee would do the world of good, but when I try to arrange something like this Y will cancel last minute, only to be seeing X without me the very next day. 

I would like to confront them and ask why they are doing this to me, but a small part of me still thinks this could be completely innocent. I really don't want to deal with the fall out that will ensue.

Since my last post about Etihad Business Class got some interest, I thought I’d share my experience flying Air India Business Class to Mauritius. This was on AI2241, operated by a Vistara aircraft.

The Good:
	•	Seats: Comfortable, fully lie-flat, which made for decent rest.
	•	Politeness: The crew was courteous throughout the flight.

The Not-So-Good:
	•	Cleanliness: Could’ve been better—felt like the cabin needed a more thorough refresh. Simple things like the seat being little dirty. 
	•	Food: Disappointing. I grabbed a sandwich before sleeping, and it was literally just capsicum and bread—nothing else. I would have complained even if I was in economy. 
	•	Service: While polite, the service was slow. Response times for simple requests like clearing trays or getting a coffee were longer than expected.

That said, it was still better than Air Mauritius, which I’ve been flying annually for the past 7 years. But after this, I think I’m officially a Vistara/AIr India only person whenever possible when flying to Mauritius. I go atleast twice a year. 

Oh, and before anyone asks—yes, I changed into my shorts when I boarded so I could pass out comfortably, went straight to the marina after I landed and onto a boat (tiring holiday)!

Sometimes when I’m sitting there not talking to her to see what she does, she just keep talking. 

Recently after asking how my weekend was, I said I went out with my friends, and she said she went to see a show on her own, as she didn’t have anyone to go with. She said she hated the interval because she had nobody to talk to. 

3 of my female friends have told me that I should have asked her out at that point, but all the stuff I’ve read online that you shouldn’t ask people out at work, especially baristas, as they are paid to be nice to you, so I didn’t. 

I’m in the UK so we don’t have tipping culture, and I’ve never once tipped since I’ve been going in there. I don’t want to make her feel awkward if she says no, and of course I know I won’t be able go in there again if she says no. 

There’s just something that feels like if we met in any other setting I would have asked her out ages ago. Maybe she’s just being a nice person. ",1,1739126094.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

1illhh5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1illhh5,Trip Back to This Mini’s New Home,"I purchased this 2020 Mini SE from a dealer in Findlay, OH. I live in Midland, MI, 210 miles north. This is my first Mini and my first EV. Needless to say, I was a little nervous driving an EV that distance considering its range rating of 100 miles, give or take.

My daughter rode down with me and followed me back in my 2010 Honda Insight (also purchased used with low miles,) sporting over 238,000 miles currently. 

I’d downloaded lots of charging station apps as well as the ABRP routing app. I had my stops planned out ahead of time.

I found that in the 25° F weather, the predicted range was right about 80-82 miles. The predictions were pretty accurate. I put the SE in Green mode and tried to stay right at the posted speed limit. The cruise control is touchy and I’m getting used to the various intervals based on how hard to press the up and down buttons. But it held the speed pretty steady. 

First charging stop was at a ChargePoint charger in Dundee. Used the app to get started and then went off with my daughter to get lunch. I followed the charging progress on the Mini app. By the time we were done, the charge was over 90% and I was ready to get back on the road. But, I couldn’t figure out how to stop the charging session. I went through the menus on the charger and on the app and never did figure it out. 🤷‍♂️

The next stop was south of the Flint airport, at a Red E charger. This one you could just use a credit card. We found a coffee shop near by and I checked email and did a little work. Was able to easily end the session on the Red E charger’s screen. A red Mach E had pulled up to the other charger in the meantime (appropriate.)

The last leg was to home, but as I haven’t yet installed a charger of any kind, my plan was to stop at some newly installed chargers in my town to top up. Arrived with 23% charge. But I was never able to get the Shell Recharge station to work for me. Tried two different chargers with no success. Luckily I was only a few miles from home and made it back easily. I pulled into the garage and used the portable level 1 charger to recharge over night. 

Overall, I’m thrilled with the car. It’s back outside (my wife’s Prius C gets the garage), now with 4” of snow. Can’t wait to get it out again when the roads are clear of snow and ice.

1illhg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/service_dogs/comments/1illhg4/wins_and_setbacks_in_nyc/,wins and setbacks ·in NYC·,"my service dog and I just completed a trip to NYC from suburban Midwest Ohio a couple weeks ago and I just want to share some wins and setbacks for our team! 

**Wins:**

- she took on Madison Square Garden like a champ. so many people and she was totally unfazed and focused. we were supposed to have a front row, but an additional row was added in front of us without notifying me (we were in contact with accessibility weeks before) so she had very little space. MSG tried moving us up high into the bowl as a solution and i declined. she just slept through most of the show, only popping up when the pyrotechnics went off. '

- she ignored many other dogs that were poorly behaved and trained.

- she only had to alert and couple times, but she did very well with that and with her crowd control tasks. 

- we attended a stage door after a show and it was very cramped. I almost bailed bc I didn't want to put her in danger, but the people around us were so courteous and made a little bubble for us, and she was just vibing.

- we had amazing accessibility provided by The Escape Game, an escape room. they let us have our own room, and were overall very sweet and respectful to her. she slept as we solved puzzles (we escaped!)

- she rode the subway for the first time and did very well! she doesn't love things that move (cars, planes, etc) and that stands true for subways but she was very good about it. 

- she did so many escalators like a pro! many people commented on how they've never seen a dog do an escalator and they loved her little hop to get off. 

**Setbacks:**

- she has a potty command, but I never considered that I've only given it to her on grass. she DID NOT want to go on the sidewalk or concrete anywhere, and there were no actual grass patches near where we were staying. I thought that the green marks on Google maps would be grass, but every single one was a concrete park/patch. She held her bladder and bowels for far too long, and she did end up having 2 pee accidents. I can't blame her, and I know what to work on. this one is hard for me because I don't want her to normally go on concrete in our home town. 

- I had gotten a little pop up crate so I could leave her in the Airbnb to just go across the street to grab food and coffee to go, and I assumed the little bit of practice we did at home with it was enough. it wasn't! I ended up leaving her for about 30 minutes and when I got back she had rolled across the room and had one of her few accidents 😐 poor girl. this was also my fault, not hers. if I travel again and need something like that, I will do much more practice with it at home and do some warm ups at the new place, too. 

- like I said before, she doesn't like things that move, and on the plane, she did struggle a bit with nerves. these were only her third and fourth flights. she wasn't whining or anything, but she was shaking during take-off, and did look to the person next to me for comfort and couple times 🙈 thankfully my dear partners were more than understanding and helpful. I figured out what she needed during the fight home (a barrage of treats!) and I think her ears were probably uncomfortable because after chewing a bit she settled.

Mixed:
- This is both a win and a small setback lol. after stage door, we actually got to meet three of the cast members just out on the street. this was extremely exciting for me, and they were excited because they knew there was a service dog dressed up for the show (I sewed her an outfit that corresponded to the show, and they signed her vest at stage door). I gave her the free command so they could love on her, but she ended up confused because she knows when she's ""in uniform"" she's working and Mom's heart was racing. she stayed very calm and well behaved and loved the attention, but also ended up peeing in front of them without a command. But, again, she had been holding it for a very long time because she doesn't like to pee without grass. I confused her in my excitement.


I call these ""setbacks"" instead of losses because everything that went ""wrong"" was my fault and honestly, we were in a completely different environment than we'd ever been in before so i give us some grace. I'm not even sure setback is the right word to be honest, because the whole trip was a resounding win. I thought I'd share the good and bad though to give some insight to other teams!

1illf1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1illf1k/i_tested_laughland_teeth_whitening_heres_what/,I Tested Laughland Teeth Whitening – Here’s What Happened in 6 Days,"Teeth whitening has always been something I wanted to try, but I was never sure if at-home kits actually worked. I drink coffee daily, and over time, my teeth started looking dull. I tried whitening toothpaste (did nothing) and strips (caused too much sensitivity), so I figured I’d look for something better.

That’s when I came across **Laughland teeth whitening**. What caught my attention was that it uses **dentist-formulated gel** and an **LED mouthpiece**—something that seemed a step above the drugstore options. I figured it was worth a shot, so I ordered it and tested it for six days. Here’s how it went.

# What’s in the Laughland Kit?

When my kit arrived, I was happy to see it was **simple and easy to use**. Inside the box:

✔ **Whitening Gel Pens** – Just twist and apply. No mess, no hassle.  
✔ **LED Mouthpiece** – Activates the gel for better, faster results.  
✔ **Clear Instructions** – No confusion, just straightforward steps.

The packaging was sleek and felt well put together. No unnecessary extras, just exactly what you need.

# How to Use Laughland Teeth Whitening

Each whitening session takes just **10 minutes**—quick enough to fit into a busy day. Here’s the process:

1. **Brush & Dry Your Teeth** – Dry teeth help the gel adhere better.
2. **Apply the Gel** – Use the pen to evenly coat your teeth.
3. **Insert the LED Mouthpiece** – Turn it on and let it work for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse & Clean** – When the timer is up, rinse your mouth and clean the mouthpiece.

It was **super easy**, and since it only takes 10 minutes, I did it while watching Netflix.

# My Results After 6 Days

* **Day 1:** No instant results, but my teeth felt really fresh and clean.
* **Day 3:** I started noticing a difference, especially in areas where coffee stains had built up.
* **Day 6:** My teeth were **6-7 shades whiter**, and the results were **even and natural**—not fake or overly bright.

The **best part? No sensitivity.** I was expecting some discomfort, but I didn’t feel any pain during or after the sessions.

# What Makes Laughland Stand Out?

1. **Dentist-Formulated Gel** – Designed to lift stains without harming enamel.
2. **LED Light Activation** – Helps the gel penetrate deeper for better results.
3. **Temperature-Controlled Formula** – The gel stays potent, unlike some products that degrade over time.

**Want to check it out? Find more info** [**here**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)**.**

# How Does It Compare to Other Whitening Products?

* **Whitening Strips** – Work, but they’re uneven and made my teeth super sensitive.
* **Whitening Toothpaste** – Good for maintaining whiteness but doesn’t actually whiten deeply.
* **Professional Whitening** – Expensive and can leave your teeth feeling sensitive for days.

Laughland was **the best balance**—affordable, effective, and no pain.

# FAQs About Laughland Teeth Whitening

1. **Does it damage enamel?** – No, the gel is formulated to be gentle but effective.
2. **Does it work on deep stains?** – Yes, even on older stains from coffee and tea.
3. **How long do the results last?** – Avoiding staining foods helps maintain results for months.

# Tips for the Best Results

✔ **Use it daily** – Stick to the full 6-day cycle for the best outcome.  
✔ **Avoid staining foods** – Cut back on coffee, tea, and wine while whitening.  
✔ **Keep up with oral hygiene** – Brush and floss daily to help maintain results.

# Final Thoughts – Is Laughland Worth It?

For me, **Laughland teeth whitening** worked exactly as advertised. It was easy, painless, and delivered **noticeable results** in less than a week. My teeth looked **brighter but still natural**, and I didn’t have to deal with sensitivity.

If you’ve been hesitant about at-home whitening because of sensitivity or weak results, this might be worth trying. It’s not a **one-day fix**, but after **six days**, I saw a clear improvement.

Hi, I'm 19F, from the UK and I have chronic fatigue syndrome. I've had it since I was 12 but it has gotten significantly worse this past year to the point my life is very limited. My mental health is suffering too as due to the worsening of my physical capabilities, I struggle to get out and can usually only manage 1 outing a week, not including appointments. I cannot drive (or learn to drive), work or walk/stand up for longer than a couple of minutes. My parents care for me but there's only so much they can do and most days I neglect personal care such as brushing my teeth and spend most of my day in bed. I also have other issues, such as ASD and mental health conditions, which make it hard to access the community.

I've been considering the possibility of getting a PA to help me once or twice a week. The tasks I want help with are:

- assistance with getting ready: making sure I do the non-negotionables (shower if I haven't managed to have one recently, brush teeth) and possibly helping with getting changed or choosing what to wear. I don't need *physical* help to get changed but I may need someone to help me collect clothes. Washing my hair for me if I don't have the energy to shower.
- transporting me and my wheelchair into town so I can do shopping and/or go out for coffee, or to go for a day out at a wheelchair accessible venue - not being able to do these things is what's making me feel so low. At the moment the only time I can get out is when my parents are not busy and it's difficult to bring my wheelchair so I usually have to use my stick which means I can't go out for long
- helping me get ready for bed in the evening - if I've been out and I'm exhausted I often don't have the energy to get changed into bed clothes or brush my teeth so I might need help with this.

There might be other tasks that I can't think of right now (brain fog) It would also be a form of respite for my parents and will give me more of a sense of autonomy and independence (even though that sounds counterintuitive) because I won't have to rely on my parents. I want to feel like an adult who can choose where they go!!

Does anyone else have any experience or advice about hiring a PA to help with CFS? Do you think it would be a reasonable path to go down?

1illda6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mounjaro/comments/1illda6/from_slow_responder_to_fast_responder/,From Slow responder to fast responder,"I started Monjouro (MJ) in August 2024 and lost only 20 lbs from August through November. In December, I didn’t lose any weight at all. Then, in January, I suddenly dropped 12 lbs in just one month.

Here’s my weight loss breakdown:

* **August (2.5mg):** \-9 lbs
* **September (5mg):** \-7 lbs
* **October (7.5mg):** \-3 lbs
* **November (7.5mg):** \-1 lb
* **December (10mg):** 0 lbs
* **January (10mg):** \-12 lbs

*(P.S. My bloodwork at the 3-month mark showed great results!)*

# What I Changed:

1️⃣ **I Stopped Focusing on Weight Loss**  
This was tough, but I convinced myself to shift my focus to overall health instead of the scale. Accepting slow progress and occasional stalls made a huge difference in my mindset.

2️⃣ **I Prioritized Movement**  
I committed to walking **30 minutes every morning** and **another 30 minutes every other evening**, no matter what. I also strength-trained **2-3 times per week** using dumbbells at home with simple YouTube workouts—nothing complicated!

3️⃣ **I Stopped Counting Calories**  
Instead, I focused on **water intake and protein**. I still eat carbs, but in small portions. For example, if I want ice cream, I’ll have **two spoonfuls** instead of two bowls (which I used to do before MJ!).

4️⃣ **I Managed Stress More Actively**  
Since I have **rheumatoid arthritis (RA)**, I realized my body reacts to stress even when I don’t feel stressed. To help, I incorporated:  
✔️ Daily walks  
✔️ Sun-gazing  
✔️ Cutting out coffee  
✔️ Taking adaptogens as needed

5️⃣ **I Quit My Daily “Profee” (Protein Coffee)**  
Instead of coffee, I now drink herbal teas, which has been a great swap.

6️⃣ **I Stayed Consistent with Supplements**  
I take a daily regimen of supplements tailored to my personal needs, and consistency has been key.

I’m sharing this to encourage anyone feeling frustrated or discouraged by slow progress. I can’t say if **one** of these changes made the difference or if it was **all of them combined**, but something worked—so I’m sticking with it!

Stay the course, and if needed, tweak your routine. Progress may not always be linear, but **small, sustainable changes add up!** 💪🏽✨

However, I've been having problems for the last week.  During extraction, the pressure goes to maximum, but only a few dribbles come out.  Steam wand and water flow fine, and water flows fine with an empty portafilter (even the double wall).  With coffee in the basket (even the single wall) it's back to a dribble.  However, if I try again immediately (same coffee), sometimes I'll get a decent shot.  If not for the max pressure, I'd guess the pump. 


Things I've tried:
- Replaced the filter with a new OEM one. 
- Run a few rounds of descaling (I normally use filtered water and clean/descale when prompted). 
- Partially did assembled and removed houses and checked for scale buildup (nice found).
- Adjusted grind size (up and down), tamped much lighter than normal, single or double wall filters, different beans, ...

1ill781,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1ill781/day_1_of_my_first_solo_trip/,Day 1 of my first solo trip,"Too long of a post. Read it only if you really are able to. I don't seek inputs. Just wanted to post my thoughts somewhere.
.
.
A year after experiencing a heart-breaking fallout with my best friend of 6 years on a trip to literal heaven, I pulled myself up to go on a solo trip. I have never been on one and never thought I'll be able to do it. But as I approached the anniversary of the betrayal, i booked my tickets and stay on an impulse and stopped thinking about it. Booking all that was enough for me to think I have done a great job at being independent. I patted my back (in my mind) and thought to myself ""onward we go on our path to adulthood"".

However, as this trip came closer, i couldn't stop myself from thinking about her again. And also about him, who seemed like me, but was actually a wolf in sheep's clothing. I kept pushing the memory away. I kept getting the urge to call the guy who seemed like me. Who was brought onboard by her. Who was left with me when she abandoned the trip. Who turned weirded every time I said ""No"".

Anyway.
Eventually the day came. Yesterday I sat in a train and today I reached the place I was supposed to reach as per the booking I had made. I also took an auto and reached the place i would stay for the next 3 days as per the booking I had made weeks back on an impulse. My day was mostly spent in the train as it got late by 3.5 hours! I had mini anxiety attacks here and there. I cried because an online friend was upset with me which reminded me of the best friend who was also upset with me. 'How do I break things that i value the most?!' - i thought. But then my destination arrived. I had to move.

I reached the stay, didn't think much, rushed to take a bath. I couldn't wait longer to take off all the gunk I must have collected all over me. That's what my brain said, so it must be true. Who else can I trust on this? But me. Just me. All by myself. Eating a pasta with cold coffee. By myself in a cafe, supposedly filled with soli travellers who can network/socialize until their heart and stomach are filled up to the brim. But I picked the table in the corner, made myself smaller, sat down with my food and tried to behave as normally as I could. You know, how normal people behave? Look at the tv for a second, feign interest in cricket, then look at the couple sitting in front of you, reminds yourself that it's bad manners to stare, then look at your phone, realize their's nothing to look at, then look at your food, eat it clumsily, look at the tv, repeat the cycle. I felt depressed....slightly anxious. Called my mom. Asked for help. It was her anniversary, so she was getting ready to go out for dinner. How can I press her to give me more time? So i didn't say more. But then 5 minutes I called her again. I couldn't stop myself. I didn't know what to do. My mom talked to me for a little longer this time. And then I felt better. I said bye to her, paid the bill for the little food I ate, and thought of going outside. Here and there I loitered, I started thinking of an action plan....but then I suddenly met this person that I had talked to about the trip, he had made some friends for me, so I didn't had to work hard. (Let me be clear, these are just friends like people you know). Anyway. One of these friends is an introvert! Like a bigger introvert than me!! They made plans with me in it! And now my trip is no more a solo trip! I feel relieved....
But I also feel like I have lost. The objective was a solo trip. But then what is a solo trip? A 60+ year old friend I made said that solo trip only means that you travel to the destination solo. At the destination you make friends and plan your trip however you like. I want to think like that. But I am stuck with the thought that technically I am not doing a solo trip. But then these aren't my real friends either. And I made friends because of this guy I talked to for a minute. I feel relieved, but I do feel like I failed the objective and that I am cowardly and that i am a loser still. And that my life wouldn't change after this. It will remain the same, getting haunted by the ghost of the best friend who also wasn't a real friend.",1,1739125174.0,AutisticAdults,0,1.0,False

Making progress with some trial and error.  I am neither special nor interesting, but perhaps this will help someone else somehow.*

I have appreciated all of the posts I have read leading up to my surgery on Feb 6.  Ackknowleding that everyone's experience is different, it was still helpful to have some expectations and prepartion tips.

I am a healthy, active, 44yo male and was treated for Legg Perthese between the ages of 7-9.  I wore an Atlanta brace for 2 years and did regular physical therapy.  I was told that I would likely need a new hip by the time I was 40 but at 9yo, that sounded like a thousand years away.  I played ice hockey for 25+ years, avoided most running-based sports, but swam, surfed, snowboarded, and generally lived a normal lifestyle.  Over the past few years, I began noticing significant pain when doing work on the ground (autmotive, gardening, etc) or walking/hiking extensively, and I would pay for it over several days, even with NSAID treament.  I also noticed decreased range of motion and modifications I was unconsiously making each day.

During a routine physical last year, I took a set of films from 2008 for my GP to review.  His reaction was enough to convince me to pursue intervention.  His question was something along the lines of ""what are you doing and why are you doing this to yourself?""  I had become accustomed the pain and figured I was just supposed to deal with it for as long as possible. I trust my GP explicitly, and set up an appointment with the orthopaedic surgeon he recommended.  Doc said this surgeon is who will eventualluy do his knee, so that was a good enough push for me to pursue it.

From early September up until the day before surgery, I stuck to a workout routine to prepare myself physically and mentally.  Coincidentally, I decided to give up alcohol last march and to finally seek treatment for sleep apnea.  The timing of these events lined up nicely with the decision to pursue replacement and work through the recovery period.

I am not an axious person when it comes to medical procedures.  I am thankful to have access to the science and skilled practitioners.  However, I was certainl curious was to what my post-surgery days would look like.  7am call-time for surgery on Thursday,  complicated by an early morning ice storm.  Pre-op check-in started right at 7am and I sent my wife home.  We are only about 20min from the surgery center, and I did not see any sense in her sitting there all day.  Prep went fine, spinal took effect quickly and was a weird sensation.  I recall being wheeled into OR, rolling on my side, and then lights out.

Post-op recovery was typical and I felt alert fairly quickly.  Ran through some PT basics, used the restroom, left with the aid of a walker, and headed home.  I was on my couch by 3pm.

Post-op Day 1 - Friday

My wife went to work and my kids to school.  I showered myself before my wife left and she helped me downstairs.  That was struggle and a bit daunting looking down 16 hardwood stairs.  The couch was ok throughout the day, but not ideal.  My medication regiment consisted of baby aspirin, Valium, Oxycodone, Celebrex, Prilosec, a stool softener, and an anti-nausea treament.  Following all instructions directly, I was disppointed that I didn't feel much of any relief from the Oxy.  In fact, sciatica was causing me far more discomfort than anything else, making it difficult to walk, sleep, or move. My fluid intake was good, but I didn't have much of an appettite.  No noticeable swelling other than around the incision area, treated with ice throughout the day.  I thought perhaps I overdid it on Day 1, and deicided to hang in bed for most of Day 2.  I made an impulse buy on Amazon for a wedge pillow with 1-day delivery, and I'm glad iI did.  it's a game changer from a stack of random pillows or a husband pillow.

Post-op Day 2 - Saturday

Spent most of the day in bed with frequent walks to the restroom and stretching.  Felt brief moments of improvement, but the sciatica made for a tough day.  I adjusted doses of the Valium and Oxy, but coulnd't find a combination that worked.  Took another shower, headed to bed with a Valium/Oxy combo as well as an indica gummy.  Slept fairly well, but woke up to a very stiff knee and very tight quads on the operated leg.

Post-op Day 3 - Sunday

Feeling a bit frustrated, I was determined to find a way to get to the point where I figured I woud be by day 3.  I have been citing a positive healing mantra and remaining optimistic (it can't hurt!) but was feeling pretty disappointed.  I decided to swtich to Valium and Tylenol, even though I have always considered Tylenol to be worthless.  In addition, I decided to finally have a cup of coffee, even though some suggest that caffeine can impede healing - but so can being miserable!  The change in the way I felt and the way I was able to move was almost instant.  I went from being walker-reliant to feeling fairly confident getting around the house with just the cane.  I am icing and resting today with the goal of joining some friends to watch the Super Bowl tonight.

1ill4p3,https://www.reddit.com/r/anxiety_support/comments/1ill4p3/feeling_anxious_about_valentines_week_heres_how/,Feeling Anxious About Valentine’s Week? Here’s How to Get Through It Without Losing Your Mind,"Hey, you. Yes, you—the one feeling that familiar pit in your stomach as Valentine’s Day creeps closer. Maybe you’re single and dreading the endless posts of happy couples. Maybe you’re in a relationship but feel pressure to make it *perfect*. Or maybe, deep down, you just feel like you’re missing *something*, and you don’t even know what it is.  

I see you. And I know how much this week can mess with your head.  

### **Why Valentine’s Week Messes With Our Minds**  

Valentine’s Day isn’t just a day anymore—it’s a whole *week*. Seven days of constant reminders that love is everywhere… except, it feels, where *you* are.  

- **Social Media Distortion** – Perfectly curated photos of couples exchanging gifts, surprise proposals, grand gestures… all designed to make you feel like you’re missing out.  
- **Societal Pressure** – If you’re in a relationship, you’re expected to perform. If you’re single, you’re supposed to either celebrate it or be sad about it—no in-between.  
- **Comparison & Self-Worth** – Maybe you feel like you're not enough. Not *lovable* enough. Not *wanted* enough. Like something is fundamentally *wrong* with you.  

But let me stop you right there.  

### **The Psychological Game Valentine’s Week Plays on You**  

Your brain is wired to seek belonging. When you see people celebrating love, your subconscious whispers: *Why don’t I have that?* It convinces you that love equals worth, and if you don’t have a “Valentine’s moment,” you must be falling behind in life.  

But here’s the truth: **Valentine’s Day is a marketing strategy wrapped in red and pink.**  

It’s not a love test. It’s not proof of your value. It’s a billion-dollar industry designed to make you feel like you *need* to participate to be happy. And if you don’t, you’re supposed to feel like you’re failing.  

Guess what? You’re *not*.  

### **How to Take Your Power Back & Survive Valentine’s Week**  

So, how do you *actually* get through this week without spiraling into self-doubt and anxiety?  

#### **1. Reframe the Narrative**  
Instead of seeing this as a week to measure what you *lack*, see it as an opportunity to focus on what you *have*. Love isn’t just romantic—it’s in friendships, family, self-care, and even the little things you do for yourself every day.  

#### **2. Limit Social Media (Seriously, Do It)**  
You already know scrolling through Instagram or TikTok will make you feel worse. So why do it? Try a *social media detox* for a day or two. Focus on real life, not the filtered version of other people’s.  

#### **3. Do Something Just for You**  
Who says love has to be about another person? Take yourself out for coffee, buy yourself something nice, start a new hobby, or spend time with people who *actually* make you happy.  

#### **4. Talk About It**  
Feeling lonely? Anxious? Talk to someone. A friend, a therapist, even a Reddit stranger. The more you voice your feelings, the less power they have over you.  

#### **5. Remember: This Is Temporary**  
By February 15th, it’ll all be over. The posts will fade, the chocolates will go on clearance, and life will move on. So will you.  

### **Final Thoughts**  

If you’re struggling this week, I want you to know: **you are not alone.** Your worth isn’t defined by a relationship status, a gift, or a grand gesture.  

You are *enough*—just as you are.  

Now tell me—how are *you* feeling about Valentine’s Week? Let’s talk in the comments.",2,1739124996.0,anxiety_support,2,1.0,False

While looking for something I fell down the rabbit hole of espresso machines and I think I want to go this route.  I know Keurig and espresso machines are completely different, but this sets the bar for the quality of coffee we drink.  A big can of Hills Bros. has been the standard for us.  I had the Breville Bambino Plus in my shopping cart, of course have seen all sorts of recommendations.  It seems that the Bambino is fairly easy to use and relatively quick to brew so this drew me in.  

Now I think I have it narrowed down (I'm in the States):

\- De'Longhi La Specialista Arte Evo:  This one is on sale through Amazon for $499 which seems decent.  Should I stay away from built in grinders?  There's comments I've seen for both options.  If we don't get one with a grinder we most likely will get a cheap grinder.  How is De'Longhi quality?  Some say yes, some say no.  This seems to be the case for any product, coffee makers or not so this isn't surprising.  

  
\- Breville Bambino Plus:  Same price as the De'Longhi. Seems easy to work and quick.  

  
\- Turin Legato v2:  I ran across this one in a different post asking for recommendations.  Right around the same price as the others, but backordered until March.

While having a solid grasp of concepts and structure is essential, you’ve probably realized that knowledge alone isn’t enough to succeed. Your mental state during the exam—and even throughout your prep—plays a critical role in your performance.

One big hurdle we all face is test anxiety—an intricate mix of emotional, cognitive, and physiological responses to the pressure of a high-stakes exam. Almost all GMAT takers struggle with it—sometimes more than the test content itself. ***Every student I’ve spoken to has faced it in some way; heck, I’ve dealt with it myself.***

So, I thought I’d bring my research expertise into play and break it down: why it happens, how to gauge it, and what we can do to mitigate it.

*That said, this journey is deeply personal. If your anxiety feels overwhelming or clinical, I strongly encourage you to seek guidance from a diagnostic clinician.*

*\*Repost from* r/GMAT

# Why Test Anxiety Happens

Let’s break down why test anxiety occurs. It can be broadly categorized into the following:

**1. Fear of Failure**

* High expectations—whether self-imposed or from others—create immense pressure.
* Worrying about disappointing family, peers, or mentors makes the stakes feel impossibly high.
* The fear of perceived impacts on future opportunities amplifies this anxiety.

*A student once told me, “What if I fail? What if I don't get an MBA? I’ve never failed before—am I now a failure?” This fear often stems from the need to prove yourself to others. But let’s pause and think:* ***If an obscure exam is the biggest problem in your life, isn’t that a privilege in itself? Shifting your perspective to focus on your blessings can be immensely grounding.***

**2. Lack of Preparation**

* Incomplete study or last-minute cramming leads to feeling unprepared.
* Poor time management and inefficient techniques—like memorizing instead of understanding—are common problems. *You can memorize every question type and trick in the world, but can you recall them under pressure during the exam?*
* Think about when you’ve been most confident in client presentations—it’s likely when you had done all the prep work. The GMAT is no different.

**3. Past Negative Experiences and Cognitive Distortions**

Past failures or underperformance often fuel anxiety. Experiences like blanking out or scoring poorly can condition you to associate tests with stress.

Cognitive distortions play a big role:

* **Catastrophizing**: *“If I fail, my life is over.”*
* **Overgeneralization**: *“I always do badly on tests.”*
* **Black-and-white thinking**: *“If I don’t ace this, I’m not smart.”*

**4. Perfectionism and Unrealistic Expectations**

Fear of making mistakes or setting excessively high goals creates a pressure cooker of anxiety. Many students see anything less than a perfect score as failure—a mindset that’s both unsustainable and unhealthy.

**5. Lack of Familiarity with the Test Format**

Uncertainty about question types, timing, or difficulty levels adds to the stress. Not practicing under realistic conditions or understanding how adaptive testing works (as with the GMAT) leaves you unprepared.

**6. External Pressures and Comparisons**

Seeing peers excel while you struggle can feel demoralizing. The competitive nature of MBA applications only intensifies this pressure. Social media amplifies success stories, making you feel worse about your own challenges.

*Platforms like Reddit, for example, often highlight extremes—top scorers or those lamenting failure—which feeds into anxiety.*

**7. Sedentary Lifestyle and High Cortisol Levels**

A sedentary lifestyle contributes to higher cortisol levels, the body’s primary stress hormone, which exacerbates feelings of anxiety. Lack of physical activity disrupts sleep, impairs mood, and affects cognitive function, making it harder to focus during prep or on test day.

**8. Burnout and Overstudying**

Studying excessively without breaks leads to mental and physical exhaustion.

*Sleep deprivation—a common issue among test-takers—can impair cognitive function by up to 40%. Structuring your lifestyle and setting boundaries for study time are non-negotiable.*

**9. Physiological and Emotional Stress Responses**

Anxiety triggers physical symptoms like a racing heart, sweating, or shortness of breath. These responses often override rational thinking, making it difficult to concentrate.

Managing these factors starts with understanding what drives your anxiety. Once you identify the triggers, you can take intentional steps to mitigate them

# How to Gauge Your Anxiety Levels

Understanding the intensity of your anxiety is the first step to managing it effectively. Here are practical ways to assess your test anxiety:

**1. Reflect on Symptoms**

Take a moment to observe how anxiety shows up for you:

* **Emotional:** Do you feel overwhelmed, excessively worried, or unusually irritable?
* **Cognitive:** Are you struggling to focus, overthinking scenarios, or stuck in a loop of negative thoughts?
* **Physical:** Do you notice headaches, sweating, rapid heartbeats, or a feeling of tightness in your chest?

**2. Use an Anxiety Scale & Track Physiological Signs**

Utilize tools like the **Westside Test Anxiety Scale** or the **Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)** to rate your symptoms. These scales can help you classify your anxiety level as minimal, moderate, high, or severe.

Consider using smartwatches or stress-monitoring apps to measure metrics like your resting heart rate. Anxiety often elevates these levels, making them a helpful indicator of how your body is responding to stress.

**3. Journal Your Triggers and Use a DIY Anxiety Check**

Keep a journal to document anxious moments and their triggers. For example: *“Felt nervous after a low practice test score”* or *“Heart raced when reviewing quantitative concepts.”* Identifying patterns can help you understand what needs attention.

Additionally, you can do a **DIY Anxiety Check** by rating the following statements from 1 (Never) to 5 (Always):^(\*Questions are based on two main dimensions from the) \*\*^(Multidimensional Theory of Anxiety)\*\*^(:)**^(Cognitive Anxiety & Somatic Anxiety)**

1. I worry excessively about the outcome of tests.
2. My heart races before studying or testing.
3. I avoid preparing because I feel overwhelmed.
4. I struggle to retain information due to constant worry.
5. I feel my performance doesn’t reflect my abilities.

**Score Interpretation:**

* **5–10:** Minimal Anxiety
* **11–15:** Moderate Anxiety
* **16–20:** High Anxiety
* **21–25:** Severe Anxiety

*I had students take a weekly DIY test, tracking and journaling their anxiety levels. As expected, anxiety increased as the exam approached, but with effective management, they were able to bring it down.*

# How to Mitigate Test Anxiety

Now that we understand how to gauge them - lets talk about few things which we can do to mitigate any test anxiety we may have.

**1. Reframe Your Mindset: Shift from Fear to Challenge**

* **Adopt a Growth Mindset:** Mistakes are learning opportunities, not failures. Focus on progress, not perfection.
* **Normalize Anxiety:** Even top scorers feel test anxiety. Reframe it as excitement—your body is preparing to perform.
* **Replace Negative Thoughts with Affirmations:**
   * Instead of *“I’m bad at tests,”* say *“I’m improving with practice.”*
   * Instead of *“If I fail, my life is over,”* say *“This is just one step in my journey.”*

**2. Prepare Smarter, Not Harder**

* **Simulate Real Test Conditions:** Take timed, adaptive practice tests to build endurance and get used to GMAT dynamics. Take practice tests away from home so you learn to cope with the challenges of a foreign environment.
* **Optimize Study Techniques:**
   * Use **active recall** and **spaced repetition** to reinforce concepts.
   * Develop **strategic elimination** and **decision-making skills** to work efficiently under pressure.

**3. Manage Physical & Emotional Stress**

* **Mindfulness & Breathing:** Try box breathing—inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 4.
* **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR):** Tense and release each muscle group to relieve tension.
* **Exercise & Nutrition:** Prioritize hydration, avoid caffeine overload, and opt for **low-intensity, longer workouts** over short, high-intensity ones.

**4. Build Confidence Through Small Wins**

* **Keep a Success Journal:** After each study session, jot down one thing that went well.
* **Celebrate Progress:** Focus on incremental improvements—every step forward counts.

**5. Stay Calm During the Exam**

* Use the **5-4-3-2-1 grounding method:** Name 5 things you see, 4 you hear, 3 you can touch, 2 you smell, and 1 you taste.
* Take **one slow breath** before tackling a tough question.
* If overwhelmed, **pause for 30 seconds**—doodle, reflect on life, or think about family. A mental reset can bring fresh perspective.

By learning to gauge your anxiety and applying these strategies, you’ll not only manage test stress but also build resilience for future challenges. Remember: Anxiety is just a sign that you care.

# Test Day Game Plan: Stay in Control

**Don’t Let Anything Affect You.** Your focus is your power—nothing else matters today.

**1. If You’re Testing at a Center:**

* **Book Smart:** Schedule your exam so you have at least **3 hours after waking up** before heading out.
* **Fuel Right:** Stick to a **bland, reliable breakfast**—**today is not the day to experiment.** Coffee + slow-release energy foods (bananas, eggs, oats) will keep you steady.
* **Move Your Body:** Go for a run in the morning or do a quick workout to channel that pumped-up energy.
* **Avoid Driving:** Take a cab or have someone drop you off. You don’t need that extra stress.
* **Arrive 45 Minutes Early:** Find a **quiet spot or a nearby coffee shop** and warm up with **10-15 easy-to-medium Quant & CR questions**—**don’t check answers.** The GMAT’s algorithm makes the first few questions count, so the **exam should not be your first problem of the day.**
* **Ignore the Test Center Drama:** The registration process is **exhausting**, and test center staff can be… well, let’s just say *power-hungry*. Don’t let their attitude throw you off. Stay polite, stay detached, and focus on your game.

I'm not exactly new to the idea of MRE's, but I am terrible at doing things like calorie counting(or even just guessing what I need) I made some MRE's a few years ago for a vacation, and it was pretty good. Everything held up well, so I think I selected the right items. I just lost the list I had of products I bought.

Now I'm planning out a vacation for me and a couple of friends, and I want the first day to be as easy as possible(without going to restaurants etc). Everyone gets two packs(first day + emergency ration) and I will ask them in advance about dietary restrictions and preferences. Now I just need to select the products I will be including. I'm focussing on a breakfast and a main dish, and a lot of small snacks. So far, the list looks a bit like this:

1 whole dried saucage, local
A few bites(7 grams) of beef jerky
1 can of fish(salmon, tuna, sardines or mackerel)
1 can of meat(for the main dish)

3 small bags of different nut mixes
1 bag with an assortment of dried fruits/berries
1 bag M&M's or skittles
2 bars(clif, nature valley etc)

2 travel/kid/cafe-size packs of each:
- Jam
- PB
- Honey
- Raisins
- Salt/Pepper
- Buillon cubes
3 packs of butter for all purposes

Some oatmeal or wholegrain pancake mix.

One bag of (wholegrain) rice or macaroni with a powder sauce mix mixed into it, aswell as some dried fungi and veggies. Should make for a very quick and easy meal.

A few extras:
3 sachets of instant coffee with milk and sugar separate
One or two sachets cup-a-soup(or cheap equivalent)
A small tube of lemonade syrup or some bolero sachets(these make 0.5 to 1l of well-hydrating lemonade each)
A pack of gums

Non-food items:
A lighter(IMO better than matches nowadays)
Individually wrapped wet wipes
Small soap bricks
2/3 esbit tabs
4 or 5 cigarettes and a pre-rolled joint because the people I'm taking along(me included) can't manage to quit that garbage, and by the time they need any emergency rations, that shit will be gone too from their inventories, and I can already smell the irritation.

So as you can see, it is already quite a long list. I'm hoping each of the packs can fit inside a 1.5l bag. I might invest in a vacuum sealer to make that work, but since we're going on bikes, space is more important than weight. I'm hoping someone can kind of proof-read this and make some suggestions. I'm not quite happy with the main dish, I am hoping if anyone here knows easy prep main dishes that don't break the bank. Some ideas I had were pancakes(already in the list), a couple different macaroni dishes(suggestions very welcome). It's mainly so that everyone has at least some choice(otherwise I will be very disliked after 3 days of eating exactly the same each day haha)",1,1739124873.0,MRE,1,1.0,False
1ill2l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ill2l3/aitah_for_bringing_my_own_coffee_pot_to_a_shared/,AITAH for bringing my own coffee pot to a shared house.,"So I work out of town and I share a house with 5 other guys that my employer rents out for us all. It's way better then having hotels and having to pack and meal prep every week. I just leave my stuff in my room and we have a refrigerator that we all share. I drink coffee for the taste with only a little bit of heavy whipping cream so no added flavoring at all. There's only one coffee pot and one of my coworkers brought a large can of great value coffee for everyone to share and was pretty excited about it. I did warn him that I probably won't be drinking it because it doesn't taste good and that's it all ok I'll just do without. I did drink it the first couple days but it was just not great and so I just stopped all together. Here's where it's a bit iffy, it's very cold where I work in the winter, like -5 degrees is warm and I really missed having something hot in the morning to drink. So I brought my coffee pot from home because I usually don't drink there because my kid is obsessed with wanting to drink anything I have and I don't mind it but he can't have coffee so I would only drink it if he was still asleep in the mornings. When I brought the coffee pot to the shared house and set it up in my room and he saw it then got so offended. I did say that I just missed my coffee and that I did appreciate that he got us all coffee but I just really missed having some that I liked and that he and our other housemate could drink his and that it's not him it's me I just like good tasting coffee. He makes comments all the time about how his coffee isn't good enough and that he hopes I enjoy my fancy coffee and a lot of other small comments. I just usually say thanks I will. I don't understand why he's so upset about it, I figured this was the best way for us all. He is 20 and I'm 28 so maybe he's just trying to impress me or something but I really don't know, I really don't understand people half the time. So AITAH?",1,1739124853.0,AITAH,5,0.67,False

Teacher and student father (M4a or m4f) only discord and Instagram 


I’m the father of my 7-year-old son/daughter—a brilliant but mischievous kid. Recently, I was called to the principal’s office because my child decided to rip up another student’s book. After a stern discussion with the principal, I was directed to visit the class teacher’s room for further guidance.

I knocked on her door, and a soft, sweet voice answered, “Yes, please, come in.” I stepped inside with my child, taking a seat at her desk. The moment I saw her, my attention shifted. She was wearing a traditional saree, draped elegantly, and her natural charm was impossible to ignore. Her warm smile and graceful demeanor made it difficult to focus on the reason I was there.

As she began discussing my child’s results and behavior, I found myself less interested in the report card and more captivated by her. It was as if the world slowed down. Then, almost unexpectedly, she looked at me and asked, “Would you like to meet for coffee?”

Her words caught me off guard, but I quickly replied, “Yes, please,” without hesitation.

What could she possibly want to discuss over coffee? Was it about my child—or something more? I couldn’t wait to find out.

The other day I had just had my shower when my phone rang, and it was my mum, so laying naked belly down on the bed and facing away from the door, I was talking to my mum on the phone. She was moaning about TV, so I was telling her to get Netflix as you get to look through thousands of shows and movies and can watch them all on demand, when I felt my husband part my legs, and slide his cock into my pussy.

I looked over my shoulder at him and put my hand over the receiver, ""What the fuck?"" I whispered, then I removed my hand and turned my attention back to the phone, and my mum said, “did you say something,” to which I replied, “no I didn't say anything, mum”, and just keep talking. Then I heard myself swallow hard, as he pumped into me and I was in a literal state of shock, that he was fucking me while I was talking on the phone to my mum.

My brain was practically short circuiting as I tried to process what was happening, but I was honestly turned on because it felt naughty, and slutty and enjoying it, so pushed my round, perky ass into the air, and even wiggled it for him as he fucked me good and hard. I gasped a few times as I felt him going into me, getting faster and faster, and my mum said, “are you ok”, and I said, ""Yes, I'm fine, mum, it’s the TV, I promise, sorry,"" looking over my shoulder at him with a smirk as he slowly pushed his cock deep inside me once again.

This was a new position for me, we’ve done doggy lots, but never flat on my  stomach while I’m on the phone, he
kept thrusting his cock up into me burying it to the hilt each time, and making no effort to silence the slapping noises of our hips, then ""Yeeaah"" I  said into the phone shaking, as I had an intense orgasm, and quickly followed it with “I don't really have any plans today was thinking of dropping in for a coffee with you.” Then as he cum deep inside me, I said, aaahhh…right then I’ll see you in a while mum, and hung up.
