1qanjmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/1qanjmb/fear_and_loathing_in_the_fractal_terra/,Fear and Loathing in the Fractal Terra,"God is real and He hates me and my computer. He is resentful that I will be able to render miracles at a higher framerate than Him so He deputized consumer hardware brands to sow ruin in my build. Surely, these were not *my* choices, made of no altered state, undue influence, or disability. These were spiteful acts of god or I’m a fucking idiot. 

I bought the parts over a number of months but mostly during Black Friday, which is now confirmed to eclipse the entire month in a perpetual shadow of the same sale. Obsessed with spending the least on the most, I suffocated my actual hobby of playing games (on a Zephyrus G15 3070 laptop) to play computer part consumer simulator for hours a day. This was all in service of a gift to myself for finally finishing my screenplay. I deserve this, I thought. And I had just gone through a breakup. Five years. I would need to bury myself in a path-traced hole while my heart healed. I need this. 



**Sunday**



I lay out all my special boxes on the table and remember something about static electricity. I google, take off my thick, wool socks and move all the stuff to my wooden coffee table because the dining table was glass. I can’t remember why that was relevant. I remove stuff in little plastic bags from the motherboard box and place them next to each other, methodically, with intention. I had built a PC once before during Covid. I would be fine. 

I get the cpu (9700x) into the motherboard (Aorus B850i) easily enough. But cranking that little lever shut I hear a snap. I may have doomed the fucker already, I think. I’m looking at the instructions which are about as detailed as “put the cpu in the motherboard”  but I realize I was supposed to leave the black plastic cap on and it pops out when secured. I try not to think about that as I click the ram (T-Force Vulcan 6000 cl30) into place and mount the cpu cooler (Thermalright AXP-67). 

I can’t quite get the thing to seat in both screw holes on top of the AM5 mounting hardware. This is the first time I got a little tight in my chest. I get nervous about this tinkery, fine-motor shit. Some parts require a bit of force, some components you want to be gentle with and it’s all *so* expensive. I technically had enough money for this recreational investment but if I break something I'm going to combust. 

I get the cooler on there and now it’s time for the SSD (990 Pro). Here’s where my self-esteem first slaps against a wall. I’m reading all the included shit, which vaguely references an “EZ” mechanism to unlock the SSD heatsink cover on the motherboard but I found this process to be pretty fucking HRD. I can’t figure out how to get this thing off. I google and find no relief. When you have a problem nobody else seems to have had, it makes you feel exponentially stupider. What is misfiring in my unique and terrible brain to create a problem *nobody thought a person could have*? 

Finally, I see a youtuber in a review of this motherboard turn the little metal latch *sideways* which somehow hadn’t occurred to me. Maybe it was because you had to stick a finger in through a little gap which felt so unnatural I thought they couldn’t *possibly* have intended for this to be correct. I feel dumb and I try not to think about the breakup. She wouldn't know what to do about any of this but she would have made it better, somehow. 

I debate getting everything into the case vs. doing a test setup on a cardboard box to make sure everything works. I think about that snap sound I heard putting in the CPU. Then, I imagine the fucker all smushed in to this jade green exoskeleton, stillborn after I press the button. No thanks. I snap PSU (SF850) cables into the motherboard and seat the GPU (Zotac 5070 ti SFF OC). I move everything to the GPU box and carry it carefully into my room to connect to the monitor on my desk. I have a searing pain in my neck from being hunched over my coffee table for so many hours and my feet are freezing. My static-addled socks are sounding pretty good right now but I’m all about safety.

I ask my roommate to hold the motherboard down on the cardboard as I have to unplug the 24pin to rotate the psu into a better position. He carefully obliges me, mindful that I am teetering into mild derangement. The connector is really *connected* so I give it a little more pull…

Something SNAPS. I got the connector out of the motherboard but the whole fucking CPU cooler is *slanted.* All is lost. The horror. I beg reddit for help and somebody tells me to remove the cooler and bend the heatsink back into place. I do this. It’s still slanted but less so. Later I see somebody else had commented that I should leave it alone as the heat pipes could crack. Hope you weren’t right! I put it back on the motherboard and poke electricity into my mound of computer gore.

It boots! We’re back. The clouds part. I am computer guy. So then I start getting everything tucked into the case starting with the bottom exhaust fan, the PSU and the motherboard… But now all my special boxes are all mixed up and I can’t tell these screws from those screws. I’m looking at these fucking hieroglyphics in the various manuals and I can’t tell what screws I’m supposed to use for the motherboard because *my* motherboard has a raised plastic bit on one corner unlike in every picture and video of somebody installing a MB into this case. 

I don’t know how I decided that the long, thin screws were the ones for me but I figured I’d just take them off if they didn’t sit right. WRONG. INCORRECT. These long screws with the wee threads on just the end only go in so far and they DON’T COME OUT because they’re stuck in the motherboard spacers on the case that spin with the screws when I try to unscrew them and I am forsaken. The motherboard is stuck, sitting wonky on the end of these screws, wigglable back and forth in purgatory, neither attached or detached. I sit there for a while. 

Then, I go out into the kitchen. My roommate and his girlfriend are watching TV and she asks me how the computer is coming and I tell her:

*I am in a deep personal hell where nothing and nobody can reach me.*

Then, I laugh. Y’know, to try and take the edge off, but the laugh comes out sharp and desperate and she just says:

*Oh!*

I go back to my room. I have to work tomorrow. All my computer shit is all over my desk and it all looks like one thing and that is failure. Of course. The last build wasn't fine like I said earlier. It was a crisis too, just like with everything I do. I can't toast a bagel without seriously considering whether or not I deserve love. I go to bed and don’t sleep. I didn’t realize how load-bearing the idea of building this computer was for my mental health and now I’m trapped under the rubble. I am not suicidal but I am innocently looking forward to death like a person anticipating their next rainbow.



**Monday**



I call in sick to work. Honestly, I can’t remember much of the day. Maybe some of what I already wrote happened on Monday, it’s all a blur.  All I know is that I was up until 4am divining build secrets from ancient reddit posts like the saddest archeologist. I couldn’t move on with my life until I finished building this computer and I didn't do that on Monday. 



**Tuesday**



I call in sick to work again. I call in sad to my best friend and we go get breakfast. I have a plan. I’m going to use a pair of pliers to hold the motherboard spacers in place while I unscrew the motherboard but there’s a catch: 

My pliers are in my tool bag which is still at my ex-girlfriend's place.

This is the first time my buddy has seen me since the breakup and I was doing okay, keeping my shit together until a few days ago. Now, I’m the sluggiest, most feral heap I’ve been in years and I'm jaggedly inconsolable. 

We go to the dollar store after breakfast so I can get some pliers so I don’t have to call my ex but they don’t have any and my friend says let’s go to canadian tire and I say no, I’m not spending $40 on a new pair of pliers when I already have some and my friend says they need pliers because they just moved into a new place and I say no! I can’t let you do that for me, y’know, like a martyr… So I text my ex. I drive to her place and she brings out my tool bag. She looks beautiful. 

PC BUILD TIP: If you don’t live alone, the car is the best place to cry. 

I free the motherboard. Now I have to figure out how to actually get it back in properly. I look through the manual again and LO AND BEHOLD, I find a QR code that supposedly leads to more information than the mute picture book they included. Here’s the catch. There’s SEVEN fucking DIFFERENT QR CODES on one small sheet of paper and my phone camera won’t recognize the only one I actually want. I tap the screen a hundred times like a dopamine gorged toddler and finally connect with the right portal but then it wants me to download a file that MY PHONE CANNOT READ. It was like being abducted and taken to a party that wouldn’t let me in.

Finally I find the proper manual online and it includes a wealth of relevant information! Maybe we just put that one in the box next time, eh? I get all the parts into the case, spend real actual hours of my life making the cables look nice for what? For who? You, I guess. I press the power button. The fucker turns on. Rejoice. 

But there’s a red light. Despair. I can’t see which error light on the motherboard is on so I try reseating the GPU. Red light. But I have an image on the monitor, I don’t know what’s wrong. Turns out the light goes on until you boot an OS which I haven’t done yet so that was a waste of time. I get Windows installed and the red light goes away so I go to sleep. 



**Wednesday**



My day off, so luckily I don’t have to call in sick again. I got the computer going so maybe I should take a break and go outside. It’s a pretty nice day, anyways I boot up my computer and there’s a RED LIGHT WHY, WHY, GOD. Maybe I'll walk into the woods and find out which mushrooms will nourish me and which mushrooms will kill me and which mushrooms will make ME god of a little cave and I’ll have stick friends and squirrel guts in my beard and nobody will ever see me again. 

After a solid chunk of suffering I figure it out. If I boot up the computer while the monitor is *off*, the computer gets scared like one of those idiot characters that says *who turned out the lights* when someone puts a bucket on their head. I turn off my monitor when I go to sleep because the blinking light bothers me. But this bothers me more. But it’s okay, I boot the computer with the monitor already on and the error light goes away. 

I start installing software and stuff and suddenly I hear a clipping noise and freak out. Something is stuck in one of the fans! I investigate. The most likely culprit is the bottom case fan (slim arctic p12) as the PSU cables hang just above like James Bond over sharks. But I have a fan grate on there! It should be safe but a few cables are pressed up against the grate and must be hanging just low enough for the fan to bite them.

So listen, I take the fucking thing apart. I remove the PSU and re-route the cables. I’ve used the 6mm spacers so there's some space behind the power supply to tuck cables. There's now a solid inch between the lowest curling cables and the fan grate. BUT STILL, THAT INFERNAL SOUND, THE CLIP, CLIP, CLIPPING OF THE FAN. fUCK. I hate computing. I should be reading a book. I could go to the library and write and be a human being in the world. I don’t need multi frame gen, I need therapy. 

My therapist is on vacation so I return to my investigation and I find the true culprit. It was the fan grate ITSELF that was making that noise! BETRAYED! Whenever the fan would spin at a high enough RPM, it would RATTLE like something was caught in the blades. I loosen the grill and it goes away. 

I download my software and have more issues I won’t bother you with. The computer is complete and I feel a mixture of relief and embarrassment. I run cyberpunk, everything cranked. It kicks ass. All of this is so stupid. I don’t need this and I have so much other shit I should be doing. But I am glad I have a place to ride out the storm when I don’t have the energy to stagger through it.

My loving wife would like to come and cheer me on, and will be navagating herself around the city while I run the race. Unfortunately she generally relies on my for navagation wherever we go, she get's lots easily, and is not terribly skilled at using google/apple maps. 

My goal is to set her up for success, and provide her with some ideas for where to park to see me a couple of times along the route. My question is - h**ow bad exactly is parking in and around town, and in the residential areas heading south on race day?** 

After doing a little research, I was going to have her drive from the starting line to the Coaster Station Lot near Grand and State Street, so she can park and connect with me at mile 3, which would be around 7:00am - is it fair to guess that she can find parking around that area that early in the morning? She could stay there for couple hours unitl I come back to the exact same spot at mile 14, with plenty of places to get coffee, or eat and hang out.

What about street or residential parking further down (south) the coast between Cannon and Poinsettia streets?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I don’t normally do this, but after my partner posted online to meet like minded people here it ended up being a great success and we are trying to do the same for me lol. This has been my vacation spot for years and I finally made the big decision to move here permanently. Though I am lucky enough to know a few people that live here closely already I would love to find friends that want to hang out on the regular or some great hobby friends. After being here for 6 months I’m still getting my bearings and trying to find my favorite coffee spots or figuring out which trails everyone loves the most. A little about me: I’m a big fan of comics and a bookworm, would love to find a book club if possible. I love board games in any form whether they’re strategic, cooperative, or just chaotic. I am a HUGE movie fan (also avid horror fan), like from classics to new releases it doesn’t matter. I also love theatre plays or a musical if you are into that. I love hiking and camping a lot, and have recently gotten into riding a bike since it’s so big here. In the creative side, I’m an amateur baker and cook, something I’m supper passionate about doing and it has made me become a foodie on the weekends from time to time lol. I’m also an amateur artist and my BIG personal dream is currently to build my portfolio and hopefully get a gig in the city with a local building mural or mural along cherry creek would be awesome. Other than instagram, I just started my online portfolio with CALLFORENTRY to try and find local online bidding gigs, so fingers crossed. Anyways I’m really here because I want to meet people and play games, go on hikes, talk about books, swap podcast recommendations, cook together, or just hang out and build community.

Ignorance might be bliss, but if the military is standing on your neck, or your house is fucking vaporized, tell me, did pretending everything is fine get you anywhere? 

Obviously they’re burnt out, but is it not selfish? 

My biggest fear was being homeless, now it’s seeing my Country invaded, war, losing my home, my family, the whole damn planet set off in nuclear fire… people are dying and being murdered en masse, and NOBODY around me wants to talk about it?!

My therapist says “this isn’t healthy, I understand it’s scary but it’s within the scope of your control, and you’re just making yourself more anxious” 

Like, I’m paying you to tell me to calm down cause I’m just getting upset? What’s the fucking point. Like should I name five things I can see, and that’ll make me feel less bad about endless genocide and poverty? Should we check in with our besties across the pond, and ask them how dbt has helped with losing loved ones? 

My mum’s going under for an operation on Tuesday, and I’m trying not to let my anxiety trigger hers, I’m worried about her. My therapists suggestion? Go get a coffee and wait while she’s under. OH OK. Bountiful knowledge. Super helpful. 

How are people even functioning?! I feel like there’s gotta be other people freaking out, who can’t stand how many others are telling them to be quiet.

This has been my vacation spot for years and I finally made the big decision to move here permanently. Though I am lucky enough to know a few people that live here closely already I would love to find friends that want to hang out on the regular or some great hobby friends. After being here for 6 months I’m still getting my bearings and trying to find my favorite coffee spots or figuring out which trails everyone loves the most. A little about me: I’m a big fan of comics and a bookworm, would love to find a book club if possible. I love board games in any form whether they’re strategic, cooperative, or just chaotic. I am a HUGE movie fan (also avid horror fan), like from classics to new releases it doesn’t matter. I also love theatre plays or a musical if you are into that. I love hiking and camping a lot, and have recently gotten into riding a bike since it’s so big here. In the creative side, I’m an amateur baker and cook, something I’m supper passionate about doing and it has made me become a foodie on the weekends from time to time lol. I’m also an amateur artist and my BIG personal dream is currently to build my portfolio and hopefully get a gig in the city with a local building mural or mural along cherry creek would be awesome. Other than instagram, I just started my online portfolio with CALLFORENTRY to try and find local online bidding gigs, so fingers crossed. Anyways I’m really here because I want to meet people and play games, go on hikes, talk about books, swap podcast recommendations, cook together, or just hang out and build community.

1qancb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askfuneraldirectors/comments/1qancb0/a_rant_and_a_question_from_a_funeral_attendant/,A rant and a question from a funeral attendant,"I've been working as a funeral attendant for about 3 years now. I also assist with removals and do other errands here and there but my primary job and honest love is working funerals. I'm very good at this role, and I love it more than I would have ever thought, but I've come to reddit to ask the funeral directors if my role is a standard one. 

TL;DR: private equity is evil. sorry this got long.

I work for two funeral homes, 20 minutes apart, both owned by the same private equity cesspool in a state far far away from my home community. When I started there was absolutely no staff overlap between the locations, only the regional director Bob (not his real name) oversaw both. He was and is the direct line to corporate and no complaint ever goes past him. My first funeral director was an alcoholic who routinely slept through cremation services. In my state a funeral director is only required for traditional services. I learned very quickly how to run a service alone, and run it well. It helped that my first job was in a radio station, and the music equipment made sense to me. It also helped that the women in the office at the time were excellent and the file notes were immaculate. The building itself was also immaculate, lovingly tended by the couple who owned the home for 30+ years before selling out to the farfaraway profit machine. The second funeral director in this location is an entirely different post altogether, a rousing tale of arrogance and assholery, culminating in the wrong body being cremated. (Can I say that? I think I can say that. There's no identifying information and no legal action as far as I know, gotta love a settlement and a policy change)

At one point the other location was in a pinch and needed an attendant and I was asked to fill in, which I started doing regularly. Different world entirely, but not quite. More funerals scheduled, more office staff, but the funerals directors also didn't work the services. Not even the traditional ones. They never, ever left their offices except for arrangements and removals (and food).  They were in the building and that was all the law required. File notes sometimes only contained the words FOOD MUSIC CLERGY with nothing written next to music and clergy, but the name of the catering company and the type of food written clear as day. One of the funeral directors was obsessed with food in a way I've never seen. The day I saw her *in front of the family* in the buffet line *in shorts* I thought I was hallucinating. This wasn't even *her* family. I digress. The other funeral director was a textbook narcissistic power/money hungry racist white man and not worth elaborating upon, we all know someone just like him. Like Bob. I got very good at working services alone, with no information beforehand. I'm good with people, and adjustable. The family arrives, I greet them genuinely because I am genuinely interested in making this day work well, and I ask them what they need from me, and we go from there. I quickly started taking pride in knowing that families who had a hard time with this company beforehand were clearly relieved that someone was truly taking care of them on the day of the funeral. 

The other funeral attendants at this second location were mostly retired and despite being funeral attendants for years and years, most didn't know how to make a pot of percolator coffee, or turn on the microphone. The music system was gibberish and if they did have to work it they had no concept at all of fading the music IN and not just having it at full blast when you push play and then fading OUT before the next song starts... I digress again. I don't even fault them, the job they applied for was a gig that consisted of working the doors, greeting people, ""guarding the cards from the homeless"" (their words, all of them, each one said these words to me exactly which is wild), and pointing to the bathrooms. Usually actually pointing, with one finger. I believe that years and years without any GOOD funeral director-ing, these folks just defaulted to getting the families out of the building as soon as possible after the service ends. They move the flowers from the chapel to the hall and start straightening chairs before the chapel is remotely empty. They empty the garbages while people are still eating. They pull the vacuum out (even though they do not vacuum). The stated goal is indeed to make the family feel like they need to go. They say this to me while they do these things like I am on the same page. 

The problem is, I SIMPLY DO NOT FC\*K WITH THAT. You can say I was trained to a higher standard, yes that's true but also my first funeral director pissed in a potted indoor plant during a church service. Most of my standards are simply my own high standards. The more I learn the higher they get, that's all. I am GOOD at my job, I am GOOD at this work. I want so desperately to do even better work for someone who DESERVES my good work. The families deserve it and they'll get it every single time because I simply do not get paid enough to give crappy service. THEY are the work. I'm not a funeral director, I'm a funeral attendant and I clearly and firmly understand the difference. But the people who monetarily benefit from MY GOOD WORK are not me and not the families and sometimes it just really really gets me going oh god I'm digressing again. 

To the funeral directors I ask, is this standard at all, anywhere? I can't believe it is, I have to believe that it's just THIS company, who doesn't care how the funeral goes as long as the checks clear. Please tell me it's just THIS regional director, who won't fire anyone because it affects his bonus so everything falls to hell but he gets another boat that he'll store in the funeral home garage over the winter. Tell me it's better somewhere out there. 

To the families who have read this I ask, in your experience have the funeral attendants had a positive or negative impact on how the funeral went? I was initially hesitant to take this job until a good friend told me that at his grandfather's funeral the month before, the attendants were rude and callous. He was imagining how that day would have gone if someone like me had been working and he thought the whole day would have been different. That is something I carry with me every day and if I ever have the honor to assist you and your family, I will be grateful to my friend for putting me in your path.

I miss the first cigarette of the morning, that sharp hit of nicotine that woke me up better than any alarm. I miss smoking after a great lunch, with a hot cup of coffee in my hand. I miss the perfect excuse to slip away: “I’m going for a cigarette,” and disappearing for a while, alone, without explanations.

I even miss its smell. That smell that still betrays me when someone walks by smoking on the street and, for a split second, brings back that toxic pleasure—brief, almost automatic. A memory that barges in without permission and leaves quickly, but leaves a mark.

I met people through smoking. Conversations that would never have happened without that shared ritual. I never met anyone boring who smoked; the cigarette always seemed to bring stories, comfortable silences, unspoken complicity. And when drinking… the cigarette was even better, as if everything fell into place.

My dad smoked too. And he quit as well, because it was killing him. I know he did the right thing. But I also know, without him saying it, that he misses it too.

Because I know the truth as well. I know it kills. It has already taken several of my own. I know it wasn’t innocent or romantic: it was dependence, it was deception, it was slow wear and tear. A relationship that gave immediate pleasure and charged dearly afterward.

I miss it, yes. The way you miss something toxic: not because it was good, but because it was intense. Because it was there during many important moments. Because it was hard to let go.

And still, I quit. Not because I didn’t love it, but because I wanted to stay alive.

I'm looking to build my social connections a bit in Brisbane.  

I'm based in Mt Gravatt area.  It doesn't matter if it's online or IRL social connections.

Basic information up front: I'm white, single and in a government job.  I don't drink much - much prefer a coffee instead of a beer.  I think I'm funny? I'm conservative but non-religious (basically an ""each to their own"" approach).  


**Gaming:**

I like pretty much all genres but I'm a big fan of RPGs/RTS/Casual the most. I like co-op games if you're interested in that type of thing.  I have PC, Xbox, PS5.  I am presuming this would probably be just an online-only thing.  Online friends are great if that's what you're happy to do.

  
**Board games:**  

I like most board games - I'm not a super in-depth kind of board gamer but I used to play some light board games back in the day.  I am hoping to find some people who are happy to play or go to a board game cafe or something.  Mostly because this will hopefully allow me to spread the network even further.

  
**Physical activity:**

Goodlife member.  Mt Gravatt area gym.  I've been a solo exerciser for years \*(weights and cardio) and I'm quite fit but I am happy to mix it up.  Try some new activities with a friend? That could be a hike or even joining a sports activity like Tennis, pickleball,basketball or something if we become motivated enough.  I am a fan of tougher hikes in the winter - nothing too tough like multi-day hikes, but, ya know, more than a stroll in the park.  I'm happy to compromise though.

**Language/Japanese:**

I am a stereotypical white guy who loves Japan - I have lots of Manga and speak Japanese pretty well. I am an absolute sucker for 90s/00s aesthetic manga and anime. I would normally join language meetups but I have found them a bit too one-note for me - I'm looking for friends and not language partners (but if you were a non-English speaker and wanted to get corrections or half-half Japanese and English, I'd totally be okay with that).

Prices in this dying mill town were dirt cheap, and the sagging porches just screamed solitude. The realtor smirked and mentioned something about ""unique acoustics,"" but I shrugged it off. Who believes in ghosts in broad daylight?

  
That first night changed everything. I woke up to whispers slithering from the walls, soft as someone's breath right in my ear: ""Mark... stay..."" My pulse was hammering. The rooms were empty, windows locked tight. I told myself it was just stress. Popped a pill and crashed back out.

  
By week two, the voices got worse. I'd be in the kitchen making coffee, and they'd hiss from the vents: ""Forever... with us."" I taped them shut and even called pest control. Nothing but cobwebs. That night in the bedroom, the walls started giggling like kids: ""We watch you undress, Mark. Every scar.""

  
I grabbed a pry bar and tore into the drywall. Fiberglass rained down everywhere, and I found these old 1923 newspapers. One headline: ""Hollow Family Vanishes, Echoes to Blame."" There was a faded photo of these emaciated parents and twin girls with what looked like scooped-out eyes. The article said the house devoured sounds, trapping souls until their screams faded to nothing.

  
I figured it was all delusional crap from back then. Nailed the hole shut and tried to forget it. But then my ex's voice dripped from the ceiling fan: ""You abandoned me, Mark. Rot here alone."" I barricaded the attic and jammed in earplugs. Stopped eating. Looked in the mirror and saw my cheeks hollowing out, my eyes sinking back like those twins'.

  
My brother Tom came to check on me. ""Just listen!"" I begged him in the parlor. He tilted his head. ""Sounds like wind, man. You're falling apart."" The walls hummed for a second, then went dead quiet. They loved his doubt. After he left, the basement exploded with his voice yelling: ""Mark! It's dragging me!""

  
Flashlight shaking in my hand, I went down. The air felt thick, clogged with voices. My mom's old scolding, my ex's sobs, taunts from bullies I'd buried years ago. These are your echoes, Mark. We own them now."" The crawlspace opened up like a wet black mouth, pulsing. Something writhed in there, murmuring that affair confession I'd never said out loud.

  
Back upstairs, the doors wouldn't budge. Fused shut. Windows sealed like scar tissue. The voices clawed right into my head, feeding off every mutter. I screamed until my throat was raw, but they just dug deeper, mimicking my heartbeat.

  
Days are blurring together now. I pace around babbling nonsense to starve them out. They've gone quiet lately. Just waiting. They'll take my last breath soon.

I used my foot to clear the complete outline of the door. On all sides it sat perfectly flush with the hard packed dirt around it.

So, I pulled the handle and the hinges glided like they were just oiled, not a sound other than my own efforts. Under it was a set of steps dug right into the earth. They looked dry and sturdy.  It smelled less damp and stale down there than the forest I stood in.  Instead, the hallway felt slightly …electric. It was narrow and there was a dim light that flickered differently than torches would. I imagine, I had never been anywhere lit by torch light alone.

I paused at the threshold. This feeling. It reminded me when someone dares you to do something stupid, that moment just before your tongue touches the battery. The metallic taste is somehow already in your mouth. But turning back seemed crazier than going forward, so I swung the door entirely open and stepped down.
At the bottom of the eight or so steps, the hallway narrowed and curved and a light source was coming from further on. It would only take a few steps down the hallway before my entrance, and the only known exit would be out of sight. I stepped closer to the first bend, wanting to see the source of the light, but it seemed to be matching my pace, staying around each next bend.. I shimmied slowly, and stopped multiple times to quickly bound back towards the steps.
 It bent and bent, now almost curling on it itself. I turned, suddenly realizing I went too far. I sprinted back to the stairs to find the earth finished regurgitating the door. Nothing but solid dirt remained. I was not surprised, but I was beginning to sweat against the cool air. 
Then light down the hall got twice as bright. The dirt walls gradually changed to wallpaper. Floral. Faded. Peeling. Patchy the first few feet, and slowly the dirt became rare, until the glowing floral pattern completely took over. Like ivy completely covering a brick wall. 

After a short straight away, the hallway continued to bend right and left angles. Corners that pinched like toy box hinges. And every few feet, doors. Too many. Some were half-sized, for small children or large raccoons. Others were oblong or obtuse, short barn style doors, complete with barn smells wafting underneath. 

That was my reality, opening random doors in Wonderland.  I looked for one that gave the least amount of creepy vibes. Many were too small, one doorknob glowed red hot, and as I got near, I could feel heat. Another was completely covered by a mirror. It took me a beat to realize my reflection had no head.

Eventually, I came to the least offensive door. Inside was a room full of coat racks. Every coat was dripping wet, but the floor was bone dry. I took a full step in, but kept my hand in the door jam. With my other hand I turned one around, it was a person, hollowed flat, hung up like laundry. Their faces sagged but their eyes, with more depth than their skulls, moved. Blinked. Silently begged for help. 

I said “sorry” like that, fixed anything, and shut the door.

I was relieved to be back in the safety of the neverending hallway I’d probably die in. Humans are quick to move the goalposts.

I picked another door, because bad things happen in threes. This one opened to what looked like the diner downtown. Same booths, same greasy laminated menus. But the “people” eating there were all… wrong. Like someone had described humans to an alien, and that alien did their best. Slightly Picassoesque faces stated et me with unsymmetrical eyes, looked at me over menus they gripped too hard with far too many fingers. Still chewing, slurping, sipping coffee that was the wrong color. It had no color.

The waitress turned and smiled at me with teeth that went back too far. She said, “Table for one?”
And I swear, I nodded just to avoid being rude .

That’s when I realized the door behind me was gone.
All the doors were gone. Just endless booths, endless chewing. Why did they have so many fucking fingers. 

The forest had spit me out somewhere else. Or maybe it swallowed me whole.

Either way, I’m not lost. I’m seated.
And the waitress is bringing me pie.

She slid the plate across the table. Pie. Cherry. But too red, and it smelled like pennies and… bleach? 

“On the house,” she said.
Her voice was kind. Too kind. Funeral-home kind.

I picked up the fork because not doing so felt like insulting her, and it was obvious you don’t want to piss off the help in a place like this.

The first bite burned. Not hot—cold. My tongue bordered on frostbite. My teeth ached, my jaw hummed. The “cherry” wasn't a cherry at all. It was meat. Like those cubes chunks in a can of Campbell's. I wish this was a can of Campbell's soup

I smiled. “Delicious.”
She nodded, far too satisfied, and walked away.

That’s when I noticed the pie looked untouched . Every forkful I took, it refilled. Whole again. 

The booths around me started watching. Not with their eyes—most didn’t have eyes that worked right—but with the subtle lean, the twitch of a jaw, the faint scrape of chairs turning. Like a hundred mannequins holding their breath, waiting to see what I’d do next.

I tried standing. My legs didn’t move. Not frozen, not restrained. Just politely refusing. Like they’d decided to sit, and my brain was in no position to argue. 

The ceiling lights flickered. One of them buzzed, then dripped. Not water—something thicker. The drop hit the table and crawled toward the pie like a slug late for work.

I whispered, “I want to go home.”

And the whole diner answered, in perfect harmony, “Then finish your slice.”

The fork was back in my hand. My fingers clenched it without asking me first. The pie pulsed. The red filling bubbled once. Like a wink. Even the pie was in on it. 
And was waiting for the next course.

So I did the only logical thing. I stabbed the fork down, straight through the crust. The whole diner flinched at once—every patron jerking in unison, like I’d just hit the fire alarm inside their veins.

The lights cut out.
Silence.

When they flicked back on, I wasn’t at the table anymore. I was standing in the hallway again. The floral wallpaper looked to have taken on a slightly red hue.

The plate was still in my hand.
Empty. Clean. Like I’d licked it spotless.

I dropped it. I did not hear it hit the ground.

My brain said run. But, don’t run on an Escher staircase. No one has the cardio for that. 

And plus, they want you to run. I still did not know who “they” were, or why they wanted you to run, but I assumed it made us taste better, 

So I walked, the hairs on the back of my neck reaching straight out behind me. Doors lining both sides, all of them humming with something alive behind them. One door shook like it was laughing. A few doors down, one oozed a blue fluid that I carefully stepped over.  One smelled like Axe body spray, and that one made me the most nervous.

Finally, I saw it: a door with a glowing EXIT sign above it. Classic trap. 

I pushed it open.

Inside was… my living room. Couch. Coffee table. The ugly lamp I keep meaning to throw out. The TV was on, showing a rerun of a show I've been watching. 

It was too perfect. . 

I stepped in anyway, mostly because I had not seen this episode yet. 

The door slammed behind me, and the laughter track from the TV got louder. Then it wasn’t a laugh track—it was the forest. Thousands of voices, leaves and branches cackling in sync. .

The TV characters turned to me, dead eyes bright, and said, “Welcome home.”

Why does everyone here have perfect pitch? 

I bolted. Straight back through the door. Straight back into the hallway. The wallpaper was peeling faster now, flaking off like skin after a sunburn. The whole place groaned like it was tired of hosting me.

And then—mercifully, stupidly—there it was. Another door. Small, crooked, glowing faintly like a night-light.

I opened it, and the forest spat me out. Fresh air. Trees. Moonlight.

I fell to my knees in the dirt, gasping. The forest was quiet. No whispers. No chewing. Just crickets and owls doing their normal night-shift.

I looked back. The door with the brass handle was gone. Just roots now. Tangled, ordinary. .

I staggered up, muttering, “Out of the woods.”

I would have written it all off as a dream, or I hit my head and was just coming to.  But the taste in my mouth was still sweet. Still cold. Still cherry pie.
And when I touched my stomach, it pulsed.

Like something inside me was waiting for the next course.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qamyow,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1qamyow/choices/,Choices,"Right now I have never been more unhappy with my life. Currently I’m struggling with body image and nicotine addiction. I spend so much of my time just crying and contemplating my life because I’m not happy with a single aspect of it. When people look at me they see a basic boring white girl. I dress like everyone else with my matching sets, plain hoodies, black leggings. I do my makeup to fit the beauty standard, slim nose, doe eyes, contoured cheeks, and perfectly glossed lips, but is this who I really am?

I spent my whole life working to this moment, so why am I so unhappy? I have so many friends, loving parents. I’m doing good at school and in volleyball, so why every night when I lay down and have nothing to distract me I can’t help but cry.

But it wasn’t always like this. In fourth grade I was part of the cool girl group. When I first recognized I was unhappy was on Halloween when my best friend, also the leader of the friend group, ditched me. I was left feeling lonely and carrying a heavy rage in my chest. Shortly after I sent her an aggressive text message. Let’s just say it didn’t end well and I ended up dropped from the whole friend group, and not a single girl would even glance my way.

That’s when I approached the less popular kids. These kids were outliers. They were often nicknamed weird, but they took me in with such kindness I’d never experienced before. The next few years with them was such a learning experience that I’ll never forget, it has shaped me so much as a person to this day. Everything I’ve learned about gratitude and kindness has been from those people and I’m so grateful for them. They truly let me be myself without a single judgmental comment. I went through so many phases with them and it was my biggest journey of self discovery.

But the conservative Christian household that I was raised in restricted some aspects of that. I never truly expressed myself the way I wanted to be seen by others. As I started expanding my social circle I started becoming friends with more popular girls again. The attention immediately captivated me and I wrongfully cut contact with all my old friends. Even though it felt right in the moment there’s always going to be a hole in my chest. Sometimes I stalk them on social media because that’s the only way I can see how they’re doing. They’re all still friends and they’re all still being their real authentic selves and I envy them so much. I envy their ability and braveness to continue being themselves and doing what makes them happy even though society is trying to shape them into this perfect image. And most of all I miss them. I miss their acceptance and kindness.

As for myself I kept climbing the social ladder. Before I knew it I was on shopping trips with my new friends trying on clothes that really don’t do me any good. Clothes that make me look like every other girl. Clothes that don’t express anything about me. But it was my decision and people having some respect for me made me feel powerful. It almost felt like a high, like you’re standing on top of the world controlling it.

On my first day of high school I felt so powerful. At my old school I was one of the coolest girls. I do admit I thought I was better than everyone else. I thought I could say anything and get away with it. I thought I was so pretty. This quickly shut down when I realized the social hierarchy had already been established a long time ago before high school even started. Everyone knew each other. Everyone had their people. I was left as a girl who lives far away. My whole social circle was in a completely different part of the city than my school.

Slowly my confidence went away. I made a good handful of friends but never got close enough to have my people. Friends to hang out with after school or people to tell my problems to. When my face started showing some texture that was the final blow to my confidence. Soon boys were making comments about my skin. I was being called ugly by so many people. I would get gross looks just for not putting pounds of makeup on every day and I became so self conscious that I wanted to hurt myself.

I hated everything about myself. I hated that my skin was covered in pimples. I hated that I was taller than other girls. I hated how somehow I never clicked with anyone. I hated how I got no attention from boys. I was so self conscious all the time. Anytime anyone would look at me I would assume they were looking at my acne or inspecting my face looking for every flaw.

My thoughts got so overwhelming. I started reaching for substances. Every football game, anytime I didn’t have homework. I looked for every excuse to not be sober.  I started romanticizing being high or drunk. Anything is better than sober. Somehow my thoughts would magically quiet down and not everything would be about my appearance. But academic pressure and feeling the need to be successful doesn’t allow one to be constantly intoxicated. That’s when I discovered vaping.

It quieted my brain just like every other substance, but I could do this one whenever I wanted. During every passing period, right when I woke up in the morning and the last thing I do before I fall asleep. My vape was always glued to my body. One thing about vaping is it suppresses your appetite while also making your metabolism faster, so naturally I lost a good amount of weight. Still suffering with acne and hating my face I started taking comfort in my body. I felt like I needed to show my body to be pretty because that’s the only part of me people noticed. I got compliments on my abs but never my personality or features. As much as I want to be more than my body, the attention felt good and having something that other girls envied me for was empowering.

When summer came I had to go to sleepaway camp. I knew I wasn’t going to be able to bring my vape so I started a quitting journey. It was surprisingly easy except when summer was over I noticed my clothes started fitting me differently. When I looked in the mirror I no longer saw my old perfect body. Instead I saw something that disgusted me. Even though my acne was gone now I found something new to be self conscious about.

Food started becoming a reward instead of a need. If I worked out enough maybe I could afford to eat. I started restricting my diet so intensely that even healthy foods scared me because of the calorie content. I started living off black coffee and going back to my old habit of vaping. Going to the gym started becoming so necessary that I would cry for hours if I missed one day. Feeling empty started having a euphoric sensation. It made me feel clean and light and it gave me a purpose. I was dedicated to looking like all my other skinny friends but the process is more than just being hungry, not eating brought out a side of me that I’ve never seen before.

My emotions are so unstable and fluctuate so much. I can’t help but be in a constant state of misery and anger. Every person I talk to hits a nerve and even though I have the life I would’ve dreamed of last year with a group of friends who actually invite me to stuff and include me, I still find reasons to get mad at them when really they didn’t do anything. Every time an episode of anger subsides I’m left with such guilt because deep down I know I am the source of my own hate.

 I chose every single part of my life. I chose to leave behind who I really was for a good social image. I chose to put my body through pain every day to be pretty. So if I’m unhappy with the life I chose and spent so long building, do I even deserve to be happy?",2,1768197204.0,venting,1,1.0,False

After a while boredom crept in. She switched it off and went to the kitchen to make herself some coffee.

They had two servants in the house Raju and Shubha a married couple. That day they had taken leave and gone home early because their son was sick.

When Manjula returned from the kitchen she froze.

Saloni’s photograph was lying on the floor.

How did this fall down she muttered placing it back where it belonged.

Saloni was Rohan’s first wife. Unfortunately she was no longer alive. From the photograph it was clear she had been exceptionally beautiful large expressive eyes fair skin rose petal lips.

Before marriage Manjula had loved someone else Anubhav but her family had married her off to Rohan instead.

That night Rohan returned home late from the office. Manjula complained as usual about his late hours. Rohan explained he had gone to the hospital to check on Raju’s son.

The doctors cannot figure out what is wrong Rohan said. He has seizures. He faints. Sometimes he mutters strange things. His eyes turn red.

Manjula shuddered. Sounds strange could it be something paranormal.

Rohan laughed it off romantically pulling her close. She smiled but somewhere deep inside unease settled.

That night while Rohan slept deeply Manjula could not sleep. She kept thinking about Raju’s son Saurav barely thirteen or fourteen.

Suddenly strange scratching sounds filled the room.

She woke up startled. The window was rattling in the wind. She closed it but as she turned back her eyes drifted to the lawn.

A black shadow was moving out of the house.

Her heart began pounding.

She did not wake Rohan.

She just lay down again trembling.

The next morning brought terrible news.

Saurav’s condition worsened. He laughed cried screamed completely out of control. An experienced doctor finally told Rohan that some illnesses cannot be explained by medical science and are often called possession or paranormal activity.

During another seizure Saurav screamed in a woman’s voice that no one would survive.

When Rohan entered the room Saurav pointed at him and screamed that he would die too.

Blood poured from the boy’s nose and mouth.

Within hours Saurav was dead.

The incident shook Manjula deeply. That night when she was alone at home fear gripped her for the first time in her life.

At ten she tried to sleep.

Then she heard it.

Someone was opening the window slowly.

She saw it.

A black silhouette climbing into the room.

She ran tripped over a statue screamed turned on the light.

Nothing.

The window was open.

She knew she had closed it.

The next day Manjula left for her parents house. Rohan stayed back.

That same day Raju told Rohan that it was Saloni and that she had killed his son and would not spare anyone.

Before Rohan could respond a police inspector arrived Inspector Shrikant.

He had investigated Saloni’s death years ago and had always found it suspicious.

At her parents house Manjula felt safe until she met Anubhav again.

He showed her photos.

Rohan in a hotel room with another woman.

Then Anubhav said something that shattered her.

Saloni found out about his affairs. She wanted a divorce. Rohan pushed her down the stairs.

Manjula was speechless.

That night she dreamt of Saloni falling down the stairs blood everywhere Raju witnessing everything bribed into silence a fake postmortem report.

She woke up screaming.

The next morning shocking news arrived.

The doctor who had signed Saloni’s postmortem report was murdered.

His body was twisted unnaturally.

Rohan and Raju fled to a temple in Raju’s village.

Manjula went to the police.

On the way Rohan confessed talking to himself.

Yes I killed her. What choice did I have. She wanted to leave with her wealth.

Suddenly Manjula received a call.

Madam Raju is dead. His body is here.

Her blood ran cold.

Then who was driving the car.

Rohan looked at the driver.

Half his face was Raju’s.

Half was Saloni’s.

The car sped toward a ravine.

Rohan jumped out shattered his leg screamed for help.

Saloni appeared.

She twisted his limbs.

She laughed.

The police found him alive but broken.

In the police jeep Rohan screamed that she was standing there.

No one else saw her.

Suddenly his body lifted as if by an invisible force.

His eyes bulged.

His throat crushed.

Rohan died right there.

Silence filled the vehicle.

Inspector Shrikant whispered asking if this was justice.

Manjula clutched Anubhav and cried.

Saloni’s revenge was complete.

1qamy8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectronicsRepair/comments/1qamy8f/old_screw_in_fusebox_making_noticeable_electronic/,Old screw in fuse-box making noticeable electronic buzzing noise - need next steps and advice,"This fuse box has been in my house for over 20 years ever since my Dad moved in but has never really had this issue until recently. We need advice for this type of thing because at the moment we cannot afford a certified technician to come look at it so I decided to post to this subreddit to get some advice for what to look out for and what to do before we try to do so.

Our fuse box has always had problems with burning fuses, like simple ones. Like if we run 2 appliances at once in our kitchen off the same fuse (such as a coffee maker and a microwave, or a microwave and a toaster oven) the fuse will burn out and we have to replace it. But this is not the issue I am talking about. We have started to notice some unusual buzzing coming from our box.

The first time it happened we were running a microwave off of a singular fuse (this was the only appliance running at the time) and we began to hear an extremely ear piercing buzz coming from the fuse box. We immediately turned off the microwave and my Dad told me to go over to the fuse box and listen for a buzz when he turned on the microwave again but there was nothing anymore.

Today was the second time it happened and we are still oblivious about the whole thing. Our electric water heater was installed about 15 years ago along with a brand new Jumper cable by my Papa and it has worked perfectly fine ever since. The only worrisome thing that has ever been of that water heater ever since is that sometimes the fuse will get a little warm if the heater is running for long periods of time (e.g. 30+ mins) which I think is fairly normal for an old fuse box like this.

But today we were doing dishes and as I walked by the box I noticed a very distinct buzzing noise coming from the fuse box. This buzzing went on for over 20 minutes before stopping. The only fuse that was noticeably hot to the touch was the fuse that the water heater was on (note: the water heater is the only one on that fuse) and we concluded it was that fuse. But after the buzzing stopped, even after taking 3 10 minute showers and doing a bit of a load on the heater the buzzing never continued.

What could this be, what should we look out for, and what is some advice on this? Any help is appreciated!",1,1768197162.0,ElectronicsRepair,0,1.0,False

Then your phone buzzes, not with a travel update, but with a worry about rent back home.
Living overseas should feel freeing, not like managing late payments across time zones.

You can make sure rent reaches you on time every month by building a system that works without you chasing anyone. Automation, clear payment rules, and reliable property management keep rent flowing even when you live abroad.

Think of rent collection like a subscription service. Once it runs on autopilot, payments happen on the same date every month. You stop relying on memory, reminders, or follow-up messages.

When you combine automated rent collection, simple digital payments, and a local property manager, distance stops being a problem. Rent arrives whether you are overseas for a few weeks or several years.

**Why it matters**

On-time rent keeps your finances stable.
Late payments can affect your mortgage, maintenance costs, and peace of mind.
For overseas landlords and NRI property owners, delays feel bigger because fixing them takes more time and effort.

**How it works in simple terms**

Think of rent like water flowing through a pipe.
You need a direct, secure line from the tenant’s bank to yours.
Using online rent payment systems, direct debit, or property management software, tenants pay automatically on a fixed date without reminders from you.

**A real-world perspective**

One overseas owner moved to Singapore and spent hours every month messaging tenants about rent.
After switching to automated rent payments and appointing a local property management company, the follow-ups stopped.
Now, she checks her bank account once a month and moves on with her life.

**One useful fact**

Tenants are up to 40 percent more likely to pay rent on time when they use automated online payment portals instead of manual transfers or cheques.

**Micro Takeaway**

Distance stops mattering when rent collection runs on autopilot.

**Discussion Question**

What part of managing property from abroad causes you the most stress today?

Warm up with some coffee, then some reading and some more coffee; make sure to check the level or imagination stimulation, plot coherence and specific reading comprehension (as opposed to general - not just over chunks of texts, but over specific sentences). Then put on music loud - that really helps cause I plug out my headphones and thus can't watch videos and you can start writing. The first paragraphs usually feel like shit but then I find myself drawn in, sometimes unable to stop. Although more often than not everything feels like shit until I tell myself I'm done. Then I can actually start working out and occasionally run back to the computer to write some more cause my brain has entered the creative mode.

Being able to write requires sleep, food and warmup (that being reading someone else). You may have bursts of inspiration when you fall asleep and that's good, but that's a separate issue. What I'm presenting you with is a way to develop discipline and habit.

1qamv8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChaseSapphire/comments/1qamv8h/the_editcosmo_vegas/,The Edit-Cosmo Vegas,"Summary of The Edit for Cosmo in Vegas

Stay: December 29th-31st (2025)
Room Booked: City Room 
Upgrade: Terrace View room (Boulevard tower, 67th floor, fountain view) more info below on upgrade
Price: $840 for 2 nights not including $250 credit
Check In: Arrived at 8am, room immediately available
Check Out: NYE Dec 31st at 1pm
Welcome Letter: Given at check-in; QR code for restaurants accepting $100 dining credit. Breakfast credit options available on actual letter. 
Dining: $100 Credit
Breakfast: $65 a day (does not include check-in day)


For context we booked two weeks before our trip to use the $250.
My wife has the Chase card and we decided to use the Edit program at the Cosmo since we have never stayed there.
Normally, I use my Amex Plat FHR to book at the Venetian/Palazzo so the change was exciting. 
When we booked the only room available was the City Room and bummed there was no other option available as I wanted to stay in a room with a balcony. Though you maybe given an upgrade but it also being a few days before NYE I didn't take the chance and my wife slipped a $100 between the card and id. It seemed to work but not entirely sure because when the lady took her cards she just put it off to the side and ignored it but then called the manager to see if upgrades were available. I do think she did notice at some point there was cash in between but not sure if the extra cash helped us. Anyways, she said we were given a multi-tier upgrade in the boulevard tower on the 67th floor over looking the fountains. The room was amazing! A great view of the fountains and down the strip definitely the best view in Vegas. 


Check-In: You can use the separate invited guest room or whatever it is called to check-in/out. We didn't use it as it wasn't open at 8am when we got there. Upgrade given but not sure cause we gave extra cash or from the edit perk. 


Room: Clean room, very spacious, with large bathroom, and two sinks. Overall the room was a bit dark even with the blinds open and all the lights on but it was still very nice. Furniture was a bit outdated but nothing major or to complain about. I do appreciate the room slippers in the room and also the fridge for personal use.  Clean towels, bed and furniture overall with no visible stains or markings. The balcony was clean and well kept. Our room was facing the fountains and Las Vegas Blvd and even with the balcony sliding door shut we could still hear the street noise in the afternoon. Plenty of outlets to plug in your chargers, a long desk to get some work done, couch that looked clean and two TVs. 


Food: $100 dining credit can be used at a lot of MGM property restaurants. List acceptable restaurants on the welcome letter QR code.
We used ours at the Chandelier bar for some drinks and 4 drinks basically covered it. Gymkhana the new Indian restaurant in Aria is on there. For breakfast we decided just to do to-go order at The Henry which took about 20 minutes. Food at Henry was good, avocado toast, omelet and pancakes were delicious and plentiful for the two of us. EggSlut is on the list of approved breakfast spots along with Wicked Spoon. EggSlut always had a crazy long line so we didn't go. If you like the Japanese spot Zuma unfortunately it is not on the list for dining credit.


Late Checkout: We didn't ask about this at check-in and kept forgetting to ask. I called the front desk on the night of the 30th day before checking out and they said the latest we can stay is 1pm which was fine since our flight back home was at 4pm. Make sure to confirm late check-out when checking in.


Check Out: Used the separate room for invited guest room to check out and it was pretty simple. We confirmed we didnt owe anything for any of the room charges for the bar or breakfast credit and we were on our way. They did offer us champagne in the room but they also had water and coffee available so that was a nice touch.


Casino: Limits for tables varied throughout the day. Craps was $15 in the morning while all other card games were at $25 in the morning and early afternoon. But by the time evening rolled around the table limits were $25-50 at craps and $50+ at other card tables. Didn't play a whole lot at this casino though. Casino floor does get packed with a lot of people walking around between the different properties but not a big deal.


Overall very happy with the stay at Cosmo in Vegas! You can't beat the location of the Cosmo and the rooms are amazing especially the ones with the balcony. Next time I would love to get a wraparound room. The fact you can use the dining credit at a large variety of MGM properties was actually really nice. Getting a Uber was simple, walking to Aria or Bellagio was a breeze with signs pointing you in the right direction. Staff and dealers were friendly. Though the Venetian/Palazzo are our main place to stay we would definitely come back to Cosmo.",3,1768196882.0,ChaseSapphire,0,1.0,False

We have been through a lot of different phases of closeness and distance over the years. Since 2021, after I got out of a 6 year toxic relationship and moved back to the city that we met in, I felt our friendship had become much closer and more intimate.

This last few years my romantic life has been a mess. Since she is my closest friend, I always go to her to talk out my relationship and dating issues, the most recent being an extremely traumatic experience. After going through this experience and leaning on her a lot and doing a lot of venting, she finally let me know that she felt the friendship didn’t have space for her to share some of the hard things she was going through, including a traumatic event she had just been through. This was a wake up call for me to be less divulging about the drama in my life, but it also made me feel insecure about sharing any stressful parts of my life at all.

I feel like we have grown apart so much and don’t really connect the way we used to, in part due to busy work schedules and living a fair distance from each other.

Today we met up for coffee and a walk after a few weeks since our last hang out. The conversation felt stale and I felt like she was so disengaged and uninterested. I asked her if everything was ok and mentioned she seemed so quiet. She said everything was ok. She said she was tired but couldn’t really explain why. The conversation was mostly me asking her questions about what’s been going on in her life lately and a lot of awkward pauses in between me asking questions. I noticed she was humming or singing in those awkward pauses. At the end of our walk she pulled out an AirPod from her ear and put it back in the case. I realized she had been listening to music the whole time. I felt like this was so strange! I’ve never known her to keep an AirPod in like that while we were hanging out. For me personally, I know it would be completely distracting. Maybe it’s some sort of coping mechanism? But it made me feel like she didn’t want to be there or like she wanted the distraction so she didn’t have to engage in the conversation.

Am I wrong for feeling hurt and kind of disrespected by this? I’m wondering, should I attempt a deeper talk with her or just let things play out and give our friendship some space?

1qamtff,https://www.reddit.com/r/trintellix/comments/1qamtff/side_effects_of_tapering_off_of_trintellix/,Side effects of tapering off of Trintellix?,"(TLDR; Feeling constant fatigue and weird bouts of drowsiness + dizziness throughout the day three weeks after weaning off of 10mg of Trintellix.)

It has been around three weeks since I got off of Trintellix. I was on a 10mg dose for anxiety for about two months and then I decided to taper off because I was feeling depressed, a problem I didn’t have before I took the medication. I tapered off by splitting the pill in half (to the best of my ability, as the pill is more teardrop-shaped) and taking the split pill for about six days.

Nearing two weeks since getting off of this medication, I started getting really strange side effects. I was feeling tired throughout the day, no matter how much I slept; I have had a problem like this for a few years but it presented more mild such as always being up to take a nap, but still awake through the day. I used to be on 50mg Zoloft, which may have caused this problem as well. Despite my fatigue my body also feels shaky and weak with my mind racing like I drank coffee (maybe just anxiety?). I also often feel a bit dizzy and disassociated from reality.

What freaks me out the most is the random attacks of tiredness I get throughout the day. It hits me like a truck around 8 pm (also, note that I go to bed around 12 or 1 am, so it doesn’t feel like a regular feeling of tiredness). I feel really tired and a little dizzy as if I took medication that makes you drowsy. Not sure if people relate to this, but I would describe it as taking dramamine. You suddenly feel like you have to take a nap immediately, you’re dizzy, and your body doesn’t feel like moving, though I can still move my limbs with no problem. I have mini attacks of this drowsiness through the day as well that last a few seconds like a zap, minus the electric feeling, but for some reason the major feeling of it has a schedule.

All I can do about feeling this way is cry and be anxious. Every day I fear that I have some major illness I didn’t catch in time like cancer and that my death is near. It sounds really dark and probably irrational, but I can’t help but feel this way.

I just wanted to ask this to see if anyone has felt this way from stopping the medication and to hopefully reassure my anxiety.",1,1768196716.0,trintellix,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

[Sri Lanka Tour Packages](https://easternsojourns.com/destinations/sri-lanka/) \- You know that feeling when you’re staring at your screen, three coffee cups deep, and the only thing more crowded than your inbox is the city outside your window? We’ve all been there—craving a total reset that doesn’t involve a 15-hour flight or a mountain of visa paperwork. That’s exactly why a hop across the water to Sri Lanka isn’t just a vacation; it’s the immediate breath of fresh air your soul has been asking for. 

Imagine waking up to the mist rolling over the emerald tea plantations of Nuwara Eliya, the air so crisp it feels like a secret. By midday, you’re not navigating traffic, but wandering through the ancient, sun-drenched ruins of Sigiriya or sharing a quiet moment with a herd of wild elephants in Minneriya. With Eastern Sojourns, we don’t just ""book a tour""; we curate those specific, quiet moments of wonder that bridge the gap between a standard holiday and a life-changing journey. 

The beauty of the ""Eastern Sojourn"" approach is that we handle the invisible details so you can stay present in the visible ones. From the seamless luxury of private transfers to the hand-picked boutique stays that feel more like homes than hotels, your only job is to decide whether you want to spend your afternoon on a gold-sand beach in Bentota or exploring the colonial charm of Galle Fort. We’ve perfected the logistics specifically for travelers from India, ensuring your itinerary is as efficient as it is enchanting. 

But why choose a ""package"" when you can have a partnership? Most travel sites give you a list of hotels and a price tag; we give you a narrative where you are the protagonist. Whether you are a solo adventurer looking for hidden trails, a couple seeking a romantic sanctuary, or a family ready for a cultural deep-dive, our expertise ensures your Sri Lankan story is told exactly the way you’ve always imagined it. 

Spaces for our bespoke seasonal departures are filling up fast, and we’d hate for you to miss out on the perfect window for the island's best weather.

We have been through a lot of different phases of closeness and distance over the years. Since 2021, after I got out of a 6 year toxic relationship and moved back to the city that we met in, I felt our friendship had become much closer and more intimate. This last few years my romantic life has been a mess. Since she is my closest friend, I always go to her to talk out my relationship and dating issues, the most recent being an extremely traumatic experience. After going through this experience and leaning on her a lot and doing a lot of venting, she finally let me know that she felt the friendship didn’t have space for her to share some of the hard things she was going through, including a traumatic event she had just been through. This was a wake up call for me to be less divulging about the drama in my life, but it also made me feel insecure about sharing any stressful parts of my life at all. I feel like we have grown apart so much and don’t really connect the way we used to, in part due to busy work schedules and living a fair distance from each other. Today we met up for coffee and a walk after a few weeks since our last hang out. The conversation felt stale and I felt like she was so disengaged and uninterested. I asked her if everything was ok and mentioned she seemed so quiet. She said everything was ok. She said she was tired but couldn’t really explain why. The conversation was mostly me asking her questions about what’s been going on in her life lately and a lot of awkward pauses in between me asking questions. I noticed she was humming or singing in those awkward pauses. At the end of our walk she pulled out an AirPod from her ear and put it back in the case. I realized she had been listening to music the whole time. I felt like this was so strange! I’ve never known her to keep an AirPod in like that while we were hanging out. For me personally, I know it would be completely distracting. Maybe it’s some sort of coping mechanism? But it made me feel like she didn’t want to be there or like she wanted then distraction so she didn’t have to engage in the conversation. Am I wrong for feeling hurt and kind of disrespected by this? I’m wondering if I should attempt a deeper talk with her or just let things play out and give our friendship some space.",1,1768196614.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I’m an engineer from a Tier-1 college with 11+ years of experience in the Indian startup ecosystem. Over the years, I’ve worked across business & strategy roles and have been part of 4 unicorn startups.

I’m now planning to start something of my own and am actively looking for a co-founder.

What I want to build
- The goal is to build a capital-efficient business:
- ₹2 lakh+ monthly net profit without external funding
- With the right execution and funding (if/when needed), scale it to ₹100 Cr revenue in ~5 years
- I do have the ability to raise capital, but I strongly believe funding should be raised only when it truly adds value, not by default

I have a few ideas in mind, but I’m very clear that execution > idea. If I find the right co-founder and we align well, I’m open to pivoting or even changing the idea entirely based on mutual discussion.

Expectations from a co-founder
- Age: 32+ (so we’re aligned in life perspective, maturity, and decision-making)
- 7–8+ years of solid work experience
Comfortable putting in some initial capital (~₹10L)
(The plan is not capital-heavy, but skin in the game matters)

Location: Bangalore (preferred for working closely). If this resonates with you, feel free to comment or DM.

This episode contains themes of **loss, parental absence, and emotional distress**. Viewer discretion is advised.

How will you feel if your parents who loved you glitched out of reality? How will you feel if you are about to forget your own parents 10 hours? How will they feel? This is Episode 6: The Message In The Machine of my original anime project.

\[ Scene 1: Hikari's parents' house \] - Time: (Present) 2:40 pm

Akari sitting on the chair wondering.

Hikari: ""hey. Hey Akari! From Earth to Akari"" shouts in his ears ""AKARI!!""

Akari falls with the chair pulling a picture of Hikari's family: ""Aw, what?!""

 The frame slips from Akari's hand. When it hits the floor, a hairline crack crawls across the glass — splitting Hikari's image from her parents.

Hikari: ""hey! You broke that picture!""

Akari: ""its your fault for shouting in my ears!""

Hikari: ""you zoned out, did you solve this hint?""

Akari: ""oh..its clear..type HikariILU""

Hikari: ""what? Is it that simple? What does it mean anyway?""

Akari: ""oh. In ""Hello, kari"" if you take the ""H"" and put it beside ""kari"" with an ""i"" it will be ""Hikari"". It makes sense since its your parents. Anyway if you tried writing the numbers ""8965632"" on the computer's keyboard, it will look like a ""3"". Many people used to use the sign ""<3"" to symbolize a heart before emojis existed. So the password means that he loves you. And if you take the first letters of the sentence ""I Love You"" it will be ""ILU""""

Akari gets to the computer and starts typing the password. The computer opens.

Akari while moving the mouse clicking on the ""File Explorer"": ""so lets see what we have here...""

Akari finds a Word written on it "" notes, date: 1/6/2025"" he opens the Word while saying: ""I think I found something useful!.."" looking around him ""Hikari?..wait..what was her second name?"" he stays silent for a moment thinking, then he realizes something ""wait..whoever disappeared..I got a theory..wait where is Hikari?"" then he starts worrying, and panicking.

Akari shouts: ""HIKARI!""

then he starts seeing everything around him in black and white vision, starts trembling, feeling that he is almost losing his mental stability, but interrupts him, suddenly he hears a sound of sobbing from a nearby room, his expressions fade, he rushes to the room to find Hikari covering herself in a white blanket: ""oh Hikari-chan, you are here""

He goes sits on the bed beside her: ""Hikari. Crying won't bring them back. If you want them back you need to solve this case. Crying will just waste our time. We have 9 hours before midnight, and we will probably start forgetting even before it.""

Hikari shouts: ""You don't understand how i feel since you don't have parents!..oh"" then she goes silent for a moment realizing what she said.

Akari's face goes pale. He stands up: 'I.I will be in the living room reading your father's notes."" 

Hikari: ""S.sorry..I.I didn't mean to mention that topic...""

Akari: ""I.Its fine. You are technically right anyway."" 

then he leaves the room with a pale face.

Hikari regretting what she did: ""what the hell did I do?! He came to calm me down I just shouted at him mentioning the most sensitive topic for him?!""

\[ Scene 2: In the living room \] - Time: (Present) 3:00 pm

Akari sitting in front of the computer with serious expressions. 

Akari: ""What the heck?!"" 

The Word is empty pages.

Hikari appears behind him, standing while keeping her distance: ""He wrote it with white font color""

Akari selects everything in the word then text appears with the blue background. He changes the color to black.

""1/6/2025

I noticed something weird going on where my pen moved alone without any logical cause, maybe I was hallucinating?

2/6/2025

No I wasn't! Before I sleep yesterday I was sure I closed the T.V. I woke up and found it on! Also my small note was placed somewhere else.

3/6/2025

I believe there is some Other World, I am going to call it ""The Forgotten Leftovers"" where forgotten stuff go there by the universe. The universe cleans up. My prove is that I went to meet my friend but he glitched out in front of me.

4/6/2025

I believe that the universe removes our memories about those people who glitch out and it all happens at midnight since I don't remember having a friend. 

I made a small experiment on a zebrafish by separating it from its pears and after about 10 hours it glitched out of existence, that means anyone who gets forgotten the universe sends him to the Other World.

5/6/2025

I think if it was like that my friend wouldn't have glitched out of reality though, so I have a theory since I couldn't remember my friend's second name before he glitch that its about the second name not your first name.""

Akari whispering to himself: ""That's my exact theory."" 

Akari stands up.

Hikari: ""What are you planning to do?""

Akari: ""I believe that there is a way to get them back but we need to visit the library first for some books"" 

Akari leaves heading to a nearby library while Hikari follows him still keeping her distance.

\[ Scene 3: At home \] - Time: 1:00 am (Past)

Kenji drinking coffee with Kaito, while Daichi left.

Kenji: ""so..how can you go back to the ""Remembered World"" ?""

Kaito: ""what?""

Kenji: ""You said there is a way right?""

Kaito: ""yes I did but..."" walking toward Akari's bedroom, staring at Akari sleeping ""...won't it be fun watching the detective solve the case?""

Kenji: ""what? Why don't you just tell us the way to go back?""

Kaito: ""chill. If the way was that easy I wouldn't have been still here you know?""

Kenji: ""What are we going to do then?""

Kaito: ""just watch the detective solve the case.""

after credits...

\[ Scene 4: Hikari's parents' home \] - Time: (Present) 5:00 pm

Akari left the computer on. The mouse scrolls down from its own to show a continue to the dairy

""6/6/2025

I discovered a way to summon people from the Other World..but its so dangerous that it may lead to DEATH!""

I got a brand-new ilavie K1 pro for Christmas. I swear I set it up correctly. I've read the instructions over and over.

There is no water coming out of this machine. The reservoir is full. The little red stopper has been removed. The machine is plugged in and has had time to pre-heat. I have tried to follow the instructions in the booklet, and the ones on the sticker on the side (below) but there is no combination of any input that will get this machine to really do anything but make a motor sound for a few minutes. Occasionally I'll get like 2 drops out of the steam valve. If i use the steam button and then turn the dial it switches from a motor sound to a clanking sound. What do you recommend?

Normally I'd be able to go online and find other sources for this machine, but there's literally nothing. The only ""support info"" is an outlook email address. Based on what else I'm seeing out there, there is probably air in the pipes since it's just getting started and i need to run water through it, but nothing seems to happen, ever?

Any advice?

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

I’m an engineer from a Tier-1 college with 11+ years of experience in the Indian startup ecosystem. Over the years, I’ve worked across business & strategy roles and have been part of 4 unicorn startups.

I’m now planning to start something of my own and am actively looking for a co-founder.

What I want to build
-The goal is to build a capital-efficient business:
-₹2 lakh+ monthly net profit without external funding per cofounder
-With the right execution and funding (if/when needed), scale it to ₹100 Cr revenue in 5-7 years
- I do have the ability to raise capital, but I strongly believe funding should be raised only when it truly adds value, not by default

I have a few ideas in mind, but I’m very clear that execution > idea. If I find the right co-founder and we align well, I’m open to pivoting or even changing the idea entirely based on mutual discussion.

Expectations from a co-founder
- Age: 32+ (so we’re aligned in life perspective, maturity, and decision-making)
- 7–8+ years of solid work experience
- Comfortable putting in some initial capital of 10 lakhs. (The plan is not to start something capital heavy, but skin in the game matters)
- Long-term mindset, high ownership, and willingness to build from zero

Location:
Bangalore (preferred for working closely). If this resonates with you, feel free to comment or DM.

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!possible controlling behavior!< 

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/13ABJFpc1C)  **May 7, 2024** 

My wife (35f) and I (35m) have been married for 15 years and we've been together for 20 years. We have two kids (12,14) we absolutely adore and work tirelessly to provide the best possible life for them. For the past 3 years, things have been somewhat bumpy. I understand that our kids are at an age where they require a ton of our attention and resources with school, band, club sports, and other extracurriculars and I'm aware of the physical and emotional toll that can have on marriages. 

However, for these past 3 years, my wife and I have had very little intimacy and very little sex and we've been trying very hard to work on that aspect of our relationship. This past year has been the most difficult and by far the darkest year in our marriage. We didn’t talk very much, we essentially became roommates coparenting our kids under the same roof. It was very depressing and very demoralizing. It was to the point where we began contemplating divorce and it became very dark and gloomy in the household because of that. 

We began seeking help with both individualized therapy and couples therapy and it seems to have helped some. Little by little we started to get along and started to have deeper conversations about what our marriage looks like and what we would love for it to look like. This is where it gets tough. As time passed, my wife started to tell me she no longer was ""in love with me"" and that she only saw me as a ""best friend."" That she only loved me in a very platonic way, and this was one of the main reasons she didn’t have any desire for intimacy and let alone sex. This was very shocking to me and quite frankly, I was devastated. I because angry and depressed and I couldn't fathom the thought that I was no longer wanted or desired by the person I felt completely in love with. Things began to deteriorate again and not long after, we were back to square one. I sat down with her one afternoon and had a heart to heart and began to ask questions about where the root of this problem lies, and her answer was ""I don't know"" and that ""I have built up resentment towards you but I don't know where it stems from."" As you can imagine, this provides very little to no insight into how to approach this. 

I'm puzzled, I'm frustrated and I do not know what to do at this point. Currently, we've arrived at a place where she says that she has no sex drive and no desire for intimacy or connection. She says that all she wants is simply ""companionship"" which basically means our coparenting roommate dynamic. I asked her what I could possibly do or what is it about me that is so unattractive or undesirable and she her response is always ""I don't know."" She stated that she does ""love"" me but its not the same. That she has been feeling disconnected for years and that our marriage just takes up too much work. Her focus is only the children for now and that my coparenting contributions are ""meaningful"" to her in our home. 

I'm at a loss and I'm mainly venting about my frustration. It's tough to realize that the person you love has no feelings for you. I feel like at this point I'm only here to contribute financially and as a parent. I feel like what she means with ""companionship"" is that she's comfortable with the convenience of having a good father for our kids and my financial contribution to the household. In regard to intimacy and/or sex, she basically told me that its not something she’s interested in or wants at this time. She mentioned that the only way to get to a point for any of that is to be intoxicated which o believe is incredibly awful and very wrong. I told her I do not think forcing herself to have sex or be intimate by drinking or smoking is good and I declined to be a part of that which to my surprise, it upset her and made her more distant. 

We're both extremely honest and transparent. We've never cheated on each other and we are always free to look through each others phones, emails, socials, etc. and we hardly ever do. I asked her if there was someone else and she declined. Honestly, I believe her. We then peacefully went through each other’s things and as expected, it was clean. We've always been very forward, even with the hard topics so I don't smell nor feel any foul play or infidelity. 

Am I wrong for declining to only be intimate or have sex when she’s intoxicated? (I'm firm on my stance of not partaking in this ""only when I'm high or drunk"" sex because it doesn’t sit well with me.) I do not know how to help our situation and I'm starting to become a bit anxious and desperate. We're both fairly young and healthy individuals and good looking. We both have good standing careers and are good parents. I'm just not sure how our lives could have driven us to this point. I'd love some outside perspective on this matter and some insight on how to address something like this. It feels so awful to be unwanted and undesired by my own spouse. I hate it. 

tl;dr: My wife of 15+ years is no longer in love with me and doesn’t know way and now says she can only have sex while intoxicated or I need to settle for a platonic sexless marriage and she doesn’t know why that is but it is what it is and I'm in need of insight or advice. 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS/MISSING REASONS** 

**Commenters looked at his history and found they were swingers** 

> We did some swinging in the past. That was fun for some time. We mutually decided to stop doing it and we have established it’s not the case. When we were swinging however, our marriage seemed to be in a good place. This IS something we did disclose with our couple therapist and made sure to include it to make sure we’re not neglecting an obvious potential issue. 
>
> I will say, I did ask my wife if what she experienced during swinging is something that is affecting her view on our relationship and she said it wasn’t. Our swinging experience was always together and it was very sex driven. Nothing really emotional or “poly”. Truth is, I have to believe her at her word. I have no reason to distrust her. To date, she’s always been very forward and never afraid of dealing things head on. No matter how painful. 

**If this is a consequence of swinging** 

>This issue existed long before the lifestyle. 

**&** 

> I agree that swinging wasn’t a solution in the end. Never was meant to be, it was more of discovering or exploring if she felt any different. If that was the case, we agreed we would talk about and if we arrive at the conclusion that “myself” is the problem and she has no problem with other men, we would amicably part ways. However this wasn’t the case. She didn’t like sex nor intimacy there either. She was very much in control of that whole swinging situation. And yes, I went along with it. What gives? It felt very organic and it was her “effort” if you will, to discovering more and learning more about our current issue. I saw it as a means of learning if I’m the problem and was very much ready to accept that. It turns out it wasn’t the case.

> You’re absolutely right about the fact that the swinging experience had things/changes that will impact our marriage and lives forever. For example, the best thing swinging taught us (even above sexual exploration) was the level of transparent and open communication it requires.  We would literally have mental orgasms having dialog with such intentionality.  We implemented that in ALL our lives and areas including parenting with our children. She even agrees that we’re thankful for that takeaway from our swinging.  Honestly, I cannot stress it enough with people here. Yes, we explored swinging, however it was actually a positive experience. When we decided to stop, it was because it felt natural and organic to just do so. In fact, we met with that couple who we mesh super well with the night before. We actually enjoyed the actual friendship and even spent time as vanilla friends. So it wasn’t because of something negative. Wife mentioned that it certainly wasn’t any better and since she’s not enjoying the sex we both agreed there’s no point to this. I agreed and we moved on and we’re still friends with those people because it’s great.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/7RtncszQtz)  **May 15, 2024**  

I wanted to give you guys an update of how the therapy session with my wife went this week. Not sure if this is helpful or not but I took many of the responses/comments/suggestions from my initial post and put together some things I wanted to discuss with our couples therapist to help us navigate some of the core issues that may be affecting this situation. 

One of the main things that is the ""buzz word"" of this has been the term ""resentment"" and it has been really eating me up inside knowing my wife keeps telling me she doesn't know why she's resentful or doesn't know why this is affecting her emotionally/mentally. I brought this up with our therapist once again and resurfaced the conversation about being married for so long (15yrs) and being together since we ere 14yrs old. Our long history of growing up and how having children when she was 19yrs old (me 20) significantly changed the trajectory of our lives. We experience sever poverty and many hardships in the process and we essentially had zero social life for the past 10 years because we were so busy raising babies (2 kids now ages 12 &14). She followed up with tons of questions directly mostly at my wife about her feelings towards this and 90% of the responses were very ""our kids"" focused. It definitely felt like she was afraid of saying ""yes it sucked"" because she would feel guilt or shame because it would imply she regrets the kids. I mentioned this in  the session and the therapist encouraged her to look at this outside of the lens of being a mother and to try to view it a bit more selfishly and individually and it was very eye opening. My wife mentioned that she was very frustrated with the fact that we did miss out on many things in life. She also was very clear in saying ""I do not think I missed out on other partners or dating or partying but I certainly lost all my friends."" This was huge because one of the big pieces that has caused a strain in our lives is how silo'd and isolated we've been (again busy raising kids). I followed up by reminding her that it's important to have good friends and to make time for herself and her friendships. 

For the past 3+ years, we've had multiple conversations about friends and how it is important to have them in life. Specially when you have similar peers that can help in many areas of life that perhaps we have no experience navigating and even simply for enjoyment. It has always been something my wife avoids, even  though she's always been someone who needs that external stimuli. The main reason for her not investing in friends or even herself has always been ""the kids."" Like I mentioned earlier in this post, 90% of the answers have to relate to ""the kids"" to some degree. 

At this point in our session I started to feel like there was a common denominator (the kids) in most of the frustrations and problems she was experiencing. So I simply asked her ""Do you think you may be upset at me because I'm responsible for these kids in the sense that I got you pregnant so young?"" I wasn't ready but she said that she was upset at me for that. She also followed up with the fact that she knows that's unreasonable because it ""takes 2 to tango."" I did feel like it was progress because it kind of gave us something to work on and help alleviate some of these ""burdens"" so we agreed to invest more time in nurturing good friendships both together and individually. 

Towards the end of the session, we began to discuss what actionable items we would take from this session. At this point, it was still all very ambiguous and blurry as to what the outcomes were. I was very direct and very forward in asking my wife what her plan is moving forward. (NOTE: I had decided prior to the session that should my wife say the same thing about being a coparenting roommate that I would take the 180 approach and essentially do me) She started basically saying the same thing, that she doesn't have any desire to be intimate or sexual with me as of now and that she loves me immensely and she feels bad for not being there for me (as mentioned in my first post). 

I also brought up the brief swinging that happened, to which for the 50th time said it wasn't a problem. I agree with her on this. This was something that was a ""mechanical"" approach for a solution to a problem that was very much in existent when we tried this. We (both) really have no issue to this. We know it happened, we tried it and mutually stopped and turned the page. 

I also brought up other life events that may cause resentment and really we ended up not getting anywhere else as far as the root for resentment which was discouraging. 

I then basically expressed to my wife that I will not be ok with that arrangement. I told her that I've really done everything I can and that this issue really has reached a point where it has nothing to do with me or require me to do anything that I'm currently not doing. I was very direct and saying that I will not be accepting this dynamic and that I need to be with someone who is actively involved in our marriage, works towards resolutions and is very much interested in maintaining an active intimacy and sexual relationship. I expressed how I am not going to be a ""convenience"" and that there was more to life than being roommates and coparents. I made sure she knows I love her dearly and that I do want this to work for the better. I also told her that I'm fully committed to this marriage so long as she is as well and that is she wasn't, its ok, however I will not be a part of something where these efforts are not reciprocated. I told her I have no plans of leaving, and I do not want a divorce, however, I made it clear that if this dynamic continues that divorce will be the only outcome. 

Of course tears were involved and it was a very bleak and sad ending to the session. Still nothing was said and I walked out very discouraged and very determined to start working on the 180 as soon as we left the room. It's painful and very difficult because much of the 180 requires you to be very short and cold and transactional. The saddest part is realizing, this dynamic already is very cold and transactional. 

Here is where it gets VERY interesting. I started working on implementing many of the 180 recommendations that same day. I mentioned to my wife that, ""hey, things are going to be a bit different moving forward. I'm going to honor her roommate/coparent dynamic without reproach and that it should be no mistake that I am not happy here and I am never going to be ok with it but I am done working on it if she wasn't going to work on it."" She agreed and went to bed. I started to build distance and started to basically focus on myself. Very short and transactional. She asked for help on some of her personal things to which I declined and it really shocked her. She was upset saying I was being petulant. I explained to her that, she is now fully in charge of her own life and her own issues. We didn't talk all day and we only spoke when necessary. Few days I keep this going and she's very visibly upset and stressed. I typically react to that with gestures of help or nurturing but I didn't this time. That night she was crying telling me she's stressed and she things something is wrong with me because I'm ""indifferent."" I simply listened, then I told her  that this is the dynamic she proposed and that I'm simply (much like her) taking care of myself and focusing on myself. I'm not going to lie, it has been VERY hard to be cold and distant because as I mentioned before, I love her and I wish I could hold her and love on her. However, I know this is somewhat manipulative in a way just to get her way and still keep me in the friendzone. So I've been staying the course. 

We're now going on a week of this 180 and let just say, there has been MANY changes on her side. I think she is starting to realize there is more to me than just ""friends and coparenting."" I sent her a text a few days ago essentially itemizing bills and separating the financial responsibilities 50/50 and SHE LOST HER SHIT. She basically told me it was ""out of left field"" to which I responded ""hey, friends go in 50/50 and as your friend I expect nothing less."" This was very eye opening because it gave me a glimpse of I'm really taken for granted and how her level of comfort and convenience at my expense is really overlooked. I pushed through anyways and basically told her that this is the new dynamic she asked for and that its still a ""bargain"" because she would have to be 100% if she was on her own. 

I'll wrap up with this. While the 180 has been working in many different areas, I am still very much sad about the overall situation. There have been MANY eye opening statements being said and realization that have not been pleasant to encounter. It has also sparked new energy and new efforts on her side as well. She's definitely seeking to talk to me more often and while its hard to turn down, I hope if things improve, this continues to happen. I've also noticed that she's making more time for herself aside from being a mom which is HUGE because she pretty much neglected herself for years. I'm very pleased seeing her be more herself. My hope is that as we work on ourselves, the marriage improves. There really is no telling at this point where this will go. We are very much cordial and amicable even to this day and that's a very good sign. Boundaries are set and expectations are very clear and I feel that no matter the outcome, I will be at peace with everything that has been done.  We're still going to continue the couples therapist until we either rekindle our marriage or end up in divorce. I feel like having this nonbiased third party really helps as a witness and as a guide through this. No matter what I will always love my wife, however, I will not participate in a sexless, intimacy less marriage because we both deserve better. 

Thank you all for all the kind words and recommendations and feedback. This will be my last post on  this topic and I wish you all the best. 

TL;DR: My wife friend-zoned me wants to just coparent at my expense but I started the 180 method to try and find a solution because she doesn't want to work on us which seems to be working on getting her out of her rut and helping me discover more about how she feels. Also, therapy is paramount and highly recommend to all couples. 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS** 

**CatsGambit** 

> So, I'm going to assume that your wife has a lucrative job and you are both going 50/50 on childcare, as you both work and share children. Because otherwise, this approach is just plain financially abusive (and if you're planning on saying ""I won't pay the bills unless you have sex with me"", sexually abusive as well).
>
> Assuming that is the case and you aren't a total POS, I'm actually interested in how this works out for you. I feel like I'm in an unstated, similar situation- we both work and have blended finances, but we don't go to bed together or eat together, have barely any intimacy (a kiss or two, hugs every couple days), and spend.... maybe 8 hours a week together, just the three of us (him, me, and the toddler). Even less just the two of us- maybe 3 hours a week? Otherwise, he is on his game, or out playing sports, watching youtube, or whatever else he does. It barely feels like a friends situation, let alone a marriage. I'm curious how she handles it, as the spouse that presumably was pulling away first- I hope you keep us updated. 

**OOP** 

>> Yes we both have degrees, good careers and while I make significantly more money, her salary is very proficient and above average. The 50/50 was not to cripple nor hurt her financially (that is cruel) but mostly to send a message on what a “roommate” dynamic looks like in the real world. 
>>
>> I really dislike how people immediately jump to conclusions about the finances as a way of manipulating her. It’s not the case at all. Plenty of money left over after bills. However 50/50 means she has less “whatever” money AND the understanding that roommates share everything equally. 
>>
>> Prior to this 180 approach, we did everything together and with our kids. We always saw ourselves as a “unit” that do things together. Both alone and with the kids too. That’s changed now where I’m choosing to focus on more independent type of pastimes and focus. That is what has sparked her reaction and realization of “there’s more” than just roommates here. 


**When asked what if she leaves for another man** 

> Interesting. She has no shortage of men hitting on her and we’re by no means jealous people. So I’ve witnessed this multiple times and her reactions are somewhat indifferent. I will say, if another man for her was the answer, she’d tell me or she’d have some inkling maybe? 
>
> There’s no telling but I think the problem is deeper than superficial attention from a different person. 


[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/xFEb3DxpCT)  **July 19, 2024**


I debated for a long time on whether to submit an update on this matter. A few significant changes have taken place and I felt it would be good to not only share with you, but also to allow myself to process all of this in a uniform way. We're now almost 9 weeks in on the 180 method I mentioned I was starting and it started to render some positive reactions from my wife. I explained in the previous posts that she started to notice things that she previously took for granted, started to ask more about my whereabouts and also started to notice I would go out with the kids more often without her and she started to invite herself to which I didn't decline. 

So much has changed and it has changed for what seems to be for the better. This past Memorial Day weekend, my wife asked me if I wanted to go out for coffee because she wanted to talk to me about something. This was HUGE, because I can't recall when the last time my wife asked to ""talk"" to me about something important. I must admit, I was very nervous and worried about what this could be about and my mind was racing with the plethora of scenarios of what it could possibly be. Of course I agreed and we took some time away from the kids to have this conversation at a local coffee shop. 

The talk was very constructive in nature. There was a ton of insightful information about herself that helped me further understand where she is in life both emotionally and mentally. We summarized what the core issues we are encountering are and she asked me for help! This is NEW, and I cannot tell you how excited I was hearing something so sincere coming from my wife who for the last 2+ years has been absent. 

So, after she was through sharing all her thoughts, I proposed a plan that I felt was right for us. This is something that I had been thinking about these last few weeks and I was planning on bringing this up in a few months if I noticed that things were not changing for the better. This ""date"" felt like the right place to share it since it goes hand in hand with what she talked about, and it also relates to the help she was asking me for. 

I started by first acknowledging her feelings and her concerns. I told her they are valid and how she feels is personal to her and that I care that she feels this way because I don't like the thought of her being sad or depressed. I also told her that my goal still is and will always be for us to reconcile and be the ""happily ever after"" we vowed to be for each other and that my love for her is as strong, if not stronger, as it was the day we said ""I Do.""  I continued the conversation by telling her how I felt about the whole situation (read my previous posts for details) and how it affects me every day. I also clarified some things that she mentioned she was feeling because how I have been very distant and monotone (transactional) lately. I explained to her that I was very much trying to protect my feelings and emotions from the rejection and neglect and that it wasn't personal, it was simply me safeguarding myself because I cannot control her, I can only control myself. 

This was a perfect segue way to the core of this approach which is focused on self accountability. I told her that for the longest time I was always working hard to make her happy and do things that I knew she enjoyed or wanted. However, I was always met with rejection and disappointment which caused a load of stress on me. I explained to her that I had to make a change for myself. Afterall, I can only control myself and make the changes that I want for myself. I mentioned how I was starting to implement new habits and routines that help edify me all while still executing all of our shared responsibilities including parenting, finances, and daily living activities. I explained that the goal is to continue to improve myself both as a husband and father, learn more, and be healthier (among other things). She was very receptive to this. She told me that she sees what I'm doing and that she is proud of the changes she has seen. She also told me how she's starting to realize that she feels left behind and that much of the things that have affected her negatively are her own fault. Toward the end of the conversation which was about 3 hours, there was a very high spirit of reconciliation in the room. I told her that my goal is to ultimately make this work, however I was very clear that I was not going to live under the current circumstances. I told her that my heart wants her to be happy even if it means elsewhere and that I also deserve to be happy myself. I also explained that I do not want our children to grow up thinking this was ok or normal because they deserve better as well. She told me she doesn't either, she told me she doesn't know what to do to which I replied, ""lets set some clear goals however, the goals will be for ourselves, NOT for each other.""  

So, here is what we established: 

&#x200B; 

- We are in charge of our own happiness: the key here is that she's not responsible for making me happy, and vice versa. We both need to seek what that personal plan looks like individually. Also, we're both encouraged to include each other in taking those steps if we want, but it is not required. 

&#x200B; 

- We are in control of our own individual lives and our own journey: this means we're both responsible in finding the resources necessary to grow, change and heal. We can definitely help one another when help is requested, however, unsolicited advice or help will not be rendered. 

&#x200B; 

- We are responsible for communicating: this ensures nothing is left unsaid. If it was never brought up or discussed, it never happened. We're not mind readers and we need to take ownership when we fail to communicate. 

&#x200B; 

- Make a list of needs and wants: this gives us both clear direction about meeting each others needs. This also gives us a CHOICE as to what we want/choose to do, compromise on, or decline to do. This list also will not serve as a checklist for accountability! We made it clear we would NOT be bringing this list up for the purpose of arguing, and it was up to the other person to use the list as a tool for growth, transparency or clarification. We concluded that it was up to us to decide if we will be happy doing these things for OURSELVES because we care, not to simply check a box. This was very important in order to establish long term habits and not short term band aids because you cannot ""make"" someone change or do something they don't believe is important. 

&#x200B; 

- Established a deadline (Memorial Day 2025) 

At the end of the conversation we concluded by setting Memorial Day 2025 as a hard stop to evaluate our lives and our progress. We agreed we would do this with the clear understanding that we will independently decide if we are happy here. If we determined we arent happy, we will be getting a divorce. We would also both assume full responsibility for what happened should we get divorced. For example, if needs were not met, it would mean ""my partner chose not to meet them."" This places full responsibility on each other in all areas. The whole process requires that if ""needs were not met,"" the next question should be, ""did we do everything to address this issue?"" If yes, then we will have a clear conscious of what transpired and know we left no stone unturned. IF, however, we ""didn't do everything to address the issue,"" it will mean ""the issue was not important enough for you or didn't care to meet those needs."" (this goes both ways in all areas, like everything else.) We established that the main motivator for change should be ourselves and that if we did that, we would in turn begin  to see beneficial changes towards each other. The goal is to ensure that everything we are doing for one another to meet each others needs is being done because ""we WANT to do it for our spouse, not because he/she asked. Isntead, it was done because I know it makes him/her happy and I love seeing them happy."" I felt it was important to mention to her that we are no longer ""required"" to do anything for each other. It is now more of a ""I want"" to do these things for each other. 

Ultimately, I felt the conversation was very positive and productive. Many tears were shed and lots of hugging ensued. I know this doesn't mean or guarantee anything, however, this has never happened before and I can honestly attribute it to the 180 method (I cannot give anymore insight on this method other than its the only thing I did different and something new happened for what seems to be better). I've decided I will conclude and will refrain from this method moving forward as the plan now has changed. I'm planning to devote myself entirely to not only myself and my growth but to also work on her needs and wants because I WANT her to be happy by my side. She said and agreed she would do the same for herself. We agreed we would help and build each other wherever we request for it and that we will be approaching this as a team. 

As of today, some of the biggest changes I have noticed are her commitment to therapy and mental health. She is taking some antidepressants that are helping her. She is also more confident and in a far better mood more frequently. We have started to explore more ways of intimacy in multiple areas such as physical touch and words of affirmation. Sex is starting to make an appearance which is exciting (side note: sex was very very awkward to start when you've ben abstinent for so long). We've also started to workout together whcih is great and have lost weight which is also very exciting. Overall, communication has improved, and I cannot wait to see where this leads. 

I hope this helps someone out there. I'm still very much interested in your feedback and thoughts on this. You all have been a huge help in giving me hope and insight into this tough journey. Trolls aside, many of you have really been instrumental in my journey both emotionally and mentally. I will not be providing any more updates until Memorial Day next year. I think its now time to keep focusing on myself and start working on all the new opportunities that hopefully will arise with my wife. I wish you all the best in life and your relationships with those you love.


TL;DR: Our marriage took a turn for the better after the 180 method and we're now working on ourselves, each other and rekindling our marriage. We also set a deadline for next year to either remain together or get divorced. 


**NEW UPDATE**

[The Final Chapter & a New Beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/PWuIjied4j)  **Nov 29, 2025**

I realize this final post is far later than I anticipated, and I truly apologize for that. But such is life, and honestly, the timing now feels right. So much has transpired since my last post that it’s hard to capture it all in words, but I’ll do my best to be thorough and as succinct as possible. I know this is my final post on the matter, and I want to offer genuine insight and meaningful takeaways from this difficult journey we’ve been on for the past few years.

Are we still married? Yes.
Are we happy? Yes.
Has it been easy? Absolutely not.

You may be wondering why the “hell no,” and that’s more than fair. The truth is, shortly after my last entry, things got worse—much worse. Just when you think you’ve hit bottom, life has a way of showing you there’s still room below.

Where It All Started to Shift:

In my previous posts, I shared the approach I took and the truths it uncovered—truths that were difficult to accept, including the realization that my wife genuinely didn’t want much to do with me anymore. I had essentially been friend-zoned, and our marriage was drifting into a platonic partnership I didn’t want.

That’s when I used the “180 Method” (Grey Rock Method), originally designed to help victims of infidelity reclaim stability and clarity. And yes—it works. It worked for me tremendously.

I’ve received a ton of hate for choosing this path, but everyone’s situation is different. There is no one-size-fits-all in marriage recovery. I have zero regrets. It helped my wife recognize her own areas for growth, and it helped me rediscover mine. For years I believed I “deserved” the pain I was experiencing because of my flaws—but that’s not true. We all have imperfections, but they don’t strip us of our worth.

During this time, I focused on rebuilding myself—my health, my joy, my identity outside the marriage. I’ve since lost over 23 pounds, ran a marathon, completed two Tough Mudder challenges, developed a consistent exercise and mountain biking routine, started a business, read six books, joined a charity, and raised more than $52,000 for my children’s school.

People misunderstand the 180 Method. It’s not just about how you treat the spouse—it’s about reclaiming you.

Where We Are Now:
The 180 Method gave me the space to focus on myself and my kids while still remaining faithful and committed to the marriage. I gave my wife an ultimatum (see previous posts), and we mutually agreed on what we each needed to work on—along with a timeline.

Was the timeline perfect? No.
Were there hiccups? Constantly.

That’s the nature of relationships. You cannot remove the human element—our flaws, our emotions, our setbacks. This process came with relapses, depression, unrelated conflicts, insecurities, and the need for constant readjustment.

This is where grace and adaptability became essential.

Imagine practicing the 180 Method—which can appear cold and distant—while simultaneously extending unexpected moments of grace. It surprised my wife, and it made a profound difference. It validated the effort we were both putting in and signaled that we were genuinely moving toward healing.

One powerful shift was realizing that my wife reciprocated grace and vulnerability much more easily when she saw me practicing them. We began having deeper conversations—ones I didn’t even realize we needed. Many of those issues were mine. I had to confront my struggle with emotional vulnerability. I grew up in a “macho,” stoic culture where men don’t cry—and that mentality was silently damaging our marriage.

As I worked through that, I learned that allowing myself to be vulnerable didn’t make me weak. It made me accessible. And in turn, it allowed my wife to reach parts of me and care for me in ways I had never truly experienced. That feeling of being cared for—genuinely cared for—was new. And it changed everything.

Where We’re Headed:
As I mentioned, things got worse before they got better. My wife had a serious breakdown early on where she felt everything was over. We hadn’t yet fixed our communication patterns, and counseling helped us realize it was time to shift out of the 180 Method and begin recognizing and validating the progress we both were making.

Once we focused intentionally on communication, grace, vulnerability, and consistent practices of gratitude and emotional expression, things started to transform. Over the months that followed, we chose to show up for each other. Not out of obligation, but out of intention.

Fast forward to today:
Our marriage is nothing like it was a year ago—and nothing like the day I wrote my last post.

Is it perfect? No.
Is it worth keeping forever? Absolutely.

We have a new foundation and a new commitment to the work—not just on our marriage, but on ourselves.

Advice for Anyone Going Through Something Similar: Your marriage can still be something beautiful, even after unimaginable hardship. Remember why you married your partner. Remember the qualities that made them right for you.

But also remember that change starts with YOU—not your partner. You can’t force them to change. You can only do the work on yourself and give them the space to choose their own path.

I recommend the 180 Method/Grey Rock Method because it was essential for me—but it isn’t universal. It worked because it forced both of us to confront truth, discomfort, and growth.

People on Reddit criticized me endlessly for it. But it’s your marriage—not theirs. Only you know what you can live with, what you can’t, and what your relationship truly needs.

Lastly, I genuinely hope this helps anyone navigating a similar situation. I will always be pro-marriage, and I firmly believe couples can overcome even the hardest challenges if they have the desire to do so. Love can be rebuilt. Trust can be rebuilt. Intimacy can be rebuilt.

I now have a marriage filled with renewed love, real emotional connection, and new hope for our future. My wife chooses me every day. We are rebuilding together with honesty, vulnerability, and intention. My children have witnessed resilience, forgiveness, and growth—and that matters deeply to me.

NOTE: I’ll be sharing some resources that really truly helped us later on in a comment. I truly believe it would be beneficial for those interested. 

Remember:
You must go all-in if you want real change.
Love hard, without reservation. Rewire your mindset. Give yourself time and grace. And believe that your marriage can succeed.

I pray that every marriage here finds strength, hope, and a restored path forward.

1qalwy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/tinyhorribles/comments/1qalwy2/blanket_forts_and_boyhood_magic/,Blanket Forts And Boyhood Magic,"It was 1984. I was seven. 

I saw the man limping through the park with his dog. He had a maltball milk carton in his hand. Every time he would pour one out for himself, he’d launch another one into the frigid air and I’d watch the dog snatch it before it hit the ground.

The other kids were bundled up, running on the wooden playset, playing tag in their brightly colored striped poofy jackets. I was by myself on a bench. I was drawing in the wet sand with a mossy stick. My mom was in the parking lot talking to the same people she always talked to at the park. The people who gave her that white powder.

That meant there wouldn’t be any dinner, but maybe there wouldn’t be any hitting either. I turned my attention from the old man and back to my picture. I drew the lines with a furrowed brow and carefully swept away any clumps of sand that had blistered up around them. When I was finished, I threw the stick over my left shoulder.

“Ow!” I turned. The old man was rubbing his eye. I didn’t say anything. I wanted to apologize, but apologizing in my house made things worse. “That’s quite the arm there.”

The old man laughed. He was wearing a hat that looked like Indiana Jones and a long brown coat full of holes. White sprigs of hair bulged out of his hat and burst from his nostrils. His dog, a small matted mutt with a tail that never stopped wagging, was sitting on his haunches, looking at my drawing.

“Are you drawing a knight?”

I nodded.

“Well that super duper. Where’s your mom?”

“She’s back by the car with her friends.”

“I see. Where’s your dad?”

Silence hung in the air.

“He died.” 

“I’m sorry to hear that.”

…

…

“You draw really well, young man. Doesn’t he, Henri?” The dog turned from my drawing and barked. The old man threw the dog two chocolate maltballs and the dog caught them both. “You want a chocolate?”

“Ok.” I put out my hand. The sleeve of the too small wind breaker pulled up. He gave me a couple pieces and he saw one of the cigarette burns just above my wrist. He stared at it before I could pull  my sleeve back down.

“I burned myself on the stove.”

“I see. You know what you need? A magic trick.” He pulled out a deck of cards and shuffled them in the air. It looked like they were floating. I watched him build a sprawling house with them on the sand. When he was finished, he threw a bright white handkerchief over the whole thing. “What does that look like to you?”

“A blanket fort.”

“Precisely. Do you like blanket forts?” I nodded. “I used to build them all the time. So many tunnels and little chambers. I’d get lost in them for hours. Just me in my own little world. A knight in my own little kingdom.” His voice was like a crackling fire. His eyes were like ice. “Nothing could bother me in there. No troubles could find me. There was never a problem that a well built blanket fort couldn’t fix.”

“I guess so.”

“Let me give you something. Everybody deserves a childhood…” He pulled one card out of the fort and it all fell down. It was a joker. “... and a little bit of magic always helps. If you ever lose that magic, it all comes falling down.”

He gave me the card, tussled my hair, and walked away.

\-

My mom left with her friends, so I walked home with some magic in my pocket. I was a latchkey kid, so as soon as I opened the door, I started.

Every blanket, every sheet, every curtain; I used them all. I draped my imagination over the whole house. I propped them up with the chairs from the kitchen table. I used heavy things to keep their edges from falling off of the coffee table and the counters. I took pictures off the walls and hung the sides of sheets from the nails. When I was finished, I stood by the front door and admired what I had built. A labyrinth of fuzzy throws, faded cotton, and frayed flannel. I crawled inside.

There seemed to be no end to it. The tunnels stretched into forever. The lights of the apartment showed through the fabric, but the walls and the ceilings of the blankets were three or four times as high as I was. Higher than the lights would have been. I thought I was imagining it. Why wouldn’t I? When you’re a child, all you have is your imagination, and it can take you anywhere. So I let it.

There was no one to hit me. No one to burn me. No one to tell me I was nothing. 

I walked on. My kingdom didn’t have an end. I thought I might just stay in there forever, and then I heard the front door slam. My mother screamed obscenities. Threatening to hurt me. It echoed through the fort.

She was inside.

I ran.

She was furious. A monster in my maze.

Round and round corners I went. I passed through the legs of the dining room table and the chairs. They towered over me. How could it be so? 

Finally, I crawled out of the entrance. Her monstrous voice was somewhere behind me, lost inside. She couldn’t find her way out. 

On the carpet, just inside the entrance, was the magic card. It must have fallen from my pocket. I reached down and pulled it out of the fort.

Suddenly, every blanket, every sheet, every curtain fell. There was nothing underneath but what I had used to prop them up. My mother’s angry voice was silenced. I never saw her again, but I still have the magic. 

I’ll never let it go.

1qalsn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/1qalsn7/im_playing_through_persona_3_reload_for_the_first/,I'm playing through Persona 3 Reload for the first time and I'm enjoying how the differences from Persona 5 Royal are shaping my roleplay for the protagonist.,"Keep in mind I'm not even past July yet, so please no spoilers.

My only experience with the Persona games so far have been Persona 5 Royal and Persona 5 Strikers, so I wanted to branch out and I got my hands on Persona 3 Reload, since it was affordable and seemed like the easiest one to get into after Royal.

However when it comes to roleplay games I like to...well...roleplay. It's what I did for Fallout 4, Skyrim, Mass Effect, even the South Park games, and it's what I did for Royal and Strikers. Joker/Ren Amamiya obviously has some character traits that'll be there regardless of how you play but I still had fun shaping my version of the character through the way I was playing the game and the choices I was making. I enjoyed coming up with story reasons for why he'd be doing certain things instead of just having the reason be that it'd level up his social skills and confidants.

For example, taking care of the plant in his room gives Ren points in Kindness basically for free without wasting any time, so naturally I did it at every opportunity. But between that, working at Rafflesia in order to further a Mementos quest, and gardening with Haru during her confidant, I came up with the idea that my version of Joker genuinely enjoys taking care of plants and so that became a character trait of his for the rest of my playthroughs, to the point that I continued having him take care of the plant in his room even on NG+ when Kindness is already maxed out because that was just something that the character would do.

Naturally I had ever intention of doing the same with Reload even before I got it. But funny enough I had a small bit of worry that my Makoto Yuki was basically going to end up being essentially just another of my Ren Amamiya because I might end up just doing the same stuff.

But even this relatively early on in the game where I'm at, my roleplay with Makoto is already shaping him into a very different character than Ren, and a big part of that is the differences in how social stats are earned.

For example, studying in Reload honestly feels like the least effective way to level up Academics compared to playing at the arcade or eating the seafood platter at Wakatsu Kitchen, so outside of study groups I pretty much never have Makoto do it. Between how often I'll have him go to the arcade and the social link with Maya, I like the idea that my version of Makoto is a dedicated gamer, which is a contrast to my version of Ren who only gamed occasionally (to raise Guts) and was more about books and movies (which often was the better way to raise social stats compared to other options). This also makes Makoto feel like he's more naturally academically intelligent than Ren is since he doesn't need to study as much.

Ren loved taking care of plants, Makoto does not care about plants, only planting seeds on the roof because the chairman asked him to and he doesn't have to spend any actual time on them.

Ren worked various odd jobs to gather info on Mementos targets and then never went back afterwards, Makoto works at Chagall Café (which raises both Charm and Courage) multiple times because he genuinely enjoys it.

Ren loved his friends and while mixed with a lot of sarcasm and jokes he had no problem showing how much he cared about them, especially his cat best friend. While Makoto feels like he *is* a cat, since he also cares for his friends but acts way more aloof and detached (also he really loves seafood).

Little bit a cheat since I'm kind of roping Strikers in with this too but my version of Ren loves cooking, to the point he rarely had Kawakami making the coffee and curry for him because it was something he preferred to do himself (because it restores more SP) and the first thing he did at every location the team stopped at during their road trip was recipe hunting. My version of Makoto loves to eat...but he is not a cook. He rarely is in the kitchen with the other members of SEES.

I think my favorite difference comes in part because of something I saw after I started interacting more with the Persona 5 fandom, where there were some people who claimed that the true canon Joker prefers older girls/women. I don't know how true or not that is but regardless my version never really struck me as having any kind of particular age preference (other than being of consenting age, of course). His ""canon"" love interest is Haru, who is a year older but honestly doesn't feel that different from him or the others as far as maturity goes.

But hello! Right before school starts this week I wanted to make a new set of sublimation designs. And since my latest anime obsession turned towards this..... Here's a Tamon themed mug and bottle!

Yes, I did actually have a cup of coffee while taking the mug shot. I was going to ask to join the church but I guess we're all more or less in it right? Anyways...

All art is from official sources. Maybe once more anime art arrives I'll eventually get around doing the other members in the future.",5,1768192714.0,TamonsBSide,0,0.78,False

- sometimes still uses baby talk. I don’t mind it too much but I cringe in certain situations

- does not have a license in a driving city

- never worked a job outside her parents catering business 

- lives at home, doesn’t pay rent or bills 

- doesn’t initiate plans ever. But does check up on me by msging

I’ve grown to accept this is the life she wants and she won’t grow independence unless she needs it. What I struggle with is that she never initiates plans, ever. I always initiate. She will
Check on me and messages that she misses me - which is cue she wants me to plan. 

And she will always need to be driven around when we create plans. To her credit, she never gets mad if I can’t pick her up but her parents are her alternate form of transportation. And she repays me by getting coffee or dinner.

Recently she bothered me because I always invite her to my social outings, yet she doesn’t want me to meet the group of people she plays video games with. They are online friends. She says it’s because I have more friends irl so I can pick and choose who she meets - but she’s met majority of them, besides a few. 

So it feels like to me - I’m always initiating, driving her around and she doesn’t let me into her life at all. So im currently “distancing” myself - as in, I’m letting her do the initiation and won’t invite her as much to social gatherings. 

But I feel like I’m AIO because she is very kind, always listens to be, celebrates my wins, and repays me back in favours when I drive her around for when we hangout. So in my mind I feel like I should accept her just as she is and continue how I am…

1qalgjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/coloncancer/comments/1qalgjh/post_sigmoid_resection_recovery/,Post sigmoid resection recovery,"Hey guys
Long time lurker, first time poster. This community has given me a lot of valuable insight and information as I’ve gone through my diagnosis. 
I had surgery 4 weeks ago to remove about 20cm sigmoid colon due to Stage 1 cancer. Very blessed I don’t require further treatment. 

I’ve scoured other posts on this and I know everyone is different, but I’m feeling frustrated at my seemingly erratic digestive system. 
I was given no dietary advice in the hospital, but aimed to follow low fibre. I’ve triggered a couple of flares with a vegan protein powder (didn’t realise it contained fava beans!) and a glass of coke. The last week or so I’ve slowly been able to tolerate some more vegetables and soft fruit. Doing ok with cheese, yoghurt, white carbs, and one coffee a day. 

Yesterday at a friend’s house for lunch and something triggered horrific cramps, gas, nausea and diarrhea. I’m thinking it was the tiny amount of chimichurri I tried which contained raw garlic and jalapeños. I had maybe 1/2 tsp. 

My father in law had a bowel resection 1 week prior to me and he is tolerating all foods and drinks no problem. It’s hard trying not to compare our healing - I’m a healthy 39 year of female, he’s a 74 year old male. 

Just a bit of a vent but also keen to hear what others experiences were like. 
Thanks for reading 🙏

1qalbo6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qalbo6,"All ZWAT skins unlocked, All my decks used to achieve it.","My Best Friend and I have recently finished achieving our ZWAT skins for every character that has one, and have started (perhaps) our ultimate run on 'No Hope', on all Acts. 

I know that this game no longer receives updates, but it is still a great game to play with friends. I know that it can be a difficult game to get in to at first, especially with out the strong multiplayer community that once thrived.

Thus, my decks. While I am not the best player, I have found great enjoyment in using all of the decks, including the starter deck, in our many many runs to achieve the ZWAT skins for all. 

You are welcome to ask questions, and rip in to particular decks, but there is not promise I will respond. I know some of them we used just for the memes, others are actually enjoyable. Others just sucked. I am sure that the avid studier will see the cards the repeat the most and know the build I typically go for.

Enjoy.

Stuck on the fence","I own a 2016 gt3rs, it's been 2 years of joy but in respect of limited earth time, i'd like to swap it out and experience something else plus my CPO warranty runs out in 10 months. A 992.1 turbo s is the front runner currently, i'm aware that it will be more sterile with less soul, however I also own an 800hp mk4 supra, 700 hp terminator and a fox body (all 3 are permanent cars for me) so the raw/analog soul experience can be had in other ways.

The 992 gt3 is appealing due to the manual option especially in the touring trim without the wing, relative rarity and sound. The turbo s is drawing me in with the easy power, comfort and ability to go on road trips. I have 2 4runners that I currently daily but would love to swap the next porsche in for daily activities. We are expecting our first kid in june and stuffing a car seat in the back for cars and coffee seems like a good time? My wife is short so i'm hoping it leaves some space back there lol.

I know the turbo S gets bashed by GT fan boys but it seems like a really great all around super car that avoids the extreme attention you get with other exotics.

Option 3 is extending my warranty for a 4th year if possible and keeping the 3rs, I do love that car.

I don't track my cars, they're just used for light highway racing and spirited back road driving.

Ultimately, the decision is mine and I'll live with it but curious if anybody else who's owned any or all of these has input based on my circumstances.",7,1768192057.0,porsche911,14,0.89,False
