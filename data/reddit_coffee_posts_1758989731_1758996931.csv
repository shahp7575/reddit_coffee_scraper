by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Detroit Tigers vs. Boston Red Sox: A Tale of Two Slumps (With a Side of Hope)**  
*By Your Humorously Analytical Sports Oracle*

The Detroit Tigers (86-74) and Boston Red Sox (88-72) collide in a high-stakes clash that’s less “World Series preview” and more “two teams hoping their luck changes before the laundry list of injuries gets longer.” Let’s break this down with the precision of a stathead and the wit of a late-night host who’s had one too many coffee-infused energy drinks.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Real Underdog Here?

The betting line paints a clear picture: **Boston is the favorite (-123)**, while Detroit (+103) offers a tempting “root for the sad underdog” angle. Converting those American odds to implied probabilities, Boston’s 55% chance to win vs. Detroit’s 49.5%—a gap as wide as the Charles River separating Fenway Park from the Tigers’ collective hopes.

Statistically, Boston’s case is bolstered by their **third-best AL ERA (3.73)**, a **stellar 46-32 home record**, and a recent 6-4 stretch where they outscored foes by seven runs. Meanwhile, Detroit’s **ninth-ranked ERA (3.96)** and a **2-8 freefall** in their last ten games (with a paltry .200 team batting average) make them look like a team playing with one hand tied behind their back—and that hand is writing a resignation letter.

The pitching matchup? **Casey Mize (3.91 ERA, 131 Ks)** vs. **Kyle Harrison (3.58 ERA, 32 Ks)**. Mize’s 14-6 record screams “reliable,” but Harrison’s sub-4.00 ERA and mysterious ability to strand runners (1.19 WHIP) give Boston’s bullpen less reason to panic. Think of it as a chess match: Mize is the aggressive opener, while Harrison is the patient strategist with a net for fly balls.

---

### Injury Reports: “Who’s Not Playing?” Is the Real Question

Boston’s IL reads like a “Where’s Waldo?” for their bench: **Brennan Bernardin** (15-day) and **Vaughn Grissom** (60-day) are MIA, leaving holes in the lineup bigger than a baker’s dozen donuts. Detroit isn’t faring better: **Colt Keith** (10-day) and **Beau Brieske** (60-da

I set a lot of clear boundaries. He was living with his narcissistic parents several states away. He came back here (he lived with me before not this bad) and it got bad. I'm just going to list the frustrations.

He leaves melons on his bed for days at a time open and up to a week just eating out of them with a spoon. (Causing fruit flies)

He doesn't clean up after his pets. (Litter and mouse bedding. I pay for the cat to eat and litter which is fine ig)

We work together because I got him a job at my coffee shop so he could pay his bills.

When I am kind to a friend or a friendly acquaintance he goes and gets grumpy in the back and will say he is fine but be passive about it all day.

He gets upset if I give too much attention to a friend or my brother but not him.

He complains about my music in the car. He complains about my lack of free time, how he never gets to go shopping in the nearest big city (1hr away), asks to be invited on my dates with my bf, gets actually mad when I have my own plans, but I try so hard. 

He is supposed to move this year but doesn't have a date set. And won't talk to me about it.

He has no car and I drive him everywhere with me but when I want a day to be alone he brings up self harm

I feel guilty all the time but I am so busy. I have full time college and work. I only hang out with 1 friend for studying or once every 2 weeks my bf and I go out on a date. 

He says he is trying and I think that's true. 

But idk my other friends say he is narcissistic

He is fairly high functioning. He wants my help with everything tho even if he knows how to do it.

I picked up the book while I was browsing the library stacks for resources to write a research report. The book was clearly misshelved, a pocket-sized journal someone had left tucked in with the actual library books. On its cover was written DO NOT READ, with the name scratched out below, which of course intrigued me enough to open it.

It began:

*“In two weeks, I’m going to kill myself,” I announced to class this morning. And you know how the class responded? Silence.*

*I could see it in all their eyes. Scorn.*

*I will always remember how none of them tried to stop me…*

Wow. This was… raw. Intense. I was both repulsed and unable to tear myself from the pages filled with the author’s self-loathing. Halfway in, I stopped reading. It was so obviously personal. And the further I read, the more I felt as if… eyes were on me?

The hairs on the back of my neck prickled.

That’s when a little scrap of lined paper fell out. The handwriting awkward. Clumsy. The point of the pencil pressed hard on the paper.

It read: *I HATE YOU*

I quickly looked around to see if anyone had noticed, picked up the paper and stuck it back in the book. It seems weird, but I almost felt as if someone had left the diary on purpose and was waiting to see who would pick it up and read it. I put it on the shelf and left, thinking nothing further about it. But that feeling, like someone hovering nearby, persisted.

The next day in class, I was shocked to find the diary nestled in my bag along with my textbooks. In my periphery, I thought I glimpsed a girl in a black dress, but when I glanced up I saw no one. Toward the end of class, when I reached into my pocket for my phone, I felt a rustle. Someone had tucked a note into my pocket and written in chunky strokes: *YOU DESERVE TO DIE*

I lifted my eyes to scan the classroom—a computer lab with a scattering of heads bent to glowing screens. No sign of the girl in black.

I crumpled the note and tossed it away.

Later I took the diary back to the library, intending to stick it right back on the shelf. Curiosity got the better of me on the way, and I read a bit further. It was all kind of… teen drama stuff? Girl meets boy, boy falls for popular girl, girl feels rejected and on top of it all gets bullied and ostracized for being the “weirdo” in her classes, girl summons demon…

Yeah. The last few pages got pretty out there. It seemed to have turned a corner from angsty journal to… whatever this was:

*The grinning version of me in the mirror had pointed teeth and hollows where its eyes should be. I asked if it was here to drag me to Hell. My wicked reflection asked me if that mattered. I thought of all the people who wronged me. The people who saw me drowning and did nothing. And I stared into my own reflection’s hollow eyes and said that I would destroy everyone—the girls who scorned me—the boy who broke my heart—and MOST OF ALL the people with pity in their eyes, who looked at me like I was a sad clown on the sidelines of their own self-important lives…*

*I will give the world one last chance.*

*Until October 5.*

*That’s when I will end… EVERYTHING.*

I checked the calendar.

October 5 was in two weeks.

That meant I had two weeks in which to confront this diary’s author and… convince her not to succumb to her inner demons, I guess?

Or at least not to do anything drastic that might harm herself or others. Since I was still pretty sure she was following me, I wrote a note on a sheet of paper and slipped it between the pages.

*Please don’t hurt anybody and certainly not yourself. How can I help you?*

Then I slid the book back onto the shelf.

\*\*\*

The lecture hall was mostly empty the next morning in class, sunbeams illuminating the dust. Students trickled in, slouched under backpacks and coats. Overhead, the projector whirred. I was distracted, trying to cram the answers for a pop quiz I was sure was coming—and then I felt it again. That sensation of being *watched*. My eyes drifted to my notebook and caught on the uneven scrawl of capital letters: *CUT YOURSELF OUT OF THE WORLD*

I craned my neck to glance at the seats nearest me and over my shoulder behind me. But most of the classroom was empty except for me.

I rubbed at the goosebumps on my arms. Turned and slowly scanned the back row, wondering… was the author of that diary here? Was she angry I’d put it back? What was this?

A test?

A prank?

The notes persisted over the next few days. And every so often, I’d catch a glimpse of a figure just in the corner of my eye. A girl in a black dress. I had so many notes I started keeping them in a Ziploc bag:

*KILL YOURSELF. YOU SUCK. YOU SHOULDN’T BE ALIVE. HOW DARE YOU BREATHE. THE WORLD DOESN’T WANT YOU IN IT. DIE. DIE. DIE. DIE.*

One time, I almost caught her. I was sitting on a bench sipping coffee. It might have been only the wind that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. There came a flicker of motion in my periphery. A waifish girl all in black had her hand on my arm—but I was so startled I lost my balance and tumbled backward off the bench. When I got to my feet, she was already gone.

Recently, the threats escalated from notes to, well… attempted murder?

I don’t know how to classify it. What I do know is that when I took a sip from my thermos I immediately spat it out. It tasted like—well, I don’t know. It tasted *off.* Something had been mixed in with it, and I’m pretty sure it was some kind of chemical.

It seemed too obvious to be a real attempt to harm me. More of a… warning? A cry for attention? I dumped it out rather than taking it to the campus police.

I was fairly certain that if this person stalking me *was* in some sort of crisis, our campus police were the last people who were likely to be effective help for her. I went back to the library and found the diary—still on the shelf where I’d left it—and as I picked it up from the shelf and opened it, ostentatiously reading where anyone could see me, I *felt* it again. The sense of someone hovering near. Watching. As soon as I got that feeling, I deliberately tucked the diary into my bag and said loudly, “I’m here to help. Let me know how.”

Several students and the librarian at the reference desk looked up at me, and I blushed, but I just ignored them and walked out, taking the book with me.

I received an answer in the dead of night.

The campus neighborhood I live in is usually pretty safe, and sometimes I crack my windows at night.

I woke up out of a deep sleep with the feel of cold steel at my throat. For several seconds I lay tangled under my sheets, heart hammering, unable to open my eyes. I have night terrors sometimes where I can’t move. That was happening now. It was several seconds before I was finally able to sit up.

Something heavy and metallic clattered to the floor, and a breeze wafted from the open window. Looking on my floor, I saw a knife. And on the top page of the notebook that lay on my nightstand was a fresh warning:

*THE ONLY SALVATION—*

*—IS DEATH*

\*\*\*

The campus police told me to lock my windows and my door at night and took my description of the waifish goth girl. They also asked about the diary, but I lied that I didn’t have it with me. I felt certain if I handed it over I’d never see it again, and would lose my last chance to… I dunno, help its writer?

I didn’t want to think of her as a “sad clown on the sidelines” of my life. I wanted to extend a hand, or… something. To do more than everyone else who’d let her down, even if that put myself at risk.

Maybe my savior mentality was why she targeted me. I’ve been thinking about how she left her diary on the bookshelf for anyone to pick up. And I suspect, based on her ravings about how ugly the world is, that she planted her diary in a public place so that it would be read. She wanted someone to lash out at, someone who violated her privacy by reading her journal. But also—pouring chemicals into my thermos, breaking into my apartment—these struck me more as cries for attention than as serious attempts to hurt me.

Like, *Look at me! Look at my pain!*

And I felt more sorry for my stalker than fearful of her, even when the notes escalated in tone:

*CUT YOURSELF. CUT YOURSELF FROM THE WORLD. SOON. SOON.*

And hysterical warnings about the deadline:

*OCTOBER 5 IS THE END*

*ELEVEN DAYS*

*TEN DAYS*

I just didn’t have faith the campus police would handle any of this sensitively. So with ten days left, I took the journal back to the library and asked the woman at the reference desk if she’d seen anybody tuck this onto the bookshelves or had any idea who it might belong to. I showed her the notes and explained that I was being threatened and needed to find out by whom.

The librarian took one look at the notes and said, “The person who wrote this diary and the person who wrote the notes are probably not the same person.”

“Uh…” I frowned. “Why do you say that?”

“The handwriting is different.”

She was right, and I felt such a fool for not noticing sooner. The diary was in ball-point pen. But the notes were in gel pen, sharpie, on all different kinds of paper… and written in wobbly block capitals.

“… Ok. But I still need to know who she is,” I said. “I’m running out of time before she… Well, she doesn’t say it explicitly, but I think October 5 she’s going to kill herself.”

I opened the diary to some of the last pages, where it was less coherent and mostly dark squiggles and gibberish. I showed the librarian some of the lines that read: *I’ll show them how they have hurt me they’ll see the pain spill out of me flowing crimson and it will stain them the stain will spread…*

“… yeah, these are pretty alarming writings.” The librarian flipped through and then squinted at the scribbled-out name on the cover. I’d already held it up to the light and tried to parse it but only the first letters, A and W, were legible. Ana? Anne? “… let me search the campus directory,” she said.

I thanked her and sat down at one of the tables to peruse the notes again, wondering—if the diary author hadn’t written them, who did?

A few moments later the librarian called, “Found her! Her name is Ava Williams.”

“Do you have a way to contact her?” I leapt up.

“No, unfortunately.”

“Why? Is it restricted inform—""

“Because Ava Williams died ten years ago on October 5.”

\*\*\*

*Ten years ago…*

The librarian showed me an obituary. In the image was a solemn girl dressed in a black gown, staring into the camera like she wanted to drag down the entire world.

“But… if she’s dead, why would someone *else* leave this diary for me? And write all these notes?” I wondered.

This wasn’t how I expected all this to end. I figured, of course, that it was possible the diary’s author wrote it a long time ago. October 5 could have been in any year. And the diary itself was… well, it was worn. But I didn’t want it to be true. I’d thought, I’d hoped…

“She didn’t want to kill herself,” I said, more to myself than the librarian. “She wanted someone to care enough to stop her.” This was hitting me hard. I stared at the hollow eyes of the girl in the obituary. Ten years ago, Ava Williams carried out her threats. If I’m being honest, part of the reason I didn’t try harder to look up the name, to find out who she is, was that…

I didn’t want to know. Not if it was this.

“I’m sorry,” the librarian told me as I took the diary back.

I retreated to my table. Looked again at that first page:

*I will always remember how none of them tried to stop me…*

I like to believe I would have tried. That if I’d met Ava then, if I’d been witness to her despair, I’d have tried to pull her out of it. Even at risk of being pulled under.

But there was no saving Ava. And as for the notes—I felt like I was back at square one. I had no clue who was writing them.

I supposed my best guess was someone who shared classes with me, given that’s where they tended to show up the most.

Idly scrolling the class rosters, I shook my head. None of these were people I could imagine wishing death to me. And who was the girl I kept glimpsing out of the corner of my eye, flitting through my periphery? A ghost? But I don’t really believe in ghosts—

Goosebumps blossomed along my arms, and I stiffened at the returning sense of being *watched.*

“Hey,” said the librarian.

I craned my neck, wondering where the feeling of eyes was coming from—

“HEY.”

I glanced up, because the librarian was now looming over me, brow scrunched.

""What?"" I asked.

""What are you writing?""

Surprised, I glanced at my hand. I was holding a pen. Pressed hard into the paper under the tip were words in block capitals. I stared—just stared, and the first thought that popped into my head was, *Did the librarian do it?* But no, it was *my* hand holding the pen. And yet, I had no memory of writing these words. None at all. But there they were:

*CUT YOURSELF OUT OF THE WO* — the rest of the last word, the ""O"" was partially drawn, my pen mid-circle.

Apparently, *I've* been writing the notes to myself.

\*\*\*

The librarian was staring at me like I was some sort of lunatic, but I didn’t even pay attention to her as I dumped out all my books and notebooks. I flipped through pages in a ferocious flurry until I found a textbook with the margin torn off the table of contents. I pawed through the ziploc of notes until I found one written on a torn scrap of a contents page. I held it to the textbook margin's tear.

It fit perfectly.

*All* the notes were ones that had been written on things near at hand to me, with whatever implement happened to be in reach at the time. And now that I was realizing where each note had been written, I found that I *remembered.* But it was all so hazy... like when you can't find your keys only to discover them in your pocket—or worse, in your hand, where you've been carrying them but have forgotten you're holding them. It was like that.

“Is this some kind of joke?” asked the librarian.

I didn’t stay to explain—just packed everything up. Fled because now that I’d caught my hand in the act, now that the memories were starting to come loose, I realized… realized that it must have been my own hand that slipped the diary into my bag. My own hand that snatched a kitchen knife before I went to bed, and held it to my throat while I was sleeping. And my own hand, too, that poured turpentine into my thermos while I was doing some art.

How do I tell police that I poured turpentine into my own thermos and held a knife to my own throat?

\*\*\*

I’ve read her diary cover to cover, and it makes me sadder every time. I wanted to try to save her. I wanted her to know that *someone* cared enough to try to save her. But I also can’t allow her to harm anyone else.

Who knows how many she’s taken in the years before I found her journal.

I can *see* her now. Ava, I mean. I see her at my periphery in that black gown. I get those goosebumps all up my arms when she takes my hand. The notes are in capital letters because capitals are easier to write with someone else’s hand—she’s been writing the notes *through* me, guiding my hand across the page. She doesn’t even hide from me anymore.

But no one else can see her.

I’ve burned the diary. Destroyed it so no one else will ever read it.

But she already has a grip on me. She hasn’t let go of my wrist since I burned the book. And I know I can’t save myself because I know what she will make this hand of mine do.

I’ve begged. I’ve pleaded. But no matter what I write, she replies *IT WAS TOO LATE FOR ME. ITS TOO LATE FOR YOU*

*YOU SAW ME DROWNING*

*YOU KEPT READING*

*OCT 5*

*OCT 5*

Something heavy and metallic clattered to the floor, and a breeze wafted from the open window. Looking on my floor, I saw a knife. And on the top page of the notebook that lay on my nightstand was a fresh warning:

*THE ONLY SALVATION—*

*—IS DEATH*

\*\*\*

The campus police told me to lock my windows and my door at night and took my description of the waifish goth girl. They also asked about the diary, but I lied that I didn’t have it with me. I felt certain if I handed it over I’d never see it again, and would lose my last chance to… I dunno, help its writer?

I didn’t want to think of her as a “sad clown on the sidelines” of my life. I wanted to extend a hand, or… something. To do more than everyone else who’d let her down, even if that put myself at risk.

Maybe my savior mentality was why she targeted me. I’ve been thinking about how she left her diary on the bookshelf for anyone to pick up. And I suspect, based on her ravings about how ugly the world is, that she planted her diary in a public place so that it would be read. She wanted someone to lash out at, someone who violated her privacy by reading her journal. But also—pouring chemicals into my thermos, breaking into my apartment—these struck me more as cries for attention than as serious attempts to hurt me.

Like, *Look at me! Look at my pain!*

And I felt more sorry for my stalker than fearful of her, even when the notes escalated in tone:

*CUT YOURSELF. CUT YOURSELF FROM THE WORLD. SOON. SOON.*

And hysterical warnings about the deadline:

*OCTOBER 5 IS THE END*

*ELEVEN DAYS*

*TEN DAYS*

I just didn’t have faith the campus police would handle any of this sensitively. So with ten days left, I took the journal back to the library and asked the woman at the reference desk if she’d seen anybody tuck this onto the bookshelves or had any idea who it might belong to. I showed her the notes and explained that I was being threatened and needed to find out by whom.

The librarian took one look at the notes and said, “The person who wrote this diary and the person who wrote the notes are probably not the same person.”

“Uh…” I frowned. “Why do you say that?”

“The handwriting is different.”

She was right, and I felt such a fool for not noticing sooner. The diary was in ball-point pen. But the notes were in gel pen, sharpie, on all different kinds of paper… and written in wobbly block capitals.

“… Ok. But I still need to know who she is,” I said. “I’m running out of time before she… Well, she doesn’t say it explicitly, but I think October 5 she’s going to kill herself.”

I opened the diary to some of the last pages, where it was less coherent and mostly dark squiggles and gibberish. I showed the librarian some of the lines that read: *I’ll show them how they have hurt me they’ll see the pain spill out of me flowing crimson and it will stain them the stain will spread…*

“… yeah, these are pretty alarming writings.” The librarian flipped through and then squinted at the scribbled-out name on the cover. I’d already held it up to the light and tried to parse it but only the first letters, A and W, were legible. Ana? Anne? “… let me search the campus directory,” she said.

I thanked her and sat down at one of the tables to peruse the notes again, wondering—if the diary author hadn’t written them, who did?

A few moments later the librarian called, “Found her! Her name is Ava W.”

“Do you have a way to contact her?” I leapt up.

“No, unfortunately.”

“Why? Is it restricted inform—""

“Because Ava W. died ten years ago on October 5.”

\*\*\*

*Ten years ago…*

The librarian showed me an obituary. In the image was a solemn girl dressed in a black gown, staring into the camera like she wanted to drag down the entire world.

“But… if she’s dead, why would someone *else* leave this diary for me? And write all these notes?” I wondered.

This wasn’t how I expected all this to end. I figured, of course, that it was possible the diary’s author wrote it a long time ago. October 5 could have been in any year. And the diary itself was… well, it was worn. But I didn’t want it to be true. I’d thought, I’d hoped…

“She didn’t want to kill herself,” I said, more to myself than the librarian. “She wanted someone to care enough to stop her.” This was hitting me hard. I stared at the hollow eyes of the girl in the obituary. Ten years ago, Ava W. carried out her threats. If I’m being honest, part of the reason I didn’t try harder to look up the name, to find out who she is, was that…

I didn’t want to know. Not if it was this.

“I’m sorry,” the librarian told me as I took the diary back.

I retreated to my table. Looked again at that first page:

*I will always remember how none of them tried to stop me…*

I like to believe I would have tried. That if I’d met Ava then, if I’d been witness to her despair, I’d have tried to pull her out of it. Even at risk of being pulled under.

But there was no saving Ava. And as for the notes—I felt like I was back at square one. I had no clue who was writing them.

I supposed my best guess was someone who shared classes with me, given that’s where they tended to show up the most.

Idly scrolling the class rosters, I shook my head. None of these were people I could imagine wishing death to me. And who was the girl I kept glimpsing out of the corner of my eye, flitting through my periphery? A ghost? But I don’t really believe in ghosts—

Goosebumps blossomed along my arms, and I stiffened at the returning sense of being *watched.*

“Hey,” said the librarian.

I craned my neck, wondering where the feeling of eyes was coming from—

“HEY.”

I glanced up, because the librarian was now looming over me, brow scrunched.

""What?"" I asked.

""What are you writing?""

Surprised, I glanced at my hand. I was holding a pen. Pressed hard into the paper under the tip were words in block capitals. I stared—just stared, and the first thought that popped into my head was, *Did the librarian do it?* But no, it was *my* hand holding the pen. And yet, I had no memory of writing these words. None at all. But there they were:

*CUT YOURSELF OUT OF THE WO* — the rest of the last word, the ""O"" was partially drawn, my pen mid-circle.

Apparently, *I've* been writing the notes to myself.

\*\*\*

The librarian was staring at me like I was some sort of lunatic, but I didn’t even pay attention to her as I dumped out all my books and notebooks. I flipped through pages in a ferocious flurry until I found a textbook with the margin torn off the table of contents. I pawed through the ziploc of notes until I found one written on a torn scrap of a contents page. I held it to the textbook margin's tear.

It fit perfectly.

*All* the notes were ones that had been written on things near at hand to me, with whatever implement happened to be in reach at the time. And now that I was realizing where each note had been written, I found that I *remembered.* But it was all so hazy... like when you can't find your keys only to discover them in your pocket—or worse, in your hand, where you've been carrying them but have forgotten you're holding them. It was like that.

“Is this some kind of joke?” asked the librarian.

I didn’t stay to explain—just packed everything up. Fled because now that I’d caught my hand in the act, now that the memories were starting to come loose, I realized… realized that it must have been my own hand that slipped the diary into my bag. My own hand that snatched a kitchen knife before I went to bed, and held it to my throat while I was sleeping. And my own hand, too, that poured turpentine into my thermos while I was doing some art.

How do I tell police that I poured turpentine into my own thermos and held a knife to my own throat?

\*\*\*

I’ve read her diary cover to cover, and it makes me sadder every time. I wanted to try to save her. I wanted her to know that *someone* cared enough to try to save her. But I also can’t allow her to harm anyone else.

Who knows how many she’s taken in the years before I found her journal.

I can *see* her now. Ava, I mean. I see her at my periphery in that black gown. I get those goosebumps all up my arms when she takes my hand. The notes are in capital letters because capitals are easier to write with someone else’s hand—she’s been writing the notes *through* me, guiding my hand across the page. She doesn’t even hide from me anymore.

But no one else can see her.

I’ve burned the diary. Destroyed it so no one else will ever read it.

But she already has a grip on me. She hasn’t let go of my wrist since I burned the book. And I know I can’t save myself because I know what she will make this hand of mine do.

I’ve begged. I’ve pleaded. But no matter what I write, she replies *IT WAS TOO LATE FOR ME. ITS TOO LATE FOR YOU*

*YOU SAW ME DROWNING*

*YOU KEPT READING*

I am 37M, drinking espresso-based coffee since I was 13 and regular coffee since I was 9

I worked in the coffee industry for 16 years. I don't know how to make special shapes on coffee.

I didn't spend too much time on it because in the end, the taste is what matters.

It's rare that there was a complaint about the coffee I made.

My mindset is that what I give is what I should get.

For example: if I want to receive good service, I have to do the same.

Mostly, I give good service, but there are those who are more difficult and no matter how nice you are, you can't please them.

Until two years ago, I would drink my coffee with milk, 1 shot of short espresso or 2 depending on the size of the cup and the strength of the coffee in that cafe, and the simplest foamed milk.

Since I've been drinking coffee for many years and worked in the coffee industry for quite a few years, I know what I like. Two years ago, I stopped drinking milk because it made me pass a lot of gas.

I didn't test whether I was sensitive to lactose or protein. of the milk (my ex was sensitive to milk protein) I did an experiment and there were no stomach problems so I stayed like that I changed my coffee machine at home to one that doesn't have a foamed because it's irrelevant

I will also mention that I tried substitutes and they weren't tasty to me so without anything or the name of the coffee ""Americano""

Here is the topic of the instructions on how to make my coffee and they are really simple

1 shot of short espresso and hot water up to 3/4 for small and large the same thing with only 2 shots of espresso very simple

But in cafes in my country they teach them to make an ""Americano"" which is made up of 1 shot of long espresso which is another addition of hot water with burnt coffee and hot water almost to the end of the cup

And it's disgusting!!!

The baristas always look at me like, ""Who are you to tell me how to make coffee?""

I'm a 36M who recently started taking salsa classes from scratch. It's been an amazing confidence booster.

There's a woman in the class (she is in her early 40s) who was one of the first partners kind enough to dance with me when I was a beginner. We'd chat, she'd ask personal questions (if I live alone, what I do weekends, etc.), and I developed a bit of a crush. The mixed signals had me in the ""is she/isn't she"" loop.

Last week, after a social event, I finally shot my shot and asked her out for coffee. Her response was the classic gentle let-down: she said ""how sweet"" (""tan tierno"" in Spanish, which is a soft no here), said she didn't have time, but maybe a tequila another day (vague future).

**Logically, I get it.** I'm not pursuing it further; I respect her answer and won't make it weird in class. I wasn't in love, but the attachment to the *idea* of her still stings a bit. It's more about the bruised ego and the ""what if"" fading away.

For the guys who've been there: **What's your best mental reset button?** How do you flip the switch from dwelling on the ""no"" back to focusing on your own mission? Any practical steps you take to shake off that feeling?

1ns1yp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ns1yp5/2_weeks_without_caffeine_my_experience/,2 Weeks Without Caffeine — My Experience,"I’ve been drinking coffee daily since 8th grade. In my family/culture, it’s just part of life — start the day with a mocha pot, keep sipping throughout the day. In high school and college it never really bothered me. My sleep was irregular anyway, so I didn’t think about how caffeine was affecting me.

Fast forward \~2 years after graduating college, working full-time, and I started to notice some downsides.

I had cut down to half a mocha pot every morning (probably \~200–300mg caffeine) and nothing else. At first it gave me that nice jolt, but over time it just stopped doing much. Instead of a high, it just brought me to “baseline.” From 9am–3pm I felt somewhat normal, but after that I’d slowly crash. **By 6pm, I’d get brutal brain fog, headaches, and irritability.** At the time, I didn’t even connect it to caffeine withdrawals — I thought I was just getting older or something.

The day before I quit, I forgot to prep my mocha and grabbed a Celsius (first energy drink in years). Same exact pattern: normal until afternoon, then the crash. The next day I forgot to prep my mocha again and didn't have a celsius and I just said to myself, let me just quit.

That was 2 weeks ago.

**Withdrawals?** Honestly not too bad. A low-grade headache for 2–3 days, but **nothing compared to the nightly crash headaches I used to get.**

**Benefits I noticed almost immediately:**

* No more 7pm brain fog or headaches.
* Energy feels natural again — from food, exercise, conversations, not just a chemical hit.
* I feel like my younger self — less anxious, more relaxed, better socially.
* Sleep is way better. Wild dreams, but overall solid rest. When I wake up early, I feel a *natural* tiredness I can handle. 
* I don’t crash in the evenings anymore, so I actually stay up later and feel more social. **(Wild that quitting coffee made me more social at night.)**
* Nice not having to prep coffee or plan my day around caffeine.

**Cons so far:**

* Less of that “locked in” focus at work, especially in the mornings.
* Workouts are tougher without that caffeine boost (I’ve been lifting with caffeine since high school, so it’s an adjustment).

But honestly? The pros massively outweigh the cons. I feel happier, more myself, and I don’t want to go back.",1,1758996329.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

This happened three weeks ago and I've been living in my car since. My husband won't answer my calls. His family blocked me. Even my own sister says I got what I deserved.

We'd been married four years. Together for six. My ex and I broke up eight years ago because he cheated with my cousin. Classic story, right? Found them in my apartment when I came home early from work. Kicked him out, never looked back.

My husband knew all this. He helped me heal from it. He was patient when I had trust issues. Never pushed when I needed space. Always there when the memories hit hard.

But here's the thing. My ex started working at my company six months ago. Different department, but same building. At first I avoided him. Then we ended up on the same project team. Had to be professional.

""You look good,"" he said after our first meeting.

""Don't,"" I told him.

""Just being honest. That husband of yours is lucky.""

I should've requested a transfer. Should've told my husband. Should've done a lot of things differently.

Instead, I started having lunch with him. Just catching up, I told myself. He apologized for cheating. Said losing me was his biggest regret. That my cousin meant nothing. That he'd grown up.

""I compare every woman to you,"" he admitted one day. ""Nobody measures up.""

I ate it up like an idiot.

Started lying to my husband about working late. Met my ex for drinks ""to discuss the project."" Saved his number under a female name. All the classic cheater moves I swore I'd never do.

My husband noticed. Of course he did.

""Who keeps texting you at midnight?"" he asked one night.

""Just my coworker about tomorrow's presentation,"" I lied.

He looked hurt but dropped it.

The worst part? Nothing physical happened with my ex. It was all emotional. All ego stroking. All me being a complete fool who liked the attention.

Everything crashed down at his parents' anniversary dinner. Fancy restaurant. His whole family there. My phone kept buzzing. My ex asking if I could sneak away after dinner.

""Can you put your phone away?"" my husband asked quietly. ""This is important to my mom.""

""God, you're so controlling,"" I snapped. ""Always have to be perfect for mommy and daddy.""

His face went red. ""Controlling? I asked you to be present for one dinner.""

""At least my ex never policed my every move,"" I said.

The table went silent. His mother's fork clinked against her plate.

""Your ex?"" His voice was deadly calm. ""The one who's been texting you?""

""No, that's just...""

""Show me your phone then.""

I clutched it tighter. ""This is exactly what I mean. You're suffocating.""

""Show me the phone or we're done.""

His dad tried to intervene. ""Son, maybe we should...""

""No,"" my husband cut him off. ""She brought up her ex. Let's talk about him. Tell everyone how amazing he is.""

""He understood me,"" I exploded. ""He made me feel wanted. Made me feel sexy. You just make me feel like I'm never good enough. Like I'm always failing some test. He knew how to touch me, how to...""

I stopped. But it was too late.

My husband stood up. Pulled out his wallet. Dropped cash on the table.

""Enjoy your ex,"" he said. Then he left.

His mom was crying. His dad glared at me like I was dirt. His sister actually laughed.

""You stupid, stupid girl,"" she said.

I drove home in a panic. His car wasn't there. I called and called. Nothing.

He came by the next day with his brother. Started packing his things. Wouldn't look at me.

""Please, I didn't mean it. I was just angry. Nothing happened with him.""

""I don't care if nothing physical happened,"" he said, still packing. ""You compared me to him. In front of my family. At my parents' anniversary. After everything I did to help you heal from what he did to you.""

""Baby, please...""

""Don't. You want him? Have him. See if he'll hold your hair when you're sick. See if he'll drive three hours to pick you up when your car breaks down. See if he'll love your anxious, insecure self at 3 AM when you're crying about feeling fat.""

""I don't want him. I want you.""

He finally looked at me. ""No. You want the attention. You want the drama. You want the guy who cheated on you because that's exciting. I'm boring, right? I just love you. Just support you. Just build a life with you. How dull.""

He served me with separation papers a week later. Gave me thirty days to move out of the house we bought together. His house, technically. His down payment. His name on the deed. I'd been paying him rent.

I called my ex, desperate for somewhere to stay.

""Yeah, about that,"" he said. ""My girlfriend wouldn't be cool with it. You knew I had a girlfriend, right?""

I hung up. Sat in my car. Laughed until I cried.

My husband was right about everything. Every single thing. He loved the broken mess of me. Helped put me back together. And I burned it all down for a man who was using me for an ego boost. Again.

I'm staying in my car because my sister says I need to feel the consequences. My parents live out of state. Can't afford a hotel long-term. My husband's lawyer sent a message that I could take my clothes and personal items while he's at work.

I went yesterday. The house was exactly as I left it. Our wedding photo still on the mantle. My coffee mug in the sink. Like I'd just vanished from his life.

Found a note on the kitchen counter. His handwriting.

""I would have loved you through anything. Anything but you choosing him over me. I hope you find whatever you're looking for.""

I kept that note. Read it every night in my car. Think about how he used to kiss my forehead when I had nightmares. How he'd surprise me with my favorite takeout after bad days. How he never once threw my past in my face until I threw it in his.

My lawyer says I'll get nothing in the divorce. No alimony. No equity in the house. Nothing from his 401k. We had a prenup I barely read because I trusted him completely.

The sickest part? I still do trust him. He could destroy me in court and he's being more than fair. Taking nothing of mine. Not even asking me to pay back the vacation he'd booked for our anniversary next month. Just wanting me gone.

I drove by our house last night. Saw his car in the driveway. Living room light on. Wanted so badly to knock. To beg. To promise anything.

But what would I say? That I sabotaged our marriage for a man who cheated on me? That I humiliated him in front of his family for someone who was playing me? That I chose trauma over love?

My therapist would have a field day. If I could afford therapy anymore.

His sister texted me once. Just once.

""He cried for three days straight. Then he stopped. That's when I knew you'd really lost him. When he stopped crying and just got quiet.""

I've been living in my car for three weeks. Shower at the gym. Eat dollar menu food. Apply for apartments I can't afford. Think about the king-sized bed we picked out together. The kitchen we renovated. The garden he planted for me.

All gone. For what? For my ex telling me I looked good? For secret texts that meant nothing? For the thrill of being wanted by someone who already proved he didn't actually want me?

I guess my question is: how do you live with yourself when you realize you destroyed the only person who ever really loved you?

While I was studying in the university hallway, a guy sat near me and asked if I had an exam. At first, I didn’t want to answer, but eventually I did. He said he was a student from the neighboring faculty. When I asked him what he was doing here, he seemed a little surprised and said he had taken a course here. Then he talked about the difficulty of his major and confided in me. I stayed calm and listened, and finally I told him good luck, and he left.

That night, when I was sitting on a chair near the exit of the faculty doing my homework, he suddenly came, pushed me, and forced me to walk with him. He asked me about an exam, and I was completely confused. He even brought a friend who stood behind me and cornered me. He got very close to me, and I became anxious and froze. When he asked if I had anything else to do, I said “no” out of confusion, and then he and his friend left. I don’t remember the details of that night because of the anxiety—maybe nothing actually happened. Later, I felt a burning sensation, which might have been due to stress. That same night I had a nightmare where a man with a threatening and scary look grabbed my hand and pulled me toward him. I couldn’t defend myself, and he wanted me. I woke up from the dream and couldn’t sleep until morning. Although I was afraid he might come back and harm me, I also felt attached to him. I cried a lot and was completely confused about my feelings. I sobbed and even lost focus on studying. Later, when I thought about that night, I wondered if he had touched me… I laughed, but the laugh was like crying, like a crazy laugh. After that, I had a severe kidney stone attack, which I don’t know if it was related or just a coincidence.

Two months later, he came back and called me. I told him that he had hurt me. At first, he denied it and then accused me of imagining things due to stress and drug use. I didn’t argue with him anymore. He asked me to sit somewhere and talk, have coffee, or something. I went with him but eventually refused, and he left. He also asked about my grades and many other things.

Crossroads
A Story of Anxious Attachment
By 

Tuesday Evening, September 23rd, 2025
Okay…She said.
Okay…I said.
A hug.
Okay.
I was lost in the moment. For the next thirty seconds, I felt a sudden flash of enlightenment. I didn’t want to let go. 
Ever.
Then the kiss.
Her lips were soft and wet.
It was incredible. Maybe it was getting dark and she felt spooked, but then she said, “Do it again.”
And I did.
We agreed to thirty days of no contact , a reset, and maybe a chance to salvage what remained.
She didn’t completely let me go (not yet). She even suggested plans after the break, if I could make it to the end.
For the first time in months, I felt hope. Safety.
I knew I needed this. We needed this.
This is where the story of my recovery began.

Before the Fork

Nearly four years ago, after moving my family to California, I discovered my then-wife’s infidelity. After twenty years, our marriage was over.
I moved back to Georgia, and for the first time in decades, I was alone.
After sitting with it awhile, I tried dating apps. I’d never done it before. What could it hurt?
To my surprise, I did well. For weeks I was having a blast, feeling like a stud, enjoying the attention.
Then it happened.
I met SC.
At first, it seemed like just another Tinder date. We met at a park, walked, talked, and kissed passionately goodbye. Soon after, we made plans to meet again.
One date became a few. And when intimacy finally happened… It was out of this world. I started catching feelings ; shocked, because I hadn’t been looking for commitment after leaving a twenty-year marriage.
But I started falling in love with this woman. She was everything I’d ever hoped for.
It was bliss.
Until it wasn’t.

When Fear Took Over

My higher brain kept whispering: “This is too good. Too comfortable. Something terrible is about to happen. GET OUT!”
And something terrible was happening. Anxiety began creeping in every day.
I questioned myself. Then I began questioning her.
Her friendships. Her independence. The very fabric of who she was.
Jealousy took root.
I scrutinized her motives, her movements, her whereabouts.
It affected her. I saw it. I felt it. My insecurities were dragging us both down.
I couldn’t control my emotions. I reacted instead of responding. I constantly checked my phone: Where is she? Why hasn’t she answered? What is she doing?
It was debilitating.
And it pushed her further away. The things that once drew her to me were drowned out by my suffocating behavior. She had one foot out the door, and we were both miserable.
It was time to get to work.
And I did.
“Love like this only comes once,” I told myself. “I’m not going to lose her, or I’ll die trying.”
Through therapy, self-help books, and SC’s support, I finally learned I had what’s called an anxious attachment style, triggered by the trauma of my ex-wife’s infidelity.
I had never faced it before. I hadn’t thought I needed to.
But when I fell in love with SC, it came out with vengeance. I started drinking too much, sleeping too little, eating poorly, firing off messages without thought.
I became my own worst enemy. And as I spiraled, SC developed her own avoidant attachment, shutting down in response.
I was losing the most beautiful woman of my life.
And I was broken.

Chapter One: The Fork in the Road

It was cloudy but calm when we started the journey. Ahead of us stretched a road, and at its end was a fork.
One direction led toward mountains, lush green forests, rushing rivers, and freedom from chaos.
The other was lonely, dark, and cold. It ended after only a short distance, swallowed in emptiness and despair.
We both knew which way she needed to go. Toward beauty. Toward openness and peace. That was who SC was — and she had to return to it.
She paused, then slowly began moving in her direction. Ten steps in, she stopped, looked back, and said:
“You got this.”
Then she faded, as if lifted away like an angel finally finding her rest.
I panicked. I called her name.
“SC!” I shouted.
But it was too late.
She was gone.
For a moment, I thought about chasing her. Maybe if I ran fast enough, I could catch her, make things safe again.
But then I stopped.
I cried.
And cried.
And cried some more.
What felt like years was only seconds.
And then I realized: SC doesn’t want to be chased anymore.
She needed herself again.
And I knew it was time to take my own path — without her.

Chapter Two: Laying the Foundation

It was my turn.
I hesitated, then began laying down bricks, one by one, toward recovery. Toward a future I couldn’t yet see. A future where I wasn’t sure if our paths would ever cross again.
I hurt deeply. But I knew if I could break this pattern, my chances were far better than before.
And so I moved forward.
Day 1
Coffee


Work


Gym


10-minute nap


Walk the dog


Uber (too much driving, too little money)


Read a self-help book


Try to sleep


Try not to think about SC for as many seconds as possible


Day 5 of sobriety


Day 2
Coffee


Open morning — find social activities


Grocery shopping


Run


Work


Journal texts I wanted to send but wouldn’t


Try not to think about SC


Sleep




By the end of Day Two, I was already exhausted.
The messages had stopped.
No plans to hang out.
No cute selfies.
Her pictures reminded me every day of just how astonishing a person can be,  on the outside, and even more so within. She’s the complete package.
The comfort of her presence made me feel secure, like I could conquer the world with her by my side.
But she wasn’t.
Not now.
She’s gone, and I feel like an addict going through detox.
I keep hoping I’ll be that guy again — sitting next to her outside the camper, by the fire, holding hands, drinking cold beer.
I never imagined the emptiness would be this hard.
And through it all, one truth keeps me moving forward:
I still love her — and I believe that love can carry us back to each other.
I can’t help but repeating the same line again and again : I’m so sorry SC for not fulfilling your last dance. I wanted the honor. 

Day 3
Coffee 
Walk the dog
Figure out how pass my time this evening. Weekends seem to be dreadful at this time. 
Run
Gym
Journal more texts that wouldn’t be sent 
Cry
Stay busy

I've asked various people, and no one else can hear it.  It's not tinnitus, I have that, too, both high and occasionally low pitched.  The hum is definitely outside of me.

I've lived in a few places over the past decade, and have heard it to various extents in each place.

Oakland, CA - in a flat part of the city, about half a mile from highway and a mile from train tracks.  This is where I first heard the hum.  It wasn't too bad.  Mostly at night in my bedroom.  I thought maybe it was part of some industrial process.

Captain Cook, HI - on the side of a volcano, not much industrial activity in this area, mostly coffee farm lands.  I'd hear it often, including outside.  Certain parts of the house were better than others.

Oakland, CA - in the hills, kind of tucked away.  I'd rarely hear it here.  So peaceful!

Fairfield County, CT - In a semi rural area, but close to train tracks and a train station.  I hear it all the freaking time, but only inside the house.  It's driving me batty.  

I can't find the thread between these places, and why it's louder in some places than others.

I wish I couldn't hear it at all.

This friend messaged me nung September 23, na namimiss na daw niya kami, naiistress daw siya. From that point, I know she needs to at least vent out or grab some air outside, so ako, as a friend and a listener, willing ako makinig sa kanya, tinanong ko siya kung want niya magcoffee kami this weekend, I offered the place and time, nag-sige naman siya. That moment, I knew we agreed na magh-hangout kami sa weekend, together with other friend namin na inaya ko (nag-agree rin naman siya).

Nitong friday, bigla siyang nagchat na wala daw siya masyadong pera pa dahil wala pa siya sahod. Sabi ko naman, sige, ayos lang, kahit magdala na lang siya ng pamasahe niya, ako na sasagot sa kanya sa coffee since ako rin naman ang nag-offer ng place at ng time, nag-sige siya.

Kung kelan naman na bukas na yung usapan namin, bigla siyang nagtext sakin na birthday daw ng relative niya (which is nalimutan niya daw) at hindi siya makakapunta. Dun ako nainis, like, bakit kung kelang bukas na, saka magb-back out? Ayaw na ayaw ko talagang may taong biglang nagc-cancel ng trip, regardless kung ako or siya yung nag-aya. Nagsige kasi siya nung una, walang reklamo or kahit ano, or any hindrances na pwede mapagdaanan namin that day.

Wala naman akong problema sa reason na birthday ng relative niya, ang hindi ko lang talaga nagustuhan ay yung sakit niya na laging last minute nagb-backout sa mga plano. Lagi kasi siyang ganon. If may get together kaming magkakaibigan, siya madalas ang unang nag-aaya or pumapayag like ""yes, sige punta tayo"" with halong excitement pa, majority naman sa amin, kapag may mga ganong plano, g naman agad, nailalatag agad, pero mga few days or kahit the day before the mismong plan, siya ang pinaka-unang ""sorry, hindi ako makakapunta/makakasama kasi ganito ganyan."" Most of her reasons ay magbabantay daw siya sa kapatid or grandparents niya, wala daw maiiwan sa bahay, wala daw siya pera, madalas ganoon (ps. hindi siya breadwinner).

Wala namang kaso yung reasons niya pero yung attitude na siya talaga unang nagb-backout sa mga plans na madalas, she offered it or agreed with it, yun yung naiinis ako. Ang bilis niya madala sa excitement at first without thinking her future plans if free ba talaga siya or not, pero at the end of the day, hindi pala kakayanin sa part niya. Nakakasawa rin siya minsan ayain pag ako yung may gustong ilatag na plano na gusto ko siyang isama. Na-callout siya ng isa naming friend about it, na siya lagi unang umaayaw sa mga plano. Nakaka-disappoint lang rin kasi.

Gets ko rin naman na we have our own time, ako rin naman, I tend to cancel some plans din pero at first, I do check talaga if may prior commitments ako sa mga tatamaang date kapag may pinaplanong gala or hangout with friends, and I would just say ""hmm teka hindi ko pa sure eh if pwede ako nan, balitaan kita siguro soon."" Kahit gustong gusto ko yung plans offered but if hindi siya magiging manageable sakin due to some reasons, uunahan ko na agad ng decline, unless keri na talaga then magsasabi ako ahead of time.

Ayun lang, nakakainis lang na okay, I can do things alone naman without her, or maybe a few hangouts naman with some other friends if hindi siya available pero it is somehow disappointing, like over the time eh, yung ganong last minute nagb-backout.",3,1758995666.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

1ns1o2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/HybridAnimalsGame/comments/1ns1o2q/chapter_12_road_to_the_windy_mountains/,Chapter 12 – Road to the Windy Mountains,"After the brutal battle with the Dreadnest Spider and the strategic victory at the Frostbite Camp, Tyler finally handed over the newly acquired metal sword and dyed armour to Milo.

“Here,” he muttered, tossing the equipment to his brother. “Better you use these than carry dead weight.”

“Thanks,” Milo said, equipping the gear. His defence stats instantly rose, offering him better survivability.

From there, they pressed on, taking down three additional bandit factions in swift succession—Blackmire Bandits, Timber Bandits, and Everthorn Bandits. Though each camp had slightly stronger foes than the last, none of them posed any real threat to the now well-coordinated duo.

Tyler, always at the front, used his \[Spider Web\] and \[Rage\] combination to quickly annihilate clusters of enemies. Milo followed up with timely \[Freeze Core\] and sword strikes, though it was clear he still played more of a support role.

\[Level Up! Tyler Level 32 → Level 42\]

\[Level Up! Milo Level 19 → Level 24\]

Though both levelled rapidly, Milo frowned.

“You’re still hogging the XP. I’m doing more fighting now, but most of these guys fall before I even get a decent hit.”

“Maybe get stronger, then,” Tyler replied with a shrug. Milo sighed. He couldn’t deny the truth — his skills were more defensive, and that just didn’t grant experience as fast as raw offense.

Despite the imbalance, they’d racked up considerable loot: several metal swords and sets of armour. Though not worth much individually, the sheer quantity made them confident they’d turn a decent profit.

They teleported back to Shindo and presented the three camp flags.

King Wing leaned forward with a grin. “Three more? I’m impressed. Shindo has never seen an exterminator as effective as you.”

He signalled to Nelly, who guided them once more into the treasury chamber.

The Royal Guard gave Tyler a long stare as they passed — stern, almost judgmental, as if questioning Tyler’s motives. Tyler, used to disdain, smirked slightly and moved along.

Inside the treasury, Tyler and Milo grabbed three 500-gold pouches, a set of higher-grade recovery potions, and a new item — 12 glowing, red shards.

\[Acquired Item: Greater Recovery Potion x5\]

\[Description: Restores 60% of total HP.\]

\[Acquired Item: Magma Shard x12\]

\[Description: A sturdy mineral imbued with fire-elemental energy. Often used to forge heat-resistant gear.\]

Satisfied, they teleported to Noobia.

Pineapple Pig stood behind his usual stall, chewing loudly on something unidentifiable.

“We’ve got a haul for you,” Milo said. “Four sets of metal gear. That should get us 1,000 gold easy.”

Pineapple Pig glanced lazily at the pile and snorted. “500.”

“500? Are you kidding?! You sold them to us for 250 each!”

“That’s selling. This is buying. Welcome to business, kid. Next.”

Grumbling, Milo handed over the gear. Tyler didn’t care; gold was gold.

“Let’s just get what we need and move on,” Tyler said.

At Shooba’s tent, they purchased two specific items:

\[Acquired Item: Coffee Beans x10\]

\[Description: Can be brewed into a warm beverage. Increases alertness. Perfect for cold mornings.\]

\[Acquired Item: Cauldron x1\]

\[Description: A container used to brew drinks and potions. Essential for field crafting.\]

They gathered their packs, Milo packing a tent and some spare rugs they’d crafted from leftover materials.

“Everything set?” Tyler asked.

“Yup. Looks like we’re going camping.”

The journey toward the Windy Mountains was quiet at first. The air grew colder, the wind sharper. The terrain shifted from grassy plains to icy cliffs. Then, they heard it.

A sharp cry pierced the sky — a screeching call of dominance.

WHOOSH.

The flapping of wings followed.

Above them, perched on a rocky outcrop, was a massive eagle. Its feathers shimmered gold and white in the sunlight, and its eyes gleamed with territorial rage.

\[Enemy Identified: Brooding Eagle Mother\]

\[Level 52\] \[HP: 385/385\]

The Eagle screeched and launched into the sky. In seconds, it swooped down at blinding speed.

Tyler barely raised his sword before the talons slashed across his chest.

\[Tyler HP: 225 → 190\]

The eagle rose again before he could strike back.

“This is going to be fun,” Tyler muttered.

Milo tried aiming his \[Freeze Core\], but the eagle’s speed made it impossible. “It’s too fast!”

Every pass took another chunk of HP.

\[Tyler HP: 190 → 165\]

\[Milo HP: 210 → 190\]

“I can’t keep this up,” Milo said, panting.

Tyler narrowed his eyes. “It’s following a pattern.”

He watched the eagle’s arc — soaring, pausing, diving. “I’ve got an idea. Be bait.”

“Excuse me?”

But Tyler had already dashed into the bushes.

Milo sighed and stepped forward. “Fine. Make it quick.”

The eagle swooped.

\[Activated Skill: Absolute Defence\]

\[Milo HP: 190 → 160\]

The hit was absorbed mostly, but not entirely. As the eagle pulled up, Tyler launched \[Spider Web\].

The web struck. The eagle faltered, its limbs bound.

\[Activated Skill: Sprint\]

Tyler rushed in and unleashed a flurry of sword strikes.

\[HP: 385 → 360 → 335 → 310 → 285\]

The eagle shrieked and kicked violently, landing one hit.

\[Tyler HP: 165 → 140\]

But the \[Spider Web\] slowed it just enough.

The eagle finally broke free and soared away.

Back in the bushes, Milo whispered, “That was a quarter of its HP. If we do this two more times—”

“We win,” Tyler finished.

They waited for PE to recover.

Then, repeat.

\[Activated Skill: Freeze Core\]

\[Eagle HP: 285 → 235 → 185 → 135\]

One more cycle.

\[Activated Skill: Rage\]

The eagle dove again.

\[Activated Skill: Absolute Defence\]

\[Activated Skill: Freeze Core\]

Tyler leapt from the shadows, sword blazing red.

SLASH. SLASH. SLASH.

\[Eagle HP: 135 → 65 → 0\]

The majestic creature screeched one final time before vanishing into golden particles.

\[+90 XP Gained\]

\[Level Up! Tyler Level 42 → 44\]

\[Achievement Unlocked: Brood No More\]

\[Grade: A\]

\[Condition: Defeat the Brooding Eagle Mother, master of the skies and sentinel of the Windy Mountains.\]

They collapsed into the snow, breathing heavily.

“Let’s hope that was the welcoming committee,” Milo muttered.

Tyler smirked. “Then let’s knock on more doors.”

1ns1o2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ns1o2b/unpredictable_increased_heart_rate_on_stimulants/,Unpredictable increased heart rate on stimulants.,"I'm currently on Adderall XR 30mg but I've also tried nearly every other stimulant in that class of drugs and had similar results. And I can't figure out why some days the Adderall has a minor effect on my heart rate and other days my heart races for seemingly no reason. I have a boring job (which I like) that is low stress and doesn't change from day to day so there is no reason for my heart to race some days and not others. And the weirdest thing is that it seems to often be the worst on the weekends. Many weekend mornings, I'll be sitting on the couch feeling relaxed with nothing worrying my mind and my heart will start racing as my medicine kicks in. It feels like the medicine often makes me more anxious on the weekends than on work days. I don't have higher blood pressure or any other negative side effects and I don't want to stop taking stimulants as nothing else has ever helped me as much as they do. Does anyone have advice for dealing with elevated heart rate? Or an explanation for why it seems to randomly be a problem on some days but not others?

Other relevant info: I've always been sensitive to caffeine so I pay close attention to my caffeine intake. I consume probably 60 mg or less caffeine in the mornings and rarely consume any more after that. And I'll have less on days when my heart is racing. This morning, I had about 3 small sips of coffee before my heart started racing and I stopped drinking it.  Also, it's just me and my husband in our house.  Also, I live in a quiet, low stress household so there is no discernible reason that my anxiety should be worse on the weekends when I'm at home.",1,1758995629.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

1ns1m73,https://i.redd.it/as7qufoqwqrf1.jpeg,My Travel Pour Over Setup,"I travel a lot for work and used to enjoy finding coffee shops on the road. I recently decided I really like the way the coffee I brew at home tastes and wanted to take it on the road. So I bought a collapsible silicone pour over device, an electric kettle, and the 1Zpresso Q Air grinder (I really like the J-Ultra for espresso, so I stayed brand loyal). 

I take the Melitta paper filters for convenience on the road; I use reusable cotton filters at home.

I brew at a 15:1 ratio with my pour over, so I figured out how much water I could fit into the electric kettle (360g), then reverse calculated how much ground coffee (24g) to put into the filter. I do have to split up the grinding process into two steps, since max capacity of the Q Air is 20g; it’s not a big deal, since I’m waiting on the electric kettle to heat up. 

I just use my phone as a timer and don’t bother weighing out the water as I pour, since that’s consistent to the max fill line in the kettle. 
This has been working great, even better once I got the grinder for going on the road (previously I had used preground coffee as proof of concept) and the beans from a local roaster I like (dark roast, no light or medium roasts for me). 

On this latest trip (first one using the grinder and whole beans) I tried the 2.0 turns from zero point in the grinder but it brewed a bit too quickly; the second brew I went finer at 1.8 turns and this turned out great with a wonderful flavor! ",5,1758995508.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

Lately, I’ve been carrying a lot of emotions about what’s happening in Palestine. It’s been hard seeing so much pain and injustice and then going back to everyday life like nothing is happening. I often feel like I need someone to talk to who truly understands these feelings, people who care deeply, who feel the same way, and who aren’t afraid to stand by what’s right.

I would love to connect with others in Dubai, Arabs or non-Arabs, who are pro-Palestine. Whether it’s through community initiatives, gatherings, or even just sitting down for coffee and sharing thoughts. I think it would really help to be around people who can relate on this level.

Does anyone know of groups, gatherings, or even just safe spaces where people meet and share these feelings?

My goal is just to be able to enjoy a cup of coffee a few times a week without getting dependent, but I've hit a snag and would like your input. Let me tell you about my journey with caffeine so you can best understand my situation:

Ages 15-20: I had usually just one cup of coffee (8-10oz) every day and got myself dependent, then at 19 cut back over the course of a week and broke my dependency. A week later, I began drinking in moderation without becoming dependent again.

Ages 21-22: I started drinking 8 ounces a day again to help with the tension headaches I'd get (and still get) from sleeping in bad positions but quit again after about ten months. I became dependent again a for a few months after this but quit by slowly tapering myself off.

23-present: This January, I lacked self control and got myself dependent and, this summer, cut back over the course of a few weeks. About two weeks later, I had a cup of coffee, and the next day realized I was experiencing withdrawal symptoms. After caving and having a cup here and there across the next few weeks, I resolved that I was going to go over a month without any caffeine to try to reset my dependency. Unfortunately, not even this worked; after that time period I had a pretty weak cup of coffee and still ended up with withdrawal symptoms the next day.

No inventory, no ads, no high tech website needed. Just pure middleman hustle.  

Here’s the dumb simple way it works:  

### **Step 1: Find Struggling Creators**  
I hunt down people selling eBooks, Canva templates, or PDF guides on Gumroad/Payhip. Most have like 2 sales total. I DM them: *""Hey can I resell your product? You keep 100% of what I pay you""*  

Shockingly, about 70% say yes because they’re desperate for any sales.  

### **Step 2: List Everywhere (Except Where They Already Are)**  
I throw their stuff on:  
- eBay (weirdly works for printables), your own site
- Etsy (under ""digital download"" categories nobody checks)  
- Random niche marketplaces like Creative Market or even Fiverr  

### **Step 3: Profit (Like $8 at a Time)**  
When someone buys from me:  
1. I buy the product from original creator at their price  
2. Download the file  
3. Email it to my buyer with some bs ""thank you for your purchase!"" note  

Margins are tiny ($5-$15 per sale) but it ADDS UP. Last month cleared $387 doing maybe 2 hours/week.  

### **Why This Works**  
- Creators don’t care because they get paid either way  
- Buyers don’t know/care they’re buying from a reseller  
- Platforms don’t police this unless you’re dumb about it  

**Pro Tip:** Focus on ultra-specific niches (think ""Bridal Hair Styling Guides"" not generic ""Instagram Templates""). Less competition, weirder buyers who don’t price compare.  

Not gonna lie—it’s not life-changing money. But for zero risk and almost no time? I’ll take free coffee money.  

Anyone else doing weird little side hustles like this? Or am I the only one exploiting the digital resale loophole? 😅

1ns1hmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/LordofTheMysteriesRP/comments/1ns1hmn/varnheim_side_mission_1_selfreflection/,Varnheim Side Mission 1: Self-Reflection,"“Oliver!” called out Mr. Sal in a rough manner. “Someone’s here to speak with you. Don’t dally, they look important!”
Oliver popped out from one of the rooms of the Sleepy Maiden, dust-covered and curious. *Someone important was asking for him? Could they have figured out that he somehow came from a different world?*
“Yes, sir,” he replied. “Be right there!”
Oliver brushed off as much of the dust on him that he could and prepared himself to flee as he entered the room indicated by Mr. Sals.
Inside the room sat a young gentleman wearing a three-piece suit at a small table with another chair seated across from it. The man had a head of light blonde hair, was clean shaven and wore a smirk as he gazed at a silver pocketwatch in his grip. Oliver immediately had a bad impression of this man. He seemed pompous and arrogant.
“Ah, you’ve made it, Mr. Beckett,” the mysterious man said, glancing up at Oliver from his pocket watch. “Please, take a seat. My name is Mr. Simmons. I’m here to speak for Mr. Veris.”
Oliver had begun to reach for the back of the chair to sit down, but immediately froze upon hearing the name ‘Veris.’ His legs were primed, ready to fire off and leave this scumbag in the dust at a moment’s notice.
“Oh, don’t worry,” chided Mr. Simmons, reaching into his suit to put away his pocket watch. “I’m not here to do anything to you... this time... Go on, sit. I’ll wait for you.”
*This guy talks too much.* Gritting his teeth, Oliver pulled back the chair and sat down in it.
“What does Veris want with me?” he asked accusatorily.
At this question, Mr. Simmons smiled widely and leaned forward across the table. “Let’s not beat around the bush, shall we? We know that you’re an unregistered beyonder. Assassin pathway, right?”
Oliver’s eyes went wide and his mouth opened in shock at being so precisely called out. He quickly attempted to return to his previous expression of disdain, but the damage was already done.
Mr. Simmons laughed. “By that expression, I can tell that I’ve hit the nail on the head. Thanks for that.” He quickly pulls out a pen and pad of notebook paper and writes something down on it.
“Now then,” he continued. “You know that being an unregistered beyonder is an offense punishable by complete memory wipe, if not death, right?”
In haste, Oliver pushed himself back from the table and scrambled to his feet, ready to burst towards the door. If they were planning to kill him, he was at least going to give them a challenge!
“Wait wait waitwaitwait,” Mr. Simmons called out. “I’m not here to do either of those things to you. That’d be a whole other operation and you running wouldn’t get you anywhere. Sit back down.”
“I think I’ll stand,” Oliver replied, voice strained with tension.
“Suit yourself,” Mr. Simmons shrugged as he pulled a cigarette and lighter out of his pocket and lit it, taking a drag. “You don’t mind if I smoke in here, do you? Thanks.”
In fact, Oliver did care about smoking in this room. Mainly, it was just more to clean, but also, he wasn’t a big fan of the smell. It wasn’t as if he’d never smoked of course, but he always tried to do it outside when there was a nice breeze. However, as much as he didn’t enjoy the smoking, he hated conversing with this guy more, so he tried to keep the conversation moving.
“What do you want from me, if you’re not here to mind-wipe me or kill me?”
The handsome blonde took another drag of his cigarette before answering.
“Well, as it turns out, there are a number of other people like you, who recently appeared with special circumstances, so Veris has generously decided to take a different tact in the matter.”
*People like me?* Oliver thought to himself, surprised. *What does he mean? They’ve figured out I’m from a different world? And there are others like me too? That can’t be right, how would they know?*
Oliver’s heart began to beat quickly and he felt his hands begin to sweat. He was beginning to feel like the walls were closing in around him.
“We just want to make sure people like you aren’t going to end up being threats to the city,” Mr. Simmons continued as he reached into his pocket and pulled out a small little card. He set it on the table and slid it over towards Oliver. “So here’s the deal. We need you to essentially prove your loyalty to Varnheim. You have a couple ways to do this. Number one, join a faction. You’ve got three options there. Law & Order, Gloamharvest Farms and the Thoughtspindle Academy. Each of them will have an entrance trial. You can find information for what you need to do, who you need to contact and where to find them on this card. If you want my honest opinion, you should join the Gloamharvest Farms. They have the next sequences for your Assassin potion. However, if you want to stay separate from the factions in the city, Veris will graciously allow that. You just have to aid in defeating an ogre threatening the city. Details for that are also on the card.”
Oliver slowly bent down to pick up the card. It seemed this guy wasn’t lying, on the card, in gilded lettering, were names, locations and requirements for each different faction. Unhappy with his situation, he quickly stuffed it into his own pocket.
“Is that it then?” Oliver demanded. “Any other allowances Veris wants to give me?”
“No, that’s as much as Veris is willing to give,” Mr. Simmons answered, knocking his cigarette on the side of the table to knock off the ashes. “I will note that when working for a faction, you’ll have to pay into the faction with each mission you complete. However, there is the benefit of  your parents receiving a stipend should you perish in the line of duty. That’s all for now. You’re free to go. Don’t dilly dally on making your decision though, we’ll be checking in on you.”
Not wanting to listen to another word, Oliver spun on his heel and exited the room, slamming the door behind him.
*That bastard...* he fumed, stomping down the hallway. *I should’ve just blasted him with a Mighty Blow and wiped that smirk off his face! And he had the gall to tell me to exit the room first, even though I’m the one working here and he’s the visitor! I can’t believe this...*
—
Later, after work, Oliver was sitting at a table in a 24 hour cafe, thoughtlessly spinning the card Mr. Simmons had given him by balancing it between his finger and the table, corner to corner, and flicking the edge. A cup of lukewarm tea sat untouched on the far side of the table. For his part, Oliver was trying to determine his next course of action.
*To start at the beginning, I have to make a choice. One of four options, each with their own challenge. Law & Order: prevent three crimes before they happen. Gloamharvest Farms: learn how to turn a corpse into fertilizer. The Thoughtspire Academy: pass a history quiz. And finally, staying factionless: team up with others to defeat an ogre.*
*First, let’s see if we can make any easy eliminations. Right off the bat, the Thoughtspire Academy doesn’t feel like the right fit for me. I’m really not the bookish type and I’m not very confident about passing a quiz about history.*
*That narrows it down to three. What about the challenges of the remaining options? The Gloamharvest option also sounds like studying, which isn’t my forte, but the whole faction shouldn’t be like that. Law & Order... I’m not really even sure how I’d go about that. Would I have to wait around somewhere where I think crime might happen and try to guess who is going to do something and intervene without breaking any laws myself? That sounds incredibly challenging... What about the factionless option? I have to fight an orge that’s estimated to be three meters tall? Even with my new enhancements, I find the odds there unappealing. Could I work as a supporter with other strong beyonders? Stick to the shadows, try to help others in bad spots and maybe finish it off with a Mighty Blow? That might be manageable.*
*Ranking the challenges by preference, I suppose that I’d go for the factionless challenge first, assuming I can find other beyonder allies, then somehow the Gloamharvest Farms challenge comes in second, and then finally the Law & Order challenge. I even might say that unless I’ve forgotten something about the Law & Order faction that would really benefit me, I’d consider it out of the running.*
*What are the benefits of each remaining option then? Being factionless is immediately appealing. I wouldn’t have people looking over my shoulder all the time, and wouldn’t have to donate into the faction for everything I do. More autonomy is generally good, as is more money. I could be more flexible with what I choose to do.*
*On ther other hand, if that slimy fucker wasn’t lying, then the Gloamharvest Farms have the potions for advancement of my pathway. I haven’t been able to find anything about that blue-eyed woman in all the days I’ve searched for her and I have no idea where to start otherwise in finding the next potion for my path. Additionally, there’s a lot I don’t know about this whole pathway system. Joining a faction could give me a good opportunity to learn about that type of thing. Ugh, that’s making me think about studying again... Let’s move on...*
*As far as I can tell, the only benefit that Law & Order might have over Gloamhaven farms is the activities. If I join that faction, I might be able to get permission to use the deadlier facets of my Assassin powers and not have to deal with farming. But with that being said, I’d probably lose out on access to advancement for my pathway... And otherwise, everything is the same as Gloamharvest. Okay, we’re scrapping Law & Order.*
*So we’re down to two. Factionless or Gloamharvest. Both have significant upsides. On the side of factionless, it has the easiest challenge, freedom and money. On the side of Gloamharvest, it has a safer challenge, easier advancement, and more potential knowledge. And on the side of Oliver, he has a headache...*
Oliver set down the spinning card, closed his eyes and rubbed his temples. After a moment, he opened his eyes again and stood up, tossing a few coins onto the table to pay for the cup of tea he didn’t drink.
“I need to clear my head,” he told himself as he exited the shop onto the street. He decided to just go on a run. Get into his body. The government knew about him now, so there was no need to be that secretive anymore.
He tore off down the road, leaving the coffee shop and any pedestrians in the dust.
As he ran, he did his best to simply follow his instincts.
*Turn here.*
*Leap that barrel.*
Anytime a thought tried to force its way into his head, Oliver sped up enough that all he would be able to think about was how hard he was running.
Faster and faster he tore through the streets of  Varnheim.
*Slide under that cart.*
*Dodge that pedestrian.*
*Climb that trellis onto the roof.*
*Jump that gap.*
Soon, Oliver was flowing, moving instinctively, his feet finding purchases the he didn’t even consciously register. He was bounding rooftop to rooftop, ledge to ledge, running deftly across clotheslines without even knowing what he was doing. The wind whistled past him.
Unfortunately, upon leaping a particularly large gap, Oliver had the misfortune to look down. Immediately, the world rushed back to him. His body froze up midflight and he just barely cleared the gap, crashing onto the rooftop and rolling a few feet before coming to a stop.
Oliver lay there for a moment, gasping for breath, heart beating rapidly, body shaking with exertion and fear. What had he just been doing? Trying to kill himself? How hadn’t he noticed what he was doing? What could possibly have made him do such a thing? He was literally millimeters from death!
He tried to push himself to his feet, but only ended up making it to his knees before falling forward onto his arms and throwing up. The stomach acid tore into his throat, making breathing painful as he struggled to catch his breath and calm himself.
*Why am I on the roof? I’m gonna fall again and die! No, that’s not true, right? It feels true! I need to think of something else. What was I thinking of before? Falling to my death? No, my decision. Gloamharvest versus factionless. Both are good options, it’s a tough choice. What’s the difference maker? Whatever means I never have to go above ground level again! No, that’s irrational. What really matters to me? What am I wanting out of this new life? Freedom? Freedom got me here onto the roof. Advancement? The potion got me here too!*
Oliver thrust his head up, looking through bleary eyes, searching for any magical truth to his situation. Some way to gain his sense of bearing on this rooftop, in this new world. And somehow, he found it.
Oliver looked across the rooftop, across the thoroughfare and into the window of an apartment building. Inside that window, an older woman with graying hair tied up in a bun was helping an older man wearing dirty clothes and a hat into a cushioned chair. After she had done so, the woman leaned down and gave the man a quick peck on the cheek. The older man smiled, grabbed her hand and kissed it as well. Both of them chuckled.
This was it. Harold and Glenda. Oliver’s parents. He wanted to protect them. He wanted to give them a happy life. He didn’t want to be a burden anymore. The old Oliver had felt the same way, and it led him to despair. But not Henry, not the new Oliver. He would take this urge and use it to ground himself.
He had come to his decision.
—
Oliver found himself in front of the Gloamharvest Farms branch office in the heart of the city. After clambering down from the rooftop, Oliver had spent the rest of the evening and all of the next day finding libraries, searching through books and writing down new ideas about using corpses as fertilizer. In other words, actually studying.
It had been a brutal process. Finding the materials had somehow been the exciting part. At least then he could get up and move around to find them. But once he had what he needed, he had no choice but to buckle down and simply read. By some miracle, the old Oliver’s reading skills were somewhat better than Henry’s in his previous life, so he was able to get through the information quicker than he might have. But it was still a rough process. Oliver was sure that anyone good at studying could blow through all he read in an afternoon rather than the entire day he spent. Nevertheless, it was done.
And so here he was, pushing open the doors into the Gloamhaven Farms office.
He entered into a small reception area with a portly man sitting at a desk, filing some papers. Off to the side was a couch and a couple of chairs, presumably for people to make themselves comfortable when waiting. On either side of the reception desk stood a door proceeding further into the building.
“Um, excuse me,” Oliver greeted. “My name is Oliver Beckett and I’m here to apply to the Gloamharvest Farms faction.”
The man at the desk looked up at him blankly and scratched his cheek.
Resolve somewhat shaken, Oliver continued on. “I was given this card by a Mr. Simmons and told to complete the task noted on it. Which I did.”
Oliver took the card out of his pocket and slid it across the desk to the receptionist. Upon inspecting it, the man let out a sound of recognition.
“Ahh, why didn’t you say so!” the man replied, sliding the card back to Oliver. “This location isn’t the one most people like you come to, to be perfectly honest, so it took me a moment to register.”
Oliver picked up the card. “Oh, do I need to go somewhere else?”
“No, you should be fine,” said the receptionist. “I think we have someone high enough up the ranks here to administer the test. You’ll have to give me a moment though. Please make yourself at home, it won’t be long.”
The receptionist stood up and made his way through the door on the left of the desk.
For his part, Oliver sat down on one of the nice chairs and filed through the information he had learned today. He needed to make sure he wasn’t forgetting any of it.
After a few moments, the rotund receptionist returned, followed by a tall, spindly man, that almost reminded Oliver of a beanstalk. The receptionist spoke first, introducing himself and his companion.
“Mr. Beckett, my name is Reinhard Campbell while this fellow next to me is Christoph Bandholz. He’ll be in charge of your assessment today.”
Christoph inclined his head towards Oliver. “It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
“Uh, it’s a pleasure to meet you too,” Oliver replied.
“Follow me.”
Christoph led Oliver through the doors behind the reception desk and along a series of hallways.
“So, typically people go to the actual farms to do these tests, so we don’t actually have the proper setup for the assessment here. Normally, we have our applicants actually take a body and turn it into fertilizer. Unfortunately, we don’t have an area prepared currently to make that possible. However, what the test actually measures is the applicants ability to deal with the dead as well as make sure they have either the requisite knowledge to aid our organization or the faculties to learn. So if we use a slightly different test, as long as it measures the same things, it should be fine.”
Christoph and Oliver ended up in front of a fully sealed door. There were barely any visible cracks between the door and the ground or wall. Christoph turned to look at Oliver.
“How this test is going to work is that I’m going to open this door, we’ll both walk in, you’ll lay down in the middle of the room and then recite to me the theory of how one could use a human to grow food. Do you have any questions about the test or the organization before we begin?”
Oliver thought for a second before replying, “Is it true that our close family is given a sustainable income in the event of our death?”
“That’s a somewhat grim question,” answered Christoph. “But not unreasonable. Yes, if you are killed in the line of duty, your family will be fairly compensated.”
Oliver steeled himself. “All right, then let’s start.”
“Very well,” Christoph replied. He opened the door in front of them.
Immediately, the rotting smell of the dead filled Oliver’s nostrils. Even though the room’s lighting was dim, Oliver could see clearly with his **Heightened Senses**. The inside of the room was full of corpses!
Mainly human corpses, but some corpses of small animals also littered the small room.
“Go ahead,” called out Christoph. “Lay on down. Then you may begin.”
Oliver felt his stomach begin to churn, but this wasn’t the same type of feeling as falling through the air to his death. He could handle this. He entered the room, pushed aside a couple of cadavers on the floor to make some room and laid down.
“Okay, so the first thing you want to do is put the body in a warm environment. I think 120 degrees Fahrenheit to 160 degrees? Then you want to cover it with something like wood chips. You can then add some fungi to speed up the process. Then you want to make sure it’s sealed away somewhere the environment can’t change much. Then every so often, by which I mean after a number of days, you’ll want to mix up the container. Then you just need to wait until it gets to be dirt, er, soil.”
Throughout the whole explanation, Christoph had stood there silently. Now he nodded his head.
“Not the worst explanation I’ve ever heard. You can get up now.”
Oliver hastily scrambled to his feet, trying to run off any part of him that touched another corpse.
“We’ll get back to you in a couple days as to if you’ve been accepted.” Christoph continued. “Thank you for working with us. You are now free to go.”
“Thank you, sir,” Oliver replied.
After bidding Christoph and then Reinhard goodbye, he rushed towards his home. He felt that he desperately needed to bathe

1ns1h81,https://i.redd.it/a4vd1c2qvqrf1.jpeg,Google Gemini to critique my espresso shot,"Used Google Gemini to critique my espresso shot. 18/36 though took 37 seconds and I would say it was pretty spot on. Interested to see what others experience. 

That's a nice, up-close shot of your espresso! Analyzing the final result in the cup can give us some good clues about the extraction quality.
Based on the photo, here is an analysis of your espresso shot:
Espresso Shot Analysis
1. Crema Appearance and Color
 * Color: The crema is a rich, medium-to-dark brown, often described as a hazelnut or reddish-brown color. This generally indicates a well-developed extraction and is a desirable color.
 * Thickness & Texture: The crema appears to be of medium thickness and has a velvety, dense texture.
 * Mottling/Speckling: The most notable feature is the presence of darker brown speckling throughout the crema layer. This effect is often called mottling or tiger-striping (though true tiger-striping usually refers to the streaks seen during the pour).
   * Interpretation: Speckling is typically a sign of a good, dynamic extraction. It's caused by tiny insoluble coffee solids and highly concentrated oils that are suspended in the crema. It suggests you got a healthy amount of extraction, and is often an indicator of fresh coffee beans and a well-pressurized shot. Some old-school techniques specifically aim for this look.
2. Potential Extraction Clues
While we can't taste the shot or know the parameters (dose, yield, time), the look provides the following hints:
 * Positive Signs:
   * Good Crema Volume and Stability: Indicates the coffee is likely fresh (still gassing off \text{CO}_2) and the machine is delivering adequate pressure.
   * Rich Color and Mottling: Suggests a full, well-rounded extraction where the water has flowed through the coffee bed effectively without severe channeling.
 * Minor Considerations (Could be a sign of):
   * Slightly Dark Crema: The overall darkness suggests you are pulling a good, rich shot, but if the shot tastes overly bitter or astringent (dry on the palate), it could indicate a very slight degree of over-extraction or a high brew temperature. If the taste is balanced, you're fine.
Conclusion
Visually, this is a very well-pulled espresso shot. The dense, speckled crema is what many home and professional baristas strive for.
The real test, however, is always the taste!
How did it taste? (Specifically, was it balanced, or did it lean too much toward sourness or bitterness?)

1ns1gze,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/1ns1gze/ausom/,Ausom,"""Let me tell you about the first real ride 1 had on my Ausom.
I was in Austria, early morning, streets still quiet. I rolled the scooter out, tapped the NFC key, and the display lit up like it was waiting just for me. The moment 1 pulled the throttle, I felt it - smooth, silent power, and the road just started to melt away under me.
I cruised past a bakery, the smell of fresh bread in the air, and people sipping their first coffee of the day. They looked up as I passed, maybe curious, maybe jealous this sleek black machine just gliding
by. When I hit the cycle lane by the river, that's when I opened it up. Sport mode. The motor pulled hard, the wind started rushing past my ears, and the Danube sparkled in the sunlight beside me. It was freedom, pure and simple.
There was this one hill thought might slow me down but the scooter climbed it like it was nothing. At the top, I stopped for a second, looked out at the rooftops and the distant Alps, and thought, yeah, this is why I got it.
On the way down, I carved the corners smooth, brakes tight and sharp when I needed them. A cyclist cut across at one point, and I slowed just enough, shared that knowing smile with him, and kept going. By the time I reached the city square, I felt like I'd ridden through two worlds the old stone arches of the medieval streets and the glass towers of the modern city. And here's the best part: I folded the scooter, walked into a cafe, battery still full of juice, and just sat there with this grin on my face thinking, this thing is going to take me everywhere.""

1ns1gg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HardwareHit/comments/1ns1gg7/does_the_yealink_bh70_computer_headset_truly/,Does the Yealink BH70 Computer Headset Truly Deliver for Work Calls?,"Testing out the Yealink BH70 Mono wireless headset has been quite the experience. This device is a great representation of how far Bluetooth headsets have come, especially for someone like me who spends long hours in meetings or enjoys zoning out to music at the end of a workday. Marketed as Teams-certified, the BH70 aims to appeal to professionals seeking seamless audio quality and reliable connectivity—two features it manages to excel in most of the time.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of this Bluetooth headset feels well-thought-out. Its lightweight construction impressed me during extended calls; I hardly noticed it was on my head, even after several hours. The carefully designed ear cup with rounded tips and a flexible adjustment mechanism ensures the fit is customized just right. I've used other headsets that press into my ears too hard or feel loose—this one feels just snug enough. The plastic used in the carrying case seems durable, though I might argue it looks slightly cheap compared to some higher-end competitors. Still, it holds the headset securely, and it's portable enough to slip into my bag.

All in all, I’d say the comfort factor stands out for me. I wouldn’t hesitate to wear this headset for back-to-back meetings or on a long commute. Combined with its ergonomic standards and lightweight design, it's clear the developers spent time evaluating real-world wearability. 

**Sound Quality: Calls and Music**  
Sound clarity is where this device showcases some serious strengths. With its dynamic driver and three built-in MEMS microphones, audio on calls comes through crisp and clean without the muddy distortion that cheaper wireless headsets often have. The Yealink BH70’s acoustic shield technology does an exceptional job of blocking out background noise. I tested this feature during a busy day when my neighbor decided to start a construction project, and the reduction in distractions was incredible. If you're ever stuck working from a noisy coffee shop like I sometimes am, this will be your saving grace.

Music enthusiasts will likely appreciate the dynamic EQ feature that adapts sound to different music genres. I shuffled through pop, classical, and a little bass-heavy EDM to see how well it handled transitions, and I wasn’t disappointed. Each genre sounded full and balanced without sudden distortions. The bass hits impressively deep, while the midrange tones and highs deliver a crispness that feels rich without being overbearing. For audio quality alone, this headset is a reliable companion.

[Check Yealink BH70 Mono Teams Certified price on Amazon.](https://nilvec.com/p/b0d2dgxy7r/)

**Battery Life That Delivers**  
The claim of up to 35 hours of talk time seemed ambitious, so of course, I had to put the battery to the test. While I didn’t use it non-stop, I definitely lost track of how often I needed to charge it because it lasted so long. For someone who hops from Zoom meetings in the daytime to personal calls in the evening, not having the constant anxiety of a dying headset is a major win. I only had to plug it into the charging stand once after nearly a week of intermittent use—that’s an undeniable advantage for professionals or anyone on a busy schedule.

**Merits**  
- Lightweight and comfortable for day-long usage  
- Dynamic EQ adjusts to music genres for immersive audio  
- Teams-certified for professional video conferencing  
- Clear call quality thanks to acoustic shield technology  
- Long-lasting 35-hour battery life  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Plastic carrying case feels less premium compared to competitors  
- The touch controls can be overly sensitive at times  
- Bass-heavy music lovers may wish for even deeper low notes  

Despite these minor criticisms, I think it gets more right than wrong.  

**Product Rivals**  
Looking at its competitors, there’s stiff competition in the consumer headset market. One such rival is the Jabra Evolve2 series, which also features noise-cancellation and enjoys widespread popularity for its premium design. While those headsets feel a bit sturdier and more premium in hand, they do come with a steeper price tag. Sound-wise, Jabra edges slightly ahead in bass performance, yet it doesn’t deliver quite as clear and balanced mids and highs as the BH70. Battery life also remains the Yealink BH70’s ace in the hole; Jabra’s models don’t typically offer talk-time beyond 30 hours.

Another contender is the Logitech Zone Wireless, tuned for professionals but with more budget-friendly pricing. Although an excellent option in terms of affordability and utility, Logitech doesn't quite match the Yealink's seamless Teams integration or noise-canceling capabilities. That said, the Logitech headset's push-button controls are arguably easier for daily use compared to the touch interface on the BH70.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Considering its ergonomic design, the blend of call and music quality, and the industry-leading battery life, the Yealink BH70 feels like a well-justified investment. At its price point, it slots in as a middle-tier headset that offers high-tier performance in key areas. If you’re someone who needs a versatile headset for both professional Teams calls and casual use, this is a smart option that doesn’t demand regular charging. Plus, the added convenience of the charging stand in the bundle feels like real added value—not a gimmick.

I think that’s what amped up my nausea as well by dealing with withdrawals. I never felt the need of wanting it due to constant puking and feeling like crap first trimester. Before pregnancy, my morning routine consisted of a cup of coffee and hitting my vape like no one’s business. I am currently 20 weeks now and starting to feel normal again and drinking coffee (don’t tell me it’s bad I already know leave me alone lol) but now I catch myself wanting my vape again. Maybe because I made it a habit of having it with my coffee? I feel guilty for wanting it and side eye my sister when she is hitting hers and just think about how relaxed I would be if I was still vaping. Sounds horrible I know. 

I wanna know from all moms who had vaped before dealt with cravings and what methods you tried while pregnant to not get them or at least limit it? 

And please don’t put a smart answer and say “quit coffee”…. I already sacrificed vaping, drinking, rollercoasters, and hot tubs 😩 I can’t live without my cup of Joe. ",2,1758995084.0,pregnant,4,1.0,False

1ns1dpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1ns1dpk/f4m_coffee_shop_owner_x_ceos_son_slice_of_life/,F4M — Coffee Shop Owner x CEO’s Son. Slice of life🌹,"

I’m looking for someone to step into the role of the son of the city’s most powerful bank CEO. Your character is rich, sophisticated, well-groomed, and used to moving in high society. You are the kind of man who usually dates girls of the same class, meeting them at glittering parties and carefully arranged set-ups. Your life is polished, calculated, and wrapped up in expectation.

And then, one morning, you walk into my world.

I’ll be playing a working-class girl who’s carved out her own space in the city after a rough start in life. Estranged from my parents, I ran away young and eventually opened a small coffee shop in a struggling part of the city. Despite the brokenness around it, the café has become a beacon of warmth and light — something I built with my own hands and heart. It’s here that our worlds collide.

✨ About My Character ✨
	•	Height: 5’3
	•	Build: Slim but curvy
	•	Appearance: Black hair, tattooed, brown eyes
	•	Personality: Reserved, cautious, and carrying walls from my past. But beneath it all, I’m a hopeless romantic — soft, loyal, and loving once you’ve earned my trust.

🖋️ Writing Style & Expectations
	•	I write in first person and ask that you do the same.
	•	I’m semi-literate and will usually write several paragraphs to keep the story flowing.
	•	I’m looking for someone who enjoys a mix of romance, tension, and emotional depth.

If you’re interested in stepping into the shoes of the CEO’s son — a man who’s never known the simplicity of love until he finds it in a small coffee shop — send me a message. Let’s create something full of longing, slow-burn tension, and maybe even a little bit of fate. 

I WFH so replies vary from time to time. BST time.

I live in a major US city but surprisingly have yet to find as good or better pour over than I can do at home here, so stick to espresso when I’m out.

**I’m really excited to get some elite level pour overs — and pick up beans to take home on this trip. I already know MAME is a mandatory stop. 

Are there other must-try cafes for pour overs and/or roasters?**

I already plan on grabbing a few bags of beans from the usual suspects of amazing European roasters (Dak, Friedhats, April, Coffee Collective, Tanat and the like) while I’m there to avoid shipping and tariffs - **so for roasters I’m mainly looking for recs of roasters in Germany and Switzerland that are incredible but aren’t necessarily on our radar in the US, or available here.**

What I like:

—Light/lighter roasting. I don’t want to be able to taste the roast in the cup (no caramel, nutty, etc). Within lighter roasting, I like pretty much every bean and every processing under the sun, from washed and natural to advanced processing to co-ferments (true co-ferments least preferable though as they’ll never be my daily cups).

—Though I love so many types of beans, my all time favorites have tended to be Geshas (Panama, Honduras, Colombia & Ecuador), great Kenyans, Pink Bourbons - and then funkier stuff like Ombligon and Diego Bermudez thermal shock Castillos.

—I have or have had subs to SEY, Tim Wendelboe, Flower Child, Onyx, Black & White, Black & White Black Label, Luminous, Hydrangea and September. I like/liked the majority of what they put out and what I have had from them.

—I’ve had subscriptions to Passenger, Atlas and Sightglass, and didn’t enjoy them. Quality beans, but a heavier roast profile than I enjoy.

Thanks in advance! Love the support, insight and knowledge this sub shares. 🤗",1,1758994851.0,pourover,2,1.0,False
1ns1c0n,https://i.redd.it/0zq7k70ouqrf1.png,My engagement has been really low. How to market myself and which way should I be heading towards art-wise?,"Hi fellow artists and viewers,

This is the first time I have done a post with a real question on this art subreddit lol. So in the past, I usually got decent engagement, both on reddit, insta, and fb, which was, and still is where I mainly got my client. I have done a stupid thing, due to me being really insecure with my art, stopped posting for a period of almost 2 year. After that, I tried to gain back my momentum as I was thinking of starting a career as a freelancer.

But the thing is, it seems now the game has changed, all of my posts get like 100 interactions max on fb, and barely make it to 50 on insta. Barely any share, nor lead. The only clients I get recently are either returning ones, or those who found me through an artblog site. I try posting all types of \[For Hire\] and commenting on \[Hiring\] posts, but no luck either.

I was so desperate that I started wondering if this could be a ploy from meta to push me to using their Ads? What if traffics will pick up after I use it once or twice.

I also have a problem of not knowing whom to gear my portfolio towards. I feel like I can do most thing if needed, but just generally I don't really feel it? if that makes sense, so my art is just generally all over the place. I just can't figure out my niche yet.

So I would like to ask, what is the vibe you guys see from my feed? If you were to book me, what type of work (genre, format, either commercial or not) do you think I am best for? Do you feel like my work is speaking more towards professional (games, films) or casual commissioners?

Should I even use ad?

Right now I have in mind the gay community (but not the NSFW), and maybe I'm learning some 3D to help with some scifi or fantasy worldbuilding illustration, like Simon Stalenhag's style. See, I love scifi as a genre but I feel like fantasy is easier to paint. The heart and the hands just don't get together.

I don't even know if these markets are saturated yet. Urgh.

Any advices would be really really helpful. Thank you for reading my rant. I hope you have a great weekend!",4,1758994825.0,ArtMarketingTalk,0,1.0,False

I actually checked with a travel agency at first, but in the end I thought it might be more flexible and less “tour group” stress to do it on my own.

  Day 1: Statue of Liberty cruise + Manhattan skyline

  Day 2: Roosevelt Island Tramway + Midtown walks

  Day 3: Woodbury Outlets (shopping day)

  Day 4: Broadway show night (Phantom / Lion King)

  Day 5: Guggenheim Museum + Central Park stroll

Packing list **(still working on it):**

* Comfortable walking shoes (NYC = lots of walking)
* Power bank & SIM/eSIM card
* Light jacket (evenings can be chilly)
* Small crossbody bag (safer than backpack in crowded areas)

Must-have apps I’m trying out:

* Tickets: GetYourGuide (easy for museum / attraction tickets)
* Trip planner & local food picks: Wanderboat (suggests hidden gems & cozy spots I wouldn’t normally find)

That’s the rough plan, would love your advice:

* Anything I should swap in/out?
* Any hidden food spots or neighborhoods worth checking out?
* Packing tips I might be missing?

Thanks in advance! First time to the US, so a bit nervous but excited!

1ns1ac6,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartwarming/comments/1ns1ac6/a_polished_rock_collection/,A polished rock collection,"As a child I was often by myself, I got bullied and my cousins were all in different grades so I tended to just not talk to the other kids. It wasn't that I was shy, I was loud and obnoxious as hell, and that was what really concerned my parents. I refused to talk to my classmates or other kids on the park but for some reason had no problem chatting up a storm with teachers or substitutes, I was in the ""behavioral issues"" category in elementary school and it tends to be the opposite for them (Behavioral issue cases usually talk to other kids more and avoid adults or are antagonistic to adults) I was sent to therapy and the therapist was very confused as to why I was there, she said that I seemed fine and there was nothing inherently wrong with me. I was a lot nicer to her than I was to my teachers but she hadn't been letting other children bully me so I felt it was justified. 

Anywho, on to the heartwarming part of this story. I was acting up at school so my dad took me to work with him, he was working at an old woman from our church's house and figured I could keep her company; she always seemed lonely and visibly perked up when chatting with the church kids. Her grandkids lived numerous hours away and her husband had passed so I think she found comfort in the Sunday school and the general congregation. Little did my father know that he had started a friendship for the history books by pulling me out of school on a random Thursday. At first i was nervous, I had talked with her before but not for long and now I was spending an unspecified amount of time with her (and I was 7 so I really had negative social skills). But it was one of the best days of my life. She had this gigantic orange cat named Garfield, who despite looking like his namesake did not, in fact, enjoy lasagna, who ended up taking a liking to me and curling up on my lap. We sat in her living room and just talked about a million different things; the weather, cats, the best kind of tea, favourite colours, candy and eventually landed on the topic of family. She spoke about her husband with reverence straight from a fairytale, her eyes lit up as she told me about him as a person and their life together. I always loved stories but hers were the absolute best, I could have listened her talk for years and before I knew it we had talked the whole day and it was time to go home. For the first time in my life I sobbed over someone I wasn't related to and begged to stay with her for just a little longer. It took her 8 hours to become one of the most important people in my young life and I adored her. We ended up going home with a promise we could talk again during coffee and fellowship at church, and something precious too. Before we left she had pulled me to the side, wiped my tears and given me a hug before telling me to stay right there for a moment. She disappeared into a room and came back holding a little white bag, one of those tuille ones for jewelry, and said she had something for me, that if anyone should have it it was me. The bag was full of small polished rocks, and don't get me wrong I love rocks but I was a little confused (again I was 7) until I heard her explanation. They were her husband's, he had collected them one by one, only ever when they caught his eye and had carefully curated the collection before me; ""I think he would have wanted you to have them, you remind me so much of him"" As much as she loved her kids and grandkids, none of them had the time or care to just sit and talk, to actually ask her about her life but I had. Her husband loved books, travelling, rocks and it was the first time in a long time that she had talked with anyone about those things. 

For the next couple of years she was my best friend, weird I know considering she had 60 years on me, but it was honestly some of the best times of my life. I was chatty and for the first time there was someone who would not only listen to me but would actively participate in conversations and challenge me to think outside of the box. I was just cleaning my room and I found the bag and I could not help but smile. I kept the original bag and all of the rocks are still safely tucked into it, she passed almost eight years ago but I still have our memories and the precious cargo that she entrusted to me. There are no words to describe how special it was that she gave me one of the last things she had of her husband, and now I keep it as a momento of both of them, but especially of the woman who helped me not only expand my mind but also get so much more comfortable with my own self. I am no longer afraid to chat up a storm over things I am passionate about and she was my first friend of many because she taught me how to open up and not fear rejection. She is everything I want to be when I am older, and I have been collecting my own bag of polished rocks, it is finally complete and I am planning on giving it to a friend before starting a new one. It is a small gesture but it is the one that changed my life, maybe it can change others too.",1,1758994716.0,heartwarming,0,1.0,False

I’m an Indian PR guy living in Sinagra (northern suburbs of Perth). I’m a bit of an introvert but trying to step out of my comfort zone and meet new people.

For months (okay, years 😅) I catastrophized about the surgery and put it off because of fear. I want to encourage anyone else who’s dreading it—so far it hasn’t been anywhere near as bad as I thought.

A few things that have helped me:

Recliner setup: I have an electronic recliner. I folded our king mattress topper into thirds and put it on the chair—instant cocoon. With pillows on both sides, I’m sleeping better than ever. Honestly, I don’t even want to get out of it.

Ice machine: 100% a must-have. Couldn’t imagine recovery without it.

Support system: My husband has been amazing—he sleeps on the couch next to me, sets alarms to give me meds every 4–6 hours, brings coffee and meals, and helps with everything. The bathroom’s only 20 feet away from my chair, which makes things a lot easier too.

I’m only on day 5, so I know the road is long, but I’m already looking forward to getting my other shoulder done in December.

If you’ve been putting this surgery off because of fear—take it from me, just trust your doctors and your support system and the universe and just do it if you need it.",2,1758994638.0,RotatorCuff,1,1.0,False
1ns1964,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1ns1964/explore_the_best_pour_over_coffee_maker_hario/,Explore the Best Pour Over Coffee Maker Hario PDA-02-T and Is It Worth It,"Using the Hario PDA-02-T is like stepping into the world of precision coffee brewing but without the complicated jargon or extensive manual effort. I’ve been using it consistently for my morning pour-overs, and I must say, this device has brought some serious ease to the whole process. With its redefined simplicity and clear build, it seamlessly integrates into my daily routine. Hario PDA-02-T, or simply the drip-assist, deserves its reputation for being user-friendly while delivering delicious, barista-level coffee.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing you notice about this product is its lightweight design and the clear, polished appearance. It’s compact enough to fit in almost any kitchen setup without crowding your counter. The slightly matte exterior gives it a modern yet understated vibe. The included filter and reusable design reduce the need for disposable paper filters, which is a definite win for anyone trying to be environmentally conscious. Though it’s manufactured in Japan, the quality assurance is evident in every detail. Durability is certainly not a concern when you handle it, and hand-washing it is straightforward thanks to its smooth surfaces.

**User-Friendly Operation**

What stands out is just how easy this device is to operate. You simply place the Drip-Assist on top of a size 02 V60 dripper and start pouring hot water. There’s no need for a gooseneck kettle, which takes out a major barrier for casual users. The innovative water flow mechanism, with its various sized holes, ensures even pouring. This feature particularly impressed me on my first few tries because it eliminates that accidental overpour mess we’re all guilty of. Learning curve? Practically non-existent.

[Check Hario PDA-02-T price on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b08xbjnvqh/)

**Performance and Coffee Quality**

The real magic happens with that even-flow coffee dripper. It allows hot water to flow evenly into the central section of the filter. This gives your coffee grounds the right amount of contact time with water, translating to perfectly extracted coffee. I've tested it with light, medium, and even dark roast beans, and I consistently get well-balanced coffee. Even better, the additional instructions are a breeze: a quick initial pour of 50-70ml into the center, a brief pause, and then continuing with the remaining water into the outer ring. It’s simplicity combined with genius.

**Merits**

- Lightweight and compact design fits effortlessly into different kitchen setups.
- Replaces the need for specialized pouring devices like a gooseneck kettle.
- Reusable filter is both cost-effective and eco-friendly.
- Provides evenly extracted coffee, even for beginners.
- Easy cleaning thanks to its design and quality materials.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Water flow can be slightly slower for certain grind sizes, which might bother users looking for quicker brews.
- Limited to 02 V60 drippers, which narrows compatibility with other pour-over designs.
- Touching the metal parts on humid days makes it feel a little slippery.

**Competitive Options**

Looking at competitors like the Chemex pour-over systems or the Kalita Wave, which I’ve also tried, Hario’s Drip-Assist stands out for its simplicity and beginner-friendly design. The Chemex produces great coffee but requires a bit more skill and patience, along with their expensive proprietary filters. The Kalita Wave, while excellent for professionals, leans a bit more towards the traditional skill requirements of pour-over methods. Hario's design tackles these barriers by making it accessible to virtually anyone. However, in terms of aesthetic appeal, Chemex edges ahead due to its iconic glass carafe.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

For a manual brewing system of this caliber, the price-to-quality ratio feels fair. Unlike traditional coffee machines, where repair or replacements are costly, the drip-assist is straightforward, reliable, and easy to maintain. Being compact and manual, it consumes no electricity, already saving you ongoing utility costs. Given these factors, it feels like it’s worth every penny for a coffee enthusiast or someone diving into pour-over brewing for the first time.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1758994600.0,2canadian4you,0,1.0,False

1ns1834,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ns1834/my_mom_67f_has_sepsis_for_the_third_time_from/,My mom (67f) has sepsis for the third time from UTIs she never has symptoms of until she is septic. I have questions.,"*What the hell can we do to prevent these or at least identify them sooner so they stay at UTIs and don’t become kidney infections that nearly kill her?!*

She lives with me. She drinks water all day. She rarely drinks pop/soda. Never drinks alcohol. Has 1-2 cups of coffee a day. She is not sexually active. She wipes front to back with a long-handled wiper and I do her laundry and never see any evidence that maybe she isn’t wiping adequately. She has physical limitations. She can walk short distances and does ambulate around my one-story house but needs help with stuff like laundry (in the basement) and taking trash to the road and stuff. She uses a cane when we’re out and she is walking those short distances but we use a wheelchair most of the time because she isn’t usually just walking a short distance or standing for a short time then. Psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis are what cause the physical issues. She uses a wheelchair to move around the house when she is cleaning. She cooks and does dishes. She runs a small online business I help very, very little with. 

She is 5’6” and 240 pounds. She actually used to be close to 400 but buckled down right away when she was diagnosed with diabetes. Her other health conditions besides arthritis and diabetes are CKD (caused by the first bout of sepsis), mild-moderate aortic stenosis, depression, a-fib, high BP and slightly high cholesterol. All of these conditions are stable and well-managed. She sees a cardiologist, her PCP, and a nephrologist. She takes losartan, Ozempic, Eliquis, rouvastatin, metformin, fluoxetine, hydrochlororthiazide, verapimil, and a multivitamin. She takes tramadol occasionally. She gets prescribed 30 and they last her months. 

This is her latest progress note:
“Patient with past medical history significant for recurrent kidney stones with recurrent urosepsis presented to the ED for sudden left flank pain.  In the ED, patient had soft blood pressure and was placed on 2 L of oxygen.  Blood work significant for a creatinine of 1.2, lactic acid of 4.6, and procalcitonin 7.7.  Cat scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a stone with obstruction on the left side in addition to hydronephrosis.  Patient was started on Zosyn.  Blood cultures grew Gram-negative rods.  
 
Urology evaluated the patient and they did a cystoscopy with left retrograde pyelogram in addition to stent insertion.  Patient was then transferred to the general floors for observation.
 
Patient's blood pressure remained low despite multiple boluses of IV fluids in which ICU where called for evaluation.  ICU accepted the patient and she was sent there for probable pressor support.
 
Patient seen in the ICU for approximately 24 hours in which she was given extra boluses of IV fluids and was never started on pressors.  Blood pressure improved and she was sent to the general floors”

She got potassium chloride in the ICU and that brought her BP up. Nurse said they did not need to start pressor. 

She gets the UTI she never has a symptom of, it travels up her kidney, the kidney stones (to my understanding) block the infection in the kidney, it festers, the rest of her body doesn’t know it’s there, and she gets septic. Her white blood cell count was normal when we got to the ER and shot way up right after the stent was put in because the infection started moving and THEN her body recognized it. 

*Her morphology lab today says she has poikinocytosis and echinocytosis. Can these just be because of the sepsis?*

I only ask this because her father had sideroblastic anemia that caused liver cancer that he passed from. I am reading sideroblastic anemia can be genetic. It looks like those things were only ever tested before in the 2021 hospital stay. They were normal at that time. 

I typed a lot and I am sorry. I wanted to add as much detail as possible. My mom is my best friend in the universe. Everyone who meets her adores her. I am terrified of losing her.

I tried befriending someone at a nee company I work at. Im a Sr engineer while they are a PM. 

We started around the same time and she sort of ""friend bombed"" me. You know...constant coffee breaks together, constant meet ups, constant lunches. 

I started opening up to her becuase I felt like she was being so open and welcoming. Im dumb...

Within two weeks of getting close she asked how much I made. I told her that I dont share that cuz I think it creates problems. 

She then started telling me about her other coworkers.. she told me an odd story(one of many) that should've sparked a red flag. 

She and her two co workers went out to lunch and they had a political convo. Long story short she was debating one side of the fence whilst the other two were on the other side. 

She then went up to one of the coworkers and said if he wanted them to be close he better think about how she feels in those situations. He said its not on him to care about her feelings. She told him he better....like wtf
Thats just one instance of oddity 

We also had a weird altercation where I was given her advice on talking to sr management. I told her some ways I was able to meet with them...she later on told me how she thought about that convo and thought why and how she didnt do more than me and why cant she think of these ideas.? 

Then she kept pushing to hang out outside of work...so I said ok no problem we went to her apartment that she just moved into with her boyfriend. 

I brought gifts for them as they just got the place. 

Then I invited her over the week after. I own a fairly nice home but I dont gloat about it...when she came in she was SHOOk and talked about how I completely down played my house. 

As the new work week entailed we went to lunch and she asked how much I made again. She kept pushing. I told her a lower rounded out answer and she jumped out immediately and said ""me too"" 

I knew it was a lie cuz her manager is my brothers friend and tried to offer me the job and was transparent on the salary vs. Qualifications. With her qualifications she was making 20k less atleast...which is whatever but I thought it was so weird she said that to me. 

After that I was pretty much ghosted. There were two company events and she completely ghosted me. 

There was an employee pullback meeting (for all newbies) and she waved to me when I walked in. I kept walking past her and sat somewhere else minding my own business. 

After that I spotted her in the office and she didnt even want to make eye contact with me. 

I dont understand what I did wrong or what weird things happened other than her scoping me out and getting upset and competitive?

Since im a Bengalurean and I'm looking for a person from Bengaluru, thats why im posting it here, also im looking for a working partner, not a investing partner and there's no investment or any monetary requirement in this post whatsoever, but if I am breaking any rules, please let me know and I will delete the post.

A little about me, im social worker, traffic volunteer, work closely with govt depts. Life coach, angel investor etc. there's a lot articles about me too, but thats not why im here, im here as a serial entrepreneur based in koramangala, my forte being sales, marketing, strategy, SOP, market research and so on, this year I wanted to launch 4 businesses however due to legal opinion delays in one business, investment escalating 4X in another business and setting up the team for app building for the other two businesses has brought all the businesses at the same point, btw did I also tell you im very good at multitasking?

So all these are bootstrapped by me and one or two of them will go for funding after proof of concept and basic mrr.

However there's a 5th start up idea, 
Which I was thinking of starting the process of testing shortly, and thats the buiness i am asking for if you want to be a part of as a working partner, honestly I dont have the time and energy for it, thats the only reason, FYI working partner means in not looking for funding and it will be funded by me, I just need to your time and energy. 

The Problem: It takes almost a full day to wash your shoes and dry it which means you can't wear it that day.

Sometimes you need that shoes for an important event or party, but its dirty, if its your formal shoes, you could polish it in less then 5 minutes, how do you do that for sneakers, sport shoes or cloth wrapped heels?

The Idea and Solution: Get your sports shoes/  sneakers, heels washed, cleaned, disinfected, dried and ready to use in 1 hours time, right now we are planning of testing it how to achieve this timeline, once it happens it will go to marketing ideation stage, then company registrations, proof of concept stage, when that happens, it may go on a franchisee model to other metros and tier 1 cities, also in testing phase we won't to keep the cost something like Rs 199 or 299 including gst and doorstep pick up drop charges.

This business will also pivot to shoe repair, especially ladies heels including the costly ones like a LV, Jimmy Choo etc.

We will also try to clean other stuff based on research as I want to keep this waterless, yeah you heard it right, thats why the research.

So if it piques the interest of anyone, DM me we will meet in person over a coffee or donne biryani and the best suitable person would be decided bssed on that meeting.

PS: Please dont ask me the secret formula of how im gonna achieve this, I won't say it until your my signed partner so do keep that in mind.

Been on Wellbutrin for 2 years. Started at 150 then went up to 300.Everything was fantastic until July of this year. I had a cold and took some over the counter cough medicine, which caused a horrible reaction. Cold chill down my body, shakes, eyesight was almost strobbing, shakes. Upon researching it I found out it reacted with my Wellbutrin. A few weeks later I had the same reaction with just coffee. I have drank coffee every day on Wellbutrin and never had a reaction. So me and my doctor lowered my dose to 150 to see if that would help. On the second week I entered absolutely wicked withdrawal. Shakes, anxiety, feeling like I could pass out, cold chills radiating out of my body, tingling head to toe. So before the end of the 3rd week I went back up to 300 again, and I'm having an extremely hard time adjusting. Waking with anxiety and feeling the medication kick in over my whole body. Very dizzy and light headed. I'm on day 3 of 300. Has anyone had an experience even close to this?

My heart rate was dropping to 38 at night and I couldn’t stay awake even with loads of coffee. He got really low A1C numbers. I am now crashing during/after workouts with nausea and dizziness. We hit the gym 3 days a week with 45 minutes of pure muscle building and 15 minutes of running/biking/sprints after. We do 2 mile walks on our off days and I sit around the rest of the day. We want to do more like hikes on the weekends or additional gym days, but we’re toast, even after upping calories to close to 3k, adding fat/protein/carbs, putting sugar back in our diet,and taking whole rest weeks. My numbers are below, female, 5’9”, was 196 and now back up to 207 pounds with the calories. Despite the weight gain, my boobs are smaller and I’m losing inches (went down a size in my underwear). Some of these sets I do multiple times a week, though some I only hit once. My lift numbers have improved after off weeks, but I feel so lazy and worried I will go back up to 400 pounds with the way I’m eating.

Now I’m not even tracking because I freaked out when I saw 2800 calories on the tracker. My ultimate goal is to be strong but also in a healthy weight range.

1ns14zf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicAttack/comments/1ns14zf/a_positive_experience/,A positive experience.,"TL;DR: If you’re afraid of starting your medication, just do it. Give it a try. It’s helped me tremendously and gave me my life back after years of constant panic.

•Background:
I wanted to share something positive in case it helps someone out there. I won’t go into every detail, but here’s my story.

I’ve had health and death anxiety since I was a child (I’m 30 now). Over the last five years, my anxiety and panic attacks got so severe that I dropped out of college and barely left the house. 
In 2021, I was prescribed Zoloft but was too scared to take it. I tried one pill, woke up in the middle of the night with a severe panic attack, so I stopped. I regret not pushing through, because I might have avoided wasting four years of my life.

Fast forward to April this year: I hit the rock bottom. Life had become unbearable with constant panic attacks. So I finally decided that I cannot take it anymore. I reached out to my healthcare provider and was prescribed Escitalopram (Lexapro for peopele in the US).

•Starting the medication:
I was terrified to start it, but I reminded myself that my life was already miserable, so what did I have to lose?
I began with 5 mg for two weeks, then 10 mg for another two weeks, and now I’m at 15 mg (my doctor recommends staying on it for a year before reassessing, but I want to stay on it for 2 years, until I graduate).

•Results:
-I’m back at college after four years away.
-I had my first coffee today after a year of avoiding caffeine. I can enjoy some chocolate and sweets again without having a panic attack  (thou I’m cutting back for weight reasons).
-I can handle stress and daily life so much better now.
-I still feel sad and low sometimes, since I am 30 and live alone.

•A final word:
For anyone scared of taking their medication (at least Escitalopram) please don’t be. I was extremely anxious about it but managed to start. The only real side effect I’ve had is weight gain: about 9–10 kg in three months because I couldn't feel satiated, especially during the first month.

•Background:
I wanted to share something positive in case it helps someone out there. I won’t go into every detail, but here’s my story.

I’ve had health and death anxiety since I was a child (I’m 30 now). Over the last five years, my anxiety and panic attacks got so severe that I dropped out of college and barely left the house. 
In 2021, I was prescribed Zoloft but was too scared to take it. I tried one pill, woke up in the middle of the night with a severe panic attack, so I stopped. I regret not pushing through, because I might have avoided wasting four years of my life.

Fast forward to April this year: I hit the rock bottom. Life had become unbearable with constant panic attacks. So I finally decided that I cannot take it anymore. I reached out to my healthcare provider and was prescribed Escitalopram (Lexapro for peopele in the US).

•Starting the medication:
I was terrified to start it, but I reminded myself that my life was already miserable, so what did I have to lose?
I began with 5 mg for two weeks, then 10 mg for another two weeks, and now I’m at 15 mg (my doctor recommends staying on it for a year before reassessing, but I want to stay on it for 2 years, until I graduate).

•Results:
-I’m back at college after four years away.
-I had my first coffee today after a year of avoiding caffeine. I can enjoy some chocolate and sweets again without having a panic attack  (thou I’m cutting back for weight reasons).
-I can handle stress and daily life so much better now.
-I still feel sad and low sometimes, since I am 30 and live alone.

•A final word:
For anyone scared of taking their medication (at least Escitalopram) please don’t be. I was extremely anxious about it but managed to start. The only real side effect I’ve had is weight gain: about 9–10 kg in three months because I couldn't feel satiated, especially during the first month.

I am posting this on Panic attack and Lexapro subreddits.

1ns10mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1ns10mc/how_to_identify_the_right_coffee_grinder_model/,How to identify the right coffee grinder model for me?,"Hey coffee enthusiasts!

I've spent the last few years diving deep into the world of coffee making, and I've learned that having the right coffee grinder can make or break your morning brew. After countless hours of research and testing different models, I want to share what I've discovered about choosing the perfect grinder.

First things first, you need to decide between blade and burr grinders. While blade grinders are cheaper, they're honestly not great for consistent grinding. Think of it like chopping herbs with a dull knife – you'll get uneven pieces that'll affect the taste of your coffee.

I personally switched to a burr grinder last year, and the difference was mind-blowing. You can find some great options here: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder. The consistency in grind size really helps extract the perfect flavor from your beans.

Here's what you should consider when picking a coffee grinder:

1. Grind Settings: More isn't always better. For most people, 15-40 settings are plenty. Unless you're a serious espresso enthusiast, you don't need 60+ settings.

2. Capacity: Think about how much coffee you typically make. If you're brewing for one or two people, a smaller hopper (around 8oz) works fine. Larger households might want something bigger.

3. Noise Level: Some grinders sound like a jet engine taking off. If you're an early riser with sleeping family members, look for models specifically designed to be quieter.

4. Build Quality: Ceramic burrs last longer than steel ones, but they're more expensive. Steel burrs are great for most people and won't break the bank.

One thing I wish someone had told me earlier is that manual grinders can be awesome for beginners. They're affordable, portable, and give you a real feel for the grinding process. Check out some solid options at https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder - I found my first manual grinder there and still use it for camping trips.

Here's a pro tip: whatever grinder you choose, clean it regularly. Coffee oils can build up and make future brews taste rancid. I clean mine every week with a brush and run some cleaning tablets through it monthly.

Also, consider your brewing method. French press needs coarse grounds, while espresso requires fine powder. Make sure your grinder can handle your preferred brewing style.

Budget-wise, you don't need to spend a fortune. While there are $500+ grinders out there, you can get excellent results from mid-range models. I started with a $60 grinder and gradually upgraded as I learned more about what I needed.

Remember, the best grinder is the one that fits your specific needs. Don't get caught up in fancy features you'll never use. Focus on consistency, reliability, and ease of use.

The pastries are very light in weight. I know some people love that. I personally associate heavier pastries with higher quality, so I prefer the dense pastries at say Blue Bottle.

So far I’ve tried the Morning Bun, I like the sugary glaze on the outside but wish it had a flavor like cinnamon. It’s just a croissant in another form. And the chocolate croissant, which was average.

* * * * *

The office was almost silent, no phones ringing, no overlapping voices spilling out of cubicles, no printers chewing through reams of paper. Just the rattle of the heater against the window and the soft rhythmic tapping of Lauren’s keyboard from the far end of the room.

Everyone else had gone home hours ago. The chairs were empty, the monitors dark. Most people had packed up last night, slipping out with that pre-holiday cheer in their steps. I told myself I had things to finish, but the truth was I didn’t want to go home just yet. Empty apartments echo worse on holidays.

When I finally closed my laptop, the snap of it sounded too loud. I reached for my phone, screen lighting up in the dim office.

“Gonna miss you, babe. But if you change your mind last minute, you know you’re always welcome.”

The corners of my mouth tugged into a smile before I realized. That was Leo. He had only been in my life a few months, but already had his way of making the air feel lighter. He was the kind of person who filled space with laughter without trying. He was steady in a way I hadn’t realized I needed, affectionate in quiet ways that stayed with me after the moment passed. He wanted me at his family’s Thanksgiving, wanted me to be woven into that world.

I leaned back in my chair and lifted my gaze to the polaroids taped above my monitor — my little gallery of proof that my life here was real. Friends from school. A road trip to LA last summer. And then the photo that always caught me like a hook: Thanksgiving 2022, written in my slanted hand across the bottom. My arm looped tight around Julian’s shoulders, our cheeks pressed together, his mom blurred in the background, waving mid-laugh, and the table spread with more food than I’d ever seen in one place.

The image punched the air from me the way it always did.

Back home, Thanksgiving wasn’t really a thing. Every weekend was already a celebration: cousins, neighbors, aunts, uncles, everyone gathered over pots of rice and curry, laughter spilling out into the courtyard. Noise, food and family—until it all blended into one. I hadn’t realized what silence could feel like until I came here. November in this country was a month of empty evenings, deserted streets while families gathered indoors.

And then there was Julian, my first love. He filled those days without asking, pulling me into his family’s orbit like I’d been there all along. That first Thanksgiving in 2022 was a table groaning under plates I couldn’t name, his dad’s running commentary on football, his brother sneaking pie before dinner. For the first time since leaving home, I belonged somewhere again.

Even the next year, 2023, when I was too sick to get out of bed, I still ended up with Julian’s family. His mom wrapped me in blankets on their couch and insisted I wasn’t alone.

And last year…

My throat tightened. 2024 was the year everything cracked. Julian and I ended after that trip to New Hampshire, both of us worn out by the ways love can be too much and not enough at the same time. His mom still invited me for Thanksgiving, her message full of warmth. But I couldn’t do it. Couldn’t sit at that table and pretend. I stayed home. Reheated noodles. Listened to the silence settle around me.

“You should take that photo down.”

I startled. Lauren stood at my desk, her coffee steaming in the mug she always carried. She nodded at the polaroid, eyes kind but firm. “I’ve told you before, staring at it only makes it harder.”

I forced a laugh that didn’t sound like one. “It’s just… a memory.”

“Not one you hold on to. And given now there’s Leo…” She paused, her gaze softening. “Listen, you don’t have to spend the night alone. My family does Thanksgiving big. Too big. You’d fit right in.”

The offer sat between us, generous and heavy. I thanked her. I meant it. But she saw the refusal forming before I even spoke it. She gave a small shrug, the kind that said I tried, and walked back to her desk.

I stared back at the photo long after she was gone, steam from her coffee still faint in the air. It wasn’t that I couldn’t let go. It was that I didn’t want to. A part of me would always love Julian, not just because he was my first, but because those Thanksgivings had been more than meals. They were a world, a family, a warmth that made me feel like I belonged in a place that wasn’t mine. You don’t erase that by pulling down a picture. You carry it, even when you’re trying to walk forward.

* * * * *

The city outside was damp, streets glistening from drizzle, streetlights bending into streaks across the windshield as I drove. Wipers dragged across the glass with a tired rhythm. Inside, the pieced-together soundtrack of my thoughts played too loudly, looping fragments of Lauren’s words, the polaroid, the silence of last year.

That silence haunted me still. The one Thanksgiving where I let the day pass like any other, reheated noodles on the counter, television glow flickering against walls that didn’t answer back. The loneliness of it pressed closer now, as if it had been waiting for me at the edge of memory.

I could still turn the car around. I could call Lauren, admit that her offer had lodged in my chest, let myself be a stranger folded into someone else’s family chaos. Lauren’s table would be easy. Laughter, food, noise—enough to drown out the silence. But would it ever be mine?

My phone buzzed where it lay in the cupholder. The message from last week glowed again, the one I hadn’t deleted: “We’ll always have a place for you at the table, sweetheart.” Julian’s mom.

My grip on the wheel tightened. That table lived in me still, the clatter of forks, the way her hand lingered on my shoulder when she passed a plate, the steady hum of voices rising and falling around me. That was belonging. And wasn’t that what I wanted again?

But then Leo. His words flickered against the dark windshield as if the city itself whispered them back: Always welcome. His family, waiting. Not knowing me yet, but opening a door anyway.

But that was the hardest thought of all. Because Thanksgiving wasn’t just Thanksgiving to me — it was Julian’s holiday. His family had made it sacred, had given me warmth when I had nothing else. To sit at another table now felt almost like betrayal, as if walking into Leo’s house meant overwriting everything Julian’s family had given me.

The weight of it all sat in my chest, heavy and restless, like the air before a storm.

That was when I saw it: a neon sign blinking OPEN in the misty dark. A pie shop, lights still humming. I pulled in on instinct.

The bell above the door jingled as I stepped inside. The smell hit me first, cinnamon, butter, apples baked into something rich and comforting. Behind the counter, a woman boxed pies with practiced motions.

“One apple, please,” I said.

She glanced up, her face lighting in surprise. “Didn’t think we’d get another customer tonight.”

She slid the pie into a box, folding the cardboard carefully. Then she studied me a moment. “Heading to dinner?”

I hesitated. “Yeah. Sort of.”

She nodded like she understood more than I said. “Funny thing about these holidays,” she said, quieter now. “You sit down one year with certain faces, certain voices, and you swear that’s how it’ll always be. Then the next year, something’s changed.” She closed the box gently, pushing it toward me. “But the old ones don’t vanish. They just… sit beside the new ones. Like layers.”

Her words landed on top of Lauren’s, soft but firmer somehow—as if answering the question Lauren hadn’t meant to ask me: was I stuck?

The box was warm against my palms as I stepped back into the drizzle. But it wasn’t just the pie I was carrying anymore. It was the weight of what I’d been given, and the space for what I might still make.

* * * * *

By the time I pulled onto the quiet suburban street, the sky had deepened into night. Houses glowed with yellow light, laughter spilling faintly through windows. Each doorway I passed felt like a possibility.

I sat in the car with the pie beside me, the smell filling the small space. My heart thudded. Every option replayed itself.

I lifted the pie, holding it close as I walked the path. My hand hovered over the door, breath caught. For a moment, they were all there with me—Lauren, reminding me not to stare backward; Julian’s mother, her voice gentle in the text I hadn’t deleted; the woman at the pie shop, her words quiet but steady: They just sit beside the new ones. Like layers.

And Julian too. Always Julian. His laugh, quick and unguarded, echoing faintly in the hum of memory. The smell of his mother’s cinnamon rolls cooling on the counter, his father’s voice booming at the television, his brother’s sly grin as he slid me an extra slice of pie. Their table stitched itself into me so deeply it became part of my own story, filling the hollow spaces of a life lived far from home. That belonging had been real, undeniable, and I knew it would never come undone. A part of me would always sit at that table, no matter where I went.

The pause stretched, long enough that even I didn’t know which choice I’d made until the door opened.

Light spilled out. And there he was—Leo. Smiling like I was exactly who he’d been waiting for.

The warmth of the house rushed at me: turkey and sage, something sweet from the oven, voices rising and falling like a tide. Leo reached for the pie before I could speak, his fingers brushing mine, then holding a moment longer than needed. His smile was steady, but his eyes flickered with something softer, as if he knew the storm I’d walked through to stand here.

My chest tightened, not with fear this time, but with the thrum of possibility. I stepped over the threshold, the pie balanced between us, his hand still anchoring mine. The noise of the house swelled, wrapping around me, and I let it pull me in.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg)). The bar staff also know who we are if you're not sure.

There's an optional Whatsapp group for the meetup -it's pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. 
If you really do want to join it just ask around at the meetup.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

It breaks my heart.,"# ❤️‍🩹 I found out most men probably don't truly want women friends...And it makes me never want to be friends with guys again ❤️‍🩹

I have always been super sweet, kind, and caring to all my friends. However, recently, I (and my girlfriends) realized I am not getting nearly as much of this energy back from men friends.

***The sweet, kind energy from men only happens when men want to date me or have a physical relationship.*** For example, my long-term platonic friend travels to see another friend with whom he can have sex, but not to see me, even though we are longer & closer friends.

❤️‍🩹 The last straw was when I sent my guy friend a birthday gift (carefully picked specialty coffee with an art card and a message - he is really into coffee) to another country a week ago, and I haven't heard from him since. WHAT THE F?!!

I don't understand. I feel so disheartened and question if y'all aren't lonely enough (sorry for that because I really tried to be there)... ***Should I just drop off all my men friendships*** because there is no point in being there for people who don't appreciate the care & see you just as an object?

# Do men just not want women friends?!

*tldr: I give a lot of love to my guy friends. They do not return it as much, especially if I don't want to date/sleep with them (even long-term friends). This makes me question if I should stop interacting with men altogether in hopes of forming a friendship. It all makes me feel like an object.*",0,1758993745.0,TrueOffMyChest,10,0.17,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Mets vs. Marlins: A Tale of Two Runnings (and a Few Injuries)**  
The New York Mets and Miami Marlins are set to clash in a late-September NL East skirmish that’s less “World Series preview” and more “two tired teams hoping their coffee hasn’t gone cold.” Let’s break down the numbers, news, and why this game might be best watched with a fire extinguisher for all the hot takes.

---

### Parsing the Odds: The Math of Mayhem

The betting line tells a story of cautious optimism for the Mets (-135) and a “throw it all in” gamble on the Marlins (+113). Converting those to implied probabilities:

* **Mets**: 57.1% chance to win (because math hates underdogs).
* **Marlins**: 47.2% chance to win (because hope springs eternal in South Beach).

The total is set at 8.5 runs, with the **over** priced at \~52% implied probability and the **under** at \~48%. Given that Clay Holmes (Mets’ starter) has allowed zero earned runs in his last two starts and Eury Pérez (Marlins’ starter) has a 4.20 ERA, this feels like a “two pitchers’ duel” with a side of “someone will eventually make an error.”

---

### Pitcher Analysis: Holmes vs. Pérez, or ‘Who’s Less Likely to Trip Over Their Shoelaces?’

* **Clay Holmes (Mets, 3.66 ERA)**: Holmes is the baseball equivalent of a reliable used car—sometimes you question its engine, but it *never* breaks down when it matters. His seven quality starts this season? More like seven “I-just-don’t-care-anymore” performances. With a three-game no-earned-run streak, he’s basically a pitcher-shaped robot programmed to say “not today” to the Marlins’ offense.
* **Eury Pérez (Marlins, 4.20 ERA)**: Pérez is the newer, flashier car that occasionally backfires. His 1.044 WHIP is solid, but his strikeout-to-walk ratio (3.24) suggests he’s more “controlled chaos” than “ace.” If he’s sharp, the Marlins win. If he’s not? Well, his ERA says “4.20” but his Mets’ hitters say “see you at the bar after the game.”

**Edge**: Holmes. The Mets’ starter is a human fortress; Pérez is a fortress with a “Welcome, strangers!” sign.

Looking forward to the next chapter and hoping to meet someone genuine, kind, and fun to share it with. I’m at a place in life where I value laughter, connection, and the simple joys—whether that’s cooking together, exploring new places, or just enjoying good conversation over coffee (or wine).

I appreciate honesty, humor, and a positive outlook, and I’m hoping to meet someone who feels the same. Life’s too short not to laugh often, take chances, and enjoy the little adventures along the way. If that resonates with you, I’d love to hear from you.

1ns0rhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ns0rhx/broke_up_due_to_emotional_connection_effort_fading/,Broke up due to emotional connection/ effort fading,"Hi, this is a bit of a rant but also just looking for some advice.

For context:
My now ex (25F) broke up with me (26M) around a month ago, we had been dating pretty seriously for 18months and lived together for c.6 months of that. I understand that was quite quick to move in but we genuinely had so much love and our connection was so strong for the vast majority of the relationship and would see each other everyday before we moved in together. 

In the 2 or 3 months leading up to the breakup I knew things weren’t great between us but there were a lot of external factors (I thought were causing that) her job was becoming more stressful/ she was missing home/ she had a low-serious health issue but it meant she was constantly in 3-4/10 pain. I think understandably I thought these we the reason she was off with me rather than me.

About 2 weeks before we broke up we had a ‘chat’ were she essentially said she wasn’t enjoying living with me and couldn’t go on like this which was mainly down to my lack of effort, which was fair but it was my first real adult relationship and I think I was struggling with what effort looked like and didn’t really know how to communicate that I was struggling with that. I was 100% doing things to show I cared and was generally fun to be around but in hindsight I was more doing the bigger practical things and missing the simple things like proactively doing things for her eg instead of asking what I could do to help just doing something/ like making her a coffee in the morning / taking 30mins off work to have dinner with her

After we had that chat I really tried to demonstrate that that I was making more effort and doing more things / planning dates ect which she defo noticed but later said I was making more of an effort but not in the areas she needed… but also I would have thought that if I was actively not doing what needed she would have said something but she never did… I think in her mind it was already too far gone and she had just been emotionally shut down for a while

Also I work pretty long hours at my job (like 11/midnight sometimes) and she often finished at 5 so I think there was an aspect that she just felt lonely and a bit neglected in the evenings which is also fair enough but again she didn’t really do that much on her own in the evening after work which I feel might have taken some of that blame away from me? / not made her feel like that

Anyway, 2 weeks after that chat she ended it with me (also feel like 2 weeks isn’t long enough to make any real changes anyway) she was so lovely about it and really kind but basically just said all the factors above  (effort / me not changing) lead to our emotional connection fading (which I did feel too but also thought we can definitely get back) and the relationship just wasn’t right for her anymore. We spoke for around 4h about everything and genuinely felt like we had gotten onto the same page with everything but then we still ended it and it felt like talking really frankly and honestly about everything was exactly what we needed and now we weren’t even going to try… (we’d not really even had an argument before)

She said she still had so much love for me and cared about me so much but it just wasn’t right. I’ve been in NC with her for a month now other than 2 messages sorting out flat bits and basically I’m just asking what should I do / is there a chance we can work it out and get back together?

To reiterate for 15 months the relationship was basically as perfect as it could have been and we were talking about getting married in the future (few years) picking out baby names ect and I know there’s still a lot of feelings on both sides.

I know in the long term I will be fine / find someone else but right now I really don’t want to and it just feels like such a waste to throw it all away, our first real issue and it feels like we’ve fallen at the first hurdle…

Any comments / advice / general thoughts would be really appreciated - i know it’s a process and im taking some time to work on myself but atm my heart is pretty shattered and no contact is so hard - Thank you",1,1758993478.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1ns0raj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1ns0raj/bm_meddling_in_my_marriage/,BM meddling in my marriage,"BM's attempts to interfere with my marriage have been laughable, but frustrating. 

17 minute phone call where BM was on the verge of tears, begging my husband to leave me ""for child's sake""- with bogus accusations about me.

The next day, she conned my husband's dad into letting her know when my husband would be going to his dad's house just so she could go over there at the same time to beg my husband to leave me *in person*.

School orientation was a week later. Bio-kid and stepkid are in the same school. DH requested beforehand that I don't leave him alone with BM due to previous innapropriate behavior/communication. Got it. We planned to visit SK's classroom, then my bio-kid's. BM went into SK's classroom with us, received paperwork that she was supposed to fill out and return on the 1st day of school, sat down, looked right at me and said ""you guys can go do whatever you have to do- **we** have paperwork to fill out""- no one else was filling paperwork out there, they were taking it home. 
Then to get the kids situated for the bus, me, my husband, stepchild, and biological child stood in the transportation line. BM found us, laughed, and told my husband ""you guys dont need to stand in this line, I already got (SK) taken care of for both houses!"". She seemed disappointed when my husband told her we had to stand in the line to get my biological child's transportation needs taken care of as well. 

And after SK's football practice recently (the one time I wasn't present with my husband), she went up to my husband afterwards and said ""I know all about OP. I looked up her records with *all of her names, and I talked to someone who knows her personally from school....so, are you staying with her?"" 
She was poking at the fact that I married and divorced before I met my husband and now have traffic tickets with 3 last names. High school was 10 years ago, and I wasnt even friends with the individual she said she talked to.

She had the nerve to text me afterwards and say ""I talked to (DH) for a while- we should get coffee sometime. It just occured to me that you've been apart of the (DH's last name) family for a year now and we've never sat down together""
I declined her request, and made it known that I was aware of what she said about me. 

The most frustrating part about all of this, is that my husband is not even sticking up for me, putting her in her place, or making it known that she should not be able to talk to him about his wife or marriage. 
I keep hearing ""I will"" or ""I'm going to"" and it's like he's just waiting for her to say more shit about me. ",4,1758993464.0,stepparents,6,0.7,False

1ns0peu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSimpleKenPodcast/comments/1ns0peu/where_is_the_meaning_of_lyfe/,where is the meaning of lyfe,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1ns0nsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MasterPCreviews/comments/1ns0nsd/showcase_the_best_business_laptop_lenovo_v15_and/,Showcase the Best Business Laptop Lenovo V15 and Is It Worth It,"The Lenovo V15 was my latest pick for work and personal use, and having put it through its paces, I feel I have a fair grasp on its strengths and areas needing improvement. As someone frequently juggling multiple tasks and working long hours, I needed a laptop that could keep up with my demands. On paper, the specs of this machine seemed to make it a strong contestant in its segment, particularly with its Intel Celeron N5100 processor and the massive 32GB of RAM. Naturally, I had to see for myself if it really lives up to those promises.

**Sleek Design with a Practical Edge**  
One of the first things you notice about this laptop is its minimalist black chassis. The Lenovo V15 has a lightweight build, tipping the scales at just 3.75 pounds, making it easy to carry between home, the office, and my favorite coffee shop. Its slim profile didn’t go unnoticed either; slipping it into my bag was a breeze. Despite the portability, its matte black finish and sturdy construction give it a reassuring durability that didn’t feel cheap or fragile. The full HD 15.6-inch anti-glare display strikes a fine balance between sharp visuals and reduced reflections, which saved me from unnecessary screen flipping when working near windows.  

**See Lenovo V15’s cost details on Amazon.**

**Performance That Delivers on Everyday Tasks**  
With its Intel Celeron N5100 quad-core processor and integrated Intel UHD Graphics, this laptop handled my daily workload with relative ease. Whether it was running multiple browser tabs, streaming high-definition videos, or thrashing through Excel sheets, the system remained impressively fluid. The jump to 32GB DDR4 RAM isn’t just marketing fluff; it means hungry apps like Photoshop or even video editing software load faster than expected for this price category. At no point did I feel it was lagging for email threads, virtual meetings, or casual gaming sessions. Pairing all that RAM with the 1TB SSD ensures I had generous storage space for my files and quick boot times every morning—it barely took seconds to wake up from sleep mode!  

**Good Aspects**  
- Lightweight and portable design for easy carrying.  
- Generous RAM and SSD storage, ideal for multitasking and file-heavy projects.  
- Full HD anti-glare display offers uninterrupted viewing.  

**Audio and Connectivity Surprises**  
I wasn't expecting Dolby Audio speakers to be this clear and immersive for such a slim frame. Watching shows on Netflix or joining virtual conferences was an absolute pleasure—the sound doesn’t distort unless you crank the volume to the max. Connectivity was another piece Lenovo nailed here. Two USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports, a USB 2.0 port, HDMI 1.4, and even an Ethernet RJ-45 port kept me prepared for every scenario, whether I was connecting to a modern monitor or using wired office networks. The built-in Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 5.1 made for effortless connectivity to my wireless peripherals, freeing up desk clutter while offering stable connections.

**Minus Points**  
- Screen brightness tops out at 250 nits, limiting outdoor usability.  
- No backlit keyboard, making it harder to type in dim lighting.  
- Touchpad tracking could feel a bit less sensitive than expected.

**Battery Life: Above Standard, But Not Groundbreaking**  
The advertised battery life of up to 11.5 hours was tested on multiple occasions during my workflow. While hitting the upper limit depends on turning down the screen brightness and focusing on light tasks, I managed an average of 8-9 hours on heavier days with moderate multitasking. That’s a respectable figure, though not one that significantly outshines its competitors. Thankfully, it charges back reasonably quickly, letting me unplug more often than not.  

**Product Alternatives**  
Comparing this laptop with others in the same price bracket, a leading rival would be Dell Inspiron 15 3000, targeting budget-conscious users with somewhat similar specifications. While Dell might offer slightly better keyboard ergonomics and a marginally brighter screen, Lenovo V15 stands stronger in terms of higher RAM capacity and storage, making it better for multitaskers and professionals handling large datasets. Other contenders like HP 255 G8 Laptops deliver minor refinements in build quality, but again, they often fall short in overall memory and processing capacity.  

**Quality for Price**  
For its feature set, the Lenovo V15 delivers exceptional value without emptying your wallet. If you need a simple, no-nonsense performance machine for office tasks, casual online meetings, or basic multimedia consumption, it’s a solid pick. Some trade-offs, like screen brightness and lack of backlit keys, might inconvenience users who rely on working in varying lighting setups or outdoors. Still, given its hefty RAM and storage combination alongside integrated Dolby Audio, its asking price justifies itself comfortably for office professionals and students alike.

She weighed out 124 grams of coffee creamer, maple syrup, monk fruit and THEN topped it with whipped cream. But it’s soo amazing and is going to put her in ketosis. She also claims that oat creamer is healthier and fewer calories than regular coffee creamer. Possibly- but not the one she uses. She literally read the label on camera and said it’s 35 calories per serving. That is the same as regular coffee creamer! She goes on to weigh out a boatload, preach about tracking macros and knowing what’s in your food and then acts clueless about how much 124 GRAMS of coffee creamer adds up to. That is 41 grams of carbs alone, or about 280 CALORIES just in the creamer. Not counting the other 3 kinds of sugar she put in. And of course because there’s keto coffee something or other in it it’s fine and is still going to burn all her fat 🤡 and people are asking for her stupid coffee product.

The memories keep slipping through. They tell me it wasn’t real. That I imagined it. But I know what happened. I need to tell someone before I forget again. I’ll recount everything as it’s still clear in my head. 

I awoke with a jolt, lurching upright in bed, gasping for air as if I had just surfaced from drowning. My chest heaved, my fingers clutched at the soft sheets beneath me- smoother, softer than anything I had ever slept on before. My head was spinning. The scent of fresh pine drifted through the air, carried by a cool spring breeze that rustled the white curtains. Sunlight streamed in, flooding the rustic wooden room with a warm glow.

I sat there, frozen, trying to piece together what had happened. The ship. The storm. Claire.  Wyatt. Theron. Was I dead?

A creak at the door made me snap my head toward it. A man stepped inside with gentle movements, his face kind yet unfamiliar. He had dark hair, streaked with gray at the temples, and deep-set wrinkles that framed his kind, smile. His eyes were blue and bright and gleamed as he spoke.

""Good morning, Elliot,"" he said, crossing the room and settling onto the bed beside me. His hand reached out, warm and steady, rubbing my back like a father comforting a restless child.

I flinched away. ""Who are you?"" My voice was hoarse. ""How do you know my name?""

He chuckled a warm, pleasant sound. ""I'm your father, of course. Why wouldn’t I know your name?""

My father? No. That wasn’t right. My father worked on a ship. My father smelled of oil and salt, not like… chocolate.

""Father?"" I repeated my voice barely above a whisper. ""What is this? What’s happening? Am I dead? Are you God?""

His laughter came again, lighthearted but strangely dismissive. ""That dream really shook you up, didn’t it?"" He patted my shoulder. ""Come on, let’s get you some breakfast. Your mother’s making French toast.""

I didn’t move. ""I’m not going anywhere until you tell me what’s going on.""

The man sighed, still smiling, but there was something behind his expression now, something unreadable. ""I already told you, son. I’m your dad. Now, come eat before your food gets cold.""

My thoughts raced. Everything in me screamed that something was wrong, but my stomach betrayed me, I was starving. Hesitantly, I slid out of bed and followed him into the hall.

The cabin stretched long, lined with identical wooden doors. As we walked, we reached a staircase leading down to a grand entryway. A massive antler chandelier hung from the ceiling, casting long shadows across a red-carpeted floor. The scent of cinnamon grew stronger.

We passed through a set of double doors into a wide room that resembled a strange market stall, rows upon rows of glass vials lining a long station that sat in the center of the room. They contained liquid in shifting colors, starting deep brown on one end and transitioning into vibrant hues as they progressed toward the right. I wanted to ask what they were, but something about them made me keep silent.

We kept walking until we entered what looked like a rustic diner. Booths lined the walls, and wooden tables filled the space. The scent of warm syrup and French toast filled the air. The moment we stepped inside, the entire room fell silent.

Every person- men, women, and children, turned toward us in sync. They stared at us, their faces blank. Then they all spoke in unison.

""Good morning, Dad!""

Then, just as quickly, they turned back to their meals, carrying on as if nothing had happened. I felt my stomach twist with unease.

The man led me to an empty table and sat down across from me. A woman soon approached, carrying two plates. She looked older than him, her face deeply lined, her curly blonde hair pulled into a loose bun. She set down our breakfast of scrambled eggs, and golden French toast before pouring me a glass of orange juice.

“OJ as usual,” She said with a smile before turning to the man sitting in front of me. How’d she know orange juice was my favorite? My mind ached almost as much as my stomach. 

""Coffee, Dad?"" she asked, her voice sweet but flat.

""Black, as usual,"" the man replied, cutting into his food.

I reached for my fork, eager to eat and push aside the anxiety in my chest, but before I could take a bite, his hand shot out, stopping me.

""Ah, ah, ah. Not yet, Elliot."" His fingers curled firmly around my wrist. ""You haven’t said good morning to Dad yet.""

His voice was light, but his grip was firm. Too firm. His blue eyes locked onto mine.

I hesitated, my stomach twisting with hunger and discomfort. 

I swallowed hard. ""...Good morning, Dad.""

His grip loosened. He beamed. ""Atta boy."" He went back to his food. ""That’s what Dad likes to see. Obedient children are good children.""

I clenched my fork, forcing myself to eat despite my sudden loss of appetite. After a few bites, I couldn’t help but speak.

""You’re not my father.""

The man’s smile didn’t waver, but he stopped chewing. He tilted his head slightly. ""What was that?""

I swallowed. ""You’re not my father."" This time, I said it louder. ""My father works on a ship. He’s a mechanic. He’s the kindest man you’ll ever meet.""

The man sighed, shaking his head. ""I don’t know what you’re talking about, Elliot."" His voice was still gentle, but it carried a cold undertone. ""You must still be confused. You seem to be having trouble knowing what’s real… and what’s just a dream.""

The fork in my hand trembled. My pulse pounded in my ears. I didn’t know where I was. I didn’t know who these people were, and I wasn’t sure if I had ever known them at all.

I ate in silence, forcing each bite past the lump in my throat. The food was good, perfect, even, but there was something off about it. Every flavor was heightened, exaggerated, like a memory of breakfast rather than the real thing. The man across from me, Dad, ate without another word, his demeanor, unbothered, as if my outburst had never happened. The woman, Mom, moved around the dining hall, tending to others with the same soft expression. The people at the tables spoke in quiet murmurs, laughter occasionally popping through the room.

I kept my head down. I didn’t want to meet anyone's eyes. Then, from the corner of my vision, I saw them.

Two children sat in a booth near the far wall, watching me. A thin, dark-skinned girl with braided hair and hollow cheeks, and beside her, a pale, bald boy with soft features and large, glassy eyes. They were younger than me, maybe ten or eleven, but something about them felt old. When they saw my eyes meet theirs they quickly looked away going back to their food,  shoveling it into their mouths. I looked away quickly.

The moment breakfast ended, Dad clapped his hands together. ""Alright, kiddo, let’s get you back to bed. You’ve had a rough morning. Why don’t you head to your room and rest a bit longer? I’ll have Mom check on you once we’re done cleaning up from breakfast.""

He got up, gathered our plates, and carried them to the kitchen, leaving me sitting there alone.

I didn’t know what to do. Should I try to run to the front door and leave? What were all those vials? Should I ask someone, anyone, what was happening? My mind spiraled with questions, each one leading to another. But despite everything, a deep feeling inside made me feel like I should listen to Dad.

I got up from the table and walked through the dining hall and back into the main hallway. People greeted me as I passed saying ""Good morning, Elliot!"", but I ignored them. I just kept walking, my feet carrying me back upstairs, back to my room. The scent of pine and damp cloth lingered in the air. It felt familiar now, nostalgic.

When I reached my room, it was exactly as I had left it. The walk had felt natural- as if I’d done it a million times before.

I sat down, inhaling the familiar scent of the room, but something itched at the edge of my mind. I turned to the window and froze.

Beyond the glass stretched an endless ocean. A vast, rolling sea, glistening under a perfect blue sky. My stomach dropped. The ship. My family. My real family. My friends. How had I forgotten them? How had I let them slip away so easily?

I gripped the windowsill, my breath coming in shallow gasps. I thought about climbing through the window, running across the grass, into the sand, and down to the water. Maybe if I reached the ocean, I’d remember everything. Maybe I’d wake up. 

But I stayed. I stayed, trapped in a body that didn’t feel like my own. My mind spiraled further out of control. I crawled back into bed and wept, burying my face in the pillows, sobbing until my chest ached. Until I felt empty. A soft knock at the door startled me.

“Elliot?” A woman’s voice.

I wiped my face and swallowed the lump in my throat. ""Come in.""

The woman from the dining hall entered, Mom.

""Oh, baby, what’s the matter?"" she asked, a worried look spreading across her face as she hurried over and knelt beside my bed.

“I’m just so confused,” I choked out between sobs. “I don’t know what’s real or what’s not, or what’s happening. I don’t know you.”

I covered my face with my hands, shaking.

She wrapped her arms around me, pulling me close. Her warmth seeped into my skin, comforting me. ""Oh, sweetheart,"" she cooed, stroking my hair. ""Of course you know who I am. I’m your mom, honey.""

I clung to her, my sobs quieting as my breathing settled.

""You just had a bad dream, baby,"" she murmured, rocking me gently. ""It’s all over now. Mommy’s here.""

She held me for a long time until my trembling stopped and my mind felt lighter, as if she had smoothed over the edges of my thoughts.

“Sorry, Mom,” I mumbled, rubbing my eyes.

""It’s okay, sweetie. Dreams can be scary. But you’re here now. You’re home now, with your family.""

She smiled, rubbing my back. ""Why don’t you rest? Put on a movie.""

She stood and walked over to the TV in the corner of the room, turning it on.

""Pick something you like,"" she said. ""You can come down for lunch whenever you’re feeling up to it.""

“Lunch?” I asked looking at her confused. “But we just ate breakfast.” 

She chuckled softly, “Elliot, you’ve been up here for hours, don’t be silly.” I felt an emptiness consume me as I heard her words. Hours? I swear I’d just gotten up here.

“Get some rest now honey, you look exhausted.” She said in a warm tone as she quietly closed the door.

I pushed the worry out of my head, lifting myself up from the bed. I walked to the cabinet beneath the TV. I opened it and pulled out a box of DVDs.

Inside were all the classics: Terminator 2, Rambo, Predator, Back to the Future 1 and 3, you name it. 

My fingers hesitated over the case. How did they know? I loved old 80s movies. I grabbed The Return of Godzilla and threw it into the DVD player. Settling into my bed and watching the movie. 

As the movie started, the familiar grainy opening sequence filled the screen. The low hum of the soundtrack vibrated through the room, grounding me to something real, something mine.
I pulled the blanket over my shoulders and let the film play, but my mind drifted.

How did they know?

How did they know these were my favorites? How did they know I always skipped Back to the Future 2? 

I tried to shake the thought, trying to focus on what was happening on screen.

I saw the ocean. The submarine.
A deep unease stirred in me, something beyond the film.

The ocean. The ship.

My father. My real father.

The air in my room suddenly felt heavier, like the walls were pressing in. I gripped the blanket tighter.

Then I heard a soft creak. Not from the movie. From inside the room. Slowly, I turned my head toward the door. It was open- just a crack. Someone was standing there. Two figures small and motionless.

The thin, girl, her expression blank stood beside the pale, bald boy from the diner earlier. They didn’t say anything. They just watched.

I shivered with discomfort.

I spoke softly, “Can I help you?”

The girl tilted her head slightly. The boy blinked, his face unreadable. Then, in perfect unison, they turned and walked away, disappearing into the dimly lit hallway.

I sat up, my heartbeat hammering in my chest. I should stay in my room. I should. But something inside me refused.

 I threw off the blanket and climbed out of bed, stepping carefully toward the door. The hallway was quiet, the scent of old wood stronger than before. The warm glow from the wall lights flickered slightly, like a candle in a draft.

I peeked out, looking down the hall. The two children were just ahead, turning a corner.
Without thinking, I followed. I stepped into the hallway, my bare feet sinking into the plush carpet. The air was still, the only sound was the faint noise from the TV behind me, muffled as I pulled the door shut.

I quickened my pace, careful to keep quiet. As I rounded the bend, I caught sight of them at the far end of the hall. They stood in front of a door. It looked like any other room in the cabin however simply looking at it, staring down that hall made my skin crawl. The girl pressed her small hand against the knob but didn’t turn it. The boy just stood there, staring at the wood as if he could see through it. I stopped, keeping my distance. 

“Why are you watching me? What’s in there?” I asked anxiously. 

They didn’t react right away. Then, the girl turned her head just enough to glance at me over her shoulder. Her eyes, deep and dark, didn’t hold any malice, just curiosity.

“You don’t remember?” she asked.

Her voice was quiet and unsettling.

The boy finally turned to face me. “You shouldn’t be here,” he said dryly.

“I live here,” I muttered, though the words felt wrong in my mouth.

The girl gave a small smile. “Do you?”

I didn’t know how to respond.

The boy took a step forward. “Go back to your room, Elliot.”

It wasn’t a threat, but it wasn’t a request either. I wanted to listen. I should listen, but my eyes flickered back to the door. Something inside me screamed that I needed to know what was behind it.

I swallowed hard. “What’s in there?” I asked again.

The girl turned fully now, watching me carefully. “You already asked that.”

I hesitated, stepping closer. “And you didn’t answer.”

The boy frowned, glancing at me before looking at the girl. “He’s not ready.”

My fingers twitched at my sides. Before I could say anything else, the girl reached for the knob and turned it.

“Elliot.”

A voice cut through the silence.

I spun around.

Dad stood at the other end of the hallway, his expression calm but defiant. “Get away from there.”

I hesitated. The girl and boy didn’t move, didn’t even look at him.

Dad took a step closer, his smile tight. “Now, son.”

I looked back at the door.

“Elliot get over here now!” Dad spoke in a loud voice

The command hit me like a slap, and for a moment, I froze. His words echoed in my head. The door seemed to pulse, calling me back, begging me to step closer. But Dad’s voice cut through the invisible force pulling me there.

I turned fully to face him. His eyes bore into mine, and the smile on his face had shifted, no longer kind but instead cold and tense. The urge to move toward the door battled with the fear that crept up my spine.

I steadied myself. ""What’s behind that door?"" I asked, my voice shaking slightly, out of frustration and fear.

Dad’s jaw clenched. “Don’t ask about things you don’t understand, Elliot.”

He took another step forward, his presence filling the narrow hallway like a wall. The hall seemed to tighten just slightly. It was suffocating, but I couldn’t escape the door, something was hidden behind it.

The girl’s voice broke the silence, soft, as if she was speaking to herself. “You’ll forget,” she said quietly. “You’ll forget everything.”

The boy spoke, his tone flat. “You’re not ready to remember.”

I felt my chest tighten. “What do you mean, not ready?” My words slipping out before I could stop them.

Dad stepped forward again, stretching out his hand trying to reassure me, but only made me feel smaller. ""Come with me, Elliot,"" he said, his voice softer now but still insistent. ""Let’s get you back to your room.”

I glanced at the door one last time. There was something there I couldn’t name. I could almost feel it in my bones, like a whisper just beyond the reach of my understanding.

With a final glance at the children, whose expressions hadn't changed at all, I turned toward Dad and moved back down the hall. The air felt different now, less suffocating but still hanging with tension. 

As we reached the top of the stairs, Dad placed a hand on my shoulder. ""You don't need to know everything right now,"" he said, his voice low. “Everything will make sense when the time is right.”

I nodded, but inside, my mind raced, questions swirling around the edges of my thoughts. What was it that I wasn’t ready to understand? What was up with those two? What was behind that door?

“Who are they, Dad?” I asked, following him back to my room.

“Anthozoa and Erinaceus?” he asked, sounding a little surprised I didn’t know. “Your brother and sister, of course. Those two are always getting into trouble.” He shook his head with a smile. “I’ll see to it that they get a stern talking to.”

I didn’t say anything else as I followed him down the hall. Something didn’t sit right about the way he spoke about them. Brother and sister? They didn’t look anything like me, not even close. But Dad’s words reverberated in my mind, and I let it go, trying to push the confusion to the back of my thoughts.

 They’re family.

The next days, weeks, or months passed. I couldn’t tell how long time went on. Time seemed to stretch endlessly, slipping through my fingers like sand. The mornings blurred together, one breakfast after another, the same routine, the same faces. At some point, I stopped counting the days. I woke up, ate, watched TV or read. I didn’t leave my room much. No one really came to check on me anymore. Mom, Dad, and the other adults were busy with... something. I wasn’t sure what. I would spend some of my time with my siblings, spending time in the glass-breaking room, where we would destroy vials, flasks, and other small glass items with hammers and similar tools. We’d also play video games, build puzzles, and other activities. 

I tried to remember bits and pieces of my past, faces, places, and fragments of my life before. But the harder I tried, the foggier it became. Why did I feel like there was something I was supposed to know? My old life felt so far away, like a dream that was slipping through my consciousness, out of reach. I didn’t have an old life. This was my old life. 

I’d occasionally see Anthozoa and Erinaceus. Each time it happened it would cause my stomach to sink. I never spent time with them as they would always put me in an unease. They would always be playing or talking together, their odd smiles never quite leaving their faces. They were always together, never apart. Maybe it’s normal, I thought, siblings stick together. But something about their presence felt off, like they were waiting for something to happen, something they were a part of that I couldn’t understand.

I never went back to the room, the one that made me feel so uncomfortable. Dad knew best. If I wasn’t meant to go in there then I wouldn’t. 

My biggest peeve in my day to day was going to the bathroom. The room was located on the first floor and down the hall in the opposite direction of the diner. The bathroom appeared like any other bathroom you’d find in a lodge, however, the exterior wall was entirely glass. You could see that the lodge sat on a peninsula as the ocean stretched out from all sides. The peninsula arched off into the distance out of view, beautiful lush, and green surrounded by sandy beaches and crystal blue sea. It never rained, it never stormed.

 Storm… the sea, I hated the sea. I couldn’t stand to look out the window. It made me ache. 

There were more lodges across the green. I would see figures moving outside them sometimes. I never went outside. It’s not that I couldn’t, my siblings went swimming often, but I was just ok with staying inside. Leaving? Oh god just the thought made me want to shrink up and cry. 

One afternoon, after years that felt like days of routine, Dad finally approached me.

“Elliot, we’ve got something new for you to learn,” he said, his voice calm, but there was an edge to it now. “It’s time for you to start learning how we make the vials.”

I had seen the vials many times before- rows and rows of them, lined up in the strange market booth-like area. But I hadn’t given them much thought until now. Curiosity stirred within me.

I followed Dad down the same hallway I had walked through so many times, but this time, I was hyper-aware of every step, every creak of the floor beneath us. We entered the central room beyond the lobby where the vials lay.

The room was dimly lit, the air filled with the scent of something unfamiliar. In the center of the room stood the station, covered with vials lined up neatly in rows. Some were empty, others half-filled with different colored liquids that seemed to shimmer in the low light.

“This is where it all happens,” Dad said, his voice low and reverent. He motioned for me to come closer. “You’ll learn to make them yourself. The vials are important, Elliot. You’ll understand why soon enough.”

I stood there, my mind swirling with confusion and curiosity, but mostly with a deep, unsettling feeling. Something was off about all of this. Something was wrong.

Dad handed me a small vial, its contents a murky brown liquid. “This, my son, is what you don’t want.” He opened it, taking a swig. “Delicious, but useless,” he said, handing it to me. “Drink, don’t be afraid.”

I held the vial in my hands, my fingers trembling. The brown liquid was thick and flaky. I touched my lips to the edge of the vial and poured the contents into my mouth. It tasted sweet, like melted chocolate mixed with the greatest piece of fruit you’d ever bitten into.

“That is good,” I said, smiling. He smiled back. “Why don’t we drink these more often?” I asked, grabbing another one from the shelf.

“Because, my child, that would be a waste.” He motioned to the gradient of vials, pointing at the brightly colored bottles. “The liquid can be turned back into what we need, what we use. Let me show you.”

He took the brown liquid from my hands and opened a cabinet beneath the station, revealing rows of small flasks. “Pick one,” he said, motioning to the array.

I knelt down and looked at the containers, each one labeled with a different animal. I grabbed one labeled “duck.”

“Good choice,” he said as I stood. “Now pour that into the vial I’m holding,” he instructed.

I opened the flask, and as I did so, the sound of a quack whispered from the bottle. I jumped slightly, and Dad let out a chuckle.

“Don’t be afraid. Now, pour.”

I poured the flask into the vial. Pink smoke flowed into the flask, swirling with the brown liquid. As it touched the substance, it slowly began to change, turning into a bright pink, clear fluid, similar to the smoke. Once all the liquid was pink, I closed the flask back up and put it away.

“Look at that,” Dad said with a smile. “You actually did it,” He said shaking his head. He swirled the vial around a bit and placed it back on the shelf. “I wasn’t worried one bit. I knew you were ready. I can always tell.”

“Ready for what?” I asked.

“To make vials, that’s what. All you need to know is that you can do it now. You’re not ready to know everything yet, child. Just trust your father.”

He patted me on the back as we walked out. 

“I’m so proud of you, Elliot. You’re making the whole family proud.” He ruffled my hair a bit, “Now, I’ve got to get back to work, sport.” He spoke as he walked away from the room, leaving me standing there.

 I turned away from the room and walked toward the lobby, the soft sound of my footsteps echoing loudly in the silence. Dad’s words still lingered in my ears: Trust your father. He’d said it so many times before. Yet, this time, it felt different. This time, I wasn’t so sure.

As I passed through the grand entryway, I caught a glimpse of Anthozoa and Erinaceus. They stood in the shadow of the stairwell, watching me. Their faces were expressionless, but there was something in the way they looked at me that made my stomach tighten. I tried to ignore them, but they didn’t break eye contact. It unnerved me. As we kept staring I suddenly felt my mind break. I grabbed my head as I felt it begin to ache. A sharp, stabbing pain pulsed through my skull, spreading like wildfire. My hands shook as I dug my nails into my scalp, trying to steady myself.

I felt cold, my skin prickling as if I were submerged in icy water. My heart raced, and the world around me began to warp. The walls of the hallway dissolved into mist, and suddenly, I was no longer in the house. The sharp scent of saltwater filled my nostrils. I looked around, and the hall was gone- replaced by the blinding flashes of lightning and the relentless crash of waves.

I was on a ship. The sound was overwhelming. The wind howled like an animal, pushing against me with force. The rain pelted me like bullets, stinging my skin, the cold water soaking me to the bone. My clothes clung to me, heavy with the weight of the storm. The ship creaked and groaned beneath me, the deck slick with water as I staggered to my feet, struggling to stay upright.

I felt my heart pounding, the adrenaline coursing through my veins. I couldn’t make sense of any of it. I was in the middle of a storm, a storm that felt real. My legs gave out beneath me, and I collapsed to the deck, gasping for air, clutching at the wet wood as though it could anchor me to something solid.

The cold water covered my body, my chest tightening as I gasped for breath, my heart racing in panic. The sound of the storm consumed me, a deafening roar in my ears. I crumpled on the ground, shivering, unable to understand why I was there or what was happening. I wanted to scream, to call out for help, but my voice was lost in the chaos.

Then, as if the storm itself had swallowed me whole, everything vanished. In the blink of an eye, I was back. My chest heaved, my breath ragged as I lay on the cold floor of the hallway. The world felt distorted as if I had just woken from a nightmare, but the lingering sensation of the storm still clung to me. I blinked, trying to steady myself.

I looked up. Anthozoa and Erinaceus stood over me, their eyes cold and unblinking. The hallway was still and, unchanged, but the air felt heavier, charged with something I couldn’t explain.

My head throbbed. The pain was dull now, but the disorienting feeling lingered. My hand trembled as I reached up to touch my face expecting to feel rainwater, but there was nothing.

“Follow us quickly, Elliot!” Anthozoa’s voice urgently broke through the haze in my mind.

I stared at her, unable to move for a moment. My mind felt fragmented as if parts of it were still lost somewhere in the storm I had just experienced. My hand hung in the air, trembling, the wetness on my skin no longer there, leaving only the sting of cold on my fingertips.

Erinaceus didn't say anything. He just stood there, his gaze steady and unwavering, as if waiting for something.

“Now, Elliot!” Anthozoa’s voice snapped, more forceful this time, pulling me from my paralysis.

I stumbled to my feet, my legs shaky, my head still reeling from the vision. It felt like something was slipping from me, like I was losing hold of myself, losing pieces of who I was. I wanted to question them, ask them what was happening, but the words caught in my throat. I was too afraid to speak, too afraid of what they might say or what might happen if I didn’t do as they said. 

I followed them. Anthozoa and Erinaceus didn’t speak, their feet gliding effortlessly across the floor. I could barely make out  their soft footsteps against the carpet as we climbed the central stairs, the steps creaked as we ascended. I glanced behind me, unsure if I had the courage to go further, but the pressure of their presence pushed me forward. We reached the landing at the top of the stairs, and as I followed them, we turned sharply to the left. My breath caught in my throat as I saw the door at the end of the hallway, my memory flickered, and I realized this was the same room from before, the one that had felt so wrong when I had come to it earlier.

The air was cold, and the walls pulsed with a quiet, hidden menace. The door loomed ahead, and my feet felt heavy. Anthozoa and Erinaceus didn’t wait for me to gather my thoughts. They simply opened the door, and with a gentle push, I was ushered inside.

The room was a void of black. An endless hallway that stretched far beyond my sight in either direction. The walls were lined with old arcade machines, each one glowing with a strange, unnatural light that cast long, shifting shadows across the space. 

“What is this place?” I asked, my voice trembling as I looked back at the two children. Their cold eyes were locked on me, unblinking, unfeeling.

“Remember, Elliot,” they spoke in unison, their voices a strange blend of desperation and command. The words seemed to vibrate in the air, hanging like a weight.

“Remember!” they repeated, louder this time. The urgency in their voices sent a shiver down my spine. I couldn’t grasp it no matter how hard I tried.

“You must remember, Elliot,” they said together.

“Play,” Erinaceus spoke, his finger pointing toward the nearest machine. I felt a deep, gnawing fear coil in my gut. I wanted to run, to turn and flee, but my body wouldn’t obey. It felt as though the room itself was pulling me toward the machines.

“I don’t want to, please, can we leave?” My voice cracked as I pleaded, my heart pounding in my chest, my hands shaking at my sides. I could feel the cold sweat trickling down my back.

“You must play, Elliot,” Erinaceus repeated, his voice even colder this time.

“We are running out of time,” Anthozoa spoke, She pointed toward the machine again, and her gaze bore into me urging me, begging me, demanding me. “Play.”

I felt trapped. There was no way out. Slowly, I turned, walking toward the machine, each step dragging me closer to something I couldn’t comprehend. As I neared it, the screen flickered and the words “Hello, Elliot!” appeared across the display in bold, cheerful letters.

My heart raced in my chest as I stared at the screen. The image changed. It was a beach, beautiful and serene, the sand stretching out in all directions, the waves gently lapping at the shore. A message flashed across the screen: “Start.”

I sat there, my body trembling. I didn’t want to do this, but I felt a force, something unseen but undeniable, pushing me forward. The screen seemed to pull me in, beckoning me to click the start button.

My hand shook as I reached for it and with a shaky breath, I pressed the button. The world around me seemed to blur, the room fading into the distance as the game swallowed me whole. 

I found myself on a beach. The sky was dark, no moon or stars hung above, casting everything in an inky blackness. The ocean lapped at the shore quietly and calmly, as though even the ocean understood it was night. Standing on the shore, I saw three figures, small children. They stood there in the darkness, motionless, staring at me.

I walked toward them slowly at first, my body moving with hesitation. Soon, an inexplicable urgency took over. My pace quickened, and I found myself running, sprinting toward them, my heart pounding in my chest. The beach seemed to stretch infinitely as I ran, the shore pulling away from me with each step.

My feet began to ache, and my legs grew heavier, but I couldn’t stop. I kept running, the sound of my feet pounding into the sand echoing in my ears. The beach, endless and unyielding, continued to stretch out before me. I felt my breath quicken, and soon tears welled up in my eyes. The wind picked up, howling through the night, and though the sky remained clear, I could hear the distant rumblings of a storm. The waves crashed harder against the shore, and thunder boomed from some unseen place.

I heard the sound of metal creaking, the ocean’s water twisting into machines I couldn’t see. My heart raced as I cried out, “Come back!” My voice broke, “I can’t lose you, please!” The words hung in the air, distorted by the unnatural noise surrounding me.

Then, I heard it. A voice. It was faint at first, barely a whisper, but it grew louder. “Elliot!” The voice echoed in my ears, sharp and desperate.

“Elliot!” The voice was screaming now.

I turned around, my heart skipping a beat. There, standing at the edge of the beach where the sand met the grass, was Dad. The glow of the cabin behind him bathed him in soft light, casting long shadows across the ground.

“Come back here right now, son!” His voice was filled with a strange intensity. “You should not be out here so late.”

I froze the weight of his words pressing against me. The figures on the beach and the storm had gone, only Dad’s voice remained, cutting through the chaos. He was real. He was here.

""I’ve had enough of this foolishness, boy. Obedient children are good children."" 

With that, he snapped his fingers, and suddenly, I was back in the lobby of the cabin. Dad stood next to me, wearing a long cloak that covered his face with a hood.

In front of me, the inhabitants of the cabin stood in a massive circle around the outer edges of the lobby. Hundreds of cloaked figures, their robes hiding their faces, surrounded the room. The two staircases and the hall above were filled with people, turning the main entrance into an arena.

“Come, child, it is time,” he spoke, his voice firm, leading me through the crowd of hooded figures. The heavy silence surrounded me as I walked, feeling their eyes on me, though I couldn’t see their faces.

As I broke through the crowd, I finally saw what they encircled. In the center, lying on the red carpet, was Anthozoa. She lay crumpled on the floor, her face pale, sickly, her body trembling.

Sorry it's kinda long. Me (21F) and my bf (21M) have been dating for almost a 1.5 years and are currently living together with his mom while we look for a place together. 

In highschool, he was had a short relationship with a girl (in which they had sex), but this ended after she physically assaulted him. Their last conversation was him telling her to never contact him again. Now, they both work in the same field and she attends the same uni as both of us. She reached out to him yesterday saying she saw him on campus. He told me this morning (a day after she texted him), and showed me how he didn't respond to her. 

I have trust in my relationship, but I told him it would make me feel more comfortable if she blocked him, as this is a boundary of mine. He was against this and said that he cannot block her because they may end up working together in the future, and it will burn a bridge. (Although he is basically just guessing this, since he has no way of knowing they will work together). 

This caused an argument where I told him I don't want to have to tell him what to do, I am just expressing my boundaries. He wants to compromise on this boundary, but I told him I will not. (Past relationships I have compromised my boundaries, and I hated myself, I told myself to never do that for a man again) 

This is kind of a pattern for him since he has another friend (that he had sex with) who messages him every now and then (maybe every 5 months?). He answered her once that he would love to meet up and have coffee to catch up, then replied like an hour later saying he had a gf. I've said the same thing about me wanting him to block her (because it is obvious she only messages him to hook up. AND she knows he's in a relationship). But he will not block her, and claims they are basically life long friends. Now when she messages he doesn't respond. But today he expressed that he was upset with me that he lost a friend because I told him he can't respond to her. (DUH)

Am I overreacting in wanting him to block 'friends' like these? ",2,1758992855.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

1ns0fn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/1ns0fn5/looking_for_friends/,Looking for friends…,"This is kind of a long shot, but here goes. 

I, (M 26), have lived in Saint John my whole life. In my teen years, I had plenty of friends. Life was great. As I grew older, I had 2 kids, and started working full time. Suddenly, fun time became less and less frequent, and in turn, a lot of people I considered to be my friends, dropped off the face of the earth, as to be expected. 

Fast forward to today, me, and the mother of my children split a while ago. And since, I’ve been focused on mainly my kids, and work. I work from home, a condensed shift, so I work 4 days a week, 10 hour shifts, with 3 days off. With the realization that my oldest is going to be starting school next year, and realizing how much I rely on them in terms of socializing and getting out to do things, I realized I don’t really have many consistent friends. 

I have a couple of friends I might chat with on occasion, but beyond my little ones, and my direct family, I don’t have much going on. It’s started to hit pretty hard these past few weeks especially. I miss the idea of having a friend, or a couple of friends I can just chat with. That show interest in communicating with me. We don’t necessarily need to talk 24/7. But just chat when we can, maybe meet up for a coffee, a drink, or just hangout and listen to music, go on hikes over at rockwood, etc. stuff like that. 

I’d like to think I’m a pretty nice person. I’m very, very accepting of people and their flaws/differences, making me the furthest thing from judgemental. I’m into stuff like Music, Video games, Amateur photography, Nature, and plenty of other random and obscure things. 

I’m not sure if anyone else on here feels similarly, or, is open to sprouting a new friendship, but if this catches anyone’s attention, please, feel free to message, or leave a comment. I find I click the best with people somewhat close in age, but really, I can be friends with anyone. And for those who aren’t, thank you for taking the time to read this far, and I hope you have a good rest of your day!",12,1758992684.0,SaintJohnNB,2,0.93,False
1ns0fk2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ns0fk2,Strangers are kinder than people you actually know!,"I still don’t get why strangers are often nicer than people you actually know in real life. Like, I shared a mirror selfie on my Insta story and got a reply from someone saying, “You’ll look good if you get slim.” Like… seriously? I know how I look! it’s literally a mirror pic. People like me who already struggle with insecurities are just trying to build confidence, and then comments like this just knock it down.

I attached two replies I got: one from a stranger that actually made me smile, and another from someone I know that made me think, “Why do they even say this?” But I end up faking my reactions because I don’t want to start arguments I’ll have to face these people later anyway.

(For context, it was in Malayalam. Basically, he asked me if I got slim, I said it’s just the outfit, and then he replied that I’ll look good if I get slim.)

I don’t know, man… I’ve been hearing this crap since lockdown. I used to be slim, but with my current lifestyle, it’s hard to maintain that. The thing is…I’m actually healthy. I don’t eat junk, maybe one coffee with sugar a day, mostly no sugar otherwise, and I rarely smoke or drink. I even go to the gym! But it still feels so frustrating, and here I am replying like a clown just to keep the peace.

And don’t get me started on relatives, they’re the worst. They’ll comment on my body, my face, my skin color… like they’re all supermodels. This is honestly one of the main reasons I avoid gatherings and family functions. I’m just so tired of hearing it all the time.

Sorry, just needed to rant this out.

After months of late nights, backtesting marathons, and more cups of coffee than I’d like to admit, I finally finished building my own automated trading system—an Expert Advisor (EA) for MT5 that I call **Nexora**.

I wanted to share the full story, what the EA actually does, and some key lessons I picked up along the way. Even if you never use my bot, I hope this helps anyone interested in designing or refining their own algo.

# 1. The Core Idea

I’ve always been drawn to mechanical strategies that remove the “emotional” part of trading. Nexora is designed to trade **major forex pairs** using a blend of trend-following and short-term mean-reversion filters.  
Key points:

* Uses multiple time-frame analysis to avoid chasing noise
* Confirms entries with both price-action patterns and volatility filters
* Adjustable risk parameters (lot size, stop/target ratio, trailing options)

Everything is **fully configurable** inside MT5—you can tweak risk per trade, timeframe preferences, or switch certain filters on/off without touching the code.

# 2. Backtesting & Live Trials

I tested the EA across **5+ years of historical data** with variable spread and slippage modeling.  
Highlights:

* Consistent equity growth on EUR/USD and XAU/USD
* Average monthly drawdown in backtests: under 8%
* Sharpe ratio above 1.4 across multiple market conditions

I’ve also been running it on a **small live account** for the past couple of months. While past performance isn’t a guarantee of future results, the live stats have been very close to the backtests—something I’m honestly proud of.

# 3. What I Learned Building It

* **Data quality is everything.** Poor tick data can make any EA look better than it really is.
* **Simplicity wins.** Early versions had dozens of indicators; the final version relies on just a few carefully combined signals.
* **Risk management matters more than entry rules.** Fine-tuning position sizing and drawdown controls made the biggest impact.

# 4. Why I’m Sharing This

I know many traders here have built (or tried to build) their own bots. I’d love feedback—anything from critique of the logic to suggestions for stress testing.

If you’re curious about Nexora’s performance or want to discuss the code logic, drop your thoughts or questions below.  
*(Mods: I’m not spamming or trying to break rules—just sharing the project and the lessons learned. If there’s a better flair or format, let me know.)*

Building Nexora has been one of the most challenging but rewarding projects I’ve ever tackled. Even if you never touch this EA, I hope my takeaways help you in your own algo-trading journey. (if your interested for Nexora and want to buy and you cant see the link just kindly dm me)

Happy trading,

The vet gave me a mixture of ivermectin and propylene glycol to be given to them once a day for 10 days orally. I also had to deep clean their cage everyday for all 10 days. I downgraded for the most part taking all wooden and plastic items out completly, deep cleaning them with bleach first then vinegar, and baking wooden items after drying. the only things in the cage were 4-5 small cardboard boxes, mats for the bottom of the cages, a lot of brown paper and toilet paper, I would make a new boredom breaker/toy out of cardboard/coffee filters/paper cups and treats everyday to make up for the lack of stuff in their cage, and their wheel also due to lack of stuff in their cage. every other day I was able to put a hammock into their cage as well. everyday since starting the medication I cleaned everything out, replaced everything with completely new stuff, I would wipe the whole cage down with bleach and then vinegar and vacuumed under and around the cage. I cleaned all fabric pieces in bleach then vinegar in the washer and then dried on high heat as needed. I also gave all 5 girls their medicine everyday (it was not easy at all lol.) but even tho I did all of this I think my girls are still itchy, I can also see ehat I think are the eggs on their fur. I did some research on rat lice and I read that their eggs looks like dead skin or dandruff stuck to the fur strands and I was able to see quite a lot of it when first starting medication. there is a lot less now after the 10 days but I still see a few and they are occasionally still itching themselves. my vet said if they were not better by the 10 days that I would need to bring them back to do a lyme sulfer dip. has anyone else ever had to do this???? I feel so bad for my girls I tried so hard to get rid of them I did everything the vet said to do I didnt want them to have to be dipped. im worried it will stress them out a lot.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Especially if you are a strength trainer/lift weights.**  
  
Long Version: I've always had acne since I was a teenager, and I'm 42 now. It has had it's ups and downs over the years, but it's been a mixture of cystic/inflammatory acne, hormonal acne, and just regular I-have-oily-skin-and-large-pores acne.

The inflammatory cystic acne is in larger part triggered by certain foods (dairy, coffee, chocolate) and alcohol, but the hormonal acne on my neck and jawline the past few years has been extremely stubborn even though my face for the most part stays pretty clear as long as it's being taken care of properly with the right routine. 

I will also preface by saying I'm a gym rat and have been doing weight lifting/strength training for about 3-4 years now and I'm in the gym 4 days a week for at least hour, lifting heavy. I walk on average 15-20k steps a day or more, and work from a standing desk w/ a walking pad. I ride horses twice a week, I walk/train my dogs... all this to say that I am extremely active and I eat lots of protein, whole foods and watch my calories.  
  
I have a lot of lean muscle mass but usually sit at around 27% BF. I'm also taking HRT (topical estrogen/progesterone) for perimenopause symptoms, and am NOT on hormonal birth control. I lost a lot of weight about 4 years ago (70lbs), then got into weight lifting. As such I have very little tolerance for body changes or weight gain. Anyway...

I finally went to a derm last May to see what else I can do for the stubborn jawline/neck breakouts, and she prescribed spiro (oral) and dapsone (topical antibiotic). Started with 50mgs for a week or so, and she said if the side affects were mild and I was handling it okay, I could increase to 100mg. 50mg felt more or less fine, so I jumped to 100mg. Side affects were pretty mild at first, just some headaches if I wasn't drinking enough, increased thirst, feeling my head pulse when I bent over and stood back up, etc. Taking it in the morning worked out best for managing the thirst and staying hydrated.

It took a few months for my skin to improve, but it was noticeably improved by the 2 month checkup and continued to get better (some of the older breakouts were taking awhile to fully heal, but I was getting far far fewer new ones). 

BUT... after about 3 months is when I was really noticing some body changes. While I didn't notice any drastic losses in strength at the gym (maybe just a bit less stamina), I was seeing changes in fat distribution. I already had a really nice hourglass shape and large glutes. My breasts were a little deflated from the original weight loss, but I was still a 32DDD or F and they started to get fuller and I actually noticed my bras were not fitting anymore. I noticed a lot of belly bloat and more fat on my belly/torso, thighs, everything feels more ""squishy"" and my butt is getting FLATTER (like I've lost muscle mass back there). And I was gaining weight and just looking thicker, it was particularly noticeable on my back, when before if I pulled my shoulders back you did NOT see back fat rolls under the rib/waist juncture, suddenly within a week or two I had little fat folds like I used to have before I was weight lifting and was more ""skinny fat"".

So naturally I freaked out and started lowering the dose. I dropped to 50mgs for a month or so, and told my derm. My skin had a breakout flare up after lowering the dose but then stabilized and started looking really good again. She prescribed me topical spiro (Winlevi) and told me to overlap it with the oral spiro for awhile and then wean myself off the pills gradually. I recently dropped to 25mg. If things reverse well enough at 25mg but my skins stays clear I might stay on a low dose, otherwise I will try relying entirely on the Winlevi along with the rest of my skincare. 

I think I'm STARTING to see my body return to normal, and I've cut back on calories to help, but I'm hoping for reassurance that I did not just fuck up my body permanently...",2,1758992062.0,Spironolactone,1,1.0,False

Jail is really just 3 things. Humiliation, fear, and soul crushing boredom.

When I got there, they took my shoes and socks and gave me a sick pair of very used orange flipflops. I got my finger prints taken and  had to answer a bunch of medical questions, like are you suicidal (they literally told me to answer no because if you say yes, your stay is basically going to be in the mental ward of the jail. Which I later learned a lot about and thank fuck I wasn't put in there.) Then I sat in a holding cell about the size of the bathroom at the house for an hour or so with a chode-shaped man while he paced around rambling to himself very loudly about how ""this is a mistake"" and he ""shouldn't be here"". Then a guard took me out, brought me to another room where I had to strip, squat and cough, literally show them my asshole, shower and change into my stripes. I was then brought into an actual cell which I later learned was where they bring new inmates to figure out if they're going to put a warrant out for you or just let you go. The only items they give you are a toothbrush , toothpaste, a plastic orange spark and a plastic cup that you're going to keep with you the entire time. If you lose them you're basically screwed. It's completely quiet except for the guard walking around checking on everyone every 30min or so. No windows and the lights are always on so I had no idea what time it was. 

I was woken up the first morning by the loud clank of the guard opening the slot on my door and giving me little cartons of milk and apple juice. I then drank the milk not realizing he was bring around breakfast also. So I had dry frosted flakes and some canned pears in a styrofoam tray. I then sat there in my bunk for hours before I knocked on my door and asked the guard what time it was. By that time it was only 815am. Turns out breakfast in the holding cells is served at 3am. That fucked with my perception of time really bad. Lunch is served at 10am and then dinner at 4pm. It was during dinner that they served me my warrant and told me I wouldn't see a judge until Tuesday. 

I sat in that cell until Tuesday with nothing to do. I was staring at the bottom of the top bunk for so long that the spots on it started to move. To stay sane you basically have to just sleep. 

I saw the judge Tuesday and then was put into a pod kind of like what you see on that show Orange is the New Black. There were 36 people in there including me. And that is where I stayed the entire time. 

I met a lot of people , but the main ones I talked to were:

Sergei: been locked up since 1993. Ukrainian dude who sold drugs, guns and girls. We played a lot of chess together.

Fucker (wouldn't give anyone his real name): claimed to be an ex Hell's Angels enforcer. He had done so much fighting that his knuckles were basically in his wrists. 

Alex: autistic 21 year old kid who got busted vandalizing his old middle school. He was obsessed with the band Smashing Pumpkins and other 90s alt bands.

I was in E Pod.
There was a TV that was on whatever channel the guards put on. Always on mute, mind you. The only way to hear it was to purchase headphones through commissary. Oh, and they took my glasses when I was being booked so I couldn't even read the subtitles lol. I will say this though, watching football in there was fucking insane lol. People bet all kinds of stuff just to pass time. And the VMAs were basically a strip club to a lot of those guys. It was wild.
There were books but they were more of a joke than anything. An all male pod, and one of the books (I used as a writing surface) was called ""5 Minute Mantras for the Busy Woman"". A real page turner. A lot of the inmates would tear the covers off the books and use them as poker chips.
The ""yard"" was a 20x20ft concrete slab with a drain in the middle surrounded by 20ft concrete walls and a gate that went over the top. The only nature that got in there were the occasional cricket and the spiders in the corners that people would feed said crickets to.

Most days were just repeats with the only difference being the food that we got. When it was lights out though, that's when everyone would go fucking insane. I don't know what kind of coffee they had in there, but it would give everyone the biggest caffeine rush. Like a bunch of hyperactive criminal toddlers running around all night, yelling, screaming, playing cards, chess, etc.

My last night there, we got some new people in with us. The most notable was this super quiet black dude that had been trying to shave his head with a razor super slowly. So when I met him he had a George Costanza afro, but whatever jail is weird. The next day though, they were transferring him to a federal prison for what turned out to be capital murder charges. Shouldn't have been in our pod at all. But he left a book behind. And someone cracked it open and in the front page was a list of peoples'  names... And mine was at the very top. In the rest of the book, every blank space was filled with insane rants and ramblings. One I can remember was a picture he drew of a woman's ass with writing over it that said ""make that ass jump for  Trump"" and then a long rant about why illegal immigrants aren't really illegal if they speak English and shop at Walmart. It literally looked like a real life version of House of Leaves.

There's a lot more that happened, but I think that's a pretty good idea of how it was. I hope you have a good weekend.",2,1758992021.0,u_ZeR0EARTH93,1,1.0,False

Mack laughed like a man who already lost his share and shoved me into the hot wind. We jumped because the order stuck to our throats and because the only road below had to die.

The landing hammered knees and ribs, and the bird kicked crates into the mud while the crew chief cursed the weight. Sarge pointed with two fingers, and the engineers unpacked wire and charges and started turning raw slope into a cage with markers hidden under leaves and mud for us only.

We seeded command detonated lines in layers matched to the ground, with lanes of dead space shaped for our moves. False gaps went where officers would point, and every gap had a bite waiting under leaves and split sticks. Scouts marked creeks, culverts, saddles, and trees with touches, and Chen wrote ranges on stakes that we hid in brush. Mortar crews dug pads behind the crest, set plates, and logged bearings that turned gullies into funnels when the call came. I paced distances with Chen, counted steps with tongue dry, and learned the ridge by boot feel and finger memory.

We cut the lifelines like a job list, with trees across switchbacks that forced engines grind and skids slide. Demo men dropped pins on bridges and sent decks folding into runoff, leaving spans snarled with rebar and trash. We hit a ration dump and salted sacks with laxatives and desiccant pulled from kits, then broke seals on every case. UAV crews went low over terraces and plastic bladders and set heat on them, and the smoke rolled down the cuts. We grabbed prisoners at a stuck culvert, tagged them, stripped comms and burst gear, and sent them downtrail to talk.

Dark covered the ridge, and four man teams slid out with tape on lenses and blacked gear all around. We faced claymores inward to punish anyone tailing us, and we checked the stamps with two fingers before setting caps. Tripwire daisy chains tied our lanes to soft trunks, and withdrawals ran on hand squeezes and slaps that nobody mistook. I moved with Mack, Chen, and Vik through rot and roots, and every step pressed mud through the boot seams. We stayed silent and watched for wires in leaf sheen, and we counted to hold our nerves steady enough to work.

We found field kitchens with pots warm and men half asleep, and we kicked the tables down and moved through steam. Fuel drums took bayonet holes and bled into trenches, and the slick crawled sandbags until pooled under tarps. We set helmets on stakes at forks, and the shapes pulled patrols into wires waited ten steps beyond the turn. I kept my eyes on ground and not on faces, and I counted breathing to keep fear from shaking hands. We left in silence with caps set and lines tight, and kitchens stayed behind with pots tipped and soup on dirt.

Loudspeakers came out of dry bags with batteries, and we played distress calls cut from earlier fights and panicked traffic. Voices cracked, begged, and clipped into static, and sound hung in leaves and fed across tarps and poles. Leaflets drifted through their lines with unit names and numbers that matched losses, and heads turned wherever the paper landed. We raked staff tents with lasers that stayed moving, and officers tried to rest under red dots that never settled. Ortiz kept volume trimmed and his headphones crooked, and he said worst part was how fast the lies turned into truth.

Their relief column tried a push up the cut when our fire slowed, and we let the elements enter our fans. Sarge waited until third carrier crossed a stake we had hidden, then he signaled, tubes and rifles opened together. The hulls lifted and folded, and dismounts ran into arcs that we had staked and chalked across ground. A medevac drone dipped in on a bright panel, and Vik clipped it with a round and a curse about hope. We strung its frame from a vine over the trail, and second drone died on a shot and hung beside it.

Perimeter rules went from hard to absolute, and nobody asked for exceptions because exceptions got friends killed on this ground ever. No fires inside lines after dark, and we ate cold and kept wrappers quiet under ponchos that trapped breath. No talking outside hand signals, and whisper could carry down a hollow and pull a mortar onto squad. Anyone crossing tripwire belts without code flares died on sight, and nobody hesitated because hesitation made bodies and lost ground. The ridge turned into a hunger cage and a work site, and wrapped around us and the enemy until choices got narrow.

We cut open our ration plans and stretched them, and the taste turned chalky and sweet and stayed on the tongue. Water came in canteens that smelled of iodine and rubber, and we sipped small and lied to our bodies about thirst. Leeches found skin under pants and straps, and we burned them off with smokes and swore until the shaking stopped. We saved antibiotics for breach squads only, and everyone else got tape, iodine, and salt with complaints. Captured medkits went into a burn pit with a stink that stuck inside the mask filters, and nobody argued about it.

Small probes felt for our edge and touched wires, and the blasts answered with hard slaps that kept them jumpy. We changed nothing in our lanes without talk with Sarge, and the map stayed pinned in head by pain habit. Scouts walked the same gullies and checked stakes, and every stake matched the book, which meant our math was sound. Engineers pulled more wire and nested it under mulch, and smiled when a boot heel slipped just short of peg. We heard orders in their net go sharp and frantic, and word for our ridge started sound like a curse.

The three prisoners moved off with paint on jackets and bare belts, and I watched them until brush hid their backs. They would talk because worry breaks silence, and those words would sour camps and mess lines. We did not cheer when the drones swung overhead on vines, but we looked up and knew the message had landed. After that push the trail filled with prints, bags, and broken plates, and the silence reached farther than any speaker could. Sarge said sleep would stay scarce for them, and he kept our rest in turns that hurt but kept rifles steady.

Lasers moving over sheets and doors, and we timed the passes to deny rhythm that might let their heads drop. Speakers came on and off in patterns we changed, and Ortiz watched spikes in their net told us nerves were tearing. We kept our lines quiet and boots wrapped, and metal stayed taped so nothing clicked and carried into the ground. I stopped thinking past next lane and next count of steps, and that made work possible without shaking apart. The ridge did not care about names or plans, and it answered pressure, weight, and angles we set with bags.

A column formed below the ridge and broke up on its own, and watched the mess through glass without wasting rounds. Their staff feared more drones on vines, or maybe drivers saw helmets on sticks and decided the road was cursed. We did not chase, because the ridge mattered more than bodies, and Sarge told patience paid better than a rush. We patched lanes, checked caps, and dug deeper where roots held, and engineers said the slope would hold under a stampede. I wrote tallies on my stock and cleaned grit from bolt, and I did not think about home.

The air stayed wet and ground slick, and sores on feet turned from angry to raw, and the work never paused. We learned calls of their engines and taste of their smoke, and told us where to aim. Sarge kept walking the line with checks on boots and cuts, and spoke soft but made it clear nothing would give. We heard the road below grind and wince, and we answered that sound with metal, dust, and broken plans. I told myself the job was simple and true, and that helped when faces in my head started to sit up.

We held the ridge and cut the road, and the spear began to feel thin without food, fuel, or water. The captains below sent messages that sounded tired at once, and the answers came back clipped and heavy with orders. We did not care about their feelings, because our plan was simple, and plans work when every step is measured. Perimeter rules stayed carved into ridge, and anyone crossing wire without permission met fire that did pause or ask. I lay under a poncho with stock cheek and counted breaths, and knew the ridge would break anyone who came.

Rain reached into every seam and turned trails to slurry that grabbed boots and stole strength while ridge sat above everything and watched in disinterest. He moved with his squad through muck that rose to thighs, feeling chafe and skin soften, counting steps because counting kept panic and work possible. They used sandbags to channel runoff into enemy pits, watched water climb rib height, listened to coughing grow as rot spread under tape and cloth. Antibiotics stayed locked for assault squads only, and everyone else got salt, iodine, and curses, with painkillers saved for when someone could walk and fight.

Resource denial turned orders into habit filled days, with sappers pouring brine and oil upstream into filters, burning captured medkits so no chemicals reached mouths. Shot ration pallets were re rigged with wires and pressure caps, fitted to seams that looked harmless, where hungry hands would pry and die there. Scout snipers got told to hit quartermasters and comm techs before shooters, then chaplains, cooks, because units starve faster when supply, signals, and meals missing. Each shot had to matter or a man scrubbed latrine trenches while rain filled them, and that lesson kept muzzles quiet until targets aligned lanes.

Minefields were angled to herd patrols into bowls cut by shovels, where machine gun fire crossed from berms, and approach carried distance, deflection, and depth. We ran DRADIS decoys that showed bivouacs to sensors, then fed coordinates to batteries, and watched camps draw shells that chewed tarps, poles, and staff. A fake breach appeared on west spur with wire and scuffed mud, and when aliens probed, cutters dropped trees behind them, splitting them before warning. Demo teams collapsed spur with satchels that liquefied the slope, burying platoons under clay while radio calls broke, and only replies were static and breathing.

Close punishment came when ravines be cleared, with bayonet lines moving knee to knee without speech, pushing bodies aside and keeping muzzles forward steady branches. Entrenching tools finished stunned fast and quiet, because ammo was counted and promised elsewhere, and decision cost cartridges, sweat, and time we could not replace. Flamers purged bunkers in blasts while hose teams stood by with foam to keep fire from jumping into brush that would have cooked our lanes. He kept trigger discipline while smoke spread, because wasted rounds meant punishment, and no one wanted trench service while monsoon turned latrines into sour lakes.

Logistics stayed thin on their side and ours, but our belts held longer because tallies were carved into stocks and checked before rifle left hole. Stimulant tabs took the edge off fatigue and appetite, left hands shaky, and put a chemical taste in spit that never faded while work stacking. He carved numbers into his stock after each contact, and those cuts meant control, because mind settled when the weapon matched the ledger in head. Anyone who wasted a round scrubbed latrines or carried stink barrels along ridge line, and nobody put him for relief when trench water climbed high.

Message to command went out as drone footage of ridge without coordinates, with captions said withdraw or starve, and the feed ran open on band. Alien high command answered by ordering a counterattack along both spurs, and chatter spilled clear enough that even our boots knew something heavy was coming. False weakness got staged by reducing fire, with a platoon breaking and messy on purpose, dropping crates and torn maps where eyes cameras feed reports. The plan depended on rain, fatigue, and pride, because starved line leans when it smells an opening, and the ridge held shape when else sagged.

He listened to water hammer tarp roofs in holes and heard men cough orders while boots sloshed, and he knew next would be about weight. He checked clay lines, marked stakes, and pulled leeches from ankles with blade, cursing while Vik joked about starting a farm when this tour ended. Sarge walked loop, checked feet and eyes, then reminded them of no fires, no talk, and no stray movement after code flares fell outside belts. Sleep came in slices under ponchos that trapped breath, and dreams were inventory lists, with breaches, stakes, charges, and socks counted again until eyes opened.

Their patrols testing the west spur breach with probes looked careful, and cutters waited until crossed before dropping trunks to close rear and slice group. He heard officers argue net about pulling back, and demo men brought the slope down with satchels shoved clay helmets and sealed rifles in mud. Bait and cull worked on smaller teams, who chased a gap we cut with wire, walked through, and found the lane closed behind them trapped. Those who tried dig found clay sliding into holes, and rest sat shaking under rain until bursts from flank guns pushed heads down and returned.

Weather as weapon carried day more than shots, because every slope we sandbagged flooded pits, and every trench we opened became channel that drowned fires. We listened to pumps wheeze and fail, watched men bail with helmets while the water climbed, and sickness followed with skin slough and teeth loosening. He smeared antifungal under socks and between toes, then wrapped tape until nothing rubbed, because feet mattered more than sentiment when ground punished sloppy step. Rations got stripped to powders and crackers, coffee turned into paste, and nobody bitched because hunger cleared noise and left lists and targets with range.

Machine guns stayed cleaned and wrapped under sheets, belts kept dry in tins, and firing point had barrels laid out with mitts and grease reach. Mortar teams refreshed fuzes charges, set plates deeper, and chalked increments where damp crept, settings stayed honest when targets called from draws and slick saddles. He rehearsed signals with Mack and Chen, went through reloads, and reset trip lines with Vik while rain ran off helmets and pooled boots complaint. They spoke little, saved jokes for gear checks, and put energy remained into stacking clay, setting posts, and figuring where the cuts would hurt most.

When the push gathered, it announced on net with stressed orders and clipped acknowledgments, and he could feel the boost move down the line breath. Shaping fire woke in spits around decoys, then shut, and spurs began to shake with traffic while officers yelled formation drivers fought mud fear hard. Our mine lanes bent them toward bowls already logged by range, and the west spur showed fake breach to pull a thick slice off front. He waited in hole with Mack, checked safety off, and tried not to taste the chemical layer on tongue while counting to keep hands shaking.

Bayonet lines moved again when ravine flared shapes, and he went forward because orders plain, pushing through bodies while muzzles stayed pointed at angles set. An alien lunged from reeds with a blade and met stock first, then edge of a tool, and no one spoke because noise brought rounds. Flamers coughed, crews swept bunkers with quick bursts, and hose teams smothered edges so the burn did not take trees or blow into firing lanes. He wiped soot from face with inside of a sleeve and tasted oil, then stepped sideways because a trip line crossed the path near boot.

Rain blurred sights and made straps stretch, and he kept cheek on stock while Mack nudged left, Chen tapped helmet, and lane lit with bursts. Targets fell into clay and water without cries, and he felt the weight of gear and ache in elbows said keep moving until spacing held. After sweep, sappers planted new caps, pulled old wire, and shifted stakes strides to break patterns, because repetition kills when an enemy starts reading ground. He drank from canteen that tasted rubber and iodine, chewed a tab for focus, and waited for next probe to nose against lanes again soon.

By the time command repeated message over open bands, the counterattack order hardened, and everyone on our side knew we had to hold for collapse. He wrote words on a scrap of tape and stuck it inside sling, then rubbed mud across it because luck did not exist here, work. The rain kept coming without pause while batteries cooled and warmed, and ridge wore trenches deeper, men learned to move with less noise and patience. He thought of nothing except tasks in sequence, and that narrowed to steps, grips, and checks, which made fear and distance shorter when screaming carried.

By the end of grind, order to counterattack felt certain, so we tightened lanes, burned a cache, and waited for mass that would break us. Sarge passed along check of boots, rations, and belts, then told them to hold fire until the saddle filled, because math would do the work. He felt ridge under elbows and thought about dry socks, food, and bed did not sway, then pushed that aside and watched the lane instead. The caption hung in head, withdraw or starve, and he hoped someone important kept reading, because choke point waited beyond this one after valley closed.

They staged a shortage by cutting harassing fire and making our line sound thin on purpose, and he felt the wait turn heavier as reports trickled. A platoon pulled back with noise and dropped empty crates, torn maps, and cracked belts along the crest so eyes below could count a fake bleed. Ortiz let fake complaints leak on open bands about dry tins and broken strikers, and the alien net repeated the bait with eager echoes. He lay in his hole with stock across forearms and watched the two spurs gather armor and infantry for a push fed by pride.

The east saddle opened first, and columns filed in with carriers spaced by habit and officers waving sticks that pointed at our fake breach markers. Charges set days earlier dropped rock and timber behind elements and sealed the path with debris, and the panic started before any gun spoke. Mortars walked the formation forward with increments, and machine guns took the survivors by angles that had been rehearsed until hands stopped shaking. He fired bursts on the stake line while Mack fed the belt and Chen counted, and the clay turned to liquid around shovels that could not hold.

Some tried to dig while shells stepped, and the slope slid back over them with gear twisting and plates vanishing under brown wash. Others crawled toward the flanks and ran into interlocking arcs that cut low through brush, and rifles finished the ones left moving. Medevac drones hovered on the edge of the bowl and hesitated, and then our tubes took them, and frames dropped into the churn and broke apart. He swapped barrels with mitts while Vik covered, and he tasted burned oil through the mask and felt the stock thud against a bruise that never cleared inside him.

On the west spur the trap opened when armor pushed past our AT hides and rolled into a V of cut jungle that closed around. We let the forward hulls pass and hit the rear vehicles first with side shots, and thermite burned through engine bays until lids buckled and smoke lay. Dismounts stumbled out into smoke and strobe and met rifle squads that moved fast between stumps, and grenades rolled under tracks and popped boxes and hands. He drove a launcher into his shoulder and sent a missile across a lane, and the side plate folded and threw wheels.

Assault squads pushed through the gaps our blasts made and cleared trenches with shotguns and charges while axes finished the stuck with boots slipping on gore. No quarter was given across the spur, and medics treated only the ones who could stand and carry more magazines back to the line. He kicked a door on a dugout and tossed a charge under the cot, and the roof sank while dust and breath forced out around boots. Flame teams sterilized tunnels and pits, and demo posted dual time fuses on the deeper bunkers so cave mouths would swallow their own dead.

With both spurs mauled, the center pocket tried to shift downslope through brush that had been cut to hide stakes and mines tied to trees. Pre registered airburst patterns detonated above the canopy and sent splinters and fragments down, and anything that moved drew rakes from guns already dialed. He watched the valley floor turn into a drain for gear, limbs, mud, and broken packs, and he pressed his tongue against a cracked tooth until the itch stopped. The pocket stalled in the low ground and pulsed without structure, and the ridge felt quiet except for the work of reloads.

Rangers moved out under rain with handhelds and dogs, and heat signatures showed trails we could not see with eyes alone in this soup. Prisoners called out mine lines to their own side over speakers, and the ones who lied were marched through first without pause or comments. Supply fires burned through the wet because fuel drums had been split and fed with blocks, and the smoke marked the road for units still lost. Bulldozers pushed spoil over mounds and wrecks until nothing obvious remained, and the ridge changed shape again while we stacked belts and checked safeties and latches.

Command renamed the ridge Imphal Gate on net and printed it on next batch of reports, and no smiled because we knew what sat under name. The road stayed cut by craters and hulls welded into a wall by heat and chain, and scouts mapped new routes that would fail the same way. Fresh companies rotated in with dry socks and stared at our lines with careful eyes, and we handed off markers and notes without speeches. Orders came to open a new choke point ten klicks forward, and he nodded because the work did not stop for feelings.

He walked the east saddle after the last screams faded and counted wrecks by type with Chen while Mack stamped out a stubborn flare near a crate. The clay swallowed boots to ankles and pulled at bodies that had fallen face down, and tags clung to straps under mud that stank. They cut trophies only for intelligence, not for fun, and Sarge checked packs to make sure nothing stupid travelled back with the reliefs. The dogs found a survivor under a carrier panel, and the man spat at the handler and got a stock across the teeth and silence fast.

He washed mud from his hands with a capful and wiped them on trousers because the sink did not exist here, and he checked his feet again. Skin tore at the heels and the tape lifted at the edges, and he pressed it down with grit because was nothing better to do. Ortiz handed him a strip of jerky that tasted of plastic and salt, and they chewed without words while the rain slowed and restarted. He did not feel proud or lucky, he felt used and functional, and function kept men on feet while the ground took the rest.

They went back to the west spur and found armor cooled to hard lumps with crews inside cooked down to a smell that stuck in masks. Thermite scars ran across decks and engine ribs, and rifles lay in piles near doors where men had tried to bail and failed. He stepped around bodies and counted magazines and batteries, and he cut bandoliers free with a knife that needed new edge for later. Mack joked about gourmet meals to keep air moving, and Sarge told him to breathe through his nose and keep moving because jokes did not scrub the stink.

Assault men dragged captured crates to a pit and dumped them in when inventory showed junk, and he watched good food sink because orders mattered more than appetite. The medics stapled a scalp on a man who could still carry ammunition, and they stepped over others who grabbed at sleeves and begged. He thought about those hands for a breath and wiped his barrel and moved on because the lane still needed eyes and trigger. Demo set more dual time fuses in deeper tunnels, and the ground shivered later while the squad ate crackers and waited for the dull thumps.

Another group tried to climb through the central trees in small packets, and airbursts shredded the leaves and sent shards into backs and necks until movement stopped.

1ns03cc,https://i.redd.it/qpacv8bxjqrf1.png,Why are the values of rare furnitures not that high?,"first of all if this is something obvious please dont attack me, i havent had economics at school for the past threeish years

My main question obviously connects to the Noob Scream painting situation:

If we look at furniture as just collectables, rather than focusing on their actual in-game use, then their value should realistically be way more than just a couple of mill

The number of copies of these r often times extremely small (bout 300 per item) and some of them were season pass rewards. Given that, their overall value should be comparable to something like the vantablack color, which I believe IS priced correctly",5,1758991850.0,robloxjailbreak,4,0.86,False
1ns03az,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1ns03az/approach_a_human_line_and_your_army_disappears/,Approach a Human Line and Your Army Disappears,"The ramp dropped and the ridge looked like a saw waiting to eat us. Mack laughed like a man who already lost his share and shoved me into the hot wind. We jumped because the order stuck to our throats and because the only road below had to die.

The landing hammered knees and ribs, and the bird kicked crates into the mud while the crew chief cursed the weight. Sarge pointed with two fingers, and the engineers unpacked wire and charges and started turning raw slope into a cage with markers hidden under leaves and mud for us only.

We seeded command detonated lines in layers matched to the ground, with lanes of dead space shaped for our moves. False gaps went where officers would point, and every gap had a bite waiting under leaves and split sticks. Scouts marked creeks, culverts, saddles, and trees with touches, and Chen wrote ranges on stakes that we hid in brush. Mortar crews dug pads behind the crest, set plates, and logged bearings that turned gullies into funnels when the call came. I paced distances with Chen, counted steps with tongue dry, and learned the ridge by boot feel and finger memory.

We cut the lifelines like a job list, with trees across switchbacks that forced engines grind and skids slide. Demo men dropped pins on bridges and sent decks folding into runoff, leaving spans snarled with rebar and trash. We hit a ration dump and salted sacks with laxatives and desiccant pulled from kits, then broke seals on every case. UAV crews went low over terraces and plastic bladders and set heat on them, and the smoke rolled down the cuts. We grabbed prisoners at a stuck culvert, tagged them, stripped comms and burst gear, and sent them downtrail to talk.

Dark covered the ridge, and four man teams slid out with tape on lenses and blacked gear all around. We faced claymores inward to punish anyone tailing us, and we checked the stamps with two fingers before setting caps. Tripwire daisy chains tied our lanes to soft trunks, and withdrawals ran on hand squeezes and slaps that nobody mistook. I moved with Mack, Chen, and Vik through rot and roots, and every step pressed mud through the boot seams. We stayed silent and watched for wires in leaf sheen, and we counted to hold our nerves steady enough to work.

We found field kitchens with pots warm and men half asleep, and we kicked the tables down and moved through steam. Fuel drums took bayonet holes and bled into trenches, and the slick crawled sandbags until pooled under tarps. We set helmets on stakes at forks, and the shapes pulled patrols into wires waited ten steps beyond the turn. I kept my eyes on ground and not on faces, and I counted breathing to keep fear from shaking hands. We left in silence with caps set and lines tight, and kitchens stayed behind with pots tipped and soup on dirt.

Loudspeakers came out of dry bags with batteries, and we played distress calls cut from earlier fights and panicked traffic. Voices cracked, begged, and clipped into static, and sound hung in leaves and fed across tarps and poles. Leaflets drifted through their lines with unit names and numbers that matched losses, and heads turned wherever the paper landed. We raked staff tents with lasers that stayed moving, and officers tried to rest under red dots that never settled. Ortiz kept volume trimmed and his headphones crooked, and he said worst part was how fast the lies turned into truth.

Their relief column tried a push up the cut when our fire slowed, and we let the elements enter our fans. Sarge waited until third carrier crossed a stake we had hidden, then he signaled, tubes and rifles opened together. The hulls lifted and folded, and dismounts ran into arcs that we had staked and chalked across ground. A medevac drone dipped in on a bright panel, and Vik clipped it with a round and a curse about hope. We strung its frame from a vine over the trail, and second drone died on a shot and hung beside it.

Perimeter rules went from hard to absolute, and nobody asked for exceptions because exceptions got friends killed on this ground ever. No fires inside lines after dark, and we ate cold and kept wrappers quiet under ponchos that trapped breath. No talking outside hand signals, and whisper could carry down a hollow and pull a mortar onto squad. Anyone crossing tripwire belts without code flares died on sight, and nobody hesitated because hesitation made bodies and lost ground. The ridge turned into a hunger cage and a work site, and wrapped around us and the enemy until choices got narrow.

We cut open our ration plans and stretched them, and the taste turned chalky and sweet and stayed on the tongue. Water came in canteens that smelled of iodine and rubber, and we sipped small and lied to our bodies about thirst. Leeches found skin under pants and straps, and we burned them off with smokes and swore until the shaking stopped. We saved antibiotics for breach squads only, and everyone else got tape, iodine, and salt with complaints. Captured medkits went into a burn pit with a stink that stuck inside the mask filters, and nobody argued about it.

Small probes felt for our edge and touched wires, and the blasts answered with hard slaps that kept them jumpy. We changed nothing in our lanes without talk with Sarge, and the map stayed pinned in head by pain habit. Scouts walked the same gullies and checked stakes, and every stake matched the book, which meant our math was sound. Engineers pulled more wire and nested it under mulch, and smiled when a boot heel slipped just short of peg. We heard orders in their net go sharp and frantic, and word for our ridge started sound like a curse.

The three prisoners moved off with paint on jackets and bare belts, and I watched them until brush hid their backs. They would talk because worry breaks silence, and those words would sour camps and mess lines. We did not cheer when the drones swung overhead on vines, but we looked up and knew the message had landed. After that push the trail filled with prints, bags, and broken plates, and the silence reached farther than any speaker could. Sarge said sleep would stay scarce for them, and he kept our rest in turns that hurt but kept rifles steady.

Lasers moving over sheets and doors, and we timed the passes to deny rhythm that might let their heads drop. Speakers came on and off in patterns we changed, and Ortiz watched spikes in their net told us nerves were tearing. We kept our lines quiet and boots wrapped, and metal stayed taped so nothing clicked and carried into the ground. I stopped thinking past next lane and next count of steps, and that made work possible without shaking apart. The ridge did not care about names or plans, and it answered pressure, weight, and angles we set with bags.

A column formed below the ridge and broke up on its own, and watched the mess through glass without wasting rounds. Their staff feared more drones on vines, or maybe drivers saw helmets on sticks and decided the road was cursed. We did not chase, because the ridge mattered more than bodies, and Sarge told patience paid better than a rush. We patched lanes, checked caps, and dug deeper where roots held, and engineers said the slope would hold under a stampede. I wrote tallies on my stock and cleaned grit from bolt, and I did not think about home.

The air stayed wet and ground slick, and sores on feet turned from angry to raw, and the work never paused. We learned calls of their engines and taste of their smoke, and told us where to aim. Sarge kept walking the line with checks on boots and cuts, and spoke soft but made it clear nothing would give. We heard the road below grind and wince, and we answered that sound with metal, dust, and broken plans. I told myself the job was simple and true, and that helped when faces in my head started to sit up.

We held the ridge and cut the road, and the spear began to feel thin without food, fuel, or water. The captains below sent messages that sounded tired at once, and the answers came back clipped and heavy with orders. We did not care about their feelings, because our plan was simple, and plans work when every step is measured. Perimeter rules stayed carved into ridge, and anyone crossing wire without permission met fire that did pause or ask. I lay under a poncho with stock cheek and counted breaths, and knew the ridge would break anyone who came.

Rain reached into every seam and turned trails to slurry that grabbed boots and stole strength while ridge sat above everything and watched in disinterest. He moved with his squad through muck that rose to thighs, feeling chafe and skin soften, counting steps because counting kept panic and work possible. They used sandbags to channel runoff into enemy pits, watched water climb rib height, listened to coughing grow as rot spread under tape and cloth. Antibiotics stayed locked for assault squads only, and everyone else got salt, iodine, and curses, with painkillers saved for when someone could walk and fight.

Resource denial turned orders into habit filled days, with sappers pouring brine and oil upstream into filters, burning captured medkits so no chemicals reached mouths. Shot ration pallets were re rigged with wires and pressure caps, fitted to seams that looked harmless, where hungry hands would pry and die there. Scout snipers got told to hit quartermasters and comm techs before shooters, then chaplains, cooks, because units starve faster when supply, signals, and meals missing. Each shot had to matter or a man scrubbed latrine trenches while rain filled them, and that lesson kept muzzles quiet until targets aligned lanes.

Minefields were angled to herd patrols into bowls cut by shovels, where machine gun fire crossed from berms, and approach carried distance, deflection, and depth. We ran DRADIS decoys that showed bivouacs to sensors, then fed coordinates to batteries, and watched camps draw shells that chewed tarps, poles, and staff. A fake breach appeared on west spur with wire and scuffed mud, and when aliens probed, cutters dropped trees behind them, splitting them before warning. Demo teams collapsed spur with satchels that liquefied the slope, burying platoons under clay while radio calls broke, and only replies were static and breathing.

Close punishment came when ravines be cleared, with bayonet lines moving knee to knee without speech, pushing bodies aside and keeping muzzles forward steady branches. Entrenching tools finished stunned fast and quiet, because ammo was counted and promised elsewhere, and decision cost cartridges, sweat, and time we could not replace. Flamers purged bunkers in blasts while hose teams stood by with foam to keep fire from jumping into brush that would have cooked our lanes. He kept trigger discipline while smoke spread, because wasted rounds meant punishment, and no one wanted trench service while monsoon turned latrines into sour lakes.

Logistics stayed thin on their side and ours, but our belts held longer because tallies were carved into stocks and checked before rifle left hole. Stimulant tabs took the edge off fatigue and appetite, left hands shaky, and put a chemical taste in spit that never faded while work stacking. He carved numbers into his stock after each contact, and those cuts meant control, because mind settled when the weapon matched the ledger in head. Anyone who wasted a round scrubbed latrines or carried stink barrels along ridge line, and nobody put him for relief when trench water climbed high.

Message to command went out as drone footage of ridge without coordinates, with captions said withdraw or starve, and the feed ran open on band. Alien high command answered by ordering a counterattack along both spurs, and chatter spilled clear enough that even our boots knew something heavy was coming. False weakness got staged by reducing fire, with a platoon breaking and messy on purpose, dropping crates and torn maps where eyes cameras feed reports. The plan depended on rain, fatigue, and pride, because starved line leans when it smells an opening, and the ridge held shape when else sagged.

He listened to water hammer tarp roofs in holes and heard men cough orders while boots sloshed, and he knew next would be about weight. He checked clay lines, marked stakes, and pulled leeches from ankles with blade, cursing while Vik joked about starting a farm when this tour ended. Sarge walked loop, checked feet and eyes, then reminded them of no fires, no talk, and no stray movement after code flares fell outside belts. Sleep came in slices under ponchos that trapped breath, and dreams were inventory lists, with breaches, stakes, charges, and socks counted again until eyes opened.

Their patrols testing the west spur breach with probes looked careful, and cutters waited until crossed before dropping trunks to close rear and slice group. He heard officers argue net about pulling back, and demo men brought the slope down with satchels shoved clay helmets and sealed rifles in mud. Bait and cull worked on smaller teams, who chased a gap we cut with wire, walked through, and found the lane closed behind them trapped. Those who tried dig found clay sliding into holes, and rest sat shaking under rain until bursts from flank guns pushed heads down and returned.

Weather as weapon carried day more than shots, because every slope we sandbagged flooded pits, and every trench we opened became channel that drowned fires. We listened to pumps wheeze and fail, watched men bail with helmets while the water climbed, and sickness followed with skin slough and teeth loosening. He smeared antifungal under socks and between toes, then wrapped tape until nothing rubbed, because feet mattered more than sentiment when ground punished sloppy step. Rations got stripped to powders and crackers, coffee turned into paste, and nobody bitched because hunger cleared noise and left lists and targets with range.

Machine guns stayed cleaned and wrapped under sheets, belts kept dry in tins, and firing point had barrels laid out with mitts and grease reach. Mortar teams refreshed fuzes charges, set plates deeper, and chalked increments where damp crept, settings stayed honest when targets called from draws and slick saddles. He rehearsed signals with Mack and Chen, went through reloads, and reset trip lines with Vik while rain ran off helmets and pooled boots complaint. They spoke little, saved jokes for gear checks, and put energy remained into stacking clay, setting posts, and figuring where the cuts would hurt most.

When the push gathered, it announced on net with stressed orders and clipped acknowledgments, and he could feel the boost move down the line breath. Shaping fire woke in spits around decoys, then shut, and spurs began to shake with traffic while officers yelled formation drivers fought mud fear hard. Our mine lanes bent them toward bowls already logged by range, and the west spur showed fake breach to pull a thick slice off front. He waited in hole with Mack, checked safety off, and tried not to taste the chemical layer on tongue while counting to keep hands shaking.

Bayonet lines moved again when ravine flared shapes, and he went forward because orders plain, pushing through bodies while muzzles stayed pointed at angles set. An alien lunged from reeds with a blade and met stock first, then edge of a tool, and no one spoke because noise brought rounds. Flamers coughed, crews swept bunkers with quick bursts, and hose teams smothered edges so the burn did not take trees or blow into firing lanes. He wiped soot from face with inside of a sleeve and tasted oil, then stepped sideways because a trip line crossed the path near boot.

Rain blurred sights and made straps stretch, and he kept cheek on stock while Mack nudged left, Chen tapped helmet, and lane lit with bursts. Targets fell into clay and water without cries, and he felt the weight of gear and ache in elbows said keep moving until spacing held. After sweep, sappers planted new caps, pulled old wire, and shifted stakes strides to break patterns, because repetition kills when an enemy starts reading ground. He drank from canteen that tasted rubber and iodine, chewed a tab for focus, and waited for next probe to nose against lanes again soon.

By the time command repeated message over open bands, the counterattack order hardened, and everyone on our side knew we had to hold for collapse. He wrote words on a scrap of tape and stuck it inside sling, then rubbed mud across it because luck did not exist here, work. The rain kept coming without pause while batteries cooled and warmed, and ridge wore trenches deeper, men learned to move with less noise and patience. He thought of nothing except tasks in sequence, and that narrowed to steps, grips, and checks, which made fear and distance shorter when screaming carried.

By the end of grind, order to counterattack felt certain, so we tightened lanes, burned a cache, and waited for mass that would break us. Sarge passed along check of boots, rations, and belts, then told them to hold fire until the saddle filled, because math would do the work. He felt ridge under elbows and thought about dry socks, food, and bed did not sway, then pushed that aside and watched the lane instead. The caption hung in head, withdraw or starve, and he hoped someone important kept reading, because choke point waited beyond this one after valley closed.

They staged a shortage by cutting harassing fire and making our line sound thin on purpose, and he felt the wait turn heavier as reports trickled. A platoon pulled back with noise and dropped empty crates, torn maps, and cracked belts along the crest so eyes below could count a fake bleed. Ortiz let fake complaints leak on open bands about dry tins and broken strikers, and the alien net repeated the bait with eager echoes. He lay in his hole with stock across forearms and watched the two spurs gather armor and infantry for a push fed by pride.

The east saddle opened first, and columns filed in with carriers spaced by habit and officers waving sticks that pointed at our fake breach markers. Charges set days earlier dropped rock and timber behind elements and sealed the path with debris, and the panic started before any gun spoke. Mortars walked the formation forward with increments, and machine guns took the survivors by angles that had been rehearsed until hands stopped shaking. He fired bursts on the stake line while Mack fed the belt and Chen counted, and the clay turned to liquid around shovels that could not hold.

Some tried to dig while shells stepped, and the slope slid back over them with gear twisting and plates vanishing under brown wash. Others crawled toward the flanks and ran into interlocking arcs that cut low through brush, and rifles finished the ones left moving. Medevac drones hovered on the edge of the bowl and hesitated, and then our tubes took them, and frames dropped into the churn and broke apart. He swapped barrels with mitts while Vik covered, and he tasted burned oil through the mask and felt the stock thud against a bruise that never cleared inside him.

On the west spur the trap opened when armor pushed past our AT hides and rolled into a V of cut jungle that closed around. We let the forward hulls pass and hit the rear vehicles first with side shots, and thermite burned through engine bays until lids buckled and smoke lay. Dismounts stumbled out into smoke and strobe and met rifle squads that moved fast between stumps, and grenades rolled under tracks and popped boxes and hands. He drove a launcher into his shoulder and sent a missile across a lane, and the side plate folded and threw wheels.

Assault squads pushed through the gaps our blasts made and cleared trenches with shotguns and charges while axes finished the stuck with boots slipping on gore. No quarter was given across the spur, and medics treated only the ones who could stand and carry more magazines back to the line. He kicked a door on a dugout and tossed a charge under the cot, and the roof sank while dust and breath forced out around boots. Flame teams sterilized tunnels and pits, and demo posted dual time fuses on the deeper bunkers so cave mouths would swallow their own dead.

With both spurs mauled, the center pocket tried to shift downslope through brush that had been cut to hide stakes and mines tied to trees. Pre registered airburst patterns detonated above the canopy and sent splinters and fragments down, and anything that moved drew rakes from guns already dialed. He watched the valley floor turn into a drain for gear, limbs, mud, and broken packs, and he pressed his tongue against a cracked tooth until the itch stopped. The pocket stalled in the low ground and pulsed without structure, and the ridge felt quiet except for the work of reloads.

Rangers moved out under rain with handhelds and dogs, and heat signatures showed trails we could not see with eyes alone in this soup. Prisoners called out mine lines to their own side over speakers, and the ones who lied were marched through first without pause or comments. Supply fires burned through the wet because fuel drums had been split and fed with blocks, and the smoke marked the road for units still lost. Bulldozers pushed spoil over mounds and wrecks until nothing obvious remained, and the ridge changed shape again while we stacked belts and checked safeties and latches.

Command renamed the ridge Imphal Gate on net and printed it on next batch of reports, and no smiled because we knew what sat under name. The road stayed cut by craters and hulls welded into a wall by heat and chain, and scouts mapped new routes that would fail the same way. Fresh companies rotated in with dry socks and stared at our lines with careful eyes, and we handed off markers and notes without speeches. Orders came to open a new choke point ten klicks forward, and he nodded because the work did not stop for feelings.

He walked the east saddle after the last screams faded and counted wrecks by type with Chen while Mack stamped out a stubborn flare near a crate. The clay swallowed boots to ankles and pulled at bodies that had fallen face down, and tags clung to straps under mud that stank. They cut trophies only for intelligence, not for fun, and Sarge checked packs to make sure nothing stupid travelled back with the reliefs. The dogs found a survivor under a carrier panel, and the man spat at the handler and got a stock across the teeth and silence fast.

He washed mud from his hands with a capful and wiped them on trousers because the sink did not exist here, and he checked his feet again. Skin tore at the heels and the tape lifted at the edges, and he pressed it down with grit because was nothing better to do. Ortiz handed him a strip of jerky that tasted of plastic and salt, and they chewed without words while the rain slowed and restarted. He did not feel proud or lucky, he felt used and functional, and function kept men on feet while the ground took the rest.

They went back to the west spur and found armor cooled to hard lumps with crews inside cooked down to a smell that stuck in masks. Thermite scars ran across decks and engine ribs, and rifles lay in piles near doors where men had tried to bail and failed. He stepped around bodies and counted magazines and batteries, and he cut bandoliers free with a knife that needed new edge for later. Mack joked about gourmet meals to keep air moving, and Sarge told him to breathe through his nose and keep moving because jokes did not scrub the stink.

Assault men dragged captured crates to a pit and dumped them in when inventory showed junk, and he watched good food sink because orders mattered more than appetite. The medics stapled a scalp on a man who could still carry ammunition, and they stepped over others who grabbed at sleeves and begged. He thought about those hands for a breath and wiped his barrel and moved on because the lane still needed eyes and trigger. Demo set more dual time fuses in deeper tunnels, and the ground shivered later while the squad ate crackers and waited for the dull thumps.

Another group tried to climb through the central trees in small packets, and airbursts shredded the leaves and sent shards into backs and necks until movement stopped. Machine guns raked anything that twitched, and mortars walked side to side over the same patch until no shape kept height above mud. He saw a boy crawl with one arm and drag a radio, and he put a round through the box and the hand because gear matters more than pity here. The boy rolled and went with eyes open, and the squad moved on without comment because the next lane called.

When the counterattack died across both spurs and the pocket, the net went quiet from their side apart from short bursts that meant unit markers without guidance. He sat under a poncho and cleaned the bolt with a strip of shirt, and he could not get the smell off with solvent. Sarge came by with a list and a map and pointed to a line where we would repeat the work until the road chain snapped again. He stood up because the task was simple and ugly and not finished, and he picked up his pack and rifle and walked.

On the report he marked what they had done in terms a clerk would understand, and he left out it felt because no paper should carry it. Imphal Gate stayed on the map with a line where the road used to run, and the wall hardened with rain until men detour forever. Command sent a note that companies were inbound to occupy and that we would step forward the next choke without pause. He breathed through cloth that tasted of oil and smoke and told himself the message was simple and true, approach a human line and your army disappears.

1ns01v4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ns01v4/mf_dirt_and_light_2_of_2/,[MF] Dirt and Light (2 of 2),"—Chapter 6– 

Three officers stood at a distance that allowed them time to draw their guns if needed, but their body language indicated no concern. Two of them had their thumbs in the arm holes of their vests and the third, a female officer, had a pen and notepad on which she scribbled intermittently.

“Do you know anyone who might have been angry at him? Did he piss anyone off lately?”

“No. I only met him once.” Sidd replied. Ben silently shook his head in agreement. A runner passed under the bridge, unwavering from her marked lane on the path.

Kay sat on a rock next to the creek. “And how about you, ma’am?”. 

“No. Never even heard of him.”

“Ok. Well stay away from Monument until the scene is cleared up. And let us know if you do hear any rumors. You can come to the station or call this number.” The officer walked to the creek and handed her business card to Kay.

The three officers walked down the path and up the concrete ramp to their cruisers on the road.

“Guy was a fucking prick anyway.” Sidd said.

Kay looked at Sidd, “When are you going to stop hoarding?” 

“Take it easy, kid. I only have enough for tonight and I don’t have money to get more right now.”


—Chapter 7–

Ben woke up baking. It must have been late in the morning because the sun was blasting his sleeping bag where he normally would have been shielded from its intensity. The inside nylon was darkened by sweat from any part of his body that was unclothed, and the right side of his forehead felt stiff and stung a bit. He lay on his side and looked over at Sidd’s shoes protruding from an A-framed tarp that was still under the shady part of the bridge. 

When he sat up he was startled to see Kay just a few feet away from him, knees to her chest, chewing on her thumbnail. 

“Are you ok?”

Her voice was almost inaudible. “Wh.. what do you think they want?”

“What?”

She rubbed her forearm quickly, trying to warm herself. “I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know. They don’t need to be here I told them they didn’t need to but they didn’t listen and now I feel like they might never leave and it’s not even my fault I told them to go.” Her face winced as if she was about to cry.

“Hey. You’re ok. There’s no one here but me and Sidd. You’re gonna be ok.”

Kay’s eyes had been trained straight ahead, but they snapped to Ben when he said this. “Yeah. Ok. Yeah.” She started nodding subtly and drew a deep breath into her lungs. “Yeah. You’re right. It’s alright. It’s ok.” She reached into her sweatshirt pocket and pulled out something so small that he wasn’t sure if it was anything at all. She put her hand to her mouth and pursed her lips. 

“I need food. Do you want to come with me?”

Kay nodded and they both stood up together. He held on to her upper arm as they started down the path. They walked a quarter mile before taking a ramp up to one of the main throughways of the city, a four lane road lined with car dealerships and car washes and gas stations and drive-thru restaurants. Kay didn’t say anything during the walk, but she seemed to be coming back to normal by the time they reached the road.

They walked into a chain donut shop and the small bell chimed as they came through the door. Ben could taste particles of ground coffee and the thick sensation of suspended sugar in the air. Two of seven tables were separately occupied by individuals who were each looking at their respective newspapers and there was no line.

“Hi. What can I get you?” The lady at the counter feigned politeness, but Ben could see her face was doubtful that this was going to be a seamless transaction. She glanced nervously down the counter at her coworker operating the microwaves.

Kay pointed. “Uhhh. Can we get two of those chocolate things?” 

“Get something for Sidd too.” Ben interrupted.

“Three chocolate things.” 

The lady fetched three chocolate glazed donuts and placed them in a bag. She returned to the register and kept the bag on her side of the counter. “That’ll be $5.85.”

Kay looked at Ben. He reached into his jacket pocket, pulled out the tattered roll of quarters and started unwrapping the cylinder. The bell chimed as a man came through the door and got in line behind them. Ben tallied the quarters from a pile on the counter, accumulating the whole batch, and then handed a fistful of coins to the lady. She then proceeded to repeat the process in her hands.

“This is only $4.75. You need another dollar ten.” Ben looked back, there were three people in line behind them now.

“Can you give us a break?” Kay asked.

“No.”

“It’s a dollar. We’re starving.”

“Ma’am, there are other customers waiting. You can either pay or leave.”

Ben’s heart was racing and his face was flush. He looked back again at the people in line. The man behind him tightened his lips above his upper teeth and raised his eyebrows in an expression that said “you’re an asshole, but leave me out of it.” 

The donut lady stared at Ben.

“Ok, just take one of the donuts out,” said Kay.

The lady proceeded to remove one of the donuts from the bag and throw it into the trash below the coffee carafes to her right. “$3.90”.

She handed Ben back three of his quarters and then a dime from the register, along with the wax coated bag which now had chocolate smeared on one edge of the opening. They turned to leave and Ben stared at the floor as he passed the receiving line that had assembled all the way to the door.

When they got outside, Ben pulled out a donut and handed the bag to Kay. “We didn’t get anything for Sidd.”

“Fuck Sidd. That guy can eat shit.”

“What’s going on with that? I thought you guys hung out.”

“We did. But he’s dead to me.”

They started walking back to the path.

“You got high with us last night. With him last night.”

“Yeah…I gotta do what I gotta do until I have a better option.”

“Why are you mad at him?”

“Because he let Wes drug me.” 

“What? Sidd wouldn’t do that.”

“The other night, me and him and Wes were getting loaded in Wes’s camp. The last thing I remember was Sidd saying he needed to go take a piss. I woke up the next morning in Wes’s tent with my pants around my ankles and Sidd gone.”

Ben didn’t say anything. He was sick to his stomach. The half-eaten donut in his hand suddenly felt intrusive and filthy.

“Don’t get awkward. You really think this is my first time getting jacked out here?”

“No. I just. Uh. I dunno. I just can’t imagine Sidd knew…”

“You don’t know Sidd.”

They walked in silence the rest of the way back. When they got to the camp, Sidd was gone.


— Chapter 8–

The pawn shop owner’s indifference disoriented Ben as he stood at the glass counter. Ben had spent 15 minutes outside working himself up, playing through dozens of different paths the conversation could take. 

“What do you mean ‘no’?”

“No. Take it elsewhere.”

“You haven’t even looked at it.”

“I don’t need to see it.”

“Can you tell me why you won’t take this?”

The owner put his pen down on his notepad and looked up at Ben with chastising eyes. His fat face, short grey beard, and bald head embodied a long career that had contained dozens, or perhaps hundreds, of this exact conversation.

“You have no idea how this works. And if I pick up that phone your day isn’t going to get any better. Get your stolen piece of shit revolver out of my store before I call the police.”

Ben got dizzy. He looked up above the man behind the counter to see a security camera pointed right at his face. Then he looked around to see half a dozen cameras around the store, each capturing a straight-on view upon discovery. The man picked up his pen and continued writing his note.

Ben walked out and around to the back of the building where he found a stack of milkcrates and took one to sit down on.

How was he going to sell it? Was he supposed to just walk up to someone and say “want to buy a gun?”. As a kid, he’d read about how art thieves had an impossible time finding a buyer without outing themselves or creating a trail of people who would inevitably point back to them as the original sinner. As a result of the risks, many stolen pieces of art were either destroyed or remained unsold. 

Nobody on the street had money to buy something like this anyway. If at any point they did, that money had long ago changed from solid to liquid to gas, only to recirculate back into the breezes, and gales, and jetstreams of global commerce. He’d have to find someone who he could trust, who had money, and who needed a gun they couldn’t just buy legally at the gun store. This subset of the population was non-existent as a result of his social position.

The futility of the situation had smothered his cautious excitement with the gun into hollow frustration, and what he had assumed would be a two day task was potentially turning into an infinite liability. He considered for a moment throwing it in the creek and just being done with it.

After a few minutes, he placed the gun back into the inside pocket of his black cotton duck jacket, stood up, and headed toward camp.


—Chapter 9–

The presence of others always made the act less pathetic. If he was alone, he felt like a wounded animal at the mercy of an infection that would eventually dissolve him into the earth. But when he was with a group, it was a social act and the burden of justification was lightened significantly. In fact, sitting out required its own justification and the dark vacuum in front of him worked in concert with the social pressure behind him to remove all obstacles to forward progress toward the needle.

So it was with a sense of ease that Ben sat with Sidd and an unnamed new face next to a small fire near the highway overpass on the edge of town. The man was fifteen to twenty years older than Sidd and Ben, and had intersecting canyons across his face representing decades of scars and sun damage that come with being on the street so long. He had yet to say anything beyond a few grunts since Ben had arrived, but his dark eyes projected a focused malevolence Ben had only seen a few times on the street. He wore what looked like three or four layers of clothes, with each article covering up where the previous layer had disintegrated. These types of clothing arrangements seemed to be worn with little regard for the temperature or weather.

“Are we doing this or what?” This was the first constructed sentence Ben had heard from the man in ten minutes of sitting.

“Yeah. Just give it a bit. Kay was supposed to be here by now.”

Sidd started prepping as Ben collected a few sticks to throw on the fire. Ben entered the trees and returned three times before Kay showed up.

She walked up the dirt path and into the rocky clearing. “Sorry. But why the fuck did we have to come all the way out here?” 

“The police have been looking for excuses to fuck with people since that guy died up at Monument. We needed to get some space.” 

“And who the fuck is this?”

“Take it easy kid. This is Marco. He’s a friend. No need to get worked up.”

Marco looked at Kay and said nothing.

Sidd handed Marco a syringe, and started to prep another. Ben sat at attention, feeling his heart rate pick up and his limbs get warmer.

“Kay, you’re next. While I do this, grab my bag.” Sidd’s bag was leaning against a tree near the edge of the clearing. Kay rolled her eyes, turned, and walked towards his bag. 

Ben was intently watching Sidd, anticipating his eventual turn to receive the offering. The discolored spoon forced a blue flame to turn yellow and melt upward, flowing along the ovoid surface. The white powder ceased to exist, transferring its magic power to the water in which it had previously formed a tiny white volcanic island. The amber concoction flowed into the barrel of the syringe, seemingly multiplying its volume by stretching its shape to fill the reservoir.

But then Sidd did something Ben had not seen before in the hundreds of times he’d watched this ritual. Sidd turned his upper body away from Kay’s direction and pulled a small vial out of his pocket. He pierced the septum lid with the needle and pulled an additional twenty percent of liquid into the syringe. He capped the needle, shook it twice, and turned back toward the fire.

Kay walked back from the edge of the clearing carrying Sidd’s bag. 

“You’re up.” Sidd held the capped mixture up toward Kay and looked down at his toolkit, getting oriented for creating Ben’s dose next.

Kay walked toward Sidd but glanced at Ben on her way. She started to turn her head back to Sidd but then snapped back to Ben. He was frozen. He felt his face muscles tense up and cool air bite at the newly exposed edges of his eyeballs. His mouth was agape just enough to show a quarter inch gap between his upper and lower teeth. The terror must have been evident on his face, because Kay stopped in her tracks with one hand holding Sidd’s bag and the other stretched just short of the syringe. Ben felt his head shake slightly and briefly as he stared at her.

“What?”

Ben didn’t say anything. He only looked at the syringe, and then back to her. Confusion gave way to concern in her expression, and then to inquisition. She looked back at the syringe, then connected eyes with Sidd. Then her gaze moved slowly to Marco.

She snapped back to Sidd. “You fucking asshole!” 

Kay dropped Sidd’s bag and reached down to the ground. She picked up a jagged tetrahedron of a rock that filled her entire hand and she threw it at Sidd. Sidd raised his bent arms while holding the needle, but the rock passed above his defenses and crashed across the top of his forehead, tearing a long gash that traversed the boundary between skin and hair.

She ran off down the dirt path and towards the road back to town.

Sidd stood and pressed his forehead with his empty hand. Blood ran down the side of his face, red at his eye but black where the light from the fire could not reach. Marco was hunched in his seat by the fire, indifferent to what had just happened, drifting sideways with his eyes closed. But the intensity that had previously defined his eyes had migrated to Sidd’s, and Sidd looked at Ben with a rage Ben had never seen from his friend. Ben sat and returned the stare with an inferior anger, but anger nonetheless.

The fire popped and sparks spiraled upward between them. Ben stood and walked toward the road.


—Chapter 10–

He found Kay under the bridge, knees to her chest, sobbing into the sleeves of her sweatshirt. She was seated under the amber light bolted to the wall above where he normally slept. He stood on the path just outside of the overpass wondering if he had anything to offer her. He didn’t assume he was starting from a position of full exoneration. 

The clatter of racoons in a dumpster some distance behind him made him look back. The black-washed landscape behind him yielded to outlines of the buildings he knew well from daytime as his eyes adjusted to the darkness. Stars appeared first in hesitation, then with accelerating coverage until the sky was steadily filling in the moonless night.

“That would have been the fourth time in three months.”

He turned back toward the bridge to see Kay looking at him. 

“I thought it was a random thing.”

Ben, sensing where he’d been categorized in Kay’s mind, entered under the bridge and sat down next to her against the concrete abutment. 

“I’m sorry. If I’d have known, I would have done something.”

Kay rested her head against his shoulder and Ben looked at her in mild surprise. She stared across the path at the black creek that was bubbling softly in the dark. He felt his entire torso burst with an anxious warmth and then a chill ran up the center of his back.

“I left home to escape this. It keeps finding me. I just want it to end. I’m so tired.” 

She closed her eyes and he saw a tear cling to the inside corner of her eye for as long as it was able to. It finally lost its grip and rolled down her nose to the corner of her mouth. 

He slowly rocked his head back against the wall and looked down his nose at the creek, his arms propped on his knees and his hands folded to keep the entire structure in place. Have you heard of Schopenhauer’s “hedgehog’s dilemma?”

“Hmmmm.” She let out a quiet, airy non-commital acknowledgement that something was said.

“It’s the idea that hedgehogs need to huddle close together for warmth. But their spines are sharp and hurt others, and that forces them to keep their distance. They want to be close but they can’t.”

He paused and forced a silence. She was breathing deeply and her body had become heavier against his shoulder. He held guard over her for as long as he could stay awake. It was the first time in as long as he could remember that he’d felt any meaning.


—Chapter 11–

He woke up and then the pain hit him. Or he was awoken by the pain. He moved his hand toward the cramp in his ribcage and the pain traveled from his ribs to his hand. He pulled his hand away from the burning area to stop the transfer, but it persisted like the aftermath of having touched a hot stove. He held his hand in front of his face to find the knuckles between his fore and middle fingers split by an inch-long gash. Blood covered his hand.

He looked up to see Sidd standing over him. 

Ben rolled onto his back, placed both palms on the ground, and kicked as far backwards as he could. His body formed a chamfer between the ground and the wall of the bridge’s abutment, with his head and shoulders against the hard concrete wall. Sidd jammed a knee down on Ben’s thighs, forcing them sideways to the ground.

As Sidd raised the knife, Ben reached with both hands in a desperate bid for control, creating a bloody cocoon of fingers. Sidd tried to swap the knife to his other hand, but breaking the dry connection between his palm and the tang allowed for the surfaces to become lubricated with blood. He lost grip of the knife and it fell somewhere into the tumult.

Ben reached up and tried to grab Sidd’s throat with his uninjured hand, but the blood made it impossible to hold anything confidently and he couldn’t inflict a level of pain that might slow the chaos. Sidd leaned forward and repeatedly drove his elbow into Ben’s face, each impact an inelastic crash of ulna, skull, and concrete.

Ben was starting to pass out. One arm attempted defense without any confidence, while his injured hand drifted to the ground to stop him from rolling over from the cumulative blows. As he reached for the stability of the ground, he was startled to feel the cold metal of the revolver laying next to him, ejected from his jacket pocket during the struggle. A searing pain came with the motion of wrapping his hand around the grip. He placed his middle finger on the trigger and held the gun with his lesser two fingers, his forefinger pointed along the trajectory of the barrel. He put the gun in Sidd’s chest as he received one final elbow to the face, and he pulled the trigger.

Sidd became a weighted blanket. Warmth flowed down Ben’s chest, slowing its progress as it soaked into his jeans, pleasant at first in the cold dawn, but then filthy as it marked Ben in its culpatory residue. Ben lay there with Sidd on him for a moment. His body felt broken everywhere. His breath was coming back to him, and with it a global rush of agony.

The pain, the ringing in his head and the darkness of his swollen eyes brought the entire world inside. But parts of his environment started trickling back in through his senses. He felt a fist-sized rock pressing into his kidney. He tasted metal in his mouth and felt with his tongue a jagged remnant where an incisor used to be. He heard Kay crying. 

Having seen Sidd get shot, god knows what she was going through at that moment. Shit, what if Sidd attacked her first while he was asleep? Ben needed to make sure she was ok. But something about her cries felt wrong. He’d have expected her to be hysterical whether in pain or grief. But she sounded far away. Her expressions weren’t frantic. She was speaking softly, consolingly, in between involuntary gasps.

He rolled Sidd’s body off him and squared himself against the wall. Kay had her hands loosely cupped over her mouth crouching next to a formation of river rocks, facing into the creek. But the longer he looked at her, the stranger the rocks became. He slowly got to his feet and shuffled toward her holding his ribs. 

Next to Kay lay the body of a young girl. Her face half submerged in the frigid water, one shoulder below the surface with the corresponding arm tucked under her body. The shorter, wispy blonde hairs at the edge of her scalp transitioned to bright red as they approached a half-inch hole behind her left ear, and the creek washed away the blood faster than it could run down the back of her neck. She wore a microfiber shirt that had been screen-printed with the letters “RCHS XC” on the back. 

Ben looked at Kay. She didn’t look up. After realizing she wouldn’t, he turned around and crossed the path back towards his stuff. Sidd’s backpack was lying next to the revolver, amid a yard sale of items that included the knife and blood that had previously belonged to Ben but was now forming a red cakey mud on the ground. He picked up the backpack and eased it over the shoulder opposite his stab wounds. Looking back at Kay one last time, he saw her with her phone to her ear, silently crouched next to the girl’s body.

He worked his way along the path for a few minutes. Every half-step sent a lightning bolt of pain from his ribs down to his hip. His back was warmed by the early sun, and his right foot was warmed by a steady drip of blood that ran down his leg and was soaked up by his sock.  He’d only made it about 100 yards from his original camp when he came to the next bridge crossing the path. The line of sunlight cut off by the bridge worked its way from his head down to his feet over the course of six steps and he entered the cold shade of the overpass. He sat down against the new abutment and looked at his cleaved palm. He kicked off his shoe, spilling a smaller than expected amount of blood onto the pavement, and then peeled his sock from his foot.

Reaching for Sidd’s bag, he slowly unzipped the main compartment. Inside was a canvas kit that unrolled when he pulled at the flat fabric ribbon holding it together. There, restrained by elastic loops was a remaining syringe with an orange cap, which he removed with some effort from his uninjured hand. He exhausted the supply between his toes. A cool spirit flowed up his leg and through his hip until it diffused throughout his body. He heard a faint siren as he melted into darkness and the world closed around him.

-

He was five again, in his first childhood home. His mother sat next to him on the edge of his bed and his father stood smiling at the doorway. The blanket was familiar. It smelled faintly of lavender soap as it brushed the bottom of his nose. 

He felt a relaxed heaviness drop in his chest, pulling him down into the bed, as he looked into his mother’s eyes. He turned to the side and made his body as tight and small as he could to warm up quickly under the covers. She pushed his hair back and kissed him lightly on his forehead, then quietly stood and walked out of the room. His father turned off the lightswitch and left the door slightly cracked behind them. 

A beam of light from the hallway cut through the door opening, along the floor, and across his room. It hit the wall and turned sharply upward. He looked at the strip of carpet where the light fell, highlighting a scratchy but embracing surface on which he spent many evenings playing before bed, and he became drowsy. His heartbeat thudded at a diminishing rate as he felt the cold air pass through his nose. His eyes closed and he slept.

The cursor blinks with an almost moral patience, a tiny metronome that keeps time for thoughts that are late to their own rehearsal. Sometimes it feels like a lighthouse for ships that might exist but refuse to announce themselves.

Thirty-something guy here, equal parts earnest and skeptical of his own earnestness, wanting sentences that feel like the thought itself rather than a performance of the thought. The plan, if it can be called that, is to leave a little space where honesty has room to breathe without hyperventilating. It helps if the words arrive as an actual message and not a small parade with confetti.

Looking to share snippets of life, one email at a time, the kind that travel light and still arrive with something human. Not chasing volume so much as the clean click of a note that earns its keep. Length is welcome when it buys depth; less welcome when it confuses motion with meaning.

A good paragraph shows up carrying a fact, a feeling, or a live question. Five paragraphs that unpack and repack the same suitcase can stay at the curb. Humor is invited, preferably the kind that lifts an eyebrow at the right second and then quietly pretends it was not trying to be funny at all.

Expect the ordinary seen at a slightly skewed angle. The third sip of coffee turns out to be the most honest one, a sentence in a book insists on being reread because the first pass only caught the nouns, a silence reveals itself as attention that forgot to make noise. If repetition shows up, let it bring something small and true on the second lap.

Quality over quantity is the rhythm rather than a rule; pauses are part of the music and not evidence that the instrument is broken. If a message needs room, it will get room; if not, the compact honesty of a clean line is its own hospitality. If this sounds like the right tempo, send a few lines and a detail that could not belong to anyone else, like the sentence that made last week survivable or the chipped mug that makes tea taste like a promise kept.

I want someone who’s excited to go on adventures with me—whether that’s trying a new restaurant, visiting a museum, or traveling to the other side of the world. Someone my cats will curl up with. Someone I can spoil with flowers or surprise pastries. Someone who loves both deep conversations and playful banter. Someone who enjoys a little affectionate teasing as we pass each other in the kitchen.

I’m looking for a partner who will hold my hand, trade off being the big spoon and little spoon, and inspire me to be a better person for them.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

1nrzxyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1nrzxyt/should_you_buy_the_best_counterdepth_refrigerator/,Should you buy the best counter-depth refrigerator GE GYE18JYLFS,"The GE GYE18JYLFS refrigerator is a sleek, modern appliance I recently tried out, and I was pretty impressed by its thoughtful design and functionality. This one comes with a counter-depth profile, and its 17.5 cubic feet capacity feels perfect for a moderately sized family. I initially chose this refrigerator because of its stainless steel, fingerprint-resistant finish—a feature you'll really appreciate if you're not into constantly wiping down your appliances. With two young kids who seem to have sticky fingers at all hours of the day, this design choice was both practical and lifesaving.

**Design and Aesthetics**  
A refrigerator's design matters just as much as its function. The GE GYE18JYLFS fits that description perfectly with its compact 33-inch width, making it ideal for smaller kitchens or homes where space is at a premium. The counter-depth design ensures it sits flush with your cabinetry, giving your kitchen a clean, integrated look. We recently renovated our kitchen, and I appreciated how seamlessly it blended into the surroundings. The LED lighting inside deserves extra credit, providing crisp, clear visibility of every nook and cranny. Even late-night fridge raids feel inviting under such pleasant lighting.

**User Convenience**  
GE packed this fridge with numerous features aimed at making life a little easier. The external controls with a child lock and door alarm are a dependable touch for anyone with kids like mine, who think refrigerators are vending machines. Then there’s the Quick Space shelf, which cleverly adjusts to accommodate taller items—like that ridiculously tall iced coffee bottle I can’t live without. I have also found the space-saving icemaker to be a real gem. Positioned on the door, it frees up internal storage space and keeps everything organized.

[Find the best price for GE GYE18JYLFS on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b0bnzcsn18/)  

**Advantages**  
- The stainless steel exterior is truly fingerprint-resistant and easy to maintain.  
- The Turbo Cool and Turbo Freeze settings ensure optimal food freshness during heavy usage.  
- I love the two humidity-controlled drawers; they keep my produce fresh longer than my previous fridge ever did.  
- The advanced water filtration system removes 98% of select pharmaceuticals from water and ice.  
- There’s a Shabbos-compatible mode for users who require this functionality.  

**Disadvantages**  
- The freezer space, although well-organized with two-tier baskets, feels a bit limiting for someone like me who freezes a lot of leftover meals.  
- It’s relatively compact at 17.5 cubic feet, so it might not be ideal for larger households.  
- This refrigerator does make occasional faint humming noises, though nothing disruptive.  

**Performance and Efficiency**  
Performance-wise, this refrigerator gets top marks. The Turbo Freeze and Turbo Cool settings are absolutely fantastic for maintaining temperatures when the fridge is loaded after a grocery run. I noticed this especially after a party, where frequent opening and closing didn’t affect cooling. Energy efficiency is equally commendable. Its ENERGY STAR certification provides peace of mind, knowing it won’t inflate your electricity bills. My prior model was far more energy-hungry, so this fridge’s balance between performance and energy use is a significant upgrade.

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing it to other French-door refrigerators like Samsung’s RF23A9671SR or LG’s LFCS27596S, this appliance holds its own despite its compact size. Samsung’s model offers slightly more storage, but its exterior has proven harder to clean. LG, on the other hand, comes with InstaView, which is exciting, yet it’s more about aesthetic appeal than practicality. Both competitors edge slightly ahead when it comes to freezer space, though, so if freezer capacity is a top concern, you might want to weigh your options carefully.

**Cost-Efficiency**  
Given its advanced features and compact size, the GE GYE18JYLFS justifies its price tag. It’s not just about surface-level features—it’s the little design touches like spill-proof shelves, thoughtful freezer baskets, and gallon door storage that make it feel worth the investment. Considering how much time I now spend thinking about things like energy usage and food freshness with my hectic schedule, this refrigerator strikes the right balance between quality and economy.

It's been rough. Yes, I've done all the important steps and I'm blocking every number they use to try to contact me (might change my number). 

However, I'm not going to let the fear own me. No pictures are released and they likely won't be. So, today I'm going to a coffee shop to work on homework, just like a normal Saturday. Later tonight I have a date planned and I will not be canceling that. I will go out with friends, I will keep my routine, I WILL LIVE MY LIFE!

I know the fear is immense. I'm right there with you. But you don't have to be alone even if you can't tell the people in your life. I called 988 (suicide prevention and crisis). I called the California-Teen-Helpline (they were happy to talk to me even though I'm not a teen and not in California). Between the two of them I talked for five hours... My police gave me the contact info for a free, 24-hour crisis therapy office that I have been to twice. There are resources to help you navigate this. You don't have to be alone.

I'm writing this mostly because well... it's easier to do it together. Let's keep living our lives together. Take a shower, fix your hair, walk your dog, go on the date, live your life.

1nrzuug,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nrzuug/delve_into_best_espresso_machines_with_delonghi/,Delve Into Best Espresso Machines with DeLonghi La Specialista,"Crafting the perfect cup of espresso at home feels more satisfying when the right tools are at hand. Enter the De'Longhi 2c0e25b9 La Specialista Espresso Machine, a device touted for its user-centric design, precision, and versatility. I've spent weeks incorporating this machine into my daily espresso routine, putting it through its paces to know if it's truly worthy of its accolades. As someone who takes coffee-making as seriously as my morning caffeine kick, I aimed to explore every feature this machine offers—from grinding to milk frothing—and everything in between.

**Design and Build Quality**

One of the first things I noticed about this espresso machine was just how sleek and modern it looks. Built with a compact and stylish framework, it fits perfectly on my counter without overwhelming the space. For those with smaller kitchens, this is a significant plus because bulky appliances can feel intrusive. The brushed metal accents give it a premium appearance, while the detachable and dishwasher-safe parts reflect how much thought was put into user convenience. Cleaning up after a messy latte art session usually feels like a chore, but not with this machine—it makes maintenance surprisingly simple.

**Performance That Stands Out**

If performance makes or breaks an espresso machine, this one certainly leans towards “makes.” The inbuilt conical burr grinder grabbed my attention with its eight grind settings, catering to different coffee bean varieties for impeccable flavor extraction. It showed its precision every single time, grinding consistently whether I needed a single or double dose. This machine doesn’t just churn out coffee; it elevates the entire brewing process to deliver results brimming with aroma and flavor. 

**My Latte Art Wand: A Fun Touch for Creativity**

The My Latte Art wand deserves its own spotlight. I’ve had my share of frustrating, overly hot milk frothers that were difficult to handle. This wand not only remains cool-to-the-touch post-steaming but also produces remarkably silky microfoam. My once-mediocre attempts at latte art have drastically improved; I even caught myself sharing my ‘masterpieces’ on social media because the foam texture was that good. For any home barista, this feature feels like an added layer of creativity that keeps brewing exciting.

[Check De'Longhi 2c0e25b9 La Specialista price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0ctktfgl1/)

**Temperature Precision and Control**

A critical selling point of this espresso maker is its active temperature control. Different coffee beans reveal their flavors at distinct water temperatures, and the three infusion temperature levels allow you to experiment effortlessly. Once I found the ideal setting for my favorite medium roast beans, the consistency was spot-on. Temperature fluctuations can sometimes ruin a great cup, but the precision here ensured brew after brew hit the mark. If you've ever been disappointed by flavor inconsistencies, this feature alone could seal the deal.

**Favorable Attributes**

- The eight grind settings offer a level of precision rarely found in machines at this price range.
- Its sleek, compact design is perfect for small kitchens but doesn’t skimp on aesthetics.
- The My Latte Art wand creates silky, café-quality milk foam ideal for creative latte designs.
- Dishwasher-safe, detachable parts simplify cleanup routines and save time.
- The active temperature control adapts easily to different beans, unlocking full flavors.

**Areas of Concern**

- The initial setup, especially calibrating the grinder, can be slightly intimidating for beginners.
- Comparatively, the steaming process for milk feels slower than some rival machines in its category.
- While compact, it lacks enough built-in storage for the included barista tools.

**Competitive Options**

In the world of bean-to-cup espresso machines, this one competes heavily with models like the Breville Barista Express and the Jura ENA 8. Compared to the Breville, this machine edges out in user-friendliness with its easier maintenance routine. However, the Breville steams milk noticeably quicker. The Jura ENA 8, while sleek and stylish, comes at a significantly higher price point and sacrifices manual espresso craftsmanship for automation. For those who enjoy the process of hands-on coffee-making, the De'Longhi model strikes a better balance between features and affordability.

**Bang for the Buck**

Evaluating its price-to-quality ratio, this machine feels like a worthwhile investment. While it’s not entry-level, its features justify the cost for anyone serious about their home coffee game. Unlike some less expensive models skimping on grinder quality or temperature control, this one offers customization and performance normally seen in higher-end machines. It might not be for someone entirely new to using espresso makers, but as an upgrade, it hits the sweet spot between affordability and professional-grade functionality.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Memphis Tigers vs. Florida Atlantic Owls: A Feast for the Eyes (and a Famine for the Owls)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a showdown that’s as lopsided as a toaster trying to eat a waffle. The Memphis Tigers (4-0, 8-game win streak) are set to host the Florida Atlantic Owls (1-3, 1-3 in their last three) in a game that’s less of a contest and more of a math problem. Let’s break it down with the precision of a quarterback who never turns his head.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Memphis is the Statistical Certainty

The numbers scream “Memphis, baby!” louder than a fan wearing a “This is the Best Team Ever” shirt at a family reunion. The Tigers are installed as **-14.0 favorites** across most books, with implied probabilities hovering around **89%** (thanks to those -140 odds). For context, that’s the confidence level of a vending machine that’s never given short change.

Florida Atlantic? They’re priced at **+5.3**, which translates to a **15.6% chance** to pull off the upset. To put that in perspective, it’s less likely than your Uncle Bob remembering to bring his own cup to the coffee shop. The spread of **14 points** is so steep it could double as a rollercoaster, and Memphis’s 44-game streak of scoring at least 20 points? That’s the kind of consistency that makes even the most optimistic FA fan question their life choices.

### Digesting the News: Memphis Brings the Heat, FA Brings the Excuses

Let’s start with the **Memphis Tigers**, a team that’s playing like they’ve got a 10-lb sack of cashews in their pockets (because they’re about to cash in on this game). Their running back, **Sutton Smith**, is a beast, racking up 147 yards against Arkansas and earning national honors. Meanwhile, their defense, led by **Ray Coney** (49 tackles, more than most people’s monthly TikTok followers), has been a sieve for opponents… a sieve that only lets in water *after* it’s already lost the race.

Now, the **Florida Atlantic Owls**. Let’s be kind: They’re like a GPS that keeps sending you to the

How to Lovingly Engage with Friends Who Don’t Share Your Worldview
==================================================================

Have you ever found yourself in a room full of people who see the world differently than you do? Picture this: you’re enjoying coffee with friends, and the conversation turns to values and beliefs. As they express their views, you realize your perspectives don’t align. Instead of creating a divide, this can be an opportunity for growth and understanding.

Valuing Diversity While Staying True
------------------------------------

Diversity in thought and belief is part of God’s creation. The Bible reminds us in 1 Peter 3:15 to be prepared to give a reason for the hope we have but to do so with gentleness and respect.

- **Embrace Humility**: Recognize that everyone is on a unique journey. Your friends’ experiences and beliefs have been shaped by different paths.
- **Be Respectful**: Show respect by listening actively. James 1:19 urges us to be quick to listen and slow to speak, fostering genuine dialogue.

Building Bridges through Love
-----------------------------

Engaging in conversations about differing worldviews doesn’t have to be contentious. Love, as emphasized in 1 Corinthians 13, is patient and kind—qualities essential in meaningful discussions.

- **Practice Empathy**: Walk in their shoes by considering their feelings and perspectives. This approach can open doors to understanding.
- **Share Your Story**: Express how your faith shapes your life. Stories are powerful connectors and offer insights into who you are.

Staying Grounded in Faith
-------------------------

Standing firm in your faith while embracing diversity is possible. Jesus engaged with people from all walks of life, always rooted in love and truth.

- **Lean on Scripture**: The Bible is a source of wisdom and strength. Philippians 4:13 inspires confidence that you can engage lovingly with others.
- **Pray for Guidance**: Prayer is vital in seeking the Holy Spirit’s guidance to navigate conversations gracefully and wisely.

Reflect and Respond
-------------------

Think about a time when you found common ground with someone who had different beliefs. What helped bridge the gap? How did love and respect play a role?

Use the comments to share your experiences and insights. How do you lovingly engage with friends who don’t share your worldview?

Conclusion: Love as the Guiding Principle
-----------------------------------------

In conclusion, engaging lovingly with those who don’t share your worldview is a transformative experience. You learn more about yourself and deepen your relationships through humility, respect, and love.

**Call to Action**: Reflect on your current interactions with diverse viewpoints. Could you incorporate more empathy and love? Share your thoughts and stories below. Let’s learn from each other and grow together.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I just need to get this all out into the void before I explode and I’m hoping someone that’s lived it may be able to help me.

I’ve (26f) been with my fiancé (32m) for 4 years now and we’re set to get married next October. It’s like we were made for each other, he’s the levelheaded & rational one while I’m the erratic spontaneity. We spend multiple hours a night just belly laughing until we can’t breathe. He’s my person & I’m so beyond lucky to have found him. 

We’ve had issues in our relationship, mostly his alcoholism. I’ve stuck by his side through so much that I frankly shouldn’t have had to. (Not what this post is about just backstory to help explain what I’m feeling here) I’m very grateful to say he’s been officially sober since January and I couldn’t be prouder. It’s like we’ve finally had the chance to start our lives together without this thing looming over our heads & we’ve never been a healthier/happier couple. 

Another thing I think is important to add is I’ve been through a lot of loss in my life. I lost my dad at 15 to cancer & my sister at 17 to an OD. My mom’s fiancé died next to her in her sleep and I had to perform CPR on him in the middle of the night (it was unsuccessful) & 2 months into dating my partner we found his stepdad dead of a heart attack alone very unexpectedly. This is just the tip of the iceburg. It’s given me a pretty healthy dose of death ocd (I went through therapy for this) & sometimes I genuinely feel like the angel of death.

Now to get into what’s going on currently, my partner has been having stomach issues for quite a long time. He had stomach surgery 10 years ago to help with weight loss & had some side effects. Mostly issues with stomach acid but has been under control for a few years now with medication. That is until the last 2 months when he randomly started having a whole slew of other stuff happening out of no where.

At first it was nausea happening around the same time every day. At first he thought it may be the coffee from the coffee shop he started frequenting, or maybe it was that he was/or was not eating at that time but no matter what we tried to change or adjust it was still happening at around 12-1pm.

Then it was dizzy spells and headaches happening at the same time or randomly throughout the day. Again nothing had changed about his routine/daily habits, he was drinking enough water and taking breaks at work. He wasn’t particularly over stressed either.

He didn’t tell me about these at first as “to not worry me” until he had to because he was worried after he started having random cramping/throwing up blood. He’s the kind of man that wouldn’t go to the hospital if he could duct tape it together. (His mom literally runs a hospital too) I made him make an appointment & went with him.

His GP honestly didn’t sound too concerned & he is an excellent physician. Just wanted to do some blood tests and referred him to gastro just to be on the ‘safe side’. 

Unfortunately I had a dentist appointment I wasn’t able to reschedule for the same day & couldn’t go. I have severe dental anxiety and they basically have to heavily medicate me for appointments. I was so anxiety ridden that I didn’t even check in with him to see how he was feeling for his appointment. I feel awful about it now that I was so in my own head I didn’t check on him.

So both of our appointments get done and normally he’d go back to work and finish out his day after a Dr visit & instead he went home. This honestly should have been the biggest red flag to me. He is the kind of sweet man to call of the rest of his day just to check on me/make sure I’m okay as well so it’s not that out of the ordinary but still.

He was just quiet. Still him just quiet. I immediately asked how his appointment went. He pushes it off and keeps asking how I’m feeling, if I’m sore, etc. I know at this point something’s really wrong but I try not to push to hard, let him come to me in his own time to tell me.

They think he has cancer. 

I held him as he broke. He just found that out and was so worried about me and a stupid fucking tooth. 
I’ve never seen him so scared in my life. I’ve never been more scared in my life. I immediately went into a state of dissociation and just shock. I’m normally the one with all of the nice words to say when people are going through hard shit. The one who comes up with the game plan on what happens next and how to handle the chaos. And I just froze.

It’s like every fear I’ve had since we first got together came flooding to the surface. This is morbid to those who don’t understand but I have replayed every possible way in which he could die just so I’m not caught off guard when it does happen. I know this isn’t healthy which is why I was in therapy for it (& probably should go back now). It’s not as obsessive as it used to be but it’s still kind of like you’re always waiting for the other shoe to drop in life. Everyone dies someday you just gotta hope today’s not that day.

I’m doing a good job of outwardly being strong for him. Being his rock. In reality I’ve been switching between numb and absolutely terrified. I’m only 26, I finally found my person, we finally reached the other side of his alcoholism, I’m supposed to be getting married. This doesn’t feel fucking real.

It’s like Deja vu to everything we went through with my dad. Obviously we don’t have confirmation on anything yet as a guarantee but it’s never a good sign to get expedited to the front of the line medically. Things are moving fast, he has multiple appointments for the next couple weeks as well as procedures. We should know something definitively by the 15th one way or the other.

I realize how “me me me!” This post sounds and I’m sorry. I’m still just trying to wrap my head around things and I just don’t know what to do at this point. I’ve been through this so many times and whatever happens I will get it together but man… I just don’t think I’ll survive having to go through this again. 

I’m trying to not lose it until we know anything definitively but the waiting is excruciating. The not knowing. I can’t eat. My insomnia is back in full swing. It’s like I don’t want the miss a second with him or if I look at him hard enough I’ll be able to see the answer of if he has it or not. I know I need to take care of myself but I couldn’t give a fuck less to right now.

We’re keeping it under wraps until we know definitively but I need somebody to tell me what to do. I shouldn’t be this lost I’ve lived it before just never with a partner. I thought I’d get through all of the bad shit; losing my dad, my sister, dragging myself through the depths of fucking grief & I’d eventually get my happily ever after. This is a fucking nightmare.
