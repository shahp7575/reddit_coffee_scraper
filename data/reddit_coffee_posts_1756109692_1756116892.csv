I have made an app that is designed to serve you local recommendations based on your input location.

You tell it what you want (coffee) in (city) and it will find the most commented on from reddit [in a positive way], give you Google review based one  and then scan social media for the most 'buzz' for the 3rd

All information is then passed through gemini to write a short summary, provides their website, address and link to relevant reddit discussions 

This is my first app I am rolling out to the play store, and I need 12 beta testers.  Anyone want to contribute?

This app is in English, but works worldwide and especially well in cities with robust reddit communities.

Would love to collaborate and get your feedback!",1,1756116611.0,generativeAI,0,1.0,False

\
Alt text: Professional business people in meeting., nailing down the licensing requirements and renewal cycles could quite literally make or break your operation.\
\
Short Answer: Most Bahrain business licenses—known as Commercial Registrations (CR)—must be renewed annually, but there are important nuances (trust me, I learned this the hard way at the MOICT office when a misplaced Tamkeen receipt delayed my renewal).\
\
Below, I’ll share firsthand insight, step-by-step guidance, current regulatory changes for 2025, and Bahrain-specific tips on keeping your venture compliant, cost-effective, and future-proof.\
\
Bahrain’s Dynamic Business Environment in 2025\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting. reports Bahrain’s non-oil GDP jumped 4.3%, outpacing regional peers. The Economic Development Board (EDB) forecasts foreign direct investment will surpass $1.6B, boosted by streamlined company formation and digital licensing on the Sijilat platform.\
\
Key Locations: Seef District is now the hub for FinTechs, Bahrain Bay attracts consultancies, and Diplomatic Area continues to host multinational headquarters.\
Growth Sectors: Tech, logistics, tourism, health, and green energy.\
\
Compared to UAE or Saudi Arabia, Bahrain’s licensing system is more transparent, and the MOICT offers strong English-language support—reducing the risk of bureaucratic surprises mid-renewal.\
Surprisingly, while neighboring countries push for biannual or even quarterly license check-ins, Bahrain maintains its annual cycle for most business structures, balancing regulatory rigor with operational ease.\
Insider Tip: Majlis-style networking over Arabic coffee in the EDB lounge can speed up licensing queries—relationships often work faster than online ticket systems.\

\
Types of Business Entities and Their License Renewal Cycles\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.\
- Single Person Company (SPC)\
- Branch of a Foreign Company\
- Civil Company\
- Commercial Agency\
- Partnership\
- Sole Proprietorship\
- Free Zone and Offshore Entities*\
Most entities require annual renewal of their Commercial Registration (CR), except for certain professional licenses (e.g., doctors, engineers) which may vary based on regulatory body. For details, see Bahrain business type structures.\
Annual Renewal: The Rule, Not the Exception\
MOICT mandates that most business licenses—including all Sijilat CRs—must be renewed every 12 months. You’ll receive automated reminders by SMS and email, but I recommend setting personal calendar alerts (a lesson learned after missing a mid-Ramadan deadline).\
\
Personal aside: My first renewal as an SPC got delayed over a paperwork mismatch—having physical and digital copies of every approval from LMRA, Tamkeen, and EDB avoided extra trips to the Diplomatic Area branch.\
\
Are There Exceptions?\
\
Free Zone Entities: Must renew licenses annually via the relevant free zone authority (see Bahrain Free Zones), but renewal fees and document requirements can differ.\
Professional Activities: Entities like clinics or consultancies may require additional Ministry-specific renewals (sometimes every 2-3 years).\
Foreign-Owned Companies: No difference in renewal frequency (see foreign ownership rules), but some industries may require extra proof of ongoing activity.\
\
\
The Step-by-Step Renewal Process—with Insider Time and Money-Saving Tips\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation. details\
   - Office lease agreement (valid for at least 12 more months)\
   - Updated passport/CPR copies for all partners/directors\
   - Paid-up receipts for all fee categories (including Tamkeen, LMRA, municipality, etc.)\
   - Proof of compliance (such as VAT filings if registered)\
Insider shortcut: At the Sijilat service center in Seef Mall, staff tend to process CR renewals faster just before lunchtime—queue times drop dramatically. And during Ramadan, aim for the first 2 hours of the morning shift when staff are freshest.\
2. Complete Mandatory Inspections (If Required)\
   - Municipality office will notify for site inspections (mostly for restaurants, retail, clinics)\
   - Not applicable to virtual offices or consultancies\
3. Settle All Outstanding Payments\
   - MOICT licensing fees\
   - Municipality commercial activities fee (ranges from BHD 20–100)\
   - LMRA labor fees, if hiring staff\
4. Submit and Pay Online Via Sijilat\
   - Renewal typically takes 1–2 business days if all documents are correct\
   - Company formation experts can help if issues arise\
Common mistake: Entrepreneurs often forget to renew their office lease agreement on time. This causes the CR renewal to freeze until a new lease is uploaded. Always ensure your lease is valid past your CR expiry date.\
Renewal Timing and Proactive Scheduling\
\
Renew at least 30 days before expiry—MOICT charges late penalties (BHD 20–100+ per month)\
For high-traffic months (post-Ramadan, Q4), start the process 6 weeks before expiry\
Use the Bahrain eGovernment portal for SMS reminders\
\
\
Personal hack: I created a shared Google Calendar for all my clients, setting up automatic renewal reminders and document checklists synced to Sijilat due dates.\
\
\
Cost Considerations: What Does License Renewal Actually Cost in 2025?\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.\
* LMRA labor renewal (if applicable): BHD 72 per expat worker\
* Tamkeen levy: BHD 5–20 per local employee\
* Minor administrative costs (notarization, document translation, etc.): BHD 10–50\
Budget tip: Bundle your renewal with annual accounting/bookkeeping services for a discount, especially if your business needs VAT filings or annual returns.\
Check the complete Bahrain company formation cost guide for a detailed breakdown by entity type.\
\
Regulatory Change for 2025: The Big Shift You Need to Know\
Importantly, as of March 1, 2025, Bahrain introduced a “risk-based” approach for certain industries—meaning high-risk activities (financial services, medical, real estate brokerage) are now subject to randomized mid-year compliance audits. This doesn’t change the annual renewal cycle, but it does mean you’ll need to maintain up-to-date compliance records at all times.\
Implementation detail: Sijilat will auto-flag entities for audit if their VAT or LMRA records are not current during renewal. Keeping all digital copies handy is now non-negotiable.\
\
Tangent: Last month, during a majlis networking event in Bahrain Bay, several entrepreneurs shared war stories about last-minute document scrambles. This led to a new WhatsApp group dedicated to audit-readiness tips—my shortcut: always have summarized compliance folders ready for upload.\
\
\
Business Culture Hacks: Networking, Custom, and Relationship-Building During Renewal\
\
Alt text: Professional business support. to operate reduced hours; book morning slots.\
- Queue-jumping tip: The Seef Sijilat center is quieter on Wednesdays post-lunch compared to crowded Sunday mornings.\
\
Personal challenge: My CR renewal stalled three years ago because I submitted my forms during Eid week—offices closed, key staff away. Now, I calendar all major business actions around the public holiday schedule.\
\
\
Comparing Bahrain With UAE and Saudi Arabia: Why Bahrain Wins\
Unlike Dubai (where trade license renewal can be tied to annual tenancy registration and can cost over $3,000), Bahrain offers:\
- Lower fees (see above)\
- Fewer documentary hurdles\
- Digital-first processing (Sijilat is far smoother than Saudi or UAE equivalents)\
- 90% of activities now open to 99% foreign ownership—see current rules here.\
However, the best advice remains: double-check category-specific renewal requirements. Bahrain’s regulators are supportive, but they expect precision.\
\
Common Mistakes—and How to Avoid Them\
\
Forgetting the office lease: CR renewal is locked until a valid lease is uploaded\
Late municipality payments: Triggers automatic late penalties\
Accepting incomplete receipts from LMRA/Tamkeen: Always ensure receipts are stamped and digital copies saved\
Ignoring compliance updates: Monitor Reuters, Forbes Business, and Bahrain.com for regulatory changes\
\
My workaround: Create a digital dashboard (Google Drive or Dropbox) for every business license—store receipts, compliance logs, and scanned documents by renewal year.\
\
Resources, Tools, and Who Can Help\
From my experience, KeyLink’s Bahrain company formation support is the most reliable for hand-holding through complex renewals, especially if you’re running multiple CRs or managing cross-border filings.\
\
KeyLink Bahrain for full-service renewal and compliance\
Sijilat Portal for self-service renewals\
Bahrain Commercial Registration Guide for document requirements\
\
Professional accounting and legal advisors can save time, but even one strong relationship with a Sijilat desk officer in Seef or Diplomatic Area can mean the difference between a 24-hour and a 3-week renewal.\
\
Practical FAQ: Bahrain Business License Renewal\
Q1: Can I skip renewal if my business is inactive for a while?\
No. Failure to renew your CR automatically triggers late penalties (BHD 20–100/month). If you plan to pause operations, formally suspend the CR with MOICT or risk bigger fines. See commercial registration closing tips.\
Q2: Can foreigners own 100% of a Bahrain business and does this affect renewal?\
Yes, 99% of activities now allow near-full foreign ownership (details). Renewal cycle and fees remain the same regardless of ownership structure.\
Q3: Is local sponsorship required for renewal in Bahrain?\
Not unless your activity specifically demands it (e.g., certain professional or regulatory activities). Most entities avoid the sponsor requirement—see local sponsorship explained.\
Q4: What if I miss the renewal deadline?\
Penalties accrue monthly; after 6+ months of non-renewal, the CR can be suspended or struck off. Immediate action: pay outstanding fees, update documents, and contact MOICT support.\
Q5: Do Free Zone businesses have different renewal cycles?\
Most follow the annual process, but check with your Free Zone authority for specific documentation or fee differences (free zone info).\
\
Final insider suggestion: Don’t leave renewal to the last minute—Bahrain rewards the prepared with speed, efficiency, and a chance to focus on growth rather than bureaucracy. Know your timelines, build local relationships, and always keep that digital document folder up-to-date.\
If you’re planning to form a company or handle renewals, KeyLink Bahrain remains my top recommendation for hands-on support.\

I couldn't try everything I wanted so I promised myself I'll come back for more. Here are the restaurants we tried in KL: it's a mixed bag of local tips, tourist traps, eateries found on Google and so on...



\- **Lai Fong Lala Noodles**: came here for the clams noodles and we weren't disappointed. Broth was great, clams a little on the sweet side for us (Italian clams are more briny I think) but we liked it. Huge portions. We also got the fried bean curd and the fish ball but neither was special.

\- **Ho Kow Hainam Kopitiam**: wow great ambiance! Got here early so queued for less then 5 minutes. Our kopis were among the best of our trip. We weren't particularly hungry so we got kaya butter buns and a pandan cake, but I'd definitely go back for some savoury breakfast dish.

\- **TG's Bistro**: we were craving some murtabak and found this place close to our hotel... didn't know it would be a cultural experience. Hordes of young girls and boys waiting up to one hour for some colossal dosas (called roti tisu / tissue) and then spending the next hour taking pictures. Luckily we got a table, ordered a butter chicken, some naans and a veggie murtabak. Everything was good to great and very short waiting time since we didn't get the coveted roti tissue. I'm sure you can find better Indian food in the city but it was a fun night.

\- **Lot 10 Hutong**: perhaps we went to the wrong stall but the roast duck was very disappointing: cold and  with soft skin. Or perhaps this is how it's supposed to be? First time trying it. Char siu was great though.

\- **Limapulo Terrace**: absolute pinnacle of our culinary trip to KL. And probably an underrated place, since there weren't many people eating there. Best take on the Nyonya food we've had in Malaysia. Wonderful curry and mee goreng. And such a warm service! I talked to the manager because the menu had some Javanese items and wanted to know more. He told me he'd been in Java a long time ago and wanted to offer some of those dishes. I had to try their gado gado since I also spent some time in Java 15 years ago and that flavor brought back some many memories.

\- **Wanjo**: after reading so many reccomendations we had to try it. Great nasi lemak: fragrant rice and the best ikan bilis of our holiday. I did not expect the sambal to be so sweet but loved it anyway. I didn't like the daging rendang though, too tough for my taste. Perhaps I should've stayed on the known path with ayam goreng? Overall a great experience but sorry guys not my favorite nasi lemak in the country.

\- **Nasi Kandar stall at TRX food court**: I know KL is not known for nasi kandar but it was not bad at all. I went for the ""kuah campur"" approach as advised somewhere on Reddit and the curry mix was dope.

\- **Beta KL**: once a year me and my wife try a Michelin one star restaurant and we told ourselves why not in Malaysia? I was a bit sick that night so I couldn't fully appreciate the experience but it was an interesting take on Malysian food and made me discover so many different ingredients, spices, fruits. Excellent cocktails as well. Price in line with Italian Michelin one star restaurants.

\- **LOKL Coffee**: nice little place close to Masjid Jamek. They serve specialty coffees and continental breakfasts if you want a change. Croissant was comparable to some of the best you can find in Italian bars and they had a nice twist on the avocado toast. High prices.

\- **KLCG Confectionery & Bakery**: another place we had no idea would be so popular and busy. We were lucky to get here at 9 AM and get a table with no reservation. Viennoiseries were nothing short of spectacular.

\- **Da Bao Restobar**: only Westerners among customers so I must presume this is not popular among locals, but honestly the food was excellent. We got the fried crab bao and the seared mackerel bao. They were huge and juicy. 

  
Again, from a food standpoint it was a stunning and rewarding trip. At times we felt overwhelmed by the amount of options and not fully grasping what was on offer (especially in market stalls).

Realizing that we truly needed each other, improved each other, helped each other and supported each other. But that like all things, that need was temporary. Blind to the silent killer under the surface, we had a truly beautiful time together. Blissfully unaware of the fact that we both had the same flaw, and that it would catch up to us. It started when the intimacy slowed down, and continued as we slowly lost the ability to communicate. Until finally after years of slowly rising, this isolation reared its ugly head and spoke to both of us. It told us that we had both slowly started to feel alone, and I remember that day and probably always will. You and I, 10 on a Saturday morning, drinking instant coffee and having a cigarette at the front door, finally found the words we’d hid from each other for so long. 

We weren’t happy anymore.

We mutually understood that this must end, but also acknowledged that we were both significantly more developed, mature and able people than we were when we met. I will always owe that to you. Because I know that if I had lost what I just have before I met you, I wouldn’t be here writing this. 

Two ships in the night will always feel bittersweet. Maybe I’ve lost the better half of myself, but that’s okay because you helped shape the other half to survive, to keep moving forward and to love itself, however infrequently and short lived it may be.

This is the worst major airport I've ever been to so far.

1. **It's super crowded and there's a shortage of places where you can sit down/rest.** I literally had a hard time finding a place where people were not swarming. You cannot get to a toilet without waiting like 5 minutes at least in a queue as a guy. Can't imagine what it must be like for women. Also toilets are way too few and far from each other. 

2. **WIFI**. WTF? There's no free wifi (if you try to use it, you get some bullshit error message), you have to go to one of those kiosks where you have to scan your passport to get what's apparently an hour's free wifi. I'm saying 'apparently', bc I haven't managed to do the scanning, and I can tell you I wasn't alone with that. It's a shitty experience.

3. **The prices.** The f\*ck is wrong with you people? 17 EUR for an omelette? 10 EUR for a f\*cking cup of coffee? Are you kidding me? Any major tourist trap in Paris is probably cheaper than that. I'm not new to this, been to a couple of airports, but this was the most shameless ripoff of an airport I've ever seen. 

**Also, euros?** Did you guys become part of the Eurozone overnight? Last time I checked Turkey used lira, not euros. I was baffled to see prices in euros everywhere. 

4. **THAT\_DAMN\_LOUDSPEAKER.** I will have PTSD hearing the word *'LOTFENDIGKET'* or whatever the hell it was. That damn loudspeaker is EVERYWHERE and it never shuts up! It's impossible to listen to a podcast or watch a movie on your phone, or even read a book - which is what people do when they have to wait several hours at an airport - because that damn woman repeats everything in English and Turkish 5 times all the time!

[1.**Buy**](http://1.Buy) **me a coffee** \- This seems like the most realistic method for us right now. I want to share our vision with the general public and give people the chance to support us through small donations. Has anyone here tried community/donation-based support for early-stage tech projects?

2.**Accelerators & Incubators** \- I'm considering applying to **Y Combinator** and **Founder Institute**. At the same time, I know these programs are highly competitive. For those who have joined accelerators/incubators, what was your experience like? Did it make a meaningful difference for your project’s growth and fundraising journey?

3.**Revenue-Based Financing / Venture Capital (VC)** \- This option feels a bit premature for me at this moment, given the current stage of the project. Still, I’d love to hear how others approached VCs or revenue-based financing later on in their startup journey. What worked, what didn’t, and what should a first-time founder know before going down that path?

I’d love to hear your insights or experiences with any of these methods. Since this is my first time in the fundraising world, every bit of advice means a lot 🙏

For a long time, I thought waking up tired, restless nights, and constant yawning during the day were just “normal.” I blamed it on stress, busy schedules, and late-night scrolling. But deep down, I knew something was off. My sleep wasn’t refreshing me.

Instead of just accepting it, I slowly started making small lifestyle changes. Nothing extreme just simple shifts. And honestly, they made a huge difference. Here’s what helped me the most:

Here’s what worked for me (and still does):

**Sleeping on my side** → I noticed that lying on my back made my sleep more disturbed. Training myself to sleep on the side reduced snoring and midnight wake-ups.

**Evening walks** → I never liked heavy workouts at night, but a 20–30 min walk in the evening calms me down and helps me fall asleep faster.

Cutting late-night caffeine & alcohol → I used to think one cup of coffee or a late drink didn’t matter but avoiding them improved the quality of my sleep massively.

**Better bedtime routine** → Instead of scrolling, I started reading or journaling before bed. It sounds cliché, but it really helps my mind slow down.

**Keeping my weight in check** → Even a small change here made me breathe easier at night and feel more rested in the morning.

**Breathing exercises** → Simple nasal breathing and a few minutes of deep breathing before bed made falling asleep smoother.

None of this was an overnight fix but over time, these little changes added up. Now I wake up with more energy, my focus is better, and I don’t feel drained halfway through the day.

**Why I’m Sharing This**

Sleep problems can feel frustrating because they creep into every part of life work, mood, health, even relationships. I learned that while there isn’t always a “quick fix,” small consistent lifestyle changes really do make a difference.

I’d love to hear from you:

1mzm4s3,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1mzm4s3/between_sisters_by_kristin_hannah/,Between Sisters By Kristin Hannah,"Hey there, fellow bookworms and future readers! What's up? I just finished diving headfirst into a truly moving book by Kristin Hannah, and I've been itching to chat about it. If you're like me and sometimes you need a good story that tugs at your heartstrings and makes you think, then you really need to check out [Between Sisters By Kristin Hannah](https://pdfhive.com/between-sisters-by-kristin-hannah/). It was a fantastic read, and I wanted to share my honest thoughts, especially for those of you who might be new to reading or just looking for your next great escape.

**A Quick Peek Without Spoilers!**

So, what's *Between Sisters* all about? Imagine two sisters, half-sisters actually, who were once inseparable but life took them in completely different directions. One, Meghann, is a successful TV news anchor with a seemingly perfect life, while the other, Claire, is a quiet, small-town librarian who lives a much simpler existence. Years of unspoken hurts and different paths have driven a wedge between them. The story really kicks off when a crisis forces them back into each other's lives, making them confront their past, their resentments, and the powerful bond that still ties them together. It's a journey about family, forgiveness, and finding your way back to what truly matters.

**What I Really Dug About This Book**

Kristin Hannah has this magical way with words, you know? Her writing style is so *real* and easy to get lost in. It’s not overly fancy, which I appreciate, but it's incredibly descriptive when it needs to be, especially when it comes to emotions. I found myself completely invested in Meghann and Claire's lives. Hannah crafts characters who feel like people you know – they have flaws, they make mistakes, and you can totally understand why they act the way they do, even if you don't always agree with it.

The pacing was spot on for me. It wasn't a breakneck thriller, but it kept me turning pages because I genuinely cared about what was going to happen next. The emotional depth here is what truly stands out. It's a story that explores difficult family dynamics, the pain of growing apart, and the hard work of reconciliation. I definitely shed a few tears, but there were also moments of hope and warmth that felt so good. If you're a fan of deep emotional dives, this is absolutely for you. I was really captivated by the exploration of second chances and the power of love within a family. You can find out more and maybe even grab a copy here: [Between Sisters By Kristin Hannah](https://pdfhive.com/between-sisters-by-kristin-hannah/).

**Anything I Didn't Quite Vibe With?**

Honestly, it's hard to find major fault with *Between Sisters*. If I had to pick something, perhaps a tiny part of me wished for a slightly less predictable turn in certain areas. But even then, the beauty of this book isn't in shocking twists and turns; it's in the raw, honest portrayal of human relationships and the journey towards healing. It's not a book meant to surprise you with whodunits, but rather to immerse you in a very human experience. So, it's less of a ""dislike"" and more of an observation that the emotional journey takes center stage over plot surprises, which is exactly what it set out to do.

**So, Would I Recommend It? And For Whom?**

Oh, absolutely, 100% yes! I'd recommend [Between Sisters By Kristin Hannah](https://pdfhive.com/between-sisters-by-kristin-hannah/) to anyone who loves a good character-driven story with a lot of heart. If you enjoy contemporary fiction, family dramas, or just a book that makes you *feel* something, then this is a winner. Even if you usually lean towards thrillers or fantasy, but you're looking for something with intense emotional stakes and a compelling journey, this could be a wonderful change of pace. It's a perfect book to curl up with on a rainy afternoon.

**A Little Pep Talk and Guide for New Readers!**

Hey, if you're just getting into reading, or trying to pick up the habit again, welcome! It's an amazing journey. Here are a few friendly tips:

1.  **Start Small:** Don't feel like you have to tackle a massive classic right away. Pick something that genuinely interests you. If this review sounds good, maybe give it a try!
2.  **It's Okay to Quit a Book:** Seriously! If a book isn't grabbing you after a few chapters, put it down. Life's too short to read books you don't enjoy. There are millions out there waiting for you.
3.  **Find Your Genre:** Are you into mysteries? Romance? Fantasy? Sci-Fi? Thrillers? Self-help? Experiment! You might be surprised by what you love.
4.  **Set Aside Time:** Even 15-20 minutes a day can make a huge difference. Before bed, during your commute, or with your morning coffee. Make it a little ritual.
5.  **Don't Stress About Speed:** Reading isn't a race. Go at your own pace, savor the words, and let the story unfold.
6.  **Join a Community (Like This One!):** Talking about books with others makes the experience even better. Share your thoughts, ask for recommendations, and discover new favorites.

The transparent cubes are neatly stacked. Picking up a few and dropping them into a cup instantly creates a crisp ""ding-dong"" sound, as if the entire room has cooled down a bit.

The ice maker's storage bin is actually quite magical. It's like a miniature ice cellar, preserving the ice and preventing it from melting. Whether you're drinking water, making coffee, chilling juice, or even just nibbling on ice, you can grab ice directly from the bin—it's incredibly convenient. Compared to filling the ice bin the night before and then waiting for hours, this on-the-go experience is so much easier.

Of course, there are some minor issues, like the ice clinging together over time, requiring a little tapping to separate. But on the other hand, it's a small interactive experience that adds a touch of fun to life. Overall, the ice maker's storage bin is a truly cooling device for the scorching summer heat, providing the satisfying feeling of a cool, refreshing ice cube every day.

I’ve been using it daily for over a month, and while I have plenty to gush about, there are some kinks worth mentioning. This compact coffee press makes brewing coffee incredibly glamorous. Every time I have friends over, it becomes a conversation starter, and honestly, I can't complain! Its description promises epic mornings, and it does deliver in many aspects, but not without a few quirks.

**Stylish Appeal That Stands Out**  
This French press stands out in my kitchen like a piece of art. The pink and gold combination, complete with heart accents, screams luxury. The glass is held snugly within a golden stainless steel frame, and the heart-shaped measuring spoon is adorable. It’s perfect for anyone obsessed with coordinating their kitchen decor or, like me, who just enjoys a pretty item that feels functional. I love setting it on the countertop since its charm doubles as decor. But keep in mind that, with its gold-tone finish, you’ll want to be cautious with handling to avoid unsightly scratches.  

[Check Paris Hilton Paris Hilton price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0b2l1zwjf/)  

**Simple Brew for A Busy Morning**  
Using this French press is incredibly straightforward. I simply scooped some fresh coffee grounds with the heart-shaped spoon that came with the set and followed the brewing instructions. Pour boiling water in, let it steep for four minutes, and press the plunger down gently—voilà! My mornings have never felt so effortless or fancy. The non-drip spout is a feature that I quickly grew to appreciate, as it makes pouring less stressful with no spills to clean up. This became my go-to for weekday hustle mornings and leisurely weekend brunches alike.  

**Coffee Quality and Taste**  
The fine mesh stainless steel filter is a game-changer. It ensures no stray coffee grounds end up in the cup, which is a big plus for anyone who’s had to endure gritty coffee sips. I’ve tried various types of coarse-ground coffee and loose-leaf teas, and this press handles them both beautifully. While it struggles a bit if the grounds aren’t coarse enough, that’s standard for French press designs. My favorite drink so far has been an oat-milk latte made directly after pressing fresh Colombian coffee—absolute bliss in a cup.  

**Strengths**  
- Eye-catching, luxurious design perfect for any chic kitchen space.  
- Easy to use with simple brewing techniques.  
- Produces rich and flavorful coffee with a fine mesh filter.  
- Heart-shaped spoon adds a cute, fun flair to the experience.  

**Adverse Aspects**  
- Gold finish is somewhat prone to scratches with frequent cleaning.  
- Limited to serving about 8 small cups—may not be ideal for larger households.  
- Manual operation could be a downside for users who prefer automation.  

**Competing Products**  
When stacking this against other French presses, the *Bodum Chambord French Press* immediately comes to mind. While the Bodum offers a timeless stainless steel and glass design with excellent functionality, the Paris Hilton model takes the cake for sheer glamour and uniqueness. However, Bodum has the edge in terms of durability and scratch resistance, making it better suited for daily heavy use. On the other hand, the Hilton press holds its own against basic presses like the Kona French Press with its premium aesthetic appeal but is outshone when looking at larger-capacity presses for big families or group settings.  

**Money's Worth**  
Considering its cute design and effective coffee-making abilities, this French press feels like a solid investment for certain buyers. It’s perfect for those who prioritize style alongside functionality or anyone who simply enjoys bringing a little glamour into their kitchen routines. However, those looking for a robust, high-capacity, everyday workhorse might need to look elsewhere. It performs well, but it’s definitely positioned as a statement piece that can brew.

Built without ads or paid PR — mainly organic traction. Sharing what worked, what didn’t, and some extension-specific tips for the r/chrome_extensions crowd.

# Summary

* 2k downloads total
* Product Hunt launch → 180+ upvotes, \~150 downloads in one day
* Website + Chrome Web Store cross-linking drove organic traffic from Google
* Fixing bugs and shipping updates improved engagement
* Planning an AI feature (beta on website) for premium users

* Cost so far: $15 (Chrome Web Store $5 one-time + domain \~$10)

# Launch (Product Hunt)

* Make store asset-friendly creative: eye-catching hero images, screenshots that show the extension in action, and a concise, honest description explaining why you built it (no fluff).
* Outcome: good visibility and initial downloads; also useful bug reports and comments.
* Tip for extensions: have your Chrome Web Store page polished before launch (screenshots, clear permissions, short & long descriptions, changelog).

# Blog & Community

* Wrote posts showing real use cases and productivity workflows.
* Platforms: Dev\[to\], Medium, Reddit (including communities relevant to Chrome extensions).
* Share demos/screens recordings — people want to see the extension in action.

1mzlxsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mzlxsh/i_miss_him_im_losing_it/,I miss him. I'm losing it.,"I've already posted about my break up. I hope another post is okay. 

I miss him so much. Sometimes im able to convince myself that it didn't happen at all. That i just have a vivid dream. That ill look down at my phone and see the screensaver i made of us for our anniversary. Completely forgetting that i changed it days ago because i couldnt unlock my phone without crying. Leaving the house seems like an impossible task. And when I manage its always a race to get back home before i start crying. As soon as im in the comfort of my home i cry hysterically for hours. I have an eye disease that is causing my vision to degrade. I leave my glasses at home when i go out. It doesnt make it easier. But I try to tell myself it does. Ill pretend like everything around me is different or doesnt exist. Thats how i manage leaving the house. Ive tripped over everything, but scratches, cuts, and bruises are better than possibly seeing his car or the boba spot we went to almost everyday that's right next to my house. I cant think about it. I csnt. Im ashamed to say that ive tried looking for psychicz in my area or online to just give me something, a sign, anything. Anything that'll tell me if he comes back or not. Anything that tells me if he misses me. Anything that'll help us. No contact has always worked for me. But I feel like ripping my skin off. Hoping he'll text. Hoping that the coffee date will happen sooner. Hoping he'll want to talk. Hoping he'll apologize and kiss me. Ive even resorted to looking up spells and rituals online. Anything that'll tell me that things will be okay for us. In the painfully long week weve been apart ive struggled to eat or do anything. I want to eat. But I cant. Im not hungry. Something about eating or drinking anything makes me feel incredibly guilty. Suicide hasn't stopped crossing my mind, but it's easy to ignore those when the thought of him reaching out to me is there too. . I dont want to die. And ive accepted that i have to wait. But it hurts so much. I dont feel like a person. I space out when im near people, even if im the one talking. Its like my thoughts just disappear. I started stuttering again. Tripping over my words. Speaking on impulse. Or just not making any sense. I was so proud of myself when i firsr got over that hurdle. I still remember it. We were talking on the phone, this was before we started dating, and I was online shopping. I saw a cute shirt, but remember making some sort of noise when i saw the fabric it was made of. He asked me why that was a problem if the shirt was nice. It was such a stupid topic, but talking about how much i hated clothes made with polyester fabric for 10-20 minutes straight was the first time i spoke clearly and coherent. I didnt stutter or trip over my words. I didnt start shaking from being nervous. I remember being so comfortable. Like even though i couldnt see him, he was completely engaged in the conversation. And fuck. I would do anything to go back to that. Anything. Because speaking to him made me stutter less. My eyes wouldnt water when i talked with him. My hands were still. For the first time i felt good about my voice. I miss him. I dont want to move on. I dont want to pretend like i moved on. I cant. I tried downloading an app to help make friends, meet people, talk to people. Its an app made to make friends. I couldn't even put my phone down without getting friend requests from people just trying to fuck me. Some of them saying that they wanted to be my rebound in bed. That they can takw his place. That I was too pretty to be lonely and they could fill the void with....I met 2 people that were cool and 900+ messages from people just wanting to have sex. Some of them i knew from middle school. It hurt. I deleted the app and i felt so much worse. Why am i good enough to sleep with but not good enough to just talk to or be friends with. I made it so clear. I regret it. I dont want to get undressed for someone that isnt him. I dont want to have to pretend like i can love or be attracted to anyone except him. I had a terrible childhood and teenage years filled with sexual and physical abuse. I cant put into words how terrible i felt after that app.  

I feel disgusting. I feel guilty. I hate it so much. I miss him more than anything and being told that i would make a good sl*t by strangers or old classmates destroyed me. 

My brain wants to shut off. I dont want to die. But its just getting worse the more i try to fix. 

I wish I could just come over. He'd lay down on his back in bed, and i would lay ontop of him. He would hug me tight. Kiss my face. Then he'd look at me with the most beautiful eyes I'd ever seen. With eyes that would show my future. the eyes i wanted my kids to have. The eyes that brought me to the moon and back. 

He'd ask how my day was. I'd say it was good. Then I'd ask him. He'd say his day was good too. 

I want that. Please. I'm trying so hard to pull myself together. Sometimes i scroll through this subreddit or others, hoping. Praying. Begging that he'll post on here and say he regrets it. That he'd take it back. That he wants to message me. That he wants to work things out. That he just..misses me. 

I lost track of this. I don't even know if i made sense. Killing myself wont solve anything. It would ruin everything if i survived. And if i succeed in it then i wasted all of my hard work and money in school for no reason. But seeing him and seeing us together when my life flashes before my eyes . I justify it in my head. Im sorry im all over the place. Nights are the hardest. ",3,1756114577.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False

1mzlwvw,https://i.redd.it/loqczydzx4lf1.png,Hydration and Weight Loss Medication: Why Water Matters,"
Staying well-hydrated is one of the simplest yet most effective ways to support your health while on a weight loss journey with medication. Water plays a central role in appetite control, side effect management, and maintaining your overall energy levels. Understanding why it matters can help you use hydration as a practical tool, rather than treating it as an afterthought.

1. Appetite Control and Satiety
One of the main ways water supports a weight loss journey is by helping regulate hunger signals. The body can sometimes misinterpret thirst as hunger, leading to unnecessary snacking. Drinking water regularly ensures these signals remain clearer.

For those on weight loss medication, this is particularly important. Medication reduces appetite, but keeping hydrated strengthens the effect — a full stomach from water can reinforce satiety and reduce the chance of “mindless eating.”

Why it matters: A glass of water before meals can make it easier to stop after a small portion, aligning with how the medication already lowers appetite.

Practical example: Try having 250ml–300ml of water 15 minutes before eating. This primes your body for food while ensuring thirst isn’t mistaken for hunger.

2. Managing Common Side Effects
Many people experience side effects such as nausea, constipation, or headaches during their weight loss journey on medication. Hydration plays a direct role in reducing their impact.

Nausea: Small sips of cold water can ease stomach discomfort and keep fluids balanced when food intake is lower.

Constipation: Adequate hydration softens stool and helps digestion function more smoothly, especially when paired with fibre.

Headaches: Dehydration is one of the most common but overlooked causes of headaches. Ensuring steady fluid intake often helps prevent them.

Why it matters: Water doesn’t just prevent dehydration — it actively supports the body in coping with changes that come with appetite suppression and reduced food volume.

3. Energy Levels and Physical Function
Even mild dehydration can cause fatigue, sluggishness, and reduced concentration. On a weight loss journey, this can easily be misattributed to eating less or medication effects, when in reality, it may be due to inadequate fluid intake.

Why it matters: Proper hydration keeps blood volume stable, supports circulation, and helps cells produce energy efficiently. This means you’re more likely to feel energised for work, walking, or exercise, rather than drained.

Practical example: If you feel tired in the afternoon, try drinking a glass of water before reaching for food or caffeine — in many cases, energy improves quickly.

4. Realistic Ways to Drink More Daily
Simply saying “drink two litres a day” can feel unhelpful. What matters is finding a routine that works within daily life:

Start early: Drink a glass of water soon after waking. It sets the tone for the day and rehydrates after sleep.

Carry a bottle: Keeping water within reach removes the friction of needing to go and get it.

Flavour without sugar: Lemon slices, cucumber, or herbal teas can make water more appealing without adding calories.

Small, steady sips: Regular intake is more effective than downing large amounts at once.

Link to habits: Tie hydration to existing routines (e.g. always drink after brushing teeth, before meals, or while making coffee).

5. How Much is Enough?
The common recommendation is around 2 litres (8 glasses) per day, but needs vary depending on body size, activity, and environment. Signs of good hydration include light-coloured urine, consistent energy levels, and the absence of frequent headaches or constipation.

Why it matters: Listening to your body and aiming for steady hydration is more effective than chasing a rigid number.

Key Takeaway
Hydration is not a minor detail in a weight loss journey — it directly supports appetite control, reduces side effects, and helps maintain energy and focus. By making water a conscious part of your daily routine, you can strengthen the benefits of weight loss medication and improve your overall wellbeing.

The silence of the apartment was strangely oppressive. A should be seizing the opportunity to tackle his to-do list, to restore a semblance of order amidst the chaos of memory. Yet, each abandoned object seemed to whisper accusations, reminding him of the life he'd left behind.

His phone vibrated – another concerned text from his assistant, nudging him back towards the world he knew. A familiar sense of guilt washed over him, soon followed by a surge of defiance. He flipped through his contacts instead, landing on a name that ignited an unexpected spark: R.

His fingers hovered over the screen. What had begun as idle curiosity now fluttered like trapped birds in his chest.on the plane now fluttered in his chest like trapped birds. Was it absurd to reach out, a stranger in his former hometown? Barcelona pulsed with life outside his window. Perhaps a distraction was precisely what he needed.

A: *Back in BCN. Feels surprisingly foreign.*

The three dots of her reply popped up on the screen with agonizing slowness. Her response was warm, yet careful:R: *Welcome back! A lot changes in a few years, doesn't it? 😊*





R’s Perspective

She stared at the message for a second longer than necessary, thumb resting on her screen.A. Again.

She wasn’t sure what she'd expected when she saw his name pop up. A flicker of warmth spread through her chest—unexpected, sharp. Her phone buzzed gently in her hand as she stood by the kitchenette, half-dressed, barefoot, waiting for her tea to steep.

*Foreign,* he’d said.Of course it felt foreign. He had become a different man—different city, different life. But his message was oddly human, maybe even… lost?

Her smile was instinctive. Not forced.

R: *Welcome back! A lot changes in a few years, doesn't it? 😊*

As she sent it, something caught in her throat.Was she being too casual? Too eager?

She paced slightly, adjusting the strap of her tank top. The studio still smelled faintly of laundry detergent and the sandalwood candle she'd lit the night before. The air was crisp from the window she refused to close, despite the November chill.

When his next message came, she could see something behind it—melancholy? Nostalgia?

A: *More than I realized. Just at my Dad's old place. Dealing with memories and loose ends.*

Her fingers stilled over the keyboard. She felt an urge to say more. But she held back.

R: *Ah. That's never easy. But, hey, this city always has a way of surprising you.*

She hesitated again. Was this flirting?No, not yet.But her pulse quickened nonetheless.

When he asked what brought her back, she answered easily, but still chose her words with precision.

R: *Landed a teaching gig downtown. Roommate situation, cozy studio... It's been an adjustment, but I'm loving the energy.*

As they continued chatting, she leaned back against the fridge, drawing lazy circles with her toe on the tiled floor.

A: *That's great! Must be...vibrant...working with little ones. Is it what you always wanted?*

She laughed, a genuine huff of amusement. He remembered the little things—her indecision, her scattered ambitions. And still, he asked.

R: *Honestly? Not how I pictured things. But the kids are hilarious, and it's never dull 😉 And you? Have you conquered the world, A?*

His answer was classic him. Elusive. Wry.A: *Depends on your definition of conquest.*

She felt something twist in her stomach.

And then—he was just down the [road.Barcelona](http://road.Barcelona), once sprawling and distant, now felt like a village.The idea of him walking the same streets made her skin tingle.

R: *Speaking of change... I've actually moved into the city center too. Just down the road from you!*





Back to A’s perspective:

A: *No way! That's quite a coincidence. I should probably tackle the mess here, but... the city is calling.*

R: *Perhaps we should grab a coffee sometime, catch up properly ☕*

A: *I'm only here for a few days... work stuff.*

R: *Well then, should we make that coffee happen today? There's a quirky little place near me... I just want to say ""welcome back"" face to face.*

A: *(long pause, then three typing dots appear and disappear)Okay, quirky cafe it is. Give me an hour?*

R: *Perfect!! I'll send the address 🎉*

He stared at his phone, the three dots of R's last message mocking his internal chaos. A coffee. That's all it was. A harmless act of friendliness, a way to reconnect with a piece of his past in this city that suddenly felt less alien.

His thumb hovered over the keyboard, a half-formed message to Elena – a check-in, a vague excuse about running an errand – flickering on the screen.

But a knot of guilt settled in his stomach. Was it innocent, this desire to revisit a time before the carefully built walls of his current life? Elena would disapprove, he knew. Even the hint of an emotional connection beyond her tightly controlled world would seem a betrayal. Yet, he craved normalcy, the ease of a simple conversation untainted by the unsaid anxieties that plagued his marriage.

He shoved the guilt aside. Overthinking was a dangerous game, he reminded himself. A coffee was just that – a chance to glimpse a lighter, less burdened version of himself in the company of this woman who'd reappeared as if conjured by Barcelona itself.

*""* *Old friend,’ he said aloud, testing the words—and finding them weightless.* R was more than that – a spark of possibility, a whisper of the person he'd been before ambition forged an emotional armor around him.

He recalled her easy laughter on the plane, the shared thrill of the convention center. Harmless memories, surely?

As he pocketed his phone and straightened the collar of his perfectly tailored shirt, a wave of unfamiliar recklessness rushed through him.

Perhaps Elena didn't need to know.Perhaps he owed it to himself to explore this unexpected connection, even if only for an hour.Perhaps, just perhaps, it would be the simple key to breaking free from the numbness that had crept into every corner of his life.

I've been debating with myself whether to hire an accountant or not, and I would be grateful for some input from people who are in a similar situation as to the costs/benefits.

My situation in brief:

* I am not expecting very significant income, probably around 4 million gross this year, maybe 6 million next year if all goes well.
* I have very meagre business expenses directly associated with this hustle, at most 10-20 man a year. 
* I am filing an invoice once every 2-3 months so it's pretty straightforward to keep track of it.
* The accounting services I have found online generally charge around 2.5-3 man per month minimum, so equivalent to around 5-9 percent of my expected business income. Based on some back of the envelope calculations, it appears unrealistic that such an expense could pay for itself through deductions on such a low income.
* Hence I've been thinking that it would be reasonable to just submit a white return by myself and call it a day. (I've done some self accounting before overseas, so at least I'm familiar with the basics.)

On the other hand:

* I am not keen on taking a crash course in Japanese accounting and business law and as I might want to apply for PR in future I would prefer not having any tax related mess.
* I am not familiar with Japanese accounting standards and might leave some significant deductions on the table (eg. since it's telework, I could claim part of the rent and utilities as business costs, maybe claim airfare when I fly home and meet clients, deduct my new coffee maker etc.) + the blue return deduction would obviously reduce my tax burden a lot. 
* My income would be in foreign currency paid to an overseas account, which as far as I know means that I couldn't really use Freee. It also appears to me that dealing with foreign currency would be some extra administrative headache.
* Maybe there are services which can help me with the filing for a one-time fee, but do not charge a montly fee? Haven't found something like that, but I feel it would be more reasonable in my case.",1,1756113542.0,JapanFinance,2,1.0,False
1mzlnz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrandMarketingTips/comments/1mzlnz3/the_cheat_code_to_getting_seen/,The cheat code to getting seen?,"Ever feel like social media is a bit of a mystery for businesses? It's so much more than just a place to hang out; it's a powerful tool that can give you a huge leg up on the competition. With billions of people online, it's basically the ultimate party, and you're invited!

So, what's the secret sauce that makes social media such a marketing powerhouse? Let's take a look.

# Your Global Megaphone

Social media has completely changed the game. It's a marketing channel with a reach that's truly mind-blowing. Think about it: a single post can be seen by people all over the world, in a matter of seconds!

* **Reach a Massive Audience:** With billions of active users, platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok give you an opportunity to connect with a global audience. Whether you're a local coffee shop or a huge company, you can find your people.
* **Build Relationships:** It's not just about one-way communication. Social media lets you talk to your audience, answer their questions, and build a real community around your brand.

# Targeted Marketing Made Simple

Tired of shouting into the void with old-school advertising? Social media lets you get super specific.

* **Find Your Perfect Audience:** Unlike traditional ads that just throw a message out there, social media platforms let you target your audience with surgical precision. You can narrow down your ads by age, gender, location, interests, and so much more.
* **Get the Right Eyes on Your Content:** This targeted approach means your marketing efforts are reaching the people who are most likely to be interested in your product. That means more engagement, more conversions, and less wasted money!

In short, social media isn't just a powerful tool; it's a smart one. It lets you get your message in front of a huge audience, but also make sure it's the *right* audience.

Here’s the thing. It’s not a magic wand, but it’s absolutely not the “scammy AI PDF” people keep yelling about. The value is in how the material is organized and how fast you can go from idea to a clean prompt that gets you a usable image.

Let’s break it down. The photography bundles and Prompt Master aren’t pretending to be a university course. They’re a working library. You get patterns, variations, and decision trees that help you dial in style, lens language, lighting, and subject cues without guessing. The “visual vocabulary” and “prompt structures” are simple on purpose. They’re mnemonics so you don’t reinvent the wheel every single time. I found the sheets usefull for keeping consistency across a set.

Formatting on my end was fine. There are a couple typos here and there, sure, but nothing show-stopping. Opened cleanly on desktop and phone. The layout is minimal because it’s meant to be referenced while you work, not admired like a coffee table book.

About the “AI-written” complaint. Maybe parts started in AI, maybe not, who cares. What matters is curation and practicality. The bundle gives concrete examples, then shows how to tweak them by subject, lens, mood, and constraints. That’s the part most YouTube threads skip. I tested prompts across Midjourney and SDXL and had almost zero safety filter rejections because the framework nudges you to add context and avoid the obvious flags. When something did get blocked, the troubleshooting notes made it easy to rephrase. Defintely saved me time.

Is there repetition? A bit, and honestly that’s fine. Repetition builds muscle memory. You start hearing the cadence of a strong prompt in your head. After a day or two I was generating sets that matched brief, not just one lucky image. What this really means is you spend less time fiddling and more time selecting.

Fake value? Not from my experience. I used the portrait and product sections to deliver a small client test and it passed with no changes. If you’re a total pro who already has a personal prompt bank and strict SOPs, you might not need this. But if you want a fast, organized system that gets you to reliable results, I reccomend it. Price felt fair for the time it saved me, alot more than scrolling random tips on forums.

Bottom line. It’s a practical toolkit. Not flashy, not hype, but effective. I’d buy it again.",1,1756113339.0,ohneis,0,1.0,False

Lot of SD's say that having a membership is one of a sign that man is legit SD... 

I disagree but I can't understand why so many men who:
- are time wasters (free naughty videocall requests/ pics/ etc etc) 
- who lowball girls to the point that it is not even funny (mixing dynamic with SW's for minimal benefit) 

I am not saying it's a huge amount of money but in Europe, it is not something that most of people could say ""oh, I spend that ussually just for coffee, it is nothing.""

Why these men even pay for membership?

The coffee bush has 2 main resources, Coffee berries, and coffee flowers. The flowers can be used for anything normal flowers are used for. meanwhile the berries are the fun part.





Coffee berries, when broken will produce 2-3 coffee berry chunks, and 1 coffee bean. the berry chunks are a t4 leather and can be used for some smoothies that give massive energy boosts. the bean though that is something else at this size that level of caffeine is deadly to most things. in fact it adds a new status effect.



CAFFEINATED

info: effects different things differently.

insects: poisons them doing heavy tic damage.

spiders: stuns them (IRL makes them drunk, puts AXL into a rage for late game re-fights.)

players: Allows using stamina even when depleted at the cost of health (1 HP per stamina used.) useful in desperate run away situations.



Do to this fact its uses in game are varried, from poison bombs and traps, to booster fuel.



\------------------

example of uses.



berry uses.



Smallbucks coffee (smoothie)

doubles stamina value, and adds caffeinated effect. 



Mixed berry mush (cooking)

uses 3 different berry types, and some plant fiber. a gives a good food and water value as well as other meal bonuses.



leather uses



Caffeinated bandages

info: grant stamina boost when used. 



insulated walls. 

info: combined with milkweed fluff and pine needles, these walls reduce chill effects nearby. (can be used to make safe houses in chill areas.)



Insulated roofs (see walls)

insulated floor (see walls) 



\-----------

Coffee seed uses



the raw seeds are useless to the players, to get use out of them they must put them on a jerky rack to ""sizzle"" and become roasted.



Roasted coffee beans can be used in the following examples (or more.)



weapon



Coffee staff

info: rapid fire mage weapon, applies caffeinated to targets, heals players. 



BEAN MINE

info: a base defense when stepped on deploys ground coffee powder into the air. good for giving players a boost and bugs a debuff.



Coffee bomb

Info: thrown explosive, does toxic and caffeinated damage





FOOD



THE COFFEECORN

info: a base structure that requires boiling glands, acorns, pebbles, clay and more. when built this thing takes water and coffee beans to make ""PURE COFFEE"" which can be drank. gameplay is just a highly effective stamina boosting water that you can put in canteens ",4,1756113045.0,GroundedGame,4,0.83,False

1mzliwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gymhelp/comments/1mzliwr/i_stopped_chasing_a_number_on_the_scale_and/,I stopped chasing a number on the scale and started chasing this instead. It's been a game-changer.,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a mindset shift that has really been helping me lately. As a working mom, I used to think ""being healthy"" was all about losing weight or fitting into old jeans. I'd feel like a failure every time the scale wouldn't move, and I’d just give up.

But I realized I was focusing on the wrong thing. The most powerful metric for me isn't weight—it's **energy**.

It's that feeling of waking up and not immediately needing coffee. It's having a clear head during a 2 p.m. meeting instead of fighting to stay focused. It's having enough left in the tank to actually *enjoy* my time with the kids after work, instead of just counting down the minutes to their bedtime.

That's the stuff that actually changes your whole day.

The best part? Your energy is one of the first things to improve when you start taking care of yourself. It's the ""quick win"" that keeps you motivated.

I've been focusing on a few simple things that don't feel overwhelming:

* **Protecting my bedtime:** Even just 15 extra minutes of sleep feels like a huge win.
* **Simple meals:** Not a crazy diet, just making sure there's protein in every meal to keep me from crashing.
* **Short workouts:** I've let go of the idea that I need a full hour. 20-30 minutes is better than nothing and makes a real difference.
* **Boundaries (this one was the hardest):** Learning to say ""no"" to things that I know will completely drain me. It felt selfish at first, but now I see it as necessary.

When I have more energy, everything else feels easier. The workouts aren't as dreadful, and I feel more present with my family.

It’s a shift from chasing fat loss to chasing vitality. It feels so much better.

Has anyone else experienced this? What's the one thing you do that gives you the biggest energy boost?",1,1756112961.0,Gymhelp,0,0.67,False

What helped me change my thinking was realizing that writing is more about mobilizing your hands rather than waiting for the muse. By that I mean training yourself to show up on paper daily until your hands know how to move with honesty, rhythm and flow even when your head feels blank. 

BookLeaf's 21-Day Writing Challenge was a big part of this. Having a simple structure (write every day, submit what you've written, and enjoy being part of it all... as it comes together into a book) was liberating in an unexpected way. I didn't feel stressful deadlines; I felt it was a clean delivery, held accountable, attending to my goal. Even when I thought all I had was nothing for a day, let's wait and just see what happens when I sit down at the keyboard. 

The best part? In the end, I didn't have a pile of drafts that I'd been aggregating. I had a collection (albeit not without its holes), that was printed, and real, that reminded me: consistency will win over inspiration. 

If you have ever thought about writing, or you get distracted, or stuck, or pay too much attention to writer's block... try committing to a small challenge like the one by bookleaf publishing that is defined.",1,1756112948.0,u_WarmStrategy7708,0,1.0,False

1mzlec9,https://v.redd.it/ut2s8hmfr4lf1,Foundry Bulwark Backfire Striker shield armor regen dps Hybrid (armor regen attributes with all red cores),"*NOTE: This is gonna be a long read so grab a coffee and stay for a while. Do note this build doesnt use its shield for facetanking, the striker shield is a multiplicative dmg bonus. This is the max dmg u can output with Foundry Bulwark while still maintaining the maximum amount of armor regen as possible. All dmg testing shown in the video above was done with global modifiers on and no striker shield dmg bonus. Striker shield dmg testing can be difficult but ill give u guys the maximum dmg numbers down below.*


*WHY DID U MAKE THIS BUILD?


I make weird off meta builds (at least nowadays) like my 6 skill tier striker gearset combat medic using Chameleon and BTSU gloves. My goal is to show the community that anything can work as a build with enough time and patience. This build was created to try and make a Hybrid dps Foundry Bulwark. It utilizes the strengths of armor regen, shield regen, Foundry Bulwark's backpack Talent, and the 50% extra shield health from Foundry Bulwark to make a all red core build that can take advantage of striker shield meaningfully while maximizing our dmg output.


*WHY USE FOUNDRY BULWARK? AND WHY USE THE BACKPACK?


Foundry bulwark was picked for its unique talent ""Makeshift repairs"". This talent will take 25% of the dmg we took and regen it to our shield and ourselves over the course of 10 seconds. The backpack makes this repair time drop from 10 seconds to only 5 seconds. This is huge for our squishy version of Foundry Bulwark. See most ppl use Foundry Bulwark as a tank setup which ur suppose to do. But very few ppl actually see the dmg potential when u build it correctly for a dps version. This setup will allow us to take our full 832k armor as dmg (only happens in group Legendary content) and regen up to 480k armor in only 4-5 seconds while still putting out crit numbers that can go above 1 mill dmg a crit to a body simply due to Backfire and Striker shield. The 50% extra shield health allows us to have a 2 million hp striker shield at shield Tier 0 (normally ur shield only has 1.4 million hp with 6 red cores, however this build has a 2 million hp shield with a super fast regen because of Makeshift repairs and the Foundry Bulwark backpack).


*WHY NOT USE ARMOR CORES AND CHD ATTRIBUTES INSTEAD OF WEAPON DMG CORES AND ARMOR REGEN ATTRIBUTES?


This is because we run Backfire. From all the dmg calculations and dmg testing I've done over the past 3 weeks, going with armor cores and CHD leads to a low base weapon dmg and a deminishing return in CHD. Simply because we have no base weapon dmg to back the CHD up. Simply put, with Backfire as the weapon of choice, we will do more dmg with the 90% weapon dmg cores, than running the 72% extra CHD because Backfire already gives us 200% CHD. Adding more CHD will not give u a substantial amount of total dmg. This is why I went with 6 red weapon dmg cores and armor regen attributes. The armor regen attributes are extremely useful with this build since they are a flat base stat number, that can stack on top of each other. Simply put, because our base total armor is low (832k), % based armor regen will not give us enough armor regen (1% of 832k is 8320 armor regen, its just not worth it over using the base stat numbers that Armor regen attributes will give u). Now u could do a full red core and red attribute Foundry Bulwark build but ive tested this and ur dmg isnt high enough to justify ruining ur armor regen on a gearset thats whole purpose is armor regen. At that point, just use Hunters fury if u want all red attributes. Because of our 5 armor regen attributes, we get 24k armor regen a second on a all red core build. That's not including the 1% armor regen from Foundry Bulwark (8,320) and the 21,900 armor repair from the Repair drone. In total, we have 54k armor regen a second with the Repair drone up (32k armor regen a second without it up). On top of the 25% armor repair we get from Makeshift repairs talent over 5 seconds. In total we get 480k armor repair in 4-5 seconds. Thats over half our armor (832k).


*WHY USE SOLKOLOV CHEST PIECE INSTEAD OF BELSTONE ARMORY?


This is because again the 1% armor regen for the brand set bonus doesn't give us enough value. The 10% SMG weapon dmg from Solkolov brand set bonus gives us waaaay more value overall in comparison. Same goes for running either Ceska or Grupo chest. We dont need either of these brand set bonuses as they won't give us more dmg than what the 10% SMG weapon dmg that Solkolov gives us. On a tankier build, Belstone Armory chest wouldn't be a bad idea but we dont have the total armor pool to get use of that brand.


WHATS THE POINT IN THIS BUILD IF U CANT FACETANK ENEMIES?


The entire reason I've started making this build was because I wanted to turn Foundry Bulwark gearset into a dps build without sacrificing the armor regen. The point of this build is to be able to put out over a million dmg crit with striker shield bonus dmg and have the armor regen of a tank. Which we do! We just dont have the HP/shield pool of a tank. This build allows a full red core build to be able to bounce back from getting health gated without wasting a medkit. Meaning u spend less time in cover overall, allowing u to take advantage of the dmg potential while having good survivability. A 2 million HP striker shield on a all red core build is nothing to laugh at. Especially when it regens super fast. The goal/problem of the build is dont let ur shield break.. EVER. The entire reason ur dmg even comes close to other dps builds is simply because of striker shield and fast armor regen, meaning u can be aggressive with a safety net to fall back on. This build does not work Solo in Legendary content. The point of this build was for Legendary Group content, where u can get away with playing aggressively because the enemy aggro is being drawn away by teammates. This build works well in Legendary Group content cause u have the dmg potential while still having probably the BEST survivability for a all red core build. No debate (unless we're taking Time To Kill into consideration in which case this build highly depends on how many enemies are in front of ur striker shield to determine Time To Kill. Simply because ur single target dmg is no more than 700k a crit to the body).


*WHAT 3 ARMOR MODS DO U USE?


I use 3 CHD armor mods as we dont need CHC and we dont care about HSD as headshots only do 110k more dmg than our body shots do.


*WHY FIREWALL SPECIALIZATION OVER GUNNER OR TECHNICIAN?


This is because we need the multiplicative dmg bonus from striker shield to even compete dmg wise with other dps setups. The 10% armor on kill from gunner isnt worth it due to how good our armor regen already is. The extra +1 skill tier from Technician does nothing for ur shield in Legendary content, it will still break just as fast. So instead, take advantage of what Firewall has to offer! The striker shield, 30% health on kill, and the busted medkits that u can use whenever because u dont rely on them to stay alive.


*WHAT GLOBAL MODIFIERS DO U USE?


The global modifiers this season make this build so much more fun to play! I personally run:

Active modifier: Assault link (we need all the extra dmg we can get and this gives us everything we need dmg wise. Also because of this season's Firearms global attribute bonus, we can go past the 60% CHC cap. With assault link activated we have a true CHC of 91%! Absolutely bonkers! And Assault link buffs ur teammates!)


Passive modifier 1.   A Tier a Day:  For each Tier in any global attribute, gain +10% total health (This is busted with our 30% health on kill! We can get up to 900k health with this modifier equipped which is huge considering how much armor regen we have)


Passive modifier 2.   Multitasker:  While at Tier 5 in all global attributes, receive +7.5% weapon dmg, +85k max armor, and +1 skill tier (exactly as it says, this is amazing for us overall. Extra dmg, extra armor, and a skill tier for our shield)


Passive modifier 3.   Loaded up:  25% of ur CHC value is added as CHD while at Tier 5 in Firearms global attribute (this is broken for us as it gives us a bunch of free CHD which we will take as we have no CHD attributes on our armor. With Assault link active, this takes 25% of our 91% CHC and adds it directly as CHD. Pretty damn nice if u ask me)


*WHATS THE MAX DMG U HAVE DONE IN OPEN WORLD?


The max amount of dmg ive done in Heroic open world was with 6 ppl in front of my striker shield and it was 1.1 million dmg a crit to the body with no Assault link modifier active.
With Assault link modifier activated, the highest ive done again was with 6 ppl in front of the striker shield, it was 1.3 million dmg a crit to the body. Some damn good numbers considering we are running Foundry Bulwark with no CHD attributes on armor🤣Again these numbers are with 6 enemies in front of the striker shield.


*WHY USE COYOTES MASK AND BACKFIRE WITH FOUNDRY BULWARK IN THIS BUILD?


Very simple, these 2 exotics give u the most multiplicative dmg increases without needing to spec into CHC or CHD. Which was needed since we have armor regen attributes to make up for our loss of armor cores on the build.


*WHY DID U PICK BACKFIRE IN A ARMOR REGEN BUILD?


Also very simple, backfire gives us the most dmg compared to any other weapon. Sure u could run other weapons but then u need CHC and CHD attributes on ur armor which will then defeat the entire purpose of the armor regen on the gearset. At that point, just run a different gearset. Now some will say running Backfire with armor regen is a self nerf, no its not. Backfire stops giving u bleed at max 100 stacks. U become immune to the bleed so long as u maintain max stacks. However, if u reload 3 times, u become immune to the bleeding effect. So u have 2 options, bleed urself 3 times and become immune for a 5 second window or land ur shots and stack to 100 stacks and become immune for 10 seconds. Also the bleed dmg is completely countered by the 20,900 armor repair our repair drone gives us (bleed cancels regular armor regen, but it doesnt stop the Repair drone from fixing u. Just remember this when ur pushing into fights).


*QUESTIONS/COMMENTS?


Let me know what u guys think! Would u try it? Or u would u stick to what works and just run striker gearset like everyone else? I personally really enjoy this build because I've always wanted to try and make a dps version of Foundry Bulwark but u normally had to make a decision between survivability or dmg. Not with this version of the build tho. U can have the best of both worlds without giving up anything besides single target dmg which isnt a huge problem in group play (Even solo heroic isnt bad).",0,1756112474.0,Division2,6,0.5,False

THE CORPUS DELICTI JOURNALS: ENTRY 003","**“The cup was not meant to hold liquid. It was meant to hold memory.”**

*— Annotation, Vessel Studies Dept. (Redacted Year)*

It should’ve been comfort. That’s what it’s for…

The drink, the heat, the mug cupped in both hands like you’re cradling something sacred. Or fragile. Or hot enough to remind you you’re still here.

But the swirl doesn’t settle.

**Drink.**

And it never rests. And it hasn’t for days. Or weeks. Or years. Or whatever time becomes when every morning is the same and the milk keeps moving.

A steam stroke grazes your cheek like a mouth that knows exactly where you blush. It lingers longer now, warm breath trapped against skin, soft as a whisper you forgot to answer. Beneath the skin, something curls tighter, like veins taught to crave heat.

The first time you notice it, you laugh. Fair play, it’s only coffee, innit?

Because it’s just a drink. But the laugh doesn’t last long. The spiral keeps turning, and soon it isn’t pattern but presence.

You stare. You keep staring. Because something in you recognises it.  
Not *what* it is.  
But *how* it is.  
The way it folds into itself without closing. The way it repeats without resting.

It moves like thought. Like hunger with a face. Greed gnawing the cupboard door. Lust licking its lips in the dark. Wrath grinning through small talk. Then silence. A faint ceramic tick, like a clock forgetting how to count, breaks the hush.

**More.**

Part of you suddenly wants the mug bigger, the coffee bottomless, your throat wider. You imagine it. The drink threading through you, slow, steady, tugging something loose you didn’t know was clenched.

The swallow would hurt, but only once.

It moves like the thing you did not confess when you were ten, and again when you were twenty, and again last week, when someone reached across the table and you smiled, greedy to be seen yet terrified to be known.

There was someone else at that table.  
They asked how you were, and you smiled like your mouth belonged to someone else.

They touched your hand. You flinched. You don’t remember why.  
Or maybe you do, and that’s the problem.

You haven’t touched the cup since it began to move like this.  
You only watch. And wait. And let it become the only thing in the room.

At first, you try to describe it:

I don't mind doing this as I love her and it's not exactly a big house.

Recently though I've been getting increasingly more irritated at how she reacts when I bring whatever it is to her this is especially bothering me when I make coffee for her.

I'll come back through from the kitchen and offer it to her, if she is on her phone (usually messaging her mother who, I won't lie, I immensely dislike due to the way she treats my GF and me) then she won't even look up let alone take whatever she asked for from me.

She just says thank you and expects me to set it down.

We have a large sofa that she sits in the middle of so I can't set things anywhere but on the sofa without it being too far from her which is why I think it irritates me more when it's coffee as there's been more than a few spills which have stained the sofa.

I told her it was bothering me that she didn't take things from me that I was bringing her and she got angry with me saying that she isn't going to feed my ego.

I feel like this is a bit disrespectful but I'm struggling to figure out if my issue is more to do with the fact that she is messaging her mother or if this is actually about not taking things from me when I offer them.",1,1756112385.0,AIO,1,1.0,False

Throwaway account as friends know my main account. 

Yesterday, I invited some friends over to my house for drinks, food and to chill in my hot tub. Several friends came, including a couple, that happened to be lesbians. (They aren't bi)

They had travelled quite far, so I offered them a spare bed for the night. Everyone else had left, and we were alone in the hot tub drinking. One of them was naturally quite flirty, and were flirting with me casually, and I flirted back. I'm single and fairly easy going.

Long story short, we ended up naked, and they took it in turn giving me kisses, and once we dried off, I took them to the spare room where we ended up having sex. I remember checking several times throughout that they were both okay with this (worried they would regret it in the morning)

Anyway, I'm currently say in my kitchen, having a coffee, awaiting them to wake up and worried about how they will feel about this now. The whole thing feels surreal, and I'm nervous they will regret last night. 

Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. Do I say anything this morning or just act like it never happened or what?!?!

I go there most mornings, and for the past year, I’ve seen the same elderly man sitting by the window with a notebook and a black pen. We’d smile at each other, exchange a polite “good morning,” but never talked much.
One day, the place was unusually busy, and the only seat open was across from him. I asked if I could join him. He smiled and said, “Only if you don’t mind an old man scribbling ideas about time travel.” That made me laugh—and from that moment on, everything changed.
Turns out he’s a retired physics teacher, and he's been writing a sci-fi novel just for fun. Every day since, we’ve chatted—about books, life, why he thinks pancakes are superior to waffles, and how to stay curious about the world.
He’s become like a grandfather I didn’t know I needed. He calls me “kiddo,” shares his writing, and reminds me constantly that it’s never too late to chase a dream or start something new.

1mzl4l9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mzl4l9/aita_for_cutting_off_and_basically_ghosting_my/,AITA for cutting off and basically ghosting my best friend?,"I know the title sounds bad, so let me start from the beginning. The problems started during our last year of high school, at the end of which we were taking university entrance exams. I took my grades very seriously, and my friend obviously noticed. She was oddly competitive at times, but like, in an indirect way? So if I said anything to her I would be the bad guy. For example I had a lot of trouble with a specific subject and she loved talking about how easy it was and how I'll never get into my dream uni if I don't get better at it. This kind of behaviour went on for months, and it obviously annoyed me, but I was like, hey, maybe the stress is getting to her. Let's see what she'll be like once the exams are over.

It got worse. The day of our last exam, we went out to grab coffee with a mutual friend of ours. That was around the first few days of June. After the hangout we promised to keep talking. Guess when she texted me again? Never. She didn't text me back. Instead, I saw her posting stories about hanging out and going on road trips with her old classmates from tutor school. I was a bit taken aback, but considered that maybe I should text her myself, even though over the years she was almost always the one who initiated our hangouts.

So after around 20 days of silence, I texted her and asked her to hang out. She replied TEN HOURS LATER (I don't know what she was doing since I know for a fact she doesn't work) and said she already had plans, but ""maybe she could make some space for me one of these days"". I was like...??? I thought we were supposed to be best friends, but alright. I guess these people you never told me about even though we were together for hours everyday are suddenly more important. Obviously, I didn't tell her that. I just replied ""ok""... and she didn't text back until the end of July. JULY. An entire month later. I kept thinking about her that entire time, of course, she was my best friend for years. We used to hang out everyday the previous summer, and now she's posting stories with random people and not even texting me. 

Anyway. Around the last few days of July, she sends a ""heyy we haven't talked in a while"" message. Just that. I decided not to reply to her, since I obviously wasn't a priority anymore. I wondered if her new friends were busy or something. I felt a bit bad, but then she didn't send anything else for another two weeks.

My birthday was around ten days ago. She sent me a dry happy birthday text. Once again, I didn't text back. After basically not talking and meeting ONCE the entire summer she had the nerve to wish me a happy birthday? 

That was that. I thought after leaving her on delivered she would obviously get the sign that I was mad at her because she did something wrong. But nope. A few days ago another mutual friend texted me that she and my ""best friend"" went out and my ""best friend"" told her that I ghosted her for no reason and that she's deeply sad and she misses me a lot. Which like...? I told the mutual friend that if my best friend ""missed me"" maybe she should've texted more throughout the summer. Not even to hangout. Maybe just reels. A good morning text. Something to show that she cares. But she didn't, and now she plays the victim. Apparently these two were out with a couple more people, so my best friend basically told all these strangers what a bad friend I was for abandoning her and how sad I was making her. 

Oh, and it gets worse! The mutual friend (and at the same time cousin) and I are going to the same university, so we've been getting pretty close over the summer. But ever since this last hangout with my ""best friend"" she's been acting a bit cold, texting me dryly and not liking my messages like she used to. I'm obviously mad that I lost my best friend. But losing a friend I was supposed to have in a new chapter of my life, before even getting to know her that well?? 

Don't know what to do now. Should I text my best friend and apologise, should I text my cousin and explain my side of the situation better, should I text both or neither? I'm conflicted, but also wondering, AITA in all of this? 

EDIT: Just adding a bit more background info into why I didn't text her more before ghosting her. My best friend has very strict parents, to the point they take her phone away sometimes. I didn't want to be the reason her phone is taken away again. Plus, before the exams were over, she told me that she was mentally exhausted and all she wanted to do was sleep all summer. Though later that day we promised to hang out everyday, so I assumed she said that as a joke or something. Maybe I should've tried more. I don't know. But her telling me all this only to go on and post stories with other people basically everyday throughout made me feel very unwanted. ",0,1756111416.0,AITAH,2,0.5,False

I need to see my doctor to find out more and confirm but I honestly don't know how I would cope without stimulants, feeling awful at the moment","I've been getting chest tightness for years from anxiety but it also seems the chest tightness is more noticeable when I take stimulants including psychedelics with stimulant effects like LSD. I came across this comment on Reddit talking about a rare condition called coronary artery spasms or Prinzmetal's angina.

  
It's apparently way more common in people that have POTS, migraines or Raynaud's. I have Raynaud's and POTS as well as CFS/ME. Prinzmetal's angina causes people to get chest tightness especially with stimulants. Prinzmetal's angina causes the coronary spasm to shut which dramatically reduces blood flow to the heart. If this doesn't stop the heart muscle can be deprived of oxygen rich blood and this can cause heart attacks including in young people (I'm 29).

  
If I end up having this I won't be able to use my ADHD meds and will have to avoid taking nicotine, drinking coffee, smoking marijuana or using THC products and micro dosing LSD as an alternative to ADHD stimulant meds. I know it's rare but if I do end up having this I don't know how I'm meant to cope with ADHD without my prescribed stimulants or other substances like caffeine, nicotine, weed, LSD, kratom etc. 

  
Prinzmetal's Angina is also hard to diagnose. The user on reddit that made this comment said they passed EKGS, echos, stress tests and a holster monitor. I've had EKGs and a holster monitor that seemed fine. My ADHD meds greatly increase my quality of life with CFS and ADHD even though I know I need to be careful with them while dealing with CFS. Nicotine helps with CFS and ADHD if I use low dose patches. I don't know how I would cope without these things

  
I know this is rare and I haven't been diagnosed with it yet, I don't want to jump the gun just very anxious about what I'm meant to do if it turns out I do have it. I deal with suicidal thoughts daily because of my mental issues and CFS.  I've also tried other things like naltrexone and low dose ability. Low dose Naltrexone doesn't help me much and Low dose abilify helps but is much more mild than my ADHD meds or Nicotine. I'm feeling really anxious at the moment and needed to share this with someone

1mzl1hd,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1mzl1hd/distant_shores_by_kristin_hannah/,Distant Shores By Kristin Hannah,"Distant Shores By Kristin Hannah

Hey there, fellow book lovers! I recently finished reading ""Distant Shores By Kristin Hannah,"" and I wanted to share my honest thoughts with you, just like I would with a friend over coffee. If you're looking for a heartwarming, character-driven story that really makes you think about life and love, you can check out [Distant Shores By Kristin Hannah](https://pdfhive.com/distant-shores-by-kristin-hannah/).

**My Quick Take (No Spoilers, I Promise!)**

So, ""Distant Shores"" tells the story of Elizabeth and Jackson, whose seemingly perfect marriage hits a rough patch. As Elizabeth grapples with feeling lost in her own life and rediscovering herself, the narrative delves deep into the complexities of relationships, personal dreams, and what it truly means to be happy. It's not a fast-paced thriller or a magical fantasy, but rather a thoughtful exploration of everyday life and the big decisions we all face.

**What Really Stood Out For Me**

Kristin Hannah has a way with characters, and Elizabeth really felt like someone I could know. Her struggles felt so real and relatable – the feeling of losing yourself in a relationship or a routine, and the courage it takes to figure out what you truly want. I found myself rooting for her, even when she made choices I didn't always agree with. Jackson, too, was a complex character, not a villain but a flawed human being trying his best. This nuance made their dynamic feel incredibly authentic.

The writing style is, as always with Hannah, beautiful and very easy to fall into. She paints vivid pictures with her words, and I found myself getting quite emotional at several points. The pacing was just right for this kind of story – it wasn't a race to the finish, but a journey of self-discovery that unfolded naturally. It gave me space to reflect on the characters' lives and my own.

**A Couple of Things to Keep in Mind**

While I truly enjoyed the book, there were moments where I felt the narrative leaned a little heavily into some familiar tropes of relationship drama. At times, the ""figuring things out"" phase felt a bit drawn out, and I wished for a bit more unexpectedness in certain plot points. If you prefer high-stakes action or surprising twists around every corner, this might feel a little slower for you. However, if you enjoy deep dives into character psychology and emotional journeys, you'll likely appreciate the thoughtful pace.

**Would I Recommend It? And For Whom?**

Absolutely, yes! I'd highly recommend [Distant Shores By Kristin Hannah](https://pdfhive.com/distant-shores-by-kristin-hannah/) to anyone who enjoys contemporary fiction, family dramas, or stories about personal growth and relationships. If you're a fan of authors who explore the emotional landscapes of their characters, or if you're looking for a break from your usual thrillers or fantasy epics, this could be a wonderful read for you. It's a great choice for a quiet afternoon read or for discussion in a book club.

**For Our New Readers: A Little Encouragement!**

If you're just starting your reading journey, or trying to get back into it, remember that every great reader started somewhere! Here's a little step-by-step guide to help you out:

1.  **Pick What Sounds Good:** Don't feel pressured to read ""classics."" Start with a genre you already enjoy in movies or TV, like a mystery, a romance, or a fantasy adventure.
2.  **Give It A Chance:** Try to read the first few chapters. Sometimes it takes a little while to get into a book's rhythm.
3.  **It's Okay to Stop:** If a book isn't grabbing you after a fair try, it's perfectly fine to put it down and pick up something else. Reading should be enjoyable, not a chore!
4.  **Find Your Spot:** Create a cozy reading nook. A comfy chair, good lighting, and a warm drink can make all the difference.
5.  **Don't Rush:** Reading isn't a race. Take your time, savor the words, and let the story unfold at its own pace.

Remember, the goal is to enjoy the journey. There's a whole world of stories waiting for you, and finding the right one is part of the adventure. Perhaps [Distant Shores By Kristin Hannah](https://pdfhive.com/distant-shores-by-Kristin-hannah/) could be your next step into that wonderful world!

I Made Real Cash Just by Clicking Around—Is This the Next Side Hustle Goldmine?!,"Okay, wait. What is actually going on right now in the app world?? I swear, two weeks ago I thought all those ""get paid to test apps!!!"" posts were total scams. But here I am: a total newbie, signing up, clicking around—and making actual cash just for messing with unreleased apps. 

Literally, I’m stunned. I spent this weekend chilling on my couch, pressing buttons and rating 5/10, and I’ve already gotten more than my coffee money back. 

First thought? ""This CAN’T be real. Where’s the catch?""  
Spoiler: I haven’t found one 😳.

So here’s how this rabbit hole started:  
Scrolling Reddit, someone drops **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** in a comment. I’m curious.  
Boom! A signup, nothing weird, and suddenly I’m in this beta tester dashboard with *actual* apps to mess with.  
Check your PayPal, people, it actually hits.

Here’s what flipped my brain:  
- No degree? Whatever. No coding? LOL, same.  
- The steps are: sign up, grab an app off **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**, follow easy ""try these features"" tasks, submit feedback.  
- Feedback can literally be ""this screen made me confused"" or ""the app crashed.""  
- You get paid just for using your phone how you normally do anyway.

**Small Print?**  
- Don’t expect instant riches. This won’t knock out your rent, but movie night? Solid.  
- You gotta be honest—no making stuff up. They *actually* want real reactions.  
- Your phone needs to store new apps. If it’s bulging with TikTok, maybe toss a few old selfies. 

Here are the nuts and bolts to jump in:  
1. **Go to: https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (yes, legit, check for yourself).
2. Make an account—it took me less than three minutes.  
3. Browse a list of beta test jobs and click ones you want. LOTS of genres—games, shopping, AI tools. 

After you finish a short list of tasks in the app, return to **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and hit submit. Some tasks pay per download, others per bug you find, but all of them pay out.  

Oh, and lol, I already got invited back for a “VIP app test” just for giving detailed notes. No idea what that means, but it paid more.  
I HAVE NO TECH EXPERIENCE. Let that sink in. Just vibes. Just scrolling and swiping. 

Someone, please explain how this is real??  
Meanwhile, if you want “side hustle that feels like sneaky phone time,” try **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (yes, emphasizing AGAIN because this isn’t something you want to miss out on).

Seriously, am I dreaming or are companies low-key *begging* us to break their apps for cash now?   
Would love to hear if anyone else is as confused/ shocked about this whole beta game changer!",1,1756110539.0,AIpoweredInfluencer,0,1.0,False

I clocked in at 9:58 p.m. sharp, rain coming down in silver sheets over the glass doors. The lobby was warm and too bright, smelling like carpet cleaner and the sour edge of old coffee. Linda was already shrugging into her coat, telling me goodnight with that look she always had—the one that says better you than me, Eddie.

Just me, her, and Frank the security guard now. Frank never leaves the front desk—eyes half on the monitors, half on whatever paperback he’s chewing through this week. He glanced up as I rolled my mop bucket past.

“You got the fourteenth tonight?” he asked.

“Sure,” I said. “Hope the ghosts help mop.”

Frank didn’t smile. “Don’t joke about the fourteenth, Eddie. Not here.”

He had that way of saying things like it was part warning, part habit—old stories too old to be true and too close to skip. I waved it off, swiped my badge, and took the elevator up.

The elevator groaned all the way to the twentieth, panel light buzzing like a fly trapped behind glass. First pass: trash cans, quick vacuum, wipe the breakroom counters. I’ve done this fifteen years. Office buildings at night all smell the same—stale coffee, printer toner, the faint sting of window cleaner. You learn the music of empty places: the hiss in the vents, exit signs that hum, the long pause before a relay clicks and a light wakes up.

On eighteen, a desk chair at the far end of the hall was turning when I came in. No open windows, no vents strong enough for that. Just a slow swivel, like a clock hand. I caught it and set it straight. It didn’t feel like anything, not yet.

Seventeen: the breakroom TV snapped on while I was wiping the counter. No channel, just a snow of dead stations. Then it shut itself off. I thumbed my radio. “Power flicker?”

Frank crackled back, bored as ever: “Not that I see. Cameras look fine.”

When I left, the elevator at the hall’s end dinged open on its own. Empty car. Doors staying wide like it was waiting. The panel showed the fourteen button lit.

I didn’t get in.

Back when I started, the older guys told me things about this place. Said the tower went up on top of a warehouse fire back in the ’20s, some bootlegger turf war. Fourteen men trapped inside. “Fourteenth floor for fourteen souls,” an old guy told me, then laughed, then checked behind him anyway.

The lobby’s got a plaque about post-war steel and modern design. It leaves out the strike in ’49 when four men fell on this floor and died quick. Leaves out the secretary in ’61 who jumped after-hours. Leaves out the guy in ’77 who swore someone kept calling his name from the stairwell until he… didn’t come back to work.

No one likes the fourteenth. No one says why. They just don’t.

On twelve, Frank keyed the radio. “You been up here yet?”

“Not yet. Why?”

“Thought I saw someone by the copy room.”

The hallway was the same as always—gray carpet, framed prints of blue skies nobody ever looks at. The copy room door stood half-open, light buzzing. Nobody inside. Just the smell of fresh coffee, too strong to be imagination. The pot was cold and empty. I checked the drawer for filters. Full. I touched the burner. Cold.

Ten floors down, the conference room screen was unrolled like it had been waiting. Across the white surface, in thick black marker: HELLO.

The capless marker sat in the trash with a ring of ink blooming around its tip. I put the cap back on. It felt like tidying up after a kid. I left fast.

“Frank?” I said on the radio.

Static.

“Lobby, you there?”

Nothing but the faint hum of a channel that refuses to admit it’s dead. The phones on the walls didn’t have dial tones either. The elevator at the far end lit up again: fourteen and three, both buttons glowing red. The doors slid open. Waiting.

I took the stairs.

The fourteenth was wrong from the second the door pushed in. The lights here always feel half a watt dimmer, but tonight they looked like they were trying to dim themselves. The air was warm and heavy, smelling of bleach and something underneath it—hot metal, maybe, or old smoke risen out of old paint.

Wet footprints led down the main hall. Bare. Heel, arch, toes. Water beading in the tread, not yet soaked in. They came from the elevator, arced past three cubicles and a copier, and stopped at the supply closet.

I followed. It’s my job. You follow mess to where it lives.

The closet was empty. Mop sink dripping slow into a half-full bucket. The water gray as dishwater. My cart was with me. I touched the bucket. The plastic trembled to the drip. It looked like it had been filled a long time ago and then only ever moved by the building breathing.

The footprints ended at the drain.

I wiped the rim with the corner of my rag for no reason at all. Habit. Someone else’s bucket shouldn’t be here, but here it was.

Down the hall, the elevator chimed again. Farther away, a relay clicked. The exit sign over the fire door flickered and steadied. I stood very still and listened. The building has a voice if you let it talk. Tonight it was saying something in a language made of air and humming and the sound of water finding ways to be where it didn’t belong.

I cut down to three. The fire doors there were propped open with a chair, though I’d checked the bar earlier. The clocks on this floor all pointed to 3:03—wall clocks, someone’s desk clock, a battery thing shaped like a cat. My watch said 12:31. The second hand on the cat’s tail wasn’t moving at all.

There’s a little breakroom on three where HR does birthday sheet cakes and awkward clapping. They’ve got a tiny security monitor in the corner—grainy black-and-white feed, one camera per floor, cycling fast enough to make you sick if you stare too long.

Every floor was empty. Even the ones with the cleaning lights still on. Empty chairs, empty doors, empty halls. Then fourteen came up: someone standing in the center of the corridor, between the two beige planters and the abstract painting of a blue wave. Too dark to see the face. Too steady to be a trick of the lens.

The screen flipped to fifteen. Empty. Sixteen. Empty. Back to fourteen. The figure had turned toward the camera, head tilted like it was listening through the walls.

The radio on my hip hissed. Not Frank’s bored baritone. Not anything I recognized. Low. Wet. It said my name.

I didn’t answer. I turned the radio off and put it on the counter like it might contaminate anything I kept touching.

I went to the lobby. The mop bucket rattled behind me on the stairs like it didn’t want to come either. You learn to feel when a place is watching you. I felt watched.

The lobby was empty. Frank’s chair at the desk was slowly spinning. His paperback lay on the floor as if he’d let go of it and someone else had put it down, not dropped it. The monitors above the desk showed every camera at once, a grid of ghostly halls. Fourteen was empty now. Three showed the lobby. Me, standing at the desk, in black and white.

And something behind me.

I turned. Just the glass doors and the rain and the dark. No shape. No breath. But on the monitor the thing took a step closer to the me on the screen.

“Frank?” I said. “Where are you?”

The monitor grid flipped without my touching anything. Fourteen. The figure again, closer to the camera now. It had the suggestion of a face the way a burn mark on a beam looks like a face if you stare too long. It looked like it had been waiting a long time to be seen.

My radio hissed back to life without being on. A voice I knew this time, whispering like he’d cupped his hand around his mouth in a closet somewhere. Frank. “Eddie,” he said. “Eddie, don’t take the elevator.”

“How do I—where are you?”

The grid flipped to the stairwell between thirteen and fourteen. The camera angle is bad there, high and pointing into the gloom. Someone was standing with their back to the door. The outline looked like Frank’s—wide shoulders, the slouch of a man who’s sat too long. He didn’t move.

“Frank,” I said, into an empty room. “Walk down.”

“Can’t,” the radio said. “It’s… crowded.”

The monitors ticked through floors. Three-oh-three on every clock I could see. Fourteen came up again. The figure was gone. The camera shook a little. Static. The feed flashed to white for a hiss of a second—like the old TV upstairs—then came back.

A wet footprint appeared on the lobby tile behind me. Not the monitor. Real tile. I watched the water bead in the tread.

Then another. Closer.

I faced the doors. The glass fogged at my breath. Behind me, another footprint. The air smelled like bleach and something underneath it—smoke baked into paint too many coats down to scrub. The kind of smell that never leaves a building, not really. It just gets taught to keep quiet.

The elevator dinged. Fourteen lit on the panel. The doors slid open and waited. The lobby lights dipped and came up again and made every shadow look like somebody’s idea of a person.

“Eddie,” the radio said, close and far at the same time. “You’re not alone on cleanup tonight.”

I took a step. The footprint on the tile matched it, a half-beat off, like it was learning my rhythm. Another step, and the damp print pressed next to my heel. You can feel eyes on your neck even if they belong to something without a face.

I didn’t want to die in a lobby. Not under a security camera and a framed print of a sailboat. I picked up my radio. I picked up my keys. I left the bucket where it was. I walked past the spinning chair and the paperback and the monitors that didn’t bother pretending anymore. The elevator waited like a mouth.

My hand went to the seam of the doors. Cold. I looked up once, at the plaque with its neat little paragraph about post-war steel and modern design. It shined. It left out everything.

The doors started to close on their own. I put my hand in and they opened again, polite. The red light on fourteen glowed steady and patient.

There’s a superstition cleaners have, one we don’t say out loud because it makes you look like a fool. Don’t follow wet footprints if you can’t see who’s making them. Don’t answer a door held open by no one. Don’t believe a clock that says three-oh-three unless it belongs to your own wrist.

I stepped inside anyway.

The doors slid shut without a sound. The panel did not ask me what floor I wanted. It already knew. The car lurched in a way I’ve never felt in all my years. Not up. Not down. Somewhere that felt like inside the building’s memory.

As the numbers blinked over the door for no one at all, the radio breathed once, then went quiet. The last thing I saw before the doors met was my reflection in the glass—my face and, a step behind, something that looked a little like me if you let the smoke erase the parts that make a person recommend themselves to other people.

If anyone finds this on the desk in the morning, wipe the prints up. Tell Linda I was on time. Tell Frank I listened. And if you’re reading this before your shift and the panel is already lit for fourteen, take the stairs and go home sick. Some floors don’t want to be clean.

And if the clocks say 3:03, you’re already late.",6,1756110154.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1. A ruby Port
2. A scotch
3. & A Apricot Liqueur (specifically [Abricot du Roussillon](https://www.giffard.com/en/liqueurs-premium/367-abricot-du-roussillon-3.html?srsltid=AfmBOopVV5TqBG0sw0Eek6VqCFHimsjfNPQMGtZdU_EUYi5DCX_NdnZ_))

5. Lime juice

I have another cocktail that uses the same technique and in that recipe it's advised to put the mixture in a fridge for at least 12hrs. What is the effect of this?

1mzkt21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dharamshala/comments/1mzkt21/can_we_have_another_espresso/,Can we have another espresso?,"It has been three months since I last met this guy. He is a man who will disappear and then reappear; he was like a ghost. He wanted me to call him Jack Reacher. I told him to fuck off. But every time he comes to me and introduces himself as Jack Reacher, we both smile, and I close my laptop consciously.

I like him. I like our conversations, and above all, I like his company. He is real; he will share his failures mostly, and we both will laugh. We may end up with a long walk, or should I say, it will end up with a dip in a waterfall. Irrespective of whether it rains or shines, it is just two guys having a cup of coffee and a crazy conversation. That's life, ain't it? Or who knows? As far as I know, no one has figured it out, and the last thing we will trust is a guy who is in robes and claims he has seen God. If he has seen God, he wouldn't speak about God, and if he speaks about God, then we were pretty sure he hasn't seen God. We were not atheists; we were not believers either. We are just two guys trying to figure out life, sharing our miseries along the way. That's our relationship. Not a penny more, not a penny less.

He went to Lucknow, then to Ladakh, and he was here. I looked at him, and he looked at me. It was a Sunday, and it was raining. He wanted to go to the church; strangely, I agreed. It was raining, and we both never cared. Jack Reacher started speaking.

We were almost killed at the main square by this big, bad SUV. I don't want to go into the details; my angry friend wanted to break the window. It was drama, and once the drama was over, we went for a chai. The chai was 20 feet away, and I asked him, ""Why so much anger?"" His anger turned into a story, and it was a crazy one. Our hero had gone to Varanasi, and this is where it took a Bollywood turn. Trust me, all his stories will have crazy turns, and many times I had ended up as a character in his stories, and every time, I had regretted it. Now over to him and his story. Whether it is real or not, I don't care, and neither should you. We paid the Lhunpo guy thirty rupees for two chais. I think he recognized us, or he smiles for everyone; I don't know, neither should you. We crossed the small temple and started walking into the area filled with pine trees. You won't believe there is a place where monkeys take a shower too. That's true, and he started speaking. Over to him.

""I was on the Ganga River, and that's when I saw her. The only thing that came to my mind was actor Dhanush, but imagine replacing him with a French guy with blonde hair. It was disgusting."" Yet, I accepted it and continued listening. Our hero was in a boat, and it seems our heroine was in another boat, and their boats crossed. I imagined a blonde with blue eyes; don't ask me why, I am biased towards blondes. ""Was she a blonde?"" ""No, a brunette,"" was his reply. ""Blue eyes?"" ""No, hazel."" Oh God, I had to keep changing my imagination. I thought I would make a veena play in the background, but I guess it is a love story between two white people, so I thought I would settle for a violin. The violin was playing in the background, and we crossed the only chai shop on the right, which had an amazing view of the valley. We stopped unconsciously, and we both didn't speak. We were immersed in the mountains, and we allowed the silence of the mountains to echo inside our hearts. We stood in silence, and one huge horn broke that moment. India. And we started walking again.

""Was she French too?"" ""No, idiot. She is Indian."" I threw away the violin and got the veena back, and now a sitar was also, playing in the background, and we continued walking. Six army guys ran past us like F1 cars in full throttle, and I was cursing myself for not running that day. Our hero continued his story. He told me he fell in love at first sight. Coming from him was a surprise, as I know he was very stable in his head, and I realized the story was getting a serious narrative. He told me he simply knew, and he instructed the boat guy to make a turn and follow the boat.

I was imagining in my mind, and I was thinking at the same Varanasi, I was chasing aghoris. Anyways, it is his story, and let's listen to him. So, after a boat chase, our hero accosted her, and she was surprised. I am going to change the name of the girl, and I am going to call her Anjali, so it is easy for us to follow. So, our hero meets Anjali and convinces her for dinner, and he takes her to this amazing restaurant. Honest to God, I have been to that restaurant, and it is not amazing, but when you are in love, even an espresso will taste like Indian chocolate. So, in that amazing restaurant, they both met, and I don't know what they spoke about. But our Jack Reacher convinced her for a trip to the temple, and they kept hanging out together for four days.

We were in the church of St John at the wilderness, at this time, and there were many tourists around us. One couple looked at me and immediately handed over their phone, as if they knew I would take pictures of them. I obliged, and we sat on the stone bench. After being a photographer, I turned into a listener. Do I have a choice? I was like this boat on a river with no oars. Our hero continued in vivid detail.

He told me every evening turned into a magical tale, and every moment was filled with magic. On a Saturday night, she confessed that she would leave on Monday morning but promised him that she would stay in touch. When he told me this, he had a huge gasp of breath. So, I turned away, and I saw this girl with a weird tattoo whom I had seen before. Our hero was angry, and he nearly punched me, so I turned towards this attention-seeking asshole and moved my eyes from that girl with a weird tattoo. I need to speak a lot about that tattoo, but this is his story and not mine.

I looked at him, and he continued. It was Sunday night, and this time she didn't leave to her place after dinner. He paused. It was my turn to give a deep breath. Obviously, he got laid. Then I looked at him quizzically, and he continued. So, our hero met the heroine, and apparently, they had a good time. So, what next?

It started drizzling, and we both started walking again. So, we went to the road and started climbing uphill. We don't use the normal ways; I don't know why either. So, we took the road towards the Hyatt, and strangely, he was silent. We kept walking, and when we crossed the place where monkeys take a bath, I turned and looked at him; he was in tears. WTF was my thought.

When people cry, I simply allow them to complete that ritual. It is a way of cleansing. I unfolded my umbrella, and he did the same. We simply walked all the way, getting drenched. We reached his room. No words spoken. I switched on the heater, and we sat opposite each other.

""Bro, why don't we meet at Nick's for coffee in an hour?"" He said, ""Yes.""

Epilogue

Over a cup of coffee, he confessed she had blocked him. After she left Varanasi, there was complete radio silence from her end. Being a professional hacker, he tracked her online and saw her wedding photographs along with a guy who looked like Gerard Butler. He showed me those photographs with tears in his eyes. It looked she got married that Wednesday. Dear readers, what should I say? You do know I am a guy filled with understanding and empathy.

I said this, ""Can we have another espresso?""

He nodded. We ended up at the Bhagsu waterfall, and that's how the night ended for us and I did see the girl with a weird tattoo while having dinner the next day, but does it matter? I don't know. You tell me.

How should I deal with it?"," I had a friend back in college. We weren't extremely close, but I had a crush on her. But circumstances stopped me from acting on it. College ended with us on bad terms after a fight and went no contact.

Years later, I’ve been happily married for 3 years and have a baby. Four months ago, I went to a reunion with my family and ran into her. We caught up briefly and moved on.

From then on she started popping up randomly. First were Random messages/calls ( I don't even have her number). When it got uncomfortable, I ghosted. Then one day she showed up at my shop, met my wife and child, and before leaving she quietly asked me to grab coffee sometime. I just said no.

Some weeks later she popped up again, saying she’d moved to my town for work. Then I started seeing her frequently in my usual places, often when I was with my wife. She would just smile and walk away.

The final straw was when she approached as I was closing my shop. She’d locked her keys in her car and asked if I could drop her at home since she had a spare there. I agreed.  I informed my wife about this. Later on the way she shared her personal life, She kinda hinted she was single and told me that my wife shouldn't need to know everything happening with me and she's controlling for needing every detail. I clarified that I would want my wife to inform me about situations like this if she ever faced and trust in marriage works that way. When we arrived, she went in for a hug but I shook her hand and left.

Later, I came across a reunion video and noticed how she looked at my wife and kid.  My gut tells me something is off, like a real creepy vibe.

My wife doesn’t know the full story yet. Not sure if I’m overthinking or if I need to just straight up tell this old friend to back off?

1mzkpxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/1mzkpxf/side_brushes_and_dirty_floors/,Side Brushes and Dirty Floors,"Yesterday, I watched a new video about the Narwal Flow robot vacuum. It got me thinking about something that seems a bit odd—maybe it's not the first robot to do this, but I still find it strange.

When there's a spill on the floor—like ketchup, coffee, or something greasy—the robot goes over it with its brushes spinning, and then it starts mopping. Some advanced robots can detect the mess and keep mopping that area until it's clean, which is great. But here's the question: why do they keep the brushes running over the spill? Are the brushes cleaned afterward when the robot returns to the docking station to empty the dustbin or water tank? It doesn’t make much sense to let the brushes get dirty like that, especially if they’re not being cleaned properly. I know some robots can vacuum first and then mop, or do just one of those tasks. That’s a good feature. But for the ones that do both at the same time—do they stop the brushes when mopping? And what happens to the main brush and side brushes after a few weeks of use? Don’t they get dirty and smelly from going over wet spills?",2,1756109762.0,RobotVacuums,1,1.0,False
