1hufwbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/NannyEmployers/comments/1hufwbu/nanny_onboarding_w_8week_old/,Nanny Onboarding w 8week old ,"Hi everyone!
Looking for advice and best practices for onboarding our new nanny for our 8 week old as I go back to work (fully remote from home) a few days after she starts. 

We have 2 older kids (5,3) who started amazing daycares at 16 weeks. We‚Äôve never had a nanny before so it‚Äôs new territory for us. She‚Äôll be responsible only for the baby 45h/week. 

Questions I have: 
- what are some forgotten best practices for onboarding? I have a binder w basics like emergency contacts, petty cash, her contract, house info, anything else that could be helpful?

- what does a nanny do w an 8 week old/such a young infant? I‚Äôm sad to not have contact naps and cuddles especially since she‚Äôs my last and this is so early for me  :( We‚Äôre on east coast so it‚Äôs cold and illness season. 

- how do you best navigate breastfeeding? I think I‚Äôll plan for at least one pump / bottle feed so I can get chunks of focused work time but baby schedule is still relatively non existent and feel slightly overwhelmed to figure this out/also get some time w baby during the day. 

- what is something you/an employer did to make your caregiver/you feel special and cared for early on? I‚Äôll ask about her bday and favs snacks/drinks but anything else? 

- working from home, any advice? I plan to get noise canceling headphones, work from a coffee shop a block  away set some expectations around door closed vs open. 

Anything else you can think of!! Thank you! ",1,1736107648.0,NannyEmployers,1,1.0,False

I'm a 37 year old woman living in vibrant Los Angeles and I'm looking to connect with like-minded people who love making the most of life's little moments. Whether it's discovering hidden gems in the city, trying new activities, or just sharing a good mood, I believe life is about enjoying the journey and finding joy in everyday things. üí´

I'm Looking For

Real Connections I'm here to make real, meaningful connections whether it's for fun friendships, new experiences, or just good conversation. No pressure, just open, relaxed interactions.

Life is too short to be stuck in a routine! Let's explore the best of Los Angeles, whether it's a casual coffee date, an art gallery visit, or an impromptu trip to the beach. I love spontaneity and discovering new places. üåü

I value deep conversations that go beyond small talk. Let's talk about passions, dreams, or even random musings. I believe genuine conversations lead to the best connections. üó£Ô∏èüí¨

I'm not interested in drama or anything forced. I want to be surrounded by people who appreciate the simple pleasures in life and are willing to share those moments with others. Whether it's laughing over coffee or enjoying a quiet sunset, let's connect and create memories together.

There's no time for games, miscommunication, or misunderstandings. I just want to keep it real and respect each other's time and energy.

I'm here for real connection, not exchanging anything material or superficial.

I love creativity and artistic expression, whether it's visiting museums, attending local events, or just soaking up the cultural diversity of Los Angeles.

I love the outdoors, but I also enjoy a cozy evening with a good book or a movie marathon.

I'm always looking for new experiences, whether it's trying new cuisine, exploring new parts of the city, or just watching the world go by while sipping coffee.

If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, send me a message! Let's share some moments, have meaningful conversations, and maybe discover a new favorite spot together. üòä‚ú®",1,1736107634.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

WOW. a few hours ago I was breathing VERY loudly at a test center. My very busy test center that doubled as a farmers insurance & identigo was packed; this wouldn't have been a problem for me, except, I wasn't about to take my test-I was in the middle of it. As i came back to my computer at the bare end of my break, the computer asked for an admin to login. This was bad news for me since the center was packed. More assertively than normal, but without causing a major scene, I explained to 2 women why i needed to cut in line and they understood.

**Tip: It's not a 10 minute break. If you wait till the end of the 10 minutes and go over, the timer will start WITHOUT the exam moving on. That means if the bathroom line is 15 minutes, you'd lose 5 minutes from your test.**

  
First off: I am a teacher and consider my self a good test taker. As soon as I got my whiteboard, I  wrote down the equations from [this video](https://youtu.be/zD15S_61lwI?si=QDgE1vl-kwx5ZyV6), 2-3 bible verses, and several mnemonics for things i struggled with. I practiced exactly what was going to be writing on my whiteboard the day before, and rwice before the test. Re-writing really helped me memorize them. I also used active recall to review my notes. I used practice sets on quizlet to help me understand a lot of the diagrams.

**Resources I'd use again**     

 Private Project Management Crash Course- I attended [Morehouse School Of Medicine's Summer Pipeline Program.  ](https://www.msm.edu/Education/PipelinePrograms/summerprograms.php) It's completely free, and has a 500$ stipend. I recommend it, but if you want more details PM me. I only mention the stipend because the pipeline had a ""crash course"" by Dr. Josh Simon, which gave me a monetary incentive to take it serious. He was engaging and I participated fully in a virtual class of my peers & scored well. A group of peers and I decided to study, but didn't really communicate after that (my bad).

Landini-Thank you so so much to the people who suggested this. Really helps with he mindset. I was scoring lowest 68% (predictive) and highest 80 (core concepts)

Pocketprep -free edition, a little everyday. I did use my husbands account at one point to retake the practice test

David McLachlan- PMBOK GUIDE & SENERIO QUESTIONS ARE A MUST!!!!

Rita's CAPM book-tbh I only skimmed this book. I wish I spent more time on it, but didn't see agile or BA mentioned so i limited my time here.

Second time plugging equation memonics because it's worth it [https://youtu.be/zD15S\_61lwI?si=QDgE1vl-kwx5ZyV6](https://youtu.be/zD15S_61lwI?si=QDgE1vl-kwx5ZyV6)

ALVIN THE PM-wow wow wow. I owe him a coffee

Praizion pmp- Surprised more people don't mention him. Listen free on Spotify or youtube on my walks for agile mindset topics

Simplilearn- also has free videos on agile & Scrum to listen to during your 10k steps.



**Resources to Avoid**

Exam topics-  Spend your time focused on learning how to apply your knowledge, not looking at all their questions.

AR course on UDEMY- boring, watched on 2x. I really tried with this one since other redditors recommended. The painting scenario is imprinted on my brain. Who knows, maybe it helped me with mindset. Was free via my libraries usage of udemy gale.

How to get every Contract Calculation question right on the PMP- this 8 dollar book was 1.99 at half price books. It helped me become more confident in contract types, but these concepts are for pmp, not capm.

Ever felt like you're slowly morphing into the Hunchback of Notre-Dame after a long day at your desk? I've been there, pal. But I've also found the holy grail of office seating - the best ergonomic office chairs for back pain. Let's dive in and find your perfect fit!
  
  
## The Great Chair Debacle

Finding the right office chair can feel like a quest for the Holy Grail‚Äîif the Grail were crammed with sore backs, questionable posture, and a hint of regret. I‚Äôve had my fair share of chair disasters that made me question my life choices. Picture this: I'm sitting on what looked like a vintage piece of furniture, courtesy of a very generous second-hand shop. It had all the charm of a medieval torture device. The grim realization hit me harder than the cheap plastic arms digging into my sides: after a few hours, my back felt like it was begging for mercy.

Then there was that time I tried the ‚Äúcutting-edge‚Äù mesh chair, which promised to be breathable. What I didn‚Äôt realize is that it was less breathable and more like a fishnet stocking for my backside. I sunk into it like quicksand; my posture reigned supreme as I flailed desperately to sit upright. Spoiler alert: I didn‚Äôt. 

Let's not forget the infamous ‚Äúgaming chair‚Äù episode. Everyone raved about how comfortable they were. Wrong! It was like sitting on a rock with arms that called out to my shoulders for help. By the end of my workday, I felt like an ancient relic‚Äîjust dust and creaky joints. It‚Äôs comical now, but the importance of a good ergonomic chair hit me harder than my old gaming chair‚Äôs armrest when I tried to get up without negotiating with gravity. 

## Ergo-What? Demystifying the Ergonomic Jargon

Finding the right ergonomic chair can feel overwhelming, like trying to navigate a maze without a map. So, let's break down this ergonomic jargon into bite-sized pieces that even a hamster could understand‚Äîno offense to hamsters intended!

Read more: <https://tedsadvice.com/what-are-the-best-ergonomic-office-chairs-for-back-pain> 

First up, we have ‚Äúlumbar support.‚Äù Think of your lower back as a delicate bridge. If it doesn‚Äôt have proper support, you might as well be building it with marshmallows! Lumbar support helps maintain the natural curve of your spine, preventing that nasty backache you get after a long day. I once had a chair that was about as supportive as a wet noodle, and my back didn‚Äôt just complain‚Äîit staged a full-scale coup!

Next, there‚Äôs ‚Äúadjustability.‚Äù This term is like ordering pizza with toppings‚Äîyou get to customize it! An ergonomic chair should fit you like your favorite hoodie, easily adjusting in height, depth, and armrest positions. I learned my lesson here after purchasing a chair that had all the adjustability of a concrete block. My elbows were so high, I could've joined a basketball team‚Äîif only my legs would touch the ground!

And let‚Äôs not forget ‚Äúseat depth.‚Äù You want a chair that allows you to sit back comfortably without feeling like you‚Äôre about to slide into the unknown. It‚Äôs like sitting in a car that you have to squish into‚Äîless fun and more back pain. Your seat cushion should let you sit with your back against the chair while still allowing a couple of fingers' space between your knees and the edge. Too little space? You‚Äôll feel like a sardine. Too much? Let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs a recipe for slouching.

So, as you venture into the world of ergonomic chairs, remember these terms and know what you‚Äôre looking for. Who knew fancy chairs could be this complicated, right? But trust me, investing a little time in understanding them can save your back‚Äîand sanity‚Äîdown the road!

## Meet the Contenders: My Top Picks

Finding the right ergonomic chair feels a bit like going on a quest for the Holy Grail‚Äîonly in this quest, the stakes are my back's sanity and my productivity, which are often at odds. The struggle is real, my friends! Here are my top five ergonomic chairs, each with its unique flair that might save your back from an early retirement.

First up, we have the chair that feels like a hug from a friendly bear. Its adjustable lumbar support was a game-changer for me. I remember sitting on it during a long video call and felt like I was being gently cradled instead of crushed. Seriously, my back hasn't said a peep since.

Next, there's the sleek and sassy one with the fancy mesh back. It almost looks like it‚Äôs saying, ""Look at me, I‚Äôm stylish!"" But beyond its good looks, it keeps you cool‚Äîliterally. I used to sweat buckets during hot afternoons, but this chair lets my back breathe. 

Thirdly, a classic‚Äîit's like the dependable friend who always shows up to help you move. It‚Äôs solid and sturdy, with a wide seat that reminds me of my favorite armchair at home. Gone are the days of uncomfortable squirming!

Let‚Äôs not forget the one with the magical reclining feature. I may or may not have taken a cheeky nap in it once. Feeling like you‚Äôre in a recliner during work hours is hard to beat! 

Last but not least is the chair designed for taller folks. At 5‚Äô4‚Äù, it‚Äôs a stretch for me, but its height adjustments are unreal. It comes with a remarkable headrest that I never knew I needed until I tried it. Plus, chatting with my taller friends, they just rave about it. 

These five contenders have each left their mark in my hunt for the perfect ergonomic experience and, boy, have they turned my workspace into a back-friendly zone!

## The Chair-Off: Putting Them to the Test

I decided it was high time for a thorough device showdown, pitting one ergonomic office chair against another in my living room battleground. Picture this: me, armed with a notepad, snacks (priorities, right?), and a playlist that kept me bopping between productivity and pure chaos. My mission? To find the top-notch chair that wouldn‚Äôt leave my back feeling like it just went twelve rounds with a heavyweight boxer.

First up in the chair-off, I parked myself in the chair that boasted ‚Äúultimate comfort.‚Äù At first, it felt like sitting on a cloud made of marshmallows. But by the three-hour mark, I noticed an unwelcome sensation creeping in‚Äîlike my back was sending an SOS signal. Not exactly what you want during a Netflix binge or halfway through writing my next ‚Äúdeep‚Äù blog post.

Next, I slid into the ‚Äúadjustable champion.‚Äù I twisted knobs, pulled levers, and felt like a kid playing with a spaceship. The ability to crank the seat height was liberating. I could practically float! However, after a solid work session, it did start to feel a bit wobbly‚Äîlike that one friend who can‚Äôt hold onto their coffee cup on a bumpy ride.

In my rigorous testing, I learned each chair has its strengths and quirks. Some left me floating, while others felt more like a sinking ship. Which one came out on top? Let‚Äôs just say, it was harder to choose than my favorite flavor of ice cream! How do you prefer your chair: a solid ride that keeps you anchored or a soft embrace that might need some reinforcement?

## The One That Got Away: My Honorable Mentions

Finding the perfect ergonomic chair is a bit like searching for the Holy Grail‚Äîsometimes you stumble upon pieces that just shine but don‚Äôt quite fit into your quest. I‚Äôve had my fair share of these near-misses. I mean, let me tell you about the chairs that, while they didn't make the final cut, were still fantastic in their own right. 

One that stands out had a breathable mesh back that felt like it was creating a delightful breeze right when I needed it. I envisioned myself on a beach, just chilling, instead of wedged in my office with stacks of paper towering around me. The adjustable lumbar support? Brilliant! Yet, for some reason, it felt a bit too bouncy for my taste‚Äîlike a trampoline chair, and no one wants to do backflips while trying to write a report. 

Then there was a chair with memory foam that cradled you like a nice hot chocolate on a cold day. But, alas, I‚Äôd sink into it like I was diving into quicksand. Getting back up to fetch a pen felt like a scene from a slow-motion movie. 

Another had stylish armrests that swung out, perfect for my ever-changing positions. But they didn't quite match my desk height, making me feel like a giraffe at a picnic. 

So while these chairs didn‚Äôt win me over, they might be just the ticket for someone else seeking comfort over crunching numbers. Who knows? Here‚Äôs to those almost-chairs!

## The Final Countdown: My Top Picks Revealed

Finding the right ergonomic chair feels like searching for a unicorn, doesn‚Äôt it? You know it exists, but where? After going through what felt like a million options, I‚Äôm ecstatic to share my top picks that truly stood out and have significantly improved my work-from-home life.

First up, comfort was a game changer. One chair had this pillow-like support that cradled my back like it was my best friend during movie night. It was as if it was saying, ‚ÄúSit for hours; I got your back!‚Äù I no longer felt like I was wrestling with my chair to find some semblance of comfort. And that‚Äôs saying a lot about my previous experience, where I sometimes felt like I was balancing on a seesaw!

Then there's the adjustability factor. You know how sometimes you can feel like Goldilocks, searching for what‚Äôs ""just right""? I found a chair with myriad settings; I could adjust everything from the height to the tilt. Honestly, I could probably adjust it to perfectly match the angle of my couch for those ‚Äúlook-like-I‚Äôm-working-but-definitely-napping‚Äù moments.

Lastly, the style! I mean, let‚Äôs be real, I want my office to look good too. Some of these chairs didn‚Äôt just look ergonomic; they looked like a work of art! It felt great to sit in a chair that made me feel empowered, as if I was conquering my to-do list one ergonomically correct sitting session at a time. Which chair would you trust to support your endeavors?

## Conclusions
  
  
So, there you have it! My tried-and-true guide to the best ergonomic office chairs for back pain. Remember, everyone's body is unique, so what works for me might not be your cup of tea.

### **Key Features: Brewing Perfection in Detail**

The Moccamaster KBT boasts several features designed to elevate your coffee brewing experience.

* **Thermal Carafe & Travel Lid:** The stainless steel thermal carafe is a standout feature.  It keeps your coffee hot for up to an hour, significantly longer than many glass carafes. The included travel lid further extends this retention, making it perfect for taking your coffee on the go.

* **Copper Boiling Element:** The heart of the Moccamaster KBT lies in its copper boiling element. This element rapidly heats water to the optimal brewing temperature ‚Äì between 196¬∫ and 205¬∫ F ‚Äì ensuring consistent extraction and superior flavor.

* **Pre-Immersion Drip-Style System:** This brewer employs a unique pre-immersion drip-style system.  The water is gently pulsed over the coffee grounds, ensuring even saturation and a perfect """"bloom,"""" maximizing the release of aromas and flavors.

* **Brew Basket & Adjustable Flow:** The manual-adjust drip-stop brew basket allows for precise control over the brewing speed. This is particularly useful for experimenting with different coffee bean types and grind sizes to achieve your desired flavor profile.

## **Moccamaster KBT vs. Other Coffee Makers: A Comparative Analysis**

The Moccamaster KBT distinguishes itself from other coffee makers in several key areas.  Its brewing speed, for instance, is significantly faster than many competitors, brewing a full 40oz pot in just 6 minutes. The thermal carafe's excellent heat retention (up to an hour) ensures your coffee stays piping hot, unlike many glass carafes. The copper boiling element contributes to precise temperature control, resulting in superior coffee extraction.

Comparing the Moccamaster KBT to other pour over coffee makers often highlights its speed and temperature control as major advantages.  Many coffee brewer comparisons place the Moccamaster KBT at the top of its class.

A review from a satisfied user, found on Whole Latte Love (a reputable source for coffee equipment reviews), praised the KBT‚Äôs copper boiling element for its rapid and precise heating, leading to perfectly extracted coffee.

Pictured is the design we were working with, i photoshopped in that cabinet on the left (in case you can't tell lol). In that space to the right currently is a wall oven, above that a convection toaster oven, above that a microwave. We were planning on using that space (the existing 'cutout' in the wall) as a 'coffee nook', with a furniture-like hutch/pantry cabinet to the left as shown (not this exact style because I'd like something primarily for storing food, with two primary doors that open to expose everything at once). It can only come about 10"" out from the wall or else it will block the door. 

[i know this looks like :poo:](https://preview.redd.it/tpjrpwtcb8be1.jpg?width=1916&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e1f03a50ea9def37ac3caa59663cd73b28280e9)

Now I'm thinking it would look way more cohesive to have one big unit covering this whole space, but still taking advantage of that cutout into the wall where the appliances are. So like a nice wide, simple food pantry with probably two side-by-side doors, but the right-most 24"" is like .... an extra 30"" deep :) (eg for a microwave, kitchen aid, and coffee machine) Would this be an insane request and we'd be much better off just doing a separate cabinet for the 24"" wide space on the right and get something matching on the left, or is it doable?",1,1736107151.0,cabinetry,0,1.0,False
1hufozd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hufozd/aita_for_giving_my_friend_feedback/,AITA for giving my friend feedback?,"I'm sorry this is so long. I felt the context was important!

My friends and I have created a board for a local nonprofit. It's complicated, but it previously just had multiple sponsors to operate and has been very disorganized. There has also been issues with one or two members gatekeeping information, miscommunicating between sponsors and members, and taking on too much, therefore running things poorly. We have created the board and applied for 501c3 status. We invited in 2 other friends of ours from the community, one of whom founded the organization 8 years ago, to help build connections and make sure this would be as successful as possible. We hoped that creating a team would prevent a lot of the issues that have been experienced in the past.

Since joining, our founder friend has done some good work and also caused a lot of issues within the board. It seems as though they believe their ideas and thoughts are the only valid ones and are not open to adjusting them or even discussing them. Once they've made a decision, that's it and everyone else's suggestions or ideas get dismissed. They also have been gatekeeping information, not utilizing the shared database, and ""going rogue"" on taking things on and making decisions, a lot of which was the reason we started this board in the first place. Their messages to our group chat have been very passive aggressive, pointed, and repetitive.

The 3 of us who started the board have been venting to each other outside of those discussions and trying to come up with solutions. At one point, we agreed to bring it up during a meeting because it seemed as though everyone - including the founder friend - was feeling similarly dismissed and unheard. We figured a group discussion to improve communication would be the best move forward. We decided that I'd be the one to bring up the topic during the next board meeting. Between my personal and professional background, they felt that I'd be the best person to jumpstart it. In the meeting, I used blanket statements and phrased it as ""this has been happening, how do we fix it and do better in the future as a group?"". The other 2 chimed in to back up what I was saying and also provide suggestions. The founder friend took it as a personal attack and said as much during the meeting. They asked that this stuff be discussed one on one, so I told them I would stay after the meeting to talk. Even before this was brought up, they were making very pointed, passive aggressive statements, to the point that their husband (the other person we brought in) was trying to get them to listen and move on. They shut down and did not participate the rest of the meeting, just sat there with their arms crossed and staring into space. I stayed after to talk, but they started by asking if I would be able to be calm and cordial. They said that because my face had turned red, they were scared of me and what I might do. I thought I was good friends with this person and have been for about 3 years now. I am not violent and have a lot of trauma relating to some of those things. My face turns red any time I have a slightly emotional conversation because I am trying not to cry, but my verbage and tone stay professional and calm the whole time. It felt like they were trying to get a reaction out of me.

During our discussion, I learned very quickly that the founder friend does not take feedback well in any capacity. Any feedback is immediately turned around and blamed on everyone else. Nothing is their fault and they took no accountability. I figured the best thing to do was own up to my own mistakes, agree that this was miscommunication, and agree on a way forward.

A few days later, they did some things that really upset the 3 of us again, including creating a meeting agenda with unprofessional, passive aggressive notes about what not to do (ironically, things that they had done days before). They had also started acting this way towards people outside of the board. Whenever they would see any of us individually, they'd ask if so and so was avoiding them or mad at them etc, when really they were just sick, out of town, etc. I decided to have a one on one over coffee with them. I was genuinely worried that something might be going on in their life and that they were just taking it out on us. I had never seen them act this way before and it was very concerning. They came over on NYE and it did not go well at all. I brought up that I was worried and why, they insisted nothing was going on and that they didn't even know there were problems between the board members until I brought up the issues at the meeting. I know this isn't true, because they are the one who put on the agenda to discuss why there's been tension. Anytime I tried to discuss anything, it was turned around and pointed at me and the others. They called me aggressive and said that I was the reason they were acting this way. They'd also constantly make contradicting statements. For example, they asked me to bring up specific examples of things. When I did, they'd tell me they didn't want to ""rehash the details because it's just been too long"". They'd say we should bring something up to the group and when I mentioned we should add it to the agenda, they'd say a meeting wasn't the right venue and we should discuss it one on one. Our whole conversation felt like we were going in circles and that nothing I said was right. They once again took no accountability and they were more upset that the 3 of us would talk without them being involved than the fact that they were causing issues. They said it felt like we were talking shit behind their back and they didn't understand what the problem was. I kept telling them to talk to the others individually because I wouldn't speak for them, but I didn't feel that we spoke behind their back by just venting and discussing how to fix things. They also continued to complain about my face turning red and how that bothered them a lot. At the end of the conversation, I reminded them that I cared about them and felt that they'd been doing a good job with the stuff they were assigned to do, they just needed to remember to communicate and include the whole board on decisions.

I had made a last minute decision 2 days before NYE to throw a NYE party and hadn't invited them or their husband because of all the drama. They'd found out about it and decided to throw their own party, texting all of our mutual friends except for the 3 of us about an hour before mine started. This felt really petty and stupid, but I tried not to let it bother me. When our mutual friends left my place for hers, I went out with other friends and had a great night.

Over the next 2 days, the other 2 board friends had individual conversations with this person. They gave almost the same exact feedback I had and the conversations went fine. One of them did decide to quit because they realized founder friend wouldn't change and was preventing us from being successful as a group. The other kept trying to remind founder friend they needed to trust us to be able to help and do our jobs.

On Friday, I was editing our board agenda for the next meeting. Founder friend had made it (even though it was my job) and it was really disorganized, unprofessional, and included a lot of passive aggressive stream of consciousness type notes. I went in and reformatted it into old and new business and reworded what they had written to be more professional (ie instead of 3 or 4 questions asking if we should do a b or c, I just changed it to ""discuss term length and start date""). Immediately, I got a text asking if I was editing. Of course I said yes and provided examples of what I was doing. Their response was ""What was in there was fine, let's trust each others work"". This irritated me from the get go, as they have a tendency to take what we've told them and mirror it back to us as if it their original thought or a problem we caused rather than the other way around. I responded that I had reworded the info to be more professional, which did end up shortening a lot of it but that the info was still there. I mentioned that they hadn't trusted me to make the agenda and all I did was reformat. Their response was that they had never told me not to make it and that we should all trust each other that the things in there were important. I let them know that them making the agenda when the group agreed I would do it showed that they didn't trust me, they didn't say it. I repeated again that I'd left it and just reworded it because that was my job within the board. They responded that our roles were not defined (which is not true) and said ""sorry for starting it"". I told them we did have roles defined, we can review it at the next meeting, and that I felt the apology was passive aggressive. Founder friend told me to keep it professional, that they didn't want the drama and weren't trying to be passive. They apologized for stepping on my toes. I told them I had kept it professional and would not like the drama. I reminded them that I came to them because I was worried, brought feedback to fix things, and in exchange they attacked my character and things I cannot control. I said that no accountability had been taken and that I would continue to be cordial and professional, but that our friendship was not in a good place.

The last text I got reminded me of previous abusive relationships in my life. It began with a ""I'm sorry you feel I attacked your character"". Still no accountability. They went on to say they felt like our discussion did not make them feel like I cared about them, that they didn't like me speaking to others behind their back, that they don't understand what they did to make me upset. That they are not up to fighting or dealing with petty drama and that they were hurt I didn't invite them to my party. They ended it with ""I am honestly just baffled and confused by all this"".

I haven't responded and don't know that I want to. I am thinking of quitting the board as well, this drama is ridiculous and too much for me. I feel like I've done all I can to make things right but keep making them worse. I feel that I was very clear in my communication, that I provided feedback and was personally attacked as a response. I don't know what to do or how to fix this or even if I can. I've been questioning if I am the problem.

AITA?

Paid $500 upgrade fee just for Westgate to not provide said upgrade.,"First off, obligatory acknowledgment that I understand corporations are going to do gross corporation things and that ‚Äúbuying‚Äù a timeshare isn‚Äôt a good decision. My parents are the ones that got talked into it over a decade ago. Please don‚Äôt make comments about them‚Äîthey‚Äôd get out of it if it was easy.

I‚Äôll try to be concise as concise as I'm able. My (30F) parents are the ‚Äúowners‚Äù. They let my husband and I use it every other year, which is very kind of them. We have 2 children; a 4 year old and 7 year old. Our 7 year old is autistic and requires a lot of supports 24/7. We usually love our Westgate trips because the unit always comes with a huge jacuzzi tub, plus we can use the outdoor heated pools when no one else wants to in the winter. Our autistic child needs a tub because he‚Äôs terrified of and is unable to take showers. My husband needs a full kitchen because he has specific dietary needs and brings groceries to make meals at the unit.

This is what our usual unit has: 1 bedroom with king bed and giant tub, pull-out couch in living room, 2 full bathrooms, large dining table, and full kitchen (fridge/freezer, oven, stove, microwave, counterspace for food prep).

This year I decided to treat our boys and paid a $500 upgrade fee for a unit with 2 bedrooms. They have confirmed these units DO exist btw. Same exact unit as our usual one, but with 2 king bed bedrooms instead of 1.

It was such a WASTE. $500 is a lot of money for us. I‚Äôm in nursing school and not able to work right now, so if I‚Äôd known it would have been for NOTHING then I never would have paid it!!!

We booked in August 2024 for a December 2024 stay. My mom as the owner booked it over the phone and was clear we just wanted the usual but with 2 bedrooms.

We ended up getting 2 adjoined wheelchair accessible units??? At NO point did they tell us ahead of time this was what to expect. Each unit just had *1 bedroom* and they were extremely far apart from each other, so we weren‚Äôt comfortable with our small children sleeping there! So our 2 sons had to sleep on a pull-out couch like they have in our past stays.

It wasn‚Äôt even possible to lock the front doors to either unit because wheelchair accessibility meant there were giant ‚Äúpush to open‚Äù buttons on the walls inside. We‚Äôve had to call 911 before due to our autistic son eloping (suddenly running off). He‚Äôs FAST, doesn‚Äôt understand danger, can‚Äôt communicate verbally, and looks ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to the naked eye so it could take any amount of time for strangers to realize something‚Äôs wrong.

The units had NO TUBS AT ALL due to being wheelchair accessible. Just accessible showers. Which our son doesn‚Äôt use. I tried to encourage him to try it once and he immediately panicked. I wasn't about to torture him on what was supposed to be a vacation.

We should have had at least 2 full kitchens, right?? WRONG. They each had a fridge/freezer, microwave, no counter space whatsoever, tiny kitchen table with only 3 chairs, a TINY stovetop with 2 burners instead of the expected 4, and NO OVEN. What??? I guess they think people in wheelchairs don‚Äôt need ovens?? So my husband had to spend all week struggling through preparing meals on a stovetop that were supposed to go in an oven.

Both my mother and I called Westgate MULTIPLE times to try to get the situation fixed. I promise we aren't rude customers who yell at retail staff; we have both worked retail before. I even ended up in tears, embarrassed, trying to explain to a manager how the units' setup was horrible for our autistic child. No one gave a shit. One even person just hung up on us.

They offered to move us to a small 1 bedroom unit with 2 queens beds, a jacuzzi tub, full kitchen, in a horrible location at the resort where everyone would be right on top of us. Despite us pointing out that would not be an upgrade like what we paid for, they never offered to refund, give any extra perks for our trouble, or a discount for a future upgrade.

So in the end we had an entire extra unit we didn‚Äôt need, and the unit we DID use was missing things we needed! And I paid $500 extra for that experience!ü§™

Does anyone have advice? I‚Äôm so pissed off as a mother that I can‚Äôt just let it go. I know Westgate is a heartless timeshare corporation that preys on vulnerable people, but please help me go scorched earth.üôèüôè

Oh yeah, one night I turned around and there was literally a bear just inches face to face with me!!! Scariest minute of my life! I shrieked and it too got scared, running away in the opposite direction I ran lol. I know that's not technically Westgate's fault (tho I'm guessing they destroy a lot of forest) but I'm adding it to my list because I'm salty.

On the positive side, children thankfully don‚Äôt think about things like adults do so our boys still had fun doing other things. We found some wonderful local businesses, my favorites being Bloom & Berry Coffee House, The Next Chapter Bookshop, and the Smoky Mountain Spinnery.

I responded that I had reworded the info to be more professional, which did end up shortening a lot of it but that the info was still there. I mentioned that they hadn't trusted me to make the agenda and all I did was reformat. Their response was that they had never told me not to make it and that we should all trust each other that the things in there were important. I let them know that them making the agenda when the group agreed I would do it showed that they didn't trust me, they didn't say it. I repeated again that I'd left it and just reworded it because that was my job within the board. They responded that our roles were not defined (which is not true) and said ""sorry for starting it"". I told them we did have roles defined, we can review it at the next meeting, and that I felt the apology was passive aggressive. Founder friend told me to keep it professional, that they didn't want the drama and weren't trying to be passive. They apologized for stepping on my toes. I told them I had kept it professional and would not like the drama. I reminded them that I came to them because I was worried, brought feedback to fix things, and in exchange they attacked my character and things I cannot control. I said that no accountability had been taken and that I would continue to be cordial and professional, but that our friendship was not in a good place.

The last text I got reminded me of previous abusive relationships in my life. It began with a ""I'm sorry you feel I attacked your character"". Still no accountability. They went on to say they felt like our discussion did not make them feel like I cared about them, that they didn't like me speaking to others behind their back, that they don't understand what they did to make me upset. That they are not up to fighting or dealing with petty drama and that they were hurt I didn't invite them to my party. They ended it with ""I am honestly just baffled and confused by all this"".

I haven't responded and don't know that I want to. I am thinking of quitting the board as well, this drama is ridiculous and too much for me. I feel like I've done all I can to make things right but keep making them worse. I feel that I was very clear in my communication, that I provided feedback and was personally attacked as a response. I don't know what to do or how to fix this or even if I can. I've been questioning if I am the problem.

Left for the day to go to the mechanic and do groceries. My wife was on the couch when I left. Got home 5 hours later, she‚Äôs still there and dishes were still on the drying rack, dry by now. 

Then she went to make dinner (we take turns every day). After dinner the kitchen was a mess and I ended up washing the dishes while she swept, no big deal. 

Later I turned the dishwasher on and went to bed. One thing I noticed is no matter how full the dish washer is, if I‚Äôm not the one to turn it on it doesn‚Äôt get turned on.

Woke up in the morning; dishes in the sink. She‚Äôs chilling on the couch, the same dishes from the night before are on the drying rack still, and the dishwasher is full. I ended up doing it all. This is a recurring thing. I don‚Äôt know how to speak up about it.

1hufl9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelExit/comments/1hufl9d/long_my_frustrating_and_strange_but_interesting/,"[Long!] My frustrating and strange but interesting first dating experiences in 2024: experiencelessness, anxiety, ""friendzone"" - Looking to put my best foot forward 2025","A couple days/week ago I read a post by some guy who detailed his past experiences with women and claimed to be an unwanted incel which sparked a lot of interesting discussion because many commenters argued that women did give him many signals of interest which he just dismissed because of some sort of rejection anxiety. Unfortunately I could relate quite a bit so inspired by that I want to reflect my own experiences last year. Maybe some of you guys can offer advice.

I'm a 25yo guy and have never been romantically involved with a woman on any level ""KHV"" (spoiler: that didn't really change last year). For most of my youth I didn't really care that much, I was occupied with school, uni, work, my male-dominated friend circle and hobbies. A big part of it is also that I'm very introverted, not very outgoing and probably suffer from sort of social anxiety/impairment. Being terminally online, I stumbled upon incel- and adjacent ideologies like the black and the red pill because I just find weird non-mainstream worldviews often quite interesting. My opinion of those was basically ""well a lot of this is probably kinda true but those guy are going way overboard"" (and that's still how I kinda see it today). For me personally, I've never been particularly insecure about my looks (I'm probably somewhat handsome even, this will be relevant later) but what those ideologies really drilled into my brain were the concept of hypergamy and the dichotomy of ""alpha/chad vs beta/nerd"" with only the former category being desired by women and me not being part of it.

So anyway, in the beginning of last year I was befriending a young woman my age (I will from now on refer to her as girl#1) who I met online by coincidence (not on a dating app). I could talk with her about strange intellectual interests of mine which my male friends aren't interested in so it was really nice. We were texting a lot over the span of months and eventually decided to meet up irl. So, over the next couple weeks we met up as often as our busy schedules allowed visiting museums, interesting cultural spots or just hung out. Being honest, I probably had a crush on her from the beginning on but I was deathly afraid of showing it and due to my inexperience I didn't even really know how to do that either.

Looking at this time period in retrospect, she was giving me a lot of what would be considered the classic ""signals of interest"" e.g. initiating text conversations a lot (and finding weird excuses to do so) -suggesting hangouts a lot -cancelling her other plans to meet up with me -smiling, eye contact, laughing at all the stuff I said -teasing me or even saying stuff with sexual innuendo looking for my reaction -isolating me from other people around so that we're alone -being somewhat touchy -complimenting me -looking at me as if expecting something -when it got dark one afternoon she invited me to her apartment for a cup of coffee and even to stay the night (which I declined, don't even ask why)

I didn't really recognize it at the time, I really wasn't (and still am) not sure if she was just being friendly so I didn't do anything and barely reciprocated. I really had no idea how the ""human mating ritual"" including flirting and all that stuff works cause I'm just that inexperienced. The fear of fucking up the ""friendship"" added to that. (I haven't been close friends with a girl since elementary school)

Eventually she became less interested in spending time with me and suddenly starting referring to me as ""friend"" and ""bro"" suspiciously often. Friendzone achieved, I suppose. Unfortunately that was the time when I was starting to reallyy develop feelings for her. We didn't meet up for a couple weeks and when we did again, she starting telling me about her new boyfriend she met recently. Even though I didn't show it in the moment and pretended to not care, I was absolutely devastated and heartbroken. After that hangout we had almost zero contact for the next 3 months (basically the entire summer 2024) because I obviously wasn't interested and she was busy spending time with her new boyfriend >\_>.

In my pain I was starting to wonder what went wrong so I began researching dating advice again. Not those abstract ""pills"" but more hands-on advice, like the aforementioned ""signs of interest"" and how to flirt etc. This was interesting because I considered a lot of these behaviours cringey/simp-y/creepy etc. previously. I never really considering that you flirt by subtly touching the person of interest for instance, it just doesn't feel very natural to me.

I decided that I'd have to actually learn the ""human mating dance"" if I ever want to have a chance of finding a partner and downloaded some of the popular dating apps. Having read about the bad experiences many men had on these apps online I didn't expect much and barely put in any effort but surprisingly I got a lot of matches, even with some very attractive women and some of them even messaged me first. With two of them I met up (girl#2 and girl#3).

Meeting girl#2 I was obviously very nervous, but surprisingly, she was too?! For instance, she was stuttering a lot in the beginning and tripping over her words. It was an absolutely surreal notion to me that an attractive woman like her would be nervous going on a date with me, even girl#1 wasn't quite like that. After the initial awkwardness, we got along and had a nice conversation. In the end we concluded that it was fun, but we weren't quite compatible. Even though it wasn't successful I somehow felt really good. Before we parted ways I told her that this was my first ever ""real date"" and thanked her for making it pleasant and she seemed happy about that. Overall, good experience.

I was much less nervous meeting girl#3 a couple weeks later and it went even better, we got along really well. It also definitely helped that I drank some alcohol when we grabbed dinner which made me less inhibited to speak my mind etc. We met up again a week later. Analyzing her behaviour, I could definitely spot some ""signs of interest"" e.g. - smiling and laughing -looking to extend our meetups -thinking of weird excuses to text me -being playful; although they were not as strong as with girl#1, I believe they were still there. While I did like her, I strangely didn't really think of her as a ""romantic option"" and actually sort of had to friendzone her (which is probably rare as a guy). I felt like I would be leading her on if I suggested more hangouts so I didn't (and she didn't either). Cool girl though, I still occasionally chat with her over text.

Speaking of girl#1, after a long time of no contact she started reaching out again in fall 2024, initiating conversations etc. I know that it's a bad idea to be friends with someone you want to be more than friends with so I tried being a ""bad friend"" to fend her off and just half-heartedly replied to her texts etc. That didn't really work too well cause I just liked her too much. Eventually we started to meet up again too. I found out she broke up with her boyfriend too. My old feelings for her that laid dormant started to reemerge and I had to know if I was still ""the friedzoned bro"" or if she actually considered me. So I had this great idea of just telling her that I was doing some online dating to gauge her reaction and see if she was jealous. Unfortunately, she didn't seem jealous at all, told me that she thinks it's cool that I'm finally trying and that I should have absolutely no trouble dating at all because I'm ""extraordinarily handsome and am such a cool guy"" and just needed to find someone who's compatible with my more reserved nature. Then she proceeded to tell me about some guy she is now interested in (ouch!, even though she said it most likely wouldn't work out with him). Again, I pretended to not care.

When I got home after our meetup I reflected on the interaction; I concluded that I'd probably never have chance with her and my brain sorta had a short-circuit reaction and I blocked/removed this girl on every social platform that we've been friends on in order to protect myself from more pain (I sent her a polite goodbye message though). That was about 2 months ago and our last interaction.

So now it's 2025, something maybe could've happened but it never did and I'm still a ""KHV"" (though not ""hugless"" because girl#1 and #3 hugged me although it was always initiated by them cause I'm not very comfortable with touch).

Idk. Any thoughts? I suppose since online dating somewhat works for me I should just keep going on dates and try my hardest to get over myself and come across as ""flirty"" until I eventually find someone?",1,1736106880.0,IncelExit,0,1.0,False

**Open to Used:** Yes

**Priorities:** performance + build quality. Battery and weight are less important.

**Screen Size:** Larger the better but no specific requirement

**Gaming:** RDR2, Skyrim, Fallout, Baldur's Gate, Stardew Valley. I'm not expecting the same quality/FPS as my PC but of course the best I can get in my budget would be great. 

**Other Specific Requirements:** A solid keyboard for both writing/gaming. Sound quality would be important too.

  
**Finishing Thoughts:**

I currently have a gaming PC and I'm looking to add some more portable options to engage in my favourite hobbies so I'm not stuck at my desk all the time. For reference those hobbies are creative writing, gaming, and watching shows/streaming content. I imagine carrying this around the house to watch content while cooking/cleaning, taking it to coffee shops, bringing it on weekend trips or to friends houses, hooking it up to my TV to play games or stream content etc. etc. So I don't mind if its a bit heavy, and will almost always have somewhere to plug it in. 

The two options I'm considering most are buying a steam deck for gaming and a laptop for writing/streaming (so half the budget would go to each) or buying a gaming laptop for the total budget. Also, I used to do digital art and like handwriting notes so a 2-in-1 with a stylus would be cool, (especially if going the direction of getting a steam deck + laptop) but that would be a bonus rather than a requirement or priority.

I'm also not in a rush, so if there is a good option that is a bit out of budget or if upcoming releases might suit my needs better then I'm willing to wait or save up a bit more to get to that.

We met for coffee and she greeted me with a smile and big hug. She brought me fucking tea with a cute little bag.

She has a slight handicap and walks slow and hates stairs which i guess she was super embarrassed about but whatever idc, so i ended up driving her around everywhere and doing a bit of an impromptu car tour. 

I find myself in disbelief. Is my self esteem that low? Like i dont think im an ugly loser or anything but i feel like she is just a bit out of my league. For our next date im going to make us dinner and fresh bread, she will bake some cookies. After dinner she wants to show me her magic cards and then well see from there :0

We both graduated and were looking for jobs he got a job in this new place and asked me to move to another city with ( We were already living together since 5months).

I thought this will be good as I will be living with him during this tough time of my career struggle and he will a great support.

One day into shifting to the new city and we had a fight because he‚Äôs always on his laptop or phone doing something or the other doesn‚Äôt even make sure he gives me time in a day maybe if it means 10minutes. I just want that he has changed over a period of time , during the start he used to give me a lot of attention and care. Now it just feels he‚Äôs way too distant from me. I think I am too much invested in this relationship as I feel that he is the one. After a lot of failed relationships and cheating, I think I final found a decent guy who treats me well and love.

He just seem to have changed a lot and now I just can‚Äôt keep up with it. Before he told me don‚Äôt ask me time as I am busy M to F (consulting job) so he doesn‚Äôt even tries to spend 10mins with me even after coming back from the job. When I confront him, he says that I was busy I don‚Äôt even have time for myself. And on weekend which was today I asked him to just come and sit with me for 10mins while siping the coffee he was on phone and laptop. That made me more upset and I felt like I came all the way to this new city for him as I don‚Äôt have a job yet could have chosen to stay at some friends place.
Then during the fight he told me that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt want you to come in the first place and now you have again started doing this we are in between temporary accommodation until he finds a permanent one. 

What I am not understanding is that is it wrong of me to ask even 10mins from him in a day where it‚Äôs just us M to F. 

Is it that I don‚Äôt have work so I am quite free as I am in a student life and he in a corporate that I am missing to understand.

I feel like moving out. What should I do feels like I am dragging this relationship? It‚Äôs been just 10months since we are dating and so much has changed I don‚Äôt know should I keep trying or give up.

P.S - It did hurt my self- respect when he said in a fight that yeah go back if you want to I didn‚Äôt want you here in the first place.

She let my family stay with her, took care of me and my sister while my mom worked. After my mom moved us out of state to escape our abusive father I never saw her again. 

I found out this morning she passed away and I have so much guilt and regret. It hurts so much knowing she is gone. All she wanted was for me to be happy in life. I wanted to tell her all the amazing things I've accomplished, the man I've grown up to be, someone she would be proud of. I'll never get that chance now.

My mom has been struggling already and it is weighing on her so hard I'm worried about her.

I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time, but I felt a deep connection with her, and she asked me to exchange phone numbers. What was weird is that she trauma-dumped on me during the night we hooked up, telling me how her mom passed away when she was a kid.

The first few times we hung out, she seemed really into me, but she was flaky and always late. She would constantly lie about small things that I didn‚Äôt even care about. I called her out on it, and she stopped ‚Äì except for the lying part. She told me how she didn‚Äôt want anything serious, how she hadn‚Äôt been in a relationship for six years, and how she only hooks up, etc. So, we agreed on a FWB-type scenario where I emphasized the friendship part. However, after one time, she started distancing herself ‚Äì never initiating contact but always agreeing to hang out.

¬†

We started hanging out regularly‚Äîat least once a week‚Äîfor several hours (sometimes 7-8 hours), but it was usually at a bar. Over time, I felt like we were growing closer, and there was a clear sense of romantic tension. She began opening up more; however, by the end of our meetups, she would always reiterate that she didn‚Äôt want anything serious. At times, she could be blunt or critical, making comments about me being boring, even though she consistently chose to spend so much time with me. She also insisted on tagging along with my friends when I had other plans, which made things awkward.

Fast forward a bit, and our hangouts turned into 2-3 times a week ‚Äì after which she would always distance herself even more. She was doing this dance where she would literally invite me to her place, start getting close to me, like putting her legs over me or sitting extremely close to me, and then pull away panicking like she didn‚Äôt know what to do. She would make comments like, ‚ÄúWe should have a scientific experiment where you blindfold me and we get physical,‚Äù but when I got close, she would pull away. This lasted for some time. I suggested that we should start dating ‚Äì she wouldn‚Äôt say no but rather ¬†invite me to her place. At that time, she started lending me some books.

She got sick, so we hadn‚Äôt seen each other for a few weeks ‚Äì but when we met in person, we continued where we left off. We decided to go out drinking one night with my friends. I offered to pick her up, and she accepted but made a big deal out of it because ‚Äúwe are arriving together.‚Äù She invited us to her place after that, where she was extremely affectionate, sitting in my lap in front of my friends, touching my legs, etc. She suggested we send them home and that I stay over ‚Äì so we called them a cab, but immediately after they left, she started pulling back again, saying she didn‚Äôt feel like having sex. I told her that I didn‚Äôt understand what was going on. We hung out for half an hour more, and I told her I was going to bed. We cuddled and held hands for hours in bed ‚Äì just chatting, and then she hit me with, ‚ÄúThis is wrong, but hand-holding made me horny. Let‚Äôs get physical, but if we do, we aren‚Äôt allowed to see each other ever again.‚Äù I told her no, and she said, ‚ÄúNo kissing then,‚Äù which I also refused ‚Äì and then we had the most passionate kiss ever. I left in the morning, and she lent me another book (I had asked about it a long time ago but didn‚Äôt even remember anymore ‚Äì she just gave it to me). It was a personal book, which was her mom‚Äôs gift to a friend who later gave it to her. However, there was a lot of stuff underlined in the book, so I asked her who had underlined it ‚Äì after which she pulled away again.

¬†

After that, she was extremely distant. She avoided meeting up for three weeks. We finally met up with a friend of mine, and she told me she had been avoiding me because she got into a relationship two weeks ago and it wouldn‚Äôt be fair if she were still hanging out with me (but she had no problem sleeping with a married guy before that, and she would even defend him, saying how considerate he was because he didn‚Äôt want to divorce because of the kids). I told her I would still like to continue hanging out and that I would respect her choices because, honestly, I really do care about her and wouldn‚Äôt want to cut her out of my life. She mentioned multiple times that we wouldn‚Äôt hang out one-on-one ever again. After the bar closed, I told her to come to my place so I could give her stuff back (which she had mentioned multiple times how sentimental it was). I was already in the car, and she called me, telling me to come to another bar. She then proceeded to attack me ‚Äì saying she would never date me, that she was only hanging out with me because she didn‚Äôt have anyone else to hang out with, that she only accepted my invitations to hang out because she didn‚Äôt want to be rude, and tried gaslighting me that stuff that happened never happened. In all of that, she said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt even experienced anything in your life‚Äù ‚Äì which I took to mean I hadn‚Äôt traveled a lot or similar. I sarcastically answered, ‚ÄúNo, you did,‚Äù and then she started crying and told me again how young her mom was when she died. I tried explaining that I didn‚Äôt understand her comment in that context. I asked her if she wanted to talk about what happened as well. I have some stuff that I‚Äôve been through (not as heavy, obviously), so I opened up as well, and at that point, we were both crying. She told me she was sorry she ever met me, that she just lost all respect for me, and then blocked me on socials in front of me. She told me she was going to the bathroom, then messaged me a few minutes later saying she had to leave because she was not in the mood to talk anymore and that we would see each other next time. She didn‚Äôt even send me a happy new year text (she didn‚Äôt block my phone number).

Now ‚Äì I know this is quite a story; however, I really do care about her and would like to stay in her life as a friend. I have no idea why. I have no idea how to proceed with this. At the very least, I would like to return the stuff she lent me, as she mentioned multiple times how important it is to her. I was thinking of sending her a message asking if she wants to pick her stuff up, if I should mail it to her, or if I should bring it next time when we see each other (if ever). This is hard for me because I feel like I lost the last bit of self-respect I had, especially after she told me she was only hanging out with me because she didn‚Äôt have anyone else to hang out with (which seems contradictory ‚Äì multiple times she left coffee with her friends to hang out with me ‚Äì unless she was lying). But I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm hurting someone by not returning their sentimental belongings.

**TL;DR**: I (29M) met a girl (25F) 3.5 months ago and developed a complicated FWB relationship. She often sent mixed signals‚Äîbeing affectionate, spending hours with me, and lending me sentimental items‚Äîonly to pull away, act rude, and remind me she didn‚Äôt want anything serious. Recently, she revealed she started dating someone else, avoided me for weeks, and told me she only hung out with me out of politeness. During an argument, she claimed I hadn‚Äôt ‚Äúbeen through anything in life.‚Äù I misunderstood and responded sarcastically, which made her cry and bring up her mom‚Äôs death. We both got emotional, and she ultimately blocked me on socials but not on my phone.

I still care about her and want to stay friends, though I don‚Äôt know why. At the very least, I want to return the sentimental items she lent me (she‚Äôs mentioned how important they are). I was thinking of messaging her to ask if she wants to pick them up, mail them, or wait until we (potentially) see each other again?",1,1736105496.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1huf1be,https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/comments/1huf1be/stranded_a_combat_medic_story/,Stranded - A Combat Medic Story,"‚ÄúLifeline‚Äù Squad:

SSG. Nathan ‚ÄúSarge‚Äù Carrington - Squad Leader

SPC. Diego ‚ÄúCartel‚Äù Ortiz - Machine Gunner

PFC. C.B. ‚ÄúDoc‚Äù (Me) - Medic

CPL. Matthew ""Big Red"" Delaney - Rifleman

PFC. Marcus ‚ÄúSpecs‚Äù Nguyen - Radio Operator

SPC. Elijah ‚ÄúFrodo‚Äù Brooks - Rifleman


The sun hung low in the sky as we bounced along in the Humvee, rattling and groaning along the ruts in the dirt. Our squad had pulled the shortest straw, and thus had been tasked with a supply run to a remote outpost (a routine mission on paper), then linking up with a supply unit in the area to grab some things like batteries for NVGs, ammo, and vehicle parts and then head back. 

The kind of thing no one expected to go wrong.  

Ortiz manned the gunner‚Äôs hatch, his usual banter carrying over the wind. ""I‚Äôm just saying, if they wanted to thank us properly, they‚Äôd send us back with steaks and beer. None of this mystery meat and powdered eggs bullshit.""  

""You‚Äôve been talking about steaks all fuckin‚Äô week,"" Brooks said in his trademark New York accent, leaning his head back. ""You know what I miss? Pizza. A real greasy slice, just drippin‚Äô, loaded with pepperoni and fresh motza. None of that frozen shit."" 

""Y‚Äôall got no imagination,"" Delaney chimed in from the driver‚Äôs seat, his eyes steadfast fixed on the road ahead. ""What I‚Äôd kill for is a big, home-cooked meal. The whole spread. Roast chicken, mashed potatoes, cornbread‚Äîworks. My mom used to make it every Sunday.""  

""Sounds good,"" Nguyen said, fiddling with his radio. ""But what we really need is some decent coffee. I‚Äôm tired of that powdered crap.""  

""Dream big, Specs,"" Carrington said from the passenger seat, his voice laced with dry humor. ""We‚Äôre gonna be lucky to get another box of stale crackers.""  

I sat between Nguyen and Brooks, half-listening to their banter while staring out the small window at the barren landscape. The heat clung to us like a second skin, the air inside the Humvee thick with the mingling scents of sweat, gun oil, and old leather; the scent of exhausted grunts and a tired medic.

The road stretched endlessly ahead, flanked by jagged rocks and sparse desert brush. Every bump and jolt of the vehicle seemed to  my bones. Despite the chatter, there was a tension that hung over us, the unspoken awareness that nothing here was ever truly routine.  We watched every obstacle and logged it away as a potential IED location. That awareness had saved lives many times.

Then, without warning, the Humvee lurched and shuddered to a stop.  

""What the fuck?"" Delaney muttered, shifting into neutral and trying the ignition again. Nothing happened except a dull clicking sound.  

Ortiz ducked down from the hatch. ""What‚Äôs going on? Did we hit something? Big Red fucked something up, didn't he?""  

""No, the engine‚Äôs shot I think,"" Delaney said irritably, climbing out to take a look. ""Nguyen, get over here and lend me a hand."" 

Nguyen sighed but followed him, flashlight in hand. The rest of us climbed out, the heat of the late afternoon sun immediately hitting us.  

Hours passed, and the sun dipped below the horizon, bathing the desert in an eerie purple twilight, colors cascading from over the rocky dunes. 

Despite their best efforts, Delaney and Nguyen couldn‚Äôt revive the Humvee.  We had all dismounted at this point, some of us sitting against the wheels and trying to stay awake from the boredom and frustration fatigue.

""We‚Äôre dead in the water,"" Carrington finally admitted, slamming the hood shut. ""I‚Äôve called it in, but it‚Äôs going to be hours before they can send another truck.""  We all collectively groaned.

""Great,"" Ortiz said, flopping onto the ground and leaning against the vehicle. ""Stuck in the middle of nowhere. Just what I always wanted.""  

""You could use the quiet, Ortiz,"" Brooks said, smirking as he sat cross-legged nearby. ""Gives you time to reflect on your bad choices.""  

As the night wore on, the conversations deepened.  

""Red, have you ever thought about what you‚Äôre gonna do after this?"" Ortiz asked, staring up at the star-filled sky.  

Delaney leaned back against the Humvee, his expression thoughtful. ""Maybe go back to school. Get a degree in something useful. I‚Äôve been thinking about teaching, actually.""  

""Teaching?"" Ortiz said, raising an eyebrow. ""You? I don‚Äôt see it.""  

I chortled at the remark.

""Why not?"" Delaney shot back. ""I‚Äôve got patience, and I know how to handle tough kids. I figure if I can deal with you, I can deal with anyone.""  

Laughter rippled through the group.  

""Doc,"" Delaney said, turning to me, ""what about you? Have you ever thought about life after all this?""  

I hesitated, staring at my boots. ""I don‚Äôt know,""  I finally admitted after a moment of contemplation. I was lying; the truth was normal life was far beyond my comprehension at this point. All this hell I've seen, I figured if it didn't take me down, I'd surely be a fucked-up individual. 

Nineteen and at war‚Ä¶ just what momma always wanted, right?

""You‚Äôd make a good nurse,"" Brooks said, his tone sincere. ""You‚Äôve got the right mindset for it. Calm under pressure.""  

Ortiz chuckled. ""Yeah, and he‚Äôs got all the practice in the world from patching us up.""  

""Funny,"" I said, rolling my eyes.  ‚ÄúDefinitely not going medical after this bullshit.‚Äù

The night grew colder, the biting chill seeping into our bones. As we settled in, the quiet was broken by a sudden, sharp rustling sound coming from the desert shrubbery nearby.  

""What was that?"" Brooks whispered, his hand instinctively going to his rifle.  

""Probably just the wind,"" Carrington said, though his hand was already on his weapon, too.  

The rustling grew louder, followed by a low, guttural growl. Out of the darkness emerged a pair of glowing eyes‚Äîthen another pair. A pack of wild dogs stepped into the moonlight, their fur matted and their movements cautious but predatory.  

""Shit,"" Ortiz exclaimed, climbing back up into the hatch, his weapon at the ready.  

""Hold fire,"" Carrington said firmly. ""Don‚Äôt spook them unless they get closer.""  

The dogs circled us for what felt like an eternity, their growls low and menacing. Finally, deciding we weren‚Äôt worth the trouble, they slunk back into the shadows.  

""That‚Äôs it,"" Nguyen said, his voice shaky. ""I‚Äôm never complaining about the FOB again.""  

As the hours dragged on, the strange occurrences continued.  

Nguyen suddenly called out. ""Did you guys see that?""  I slowly stood and peered outward. ‚ÄúNah, I didn't see anything.‚Äù Nguyen shook his head. ‚ÄúNo, for real, did no one see that?‚Äù

""See what?"" Delaney asked, instantly alert. He stood and moved to stand beside me, weapon at the ready.  

Nguyen pointed toward the horizon. ""I thought I saw a light. Like a flashlight or something.""  

We all peered into the darkness, but there was nothing there.  

""Probably just your eyes playing tricks on you,"" Brooks said, though his voice was uneasy.  

Part of me now thinks that, yes, maybe we‚Äôd experienced a little delirium from the combination of fear, anticipation, and strangeness of it all, being stranded in the desert.

Not long after, Ortiz swore he heard footsteps crunching in the gravel behind us. He spun around, his weapon at the ready, but there was nothing and absolutely no one there.  

The air felt heavier somehow, the silence constraining us there as we stood alone in the night. Shadows danced and shifted at the edges of our vision, but every time we looked directly at them, they were gone.  

""This place is cursed,"" Ortiz muttered, his usual bravado replaced by genuine concern.  

‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather be lost in the middle of the swamps than here right now,‚Äù I concurred.

""Relax,"" Carrington said, though even he sounded shaken. ""It‚Äôs just our minds playing tricks on us. Lack of sleep, long hours‚Äî""  

A sudden, high-pitched whistle cut through the air, making us all freeze. It lasted only a moment, then was gone, leaving a reverberant echo, a glaring silence in its wake.  

Immediately, we collapsed into formation. 

‚ÄúThis is bullshit, Sarge!‚Äù cried Ortiz, literally shaking in his boots. But it was dead silent out there.

Finally, around two in the morning, headlights appeared in the distance, the sound of an approaching Humvee breaking the spell.  

We scrambled to our feet, relief washing over us as the vehicle pulled up beside ours. Several soldiers from First Platoon climbed out, their faces illuminated by the dim light of their flashlights.  We high-fived and chuckled at the sight of our saviors.

""Y‚Äôall look like y‚Äôall‚Äôve seen a ghost,"" a soldier named Hitchcock joked.  

""Something like that,"" Carrington muttered, clapping him on the shoulder.  

‚ÄúWe got chains and we got fuel, we'll tow you back,‚Äù said the other soldier, named Lowe. We didn't groan but we knew that would take even longer than it did to reach this spot. However, we were thankful at the same time, so we hooked up our vehicle.

We loaded up into the working Humvee, leaving Carrington and Delaney in ours to steer, grateful to be moving again. As we drove back to the FOB, no one spoke, each of us lost in our thoughts, yet connected. Whatever soul tie we‚Äôd experienced out there in the desert, it would stay with us, a reminder that some things couldn‚Äôt be defined‚Äîor forgotten. ",8,1736105493.0,MilitaryStories,1,0.9,False

I am a previous applicant who applied in the 2023-2024 cycle (got one II ‚Äî> WL ‚Äî> R) and applied to 40 schools (MD only). Decided to take a cycle off and reapply this upcoming cycle. Any suggestions are appreciated!

cGPA/sGPA: 3.76/3.65
MCAT: 513 ‚Äî> 507 (rushed retake unfortunately and I think this killed my app) 

ECs: 
Research: 350 hours during undergrad, now working as research associate since 2023 (2000+ hours, 1 abstract submitted). Research job includes a mix of wet lab + clinical research (I have some CRC roles like screening patients, taking vitals, walking through questionnaires)

 Clinical: 300 hours spread over volunteering at  free clinic and health screenings. Most of my hours focused on working in underserved areas, and my PS centered on serving under resourced communities/addressing health disparities. Also had some leadership roles in these volunteering positions 

Non clinical: 50-100 hours volunteering as science tutor in elementary schools in underserved areas. Was told by schools when receiving app feedback that I needed to strengthen this aspect of my app

Hobbies: Music (vocalist/violinist) and coffee making! Also love doing calligraphy lol 

Shadowing: all virtual, but since then have shadowed in person (20 hours and working on getting more)

I‚Äôve been working on gaining more clinical hours through hospice volunteering (have 100ish maybe 150 hours) and nonclinical by volunteering in a DV advocacy org. How am I doing and do I need to get another clinical job? I‚Äôm worried my clinical hours aren‚Äôt enough. I also have been considering a MCAT retake and started studying.

Btw I am CA ORM (rip). Applied to all UCs, mix of private/public schools OOS. Any advice is welcome. Just feeling so overwhelmed and lost!

Hopefully someone can help!

1. ‚ÄúUse tokens for effects‚Äù - In general, I think the flavor effects vs. cup effects section of the rule book is a little wonky. As I understand it, the three ‚Äúflavor effects‚Äù are Concentration (also called ‚Äúbody,‚Äù red tokens), Preservation (also called ‚Äúacidity,‚Äù green tokens), and Dispersion (also called ‚Äúaroma,‚Äù blue tokens). These effects are activated, and must be carried out, any time you play one of the colored tokens into the ‚Äúcup effects‚Äù section of the board. My question, do you have to carry out a flavor effect when you play a colored token into the ‚Äúimmediate effects‚Äù section? For example, the immediate effect at the top of the board is ‚Äútwo additional tokens,‚Äù and it takes one red token to activate. Does that also mean that I have to carry out ‚Äúconcentration‚Äù (the flavor effect tied to the red token) in order to use the ‚Äútwo additional token‚Äù immediate effect?

2. In scoring, there are ‚Äúskill points‚Äù available. These are awarded for having 3 or more bean tokens of the same roast level in your cup. My question, can this apply more than once? For example, can I score 3 skill points by having four beans at roast level 3 (2 points) and three beans at roast level 2 (1 point)? 

Hopefully that all made sense. Appreciate any insight!",1,1736105430.0,boardgames,0,1.0,False

(I'm Bisexual),"I, 27yo gender fluid Bisexual biological male am getting married to a straight 22yo female, let's call her Kate.

We are a week away from the wedding and my soon to be wife (wish me luck) just found out that I invited my Ex-husband (24yo male) to our wedding and bachelors party. She was absolutely livid and enraged, she was making such a scene, saying things like ""How dare you ruin my wedding! and 'You got divorced so why are you inviting him?"". She made me feel so unsafe that I had to leave her apartment that we live in and stay at my ex's house

Kate was also upset that I was inviting someone so ""apparently close to me' when she couldn't even invite her own parents. An important note to the story is that neither of us told are parents about us, as both my parents and my soon to by inlaws are Right-wing Homophobic Bigots

Me and my ex met with our LGBTQ+ friends for dinner and we talked over how to go forward form here. Upon waking up in the morning I noticed that I had a bunch of voicemails and unanswered calls from my LGBTQ+ friends supporting me in this hard time of my life. My Ex brought me breakfast to bed but I refused saying that I need to get away from everything and have some me time. So I went to Starbucks to get some coffee. Upon trying to pay Kate's credit card was declined, I presume because she cancelled it, and was left unable to pay. Since this is San Francisco I just walked out. (Not like hell is real anyways.) I then asked my Ex for some money and went to Kate's apartment. Upon arriving at the building I found all my belongings and Furry Convention merch and memorabilia dumped on the ground outside. I started having a panic attack and had to be taken to the hospital. Joined by my ex we jointly decided that I was going to dump Kate and not get married I then filed a lawsuit for my hospital bills and damages for my belongings.

This was a month ago, Kate has now blocked me on all my social media (ouch) and I have gotten back with m husband. Looking back on this absolutely unacceptable behavior on her part I can't possibly believe how anyone could think this was my fault, so AITA?",3,1736105398.0,AmITheAngel,4,1.0,False

We both seemed to have a great time and they gave me their number at the end of the dinner. 

Once home, another online dating site, JDate sent me an email that there was a new profile that I matched with. It was the same person I just had dinner with. (Doesn't feel great that a new profile was created after our date, but I don't know the circumstances. Maybe they've been editing it for a while and just published it. I figure if my profile is there I have no reason to complain about theirs being there)

My problem is what to do with the ""match"" on the site. JDate is set up so a lot of activity is very public ""These are the list of people who viewed your profile."" ""These are the people who liked your profile"" ""These are the search criteria this person has set"", etc. (The last one was a real hassle on a previous date: I listed ""looking for"" as both men and women and spent half of a coffee date discussing the difference between bisexuality and monogamy. I couldn't imagine spending that much time on a date discussing who else I would or wouldn't date)

If I look at their profile, they'll see that I'm viewing profiles on JDate. That might not look great for me. (Similar to me above where they'd be thinking ""we had a great date and next day he's scrolling through dating sites?"") If I like it, it might look creepy/stalkerish like I'm chasing them across multiple dating sites. And if in their software they are judging profile quality based on likes/rejects I'm skewing their stats.  If I don't like or reject her profile in the match queue then I'm pretty much off JDate for a while because it won't show the next profile in the queue.

My question is, can you be unconsciously aware/stressed/whatever and that can impact sleep. Like you brain is aware of what is coming up and alters how it operates? It would be really nice to have just slept through and woken up at 6am like when in on holidays.

I've wanted to do this trip for a long time and only wished for more time. It was fantastic! 

Spent one week in Mexico City (there for Day of the Dead festivities), three days in Puebla and five days in Oaxaca. 


Getting There/Around
Flew into CDMX and out of Oaxaca. Both airports were fine. Had no issue with anything. The Oaxaca airport markup was insane so do not buy anything there. 

Did the bus between cities. The buses were very nice (took ADO) and pretty on time. I never get carsick but the drive between CDMX and Puebla was very windy and had me a little dizzy. The drive between Puebla and Oaxaca was long but very scenic. Brought drinks and snacks but there was also a stop each time halfway through qhere you could get something. On baord bathroom and it was pretty nice. Only downside was they played dubbed movies loudly. 

Around the cities, I mostly walked or took ubers. In CDMX I biked a lot (ecobici was fabulous) and took some public transit. The biking infrastructure in CDMX was pretty decent but intermittent and you cannot trust the lights in intersections. Traffic was truly as awful as they said in CDMX. 


Safety
Got SO many warnings about mexico city beforehand, it was ridiculous. Even from Latino family! It was fine. Like any other big city in the touristy areas (thought it was better than some big European cities). I didn't go wandering into random neighbourhoods, though, and kept my stuff safe. Even in day of the dead I felt fine in the crowds. 

The riskiest thing was the traffic in my opinion. Puebla and Oaxaca were fine, again, at least in the touristy areas I was in. 


Language
My partner is a native Spanish speaker and I can get by. There was less English than the resort destinations but I think language wouldn't be much of an issue especially if you're in touristy areas. The bus was probably the most challenging if you had no spanish. 


Day of the Dead
The art was my favourite part. The offrenda and many, many art pieces all over the three cities was very cool. Every building had an ofrenda (deocratwd altar) and there were day of the dead flags and arts literally everywhere. The parade in CDMX was decent but it was a lot of standing. We didn't visit the cemeteries as I felt that was a bit invasive personally. It was fun but wouldn't go out of my way for it. The art and ofrendas are also around for a while before and after the day of the dead - the exact date changes as does the calendar of events. It doesn't get released until pretty close to the date which frustrated me as a far-ahead planner. You really have to go with the flow!


Food
It's the best food destinations in mexico which has one of the best cuisines. It was incredible. We ate street food and nice restaurants and everything in between. We are foodies but not Michelin snobs. Had the best meals of my life on this trip. We also LOVE mezcal so took the opportunity to sample this as well. We did a food tour in CDMX which was pretty decent - tried a few things we probably wouldn't have otherwise and learnt about some of the food production and culture in mexico. Also toured an I dependent agave and mezcal farm which was cool to see (farm was also gorgeous but honestly I didn't think the mezcal they produced was as good as others I've tried). 


Mexico City
Stayed for a week along the reforma, north of Roma norte and east of the angel de independcia. Hotel was fine, not rave worthy but clean and location was decent. First day was just arriving and getting settled mostly, including indulging in Takis Fuego (spicy chips). 

First thing was heading to the national anthropology museum. It was a highlight. We went at opening and spent over four hours before tapping out. Incredible museum! As a history nerd I loved it. Grabbed lunch and explored the Chapultepec park which was lovely. 

The next day headed to the ""old town"" or historic centre by bike. Eco bici was a great way to get around although I'd say you should be confident on a bike and used to riding in traffic. The Reforma closes on Sundays so that's an excellent time to bike if you're not okay with traffic.

The historic centre is really quite nice during the day. There was lots of day of the dead art in the main plaza and we checked out the church, templo mayor, and the Palacio de Bella Artes. The church was free and quite lovely. 

Templo mayor was at first disappointing but once you cross the ruins and go into the real museum it gets a lot better. I recommend it. The ruins aren't that interesting but the museum proper was well done and had some really cool stuff. It's also in both English and Spanish. 

The Palacio de Bella Artes is a beautiful building. You can go in and there's a gift shop and restaurant. Plus a museum (didn't go in) and of course you can see performances. There's a cafe in the Sears building across that has good pastries and coffee with excellent views. 

We also visited the banco mexico museo but that was entirely in spanish. Interesting museum if you can read spanish! 

There's the ""tile house"" which was pretty. Lots of little stores and pop up markets and street vendors in the area. 

El baijo is an excellent chain restaurant in CDMX. We went a few times and tried quite a few dishes and they were all excellent. Also visited a few nicer restaurants in Condesa but el baijo was the best bang for buck in my opinion. Happy to share other restaurant recommendations though! 

Did a food tour as previously mentioned which was good. So much food though! 

Attended day of the dead festivities and also just spend a lot of time wandering the streets. Walked/biked the Reforma, Centro hist√≥rico, condesa, Roma, chalputepec park and Coyoac√°n. Visited quite a few markets. 

Did a day trip to Teotihuacan where we did the sunrise hot air balloon and visited the archaeological site. It was incredible!! The site is huge and it's a long day but totally worth it. 

Easily could have spent another week in CDMX. But there's only so much time!

You could feel the elevation and the pollution at times but that and the traffic were the only downsides. 


Puebla 
A lovely city! The historic centre felt very European and there are a ton of gorgeous churches. The Museo Amparo was amazing and had great views and a very nice cafe on the roof. Also nice were the barrio de artiste and nearby el Parian market (art and architecture). Tons of amazing little shops. 

The only disappoint was Cholula. We booked a tour that was completely unnecessary and the archaeological site itself was underwhelming. It's worth visiting but easy to get to via Uber and not worth the expense of a tour. The church at the top was interesting and great views. It's a steep climb up! 

Three days was enough time in Puebla but if you wanted to day trip you could add a day or two. 

The food was phenomenal in Puebla. I thought it was better than CDMX and more affordable. 


Oaxaca
This city had long been on our list. We finally made it and it was just as awesome as we thought it would be. The historic centre was an amazing place to wander. Tons of cool shops, nice art, and amazing places to eat. Although day of the dead was over there were still tons of decorations are art left up for it which was cool to see. 

Visited the Oaxaca museum of cultures which was beautiful and a decent museum. It's housed in what used to be a convent so that's really cool. The gardens are lovely as well. 

Actually only had one full day in the city itself as we booked a number of tours outside of the city. We visited hierve el agua and did a hike. I was actually pretty skeptical but it was totally worth it and ended up being a highlight of our visit. The waterfalls and pools were stunning and the hike was awesome - incredible natural beauty and the guide was great. 

We also visited an agave farm and sampled a lot of mezcal which was fantastic. 

We went mountain biking which was an adventure. Not sure I would recommend unless you're experienced and into that (we are although I'm less intense of a rider). Our guide again was awesome. 

Also visited a weaving collective which was cool. The smaller towns and countryside were very lovely. 


I wish I would've had two or three more days in Oaxaca. I would've liked to have visited some of the archaeological sites in the area. 

Highly recommend all three places to visit!

I am going through a lot of healing my inner child work and setting boundaries with my family which most likely is sucking up my energy. I decided to go NC with my father and have been processing the childhood trauma with my therapist. My mother is in the middle but still tries to ""fix"" the family. tells me to forgive...but what happened was unforgivable especially if accountability and admittance of fault is not taken ownership till this day. I'm also in a toxic work environment where my boss is narcissistic. Everything I do is wrong or not enough. It's constant gaslighting.

This environment deepens the wounds of the trauma I already hold.

I'm trying to get out but lacking the energy to do so.

A few months back I started drinking mushroom coffee which worked for some time but now I feel it's not working as well.

My body is physically tired all the time and my mind is just drained. I don't have much energy.

Have antidepressants helped? Would you recommend?

Do you have any regrets if you did decide to take anti-depressants?",3,1736105068.0,CPTSD,2,1.0,False
1huev0f,https://i.redd.it/qlj72van78be1.jpeg,Night over GILF‚Äôs House ,"This happened during the summer, but I was at a bar with my friend and we were there celebrating his aunts birthday. (63) She has been single for a second because her husband died a year before. I was having fun, I danced with a couple of girls on the dance floor but it didn‚Äôt go anywhere besides some fun dances and drinks shared. I could tell that my friends aunt was coming on to me a bit but didn‚Äôt think anything of it when she invited us to her house for more drinks and honestly I wasn‚Äôt going home cause I drank too much. Once at her place we had a few drinks and very quickly me and her started getting going. She had a big fat ass and huge fucking tits and was grinding all over me getting me rock hard. I was basically fucking her through her skirt at point and was feeling her up. But we were being sneaky and were trying to only do this while my friend was away. After a while he passed out on the couch and that‚Äôs when we both got naked and started making out like crazy. Now I wish I could‚Äôve said I fucked her cause I wanted too but she was insisting not to fuck me without a condom which I didn‚Äôt have and she didn‚Äôt either. So she blew me a bit and I ate her out a little bit but then she said she was tired and went to her bed. I got upset that she wouldn‚Äôt at least let me sleep in her same bed with her but I went to guest room like she wanted me too and slept. Later on I woke up hard as hell and went to the living room and jerked off to a photo I found of her when she was younger. Idk how old she was but she was in a gee (cause she used to be a karate instructor) and I thought she looked sexy. I flipped through her picture book and just kept on jerking to her when she was younger. Now I was getting close and still was wishing I could fuck her so I decided to open her fridge and found a small bottle of oat-milk she probably uses for coffee. I grabbed it and got myself going again to her and then came like crazy inside the oatmilk bottle. The next day me and my friend left early without saying anything and I didn‚Äôt hear from her until one day she sent me a sexy pic from her. If I got the chance next time I‚Äôd bring a condom but I‚Äôm not going to go running to her. Lol maybe this year on her birthday will be her time but I basically ghosted her until next time.

So bear with me. I have been in a relationship for one year and a half and this story starts around 2 months ago and I was madly in love with this guy. So much in love with him that I never noticed the red flags. It all started with my favourite lipstick going missing and I was heartbroken over it because my dad bought it for me from a business trip in Dubai. I would say my family is pretty upper class so we have a few maids who stay over. My parents are divorced and my dad‚Äôs almost always away for business trips so my boyfriend has been coming over a lot and stays the whole day. I complained to him and he suggested the idea of ""maybe the maids stole it"". Since my dad is always away, the maids stay over to watch after the house. I could not keep my cool after I heard they might have stolen it and I just lashed out on them. After a little bit my boyfriend came and calmed me down. Not so late after, a very expensive Chanel bag I got as a birthday gift a while back went missing. I was upset and thought my maid stole it again so I fired all the maids and they were replaced the very next day. Some time passed and I completely forgot about the bag and stolen things. We had a friend's meetup and there I saw a distant mutual friend of both my boyfriend and I. She was a very quiet type of girl but really pretty. To my absolute astonishment I saw her with the exact same bag that had gone missing. I was flabbergasted. then proceeded to not think much of it. That evening the quiet friend proceeded to stick with me and my boyfriend all evening not saying much but keeping our company. I also did not think much of it at that time. We had a fun night and a great after party. A week after the party I hung out with a few of my close friends in a local coffee shop. They're close to the mutual friend who was quiet. During our gossip she came up as a topic of conversation and I shared my thoughts and experience about how she had the same bag. And then they revealed something that started to haunt me. Apparently the mutual friend got a new boyfriend 4 months ago (Around the same time my things started going missing) and He has been giving a lot of expensive gifts to her. She used to flex those in her Instagram private story but never revealed the identity of her boyfriend. So I begged my friends to show me the stories. They were saved in highlights with the name ""<3"" but that section was hidden if I viewed it from my account because all of them were private stories and I was not added to her close friends list. Few of those things shown in her highlights were similar to those stolen from me. I almost passed out from the shock. Then I got to thinking ""How could she have gotten these from me if she has not visited my house at any point during the disappearances?"" That planted a seed of doubt in the back of my mind about my boyfriend. I was so deeply in love with him I could never even imagine it as a possibility. All I could think about was if he was cheating on me or not. One day when my boyfriend came over and went in to shower I decided to check his phone. To my surprise it was locked and I could not open it (I thought it would be my or his birthdate). I then texted one of my friends to ask the mutual friend's birthday and after they told me and I input the date it actually opened. My hands started shaking and my mind went blank. I could not stand any longer and almost collapsed into the bed. I went to his instagram and I could not find anything. I went to his iMessages app and saw a contact labelled as ""X"". I opened it and I found flirty texts with someone. I decided to check out all the texts and after scrolling up the chat for a bit, I found pictures of the person I thought was a friend of mine. I immediately realised everything that has been going on. My boyfriend was cheating on me with her. This was not even the worst part. The worst part was I knew he was struggling financially but I never thought he would be stealing from me and gift my belongings to his side chick. Now that I think about it, it seems like I was the side chick all along. I am planning to confront my boyfriend about this very soon but I have no idea on how I should do it. I don't know what to say or how to confront him about this. I would really appreciate it if you guys could help me figure out what to do next. I love him so much and I still can't believe all of this is happening. A small part of me really doesn't want to break up with him and thinks I can fix him.",12,1736104820.0,offmychest,11,0.83,False

1. Photos are all taken on my phone sadly and they are selfies, it isn't the fact that I don't want to take good photos but I can't find a photogenic friend who knows how to take a good one :(

1. They are not heavily edited or color-corrected. The gym pic has a blur filter, that's all. If I'm not mistaken, the profile pic has a weird crop to cut out something.

1. Honestly, I don't know if I should include the gym pic. It's something I'm proud of. I like working out, as I told you in my profile. I don't have any other cool shirtless pic for instance, and the other shirtless pics are just too much.

1. The Excel jokes are mainly because I use Excel extensively and find it a bit of fun.

1. The orange prompt is also something I thought of and found it fun, I have these weird humor thoughts sometimes, not always usually once or twice every full moon.

1. I put fun casual dates and long-term together just to be clear that I'm up for a coffee and even if we don't hit off it's good, and long-term is what I'm looking for.

Now you guys tell me, do I stand a chance? Should I try premium? What should I improve? Which platform should I use etc....

Thank you all in advance...

Two weeks ago, I made an attempt to a color wheel but I realized quite quickly it was quite bad. I posted it with another account in here 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Armypainter/s/sgAuo9D0SO


As a fellow miniature painter, I‚Äôve often found myself spending way too much time figuring out the best color schemes and wondering which colors would work well together. That‚Äôs what inspired me to create this color wheel specifically tailored to The Army Painter‚Äôs Fanatic range.

Here‚Äôs how it works:
	‚Ä¢	The wheel is structured around the flexible triad system of the Fanatic range, making it easy to mix and match colors for your miniatures.
	‚Ä¢	Outer colors are the most vivid, while shades closer to the center have added black, white, or gray to create depth.
	‚Ä¢	Intermediate colors (like turquoise and teal) are blends of neighboring hues.

I designed this to help miniature painters like me save time and find harmonious matches with ease. I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on it!

It is not without flaws, and I realize there are improvements to be made (different font sizes to make it into the hexagons for example)

If you‚Äôre interested, feel free to download it and give it a try. Your support (a follow, feedback, or even buying me a coffee!) would mean a lot‚Äîit helps me work on improved versions, explore other ranges and brands, and support the creative projects I share on my personal page (miniature painting & worldbuilding).

1huef29,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialFiction/comments/1huef29/xanadont/,Xanadon‚Äôt,"Foster checked his rearview mirror. Nothing. Just the same road swallowed by pines he‚Äôd been driving for miles. Ahead, a sign jutted from the edge of the forest like a splinter: ‚ÄúWelcome to Xanado ‚Äì A Perfect Place to Stay.‚Äù

The lettering was clean, white paint gleaming despite the weathered wood. Foster frowned. He didn‚Äôt remember seeing this town on the map.

He drove on, the road narrowing. A curve brought him into a town square that seemed plucked from a postcard. Candy-colored storefronts, a fountain at the center, and not a single car or person in sight. The perfect place to stay? Maybe if you wanted to vanish.

His gas tank nudged empty. Foster swore under his breath. He pulled into the nearest gas station, its pumps older than his uncle‚Äôs record collection. A single bulb hung over the station door, buzzing faintly.

The bell jingled when he stepped inside. The attendant, a man with skin the color of unpolished ivory, glanced up from a newspaper. His smile was abrupt and unnatural.

‚ÄúEvening,‚Äù the man said. His voice was soft, clipped. ‚ÄúNeed a fill-up?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Foster replied, unnerved by how the man stared without blinking. ‚ÄúDo you take cards?‚Äù

The man chuckled, dry and humorless. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt deal in plastic here. Cash or something more tangible.‚Äù

‚ÄúTangible?‚Äù Foster asked, unsure he wanted the answer.

The attendant tilted his head. ‚ÄúA favor, maybe. Or time.‚Äù

Foster forced a laugh. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôll just find an ATM.‚Äù

The man‚Äôs eyes didn‚Äôt leave him. ‚ÄúGood luck with that.‚Äù

---

The diner smelled of bacon grease and bleach. A woman with flyaway hair poured Foster a cup of coffee before he could ask. The menu was short, the letters faded like they‚Äôd been scrubbed too hard.

‚ÄúSomething to eat?‚Äù she asked, her voice flat.

‚ÄúJust the coffee,‚Äù Foster said, staring at the other patrons. All three of them sat rigid, their movements unnaturally slow. A man cut his steak into impossibly precise cubes. A woman stirred her soup endlessly, her spoon never touching the bowl.

Foster turned back to the waitress. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up with this town? It‚Äôs...quiet.‚Äù

She stiffened, her face twitching with something like fear. ‚ÄúNot much traffic these days.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I noticed,‚Äù Foster said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a sign out front saying it‚Äôs the perfect place to stay. Doesn‚Äôt seem like anyone‚Äôs staying, though.‚Äù

Her hands trembled as she wiped her apron. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have stopped here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

Before she could answer, the bell above the door jingled. A man walked in‚Äîa mirror of the gas station attendant. Same pale skin, same sharp smile. He nodded at the waitress. She nodded back, resigned, before disappearing into the kitchen.

The man sat across from Foster without asking. ‚ÄúEnjoying Xanado?‚Äù

Foster‚Äôs unease spiked. ‚ÄúI was just leaving.‚Äù

‚ÄúWere you?‚Äù The man tilted his head, just like the attendant had. ‚ÄúFunny thing about leaving. Roads don‚Äôt seem to agree.‚Äù

Foster leaned back, feigning calm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take my chances.‚Äù

The man‚Äôs smile widened. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve already taken them.‚Äù

---

The first loop happened an hour later. Foster‚Äôs car chugged along the uneven road leading out of Xanado. His headlights cut through the dense forest, and he relaxed when he saw the treeline thinning ahead. 

Then he passed the sign again: **‚ÄúWelcome to Xanado ‚Äì A Perfect Place to Stay.‚Äù**

He stopped, his pulse thudding. Had he taken a wrong turn? Impossible‚Äîthe road had only gone one direction. He turned around, driving faster this time, his knuckles white on the steering wheel.

Twenty minutes later, the sign reappeared. Foster slammed on the brakes, grinding to a halt. 

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he muttered. He got out, kicking gravel as he approached the sign. The wood felt warm under his hand. Wrong. 

His phone had no signal. The GPS spun, unable to find a satellite. Foster punched the coordinates into his head instead, turning the car back toward the diner. He didn‚Äôt notice the sign‚Äôs text changing behind him: **‚ÄúWelcome Home, Foster.‚Äù**

---

Back in town, the streets were no longer empty. People lined the sidewalks, their movements fluid but unsettling, like they were rehearsing life instead of living it. 

A girl skipped rope in front of the library. Foster stopped, confused. She was singing, her voice high and clear:

‚ÄúFirst you run, but the road runs too,  
Stay too long, and it stays with you.‚Äù

Foster froze. ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù

The girl smiled, her teeth too white. ‚ÄúDo you want to play?‚Äù

---

The Xanadome Hotel loomed at the edge of town, its neon sign blinking erratically. Foster didn‚Äôt remember seeing it before. Inside, the air smelled faintly of damp wood and something metallic. 

The receptionist, another replica of the gas station attendant, handed him a key without asking. ‚ÄúRoom 13, Mr. Foster.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt bother asking how they knew his name. Every question here seemed to invite worse answers. 

---

Room 13 was normal, at first glance. Beige walls. A bed neatly made. A single picture frame hung above the desk. Foster approached it, curious. 

It was a photo of the diner. In it, the patrons weren‚Äôt eating‚Äîthey were standing at the windows, faces pressed against the glass, staring into the street.

Staring at him. 

Foster turned, and the air shifted. His breath clouded, though the room wasn‚Äôt cold. He reached for the doorknob, but the metal bent under his grip, soft as wax.

A sound broke the silence‚Äîa rhythmic creaking. He turned slowly, eyes scanning the room until they landed on the chair in the corner.

It was rocking. Empty.

‚ÄúFoster,‚Äù a voice said from behind him. Calm, patient.

He didn‚Äôt turn. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving.‚Äù

The voice laughed, rich and full. ‚ÄúThere is no leaving. You brought yourself here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want this!‚Äù Foster snapped.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you?‚Äù the voice asked, closer now. ‚ÄúYour kind always asks for things they can‚Äôt take back. What were you running from, Foster? Or to?‚Äù

He spun around, and the room was gone. In its place, the diner. The patrons, their faces blank, stood in the street, forming a circle around him. The gas station attendant, the waitress, the child‚Äîthey were all the same. 

They stepped closer, their movements synchronized, their eyes devoid of any spark of life. 

The girl from the library approached last, skipping rope. The girl stopped skipping, her rope hanging limp in her hands. Her smile grew, but it wasn‚Äôt a child‚Äôs smile anymore‚Äîit was ancient, cruel, as though something older than time wore her face like a mask. She stepped closer, tilting her head in that too-familiar way, and dropped the rope at his feet. It moved, curling like a snake, slithering around his shoes before burrowing into the ground.

‚ÄúWelcome to Xanado,‚Äù she said, her voice layered, not just one child but a chorus of tones, each overlapping and discordant. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre staying.‚Äù

Foster staggered backward, his breath hitching as the ground beneath him rippled like water. The pavement cracked, and the cracks spread, veins of shimmering light pouring out from the fissures. The air thickened, pressing down on him until it felt like breathing through tar. The townspeople moved closer, their forms flickering and glitching, as though reality couldn‚Äôt decide what they were.

‚ÄúNo, no, no‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt real!‚Äù Foster shouted, his voice ragged. But the words felt small, meaningless, swallowed by the growing hum in the air‚Äîa sound like wires tightening, straining, on the verge of snapping.

The girl reached out and touched his chest, her tiny hand cold and impossibly heavy. Foster tried to pull away, but her fingers rooted into his shirt like hooks. The air behind her split, a jagged tear that revealed something incomprehensible. It wasn‚Äôt darkness; it wasn‚Äôt light. It was the absence of both, a void that twisted the edges of his vision and tugged at the edges of his thoughts.

Foster felt himself unraveling‚Äînot his body, but something deeper. His memories flashed in reverse: birthdays, arguments, lovers, and triumphs crumbling like sandcastles under a relentless tide. He saw himself as a child, standing at a fork in a forest trail, choosing the left path instead of the right. He saw his teenage self hesitating before answering a phone call he should have ignored. A thousand moments folded back on themselves, collapsing inward until they were reduced to a single, blinding point.

‚ÄúEverything you were,‚Äù the girl said, her voice sharp as glass, ‚Äúbelongs to us now.‚Äù

Foster‚Äôs legs gave out, and he fell, but he didn‚Äôt hit the ground. The world around him bent, folding into geometric impossibilities. The pastel buildings stretched, twisted, and merged into each other, forming a kaleidoscopic tunnel that swallowed him whole. He spun through it, weightless, his thoughts splintering into fragments.

And then he stopped.

Foster opened his eyes to find himself standing in the diner. The patrons were gone. The waitress was gone. Everything was gone, except for a single reflection staring back at him in the coffee pot‚Äôs polished surface.

It wasn‚Äôt his face. It was the gas station attendant‚Äôs.

The doorbell jingled. Foster turned as the door opened, and a man stepped inside. He looked tired, his face pale and drawn, eyes darting nervously around the room.

‚ÄúJust passing through,‚Äù the man said.

Foster smiled, his lips curving in a way he no longer controlled. His voice, calm and polished, filled the space between them.

I feel so shaken by what almost happened I just need to get this off my chest. My sister and my two daughters (a baby and toddler) were meeting my parents for brunch at a nice restaurant. My sister was carrying the baby and was about to cross the road which was a round circle drive at the front of the restaurant when a car came zipping around the corner and had to brake HARD to not hit them. It‚Äôs at a point where you shouldn‚Äôt be going faster than 5-10mph since it‚Äôs basically a driveway. He was probably going around 20-25mph. I saw red. I feel so ashamed now thinking about it but it felt so primal since his recklessness threatened to kill my baby daughter.  I yelled at him to slow down and that they nearly hit us. This isn‚Äôt like me at all which is why I feel a bit ashamed but since they came into the restaurant right behind us I told the man who was probably in his 60s (and had his wife and two older kids with them) that he is old enough to know better than to be driving so recklessly where people are walking to go into the restaurant. He completely ignored me at first and was about to walk past me then said that he had ‚Äúapologized 5 times already‚Äù which he definitely had not since we hadn‚Äôt spoken before this. His son then said sarcastically to me ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know 20 mph could be so fast!‚Äù I don‚Äôt know what I wanted. Maybe I just wanted a sincere acknowledgment or apology of nearly killing my baby. We tried to sit down, had coffee but I just could not stay there anymore.

I(20f) recently broke up with my high school boyfriend after about 4 years. This is one of my first dates as dating someone new, and I‚Äôve already run into a situation I don‚Äôt know how to feel about.

I went on a date with this new guy. We met in the mall and went for a coffee, which went smooth and I had a nice time, then we wandered around the mall for a while. While walking through random stores and talking, I saw a bag I liked that cost about $50. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I should buy it because I‚Äôm in college and money is pretty tight for me - i could afford it, but yk $50 is not ‚Äûnothing‚Äù 

When I hesitated, he reassured me, saying things like, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about the money,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù Based on what he said, I low-key expected he‚Äôd pay for it, especially since I wasn‚Äôt planning to buy it at first.

But when we got to the register, he didn‚Äôt say or do anything. Instead, he walked away and waited for me outside the register area while I paid for it myself. I felt a little confused and, honestly, mad(?) I thought his earlier comments meant he was offering to pay. So I paid and didn‚Äôt want to seem greedy or make the situation awkward so I didn‚Äôt really say anything - i know y‚Äôall will probably say ‚Äûoh you should‚Äôve stopped him‚Äù or ‚Äûyou should‚Äôve confronted him‚Äù but I was just thrown off and as i said i was not about to argue with him to make it all awkward.

I know it‚Äôs a common discussion on reddit about whether women should expect guys to pay for things, so I‚Äôm kind of nervous about posting this. To be clear, I don‚Äôt expect guys to pay for everything, and maybe I misread the situation. But at the same time, his words really made it seem like he was going to.

I was heartbroken a few months ago and after almost 2 months started going on the apps with not too much hope. I tried Bumble; no luck.

Then I went on Hinge. Took a while to find matches. But then I matched with two people at one point, one dude responded and we actually had a conversation. He‚Äôs from South America, though, and doesn‚Äôt speak much English. But I ended up going on the date and it was awesome and he was very sweet and we even slept together the first night. He was super into me, calling me beautiful, and said I give him butterflies.

The next morning I left and we were texting via WhatsApp periodically throughout the day. He was calling me pet names like baby, and we were just asking about each others lives. We never said anything like ‚Äúi love you‚Äù since we literally just met obviously, but I noticed he‚Äôs extra affectionate and I think Latin men tend to be more romantic etc. in their cultures.

That next day while we were talking he mentioned meeting up again the following Friday to which I agreed and we talked throughout the week (this was during Christmas week) and we had the 2nd date on that Friday where I drove over to him and we just stayed in and ate and watched a movie. The next morning he took me out to breakfast, drove us there, and paid, and it was just very sweet. We used Google translate a lot but he is studying English and can make basic conversation. We were talking about our part experiences with relationships, and he has said he hadn‚Äôt been in a relationship for 2 years since he left his country. Later at his place he asked when the last time I slept with someone is, and I was honest and said 2 months ago and that it was toxic and he said he was glad I was out of it. Then I left for the day, he helped me carry my bags and asked me to text him when I got home. I did and then we didn‚Äôt talk much the rest of the night, but he sent me a reel on Instagram the next day so we talked briefly on Instagram but he hadn‚Äôt been messaging me on WhatsApp.

We had plans to get together for New Years Eve that week, and also to go to a cafe (yesterday) but he didn‚Äôt really follow up about it so as we were talking via Instagram I mentioned that I made the reservation for the cafe and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúok baby sounds like a plan‚Äù (earlier this week)

The next day (new years Eve) I asked if we are still doing something, and he mentioned he wants to but he‚Äôs spending time with his family. He is very family oriented and I‚Äôve met his sister and cousin because they live with him. I just said okay, because I don‚Äôt want to come off as needy and just basically said it‚Äôs fine. I left him on read as he only sent a few words. I think there was a language barrier so the NYE plans were a little confusing for him.

An hour later he messages me again saying ‚Äúsend me your location at 8-9‚Äù as if he was interested in seeing me. So I go to my friends for the night,  and I am messaging him and he‚Äôs being affectionate again and was like ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you come here? I can‚Äôt leave my family‚Äù and I was like sure, so wayyyy later in the night (in the morning lol)he buys me an Uber and I go to his place and it‚Äôs great, we dance, he kisses me, I meet his cousins, and we enjoy the night and I sleepover. I did have to go somewhere the next morning (new years day) at 11 am but he asked me to come back and I agreed. Later on I buy him food and coffee and go back to his place and we play video games together, play guitar, he tells me we can work on songs together and says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre mine‚Äù, took a picture of me, etc.
It was great, and then he told me he had plans to play video games with his cousin so he game a bit and I lay in bed and then I spend the night again, and leave the next morning for work.

I text him I‚Äôm home safely and he thanks me for letting him know (we both had work - this was Friday) and he still sent cute emojis.

We talked about our day, and he was concerned about me since I have dry skin and was like make sure you moisturize in the winter it‚Äôs cold, and asked about my day. Then later that day he asks if we could reschedule our date for (yesterday) because he has a lot of things to take care of that he forgot about during the holidays. I say yes of course and he heart reacts my message.

Over the course of a couple weeks, he did mention he‚Äôs looking to find the one and wants to get married and have kids eventually. 

Yesterday I noticed he wasn‚Äôt active on WhatsApp often or social media; when I sent him a post yesterday on Instagram he responded  and asked how I‚Äôm doing and we talked briefly and he then told me how he got a lot done yesterday, went to the DMV and then the conversation fizzled out because wasn‚Äôt much to say I guess.

I just have a bad feeling maybe he‚Äôs uninterested because he doesn‚Äôt message me on WhatsApp like use used to, and today we haven‚Äôt talked. Idk. Thoughts?",0,1736103398.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

""Fully serviced Nuova Simonelli Appi 1 group espresso machine. New rotary pump, new front panel/buttons, new seals and o-rings everywhere, etc. Steam valve and hot water tap completely checked, cleaned with an ultrasonic cleaner and put new expensive grease in them. Boiler and heating element completely descaled.
New handle."" 

The price is 950e. My primary usage would be at home to practice latte art etc and try different coffee beans. (I want to level up my barista skills). As in summer I have my own mobile coffee shop with Fracino dual fuel retro on it. But im not able to use that machine in winter(its too big for my house and its in storaget with bike in different city) And maybe sometimes i could attend parties etc as popups with this one. Is it any good in small comercial use? Is the price worth it? Is it too much for house usage. And to be clear I already have grinder etc. 

Ps. Im 99 percent sure the seller is in this group so cheers Mr. K!

Honestly I think it really works.  Kaneda cracks me up- but then, I wrote it.   
So, I hereby submit this to you savages.  Upvote/comment if you want more installments. 

The idea of this project is: to tell the full manga story.  All of it.  Expanded, not contracted.

Also, I'm more likely to do more if someone can advise me how to get it sold. (I guess I could start email carpet bombing hollywood agents, but this is the most famous dead project in hollywood!!! no one would open the attacment...)

Akira: S1 Ep1: Contagion

  
Intro: (same text and background as original film- except, without the iconic frame of ‚Äòakira‚Äô which will come later)

¬†

Shot of neo-tokyo from the sky evolves to present, then zooms into a spot in the city where Kaneda stands in front of a row of his bikers.

¬†

Exterior, neo-Tokyo, night.¬†¬†Kaneda, a 15 year old Japanese male, stands in front of Yamataga, Tetsuo, Dai, and Kaisuke, all also 15 year old Japanese males.

¬†

**KANEDA**:

Ok, here‚Äôs how it‚Äôll work this time, right?¬†¬†First, flat out until Tomaku ramen over in Shiga, then cross district 5 into district 2, and come to a full stop where the bomb fell.¬†¬†Get out and physically touch the barrier at the edge of the highway.¬†¬†And Dai- you actually have to get off your bike.¬†¬†You have been told.¬†¬†After that, turn around and head to Hariyuka‚Äôs.¬†¬†Last one there gets the bill. Now, if the clowns¬†¬†see you, and we have to bail your ass out, you lose.¬†¬†If the police arrest you, you lose, and if you eat it and die, you lose.¬†¬†Everyone got it?

¬†

**TETSUO/KAISUKE/YAMATAGA/DAI**¬†(speaking over eachother):

Not really, no / Fuck you / Get on with it, Kaneda.¬†¬†Serioulsy? / I‚Äôm too stoned to win, this sucks

¬†

**KANEDA**:

Good.¬†¬†And for the last goddamn time.¬†¬†When I beat you, don‚Äôt go whining about how great my ride is.¬†¬†Now: GO!

¬†

Kaneda drops his arm.¬†¬†The gang takes off.¬†¬†Kaneda then walks to his bike, puts his goggles on, and revs the engine.¬†¬†Then, he takes off in pursuit.¬†¬†The bikers race through the crowded, traffic filled city.¬†¬†¬†Neo-Tokyo is the true star of this scene- this is a chance for the viewer to see ‚Äòthe world of Akira‚Äô for the first time. Secondarily, our focus is on Kaneda, as he slowly overtakes the whole gang.¬†¬†¬†First one he overtakes is Tetsuo.¬†¬†Kaneda overtakes him easily.¬†¬†Tetsuo, in fact, tries a dangerous corner to keep Kaneda from overtaking.¬†¬†Kaneda barely avoids a collision that would seriously injure both, while forcing Tetsuo onto a line that keeps Tetsuo from hitting a pedestrian Tetsuo otherwise would have struck.¬†¬†

¬†

**KANEDA**:

Tetsuo!¬†¬†¬†Ain‚Äôt it about time you tamed that bike?

¬†

**TETSUO**:

Shut it, Kaneda!

¬†

Kaneda smirks, and speeds off.¬†

¬†

**TETSUO**:

Fuck!¬†¬†¬†I‚Äôm too broke to buy again.

¬†

¬†Kaneda has an easy time overtaking everyone else, but Kaisuke and Yamataga.¬†¬†¬†Yamataga and Kaneda have a long race duel, Yamataga holding Kaneda off with moves nearly as reckless as Tetsuo‚Äôs- but with mastery, rather than desperation like Tetsuo.¬†¬†Kaneda is clearly enjoying the duel.¬†¬†Yamataga races with determination.¬†¬†Despite Yamataga‚Äôs efforts, Kaneda arrives at the end of the highway first, overlooking a large crater, that appears to be the result of a large bomb or explosion.¬†¬†

¬†

Yamataga arrives to see Kaneda standing, looking over at the destruction.

¬†

**YAMATAGA**:

What‚Äôya standing there for, asshole?¬†¬†I thought this was a race!

¬†

**KANEDA**:

Was it?¬†¬†Couldn‚Äôt hear any motors behind me, so I thought it was a Sunday drive.

  
**YAMATAGA**:¬†

You and I both know what would happen if I could nick a bike as cool as yours.

¬†

**KANEDA**:

Same old tears.¬†¬†Stealing the bike is half the game.¬†¬†Modding it out¬†¬†is the other half.¬†¬†Driving it‚Äôs the‚Ä¶ ninth inning.¬†¬†¬†Anyway, don‚Äôt whine because I‚Äôm great.¬†¬†Admire the splendor.

¬†

**YAMATAGA**:¬†¬†

You‚Äôre so stupid I don‚Äôt even want to stab you anymore.

¬†

**KANEDA**:

If you were a girl, you‚Äôd want my babies.¬†¬†And I‚Äôd want to watch you have them.

  
**YAMATAGA**:¬†¬†

Ew. Ew, dude.¬†¬†¬†¬†Quit ruining it.

  
**KANEDA**:

(Laughing) Ruining what?  
  
**YAMATAGA**:¬†

Everything.

¬†

Kaisuke arrives, and realizes that neither Kaneda or Yamataga are racing.¬†¬†And that both seem so relaxed, its clear, he lost by quite some time.¬†¬†His shoulders drop.¬†

  
**KAISUKE**:¬†

Wha?¬†¬†Why are you just standing -?¬†¬†‚Ä¶Fucking hell.

¬†

Kaisuke leans against the barrier.¬†¬†

¬†

Cut to:¬†

¬†

Tetsuo, riding his bike through the streets.¬†¬†He rides furiously but his lines are terrible.¬†¬†The bike starts to wobble.

  
**TETSUO**:¬†¬†

Shit!¬†¬†Shit shit!

¬†

He gets the bike under control, and, speeds up a bit.¬†¬†He is smiling now, getting close to the destruction.¬†¬†But then he sees the lights and realizes all his friends are sitting there, and becomes angry.¬†¬†

¬†

**TETSUO**:

Goddamnit!

¬†

He grits his teeth, then ‚Äòtucks in‚Äô, dangerously, to bring his speed to a maximum before he has to break hard- as hard as possible- so he doesn‚Äôt fall off the end of the highway.¬†

¬†

Cut to Kaneda, watching.¬†

  
**KANEDA**:¬†

He actually might not make it this time.

¬†

**YAMATAGA**:

Kid‚Äôs insane.

  
**KAISUKE**:¬†

Yep, gonna die.

¬†

Cut to a shot of Tetsuo, braking hard.¬†¬†¬†¬†

¬†

**TETSUO**:

Shit shit shit-

¬†

Then, in front of him, suddenly, an eldery person/child¬†[chimera](https://www.newscientist.com/question/what-is-a-chimera/)¬†(Takashi, indeterminate age, male) appears.¬†¬†¬†The number ‚Äú29‚Äù is inked on his palm in large letters.

  
**TETSUO**:¬†

Shit! Gangway, you idiot-

¬†

Takashi sees Tetsuo and raises his hands.¬†¬†The bike explodes.¬†¬†Tetsuo goes over the handlebars, and flies straight at Takashi, until he hits an invisible barrier, which deflects him over Takashi‚Äôs head, like a rag-doll.¬†¬†Tetsou lands hard behind Takashi.¬†¬†

¬†

**KANEDA**¬†(begins running):¬†¬†

Tetsuo!

  
The gang rush to Tetsuo, with the exception of Kaneda.¬†¬†Kaneda stops to take in the situation.¬†¬†A flashback shows again what happened- how impossible it was- Kaneda is processing that.¬†¬†Then, he looks at Takashi, who is still standing there.¬†

¬†

**KANEDA**:

What did you do?  
  
**TAKASHI**:¬†

I‚Äôm sorry!¬†¬†He scared me!

¬†

**KANEDA**:

What the fuck did you just do?

¬†

Kaneda grabs Takashi.¬†¬†Takashi screams, a scream that Kaneda feels inside his mind (Kaneda grabs his head) then begins slowly backing away, while becoming first ‚Äòmisty,‚Äô as if made of smoke, then nearly invisible.¬†¬†Until he vanishes.¬†

¬†

On the ground behind him, Tetsuo moves.¬†¬†¬†Yamataga and kaisuke are each on one side of Tetsuo, uselessly tending to him.¬†¬†Kaneda can only watch.

¬†

**YAMATAGA**:

Tetsuo!¬†¬†Tetsuo, can you hear me?¬†¬†Are you alright, man?  
  


**KAISUKE**:

We should get him water, right?¬†¬†‚Ä¶Does anyone have water?

¬†

**DAI**:

Anyone have a beer?¬†¬†I‚Äôm traumatized.

¬†

**KANEDA**:

How do we get him to a hospital?

¬†

**DAI**:

Seriously, man, this is why I take drugs.

¬†

Kaisuke:

Not Now, Dai.

¬†

**KANEDA**:

Maybe if we stick him on the back of someone‚Äôs bike?¬†¬†Anyone have cables or something, to tie him down?¬†¬†¬†Would that even work?¬†¬†Fuck‚Ä¶ Tetsuo‚Ä¶

¬†

**Yamataga**:

He‚Äôs knocked out and looks fucked up, I don‚Äôt know if we should move him.¬†¬†Besides, nothing‚Äôs broken.¬†¬†What if we just wait for him to wake up?

¬†

**KAISUKE**:

Seriously?¬†¬†I mean, do you think that‚Äôll work?

¬†

**Yamataga**:

What am I, a doctor?¬†¬†It‚Äôs less crazy than Kaneda‚Äôs idea.¬†

¬†

**Kaneda**:

But, doesn‚Äôt it look like he‚Äôs in pain?

¬†

**Dai**:

Wouldn‚Äôt you be?

¬†

**KAISUKE**:

What the hell¬†*was*¬†that?

¬†

**Kaneda (looks at Tetsuo)**:¬†

Got no idea, but we‚Äôre going to figure it out.¬†¬†Right, Tetsuo?¬†¬†So hang in there.

¬†

¬†

¬†

¬†

¬†

Lights appear.¬†¬†Then, the noise of a helicopter, which appears right above them and descends quickly.¬†¬†But, instead of landing, it stops right above them, and hovers, so the boys are washed in the helicopter‚Äôs disturbed air- then, the helicopter ascends.¬†¬†¬†¬†It climbs until it‚Äôs several hundred feet above the scene, but there it pauses, leaving floodlights on the boys.¬†¬†

¬†

**Dai**:

I‚Äôm tripping, right?¬†

¬†

¬†No one answers,¬†¬†After a beat, they hear a noise and their heads turn, and they step back, for safety.¬†¬†Trucks race in, and break hard to surround the boys.¬†¬†A military team has appeared and quickly secures the perimeter and takes control of the situation.¬†¬†Kaneda runs to them, trying to explain the situation.

¬†

**KANEDA**:

Tetsuo! My friend Tetsuo, he‚Ä¶

¬†

Kaneda is struck by one of the military men and subdued.¬†¬†He tries to keep speaking but his face is shoved into the ground, so, he cannot.¬†¬†¬†Tetsuo is put on a stretcher, stuck with a catheter, and lifted into an unmarked ambulance, semi-conscious and appears in agony.¬†¬†Kaneda pushes off the ground just far enough to be able to yell.

  
**KANEDA**:

That kid!¬†¬†That kid did something to my friend!¬†¬†He- Get off me, ass-¬†¬†Ugh- (he is struck by the military man on top of him, to get him to shut up.)

¬†

Cut to: Interior of helicopter: Takashi sits, looking very nervous, across from the general, a 55 year old Japanese Male, who is staring at Takashi. The general says nothing for a time, letting the stare into Takashi deepen.¬†¬†Takashi squirms.¬†¬†

  
**GENERAL**:¬†

Now that you can see what you have done, I will remind you that this was the best possible outcome.¬†¬†Even if that boy dies.¬†¬†And so, one way or another, this is your last warning. I can no longer stress to you the importance of your voluntary confinement. Nor will I continue to plead that you understand the dangers to you, your siblings, and all of Neo-Tokyo if you continue this childish, and bafflingly stupid behavior.¬†¬†Leaving confinement is not harmless.¬†¬†You are lying to yourself when you pretend it is.¬†¬†And you make a fool of me , as well, when you try to explain away your behavior.¬†¬†And so, I am done wasting my words.¬†¬†I have achieved too much in my life to continue playing nursemaid to a spoiled child¬†¬†playing with a loaded rifle like a toy ball.¬†¬†¬†Understand me now.¬†¬†Hear this well.¬†¬†I will not ask you again.

¬†

**TAKASHI**:

I‚Äôm sorry. But- look, I came back, didn‚Äôt I?¬†¬†I was going to go home, but when I saw the helicopter, I-

  
**GENERAL**:

The time for talking is over.

¬†

Takashi makes audible noise instead of words, as if the general‚Äôs words physically hurt him.

¬†

**GENERAL**¬†(on intercom):¬†¬†

Nyota.¬†¬†By my authorization, take the injured civilian to facility 17-A.¬†¬†Tell the doctor the patient encountered number 29.¬†¬†Have the staff run all available tests and panels.¬†¬†We need to rule out resonance.

¬†

¬†

Takashi watches the city recede as the helicopter leaves.¬†¬†End scene

¬†

¬†

Interior, classroom, day:

  
A history teacher gives a droning lesson.

  
**HISTORY**¬†**TEACHER**: (droning in background)

So to summarize, the Great Tokyo disaster resulted in a series of international conferences attempting new regulations and treaties that ultimately failed as the global political climate became more tense.¬†¬†The outbreak of world war three in 2037 was an inevitable consequence of the Sino-Mexican alliance, and their aggressive expansion.¬†¬†¬†The armistice that ended the war, and forced Japan‚Äôs borders wide open, which is why most of you are so dumb- is a fragile thing that holds today only due to the Kalama accords.¬†¬†Not that the peace will hold.¬†¬†Because, really, it can‚Äôt.¬†¬†If you ever watched the news, you‚Äôd know that.¬†¬†But, you‚Äôre all too busy taking drugs.¬†¬†But I can‚Äôt blame you, because otherwise you‚Äôd be forced to recon with the¬†¬†futility of your sure-to-be-brief lives an inevitability of your painful, humiliating and terrifying deaths, which I imagine will come far sooner than any of you are prepared for.¬†¬†Or, with the fact that with Nara and Kyoto razed in world war three, and the occupation, we have completely lost our national identity.¬†¬†I still can‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs possible, but here we are.¬†¬†This place bears no resemblance to the country I once loved.¬†¬†By the way, this isn‚Äôt water.¬†¬†It‚Äôs the strong stuff.¬†¬†¬†Don‚Äôt blame me- it makes the ‚Äòtalking to myself‚Äô thing I do here easier.¬†¬†Everyone talks to themselves when drunk.¬†¬†Anyway, where was I?¬†¬†Another consequence of the Sino-Mexican alliance was...¬†¬†

¬†

¬†

As the teacher is droning, you see the students in various stages and styles of paying him no attention -card games, drugs, snack foods, etc.¬†¬†Yamataga, I the center of the room, is reading a newspaper.¬†¬†Kaisuke is reading over his shoulder, while smoking.¬†¬†Yamataga is annoyed, and tries to push him away.¬†¬†Dai is asleep, there is an empty pill bottle in his hand.¬†

¬†

Kaneda enters the room and sits down, his back to the teacher, facing his friends.¬†¬†

¬†

**KANEDA**¬†(gestures at newspaper):¬†

Did you find anything about Tetsuo‚Äôs accident or invisible kids?

¬†

**KAISUKE**:

Nothing.

¬†

**YAMATAGA**:

Come on, this was a total long-shot.

¬†

**Kaneda**:

What else can we do?¬†¬†I‚Äôm so worried about him!¬†¬†  
  


**YAMATAGA**(fakes ignorance):¬†

What‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorry?‚Äù

¬†

**KAISUKE**(plays along):

It‚Äôs that feeling when you‚Äôre in the middle of a turn and you realize maybe you won‚Äôt make it out of it.¬†¬†¬†

¬†

**YAMATAGA**(drops act):¬†

Oh.¬†¬†Then I have worry too, dipshit.

¬†

**KANEDA**:¬†¬†

Enough.¬†¬†This is really bad.¬†

  
**YAMATAGA**:

I know, man.¬†¬†I was there.¬†¬†There‚Äôs just nothing we can do about it.

  
**DAI**:¬†

How about drugs?

¬†

**KANEDA**:

His answer for everything.

¬†

**KAISUKE**:

But rarely incorrect.

¬†

Kaneda reaches into his pocket, and absently dumps a baggie of pills on the desktop.

¬†

**KANEDA**:¬†¬†

Too bad you can‚Äôt tell us what happened to Tetsuo like you predict I‚Äôm carrying.

¬†

**DAI**¬†(pops a pill, points up):¬†

My gifts only go in one direction.

**YAMATAGA**:

Fuck off.

**KANEDA**:¬†

**KAISUKE**:

But I like mine with coffee.¬†¬†(turns to ‚ÄòClassmate #1)¬†¬†Hey, kid!¬†¬†Trade you a pill for coffee and seven creds.

¬†

**CLASSMATE**¬†**#1**:¬†

Can I owe you?

  
**YAMATAGA**¬†(loudly):

Oh my god are you serious?

¬†

**TEACHER**:

¬†Um‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòStudents, I will remind you of the decibel detectors seen here and here (points).¬†¬†if you continue your unruly behavior, staff will be sent to assess, repress and redress.¬†¬†You have been warned.‚Äô¬†¬†And by saying that, I have completed my contractual obligation.¬†¬†

¬†

**KANEDA**¬†¬†(to teacher):¬†

We gotto go.

¬†

**KAISUKE**:

We do?

  
**KANEDA**:

Why not?  
  


**TEACHER**:

Fine, you‚Äôre excused.  
  
**DAI**:¬†

He thinks we asked.

¬†

The boys stand up to leave, and begin walking towards and out the classroom door.

¬†

**KAISUKE**:

Well, you did ask, didn‚Äôt you, Kaneda?  
  


**KANEDA**:

Well, wasn‚Äôt so much me asking as, telling him we were getting up. So he knew we were leaving, not trying to stomp him.¬†¬†Didn‚Äôt want him getting all (Kaneda mimics panic)

¬†

**KAISUKE**¬†(Opening the classroom door):

OH SHIT.

In the doorway, several ‚Äòstaff-‚Äò technically ‚Äògym instructors‚Äô stand flanking the school principal.¬†¬†The gym instructors are all very large men.¬†¬†

1hue0qr,https://www.reddit.com/r/raypeat/comments/1hue0qr/disrupted_sulfur_metabolism_impacting_going_peaty/,Disrupted Sulfur Metabolism Impacting Going Peaty,"Has anyone explored impaired sulfur metabolism? For anyone who frequently gets those gross, smelly, sulfury farts, this could be a big sign you're having issues with conversion of sulfur to sulfate which is the primary active form in the body. Before this is dismissed as a hair brained naturopathic idea, I actually think it is quite Peaty. Sulfur is the third most present element in the body. Proper sulfate in the body plays a critical role in the proper structuring of water. Many of these ideas are inspired by Gerald Pollack who was inspired by Gilbert Ling. 

Glyphosate and heavy metal exposure seem to be one of many environmental factors that seriously impair sulfur metabolism. When it is impaired, it can make consumption of sulfury foods like eggs, coffee, even some meats (technically cruciferous vegetables, onion, and garlic too but those aren't very Peaty) quite difficult and causative of brain fog, dermatitis, allergies, etc. 

The big thing I'm trying to figure out is how to proceed with treatment if this is present. I've done a lot of the Peaty stuff but still have lingering issues. While eggs and coffee don't cause me digestive issues, I feel like a few hours out from consumption I get weird symptoms. Complete elimination of sulfur containing foods, while a telling experiment to see if that makes you feel better, is obviously unrealistic. May try to supplement molybdenum and see if that helps. While an antibiotic can wipe out sulfur fixing bacteria, most patients attest to symptoms returning pretty quickly after the antibiotic is used; ie antibiotics don't really fix the underlying issue. Have just started reading into this but it's blowing my mind and may be one of the current blindspots in going Peaty. Perhaps things like impaired sulfur metabolism naturally clear up over time through proper usage of thyroid since my understanding is hydrogen sulfide gets oxidized in the mitochondria to produce sulfates. But idk. I'm unsatisfied saying ""just do this one thing and everything will autocorrect if you wait long enough"". Maybe it will. But if it doesn't, you've wasted months or years on a prayer.

1hudzy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/glasgow/comments/1hudzy2/thank_you_glasgow_for_a_great_holiday_stay/,Thank you Glasgow for a great Holiday stay,"My wife and I and our two early 20 kids stayed in the city from last Monday through Friday and thoroughly enjoyed our visit.  This is going to be a bit long, so hopefully some stick around to see how it turned out. 

Here is the TLDR version: Glasgow is a great city to visit, with a variety of things to do in the area, great food, beer and whisky and friendly people. I highly recommend and hope to be back in a couple of years. 

We received some good advice and help in another thread I started just before coming into the city. [https://www.reddit.com/r/glasgow/comments/1hpjdld/comment/m4o5v5d/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/glasgow/comments/1hpjdld/comment/m4o5v5d/?context=3)

Monday: We arrived, checked into our hotel, the Social Hub, and walked around the city a bit. We had dinner at the Amsterdam. My wife and I then walked around the small Christmas market and ended up at the Piper Whisky Bar. What a great place. Friendly bartenders who helped me sort out different drams to try, while also enjoying some Tennents. Had some great conversations with locals at nearby tables. We had such a good night there. 

Tuesday: We left early to visit and tour Glengoyne Distillary. Fun and easy 45 minute tour with a tasting. Then a visit to the shop and left with a couple of unique bottles they let me taste. Highly recommend a visit. My wife doesn't drink whisky but really liked their 15 year. Friendly tour guide and excellent customer service in the shop.  

We then stopped by Mugdock Country Park and saw the remains of the castle and the old zoo. We also had some coffee at a nice coffee shop located at the visitor center area. We saw so many people walking their dogs. It was a good time. We had a late lunch at Andiamo in Milngavie. A very nice Italian restaurant. All of our food was quality.

For Hogmanay we walked around the city and in and out of a few bars. We had tickets to Shilling Brewing Company who had a fun party that was Las Vegas themed. Mostly we enjoyed seeing the people out in the streets enjoying themselves. We finished the night at the Innis and Gunn taproom. A great female trio of musicians were playing. Very talented. Enjoyed their rendition of Auld Lang Syne at midnight. 

Wednesday: We woke up early and had breakfast at a local bakery. Some sausage rolls and pastries and coffee. We then drove to Stirling Castle and spent a few hours touring it. The audio tour was well done and we all enjoyed it and learned quite a bit. 

We headed to Falkirk to see the Kelpies. Before getting there we stopped at the Blackmill Bar and Kitchen. Had some very nice Steak Pie with mash and green beans, plus a pint of their own lager brewed locally. 

Got back to Glasgow and ended up at Flight Club. We stopped at a couple of other bars first, but they were closed for New Years Day. Understandable. Flight Club had a nice bar, though limited on beer and whisky compared to others. We watched several groups compete at Darts. Seemed a fun place and people were enjoying their time there. 

Thursday: Another local coffee shop for breakfast. Then we headed to Edinburgh. We did the usual walking around, saw the castle from different views, but didn't go in. Saw the street that inspired Daigon Alley, etc... then we went to the Hearts game and watched them play Motherwell. We had a good time there with nice seats on an endline, just outside one of the posts. Hearts won 1-0 so the home fans went home happy. 

Hit the Christmas market after that and the Johny Walker bar with the great view of the castle, then drove back to Glasgow. We went back to the Piper Bar that night and again had a very nice time. They had good solo artists  playing guitar and singing both times we went there. 

Friday: My daughter and wife went to tea at the Buttefly and Pig.... they had a great time. I got to check out the Pot Still and try some different whiskies. The bartender there was fantastic. I ate some good Steak and Scotch pies had a pint and a couple of pours. I loved that place and would be a regular there for sure if I lived nearby. Same with the Piper. There were plenty of locals in the Pot Still around noon when they opened and I enjoyed visiting with them. 

We then went to the Burrell Collection and Pollack Country Park. We really enjoyed it. Yes, we did get up and close with the cows there. Lots of people enjoying the day. It was a great way to end our time in Glasgow. 

Glasgow is a great place to visit. Edinburgh gets a lot of the tourist publicity but I'm glad we chose Glasgow to base out of instead. 

Sincerely,

Bryan Ford

Yet, when i woke up this morning, she was no where to be found.

1hudyua,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hudyua/how_to_be_a_good_neighbor/,How To Be A Good Neighbor,"The porch was tidy, a few flower pots vacant for the winter, and a small porch swing swayed gently in the wind. I must admit I was nervous as I turned to see the gravel road winding through the hills. My house was nearly fifteen acres away from my closest neighbor, whose door I was standing in front of. After all, country life was new to me.

I gently knocked on the door, the sound of a television coming from the other side. I waited a moment, but no one replied. As I turned, I saw an old Silverado, its red paint dusted with a light gray layer of gravel. I knocked again and waited patiently, but after a minute, I turned and began walking down the stairs.

""Can I help you, fella?"" I heard behind me as the door creaked open slightly. I turned back around to see a man with graying hair and a mustache peering out from behind horn-rimmed glasses. His eyes were a nearly wooden brown.

""Hey there, my name is Jake,"" I said awkwardly. ""I'm your new neighbor who moved in a couple of weeks ago, and I was just wondering if I could ask a favor.""

""And what might that be?""

""I just ran out of sugar. I was wondering if I could borrow a cup just to use in my coffee.""

""Whole lot of sugar for a cup of coffee, I'd say,"" he replied with a slight, unapproving frown. ""You'd be fixin‚Äô to bounce off the damn pastures with that much sugar.""

I chuckled nervously. ""Well, I'm not going to use the whole thing on my coffee, just enough to get me by until I get to town to buy some.""

""You gonna bring me a cup and a half back?"" he asked, stepping out onto the porch and locking eyes with me. Taller than me and built like a barrel, he wore thick denim jeans and an even thicker green and black flannel shirt. Confused by his response, I shrugged, searching for the right words.

""A cup and a half?""

""You know, it's chargin‚Äô interest,"" he answered. ""That's usually how stuff works when you borrow, ya know?""

""Well, I guess 'borrowing‚Äô was a poor choice of word,"" I corrected. ""Could I have a cup of sugar, please?""

The man grunted. He took a step forward, his gaze intense. I offered a gentle smile, hoping to disarm him. He tilted his head back and let out a hearty laugh that echoed around us.

""I'm just joshin' ya, man,"" he chuckled. ""Come on in and let's get you a cup of sugar. Can't have any man startin' their day without coffee.""

""Thanks, sir,"" I replied. ""What's your name, by the way?""

""I'm Jebediah, but most people just call me Jeb,"" he responded, extending his hand for a firm handshake. ""Pleasure to meet ya, Jake!""

""Likewise.""

""Alright, come on in and let's get you fixed up,"" he said, gesturing for me to follow him inside. As I walked through the door, I noticed the wood-paneled walls were adorned with various hunting trophies, and the wooden furniture featured taxidermied wild animals.

""Don't worry, they don't bite,"" Jeb chuckled, noticing my stare at his collection. ""I've lived here almost my entire life.""

""You knew who owned my house before me?""

""Yessir, Maude Bell, she was an odd duck.""

""Oh yeah?""

""She wasn't very neighborly,"" Jeb replied as we walked into his meticulously clean kitchen, with four plates perfectly staged on the table. ""We talked a few times, but I miss the days when people were neighborly, ya know?""

""I wish I could say I did, but I'm from the city,"" I replied as he searched through a cabinet of labeled mason jars, pulling out one filled with white sugar. ""Didn't even really know my neighbors.""

""That's a damn shame. I remember growing up, stuff like this happened all the time.""

""Like what?""

""This right here, a neighbor coming over for a cup of sugar or asking for some eggs.""

""Yeah, never much of that where I grew up,"" I admitted. ""Even growing up, I hardly knew my neighbors.""

""Simpler times, I guess,"" Jeb added as he filled a smaller Mason jar with sugar for me, carefully avoiding spilling any on his counter. ""So, what brought you to live down this way?""

""Well, I work remotely, so I figured I'd get out of the city to somewhere more affordable and settle down.""

""What do you do?""

""IT project management.""

""Oh, one of them computer guys,"" Jeb chortled. ""I don't know much about all that fancy tech stuff. I still use an old flip phone.""

""Nothing wrong with retro sometimes,"" I said as I looked around Jeb's kitchen and saw a couple of guns sitting next to his back door: a rifle and a shotgun. Sometimes I'd forget where I moved and this was totally normal. ""So, it's just you in the house?""

Jeb turned with a jar full of sugar in his hand and nodded. ""Yep, the kids are all grown up now and the wife ran off a few years back.""

""Oh, I'm sorry to hear‚Äî""

""Don't be, I'm better off without her nagging my ear off. Women, ya know,"" Jeb chuckled again. ""You live by yourself, right?""

""Yeah,"" I said, slightly caught off guard by his assumption as he handed me the cup of sugar. It was more than a cup. ""Thanks, Jeb.""

""No problem, that's what good neighbors do!""

‚Äì

The only sound was the clicking of my keyboard when I heard a faint knock at the front door. I continued typing, hoping to get the last email sent off, but the knocking grew louder, more insistent, and finally, aggressive.

""One second, I'm coming!"" I shouted, hitting enter to send the email (it must have been the thirtieth time I'd hit send). But the knocking stopped before I reached the door. As I opened it, I saw Jeb marching angrily over to an ATV and retrieving a shotgun. He pointed it in the air, pulled the trigger, and a boom erupted across the air.

""What the hell!"" I screamed, startled. Jeb, who had noticed me at the door, grinned widely. He placed the gun on the ATV and shuffled over to me.

""That's called a 'holler doorbell,'"" he explained.

""Okay, I've never heard of that,"" I replied. ""But I would appreciate it if you didn't do that.""

His grin vanished, replaced by a blank expression. ""How was I supposed to get your attention then?"" he asked bluntly.

""The knock got my attention,"" I said. ""I was on my way to the door. I was just in my office.""

""I saw your car, figured you were home,"" he stated, standing inches from me, peering into my doorway. ""Sorry, I know you're new around here. I didn't think it through.""

""It's okay, I guess,"" I said. ""So what's up, Jeb?""

""I was just wonderin‚Äô if you have a stick of butter?"" he asked, his gleeful grin returning. My nerves, however, were still a little rattled. ""Mind if I borrow some?""

‚ÄúAre you going to bring a stick and quarter next time?‚Äù I awkwardly tried to joke. He looked at me in silence for almost ten seconds, but then his head tilted back and he laughed loudly, even harder than the time he used the same joke.¬†

‚ÄúGood one, sir!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAlright, let's get you a stick of butter,‚Äù I replied, starting to feel a little more at ease, as I walked inside. Jeb followed his eyes darting back and forth as if he was soaking in my house.¬†

‚ÄúReally gave this place a facelift didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYea, I‚Äôve owned it for a couple months before I moved in,‚Äù I answered as we walked through the house towards the kitchen. ‚ÄúIt just needed a little modernizing, you know?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBy-golly, it almost feels like I walked into the future,‚Äù Jeb chortled, as the two of us stepped into my kitchen. As I opened the refrigerator and pulled out a stick of butter, handing it over to him.

‚ÄúNothing too fancy, I assure you,‚Äù I said while handing him the stick of butter. He continued to scan everything around him silently as held onto the butter. ‚ÄúSo, got any plans for the weekend?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust gonna be watchin college games.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, are your kids coming over?‚Äù¬†¬†

He sneered and said, ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt come around, Jake.‚Äù

""Oh, sorry, I just thought‚Äî""

""Why would you bring that up?"" he asked coldly, his face blank. ""Do I ask you about your dumb family?""

""Excuse me?""

""Sorry, I shouldn't have said that,"" he replied, his grin returning, though it felt unnerving.

""Alright, well I am sorry if it feels like I am rushing you out the door,"" I replied. ""But I have to get back to work.""

""I get it, you got to get back to that fancy moon man job,"" Jeb said with a hearty laugh. ""Thanks for the butter, neighbor.""

""It's no problem,"" I said, as we walked to the front door. He patted me on the back a couple of times, but something about his eyes when he did it was off, as if he was wishing he was slapping me.

""Alright, I will see you around sometime.""

""Yea, yea, see you around,"" I said nervously, as I watched him walk down to his ATV. He turned around one last time, giving a big wave with an even bigger smile before mounting his vehicle and revving the engine loudly.

‚Äì

I wasn't sleeping well. The sound of ATV engines and wheels kept creeping into my dreams, waking me up. My phone displayed 3:45 AM. I got out of bed, turning on the light before heading downstairs for a glass of water. I hoped hydrating would allow me to fall back asleep. As I returned to my bedroom, I debated for a moment whether to go back to sleep or simply start my day early.

As I walked over to my window, I gazed out at the scenery. It was an adjustment from city life, but I was slowly starting to appreciate the quiet. However, that appreciation was brief as I scanned the field and saw something in the distance.

There, standing in the pasture, sitting on an ATV and looking directly at my window, was Jeb.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù

I quickly turned off my light to feign sleep, but I could hear it. Maybe it wasn't a dream; could Jeb have been circling my property with his ATV all night? No, that's crazy. But so is sitting in a field at 3:45 AM.

It was a faint, but slow rumble in the distance, as I stood frozen in the dark bedroom. It inched closer, each second sending a thudding tremor through my chest. Before I knew it, I heard a knock at the door. A few seconds later, another knock, this time heavier and more aggressive.

Maybe he'll think I'm asleep? No, I'm an idiot for even thinking that. He's clearly unhinged. I needed to call the cops, but I didn't want him to see me move, so I did the only thing that came to mind. I crawled, the knocking growing angrier and louder, slowly inching on my knees towards my nightstand to reach my phone.

Then came the loud bang.¬†

I was stiffly on my hands and knees as glass rained down on me. I looked up to see my bedroom window shattered from the shotgun blast. ‚ÄúOh, looks like my late-night doorbell might have been a little off-center,‚Äù Jeb yelled with his hearty laugh.

‚ÄúYou blew out my fucking window!‚Äù I yelled back.

‚ÄúSo you are awake?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnyone would be awake with an ATV drive-by‚Äù'

‚ÄúSuppose you're right about that,‚Äù Jeb responded. ‚ÄúYou think I can grab a beer?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, it's almost four in the morning!‚Äù

""Well, I was going to do some smokin' takes about twelve hours.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't fucking care!‚Äù I screamed. ‚ÄúYou shot my window out and I am calling the cops!‚Äù

It was silent for a moment, giving me the slight bit of hope that my threat to call the police would make him go away. But after another one of his laughs, Jeb said, ""That's not very neighborly of you to call the cops.""¬†

""You shot my window out!"" I yelled, crawling over to where my phone lay and beginning to dial 911. ""Seriously, Jeb, go home and wait for the cops there.""

""You know how far out we are?"" Jeb responded with a cold tone. ""We are about 45 minutes away from town. And if you're lucky, just maybe they have a trooper stationed down at the exit. But around this time, he's usually at the Buc-ee's watching YouTube videos and eating jerky.""

""Jeb, I am calling them now!"" I yelled one more time, but was greeted not by a response but another shotgun blast that shattered the remaining window frame.

""I just need a beer, Jake!"" Jeb screamed. ""Hell, I'll even bring you a platter of what I'm smoking.""

""I don't have any beer!""

""What kind of man lives in the country and doesn't have beer?""

""Me, this guy, the one who had his window shot out and is about to call the cops.""

""I don't believe you!"" he shouted.

""No, I am actually calling the cops,"" I shouted back.

""Not about that,"" Jeb hurled back. ""About the beer, I know you got one in the fridge."" ""What?"" ""I wanna see for myself!"" Jeb screamed. ""I wanna know if you are just lying and not being a good neighbor!""

¬†‚ÄúI am not letting you in,‚Äù I countered loudly. Fear gripped me as I heard an ATV engine roar to life. Peeking out the window, I braced myself for the worst. Jeb was revving his engine.¬†

He launched himself towards my house, and a tremendous thud shook the front door. I knew I had to get out, and quickly. I ran downstairs and dialed 911. ""911, what is your emergency?"" the operator's voice crackled.¬†

""My neighbor! He's trying to break into my house with his ATV! He's been shooting at me!"" I screamed, the sound of the engine deafening as Jeb rammed the front door. The wood splintered, and the frame groaned under the pressure from the ATV.

""Sir, are you somewhere safe?"" the operator asked.¬†

""No, he's trying to break in!""¬†

""Sir, try to find a safe place. I am dispatching someone now,"" the operator replied. I fled towards the kitchen, past the refrigerator, and towards the back door, desperate to escape my own home from Jeb.

It was frigid outside, but I heard the front door finally succumb to the constant assault as I scrambled further into the biting cold. I had to escape. I started running towards the edge of my property, but then I heard Jeb shout, ‚ÄúYou were right, you didn't have any beer!‚Äù I turned to see him standing at my back door, but all I could do was run.

My ribs ached with every pounding step, but the sickening roar of the ATV grew louder. Horror gripped me as I saw Jeb approaching, his face a mask of grim determination. ""I'm gonna get ya!"" he bellowed, his voice echoing through the pastures and woods.

""I called the cops!"" I shouted back, but my words seemed to only fuel his pursuit. He slowed momentarily, as if toying with me, before unleashing the ATV again. I could hear his manic laughter in the distance.

""Alright, this time I'm really gonna get ya!""

The engine roared, propelling him forward with renewed speed. I pushed myself harder, my eyes fixed on the creek embankment ‚Äì my last hope of escape.

""You think you can get away?"" Jeb shouted, his face inches from mine as we raced side-by-side. ""Don't you know what it's like to be a good neighbor!""

He stared at me, then swerved his head, realizing we were both heading towards the creek bed. Panic flared in his eyes. He slammed on the brakes, attempting a sharp turn, but the ATV flipped, throwing Jeb off as it barrel-rolled several times into the field.

I stopped running, my sides burning. An eerie silence descended, broken only by the distant wail of approaching sirens. A loud moan pierced the air. I approached Jeb, who laid on the ground, his head bleeding profusely, his legs twisted in unnatural ways. A chilling grin spread across his face. ""Be a good neighbor now,"" he groaned, ""and call an ambulance.""",8,1736102783.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time, but I felt a deep connection with her, and she asked me to exchange phone numbers. What was weird is that she trauma-dumped on me during the night we hooked up, telling me how her mom passed away when she was a kid.

The first few times we hung out, she seemed really into me, but she was flaky and always late. She would constantly lie about small things that I didn‚Äôt even care about. I called her out on it, and she stopped ‚Äì except for the lying part. She told me how she didn‚Äôt want anything serious, how she hadn‚Äôt been in a relationship for six years, and how she only hooks up, etc. So, we agreed on a FWB-type scenario where I emphasized the friendship part. However, after one time, she started distancing herself ‚Äì never initiating contact but always agreeing to hang out.

¬†

We started hanging out regularly‚Äîat least once a week‚Äîfor several hours (sometimes 7-8 hours), but it was usually at a bar. Over time, I felt like we were growing closer, and there was a clear sense of romantic tension. She began opening up more; however, by the end of our meetups, she would always reiterate that she didn‚Äôt want anything serious. At times, she could be blunt or critical, making comments about me being boring, even though she consistently chose to spend so much time with me. She also insisted on tagging along with my friends when I had other plans, which made things awkward.

Fast forward a bit, and our hangouts turned into 2-3 times a week ‚Äì after which she would always distance herself even more. She was doing this dance where she would literally invite me to her place, start getting close to me, like putting her legs over me or sitting extremely close to me, and then pull away panicking like she didn‚Äôt know what to do. She would make comments like, ‚ÄúWe should have a scientific experiment where you blindfold me and we get physical,‚Äù but when I got close, she would pull away. This lasted for some time. I suggested that we should start dating ‚Äì she wouldn‚Äôt say no but rather ¬†invite me to her place. At that time, she started lending me some books.

She got sick, so we hadn‚Äôt seen each other for a few weeks ‚Äì but when we met in person, we continued where we left off. We decided to go out drinking one night with my friends. I offered to pick her up, and she accepted but made a big deal out of it because ‚Äúwe are arriving together.‚Äù She invited us to her place after that, where she was extremely affectionate, sitting in my lap in front of my friends, touching my legs, etc. She suggested we send them home and that I stay over ‚Äì so we called them a cab, but immediately after they left, she started pulling back again, saying she didn‚Äôt feel like having sex. I told her that I didn‚Äôt understand what was going on. We hung out for half an hour more, and I told her I was going to bed. We cuddled and held hands for hours in bed ‚Äì just chatting, and then she hit me with, ‚ÄúThis is wrong, but hand-holding made me horny. Let‚Äôs get physical, but if we do, we aren‚Äôt allowed to see each other ever again.‚Äù I told her no, and she said, ‚ÄúNo kissing then,‚Äù which I also refused ‚Äì and then we had the most passionate kiss ever. I left in the morning, and she lent me another book (I had asked about it a long time ago but didn‚Äôt even remember anymore ‚Äì she just gave it to me). It was a personal book, which was her mom‚Äôs gift to a friend who later gave it to her. However, there was a lot of stuff underlined in the book, so I asked her who had underlined it ‚Äì after which she pulled away again.

¬†

After that, she was extremely distant. She avoided meeting up for three weeks. We finally met up with a friend of mine, and she told me she had been avoiding me because she got into a relationship two weeks ago and it wouldn‚Äôt be fair if she were still hanging out with me (but she had no problem sleeping with a married guy before that, and she would even defend him, saying how considerate he was because he didn‚Äôt want to divorce because of the kids). I told her I would still like to continue hanging out and that I would respect her choices because, honestly, I really do care about her and wouldn‚Äôt want to cut her out of my life. She mentioned multiple times that we wouldn‚Äôt hang out one-on-one ever again. After the bar closed, I told her to come to my place so I could give her stuff back (which she had mentioned multiple times how sentimental it was). I was already in the car, and she called me, telling me to come to another bar. She then proceeded to attack me ‚Äì saying she would never date me, that she was only hanging out with me because she didn‚Äôt have anyone else to hang out with, that she only accepted my invitations to hang out because she didn‚Äôt want to be rude, and tried gaslighting me that stuff that happened never happened. In all of that, she said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt even experienced anything in your life‚Äù ‚Äì which I took to mean I hadn‚Äôt traveled a lot or similar. I sarcastically answered, ‚ÄúNo, you did,‚Äù and then she started crying and told me again how young her mom was when she died. I tried explaining that I didn‚Äôt understand her comment in that context. I asked her if she wanted to talk about what happened as well. I have some stuff that I‚Äôve been through (not as heavy, obviously), so I opened up as well, and at that point, we were both crying. She told me she was sorry she ever met me, that she just lost all respect for me, and then blocked me on socials in front of me. She told me she was going to the bathroom, then messaged me a few minutes later saying she had to leave because she was not in the mood to talk anymore and that we would see each other next time. She didn‚Äôt even send me a happy new year text (she didn‚Äôt block my phone number).

Now ‚Äì I know this is quite a story; however, I really do care about her and would like to stay in her life as a friend. I have no idea why. I have no idea how to proceed with this. At the very least, I would like to return the stuff she lent me, as she mentioned multiple times how important it is to her. I was thinking of sending her a message asking if she wants to pick her stuff up, if I should mail it to her, or if I should bring it next time when we see each other (if ever). This is hard for me because I feel like I lost the last bit of self-respect I had, especially after she told me she was only hanging out with me because she didn‚Äôt have anyone else to hang out with (which seems contradictory ‚Äì multiple times she left coffee with her friends to hang out with me ‚Äì unless she was lying). But I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm hurting someone by not returning their sentimental belongings.

**TL;DR**: I (29M) met a girl (25F) 3.5 months ago and developed a complicated FWB relationship. She often sent mixed signals‚Äîbeing affectionate, spending hours with me, and lending me sentimental items‚Äîonly to pull away, act rude, and remind me she didn‚Äôt want anything serious. Recently, she revealed she started dating someone else, avoided me for weeks, and told me she only hung out with me out of politeness. During an argument, she claimed I hadn‚Äôt ‚Äúbeen through anything in life.‚Äù I misunderstood and responded sarcastically, which made her cry and bring up her mom‚Äôs death. We both got emotional, and she ultimately blocked me on socials but not on my phone.

I still care about her and want to stay friends, though I don‚Äôt know why. At the very least, I want to return the sentimental items she lent me (she‚Äôs mentioned how important they are). I was thinking of messaging her to ask if she wants to pick them up, mail them, or wait until we (potentially) see each other again?",1,1736102649.0,relationshipadvice,3,1.0,False

1hudwej,https://www.reddit.com/r/ar15/comments/1hudwej/barrel_pw_was_just_pondering/,Barrel P&W- Was Just Pondering‚Ä¶,"So I‚Äôm doing a \~14.5‚Äù that I am going to pin & weld. Just enjoying a coffee, stream of consciousness thing going on and my thoughts drifted to my build that I‚Äôm working on. Specifically, muzzle devices caught my attention. Been looking at a lot of them, trying to find the right combo of enough area to P&W (if you‚Äôre not a gunsmith, like me) and good flash hider design for if I don‚Äôt have the can attached.

So here what‚Äôs I‚Äôm wondering‚Ä¶ *why would someone want to P&W an 11.5‚Äù vs a 14.5‚Äù*? Don‚Äôt you end up with the same overall length, just one with a much larger muzzle device? I guess, maybe (stream of consciousness again), depending on how much space until the baffles, you *might* end up with a shorter config when the can is attached‚Ä¶ that would be very can and muzzle device dependent though. Am I missing something? I see these [muzzle devices for shorter barrels](https://primaryweapons.com/frc-3-port-223-compensator-flat-13-8-1-2-28/) sometimes (yeah, that one is for 13.8‚Äù, but the idea is the same), but I don‚Äôt see what you‚Äôre gaining over the 14.5‚Äù. I mean, ballistically, as you go down from 14.5‚Äù you start seeing significant decreases in MV and energy on target. Why would you go shorter and then not just SBR? Again, am I missing something here?",2,1736102619.0,ar15,9,1.0,False

1hudqgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1hudqgp/i_29m_dont_know_how_to_proceed_in_convoluted/,I (29M) don't know how to proceed in convoluted emotional situation with 25F ,"So, I (29M) met this girl (25F) about 3 ¬Ω months ago ‚Äì we hit it off and hooked up. I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time, but I felt a deep connection with her, and she asked me to exchange phone numbers. What was weird is that she trauma-dumped on me during the night we hooked up, telling me how her mom passed away when she was a kid.

The first few times we hung out, she seemed really into me, but she was flaky and always late. She would constantly lie about small things that I didn‚Äôt even care about. I called her out on it, and she stopped ‚Äì except for the lying part. She told me how she didn‚Äôt want anything serious, how she hadn‚Äôt been in a relationship for six years, and how she only hooks up, etc. So, we agreed on a FWB-type scenario where I emphasized the friendship part. However, after one time, she started distancing herself ‚Äì never initiating contact but always agreeing to hang out.

¬†

We started hanging out regularly‚Äîat least once a week‚Äîfor several hours (sometimes 7-8 hours), but it was usually at a bar. Over time, I felt like we were growing closer, and there was a clear sense of romantic tension. She began opening up more; however, by the end of our meetups, she would always reiterate that she didn‚Äôt want anything serious. At times, she could be blunt or critical, making comments about me being boring, even though she consistently chose to spend so much time with me. She also insisted on tagging along with my friends when I had other plans, which made things awkward.

Fast forward a bit, and our hangouts turned into 2-3 times a week ‚Äì after which she would always distance herself even more. She was doing this dance where she would literally invite me to her place, start getting close to me, like putting her legs over me or sitting extremely close to me, and then pull away panicking like she didn‚Äôt know what to do. She would make comments like, ‚ÄúWe should have a scientific experiment where you blindfold me and we get physical,‚Äù but when I got close, she would pull away. This lasted for some time. I suggested that we should start dating ‚Äì she wouldn‚Äôt say no but rather ¬†invite me to her place. At that time, she started lending me some books.

She got sick, so we hadn‚Äôt seen each other for a few weeks ‚Äì but when we met in person, we continued where we left off. We decided to go out drinking one night with my friends. I offered to pick her up, and she accepted but made a big deal out of it because ‚Äúwe are arriving together.‚Äù She invited us to her place after that, where she was extremely affectionate, sitting in my lap in front of my friends, touching my legs, etc. She suggested we send them home and that I stay over ‚Äì so we called them a cab, but immediately after they left, she started pulling back again, saying she didn‚Äôt feel like having sex. I told her that I didn‚Äôt understand what was going on. We hung out for half an hour more, and I told her I was going to bed. We cuddled and held hands for hours in bed ‚Äì just chatting, and then she hit me with, ‚ÄúThis is wrong, but hand-holding made me horny. Let‚Äôs get physical, but if we do, we aren‚Äôt allowed to see each other ever again.‚Äù I told her no, and she said, ‚ÄúNo kissing then,‚Äù which I also refused ‚Äì and then we had the most passionate kiss ever. I left in the morning, and she lent me another book (I had asked about it a long time ago but didn‚Äôt even remember anymore ‚Äì she just gave it to me). It was a personal book, which was her mom‚Äôs gift to a friend who later gave it to her. However, there was a lot of stuff underlined in the book, so I asked her who had underlined it ‚Äì after which she pulled away again.

¬†

After that, she was extremely distant. She avoided meeting up for three weeks. We finally met up with a friend of mine, and she told me she had been avoiding me because she got into a relationship two weeks ago and it wouldn‚Äôt be fair if she were still hanging out with me (but she had no problem sleeping with a married guy before that, and she would even defend him, saying how considerate he was because he didn‚Äôt want to divorce because of the kids). I told her I would still like to continue hanging out and that I would respect her choices because, honestly, I really do care about her and wouldn‚Äôt want to cut her out of my life. She mentioned multiple times that we wouldn‚Äôt hang out one-on-one ever again. After the bar closed, I told her to come to my place so I could give her stuff back (which she had mentioned multiple times how sentimental it was). I was already in the car, and she called me, telling me to come to another bar. She then proceeded to attack me ‚Äì saying she would never date me, that she was only hanging out with me because she didn‚Äôt have anyone else to hang out with, that she only accepted my invitations to hang out because she didn‚Äôt want to be rude, and tried gaslighting me that stuff that happened never happened. In all of that, she said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt even experienced anything in your life‚Äù ‚Äì which I took to mean I hadn‚Äôt traveled a lot or similar. I sarcastically answered, ‚ÄúNo, you did,‚Äù and then she started crying and told me again how young her mom was when she died. I tried explaining that I didn‚Äôt understand her comment in that context. I asked her if she wanted to talk about what happened as well. I have some stuff that I‚Äôve been through (not as heavy, obviously), so I opened up as well, and at that point, we were both crying. She told me she was sorry she ever met me, that she just lost all respect for me, and then blocked me on socials in front of me. She told me she was going to the bathroom, then messaged me a few minutes later saying she had to leave because she was not in the mood to talk anymore and that we would see each other next time. She didn‚Äôt even send me a happy new year text (she didn‚Äôt block my phone number).

Now ‚Äì I know this is quite a story; however, I really do care about her and would like to stay in her life as a friend. I have no idea why. I have no idea how to proceed with this. At the very least, I would like to return the stuff she lent me, as she mentioned multiple times how important it is to her. I was thinking of sending her a message asking if she wants to pick her stuff up, if I should mail it to her, or if I should bring it next time when we see each other (if ever). This is hard for me because I feel like I lost the last bit of self-respect I had, especially after she told me she was only hanging out with me because she didn‚Äôt have anyone else to hang out with (which seems contradictory ‚Äì multiple times she left coffee with her friends to hang out with me ‚Äì unless she was lying). But I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm hurting someone by not returning their sentimental belongings.

**TL;DR**: I (29M) met a girl (25F) 3.5 months ago and developed a complicated FWB relationship. She often sent mixed signals‚Äîbeing affectionate, spending hours with me, and lending me sentimental items‚Äîonly to pull away, act rude, and remind me she didn‚Äôt want anything serious. Recently, she revealed she started dating someone else, avoided me for weeks, and told me she only hung out with me out of politeness. During an argument, she claimed I hadn‚Äôt ‚Äúbeen through anything in life.‚Äù I misunderstood and responded sarcastically, which made her cry and bring up her mom‚Äôs death. We both got emotional, and she ultimately blocked me on socials but not on my phone.

I still care about her and want to stay friends, though I don‚Äôt know why. At the very least, I want to return the sentimental items she lent me (she‚Äôs mentioned how important they are). I was thinking of messaging her to ask if she wants to pick them up, mail them, or wait until we (potentially) see each other again?",2,1736102202.0,relationships_advice,0,1.0,False

my previous post,

God , Satan and human evolution 

for some reason, something has formed in my mind .
a series of questions answers and thoughts keeped coming up  regarding the true nature of things. 
don't know how to start..so i just will

-God's way  : top to bottom,all potentials, timeless and limitless, the struggle and sacrifice of creation/separation from within.

-Lucifer's way: bottom to up phenomenon , made of parts,matter,self identification .


-Satan / Lucifer is real and the ruler of earth but God is eternal-

among the angels that God has created Satan is the most special , his rebellion against God
was certainly God's intention.
and is not evil from Gods perspective .

there is an allegory to explain things to come:

a soul of a man came knocking at heaven doors,
God then asks him: who is there?
the soul answers: it is ""I"" 
but not allowed to come in .
only when the soul realised and answered:
it is only you (God) that is there,
the soul allowed into heaven .

such was Satan's rebellion and the reason he was expelled from heaven , he dared to say 'I'  and have his own way. an illusion.
the earth,objective and the physical have been created in that way and is ,Satan's kingdom,  everything in it says ""I"".
separated and alien to underlying subjective .
and so is all modern science and medicine for that matter.

- Adam and Eve, Satan , Jesus and evolution -

at the garden of Eden, the fruit of the tree of knowledge is given to humanity by Satan,
because what is to be perceived as separate ego, ultimately comes from the thinking , dissecting mind,it is a battle ground for what falsely claims to be the real ,and everything else that makes that even possible, but seen as ""nothing but.."".

 as seen by evidence in a development of an individual, and corresponds to the of evolution humanity.   the scenes of self travels up , from the stomach, lungs, mouth to be behind the eyes .
Christ or the third eye consciousness is the next step, that was Satan's whole purpose in a sense.
the fire that is created between the known and the unknown, is the birth of the true self.


Alternative Creation Story 

-plus short analysis at the end-



it's a story about god's dream:

in the beginning,there was nothing.
 and then ,the dream was everything. 
everything roared like a lion with countless eyes , ramming and devouring each other .
seasons came and nothing left,and in their dreams they saw nothing.

in the second dream there were two dreams .
there was a wild boundless garden with many, what you would call ,sheeps , wolfs and bushes with thorns and sweet fruit .
many creatures ,all roaring with life .
and there was a Gardener who saw in his dream what the beasts and plants are seeing in their eyes.

after he saw in his dream that everything ""I""s and roars ,even the sheep thought that they were lions.
 
he immediately tended to cut down the thorny bushes that the sheeps got tangled with while eating the sweet fruit, that naturally made them drunk and even grow their wool resembling the main of a lion .
he built a fence of the thorny bushes , and a gate ,so the sheeps could go out to the fields of the wild bush.

then he fed the hungry wolf who couldn't get near the thorns of the bush that the sheeps were traped in.
and in return the wolf became loyal to the gardener ,and helped to impose his will on the wild.

the sun came,and the drunk sheeps did not burn in the bush with the dry thorns, but were trimmed ,and herd by the wolf to safety.
 
wild beasts came and the loyal wolf fended them off. floods came and the fences protected them.

in your dream, the third dream,
there are three dreams .
 the second dream ,that of the garden, the Gardeners dream and his deeds . 
and the first dream of the roaring sheeps , that threatened to burn everything in their drunkenness, in a garden of dry thorns and starving wondering wolves. 

all had to give up the the thing that they loved most, the thing that defined them,
but separated them from eachother and eventually from life itself.

they had to separate from them selves to for the principal of existence ,in the image of god.

                  -end-


-analysis and characters-

this story weaved in my mind from separate metaphors an impressios,

sheep vs lion -
a metaphor i heard once ,
of something in us that thinks its the king that protects and knows everything but in turn causes stagnation. it is said that in order to overcome this,we should make that lion in to a lamb and sacrifice it.

the sheeps- 
many as one ,opposed to singular that is many and therefore opposed to god.
also represents the multitude of personas the individual has .

also the sheeps connection to dreams ,as in counting sheeps before falling asleep.

there is of course the story of the coffee bean , the strange behaviour of goats after eating from the coffee bush, ,which are not sheeps but close enough.

the wild bush - represents in this case the beliefs we passively accumulate ,that if unattended grow wild ,and restrict our ego.
but can be shaped merely by conscious light,
to gather ,protect and feed it .

the wolf/dog -  represent intuition, connection to the unknown.
considered  as  one of the greatest conquers of man.
c g Jung talked about how the archetyp of a saviour ,or jesus, experienced as a dog in the dreams of his patients.

-conversation between satan and me -

m:hi ,i was wondering about stuff.. .

s: ..don't bother yourself.. see ,the whole world is random and crazy, your parents ,two confuse sacks of rotting flesh and rattling bones, fucked ,had a stupid baby, and that's you.  so go out, do the same and enjoy or don't, I don't care ,you have free will to do whatever you want, as I said, we can even cut a deal , either way I'll scatter your meaningless atoms across the infinite universe .that's the only way things can go here in my world . 

m: wow ,, that's a mouthful..could you do it other way? do you have free will? 

s: are you crazy ? don't you see all the multiplicities I'm all those things ,, it's a mess..

m: so you're the creator ?

s: I am things ,and would be random as I can ,and just freeze... but something makes me move and silly coincidences occur, .look at yourself.
 ..but it's all just random happening of separate things, and I am all those things, Im god. 

m: i know ..but things that happen, didn't you say they're happen only in one way they could.? 

s:yes .. nothing you can do 

m:so.. all random separate happenings must stand ,so that one thing could take place? 

s: ,, you could say so, , like your death!,muuhahahaha..

m: damn, that's .. funny..hh.. anyway,.it seems like, if that's the case, you could almost say that all random separate things and happenings,
 know somehow what the other random things are doing... i mean,could they be connected after all?

 s: F you, you're nothing but ..

m: come on.. you said yourself that there are silly coincidences, just trying figure out your world, since I'm here and all.

s: I don't need your help . this is nothing , I am the only thing that came into being and I don't care from where.
and that's right, you're stuck here with Me, I'm in your head.. there is nothing to figure out.  it's all just in your stupid imagination. 

 m: what... like its all a dream ,and everything is just me, and I should treat you and everything as such? 

s: smartass.. imagine that: I'm gonna get you in the end. 

m: yes I know, you'll have what's yours.

I must have looked ridiculous, because I was ridiculous, naked and kneeling on the floor with my face in a dish of leftover food eating ""like an animal""  just as she had told me to.
As I lowerd my face to the dish I saw that some of the food left there was chewed up and had been spat out to mix with the other leftovers.

Pathetically I still ate it, I was so hungry and I had become so utterly cowed by her treatment of me that I was actually craving the humiliation. Eating their spat out food was a treat in my  twisted mind. 

I cleared away and washed up before laying on on my kitchen floor.  
Laying there in the dark I could here faintly hear the muffled sounds of raw sexual passion coming from 'my' bedroom. Suddenly a wave of emotion came over me,  jealousy,  loneliness, self pitty and self loathing all mixed.  My thoughts jumbled and incoherent, questioning my self.
Why was I allowing this to happen? Im not an animal, I deserve to be loved not abused and degraded! 

Even while I was wallowing in my self pity my hands strayed down to my little cock, stroking it as i grew to its full three inches.

My own shame was arousing me, the very thing I hated about myself was, at that moment tuning me on and making me hard. I was wanking to my own destruction! And making it even worse I stopped, denying myself because I knew is would make her angry with me if I behaved so selfishly and wanked without her permission.
That night I quietly cried myself to sleep, in state of aroused selfloathing. 

I loved her so much.

I didn't sleep much and at least twice in the night the screams of their sexual pleasure tortured me. Reminding me of my place in her life and the simple fact that she was using me for the money she could make me give her and abusing me along the way.

I loved her so much.

Around 7 o'clock I decide to get prepared for them getting up, perhaps they would demand breakfast or at least tea/coffee. I wanted to be ready and not risk annoying them. It was near half 9 when she called on me, shouting from 'her' bed.

""Get in here now, loser"". 

I almost tripped up over my own feet running around up the stairs. I stopped outside the door and knocked. 

""You may enter"" 

Even as she spoke they both burst into fits of laughter. I opened the door and nervously walked into the room. 
The sight i was greeted with made me feel dizzy with excitement and embarrassment in equal measure! 
He was on his back with her sitting astride him, slowly grinding herself on his cock!  Without even looking at me she gasped the words...

""We're going to let you watch us fuck, all you have to do is go to the ATM and get us ¬£100 each the minute we've finished. ¬£150 each and you can suck the sex mess off the sheets"".  He gave a snort of contempt at those last words.

I stood there frozen and in my own personal heaven! The sight of her riding him was amazing to me. Her hair, touseled and messy from multiple bouts of passion, tumbling down over her shoulders, her gorgeous breasts firmly bouncing up and down, their bodies coated in a sheen of sweat. The gutteral sounds of sex from both of them as she bounced on him.  

Seconds later she arched her back, her head thrashing from side to side as her orgasm wracked her body. 

""Fuck, yessssss, fuck me fucking fuck me, yessss yesss! 
FUCKKKKKK, YESSSSSS, FUCKKKK""! 

It seemed to last for ever, like time stood still and yet it was just minutes. 
She collapsed on top of him, her breathing  coming in gulps and gasps.

How long I was left standing there I have no idea but I never wanted that moment to end. 

She eventually rolled off of him, I heard him slip out of her with a definite slurping sound, bringing a gently moan from her lips. 
As she lay there beside him, both of them in the afterglow. Without even looking at me....

""Tea, toast with butter, stawbery jam and black coffee, quickly. Then fuck off to the bank to get our money. You pervert"". 

This time I actually did bow to her as I walked out of my own bedroom saying
""Thank you, thank you for .....thank you"". 

Their mocking laughter only ears as I dashed downstairs to prepare their breakfast. 

I loved her so much.

Due to work, I just had the chance to pull my first two shots on our Flair 58, using the JU (I did use the JU to grind for our daily pot of coffee for a couple of days, just to start seasoning the burrs). 

(I got my F58 for Christmas 2023, and have been using my X-Pro for the last year, and took advantage of the recent 20% off sale on Amazon on the JU.)

I tried 150 clicks out from full fine for my first shot, using Onyx Kenyan Munthigini, and was initially disappointed because I could only hit about 2 bar of pressure, and it flowed out in about 5 seconds. But then I tasted the shot, and was blown away by how tasty it was! 

I assume that I unknowingly produced a ‚Äúturbo shot‚Äù. 

For my next shot, I went 20 clicks finer (130 clicks out from full fine), using Onyx Geometry (a medium light blend of Ethiopian and Colombian beans). This time, I was able to build a bit more pressure (3-4 bar), but I still pulled about 40ml from 18g of coffee in less than 10 seconds. 

I was again frustrated, but was again surprised at how good the coffee was. It was great!

1hudl0a,https://i.redd.it/ghsultv1y7be1.jpeg,Empaths in Disguise: The Hidden Duality of Compassion and Danger,"AI image



In the bustling heart of New York City, where the cacophony of life intertwines with the dreams of millions, I found myself in a small caf√© tucked away on a side street. It was here that I first encountered the phenomenon of the empath‚Äîan individual so deeply attuned to the emotions of others that they often carry the weight of the world on their shoulders. Yet, as I would soon discover, these seemingly benign, compassionate souls can harbor an unsettling undercurrent, a duality that prompts a deeper exploration of whether empaths, often perceived as gentle beings, can also possess a dangerous edge.

The caf√©, a sanctuary of warmth amidst the harsh chill of the city, buzzed with life. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the laughter of friends and the soft clatter of utensils. It was during this ordinary morning that I met Laura, a woman whose presence felt like an embrace. Her soft voice and warm smile instantly put me at ease, and we struck up a conversation that would unravel the complexities of her existence.

As we shared our stories, Laura revealed her identity as an empath‚Äîsomeone who not only felt the emotions of others but also absorbed them like a sponge. She described her childhood, marked by an acute sensitivity that often left her overwhelmed in crowded spaces. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like I can see into people‚Äôs souls,‚Äù she said, her eyes wide with both wonder and sorrow. ‚ÄúBut sometimes, their pain becomes my own.‚Äù I found myself captivated by her narrative, drawn into the depth of her emotional landscape.

Yet, as our conversation deepened, I sensed an undercurrent of caution in her words. Laura spoke of relationships that had soured, of friends who had taken advantage of her boundless compassion, and of the emotional exhaustion that often left her isolated. ‚ÄúPeople think being an empath is a gift,‚Äù she mused, her brow furrowing. ‚ÄúBut it can feel like a curse when you‚Äôre constantly absorbing negativity. It can make you untrusting, even paranoid.‚Äù 

This revelation struck a chord within me. I had always viewed empaths as gentle souls, but here was a woman who reflected the darker aspects of her sensitivity. Her ability to empathize not only allowed her to connect with others but also left her vulnerable to manipulation and emotional harm. I began to wonder: could this vulnerability transform into a kind of danger?

My curiosity compelled me to dig deeper into Laura‚Äôs world. Over the following weeks, I began to observe her interactions with others. She was magnetic, drawing people in with her kindness and understanding. Yet, in private moments, I witnessed her grappling with the emotional aftermath of these encounters‚Äîbattling anxiety and self-doubt as she processed the turmoil she had absorbed from those around her. 

One evening, as we walked through Central Park, Laura shared a haunting experience that illuminated the complexities of her nature. A friend had confided in her about a personal tragedy, and Laura, ever the compassionate listener, had become engulfed in the weight of that sorrow. ‚ÄúI felt like I was drowning in her despair,‚Äù she confessed, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúAnd in that moment, I realized I wasn‚Äôt just a passive observer; I was a vessel for her pain.‚Äù 

The duality of Laura‚Äôs existence became increasingly apparent. On one hand, her empathy allowed her to forge deep connections and offer solace to those in distress. On the other, it rendered her susceptible to emotional contagion, leading to a kind of psychic depletion that, if left unchecked, could manifest into defensive behaviors‚Äîwithdrawal, distrust, and even resentment. I began to comprehend how an empath could become a danger, not through malice but through the very nature of their compassion.

As I reflected on my time with Laura, I realized that the potential for danger lay not in the empaths themselves, but in the societal structures that often fail to protect them. In a world that prizes self-sufficiency and emotional stoicism, empaths can be left to navigate their emotional labyrinth alone, often leading to a fa√ßade of normalcy that conceals their struggle. Their capacity for empathy becomes a double-edged sword, a balancing act between connection and self-preservation.

In the weeks that followed, I observed that Laura, though still grappling with her sensitivity, began to establish boundaries‚Äîan act of self-care that transformed her interactions. She learned to discern when to engage and when to step back, a skill that empowered her to protect her emotional well-being while still offering support to others. Through this journey, I understood that the true danger of empaths lies not in their nature, but in the lack of understanding and support they often encounter.

As I left the caf√© that last day, I carried with me the weight of our conversations. Empaths, I realized, are not merely passive recipients of the emotions around them; they are active participants in a complex emotional dance. Their ability to feel deeply can lead to profound connections and healing, but it can also draw them into a darker realm of emotional turmoil and isolation. The key lies in fostering environments that honor their sensitivity while promoting self-awareness and self-care.

In the end, empaths do not hide in plain sight to be dangerous; instead, they navigate a world that often misunderstands them. They are the intricate tapestry of humanity, woven with threads of compassion and vulnerability, capable of both great love and great pain. It is our responsibility to recognize their gifts and challenges, cultivating a society that embraces the full spectrum of the empathic experience. Thus, as we seek to understand those who walk among us, we must remember that their greatest danger may not lie within themselves, but within the structures and expectations of the world around them.",1,1736101819.0,psychologyy,0,1.0,False

In September, my husband told me he was moving out and wanted a divorce. He had been distant for a few months but every time I asked he said it was nothing. He said he wanted a divorce because we don‚Äôt agree on finances and I don‚Äôt do enough chores. He left that night, came back two days later and we talked about what we could do differently. He wanted time to think about it, after a day he said he was done. He said he didn‚Äôt want to talk about the marriage ever again, didn‚Äôt want to see me, and we could only text and maybe talk on the phone. I went along with what he wanted because I was afraid of making him mad. 

We finally met for coffee in October and he said he was still done but flirted with me. We ended up making out, he said he loved me, then he blocked me on everything. 
In December, he finally reached out and came over to talk about the separation agreement. He said he was still done. Then he initiated sex. We ended up sleeping together a bunch of times last month and had a friends with benefits arrangement. He said he wanted to end it because we both needed to move on. 
Now, he‚Äôs agreed to text and talk on the phone twice a week and meet once a month. 
I want to confront him. He‚Äôs called the shots this whole time and it‚Äôs been all about what he‚Äôs comfortable with. I‚Äôve never heard of someone hiding problems for a few months then giving up completely and refusing to ever have a conversation about it. 
I want to ask him for more contact and to at least attempt to reconcile because it doesn‚Äôt feel fair to just give up when I had no idea there was a problem in the first place. I‚Äôve been terrified to ask for that because I didn‚Äôt want to scare him off. But I figure at this point he‚Äôs already hurt me enough, the worst he can do is ghost.

Last night, my boyfriend told me he‚Äôd be done playing games with his stepdad by 10:30, but he ran late, leaving me bored by myself. When we finally played a game together, it was good but short, and it was a scary game‚Äîwhich I don‚Äôt really like. I suggested we watch a movie instead, but he only watched a little bit before turning around to be on his phone and eventually fell asleep. Which I also talked to him about because he‚Äôs always on TikTok constantly and not as present with me. It usually happens if we are pausing from doing an activity or when he wakes up then wants to show me videos i tell him no I don‚Äôt want to. 

I stayed up watching the movie until 3 AM, frustrated because his snoring kept interrupting me. I told him his snoring bothers me so I‚Äôm finding alternatives so he doesn‚Äôt always have to leave the room to go downstairs he always thinks I‚Äôm bothering him that‚Äôs not the case which I have to keep repeatedly saying. He could be talking to me and I‚Äôm engaging with him then say okay I‚Äôll stop talking because I‚Äôm bothering you like I didn‚Äôt even say that I‚Äôm in tune with the conversation. Normally, he turns on a speaker with white noise, which helps drown out his snoring, but he didn‚Äôt this time. When I tried to turn it on myself using his phone, he kept moving and wouldn‚Äôt wake up. I finally woke him, and when I asked him to turn it on, he got annoyed and told me to fix the vent first before he‚Äôd do it. After I tried and he still got up to ‚Äúfix it,‚Äù he went back to sleep and muttered, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you woke me up for?‚Äù That made me feel even worse.

This morning, his alarm woke me up (which he didn‚Äôt turn off), and the speaker was off again. He turned it on briefly but then went downstairs and left without saying where he was going or acknowledging me. 

This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve felt ignored or like I‚Äôm not a priority. I‚Äôve already told him how it bothers me to be left alone all the time, and he said he‚Äôd do better, but here we are again. I have my own place but he usually invites me over so we can spend time together. I know he usually works too till some evenings and I work from home we get off around the same time so he doesn‚Äôt mind me being over there. Usually no one is home when I‚Äôm working so it‚Äôs nice. But evenings we don‚Äôt do much it is the winter where I am and he‚Äôs iffy about going outside sometimes only for work it depends. when we have the evenings it‚Äôs not much besides him being on his phone we watch something he falls asleep. Even when the weekends come he decided to get on the game with his friends most of the night then say we can spend time I‚Äôm tired by the time he‚Äôs done especially hearing him scream most of the time and acknowledge me a little bit. I spend most of my time alone here, and when we‚Äôre together, it doesn‚Äôt feel like quality time. I‚Äôve been here for like 3 weeks but I feel we need some space especially for me to take care of my things at my place but he keeps postponing because of the snow. I don‚Äôt drive and Ubers are expensive to get me home from his place to mine. I feel complicated but not trying to be too sensitive. Some things just become annoying to where I feel I need my space till we actually spend real quality time and not just the same things every week. 

He called me since he left asking me if I want coffee I said no he said okay I‚Äôll see you when I get back. Still didn‚Äôt tell me where he was. I feel if he had things to do then just take me home instead of me being here bored I could do that at home.

I was on the bus one day and noticed this guy looking at me. When I looked back at him, he looked away quickly. We did this a few more times and I shot him a quick smile before getting off the bus. 

A week or two later, I see him again. Same routine, only this time he talks to me. He tells me he likes my sweater and I tell him his Halloween costume is really cool. We exchange our names and he gets off the bus. 

A week later I run into him on campus and we start talking. I tell him I‚Äôm really happy I ran into him again and we exchange numbers. 

I text him for a few hours while I‚Äôm working and we seemed to hit it off. 

The first date went even better. I took him to a coffee shop and we talked for a while and went back to my place to watch a movie. 

The second date was really fun but a little boring. I took him to a museum and I yapped my ass off trying to make up for it. 

He said he‚Äôd be very busy with finals over the next few weeks and I haven‚Äôt heard from him since. I texted him good luck on his finals but never got a reply. 

I really want to connect again as we met really organically and I very much want to keep that. I think about him all the time and I want to text him again but I keep talking myself down.

1hudham,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1hudham/help_on_chatting_with_someone_who_isnt_that/,"Help on chatting with someone who isn""t that interactive","Hey! Like two weeks ago I matched with this girl (which on her profile said was very shy) and we've been chatting.

First days were the hardest ones since I have to bring topics to the table almost exclusively, also sometimes not getting the question back. I thought that she just wasn't really interested in me and was just ""replying"" (instead of holding a conversation). I kept on going since I want to push myself into being more active within a chat and things got a bit better.

She started to text longer answers and adding a few more things (but always within the same topic I put on). A week ago I asked her if she wanted to go out to drink something (coffee), which she replyed that she would like it but couldn't say yes right away because she was sick (I don't think it was an excuse, she told me about it and it was a ""fun"" conversation on how she got sick). I told her to notice me when she feels better so we could arrange our go-out/date.

After that things were a bit better and we were chatting on Instagram. Yesterday we were having a nice chat with ""faster"" replies (every 30min-1h) but the conversation was getting close to becoming a bit dry (at the moment I couldn't figure out what else to ask or bring up).

Today, she replied my messages from yesterday and it was pretty much nothing to ""work out with"". She just replied two messages in the sort of ""hahaha [something]"" and ""hahahaha you get the idea"" (I put the [something] to not translate and give a full context, too long).

Now I don't know what to do, if to pursue the conversation bringing something new (asking her stuff), to let it be a bit more dry to figure out if she would try to revive the conversation (even if it's something small, just to know if there is still certain interest), bring again the date topic (the ball was on her side of the field, I told her to tell me when she was feeling better to go out) or to just let it go.

Sorry for the long text but I like to bring as much context in case someone is willing to put their perspective into my situation. Any help/opinion works!",1,1736101562.0,socialskills,2,1.0,False

Looking into buying an Oracle machine. However, it bothers me that their coffee/grind dosage is so high, because I don't want to replicate amphetamine effects with the caffeine. So I did some calculations with ChatGPT. Made some very fair assumptions as well:

* Arabica beans
* 1.2% caffeine content in these beans (average)
* Caffeine extracted around 85%

Because the Oracle machines are set at around 22g for a double shot, you'll have a drink of around 200mg caffeine. Recommendation for caffeine intake is not to go above 400mg a day. Let a lone for people who are very sensitive to caffeine content.

I read a lot of people complaining about the single dose shot quality, so you'll be taking a double shot basically everytime, right?

Maybe it's valuable information for some, especially coming from simpler machines like a Philips machine, or Nespresso, which contain even less than half of the caffeine content. If somebody is used to a Nespresso cup of espresso, it would be as if they took 3 to 4 shots at once with an Oracle.

I wonder Why Breville/Sage doesn't make a feature in their most expensive machines to adjust the dosage. Such a shame. Messing with the tamper screw for a \~1g of difference isn't going to cut it. For me I think it's unfortunately gonna be a deal breaker.

For ADHD, I tried Wellbutrin for anxiety but it didn‚Äôt help.

My therapist helped me realize that many of my anxiety feelings are ADHD-related: emotional dysregulation, overstimulation, and decision paralysis. So I wonder if I‚Äôm not there yet?

Either way, my anxiety has never fully gone away, feel like I have a high baseline anxiety. Meditation hasn‚Äôt stuck, exercise is regular but inconsistent, and sleep hygiene is decent but also inconsistent. (Related: I have one coffee and one tea daily.)

Between ADHD, anxiety, and sleep, I‚Äôm not functioning well but unsure how to proceed. My doctor availed the possibility of anxiety medication but hasn‚Äôt made a decision. I‚Äôm open to changing ADHD medication or adding anxiety medication to my habits, supports, and therapy.

Bizarre UFO Incident in Minnesota Small Town","https://preview.redd.it/e5p94xbow7be1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9313d0b24f8a16ae288396df0ae51abaabdb5c75

KEN KORCZAKThis is a true mind-bending story of a Minnesota man who piloted a UFO across space- time.So, I noticed that the Dean of Ufology, Grant Cameron, has been focusing for some time on a rare and peculiar aspect of the UFO experience.It is abductees, contactees‚Äô and/or sundry experiencers who report that ‚ÄúThe Others‚Äù sometimes encourage or even insist that people try their hand at piloting a UFO. In all cases, this is accomplished by the melding of the mind of the person with the consciousness of the UFO itself.Cameron explores this phenomenon in-depth in his new book, UFO Sky Pilots. In it, he shares the reports of ten experiencers, folks from all occupations, who have been granted the extraordinary privilege of flying a UFO. As it turns out, the greater implications that fall out of this scenario are far more profound and wide-ranging than you might imagine.Kvande relates his lifetime of UFO and alien interaction in his book, they are two long-time Minnesota MUFON top investigators, Bill McNeff, and Craig R. Lang. Both McNeff and Lang said they consider Roger Kvande among the most credible UFO experiencers they have interviewed out of hundreds investigated over many years. Prolific and bestselling British author Nick Redfern judged Kvande to be a ‚Äúpar excellence‚Äù example of a UFO phenomenon experiencer.I have also had some communication with Mr. Kvande as well. I can tell you that he is not fake. In fact, he has enjoyed a decades-long and successful career in the electronics-computer sector. Before he retired, he was the Senior Scientific Programmer at Unisys, IBM in Rochester, MN. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial electronics at Bemidji State University. His skills have been in much demand over the years. He has worked for many of the biggest names in the industry.Grant Cameron notes in his book that, among all the UFO pilot experiencers he has interviewed, most say they flew the craft only once.In Kvande‚Äôs case, however, he has ‚Äúflown the ship‚Äù multiple times. He began piloting a UFO from the time he was a child and into adulthood. Indeed, he developed an intensely personal relationship with a UFO he came to call simply, ‚ÄúShip.‚Äù Kvande describes Ship as an A.I. with its own intelligence. In some respects, Ship is like Amazon‚Äôs ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù or Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúSiri,‚Äù except a million times wiser, more knowledgeable, and more powerful. Ship is ever ready to answer Kvande‚Äôs questions and offer advice. For example, as Kvande was flying over the super-flat plains of the Red River Valley of northern Minnesota-Dakota, he casually wondered why the landscape was so flat.Ship read his mind and instantly flooded his consciousness with a geological history lesson dating back to the last Ice Age. It showed him how various earth forces acted over thousands of years to create the pool table terrain of northeast North Dakota, northwest Minnesota, and southern Manitoba. But Kvande also said this downloaded history lesson quickly became overwhelming. The amount of information poured into his mind was voluminous to the point of disorientation.In Cameron‚Äôs book, most of the UFO pilots report flights into space, to other planets or sometimes to points on planet Earth, but in Kvande‚Äôs case, Ship can take him not only to the far corners of the universe but backward and forward through time. Furthermore, Ship can assist Kvande in interacting with his past lives and future lives as in reincarnation-type scenarios. Ship is a source of predictive information as well, such as showing or warning Kvande of possible future catastrophic events. In one instance, for example, Ship shows Kvande a future day in which a supernova is blazing menacingly in Earth‚Äôs sky. ‚ÄúMY COMMUNICATION WITH MR. KVANDE‚ÄùAfter I published a book review of Extraterrestrial Odyssey in 2017, Roger Kvande reached out to me to thank me for my positive comments. We then further engaged in a short dialogue after that. He provided me with some additional fascinating information about Ship.‚ÄúWhen I flew Ship, I was within the body of the beast being fed oxygen, food I was protected,‚Äù Kvande said. Ship was designed to find a newly forming solar system and then help planets develop their environments.It assists in life cycles that produce planets that hold water and can nurture new life. ‚ÄúWHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF IT?‚ÄùI realize that many who read this, even UFO proponents, will find their belief systems stressed to breaking point by Kvande‚Äôs story. What helps his case, however, is that many witnesses, without a doubt witnessed what was certainly a significant and spectacular UFO event that occurred in Bagley in April of 1966. At the time, the story received some national attention.For example, the Bagley incident was reported in Flying Saucers, a Chicago-based magazine edited by the once-famous Raymond A. Palmer. A significant and influential figure in the field of science fiction, Palmer was the former long-time editor of the pulp science fiction magazine, Amazing Stories.Raymond Palmer also was a co-founder of FATE magazine, at one time the largest circulation paranormal-topic magazine of its kind in the world. FATE is still published today. Anyway, Ray Palmer placed this blurb in the March 1967 issue of Flying Saucers magazine (which he also created and edited):April 22, 1966, Bagley (Minnesota) Several people were said to have observed an object fly at low altitude and land outside Bagley. Four dwarfs seemed to make repairs, then the craft flew away.(Note: Kvande said that there were four gray aliens with him inside the UFO during his flying adventures).Still, many of you might be saying: ‚ÄúYou know, Ken, a blurb in a low-circulation UFO mag from the 1960s is not much to hang your hat on.‚ÄùWell, there is a lot more information to suggest that the 1966 Bagley UFO flyover really happened.This, in addition to the considerable recorded public record notations and the embedded lore of the April 1966 UFO event in Bagley, Minnesota, make this one of the most interesting cases in ufology. I return now to Minnesota MUFON investigators Bill McNeff and Craig Lang. They report a conversation with a certain Art Sampsel of Bunker Hill, Indiana.Mr. Sampsel said that a friend of his was in the tiny town of Goodridge, Minnesota, attending a farm sale. Goodridge is about fifty miles from Bagley. At the farm sale, Mr. Sampsel‚Äôs friend reports that he overheard two local farmers from Bagley discussing the April 1966 UFO storming of Main Street.They described the event as Roger Kvande said it happened, including the fact that the school bus, nearly collided with it before landing ‚Äúon the outskirts of town.‚Äù The two Bagley farmers added that the ‚Äúentire town was in a panic.‚Äù Finally, I can tell you this, as a NW Minnesota resident, have traveled through and stopped for a time on many occasions in the town of Bagley over the years. My brother lives in the nearby city of Bemidji. On one trip, back in the 1990s, I stopped at a convenience store gas station that was also a bait shop and there I overheard a conversation by some local elderly guys spending time together and drinking coffee. They were discussing the very same story as presented by Mr. Sampsel‚Äôs friend at the Goodridge farm sale, and the details of the bait shop guys were identical.I was delighted to have contributed a chapter to Roger Kvande‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Hive Mind‚Äù written with Minnesota MUFON directors Bill McNeff & Craig Lang. A UFO encounter story with ‚Äúextreme high strangeness.‚ÄùKEN

I have ready a lot of older posts to try to not create a dup. Apologies if this is the wrong format or redundant.

  
I got a Breville Bambino recently and I have been loving it. Using a dual-wall basket with expired beans - probably making some horrendous shots I'd be too ashamed to post, but I actually like what I make (I am adding milk most of the time anyway) and get happy whenever I adjust one of the factors and it tastes better.

  
Anyway, I knew I needed a ""burr mill"" grinder but just spent a bunch of money on a machine so I went and got [Bodum Bistro Conical Burr Electric Coffee Grinder Black](https://www.target.com/p/bodum-bistro-conical-burr-electric-coffee-grinder-black/-/A-91920642) from Target.

Again, I'm sure specialist things like grinding consistency, minuteness settings, etc. - it's horrible, but it works quite nice for me. The only annoying thing is, the container does not fit snugly under the outlet so some grounds always sit on the top, and then it's not really easy to pour the beans into the portafilter - so it's easy for ground to spill which is annoying and messes up my measurements.

In terms of quality, the Kingrinder K2 - despite being cheap - seems like it would last me for a *very* long time on the ""specialist"" front and be way better than what I have for a small price increase. But to be honest, my main concern right now is just easily getting the coffee beans into my portafilter. I don't mind spending a minute to manually grind, especially if it means I get a better quality result. Those automatic ones that dispense right into the portafilter are so cool but they're all too expensive.

So yeah, huge amount of maybe-relevant context but **TLDR**, can I just put a 54 mm portafilter on ground container from a Kingrinder and dump it upside down to transfer the grounds without spilling?

I‚Äôm 31 (M), and my wife is 30 (F). We got married this summer after being together for eight years. During our engagement, we rented out our flat to a younger male roommate (24 M) to save money for the wedding. At first, I didn‚Äôt think much of it, but their friendship grew deeper over time. My wife is very emotional, while I struggle to open up to her because I don‚Äôt feel fully accepted by her. Over time, this guy began opening up to her, and their relationship became very deep and emotional. She confided in him about her struggles, and he provided her with understanding and support, and vice versa.

Subconsciously, I felt emotionally betrayed. I didn‚Äôt realize my anger was growing, but eventually, fights started becoming more frequent. I would get upset more easily (though I never resorted to anything beyond shouting). I felt alone, like I was planning the wedding by myself. I spent hours organizing and fixing things while she sat in the living room chatting with this guy about life. Our arguments often revolved around wedding preparations. I admit my patience with her was at its lowest, leading me to make many decisions on my own (though I always asked for her approval). Here she felt a lot her boundaries were broken‚Ä¶

Fast forward to the wedding‚Äîit was amazing. We were both happy with how it turned out, and our guests were impressed and surprised by the event.

However, right after the wedding, things started to fall apart. While I felt happy, my wife seemed distant and exhausted. We had a major fight, during which she told me she felt neglected and hurt during the wedding preparations. She said I crossed her boundaries and demanded time to forgive me. I apologized immediately and wanted to make things right, but the situation only got worse. She started spending hours talking to our roommate and completely ignoring me. I felt heartbroken. I cried almost every night and began experiencing panic attacks for the first time in my life.

Eventually, I asked her if we could have the roommate move out. I sent him a polite message, but he was upset that I didn‚Äôt discuss it face-to-face. My wife wasn‚Äôt happy either, as she saw him as a source of comfort. Despite this, he moved out.

We started couples therapy, where I was able to express my feelings of betrayal. Unfortunately, this didn‚Äôt seem to help. She remained emotionally distant from me, although she maintained contact with the roommate after he left our house. This drove me into a spiral of doubt and insecurity. In my desperation, I looked through her Facebook messages (which I know was wrong).

When she found out, she was furious. Three months after the wedding, she told me she wanted to break up. She said I would never be a good father to her future children because of my behavior. I begged her to reconsider and suggested we take some time apart.

Now, here we are. She moved out three months after the wedding, leaving me alone in the house we bought together. For two months, I gave her space and didn‚Äôt contact her. After eight weeks of no contact, I sent her a message explaining how I felt betrayed. We agreed to meet for coffee.

During the meeting, she dropped a bombshell‚Äîshe revealed that she has developed a fear of me. She said she can‚Äôt be alone with me, let alone move back in. She‚Äôs afraid I might harm her. This fear apparently began after she discovered I had looked through her Facebook messages. Major boundary was broken. During our conversation, I confessed that I‚Äôd been angry and hurt. When I mentioned that i have truly not let my anger go, and if i let my anger‚Ä¶she asked, ‚Äúyou would Kill me?‚Äù

I was horrified. ‚ÄúKill you? Are you out of your m by mind?‚Äù I responded, disgusted. ‚ÄúNo, I meant leave you.‚Äù

She has refused to meet me before April‚Äîthree months from now. She insists on only meeting in public places and not being alone with me. I am utterly confused about how we got here. She says her trust is completely shattered, but during our last meeting, she was kind and admitted she still has feelings for me. However, she seemed hypervigilant the entire time.

I have never been violent or threatened her with physical harm. I know I crossed boundaries by checking her social media, but being terrified of me, like I would physically harm her, feels like a massive overreaction.
 She also said that there is nothing romantically going on between her and her new friend, i felt like she emotionally cheated, she said she was in ‚Äúsurvival mode‚Äù‚Ä¶.

I'd also like, if possible to code of course, to be able to move things such as navigation, the computer and the codex. Maybe even the other things such as the arcane menu and the market to be able to clear off that big table a bit more.

Some info about me: 28M, 5'3, single, working professional from Marikina but lives alone in Taguig for work. I rarely go home to Marikina now unless I have something to do na mas convenient if dun ako galing. I have many friends from redditand I've been a part of a few small groups since I started doing this last August 2024 but idk, I haven't found my super constants because while they're alright, parang masyadong mataas yung energy ko and I want things to go little bit faster and more consistent. I also want yung more active or more effort in trying to be active, or even yung may plans or wants to make a plan palang to be active. Marami akong ganap lagi which I set lang personally and marami sa mga yun are outside activities such as:

- Cycling (my primary sport and hobby)
- Running (I enjoy it more than cycling kapag may kachika, kapag wala i don't enjoy it as much)
- Hiking (di talaga ako super mahilig pero g lang naman ako. A plus kapag may other activities during hikes)

I play badminton and mejo naglalaro din ng table tennis. Di naman ako competitive. I just play for fun. I might sound mayabang kapag nagkkwento ako about my activities but I like talking about things I do na I consider as achievements. Pinaghirapan ko yun eh. I also understand na everyone had to start somewhere, so if you want some help or to try these things na ginagawa ko na, don't be afraid to ask; basta G ka, I am very much willing to assist in any way I can. 

I don't go to the gym kasi I get bored easily and I'd really rather do the things I listed above. 


Teka teka, baka naman sabihin mo ""parang nakakapagod naman 'tong taong 'to."" Well maybe, pero 'di naman palagi hahahahaah

Very madaldal man ako lalo na kapag I can relate pero I can just listen din naman. Chill coffee or chill drinking ay okay lang naman sakin. Chill hangouts, kahit ano pang chill stuff yan. We can have slow days. Museums? Road trip para lang makakita ng magandang tanawin? Swimming trips? Spas? Go!

Some plans I already have that you might be interested to join me:

Hoka Trilogy Run
Audax
Wall climbing sessions
Hiking sessions
Bowling sessions
Badminton sessions

During slow and gloomy days or kapag pagod sa life in general, nananahimik rin ako hahaha but right now there isn't really anyone I have for that. I would rarely share unless I'm really comfortable, or maybe if I'm just in the mood, or if tinanong ako. Perhaps you can share first and I can just listen. Di naman ako 'masyadong' judgemental and I believe na fair ako mag-isip. 

Anyway, if you read this and I somehow get your interest, do pm! I will match your energy. Marami pa akong di nashare sa info na to so tanong ka lang. I'm chronically online and puyat.",3,1736100816.0,PhR4Friends,0,1.0,False
1hud6p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Microbiome/comments/1hud6p2/gi_mapcdiff_question/,GI Map/CDiff Question,"Hi everyone - I'm hoping anyone can give me advice because I'm so confused and so scared. I unfortunately had to take several abx this year, one of which was Levofloxacin 8 weeks ago to which I horrificly got floxed. Life has been awful since with all the severe adverse side effects (joint pain, neuropathy, CNS systems, etc.).

Through all of this, I've never had diarrhea, stomach cramps, fever, nausea or anything. Not even when I was on the antibiotics throughout the year. Only thing I've had is constipation/hard stool which I've had for years and was always managed with coffee or Metamucil.

Because of the floxing, I've been working with a functional MD to run a bunch of tests to see what we can do.

I just got my GI Map results back (from Diagnostic Solutions Lab) and it says ""CDiff Toxin A: 8.80e3 (High) / CDiff Toxin B: 4.52e3 (High)."" It also shows Candida SPP and leaky gut. The GI Map says it is a ""qPCR test.""

The functional MD prescribed S. Boullardi, berberine, fiber, colostrum, anti-microbials, 21 day elimination diet to start. I flagged how scared I am of the C.Diff and they said ""we're treating it."" Should I contact an Infectious Disease doc instead?

*TLDR:*

* Had to take several ABX this year
* Was floxed 8 weeks ago from Levofloxacin. Severe symptoms, housebound as a result
* NO diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, etc.
* Did GI Map bc of the floxing, just to see what could be going on in body
* GI Map is a qPCR from Diagnostics Solution Lab
* **RESULTS -**

I‚Äôm moving about an hour south of Sacramento from Portland, and I‚Äôd love your help getting to know the area. While I know it‚Äôs not Portland, I‚Äôm excited to explore what the Sacramento region and beyond have to offer. I‚Äôm especially looking for things that reflect some of Portland‚Äôs culture‚Äîoutdoors, art, unique experiences, and wellness!

I have a chronic illness, so I‚Äôm looking for moderate hikes or accessible nature spots. I‚Äôm also open to suggestions for things to do within a couple of hours, so feel free to share those hidden gems, too!

Some specific recommendations I‚Äôd love:
	‚Ä¢	Outdoors: Easy-to-moderate trails, scenic parks, gardens, or calm places to connect with nature.
	‚Ä¢	Art and culture: Unique galleries, live music venues, cool theaters, or quirky events and festivals.
	‚Ä¢	Bookstores: Local spots with a cozy vibe or unique selections.
	‚Ä¢	Thrift stores & quirky shopping: I love finding secondhand treasures and exploring fun, unique shops.
	‚Ä¢	Wellness: Meditation studios, breathwork classes, acupuncture, sound baths, yoga, or other healing spaces.
	‚Ä¢	Foodie finds: Vegan-friendly spots, must-visit coffee shops, or any local food experiences worth checking out.
	‚Ä¢	Can‚Äôt-miss quirky or unique activities: Anything fun, creative, or totally unexpected!

Moving from a city like Portland to a small town will definitely be an adjustment, but I‚Äôm looking forward to embracing new experiences and discovering what makes this area special. I‚Äôm hoping to find a sense of connection to the local community, uncover hidden gems, and explore the slower pace of life while still staying connected to some of the things I love, like art, nature, and unique culture.

There's an article published by The New York Times that recounts the story of a former hitman from Davao City who fled to a new country to escape his violent past. The hitman, Mr. Matobato, reflects on his experiences, including his involvement in extrajudicial killings and his life in hiding.

The article also touches on the challenges he faces in adjusting to his new life and the pursuit of justice for the crimes he committed. The narrative provides insight into the emotional and psychological impact of his past actions and the complexities of seeking redemption.
