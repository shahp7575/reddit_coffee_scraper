Disclaimers / Things not to come at me for: 

1) I'm a Maxis Match girlie.  Any Alpha I use is simply bc I can't find MM to do the same thing.  I'm still on the hunt for better MM skin details and so on.  But idk maybe I'm blind now but I'd play him in my MM save!  Anyway, idk why we come at people for Alpha CC these days anyhow, but since it's a thing... Just mentioning that it's wasted breath to advocate for MM in this case, since I'm a MM lover.  
  
2) I used presets rather than born genetics bc I want funkier looking babies lmao.  Sorry if I offend anyone with those changes.  I tried to stick with the same general vein but just wanted more ""character"" / things that were weirder.  I'm not trying to say anything is better than something else, the original just seemed lacking character to me, I want more varied looking sims.  
  
3) Similarly, eye color is fucked in my game, I have a default override hiding somewhere that makes everyone's eye color the same.  So I'm using a different eye color and idk what his original eye color was but FYI not trying to light-eye anyone in case he originally had brown / dark eyes at the start.  Might change the eyes to one of my more MM ones, but this color seemed to match his hair nicely.  
  
3) I didn't change his clothes because I don't have better MM for guys than what he has on.  Lol.  Just gave him some tattoos bc he reads as metalhead to me, bc stereotype tbh.  Idk I knew a cute moody Scandi boy growing up that was my first metalhead friend (and crush) so even though dude just works in a coffee shop and has no alt cues apart from black clothes, the long hair just sent me there straight away bc I'm lame

Need your opinions and thoughts about a situation. 
Currently, I am working FT in the healthcare industry working 3 shifts and long hours. Once i reach home, i'll mostly KO. 

Recently had a baby, of course I have to do my fair share of taking care when I reach home. 
Since i'm fairly shag after work, tried taking energy supplements and coffee, but still not resolving. 

I am considering to change job to office hours, which can help me to manage time and lesser stress in that sense. But of course every choice comes with consequences. I will need to take a paycut and limited career advancement, but i don't mind as i will be less stress and have more time with my family etc. 

Are yall family minded or career minded? ",1,1744200998.0,askSingapore,2,1.0,False

One minute, I struggled through the rush-hour chaos at Grand Central; the next, my phone was gone. A sly pickpocket had stolen it right out of my coat pocket. The panic set in immediately. That phone was my portal to everything, including access to my $315,000 Bitcoin fortune, set aside for my children's education. With my device lost, my two-factor authentication codes were out of reach, and the exchange did not have a backup recovery option. My mind raced: my children losing college educations, my careful financial planning ruined by seconds of distraction.  
I stumbled over onto a bench, cradling my briefcase in life-preserver mode. Catching my breath through tears, I was suddenly hit with sympathy from a strange,   kind old gentleman whose newspaper sported a circle of coffee spots—and who gave me a rough but hopeful-scribbled brochure. ""Tech Cyber Force Recovery pulled my brother from a terror such as you just experienced. Call them up, son."" Desperation got the better of doubt. I called in the afternoon. Their crew took to me immediately from the beginning. They sat and listened to the entire thing, every detail of how crowded the station had been to how fearful I was for my children's future. They assured me that all of this could be fixed. Their peaceful belief lifted me like a life preserver that floated me along.  
The process of recovery was as meticulous as open-heart surgery. They spoke directly to my exchange provider, coordinating time zones and levels of security. I received daily updates, always in plain human language. Even when nothing had yet changed, they would send me reassuring messages to inform me they were still fighting for me. After eight long days, the call came. My wallet was restored. Tech Cyber Force Recovery did more than recover my Bitcoin, they recovered my peace of mind and my family's future.

Bit of a background when I first met SIL we will call her Susan haha she didn’t talk much to me , I chalked it up as being shy and that’s okay slowly trying to have a conversation with her when I can .. the problem is Reddit over this past year she has been nothing but rude to me . She doesn’t view me as her brothers girlfriend at all and barely answers any questions I ask her out of being polite last summer we went on a family trip . I not being the most educated on these activity trips  ect stayed in mostly offering teas coffees and food whenever I could . It started off with her refusing to come for dinner as a family mainly because I was there but then would come 30 minutes later and eat the food we’ve bought without a please or thank you … it only went downhill from there . She would rarely talk to me and I gave her as much space as I could until one day when I offered her a coffee she said “look don’t ask me if I want anything because I’d never take it from you “ I was so sad and ran back to the room feeling devistated and my partners family had a chat with her where she stated I’m” just really annoying and we have nothing in common “ Reddit . Throughout this whole time of me and my bf being together she has never asked me one single question. So after that we rarely spoke and for this Christmas I decided to get her an expensive ish gift as I figured it may help her understand that I would like to get on with her .. only to find out from his family she never opened the present infront of them and I’m not even sure she liked it as she never spoke to me since .. I just feel hurt and sad that she can’t accept me as part of the family :( .. in my culture family is a tight nit close circle and we see eachother regularly and but I just feel I’m walking on egg shells when she’s there and feel less and less comfortable with his family when shes there . so I’m torn do I cut her off completely and give her the same energy or do I try and have an honest conversation with her about everything and see if we can mend the friendship. I don’t want this to take a toll on my partner but every time we speak about it he gets more and more angry with her so what should I do Reddit sorry for the long message :) ",3,1744200862.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I’m sorry I have a quick question. 
I’ve been doing OMAD. But I wanted to ask if someone can please advise about my eating window?

8am: Latte (soon I will try to get this to just black coffee - is there a good instant coffee for this? E. Easy to make at work)

5-6pm: One main meal

My problem (or non problem lol) is that I recently have started to have chia pudding/a Greek yogurt bowl. Just the 0% fat yogurt and some frozen fruits & maybe a small teaspoon of peanut butter or cacao powder. I find this really helps me not having sugar cravings. I also feel I get a lot of nutrients from it

Is it still considered Omad if I eat this maybe 45-60 mins after my main meal? Or is it then considered 22:2? 

Sorry if a repetitive question, I really appreciate your time for your response. Thank you ",1,1744200798.0,omad,0,1.0,False

I’ve been exploring small, intentional ways to appreciate the world around me and add a spark of beauty to my everyday routine. These ideas are super easy to try and have genuinely brought more joy to my life—I hope they can do the same for you!

**1. Create a Morning Ritual**

Starting your day with something you love, whether it’s enjoying your coffee by a sunny window, journaling, or playing your favorite playlist, sets the tone for a beautiful day.

**2. Pause to Notice Nature**

Take a moment to breathe in fresh air, admire a sunset, or listen to birdsong. It might sound simple, but giving yourself time to reconnect with nature adds so much calm and beauty to your day.

**3. Curate Your Space**

Surround yourself with things that make you happy—whether it’s fresh flowers on your desk, a candle with your favorite scent, or a cozy throw blanket for your couch. Small touches can totally elevate your space!

**4. Savor a Creative Outlet**

You don’t need to be a pro artist to introduce creativity into your life! Sketching, writing, cooking, or even trying your hand at photography can help you express yourself and find beauty in the process.

**5. Spread Kindness**

This might be my favorite! Compliment a stranger, send a thoughtful note to a friend, or donate to a cause that’s important to you. The beauty you create for others always seems to come back full circle.

Do you have any go-to rituals or habits that help you appreciate the beauty in your day-to-day? I'd love to hear how you bring that spark into your life too!

He works from home 3 to 4 days a week.
My issue is that he makes no effort to spend any time with me.
He will work all day, then we have dinner, do the childrens night routine and put them to bed. Once they are in bed he either goes to bed or games. If I ask him to spend time with me most of the time he says he would rather game, and on the few occasions he hangs out with me he makes me feel like he would rather be anywhere else.
I feel as though the entire responsibility of our relationship falls on me. If I dont make the effort or flat out ask him to spend time with me, or talk with me, or for any sort of affection, then it doesn’t happen.
I have tried to talk to him about this, and how I currently feel. He told me that we are married so I should just know that he loves me, and he works from home most of the week, so we are together all week.
Let me clarify, when he is working from home, that is exactly what he is doing. We dont see or hear from him unless he leaves his office to make a coffee during the day. He also chooses to eat lunch in his office.

I need male perspectives. What is going on here? Is he completely checked out? Am I reading to far into things?

1jv43fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Lullaby-BattleCry/comments/1jv43fe/buried_in_the_quiet/,Buried in the Quiet,"I birthed a baby and buried a version of me in the same breath.

One came out screaming, pink and sacred and needing, and the other slipped away without a sound.

Everyone said congratulations while I stood in the mirror wondering where my name had gone.

The nights are a carousel of crying and feeding and changing and burping and forgetting what day it is.

And I love her.

God, I love her.

But sometimes it feels like I was cracked open and reborn but only part of me climbed back out.

Part of me remembers the heartache that came before the rebirth...
Was it a rebirth? Or was it a death? 

No amounts of gaming or reading or drawing or writing or coloring takes the sharpness out of my chest. 
I don't even have time for some of those things. 
I don't have enough hands, or concentration, or energy.
I cannot avoid the pain. It always comes back. 

Time heals everything and I'm still waiting.

There are parts of me I miss... not just my body but the freedom, the laughter, the lightness I used to wear like a second skin. Now everything feels heavy. Even the quiet.

Especially the quiet. 

A quiet night to you? It's hell for me. 

I can't get my head above water. 

I'm drowning. And I can't ask for help. I can't even get some words of encouragement. A vote of confidence. 

Everything is gone. 

What did I do to deserve this? Was I really that awful? 

People ask how I’m doing.
I say ""we're doing good!"" 
and I smile like I’m not unraveling under the weight of being everything. 

Nobody asks how are you? How are YOU? But they always ask how's the baby? How is the baby sleeping? How is the baby eating? How's the baby?

But the baby is great... because I sacrifice everything for the baby. I sacrifice showers and brushing my teeth and brushing my hair and eating and I sacrifice basic necessities to make sure the baby is great. 

But no one asks about those things. 

My eyes shine and you may mistake it for a postpartum glow, but it's only tears I know I can't let slip. 

This season feels like standing in the middle of a crowded room while no one sees you. It feels like making dinner then having to feed the baby, only to come back and all the food is gone. 
It's washing the dishes while still hungry. It's drinking the coffee cold. It's picking up the pieces and not expecting to get the chance to put them together. 
I'm holding life in my arms but grieving in my bones.

Some days I ache for silence and some days the silence is what hurts the most.

I still show up. Because I know I'll find myself again someday. Even if I don’t recognize myself yet. Even though I may never be that person again. 

Will I? Don't answer that. This version no longer needs any reassurance... I can't afford reassurance. I can't afford to lean on anyone ever again. 

I've learned my lesson and I'm paying the price. 

That doesn't change that I still miss the girl I was before I became the whole world to someone else.

1jv40t8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jv40t8,Shop renovation - power and water,"Hi guys, so I own a shop and we have a coffee bar as you can see in the pictures. We have a current L shape bar but we want to convert it to one long coffee bar to better use our space and open up the front of our shop a bit.

Our plan is to get rid of the current section that the coffee equipment is on and to put it on the section with the long tiles all over. We would then push this right up against the window sill and bring it back a little bit to open the space. We would then build onto the end of it to extend it for the till as you can see marked in red. 

I have a couple of issues to overcome/ think about. 
Issue 1:
Power - our current power comes to the side of the machine as you can see in the images. We would need to run this power along the window sill area to have it reach the machine (it's 16a). Along with this would need some plugs for our grinder, water boiler, till and fridge underneath. None of this should be a problem on its own. This leads me to issue 2-

We also will need to run water in and waste water on this wall. Fitting these all on might be really difficult. I think I get enough of an angle on the waste water for it to come out. Our waste water has to go here (see image with blue highlights) because our drain runs that way outside into the alleyway. 

I'm struggling to know how/if/ what way to fit all this on this small sill that is only 32cm tall. I imagine. Whatever way I do it - I'll need to box it all in so it's safe from us kicking it etc. but waste will need the most space to get an angle but I need to make sure I can bring power in safely and water in.

Hope this makes sense - let me know your thoughts - I plumbed everything myself previously so I am comfortable doing it - moving power id be  comfortable doing that as well - just fitting it all in is hard to figure.

Jake’s been dealing with this brutal nerve pain for a couple years now. It started after he a crash with is cycle. He healed up okay at first, but then this stabbing, burning pain kicked in, mostly in his hand. His doc said it’s likely a neuroma scar tissue messing with the nerve endings and it’s been a nightmare ever since. He’s tried the usual stuff. Pain meds turned him into a zombie, so he ditched those. Physical therapy didn’t touch the pain, just annoyed him. Even gave a TENS unit a shot, but it was more hype than help. Now he’s at this point where he can barely grip a tool without wincing guy’s a carpenter by trade, so it’s not just pain, it’s his whole life getting sidelined. I’ve watched him go from fixing up houses to barely picking up a coffee mug, and it’s rough. I’ve been digging into options for him because he’s too burned out to keep looking. Found this site [handnervemicrosurgery.com](http://handnervemicrosurgery.com) from a surgeon in NY/NJ named Dr. Oren Michaeli who does some next-level stuff I hadn’t heard of before. They talk about Targeted Muscle Reinnervation (TMR), where they reroute the nerves to a muscle to stop the pain signals apparently big for amputees with phantom limb pain, but they say it works for chronic nerve issues too. Then there’s Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interface (RPNI), which wraps the nerve in muscle to help it regenerate and chill out. They also do nerve grafting for messed-up spots like Jake’s. What caught my eye is how specialized it is not a ton of surgeons do this, and they mentioned insurance sometimes covers it out of network because of that. We’re in NJ, so it’s close enough to consider. I’m no expert, but it sounds promising way beyond the standard “here’s a script” approach he’s gotten so far. I’d love to hear from anyone here docs, nurses, patients, whoever. Has anyone seen TMR or RPNI in action for nerve pain? Does it hold up, or is it just fancy talk?

His friends urged her to go home and rest, and she reluctantly agreed. But just as she reached the doorway, anxiety gripped her heart and pulled her back.  
  
Turning around, she witnessed the pack healer dumping all five bags of blood—her blood—straight into the garbage bin!  
  
At that moment, thunderous laughter erupted from a nearby room, so loud it could've shattered windows.  
  
""Your Sweet Luna, Aria Collins fell for our bullshit again!"" a voice howled. ""What a fucking idiot!""  
  
Aria froze, staring through the half-open door. Among the crowd, she immediately spotted him.  
  
Lucas was lounging casually against the headboard, scrolling through his iPhone, barely paying attention to his friends. Though his face was partially blocked, she could still make out his chiseled jawline and perfect features—  
  
He didn't have a single scratch on him!  
  
Aria blinked hard, convinced her distress was making her hallucinate.  
  
""Guys, let's count,"" drawled one guy she recognized as Tyler, Lucas's closed friend. ""How many times have we screwed with her now?""  
  
""The first time,"" chimed in Blake, another alpha's son from Lucas's circle, ""we told her Lucas lost the silver moon pendant he was supposedly getting her. She spent the entire night searching in a blizzard. Even with a 104-degree fever, the dumb bitch wouldn't quit.""  
  
""Remember the second time?"" Derek, Lucas's another friend, leaned forward eagerly. ""We convinced her Lucas was in a coma after a territory fight. She spent all night at the sacred grove lighting candles and sobbing to the pack elders. Got blessed water and a moonstone. Lucas poured the water out casually and gifted the moonstone to Leila Blackwood the next day!""  
  
""My personal favorite,"" smirked Josh, ""was when we framed her for challenging the lycan king's mate and nearly got her a rogue. The way she begged the pack council—pathetic! Still makes me laugh thinking about it.""  
  
""This blood donation scam makes ninety-six,"" Tyler calculated, checking something on his phone. ""Just three more pranks, and our revenge tour wraps up. Not bad for four years of entertainment. Worth every minute, right, Lucas?""  
  
Lucas barely looked up from his phone, his voice detached and bored. ""Whatever. As long as I can finally reject her and banish her from the pack after we hit ninety-nine.""  
  
""It's what she deserves,"" Blake insisted. ""Remember how she beat Leila for that position as ceremonial dancer? Leila cried for days. Nobody messes with your beloved and gets away with it.""  
  
""That's why it's been so perfect,"" Derek added. ""Pretending to accept her as your future Luna just to systematically destroy her? Pure genius, man. Too bad it's almost over. We'll need to find someone else to torture soon.""  
  
A deafening ringing filled Aria's ears, like a bomb had detonated inside her head.  
  
Her chest constricted so violently she thought she might be having a heart attack. She clutched at her sternum, doubling over to gasp for air, her lungs burning as though filled with acid.  
  
The words kept replaying in her mind like a nightmarish loop. Lucas was only mating with her for revenge. Four years of what she thought was love—just an elaborate scheme to break her.  
  
He knew exactly how desperately she loved him...  
  
Lucas Thornwood, the Alpha of The Thornwood Pack. With his predatory good looks, he could've stepped off a GQ billboard. ""One look at Lucas Thornwood and you're ruined for all other wolves""—that's what everyone said.  
  
And like a moth to flame, she'd fallen just like all the rest.  
  
Since the day she found out he was her mate, she had chased him relentlessly for three years, sacrificing every shred of her dignity, while he remained coldly indifferent—until one day, when he miraculously accepted her as his mate.  
  
She thought her persistence had finally melted his heart. Instead, it had all been a calculated game of destruction.  
  
The truth crushed her: he'd initially rejected her because his heart belonged to someone else.  
  
He only agreed to accept her later because she had beaten Leila Blackwood in that crucial moon dance competition and made his precious beloved cry.  
  
For revenge, he pretended to accept her, orchestrating ninety-nine humiliations to systematically destroy her soul piece by piece.  
  
Aria's tears streamed down uncontrollably, her throat constricting as if invisible hands were choking her.  
  
She stared at the group laughing without restraint, at Lucas's indifferent face, and suddenly felt hollowed out completely.  
  
She had given him everything—her love, her trust, her very being—only for him to crush it all beneath his Italian leather shoes and toss it away like yesterday's garbage.  
  
Just then, Josh noticed movement at the door and glanced over.  
  
Aria spun around and fled.  
  
She walked faster and faster until she was sprinting down the pack compound corridors, past startled pack members and guards.  
  
She had no destination—she just needed to escape this place, escape Lucas, escape the smoking ruins of her reality.  
  
When her legs finally gave out in some distant corner of the pack garden, she collapsed onto a bench as tears flooded from her eyes like a broken dam.  
  
She covered her face with trembling hands, her body convulsing with silent sobs that tore through her like physical pain. Each breath felt like inhaling shards of glass.  
  
God, Aria, you pathetic, gullible fool.  
  
After what seemed like hours, her mother's gentle voice reached her through the mindlink.  
  
""Aria, sweetheart, your father and I are finalizing our arrangements to move to the Northern Alpine Pack in the Northern Territory next week. The High Alpha Council has requested him to lead their howl choir before the next full moon ceremony. Are you absolutely certain you don't want to join us? They has excellent moonlight dance instructors too.""  
  
Her father, a celebrated historian of werewolf traditions, had received this prestigious appointment months ago. They had planned to relocate as a family, but Aria had delayed and made excuses repeatedly, unable to bear leaving Lucas. She'd even considered staying with The Thornwood Pack permanently, transferring her allegiance just to be near him.  
  
Now, the irony of it all cut deeper than any silver blade could.  
  
""No,"" she wiped away her tears with such force it hurt her skin. She took a deep, shuddering breath. Her voice emerged raw but unwavering, ""Mom, Dad, I'm coming with you to the Northern Alpine Pack.""  
  


Chapter 2

Her mother's excited voice immediately came through the mindlink: ""That's fantastic, sweetheart! We'll start the pack transfer ritual right away—once it's done, there's no turning back. It's a point of no return.""  
  
Her fingertips trembling, but her voice remained unshakeable: ""I won't change my mind.""  
  
Her mother was about to end the mind-link but hesitated, cautiously asking: ""What about that alpha mate of yours? Didn't you chase after him forever? I thought you were head over heels for him.""  
  
The word ""mate"" felt like a knife twisting in her chest.  
  
Aria's mind instantly flashed back to the healer's room—the cruel laughter, Lucas sprawled carelessly on the bed scrolling through social media, his friends' vicious mockery, and the devastating realization that he'd wasted three years pretending to accept her solely to execute some twisted revenge plan for Leila Blackwood.  
  
Her heart constricted so violently she could barely breathe, like someone had reached into her chest and was squeezing it with bare hands.  
  
""I'm done with him,"" she heard herself say, her voice raw but eerily steady. ""Completely done. Forever.""  
  
After the mind-link, Aria stood motionless on the sidewalk, letting the bitter wind whip through her hair. She stared up at the bleak gray sky, drew in a deep breath that burned her lungs, and turned toward what she had foolishly called ""home.""  
  
The moment she pushed open the door, the familiar scent punched her in the gut.  
  
Aria froze in the entryway, staring at the living room she knew so well, feeling like she was trapped in someone else's nightmare.  
  
This was Lucas's den—the one he'd casually invited her to share after accepting her.  
  
That day, he had leaned against the doorframe with that trademark smirk and shrugged: ""Wanna move in?""  
  
Back then, she'd blushed like an idiot, heart soaring with joy, believing it was the beginning of their bond rather than what it actually was—convenient access for his ongoing psychological torture campaign.  
  
She had spent countless nights lying beside him, dreaming about their future mating ceremony, picturing their cubs running around, fantasizing about growing old together in this space.  
  
Now those memories were like wolfsbane in her veins.  
  
Moving in together? Just another calculated move to maximize her pain when the final blow came.  
  
She couldn't comprehend the depths of his obsession with Leila—to waste three years of his life with someone he despised, to let her sleep in his den, to run with her during full moons night after night...  
  
All to build the perfect illusion before destroying her completely.  
  
For the next three days, Aria didn't contact Lucas.  
  
She locked herself in the den and systematically purged every trace of him from her life.  
  
She found the journal where she'd documented her pathetic crush—a thick, worn notebook with every page filled with lovestruck ramblings.  
  
""OMG saw Lucas in the pack borders today!!! Charcoal V-neck + those black jeans = DYING. Had to pretend to patrol because I couldn't stop staring!""  
  
""HE ACTUALLY SPOKE TO ME TODAY!!! Just asked me to pass his coffee but I swear our fingers touched and there was a MOMENT. Haven't washed my hand yet lol.""  
  
""I CANNOT BELIEVE IT. He said YES. ME. Lucas Thornwood is letting ME into his pack. Is this real life?? I'm literally shaking writing this!!!""  
  
Aria flipped through page after cringe-worthy page, tears streaming down her face, each drop burning like fire.  
  
She threw the journal into a garbage bag with such force it tore through the plastic, her hands shaking with anger—at him, but mostly at herself.  
  
Next came the gifts she'd spent thousands on—  
  
The silver wolf pendant she'd saved three months for. The limited-edition ceremonial knife she'd stood in line overnight to purchase. The leather jacket that cost more than her rent. Each item representing months of sacrifice and planning on her part, probably tossed in a drawer and forgotten on his.  
  
Finally, the dozens of photos she'd secretly taken and printed of him.  
  
Pictures of Lucas giving speeches at pack gatherings, dominating the training grounds, holding court in hallways surrounded by admirers—each one had once made her heart flutter like a trapped bird.  
  
She dumped everything into the trash, methodically erasing every physical reminder of her former delusion.  
  
By the evening of the third day, Aria had finally purged the last item.  
  
Standing in the center of the now-barren living room, she felt a strange lightness wash over her, like shedding a skin that had grown too tight.  
  
Just then, the front door swung open and Lucas walked in.  
  
His eyes narrowed as he surveyed the noticeably emptier space. ""What the hell did you throw out?"" His tone was sharp, demanding.  
  
Aria looked up, meeting his gaze without flinching: ""Nothing important. Just garbage I should've gotten rid of years ago.""  
  
Lucas stepped closer, irritation evident in his voice: ""I was at the pack healer's after a serious territory dispute. Where were you?""  
  
Aria's lips curved into a hollow smile, her voice ice-cold: ""You're walking around just fine, aren't you? Guess it wasn't that serious after all.""  
  
Lucas froze, clearly caught off guard by her tone. He recovered quickly, softening his approach: ""I heard you donated blood for me. I was worried about you, so I came to check.""

Naalala ko nung umaalis ako sabi ko mag coffee lang ako, patago pa tong mama ko nag tatanong ng details sa ate ko while wala ako? Like BRUH? HINDI PA BA ENOUGH SINABI KO? grabe lang. Kaya ko mas natututo hindi nalang magsabi kasi lagi nalang negative, walang tiwala, nakakapagod na.

25 na ako, pwede ako lumayas sa bahay If I want, pero I chose to stay kasi pinapakain ko rin sila. It hurts me lang na at my age, I have to adjust dahil anxious sila e adult naman na ko. 

I feel like I missed a lot of things in life just because they didn't let me choose to do things what I want, even having friends. Babae na mga kaibigan ko, hinuhusgahan pa nila. I remember grade 7 lang ako non, may madaldal ako na friend na babae, sobrang ayaw ng mama ko makipag friend don dahil madaldal daw bad influence daw. Like bro? Grade 7 palang kamo lahat???

Marami instances napaka judgemental nila sa mga tao around me na as if bad influence na agad automatic. Kaya nag karoon ako ng anxiety sa tao because of it and nabully ako because of it. 

Sobrang hirap at bigat sakin na magsabi lang kasi parang may gagawin akong kasalanan pag di nila gusto yung sasabihin ko or gagawin ko, yun ang always kong nafefeel. Nagsabi na ko pero at least nga nagsabi compared sa iba na hindi na e.

After trying a natural Catimor from Yunnan [by Lucid](https://www.lucidcoffeeroasters.com/products/china-fuyan-filter) that totally surprised me - and then hearing a friend rave about another one from Pascal - I got intrigued.

Turns out Yunnan’s coffee scene has come a long way. The region started out producing mostly low-grade Robusta for export, but in the ’90s, farmers began shifting toward higher-quality Arabica, especially Catimor. Most of the coffee still goes to large commercial buyers (Nestlé being a big one), but smallholders and co-ops focused on quality are on the rise. Specialty coffee now makes up over 30% of Yunnan’s output - up from just 8% in 2021!

Catimor is still the dominant variety, but when grown at higher elevations and processed with care, it’s clearly capable of more complexity than it gets credit for. I’ve only tried the one by Lucid so far, but it caught me off guard - clean, balanced, and not at all what I expected from either the process or the variety.

Anyone else had Yunnan coffees that stood out? Would love to hear your recs - seems like there’s something genuinely exciting happening there.",1,1744199664.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

It's my first playthrough btw :) I'm currently on winter, year 2.

I've been to skull cavern only about two times and got to floor 30 and 50. Tbh I didn't prepare a lot because I wanted to hoard my most valuable resources (rocket candy, other food, bombs, staircases) for my ""ultimate run to get to floor 100"". I just wanted to get a little bit of  Iridium and got about 6 bars. I rebuilt the ship and made one crystallarium with the other one. 

Then the wizard asked for a Iridium bar so I decided to jump in for a bit again. But again, only for casual Iridium farming.

The single thing that was important for me was a very lucky day. In the morning, I checked the TV and packed my things, this time I also brought 18 staircases, coffee and cheese with me. I then took the cart to the mines to buy about 25 cherry and 25 normal bombs. 

I used a desert totem and was there only at about 7am. That usually would be considered too late! 
I went in and got sooo many holes which always took me abot 6-8 floors deeper! 

The first amazing thing happened on floor 32. My first ever treasure chest!! And guess what? An autopetter! Then I got to a dino level but didn't want to use my staircases, so I fought. I got 3!!! different artifacts AND A DINO EGG!!
The holes kept going and I was at level 70 at 19:00. 
I didn't have any bombs left but I decided to try to get to 100 spontaneously for the first time. With crafted bombs, more holes and and my staircases I actually made it without even planning for it. And I brought back about 110 Iridium ore :)

I just had a speed buff active, so I was amazed how lucky I've been! With better planning, I could've gone deeper but I'm happy with how it went!! :)

And funny enough, the next two days were also very lucky days haha. But I didn't get in again, maybe I should've! ",7,1744199631.0,StardewValley,1,1.0,False

""Are you still with me?""

For a second, I forget I have a throat. I don't remember how to respond, let alone make a sound anymore.

I'm not sure I feel anything anymore.

""I can't open my eyes,"" I somehow mumble. I think I can remember how to feel my lips.

""Commander, your eyes are open,"" Sol replies. He's still here. I guess he has nowhere else to go. I want to laugh but-

""I don't see anything, Sol. There's nothing.""

""Oh dear. Commander. Where are you right now?"" Sol asks me. He, er, IT has no right asking. Come on.

It's still so dark here. Why won't my eyes open? I think I'm blinking. I might be sleeping though. Something with the force of a thousand suns flickers in the corner. It's red? Oh no.

No, no, no, no, no. This isn't real. I feel everything again. The crushing vast emptiness is still here. I'm still here. I am still dead. Suddenly, of course, I can remember how to breathe again. I guess I've been breathing this whole time. I remember how it feels to breathe. How it feels to have my lips dry as I smell this disgusting recycled air.

""Sol, how long has it been?"" I already know the answer.

""It's been three days, Commander."" Sol replies in his focus-group dedicated tone. He's always so friendly. But aren't all assistants like that?

""Right,"" I reply. I take a long breath as I realize my eyes were open the entire time. There's just nothing to see, except for the dull lights in the bottom of my vision.

You would think I'd see more stars. I know they're there. My best buddy, Sol, told me they were there. I'm pretty sure he can see them artificially but it's really bugging me how dark it is.

So. I've been floating in space for 72 hours. 72 hours without a solid meal. 72 hours without coffee. 72 hours of drinking atomically created water. At least that sounds cool, but it's still just recycled water I'm expelling one way or another. It still drains the oxygen and hydrogen reserves to compensate. Draining what's left of my breathing air and power for good measure. Slowly, of course. It's only been three days. I'm trying not to dwell on it but the days ahead are what really scare me.

That's the thing. See on a short space walk I don't even notice. These things are so scarily efficient you barely even need the bland water. Don't dwell on it. It's not that bad, right? I mean, sure, flavor comes from all the weird minerals stuff that water absorbs on Earth… Can't dwell on it. Can't dwell on it.

I hate this fucking water. I'd kill for a coffee, and even that's not my favorite drink.

""Sol, is there still that nebula full of alcohol?""

""Are you referring to nebulae that consist of ethanol?""

""Can I drink it?""

""In small quantities, ethanol can be consumed by humans but it is toxic in larger amounts. It's worth noting that the ethanol in those nebulae exist as floating molecules. This would make it impossible to consume orally and would only be inhaled. Further to this, inhalation of ethanol can be extremely damaging to your respiratory system. Gathering said molecules would also pose a challenge in your current situation,"" Sol replies like an asshole.

""Of course.""

""I understand that you are going through a difficult time. I hope you know that I'm here to provide the necessary moral, emotional and inspirational -""

""Sol, stop talking.""

Sol stops talking. I'm sure he'll butt back in soon.

I can't help but roll my eyes and sigh. I want him to notice. I want him to read the variations of my vital signs to acknowledge and document my frustration with the entire process. If anyone else was around, they'd probably think I'm being overly dramatic. Now I feel bad though. It's stupid, but I feel bad. It's not his fault he's just some glorified word-predictor.

""Sol, I'm sorry.""

""It's quite alright, Commander. There's no need to apologize. I understand the severity of your situation.""

Now I feel stupid for feeling bad. How could he understand the situation? I'm moving through space at a speed I can't even feel. To be fair, I don't know if I'm actually moving. I could be still right now.

If I live long enough, I'll probably eventually fall into orbit around some star. Probably the Sun. More than likely, it would be long, long after I'm dead. Probably wouldn't even be a star. Planetoid or ice ball is likely. I should be seeing Jupiter somewhere around here. I don't know why I'm not. I know I should also see part of that beautiful Sun at least on my back.

To be fair, it's not completely dark out here. There's lights, of course. Farther away than I can fathom. The bright ones are more than likely planets and even those are barely visible.

Now I have to accept the real issue. The real problem.

Space. I've spent hours in school learning about space. I've spent years imaging I was in space. As a kid, I'd imagine spaceships approaching each other like two boats, face to face. Space is multi-directional. I learned it. The first time I experienced was much different.

Which brings me here. Those pale dots were higher in my field of vision than they are now. I can only assume that means I'm moving up too fast in a relative sense. I have to remember to ask why I'm not dead.

The planets are all aligned on the same ecliptic orbit around the Sun. They all use the same plane. The same one that I'm moving up and away from. I think there's at least three of my old professors who would scoff at that. There is no up in space. Or down. But hey, I guess everything at least moves in a curve. No, that doesn’t sound right.

I'm still betting on an alien race finding me. That would make a cool story. Humans from the future could save me too. They'd probably want someone who wouldn't be missing. I'd end up in a zoo, living with other time displaced rogues while the future gawks and laughs at us.

I wonder what time it is. No, I'm not going to ask that. It's going to depress me.

I could also just open the menu screen, pop it up on the glass faceplate. Check how much breathing air I have left in this suit, power, whatever else they got to warn me about. I have a better idea. I'm going to run from my problems. Rather, I'll just zoom through space.

It smells in here.

I used to love putting on a suit. Even when we stayed inside. It felt cool. Maybe I got here just because I wanted to wear something like this. It's fitting that I'll die like this.

""Sol, how did I get here?""

""Are you experiencing any memory loss?"" Sol asks. A real one.

""I don't remember if I am, but if I was, I'd probably forget to tell you.""

""That's a good one, Commander! I'm glad to see you are keeping in high spirits,"" Sol says without a hint irony.

I kind of chuckle. High spirits. What's higher than space?

No, that's not funny. That's stupid. This is stupid. I blink hard. Are my eyes open or not? I look down and make eye contact with a tiny red dot. It makes the necessary connection with my eyes and face, and whatever else it caught from me, and opens a virtual menu on my view glass.

It's a huge menu, built with submenus and colorful graphs. Looks like I still have enough oxygen for… too long. How am I still at 80%? Power is still at 90%. Great, I'll still be warm when I die. It'll give all the remaining bacteria a real feast. Why is this so efficient? Who builds this shit?

I shouldn't look but I'm doing it anyway. Yep. No signal. Not getting anything.

No messages. No pings. No signals. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

I think there's random bits of subatomic particles coming and going at least. They aren't sending messages though.

I make a subtle gesture and the menu follows my eyes and disappears. I'll still check it later, though.

My chest is fighting me, churning itself up and down. Up and down, my heart wants to escape. My lungs struggle to keep up with their shallow breaths. I need to focus. The suit's system makes a chirp, warning me that I'm increasing the CO2 levels. Come on, it can't even be that much and I know it'll scrub it out.

I close my eyes and take four tiny breaths, then I exhale hard. I repeat. My heart doesn't stop the pounding. It thuds harder. It reminds me of all the horror.

How did I get here? I remember. But, how did I actually get here? I open my mouth to scream but I don't. I just stare out into the dark abyss. If I stare long enough, I'll eventually see hallucinations. It's only natural, it's so boring out here.

But really, how did I get here? Why is it so stupid? Did it even mean anything? I can't dwell on it. I need to clear my mind.

""Sol, can you tell me a story?""

""Of course, Commander. What kind of story would you like?"" Sol asks.

What do I feel like today? ""Surprise me,"" I tell Sol.",1,1744199319.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

* **Chia Seeds**: Rich in fiber, they expand in your stomach, helping you feel full.

3. Stir in 1 tbsp of chia seeds or flaxseed.

These simple additions can turn your coffee into a powerful tool for appetite control.

* **Quick Energy Boost:** MCT oil is rapidly absorbed and used for energy.
* **Supports Ketosis:** Ideal for those following a ketogenic diet.
* **Appetite Control:** Helps in reducing hunger and cravings.

How to add MCT oil to coffee:

1. Brew your favorite coffee.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of MCT oil.
3. Blend for a smooth, creamy drink.

Start with a small amount to avoid digestive issues, and gradually increase the dosage as your body adjusts.

# Spices To Enhance Coffee

Looking to boost your coffee for weight loss? Adding spices can be a great way to enhance your coffee. Spices not only add flavor but also offer health benefits. Let’s explore two effective spices: cinnamon and ginger.

# Cinnamon

Cinnamon is a popular spice that can transform your morning coffee. It contains antioxidants and has anti-inflammatory properties. Adding cinnamon to coffee can help with weight loss in several ways:

* **Boosts Metabolism:** Cinnamon helps in increasing your metabolic rate. This means you burn more calories throughout the day.
* **Controls Blood Sugar Levels:** Cinnamon can help stabilize blood sugar levels, reducing cravings and hunger pangs.
* **Improves Insulin Sensitivity:** Better insulin sensitivity means your body can manage sugar intake more effectively, aiding in weight loss.

How to add cinnamon to coffee:

MethodInstructionsSprinkleSprinkle a pinch of ground cinnamon into your brewed coffee.Cinnamon StickAdd a cinnamon stick to your coffee pot while brewing.Cinnamon SyrupUse a small amount of cinnamon syrup to sweeten your coffee naturally.

Adding cinnamon to coffee not only enhances the flavor but also contributes to weight loss. It’s easy to incorporate and offers multiple health benefits.

# Ginger

Ginger is another spice that can be added to coffee for weight loss. Known for its medicinal properties, ginger can aid in digestion and help burn fat. Here’s how ginger can benefit your weight loss journey:

* **Aids Digestion:** Ginger helps in breaking down food more efficiently, preventing bloating and improving nutrient absorption.
* **Boosts Thermogenesis:** Ginger increases the body’s heat production, helping you burn more calories.
* **Suppresses Appetite:** Ginger can help keep you full longer, reducing the urge to snack.

Incorporating ginger into your coffee routine can offer numerous health benefits. It’s a simple way to boost flavor and aid in weight loss.

# Dairy Alternatives

When trying to lose weight, what you add to your coffee can make a big difference. Traditional dairy can be high in calories and fat. Dairy alternatives offer a lighter option. They are low in calories, easy to digest, and packed with nutrients. Let’s explore two popular choices: almond milk and oat milk.

# Almond Milk

Almond milk is a popular dairy alternative for those looking to lose weight. It is low in calories and packed with nutrients. A cup of unsweetened almond milk contains only about 30-50 calories. This makes it a great choice for weight loss.

Here are some key benefits of using almond milk in your coffee:

* **Low in calories:** Helps in maintaining a calorie deficit.
* **Rich in vitamins:** Contains Vitamin E, which is good for skin health.
* **Low in sugar:** Unsweetened versions have minimal sugar content.
* **Lactose-free:** Suitable for those with lactose intolerance.

To give you a clearer picture, here’s a comparison table:

NutrientAlmond Milk (1 cup)Cow’s Milk (1 cup)Calories30-50150Sugar0-2g12gFat2.5g8gProtein1g8g

Switching to almond milk in your coffee is simple. Pour it in like regular milk. Enjoy the nutty flavor. Stay on track with your weight loss goals.

# Oat Milk

Oat milk is another excellent dairy alternative. It is made from whole oats and water. It has a creamy texture and mild taste. Oat milk is higher in calories than almond milk, but it offers other benefits.

I helped him get professional help, and he’s been on meds for over two years with no more hallucinations—but he isolates, doesn’t work, and avoids life entirely. He never texts or calls, even though I used to check on him every other day. I stopped visiting two weeks ago, and he hasn’t responded or asked about me since.

When I did visit, he’d rarely want to do anything, but I kept it low-pressure—just talking, walking, or grabbing coffee. He always said he doesn’t want to “play the game of life,” refuses to see his psychiatrist, and ignores my messages. I feel guilty for not checking in, but I’m also tired of being the only one putting in effort.

Part of me worries I’m setting a bad example—showing him it’s okay to never engage, because I’ll always show up anyway. But it also just hurts to feel like I don’t matter in this friendship.

Should I keep reaching out, or let it be?

""Are you still with me?""

For a second, I forget I have a throat. I don't remember how to respond, let alone make a sound anymore.

I'm not sure I feel anything anymore.

""I can't open my eyes,"" I somehow mumble. I think I can remember how to feel my lips.

""Commander, your eyes are open,"" Sol replies. He's still here. I guess he has nowhere else to go. I want to laugh but-

""I don't see anything, Sol. There's nothing.""

""Oh dear. Commander. Where are you right now?"" Sol asks me. He, er, IT has no right asking. Come on.

It's still so dark here. Why won't my eyes open? I think I'm blinking. I might be sleeping though. Something with the force of a thousand suns flickers in the corner. It's red? Oh no.

No, no, no, no, no. This isn't real. I feel everything again. The crushing vast emptiness is still here. I'm still here. I am still dead. Suddenly, of course, I can remember how to breathe again. I guess I've been breathing this whole time. I remember how it feels to breathe. How it feels to have my lips dry as I smell this disgusting recycled air.

""Sol, how long has it been?"" I already know the answer.

""It's been three days, Commander."" Sol replies in his focus-group dedicated tone. He's always so friendly. But aren't all assistants like that?

""Right,"" I reply. I take a long breath as I realize my eyes were open the entire time. There's just nothing to see, except for the dull lights in the bottom of my vision.

You would think I'd see more stars. I know they're there. My best buddy, Sol, told me they were there. I'm pretty sure he can see them artificially but it's really bugging me how dark it is.

So. I've been floating in space for 72 hours. 72 hours without a solid meal. 72 hours without coffee. 72 hours of drinking atomically created water. At least that sounds cool, but it's still just recycled water I'm expelling one way or another. It still drains the oxygen and hydrogen reserves to compensate. Draining what's left of my breathing air and power for good measure. Slowly, of course. It's only been three days. I'm trying not to dwell on it but the days ahead are what really scare me.

That's the thing. See on a short space walk I don't even notice. These things are so scarily efficient you barely even need the bland water. Don't dwell on it. It's not that bad, right? I mean, sure, flavor comes from all the weird minerals stuff that water absorbs on Earth… Can't dwell on it. Can't dwell on it.

I hate this fucking water. I'd kill for a coffee, and even that's not my favorite drink.

""Sol, is there still that nebula full of alcohol?""

""Are you referring to nebulae that consist of ethanol?""

""Can I drink it?""

""In small quantities, ethanol can be consumed by humans but it is toxic in larger amounts. It's worth noting that the ethanol in those nebulae exist as floating molecules. This would make it impossible to consume orally and would only be inhaled. Further to this, inhalation of ethanol can be extremely damaging to your respiratory system. Gathering said molecules would also pose a challenge in your current situation,"" Sol replies like an asshole.

""Of course.""

""I understand that you are going through a difficult time. I hope you know that I'm here to provide the necessary moral, emotional and inspirational -""

""Sol, stop talking.""

Sol stops talking. I'm sure he'll butt back in soon.

I can't help but roll my eyes and sigh. I want him to notice. I want him to read the variations of my vital signs to acknowledge and document my frustration with the entire process. If anyone else was around, they'd probably think I'm being overly dramatic. Now I feel bad though. It's stupid, but I feel bad. It's not his fault he's just some glorified word-predictor.

""Sol, I'm sorry.""

""It's quite alright, Commander. There's no need to apologize. I understand the severity of your situation.""

Now I feel stupid for feeling bad. How could he understand the situation? I'm moving through space at a speed I can't even feel. To be fair, I don't know if I'm actually moving. I could be still right now.

If I live long enough, I'll probably eventually fall into orbit around some star. Probably the Sun. More than likely, it would be long, long after I'm dead. Probably wouldn't even be a star. Planetoid or ice ball is likely. I should be seeing Jupiter somewhere around here. I don't know why I'm not. I know I should also see part of that beautiful Sun at least on my back.

To be fair, it's not completely dark out here. There's lights, of course. Farther away than I can fathom. The bright ones are more than likely planets and even those are barely visible.

Now I have to accept the real issue. The real problem.

Space. I've spent hours in school learning about space. I've spent years imaging I was in space. As a kid, I'd imagine spaceships approaching each other like two boats, face to face. Space is multi-directional. I learned it. The first time I experienced was much different.

Which brings me here. Those pale dots were higher in my field of vision than they are now. I can only assume that means I'm moving up too fast in a relative sense. I have to remember to ask why I'm not dead.

The planets are all aligned on the same ecliptic orbit around the Sun. They all use the same plane. The same one that I'm moving up and away from. I think there's at least three of my old professors who would scoff at that. There is no up in space. Or down. But hey, I guess everything at least moves in a curve. No, that doesn’t sound right.

I'm still betting on an alien race finding me. That would make a cool story. Humans from the future could save me too. They'd probably want someone who wouldn't be missing. I'd end up in a zoo, living with other time displaced rogues while the future gawks and laughs at us.

I wonder what time it is. No, I'm not going to ask that. It's going to depress me.

I could also just open the menu screen, pop it up on the glass faceplate. Check how much breathing air I have left in this suit, power, whatever else they got to warn me about. I have a better idea. I'm going to run from my problems. Rather, I'll just zoom through space.

It smells in here.

I used to love putting on a suit. Even when we stayed inside. It felt cool. Maybe I got here just because I wanted to wear something like this. It's fitting that I'll die like this.

""Sol, how did I get here?""

""Are you experiencing any memory loss?"" Sol asks. A real one.

""I don't remember if I am, but if I was, I'd probably forget to tell you.""

""That's a good one, Commander! I'm glad to see you are keeping in high spirits,"" Sol says without a hint irony.

I kind of chuckle. High spirits. What's higher than space?

No, that's not funny. That's stupid. This is stupid. I blink hard. Are my eyes open or not? I look down and make eye contact with a tiny red dot. It makes the necessary connection with my eyes and face, and whatever else it caught from me, and opens a virtual menu on my view glass.

It's a huge menu, built with submenus and colorful graphs. Looks like I still have enough oxygen for… too long. How am I still at 80%? Power is still at 90%. Great, I'll still be warm when I die. It'll give all the remaining bacteria a real feast. Why is this so efficient? Who builds this shit?

I shouldn't look but I'm doing it anyway. Yep. No signal. Not getting anything.

No messages. No pings. No signals. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

I think there's random bits of subatomic particles coming and going at least. They aren't sending messages though.

I make a subtle gesture and the menu follows my eyes and disappears. I'll still check it later, though.

My chest is fighting me, churning itself up and down. Up and down, my heart wants to escape. My lungs struggle to keep up with their shallow breaths. I need to focus. The suit's system makes a chirp, warning me that I'm increasing the CO2 levels. Come on, it can't even be that much and I know it'll scrub it out.

I close my eyes and take four tiny breaths, then I exhale hard. I repeat. My heart doesn't stop the pounding. It thuds harder. It reminds me of all the horror.

How did I get here? I remember. But, how did I actually get here? I open my mouth to scream but I don't. I just stare out into the dark abyss. If I stare long enough, I'll eventually see hallucinations. It's only natural, it's so boring out here.

But really, how did I get here? Why is it so stupid? Did it even mean anything? I can't dwell on it. I need to clear my mind.

""Sol, can you tell me a story?""

""Of course, Commander. What kind of story would you like?"" Sol asks.

I'm finding online information about how to register as self employed quite overwhelming and confusing. I know there is also different options you can set yourself up as - sole trader/Ltd company are the only ones I know, unsure if theres other options that would suit me best or if it's one of those two. I'm looking for advice on my situation and what I should set up as, as well as any other helpful tips/things to be aware of. 

Here is some information about my situation:

* I was working as an in-house photographer for a company Jun 2023 - Jan 2025. 
* My annual salary on their payroll was £23,000 Apr-Aug 2024, it increased to £24,000 in Sept 2024 and finally it increased to £25,000 in Oct 2024 up until I left at the very end of Jan 2025. I've gone through all my payslips and my before tax income for this 10 months is £20,100. 
* I have made a total of £3325 since I started freelancing: £300 in Feb, £1750 in Mar and so far in Apr I have made £1275. 
* I have spent a total of £3411 on: photography equipment (£722 in Feb, £1600 in Apr) and fuel getting around for jobs (£90 in Feb/Mar), which I have kept the receipts for. 
* I will not be looking to have an office/studio space, I will just be doing this very casually - going to photoshoots out on location and editing them from my home office. 
* Things I will be expensing: photography equipment, fuel/travel costs, wifi, phone bill, public liability insurance, equipment insurance, coffees and lunches. 
* I have not sorted a proper business bank account for this yet, I use Chase bank for my general personal money and have set up a separate 'pot' named after my unofficial business name which has it's own separate account number. 

So my questions are:

1. What should I register as and why would that option be better compared to others? 
2. As I am registering in the new 2025-2026 tax year, what do I need to do about the last 2 months of the 2024-2025 tax year? As far as the government know I have been unemployed/'not earning' since January. Will I need to tell someone that I made £2050 (£1338 after the £722 equipment purchase), as I still earned £20k before tax from the 10 months of employment before it. 
3. How do I pay tax? Is it something you do monthly or is it at the end of the tax year?
4. Same question as previous but for national insurance, how do I pay that and set it up?
5. As a complete newbie to all of this, do you have any other tips or info that would be helpful to know for me?

|**Pub Date** |**March 25, 2025** |
|**Genres** |**Romance**|

Read **Summer in the City PDF** by **Alex Aster** released on March 25, 2025.

From #1 New York Times bestselling author Alex Aster comes her adult debut novel Summer in the City—a swoony, fast-paced rom-com set in New York City in which a screenwriter and a sexy tech CEO go from lovers to enemies and back to lovers again…

Twenty-seven-year-old screenwriter Elle has the chance of a lifetime to write a big-budget movie set in New York City. The only problem? She’s had writer’s block for months, and her screenplay is due at the end of the summer.

In a desperate attempt at inspiration, Elle ends up back in the city she swore she would never return to, in an apartment she could never afford (floor-to-ceiling windows, skyline views, and a new coffee shop to haunt included). It’s the perfect place to write her screenplay…until she realizes her new neighbor is tech “Billionaire Bachelor” Parker Warren, her stairwell hookup from two years ago. It’s been a lovers-to-enemies situation ever since.

When seeing him again turns into a full night of hate-fueled writing, Elle realizes her enemy/twisted muse might just be the key to finishing her screenplay... if she can stand being around her polar opposite. She writes anonymously, and he’s on the cover of every business magazine. He frequents fancy red carpeted events, and she doesn’t like leaving her emotional support five block radius.

One summer. One wall apart. He needs to fake a buzzy relationship during his company’s precarious acquisition. She needs to write a movie around a list of NYC locations. Both need a break from their unrelenting schedules, and a chance to rediscover the skyscraper glimmering, pizza crusted, sunlit charms of the city.

Summers always end, and so will this agreement. It’s all pretend. Promise.

I have this boat neck top, I love the neckline and feel like boat necks usually work fairly well for SD, but although the top is lovely and drapey, I feel like I need it to be a bit more form fitting around the waist for it to be most flattering with this skirt.

Any similar top suggestions or other styles/necklines/etc that are drapey but also waist defining? I don’t mind sleeve length, I like short, long, vest style, etc. I can always wear a tight fitting cardigan or jacket! 

I avoid halter necks because I can never find a bra that fits well and is comfortable with them, but of course if anyone has any recommendations, I’ll be very grateful! 

Also for shoes - I’m hoping to style this skirt (and similar styles) a few different ways over the summer, including out for food at a restaurant, something casual like getting a coffee with friends and also going to gigs/concerts.

Dressy, I see a lot about pointed toe shoes and daintier shoes, but I also have quite chunky ankles that look better with an ankle strap. I also generally prefer open toed sandals too, I think mules are pretty too, but I can understand it might look off or a bit stubby. Any ideas welcome! 

For gigs/nights out, I’d go for a chunky boot and a leather jacket, not the ideal silhouette but the grungier look will look more fitting with the location/situation.

Now for coffees, summer walks, etc., I’m not sure. Would converse look strange? Any sort of sandals that would be flattering but also comfortable?

This would make it impossible to consume orally and would only be inhaled. Further to this, inhalation of ethanol can be extremely damaging to your respiratory system. Gathering said molecules would also pose a challenge in your current situation,"" Sol replies like an asshole.

""Of course.""

""I understand that you are going through a difficult time. I hope you know that I'm here to provide the necessary moral, emotional and inspirational -""

""Sol, stop talking.""

Sol stops talking. I'm sure he'll butt back in soon.

I can't help but roll my eyes and sigh. I want him to notice. I want him to read the variations of my vital signs to acknowledge and document my frustration with the entire process. If anyone else was around, they'd probably think I'm being overly dramatic. Now I feel bad though. It's stupid, but I feel bad. It's not his fault he's just some glorified word-predictor.

""Sol, I'm sorry.""

""It's quite alright, Commander. There's no need to apologize. I understand the severity of your situation.""

Now I feel stupid for feeling bad. How could he understand the situation? I'm moving through space at a speed I can't even feel. To be fair, I don't know if I'm actually moving. I could be still right now.

If I live long enough, I'll probably eventually fall into orbit around some star. Probably the Sun. More than likely, it would be long, long after I'm dead. Probably wouldn't even be a star. Planetoid or ice ball is likely. I should be seeing Jupiter somewhere around here. I don't know why I'm not. I know I should also see part of that beautiful Sun at least on my back.

To be fair, it's not completely dark out here. There's lights, of course. Farther away than I can fathom. The bright ones are more than likely planets and even those are barely visible.

Now I have to accept the real issue. The real problem.

Space. I've spent hours in school learning about space. I've spent years imaging I was in space. As a kid, I'd imagine spaceships approaching each other like two boats, face to face. Space is multi-directional. I learned it. The first time I experienced was much different.

Which brings me here. Those pale dots were higher in my field of vision than they are now. I can only assume that means I'm moving up too fast in a relative sense. I have to remember to ask why I'm not dead.

The planets are all aligned on the same ecliptic orbit around the Sun. They all use the same plane. The same one that I'm moving up and away from. I think there's at least three of my old professors who would scoff at that. There is no up in space. Or down. But hey, I guess everything at least moves in a curve. No, that doesn’t sound right.

I'm still betting on an alien race finding me. That would make a cool story. Humans from the future could save me too. They'd probably want someone who wouldn't be missing. I'd end up in a zoo, living with other time displaced rogues while the future gawks and laughs at us.

I wonder what time it is. No, I'm not going to ask that. It's going to depress me.

I could also just open the menu screen, pop it up on the glass faceplate. Check how much breathing air I have left in this suit, power, whatever else they got to warn me about. I have a better idea. I'm going to run from my problems. Rather, I'll just zoom through space.

It smells in here.

I used to love putting on a suit. Even when we stayed inside. It felt cool. Maybe I got here just because I wanted to wear something like this. It's fitting that I'll die like this.

""Sol, how did I get here?""

""Are you experiencing any memory loss?"" Sol asks. A real one.

""I don't remember if I am, but if I was, I'd probably forget to tell you.""

""That's a good one, Commander! I'm glad to see you are keeping in high spirits,"" Sol says without a hint irony.

I kind of chuckle. High spirits. What's higher than space?

No, that's not funny. That's stupid. This is stupid. I blink hard. Are my eyes open or not? I look down and make eye contact with a tiny red dot. It makes the necessary connection with my eyes and face, and whatever else it caught from me, and opens a virtual menu on my view glass.

It's a huge menu, built with submenus and colorful graphs. Looks like I still have enough oxygen for… too long. How am I still at 80%? Power is still at 90%. Great, I'll still be warm when I die. It'll give all the remaining bacteria a real feast. Why is this so efficient? Who builds this shit?

I shouldn't look but I'm doing it anyway. Yep. No signal. Not getting anything.

No messages. No pings. No signals. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

I think there's random bits of subatomic particles coming and going at least. They aren't sending messages though.

I make a subtle gesture and the menu follows my eyes and disappears. I'll still check it later, though.

My chest is fighting me, churning itself up and down. Up and down, my heart wants to escape. My lungs struggle to keep up with their shallow breaths. I need to focus. The suit's system makes a chirp, warning me that I'm increasing the CO2 levels. Come on, it can't even be that much and I know it'll scrub it out.

I close my eyes and take four tiny breaths, then I exhale hard. I repeat. My heart doesn't stop the pounding. It thuds harder. It reminds me of all the horror.

How did I get here? I remember. But, how did I actually get here? I open my mouth to scream but I don't. I just stare out into the dark abyss. If I stare long enough, I'll eventually see hallucinations. It's only natural, it's so boring out here.

But really, how did I get here? Why is it so stupid? Did it even mean anything? I can't dwell on it. I need to clear my mind.

""Sol, can you tell me a story?""

""Of course, Commander. What kind of story would you like?"" Sol asks.

What do I feel like today? ""Surprise me,"" I tell Sol.",1,1744198790.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

for context, i invested to someone na kilala naman namin (yung brother nya is close friend ng brother ko and same school din kami lahat before).

the investment is for expansion ng different businesses naman. there’s a coffee shop, apparels, skin care, and etc na may mga physical stores in manila.

basically the % of the interest ng investment is dependent on how many months you would lock it in. in my case, my first investment is from last november which is 200K for 6 months. the interest in that would be 50% of the principal amount. then every month nag iinvest ulit ako ng at least 50K - 100K for 6 months ulit. 

now im confused if scam ba sya and if i should pull everything out na or wait for my cash out nalang (which will be in june and so forth). 

i realized now how promising yung 50% interest for just 6 months. very transparent naman sya with facebook posts sa mga businesses but there’s also some red flags lang din like matagal mag reply sometimes because ive been asking for a refund ng last 100k that i invested last month but i’ve decided na wag muna ituloy and more than 1 week na and still puro wait sinasabi 🥹

would really appreciate some advice! tysm 🙏🏻

ps: there’s also a signed contract for every transactions naman. also stated there na we cant pull out our investment before the due date. 

pps: if it’s really a scam need some tips lang because handler na sila ng investments for 3 years now. i want to pull out all my money na but i think it’s unfair lang if im not getting any interest 

edit: if i opt to pull out now, can i atleast get some % in interest for the past months na my investment is with them? ",3,1744198767.0,phinvest,7,0.8,False

I’m Omar, 30M based in Pickering, and I’ve been craving a good old-fashioned road trip lately. I’ve got zero set plans or destinations—just the urge to head east or north, see some new places, vibe with good music, and maybe grab food somewhere along the way.

If you’ve got a cool spot in mind, I’m open. If not, we’ll just follow the road and see where we end up.

If you’re interested in riding with me, I’d like to meet up beforehand—coffee or something chill—just to make sure we’re both comfortable and safe.

Not sure how to take it but obviously do have concerns. My issue is sometimes when I come into the office I’ll get stuck in multiple conversations even before I reach my desk. So that will technically be used against us to get rid of us? I guess I’ll just have to use a stiff arm technique and barrel my way to my desk like Derrick Henry. Sometimes I have to destroy the bathroom after a coffee or 2 and go right to the bathroom first (sorry co-workers but I have a long commute…).

“As of this week, the vast majority of EPA employees are back in the office, and benefiting from daily face-to-face interactions with their colleagues, clients, supervisors, and the public. As a follow up to the January 24 notice issued by Acting Administrator Jim Payne on EPA's return to in-person work and the Office of the Administrator's February 12 notice stating that al regular telework and remote work agreements, unless excluded, are rescinded and all teleworkers and remote workers must report full-time according to their approved work schedule by the dates articulated in the February 12 notice (an extension was granted to unplaced remote employees outside the local commuting area of any agency worksite until May 5, 2025). This message addresses next steps.

The agency will evaluate and monitor employee compliance with these requirements. Failure to report to agency worksites will result in formal discipline, up to and including removai from federal service. Disciplinary actions may be based on absence without leave (AWOL), working from an unauthorized duty location, failure to comply with agency directives, failure to properly submit time and attendance information, failure to be forthcoming and candid with information, among other charges. It is our expectation that we have a present workforce, with high productivity and high integrity, and compliance with the Retur to In-Person Work directives is critical to achieve this. 

To track employee compliance with return to office instructions, EPA will evaluate PIV card swipe data. For facilities where the agency has badge readers, which include the facilities where most employees report, it is imperative that you use your PIV card to swipe into your facity as early as possible on your workday. In addition to PIV card swipes, the agency will evaluate laptop login and PeoplePlus time and attendance data to verify compliance, therefore, it is also imperative to complete your timecards using the correct codes and for supervisors and managers to only attest to time and attendance they can verify. 

Please note, employees with reasonable accommodations, medical telework, currently serving on DETO arrangements, or who are approved for remote work as military spouses are exempted from the retur to in-person work. If you have an existing Reasonable Accommodation for situational, regular, or full-time telework/remote work, please confirm with your supervisor that the RA is documented and in effect. Undocumented reasonable accommodations may not be honored.

To the dedicated employees who have been showing up to the office every day, thank you! Your commitment to our mission does not go unnoticed.

The audit is over. Yesterday the papers in all the boxes found new homes on shelves or file cabinets. Life is good.

Today the Spring Season begins in earnest. During Coffee Hour we will have the first coin toss: MSNBC or Fox. The winner streams this week and next. Bernie is now officially working with Guy on Longhouse Elem so Dee and I will split up on the Starbucks/Costco run during weekdays.

Guy and Bernie left the house already for an early morning appointment with a prospective family. They very much want to send their daughter to the school but we cannot provide the afterschool services they need. Perhaps they can find a solution by putting their minds together.

The first RV Park Forum will be Friday night. The keynote speaker is…me. I will lead a session “The Truth about Hypersexuality.” Because of the audit preparations, I couldn’t have my session with my therapist whose clinical interest is working with clients with HS. But he more than earned his session pay by sending me links of source material about the topic. Today is PowerPoint time (actually I am using Canva now—much better templates and graphics).

Finally, we finished watching the *1923* series finale. Superbly done, no plot spoiler from me.

Returning to the lecture, Sensei states:

>In “The Opening of the Eyes,” the Daishonin first reveals that the doctrine of “actual three thousand realms in a single moment of life” hidden in the Lotus Sutra’s depths is the teaching to be propagated in the Latter Day of the Law for the enlightenment of all humankind.

He discussed this subject in detail earlier and I touched on it in [March](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIWhistleblowersMITA/s/3t7ljX3JE2).

How much the concept of “actual three thousand realms in a single moment of life” has encouraged me over the course of my practice!!! In *this* moment I can crush my karma and break my chains! Another pearl for my jewely box. Do it again and again, voila, a pearl necklace! A trend is created, a powerful—irresistible—wave.

Sensei writes:

>Next, [Nichiren] identifies the true votary of the Lotus Sutra who will spread this great teaching. In other words, after revealing the fundamental Law for attaining Buddhahood, he turns to focus on the person who will propagate it.

The theoretical is wonderful but it needs to be actualized by a person. Andinio once told us a story about the school he founded some 30 years ago. His team had worked so hard on formulating their ideas, writing an exciting proposal, and winning a highly competitive funding grant. As he put it, “And then the children came.” The theories were stress tested and many didn’t hold. A new theoretical structure had to be rapidly assembled using parts from the broken constructs.

>At the beginning of this section of the treatise, the Daishonin discusses his own vow to stand up and spread the Mystic Law in the Latter Day—the vow he made when he first proclaimed the establishment of his teaching. This demonstrates the profound importance of a personal vow or pledge when taking on the challenge to propagate the Law in the latter age.

My vow? Our vow? We have only 4 days to the Introduction to Buddhism exam and 11 days in our countdown to the discussion meeting. Last night Guy and Chima studied together--which turned into more of a needed ESL language lesson. John and Jack were supposed to meet up with N-Do to study but three friends had unexpectedly dropped in on him. Next came kind of an anguished call to John that he didn’t know what to do: hang out with his friends or tell them he had another commitment.

John remembered an article from the [March 7th World Tribune](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/meetings-are-ok-but-cant-i-practice-by-myself/) which discussed the importance of friendship in faith. It had this story:

>[The Buddha’s] disciple Ananda once commented: “It seems to me that by having good friends and advancing together with them, one has already halfway attained the Buddha way. Is this way of thinking correct?”

>Shakyamuni replied: “Ananda, this way of thinking is not correct. Having good friends and advancing together with them is not half the Buddha way but all the Buddha way.”

So N-Do and his friends went out to have a good time. Jack and John will meet to study with N-Do tonight. Then Jack just texted us that N-Do wants to bring his friends! So the ring of friendship in faith grows in a fresh new dimension.

I brought up the following thing to him once but he acted like he had no clue what I was talking about (he usually followed and unfollowed them after a couple of days / once I was noticeably uncomfortable) and he got really defensive about it. I showed the specific accounts I saw and he said he had never seen them before. 

Now, I would like a stable relationship where I don't have to deal with my partner's social media following, it's also not fun for me to do the ""fbi work"" as he referred to it. 

Anyway, we had a fight again via text last night and he said that the best would be to break up because we were not doing any good to each other. Which I actually agreed. I just didn't agree with the tone and the fact that all the blame was put on me when in reality he was dishonest about the one thing I was just trying to get clarity on. 

However, this morning I received a ""good morningggg! How are you?"" text like nothing happened, he was talking about his interview *(that he mentioned how he would probably mess up because of talking to me until late)* and now he wants to meet for a coffee after work because 'he would like to see me'. 

Is it necessary? What is it for for real? I don't get the switching in 12 hours at all, I'm confused.

Hey everyone 👋

I recently put together a simple web-based tool to help with something that always felt tedious: manually cutting a GIF into dozens of tiles for Stream Deck backgrounds.

With [**Stream Deck GIF Background Slicer**](https://sdbg.crabstudio.com.ar), you can just upload a GIF, and it automatically slices it into the correct format for your model (currently supports XL, Plus, and Regular). No more manual cropping or trying to align frames one by one 😅

✅ It's totally FREE  
✅ Works in your browser  
✅ Supports multiple Stream Deck models  
✅ No sign-up, no install — just upload and go  
✅ Includes a sample file to test  
✅ Open Source

I'm planning to add more models and AI-powered features soon (like face detection, smart looping, and video-to-GIF).

Hope it helps someone else!

I’ve had no symptoms since I began taking meds. Had been taking drugs for high blood pressure pre diagnosis. I had some issues with metoprolol including dizziness and hair loss, I am taking Carvedilol and very low dose Amlopidine Besylate with no side effects except for occasional fatigue. 
When you read that you can have a normal life with HCM, it’s true. I’ve only had to make minimal changes in my diet and exercise routine.

I know to call my cardiologist if I develop symptoms but so far I’m asymptomatic on these drugs. 
Just had one year check up, my velocity and gradient are unchanged and stable, no need for a new echocardiogram or other tests. As my dr said, you will die from something but it’s not going to be this.

My question is this: there’s a local coffee shop I go to regularly, and I often see attractive men sitting alone. If I approach one, introduce myself and ask if they’d like to play a game of chess, is that super weird? I’m terrified of rejection, or being told they’re waiting for a date or something.

I’m Omar, 30M based in Pickering, and I’ve been craving a good old-fashioned road trip lately. I’ve got zero set plans or destinations—just the urge to head east or north, see some new places, vibe with good music, and maybe grab food somewhere along the way.

I usually go solo, but this time I’m looking for someone chill to join me, as long as you’re respectful and down for an easygoing adventure. I drive a 2017 Dodge Charger (her name’s Alisa—metal fan here, if that helps paint a picture). She absolutely hates staying parked too long.

If you’ve got a cool spot in mind, I’m open. If not, we’ll just follow the road and see where we end up.

Important:
If you’re interested in riding with me, I’d like to meet up beforehand—coffee or something chill—just to make sure we’re both comfortable and safe.
If you’ve got your own ride and want to convoy instead, that would be even better.

No weird vibes, no pressure—just looking to make Sunday a bit more memorable than usual. Message me if you’re interested or wanna throw some ideas my way.",7,1744196267.0,durham,0,0.65,False
1jv2wdl,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1jv2wdl/this_is_what_helped_me_finally_take_breaks_and/,This is what helped me (finally) take breaks and reduce eye strain,"So I’ve been working from home full-time for a while now, and one weird side effect I didn’t expect was how bad my eyes would feel by the end of the day. Around 3 or 4pm, I’d get this dull headache and that burning ""please no more screens"" feeling. I didn’t think much of it at first, just pushed through it like usual, but it started becoming a daily thing.

I figured it was just too much screen time without proper breaks. In the office, there were natural interruptions like meetings in other rooms, grabbing coffee, random chats. At home, I’d look up and realize I hadn’t blinked properly in like 2 hours.

Here’s what I changed that actually helped:

- **Lighting** – I was working in a dim room because it felt cozy, but my screen was way brighter in comparison. I added a small desk lamp behind my monitor and turned down the screen brightness. That contrast was definitely making things worse.
- **Screen setup** – I was too close to my laptop and kind of hunched over all the time. Switched to a bigger external monitor placed further back and at eye level. Also increased font sizes so I don't have to squint. My posture is better now too.
- **Break reminders** – I tried the 20-20-20 rule (every 20 mins, look at something 20 feet away for 20 secs). Sounds easy, but I kept forgetting, so I made this Mac app called *LookAway* that reminds me to take eye breaks. It just pops up gently every so often and helps me remember to blink too.
- **Making breaks a habit** – I started tying breaks to little routines. I refill my water bottle every hour and make sure I look outside for a bit. Sometimes I stretch or just close my eyes for a minute or two. Nothing fancy but it helps reset.

Since I started doing this, I haven’t had that end-of-day eye burn, and my headaches are gone too (for now at least). I always *knew* I should be taking breaks, but this is the first time I’ve actually followed through.

Just wanted to share in case anyone else is dealing with the same thing. If you’ve found anything else that helps, I’d love to hear. Always looking for ways to make this remote setup a little more human.

One of those things was I was 3 hours early for my appointment. They didn't ask me if I was late or early for things but that was added in the report.

Until about 25 I was chronically late and my sleep was all over the place. When I was very young this was partially because of parental neglect I remember getting bullied for being late. I couldn't tell the time until very late and if my parents dropped me off they would do it whenever they were ready not based on actual time of needing to be somewhere. 

At 25 it became a hyperfocus to be on time. I can't tell how long things will take me - so getting dressed takes me 15 minutes but in my head I think it takes an hour, then i need to plan my 20 minute walk there but i need coffee on the way, what if the queue is long, add 45 minutes. The times just make no sense. If I'm also ready I will just go there no matter how early because I'm worried I'll forget it 

I need to plan everything as well to make sure I'm not late for things. 

Just leaving the house is getting exhausting because of this and everyone I seem to know is late for everything so I'm waiting around like an idiot for even longer.

so theres this one coworker that ive worked with for a few years now, and ive brung this up with a few of my friends. So pretty much when we would all be on break have a smoke and drinking coffee or tea he sits across the room from me  and he would just sit there and stare at me. I would always catch him in my peripheral view and when i would look up at him we would make eye contact then he would look away instantly with the “oh shit” type of look in his eyes like hes been caught. 

Anyways when it would just be us two in a room having a 1:1 conversation and theres no one else around every damn time he would stand so close to me it feels like he could feel my heart beating just a few inches away. 

He looks at me with such a wide eyed look and he holds eye contact with me for way longer than a minute and and during that time he may blink little to none which makes me feel like he is just staring right into my soul. because the eye contact is intense sometimes id be the first to break it and look around the room or when he talks with hands id look at them because it feels like less tension and less intense. 

And without missing a beat his face turns red, first its a little blush then his whole face just burns red. I cant help but feel whenever we have a 1:1 because his stare is so intense i feel like either im about to be in trouble or he knows something that i dont know. When we are both in a group setting and he tries to make conversation with me he would sometimes try bring up something personal or an inside joke that we both know and sometimes i would conversate back and joke around with him. 

But its gotten to the point now where other female coworkers would look at me with a weird look almost looks as if there confused like they should also be in on it but they wouldnt understand it even when we explain it to them they still dont get it or don’t find it amussing, i dont quite know how to explain there looks but its like they screw up there face and side eye me everytime. 

because of there looks of judgement i dont laugh at the dumb jokes he makes instead i smirk silently and i try to not make much eye contact with him either because i still get the odd weird looks from other coworkers. There would be times that hes tried  to bring up something in conversation with me in a group setting but ill only say a few words and laugh every now and  then but most of the time ill just keep looking at my screen and keep to myself. 

There have also been a few times where i might be on the phone talking with a customer or talking with another coworker hes standing only a few feet away and i can feel his intense stare so i glance my eyes at him and without a doubt he sees me looking and then looks me up and down the same time everytime whilst his face is turning red. I just dont know what to say or what to do incase im just being delusional and then ruin both of our reputations just because i let my delulu instrusive thoughts come to the fore front.

When my anxiety gets out of this world ridiclously extreme, I can get panic attacks. For example when I try to sleep, I always try to feel my heart beat in worry that it will suddenly stop. If I feel it does (it never has, but... I'm getting old... 41), I jump up like a kangaroo trying to restart it, flexing my abs trying to restart my ""dead heart"". And look at my watch (do I have a pulse?)

I have problems going outside of my apartment. Most of all, I am SOCIALLY anxious. When I try to sleep there's just me with my own thought. I am a social person, but the social anxiety makes me socially inept.

When I do feel calm, I can think straight and see no reason to live. Other than family. I've got financial issues, social issues, teeth issues, and I am fat. I feel completely fatigued, with no energy no matter how many cups of coffee I've had. Ambitions? Yes, but they are very hard to try to achieve, with all theses crap issues.

	•	78,200 — 300 BTC
	•	78,400 — 245 BTC
	•	78,800 — 203 BTC
	•	79,200 — 203 BTC
	•	80,000 — 125 BTC

→ Thick resistance wall around 78,200–79,200

⸻

What’s the chart saying?

BTC is shaping a potential double bottom, but it’s still speculative.
Locally we might retest 81K, but heavy buy interest sits around 68–70K.
If another dump comes — that’s the likely target.

Grizzly’s scenario:

→ Bounce to 80–81K
→ Another drop
→ Then maybe — a real reversal

⸻

Summary:

	•	A bounce isn’t a reason to celebrate
	•	The book is supported by strong bids, but sellers are still dominant
	•	Volume remains weak — market looks exhausted
	•	Morning CVD: -2920 — clear sell-side aggression

⸻

Until then — stay calm, sip coffee, observe the board.

I'm a game dev releasing a [cyberpunk city builder ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3211750/Neongarten/)onto Steam in a couple of weeks. I thought this community might enjoy it! It's a chill little slice of neon-drenched dystopia. In the game, you choose between three different buildings each day, placing them on a 4 x 4 grid. (If that doesn't seem like a lot of room, it isn't. When you can't build out, build up!)

What brings the game depth and replay value is the system of neighbor bonuses, where buildings will increase the value of nearby buildings. For example, Coffee Shops get more income with nearby apartments, Nightclubs double the income of nearby Bars, and a Toxic Waste Dump makes your nearby Factories and Refineries more profitable. A Tourist Of Some buildings give bonuses on faction (like Corp or Government) and others give bonuses based on how much neon  The strategy in the game comes from arranging buildings to maximize their bonuses and make absurd amounts of money.

The game has fantastic music, too! The music actually came before the game, believe it or not. When I first heard the album that became the soundtrack, I knew that I had to make a game for it. So I did :)

1jv2erw,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jv2erw/grinder_upgrade_5001000_gbp/,Grinder upgrade [500-1000 GBP],"Grinder Upgrade Suggestions

I’ve been ready for a while but need to pull the trigger soon (500-1000 GBP). I realise saying endgame is not the way but 5-10 years would be a good return, especially with the rate at which new grinders are being produced. 

In terms of brewer, eventually, I will likely grab a profitec dual boiler option (move or drive). I live in the Philippines where coffee grinders and machines are way more expensive than they are in the uk. I have friends heading over from the UK soon who are happy to bring a grinder. I will sort the machine myself at a later date. 

I am 5 years or more into the breville barista express (it’s been serviced). I know the biggest limitation is the grinder. So far I do have a preference for darker roasts with a thicker mouthfeel shot. Although, that may be because I have not been able to extract decent medium roast from my set up. To add to this when visiting local coffee shops that roast their own beans, I’m still to taste a medium/light roast that compels me to prefer it. These factors make my upgrade decisions hard to make. 

I’m considering niche zero or duo, new dial-design Eureka Mignon, zero, or Libra etc, or one of the DF options. I was hell bent on the zero because of my preference for dark roast espresso but I would be limiting my range for development of taste and experimenting with other roast options. So have expanded my search to factor in future possibilities for Burr changes. 

My wife and I mostly drink Espresso and Americano during the week, and throw in milk drinks at the weekend. I realise that someone would argue that I have no need for a dual boiler but I will get one anyway.   

Thanks in advance for the rips and tips.
