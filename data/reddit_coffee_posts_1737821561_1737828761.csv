There's nothing to figure out. There's no point . But it's what I do .

I keep coming here reading other's stories which helps me understand. Left untreated , you risk the rose glasses coming on even about some aspects of it , which is bad for you and dangerous .

But I'm sick and tired of the entire subject . I don't want to keep reading and watching and listening to BPD and narcissism anymore .

But if I don't , untrue notions about at least some moments or statements she made can immediately creep in, like some sort of mold you have to constantly clean for .

I still feel hyper vigilant. I still think about how unfair the entire relationship was . And rather than just the sigh of relief and moving on as I'd expected, it's all of what I've described .

I can sense depression setting in . I can't clean my apartment. I can't do things I enjoyed . I feel overwhelmed.

And my good friends who have listened far more than anyone should be expected to , who reassured me when I'd keep checking if it's okay and apologising for always talking about it , well I haven't heard from them for a little while . I must have burnt them out .

I understand that but I couldn't not talk about it . I even told the barista behind the counter at the coffee shop about it . I know it's not how I want to be at all.

1i9srd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1i9srd8/what_qualifies_as_putting_in_effort_in/,What qualifies as putting in effort in relationships,"I feel like as men we are taught to initiate things first if we want anything(dating, friendship, job opportunities). And I think that this mindset can open alot of doors but it can close many too. 

Because there's also a duality of letting relationships happening naturally and it should be a two way street. The minute a relationship doesnt work out, we are met with scrutiny of being desperate or needy. Honestly it's a catch 22. 

I have a short story to illustrate my point. I knew a girl in my class who started to invite me to get coffee with her. I was shy so I waited for her to initiate. Over time we started to text but brief like once a month. She became a cool associate that I talk to daily and hung out with at bars. Well when i try to go further, she ghosted and backed up. Reflecting on it, I realized that I didn't pursue at the correct moment. I waited to long and she lost interest and I read that as rejection. Was I too needy or not needy enough? This will boggle my brain for life lol. 

But thats all! As man, how have you learn to put effort into things. What are your signals that you used to measure effort?",2,1737827949.0,AskMen,3,1.0,False

I’m a software engineer in the Pittsburgh, PA area. I moved here a few years ago for work and haven’t had any success making friends. My family also lives in other states. Basically, I’m very isolated where I’m at right now, but don’t plan on moving soon due to owning a house here.

I’ve got some baggage, I’ll admit. I’ve been engaged, broke it off because I developed a crush and my therapist pointed out all of the underlying problems. After the broken engagement, I was pretty shattered. I gained some weight, stopped exercising, became very depressed, and casually dated people, including a couple of guys (I learned that I’m not into them). I just recently got out of a relationship that I thought was serious, but I guess not.

With my problems out of the way, if I haven’t scared you off, I do have some good things about myself. I’m a hopeless romantic. I would like to get married one day and have a family. I believe that I want kids, but it’s not a dealbreaker. I like to play guitar, sing, play video games (mostly sports and survival). I’m a big coffee drinker. Lastly, I’ve got a sweet tooth and like to try out different places to eat.

More about me physically: I’m 5’10”, 260lbs with dirty blonde hair and blueish-greenish eyes. We can exchange pictures when we first connect.

I’m ultimately looking for someone to spend my life with. I want to be in a relationship where we can be completely open and honest with each other and support each other in healthy ways. I’m okay with distance, but would like to eventually close the gap.

If any of this resonates with you, feel free to send me a message request and we can see where it goes.",1,1737827806.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1i9soxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAGerman/comments/1i9soxp/im_still_looking_for_a_car_to_buy_can_you_help_me/,I'm still looking for a car to buy. Can you help me make a choice in my dilemma: Mazda 3 2015 Petrol or 2012-2013 Petrol?,"So yeah, I guess it's harder to find a car to buy in Germany than I expected.

Used cars seem to be getting more expensive every dang month.

I contacted a couple of dealers, and more than half of them didn't even want to reply, ahaha. It's so funny.

Now, the problem I have. My car will be on the street most of the time, and now I am reading about the city I live (east Germany), even though it's a small city, there are a ton of criminals in it stealing cars, even DAMAGING THEM on purpose while walking next to them, and now I am afraid to buy something more expensive. I am staying in this city for 3 more years TOPS, then I might even change the country if my professional career decides to do so. But i surely need a car to be able to go to visit my pops in the south of the EU from time to time and to use it in my city here.

So far I was thinking about buying Mazda 3 Skyactiv Petrol. BUT.................!!!!!!!

From what I've seen, it's almost impossible to get an email back from those who are selling them for 8000 euros, up to 9000 even. But, I could buy one for 10 or 11k euros. I find that maybe a bit too expensive now for a car that is like 10-11 years old. Maybe i'm just petty here, but I would feel really bad if my car would be stolen or heavily damaged and I paid for it 11k euros for example. Yeeeeeees, I know, insurance can help here, but you then have a problem finding a car again, can't have the same one, and more problems.

OR, should get Mazda 3 from 2012 or 2013? Those from 2013 even have a display inside. But it's such a pity that they do not have a USB port inside. I cannot really understand that. I had a car from 2008, and it had such a port, but why they didn't put it in 5 years younger Mazda, I've no idea. But, this kind of Mazda 3 could be bought for 6-7k euros. It's a significant difference. These Mazdas are around 11k euros, 2015 year tops, and for 2k euros more, i could find a Honda Civic 2017 or 2018 O.o I hate these games with numbers sometimes ahaha...

Mazda 3 2012 or 2013 is Petrol 1.6 engine with 105 HP, while Mazda 3 2014 or 2015 is 2.0 Petrol and 120-125 HP. But, the difference in the price here is like 3-4k euros. Both of these cars have a mileage of around 100k to 150k km.

In the case of buying this Mazda 3 2012 or 2013, do you think that I would have problems when going on a 1200 km trip in one direction? Even though I would stop a couple of times to grab a coffee or something, wouldn't drive non-stop.

So, any advice here would be very useful to solve my dilemma. :)

However, people on Reddit have supported me in varying amounts 

I'm extremely grateful to all.

I won't describe the dollar amounts beyond the one I already did because it provided the funds for what I needed.

When I say the Road Took Care of Me, I mean that shit.

I was in the middle of nowhere. Almost walked past a thrift store on a service road. Walked inside. Nothing of interest.  I stopped by the cashier and asked abya duffel bag. There was a whole section in the back.

As it turns out, I got a sleeping bag that someone used a duffel bag to carry 

The duffel bag is ripping apart. I doubt it could be patched. Patched to what?

....

I've been keeping my phone off because I was literally hours and hours walking distance from a McDonald's.

Post a quick pic on Reddit. Cash App donation with the message,

""Stay up.""

That's going to get me a tent. It's about to rain the next four days 

My main goal today is to find a Walmart.

The main consensus about Kerrville, is that it's cool.

From said Walmart. 3 man tent that I can carry. Paracord or something similar to tie this sleeping bag to me.

....

Here's the deal. I'm not tied to the sleeping bag. It happens to be earth tones on the outside and camo on the inside.

A hunter donated this to the thrift store.

When I asked how much he said $20.

I asked again thinking I misheard him.

I just so happened to receive that 

Need a tent. Someone laid for that and the Paracord.

...

My parents are givers. I've kicked it down before I knew it was a thing 

I've given away every car I owned that I didn't owe money on.

Given away a sleeping bag very simytonthe one I just got. Solar panel. Jackery. To a lady who cared for dogs and walked them continuously in the rain in Washington.

Remember two things.

Jesus said he takes cares of the birds who toil not, won't he do so for you?

Guess what else the Bible says.

Proverbs 31 (6-7). Look this up!!

Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, And wine unto those that be of heavy hearts. Let him drink, and forget his poverty, And remember his misery no more.

So for those people who are afraid to give cash on accyof what some might do, check out what the Bible says.

I would be getting some strong drink line a motherfucker.

Until then.

I especially love the great meals I've been given and the love and great conversation from the people I've met.

**Me:**

30 yo, finance guy with accounting, big4 audit, us bank internal audit and controlling (FP&A) background, based in central europe.

**My situation:** 

I am currently working in a retail company, which is just a subsidiary of a big western-european corp. I am a financial controller there and it's almost 2 years since I've joined. It feels really great working here, it's the best workplace I have ever been, my performance review was 98% in the first year and 104% now. I report directly to the CFO and sometimes work closely with the CEO.

8 months after I've joined, my boss got promoted and relocated to a different subsidiary. I liked her very much, learned a lot from her and I was in a real panic when they revealed those news to the point that I was actively applying to the different companies. There was a gap in the position for less than a month and then my current boss was hired.

Luckily enough a new guy turned out to be even more easy going and we developed even better relationship than with my previous boss (the one who was promoted). He was new and I was the main brain in finance, so he naturally gave me the 'this guy knows everything' reputation company-wide. 

Now, at the begining of the January he resigned from the role and currently is in a new company. They don't have the replacement yet, so my earlier boss (chick who got a promotion) got an side assignment to be here for like 1 day a week just to make sure everything is going smooth.

After my current boss revealed company wide that he is leaving, the next morning she (my previous boss) invited me for a coffee and asked some things, like how it goes working here, how do I feel in here, how I see my further development, and adviced me that it is a good time for me to catch up with the new responsibilities outside of being a controller and suggested me when I will be talking to the CEO that I am ready to develop in a new areas. Here to say - it will be seen positively.

The same day CEO booked a meeting with me and asked nearly the same things like her above. I've responsed to that just like she adviced - that I am very comfortable with the finance I do, but I think I can manage more broader reponsibilities in this temporary period etc. etc. She seem very happy to hear that. She invited me to the weekly management meetings etc.

In the coming weeks I've indeed proactively took over just a few administrative tasks like looking for the  wires, approving payroll, coordinating with the tax office etc.

Last week I had a meeting with the HR Director (for not related stuff) and she was 'impressed' by my 'attitude change', and said something between the lines, that I must catch the train and, you know, that it is my big chance. A day later I had a call (just to take over few more things) with my boss who resigned and is in the other company (he still has his laptop till the end of the month) and the first thing he said was that I am doing a great job, that he spoke with the management and the CEO and I just need to keep it going like this. I obviously thanked him and haven't asked for the details.

I've did a little of an investigation and to date they haven't posted the job offer neither on the internal page, neither on the external job boards and nor on a linkedin. The only thing they did was a linkedin publication post by the HR Director with the job offer attachment. 

All of this makes me think that they are observing me and if I do good and will have some luck (no external candidates) then maybe they will promote me, but I don't want to make huge assumptions and growing my hopes big. I am more of a introvert, I am a bit scared to think of a people management, giving huge presentations of the multi-year plan on a europe-cluster-wide conferences etc. 

I am a bit in a conflict with myself, some part of me would want really hard this promotion, some part of me would like to stay hidden in the shadows.

  
Would you (especially you guys more experienced than me) adviise how do you see it? How to handle that situation and how to find the courage to take this theoretical opportunity to jump with my career to another level? I wanted to be a Fin Dir one day, just not now, but another occassion like that may never come again!

How to play this corporate game?

She’s in Dublin for a semester, so we decided to meet in person after chatting online for a bit.

When we met, I opened my arms for a hug to greet her, but she stepped back, which caught me off guard (this is fine she doesn’t have to). She seemed really nervous, and I tried to be understanding. As the date went on, she started to relax a bit. Her English is pretty good, but I could tell she’s not confident in speaking it.

We had coffee and talked for hours with a few laughs here and there, but she rarely made eye contact—just a few fleeting moments. After coffee, we went for breakfast at a restaurant. She still seemed nervous and mostly avoided eye contact while talking. During the last 30 minutes, she used her phone to chat with her friends because she had plans to meet them later, which I didn’t mind. She was pretty quiet overall, and when we left, there was no hug or physical contact again.

So, I’m wondering if this is typical behavior for French girls on a first date? Does it take time for them to open up and get comfortable on a personal level?

If this is just part of her personality or cultural background, I’d consider asking her out for a second date to see how it goes. But if this isn’t normal and she wasn’t interested, maybe it’s best to move on.

Would really appreciate some advice or insights!

The prior night, as were laying together in bed, Brooke said to me, “What do you want to bet that every single member of his executive team is a white male? Luke’s not a big believer in DEI. He assumes that most women and minorities who have executive jobs aren’t qualified for them, and only have them because of affirmative action or diversity programs.” 

“I don’t want to bet a dime,” I replied. “I’m sure you’re right. And yet his brother, who barely finished high school, is running one of his branch operations at the age of 18. I guess he’s okay with nepotism, just not DEI programs.”

“Exactly. He’s such a pig,” she said. 

With one notable exception, Brooke’s demographic prediction held up. The first couple to arrive was Luke’s head of human resources, a white guy in his mid thirties and his wife of similar age. We greeted them exactly as Luke had directed and, under his watchful eye, we were very liberal in our use of “sir” and “ma’am” as we brought them into the living room and served them drinks. They seemed friendly enough.

At 6:05 PM, Luke’s CFO and his wife – a couple in their mid 40s, also white – arrived at nearly the same time as his VP of Sales and his date. The latter was a young, cocky guy – in his early thirties, I guessed – and an attractive young woman in her mid twenties. Not an ounce of diversity yet. The Sales VP looked down at my socks and laughed contemptuously. His girlfriend barely acknowledged Brooke’s existence and she took her coat and brought her a glass of wine. She had an entitled expression on her face, but became very animated when greeting Luke. Why waste her energy on interacting with the help? At 6:10, Luke’s COO and his wife arrived, bringing at least a little age diversity, as he was in his mid fifties (and his wife was probably in her late forties). This couple was a little more chatty, when Brooke and I greeted them at the door.

“Why if it isn’t the professor and Mary Ann!” said Ken, the COO, boisterously, as he gave us the once over. “We’ve heard a lot about the two of you.” What had they heard? I wondered. One could only hope a fraction of the truth. That alone would be mortifying.

“Ken, nobody knows about that old show besides you,” said his wife.

“Actually, my name is Brooke, sir,” said Brooke.

“Yeah, of course. I know that and I can see your name tag. It’s the professor and Brooke. But I’m older than all of you. None of you probably are old enough to remember Gilligan’s Island. On that show, it was the professor and Mary Ann, so that’s the first thing I thought of when Luke told us about you. I just can’t get it out of my mind. I guess,” he said, laughing.

Even I was too young to have seen this inane television show when it was new, but I had seen reruns of it when I was a kid. When I asked her about it later, Brooke had never heard of it.

After we got them all comfortably seated around the living room with drinks, Brooke and I started to serve the first trays of hors d’oeuvres – bacon-wrapped shrimp and deviled eggs. I looked down at my wrist watch and noticed that it was 6:30 and Luke’s new CMO, the guest of honor, had not yet arrived. 

When I pointed this out to Brooke in the kitchen, she said, “Maybe the guy’s deliberately late so he can make a grand entrance or something. Since he’s the guest of honor and all.”

Not five minutes later, the doorbell rang, and Brooke and I both hurried to answer it, Luke walking right behind us. When we opened the door, I – rather we (because Brooke’s expression left no doubt as to her reaction) – were stunned to see Brooke’s friend, Michelle, standing there before us. Brooke’s oldest and best friend, her maid of honor at our wedding, from whom she had been estranged for the last several months. You may recall that Michelle stopped talking to Brooke last summer because she disapproved of Brooke letting Luke back into her life. Michelle told her at the time that she believed Brooke was asking for trouble (although Brooke suspected that jealousy might’ve been Michelle‘s real reason for being upset). You may also recall that they have a very complicated relationship, including having competed a great deal with each other since they were kids (with Brooke the consistent, lopsided victor), having experimented sexually with each other during college, and Michelle being the one who actually first met Luke in a bar many years back before he and Brooke got married. Indeed, that is why Brooke suspected that Michelle was actually jealous that Brooke was back together with Luke sexually – because Michelle had been the first one to set her sights on him. Finally, you may recall that Brooke explained to me that it was Michelle who initiated these periods of estrangement from her when she was unhappy about something or other before she eventually (but inevitably) would come to her senses and “come crawling back.“

All of these thoughts ran through my head as I stared at Michelle in the doorway. She was back, but she definitely was not crawling. In fact, she looked beautiful and formidable in a pencil gray skirt and matching gray jacket and white shirt. She was wearing black, sheer stockings and high heels. I had always thought of her as attractive, but now she really looked quite stunning - almost like a fashion shot of a sophisticated, confident, young businesswoman going places. 

Brooke said, “Michelle. What are you doing here?”

“Long time no see, Brooke. What I’m doing here is coming to enjoy what I expect will be a terrific meal. I’m here to celebrate my new position as Chief Marketing Officer of Hanover HVAC and Plumbing and to spend a wonderful evening with my new boss and colleagues. That’s what,” Michelle said

“Oh,” said Brooke, dumbfounded.

“Don’t keep my guest of honor waiting,” Luke said loudly, in a way that managed to sound at once lighthearted and jovial to his guests in the adjoining room and deadly serious, if not borderline threatening, to Brooke and me.

Still shocked, Brooke stammered, “No, sir. I mean…” She looked at Michelle and continued “Welcome to Mr. Hanover’s home, ma’am. May I take your coat?” As Brooke moved behind Michelle and removed her coat from her shoulders, Michelle glanced at me with a supremely self-satisfied smile. 
  
After Luke gave her a peck on the cheek in greeting, as he had all the other female guests that evening, Michelle whispered in Brooke’s ear (but loudly enough for me to hear), “I’ve missed you, Brooke.”

“I’ve missed you, too,” Brooke said. 

“We’ll talk later. I’ve got the do the corporate thing now, you know. I love the choker, by the way. Sexy.”

Then walking away from Brooke towards Luke, Michelle said to her, “Get me a dirty martini, two olives.” 

“Yes, ma’am,” said Brooke. 

In the kitchen, as we mixed drinks, I said, “Are you as surprised as I am that Michelle is his new head of marketing?”

“Well, I was startled at first. Just because I haven’t seen her for so long, I guess. But when you really think about it, it’s not that surprising really. I mean she’s a marketing executive in a part of the country without a lot of juicy marketing roles. Luke’s company is growing like wildfire, so I’m sure it’s an appealing role for someone like Michelle. And there’s probably not a ton of marketing talent in the region for Luke to choose from, either. So, it’s really not that surprising, I guess.” Her words aside, Brooke’s insistence that she wasn’t that surprised didn’t sound that convincing to me.

When she finished preparing Michelle‘s martini, I said to her, “Do you want me to take this out to her and you can bring this old fashioned to what’s his name, Mr. Gilligan’s Island?”

“No. Luke was pretty clear that he wants me to serve the women and you to serve the men. I’m sure this is intentional. Michelle is going to love having me wait on her and treat her like a queen tonight. Let her have her fun. This is a big night for her, after all. It’s not like Luke is going to have a lot of these work get togethers. It’ll be good to patch things up with Michelle later. I really do miss her, you know.”

“I’m sure,” I replied. 

It was quite the evening. As Brooke said, Luke was indeed in all his glory, a 28-year-old CEO, holding court with his team of older underlings, with his ex wife and her new husband scurrying around obsequiously to fullfill every last request of his guests. 

At dinner, Luke was seated at the head of the long table, with the guest of honor at the opposite end. When we served the entree (filet mignon in a red wine sauce), Michelle stopped Brooke from going back into the kitchen after taking a bite of her steak. “I said I wanted my steak medium rare. This is medium. Take it back and bring me what I ordered.”  Not a single “please”, an imperious tone and haughty expression. 

“Yes, ma’am. It will take a few minutes to prepare, ma’am,” Brooke responded. 

“Really? I thought it would be instantaneous,” Michelle said sarcastically, eliciting chuckles from others at the table. “I’d rather wait and have it done the way I requested it. Try to get it right this time. And bring me a glass of wine while I wait.” 

“Yes, ma’am. Right away,” Brooke replied.

In the kitchen, as I hurriedly seasoned one of the two remaining portions of steak (fortunately, the oven was still hot), I said, “So much for our leftovers.”

Brooke said, “That’s okay. There’s still one left. You can have that one. I’ll eat Michelle’s; she barely touched it.”

“There’s nothing wrong with that steak. Look, it’s pink inside.”

“It may be slightly overdone, but just barely. But we deal with this kind of unreasonable bullshit at the restaurant all the time. Business dinners are the worse. They like to show off for each other by treating the restaurant staff like shit. I’m used to this behavior.”

“But she’s your friend,” I protested. 

“Like I said, we have a complex relationship. She’s preening a bit. This her big night, after all. Her moment in the sun. It’s probably going to be all downhill for her from here as the sole female manager on Luke’s team, so she’d better enjoy tonight.”

Michelle and the other guests kept us busy the rest of the long night, which lasted two hours past dinner. There were other plenty of other humiliating moments, including when they were all laughing about Luke being given the key to the city by the mayor of a small town where he was opening up a new branch. 

The CFO quipped, “You can add it to your collection of keys, Luke! I’m pretty sure the one around your neck is the key to something a lot smaller than a city. Ha ha.” He turned around and looked at me, where I was standing at attention near the table, ready to refresh drinks. The others also looked at me – or, to be more precise, at my bulky crotch – and laughed heartily.

Luke said, to drive the point home, “Prof. Get me another drink.”

“Yes, sir,” I said, feeling my face burn in shame. 

Still later, a clearly inebriated Ken, the COO, came into the kitchen where I was plating some cookies and said to me, “So you’re Luke’s latest project. You know, Luke and I go back 10 years to his first job at Dell’s Plumbing. He was only 18 when he slept with the wife of the boss. That was poor ole Ed Dell. Before long, Luke and Ed’s wife were openly kissing in front of the guys. I was the VP, Operations. Then Luke started ordering Ed around at the office, making him get his coffee and such. Before you know it, Ed – this very masculine, blue collar guy – was wearing frilly, pink shirts and jewelry at the office. Your socks and tie bring back some memories. But you have it good by comparison, professor. There was one hot summer day when I came back from a job to see Ed out in the yard in a bikini – a sight no one ever should have had to see – washing Luke’s pickup truck. About 10 of the guys were around watching, cracking up. It was pretty funny, I have to admit. Luke’s a real ball buster, isn’t he?”

“Yes, sir. Can I get you another old fashioned or anything?”

“No, I think I’ve probably had enough. But that time with the bikini really broke ole Ed. He never recovered from all that humiliation, I guess. He shut down the business soon after that, and he and his wife moved out of the state. To Florida, I think. In fact, that’s how Luke started up his own company; he was able to buy up Ed’s trucks and tools in a fire sale. Kind of ironic, right?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Yeah, I found out pretty quickly that’s it’s lot better to be on Luke’s team than to be up against him. Ed wasn’t a bad guy. But it was different with him than you.”

“How do you mean, sir?”

“Ed’s old lady was a kinky, dominant broad. Luke was sleeping with her, but didn’t seem in control of her. But Luke seems to have your wife under his thumb as much as he does you. I guess you’re all pretty kinky, huh?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Well, whatever floats your boat.”

Later that evening the VP, Sales said, “That was an excellent dinner, Luke. These two are pretty good,” he said, looking over and Brooke and I, who were standing nearby in case anyone wanted anything. “Maybe we can borrow them for Holly’s 25th birthday party this summer.” Holly was his entitled girlfriend who had barely acknowledged Brooke’s and my presence all evening as we waited on her. 

“We’ll see about that,” Luke said.

“That would be great, Luke. I’d really appreciate it,” said Holly, discussing Brooke and me like we were indentured servants. Which, I guess we sort of were…

Michelle said, “Maybe Hanover’s Catering will be your new line of business, Luke.” 

He laughed. “Or Hanover’s Maid Service. They cleaned the whole place this afternoon, too.”

“The Hanover empire is unstoppable,” Michelle said. I looked over at Brooke, who rolled her eyes at me. 

By 10:30, all the guests had finally left except for Michelle. Luke and Michelle were sitting on the couch talking. Brooke and I were cleaning up around them when Michelle asked Brooke to get her another glass of wine.

Brooke said, “I’m busy cleaning up now. Do you think maybe you could get it yourself?” She then added “Ma’am” with a bit of sarcastic emphasis.

“No, I don’t. The party’s still on until I go home. Right, Luke?” Michelle said.

“Damn straight,” said Luke. 

Brooke went into the kitchen and came back with a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon and refilled Michelle’s glass. “Enjoy, ma’am,” she said, barely, if successfully, suppressing her annoyance. 

“Thanks, Brookie,” said Michelle, with a giggle. I know Brooke hated to be addressed in that diminutive. Michelle was really pushing her luck. 

“You know, maybe the party will never end. Do you think it’s time to spring our surprise, Luke?” Michelle continued.

“Go for it,” he replied. 

“You see, Brookie. I’m not just Luke’s new Chief Marketing Officer. I’m his new girlfriend as well. Surprise!”

I looked over at Brooke. I saw different emotions rapidly pass through her beautiful eyes. Confused. Incredulous. Crestfallen. Humiliated. 

Brooke turned to Luke and said, “But…but you told me your girlfriend was traveling and couldn’t make it…I asked you directly…is this some kind of a joke?”

“No joke, Brookie,” said Michelle, smiling smugly.

Smiling somewhat sheepishly, by contrast, Luke shrugged his shoulders and said, “What can I say? I lied.”

Brooke sat down and said simply, “Wow.” 

“Oh come on, Brookie, don’t sulk. Sometimes you have to lie to surprise someone. Think of all the fun that we’re going to have together!” Which were almost the exact words Brooke used with me when Luke first entered our lives and my enslavement in my own home began all those months ago.

Yes, Michelle was very much back in the picture, but certainly wasn’t crawling. At that moment, I had a strong feeling that, going forward, Brooke would be the one on her knees. I was not mistaken.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I set the alarm app on my iPhone for 6:30 AM Saturday morning so Brooke and I could get an early start. We had a lot of prepping and cooking to do in order to be ready to serve as many as 12 guests later that day: hors d’oeuvres and cocktails were scheduled for 6 PM and dinner was to be served at 7:30.

However, we were awoken not by the obnoxious ringing noise on my phone at 6 AM, but rather by repeated rings of our doorbell an hour earlier. I was lying next to Brooke in bed, startled out of a deep sleep by the insistent sound. Brooke was a deeper sleeper than I was, so I was the first one to get up out of bed. As was typical, I was sleeping in an old T-shirt and a pair of panties, so I quickly put on my bathrobe and hurried downstairs to answer the door. It was still completely dark outside. Standing on our porch was Luke’s brother, Kevin.

“Took you long enough,” he said, rudely.

“Hi, Kevin,” I replied, drowsily. “I’m sorry. We weren’t expecting you. Did you tell one of us you planned on coming by this morning?”

Behind me, I heard Brooke say, “Who’s there, Walter?”

“It’s okay, darling. It’s just Kevin”

“‘Just Kevin.’ I’m not sure that’s a smart way to talk about your new boss, Wally. I sure hope you’ve been studying up on those DIY plumbing videos on YouTube, like I told you to in December,” Kevin said, walking boldly past me into our house.

“You’ve gotta be kidding me,” said Brooke, sleepy and annoyed. She was too groggy to be polite. I’m fairly certain that had she been alert, she would’ve been more careful in her choice of words and in her attitude.

“Nice to see you, too, Brooke. Also not a very respectful way to talk to your future babysitter. That’s okay, there’ll be plenty of time to teach you both to mind your manners later. I’m here to drop off Luke’s stuff. Put some clothes on Wally, and help me bring in the boxes. They’re in back of my truck.”

“Sure, Kevin. I’ll be right back,” I said, turning to go upstairs to change.

Kevin interrupted me, “You’re going to have to get back into the habit of calling me ‘sir’, son. Since I’m going to be both your boss and your babysitter from now on,” the brash teenager said to me, chuckling.

“This is ridiculous. Walter is not your son, Kevin,” said Brooke.

It was, indeed, completely ridiculous for an 18-year-old plumber to be calling a 40-year-old literature professor “son.” Nevertheless, Kevin was in the midst of his “I told you so” visit, clearly in a position of power now. Though we then had no idea of the depth and extent of it, Brooke and I were in a position of weakness, what was to become our new normal. It certainly was not a good idea to antagonize him. 

“Be careful, Brooke,” I warned.

“You better listen to your little hubbie, Brooke, if you know what’s good for you. You’re going to be calling me ‘sir’ soon enough yourself,” Kevin said, with an arrogant smirk very similar to that of his big brother.

Brooke glared at him, but at least didn’t say anything else to challenge him. 

As I started to go back up the stairs, Kevin interrupted me, “Wait a minute, son. What are you wearing under that robe? Turn around and take it off.”

“Um…yes, sir,” I said, reluctantly removing my robe. I saw Brooke roll her eyes.

Brooke had told me that she planned to lock me back in my chastity cage that afternoon before we went over to Luke’s house. But at that moment, I was still free. Like many men, I nearly always woke up with a hard-on – the morning wood, I believe it is called – and I was probably harder than on most mornings given this humiliating encounter with Kevin (the usual collusion between my treacherous cock and my submissive brain). He stared down at my cock, tenting out my panties.

“Ha ha. Just like I thought. You’re pathetic, Wally. It’s no wonder why Brooke begged Luke to start banging her again. She needs a real man’s cock, not your pansy pin dick. You too, Brooke. Let’s see what – If anything, ha ha – you’ve got on under your robe.”

Brooke continued to regard Kevin with a death glare, but, while she didn’t completely remove her robe as I had, she did open it up momentarily, giving him a glimpse of her body, naked except for her panties. Whereas I had on a fuller pair of navy blue boyshorts panties (trying to hide from Brooke the lingering effects of Paul’s strapping, as my ass was still quite red when we went to bed last night), Brooke was wearing a pair of maroon, cheeky panties (quite skimpy). Her nipples were rock hard, a fact which did not escape Kevin’s attention. We both saw him look directly at her breasts and smile, before she closed her robe.

“You must be cold, Brooke. Or, maybe, you’re actually hot. Ha ha. It is pretty warm in here. You two really should start wearing matching panties. Get your ass upstairs and get dressed, Wally. My first job is across town in 45 minutes. I don’t have all fucking day. How about a cup of coffee, Brooke?” he said, more an order than a request.

“I was just about to make some anyhow,” Brooke said, testily, before walking towards the kitchen. I ran upstairs and slipped on a pair of sweatpants.

Probably because he was in a hurry, Kevin helped me bring the boxes into the house. However, he didn’t help to bring them upstairs into the bedroom (still more work for me and Brooke to do later). There seemed to be about a third fewer boxes than he took away in December. 

As if reading my my mind, he said to me as we carried in a particularly heavy one together (no doubt, containing some of Luke’s extensive footwear collection), “You probably notice that there’s not as many boxes now. That’s because Luke wants you and Brooke spending more time at his house, especially when it’s warmer out. I can’t wait. I’m sick of this shitty, cold weather.” It was 22 degrees that late February day, and I shared Kevin’s fatigue with the cold weather. 

After we finished with the boxes, Kevin walked into the kitchen and said to Brooke, “Put my coffee in a thermos or something. I’ve got to get going.”

Eager to be rid of him, Brooke filled up one of our Hydro Flasks with coffee and asked, “Do you take milk or sugar?”

“Now that’s more like it. Milk, two teaspoons of sugar. Both of you will know all of my and Kaylee’s preferences real well before long. Which reminds me, Luke wanted me to tell you both to be at his house by noon.”

As Brooke poured the milk into the Hydro Flask, she said, “He said the guests will start arriving at 6 PM. We won’t need anywhere near that long to get ready. We weren’t planning on getting there until 3.”

“Change of plans,“ Kevin said with another smirk. “Luke’s cleaning lady called in sick yesterday, so he wants you there early to give the place a good cleaning, especially the bathrooms and the kitchen. He said you should bring another set of clothes to clean in and then you can take a shower afterwards before you change into what you’re gonna wear when you serve everyone snacks and dinner.”

“Great,” said Brooke. 

“You don’t sound that happy, Brooke,” Kevin said, smirk intact. 

“It’s just a lot of work, is all. Tell Luke we’ll be there. Thanks for bringing his stuff,” Brooke said.

“Good girl,“ Kevin replied, as he took his coffee and walked out of the side door that led to our driveway. “Don’t worry, we’ll be seeing a lot more of each other real soon,” he added with a wink, before the door closed behind him.

“Good morning, darling,” I said with a smile, trying to make light of Kevin’s most unpleasant, surprise visit. 

“I hate that bratty, fucking little snitch. He makes my skin crawl,” Brooke said.

“Mine, too. Unfortunately, he’s part of the package with Luke.”

“Yes, Kevin and apparently his skanky girlfriend, Kaylee, too. Not to mention Luke’s cunt of a girlfriend, whatever her name is. I guess we’re going to be everyone’s little bitches.”

“We’ll find out her name soon enough, I guess. Do you think she’ll be there tonight? You know, as his date for the dinner?” I asked, with trepidation. I hesitated to bring up this subject with Brooke, but it was certainly weighing on my mind. I knew meeting Luke’s girlfriend was going to be incredibly difficult for her.

“No, I asked him point-blank and he said that she’s traveling. Thank god for small favors, at least. Tonight‘s going to be humiliating enough as it is without me having to meet this bitch on top of it.”

“Do you think his leadership team will know who we are? Maybe they’ll just assume we’re the caterers?”

“Are you kidding? Of course, they’ll know exactly who we are. I told you about Luke’s reputation – how he publicly cuckolded and totally emasculated his first boss. And how he’s done that with several others since, including other co-workers and employees of his. Maybe not to the same extent as his old boss. But he’s slept with their wives and rubbed their noses in it. This is his brand, Walter: big swingin dick, Luke Hanover. He revels in it. You can be quite certain that everyone there is going to know that his ex-wife and her English professor husband are the ones waiting on them all like Luke’s little lackeys. Luke will be in all his glory tonight, and having us there as his servants will be icing on the cake.”

“Well maybe people will think that we have a catering business on the side?” I ventured.

“Yeah, and maybe they’ll also think we’re from outer space. Get real.”

“Ok, I get it. It’s going to be humiliating. Are you really sure you’re up for all of this, Brooke?” I asked.

She looked me in the eyes and touched my arm. “Walter, I know you mean well, but you have to stop asking me that. This is the price I have to pay to have Luke back. I’m going in with eyes wide open. That doesn’t mean that I’m always going to be happy about what’s going on or that I’m not going to complain about it. Sometimes, I’m probably even going to cry about it or rage about it. But that doesn’t change fact that I’m all in, 100%, for this next crazy chapter in our lives. Come what may.”

“The newest twist in the game,“ I said.

“That’s right. But what about you, my loyal knight? I’m the one who should be asking you: are you sure YOU’RE up for all this? Especially tonight, being a waiter for all of these corporate blowhards? I know the type well. I mean, I wait on these types of people all the time at the restaurant. I’ve been a waitress for a long time now, so I’m used to the humiliations service workers are routinely subjected to – although, admittedly, it’s going to be on a whole different level tonight. But you’re not. It’s a lot different being in charge of a classroom than being a waiter or a waitress.”

Brooke, of course, did not know about the all of humiliation I suffered after I lost control of my class last year following the Ren fair. She did not know that I was now under the control of a few of my former students, compelled each week to cook for them, and to serve as serve as their maid. She was not aware that I had become the coffee boy and foot masseuse of my fellow professor and friend. All of the above , byproducts of Luke’s domination, of course. Except for those few occasions that Brooke was present when I was humiliated in front of a wider group of people – such as when I served as a waiter when Neil and Laura came over for dinner, or when she and I cheered Luke on at his football games, or at the Ren faire itself – she was really only aware of my submission to her, and to Luke, of course. Still, she certainly knew that I was no stranger to humiliation. 

However, I had a strong suspicion that the impending humiliation we were facing with Luke’s return was going to be far more challenging for Brooke to endure than for me – that, in fact, it was going to be far more challenging for her to endure than she realized. Because, whereas I am fundamentally a beta, Brooke is fundamentally an alpha. I can hear some of those reading this say, “Yeah, sure. She’s an alpha just like she’s a feminist – allowing Luke to dominate her and degrade her in the sack. She’s a real alpha, all right.” But, as I have explained before, Brooke is turned on by being sexually dominated and degraded by a certain type of alpha male – in fact, it seems as though Luke is the only one who truly fits that bill for her (so far, at least). And even with Luke, she long resisted submitting to him outside of the bedroom; that’s why she divorced him in the first place. She was now agreeing to this new, broader level of submission because she has accepted the fact that she is sexually addicted to him – and, realizing the intensity of her addiction, Luke set these conditions for her to continue to have access to her drug. It is either submit or do without the drug. As we have seen, the withdrawal pains for her were not sustainable.

But in virtually every other aspect of her life, Brooke is generally the one in control. She is obviously completely in control of me. Even at the restaurant, although a waitress, she is generally looked up to by the younger waitresses such as Laura and even by the more seasoned waitstaff and other restaurant staff. Her bosses (even her sexist manager) know that she possesses intellectual capability well beyond her job, and respect her competence, judgement and work ethic. And, over the years, there have been many lecherous male patrons of the restaurant, and rude customers of both sexes, who have been put in their place by Brooke. In her friendships, too – such as with Laura and her estranged friend Michelle – Brooke is the one who is generally deferred to. She is confident, strong willed, a natural leader. She is also fiercely competitive, someone who likes to win (whether a tennis match, a board game, or an argument) and who usually does. For those who can’t see how it is possible for someone to have an alpha personality and also be sexually submissive – to be, in essence, a feminist but still allow herself to be sexually degraded  – I’m sorry for you that you see things only in black and white, and are incapable of understanding how two opposing things can be true at the same time.

As Brooke’s devoted knight (her chivalrous cuckold, as Anna put it), it was my job – indeed, my sacred duty – to stand by her side during what I knew would be an incredibly trying period for her. It was my job to console her if she wanted to cry on my shoulder, to be her punching bag if she needed someone to take her frustrations out on, to absorb as much of the humiliation directed her way as possible so as to lighten her burden. Why, you may ask? Because that’s what knights do for their ladies, that’s why. Because I love her more than I have ever loved anyone, or anything, in my life. 

So I answered her question by dropping to my knees, and saying to her, “I would gladly suffer any and all humiliations for you, my lady.” I then removed her slipper and reverently kissed her bare right foot. I was completely serious, but levity also has its place at times like these. So, I next looked up at her and smiled, “When we get to Luke’s, I’m going to say to him, ‘Little bitch Walter reporting for duty, sir!’”

Brooke looked down on me, grabbed my head with her hands and pulled me towards her body. She smiled somewhat sadly and said, “I love you. You’re really too good for me, you know that?” And then she smiled more fully and said, “And I’ll stand right beside you and say to him: “Little bitch Brooke reporting for duty, sir!” 

I stood up and said, laughing, “Use and abuse to your heart’s content, sir!”

Still smiling, now more wistfully, she said, “He really will, you know. But maybe after the dinner party, he’ll use and abuse us in a good way, at least. Well, I guess we’d better get to work.”

“Wait, if Luke isn’t bringing anyone to his dinner, we’ll only have eleven people to feed,” I said. 

“That’s right. Good.”

“I bought enough for twelve portions.”

“That’s okay. Maybe he’ll allow the help eat the leftovers,” she laughed. “It IS going to be a pretty awesome meal.”

“It’s certainly going to be an expensive meal. Do you think he’ll reimburse us for all the groceries?”

“He said he would. Just not for our slave labor, obviously.”

“Obviously,” I said.

An hour before we left for Luke’s, Brooke locked me back in my chastity cage. 

“Your little cock has been free for so long, at least for the most part. But you’re all out of get of jail free cards now, I’m afraid,” she said, smiling, as she pulled my panties down with one hand and held my cage with the other. I got immediately hard. 

“Oh my, I think it’s excited to be locked up again. Go get a bag of ice.” 

After she iced me down she was able to get the cage over my momentarily flaccid cock and pulled my balls through the base ring. I had just gotten a full body waxing two days earlier, so my cock and balls were completely hairless. As soon as I was locked up, my cock started to inflate again, pushing up against the cold metal rings of the DOMINIX Deluxe chastity cage Brooke had bought me for Christmas. 

“I think it likes its new prison. I’m going to keep one key on my anklet and give the other one to Luke, of course. That way, he’ll have a key to both of your cock cages.”

“Of course. I just wish you could wait till after dinner to put it on me. Those pants that he wants me to wear are so tight, I’m afraid everyone will be able to see the bulk beneath them.”

“I doubt it. Your black waiter pants will hide it a lot better than yoga pants at least; I’m surprised he’s not making you wear those. Too informal, I suppose. Besides, maybe Luke will let you wear the apron Michelle bought you last year. It’’s effeminate, but at least it will hide any bulk. I really like the looks of this chastity cage – the curve, the rings. Look how shiny it is!” she said as she flicked my cage with her finger nail. “Now you really are my knight in shining armor.”

“I don’t really feel prepared to go to battle in this armor, my lady. I feel very…very weak.”

“Your weakness is your strength, my knight.”

“If that’s really true, I’m invincible,” I said, with a slight laugh.

Luke greeted us at the door when we got to his house at 12 noon sharp. Brooke and I were dressed in sweatpants and T-shirts, ready to clean, and brought our serving uniforms along in a bag. We had also brought along several bags and trays of food, a mixture of hors d’oeuvres and dishes we had already prepared that just need to be heated up, and the ingredients to make several more dishes. 

“Good. You’re on time. My cleaning lady – ex cleaning lady, I should say – called in sick yesterday. Seems like she’s always calling in sick, but for her to do it right before my big dinner really pisses me off. She’s done. You’ll find all the cleaning supplies in the basement. I want this place to really sparkle tonight,” Luke said, by way of greeting.

“No kiss or anything?” Brooke said to him, with a faint smile. 

“There’s no time for that now. Do a great job tonight – which you’d better – and there might be a reward later. But, for now, you two have way too much work to do to be worried about anything other than getting it done. I left some things for you to wear tonight on the kitchen table.”

“We brought what we’re wearing with us. Just what you told us to bring. I’m wearing my waitress uniform and Walter’s wearing exactly what he did the first time he cooked you dinner,” Brooke said.

“Good. Yes, that’s what I told you to do, but I got you a couple of little things to add or substitute. I told you how important this dinner is to me. Remember, I just hired my CMO – that’s chief marketing officer, prof – as the last member of my executive team. So, my CMO is the guest of honor. But this is really a celebration of the fact that I’ve finally got my whole leadership team in place. I expect you both to address everyone as sir and ma’am throughout the evening. Every time you take a drink order. Every time you offer them something to eat. Every time you interact with them in any way. Treat them all with respect, especially the guest of honor. Got it?”

“Yes, sir,” we both said, almost in unison. 

“Is the cuck locked up?” Luke asked Brooke. 

“Yes, sir. Securely. I got him a new cage for Christmas. I think you’re going to like it. Here’s your key. It’s the original. I’m wearing the copy on my anklet,” Brooke said as she handed him my key.

“Good. Your furlough is finished, I’m afraid, prof.”

“Yes, sir,” I said, feeling my cock twitch.

“How many people will there be tonight?” Brooke asked. 

“Only ten. My CFO and his wife. My COO and his wife. My CHRO and his wife. My head of sales and his date. My new CMO, and me. Neither of us are bringing a date. You can take any leftovers home.”

“Thanks,” said Brooke. 

“I’ve got some things to do in town. I’’ll be back by 3 to check on your cleaning.”

Mercifully, except for Luke’s bedroom and en-suite bathroom, the house was not especially filthy. Even so, the two of us had to work at a frenetic pace to thoroughly clean a 6000-square foot house in three hours. Meanwhile, we saw what Luke had left for us on the counter: a pink bowtie (obviously for me to substitute for my black one) and sheer pink, nylon socks for me; a black leather choker for Brooke; and name tags for both of us – “Brooke” and “Prof” (just in case any of the guests had not gotten the memo about who were waiting on them that evening). 

When Luke got back at 3 PM, he inspected the rooms to ensure that our cleaning was up to his standards while Brooke and I showered and changed into our serving uniforms to begin preparing the hors d’oeuvres and dishes for dinner. Fortunately, he seemed pleased with our efforts. Then he asked us to stand next to each other and he inspected us. My new socks were readily apparent, as my tight, black pants ended several inches above my ankles; at least, I wasn’t required to be barefoot as I was the first time I served Luke (instead, I wore a pair of black dress shoes, which contrasted absurdly with the pink, nylon socks). Overall, I looked absolutely ridiculous in my tight black shirt and pants, vividly offset by the pink tie and socks. Brooke was wrong; the bulk of my chastity cage was clearly visible beneath the fabric of my pants. The black apron at least hid my crotch from view; effeminate as it was, I was grateful to be wearing it.

Luke quickly dispelled that temporary comfort. “Prof, you can wear the apron when you’re working in the kitchen, but lose it when you’re serving food or drinks. Take it off now.” 

When I did, he looked down at my crotch area, the presence of my cage painfully obvious (and causing pain, as my cock swelled in its confines under his critical eye), and smirked. “You’ve really have gotten tubby over the last couple of months, haven’t you? I can see your belly fat bulging over your belt, and those pants are really tight on you. Well, your first weigh-in is tomorrow at 5 PM. Our mutual good buddy Neil and I will whip you into shape in no time.”

“Yes, sir. Thank you, sir,” I said, wondering how literal he was being. 

“Don’t mention it, prof. It’s going to be my pleasure, believe me,” he said, continuing to smirk.

My cage wasn’t the only thing obvious to the guests that evening, as Luke ostentatiously wore a silver chain with the key to my chastity cage dangling over the second button of his dress shirt. Everyone there could clearly see that their boss, the ex husband of my wife, was my keyholder. 

In her waitress uniform, Brooke looked almost exactly as she had the night I ran into her at the restaurant for the first time since being her professor. That was now nearly twenty months ago. What a journey we had been on since that fateful evening! Brooke’s restaurant catered to a largely male, corporate clientele, so the owners hired mostly young, attractive women as waitresses, and the short skirt, heels and sheer, black stockings – while by no means over-the-top or indecent – were clearly intended to appeal to the male patrons. However, the choker was something else altogether. The choker Luke had left out for Brooke to put on was similar to the one Brooke had made me wear to my class last semester in that it was leather. However, it was really like the choker she had teasingly threatened to make me wear; it had a metal ring embedded in the front of it – not sticking out, but still something to which a leash could conceivably be attached. In other words, it more overtly resembled a slave collar. Brooke looked incredibly sexy in it, especially with the red lipstick and makeup she was wearing (also at Luke’s behest). But she also looked submissive (for some reason, she made me think of Princess Leia enslaved by Jabba the Hutt) . She brushed it off by saying to me that women were wearing chokers these days ironically, to reclaim power and bodily autonomy. I didn’t buy it (especially since it wasn’t her decision to wear it). Maybe that would’ve been plausible for a choker without that ring, but to me the choker Brooke wore screamed that she was someone’s property. And clearly not the property of the guy wearing a pink bowtie and socks. More likely the property of the man wearing the key to that guy’s chastity cage around his neck. 

As if that were not enough, during his inspection of us, Luke ordered Brooke to remove her black jacket and her bra, so that her nipples would be visible through her snug fitting white shirt. When she removed her bra in front of us, Luke walked up to her and firmly grasped her nipples in his fingers.

Brooke moaned at his touch, pushing her body up against him and arching her neck upwards to try to kiss him. Rather than kiss her, he squeezed her nipples.

“You shouldn’t hide your best asset, slut. Everyone tonight should be able to enjoy looking at your tits. If I thought about beforehand, I’d have bought Hooters uniforms for you both to wear.”

Brooke laughed. 

“What’s so funny?” Luke asked. 

“I just had a mental picture of Walter in a Hooters uniform,” Brooke replied. She, of course, had no idea that I had already been forced to wear one and model it for my students in early December. How surreal my life had become, I thought. 

“It’s you who I’d like to see in that uniform. You don’t have huge tits like the Hooters girls, but everyone should be able to see your Goldilocks tits.” Luke was correct in his appraisal of Brooke’s perfect breasts: they were neither too big nor too small but just right, with lovely protruding nipples. He squeezed her nipples harder. I could see her grimace in a mixture of pain and arousal. “Don’t wear your jacket tonight. And throw away your damn bra. You should never wear a bra.”

“Yes, sir,” Brooke said, still pushing up against him. “Could you please make love to me now. Walter can start preparing the dishes. We have plenty of time,” she asked him. 

“Make love to you? Fuck you, you mean?”

“Yes, sir, fuck me. Fuck me senseless. It can be quick.” 

Still gripping her nipples, Luke said, “You and the cuck are I in what I call a probationary period with new employees at my company. Fuck up tonight in, like not being attentive or respectful enough to my guests, and you’re fired. Simple as that. Kevin will move all my stuff back out tomorrow. If you do a good job, on the other hand, I’ll fuck your brains out tomorrow. Would you like that?”

“Yes, sir.  We’ll do a great job, I promise. Please fuck my brains out,” Brooke begged him, as he squeezed her nipples harder. 

“You’ve been acting like a pretty dumb slut lately, but if I fuck your brains out, you’ll be a complete bimbo. Do you want that?” he asked, continuing to squeeze.

I hated this. Perhaps more than anything else, I hated him denigrating Brooke’s intelligence; possibly the only thing I hated more than that was hearing Brooke denigrate her own, to appease him. 

“Yes, please, I want that. Fuck me so hard that I can’t think at all. Make me your bimbo, Luke. Sir.”

Luke walked behind Brooke and grasped her neck tightly with his large hand and pushed his hand down into the front of her skirt. She gasped and closed her eyes, as he appeared to touch and rub her vagina with his fingers under her skirt and stockings. Grasping her neck was so gratuitous; it was all about control and domination

“Please,” she moaned. 

“You’re leaking like a faucet, slut.” 

“Please,” she moaned again, quietly. She was not begging him to stop.

Although I couldn’t see underneath her clothes, it appeared as though he was thrusting his fingers in and out of her vagina. She pushed her body backwards against him and bucked her pelvis. He then pulled his hand out of her skirt, and held up his two visibly moist fingers, smiling at me malevolently. 

He then inserted his two fingers into Brooke’s mouth. Closing her eyes, she obediently sucked her secretions off Luke’s fingers as he said, “Your panties are soaking. Don’t be dripping all over my nice clean floors now, slut. Now I’m gonna let you two get to work; I know you’ve got a lot to do. Later, when my guests start to arrive, I want Brooke to greet the female guests at the door by saying, “Hello ma’am, welcome to Mr. Hanover’s home.’ Then offer to take their coats, bring them into the living room and take their drink orders. Prof, you do the same for the men. Once everybody is settled with a cocktail you can start serving the hors d’oeuvres. Got it?”

“Yes, sir,” we both said. 

When Luke left the room, Brooke simply said, “Bastard” (whether more out of of humiliation or frustration was difficult to say). She was still breathing heavily, her face and neck flushed.

We worked hard for the next three hours to assemble the hors d’oeuvres and to begin cooking those that needed to be served warm as well as the entrées and side dishes. Luke had a well stocked bar, but I made sure everything was in order to be able to mix cocktails. He had also purchased a case of beer and several bottles of wine.

Luke came down from his bedroom at 5:45, ready for the arrival of his guests. He was dressed in a dress pants and dress shirt with a sports coat and black dress shoes. That was the first time that I saw the key to my chastity cage dangling from a chain around his neck. I served him a Gentleman Jack on the rocks, while he waited. 

When the doorbell rang promptly at 6 PM, Luke said to us, “It’s showtime. Look sharp.”",2,1737827334.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

Breakfast for the past three months has been 3-egg omelette with spinach, tomatoes and onions, half an avocado and 2 or 3 strawberries, 5 raspberries, 5 blackberries, and a cupped palm-full of blueberries. 

Also read a book titled Life in the Fasting Lane with which I fast on Wednesdays and Thursdays. After dinner on Tuesday night I don’t eat again until Wednesday night and then won’t eat until Thursday night.  This book has helped me understand what I’ve done to my body and system through what I’ve eaten over the past 20-25 years and most likely longer. 

Not on any medication.  I’m a coffeeholic but I dilute my black coffee. 10oz of coffee, 8oz of hot water.  I drink it all day through about 3pm on fasting days.  Actually I drink all day everyday now that I think about it.

If I could sum up in one paragraph how the last four years went, it was far from the ""tradition"" that Lupo, nor what any previous Grandma's customer would expect.  It did follow in the Shogren's tradition of tax fraud, employees receiving no paychecks or lucky enough to receive one that was worthless due to insufficient funds, a bakery that was hardly ever in licensing compliance with MDA as I noticed they were manufacturing breakfast sandwiches containing meat, egg, and cheese in an open production facility at temperatures exceeding 70+ degrees (imagine summertime temperatures) then packaging them and throwing them in a freezer for wholesale distribution absent a license they couldn't obtain. I could literally go on and on for another two paragraphs including the $800+ in PPP loans which were forgiven in his ""related bakeries"" a defaulted SBA loan of $1.3 million, and a few million in judgement from all the Wuollet evictions. Finally, just ask B & W Specialty Coffee about their Grandma's Bakery experience with the Shogren's as they are presently looking at $3,700 in past due accounts receivable, or look at UNBANK who cashed an employee paycheck that bounced almost a year ago for approximately $900 that remains unpaid.  
  
The Shogren's (including their daughter) also included several ""key"" employees at both Grandma's and Wuollet's and let's not forget Grandma's bookkeeper by the name of Amy.  
  
The Shogren's Grandma's legacy ended sometime in September 2024, after the second filed eviction from the property manager where ownership according to MDA records changed to Nonna's Bakery, LLC and then a few weeks later to Blue Sky Bakery, LLC.  According to Stephanie, who I reached out to last week to inquire if the Shogren's are involved responded ""No"" in that Blue Sky Bakery, LLC is new ownership.

P.S. - If you were an employee of Grandma's Bakery or Shogren entity, check to see if your W-2 is real and has the correct EIN number, mine didn't as it tracks back to some cleaning service in Georgia with the last number being altered (via the SSA) and the IRS has no record of my W2 being filed for 2022 when I caught the Shogren's NOT paying my withholding over to the IRS.

1i9sa0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/1i9sa0t/sample_muscle_growth_principlesbeginners_routine/,Sample Muscle Growth Principles/Beginners routine to regain your strength from a stroke,"**Here is a beginners guide to strength training** which should take out one side affect from a stroke and this is not just for functional strength, but all your strength that you lost, we all want our dominate side to be dominate again plus the timing of both arms to be in sync. I recovered much faster than one year, but this guide is for one year timeframe, plus or minus months, depends on how serious you take this. 

**prerequisites:**

1. Get Cardiac Heart Clearance -Make sure you check out your heart. 
2. Get Nerve Study to make sure your nerves are firing in your brain, down your spinal cord , into your extremities. 

**If the outcome is positive this is your green light to proceed if not, then don't.  Follow your doctors orders.** 

  
Ok, were all cleared and ready to go, you should be training at a moderate clip, especially since the brain is very plastic that first year and then it slows down hence the reason gains begin slowing after one year. You really don't want to go slow, to me that is terrible advice, Besides , you need to train hard in the year long window due to plasticity. Remember, you have done all the testing for clearance, you should have confidence you will be ok. But do what you feel is safe. 

**Before I post the approach, here are some things you can expect**. 

1. You are going to be either sore or bloody sore, why because you are tearing muscle fibers , plus some muscles in the arms, legs, back, glutes, neck etc. , are all varying in strength levels because strength loss is not uniform across the body.
2. You are going feel rubbery in the evening after working out a body part , this is expected
3. You will sometimes feel uncoordinated , this expected 
4. You may experience pain especially if you have a light case of spasticity in your back, hip or down the leg or you may feel pain from general lifting and being sore. 
5. You may feel right your dominant side is not your dominate side, this is expected
6. You may feel like your dominate side is slower when pushing reps , there is a 1 -2 second delay vs non-dominate side, this is expected.
7. You may feel like one side is unbalanced when you walk or especially when turning, this is expected 
8. You may feel like your affected side just generally feels weird, this is expected. 
9. You may like to drink post stroke, but it creates walking problems, with this method , this is how I resolved this plus its possible my CNS recovered , the point is , this is how I returned to being fluid when I walk from drinking, at 13 months. 

  
Also, I come from the BB side, these are all principles we go by. I'm not a pro BB if that's what your thinking, just your normal 57 male that had a moderate stroke, with minimal brain damage. I just applied what I learned from BB to Stroke, that's it. If your personal brain damage is too high, then I have no fix for that, so sorry.

Okay, here is how you get your strength back and fully restored based on effort with a progressive overload. **I personally, did this at a moderate effort, not 100% as the poster implied below, just enough to make progress. Remember, this is for beginning pro BB's that can be applied here with just normal folks.** 

*Disclaimer. These are not my words, this how I learned and applied*

I will go through training and diet. I will tell you the principles behind everything that I recommend for you to do, so you can understand why certain things happen, so in the future you can fix problems yourself. Bodybuilding is a very simple and logical endeavor. **Everything that you do has to be logical. Only logical actions will give you results.** Every time that you come across a new principle, always ask yourself it it makes logical sense. If it does not, dump it!

  
TRAINING  
  
Why does a muscle grow? Because it has to adapt. When does it have to adapt? When you expose it to something that it has not done before. When is something that it has not done before? When the muscle is taxed 100%. That's 100% effort. What's 100% effort? When you train to 100% PHYSICAL, not mental failure. So, to make the muscle grow, you have to train with 100% effort otherwise, the muscle will not adapt/grow.  
Now, using the above logic, for a set to be beneficial to your growth, it needs to be 100% effort. So, a 100%  
effort set of an exercise, will make you grow. Then, what is the point to do a second set of that exercise?  
You cannot go more than 100%. The muscle already has been taxed by 100% from the first set, so why should you do a second one? You will just eat into your recovery ability. So, you should only do one set to failure per exercise. Later on, I will describe the training program and how exercises and warm-ups are involved.  
  
A muscle will not grow until it's recovered. The muscle will not begin to recover until the nervous  
system is recovered. It takes roughly 24hours for the nervous system to recover from a workout. Only then  
will the muscle begin to recover and grow. So, you should never train 2 days in a row. Even if you train  
different body parts, you still use the same nervous system. You train 2 days in a row, your nervous system  
recovers, but by the time the muscles begin to, you train again, so the body has to concentrate again on  
recovering the nervous system. A training frequency of 3 days per week (Mon, Wed, Fri) is more than enough. Numerous pros, including myself, train like this offseason for maximum growth.  
  
**The point here is,  this should serve as a general guideline for a training program. You can mix and max your favorite lifts, there is not a perfect set of exercises that everyone should follow. Just pick a plan of exercises and take out your weaknesses , then execute and don't stop until mission is completed, which comes faster than you think. It really is that simple.** 

The following is a great training program that I  
recommend:  
  
**Mon - Chest, Shoulders, Triceps**  
\* Incline press - warm-up sets, 1 work set  
\* Flat flyes - 1 work set  
\* Millitary press - 1 warm-up, 1 work set  
\* Lateral flyes - 1 work set  
\* Rear delt machine - 1 work set  
\* Tricep pushdowns - 1 warm-up, 1 work set  
\* Lying tricep extensions - 1 work-set  
  
**Wed - Quads, Hams, Calves**  
\* Squats - warm-ups, 1 work set  
\* Leg press - work set  
\* Leg extension - work set  
\* Leg curl - warm-up, work set  
\* Stiff leg deadlift - work set  
\* Standing calf raise - work set  
  
**Fri - Abs, Back, Bis**  
\* Rope crunches - warm up, work set  
\* Lat pull down - warm-ups, work set  
\* Deadlift - warm-up, work set  
\* Bent-over rows - work set  
\* Shrugs - work set  
\* Standing BB curls - warm up, work set  
\* Concentration curl - work set  
  
You do a lot of warm-ups for your first exercise of the day. You do one warm-up for the first exercise of  
each body part, only to optimize the firing of the neuropathways. Let's use chest as an example - if for example your max (work set) in the incline press is 3 plates, then you do 2 warm-ups with the bar, 2 warm-ups with one plate, 1 warm-up with 2 plates and then your work set with 3 plates. The work set is a set where you fail at about 6 reps. Every workout, you have to do more reps or increase the weight in that work set (remember, the muscle has to do something that it has not done before). So if one work out you fail with 6 reps, the following nothing less than 7. When you reach 8 reps, the following workout you should do (increase) a weight where you can do minimum 4 reps. Then increase your reps again every workout until you reach 8 again, and so on. Each rep has a tempo of 2-1-1. That is 2 seconds in the negative, one second in the contraction and 1 second in the positive. Then, after you fail in the incline press, you move  
straight to flat flyes. You do not need a warm up  now because your chest is more than warm after you failed on presses. And that's it for chest. The basic routine stays the same. If you want variety, small changes as using DB's instead of BB or doing flat press and incline flies for example, is more than enough variety to keep the muscle 'confused'.

Folks this is how your destroy stroke symptoms in the gym in about a years time, in the grand scheme of life, is this a long time? Who care's if It takes a little longer, just rinse and repeat until you have it resolved, 

**Oh, here is something else, I can carry a coffee from the kitchen to master bedroom , easily now , it did take about a year though to resolve.** 

I look at this way, if stroke is your opponent and he's a mean pissed off Gorilla, you don't go to battle with a lamb do you ?, your gonna get trounced. PT to me is the lamb in this case, folks its common sense. Strength is built in the gym, not PT , sorry to burst your holy grail bubble. To me, that's like walking back into kindergarten after I just graduated with a masters from college. 

**To all you athletes in here , if you  want your life back, go take it and be happy again. Whip that Gorilla's ass, pull a Tyson if you have to , bite his ear off and when you knock him down, kick him just to make sure he doesn't get back up.** 

Peace

1i9s773,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1i9s773/hr_honey/,[HR] Honey,"“Honey! I’m home and we have guests”, the host shouted for his wife as he stepped into his colonial home with two missionaries in tow. Sporting freshly pressed white shirts, the young men eagerly shuffled in and locked the door behind but the host did not seem to notice. He extended his welcome by ushering them into the dining room adjacent to the foyer. When the outsiders sat down, the host fully took in their features. The first stranger was tall with ochre hair and a pointed upper lip while the second was a head shorter with an unenviable hairline.

*They are distinct looking*, the host thought.

“Hi Honey,... and guests, would you like something to drink? We have coffee, tea…,” the hostess glided into the room.

The short man stood up as if to greet her, pulled out a utility knife, and pressed the blade into her without breaking flesh. With the stranger's free hand around her neck, the wife did not budge or breathe. The husband was motionless as though in shock.

“We just want your cash and jewelry. Nobody needs to get hurt”, the lanky one says as he pulls out black zip-ties from his pocket.

“Put these on. Wrists and ankles.”

Anyone else in the house we should know about? Any dogs?”

The two captives did not respond. With their arms and legs bound, they stared across to each other at the dining table.

“Alright, we will just find out then,” the tall stranger pulled out his own blade as he wandered to the living room filled with walnut and oak furniture. The stout stranger stayed in the living room with his blade against the woman’s jugular.

As the tall stranger rounded the corner of the fireplace, he took note of the rich furnishings, the colorful prints of wildlife, and the cast bronze sculptures. *This family had money, there must be jewelry upstairs*, he thought. As he entered a draped-off sunroom, the late afternoon sun blanketed the plethora of flora. There were plants he’d never seen in his life, foreign flowers dabbled every corner. He’d always been lucky in homes with greenery; the man began to salivate with greed as he headed upstairs.

At the top of the landing on the second floor, he noticed the light switches did not work. *Doesn’t matter*, he thought, *I can just use my flashlight*.

As he came to the first bedroom, it was empty. He checked the closet but it was empty too. *Maybe they just moved in.* Across the hall, he tiptoed into the second bedroom to find two children lying on two twin mattresses, seemingly asleep. *Why didn’t they say they had kids!?* The room was empty otherwise, no wardrobe, no carpet, and the light switches don’t work either. The intruder inched towards the closet to discover sets of ordinary clothes, presumably for each child. Nothing hidden on the floor, on the shelf, or around any nooks. Without closing the closet door, he backed out the room trying to not wake the children. *What the fuck*, he mouthed.

As he peered into the final bedroom, he saw a queen-sized mattress lying on the ground in the middle of the room with no sheets or covers. There was no furniture in this room either. 

“What the flying fuck….”, he said in a whisper this time. He did not notice the faint humming that pulsed above him.

There was no furniture to search either; no vanity, no nightstand, no storage at all. The intruder tried to look under the mattress but found only dust. In the closet, he found sets of clothes again; presumably a set for the husband, and another for the wife. Nothing really worth taking. Frazzled and sweaty, he checked the adjacent bathroom for prescriptions he could take. There was nothing but a toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, and a bar of lightly-used soap. He was thorough enough to check underneath the vanity, which was empty. He huffed, slammed shut the vanity cabinet and raced back down the stairs. 

“Where’s your stuff? Where do you keep your money?”

They said nothing and nor did they bat an eye.

“What about the kids up there? Do you care about them?”

The couple remained in a conspiratorial silence.	The stout man looked a little confused but needed to keep an illusion of urgency.

“Dude, check the basement”, he suggested to his partner.

The tall intruder made his way towards the basement with trepidation, flicking light switches as he went. At the last switch, he could see a pinkish-purple glow flicker on from the basement doorway. *They must have a grow-op*, he thought, *I can unload that stuff*! As he descended into an unfinished basement with a moist grip on his blade, he readied his nose for a skunky odor. Instead it smelled like a normal basement, a little musty and waxy. There were rows and rows of young flowering plants on elevated tables hooked to a hydroponic system. The man sniffed each plant species up close to make sure the marijuana was not being crossbred. *Is that even possible?*, he stood for a second before jumping to his next thought. *What the hell is going on in the house?*

As he walked around, he noticed a wet corner with a sizable floor drain. *Pretty useful for grow-ops*. He assumed the wet area was just residual water from a leak. In another corner, he saw a workbench below a neat pegboard full of tools. Next to it, he recognized a gas cylinder for welding, but not the glossy black box about the size of a small vending machine. At his eye level, he could see that there was a little hexagonal window into the box. With a measured approach, the man glanced around the basement to make sure nothing could ambush him. When he peered through the window, the 3D-printer was in the throes of its whirrs and whines. The machine was printing an elongated oval gasket, sheeny with a texture that looked plastic. He was mesmerized by the machine's gooey, golden extrusions, the bed surface sunk a little with each printed layer. *Is this machine worth something?*, he had no idea, *300 dollars? 3000? We can probably lift this thing…*

When he went back up the stairs, he could see that the husband was convulsing on the floor in the dining room. *Shit!*, he ran over. The shorter intruder was now panicking with his hands pressing his thin hair backwards again and again.

“He just started to shake! And fell to the floor, I didn’t touch him! What the fuck, man….”

“Is he on something? Does he need to be on something?” the tall man asked the wife who was still restrained in her seat. She acted like nothing was wrong and ignored the pleas.

“What the fuck is wrong with you people?!”, with no reply again.

Suddenly, the husband lunged up, tore open his shirt, and hugged the shorter man.

“What the fuck? Get the fuck off me!” The smaller man’s confusion morphed into fright after he realized he had dropped his knife.

At that moment, the wife turned her head and snapped free from the zip-ties.

“Hungry?” The woman called out to the kids who stood silently behind the tall man. The children nodded in unison.

“Don’t touch me! I’ll cut your kids, bitch!”

Before he could hurl another insult, his partner began to scream with jagged breaths.

“Arrrrgggghhhh, whaaaaaahhhhhh!”

The starch white shirt became redder and wetter with each scream. The tall man could see that his partner had crimson bees crawling all over him. As the man howled, the husband held the intruder in place. No matter how much the man struggled, he could not break free from the drone-like family man. As he fainted from the blood loss and pain, his chest pulsed with an unseen frenzy. His corpse signaled to the husband to stop the hug and let the body drop. The tall man finally saw what he had stumbled into that evening. With his dress shirt opened, the husband revealed an oval cavity below his sternum to his belly button, coated with glistening blood. At the plasticine rim of the opening, dozens of bees danced on his gashed torso. His exposed organs respirated with shimmering strands of mucus and honey. Flesh-pocked combs lined his flesh walls with pink larvae, a human-hive symbiosis.

He’d seen enough. The tall man bolted past the children behind them without hesitation. He flung open the backdoor, ran past nest boxes in the backyard, and disappeared into the woods; the summer night air syrupy in his lungs.

“When was the last time you saw your friend?” The detective questioned the twitchy man while typing.

“Six days ago, he said he was picking something up from this address… from craigslist”, the man passed over a note as he had rehearsed.

“Do you know who he was meeting? Was he buying something?”

“I don’t know, but all I know is that he went to that address.”

“Do you know if your friend is involved in any illicit substances? Does he disappear sometimes?”

“I don’t know… I just know he went there and I haven’t seen or heard from him since. It’s been almost a week, man.”

“Alright, sir. He’s probably fine… I’ll have officers do a wellness check and look into that address. I can’t promise anything, people just up and leave sometimes.”

The tall man shook the detective’s hand and took off as soon as possible, feigning lateness to an afternoon shift.

“I’ll be in touch if I find anything.”

Seeing that it was only a short detour from his home, the detective drove to the tipped address that evening. Cruising with his window open, he breezed to a stop across the street and pretended to read his phone. When he looked up and around, he could see only well-kept colonial homes and meticulously manicured gardens. Looking into the alleged house, there was a man and woman waltzing in the living room. In the adjacent sunroom, he could see their children watering plants one by one. *Obviously, there was nothing out of the ordinary.* The detective relaxed as a bee landed on his arm perched on the ledge of the car door. *Inner peace*, he thought.

He decided it was time to leave as the family sat down together for dinner, letting out a sigh as he started the car. He lived just a ten minute drive away and he was happy to be part of a protective community, going above and beyond his duties. 

The detective’s home was newer and designed as a mid-century bungalow, plenty big for him alone. After parking, he began to perform his nightly ritual of locking up and shutting blinds. He was too tired to eat anything and so he downed a glass of water before brushing his teeth and flossing. Afterwards, he sluggishly made his way to his unlit bedroom ready to pass out. Sitting at the foot of his mattress, he unbuttoned his dress shirt and flopped down on his back. He was fond of his spartan style, no lamps, no shelving, no bed frame; he had nothing but the harmonic thrums in his fluttering bowel.",1,1737826464.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I was head over heels for this girl for 9 months and it was great for the first 6 or so. I made a couple of mistakes in the beginning, all of which she communicated about and I resolved the concerns soon after she demonstrated. Toward the end I’m not sure what happened but she slowly just fell out of love with me. She would forget about our dates, cancel plans I had made well in advance for ones her friends mad the day of, ignore me, admit she wouldn’t listen when I talk about my hobbies, and just wouldn’t show up for me when I needed it. This was very uncharacteristic of her. She went from someone who would drop anything for me if I needed it, to someone who wouldn’t leave a coffee date with a friend to come help me when I sustained an injury and needed serious help. I understand people fall out of love, and it’s not even that I miss her much anymore, my main issue, is how do I repair your self esteem after? She made me feel so unworthy of love and care at the end and I didn’t recognize it at the time bc I loved her so much that I just kept forgiving, until she left me, and that’s when I realized all of the nonsense that was going on.

Ah, the classic showdown between the Boston University Terriers and the Bucknell Bison. It's a matchup that promises all the excitement of a lukewarm cup of tea on a rainy day. But hey, that's college basketball for you!

Let's dive into the numbers, shall we? The Terriers are priced at 1.89 on DraftKings, while the Bison are slightly favored at 1.93. It's a tight race, like watching two turtles sprint towards a lettuce leaf. The spread is equally thrilling, with Boston at -1.5 and Bucknell at +1.5, both priced at 1.91. It's like betting on which side of the toast will land butter-side down.

Now, let's talk about the total points. The line is set at 126.0, and both the Over and Under are priced at 1.91. It's almost as if the bookmakers are daring us to find excitement in this predictably unpredictable matchup.

Given that underdogs in basketball only win about 25% of the time, and considering the razor-thin odds, my money is on the Bucknell Bison to pull off a minor upset. Why? Because nothing screams ""college basketball"" like an underdog story, and the Bison at 1.95 on MyBookie.ag are just tempting enough to make you feel like a betting genius when they inevitably win by a single point.

So, grab your popcorn, or maybe just a cup of coffee to stay awake, and watch as the Bison charge their way to a narrow victory. Or don't. It's your Saturday afternoon, after all.",1,1737826272.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

First HM in the books

Hi బొందs, this my first Half Marathon (2:22:40). I wanted to push more and reduce the my pace but as I wanted not to push too hard and build mileage so did this, I’m really proud of myself and happy, if I could do this, anyone can do this. 
I had a heavy breakfast ( 2 kiwi 🥝, cereal, black coffee) and during the run bought a bottle at the 11th km and started hydrating myself, had a half mars bar at the 17th km and rest of it at the end. Actually today’s my track day but as the sun came out and as the weather was perfect I planned for a long run but that turned to be my first HM attempt and completely nailed it for my standards. My hands are shaking as I’m typing this, please ignore my English as I’m unable to think straight.  Am I cooked with that 95 hour recovery?

Long time lurker, first time poster. I’m an only child (40F), child-free and married last year to my partner of 15 years (49M). Mother (71) lives nearby and is in good cognitive shape. Not only that, a few years ago she worked with a lawyer to get her POA together and other important living will docs written, discussed each thoroughly with me (including asking for permission if I was willing to take certain responsibilities on), signed and notarized. 

My father (71) and stepmother (59) live 3 hours away. They have no investments to speak of, and have lived above their means for decades. They run a small business that he refuses to fold because it feeds his ego, but costs them more than it brings in. 

Dad began to show signs of cognitive decline over the pandemic and they’re still struggling to get a proper diagnosis of what is really happening. Dysautonomia episodes started about 2018/2019. Over the pandemic it got worse. He would pay bills twice in a month, buy big ticket items impulsively, episodes of paranoia, and general mania. Stepmom told me he began to lose bladder function at some point in 2020. 
He’s on a cocktail of various pills for his blood pressure, depression, anxiety, recently got in Ozempic (thank god) to bring his weight down under 300lbs, and now works with a psychiatrist, psychologist, and various other doctors. 

Stepmom got diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer 2 years ago, but won’t get it operated on because she’s phobic of anything medical. Recently got diagnosed as autistic, which explains a bit more. 

I’ve begged and pleaded with them for years to PLEASE begin to plan while they still can / are able to. I can’t handle their health directives without their input, or try to manage their business without decent records. Two years ago, I bought an expensive work book, binder and planner that could organize and record important documents / preferences / family history / general life planning. Both refuse to touch it. 

I speak to my father once a week. Have to take everything they share with a grain of salt, because I’m not sure what’s truth or what they can’t admit to themselves. So much denial of the inevitable. 

About a year ago, I decided to emotionally distance myself from their problems once I realized it was eating me whole. I refuse to be their backup or last resort. I don’t have the financial means to help them if Dad needs a nurse or if (god forbid) my stepmom’s untreated cancer goes terminal. 

I’m mad because they continue to give lip service to things they intend to change in their lives to address the reality of their situations, but never make any moves. But want me to visit and pretend everything is just fine. 

I know I’m not alone here, based on other’s stories. I almost feel like going no-contact is my only resort eventually to get them to wake up and smell the coffee and take responsibility for their life planning - but I’m wracked with the guilt that would come with that. 

I guess I’m sharing this to gain perspective from others. How do you preserve your own sanity when you are a compassionate person but don’t want to enable toxic cycles of behavior? ",13,1737825649.0,AgingParents,4,1.0,False

I started my collection a couple months ago, I hope to keep it growing! I am particularly infatuated with vintages. 

Not all of these are full bottles, that would be nuts (and expensive). Most of the reviews are from samplers or decants I am testing to then see if they're full bottle worthy. 

I would love to hear your thoughts if you have tested any of these as well! Enjoy reading! 

**TOM FORD**

*Tobacco Oud:* The opening is very boozy, then: woody, tobacco-y, and spicy. It is a tad smokey, as well. I really enjoy the smooth sweetness from the tobacco. I want to emphasize that smooth quality, I think that is what made this fragrance a stand-out. Now, bear with me through the following words: I like the *concept* of liquor in fragrances. If “cognac,” or “scotch” is mentioned as being in a fragrance, my ears perk up. The problem is, typically when the note of a certain drink is used, it’s found in the opening of a fragrance (the top), so your shot with an immediate blast of alcohol when you first spray it. This has been an area of dislike for me, because most fragrances are alcohol based, leading my brain to believe that I am being with a poorly crafted perfume, when in reality, it’s to opposite. I guess what I am trying to say, in short, is that I don’t care for boozy notes in fragrances as much as I care for the idea of them. All that aside, I am in love with what this fragrance becomes. Smooth (there’s that word again), sensual, tobacco-filled, slightly oriental, and masculine. Longevity is great and, surprisingly the projection was to my standards, not being to beastly. **(8/10)**

**CoSTUME NATIONAL**

*Scent Intense:* A bright, fresh, sweet, and green opening. It had a very clean quality to it, I really enjoyed it. The florals make their way in quickly, deepening the scent, which may also be credited to the cinnamon. The longevity is around 6 hours, and the projection is not beastly. The dry down is very amber-y. It was sensual and pleasing, though, for me, uninteresting. I enjoyed the opening better. **(4/10)**

**FRAGRANCE OF IRELAND**

*Patrick:* A stunning green fougere, I’m in awe of this fragrance at first spray. The green notes on top are completely timeless and crisp. After a moment, there is a deeper green scent that comes through. It may be the fern or oak moss, which is later trailed by a hint of carnation. The florals add their powdery, classic touch after a couple minutes, emphasizing the timelessness of this fragrance. Once that fades, it settles into that nice, dark green, slightly bitter aroma. It doesn’t last forever, but listen- The PRICE on this fragrance makes any complaint non-existent. It is wonderfully *classic.* **(9/10)**

**GIORGIO BEVERLY HILLS**

*Extraordinary (original formula):* This deep golden juice is BEAUTIFUL. I also have the current formula (from 2021), and the difference between their colors is night and day. The opening is a blast of aldehydes, florals, something musty (in the most pleasant way), spices, and slightly orange-like. It’s a true chypre, reminiscent of a bygone era. Once settled, the honey comes out, and though I usually loathe honey in fragrance, it works nicely here. Though, of course, isn’t suitable for all occasions, I enjoy it. It follows the same lines as the original Givency *Gentleman*, or Hugo Boss *No.1*, both fragrances I adore. The deeper the dry down, the better this fragrance becomes. The base is smoothed out to perfection and blended like no other. Longevity is great. **(9/10)** 

**DEMETER**

*Pipe Tobacco Cologne:* An extremely linear fragrance. You are met with a dry, sweet tobacco note that remains throughout the entirety of this fragrance, however there is also a slight spice-filled quality to the fragrance, one that I did not enjoy. Luckily, the strength of the initial blast fades rather quickly, leaving that faint funkiness to be a thing of moments ago. Overall, this is a realistic pipe tobacco fragrance. That’s it. It doesn’t have wonderful performance, but for the price, who can complain? The value for these bottles is kind on the wallet. **(2/10)**

**CALVIN KLEIN**

*Obsession for Men (original formula):* THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS GAVE ME A COMPLIMENT WHILE WEARING THIS, IMMEDIATE TEN OUT OF TEN!!! As head over heels I was (am), here is a more tasteful review: The initial blast is bright and citrus-filled, but soon after you get a smooth sweetness. That lavender is *delicious*. As the spices surround it, you get a smooth, clean, and seductive fragrance. It has a classic feel to it, but not so much so that it minimizes its sensuality. The base notes are hard to identify individually, but that speaks volume about the quality of blend. The dry down was wonderful. The longevity is incredible and the projection was good enough for her to smell, so it’s good enough for me. **(10/10)**

*Eternity for Men (original formula):* The opening is masculine, fresh, citrus filled, but also green and aromatic. The green notes are particularly favorable. Hints of sweetness work their way in, most likely due to the florals, though the fragrance remains aromatic and slightly herbaceous. The dry down is, like *Obsession*, extremely well blended. I was smelling myself for hours. The longevity is 8+ hours, though I cannot speak for the current formula, and the projection was good! **(8/10)**

**MIHAN AROMATICS**

*Sienna Brume:* The first blast contains juniper berry, coconut, and cucumber; very light, breezy, and fresh. Soon after, some spiciness comes through. I definitely get a slight sun screen adjacent smell, most likely due to the coconut, but it isn’t overbearing. This fragrance is definitely reminiscent of somewhere tropical and near the ocean. It has a sea breeze likeness to it.   The dry down was not too far off from the opening, just more faint and possibly more woody. The longevity was around six hours long and the projection is pretty good for the first three hours. Though I wouldn’t often reach for it, its uniqueness is intriguing. **(4/10)**

**ESTEÈ LAUDER** 

*Cinnabar (vintage formula):* That is some STRONG juice. The opening is full of aldehydes, citrus, spices, and light florals. The cloves and spices are strong, though what else could be so fitting for a fragrance, given its namesake. The oriental notes come through, slowly, adding some nice nuance to the fragrance. Again, this is some powerful stuff. I cannot speak to the current formula, but if you get your hands on the vintage- be prepared. I’m not huge on labeling fragrances, but I can confidently say that it leans pretty feminine. Longevity: pretty much eternal. Projection: powerful. I cannot see myself reaching for this often but it’s a special fragrance, that’s for sure. **(6/10)**

**TED LAPIDUS** 

*Lapidus Pour Homme:* I am going to be honest, pin-pointing the individual notes in this fragrance is no easy task. I will start with what I know: this fragrance is a powerhouse! It is reminiscent of the classic, masculine fragrances we know and love (at least I do). I was able to smell honey, which works well with the other notes. I really enjoy the aromatic notes in this fragrance. It is so many things: sweet, musky, masculine, warm, cool, citrusy, aromatic, a bit herbaceous, slightly floral, woody, and smooth. Overall, I love it. That dry down… WHEW! Fantastic. I wish I could give a more descriptive rundown of this fragrance, for that I apologize. The longevity is eternal and the projection was heavy for my liking. **(9/10)**

  
**LOUIS VUITTON:**

*Cactus Garden:* I GOT MY HANDS ON IT! A bright, vivacious opening! Almost immediately, it gets a hint of sweet freshness, reminding one of green gardens, just lightly dewed. The lemon grass makes its way in, adding some bitter citrus to the already fresh scent. The mate deepens the scent, giving it a darker, slightly funkier dry down. It almost becomes a bit sour? I enjoy the first two phases of this fragrance more than the dry down, I would have hoped it stayed more aromatic, slightly sweet, and fresh. The projection is intimate and the longevity is mediocre. Shamefully, I’m more excited to now own this fragrance than I am to actually wear it. **(7/10)**

  
**PENHALIGONS:**

*The Tragedy of Lord George:* A perfect gentleman’s fragrance; very posh, timeless, and reminds me of a gentleman’s lounge, though I’ve never been inside one. You know, the ones in a high society British Gentleman’s Club? The movies I’ve seen them in seem to fit the bill pretty well. There is a soapy, boozy, amber quality throughout this fragrance. Though tobacco isn’t part of this composition, the combination of notes creates a pipe/cigar-like feel. In the 1998 Parent Trap, the Grandfather is described smelling like, “peppermint and pipe tobacco.” Again neither notes are present, but the composition creates the image of a man such as him. The performance is good! **(8/10)**  

  
*Halfeti Leather:* I liked the strength of the opening, which, after a minute, settles into a much quieter fragrance (or I went nose blind). The opening had some lovely notes, there was definitely this overarching aroma of leather, but the lighter notes, such as: bergamot, fruits, and maybe lavender, all dissipated quickly. The scent soon becomes smooth and woody, with the support of spice. I was able to pick up on some florals, which added nuance to the fragrance. They weren’t prevalent, but a very nice addition to the blend. Later, on the dry down it smelled very similarly to Dolce & Gabbana’s *Pour Homme Intenso,* a fragrance I wasn’t crazy about. Longevity was a bit longer than *Halfeti*, at around 6-7 hours. **(5/10)**

  
**LE LABO:**

*Baie 19:* When I first sprayed this, it smelled like all the other Le Labo fragrances, containing a very heavy “pencil shaving” note, which I do not dislike, though I wish was not the case for a variety of fragrances. I really nave no other way to explain what their commonalities smell like, so that’ll have to do. Luckily, I wore this a second time, understanding it more. Having had the pleasure of smelling dried, pure juniper berries, *Baie 19* does capture that essence well. There is something almost aquatic or costal rocky cliff-like about it, as well. The patchouli is evident after the initial spray as well. The longevity is good, and the projection isn’t too beastly. It is very linear, not so complex as other fragrances. It was good, though nothing special. **(4/10)**

  
**BOIS 1920**

*Vetiver Ambrato:* I often find citruses to be dominant on the tops of fragrances. I think *Vetiver Ambrato* did a wonderful job at allowing the aromatic, herbaceous, fougere-adjacent notes of galbanum and artemisia to shine. The bergamot and lemon still make an appearance, though not too garishly. Later, the warmth of florals and spices make for a classic gentleman’s styled fragrance. I enjoyed the dry down, it was warm but not suffocating. The combination of vetiver, mixed with ambers, finished with a touch of vanilla was simply intoxicating. It almost had a tobacco-like aroma, a note I am fond of. The projection was sufficient and the longevity was great. **(8/10)**

  
**EIGHT & BOB**

*Memories de Mustique:* A bright, bergamot, citrus-filled, orange blossom opening. The white florals in here are light and breezy, the way I like them. There is something ever so slightly animalic that creeps its way in, adding a bit of depth and roughness to the smell. I think it may be from the sambac jasmine? It has feminine qualities, but I love it, I think it is one of Eight & Bob’s best fragrances I’ve smelled so far. If you enjoy white florals with the slight tang of orange, this is incredible. It lasted 8 hours on me and the projection was favorable. I could 100% see myself wearing this in the summer, especially on a warm vacation. **(7/10)**

*The Original:* Pepper, lemon, and woods make themselves known in the opening. It has a very fresh, spicy, even *cooling*, quality to it. This fragrance feels classic and gentleman-like, but is still wearable today. It isn’t a fougere, but it has the same feel to it. The ambergris note, though not natural, gives the slight undertone of an aquatic theme. The woods are nice, deepening the scent. It isn’t ground-breaking or new, but it is solid. The projection was good and so was the longevity. I can see myself wearing this in the future. **(7/10)**

*Champs de Provence:* Smooth, juicy pear and citrus head this fragrance, creating a fresh, bright, clean, and refreshing aroma. Florals begin to arrive after a minute, twisting the fragrance into something a bit deeper. The florals stay pretty light, not leaning into the heavy potential of rose, rather leaning in favor of the white florals. The next change in the fragrance was unfavorable to my nose. The base notes listed include: ambroxan, musk, and mate. I’m not sure which of those is was, but mixed with the sweetness of the florals, it created a slight stinginess, that reminiscent of body odor. Though it subsides, the transition was disagreeable. When the fragrance reaches its dry down, the smell reminded me of what it tastes like to eat a raspberry flavored Pez, with an added chemically cleaning spray. I realize that is strangely specific, but thats what I got.

  
**MEO FUSCIUNI**

*Odor 93:* Wow, that opening was something else. I was pleasantly surprised, which is one of my favorite things to be when spraying a fragrance for the first time. *Odor 93* is a fantastic example of how to use florals without leaning too powdery. The use of white florals (tuberose & narcissus) is truly intoxicating and alluring. They have an innocence to them, but it leaves you wanting more. I almost caught a slight minty/medicinal note on the opening, which was strange, but interesting, and not unwelcome. The juxtaposition of the freshly sweet florals against the woody undertones, which become more prevalent on the dry down, makes for a beautiful dance of aroma. There are hints of spices that linger in the air, though not heavy, but essential to the effect of this: *odor*… see what I did there. There is also a slight smokiness. Truthfully, this fragrance isn’t one that seems right for me. I immensely enjoyed it, but not to wear personally. The projection is great and the longevity is the same. **(7/10)** 

*Little Song:* The coffee is definitely noticeable, but the spicy, fresh notes on top are a nice burst of energy before getting into the smoother notes. I *think*, key word “think,” that the pink pepper is what I am mainly smelling on the top. After about five minutes, the coffee makes its way in. Mixed with florals, it makes for a pleasant smell. The rose is also present. I put it on right before going to work, went to my night shift, and after getting home (6 hours later) I could not smell it. It was fine while it lasted, not my favorite in the world. **(3/10)**

**MAISON CRIVELLI**

*Papyrus Moléculaire:* The opening was fresh. Then, it reminded me of something… I couldn’t put my finger on it- Oh, wait. I remember: *Santal 33.* Truthfully, that realization worried me. Here is my take on their similarities; The *concept* of *Santal 33* was more appealing than its execution, in my opinion, not to mention, everyone and their mom was wearing it at its peak. Because *Papyrus Moleculaire* isn’t *trying* to be anything, other than what it is at face value, it’s easier to accept. I also enjoyed the smell a bit better, there was a slight aquatic quality that I thought blend nicely. I cannot speak to what pure sandalwood smells like, but if it’s the note that I found similar in both fragrances, its not my favorite, it smells synthetic/processed; like pencil shavings (I am hoping that it’s a synthetic version of sandalwood because I really want to like the authentic stuff). There is a creaminess to *Papyrus Moleculaire* that was pleasant. I think the overall smell does a really great job at portraying the idea of actual papyrus. The dry down was smooth, slightly sweeter. It was pleasant. Performance was good, incredible longevity and acceptable projection. **(7/10)**

**J.F. SCHWARZLOSE BERLIN**

*Leder 6:* There is a hint of sweet freshness on the opening, though that fades rather quickly. The saffron is faint, and the leather is there. The milky vanilla reveals itself hastily, giving you a smooth, gourmand aroma. I am glad the leather and saffron ease us into the sweetness. There is something, the closer you smell to the skin, that I do not care for. I can’t figure out what it is, but the further my face was to my wrist, the better. It may have actually been the potent vanilla I was smelling up close. Maybe the styrax? Though, I don’t know what styrax smells like. The jury is still out on that one. Anyways, the dry down after 6+ hours is very beautiful and intimate, sweet and smooth. I liked it, though only later on; not enough, however, to purchase a full bottle. Projection is minute and the longevity is great. **(3/10)**",3,1737825524.0,fragrance,0,1.0,False

About one month ago my kitchen aid fridge, which we purchased used 8 months earlier, starting putting out a PO error code but never actually stopped cooling. The error persisted for about a week prompting me to replace the main control board. That solved the issue and thought all was fine until….one month later while drinking my morning coffee I hear the dreaded noise and see the fridge display putting out the PO code again. 

Now for the last 2 hours the display has been cycling on and off and making the reboot noise but appears to still be cooling just fine. I’m sure I could just buy the same $250 part and replace it again to address the issue in the interim but there’s one other part that’s confusing me. My neighborhood had a brief (on/off) power outage yesterday AM. There weren’t any negative impacts to anything and the fridge was not putting out the PO error yesterday. 

My question to the group, is the fridge the problem or is the outlet the fridge is plugged into the actual culprit and I’m going to have to keep replacing control boards every month. 

We are okay with buying a new fridge if needed but I don’t want to go down that road if the outlet is going to damage the new fridge.

1i9rs0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1i9rs0v/they_wont_prepare/,They won’t prepare…,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I’m an only child (40F), child-free and married last year to my partner of 15 years (49M). Mother (71) lives nearby and is in good cognitive shape. Not only that, a few years ago she worked with a lawyer to get her POA together and other important living will docs written, discussed each thoroughly with me (including asking for permission if I was willing to take certain responsibilities on), signed and notarized. 

My father (71) and stepmother (59) live 3 hours away. They have no investments to speak of, and have lived above their means for decades. They run a small business that he refuses to fold because it feeds his ego, but costs them more than it brings in. 

Dad began to show signs of cognitive decline over the pandemic and they’re still struggling to get a proper diagnosis of what is really happening. Dysautonomia episodes started about 2018/2019. Over the pandemic it got worse. He would pay bills twice in a month, buy big ticket items impulsively, episodes of paranoia, and general mania. Stepmom told me he began to lose bladder function at some point in 2020. 
He’s on a cocktail of various pills for his blood pressure, depression, anxiety, recently got in Ozempic (thank god) to bring his weight down under 300lbs, and now works with a psychiatrist, psychologist, and various other doctors. 

Stepmom got diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer 2 years ago, but won’t get it operated on because she’s phobic of anything medical. Recently got diagnosed as autistic, which explains a bit more. 

I’ve begged and pleaded with them for years to PLEASE begin to plan while they still can / are able to. I can’t handle their health directives without their input, or try to manage their business without decent records. Two years ago, I bought an expensive work book, binder and planner that could organize and record important documents / preferences / family history / general life planning. Both refuse to touch it. 

I speak to my father once a week. Have to take everything they share with a grain of salt, because I’m not sure what’s truth or what they can’t admit to themselves. So much denial of the inevitable. 

About a year ago, I decided to emotionally distance myself from their problems once I realized it was eating me whole. I refuse to be their backup or last resort. I don’t have the financial means to help them if Dad needs a nurse or if (god forbid) my stepmom’s untreated cancer goes terminal. 

I’m mad because they continue to give lip service to things they intend to change in their lives to address the reality of their situations, but never make any moves. But want me to visit and pretend everything is just fine. 

I know I’m not alone here, based on other’s stories. I almost feel like going no-contact is my only resort eventually to get them to wake up and smell the coffee and take responsibility for their life planning - but I’m wracked with the guilt that would come with that. 

I guess I’m sharing this to gain perspective from others. How do you preserve your own sanity when you are a compassionate person but don’t want to enable toxic cycles of behavior? ",10,1737825380.0,dementia,5,1.0,False

1i9roxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/1i9roxi/amway_encounter/,AMWAY ENCOUNTER,"My gf was approached by a woman while she was working at her job in the mall. I wasn’t there but they started having a conversation about life and what my girl wants to do. The lady had said her and her husband own multiple businesses and were interested in marketing. With me being involved in business and interested in (proper) networking, my lady gave this lady my number. The lady never said anything about mlm or amway. I wasn’t contacted by the lady’s husband and he we exchanged a few texts and a phone call regarding networking and he explained to me how he was involved with a man named Mike Harvey and had a collection of entrepreneurs that frequently met to discuss a higher cause he never said anything about mlm or amway. I wasn’t very familiar with mlm and had never heard of amway. I met him for coffee the next day (yesterday) and he asked me a bunch of questions and we started talking about life. He then got into discussing the importance of having your spouse/ partner involved with everything that you do regarding business. I disagreed as dynamics in relationships are different, and my girl is definitely not interested in business or has an entrepreneurial spirit. He then started telling me about amway and (network marketing) which I guess is a term to rename mlm so that people don’t get the idea of mlm. I didn’t really understand where all of this was going, he sent me a video called (the rise of the entrepreneur.) which is a video of business moguls and billionaires talking good about mlm. I told him I’d meet with him again but after doing research and understanding what mlm is, I find it really sad that so many people get roped into stuff like this. It is disingenuous to promote a product that you don’t actually believe in and use psychological tactics to try to get people to understand a false reality. His whole thing was “why would you try to start your own business when you can attach yourself to an already proven model.”
I even asked him if he had made money from amway and he said he hasn’t made much but plans to replace his amway income with his software engineer income by the time he is 35.

His only goal was to get my to start my own amway shop so that he could make commission on every product I sell “eternally.”

This happened in Denver CO his name was John Cornish and his wife- Julia Cornish based out of Littleton CO.

I didn’t meet the wife as she had other things going on.
They were smart people which was surprising considering they are so into “network marketing”

I learned a lot yesterday and certainly was never going to entertain his bs or set up an amway shop.

These people are scammers and do not have your best interest at heart even if it seems like it.
Their approach was odd and cult like, but I met with him just to see what was up and this is what happened.
Be careful if you get approached by people from amway or other marketing companies. You will get fucked over at the end of the day and if you fall into it, you will become an “ambassador” for these companies and be expected to go approach random people and bite at their vulnerabilities just like they tried to do.",7,1737825165.0,antiMLM,5,1.0,False

3. Stop posting photos with you and other dudes. It doesn't matter if they're your brother, cousin, friend, etc. Just stop it.

4. Liking food isn't a personality trait. Every human likes food. I've never met someone that says ""Nah, food is not really my thing.""

5. If I had a dollar everytime I saw ""Key to my heart is sushi/tacos"" I'd have enough to take every girl who didn't say this out for a meal that isn't sushi or tacos.

6. ""Can't live without coffee"" and thinking dirty martinis make you sophisticated. Everyone drinks coffee. It's not a personality trait, it's caffeine addiction.

6. Stop mentioning Friends or The Office. ""I quote too much from Friends"" Thank you for letting me know, it's gonna be fun hearing the same voice lines from every girl. P.S. it's probably the reason I'll never see those shows.

I had a weird reaction to (supposedly from) medication prescribed to me… though the drug eruption rash didn’t start until either one week after taking an antibiotic (random kidney infection) or two weeks after taking gabapentin. 

I went for bloodwork and they haven’t released my results which makes me hopeful they finally found something. Either Lupus (I asked for testing) or *dun dun dun* cancer? Probably neither but I’ll keep y’all posted. 

I spoke with my doctor as well as a physician assistant and like two different pharmacists and they all agreed a “drug eruption” rash should have started within a day or two of taking the new medications. 

I’m on prednisone for the rash and I have one dose left … and it’s still itchy!!!! 

Anywho the Fibro flare I had lasted exactly 14 days. 4 visits to my clinic and 3 ER visits later I am still so unsure of my diagnosis. I believe it is fibromyalgia but I can feel (in my bones) that it’s something else as well!!! 

To top it all off! There’s like two feet of snow outside that needs to be shovelled but I just want to have a coffee and sit in a cute cafe.

Does this combo of catechins and caffeine actually work in terms of providing modest benefits for fat loss? Let's say you drink 2 cups of matcha and one cup of coffee as a pre-workout and then 2 more cups of matcha during the rest of the day.

I’m nauseated and so so congested. I’m miserable and can’t even find the strength to get up right now. 

I’ve been powering through the last three days, doing what needs to be done and even deep cleaning our bathroom, toddlers room, doing some laundry etc,  but today I am so so tired and exhausted. 

Husband kindly made me and the 16 mo old breakfast in bed, and my coffee, and I got her teeth brushed, changed her, all the necessities done but other than that, all I’ve done is put on Bear in the Big Blue house and lay in bed while she plays with some toys. I got her down for a nap at 9:00, and thankfully I napped for an hour too, but now I’m just even more exhausted upon getting up. 

I feel like I should be doing more, and I’m usually a little to no screen time mom, so this really makes me feel horrible. I just don’t have the energy to get up and play with her or do activities. I feel like I’m failing her in a way. She seems fine, and of course isn’t minding the screen time and is mostly focused on her toys, so that’s alright but I just feel so lazy. It’s hard to chase her around right now and it doesn’t feel right to keep her in the room with me all day. 

I’ve taken everything I can that’s pregnancy safe to try to “treat” my symptoms, but nothing is working. Robotussin helps for about 2 hours, and then I’m back to feeling like crap, and I’m afraid to take so much of this stuff during pregnancy. Now husband is complaining he feels “the same way I do”  but left to take a bathroom break, where I found him jerking off. 

I’m literally depleted today, and though I’m thankful he helped with breakfast, I’m still just like.. wtf?! I’m so irritated he would say “I feel the same way you do, I feel just as bad, etc” but have the energy to go jerk off to porn in the bathroom while I’m too sick to even get out of bed and do what I normally do. 

I don’t even want to address the porn issue right now, or the jerking off because I’m just too damn tired. I’m too fucking tired and I feel so bad I just can’t today. 

Please tell me the child will be fine while I rest. Please tell me one day of screen time just for me to rest isn’t going to mess up her development. Please tell me I’m not a horrible mom. I genuinely can’t stop obsessing over this. I can’t stop feeling like crap about it. 

I don’t know what else there is for me to do. I feel so horrible.

I'm so glad to have discovered this sub, and I’d love to hear your thoughts if you have any advice or insights about my path. Sorry for the long read, and in advance for any poor language, I'm not a native English speaker. 

I spent my years from 19 to 28 building a menstrual cup company, which unfortunately went bankrupt last year. It was never really successful, but I held on to the idea for far too long. While it didn’t work out in the end, I did manage to secure a design patent, get the product retailed in pharmacies, and collaborate with our national Save the Children group to donate one cup for every one sold. That part it felt meaningful, I’ve always been passionate about menstrual health, equality, and sustainability, and it gave me the chance to work on something I believed contributed to a better world

To support myself during that time, I worked as a social media manager (focusing on copywriting, content creation, strategy, and leading courses for organizations) and as a wedding photographer. But over time, the entrepreneurial world, pitches, competition, and chasing investors, began to feel superficial to me.   
  
I started to feel suffocated, and I realized I had to step away and find something more aligned with my values, which is a good thing to find out, BUT that has also left me feeling like I wasted my youth. 

I’m now studying for a bachelor’s degree in biology. I’ve also become a certified wild edible plants expert through the national mycology and foraging association. While studying, I work as a marketer in the specialty coffee and fine chocolate world, which I enjoy because I love exploring flavors and learning the nuances of tasting. But I don't see myself as a marketer in the future, I don't have the energy to keep up with trends and algorithms, I love the business, but the whole digital world exhausts me.

In my free time, I’m doing my yoga teacher training, volunteering with various nature conservation organizations, and writing, learning, camping, reading. 

Here’s my challenge: I feel like I constantly need to keep moving. I get bored easily and feel trapped in rigid life situations. I’m naturally curious and love diving into new interests, but I struggle to picture myself in any single job for the next 3, 5, or 10 years.

My dream is to host mindfulness retreats, where I can teach yoga, promote connectedness with nature,  hold tastings of chocolate/coffee and help people live more meaningful lives while also contributing to nature conservation. I’d also love to give lectures about plants and nature or lead guided walking tours. But I don’t see a clear way to turn these ideas into sustainable income, and that uncertainty makes me feel lost and sad. 

I’m also frustrated because I feel like I’m constantly shifting directions, jumping from one thing to another, and never really giving myself the time to excel in any one area.

Any thoughts, ideas, or advice on how to navigate this would mean the world to me!

The book would have been published 90s-early 2000s. It was a factual/informative book for children and features little tabs you could open with information underneath. The tabs were frequent and often small, and closed over nicely again if i remember correctly, they didn't stick up. The theme of the book was materials and trade of goods. A particular page i remember well is of a section of a hull of a wooden (old fashioned) trade ship where we the reader can see into the storage areas of the ship. There are wooden containers/boxes of goods, and with the cotton box for example, you can open the flap to read information about the plant. There were also a couple of white background pages that had small scientific style realistic drawings of plants, fruits and vegetables with their names and information. Googling ""vintage fruits and vegetables"" shows me similar styles of images to what those pages were like. I also remember a bit that talked about how cotton is used to make jeans (possibly with a pull tab bit that spins), and i'm pretty sure the book mentions coffee and tea as well (in brown sacks?).

I'm sorry that this is mostly a complete ramble, i was very young when i had this book! I hope this is the right subreddit to have posted this to.

I received a few samples from LAP recently from a purchase and as part of their offer that you can order up to 2 samples for free (you just pay shipping) and then you get a discount code for 10% off a full bottle. Not sure if this is only available in the UK as an offer, but instead of 10% they sent me a discount code for £20 off with a minimum purchase of £120 online (LAPGIFT) that seems to be in offer to anyone until January 31st. I’m not affiliated with the brand at all, just really like their products and appreciate a good deal!! (Even though I’m a bit salty LAP discontinued my favourite fragrance a few years ago 😭)

The samples and full sized bottle I received:

I purchased a full size bottle of Timbuktu, technically for my husband for Valentine’s Day (but you wouldn’t be wrong if you guessed that I’m also going to be using it a bit myself!!). It’s a spicy, woody, incense fragrance with great longevity and projection. It has a touch of mango without being sickeningly fruity. I wouldn’t describe the incense notes as being church-like or evocative of smoke shop incense, but something that smells luxurious and smoky without being overbearing or one-note. I think LAP are masters at blending complex fragrance profiles and this perfume really does exemplify their finesse. This fragrance is unisex, and while others have claimed this leans a bit masculine, I don’t get that vibe from it. It’s sexy, spicy and sophisticated.

I received and tried samples of L'Eau d'Ambre Extrême, Noir Exquis, and Ode à l'Oudh thus far. All are marketed as unisex. 

L'Eau d'Ambre Extrême: I loved this sample so much that I got a 10 ml travel size (trying not to buy too many full sizes right now as part of my low-buy goals, but would’ve bought a full size otherwise). This is, in my honest opinion, the Ambers to reign over all other Ambers. It’s resinous, spicy, and full-bodied. It reminds me of a more luxurious YSL Opium EDT without being too overpowering or dated like Opium can be to some. It’s a long lasting fragrance while maintaining a moderate projection, which I appreciate. The vanilla in this lends a softness and rounds out any sharpness from the cinnamon and nutmeg notes, but this is not a gourmand by any means. This is sexy, musky, and earthy. 

Noir Exquis: this is a gourmand, for the gourmand girlies. Noir Exquis is a coffee-forward sweet perfume that is balanced by the wood and chestnut notes. The sweetness comes from the maple syrup note but I would not describe this as cloying. It stays close to the skin, but does have a lasting dry down, albeit subtler than other LAP perfumes I’ve tried. I do feel like this perfume is extremely similar to Versatile’s Croissant Cafe, but Croissant Cafe is more long-lasting to me and at a better price point. 

Ode à l'Oudh: in the era of vanilla perfumes, this might be the most underrated vanilla perfume I’ve seen. This is definitely a sweet gourmand with a sophisticated twist of oudh and saffron. Some have described this as a sister to YSL’s Babycat, but I like this one much much more. Has great longevity and projection without being too much or sickening to the people around you. I have one spray on my wrist right now from hours ago and I cannot stop smelling myself, it’s addictive and compelling. The Oudh brings a slight animalicness to another wise sweet and feminine perfume, giving this an addictive depth. I think there might be some Tonka in this as well but it’s not listed as a note. Absolutely superb and I have to remind myself that I’m on a low-buy to not go out and immediately get this. ",3,1737823269.0,FemFragLab,2,1.0,False

By using  Disclosure facts & information we can simplify the UAP topic to help ourselves.  How do we protect Disclosure knowledge during  transition of society towards accepting the new NHI reality?","Following on from my recent post on how we should transition through Disclosure as a community.  
Here in an even longer post (too long in fact, so apologies im advance!), are a few significant Disclosure issues we need to address regarding: credible and verified whistle-blowers and believimg their testimonies, how we can use their information to make life easier for ourselves, and something to think about regarding how to manage the steadily increasing Disclosure knowledge that needs to be protected as ""reference information"" until society transitions into a state where all our institutions, organisations, bodies, etc have accepted the NHI reality and can be trusted to protect UAP/NHI related information from influential deniers and disinformation agents,  if they still are a problem at that time. 

>>>Believing whistle-blowers 100%<<<

It is our collective poor behaviour in  the UAP community,  which needs to change if we are to understand the truth behind the LegacyProgram cover-up. It is illustrated in the Vegas bombing event on 1st Jan. The Vegas whistle-blower stated that China and US have anti-gravity technology and China is using it as a  ""show of  force"" in NJ.  

However the majority, including many in this community, tried to dismiss it because they somehow know better than the special forces operative who had a USAP UAP clearance and was in an excellent position to know!  Even Coulthart dismissed it, without objectively assessing that the explanation given fits perfectly with eyewitness testimonies and would explain the majority of the many strange facts surrounding the NJ incident. 

My point is, that's is absolutely the wrong way to deal with challenging new information. That is difficult to accept or understand. It is not professional nor scientific nor objective. That very brave man gave his life and wanted to ensure the truth was known, and wanted a very serious  national security threat made public. We must take whistle-blowers seriously and be humble in the face of our ignorance. Just because people, who do not have the classified 1st hand experience and are not in a position to know about new information/situations/events, cannot come to accept the facts as stated by credible people telling them straight, does not make these difficult to process disclosures any less true. 

The FBI in a press conference confirmed that email was legitimate, but refused to discuss it in public which is very telling. He was an outstanding military professional stated directly from people who knew him. He was still in active service. Therefore very unlikely to be seriously mentally unstable. 

Reflect on how the media focused on an unstable story, break up of his marriage, etc based on a separate ""manifesto"" ranting about values and politics, and wrote off the event as a tragic mental health issue. How do we know that other manifesto was not hoaxed? Where was it found and can they confirm Berg sent it. Because the style of writing doesn't appear to match the whistle-blower email, 
although need to analyse further. Did he really send that emotional ""manifesto"" about lost comrades at same time as stating soberly that he was not ""under duress"" and raising earth shattering accusations of a serious national threat from China and war crimes in Afghanistan. Ok, he did appear to kill himself, so maybe grief for his comrades and the need to expose serious whistle-blower information drove him to take his life. Or maybe he thought he was a marked man anyway because of Disclosure (as he stated he was being tracked), so perhaps he did this on his terms. 

For both revelations he appears to be a 1st hand witness. Therefore the Vegas case should remain open and we should believe the information unless there is clear evidence to the contrary that demonstrates that it is false in some way.  Only thing is one of the DEA names mentioned in the email who was involved in Afghanistan, is still active duty and his name had to be redacted by Shaun Ryan to avoid a potential deadly compromise of his identity. It seems very unlikely that this and other verifiable information would appear in some made up email. He identified his first car in that email and sent it the day before he bombed Vegas. Verified by the FBI aa coming from his account. This has no evidence of a hoax and lots of evidence it is real and very specific about the facts exposed. Afghanistan checks out because the UN made a statement at the time 2019 about civilisation casualties that occurred as part of Berg's mission there. Plus a news article from 2019 referring to high casualties. So that part of the email is already corroborated along with the DEA agent who worked on the same mission. Hence why would that look like a solid whistle-blower exposé, and the anti-gravity testimony be incorrect? That does not make sense. We believe one part of his testimony but not the other, because...reasons? We don't accept the idea China has anti-gravity technology and is creating a ""show of force"" to intimidate the US government and the Pentagon, because people are so arrogant they forget the world is almost at war. We are on the edge of global war right now. China and Russia are sabotaging power cables and Internet communications in NATO countries. UK had ""dr0ne"" incursions which it tried to cover-up and dismiss, whilst invoking 2 emergency COBRA meetings, which are only for urgent national security threats or matters. Russia media is literally talking about nuking the UK of the face of the map! North Korea is fighting in Europe. Iran has been constantly attacking Israel through 4 different proxies. Rockets most days somewhere along the borders and providing Houthies with large long range ballistic missiles. Isreal is lucky to be in one piece and the Allies could be drawn in to direct conflict by accident while supporting Israel in defence and protecting shipping. So yes, China could absolutely be pressuring the US. 

There is no evidence against China having anti-gravity technology at this point. We know they have a reverse engineering program so it makes sense. Berg also said that the US has it and was first. Personal opinions and difficulties in accepting facts are not evidence. 

Try this scenario: China threatening the US to not interfere when China moves on Taiwan around 2027, and generally threatening against any interference in contested territories e.g. South China Sea. If it is China, then a highly likely reason for Bedminster to be targeted by ""dr0nes"", to threaten Trump directly. Fact: China are currently building a new fleet of highly specialised landing craft with long road bridges over 100-150m in length, that use a suspension design and the ships have huge shore jacks to stabilise the ship when deploying the bridge. This type has never seen before in any Navy. There are 6 large ships rapidly being constructed right now to allow large numbers of troops and large quantities of tanks/armoured vehicles to land without even touching a beach. Analysts highlight that these large ships have no other useful purpose identifiable other than for mass landings. In addition,   they are designed to connect to commercial Chinese roll-on roll-off ferries which are deliberately designed designed and tested to carry the weight of tightly packed full battle tanks and/or large amounts of personnel, vehicles or equipment. Seen the satellite photos and hence this is more evidence to support the assertion that China is seriously preparing for a Taiwan invasion. Therefore it is logical, as they have non-human technology, that they could launching incursions into NJ, to spy and threaten the Pentagon avoid overt conflict in future. In parallel China launched two major cyber attacks end of 2024, compromising the entire cellphone network of the USA (stunning scake of attack) and also accessing certain Treasury Secretary computers and data, which is a major breach. So assuming it has anti-gravity technology then it's absolutely possible that NJ was part of a pressure campaign on the USA to keep the fxxk out of Chinese expansionist activities. 

The Pentagon obviously did not wish to make that public due to public reaction but was obviously aware that it was China trolling the US mainland. Totally explains the disinformation and cover-up surrounding events there. If Chinese involvement was made public the citizens would demand retaliation, and the Pentagon does not wish to escalate because? Danger of escalation into WW3. This theory is borne out by the facts and evidence available and the incursions into the UK airbases housing nuclear weapons, which I initially thought to be Russia, but understand better now since the Vegas bomber revealed China's tech advantage.  Explains why the UK were actively trying to downplay and dismiss the events. China is more likely there than Russia, given Russia doesn't have that tech and due very similar types of events and eyewitness testimonies.  Again WW3 is a factor in not revealing who it was, and also protecting knowledge of the classified anti-gravity technology would be another factor driving secrecy. Just dr0nes but not a threat, lol. Global security is the worst it has ever been since WW2. That is not hyperbole. 

Obviously, this doesn't mean there were no real UAP sightings in UK and NJ. There most likely were but mixed in with human made objects. Can imagine NHI being very interested as usual in movement of nuclear weapons in UK and likely interested in Chinese anti-gravity tech in NJ. 

So, please believe whistle-blowers. Their efforts to expose facts and situations that the public need to be aware of should never be dismissed or undermined. It is better to treat all whistle-blower reports as 100% correct and factual, unless they don't pass verification checks on there identity and background, or only if you individually have 1st hand experience of exactly the events and information referenced, have direct access to the source of such information, and/or have the evidence or verifiable facts which throw significant doubt or negate the assertions in some manner. 

Not liking how someone looks or behaves on camera or how they talk in an interview is subjective opinion and holds zero weight with regards to testimonies and facts that they bring forwards. If someone has given evidence to the Senate Intel Committee and you decide they are not credible then you are the problem, not the legally designated whistle-blower. It is a legal status for most we have seen give stunning evidence so far. That must be recognised as a filter against which people lacking in verification or credible backgrounds are rejected. The Senate does not just invite any old John Doe in for a coffee and a legal testimony. That is instant high crediblity right there. Therefore, we should not question it unless of course solid evidence exists. Neither rumour  nor opinion nor perverse subjective logic - e.g. I can't believe that type of individual could ever be a Biologist. Just accept the testimonies as fact, because 99% of the time that is likely to be true. There may be a disinfo agent or two introduced, but I suspect that they would be quickly identified by ex-insiders in the Disclosure community. But that is not a reason not to believe the testimonies of these brave individuals which will most likely be legally accurate, since again, all major whistle-blowers have legally designated status for their own protection and to be admitted into internal investigations.

Hopefully, this will change how you comment and behave regarding whistle-blowers. They really must have our 100% trust and support. 

>>>Using whistle-blowers Disclosure information to simplify the UAP topic<<<

They deserve that and we must treat their evidence as highly regarded facts that are prime references for the community on which to base understanding, to deduce other information/facts, to build any new hypothesis if needed to understand what may be yet to be disclosed in the longer timeframe or to understand something we know won't be disclosed, and we need to draw conclusions or create a working hypothesis to fill a gap.  

An example, Elizondo published in Imminent a chapter or two on UAP craft and their structure and means of propulsion. This is the best scientific assessment we have from reputable experts. It makes very good sense and fits with 5 observables, and makes sense from a theoretical physics perspective. Now that information should be the new reference for how UAP craft work, why they are shaped as they are. Etc. This should be everyone's reference because it is from a verified and highly credible source, from experts who have direct experience. We should not judge it, and we cannot judge it otherwise we will make no progress in defining the science, technology, composition, artefacts, inhabitants, structure and boundaries of our new reality. 

However, people on these subs are like zombies sometimes, shuffling along spouting their pet theories about say, Magneto Hydro-dynamics or MHD. Which, by the way, does not provide instant acceleration or inertial damping. Therefore cannot be the explanation or method of UAP propulsion witnessed consistently throughout the decades. These users seem to ignore the facts and the information published by a whistle-blower that gives scientific analysis and assessment which I am proposing we should accept 100%, believed and refer to as a factual reference point. We need to weed out posts from people who promote things which are now beginning to be or can be considered as incorrect according to knowledge people with 1st hand experience, through whistle-blower testimonies. This will require us to challenge the likes of the MHD people, and say clearly that theory is no longer valid because we have a reference definition for Faster Than Light propulsion which fits extremely well with the large body evidence we have gathered over the decades. MHD is clearly NOT a valid hypothesis, since it does not explain a number of fundamental behaviours of Non-human craft witnessed repeatedly in many cases. At this point, I would politely ask them to please stop posting about it, because it is essentially misinformation at this point. I would suggest that you begin to think and act that way too if we are to work together to cut out the noise. Not everything should be on the table in the face of strong, evidence to the contrary, especially from people who are professionals, with inside knowledge against keen amateurs, with no qualifications or experience. 

There is an exception. Unless a qualified professional, physicist with solid UAP credentials publishes an alternative hypothesis which explains all UAP behaviours, and better in some manner than published to date. (I'm essentially describing ultimately moving towards the standard scientific approach here.) By publishing papers to be openly challenged and accepted as reference documents, or rejected through peer review. But until we have a body of scientists and technologists who are educated in UAP science, then that approach in standard journals has to wait. Meantime we need to gather and guard the truth as it is made public. And defend it as do scientific journals of, say, their fundamental reference proofs, models and data. 

So I would suggest that we need to start to use the new facts we do know as having truthful weight against speculation or poorly constructed hypothesis based on flimsy references, weak deductions or simply assumptions and not actual facts. Weed out things that don't fit. E.g. Here is a glaring example of how our understanding of reality gets confused. The Legacy Program whistle-blowers refer to ""Non-human biologics"", stated under oath in Congress. Given that fact, we can then use that in assessment of the idea that somehow ""future humans"" are involved piloting UAP. If we only have a Non-human biological assessment of entities recovered over 7 decades. Then how can we give any credence to someones idea of time traveling humans, whos DNA would show up as Human in biological analysis. This is one key argument against Masters who has no scientific framework for time travel (he has not evenattempted it), has no theoretical physics that indicates how any type of manipulation of historical timelines are possible in some way, how a time-machine shaped as a disc or sphere or triangle etc would work in theory 
 and presents an idea that flies in the face of many documented eyewitness testimonies who talk of beings indicating over the decades that they come from other star systems, and are clearly not human physiologically in many respects. Ancient tribes refer to the ""Star people"", but lets just ignore all that evidence. Thus, I would highlight there is no whistle-blower evidence supporting ""future humans"", quite the contrary in fact, and suggest that this ""idea"", because I don't see any solid hypothesis there, is parked and left out of our reference set until some concrete evidence arrived that demands a reassessment. It is mis/disinformation at this point given the whistle-blower evidence. 

Note that I am willing to accept Faster Than Light travel and not Time Travel, although they are both controversial scientific concepts. That's because we have strong evidence for FTL with Lazar,Pais, Alcubierre, others, the flight and behavioural characteristics of UAP, professional analysis by UAP related physicists, logically it makes sense when referring to multiple civilisations who refer to different star systems, the logistics of interstellar travel not suited to chemical propulsion, etc. However, for ""future humans"", there is scientifically analysed biological counter evidence explicity identified as positively ""Non-Human"" entities which are visiting Earth. Plus a significant body of eyewitness testimonies and abductee accounts which confirm the NHI beings refer to their interstellar origins in varying locations and also demonstrate craft that travel in space, and to some witnesses other parts of the galaxy. As well as our military sensor detection of UAP craft coming and going between our planet and space. NORAD has to suppress UAP tracks to avoid confusion with nuclear missile detection warnings. So it is known as a fact that UAP frequently travel to/from space. The eyewitness testimonies do not align with the idea of ""future humans"" due to very significant physical differences. And not one case of any abductees reporting that beings described themselves as future humans, not one. Nor has any NHI demonstrated any capability for time travel in human presence. I'll stop there, but based on the Legacy Program alone we have explicitly Non-human visitors as a scientific fact. Therefore, suggest people start to ignore mis/disinformation not based on whistle-blowers evidence, and also dismiss ideas disproven by whistle-blower evidence combined with a broad range of historic evidence from leaks, documented cases and credible witnesses. So, in my logical assessment, ""future humans"" has to be out as a hypothesis at this point as there is significant evidence against, and no credible evidence in support of, that concept. 

Unless new, credible, better in some way information is published from those involved with UAP, that modifies or changes those reference facts, then our reference set of facts and information won't change. New whistle-blowers will be providing new information, so that needs to be compared with the reference set. (There may be contradictions in future but not as yet.) Otherwise, unless exceptionally you have direct knowledge of the UAP NHI aspects you are analysing and are a professional in a related area capable of proposing alternative analysis, then I am proposing that *any Reddit opinion must hold no weight against whistle-blowers evidence*. Why? Because, we must protect the new emerging truth and facts, and use those to deduce new conclusions based on credible evidence and information.

By being radical in our dismissal of what does not fit with whistle-blower evidence and testimonies, we simplify the UAP topic and begin to discount lots of unsubstantiated ideas, assumptions or understandings that don't fit and no longer make sense. This simplifies the UAP topic and makes it easier for everyone to understand. We must start to take certain incorrect or poorly substantiated assumptions, ideas, theories, hypothesis, received wisdom, off the table. The Phenomenon appears from analysis to actually be a set of discreet elements that we need to identify and describe. Some elements have direct relationships or common dependencies which leads to confusion about their nature and preventing the essential understanding and definition of that element. The sooner we simplify the information space around NHI and UAP, the sooner we will be able to positively identify and describe the elements we witness which comprise the Phenomenon. 

This process of ""taking potential answers off the table"" will start to free your mind of useless clutter and brings focus to those facts and evidence that will lead to faster, clearer, better underpinned understanding and ultimately lead to better decisions regarding how you deal with the whole NHI UAP reality, and also in your life relating to decisions directly relating to specific aspects or elements of the Phenomenon. E.g. do you wish to make contact with NHI directly (credible whistle-blower information might provide newly developed guidance from the Legacy Program not previously available, which given your understanding you decide is likely the more effective reference to use compared with some relatively unknown YT podcasters advice based on personal experience), or another question, will meditation help me access psionic abilities that I would like to explore. Keeping track of the UAP NHI reference facts and information should help people navigate to better answers more easily.

I may be too anxious about the institutions or mechanisms not being available to manage the information flowing from Disclosure, or over estimate the amount of information we will be given. But I need to express what may be an important problem. 

The question remains, if this approach makes sense, what organisation is going be the intermediate home of the truth when it comes to the Phenomenon. The valid knowledge needs to be governed, curated, qualified, managed, maintained, stored, protected, made available, etc. Until global society transitions, this interim management of the reference data seems to be necessary. Once there are new branches of academia, science, 
technology with qualified professionals who are educated in this new knowledge and don't dismiss or deny it, then the reference information can pass into mainstream reference journals, books, databases,etc and thus can pass into mainstream institutions and structures. This may need to be once mainstream institutions have transformed themselves to be ready to accept Paradigm shifting concepts, science, technology, sociology, medicine, etc etc. 

I don't think we can systematically understand and record common standards and definitions of elements of the Phenomenon,  and study them further if the denial and rejection not been dealt with in mainstream society. Common UAP Community knowledge is not consistent or reliable enough to be trusted as a reference source. Which is why I feel that the leading edge of the Disclosure movement will need to supply appropriate professionals, legal, financial and operational support to provide a service, potentially globally, to have a common repository of the truth and that journalists can access to see the latest validated additions to our new Phenomenon knowledge base. Not entirely sure what needs to be in it aside from whistle-blower evidence, but it needs references for everything that has been identified as a discreet element/aspect of the Phenomenon e.g. what is the definition and description of the 5 main NHI civilisations and their related entity types currently visiting Earth? , 
even if whistle-blowers have not published evidence for that aspect. Plus all the historic government documents e.g. Immaculate Constellation report, reports, news stories, plus all major cases with corroborating evidence, cases with written and video documents e.g. Gimbal, Tic-Tac, Splash, acclaimed UAP NHI reference works such as John Mack's abduction cases, Richard Dolan's historical reference books, Leonard Stringfellow's crash retrievals, etc. Credible and factual documentaries not based on speculation such as I Know What I Saw, Ariel Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, etc. The repository would need to arbitrate on what information takes precedence and is trustworthy, as new information is submitted. This would be an interim service in the until mainstream society is educated, transformed where necessary and professionally ready to take responsibility. This transition period might take a few years until a competent, trustworthy institutional and social structure is in place to migrate that knowledge safely into mainstream and protect it's information currency, validity, security and integrity from bad actors looking to benefit from lack of general knowledge and understanding that could be used in malign or fraudulent ways to wield power, social or business advantage over the general population who could be faced with influence based on falsehoods, misinformation and disinformation about the Phenomenon that could lead to societal harm, physical harm, financial harm, psychological harm, amongst other risks.  

Perhaps we don't need all of this, but without addressing this problem I don't see current society has the equivalent of a controlled, maintained, information source that can be relied upon during Disclosure and during societies transition to accepting UAP and NHI reality across every facet of life that currently provides people with trusted information. Currently information stewardship is spread across government, academia, business, science, technology, 
engineering, institutes, libraries, journals, etc. So knowledge management is dispersed and not centralised. Which means we need many independent bodies to accept and make changes before we can trust they are in a position to act professionally in accepting NHI and UAP information as valid and no different from accepting the factual topic of Mammals on this planet, what they look like, how they behave, where they live, how they communicate, feed, etc.  

Until the science community has formally accepted the new reality and is willing to integrate UAP and NHI information into it's institutions and organisations, and that there are no disruptive actors deliberately rejecting or denying new science or discoveries related to NHI, then I believe we would need some kind of ""Keeper of the Truth"" solution.  

TL:DR Fxxk that was an epic ramble. He is waffling again - even this TL:DR is long!!! Basically believe credible whistle-blowers 100%. They are legally protected, have an obligation to tell the truth because their allegations may result in sanctions or criminal prosecution of those involved with the Legacy Program. Reddit in general is not qualified to criticise their testimonies. Accept and learn our new reality. Whistle-blower information should be used as reference information to identify and remove faulty hypotheses, poorly founded speculations, common misunderstandings that mislead,  the community when trying to understand the UAP/NHI truth and reliable facts or hypotheses. ""Keeper of the Truth"" - as Disclosure progresses and society accepts NHI, there is a transition period where we need to protect emerging facts, data, information and knowledge eg. UAP scientific research, technology breakthroughs, maps of NHI galactic civilisations,  etc, that today's society and institutions would normally dismiss, and likely will manage seriously until they have professionally accepted the new reality. Special organisation required to provide a trusted reference source, secure, maintained, etc? Perhaps, yes, until society is ready across many sectors as an operable whole.",12,1737822815.0,UFOB,7,0.8,False

In this one clip I need to ask you a few questions:

**Coffee Density and Proper Dose**  
I've recently switched to Goat Story, Brasil Coletivo Caparao coffee, roasted on 09-12-2024. I'm using an E&B IMS basket (16/18g). I noticed that this coffee feels much heavier than the previous one—22.5g fills the basket completely. How is this possible? Does the density of coffee vary between different beans? If so, how should I measure the proper dose, especially when the suggested basket weight doesn't seem reliable?

**Dialing in Espresso Settings**  
I'm trying to figure out the best settings for making espresso. I've watched a few videos on dialing in, but I'm still confused about when to adjust which parameters. My setup is consistent with a dose that stays the same, a temperature of 94°C, and 11 bars of pressure. I know the main variables to tweak are grind size and output weight.

* Is there a priority between these two?
* How can I tell if my espresso tastes sour because of the grind size or the output weight?
* I also pay attention to timing and channeling. Should I start timing from the button press or the first drop, especially if I use 5s/3s pre-infusion? Should I aim for a 25-30 second shot from button click or first drop?

**Splitting Milk for Two Drinks**  
I watched Lance Hedrick’s video on splitting milk for two drinks, but I find his method (transferring 70% of the liquid, then moving 20% back) inefficient. Every time I try, the second pour has significantly less foam and turns out worse.

* How do I ensure even foam distribution between two cups?
* How much milk should I use? Currently, I use 160g for one cup and 340g for two cups.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqDu7NyivQk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqDu7NyivQk)

**Milk Integration and Pouring Technique**  
I watched Emily Bryant’s video on creating a heart, where she quickly builds the canvas by starting low, lifting the pitcher quickly, and finishing low again. When I tried this, the milk didn’t integrate well. I’ve stuck with a lower height and slower pour speed, but my results aren’t great.

* Could the problem be that my initial canvas is too thick?
* Any tips for better milk integration?

Four hours later. Had a weird delay when trying to pee and then it was SO slow. Just odd
Five hours later: very tired head still tingles but kind off off and on. Avoided coffee. 
7 hours later quick nap

I think the first week with crushing headaches was the easiest! I would so trade my now-time for this early painful stage! Why? Because then I slept well through the first week! Because then my energies were still high. Because my stress levels were normal. Because then I was hopeful. 

Now I am reading about PAWS 🐾 and embracing myself for 12-24 months ride. My hope now is that MAYBE it will get better around month 10? Well, either that or MOST LIKELY I will get used to my new normal. Apologies for my mood. I just didn’t expect what is transpiring. 

I am mostly concerned about constant stress. Stress is not good for us. Although caffeine causes stress but my fitness tracker disagrees! On caffeine I had moderate stress levels at work (70% of the time) with occasional high stress (10% of the time). Still I will be in a low stress zone at work for about 20% of the time when writing or talking to people I like. I will be in a low stress zone in the evenings (80% of the time) and during sleep (100% of the time). 

Now, caffeine free I am averaging mostly high stress levels 80% of the time at work, moderate stress when I rest in the evenings and my sleep slowly but surely as the time goes on shifts from low stress to elevated. 

For the last 24 hours I had not been in a low stress zone AT ALL. 

This elevated stress if maintained for months could cause adverse effects regardless of being so healthy and off the sauce. 

I also understand that most of the people do not use fitness trackers but they are useful even though they do not always show what one wants to see. I saw the same stress levels when I was sick with COVID or flu. I do think this is not something that can be shrugged off. So I am looking into what could be done to rectify it. 

Magnesium supplements do not work for me - tried them before and besides laxative effect did not see any stress or sleep improvement. Still started taking it “just in case” to observe no effect as my sleep gets worse and worse with every night. 

During work days I do eat dinner a bit later compared to weekends. I do notice ANY SNACK taken after dinner crashes sleep quality. For most of the days I am good about not snacking but if my dinner shifts into post 6pm, I suspect it worsens stress. 

I even started toying with idea of fasting… it MIGHT decrease stress levels. Honestly I had never monitored my stress levels while fasting. I may try it. 

I read so many stories of people who had PAWS 🐾 for a year or longer and I am wondering about how to decrease this time and most importantly mitigate stress levels!

Stuck in a loop.

That blinking vertical line on my screen is hypnotic.

Writer's block. Creative impotence is what it is. Everything you put on the page is limp and lifeless; something that bores you will bore others and you just sit there typing a sentence and then deleting it and then doing it all over again and again and again. So many things you’ll try to restart that engine to make it roar back to life but the dog just won’t hunt.

For God’s sake, you can’t even stick with the same metaphor in one paragraph. Literary listlessness.

Coffee.

Cigarettes.

What scares people? My eyes drift out the window to the children playing outside on my street. My mind wanders in different directions on the best way to scare them and it just keeps going back into the same old places it has in the past. Past success is a soul sucking blackhole. A seductive siren that promises passionate prose but ultimately delivers rote returns. 

More coffee.

More cigarettes.

Madness.

A ring at my door. A young man who can barely speak proper English is trying to sell me on the awesome power of solar. I focus on a fleck of meat stuck between his front teeth. Is there something there?

I invite him inside. I offer him coffee and a cigarette and he declines both. I ask him what scares him.

Loss of rights. Climate change. Nuclear war.

When the Devil leaves the dark and walks naked in the light of day, old fashioned frights are frivolities.

I add the young man to the collection in my basement that I started last week, hoping to light that creative fire. Nothing. Another diminished return.

Shower.

More coffee.

More cigarettes.

Madness.

I watch the children outside on the street. I watch that little vertical line on my white screen appear and then disappear and appear and then disappear and so on and so forth.

A ring at my door. Two women offering me salvation, cleverly disguised on cheap paper. I hear Hendrix. All Along The Watchtower. I invite them inside and I ask them what scares them.

Nothing. They’re both content with God’s will.

I try something different. A double header. A bummer that’s bereft of any inspiration. The muse remains flaccid.

No shower. I remove my shirt  and I festoon myself with their innards. 

More coffee and a bump of coke.

Cigarettes.

Red eyes and a racing heart.

Those kids just keep playing. Their laughter goads my lugubriousness.

The vertical line blinks.

Something more drastic maybe?

Another bump and I’m out the door with a hatchet in hand.

They see me and I see fear in their eyes. The muse suddenly screams. A vibrant and vivacious voice; a revelation of the perfect tale.

I run for home, but I’m mowed down from a meddling neighbor’s car. 

I’m bleeding and broken. Death is coming and my ultimate fear is here. I finally had it. 

THE STORY.

SHIT!

1i9qgh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i9qgh2/my_brothers_girlfriend_is_too_shy_and_now_my/,"My brothers girlfriend is too shy, and now my parents are getting fustrated","So, my brother (21 M) has been dating his girlfriend (21 F) for nearly 4 years. She's been welcomed into our family the best we can, inviting her to dinners, involving her in family gatherings, even paying for her to join us on family holidays. 

Despite our best efforts, she really doesn't make any effort to speak to us, even when she comes and stays over at our house. Most of the time they're both home, they stay up in my brothers room. They don't interact with me, my mum or my dad, and they never join in if the three of us are doing something together like watching a film in the living room. 

It's been like this for a while now, and we put it down to her just being really shy, hoping that over time as she got used to being around us, she'd slowly open up. This has not happened, and yesterday it all came to a head. 

My brother and his girlfriend were sat downstairs in our kitchen drinking their morning coffee. She was reading and he was on his phone. I came down and said good morning, to which my brother responded hello, but his girlfriend stayed quiet. My parents then came in, also saying good morning to the both of them and generally striking up a conversation. My brothers girlfriend still said nothing, no hello, no good morning, she didn't even look up from her book to acknowledge me or my parents as they came into the room. 

Now, one thing to know about my parents is that they are the chatty type. They love conversation and connecting through that, so they of course continued to talk to my brother and his girlfriend, asking them how they were and what plans they had for the day. 

Then, my brother rather bluntly replied, can you leave us alone, my girlfriend is trying to read. I looked at my dad, who was looking back at me, half smiling as he thought it was a joke. He laughed and continued to talk to me about how funny he thought my brothers response was. My brother, under his breath, stated 'wow, it was so nice and quiet down here, now everyone's decided to come in and make noise'. I stopped talking, honestly a bit stunned at what my brother had just said. 

To clarify, we both still live at home with our parents. I'm turning 25 this year and have a decent amount saved up to buy a home of my own at the end of it. I work full time, and pay rent, whereas my brother has decided to take on a masters after uni, and so does not work nor pay any rent, and has no plans to move out of the family home anytime soon. 

To be honest, it came across really disrespectful, and my parents later in the day even brought it up, saying how fed up they are of my brothers rudeness, and his girlfriends shyness. They're fed up of him talking for her, and don't know if either of them really care to be around us or want to make an effort to be one big happy family. Whenever they're over, we all feel a bit awkward, like we can't go into the room they're in because they're in there. 
It's weird, especially when it's my parents house in the first place. 

We also don't know why she doesn't talk to us. Is it because deep down she actually doesn't like us? Or is it just a social awkwardness thing?

Either way, we dont know where to go from here. They want to approach him and find out why they are acting this way, but I don't think that will go down very well. He's quite defensive as a person, and especially when it comes to his girlfriend, so I can see it turning into a big argument if it's mentioned in conversation. ",1,1737821948.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1i9qfhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chinese/comments/1i9qfhv/meeting_boyfriends_family_for_the_first_time_help/,Meeting boyfriend's family for the first time. Help!,"Hello Reader

I have been dating my (F31) boyfriend (M29) for about 6 months now and am about to meet his extended family next week for Chinese New Year. My boyfriend is first generation Canadian and the rest of his family is from China. To say that I am extremely nervous is an understatement and I am terrified of making a terrible first impression. 

I will be the first to admit I am not a cultured individual. I was raised in a very small town and growing up I was not exposed to any other cultures besides my own. I have since tried to broaden my horizons, but I still feel very out of my depth as I have not had the opportunity to do much traveling or experience things outside of my, admittedly, very small world. 

I will be the first None-Chinese S.O introduced to the family. This includes his siblings and cousins who either have no partners yet or have partners who are also Chinese. On top of this, several of his relatives only speak Cantonese and/or Mandarin (their main language is Cantonese) and I know very little of either. 

I know there are customs and traditions when it comes to Chinese New Year, but trying to get information from my partner about what I should expect is not easy as he doesn't want to stress me out or make me nervous, but the lack of preparation is making me even more so. 

Usually, upon meeting an S.O's family for the first time, especially when going over to someone's house that is hosting, I would bring a gift. A bottle of wine, a bag of coffee, a gift basket or something. I brought this up to my partner asking what I should bring and he said that I shouldn't bring anything, but I am not getting a why. Is it inappropriate? He mentioned something about seniority when it comes to gift giving, but I really don't understand how it works, and the whole thing is making me way more nervous that I am going to unintentionally insult them and I really, really want to make a good impression. 

I know I am ignorant and I apologize, but can anyone help explain roughly what I should expect? I assume every family would do things slightly different, but what are the basics of this holiday that I should understand before walking in there?

Thanks in advance for any help. ",1,1737821876.0,Chinese,4,1.0,False
1i9qf6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/vidanta/comments/1i9qf6m/vidanta_riviera_maya_grand_mayan_review/,Vidanta Riviera Maya - Grand Mayan review,"We stayed a week at Grand Mayan after paying for it at a charity auction. 3rd week of January - 2 sunny days, 1 rainy day, 4 cloudy days. 

Overall it was a 3 star resort in our opinion.

Positives :

+ We stayed in a building walkable to pools and restaurants. I would recommend building 6 as the best location (far enough away from loud entertainment, near enough to walk everywhere and not be dependent on golf shuttles which are quite infrequent.

+ Lots of sunbeds available in the shade.

+ If you book far enough in advance (latest the first day of your arrival but I recommend doing it before) you can get a reservation at a restaurant on site. We loved Gong restaurant and did 2 hou of happy hour next door at wine bar before our 6.30pm reservation. 

+ Salum had multiple non bookable places to eat but when it rained there was a 1 hour wait for a table undercover. 

+ Multiple happy hours (2for1). All pool bars 12-2pm, the wine bar 4.30-6.30pm, Nektar 10-11pm.

+ Staff seem relaxed about people having their own drinks by the pool.

+ Great wildlife (wild crocs, iguanas, coati’s) and beautiful scenery. 

+ 3 par golf had lots of wildlife (including crocs) but you have to bring your own balls and as there is lots of water, bring more than 3 per round. 

+ Mexican night was ok entertainment but yummy open buffet and open bar so was worth the $57pp (including discount from attending time share rep). Starts at 6, they suggest getting there at 5.30 but we were happy we got there at 5.15 as sat near the lake and open bar started when we arrived. 

Negatives :

- Buildings are a little outdated and needing tlc.

- They charge for the water and coffee in the bedrooms despite not telling you that. 

- We were happy we hired a car to go on tours and grocery shopping. But it takes about 40 minutes each time to get your car out of the resort (get to hotel lobby, wait for golf cart, get to central lobby, wait for car, drive out). They charge 100p a day for parking. 

- Tips included on all of the receipts but staff still expecting additional tips to be added. 

- No physical menus at restaurants so everyone is on their phones.

- Beach is average. 

- Multiple pools are not available to access as exclusive to other hotels. No adult only pools available. 



Our experience with the time sharer sales rep :

Gave us big discount on golf (down to $79 including cart and club hire) plus 10% off all food and drink so it was worth it for us. 

They said it would be 1 hour max meeting and then a free lunch. 

We pushed it back to the end of our stay as we planned it around bad weather. 

Our appointment was at 11.30. Took 30 minutes of faff to be taken to the marketing area. 
Rep wanted to then take us on a scenic walk of the resort which we declined as we’d been here for 5 days already. 
It was then a 1 hour lunch (3 tacos per person and a soft drink at the ceviche restaurant) with the sales rep which was pretty awkward, and he wanted us to tip at the end. After 30 minutes of lunch he started writing down the different packages available etc. 
He then walked us back to the marketing suite and said he needed 1 hour. We refused and gave him 20 minutes. We also declined a walk to a bedroom tour. He wasn’t happy but we were polite but strong willed. Then we asked for the manager, explained we weren’t interested. Manager then signed off our attendance. We then got led to a check out desk to complete our attendance. 
From start to finish, 11.30-1.40 and made it to the pool for happy hour. 


Overall I’d say accommodation is worth $500 for the week, not $2000 like we paid. We paid $800 on top including happy hour drinks, $150 resort fee, government taxes, 2 dinners at Salum and 1 fancy dinner at Gong.

We went to Cenote Taak Bi Ha which we’d recommend as a non busy cave swim, Chichen Itza (arrive before 9.00am and note the clocks go back), lunch in Valladolid, and avoided swimming with the turtles on mass with the other tourists in Aktun.
