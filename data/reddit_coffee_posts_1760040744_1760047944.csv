1o2jc7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1o2jc7l/aio_i_found_a_lighter_in_my_15yearold_sons_pocket/,AIO: I found a lighter in my 15-year-old son's pocket and now we're fighting.,"¬†I'm a mom who is just lost right now. I need some outside perspective to see if I'm handling this all wrong.

Yesterday, I was doing my usual round of collecting laundry from everyone's rooms. When I got to my 15-year-old son's room, I grabbed the jeans he'd worn the day before from his floor. As I picked them up, I got a strong whiff of smoke. Not a campfire smell, but that distinct, stale smell of cigarette smoke.

My heart just dropped into my stomach. I told myself to calm down, that maybe he was standing near someone who was smoking, that it could be nothing. But my hands were shaking as I checked the pockets. And in the front right pocket, I found it. A cheap, disposable lighter. It felt so small and heavy in my hand at the same time.

The rest of the afternoon was a blur of panic. I went through every worst case scenario in my head. Is he smoking? Is he vaping? Who is he with? Is he in trouble? I had to literally sit down and take deep breaths, telling myself not to accuse him, but to talk to him.

When he got home from school, I asked him to come to the living room. I had the lighter on the coffee table. I tried to keep my voice as calm as possible and said, ""Honey, I found this in your jeans when I was doing laundry. I also smelled smoke. Can you please tell me what's going on?""

He didn't even take a second to think. His face went bright red and he immediately started shouting. ""You went through my stuff! I can't believe you don't trust me! It's not mine, it's Jason's! He asked me to hold it for him because his dad would kill him if he found it!""

I stayed quiet until he finished, and then I said, ""Okay, even if that's true, why do your pants smell like smoke?""

He rolled his eyes, a gesture that felt like a punch. ""Because we were hanging out and he was smoking nearby! I told him to stop blowing it near me! God, Mom, you're so paranoid!""

This is where I might be the a-hole. Hearing him defend his friend who smokes, and seeing how quickly he lied (because I know defensive shouting is often a cover for a lie), made me more worried, not less. I wasn't worried about the lighter anymore; I was worried about the company he's keeping and the fact that he thinks it's okay to talk to me like that.

I told him, firmly, ""I don't care whose lighter it is. I don't want you hanging out with Jason if he's smoking, especially around you. That stuff is dangerous and addictive, and you're not to see him outside of school for a while.""

He exploded. He told me I was ""overreacting,"" that I was ""controlling,"" and that I was going to make him a social outcast. He said all his friends think I'm ""so strict"" and that I just don't get it. He stormed off to his room and slammed the door, and we haven't really spoken since.

Part of me knows I'm the mom and I have to set boundaries. But another part of me is heartbroken. He's my sweet boy, and the way he looked at me was with so much anger. I'm terrified that if I'm too hard, I'll push him toward this stuff, but if I'm too soft, he'll think it's okay.

So, please be honest. Am I overreacting for banning him from seeing this friend?

1o2j7aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1o2j7aq/midnight_walks_on_the_ceiling/,Midnight Walks On The Ceiling,"I got a new book last week for my collection, but I‚Äôve decided to keep it locked down in my vault. It‚Äôs too dangerous to have out in the open

When my new acquaintance (to preserve his privacy, I‚Äôll refer to him as ‚ÄòChester‚Äô) came to meet me in person at a nearby park, he was looking pretty damn rough. The college sophomore was fresh out of a stint in the psychiatric ward, ten pounds thinner than he ought to be, and the plum-dark circles beneath his eyes told me he hadn‚Äôt slept well in days. In his hands he clutched the book, bound tightly in brown paper.¬†

‚ÄúOoh,‚Äù I said, zeroing in on it immediately as he sat down beside me on the bench. I had my dog Midge with me. She‚Äôs a yellow-furred mutt with one blind eye, an eye that can see things I can‚Äôt. I knew Chester‚Äôs book was the real deal when Midge took one look and growled at it.¬†

‚ÄúIs your dog alright?‚Äù Chester asked. He was half-slurring, exhausted.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, yeah, she‚Äôs fine,‚Äù I said. I snatched the book out of his hands, despite Midge‚Äôs whining protests. I quickly unwrapped the book. It was exactly as he‚Äôd described in our chat online. Deep brown leather, gilded pages, and an unusual title:

**YA·Çß·ÇßIM TA –òOOM ‚õ¨ TH”òI–ò·ÇßIM TA –òU∆ß**

I moved to crack the book open, but Chester stopped me.¬†

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do that,‚Äù he said thinly. ‚ÄúJust lock it up somewhere or burn it or something. There‚Äôs nothing in there you want to read.‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing at all? That‚Äôs usually the sort of information I like to verify for myself,‚Äù I told him.¬†

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt even be able to‚Ä¶look, something‚Äôs wrong with it. I‚Äôm giving it to you to¬†*get rid of it*,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI read on the forums that you take care of stuff like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, but first I need to know what stuff I‚Äôm dealing with, precisely.‚Äù I wrapped the book back up for the moment. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you start by telling me where you got it?‚Äù

**CHESTER‚ÄôS ACCOUNT**

I got it at an antique shop.¬†

It‚Äôs called ‚ÄòFort‚Äôs Corner‚Äô, near mainstreet. It‚Äôs not, like, old, or strange, or haunted, or anything like that. It popped up a couple years ago and it‚Äôs run by this young-ish, hippie-type couple. Oh, and their orange tabby cat. It sits in their storefront, it‚Äôs sort of their gimmick.¬†

I guess, I just want to be clear that this is a normal place. I‚Äôm not the idiot in the horror movie, you know? I used to shop there all the time, it was a normal Saturday afternoon.¬†*Normal*.

Though I guess the book wasn‚Äôt.

Maybe, thinking back now, there was something weird about how I spotted it all the way at the back of the store. About how my eyes shot right to it, like it was a beacon. It was in the corner, crammed on a shelf with a bunch of paperback romances and pulp books from the sixties. I remember‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt question how weird that was, until now. I mean, look at it. It‚Äôs leatherbound with gilded pages, wicked fancy, and it was just sitting there with regular books like it belonged there, somehow. Why didn‚Äôt I wonder about that?

I guess, for the same reason I didn‚Äôt really think when I picked it up, or took it to the counter, or gave the check-out lady twenty bucks for it. It was all instinct. Muscle memory. Like I‚Äôd found a part of myself I didn‚Äôt realize was missing, and fused back together with it‚Ä¶

\*

Sorry. I space out a lot lately.

I, um, I took it home. I‚Äôm still living with my parents and my sister, to save money while I work my way through school. I‚Äôm an engineering student. Or trying to be, anyway.

I set the book aside, but it gnawed at the back of my mind the rest of the day. All through dinner, all through catching up on my assignments, all I could think about was the book. I was straight up giddy once I‚Äôd wrapped up what remained of my homework. I must‚Äôve looked like a kid on Christmas when I grabbed it from the bag and sat it on my lap.¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you, fiction? Non fiction?‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt read the title, but I figured that was just a printing error. I ran my hand over the cover. It even¬†*felt*¬†beautiful. I opened it up to the first page, huddled up in the corner of my bed with nothing but my reading light to ward off the dark.

It was unreadable. Every word, hell, every¬†*letter*¬†was completely and totally alien to me, even though it looked like plain English on the surface. I busted out my phone and pulled out google translate, but it was no use. It fit no language. I even tried reading up on ancient hieroglyphics and cuneiform tablets, and still nothing seemed close to what was printed on those pages.¬† I thought maybe it was one massive misprint, like the cover. But there was something too intentional about it. Patterns were there, even if I couldn‚Äôt decipher them.¬†¬†

It was more exciting than frustrating, honestly. Like finding an unfinished puzzle. That was always the sort of thing I loved as a kid. Rubix cubes, rush hour, jigsaws, puzzle books like¬†*Maze*. Something with a secret that was staring back at you just under the surface, waiting for you to find it, to unravel it.¬†

I figured it must be written in some sort of code, so for the next week, codebreaking became my new hobby. I scoured online for any information I could find, checked out books, studied up on dozens of different types of codes. It‚Äôs embarrassing, but I barely touched my studies from university that week, and ended up falling behind for the first time since I was an elementary schooler. I even skipped classes. I couldn‚Äôt help it. None of the problems in my textbook were as fascinating as this one. Every time I tried to take a break and tear myself away from the book, I‚Äôd catch sight of it just out of the corner of my eye, and find myself reaching for it again. I‚Äôd spiral back into it, pages of possible ciphers sprawled on my desk, searching for a match.

No. None of them matched, technically. Didn‚Äôt matter what I tried. Every time I thought I‚Äôd just about cracked it, it would elude me. It was like fishing with my bare hands, the answer always wriggling away at the last second. Codes upon codes, ciphers and ciphers, nothing and more nothing for seven days.

And then, on night 8, hunched over my desk, I caught something.

I don‚Äôt know how to describe it to you, exactly. No, like I said, it wasn‚Äôt one of the ciphers, exactly. It was like‚Ä¶I saw through the pattern. Everything clicked together, just for a second, just at one sentence. A sentence I could finally read.

Yes, I remember what it said. I can‚Äôt forget what it said. It said:

**WHEN THE RABBIT HUNTS THE WOLF AND THE RAIN FALLS FROM THE LAKE, ALL THE WORLD WILL FEAST AND EVERY DREAM WILL WAKE.**

I didn't know what it meant, but it didn‚Äôt matter to me. All I cared about was that I‚Äôd finally gotten something. I‚Äôd¬†*finally*¬†read something.¬†

I should have felt satisfied, I guess. It only made me more obsessed.¬†

\*

‚ÄúDid you really have to bring that thing to the table?‚Äù

I barely heard my sister‚Äôs voice, despite sitting across from her. It had been a week since my initial break-through, and I had been summoned from my seclusion for a family dinner. Of course I brought the book to the table. I brought the book everywhere.

I glanced up from the book at Allie. ‚ÄúI need to study.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat freak book you‚Äôve been touting around is definitely not for a class.‚Äù Alice eyed the book with open disgust, which pissed me off far more than it should have. I felt protective of it.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for a special project,‚Äù I snapped. She snapped some insult back at me, though I barely listened. I just stared down into the book as she kept going on and on about how I‚Äôd been acting different, how I was freaking everyone out, something like that. At the time it was hard to care about what she was saying, because two more sentences revealed themselves.

**DEATH IS A MIRROR**

**THE GIRL CRAWLED THROUGH THE DOOR THAT WAS NOT A DOOR, AND SAW THERE ALL THE HIDDEN THINGS**

They were on two different pages, disconnected. I couldn‚Äôt even tell you what was happening around me at the table. I was so blind with elation that I stood up without another word to my family and locked myself up in the room. I distantly remember them knocking on the door. I ignored them. I ignored everything, and for the next six hours I read and read. Most of the book was still impenetrable to me, but I was picking up more scraps as I went through. They are all still crystal clear in my mind, like they‚Äôre burned there.

**FRUIT LIKE JEWELS GREW FROM THE SKY, AND BLED WHEN THEY WERE PLUCKED**

**HONEY IN THE MOUTH, WORDS OF MILK**

**THE GIRL WALKED UNTIL HER FEET CURLED INTO HOOVES AND BACK AGAIN, UNTIL SHE WAS CERTAIN THIS WORLD HAD NO END AND NO BEGINNING**

The girl? Yeah, she pops up in the book all the time. She‚Äôs the closest thing there is to a character in the story, if you can call it a story. No, she‚Äôs never named. I would have remembered her name.

Anyway, I finally started getting tired. I forced myself to shut the book and laid it on my nightstand. I turned out the light, went to sleep.

And then I dreamed.

I dreamed the things I‚Äôd read in the book. I was walking in this dark, shiny place. Almost like a field, but spotted with things that looked like trees. There was this bright red, swollen fruit hanging in the sky just out of reach, throbbing. It was raining from the ground up, fat droplets seeping out of the soil and flying into the air. I saw a wolf howling and running like its life depended on it. A small hare was hopping at its heels. Ahead of me, I saw a figure through the rain, small and blurry.

And behind me, even though I couldn‚Äôt see it, I knew there was a door.¬†

All this could be explained by my overtired and hyperactive subconscious, I guess. I mean, it‚Äôs not rocket science. Read a ton of a thing, it starts showing up in your dreams. What I can‚Äôt explain was where I was when I woke up in the middle of the night.¬†

I was standing on the ceiling.

Just‚Ä¶standing there. Like I opened my eyes, and there I was, upside down in the living room, the coffee table just above my head.¬† It wasn‚Äôt like my feet were glued there, or anything. It was more like my own personal gravity had been reversed. I could walk back and forth no problem. I thought I was still dreaming, to be honest. It wasn‚Äôt until I looked down at my hands that I realized it was all real.¬†

At that point, I swear my heart straight up froze in my chest. My mind just went totally blank, like it couldn‚Äôt compute what it was seeing. I didn‚Äôt scream, even though I wanted to. I just stood there for a second, feeling like I was going to die from the sheer weirdness of it. Then some kind of instinct told me I should try and get down. I walked nearer to the couch and started jumping, over and over until things reversed again and I fell on the couch. I didn‚Äôt float back up to the ceiling, to my relief. To this day, I have no memory of how I possibly could have gotten up there, not the foggiest clue. After some time curled up on the couch, I convinced myself that I must have hallucinated. That it was some kind of waking dream, a byproduct of sleepwalking. Once I‚Äôd convinced myself, I went back to bed, mentally filing the whole thing away as a weird, one-off incident.

It was just the start.

\*

I started sleepwalking more.

It was a gradual thing. I went a week without any other incidents after the ceiling one, and that was already fading from my mind. The only thing on my mind was the book, really. I picked it up again, went back to trying to decode it. I started picking up more fragments.

**THE GIRL FOUND A LIVING CAVE, AND SQUEEZED HER WAY THROUGH THE DAMP, BREATHING CREVICES UNTIL SHE FOUND BLACK WATER, AND DRANK.**

**THE HUNT CIRCLED THE FIELD AND INTO THE FOREST, WHERE OTHER DOORS WERE.**

It happened again, just like before. One moment I was deep in the dream, not too different from the last one. I was standing in a cave, but it felt more like I was in the belly of some giant being, surrounded by pink and red walls. I started walking until I was in this tight, cramped passage, and then I had to get on my hands and knees and claw my way through. Just when it got so tight that I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I blinked, and I was home again.

In my pajamas. Crammed under the kitchen sink. I‚Äôm a fairly tall dude, so I thought I was going to have to, like,break my legs to get out, but I was just barely able to contort myself out of the space. As far as places go, that was probably the least weird. Three nights after that I woke up walking on my bedroom wall, sideways. Two nights later, I was tangled at the top of a tree in the backyard. The day after that, well, I gave my poor sister a fucking heart attack. She woke up to sounds outside her bedroom window. When she opened it up and looked outside, there I was, tip-toeing along the ledge of the roof, one wrong step away from falling and breaking my neck. She told me later that she freaked out and screamed my name, but that it didn‚Äôt even phase me. She said my eyes were wide open.¬†

She and my mom followed my path below with a mattress in case I fell, while my dad got on the roof to try and yank me back. I know all this second hand, obviously. All I remember is walking along the ridge of a lightning bolt in a black cloud, then waking up duct-taped to my bed.¬†

My family watched me like hawks after that, but it didn‚Äôt do much good. They took me to a dozen specialists, none of whom could find anything wrong with me, besides vague guesses like ‚Äústress‚Äù. They gave me pills that did about as much as tic-tacs might have.¬†

Was I still reading it? Yes. Of course I was. Okay, just‚Äîspare me the look. It was out of my control. Like I said, the book was all I could think of. It was everything. And it was revealing more of itself to me every day. It got to the point that I could read entire pages, unbroken. How was I supposed to just give up when I was finally making progress?

The first time I made it through an entire chapter, maybe a week and a half after the roof incident, I sleepwalked out of my own neighborhood.¬†

I was in the field again beneath a red sky, watching the rain fall upside down, and the rabbit chase the wolf. The hunt was getting more intense. The wolf was inside out now, and missing chunks out of its body. Its pink flesh was mottled with fur and ripped up in several places, trailing blood with every loping step. Sometimes it would cast its eye towards me like it was begging for help, but something in me didn‚Äôt want to help it. I don‚Äôt know why but I was‚Ä¶*pleased*. Satisfied. Like I was watching the gears of nature turn just the way they were meant to, like something out of sorts in the cosmic order had finally been corrected.¬†

I felt the door behind me again. It was farther away than usual, but I could still feel it, a vacuum of energy like a black hole. Ahead of me was the figure with its back to me, less blurry now, and closer. The girl. She didn‚Äôt turn to face me, but I knew she could see me. She raised her hand to beckon me closer, then started walking. I followed.

I know things are different in dreams, but this felt more real than anything ever has in my entire life. I spent years following her, walking and walking, growing old and bent, my feet curving into hooves and back again. She led me in silence through forests of dead and twisted trees, and rotted cities where eyes watched me from the black abysses of the windows, and through the corpses of giants, through the hillsides where beasts cannibalized their young, through rivers of bile, and through places that were nothing but emptiness, cold and soundless voids. I started to think that I would never stop walking, then that I had always¬†*been*¬†walking, and that my whole life on Earth had been nothing but a dream between footsteps.

Finally, she came to a stop.

A black lake stretched in front of us, as far as the eye could see. It looked more like an ocean, now that I think about it, but I knew instinctively that it was a lake. I had this weird sensation that I‚Äôd been there before. That I‚Äôd been there¬†*first*, before I‚Äôd ever been anywhere else. When I dragged myself to the edge of the shore and looked into the water, it was so dark that I couldn‚Äôt see anything underneath. It was like I was looking into space stripped of the stars. I heard the girl speak behind me.

She told me to wade deeper, so I did.

She told me to cup my hands and scoop up the water, so I did.

She told me to drink.

I almost did. I held the water in my palm, thin and inky, ready to spill it down into my mouth. But some, I don‚Äôt know, instinct inside me stopped my arm. Like a little voice in my head that I hadn‚Äôt heard in eons, screaming at me not to drink, to get out of the lake.¬†

The girl told me to drink again, and when I still didn‚Äôt, she started getting angry. She started screaming at me, begging me, slapping her hands against the water, but I still wouldn‚Äôt. I dropped the water from my hand and she came up and shoved me in, but I wasn‚Äôt afraid, because I knew without knowing that there was a door beneath me. And I fell right through it.

I opened my eyes. I was awake now, I could tell. But I was still underwater, and all I could see was the pinprick light of the moon above me. My lungs started tightening up. I felt fish darting between my fingers and silt under my feet, and that made me realize where I was. I swam like a crazy person, flailing and forcing myself up through the water before I ran out of the sour air that was sitting in my chest. As if it had been held there in suspension. When I finally broke through the surface, I was shivering so hard that I had to claw my way over the shore. I was at the local park. I had been standing at the bottom of the pond, for God knows how long.¬†

I walked two miles back to my house, soaked and cold to the bone. I thought my feet were going to fall right off by the time I finally stumbled into my house, and my parents were so freaked that they rushed me to the ER. Things got more serious after that.

They started chaining me to the bed, if you can believe it. They tried everything, actually. They cuffed my wrists to the bedframe, tied my ankles to cinderblocks, barricaded my doors and windows, even installed a security system throughout the house so that an alarm would blare if I sleepwalked out. None of it worked. Somehow, the restraints always came undone, the barricade always collapsed, the alarm always failed to trip. And I would dream of that strange, addicting world, and wake up halfway across town.¬†

Oh, of course they tried to take the book from me. I hid it. I hid it in a space between the walls that hadn‚Äôt been there before I got the book. It was like the house had contorted itself to help me, to safeguard the one thing that gave me purpose. I know how that sounds, but by then I was at the point where I could almost read the whole book, and the things it said mesmerized me. The girl had become a queen in that world, or maybe a god. The beasts obeyed her. The trees yielded their flesh and fed her off their vines. She could dig valleys with her bare hands, or bring the dead cities back to life. Something like life, I mean. The point is, the more time she spent in the world and became part of it, the more command she had over it. I was proud of her.

No, actually. I was envious of her.

\*\*\*

¬†In light of everything else failing, my family took to keeping watch over me, sleeping in shifts. They still tied me to the bed on top of that, but they said the bonds always came undone one way or another, no matter how secure they made them. My mom says it was easy to tell when I was about to sleepwalk. My eyes would snap open, but there‚Äôd be nothing behind them. Like they were glass. My family was calling doctors and specialists around the country, scheduling consultations and looking into new medications for me to take. I felt sort of distant from it all, to be honest. The time I was awake was what felt like a dream. Everything in this world felt 2D, a cardboard stage set, like a cheap movie playing out around me until it was time to return to reality.¬†

The only thing that kept me anchored was the book. I had almost read the entire thing. The wolf was nearly dead, the rabbit nearly fed. The girl was still searching for something.

A surreal, sleepless week passed as I was constantly being woken up by my family members throughout the night, yanked out of that other world just as I was getting my bearings. It was disorienting, like being flipped upside down and then right-side up again, over and over, until I couldn‚Äôt tell which was which. I actually started to resent my family, as crazy as that sounds. The rational part of my brain was checked out, and what was left saw them as jailers.¬†

Finally, the guard faltered. It was one, maybe two AM. The moon outside my window was so supernaturally bright, it looked blinding. It made the entire room stark white, sharp and skeletal. My sister had nodded off in my computer chair. For the first time in what felt like forever, I wasn‚Äôt being watched.¬†

I sat up in bed for a minute, just kind of blank. I hadn‚Äôt woken up from any dream. It felt almost nostalgic to have just casually woken up in my room, in my bed. No sleepwalking, no visions. Just my room. Just as I started to lay back down, I felt it.

A door. Somewhere, out of sight, but definitely there. The same door that I always felt behind me in my dreams, that powerful absence. Except it wasn‚Äôt behind me now, but somewhere farther down. Somewhere in the house.

I silently crept out of bed, careful not to wake Ally. I started following the feeling, looking for the door. Something in the back of my head knew this was a fucking stupid idea, but the rest of me couldn‚Äôt help myself. I mean, it was in my¬†*house*¬†now. I had to find it.

The feeling led me down the hall, and‚Äîoh, um. I mean, it‚Äôs hard to describe. It‚Äôs like nothingness, or a vacuum, or a place where all the air‚Äôs gone out. But it‚Äôs heavy. Suffocating, even. Yeah, suffocating. That was the feeling. And it drew me in, pulled me along, until I stepped into the hall bathroom. I knew as soon as I did that this was the closest I‚Äôd ever been to the door. It was immediate, like the gravity of it was just shy of crushing me. My vision blurred for a second from the headache it gave me. Once it snapped into focus, I found myself standing in front of the mirror.

And there she was.

The girl was staring back at me from the other side of the mirror. Finally,¬†*finally,*¬†I could see her face, and it was beautiful, and it was horrific, a little girl‚Äôs face that had never been allowed to grow up but instead got pulled through eons and eons, warped into something just on the other side of human. And the field and the rain was behind her, and the rabbit was ripping into the body of the wolf, tearing off massive, bloody bites.¬†

The girl stared into my eyes and pressed her hand against the glass. I pressed mine against hers. The glass between us felt so thin. I could almost feel the cold coming off her skin. Her mouth moved as she said something to me, but it was muffled.¬†

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt hear you,‚Äù I whispered. Her mouth shut. With her other hand, she motioned for me to come closer. I leaned in close until my head was pressed up right against the mirror. She kept her hand against the glass, over mine. She moved closer and spoke in a low gurgle.

**‚ÄúTHIS DOOR IS NOT A DOOR.‚Äù**

Then her hand shot through the glass and closed over mine.

Her nails were like claws, sinking into my skin as she tried to pull me through. The mirror splintered where my wrist entered, cutting the skin and dripping blood all over the bathroom counter. Some animal part of me finally woke up and I started screaming and trying to pull myself out of her grip, but it was¬†*iron.*¬†We were locked in this fucked-up tug of war as she kept trying to force me through the mirror. God, I‚Äôve never screamed so loud. My heart was beating so fast I thought it was going to fucking seize, and every time she managed to pull me deeper it was like my skin was being torn off the muscle. At some point she got me as far as my shoulder, but I kept screaming and fighting and trying to pull myself out, until I heard the bathroom door slam open behind me.

‚ÄúOh my god,¬†*WHO IS THAT?*‚Äù Allie screamed and grabbed the back of my shirt, trying to pull me away as the girl in the mirror started screaming and roaring too. ‚Äú*WHAT IS THAT?*‚Äù

I had to brace my leg against the sink to get some leverage, and the girl sunk her nails so deep into my arm I thought I could feel them scraping my bones. Allie had her arms around my waist and was pulling and sobbing, just screaming over and over ‚Äúwhat is that, what is that.‚Äù It was obviously enough to wake up my parents, and they came rushing in. My mom passed out as soon as she saw it. Just heaved and hit the floor. My dad went into fight mode, not even screaming or pausing, just lunged forward and grabbed me, pulling me by the torso. Finally I started slipping backwards, the three of us working together able to yank my arm back out of the mirror inch by inch, spraying blood everywhere. I didn‚Äôt even feel the cuts at that point. It was nothing but adrenaline pumping through me. Nothing but the fight, the need to survive.

My dad and sister got me out with one final pull. We all went falling down to floor. The girl screamed again and started banging her hands against the glass, over and over until my dad couldn‚Äôt take it any more. He ran out to the garage and came back with a hammer. He slammed it into the mirror over and over until the girl‚Äôs screaming cut out and the field was gone, the shards of our mirror dropping off and peppering the countertop. The air changed as soon as he‚Äôd finished. The heaviness lifted away.

The door was gone.

**END OF CHESTER‚ÄôS ACCOUNT**

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt have it around me anymore,‚Äù Chester said after he‚Äôd told me the whole story. He stared down at the book with something straddling the edge of hatred and longing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt be able to stop myself from picking it back up again, and then she‚Äôll have me for good. The mirror thing snapped me out of it for a little while, but I don‚Äôt know how long it will stay that way.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never have to see it again,‚Äù I promised him.¬† ‚ÄúYou ever miss that other world, out of curiosity?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather not answer,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWell, do you still have those dreams about it?‚Äù

Chester got up to leave, then paused. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt dream at all anymore.‚Äù

\*

So that was that. As per usual, any names in the above account have been changed for privacy reasons. Also as per usual, I‚Äôm doing my due diligence on the research front, but it‚Äôs slow going. I haven‚Äôt been able to figure out when and where the book was printed yet, and I don‚Äôt have the necessary precautions in place to risk reading it for myself. Unlike Chester, I‚Äôve got no family to yank me out the mirror if things go wrong, and Midge lacks the requisite opposable thumbs. Chester provided a few, very sparse details on the girl. She wore a ripped up dress that ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù was Victorian-era. If I‚Äôm looking for Victorian-era girls in the area who disappeared under mysterious circumstances, well, it will be a long search. I‚Äôll do my best, though.

That only left one lead to follow up on, which was the place Chester bought it from, Fort‚Äôs Corner. I went, and he wasn‚Äôt lying. It‚Äôs aggressively, disappointingly normal (though they get bonus points from me for the cat that hangs out in the window).¬† I perused the shelves, didn‚Äôt find anything notable. I had Midge with me, and though she seemed on edge, she didn‚Äôt bark at anything in the store. Before I left, I took the book to the front desk to chat with the owner of the establishment, a blond woman in her late twenties decked out in crystal jewelry.¬†

‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶‚Äù she said, pursing her lips as she casually flipped through the books. ‚ÄúGosh, I‚Äôm sorry. I don‚Äôt even remember this coming in. I wish I could tell you more. Was there something wrong with it, are you looking to return it?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, not at all,‚Äù I said, snatching the book back. ‚ÄúI was just looking for more information about it. Thanks for your help.‚Äù

‚ÄúAny time. Come again soon!‚Äù She smiled and waved at me, and I started for the door.¬†

Just as we were about to leave, Midge ground to a halt. She looked up at the cat, took a stumbling step backward, and growled.¬†

‚ÄúMidge, cut that out!‚Äù I tried to pull her out, but she growled the entire time, whining and staring down that cat, which stayed still as a statue on the windowsill. It didn‚Äôt even look at her. Instead it looked at me. Then, it looked at the book.

For the split second the cat‚Äôs eyes met mine, there was something almost human in its gaze, calculating even. Like it knew exactly who I was, and what I had in my hands.¬†

Anyway, I couldn‚Äôt let Midge tear up the store while she was working herself up into a frenzy, so I had to drag her out, and off ran the cat behind the register.

I‚Äôm still not sure the shop had anything to do with the strangeness of the book, though Midge doesn‚Äôt growl for nothing. But at the end of the day, I‚Äôve got no proof of anything nefarious, and no damn answers. I just have to file this whole thing under the cursed ‚Äòcurrently unsolved‚Äô category.

[\[Part Two\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1o1il3f/the_perfect_day_to_wake_up_part_two/)

I didn‚Äôt sleep much that night.

Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the words:¬†*We see you.*¬†Not just as text, as if someone had carved them behind my eyelids. I tried telling myself it was just stress. Work, routine, caffeine. But every thought looped back to the same whisper I‚Äôd heard in the bathroom:¬†*Wake up.*

By morning, I felt hollow. I didn‚Äôt shower. Didn‚Äôt make toast. Just sat there, watching my watch tick. I thought if I stared long enough, maybe I‚Äôd catch it twitch again.

It didn‚Äôt. It was perfect. Too perfect.

At 6:17 a.m., my alarm still went off.

I hadn‚Äôt even set it.

The sound made me jump. My heart felt like it was trying to punch through my chest.

I turned it off, grabbed my keys, and decided not to go to work today. Not the caf√©, not the office. I‚Äôd drive somewhere else. Anywhere else.

When I stepped outside, the air felt heavier. Thicker. Like breathing through fabric. The neighborhood was exactly the same, same lawns, same houses, same cars parked in the same places. Not one curtain moved.

As I pulled out of the driveway, I glanced at the car‚Äôs clock.  
6:43 a.m.

When I reached the main road, it was still 6:43 a.m.

The numbers didn‚Äôt move.

The highway was empty, the horizon a washed-out blur. I drove faster. A long stretch of road wound through fields, but after a few miles, the scenery repeated. The same cracked billboard, the same bent road sign, the same dead crow on the shoulder.

At first, I thought it was d√©j√† vu. Then I realized, it wasn‚Äôt¬†*similar.*  
It was identical.

I passed the same scene five times before slamming the brakes.

The engine idled, low and uneven. I sat there gripping the steering wheel, watching heat shimmer on the asphalt.

I turned on the radio.

Static.

Then, faintly, a voice came through, calm, polite, rehearsed.

*‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs okay, Daniel. Go home.‚Äù*

My stomach dropped.

It was¬†*my name.*

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre having a bad day, Daniel. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù*

I switched the radio off. My hands were shaking.

When I turned the car around, the clock jumped to 7:02 a.m.

The sun brightened suddenly, too bright, like someone had turned up a dimmer switch. The light hit everything evenly, no shadows, no depth.

By the time I pulled back into my street, people were outside.

Joggers. Dog walkers. Neighbors. All of them smiling too wide. All of them turning their heads in perfect unison when my car rolled past.

One of them waved.

Her lips didn‚Äôt move, but I heard her voice inside my head, as clear as if she were sitting next to me:

*‚ÄúWelcome back.‚Äù*

I nearly crashed into my mailbox.

I ran inside, locked the door, and sat against it. My breathing came out ragged, hands shaking.

I tried calling my sister. She lived two states away. She‚Äôd know how to calm me down, tell me it was all in my head.

The call rang once.

Then a click.

And her voice:¬†*‚ÄúHey, Danny.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúHey,‚Äù*¬†I said, forcing a laugh.¬†*‚ÄúI just-uh, weird question. Can you tell me what day it is?‚Äù*

A pause.

Then she laughed, soft and mechanical.

*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the perfect day.‚Äù*

My blood ran cold.

*‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the perfect day, Danny. It‚Äôs always been the perfect day.‚Äù*

I hung up. The phone buzzed in my hand, same number calling back. I threw it onto the couch.

I sat there for what felt like hours, trying to steady my breathing. My reflection in the TV screen looked pale, distant. Then the TV turned on by itself.

No static this time. Just my house. Live feed.

The camera angle was impossible, from the ceiling, looking down at¬†*me.*

I stared at myself staring back.

Then a voice, male this time, calm, reassuring, spoke from the television:

*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt panic, Daniel. You‚Äôre doing great.‚Äù*

I stumbled backward, nearly tripping over the coffee table.

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been adjusting well. Small inconsistencies are normal during observation.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù*¬†I shouted.

No response.

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe here.‚Äù*

I hurled the remote at the screen. It cracked, flickered, and went black. My heart was hammering so hard I thought I might pass out.

Then I heard it, a faint knock at the door.

Three slow knocks.

I froze.

The peephole was dark, like someone had covered it with their hand.

*‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù*¬†I called out, voice shaking.

A pause. Then:

*‚ÄúYour coffee.‚Äù*

The barista‚Äôs voice. The one from the caf√©.

I stepped back, the floor creaking beneath me.

*‚ÄúYou forgot your coffee, Daniel.‚Äù*

Another knock. Louder.

*‚ÄúYou have to stay on schedule.‚Äù*

I backed away until my legs hit the couch.

Then my phone buzzed on the cushion. One new text. No number.

**DO NOT ANSWER THE DOOR**

I stared at the message, then at the door.

The knocking stopped.

Silence.

After a long moment, I crept forward and peered through the peephole.

No one there.

Just the street, still, empty, washed in white light.

Then, faintly, from somewhere far beyond the walls of my house, I heard the applause.

A crowd. Cheering.

And above it all, a voice echoing through unseen speakers:

1o2j3pv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Total-Shelter8915/comments/1o2j3pv/operation_zero_coffee/,Operation Zero Coffee,"**Operation Zero Coffee** has been conceived as a primary quest trailhead within a Life Gamification Matrix. That conception makes Operation Zero Coffee a Level 1 quest, and the completion of the quest partially opens a larger Level 2 Desired Life Quest (DLQ) mission tree.

**Why Operation Zero Coffee?** I'm seriously addicted to coffee and want to transform the coffee addiction into a manageable inclusion in my life. The addiction is serious enough that I've gone into fairly severe withdrawal symptoms if I 1) don't have enough coffee or 2) don't have enough coffee early enough in the day. The muscles in my neck and back begin to spasm, then the muscle spasm gets into my neck, then that spasm turns into a right sided rams horn migraine. Then I'll get nauseous and begin throwing up if I don't have any coffee after the onset of the headache, and these symptoms will last for between 48 and 72 hours. And, most importantly, I'm absolutely fully tired of mismanaging this part of my life and want a better relationship with coffee. Here's 2 big reasons why:

1) I recently dipped my toes into ""*seeking RRR (real romantic relationship)""* waters after a long time away from romantic relationship and dating. Then I realized, ""Wow... I need to get my shit together because my life isn't ready to receive someone into it."" And a small part of the future I want to build with someone involves occasional special coffee dates rather than an addiction that necessitates the daily gluttony of slurping Folgers and Maxwell House out of a coffee pot. In other words, part of getting my shit together is preparing to transform coffee into something to look forward to instead of the stress of an impactful daily obligation.

2) Overcoming the caffeine addiction eliminates an unnecessary survival risk in the event that shit hits the fan and I can't get a morning cup of coffee at some time during a crisis. For instance, what if the zombie apocalypse starts, I can't get a coffee, then I can't fight off the zombies anywhere close to peak efficiency because I'd be puking and unable to think optimally because of a migraine. So lowering my daily coffee requirement to zero 1) ups the survival odds for me and my loved ones and 2) improves general quality of life by removing the stress of a rigid daily consumption requirement in order to avoid debilitating sickness. I personally think both  of those improvements makes the quest a moral obligation in my life if I intend to honor my confession of love for my family and neighbors.

So I decided to try the Taper Method where I slowly reduce my coffee intake over a period of time. I also made a chart to track my coffee intake my way to Zero Cups. Here's the chart.

https://preview.redd.it/uytrdmaek5uf1.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=bef3a1cfe39baeadab2e3bea3d093ddc4193b575

I didn't realize what day it was when I started the chart, so the coffee intake checkmarks (one check per cup) for 'Thursday' and 'Friday' in the first week on the chart actually coincide with coffee intake for 'Tuesday' and 'Wednesday.' 

*First evidence that the Operation Coffee Zero DLQ is helping me get my shit together:* now I know what day it is.

The Operation Zero Coffee chart starts on Tuesday, September 30th, 2025.

**Operation Zero Coffee Journal**

**SEPT 30:** Difficult start to the challenge. You would think that 'only drink 6 cups of coffee today' would be fairly straightforward, but it isn't. I can't believe how out of control I've been and how habituated I am to pouring coffee out of the coffee pot. Have caught myself pouring from the pot without thinking about it twice. 

Some neighbors showed up for an unexpected visit this afternoon. That means they showed up ""for coffee."" So that meant brewing a fresh pot of coffee when I was already maxed out on cups and shocked by how wildly my mind was reacting to having a restriction imposed on my coffee intact. It's like there's something in my head trying to convince me to have an extra cup of coffee. And it's crazy that random coffee company happened to stop in the day I decided to make this change. It's like temptation was yelling ""NOOOOO!!! DON'T COMPLETE YOUR QUEST!!!"" right out of the gate. Here's two notes I made after they left and there was still coffee in the coffee pot.

5:23PM: Extreme coffee craving. Coffee pot bubbled as I walked by.

5:38PM Coffee pot makes that little buzz/hiss/sizzle and clicks, and it set off another craving in me. It's honestly crazy how much it effects me. I can't imagine how hard it is to quit hard drugs because I looked at the coffee pot and making eye contact with the blue light on it made my throat feel tight and my body feel like it wanted to lurch toward the coffee. This quest might be really difficult.

OCT 1: Woke up this morning and coffee was the first thing on my mind. Interesting to note that the idea of restricting the number of cups of coffee I'm going to drink wakes up some kind of frantic anxiety in me. I've also how fast I drink coffee. There's no enjoyment in it. Don't even taste most of it. 

More company showed up and more afternoon coffee happened. It's actually blowing my mind that company showed up for afternoon coffee the first two days after the rallying point in my DLQ effort has been ""DO NOT BREW AFTERNOON POT OF COFFEE.""

Still having major cravings. Body going berserk every time I walk by the coffee pot. But I managed to keep it to six cups today, though I'm kind of horrified by how much control coffee has in my life. Glad I'm attacking this addiction.

Since the last update, my wife has been recording the kids playing and taking notes of every time the neighbors bang on the ceiling. It's been 2 weeks since my landlord told me the neighbors aren't on a lease and if they complain again or bother us, he'll evict them. 

Well, today has been a day. My 2 older kids were at school, my 2 year old was napping, as were my wife and I. I don't know what they were doing downstairs but it was literally shaking the whole house and woke both me and my wife up. On top of that, they were making an insane amount of noise. Like they were trying to be loud on purpose. We ignored it and went and picked the kids up from school.

When we got back, my oldest went to her room to clean it and my son sat down at the coffee table to do homework. My wife was helping him while I sat in a chair talking to her. My two year old was walking around when the neighbors started BANGING on the ceiling due to the noise from my 2 year old's heavy walk. I got very frustrated and banged back. The noise from downstairs increased 100x and they started running very heavily all around and banging the ceiling. I recorded the incident and sent it to my landlord. I called and left a voicemail, basically at my wits end and how it's unfair for us to not be able to live in our apartment because the neighbors don't even want us walking around. My wife has been taking the kids to the park until dusk just to get out of the house and not have to listen to the constant banging on the ceiling. She's literally been carrying a 35# 2 year old on her back at home so the baby doesn't walk around so heavily. It's completely unfair though.

My landlord called me back to let me know he sent them an eviction notice and they have 30 days to get out. Said they are being completely unreasonable living in an apartment and agreed it isn't fair to us. I feel terrible but at the same time it's a relief. I just want to enjoy my home without being harassed (which my landlord agrees they are 100% harassing us).

Once they are out, we do plan on moving downstairs to avoid this in the future. I'm just glad my landlord saw this from our point of view. We really did try to do everything we could INCLUDING looking at pieces of carpet that'd fit the entire rooms like rugs. But we shouldn't have to do that just to appease people who are doing nothing to appease us.

So yeah, my final update (hopefully). My neighbors from hell are moving out. We have a really good landlord looking out for us.

**Pod By The Bakery Door**



Rudie and his mama arrived at the bakery caf√©.

There was nothing strange about it, just an ordinary day.

The sky was blue, the air was crisp, a beautiful spring day.

Bread, pastries, rolls and cakes were fresh and on display.

Mama said: ‚ÄúFirst my coffee, and then we‚Äôll go and play‚Äù

¬†

Mama and Rudie got in line behind a man in a football shirt

It had the number three on the back.

He ordered a very particular coffee:

‚ÄúA strong flat white, three quarters full, please‚Äù

¬†

Within moments, the lady in the bakery handed a coffee to the man.

She was so quick that Rudie thought she had magicked it out of thin air,

But when the man saw his coffee, his face began to turn red‚Ä¶

¬†

‚ÄúI asked for a strong flat white, three quarters full!‚Äù roared the man

‚ÄúThis is clearly seven eights full, its undrinkable,‚Äù said the man

He looked very cross as he went back to recording podcast by the door

¬†

Long story short, we gave dating another shot. After a few more months, I still felt something was off- I just couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it.

I decided to go back to school for my masters and between work and school, I became really busy with only a night or two a week of free time. He would get mad and constantly say how he wasn‚Äôt a priority. The ick was back and I ended things again. He sent over 10k worth of gifts to my apartment‚Ä¶..and bought me a car.

I first dissolved the tablets in minimal amount of water (CCA 100 ml / g of dehumidifier) (during which some insoluble crap was left floating on top of the water) then hot vacuum filtration trough coffee filter and cotton plug.

I want something that he‚Äôll actually love and I‚Äôve budgeted 800$-1000$ for it. The best option would be to simply ask what he wants but I don‚Äôt want to ruin the surprise, also he would never let me spend more than 50$ on a birthday present.

I know it‚Äôs a very broad ask‚Ä¶ all I know is he pretty much only makes espresso, has a standalone grinder and gets his coffee beans from a specialty italian shop. He always looks at the machines there in awe so I‚Äôm guessing he would prefer italian??

Six years together ‚Äî we grew up side by side. We survived college, first jobs, moving in, all the ‚Äúwe‚Äôll figure it out together‚Äù moments. Now I wake up, and my phone doesn‚Äôt light up with her name anymore.

It‚Äôs strange how someone can become part of your identity without you even realizing it. My days used to orbit around her ‚Äî morning coffee together, late-night ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù talks about the future. Now I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ here.

I‚Äôve tried to distract myself ‚Äî gym, friends, new hobbies ‚Äî but nothing fills that silence when I come home.

I keep replaying the last conversation we had. She said she didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúus‚Äù anymore. I didn‚Äôt even argue. I just stood there, numb. Maybe part of me already knew.

I‚Äôm writing this because I know some of you have been here. How do you stop your mind from looping back to what could‚Äôve been? How do you rebuild yourself when half of who you were walked away?

I‚Äôm trying to focus on healing, one day at a time. Journaling, therapy, even reading books about letting go. If anyone wants to share what helped them find peace, I‚Äôd love to hear it.

Maybe someday I‚Äôll write about this properly ‚Äî not from the pain, but from the strength that comes after. For now, I just needed to get it out.

1o2i2al,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1o2i2al/i_have_done_something_unforgivable_i_feel_so/,I have done something unforgivable I feel so stupid,"About a month ago I started meds again due to depression. I was pretty confident I did not have bipolar because I felt I had been pretty consistently stable without meds for 9 months. I also had quite a few other reasons and doubts from the beginning. In hindsight yes I was stable in the sense I was consistently incredibly anxious and suicidal and sometimes depressed. Though it felt better than how I felt with meds before. 

About a month ago I did feel like I needed some kind of additional help because I was quite suicidal and depressed and I thought I had adhd. I was already seeing a therapist regularly. I got put on a low dose lamictal even though I expected(+wanted) an antidepressant. It actually worked wonderfully, for like a week. Or it was placebo since it felt like it worked within a day. My constant anxiety, nausea, heart palpitations and general feeling of ""off""-ness went away. I had 6 days or so of feeling so normal. 

Around 3 days ago I started to feel constantly anxious with the nausea and heart pain again. I thought the placebo had worn off or something, and I knew lamictal can take a bit to kick in and I mainly just felt really anxious. Oh and very very high libido, but I had libido similar to this in the past so I didn't think much of it. Also I asked what warning signs I shouls call for during the previous check up. She said that if I'm sleeping 2-4 hours a day or so then that's a big sign. And psychosis, suicidal. I told her Ive been sleeping about 6-7 hrs a day recently, which is less than the usual (9-11hrs) and she said that 10hrs seems more on the depressed side and 6-7hrs is not too worrisome. So yeah Im honestly not sure if this was even an episode or if Im just a horrible person because I did notice that I felt different even during the past 3 days. So I had a level of awareness. And also I'm still sleeping at least 5-6hrs a day. 

Im not sure if this was an episode or not. I did not feel euphoric, or grandiose, or slept very little. And I definitely felt exhausted + the need to sleep the whole time. I mainly just felt constant anxiety, horniness, and feeling like I drank 10 coffees but without any extra energy or alertness, just the jitteriness and heart fluttering. I dont know why I would do this, I knew it was a horrible idea. 

I cheated, and also in the most scary disgusting risky dangerous way. The funny thing is just a few weeks ago I was having nightmares about SA about 5x/week for months. It's literally the worst fucking idea I hate myself why would I do this. I dont know what to say, I feel so so stupid and disgusting and wrong. And it's just my fault, I have no explanation, theres no one to blame except myself. My appointment was next monday and I thought I could wait to talk about the anxiety then. Im such a dumbass, ok thats all. ",1,1760044331.0,BipolarReddit,3,0.67,False

***‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a monster,‚Äù*** he whispered.

I checked. Just shirts, shoes, dust. I told him there were no monsters, not in this house, not ever. He nodded, but his hands stayed balled in fists.

The second night, it happened again. The third night, I was running on fumes. I sat in the kitchen with the radio playing while I made coffee.

***‚Äú‚Ä¶another disappearance possibly linked to the so called Sleepover Man. No suspects are in custody.‚Äù***

I switched it off fast. Couldn‚Äôt stomach it. But the name stuck in my head.

That night, around two, I heard Tommy again, not screaming this time. Talking.

***‚ÄùI don‚Äôt like that game,‚Äù*** he whispered. ***‚ÄúThe other kids maybe liked it, but I don‚Äôt.‚Äù***

Every hair on my body stood up.

I pushed open his door. He sat rigid in bed, staring at the closet.

***‚ÄúWho are you talking to?‚Äù***

His eyes flicked to me, wide and wet. ***‚ÄúDon‚Äôt check,‚Äù*** he whispered. ***‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt like when you check.‚Äù***

I yanked the closet open. Shadows and coats. Nothing else.

But I didn‚Äôt sleep.

On the fourth night, the whispers returned. Tommy‚Äôs voice. Then another replied innocent, though too deep to be a child‚Äôs.

I ran.

The closet was open. And crouched by the bed was a man.

He was half-naked, skin stretched thin over ribs, his chest slick with sweat. His legs bent wrong, knees jutting sideways as he rolled his body in a strange, rocking dance across the floor. His shoulders popped in and out of joint, elbows twisting backwards, bones grinding with each jerky sway.

His grin tore across dehydrated lips as his eyes locked on mine. He sang in a child‚Äôs singsong, off-key and breathless: 

***‚ÄúHush, little baby, don‚Äôt say a word‚Ä¶‚Äù***

Tommy whimpered. ***‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make him mad, Daddy.‚Äù***

The man‚Äôs head lolled too far to the side, vertebrae clicking, neck drooping at an impossible angle. Then he dropped lower, limbs splayed, crawling spider-like across the floorboards. The stench rolled over me. Sour, unwashed, thick with rot.

My chest seized.

His spine arched as he pressed himself toward the closet again. One shoulder folded in with a wet pop, ribs scraping, arms jerking as he dragged himself backward into the dark. Behind him, I glimpsed a cut panel in the wall, edges worn smooth, a passage swallowed by black Eyes never leaving mine until the shadows swallowed him whole.

The wood rattled once. Then silence.

I lunged, grabbed Tommy, pulled him into my arms. His face buried in my neck, hot with tears.

***‚ÄúDaddy,‚Äù*** he whispered, voice tiny. ***‚ÄúHe says he‚Äôll wait. He always waits.‚Äù***

I pressed my back to the door, heart hammering, listening to the walls breathe until morning.

Context:

Decided I'd stop for lunch for the first time in years since my local diner was closed due to a power outage, and holy crap it was the most miserable experience I've had in ages with a restaurant. 

I ordered my food on their new fangled electric menu board... No receipt... First thing that confused me, literally everywhere else prints a receipt... 

Then I waited by the ready counter for 17 minutes. I was on the phone so I didn't much notice the time, until I got off and realized, where is my order? I was one of the only people in there, everyone else was seated already/still, and not once did I see anything come through, and no one took my order, nothing... Suddenly a little old lady, (The only good employee there...) came by off her break in the back and asked what I was waiting for, and I responded with my name and order as I pointed at their bulletin board with my name on it. She asked the others ""has anyone looked at the order screen since I went on break?"" to which the one employee, they said ""ugh lady, I'm not in charge of that."" And stormed off... And the other (couldn't understand what she said though it was very anti-accountability) started berating the older lady and yelling at her, before finally starting my food... The old lady made my coffee and packed my timbits. Gave it to me. Good. Just need the food then. 

When I finally got the food from the other girl? Wrong... It was supposed to be a lime cilantro chicken wrap, instead it was a bowl... She said ""Bit of a mix-up, but this is better actually! Enjoy!"" And just walked off... No sorry. Nothing... I got what tasted like a spicy mayo blended tomato rice bowl with olives and whole sheets of lettuce for some reason, with like 4 pieces of what I assume was once a singular chicken strip... No cucumber, no actual tomatoes, nothing like the wrap was supposed to have... Didn't even have any lime, or cilantro... Just pure trash.

How are these franchises still running? The employees don't know their feet from their head... Can't get an order right... Make people wait 30 minutes for ""fast food""... And it cost like 9$ for the ""wrap"" alone... Is this an every day occurence? Or did I just get ""unlucky""? 

Also, the fact that ""complaint"" is a flair or tag on this subreddit alone is wild to me... That's indicative of a greater problem...",17,1760043839.0,TimHortons,20,0.73,False

I (22F) just got diagnosed with iron deficiency w/o anemia (ferritin of 11, everything else was within a normal range). It's a battle to get out of bed, I sleep for 12 hours when I don't set an alarm, and I've been very depressed and irritable. I'm also shedding hair like crazy, it's hard to stand for more than a few minutes at a time, and I get short of breath while walking. My doctor instructed me to take 65mg of ferrous sulfate (I use the CVS branded one) twice a day, every day. Slight tangent: I recently stumbled upon some research suggesting that supplementing every other day might be more effective which I shared with my doc but I haven't gotten a reply yet. My doctor is also trying to get IV iron approved but she said it's unlikely to go through since I'm not anemic and I don't have other risk factors.

While I try to get my iron levels up, I was wondering how to stay positive emotionally, especially around my fianc√©, because my mood and energy has been so low and I don't want to drag him down. He has extremely high levels of empathy and he feels everything I feel, times 10. I'm trying so hard not to be absolutely miserable all the time. Coffee used to help but I think I'm either building a tolerance or my condition is worsening (I heard that once you start supplementing, sometimes it gets worse before it gets better).

Also, how did you guys get approved for IV iron as a first line treatment? I really think this is the best approach. I've heard stories of people only feeling better 7 months after oral supplementation but I can't afford to wait that long. I'm a college student in my last semester.

Today's prayer softly whispers: ""I welcome the bonds of friendship, that I may draw nearer to unity with my fellows and with the Divine.""

Selfishness and self-centeredness are indeed the roots of our troubles. We are driven by a thousand subtle fears, of losing, of not getting, of being less than. And so, we stumble and tread upon the tender feet of those who love us most, our families, our friends, our spiritual companions.

Through life's trials I have tried to dodge the consequences of my own actions, to stop drinking without truly letting go of the drink. But it was the gift of desperation that finally broke the illusion. Out of defeat, I found the first stirrings of humility.

True humility is not humiliation, it is the quiet willingness to seek and to do God's will. It is born of pain, for pain is the touchstone of all spiritual growth. When we cease fighting everyone and everything, we begin to glimpse peace.

My sponsor once told me, **""It takes a long time, with much water and scrubbing, to wash the mud off a pig. Growth takes time, and it begins with love.""**
And that is what you gave me, you loved me before I could love myself. You showed me humility, not by thinking less of myself, but by thinking more of others. You taught me to ask, ""What can I bring?"" instead of ""What can I get away with?""

We are not asked for perfection, only for progress, for a willing and open heart. My rightful place is here, in the eternal now. **To live this day fully, to serve with gentleness and good humor.**

I like to think that I belong at the back of the complaint line, handing out cups of water, coffee, and tea, cheerfully letting others go before me. And on Sundays, I'll make smoothies too.

Because love, service, and humility are one and the same path.

I love you all.",2,1760043656.0,alcoholicsanonymous,0,1.0,False

(He was taking cannabis for a while beforehand and does purple liquid, then in the last month before I left, emitted multiple strong smells at random nights (a sweet smell, a burnt plastic/oily smell, a paint thinner smell)

The particle that makes me especially sick (paint thinner at high concentrations, sweet smell when sedimented) when exposed, gave me a headache, nausea, dizziness, and can't walk straight. It also sticks to clothes and non-porous surfaces and can't be cleaned with a washing machine. 

At lower, third-hand doze, I get the following symptoms:

1. Brain fog when attempting to remember events occured during exposure (I can recall memories, but get a bad headache around the parietal lobe area (center-up of head when attempting to do so)
2. Very low motivation
3. Burst of libido into extremely low libido for a lengthened period of time
4. Nasal irritation
5. Very focused and alert, then get very sleepy soon after / relaxed and sleepy (I have not been tested, but might have slight ADHD) - results in unable to sleep, especially if there is any contamination of the pillow

However, I believe that I personally, am extremely sensitive to said particle, as short-term exposure from my mother is unable to feel any of the above effects I had mentioned. It is also very unlikely to be mental issues as I can do blind-tests and can feel the effects from the correct, affected clothes.

It becomes lighter when washed, but 2-3 washes is still far from making the clothes clean enough to not make me sick when wearing it - it is wipable off hard, metallic surfaces like a computer case, but porous plastic is basically uncleanable and I've thrown away all of it

Extra info: I get headaches with one sip of energy drinks/coffee, and should (not confirmed with doctor but symptoms match) have a mild case of adhd

Then there is Lee Dong Wook‚Ä¶ such a beautiful man. My goodness. So much depth to his character too, much like all of them. I definitely plan to watch more of his stuff after this.

Though I know of her, I‚Äôd never seen Kim Go Eun in anything. As someone who had a difficult life growing up, her character was one that I felt so connected to. And when she cried, I cried. When she was smiling, I was too. 

Yoo In-na I saw in Touch Your Heart, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Her character here was sweet but also super cool. I actually have Bo-ra on my list of shows to watch next as well. 

Overall, the acting was incredible. Every episode and every moment had a purpose. I didn‚Äôt feel like skipping anything or wishing it would end. It was just perfect to me.

1o2hko9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1o2hko9/from_ghost_to_roommate_a_skeptics_story_of_living/,From Ghost to Roommate? A skeptics story of living with an entity.,"The first rule of real estate is location, location, location. The second, unwritten rule, is that if you find a deal that seems too good to be true, you don‚Äôt ask questions. You just sign the lease. That‚Äôs what I did back in 2018. A three-bedroom, two-bath town home for $1500 a month was a steal even then. Today, in 2025, with the market rate for a comparable place pushing three grand, it‚Äôs nothing short of a miracle. The landlord, a sweet old woman who lives in Oregon (a few states away), has never once raised the rent. For a single dad with an 11-year-old son, it was a sanctuary of affordability.

The house, built in the late '70s, had good bones but an odd quirk. On every single door, every window frame, and even the cabinet and drawer fronts, there was a faint, greasy cross. It was like someone had taken a consecrated candle and methodically blessed every possible point of entry or exit. ‚ÄúJeez,‚Äù I muttered to my son, Jack, during the move-in. ‚ÄúThe last tenants must have been preparing for the apocalypse.‚Äù Being a firm believer in science and reason, I saw the crosses not as a warning, but as a chore. So, two weeks in, armed with a bucket of hot, soapy water and a sponge, I systematically erased every last one of them. It felt good, like wiping away someone else‚Äôs superstitions and truly claiming the space as our own. That was my first mistake.

The nightmares started for Jack almost immediately. At first, they were vague terrors, the kind you‚Äôd expect from a kid adjusting to a new home. But they quickly coalesced into a single, recurring horror. A ‚Äúdark man,‚Äù he‚Äôd whisper, his eyes wide in the hallway light. ‚ÄúHe just stands in the corner and watches me. He won‚Äôt let me sleep.‚Äù

For two years, I tried everything a rational dad could think of: a new nightlight, therapy, limiting scary movies, even getting a dog, a goofy chihuahua named Iris who seemed utterly unbothered by anything. Nothing worked. The psychologist said it was likely anxiety, a manifestation of the upheaval in his young life and growing up without a mother. I clung to that diagnosis because the alternative was unthinkable. Finally, worn down by his nightly terror and persistent begging, I relented. We swapped rooms. I moved my home office into his old room, which would now double as a guest room, and he took the slightly smaller room down the hall. Just like that, the nightmares stopped. He never mentioned the dark man again.

Life moved on. I fell in love. My wife, Kenzie, moved in, filling the house with warmth and laughter it had never known. The guest room, Jack‚Äôs former chamber of horrors, became a frequent crash pad for her constellation of girlfriends who came to visit. This is when the stories started again, only now they weren‚Äôt coming from a child, but from grown, sober adults.

The first was Meg. She came out for breakfast one morning looking pale. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to believe this,‚Äù she said, pouring coffee with a slightly trembling hand. ‚ÄúI woke up in the middle of the night, and there was a man standing over my bed.‚Äù

I felt a cold prickle on the back of my neck. ‚ÄúA dark man?‚Äù I asked, trying to keep my voice casual.

Meg‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚ÄúHow did you know? He was just a tall, dark shape, but definitely a man. I was terrified for a second, but then I just got‚Ä¶ annoyed? I sat up and said, out loud, ‚ÄòNo, thank you.‚Äô And he just sort of‚Ä¶ faded away.‚Äù

We laughed it off as a vivid dream, but a seed of doubt had been planted in my carefully cultivated soil of skepticism. Over the next year, two other friends reported similar experiences. One felt the distinct pressure of someone sitting on the edge of the bed. Another swore she heard a man‚Äôs deep sigh right next to her ear, even though she was alone in the room. My logical explanations were wearing thin, even to me. The turning point came on a quiet Tuesday night. Kenzie was out with friends, and I was home alone with Iris. I was in the living room watching TV when I heard a distinct, heavy footstep on the wood floor of the guestroom. Iris, who was dozing in my lap, shot up, a low growl rumbling in her chest as she stared down the hall. I muted the TV. Silence. Then, another creak from the wood floor, followed by the soft click of the guest room door shutting. Every rational corner of my mind screamed ""settling house,"" but my gut knew better. I had scrubbed off more than just waxy crosses seven years ago; I had erased a boundary.

Kenzie and I decided we couldn't ignore it any longer. We started with the source: our landlord. When I called and asked about the tenants before me, she chuckled. ‚ÄúOh, you mean Laura,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLived there thirty years. Her husband, Kevin, passed away in the house. In that front bedroom, I believe. She was a deeply religious woman. Said Kevin was a stubborn man in life and just as stubborn in death. He wasn't going anywhere, so she had her priest come bless the room to keep his spirit peaceful and contained.‚Äù

The pieces clicked into place with horrifying clarity. The crosses weren‚Äôt to keep something out; they were to keep someone in. They were spiritual boundary lines for a resident ghost. By cleaning them, I hadn‚Äôt cleansed the house; I had given Kevin the run of the place. He wasn‚Äôt malicious, just‚Ä¶ present. He had tormented my son, a new presence in his space, until Jack left. He had curiously observed our guests. He was the townhome's first tenant, a silent partner in my incredible rental deal.

About 6 months ago, Kenzie and I stood at the threshold of the guest room. It felt different now, not just a room but a space with a history and a personality. Taking a deep breath, I spoke to the empty air.

‚ÄúKevin,‚Äù I said, feeling both foolish and deadly serious. ‚ÄúMy name is M, this is my wife, Kenzie. We understand this was your room, and we respect that. We‚Äôre not asking you to leave. But this is our home now, too. We have guests, and you‚Äôre scaring them. We‚Äôre asking for a little peace. You‚Äôre welcome to your corner, but please, let our guests sleep.‚Äù

It felt strange, like negotiating a treaty with an invisible country. But as we closed the door, the air in the hallway seemed lighter. Since that day, we sometimes see Kevin, usually as a dark apparition moving between the room and hallway, but we don‚Äôt hear any alarming stories from our guests.  

I still have the best rental deal in the city. I‚Äôve come to realize that I don‚Äôt have a ghost problem; I have a roommate. A very, very quiet roommate who lived here first and, in exchange for a little respect and his own private room, helps keep the rent down. I suppose some secrets are worth the price of admission.

I just can‚Äôt find photo on the internet that looks like the badge I have. Hopefully I found a gem. ¬†",19,1760042851.0,modelm,3,1.0,False
1o2hewh,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeerotation/comments/1o2hewh/rotation_state_of_the_union_address/,Rotation: State of the union address,"Hey coffee friends,

Over the past few months we‚Äôve made some great strides sharing new coffees through Rotation everything from small unknown roasters to some of the biggest names in the industry. It‚Äôs been amazing to see how much curiosity and passion there is around trying something new each week.

But I‚Äôll be real with you, keeping the momentum going hasn‚Äôt been easy. When I was self packing, we were exploring 50 to 70 new coffees a month. It was chaotic but fast. When brands started packaging directly, it saved time but slowed things down. Not every roaster is ready or willing to offer 50g packs, and that makes variety harder to sustain.

Then came another hit. Rotation got banned from r/Pourover and r/Espresso, which really hurt growth. Those were two of the biggest platforms for discovery and visibility. Since then it‚Äôs been entirely word of mouth loyal, organic, and real, but much harder to keep consistent.

Now I‚Äôm in that tricky middle ground, too big to hand pack everything myself but not quite big enough to justify large scale fulfillment. It‚Äôs also easy to overbuy and have coffee sitting, which kills freshness, versus keeping small quantities and building purely off hype and community momentum.

So before deciding where to take this next, I want to hear from you.

What do you want Rotation to become?
Would you rather see curated drops of rare and exclusive coffees? A subscription focused on rotating favorites? Or something completely different that matches how you actually drink and explore coffee?

This next step should be shaped by the people who actually care about the craft.

1o2hduh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o2hduh/midnight_walks_on_the_ceiling/,Midnight Walks On The Ceiling,"I got a new book last week for my collection, but I‚Äôve decided to keep it locked down in my vault. It‚Äôs too dangerous to have out in the open

When my new acquaintance (to preserve his privacy, I‚Äôll refer to him as ‚ÄòChester‚Äô) came to meet me in person at a nearby park, he was looking pretty damn rough. The college sophomore was fresh out of a stint in the psychiatric ward, ten pounds thinner than he ought to be, and the plum-dark circles beneath his eyes told me he hadn‚Äôt slept well in days. In his hands he clutched the book, bound tightly in brown paper.¬†

‚ÄúOoh,‚Äù I said, zeroing in on it immediately as he sat down beside me on the bench. I had my dog Midge with me. She‚Äôs a yellow-furred mutt with one blind eye, an eye that can see things I can‚Äôt. I knew Chester‚Äôs book was the real deal when Midge took one look and growled at it.¬†

‚ÄúIs your dog alright?‚Äù Chester asked. He was half-slurring, exhausted.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, yeah, she‚Äôs fine,‚Äù I said. I snatched the book out of his hands, despite Midge‚Äôs whining protests. I quickly unwrapped the book. It was exactly as he‚Äôd described in our chat online. Deep brown leather, gilded pages, and an unusual title:

**YA·Çß·ÇßIM TA –òOOM ‚õ¨ TH”òI–ò·ÇßIM TA –òU∆ß**

I moved to crack the book open, but Chester stopped me.¬†

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do that,‚Äù he said thinly. ‚ÄúJust lock it up somewhere or burn it or something. There‚Äôs nothing in there you want to read.‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing at all? That‚Äôs usually the sort of information I like to verify for myself,‚Äù I told him.¬†

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt even be able to‚Ä¶look, something‚Äôs wrong with it. I‚Äôm giving it to you to *get rid of it*,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI read on the forums that you take care of stuff like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, but first I need to know what stuff I‚Äôm dealing with, precisely.‚Äù I wrapped the book back up for the moment. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you start by telling me where you got it?‚Äù

**CHESTER‚ÄôS ACCOUNT**

I got it at an antique shop.¬†

It‚Äôs called ‚ÄòFort‚Äôs Corner‚Äô, near mainstreet. It‚Äôs not, like, old, or strange, or haunted, or anything like that. It popped up a couple years ago and it‚Äôs run by this young-ish, hippie-type couple. Oh, and their orange tabby cat. It sits in their storefront, it‚Äôs sort of their gimmick.¬†

I guess, I just want to be clear that this is a normal place. I‚Äôm not the idiot in the horror movie, you know? I used to shop there all the time, it was a normal Saturday afternoon. *Normal*.

Though I guess the book wasn‚Äôt.

Maybe, thinking back now, there was something weird about how I spotted it all the way at the back of the store. About how my eyes shot right to it, like it was a beacon. It was in the corner, crammed on a shelf with a bunch of paperback romances and pulp books from the sixties. I remember‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt question how weird that was, until now. I mean, look at it. It‚Äôs leatherbound with gilded pages, wicked fancy, and it was just sitting there with regular books like it belonged there, somehow. Why didn‚Äôt I wonder about that?

I guess, for the same reason I didn‚Äôt really think when I picked it up, or took it to the counter, or gave the check-out lady twenty bucks for it. It was all instinct. Muscle memory. Like I‚Äôd found a part of myself I didn‚Äôt realize was missing, and fused back together with it‚Ä¶

\*

Sorry. I space out a lot lately.

I, um, I took it home. I‚Äôm still living with my parents and my sister, to save money while I work my way through school. I‚Äôm an engineering student. Or trying to be, anyway.

I set the book aside, but it gnawed at the back of my mind the rest of the day. All through dinner, all through catching up on my assignments, all I could think about was the book. I was straight up giddy once I‚Äôd wrapped up what remained of my homework. I must‚Äôve looked like a kid on Christmas when I grabbed it from the bag and sat it on my lap.¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you, fiction? Non fiction?‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt read the title, but I figured that was just a printing error. I ran my hand over the cover. It even *felt* beautiful. I opened it up to the first page, huddled up in the corner of my bed with nothing but my reading light to ward off the dark.

It was unreadable. Every word, hell, every *letter* was completely and totally alien to me, even though it looked like plain English on the surface. I busted out my phone and pulled out google translate, but it was no use. It fit no language. I even tried reading up on ancient hieroglyphics and cuneiform tablets, and still nothing seemed close to what was printed on those pages.¬† I thought maybe it was one massive misprint, like the cover. But there was something too intentional about it. Patterns were there, even if I couldn‚Äôt decipher them.¬†¬†

It was more exciting than frustrating, honestly. Like finding an unfinished puzzle. That was always the sort of thing I loved as a kid. Rubix cubes, rush hour, jigsaws, puzzle books like *Maze*. Something with a secret that was staring back at you just under the surface, waiting for you to find it, to unravel it.¬†

I figured it must be written in some sort of code, so for the next week, codebreaking became my new hobby. I scoured online for any information I could find, checked out books, studied up on dozens of different types of codes. It‚Äôs embarrassing, but I barely touched my studies from university that week, and ended up falling behind for the first time since I was an elementary schooler. I even skipped classes. I couldn‚Äôt help it. None of the problems in my textbook were as fascinating as this one. Every time I tried to take a break and tear myself away from the book, I‚Äôd catch sight of it just out of the corner of my eye, and find myself reaching for it again. I‚Äôd spiral back into it, pages of possible ciphers sprawled on my desk, searching for a match.

No. None of them matched, technically. Didn‚Äôt matter what I tried. Every time I thought I‚Äôd just about cracked it, it would elude me. It was like fishing with my bare hands, the answer always wriggling away at the last second. Codes upon codes, ciphers and ciphers, nothing and more nothing for seven days.

And then, on night 8, hunched over my desk, I caught something.

I don‚Äôt know how to describe it to you, exactly. No, like I said, it wasn‚Äôt one of the ciphers, exactly. It was like‚Ä¶I saw through the pattern. Everything clicked together, just for a second, just at one sentence. A sentence I could finally read.

Yes, I remember what it said. I can‚Äôt forget what it said. It said:

**WHEN THE RABBIT HUNTS THE WOLF AND THE RAIN FALLS FROM THE LAKE, ALL THE WORLD WILL FEAST AND EVERY DREAM WILL WAKE.**

I didn't know what it meant, but it didn‚Äôt matter to me. All I cared about was that I‚Äôd finally gotten something. I‚Äôd *finally* read something.¬†

I should have felt satisfied, I guess. It only made me more obsessed.¬†

\*

‚ÄúDid you really have to bring that thing to the table?‚Äù

I barely heard my sister‚Äôs voice, despite sitting across from her. It had been a week since my initial break-through, and I had been summoned from my seclusion for a family dinner. Of course I brought the book to the table. I brought the book everywhere.

I glanced up from the book at Allie. ‚ÄúI need to study.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat freak book you‚Äôve been touting around is definitely not for a class.‚Äù Alice eyed the book with open disgust, which pissed me off far more than it should have. I felt protective of it.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for a special project,‚Äù I snapped. She snapped some insult back at me, though I barely listened. I just stared down into the book as she kept going on and on about how I‚Äôd been acting different, how I was freaking everyone out, something like that. At the time it was hard to care about what she was saying, because two more sentences revealed themselves.

**DEATH IS A MIRROR**

**THE GIRL CRAWLED THROUGH THE DOOR THAT WAS NOT A DOOR, AND SAW THERE ALL THE HIDDEN THINGS**

They were on two different pages, disconnected. I couldn‚Äôt even tell you what was happening around me at the table. I was so blind with elation that I stood up without another word to my family and locked myself up in the room. I distantly remember them knocking on the door. I ignored them. I ignored everything, and for the next six hours I read and read. Most of the book was still impenetrable to me, but I was picking up more scraps as I went through. They are all still crystal clear in my mind, like they‚Äôre burned there.

**FRUIT LIKE JEWELS GREW FROM THE SKY, AND BLED WHEN THEY WERE PLUCKED**

**HONEY IN THE MOUTH, WORDS OF MILK**

**THE GIRL WALKED UNTIL HER FEET CURLED INTO HOOVES AND BACK AGAIN, UNTIL SHE WAS CERTAIN THIS WORLD HAD NO END AND NO BEGINNING**

The girl? Yeah, she pops up in the book all the time. She‚Äôs the closest thing there is to a character in the story, if you can call it a story. No, she‚Äôs never named. I would have remembered her name.

Anyway, I finally started getting tired. I forced myself to shut the book and laid it on my nightstand. I turned out the light, went to sleep.

And then I dreamed.

I dreamed the things I‚Äôd read in the book. I was walking in this dark, shiny place. Almost like a field, but spotted with things that looked like trees. There was this bright red, swollen fruit hanging in the sky just out of reach, throbbing. It was raining from the ground up, fat droplets seeping out of the soil and flying into the air. I saw a wolf howling and running like its life depended on it. A small hare was hopping at its heels. Ahead of me, I saw a figure through the rain, small and blurry.

And behind me, even though I couldn‚Äôt see it, I knew there was a door.¬†

All this could be explained by my overtired and hyperactive subconscious, I guess. I mean, it‚Äôs not rocket science. Read a ton of a thing, it starts showing up in your dreams. What I can‚Äôt explain was where I was when I woke up in the middle of the night.¬†

I was standing on the ceiling.

Just‚Ä¶standing there. Like I opened my eyes, and there I was, upside down in the living room, the coffee table just above my head.¬† It wasn‚Äôt like my feet were glued there, or anything. It was more like my own personal gravity had been reversed. I could walk back and forth no problem. I thought I was still dreaming, to be honest. It wasn‚Äôt until I looked down at my hands that I realized it was all real.¬†

At that point, I swear my heart straight up froze in my chest. My mind just went totally blank, like it couldn‚Äôt compute what it was seeing. I didn‚Äôt scream, even though I wanted to. I just stood there for a second, feeling like I was going to die from the sheer weirdness of it. Then some kind of instinct told me I should try and get down. I walked nearer to the couch and started jumping, over and over until things reversed again and I fell on the couch. I didn‚Äôt float back up to the ceiling, to my relief. To this day, I have no memory of how I possibly could have gotten up there, not the foggiest clue. After some time curled up on the couch, I convinced myself that I must have hallucinated. That it was some kind of waking dream, a byproduct of sleepwalking. Once I‚Äôd convinced myself, I went back to bed, mentally filing the whole thing away as a weird, one-off incident.

It was just the start.

\*

I started sleepwalking more.

It was a gradual thing. I went a week without any other incidents after the ceiling one, and that was already fading from my mind. The only thing on my mind was the book, really. I picked it up again, went back to trying to decode it. I started picking up more fragments.

**THE GIRL FOUND A LIVING CAVE, AND SQUEEZED HER WAY THROUGH THE DAMP, BREATHING CREVICES UNTIL SHE FOUND BLACK WATER, AND DRANK.**

**THE HUNT CIRCLED THE FIELD AND INTO THE FOREST, WHERE OTHER DOORS WERE.**

It happened again, just like before. One moment I was deep in the dream, not too different from the last one. I was standing in a cave, but it felt more like I was in the belly of some giant being, surrounded by pink and red walls. I started walking until I was in this tight, cramped passage, and then I had to get on my hands and knees and claw my way through. Just when it got so tight that I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I blinked, and I was home again.

In my pajamas. Crammed under the kitchen sink. I‚Äôm a fairly tall dude, so I thought I was going to have to, like,break my legs to get out, but I was just barely able to contort myself out of the space. As far as places go, that was probably the least weird. Three nights after that I woke up walking on my bedroom wall, sideways. Two nights later, I was tangled at the top of a tree in the backyard. The day after that, well, I gave my poor sister a fucking heart attack. She woke up to sounds outside her bedroom window. When she opened it up and looked outside, there I was, tip-toeing along the ledge of the roof, one wrong step away from falling and breaking my neck. She told me later that she freaked out and screamed my name, but that it didn‚Äôt even phase me. She said my eyes were wide open.¬†

She and my mom followed my path below with a mattress in case I fell, while my dad got on the roof to try and yank me back. I know all this second hand, obviously. All I remember is walking along the ridge of a lightning bolt in a black cloud, then waking up duct-taped to my bed.¬†

My family watched me like hawks after that, but it didn‚Äôt do much good. They took me to a dozen specialists, none of whom could find anything wrong with me, besides vague guesses like ‚Äústress‚Äù. They gave me pills that did about as much as tic-tacs might have.¬†

Was I still reading it? Yes. Of course I was. Okay, just‚Äîspare me the look. It was out of my control. Like I said, the book was all I could think of. It was everything. And it was revealing more of itself to me every day. It got to the point that I could read entire pages, unbroken. How was I supposed to just give up when I was finally making progress?

The first time I made it through an entire chapter, maybe a week and a half after the roof incident, I sleepwalked out of my own neighborhood.¬†

I was in the field again beneath a red sky, watching the rain fall upside down, and the rabbit chase the wolf. The hunt was getting more intense. The wolf was inside out now, and missing chunks out of its body. Its pink flesh was mottled with fur and ripped up in several places, trailing blood with every loping step. Sometimes it would cast its eye towards me like it was begging for help, but something in me didn‚Äôt want to help it. I don‚Äôt know why but I was‚Ä¶*pleased*. Satisfied. Like I was watching the gears of nature turn just the way they were meant to, like something out of sorts in the cosmic order had finally been corrected.¬†

I felt the door behind me again. It was farther away than usual, but I could still feel it, a vacuum of energy like a black hole. Ahead of me was the figure with its back to me, less blurry now, and closer. The girl. She didn‚Äôt turn to face me, but I knew she could see me. She raised her hand to beckon me closer, then started walking. I followed.

I know things are different in dreams, but this felt more real than anything ever has in my entire life. I spent years following her, walking and walking, growing old and bent, my feet curving into hooves and back again. She led me in silence through forests of dead and twisted trees, and rotted cities where eyes watched me from the black abysses of the windows, and through the corpses of giants, through the hillsides where beasts cannibalized their young, through rivers of bile, and through places that were nothing but emptiness, cold and soundless voids. I started to think that I would never stop walking, then that I had always *been* walking, and that my whole life on Earth had been nothing but a dream between footsteps.

Finally, she came to a stop.

A black lake stretched in front of us, as far as the eye could see. It looked more like an ocean, now that I think about it, but I knew instinctively that it was a lake. I had this weird sensation that I‚Äôd been there before. That I‚Äôd been there *first*, before I‚Äôd ever been anywhere else. When I dragged myself to the edge of the shore and looked into the water, it was so dark that I couldn‚Äôt see anything underneath. It was like I was looking into space stripped of the stars. I heard the girl speak behind me.

She told me to wade deeper, so I did.

She told me to cup my hands and scoop up the water, so I did.

She told me to drink.

I almost did. I held the water in my palm, thin and inky, ready to spill it down into my mouth. But some, I don‚Äôt know, instinct inside me stopped my arm. Like a little voice in my head that I hadn‚Äôt heard in eons, screaming at me not to drink, to get out of the lake.¬†

The girl told me to drink again, and when I still didn‚Äôt, she started getting angry. She started screaming at me, begging me, slapping her hands against the water, but I still wouldn‚Äôt. I dropped the water from my hand and she came up and shoved me in, but I wasn‚Äôt afraid, because I knew without knowing that there was a door beneath me. And I fell right through it.

I opened my eyes. I was awake now, I could tell. But I was still underwater, and all I could see was the pinprick light of the moon above me. My lungs started tightening up. I felt fish darting between my fingers and silt under my feet, and that made me realize where I was. I swam like a crazy person, flailing and forcing myself up through the water before I ran out of the sour air that was sitting in my chest. As if it had been held there in suspension. When I finally broke through the surface, I was shivering so hard that I had to claw my way over the shore. I was at the local park. I had been standing at the bottom of the pond, for God knows how long.¬†

I walked two miles back to my house, soaked and cold to the bone. I thought my feet were going to fall right off by the time I finally stumbled into my house, and my parents were so freaked that they rushed me to the ER. Things got more serious after that.

They started chaining me to the bed, if you can believe it. They tried everything, actually. They cuffed my wrists to the bedframe, tied my ankles to cinderblocks, barricaded my doors and windows, even installed a security system throughout the house so that an alarm would blare if I sleepwalked out. None of it worked. Somehow, the restraints always came undone, the barricade always collapsed, the alarm always failed to trip. And I would dream of that strange, addicting world, and wake up halfway across town.¬†

Oh, of course they tried to take the book from me. I hid it. I hid it in a space between the walls that hadn‚Äôt been there before I got the book. It was like the house had contorted itself to help me, to safeguard the one thing that gave me purpose. I know how that sounds, but by then I was at the point where I could almost read the whole book, and the things it said mesmerized me. The girl had become a queen in that world, or maybe a god. The beasts obeyed her. The trees yielded their flesh and fed her off their vines. She could dig valleys with her bare hands, or bring the dead cities back to life. Something like life, I mean. The point is, the more time she spent in the world and became part of it, the more command she had over it. I was proud of her.

No, actually. I was envious of her.

\*\*\*

¬†In light of everything else failing, my family took to keeping watch over me, sleeping in shifts. They still tied me to the bed on top of that, but they said the bonds always came undone one way or another, no matter how secure they made them. My mom says it was easy to tell when I was about to sleepwalk. My eyes would snap open, but there‚Äôd be nothing behind them. Like they were glass. My family was calling doctors and specialists around the country, scheduling consultations and looking into new medications for me to take. I felt sort of distant from it all, to be honest. The time I was awake was what felt like a dream. Everything in this world felt 2D, a cardboard stage set, like a cheap movie playing out around me until it was time to return to reality.¬†

The only thing that kept me anchored was the book. I had almost read the entire thing. The wolf was nearly dead, the rabbit nearly fed. The girl was still searching for something.

A surreal, sleepless week passed as I was constantly being woken up by my family members throughout the night, yanked out of that other world just as I was getting my bearings. It was disorienting, like being flipped upside down and then right-side up again, over and over, until I couldn‚Äôt tell which was which. I actually started to resent my family, as crazy as that sounds. The rational part of my brain was checked out, and what was left saw them as jailers.¬†

Finally, the guard faltered. It was one, maybe two AM. The moon outside my window was so supernaturally bright, it looked blinding. It made the entire room stark white, sharp and skeletal. My sister had nodded off in my computer chair. For the first time in what felt like forever, I wasn‚Äôt being watched.¬†

I sat up in bed for a minute, just kind of blank. I hadn‚Äôt woken up from any dream. It felt almost nostalgic to have just casually woken up in my room, in my bed. No sleepwalking, no visions. Just my room. Just as I started to lay back down, I felt it.

A door. Somewhere, out of sight, but definitely there. The same door that I always felt behind me in my dreams, that powerful absence. Except it wasn‚Äôt behind me now, but somewhere farther down. Somewhere in the house.

I silently crept out of bed, careful not to wake Ally. I started following the feeling, looking for the door. Something in the back of my head knew this was a fucking stupid idea, but the rest of me couldn‚Äôt help myself. I mean, it was in my *house* now. I had to find it.

The feeling led me down the hall, and‚Äîoh, um. I mean, it‚Äôs hard to describe. It‚Äôs like nothingness, or a vacuum, or a place where all the air‚Äôs gone out. But it‚Äôs heavy. Suffocating, even. Yeah, suffocating. That was the feeling. And it drew me in, pulled me along, until I stepped into the hall bathroom. I knew as soon as I did that this was the closest I‚Äôd ever been to the door. It was immediate, like the gravity of it was just shy of crushing me. My vision blurred for a second from the headache it gave me. Once it snapped into focus, I found myself standing in front of the mirror.

And there she was.

The girl was staring back at me from the other side of the mirror. Finally, *finally,* I could see her face, and it was beautiful, and it was horrific, a little girl‚Äôs face that had never been allowed to grow up but instead got pulled through eons and eons, warped into something just on the other side of human. And the field and the rain was behind her, and the rabbit was ripping into the body of the wolf, tearing off massive, bloody bites.¬†

The girl stared into my eyes and pressed her hand against the glass. I pressed mine against hers. The glass between us felt so thin. I could almost feel the cold coming off her skin. Her mouth moved as she said something to me, but it was muffled.¬†

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt hear you,‚Äù I whispered. Her mouth shut. With her other hand, she motioned for me to come closer. I leaned in close until my head was pressed up right against the mirror. She kept her hand against the glass, over mine. She moved closer and spoke in a low gurgle.

**‚ÄúTHIS DOOR IS NOT A DOOR.‚Äù**

Then her hand shot through the glass and closed over mine.

Her nails were like claws, sinking into my skin as she tried to pull me through. The mirror splintered where my wrist entered, cutting the skin and dripping blood all over the bathroom counter. Some animal part of me finally woke up and I started screaming and trying to pull myself out of her grip, but it was *iron.* We were locked in this fucked-up tug of war as she kept trying to force me through the mirror. God, I‚Äôve never screamed so loud. My heart was beating so fast I thought it was going to fucking seize, and every time she managed to pull me deeper it was like my skin was being torn off the muscle. At some point she got me as far as my shoulder, but I kept screaming and fighting and trying to pull myself out, until I heard the bathroom door slam open behind me.

‚ÄúOh my god, *WHO IS THAT?*‚Äù Allie screamed and grabbed the back of my shirt, trying to pull me away as the girl in the mirror started screaming and roaring too. ‚Äú*WHAT IS THAT?*‚Äù

I had to brace my leg against the sink to get some leverage, and the girl sunk her nails so deep into my arm I thought I could feel them scraping my bones. Allie had her arms around my waist and was pulling and sobbing, just screaming over and over ‚Äúwhat is that, what is that.‚Äù It was obviously enough to wake up my parents, and they came rushing in. My mom passed out as soon as she saw it. Just heaved and hit the floor. My dad went into fight mode, not even screaming or pausing, just lunged forward and grabbed me, pulling me by the torso. Finally I started slipping backwards, the three of us working together able to yank my arm back out of the mirror inch by inch, spraying blood everywhere. I didn‚Äôt even feel the cuts at that point. It was nothing but adrenaline pumping through me. Nothing but the fight, the need to survive.

My dad and sister got me out with one final pull. We all went falling down to floor. The girl screamed again and started banging her hands against the glass, over and over until my dad couldn‚Äôt take it any more. He ran out to the garage and came back with a hammer. He slammed it into the mirror over and over until the girl‚Äôs screaming cut out and the field was gone, the shards of our mirror dropping off and peppering the countertop. The air changed as soon as he‚Äôd finished. The heaviness lifted away.

The door was gone.

**END OF CHESTER‚ÄôS ACCOUNT**

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt have it around me anymore,‚Äù Chester said after he‚Äôd told me the whole story. He stared down at the book with something straddling the edge of hatred and longing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt be able to stop myself from picking it back up again, and then she‚Äôll have me for good. The mirror thing snapped me out of it for a little while, but I don‚Äôt know how long it will stay that way.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never have to see it again,‚Äù I promised him.¬† ‚ÄúYou ever miss that other world, out of curiosity?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather not answer,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWell, do you still have those dreams about it?‚Äù

Chester got up to leave, then paused. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt dream at all anymore.‚Äù

\*

So that was that. As per usual, any names in the above account have been changed for privacy reasons. Also as per usual, I‚Äôm doing my due diligence on the research front, but it‚Äôs slow going. I haven‚Äôt been able to figure out when and where the book was printed yet, and I don‚Äôt have the necessary precautions in place to risk reading it for myself. Unlike Chester, I‚Äôve got no family to yank me out the mirror if things go wrong, and Midge lacks the requisite opposable thumbs. Chester provided a few, very sparse details on the girl. She wore a ripped up dress that ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù was Victorian-era. If I‚Äôm looking for Victorian-era girls in the area who disappeared under mysterious circumstances, well, it will be a long search. I‚Äôll do my best, though.

That only left one lead to follow up on, which was the place Chester bought it from, Fort‚Äôs Corner. I went, and he wasn‚Äôt lying. It‚Äôs aggressively, disappointingly normal (though they get bonus points from me for the cat that hangs out in the window).¬† I perused the shelves, didn‚Äôt find anything notable. I had Midge with me, and though she seemed on edge, she didn‚Äôt bark at anything in the store. Before I left, I took the book to the front desk to chat with the owner of the establishment, a blond woman in her late twenties decked out in crystal jewelry.¬†

‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶‚Äù she said, pursing her lips as she casually flipped through the books. ‚ÄúGosh, I‚Äôm sorry. I don‚Äôt even remember this coming in. I wish I could tell you more. Was there something wrong with it, are you looking to return it?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, not at all,‚Äù I said, snatching the book back. ‚ÄúI was just looking for more information about it. Thanks for your help.‚Äù

‚ÄúAny time. Come again soon!‚Äù She smiled and waved at me, and I started for the door.¬†

Just as we were about to leave, Midge ground to a halt. She looked up at the cat, took a stumbling step backward, and growled.¬†

‚ÄúMidge, cut that out!‚Äù I tried to pull her out, but she growled the entire time, whining and staring down that cat, which stayed still as a statue on the windowsill. It didn‚Äôt even look at her. Instead it looked at me. Then, it looked at the book.

For the split second the cat‚Äôs eyes met mine, there was something almost human in its gaze, calculating even. Like it knew exactly who I was, and what I had in my hands.¬†

Anyway, I couldn‚Äôt let Midge tear up the store while she was working herself up into a frenzy, so I had to drag her out, and off ran the cat behind the register.

I‚Äôm still not sure the shop had anything to do with the strangeness of the book, though Midge doesn‚Äôt growl for nothing. But at the end of the day, I‚Äôve got no proof of anything nefarious, and no damn answers. I just have to file this whole thing under the cursed ‚Äòcurrently unsolved‚Äô category.

At least until I can figure out a way to read the book myself.",2,1760042758.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Maintaining excellent oral health is more than just a quick brush and occasional flossing. Your daily oral hygiene routine plays a crucial role in preventing dental problems, protecting your overall health, and ensuring a bright, confident smile. Many people underestimate the importance of a comprehensive oral care approach, but the truth is that consistent, thorough dental care can prevent serious health issues, reduce dental expenses, and boost your self-confidence. Whether you're looking to improve your current routine or establish a new oral hygiene regimen, this guide will provide you with expert insights and practical steps to achieve optimal oral health.

Understanding the Foundations of Oral Hygiene

Oral hygiene is a comprehensive approach to maintaining the health of your teeth, gums, and overall mouth. **A truly effective oral care routine** goes beyond simple brushing and involves multiple steps and consistent practices. Let's break down the essential components of an ideal daily oral hygiene routine.

The Importance of Proper Brushing Techniques

Brushing your teeth is the cornerstone of any oral hygiene routine. However, it's not just about brushing ‚Äì it's about brushing correctly. Here are some key considerations:

‚Ä¢ Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
‚Ä¢ Replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months
‚Ä¢ Brush for at least two minutes, twice daily
‚Ä¢ Use gentle, circular motions
‚Ä¢ Hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to your gums

Choosing the Right Toothpaste and Toothbrush

Not all toothpastes are created equal. Look for toothpastes that contain:

1. Fluoride
2. Antibacterial properties
3. Tartar control ingredients
4. Whitening compounds (if desired)

Selecting the right toothbrush is equally important. Electric toothbrushes can be more effective at removing plaque and reducing gingivitis compared to manual toothbrushes.

Flossing: The Often Overlooked Hero of Oral Hygiene

Flossing removes plaque and food particles from areas your toothbrush can't reach. **Daily flossing is critical** for preventing:

‚Ä¢ Tooth decay
‚Ä¢ Gum disease
‚Ä¢ Bad breath
‚Ä¢ Potential systemic health issues

Mouthwash: An Essential Complement to Brushing and Flossing

A good antiseptic mouthwash can:

‚Ä¢ Reduce bacterial growth
‚Ä¢ Freshen breath
‚Ä¢ Provide additional fluoride protection
‚Ä¢ Help prevent plaque buildup

Recommended Daily Oral Hygiene Sequence

1. Floss first to loosen debris
2. Brush thoroughly for two minutes
3. Rinse with antiseptic mouthwash
4. Use tongue scraper (optional but recommended)

Nutrition and Oral Health

Your diet significantly impacts your oral health. Foods and drinks to limit include:

‚Ä¢ Sugary snacks
‚Ä¢ Acidic beverages
‚Ä¢ Sticky candies
‚Ä¢ Excessive coffee and tea

Instead, focus on:

‚Ä¢ Water
‚Ä¢ Calcium-rich foods
‚Ä¢ Crunchy fruits and vegetables
‚Ä¢ Lean proteins

Click here to get your teeth and gums restored naturally prodentimofficalsite.carrd.co

Additional Oral Hygiene Tips

‚Ä¢ Stay hydrated
‚Ä¢ Avoid tobacco products
‚Ä¢ Use a tongue scraper
‚Ä¢ Replace your toothbrush after illness
‚Ä¢ Schedule regular dental check-ups

Professional Dental Care

Even with an excellent home routine, professional dental cleanings are crucial. Dentists recommend:

‚Ä¢ Bi-annual check-ups
‚Ä¢ Annual x-rays
‚Ä¢ Professional cleaning every 6 months

Common Oral Hygiene Mistakes to Avoid

‚Ä¢ Brushing too hard
‚Ä¢ Neglecting your tongue
‚Ä¢ Using a worn-out toothbrush
‚Ä¢ Skipping flossing
‚Ä¢ Rushing through your routine

Conclusion

Developing and maintaining an optimal daily oral hygiene routine requires commitment, knowledge, and consistency. By implementing these comprehensive strategies, you can significantly improve your oral health, prevent potential dental issues, and ensure a lifetime of healthy, beautiful sm",1,1760042370.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

1o2h354,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1o2h354/my_pet_project_is_finally_live_i_bought_the/,"My pet project is finally live! I bought the domain today. Meet MeshVox, a free and private voice chat app.","Hey everyone,

Today is a huge day for me! After pouring months of late nights and way too much coffee into my passion project, I finally bought the domain, pushed the files to a server, and I'm super nervous but excited to share it with you all for the first time.

It's called **MeshVox**.

**What is it?** MeshVox is a free, private, serverless voice chat application that runs entirely in your browser. No installs, no sign-ups, no subscriptions. You just go to the site and start talking.

**How does it work?** It's built on WebRTC and PeerJS, which means it connects you and your friends' browsers directly to each other in a peer-to-peer ""mesh."" Once you're connected, my server gets out of the way completely. Your voice chat is not routed through any central server, meaning nobody (not even me) can listen in. It's truly private. This is also why if you refresh the page, the connection drops. That's because there's no server holding your hand!

**How to get started:** It‚Äôs super simple.

* Go to [MeshVox.net.](https://meshvox.net)
* You can instantly create a **Private Room**. This generates a random, one-time-use URL that you can share with your friends. When the last person leaves, the room is gone for good.
* Or, you can check out the **Public Rooms**. These are persistent channels for anyone to hop into and chat.

**Why did I build this?** The idea came from a personal frustration. I wanted a simple way to chat with friends at places where other apps were blocked or required a phone. I also believe that private conversations should be just that, private. If you're curious about the whole story, the technical challenges, and why it's named MeshVox, I wrote it all down. You can find it by clicking the **""What is MeshVox?""** button on the homepage.

**I'd love for you to try it out!** This is the very first time it's seeing the light of day, and I'd love to hear your feedback.

* Once you're in a chat room, you'll see a **""Got a suggestion?""** link in the top right. Please, tell me what you think, what you like, what you hate, or any feature ideas you have!
* Since this is a public space, I've also included a simple **reporting feature** (the little flag icon next to a user's name) in case you run into anyone causing trouble.

Thanks so much for taking the time to check it out. I'm excited (and terrified) to hear what you think! I'll be hanging out in the comments to answer any questions.

I really want to say thanks to so many people that helped me along the way in making MeshVox a reality.  
Mostly my friends that just put up with my constant nagging for ""Hey! Help me test this again, I rewritten the code!"" and a giant thank you to caffeine that kept me awake while trying to figure out where there is an error saying ""Haa... You got a missing semicolon, good luck finding it!""  
Anyway, I really hope you enjoy and provide feedback, either bad or good is alright for me!!!

1o2h0xy,https://tipstor.net/every-smart-traveler-packs-this-one-simple-bottle/,Every Smart Traveler Packs This One Simple Bottle,"Thirst hits differently when wandering foreign streets under a sun that feels personal. Somewhere between the airport, the tuk-tuk, and the third cup of coffee, dehydration sneaks in like a thief. The body begs for water, and the universe answers with plastic bottles priced like fine wine or a suspicious tap that whispers promises of regret. The best travel hack in this gritty ballet of survival is simple, unassuming, and wildly effective. The collapsible travel water bottle.

It‚Äôs the kind of tool every traveler eventually learns to worship. Lightweight, flexible, and engineered to fold into itself like origami, it saves space while outsmarting the overpriced bottles of airport purgatory. Fill it up before boarding and sidestep the USD 6 trap disguised as ‚Äúspring water.‚Äù Once empty, it collapses flat and disappears into a bag, waiting for the next refill like a loyal companion. The good ones run between USD 15 and USD 25 on Amazon, built from BPA-free silicone tough enough to survive drops, desert heat, or the bottom of a rucksack soaked in spilled beer.

It‚Äôs not about staying hydrated in some Instagram-influencer way. It‚Äôs about function, grit, and the quiet joy of sticking it to overpriced airport kiosks. A collapsible bottle turns travel into an act of defiance. Hydration without dependency, control without clutter. Pair it with a compact water purifier or UV filter (around USD 40) and it becomes an all-access pass to hydration anywhere, from the backstreets of Marrakech to the hiking trails of Patagonia.

Every journey has its survival rules. This one earns its place at the top because it solves the simplest problem travelers face. Thirst without adding weight, waste, or worry. While others line up for overpriced bottles or gamble with hotel tap water, the smart traveler unfolds salvation from a pocket. The best travel hack isn‚Äôt always about beating the system. Sometimes it‚Äôs just about staying human long enough to enjoy the view, one refill at a time.

Hey everyone,

So I went out with this girl recently and the first date honestly went way better than I expected. We grabbed coffee, talked for a while, and then ended up walking around the city even though it was raining. At one point she leaned in and kissed me, and after that we held hands and just kept walking and talking. When I dropped her off at her bus stop, we kissed again and she said she‚Äôd really enjoyed it and wanted to do it again sometime.

Later that night, she texted me something along the lines of ‚ÄúWe should definitely hang out again soon :)‚Äù

The next day I suggested we meet later in the week, and she seemed really into the plan. But a few hours before we were supposed to meet, she messaged saying she couldn‚Äôt make it because her university organized some trip and she‚Äôd be back late. She then suggested another day, saying she‚Äôd be free after her morning classes.

But when that day came, she texted again saying she wasn‚Äôt feeling well apparently caught the flu and wanted to rest for a few days.

I just replied with ‚ÄúNo worries, get some rest and take care. Hope you feel better soon.‚Äù

Now I‚Äôm kind of stuck overthinking it. I was really excited to see her again because the first date felt so natural and she genuinely seemed interested. But now I can‚Äôt tell if she‚Äôs actually just had bad timing or if she‚Äôs politely backing away.

What do you guys think? Should I wait for her to reach out again, or just assume she‚Äôs lost interest and move on?

TLDR:
Had a really good first date (mutual kiss, she seemed into it), but she‚Äôs canceled two follow-up plans, one for a last-minute uni thing and another because she‚Äôs sick. Can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs bad luck or she‚Äôs slowly ghosting me.",1,1760041851.0,dating_advice,6,0.67,False

I‚Äôd go to bed at a decent time, toss around for hours, and wake up groggy like my brain had been idling all night instead of resting.

At first, I blamed stress, my mattress, even blue light. But after checking my Oura Ring data for months, one thing stood out. My deep sleep was ridiculously low, often under an hour.

Despite this, I didn‚Äôt quit coffee. I just stopped abusing it.  
My rule now: no caffeine after 10 a.m. (or 8 hours before bedtime).  
Caffeine‚Äôs half-life is 5‚Äì7 hours, which means your 3 p.m. espresso still affects you at 10 p.m.  
When I set a ‚Äúcaffeine curfew,‚Äù my deep sleep jumped from 45 minutes to over 90 minutes (tracked with Oura).

Bonus: morning energy now feels *earned* rather than borrowed.

It all started in seeing, especially Bryce‚Äôs videos of him preaching to people on the streets, which is amazing to see and helpful for people online to see that kind of real transformation. but i always think of the verses matthew 6:3-5 where it talks about not letting your right hand know what your left hand is doing. and that kind of video always struck me as the the hypocrites standing in the street and praying all these loud and complicated prayers to be seen by others. it gives me the same kind of attitude as giving to the homeless but you‚Äôre recording this sick person on the street as you give them food and water, it doesn‚Äôt seem genuine. and there‚Äôs no way for me to know where they are with God and what‚Äôs in their heart. but it always gave me an uneasy feeling that i always said was probably just me feeling inadequate because i was so far from God AND far from doing good for His kingdom. The other side of this is all these creators with their podcasts, the covers being professional photos of themselves and the podcast seems to be more about who‚Äôs talking rather than what they are talking about. Their words are centred around Christ but the idea of the podcast isn‚Äôt. Why is Ally Yost face the cover of a ‚ÄòChrist with Coffee On Ice‚Äô or Maddy Dodd the face of her profile? yes, they are beautiful and yes, it‚Äôs obviously okay to feel that way and post about it, but it sometimes seems vain to watch a video of someone quoting proverbs 31:30 while being decked out in makeup, expensive clothes, and jewelry while verses like 1 tim 2:9 exist. in no way am i judging them, i love these creators and i admire them, and i‚Äôm guilty of all of this too. but this also makes a weird feeling inside me. same with Carew and Ally in their wonderful homes, having all these expensive products and living a seemingly very rich and elaborate life, sometimes having content that seems too much like a content creator, spewing this unrealistic and lavish life, rather than humble content directed about Jesus. besides all of this my rebuttal is, i have jealousy in my heart because they are blessed, i‚Äôm focusing too much on a influencer then Jesus and shouldn‚Äôt compare myself, and they‚Äôre not perfect, their human too and doing much more than i am anyways. but this isn‚Äôt about my life, it‚Äôs more about my suspicion that their content isn‚Äôt really as biblical as they think. am i wrong? half wrong? or is this something to think about? thank you for reading!

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don‚Äôt mind where you are located don‚Äôt let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health.

I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you

The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music.

I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all.

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one!


Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don‚Äôt mind where you are located don‚Äôt let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here

I started this company because I wanted mushroom coffee that was actually made in Canada. Sounds simple, right?

Turns out almost nobody makes it here. Four Sigmatic, Ryze, all the big brands - manufactured in the US. Which I get, it's probably easier and cheaper.

But I kept thinking: why are we importing coffee that could be made an hour from where I live?

So we set up manufacturing in Ontario. Sourced what we could domestically. Built the whole supply chain here.

Now every bag ships from Canada, supports Canadian jobs, and I don't have to explain to customers why their order got stuck at the border for two weeks.

The honest truth? It would've been way easier to outsource everything. But there's something that just feels right about building it here.

I wrote up a comparison of Canadian vs US mushroom coffee brands (linked above) and realized we're one of the only ones actually made domestically. That's kind of wild.

Some days I barely keep up with the basics, and then I feel guilty for not having any ‚Äúme‚Äù time or fun outside of mom mode.

I want to make female friends online because in-person hangouts aren‚Äôt realistic for me right now. I don‚Äôt have the energy for coffee dates or girls‚Äô nights, but I do have energy to text, voice note, or chat about life when I‚Äôm stuck at home. I‚Äôd love to find women who get what it‚Äôs like to be sick, tired, and stretched thin ‚Äî but who still want to laugh and connect when they can.

For context, I‚Äôm into Nintendo Switch (especially cozy games), true crime, documentaries, and animals. Basically I just want a couple genuine friendships where I can talk about things outside of kids and appointments, and not feel like a burden when I go quiet on bad days.

If you‚Äôve managed to make lasting online female friendships while juggling illness and kids, how did you do it? What worked for you?
