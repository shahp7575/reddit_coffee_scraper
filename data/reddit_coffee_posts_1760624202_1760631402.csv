Hi all,

I’m here from the world of super auto, having gone from a LatteGo to a new Sage (Breville) Dual Boiler and Eureka Specialita. 

I’ve had a very frustrating afternoon trying to get dialled in. Over 500g of coffee later and I have a drinkable shot, but I have a few questions:

1. Does the razor tool actually measure the puck depth correctly? I read that 18g is the right dose for the dual boiler, but with my beans that takes it quite a bit below the razor tool. 
2. Should I be aiming for 2:1 shot volume to weight within 30 seconds (including 10 second pre infusion)?
3. I’ve noticed I’ve had to set my specialita down to a really low grind size, under 1! Is this normal?

Sorry if these are stupid questions. I love coffee and was sick of wasting beans on a super auto!

Thanks in advance. ",1,1760631167.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1o8admq,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTravelers/comments/1o8admq/how_to_take_a_day_trip_to_the_cotswolds_from/,How to take a day trip to the Cotswolds from London?,"Just got back from the most incredible day trip to the Cotswolds, and I need to share this gem with fellow travelers. If you're in London and looking for an escape to the English countryside, I found the perfect tour that made everything super easy.

I've always wanted to visit those picturesque villages you see on postcards, but planning the logistics seemed overwhelming. That's when I discovered this small-group tour that handles everything - transportation, itinerary, and local insights.

The tour starts in South Kensington, London, at a cozy coffee shop called Urban Baristas. We met at 8:15 AM, and honestly, the early start was worth it. Our guide (I had Christian, but I hear Ash and Tony are excellent too) really knew their stuff and kept things interesting without information overload.

First stop was Burford, known as the gateway to the Cotswolds. The high street is lined with buildings that are older than the United States - some dating back 600 years! I spent an hour exploring local shops and taking photos of the honey-colored stone buildings that make the Cotswolds famous.

Then we visited Bibury, which William Morris called ""the most beautiful village in England"" - and he wasn't exaggerating. Arlington Row, with its ancient weavers' cottages, looks straight out of a fairy tale. The 40-minute stop gave me plenty of time for photos and a peaceful walk along the river.

Lunch break was in Bourton-on-the-Water, often called the ""Venice of the Cotswolds."" The village has these lovely bridges crossing the River Windrush, and there are plenty of cafes and shops to explore. We had about 90 minutes here, which felt just right.

The final stop, Stow-on-the-Wold, was actually my favorite. Did you know it inspired elements of Lord of the Rings? The ancient door at St. Edward's Church between two yew trees supposedly inspired Tolkien's Doors of Durin. The antique shops here are amazing too.

What made this tour special was the small group size - maximum 16 people. It felt personal, and we could ask questions and get recommendations from our guide. The air-conditioned vehicle was comfortable, and not having to worry about driving on the left side of the road was a huge plus.

If you're thinking about booking, I used this link: https://athomewave.com/Cotswolds. The price is $122.19 per person, which includes transportation and a knowledgeable guide. You can cancel up to 24 hours before, and they offer a lowest price guarantee. Just book in advance - these tours fill up quickly, especially in peak season.

The whole experience takes about 9.5 hours, and you're back in London by evening. It's perfect if you want to see the best of the Cotswolds but don't have multiple days to spare.

One tip: wear comfortable walking shoes and bring a camera. The villages have uneven cobblestone streets, and you'll want to capture every charming corner.

Bottom line: if you want to experience the quintessential English countryside without the hassle of planning everything yourself, this tour is the way to go. It's well-organized, informative, and hits all the must-see spots in the Cotswolds.",1,1760631073.0,WeAreTravelers,0,1.0,False

1o8ad30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1o8ad30/i_hate_my_mom_and_i_feel_guilty_for_it/,I hate my mom and I feel guilty for it.,"I’m 16(F), I absolutely hate my mother, with every fiber of my being. I hate the way she talks, I hate the way she cracks the unfunniest jokes, I hate the way her facial expressions form, or the way she smiles, or the way she eats. I hate her and I feel horrifically guilty for it. But I wish nothing more than for her to just vanish from my life. She’s not that old either so it makes me even more pissed that she’ll probably live longer than my dad, whom I adore the most. Now the reasons to why I hate my mom are the following; she used to beat me and my siblings when we were younger. Eventually she stopped but as a kid I picked up on the fact that she was the type of person where if she had a bad day, everyone else had to experience it as well. I picked up on what pisses her off, I picked up on how to please her and keep her calm and in line. I picked up on how to be the most perfect version of a child a parent could ever want. Nothing is ever enough for someone like this though. Eventually as I got older my mom picked up on the fact that I was indeed a human being with emotions and issues. She found out I used to do harmful things to myself and to this day I have the conversation we had about it completely blocked up, because she yelled and said the cruelest things, and kept emphasizing how I shouldn’t feel this way as I have a roof over my head and food on my plate. This happened when I was 14, I promised myself from then on I’d never EVER let her find out anything about me unless it’s something I verbally said to her, or intentionally did in front of her so she can get a certain thought or idea about me. I set up accounts on every platform I have that had specific conversations with friends, they are completely filtered so even if she looks through every conversation it’s gonna seem like I’m a completely normal person. I hide the fact I play video games and I clear my phone and laptop every single day. I indulge in art and she would look through my sketchbook and assume everything I draw meant that I wanted to kill myself. Now I hide every sketchbook I own and every year I either burn or get rid of a few sketchbooks so it’s easier to hide recent ones. I go to school feeling immense anxiety, not sure if I’m gonna arrive to a loving mom or an argument and yelling and whatnot. I never back talk, I always apologize even if it’s so clear she’s in the wrong. And even with all these safety measures I’ve taken. Nothing seems to keep her happy. Once I went downstairs to get coffee and she began asking me to get her something. She didn’t even finish her sentence, I was standing and I sighed, not for any genuine reason I was just sighing I guess. And I think it ticked her off how I stood or how I wore my facial expression, my eyes were too hooded I think. She yelled at me, asked me if I was sick of her or something. And now I force myself to always keep a genuine happy facial expression. I keep my eyes wide open and I always try to at least slightly smile. I mean it when I say I look like a fake doll. Frankly I’m exhausted of acting in front of someone who will never ever be pleased. Each interaction is mentally exhausting cuz I have to keep reminding myself to stand straight look ahead smile a bit and not look upset in any way shape or form, I tell her I love her almost after every interaction, but I never fucking mean it, and I never will. I want a mom who likes me for me. I want to tell her how I like music and how I love playing games with my friends, how I like art, I want a mom who’s not gonna assume everything I do has a malicious intent behind it. I’m genuinely just a teenager who wants to have a fun time. I don’t want to do insane shit I just don’t. I guess I wanted to rant more than get advice. But even that would be appreciated because I’ve noticed each time I interact with her I feel like my act is gonna collapse any second. I don’t want anyone wishing bad stuff on my mom I just wanted to express the pain, of having to experience anxiety and anguish every waking minute of my god awful life.

Hi everyone. Fist time post. Kinda long, hope that's okay. I figured I'd share my experience and hopefully get some opinions, as I had trouble finding posts that I felt were related to my situation or the questions I have. Also, I'm American and decided to post here because most of my search queries brought me to this subreddit. This is probably due to split-doses being much more difficult to come by in our healthcare system. Thanks in advance for any insight.

\--Background--

(I don't know if this section is entirely necessary, but it kind of felt nice to just write it out.)

I dealt with depression/anxiety in my early 20's. Lexapro(Cipralex) and Xanax helped me get through that period of my life. I hadn't taken/needed any medication since age 23. Fast forward to now, I'm 32 and had a child last year. I did not adjust to baby life well at all, and my depression came back with a vengeance. Knowing I needed to do something before things took a turn for the worse, I scheduled with a psychiatrist. 

The first psychiatrist diagnosed me with ADD, though I brushed that off and insisted I be put back on Lexapro. This worked just fine, and 8 months later, with a new psych, I decided to revisit the ADD diagnosis. This psych agreed with my diagnosis and prescribed Vyvanse(Elvanse.) I've titrated up to 50mg and have since stopped using the Lexapro(Cipralex.) Everything has been great, I'm more productive, enjoying time with my baby, this has been life-changing, yadda-yadda-yadda. Everyone knows about the quality of life improvements from this Rx lol.

\--Issue--

Like many others, efficacy isn't the problem, duration is. My psych is supportive of me splitting my doses manually (can't get prescribed the same medication twice in the U.S. without paying a ton of money), and I have found 30mg in the morning and 20mg 2 hours later gets the best result so far.

I get about 6 hours ""peak effect"" and 3 hours ""residual effect"", and I crash 10 hours after taking my first dose. I've been taking my medication every single day since I was prescribed for the past 5 months. I am worried I am dependent on it and feel I may already be losing some efficacy/crashing sooner. I have read in many other people's experience that they have garnered a lot more benefit by not taking it for a day or two every week.

I do not have days where I can be lethargic or unproductive or what have you. I work 14-hour shifts on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I help my disabled grandma in assisted living a day or two every week, I'm slogging through a Cybersecurity Degree via online university, various household duties, all of this while also wrangling the wee child at the same time. I'm not complaining, as the medication makes me actually want to get ahead with all these things and improve my life.

\--Question--

I will keep trying different timings with my doses to see if I can get maybe 2 more hours until the crash, but I think a tolerance break would aid more significantly, perhaps. My main questions are:

1.) Do you utilize weekly or routine tolerance breaks?

2.) How do you guys get through a day or two without taking your medication?  
(Prior to the Elvanse I was consuming roughly 350mg caffeine minimum every day for several years. probably several hundred mg more on any given day, since tacking down how much is in coffee is difficult.)

3.) If I can't figure out tolerance breaks, then if you have any special considerations I might have not taken into account while I work out the best possible timing between my doses.  
(All I've tried is re-capsuling and splitting in water, at different times.)

Bonus question: I could not find anyone who split their doses more than twice a day. Has anyone ever tried, for example, splitting 50mg into 20mg, 20mg and 10mg across 4 or 5 hours or perhaps splitting even more?

I should also note that I plan to have more conversations about this with my psych doc as soon as I can, though I can't afford to see her until March next year at the earliest. (That's American healthcare, bay-beeeee!)

Any studies people want to provide are also greatly appreciated! I'm too dumb to understand a lot of the content, but I still feel like I learn a lot from reading the Abstract, Discussion, Conclusion, etc.

\*\*\*TL;DR: Worried I'm developing a dependency and tolerance to Elvanse. I can't afford days where I'm unfocused/unproductive. Curious what other people's experience is with routine tolerance breaks and how they manage it, particularly if you're a super busy person. Otherwise, anything I might want to consider as I hone in on the optimal timing of my split doses would be helpful.\*\*\*

I was recently diagnosed as a diabetic and I'm trying to figure out on my food and drinks. 

My usual cafe carries **Pacific Foods Barista Almond Milk** and this one does contain sugar of 8g as it's not unsweetened version. From my research, whole milk contains natural sugar in them so I've been getting only unsweetened almond milk. But it's so hard to find cafe that carries that. 

If I'm ordering just regular flat white with no syrup or flavors, **which milk would you recommend between Whole milk or Barista blend almond milk?** 

I don't know what brand of whole milk they use but generally whole milk contains more sugar than 8g but it has fats and protein which should help with glucose spike, whereas barista almond milk only contains very small amount of fat but lower in sugar and calorie contain.

It's so hard to find drinks other than americano or just a tea.

As the title suggests I am looking for budgeting/savings advice as someone in their late 20s, single, living in the South Shore (Rive-Sud) area of MTL.

I make about $4,460 each month after deductions and I am not taxed on my salary nor am I taxed on any of my bills and or purchases. Through my job I have a pension I pay into, private health + life insurance, travel insurance, etc., 

My fixed monthly expenses are as follows: 

Rent - $1,000
Internet - $25
Hydro - $65
Car - $477 (New and under 3 years warranty) 
Car Insurance - $184
Rent Insurance - $37
Phone - $86 

Total: $1,874

My variable monthly expenses are as follows: 

Groceries - $250 or so
(I shop on sale, meal prep, make coffee at home, don’t eat much meat, and rarely order out.)

Gas - $100 or so 

This totals out to approx. in essential spending each month: $2,224

So, I am left with about $2,240 each month and would like to know the best method for saving/where I should be allocating the remaining funds.

For example, I know I should pay more into my pension or open a TFSA/Roth IRA, have a buffer fund for emergencies, etc., but want to know realistically how to go about all of this. 

I should also mention I have no debt aside from my car note. My credit card is paid off and not regularly used, but I do feel I should take a new card with better rewards associated for things like grocery purchases, gas, etc., 

I don’t have any streaming subscriptions like Netflix. 

I appreciate any feedback! Thank you!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

One morning I woke up dragged myself out of bed and couldnt shake the heaviness. Coffee didn’t help, my favorite podcast sounded flat, i cried over nothing. I kept sleeping or trying to but feeling tired never seemed to leave. My motivation slipped i couldnt focus even doing simple stuff felt like climbing. I finally agreed to get a full blood panel because I needed something. My vitamin D was under conventional normal, my B12 was low‑normal and magnesium was flirting with deficiency. Nothing said urgent but enough to matter. When I started gently supplementing and adjusting my diet sunshine time, rich greens, nuts, safe D3 I didn’t wake up brand new but within a week I felt odd shifts a little more stable mood in the evenings, less brain fog in the afternoons and less of that empty tank feeling by midday. Has this ever happened to you? Like the depression you felt was actually something deeper, something you could change (food, nutrients, movement)? What was your first clue that it wasn’t just in your head?

I’ve tried brewing at 210 or as close to 100c as Brian Quan recommends. But every cup is just astringent or sour nothing really standing out or pleasant. I’ve tried all the way down to 300 microns 11 clicks on my commandante C40 and messed around with different grind sizes in between all the way up to 28 clicks. I reached out to Sey they said to try a fine grind and low agitation with 7 minute brew time. Same thing astringency and drying of the tongue.

The small businesses that turned that space into a local hangout are being forced out by the same landlord who benefited from their success. Cenizo Coffee, the truck that brought energy and steady crowds to the park, is being told their signed contract is invalid even though it is backed by a lawyer and includes full rights to serve coffee on site.

People who have tried to ask questions or speak up online are finding their comments deleted and their profiles blocked. Posts that call attention to what is happening disappear within minutes. At the same time, the park is advertising new vendors as if everything is fine and the original tenants never existed.

For residents of Easton Park and anyone who cares about Austin’s small business culture, this is worth paying attention to. It is the same pattern we have seen across the city. Locals pour their hearts into building something special, and once it becomes popular, property owners push them out for profit.

If you are part of the Easton Park community, please help keep this story alive. Support Cenizo Coffee and the other vendors who made that park what it is. Leave honest reviews and share their story so it cannot be buried.

If anyone from KVUE, KXAN, or the Austin Chronicle sees this, this is a story that deserves daylight.

I’m a hopeless romantic who yearns for gentle romance, sharing life with my person, making memories, being there for each other, all that classic relationship stuff. Alas, as tragicomic as it sounds, I’m also asexual. Which means I’m not up for anything sexual, *ever*. This, to no surprise, has made my love life a bit challenging. Maybe we’ll change that? I offer you dry humour, teasing as a love language, random info dumping and loads of cuddles. Needless to say, I’d love a partner who accepts my boundaries and is happy without any carnal activities, so someone with a very low drive, or maybe I’ll strike it lucky and you’re ace too! **So, in a nutshell**, I’m looking for a romantic long term relationship. Easier said than done, being ace, but I never say never.

Now, since lists are clear and effective, have some!

**Who I am:**

* 27 years old (1998)
* born and raised in Finland
* atheist and a progressive person (liberal, leftie, woke, feminist, you get it)
* chubby and short (160cm), short dark brown hair (but it changes, it’s been green, blue, purple…)
* some small tattoos but I dream of a full sleeve or two
* don’t smoke or drink at all, my only vice is coke zero
* don’t want kids
* city girl, love the buzz of big cities, culture, museums, coffee shops, shopping etc.
* into writing, reading, photography, fashion, k-pop, city holidays, binging tv shows
* not athletic or outdoorsy lol
* sadly allergic to pets :(

**Who I’m looking for:**

* around my age, give or take a few years
* located somewhere in Europe
* doesn't want kids
* knows what he wants, emotionally intelligent, honest, humorous
* someone I can have both deep conversations and fun with

**Dealbreakers/ Big NOs for me:**

* sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, bigotry in general

I have only ran through probably 6 cycles but got it where I'm enjoying the taste right now. Will continue to make small adjustments and dial it in more.

I went to a local coffee shop that roasts their own beans. The problem is they put them in the the big dispensers not individual bags. Reluctantly I got some of those before I found out that's a no no. Why would they do that (besides the obvious reasoning being the cost of labor to individually bag them). I haven't had any luck locally finding freshly roasted beans within a 30 day freshness period. However, I'll keep searching.

Day 2 was the hardest, but not even close to actually hard. I wanted to eat even though I wasn’t hungry. It was more habit than hunger. Very interesting to distinguish those two sensations. 

Day 3, 4 and 5 were smooth. No hunger, just calm and clear focus. Did marathon meetings on the job with no problem at all. 

Yesterday evening I did a breathwork session and had a crazy sweat purge, which never happened before. 

ALso I did feel noticeably colder the last two days. 

My lip is a bit cracked today, but that’s it.

Right now I feel light, clear and peaceful. Honestly a bit addicted to the feeling.

I’m M51, widower, adult kids.  She F41, no kids, divorce not finalised after 4 years but 100% separated from husband.

We’ve been seeing each other since Feb 2022 so 3.5 years.  We don’t live together, but we are now very much exclusive and very much in love.  We lab to merge lives eventually but she moves as fast as a tortoise in resolving her marriage and moving in.  First year together was lighter, as she was working to reconcile with husband.

So when we met she’d come out of a one sided non monogamous relationship where she allowed her husband to see other women to allow him space to find himself.   They were married since early 20s and are still very close and care for each other.  He’s a gorgeous man, and now very much repartnered.  But the non monogamy was the cause of an acrimonious explosion of the marriage.   (*She still largely blames herself…*)

After a year of dating she surprised me one night while tipsy that she’d been thinking to explore dating women to explore her bisexuality.   I totally support her finding herself, but that’s not what I signed up for and let her know how much this came a shock, and the anguish the concept caused me.  (i told her ‘*dating women or men, that’s still dating others, and that’s not for me, lovely* ’).

That issue slowly went away and never came back.

At the start of this year on a long drive I told her that I never felt the ‘non monogamous’ sword of Damocles had ever been resolved. We spoke at length and I came to understand that she values monogamy with me, her experience with her husband was extremely damaging and that she has no interest or thought of seeing other people.

I felt much better after that.

So that’s the context.   I don’t doubt her resolve, and truly believe she doesn’t consider exploring else where.  She’s expressed that she plans to merge lives with me and possibly marry.

She’s also very closed with her feelings.  She has a strong ‘outside face’ of cheery kindness, but years of therapy have allowed her to see how her Asian father strongly shaped her to doubt her own judgement, devalue herself and as a result, exist unaware of even her own feelings and desires.   So if she’s unaware, I’m unaware too until they appear out of nowhere and surprise us both.   (…*the dating women thought bubble she shared from above* 👆🏻 )

So given all that context, she’d met a guy on Bumble before she met me.   They messaged for months but he was overseas.  Eventually they both moved on.

However he came to town last January and they went out for a drink - which became 2 bars, dinner then another bar before she got home late.   Really stylish cocktail bars, both dressed up etc… quite a lavish evening.

I’m prone to anxious attachment, and while I’m aware of it and actively manage it, this threw me off really badly.  It just-didn’t- sit-right.

I shared my discomfort and anxiety.   She was super consoling and caring.   Assured me no flirting, not a hint, both of them talked about their respective partners (*so me, and the lady that he’s seeing*)

At the end I just put it down to my anxious attachment, apologised for my reaction and we moved on.  The point that sticks with me about that incident however, was that she couldn’t understand my concern.

Further, given her lack of awareness of her own inner feelings and desires until they come out and surprise ever herself, she couldn’t understand my feeling that it’s kind of not ok to spend a whole evening of fancy bars and intimate candle lit spaces in the huge grey area of sharing this space with a guy who she’d been planning to date.

I should add that I’m against controlling or caging a partner just because you can’t handle your own insecurities.   My attitude is “*My emotional shit is mine to deal with, and I’ll do my damn best not to put it on you.*”

So tonight he was in town again.
To be sure - she invited me along too to meet this guy and spend the evening together.   I had a graduation event for my son’s high school so I couldn’t go.

So she went alone.

They met early in the evening, and same story.  A couple of bars, then dinner, then another bar for a night cap.   Finally home late and tired and a goodnight message to me.  I don’t expect messaging throughout the night (*and thankfully I was busy and focussed elsewhere…*)

My daughter is 21, astute and switched on.   She understood what was happening and we talked about it before when I got home.

Her take is that at 21, she’d never allow this if it were her boyfriend doing this.   Her comment was that “…*the grey area is just too big.  It doesn’t feel right and you shouldn’t be cool with this, dad*.”   She really likes my partner a lot, i should add.  So no simmering dislike.

My reply to my daughter is that I’d never do this to my partner - I’d actively avoid spending a whole evening with a women that I’d been on the path to dating because of how it would make my partner feel.   I’d catch up with this hypothetical woman for a coffee or a simple dinner to shoot the breeze, but bars and dinner and nightcaps? I’d be feeling really self conscious of how it looked, and I’d be doing a whole lot of consoling and explaining if it ever happened.

**Finally my question to you wonderful women of this forum:  what’s your take?**

Am I over reacting, and should I let her have her life without me?

Or is she displaying poor judgement and potentially opening the door to feelings being rekindled?  Should I be concerned?

1o89wfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/hsp/comments/1o89wfh/am_i_overly_sensitive_or_is_this_friendship_close/,Am I overly sensitive or is this friendship close to an end?,"So I have/had this long-time friend from primary school - we're both 24 y.o. We were really close in primary school, then we went to different high schools and we weren't in touch for some time properly, only there and there. Around 2021 we got into talking again and spent more time together, mainly because we graduated.

I remember how we used to do vacations together, sleepovers, going for a coffee and these kind of things at least once in 2 months. We would message each other often as well. However something started to change I think 1.5-2 years ago? We would hang out, travel and all that, but whenever I'd share something random that happened to me she'd leave me on read and I feel like it started to be more and more apparent with time. One time we were even supposed to hang out that day, but I shared something random in a few messages - she didn't respond and then ask me where I was? Which kinda pissed me off. So at that time I had a talk with her that that's enough and I expect her to try to give me back the same effort as I give to her, because she'd tell me she didn't know what to say to my venting.

Around that time I also noticed that she didn't like me venting about guys and honestly I never really shared much about my dating life because she never dated anyone yet, which is fine, but each time I felt that ""block"" that she doesn't want to talk about guys because she has no experience. One time I told her I started to listen to the same music genre as my crush at that time and I basically got scolded by her that I don't have my own music taste, that I'm copying him, which wasn't true - I just enjoyed the music he sent to me and there's nothing wrong with that.

And I did suggest her to try out Tinder for fun, she'd tell me she would and that I'd take nice pics of her, which I did several times (and honestly she is very pretty as well) but in the end she told me it's still not good enough and never proceed.

And so, around 8 months ago we started to talk about finding an apartment together - she wanted to move to the capital city (I already live here, but she wanted to because of her future internships). Me and my bf + flatmate we were also thinking about finding something better than what we had at that time. So she accepted and we were really excited. In the end it didn't work out, we had different ""views"" on what we want from an apartment - she wanted something more fancy, which surprised me because she is still a student, so instead she was looking for a flatshare on her own, which i think all these arguments during apartment hunting we had were one of the last reasons why this friendship will end probably..

Ever since I can remember she'd tell me she does feel insecure with her image and she'd often times shop clothes and whatnot, but now ever since she moved I can see it more and more. :( She'd have hair extentions and procedures that her parents would contribute to financially even if I'd tell her she looks pretty even without them. Then after 2 months she'd have hair extensions and other things removed because she's still a student and doesn't have enough of money for that stuff. Even when it comes to dining, often times we wouldn't agree on where to eat.

I also started to notice that during the last year she'd even irl mostly talk about herself, talk about cleaning properly and scolding her flatmates for not taking the trash out once, it felt to me like small things. One of the last times we saw each other we'd spend 2 hours together and when I left it felt like she mostly did the talk and i didnt really have many moments to share something myself, it was really weird. And stuff that I showed her - like the apartment where I and my bf lives now she didn't even remember how it looked like and asked if we have carpets and when I said that we do, she didn't say anything but she looked a bit disgusted/meh about it.. Though she did suggest during summer we could go to the gym together for example, maybe I could have invited her as well, I do kinda regret that.

But overall it really felt like her standards were off the roof now.

And the last drop was when 2 months ago my grandma got sick and got hospitalized, and I told her and she'd ask me for an update once, that hopefully she will make it and other supportive things, that hopefully her IV will do wonders for her etc. - I responded a few things, that she is bedbound and that it's not looking great and she left me on read, ever since then, nothing. And more things happened - my grandma didn't make it and other complications with my mom and stuff like that and she still doesn't know about it till this day.

I thought that maybe she has her own issues as I do, but 2 weeks back she posted on her IG story photos from her trip with another friend and now once a week she posts a different profile picture (she never did that), I think that's because she is never really happy with the current ones and honestly I'm pissed off. I thought she'd maybe reach out but nope.

In a few weeks we're supposed to go to a concert together - I have her ticket and it's gonna be really interesting, I don't know if I'm being overly sensitive but I think that she is rude and idk if I want someone like her in my friend circle anymore. It sucks because she used to be the closest friend, but now I'm quite disgusted.

My biggest issue with this is that I was her ""willow"", an open ear, but now when I had tough time she never reached out back to me and I honestly don't have the mood to go back to someone like her after being left on read with ""hey, oh so my last 3 months were terrible, hows its going with you""",1,1760630028.0,hsp,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I have only one friend, and no family because they have always made me feel uncomfortable and sometimes even unwanted. My best friend, A, 18F, knows about every bit of my struggle with this. A few months ago, I started talking to B, also 18F. A and B are in my hometown, I go to college 2 hours away. When I make a friend, it’s a big deal in my life. I got a crush on B and offered to take her out to coffee and she accepted. Then began a month and a half of me returning home every weekend to get coffee with her and she would have a new excuse every time until she eventually got back together with her ex. As you could image, this absolutely broke me, and A was by my side the whole time. 

Fast forward 2 months later to when I’m mostly over it and A meets B at a birthday party and they start talking. I think it’s wrong to tell A who she can and can’t be friends with so I try to instead gently remind her what B did. She didn’t get the hint. I gave up because I thought I was over B and I didn’t really care. But last night A and B posted and tagged each other of them going to an event together with a group of 6 friends or so. The pain I felt when I saw that post is the worst I’ve had in over 2 years. I froze, I was actually still and I could only feel my heart pounding. That’s when I put my foot down and confronted A who immediately apologized and said she’d do anything to fix it. Her excuse was that she didn’t consider how it would make me feel, which almost feels more offensive. 

I called my father to talk about it, a rarity and he said he’s not the one to talk to and it’s my mother I should call. I did, and she was supportive at first, until my sister overheard and started joking about it. I, in emotional turmoil, crashed out on her and told her how unacceptable it was to make jokes at my expense. My mom then defended my sister and said she was only joking and I didn’t need to be so harsh toward her.

I forgave A since I have no other people in my life, but I can’t get over it. I just can’t get past it at least for now. I know I’m not wrong for feeling this way, but I feel wrong for wanting A to feel the same pain I am. I want to show her this post, and primarily the future replies to it, but I feel so vindictive for wanting to do so. 

Just a thank you to all of you who read. It truly is an incredible service you all do to let people like me vent when we have nobody else. I hope you all have an incredible day.",0,1760629801.0,TrueOffMyChest,7,0.5,False

I’m moving to Bangalore soon and could really use some guidance from folks who’ve already made the move!

A bit about me — I’ve joined as an SDE and have around 2 years of experience. I’ve been living in Delhi NCR for the past couple of years, so this will be my first time staying in Bangalore. Super excited but also a little nervous about settling in.

I’ve started learning a bit of Kannada (want to respect the local culture) and I’m currently searching for a flat. Apart from housing and language, what else should I keep in mind?

Some specific things I’d love advice on:

* Common mistakes or scams to avoid as a newcomer
* How to make a few good friends or social circles here (I don’t want to be the lonely techie 😅)
* Best/safe areas to stay for working professionals
* Must-have apps or tips for local commuting, groceries, etc.
* Cost of living insights or hidden expenses people often miss

Would really appreciate any practical tips or personal experiences you can share.  
Also, if anyone here is open to catching up or grabbing a coffee sometime, I’d love to connect and make some local friends! ☕

1o89rsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1o89rsl/advice_please/,Advice please,"I (40f)have been with my husband(40m) for 22 years. We have 2 boys, 11 & 14. Since we first got together I have always done all the cooking, cleaning… everything. It honestly never bothered me that much and if it did I suppose I would just push it down because we had kids and there was no way I would want to separate and be away from my kids. I lost my dad at 19 to cancer. My mom and oldest sister in 2019 & 2020 due to cancer. Last year(Sept 2024) I got Covid for the first time and he didn’t do anything to help me. Didn’t see if I needed help, needed anything, and also didn’t clean the house at all or help with the kids. Something in my brain clicked and I realized if I was to get sick with cancer one day he would never take care of me. Since then I have been noticing just how much I do and how little he does. I work full time, drop the kids off at school, pick them up, bring them to practices. Literally everything. The only things he does is take out the garbage, mow the lawn, clean up dog poop outside and let’s the dog out(which I end up doing half the time anyway) he owns his own business and is home from work most days by 1pm. I started asking him to help me and he would fight with me instead of helping me. Now he will just wash the dishes even if the sink isn’t full to make it look like he’s helping but doesn’t do anything to actually help. Only performative. His main concern with me is sex. He complains that we never have sex and there is no intimacy. Sorry. I’m not really interested when I’m taking care of you like a child. 

Here is how my days have been recently:
I wake up, get the kids up, pack their lunches, make sure they’re all ready for school. 
Drive the kids to school. 
Come home and start working(I work from home) 
I take my lunch at 2pm and use that time to pick my kids up from school. Sometimes if they have an after school activity I have to go back around 3:30 to get whoever is there
I work until 5
Cook dinner
Bring my son to football 6-8 and I stay and watch bc he(my son)likes me to stay there
Come home, clean up the mess from dinner and tidy up the house. 
Get my kids in bed around 9:30/10 
Then I finally watch tv and go to bed

My husbands day:
Wakes up
Makes himself coffee
Goes downstairs and watches tv
Once me and the kids leave, he gets ready and leaves for work
Comes home around 1. Brings lunch for himself. Is in and out of the garage tinkering around. 
Sometimes plays catch with our son 
Eats dinner
When I get home from practice with my son, he jumps in the shower, eats cereal in the bedroom, and goes to bed by 9pm. 

e don’t talk, he doesn’t care to help me. 
We bought a house a few years ago that is a huge fixer upper. Anything that’s been done to the house has been done by me. By myself. He hasn’t helped. The only thing he did do was a bathroom renovation. He started a year ago and it’s still not done. He also knocked down a wall in a room with intentions of just moving it over. It’s been 4 year and nothing has been done with that either. 

I feel so alone and don’t know what to do bc I am literally living the life of a single mom who works full time, while still married. 
When I talk to him about it he tells me I don’t do as much as I think I do and tries to make it sound like he does so much and then he picks me apart and tells me all the things I do that he hates, But then will come back later and tell me he will do anything to fix it, but continues to do the same thing. I’m so sad inside and I feel like it’s over and I need to leave but how do I do it when he’s not really a bad guy. He just is the same way he’s been since we started going out. I feel like it’s kind of my fault too

After three years working on aid projects in Auchendale, Cora Spade finally returned to Chremford, debt-free. She’d spent every dime of her earnings paying off the three-million-dollar debt her husband, Axel Jaeger, had owed. On the night of her welcome dinner, Axel showed up with another woman in his arms. He carried her purse and coat with practiced ease, while their son, Nolan Jaeger, snuggled in her arms, intimately calling her “Lulu”. Cora’s expression fell, while Axel frowned at her reaction. “Don’t be petty. Louise is the nutritionist I hired for Nolan.” Fighting back tears, Louise Leighton sounded hurt as she murmured, “I’ll resign tomorrow, Ms. Spade.” That night, fresh from a shower, Cora was about to head into her bedroom when she overheard Axel’s voice from the children’s bedroom. He was on the phone. “How long is Cora planning to stay this time?” someone asked. Nolan piped up, “I don’t want Mommy back! If she’s here, Lulu has to leave!” Axel chuckled. “In that case, shall I rack up another ten million dollars in debt and keep her stuck in Auchendale for another ten years?” A crack of thunder split through Cora’s mind. She stood rooted to the spot, reeling. Before she could process what he meant, the call ended, and Nolan’s small voice followed. “Daddy, are you going to sleep with Mommy today? Won’t Lulu be upset?” Holding her breath, Cora could hear her heart pounding in her ears. Did Nolan mean what she was thinking? The rest of Axel’s words were a blur because she’d rushed into her room. Her breath was still unsteady when the door was gently pushed open. Axel came in, his hands sliding under her nightgown with practiced ease. But as that familiar touch—absent for three years—returned, she only felt numbness where there should have been excitement. His rough, calloused palms slid around her waist, and his warm breath brushed against her neck as his lips twiddled with her ears. Cora shut her eyes and clenched her jaw, refusing to respond. He chuckled. “You’re terrible at pretending to be asleep, silly. Your fluttering lashes always give you away.” Instead of opening her eyes, Cora shifted away slightly and said, “I’m tired, so not tonight.” But he couldn’t help but draw closer, his lips tracing lower down her earlobe. “Just lie back, honey. I’ll take care of the rest…” Even after three years apart, Axel still knew every inch of her body like the back of his hand. And her defenses slowly crumbled under his relentless teasing. His desire for her was almost overwhelming. The moment their bodies joined, a shared moan of deep satisfaction escaped them both. At the edge of release, Axel gripped her waist, gasping for air as he instructed. “Say it. Call my name.” Cora, lost in the blur of passion, softly whispered, “Honey…” Overwhelmed, Axel let out a low groan in response. “Lulu, sweetheart.” Cora froze, as if she’d been dumped with a bucket of ice water. “What’s wrong?” Axel paused, looking at her nervously. She swiftly withdrew like she’d just been stabbed and glared at him, frowning. “What did you just call me?” He blinked, his expression unchanging as he said, “Cora.” She took a deep breath and said in a low, certain voice, “No. It was Lulu.” Axel’s expression shifted through several emotions before settling into irritation. “We haven’t been together in years, Cora. I’m glad you’re back, but don’t start picking fights the minute you return.” She knew that look all too well—the anger of someone humiliated and embarrassed after getting caught in a lie. Her heart sank, and without a word, she grabbed the blanket and turned her back to him. “Must you ruin the mood?” Cora kept her eyes shut and ignored Axel. A moment later, the door slammed shut behind Axel as he left. … The next morning, Cora was awakened by raised voices outside the door. In the dining room, Axel leaned back on the couch, sipping coffee, his eyes glued to the financial news playing on his phone. Dressed neatly, Nolan sat at the table and nibbled on a perfect omelet. In the kitchen, a slender silhouette was busy cooking. “Mommy.” Nolan spotted Cora first. His tone was softer than it’d been at the welcome dinner, though it still sounded distant. Axel acted like he hadn’t heard, with his eyes fixed on the phone. “Good morning, Ms. Spade. Would you like breakfast?” Louise emerged with a bowl of oatmeal. Cora’s eyes flicked to Nolan’s wary face before she gave a faint nod. Relieved that she wasn’t about to drive Louise away, he went back to his omelet. “Bring it to the study,” Cora added. “I need to answer some work messages.” Louise looked conflicted. “The oatmeal’s for Mr. Jaeger. He has a weak stomach.” “In that case, make me another bowl,” Cora replied as she drew a steadying breath. Louise glanced at Axel, who didn’t so much as look up. “Do as my wife says.” Her eyes widened in wounded disbelief. But noticing his firm attitude, she murmured after a beat, “Got it.” Just five minutes later, a sharp cry came from the kitchen, followed by the crash of pots and pans. Cora rushed out of the shower to see that Louise’s wrist was bright red and covered in large blisters. She bit her lip hard, tears welling up in her eyes, as if she was glass about to shatter, stubbornly holding on. “You’re the worst, Mom!” The moment Nolan saw Cora, he bolted forward and swung at her with his little fists. His face was filled with fury as he screamed, “If you hadn’t demanded breakfast, Lulu wouldn’t have gotten hurt! You’re the worst mom ever!” Each tiny blow thudded against Cora’s chest, striking her squarely in the heart. “I’ll take her to the hospital,” Axel announced as he scooped Louise into his arms and carried her out, his cold eyes sliding past Cora without a pause. Nolan trailed after them in tears, leaving the house in chaos. It was barely recognizable after Cora had left for three years. Exhaustion washed over Cora as she took out her phone and dialed a number she never thought she’d call. The wait was so long she’d almost convinced herself the line must have been dead for years when it was picked up. A deep, aged voice answered, trembling with restrained emotions. “Cora?” Cora calmly replied, “I’ll do it, Dad.”",2,1760629638.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

But lately, my watchlist looked different. Alongside the usual crypto tickers sat names like NVDA and TSLA, blending into the same rhythm of green and red.

When Bitget rolled out its Universal Exchange, it felt like someone had quietly redrawn the trading map. No more switching apps or logging into different accounts now crypto and U.S. stocks shared the same stage. It was strange at first, almost like seeing two worlds collide, but it didn’t take long before it felt natural.

Then came the buzz about the new leaderboard event. $300,000 in NVDA shares  the kind of figure that gets even the most casual trader to look twice. The twist? Direction didn’t matter. Long or short, it all came down to trading volume. It wasn’t about being right every time, just about showing up and staying in the game.

Some treat it like a competition, others like a challenge against themselves. For me, it’s become a quiet reminder of how fast the markets  and the platforms we use are evolving. The boundaries that used to separate traders, assets, and strategies are fading. What’s left is a space where adaptability is the only real edge.",1,1760629533.0,Stocks_Picks,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1o89jok,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1o89jok/is_it_hit_should_i_see_a_doctor/,Is it HIT ? Should i see a doctor?,"A few months ago, I was coming out of an allergic rhinitis that lasted several days, when I had a glass of champagne and some dry meats with friends. The meal and the alcohol rekindled the symptoms of my rhinitis, my eyes and nose began to run again, and I was seized by a violent headache. It was then that I began to question the role of diet in my rhinitis and, more broadly, in all my symptoms. During my teenage years, I began to notice symptoms such as eczema and episodes of intense stomach ache, which took me to hospital because there was blood in my stools. I also had long periods of chronic fatigue, depression  for no apparent reason. I often felt very tired after meals, to the point of being unable to motivate myself to do anything, but also of waking up in the middle of the night without being able to go back to sleep, and of waking up in the morning tired and with a mental fog. I put all this down to my anxiety. I also suffered regularly from hay fever or allergic rhinitis. I was also prone to fairly violent and recurrent headaches, which I couldn't explain to myself. A little later, when I started drinking alcohol, I noticed that my hangovers were very intense, much more intense than those of my friends: waking up at night and being unable to go back to sleep, depression, intense headaches even when drinking a lot of water, nausea and vomiting, sometimes even with a small amount of alcohol. I also started having haemorrhoids, which still haven't gone away, even after consulting a doctor and undergoing treatment. Taking stimulant drugs like ectazy left me in periods of descent that were longer and more intense than those of my friends: heavy depression lasting several weeks, intense fatigue, high anxiety, and I quickly gave up using these drugs, but not alcohol. For several years, between my 20s and 30s, my lifestyle was unhealthy: lots of alcohol, lots of junk food, lots of work-related stress, but also lots of running (marathons, half-marathons, athletics club training), leaving little room for my body to rest. In recent years, my lifestyle has improved a little, but many of these symptoms remain. After reading a lot on the internet and chatting on chatgpt, I'm almost convinced that I suffer from histamine intolerance. That's why I started a low histamine diet a month ago, following the SIGHI list, which has changed a lot of my habits: I've stopped coffee, alcohol, running and eating out. I'm gradually starting to reintroduce foods like pasta and beef, but so far without success. I've also stopped scrolling on my phone before going to bed, taken magnesium and practised certain qi gong exercises. I've noticed a relative improvement in my symptoms, I feel more energetic, I have less difficulty waking up in the morning and I sleep better. Nevertheless, this diet is difficult because I sometimes wonder if my diagnosis is the right one, but I have the impression that a doctor would cost me a lot of money and would be of little help because few people know about this subject. I'm often afraid of being misunderstood by those close to me or by my colleagues, so I avoid talking about it. Not being able to drink or go to restaurants is difficult for me, and also makes my social life more difficult. So do you think I'm on the right track? Do you have any advice? Do you think I should explore MCAS, SIBO? See a doctor? I'm clinging to the hope that I'll be able to start drinking small amounts again, or go to restaurants on rare occasions while taking antihistamines in a few months, but I don't know if that's realistic.",2,1760629225.0,HistamineIntolerance,0,1.0,False

It also helps if you say you’re a medical professional, as Sophia had. She was aware she was breaking the law, but the way she saw it, so were Batman and Spiderman. 

The first girl, the one he’d slept with just before Sophia, turned out to be a valuable dead-end. Sophia had driven out to visit her in rural Northumberland. 

It had not seemed peculiar to the girl that a sexual health professional was driving forty miles, both because she was naïve and because Sophia invented some story about a research project, using big enough words and citing enough governmental organisations that the girl didn’t doubt her.  

It turned out the girl's situation had been much the same as Sophia’s. She’d taken a bus through to town with friends, had one too many, and ended up back at Mikey’s place. She hadn’t slept with anyone for a year before. 

She’d developed symptoms a week later, and, humiliated and scared, had taken the medication and not told anyone. Sophia felt sorry for the girl, but there was still that gnawing sense that if only she’d told Mikey, Sophia might not have had to endure what she had. Then again, he was a selfish wanker. He probably would have continued fucking about regardless.  

The next girl was more of a character to contend with. She lived in Heaton, the half-gentrified, half-terrifying area just outside Newcastle. 

Sophia had expected to encounter a level of suspicion, which is why she’d printed out the fake ID badge, but like the first, this other girl welcomed her in at the front door and made her a coffee.  

The living room was sparse but well-kept. On the wall hung a giant print of Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany’s.  

‘That bastard,’ the girl said, emerging from the kitchen with Sophia’s drink.  

‘I have to admit, I’m embarrassed that I slept with him to begin with.’  

‘Who?’ 

The girl's perfectly drawn eyebrow curled up. 

‘Oh, I thought you were talking about Mikey?’  

‘Ah, no, not that pleb, but him and Carl are similar.’ 

Sophia paused. It seemed like everyone had their own Mikey.  

‘You know, I said to Carl beforehand, you’re clean, aren’t you, and he told me he’d had a check-up not so long ago.’  

‘You think he was telling the truth?’  

‘Obviously bloody not, or if he had it means he fucked some slut after that, but before me.’ 

Sophia thought the girl was pretty, in that northern way; she had dark features that could almost be Spanish but were likely gypsy. 

She didn’t seem like any kind of dummy either. The one thing that Sophia hadn’t expected to find in a house in Heaton was books, but there were a whole bunch under the coffee table. A Katie Price autobiography– that could be expected, but then also something by Isabel Allende and a thick textbook on chartered accounting. 

Sophia’s reason for starting her quest had been multifaceted, partly driven by a moralistic desire to set these people back on the correct course. 

She knew automatically that if she even attempted it with this girl, she’d be shown the door. 

‘It’s good in a way,’ Sophia replied. At least if he’s telling the truth about being tested, it means fewer possible sources of infection.  

The girl considered Sophia as if to say You’re not from around here, are you. 

‘I mean, having an STI is shit, but it’s not like the end of the world, it’s more like the betrayal of Carl not telling me. I don’t just give it away, I mean, I’m far from a virgin, but I’m only gonna sleep with someone unprotected if I think there’s a future...or Mikey, that’s just because we went to high school together and we used to share books. Looks like we’re sharing more than that now.’  

Sophia had felt unprepared when she went to see Mikey. She knew if she was going to interview multiple people, she needed to have a more systematic approach. That’s why she’d forged an ID and gone back to the GUM clinic and taken one of the forms you have to fill out before you see a doctor. 

It was easier than trying to bring up in conversation whether or not you’ve had unprotected sex with a sex worker.  

The girl filled out the form without any further questions, and Sophia told her that she’d have to do the same at the clinic for treatment.  

She was careful in her words when first setting up a meeting. As a reference, she gave the address of a rural clinic that nobody would then go out to and mention they’d had a house visit. 

Even if someone mentioned it at the big clinic in town, the staff wouldn’t ask too many questions. Sophia mightn’t know much about medicine, but she knew a lot about bureaucracy and rarely did the head know what the tail was doing. Even if a suspicion were raised, a sense of apathy somewhere along the chain would sink any investigation.  

Finally, the girl handed the pen back to Sophia. ‘And tell Carl from me that he’s a fucking wanker.’ 

… 

Sophia instantly got the sense that Carl represented the worst of the patriarchy. He worked as an estate agent, with his own office, company car, and thriving career, which to others may have seemed impressive, but not to her. 

Carl almost smuggled her into the building through a side door. He seemed in such a panic when they got into his office that he didn’t have time to be distrustful of her or even embarrassed.    

‘Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck.’ He began. ‘I didn’t realise those symptoms meant...fuck.’ 

Sophia had it in her head that she was going to tear through these people when she encountered them, but irony of ironies, because she was pretending to be a dedicated health professional, she had to act the part to be believed.  

She put on her best stern yet comforting voice. ‘The severity of the symptoms in your genital area should have raised an alarm, and in the future if...’ 

Carl fidgeted so much he almost fell out of his swivel chair. Sophia paused and noticed he kept reaching up for his Adam’s apple, stroking and guarding it with his neat fingers.  

‘The symptoms are not down there.’ He gestured toward his suit trousers. ‘They’re in my throat.’  

Sophia tried her best not to look stunned. She’d done her fair share of reading on the subject and had never come across anyone who had gonorrhoea in their throat. Of course, it made sense; they were opposite ends of the same pipe.  

‘Oh, well, that *doesn’t* complicate the treatment.’ Not that she was thinking about treatment, all she cared about was following the bread crumbs.  

‘You said on the phone that you’d want to contact any partners I’d had, is that necessary? I mean, really necessary?’ Again, he looked out into the deserted office where the staff had gone for their lunch break.  

‘There’s no reason for you to blame yourself, Carl.’ Sophia lied. ‘In this case, you’re just as much a victim.’  

He lifted his wrist, allowing his silver watch to slide further down his arm. It looked new. In fact, everything in that office did. The screen protector still lay over the laptop. There were prints in the corner still waiting to be hung on the freshly painted walls.  

‘And it’s a legal requirement.’  Sophia continued, sensing his openness waning.  

‘That’s going to be complicated.’ He coughed, and something solid stuck in his throat. Sophia winced in her seat. The same thing in his tonsils was on her private parts. They were brother and sister.  

‘There’s been only two girls?’ Sophia replied, ‘In the last three months?’  

‘Yes, Emily, who you know, and one other.’ He sighed, glancing around his own office as if admiring it himself. 

He picked up the key fob for his company car and massaged it, then nodded to himself as if a decision had been made or rather, his choices had run out.  

‘You’ll have to wait ten minutes until the staff come back from their lunch break.’  

Sophia thought she knew what had happened. He’d been sleeping with one of the secretaries. It was a tale as old as time. *Hotshot* fucks *new-hire* straight from the casting couch. Bastard. 

In modern times, though, those things didn’t fly, which probably explained why he was so nervous. He was linked to the scene of the crime by fresh biological evidence. 

… 

She sat in his office and watched through the window as he greeted the seven or so staff coming back in from their lunch break. Carl wasn’t a handsome man, definitely not on the level of the Cheryl Cole looking girl he’d infected, but he had a certain charm.  

He had a way with people, like a good lawyer. No, that was too grandiose for this scumbag, like a second-hand car salesman.  

Through the glass, she could hear shouts of delight. Carl had told them that they could take another thirty minutes for lunch. She expected him to pull one of the pretty young girls in a pencil skirt back and bring her into the office. 

Sophia would make a point of staying as long as possible and exercising the full powers of her legal mind if he dared blame the girl for passing anything onto him.  

But instead, they all disappeared back out the front door. Then Carl went toward the other end of the central room, where there was an office slightly bigger than the one Sophia was sitting in. 

Through the gap in the open blinds, she could just about make out an older man who must have slid in along with the other staff. On the door of the office was the name Aspall, and she realised he must be the boss because that was also the name on the sign out front.  

Aspall nodded serenely at Carl, and then the younger man came back through, his face still perturbed and now flushing brilliantly red as he told Sophia the boss wanted to see her. 

Carl disappeared out the front door, never to be seen again, and now, bafflingly, Sophia was left in another office with a fifty-odd-year-old estate agent.  

She launched into her spiel, listing her fake credentials, still unsure why she was speaking to the heavy-set man in the eggshell blue shirt.  

She looked around the room for any clue, and then it hit her. On the desk was a picture of two women: a mother and daughter. The mother looked like one of those working-class women who’ve hit it big and then decided to dress how they think a posh person might. The daughter, even with the heavy makeup, had inherited her father’s masculinity.  

Sophia’s new working theory was this: Carl had been at it with the boss’s daughter, and he’d just broken down then and there and confessed everything to Aspall.  

Aspall listened to her without interrupting, his bowling ball head motionless. She handed him the form that all her patients had filled out, and then, to her utter shock, he crumpled it up.   

‘You’ve convinced that dozy prick, but I don’t believe a word you say.’  

Aspall spoke in a terrifyingly thick Geordie accent, the kind that set off assumptions in your mind that he definitely *knew* some people.  

‘P, p, pardon?’  

‘Are you friends with that slut he’s been porking? Has she put you up to this?’  

Sophia felt her façade collapsing.  

‘I can assure you, sir, I work for the North East sexual health service, and it’s part of a new procedure to...’  

‘You expect me to believe that the NHS, billions in debt, is now hiring people to drive around and conduct market research on the clap? Since when does a business search for people to give free drugs to?’  

If her shoddy credentials didn’t give her away, the look of horror that flashed across her face as she tried to reattach her mask did.  

Anyone else would have been defeated, but Sophia quickly understood that she’d been playing a character; now wasn’t the time to panic, it was time to fall back on her own formidable self.  

‘No, she didn’t put me up to anything, I did this of my own free will, this disease was passed on to me, and I had the right to investigate its origins.’ 

‘So you’re just an upstanding member of the general public?’ he smirked.  

There was something shark-like about him. She got the feeling that if she reached out and touched him, he’d be as cold as a door handle on a winter morning.  

 ‘You don’t know who I am, because I never gave anyone my name, I know who you are though, your name is all over this place, and I know your crony in the next office, and although I don’t know your daughter—’ She nodded at the photograph—‘Who I’m guessing Carl’s been sleeping with, I’m pretty sure I could find her if you gave me five minutes on the internet.’  

In another stage of his life, Aspall might well have reached across the table and slapped Sophia across the face. In the hard-drinking hard hard-selling days of the late eighties, he’d simply been known as *mad dog*. 

That being said, one of the strengths of a successful lunatic is the ability to spot another lunatic. In various bar fights over the years, it had probably saved his life. 

It at least gives you pause not to hit someone who will keep getting back up. Politicians called that a zero-sum game.  

Sophia, he figured, couldn’t have weighed more than eight stone, but she had that same lunacy. She didn’t know it, but if she’d been brought up in the same place as him, she’d have long ago stuck a smashed bottle of WKD into someone’s cheek. 

Christ, if things had worked out differently, he might’ve offered her a job.  

‘It’s me,’ Aspall replied, his voice like vapour rising from a block of ice, ‘Carl sucks my cock, I’m not a faggot, I just like the power.’  

Sophia was not just surprised but stunned. She thought she’d encountered corruption before. In fact, she saw it everywhere she went, but now here it was, in its pure form, a seventeen-stone lump.  

She felt her insides burning. There’d been this umbilical cord linking her to Mikey and then stretching back through time to the two girls and Carl. As disgusting as it had been, at least they’d been the same age, but to find this abomination.  

However, Sophia knew what had to be done; she had to keep following the tendril back. She was not a religious person, but the way she pursued her investigation had taken on almost supernatural properties. If she could just get far enough back and encounter the originator and harangue him for kicking off the whole project to begin with, she’d find salvation.   

‘Your wife,’ Sophia answered, ‘does she know?  

Aspall looked down at the photo of the chubby woman in expensive makeup. ‘Of course not.’  

‘Is there a chance she could have given it to you?’  

Sophia thought he might have taken offence, but instead, he just smirked. ‘No, me and my wife aren’t… intimate.. any more.’   

‘Then who did you contract it from. I’d like to contact them.’ 

Aspall nodded. ‘Give me your phone.’  

Sophia reluctantly handed it over, but Aspall didn’t input a number, instead switching it off. ‘I just wanted to make sure you aren’t recording this...’ He took a piece of paper and a pen and slid them across the desk. ‘I’m not writing it down, you can.’ And then he went into his own phone and read off a number.  

For the embarrassment Sophia had caused him, he wished he could be there and seen the look on her face when she saw the girl.  

… 

Sophia had been mighty confused when she called the number, and a voice in broken English had answered. She’d tried to explain herself, but the girl had kept hanging up. 

Her educated guess was that the girl was staying illegally in the country. In her mind, she was the cleaner at Aspall’s place, one of the silent, cowed army that operated in the shadows, kept things running, and themselves ran from the authorities.  

After a few days of trying, the girl had gotten back to her by message and they’d met in the Costa Coffee beside Monument in the town centre.  

Sophia might have laughed if she weren’t so angry/scared. She’d told the girl she’d be wearing a red hat so she’d be able to recognise her. It almost felt like a date.  

She sat in the window with a latte, watching the people stream by. 

Her stream of consciousness was interrupted by the sense of someone sitting down beside. Sophia turned. The girl seemed vaguely familiar. Her associative memory flashed, and she thought simultaneously of New Delhi and Beijing. The girl seemed reminiscent of those places, yet neither, somehow sandwiched between the two.  

‘Do I know you Sophia said?’  

The girl winced. She didn’t have many dreams in life, but one of them was that official-looking people would stop tracking her down.  

‘You say my health is danger?’  

‘Not terrible danger, I just need information from you.’  

‘You work for government?’  

‘I work for the national health service.’  

The girl looked set to flee. The words national health service had very different connotations in the dictatorship in which she was raised.   

‘Please.’ Sophia gently coaxed her into the seat, ‘I’m here to help.’  

The girl sat down, but she didn’t unzip her puffer jacket or dare face the opposite direction of the exit.  

‘I need to know how you know Mr Aspall?’ Sophia continued, ‘Do you work for him?’  

The girl went to reply and then turtled up.  

‘Mr Aspall claims he caught a disease from you. Don’t worry, it isn’t serious, but it’s my job to trace back any lines of infection.’  

As Sophia spoke the words, a shroud the size of Asia fell over her. What if this girl had brought back some incurable tropical STI from the slums?  

The girl bowed down and then rubbed her forehead with her small, slender fingers. ‘Oh no, oh no.’  

‘Don’t worry, you aren’t in trouble, none of this is on record, we just need to know who you’ve come into contact with in the past. Anyone from where you migrated from?’  

The girl was on the verge of tears, but managed to shake her head. ‘No, I was a virginal when I left home.’  

Sophia instantly felt better.  

‘That’s good, that’s fine, so who was the man before Mr Aspall?’ 

The girl was obviously running a different track of thought. Her focus kept falling away into some mysterious place Sophia couldn’t follow. ‘I need to live,’ the girl said, ‘how until I am fix?’  

‘I’m sorry, I don’t understand.’ 

‘I need to fix. Can you fix me? It is my job now.’  

Still, Sophia was lost. ‘What? What is your job?’  

The girl steadied herself. ‘My boss says I am beautiful doll, like Barbie, every girl in my village growing up wanted to be a Barbie.’  

Sophia almost began a lecture on unrealistic beauty ideals, but stopped herself. ‘He says you’re a doll?’  

‘Yes, a doll, and it’s only fair to be shared around with his friends, like Mr Aspall.’  

For Sophia, there was the horror that this poor girl was being used as a living, breathing sex doll, but worse, far worse, God knows how many new sources had entered the equation. Up until then, every divide had been on the same branch, but now that branch was splitting off into a giant, monstrous tree. 

‘Please tell me, how many friends have you been passed to?’ Sophia was struggling to control her breath.  

‘They have club,’ the foreign girl replied, ‘maybe ten people, ‘and many girl like me.’ 

‘How many?’ Sophia cut her off.  

‘I am new to the club. Mr Aspall is my first person to be share with. Just chairman of club and Mr Aspall.’  

Sophia controlled her panting. After everything, all wasn’t lost; now she just needed to talk to this chairman. Yes, she would speak to him, and immediately call the police. 

‘If you give me the chairman’s number, I promise everything is going to be ok.’  

The girl looked up with her honest, wide-open face. Sophia thought she was more beautiful than a Barbie, at least more natural.  

‘But he look after me.’  

‘It could be very dangerous if he has the disease and it doesn’t get treated. Please, let me explain things, my English is better and I’m an expert in this field.’ Sophia noticed two police officers walking by outside and nodded at them. ‘It’s the law.’  

Any doubts the girls may have been having disappeared. In her mind, the NHS, the government, and the police were all the same thing. She was loathe to trouble the chairman in any way, but she was even more terrified of officialdom. 

She pulled out a battered Samsung and set to work scrolling through it.  

Sophia entered the contact and called the number immediately. It had been disconnected. She had half expected this when she found out that Aspall and the chairman knew each other.  

‘Ok, it isn’t working. I’m gonna need you to give me an address. Where do you meet the chairman?’  

This time, the girl hesitated once again, meeting Sophia’s burning gaze with her brown eyes, then she looked down at the floor and finally to her phone.  

She went into Google Maps, showing an overview of Newcastle, and then zoomed in on the location marked by a red pin. She reached over and then held the map up to Sophia’s face.  

Sophia blinked once. It was her father’s house.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

1o89dzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MintChanFandom/comments/1o89dzh/big_announcement_mintchan_is_getting_her_own/,🌈 BIG ANNOUNCEMENT: Mint-chan is getting her own webcomic!,"Hey everyone! For the past few weeks, I've been working on the comic series **""Mint-chan in Colorland""** and I'm just so excited to share it. This is absolutely a dream come true for me and I thank everyone for being here! Without you all, I wouldn't have the courage to even start it.

And of course some of you will have questions, so here are the answers to what I predict to be the questions you might be asking.



**What is the comic about?**

""Mint-chan in Colorland"" is basically about all things color-related, symbolism, history, psychology, tropes... It's just color trivia basically, *but* it takes place in a world where colors are people! Which I guess can be interpreted as a form of social commentary, hmm...

It's mostly episodic, lighthearted, and sometimes gets a little philosophical about identity and perception. I would want to say it's an informative comedy but I am neither smart nor funny enough to make those claims.



**Where can I read it?**

The series will be available on Webtoon, and I'll post updates here too so no one misses out.

That said, reading on Webtoon helps the series reach more people (and appeases the mighty algorithm god). So if you can, go tap that subscribe button there!



**When will it be released?**

NOVEMBER 16TH BABY! Exactly a month from this post.

Oh and new episodes will drop twice a week, because if I have a coffee addiction might as well put those stimulants into good use.



Can I goon to Mint-chan?

Hold up why the hell are you asking-  Wait, I'm the one asking this question... 

^(What have I become...)



Anyway, that's all for now! Thank you so much again for supporting me and Mint-chan's journey.

I initially used to take Softovac and Cremaffin, but they stopped working after 1–2 weeks. Then I consulted an Ayurvedic doctor who prescribed Swadisht Virechan, which honestly became quite addictive — I ended up taking it for almost a year.

Later, I saw a homeopathy doctor who helped me get off Swadisht Virechan using his medicines and Triphala. But Triphala didn’t really work that well for me. After 3 months of trying all that, I was like kab tak dawaiyon pe rahu, so I stopped everything.

Then I switched to coffee, and it worked for about 2 months, but eventually that too stopped being effective.

Now I’m really worried if I’ll have to live with this problem my whole life or if there’s actually a permanent solution out there. If anyone has gone through something similar or found something that worked long-term, please share your experience. 🙏

As for Esther and Diane, since they met often, I imagine they must have talked about Jack and Grace and how “perfect” their relationship seemed. Grace not having a mobile phone, sharing an email address with Jack, eating a lot but still being underweight, and their overly polished image as a couple should’ve raised some suspicions.

Even the subtle hints from the neighbors suggested that people sensed something was off.

>’It’s the second time you’ve stood me up,’ Diane points out.

>‘Well, at least you didn’t just forget this time,’ she teases. ‘Why don’t we meet up next Friday to make up for it? Would you be free, Grace? No dental appointments for you to suddenly remember at the last minute?’ ‘No, and no migraines either, I hope.’

Esther’s an interesting one. She seemed like a genuinely good friend, but I can’t help thinking she was also a little jealous of Jack and Grace’s **“too perfect”** marriage. Maybe that curiosity (or envy?) pushed her to dig deeper and that’s how she started to piece things together.

>I can’t help respecting her for being the first person to step into our house and not go on about how beautiful it is.

>But even that slight suggestion of discord between the two of us is enough for Esther.

>By the time we come back from the kitchen with a tray of coffee, Diane is exclaiming over the photos, although Esther doesn’t say much.

That jealousy or doubt about their “perfect” relationship might have made her notice the cracks. And Esther repeating her phone number multiple times, that definitely felt intentional, as if she was trying to make sure Grace remembered it.

During the birthday party scene, when Jack changed Millie’s favorite color, that must have deepened their suspicions too.

>‘Yes, Jack, you did,’ Diane confirms. ‘At least, that’s what you told us that time you gatecrashed our lunch in town.’

>‘But you said it on more than one occasion,’ Esther insists. ‘When you came to dinner at ours you said that you couldn’t wait for Millie to see her red bedroom.’ She looks over at me. ‘Isn’t that what he said, Grace?’

I feel like the book didn’t give much focus to Adam, but I think he plays a very vital role, just like Esther. Adam must have noticed something. He worked with Jack and also handled abuse-related cases, so I can’t help thinking he must’ve noticed a few red flags.

Also, since he was present at the wedding, I suspect he might have doubted that Jack pushed Millie. 

>‘Adam told me. It’s going to be all over the papers tomorrow, so he thought you should be prepared.’

  
I’m pretty sure those four friends discussed Jack and Grace every time they got together, the whole “too perfect” vibe just didn’t sit right.",1,1760628684.0,thrillerbooks,0,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

And most of all, saves money. (FWIW, I usually buy a Kroger brand ground coffee to make)

I’m getting lazier, so I recently bought a 48 ounce bottle of Seattle’s Best iced coffee for around $4.50. 

Assuming I stay on this lazy path, are there good iced coffee or cold brew brands folks might recommend? I add some sugar free creamer or syrup and that’s it. So it doesn’t take a lot to make me happy.

Hello, r/norge! I'm a South African lady planning to relocate to Norway in the near future with more enthusiasm than actual concrete plans.
Who better to take a chance on than the people known for their stable economy, beautiful nature, and commitment to queue etiquette? I'm like a slightly unhinged, low-budget version of an economic migrant; except I work remotely in educational technology, so at least I won't starve.

My Personality and Offerings
I often get compared to your own Princess Märtha Louise [in the way that] I'm a little strange, generally delightful, and occasionally accidentally hilarious. I have intense interests and am fiercely loyal.

As an autistic foreign woman, I bring my own unofficial exemption to Janteloven. You won't have to worry about me thinking I'm better than you; I'll just be asking a lot of very direct questions about things like optimal skibindinger and how much coffee is too much. 

What I bring to the Kos:
I am committed to learning proper Norwegian grammar (currently at ""tusen takk"" level)
I will appreciate the beautiful silence of a good tur
I can create a powerful atmosphere of kos and will never judge your five-year-old anorak or the fact that you packed a plain cheese matpakke for the third day in a row
I work remotely, so I can support myself while I figure out how Norwegian bureaucracy works.

The Norwegian ""Seduction"" Plan
Based on my extensive research, I know what I need to do to woo a Norwegian mate [I think]. Please review my proposed steps and let me know if they pass the fjord test:

♡ The Matpakke Mastery: I will prepare you a perfectly wrapped, multi-layered, practical, and highly efficient packed lunch for your next day of work or hiking.
♡ The Quiet Coffee Date: I propose a first date that involves a thermos of strong coffee, a freshly baked skillingsbolle, and a lot of comfortable silence while we look at something moderately scenic.
♡The Advanced Gesture (The Bread): When things get serious, I will bake you a hearty, wholesome brød that is suitable for slicing and sharing.

Wanted
A man who:
Is moderately good at navigating mountains, fjords, and the grocery store on a Saturday
Will appreciate my intense, chaotic mental gymnastics and balance it with sensible practicality
Does not mind me needing a moment of silence to process my intense interests
Is willing to help me understand why everything closes at 4 PM on Saturdays
Bonus points: Owns a nice blanket or a cabin (I accept both)

Takk for at du leste. 
Send me a message and tell me about the best matpakke you've ever eaten; or your best advice for someone moving to Norway with more enthusiasm than actual planning.",0,1760628414.0,Norway,28,0.35,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I listened to other songs and saw their 2019 (where they really sounded good and energetic especially rose) .when i saw there born pink tour and after their activities outside YG I realized how mess of a group this is and then I stopped listening to them . I didn't even heard about them for more than a year until their solo activity this year. rose- I liked APT(I generally do not watch reels and shorts so I listen it only when I want to), toxic till the end, drinks and coffee but after no.1 girl and one or two songs I couldn't bring myself to listen to the album. It was just bland and boring. rating-5/10

jennie- I liked filter, seoul city, love hangover, mantra (for how bad it is 😭)and some parts of other songs. ruby was good album with variety of different songs but her voice and autotune ruined a lot of good songs like start a war, way up, zen (with its bad lyrics otherwise it would be a bop). 6/10

lisa-  I really liked new woman, chill, lifestyle, thunder, song with tyla and doja's part in born again. Other songs were just okayish to bad, almost every song had same lyrics and beats but her all songs had excellent production. 4/10

jisoo- at first listen whole EP was just okayish but with time your love and tears grew on me and little bit hugs and kisses. Idk how much she was involved in writing but lyrics really sounded like her and had very simple and some cringe words that even a 12 year old could write😂. 7/10

real problem with BP is that it doesn't have any goal all members are just bored of being together and with the new release this group is just dead. BP's one of the biggest strength was their simple and catchy choreo and now even that is destroyed with jump. In the past even a musical abomination like Pink venom and KTL had good choreo. during their debut they had good synchronization and even used to do difficult choreo like whistle PWF, Whistle, AIIYL, DKWTD (which are their only good songs). It's just that fame came to the very soon and easily. Out of all rose disappointed the most now she is the 2nd most cringe member after lisa, jennie is just another rich person with no interest in talent, Jisoo is just trying everything to stay relevant. Finally lisa, tbh I feel bad for her becuz imagine being almost a kid in a foreign country forced to speak laguage you don't know and your even english is not that good and people around you making feel insecure about your look from childhood including her mom, I mean no sane ASIAN mom would let her daughter perform at place like crazy horse. I really liked her lili film especially #4, she had natural talent for dance but now she only does weird lackluster choreos with no desire.

1o89511,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1o89511/am_i_overly_sensitive_or_is_this_friendship_close/,Am I overly sensitive or is this friendship close to an end?,"So I have/had this long-time friend from primary school - we're both 24 y.o. We were really close in primary school, then we went to different high schools and we weren't in touch for some time properly, only there and there. Around 2021 we got into talking again and spent more time together, mainly because we graduated.

I remember how we used to do vacations together, sleepovers, going for a coffee and these kind of things at least once in 2 months. We would message each other often as well. However something started to change I think 1.5-2 years ago? We would hang out, travel and all that, but whenever I'd share something random that happened to me she'd leave me on read and I feel like it started to be more and more apparent with time. One time we were even supposed to hang out that day, but I shared something random in a few messages - she didn't respond and then ask me where I was? Which kinda pissed me off. So at that time I had a talk with her that that's enough and I expect her to try to give me back the same effort as I give to her, because she'd tell me she didn't know what to say to my venting.

Around that time I also noticed that she didn't like me venting about guys and honestly I never really shared much about my dating life because she never dated anyone yet, which is fine, but each time I felt that ""block"" that she doesn't want to talk about guys because she has no experience. One time I told her I started to listen to the same music genre as my crush at that time and I basically got scolded by her that I don't have my own music taste, that I'm copying him, which wasn't true - I just enjoyed the music he sent to me and there's nothing wrong with that.

And I did suggest her to try out Tinder for fun, she'd tell me she would and that I'd take nice pics of her, which I did several times (and honestly she is very pretty as well) but in the end she told me it's still not good enough and never proceed.

And so, around 8 months ago we started to talk about finding an apartment together - she wanted to move to the capital city (I already live here, but she wanted to because of her future internships). Me and my bf + flatmate we were also thinking about finding something better than what we had at that time. So she accepted and we were really excited. In the end it didn't work out, we had different ""views"" on what we want from an apartment - she wanted something more fancy, which surprised me because she is still a student, so instead she was looking for a flatshare on her own, which i think all these arguments during apartment hunting we had were one of the last reasons why this friendship will end probably..

Ever since I can remember she'd tell me she does feel insecure with her image and she'd often times shop clothes and whatnot, but now ever since she moved I can see it more and more. :( She'd have hair extentions and procedures that her parents would contribute to financially even if I'd tell her she looks pretty even without them. Then after 2 months she'd have hair extensions and other things removed because she's still a student and doesn't have enough of money for that stuff. Even when it comes to dining, often times we wouldn't agree on where to eat.

I also started to notice that during the last year she'd even irl mostly talk about herself, talk about cleaning properly and scolding her flatmates for not taking the trash out once, it felt to me like small things. One of the last times we saw each other we'd spend 2 hours together and when I left it felt like she mostly did the talk and i didnt really have many moments to share something myself, it was really weird. And stuff that I showed her - like the apartment where I and my bf lives now she didn't even remember how it looked like and asked if we have carpets and when I said that we do, she didn't say anything but she looked a bit disgusted/meh about it.. Though she did suggest during summer we could go to the gym together for example, maybe I could have invited her as well, I do kinda regret that.

But overall it really felt like her standards were off the roof now.

And the last drop was when 2 months ago my grandma got sick and got hospitalized, and I told her and she'd ask me for an update once, that hopefully she will make it and other supportive things, that hopefully her IV will do wonders for her etc. - I responded a few things, that she is bedbound and that it's not looking great and she left me on read, ever since then, nothing. And more things happened - my grandma didn't make it and other complications with my mom and stuff like that and she still doesn't know about it till this day.

I thought that maybe she has her own issues as I do, but 2 weeks back she posted on her IG story photos from her trip with another friend and now once a week she posts a different profile picture (she never did that), I think that's because she is never really happy with the current ones and honestly I'm pissed off. I thought she'd maybe reach out but nope.

In a few weeks we're supposed to go to a concert together - I have her ticket and it's gonna be really interesting, I don't know if I'm being overly sensitive but I think that she is rude and idk if I want someone like her in my friend circle anymore. It sucks because she used to be the closest friend, but now I'm quite disgusted.

My biggest issue with this is that I was her ""willow"", an open ear, but now when I had tough time she never reached out back to me and I honestly don't have the mood to go back to someone like her after being left on read with ""hey, oh so my last 3 months were terrible, hows its going with you""",1,1760628317.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

There’s nothing stating the base is entirely cracked with pieces of plastic all over the bottom of the postage box, the glass container holding water has a minor crack which I believe is mostly cosmetic and doesn’t leak ( not 100% sure) and the milk container connected has cracked so it doesn’t take milk from the container .

OCTOBER 12, 1985:

Dog carcass in alley this morning. Tire tread on burst stomach. The city is afraid of me. I have seen it's true face. The streets are extended gutters and the gutters are full of blood and when the drains finally scab over all the vermin will drown. The accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up about their waists and and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout ""save us!""...

They had a choice, all of them. They could have followed in the footsteps of good men like my father, or president Truman. Decent men who believed in a day's work for a day's pay. Instead they followed the droppings of lechers and communists and didn't realize that the trail led over a precipe until it was too late. Don't tell me they didn't have a choice. Now the whole world stands on the brink, staring down into bloody Hell, all those liberals and intellectuals and smooth talkers...and all of a sudden nobody can think of anything to say.

OCTOBER 13, 1985

Slept all day. Awoken at 4:37. Landlady complaining about smell. She has five children by five different fathers. I am sure she cheats on welfare. Soon it will be dark. Beneath me, this awful city, it screams like an abattoir full of retarded children. New York. On Friday night, a comedian died in New York. Somebody knows why. Down there...somebody knows. The dusk reeks of fornication and bad consciences. I believe I shall take my exercise.

OCTOBER 13, 1985. 8:30 P.M.:

Meeting with Veidt left bad taste in mouth. He is pampered and decadent, betraying even his shallow, liberal affections. Possibly homosexual? Must remember to investigate further. Dreiberg as bad. A flabby failure who sits whimpering in his basement. Why are so few of us left active, healthy, and without personality disorders? The first Nite Owl runs an auto repair shop. The first Silk Spectre is a bloated, aging whore, dying in a Californian rest resort. Captain Metropolis was decapitated in a car crash back in '74. Mothman's in an asylum up in Maine. The Silhouette retired in disgrace, murdered six weeks later by a minor adversary seeking revenge. Dollar Bill got shot. Hooded Justice went missing in '55. The Comedian is dead. Only two names remaining on my list. Both share private quarters at Rockefeller Military Research Center. I shall go to them. I shall go and tell the indestrucible man that someone plans to murder him.


OCTOBER 13, 1985. 11:30 P.M:

On Friday night, a comedian died in New York. Someone threw him out a window and when he hit the sidewalk his head was driven up into his stomach. Nobody cares. Nobody cares but me. Are they right? Is it futile? Soon there will be war. Millions will burn. Millions will perish in sickness and misery. Why does one death matter against so many? Because there is good and there is evil, and evil must be punished. Even in the face of Armageddon I shall not compromise in this. But there are so many deserving of retribution...and there is so little time.

OCTOBER 16, 1985

42nd Street: Womens breasts draped across every billboard, every display, littering the sidewalk. Was offered Swedish love and French love...but not American love. American love; like Coke in green glass bottles...they don't make it anymore. Thought about Moloch's story on way to cemetery. Could all be lies. Could all be part of a revenge scheme, planned during his decade behind bars. But if true, then what? Puzzling reference to an island. Also to Dr. Manhattan. Might he be at risk in some way? So many questions. Never mind. Answers soon. Nothing is insoluble. Nothing is hopeless. Not while there's life. In the cemetery, all the white crosses stood in rows, neat chalk marks on a giant scoreboard. Paid last respects quietly, without fuss. Edward Morgan Blake. Born in 1924. Forty-five years a comedian. Died 1985, buried in the rain. Is that what happens to us? A life of conflict with no time for friends...so that when it's done, only our enemies leave roses. Violent lives, ending violently. Dollar Bill , The Silhouette, Captain Metropolis...we never die in bed. Not allowed. Something in our personalities, perhaps? Some animal urge to fight and struggle, making us what we are? Unimportant. We do what we have to do. Blake understood. Treated it like a joke, but he understood. He saw the cracks in society, saw the little men in masks trying to hold it together...he saw the true face of the twentieth century and chose to become a reflection of it, a parody of it. No one else saw the joke. That's why he was lonely. Heard joke once: Man goes into doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says ""Treatmen is simple. Great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up."" Man bursts into tears. Says ""But, Doctor...I am Pagliacci."" Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains.

Left Jacobi's house at 2:35 A.M. He knows nothing about any attempt to discredit Dr. Manhattan. He has simply been used. By whom? Russians seem obvious choice: Manhattan and Comedian both key military figures. But Comedian referred to an island. Artists and writers living on it. Doesn't fit. Can't concentrate. Too tired. No sleep since Saturday. Walked home past trashcans stuffed with rumors od war, weighing factors-bodies, motives...waiting for a flash of enlightenment in all this blood and thunder.

OCTOBER 21, 1985

Woken at eleven by shouting. Disturbed to find I had fallen asleep without removing the skin from my head. Tireder than I thought. Should be more careful. Across street, boy's were defacing abandoned building. Memorized their descriptions then prepared for work. First, peeled off face, folded it inside jacket. Without my face, nobody knows. Nobody knows who I am. On way out of room met landlady. Usual complaints Re: Hygiene and Rent. There were purple bite marks on her fat white neck. Fresh ones. Out in street, inspected defaced building: silhouette picture in doorway, man and woman, possibly engaging in sexual foreplay. Didn't like it. Makes doorway look haunted. On Fortieth and Seventh, saw Dreiberg and Juspeczyk leaving diner. They didn't know me. An affair, perhaps? Did Juspeczyk engineer Dr. Manhattan's exhile to make room for Dreiberg? Also, she hated the Comedian. Must investigate further. Entering diner, bought coffee, then sat watching my maildrop, immediately across the street. Passer's by made various deposits: candy wrappers, newspapers. This city is an animal, fierce and complicated. To understand it I read it's droppings, it's scents, the movement of it's parasites...I sat watching the trashcan and New York opened it's heart to me.

OCTOBER 21, 1985:

Someone tried to kill Veidt. Prove's Mask Killer theory. Murderer is closing in. Checked maildrop. Message from Moloch. Connected, perhaps? Next, went to retrieve face from allet. Outside Utopia, police restrained a youth on KT-28's. He was screaming something about bombs. Is everyone but me going mad? Over 40th Street, and elephant was drifting. Beyond that, unseen, spy satellites. If they so much as narrow their glass eyes, we shall all be dead. This relentless world: there is only one sane response to it. The alleyway was cold and deserted. My things were where I'd left them. Waiting for me. Putting them on, I abandoned my disguise and became myself, free from fear or weakness or lust. My coat, my shoes, my spotless gloves. My face. Had three hours before calling on Moloch. Away down alley, heard woman scream., first bubbling note of city's evening chorus. Approached disturbance. An attempted rape/mugging/both. Cleared throat. The man turned and there was something rewarding in his eyes. Sometimes, the night is generous to me.

NOVEMBER 1, 1985:

Final entry? Left Veidt's office just before Midnight. Dreiberg, convinced Veidt's behind everything, is serious about visiting Antarctica. Owlship capable, apparently, but are we? Veidt. Cannot imagine more dangerous opponent. Assuming journey possible, tracking him to his lair only option. Still feel uneasy. Unfamiliar territory. He could kill us both, there in the snow. Nobody would ever know...first night in November. I am cold tonight. Offices below, headstones marking daily graves of thousands. Inside, clock faces, as observed as those of celebrities, hands commence final laps. Oblivion gallops closer, favoring the spur, sparing the rein...I think we will be gone soon. Veidt is faster than Dreiberg. Perhaps faster than me. Return seems unlikely. This last entry. Will shortly mail to only people can trust. Tell Dreiberg I need to check my maildrop. He believes me. If reading this now, whether I am alive or dead, you will know truth. Whatever the precise nature of this conspiracy, Adrian Veidt responsible. Have done best to make this legible. Believe it paints a disturbing picture. Appreciate your recent support and hope world survives long enough for this to reach you. But tanks are in East Berlin and writing is on wall. For my own part, regret nothing. Have lived life, free from compromise...and step into the shadow now without complaint.

1o892ja,https://i.redd.it/pvylmijgrhvf1.jpeg,Amy’s Diary — Thursday: Coffee Day at School!,"This morning, when I arrived at school, everyone was already talking about the same thing —

> “Coffee Day is coming here!”



At first, I thought it was a rumor. But then during assembly, our principal actually announced it:
“Students, we’re happy to welcome Coffee Day Café as our official School Festival partner. They’ll be setting up a mini booth on campus starting today!”

The whole hall exploded in excitement! Penny almost screamed. “Zoe’s coming here?!”
And Kira clapped like she was at a concert.

After class, we ran straight to the courtyard — and there they were!
Zoe, Ayaka, Haruka, Charlotte, Li Mei, Anastasia, Madison, and Minji — all wearing their signature Coffee Day black cropped uniforms with the café’s golden logo. Even Mr. Tanaka was there in his smart blazer, helping arrange the booth decorations.

Zoe smiled at the crowd and waved. “Hello everyone! We’re here to help you all prepare for your upcoming festival! Let’s brew something amazing together!”

The cheers got so loud, I swear you could hear it from the next block.

They started setting up cute tables with banners that said “Life Begins After Coffee”, and the air smelled like roasted beans and caramel cream. Haruka was in charge of the demonstration, showing how to make latte art, while Ayaka handled the cash register training — “Just in case your festival café needs it!”

We got to take turns practicing! Penny was surprisingly good at drawing hearts with foam.
Kira… spilled hers. Twice.
I tried making a swirl but it somehow looked like a snail. Zoe laughed kindly and said, “Art is all about interpretation, Amy.”

Then Monique, Siu Ling, and Carmen showed up from their classes to watch. Carmen whispered, “You know, they should open a Coffee Day Academy here.”
Siu Ling nodded. “I’d enroll immediately.”

Later, Zoe announced a surprise challenge:

> “Alright, students! Let’s see your teamwork! Each group must create your own mini café booth concept in 20 minutes!”



It became chaotic but fun — glitter, markers, paper cups flying everywhere.
Winfrey’s group called theirs Digital Brew Café with a Navel theme.
Monique’s group made a Mud Queen Paint Latte Bar (with colorful toppings).
And ours? We named it SisterBean Café — “Where friendship never cheats.”

When Zoe came to judge, she laughed so hard at the slogans that she actually took photos of every booth for her café’s page.
“Everyone here has such creativity,” she said. “Maybe we’ll see you all at Coffee Day one day.”

By the end of the day, the whole school was buzzing again — not from caffeine, but from excitement. Even teachers joined in tasting the samples (and Mrs. Bloom accidentally got latte foam on her nose, which made everyone giggle).

After school, as we cleaned up, Penny whispered, “Amy, I think I just found my dream job.”
“Being a barista?” I asked.
She grinned. “Being one of Zoe’s Coffee Queens.”

We all laughed so hard that even Zoe waved goodbye with a smile from across the courtyard.

And as I walked home, the air still smelled faintly of coffee and caramel.

1o891pp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1o891pp/am_i_overly_sensitive_or_is_this_friendship_close/,Am I overly sensitive or is this friendship close to an end?,"So I have/had this long-time friend from primary school - we're both 24 y.o. We were really close in primary school, then we went to different high schools and we weren't in touch for some time properly, only there and there. Around 2021 we got into talking again and spent more time together, mainly because we graduated.

I remember how we used to do vacations together, sleepovers, going for a coffee and these kind of things at least once in 2 months. We would message each other often as well. However something started to change I think 1.5-2 years ago? We would hang out, travel and all that, but whenever I'd share something random that happened to me she'd leave me on read and I feel like it started to be more and more apparent with time. One time we were even supposed to hang out that day, but I shared something random in a few messages - she didn't respond and then ask me where I was? Which kinda pissed me off. So at that time I had a talk with her that that's enough and I expect her to try to give me back the same effort as I give to her, because she'd tell me she didn't know what to say to my venting.

Around that time I also noticed that she didn't like me venting about guys and honestly I never really shared much about my dating life because she never dated anyone yet, which is fine, but each time I felt that ""block"" that she doesn't want to talk about guys because she has no experience. One time I told her I started to listen to the same music genre as my crush at that time and I basically got scolded by her that I don't have my own music taste, that I'm copying him, which wasn't true - I just enjoyed the music he sent to me and there's nothing wrong with that.

And I did suggest her to try out Tinder for fun, she'd tell me she would and that I'd take nice pics of her, which I did several times (and honestly she is very pretty as well) but in the end she told me it's still not good enough and never proceed.

And so, around 8 months ago we started to talk about finding an apartment together - she wanted to move to the capital city (I already live here, but she wanted to because of her future internships). Me and my bf + flatmate we were also thinking about finding something better than what we had at that time. So she accepted and we were really excited. In the end it didn't work out, we had different ""views"" on what we want from an apartment - she wanted something more fancy, which surprised me because she is still a student, so instead she was looking for a flatshare on her own, which i think all these arguments during apartment hunting we had were one of the last reasons why this friendship will end probably..

Ever since I can remember she'd tell me she does feel insecure with her image and she'd often times shop clothes and whatnot, but now ever since she moved I can see it more and more. :( She'd have hair extentions and procedures that her parents would contribute to financially even if I'd tell her she looks pretty even without them. Then after 2 months she'd have hair extensions and other things removed because she's still a student and doesn't have enough of money for that stuff. Even when it comes to dining, often times we wouldn't agree on where to eat.

I also started to notice that during the last year she'd even irl mostly talk about herself, talk about cleaning properly and scolding her flatmates for not taking the trash out once, it felt to me like small things. One of the last times we saw each other we'd spend 2 hours together and when I left it felt like she mostly did the talk and i didnt really have many moments to share something myself, it was really weird. And stuff that I showed her - like the apartment where I and my bf lives now she didn't even remember how it looked like and asked if we have carpets and when I said that we do, she didn't say anything but she looked a bit disgusted/meh about it.. Though she did suggest during summer we could go to the gym together for example, maybe I could have invited her as well, I do kinda regret that.

But overall it really felt like her standards were off the roof now.

And the last drop was when 2 months ago my grandma got sick and got hospitalized, and I told her and she'd ask me for an update once, that hopefully she will make it and other supportive things, that hopefully her IV will do wonders for her etc. - I responded a few things, that she is bedbound and that it's not looking great and she left me on read, ever since then, nothing. And more things happened - my grandma didn't make it and other complications with my mom and stuff like that and she still doesn't know about it till this day.

I thought that maybe she has her own issues as I do, but 2 weeks back she posted on her IG story photos from her trip with another friend and now once a week she posts a different profile picture (she never did that), I think that's because she is never really happy with the current ones and honestly I'm pissed off. I thought she'd maybe reach out but nope.

In a few weeks we're supposed to go to a concert together - I have her ticket and it's gonna be really interesting, I don't know if I'm being overly sensitive but I think that she is rude and idk if I want someone like her in my friend circle anymore. It sucks because she used to be the closest friend, but now I'm quite disgusted.

My biggest issue with this is that I was her ""willow"", an open ear, but now when I had tough time she never reached out back to me and I honestly don't have the mood to go back to someone like her after being left on read with ""hey, oh so my last 3 months were terrible, hows its going with you""",1,1760628115.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

General takeaways:
- IC card (Suica ICOCA etc) is a must. Just get the app. 
- Go app and Uber: the subways are extremely awesome and cheap but give yourself permission to take a cab sometimes. Go gives the more accurate estimate.
- Baggage forwarding is, next to the toilets and bullet trains, the single most amazing thing about Japan. Single biggest travel hack there. 
- actually the most amazing thing here is the water pressure in the hotels. You could hurt yourself.
- grab some cash at an atm, you will eventually need it. You will also eventually have a huge coin collection in your pocket.
- this is a society that *deeply* values receipts. You will get lots of receipts. This is also the cleanest place I’ve ever been with few to no public trash receptacles. Just breathe and accept it. 
- Nakasendo trail: the instagram effect is real. Tourists mushed together taking endless selfies. I enjoyed the hike more than the Disneyesque feel of Tsumago and Magome. Parts of it are neat for a fleeting moment but it actually crosses the main highway a lot. It’s not that immersive.
- Kyoto: loved the Fushimi Inari shrine, hated Pontocho alley, appalled at the cosplaying wypipo in Gion. I wld come back for the historical stuff I didn’t get to and use it as a base for cool day trips. 
- great coffee culture in the major cities. 
- airport’s not bad for souvenirs. Maybe worth the price difference for the convenience of not hauling junk around. Exception is gift shops for shrines and castles for unique stuff or the basements of fancy department stores for high-end treats.

Specific shoutouts:
- favorite place I stayed the whole trip was a ryokan at the start of the hike near Kiso. Nukumorino-yado Komanoyu. Found it on booking.com. Huge room, amazing onsen, breakfast and elaborate kaiseke dinner included. I want to come back in the dead of winter and rusticate here. 
- Zenkoji temple in Nagano: thoroughly authentic and neat. You enter a completely dark underground passage and try to find a metal handle to grasp which ensures entry into heaven or something. I found it, my friend didn’t. A highly spiritual haunted house experience. Also great food stalls here with local delicacies. I bought my buddy an apple turnover to make up for his afterlife situation. 
-  two places in Kyoto that stuck out: a French bakery called Croix Rousse. Legit baguette that almost made me cry. Ice cream place called Japanese Ice Ouca. Inside looks like a fancy ice cream shop on Tatooine. Only Japanese flavors (sweet potato, hojicha, etc). Order comes with a sprinkling of salty seaweed on the side, which I swear totally works. There’s one in Tokyo too.  
- Fushimi Inari shrine: there’s sort of a side trail early on that goes all the way to the top. I took it out of desperation bc of all the people but it was a lovely hike through a bamboo forest and then tons of smaller shrines. The last bit is steep for 20 minutes but then a quick trip to the main shrine. Easier to me than going up a bunch of steps with a million people. Wouldn’t do that at night though.

It's has been very effective but I'm always looking to optimize and wonder if oura might have some sleep enhancing features I'm missing out on. I also like the idea of having my wrist free, I like that oura goes on the finger.   
  
Oura users I want to hear from you or if anyone has used both I'd love that feedback.

# Environment

**Here’s my setup now:**

* **Essentia mattress (non-toxic memory foam)** — no chemical off-gassing or heat buildup.
* **Chili Sleep cooling pad**: each side has its own temperature control. It’s cheaper than cooling the whole house, and even a 1–2°F drop in core body temp triggers drowsiness.
* **Room temperature**: drops to \~70°F about 30 minutes before bed. Research shows your core temperature naturally falls as you approach sleep — so I “assist” it.
* **Air quality**: I crack a window or sliding door to release and prevent CO₂ buildup and use an AirDoctor purifier for particulates. Poor air quality elevates resting heart rate and decreases deep sleep.
* **Sound and light**: I use [Brain.fm](https://brain.fm/) — their AI-generated functional music increases delta brainwave activity (the frequency range of slow wave sleep). And an insanely comfortable [contoured sleep mask](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KC5DWCC) blocks light completely without pressing on my eyelids.

One important: **I only use my bed for sleep and sex.**  
No reading, no scrolling, no work. My body now associates the bed with shutting down. It’s pavlovian conditioning and it works.

# Light Exposure

As you probably know light is the master controller of circadian rhythm. Every cell in your body runs on a 24-hour clock, and light — especially through your eyes — tells your brain what time it is.

**My rhythm:**

* **Wake up:** 5:10 AM (±10 minutes). I get bright artificial light for 3–4 minutes immediately. Usually from my bathroom light but I'm considering getting a sun lamp as well. Then I drink water to rehydrate.
* **Bedtime:** 8:10 PM. On weekends, I try to stretch it by no more than an hour. I try to keep the schedule consistent
* **Evening light:** At 7:30 PM, a red “sunset” bulb turns on automatically — this mimics low solar angle light and signals to my brain (via the suprachiasmatic nucleus) that it’s time to wind down. I got the bulb from bon charge.

Then I put on blue-light-blocking glasses and my phone automatically switches to black and white mode. Those cues reduce dopamine stimulation from screens, making it easier to transition into sleepiness.

**Why this matters:**  
Light viewed in the first 30–60 minutes after waking triggers a cortisol pulse that sets your internal timer for sleep \~16 hours later. Conversely, light after 10 PM can *delay* your circadian clock — even a few minutes of bright light can shift your rhythm by an hour.

# Mindset & Stress

A misconception about sleep is that you can just “turn your brain off.” But if your nervous system is still in sympathetic mode (fight or flight), good luck. You can create a more relaxed brain state but it takes practice.

Letting go of control  
Also paradoxically I became obsessed with the system and process of setting up for a good night of sleep but completely detached from the outcome. I don't stress myself out with the thought of trying to sleep well. If I don't sleep well it's all good, it doesn't matter, all I can do is prepare my body I can't control the outcome. This creates the relaxation needed for sleep.

Here’s what I do to intentionally switch into chill mode also known as parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) mode:

* **Meditation every morning**: it trains my mind to notice thoughts without reacting. Over time, this carries into bedtime — I can feel my body relax when I notice myself tensing. I also don't have to ruminate or chase thoughts they are nothing but events flitting about the mind no action is needed on them.
* **Gratitude journaling in the evening**: I reflect on 2–3 positive things before bed to create a more calm and joyful mind state
* **Reading** — calm input before rest. To be 100% transparent I also usually watch TV while cuddling with my wife before bed while wearing blue light blocking glasses. This routine is relaxing.
* **Topical magnesium spray** on the neck along the vagus nerve and wrists: magnesium helps regulate GABA, the neurotransmitter that calms the nervous system. I apply it where absorption is fastest (veins close to skin).
* **Breathwork and cold exposure**: these rewire my stress response. Breath training protocols help me to lower heart rate quickly and enter relaxation a skill that directly translates to falling asleep faster.

The ability to deliberately turn off alertness is a superpower.

# Exercise

I love lifting in the morning for about 50 minutes followed by 10 minutes in the sauna. It is energizing to get the blood flowing early.

Weekends are for outdoor play: pickleball, hiking, surfing, volleyball — all great for light exposure and mental reset.

One rule I follow: **no hard training within 4 hours of bedtime.**  
Late-night workouts raise body temp and adrenaline. It’s like hitting the gas before parking the car, you won’t fall asleep easily and you'll put extra strain on the system.

# Diet, Hydration, and Alcohol

I knew what I ate affects my sleep, but when I eat matters just as much.

I eat my **last meal around 5 PM**, at least three hours before bed. Digestion raises body temperature, which delays melatonin release. I also stop drinking water by 4 PM so that I don't get up to pee at night. I still make sure to drink at least 64 oz.

Caffeine?  
About once every two weeks. I like the brain and health benefits but don't want to become dependent. I want my natural energy to tell me the truth about my recovery. When I feel tired, I don’t reach for coffee to mask the tiredness, I try fix the root cause by taking a nap... and I take note of what I did the day before so that I can avoid low energy in the future. However, some days it doesn't matter if I have low energy so I don't obsess. I.e. if I'm on vacation I don't worry to much if the battery isn't topped off. There is a balance to striving for good habits and being flexible.

Alcohol  
I mostly avoid it, I drink maybe twice a month. Alcohol fragments sleep and suppresses REM. When I do drink, I try to stick to daytime and use **ZBiotics and NAD+** to support help my body process the booze and lessen its impact. (Fun fact: NAD levels drop with age, and lower NAD makes it harder for the body to process alcohol, and is linked to poor cellular repair not ideal for recovery.)

Interesting note, when I was in Italy, wine with dinner didn’t wreck my sleep like it does in the U.S. This is likely caused by difference in food regulation. The FDA is comically lax with what they allow companies to put in our food and drink when compared to Europe.

# Tracking & Data

I’ve worn a WHOOP band for about five years. It tracks HRV (heart rate variability), resting heart rate, respiratory rate, and sleep performance. Before this I used the ""sleep as android"" phone app to track my sleep. There are plenty of trackers that can monitor sleep and recovery.

HRV is the hidden gem metric. It measures the time variation between heartbeats while you’re asleep — higher variability means your nervous system is flexible and balanced.

When my HRV trends upward and my resting heart rate trends down, I know I’m recovering well. I try to create as large a gap as possible between resting heart rate and HRV. When HRV dips, it’s usually because I broke a rule — heavy meal too late, alcohol too close to bed, or screen time at night.

WHOOP also measures sleep efficiency (time asleep vs time in bed) and consistency (how regular your sleep schedule is).

Patterns emerged fast. Once I saw the data visualized, I stopped arguing with reality.

My biggest sleep score boosters:

* Limiting alcohol
* Eating 3+ hours before bed
* Going to bed and waking at the same time
* Meditation
* Blue-light blocking glasses

I also have a list of 20+ habits that I document daily so I know what effects my sleep. For example each day I will track how long I exercised, morning light exposure, did I eat processed food, time of eating, how stressed was I, am I injured, hydration, etc. This is correlated with how rested I was the next morning so I know what to avoid and what do keep doing. I have eliminated my sleep disruptors.

You can use a tool like [Sleep blueprint](https://admin.typeform.com/form/qoMSWstN/create?block=ed28f323-6322-438d-b623-87883fe7e60e) to uncover your biggest sleep disruptors and get a personalized plan to fix them. It costs money though and you could probably find the same information for free online if you poked around enough for a sleep hygiene quiz or something similar.

# Outcome

Before optimizing these factors, my sleep quality felt random. Now, I can predict how I’ll sleep based on the day’s habits and how my body feels... and I can plan around it.

If I have a big presentation or long day ahead, I know how to guarantee deep, restorative sleep the night before. If I want to stay out late with friends, I can build recovery on both sides so it barely dents me.

Sleep is the foundation that holds everything else together — workouts, discipline, mood, creativity. It’s the ultimate leverage point.

Eating correctly and exercising are pointless without good sleep. Sleeping well makes it easier to do every other health habit because it gives you will power and motivation. For that same reason it is essential to reaching my goals and pursuing my life’s purpose. Without proper energy everything is harder. I can either experience the pain of discipline to dial in my sleep or the pain of regret of a life wasted or even a mediocre life where I drift through mindlessly following the status quo.

And I’ve found that to be true. With consistent, restorative sleep, I wake up motivated with deep reserves of will power.

If your sleep feels inconsistent, the best place to start isn’t another supplement or gadget — it’s figuring out what’s actually disrupting it. Find out what specific things for you are creating issues. I've found generic advice to be annoying, I'd rather know what is bothering me specifically and then only fix those things.

Nothing better than laying in bed and knowing a great night of sleep is inevitable.

# TL;DR

Treat sleep like a skill.

* Build a cool, dark, clean environment.
* Expose your eyes to light early, and protect them from blue light late.
* Teach your nervous system to downshift.
* Time food, exercise, and stress intentionally.
* Track and adjust.

What do ya'll think would it be easier to track and improve these factors over time with oura.",2,1760628018.0,ouraring,0,1.0,False

1o88zol,https://www.reddit.com/r/weyler/comments/1o88zol/tyler_challenges_wednesdays_intellect/,Tyler challenges Wednesday’s intellect,"“You think you’re the smartest person in the room” - said by  Tyler in part 1 and Weems in part 2.

Season 1 - Tyler was obviously the Hyde, she was too busy starring at his pecs to see the self inflicted wound which was so obvious amongst so many other signs. This is why Wednesday tortures him in season 1, gives that speech at willow hill in season 2, her pride was so hurt and she like Jenna said was trying to prove that she was above it, that she was superior to him “ I don’t need to visit anymore” “ I take enough space in your twisted head” “subpar barista” “ school yard bully” “generic looks” - all contradictory with the fact that she found him attractive, she walked to kiss him, she went to his cafe every day to drink his coffee, told him she wasn’t going to judge him over a silly prank and would have taken it further. Was actually just as obsessed with him as he is with her - she legit filled the paperwork with the court and didn’t leave a box unticked, her paperwork to see him was so perfect she got complimented on it cause she wanted to make sure everything was right and got her visitation rights approved so early.

Wednesday believes that she is above everyone else, that she is smarter, she believes that  unlike the others, her plans aren’t based on emotions, that she is detached and has moved on.

Season 2 - However, when it comes to Tyler, not a single decision she has made has been rational, objective or even appropriate. Visiting him at willow hill to help with the investigation made no sense, he was locked up and going crazy, she just wanted to see him, she filled the paperwork weeks in advance but was too embarrassed to come in without a “good enough” reason. She legit wasted her time and Enid’s chance to get her license by driving like a maniac just to see him.

Everyone also advised her against trying to become his master, again she endangers Enid (like what if Tyler didn’t listen to her when she said “enough”). Her plan was nothing short of a dream, no way anyone believed it will work like she just wanted to save his life and link them together, as if her tiny needle filled with some random concoction she made on her first try without testing it will actually work….. again acting based on her feelings.

Then with the axe scene, Tyler himself asked her to kill him and fully expected her to go with it. She just couldn’t, she again saved him (before her brother) and he was as shocked as we are, cause girl wtf!! If anything I believe that season 3 might not just explore Wednesday’s feelings but Tyler’s too and the teaser definitely highlights that their arcs are going to be linked with both coming to terms with what happened between them.


Like Wednesday is either stupid or has feelings for him ranging from hate, to fear, with concern and love buried underneath it all like Weems said. I refuse to believe Wednesday is an idiot so she gotta like him still, no other explanation is needed.",14,1760627988.0,weyler,3,1.0,False

sorry for how long its taking to get it out for those interested but the final part is coming very soon!:

**Part 5:** 

  
Iain was slumping in his chair, exhausted and distressed. Silently, Nordale poured more

coffee and pushed the mug towards him. “Can I… do you need anything else?” Nordale

questioned gently. He had no idea what could be the cause or origin of the events O’Donnell

was describing, but this account wasn’t the strangest he had ever heard, by a long way –

and, looking at the traumatized man hunched over before him in the wheelchair, Nordale had

no doubt of his absolute sincerity.

Iain exhaled, a deep, shuddering sigh of breath, then continued:



Before we knew what was happening, Alastair was on his feet, screaming, throwing the husk

of… what had been our friend… to one side. Then he ran off into the trees. He didn’t seem

to be heading in any direction – just ran, crashing through branches, cannoning off trees,

leaving a thick plume of dust swirling in the air behind him. We ran after him – there was no

discussion of it, there just seemed to be no choice, really.

With no time to grieve or even think, Richard and I tried to catch up with Alastair. We were

fearful of what could happen to him – what dangers were out there – and after all, he was

only there because of us. Or me, really. We were all there because of me…

It was Richard, finally, who drew close enough to rugby-tackle Alastair to the ground.

“Calm down! Snap out of it!” he ordered. “You’re going to get us all killed: we need to work

together if we’re going to get out of this,” he stated.

Alastair, wild-eyed and terrified, was still trying to shake him off, but abruptly seemed to

realise that he was still covered in dust; his panic shifted from Richard to ineffectually wiping

off the corpse-dust from his clothes and skin, scratching his face in his frantic efforts to wipe

the dust from his mouth and eyes.

“Oh, God, it’s death! This dust is dead things!” he shrieked. “I’m clarted in dead…things!”

Alastair was hauling at his clothes, tearing off his jacket and t-shirt.

Richard reached into his backpack, pulled out a bottle of water and gently, soothing Alastair

as a mother would her child, started to wipe the dust from his face. “Ok… I’ve got you… it’s

going to be fine, you’ll be ok…”

By the time we had finally calmed him down enough for him to change into clean clothes –

mine, as he had lost his gear in his panicked flight – we had lost the last of the light.



Far off the planned route and with map and compass back in a distant clearing with the

remains of our friend, we had no choice but to hurriedly pitch a single tent. Two would sleep

– or attempt to – whilst one kept guard. Though for what we didn’t know.

For about an hour, I sat in the silence. No night noises. No creatures. No stars. No sound of

river or breeze in the tree-tops.

Richard emerged from the tent. “Finally got the lad asleep,” he stated flatly. He stared at me

through narrowed eyes. “Iain. You just led us back there, didn’t you?”

“How can you even suggest that?” I hissed, furious, but unwilling to rouse Alastair. “We

simply got lost!”

Richard stared at me impassively. “I hope you’re not lying – because we all have to live with

the results of our actions, however good or evil.” With that, he headed back to the tent,

leaving me to the profound silence.

I stayed on watch, as I had started. In fact, I wasn’t planning on waking either of them.

Alastair was in no state… and Richard? Letting him rest was the least I could do. If it weren’t

for me, he would be off fishing or birdwatching, enjoying the beauty of the Dales, or walking

in the Pennines. Not here.

I don’t know when the voices started. If they were voices. But in the darkest hours of the

night, I became aware of a feeling in the air, a movement, like a touch of a breeze, that

gradually solidified into a sound. You know when you strain your ears to hear something?

And you can not discern a single word or syllable, yet you know that the murmuring, the

whispering, is a voice, a voice full of significance and meaning, if you could only know what it

was saying… It scratches at your memory, your thoughts, as if… You could remember. You

could know. But it’s impossible…

“Iain, what are you doing?” Richard abruptly broke in to my thoughts. After how long, I can’t

say. Morning had crawled in, grey and hazy. My limbs were stiff and numb from remaining

motionless, fixed in the same attitude for… I can’t say how long. Had I slept? No. Yet time

had passed.

Richard looked at me shrewdly. “Can you hear that, too?” he demanded.

I looked up at him, but he was staring off in to the distance, his attention focused on the

vanishing point of perspective in the distant woods.

Richard and I looked at each other. “Do we…? I feel like I need to find out what that is,

where it’s coming from,” Richard stated, his expression earnest.

I didn’t argue – I felt that need also. But it was Alastair who moved the decision beyond

discussion – Alastair, who we suddenly realised was already some distance off, the grassy

green of his T-shirt bright against the fungoid grey of the forest.

We stumbled off after him through the forest, every step kicking up plumes of grey dust. With

every step, it seemed as if the voices, whilst still incoherent, became increasingly intense,

insistent, invasive. The noise seemed to take over every sensation and awareness I had,

sending waves of nausea through my head and stomach. Blood was oozing from Richard’s

nose and he looked gaunt, yet fixated on the way ahead. I became aware of blood trickling

from my nose also, the metallic taste seeping in to my mouth. And yet Alastair was still

ahead of us, and still we all ploughed on through dead trees, oblivious to the uneven ground

and the impeding branches in our way.



And as the sounds, the voices, grew in intensity, their noise becoming cacophonous, to my

horror I heard one voice – an inhuman growl – finally giving us distinguishable sounds.

“Go back!”

The words felt as though they had been snarled into my ear – or as if they had been created

inside my ear – and I saw Richard flinch at exactly the same moment, and I knew he had

experienced the same.

“Look what happened to me: go back!” another voice hissed. And I would have sworn that

the voice was Bryan’s, only distorted and somehow sullied, polluted. “Wasn’t my death

enough for you?” the voice continued, only with a cruel inflection that I knew was not my

friend’s voice, but only a mocking parody of it.

It seemed to me by now that the air was constantly torn through by different voices –

mocking, cruel, insidious - all telling us to leave, a demented choir destroying our capacity

for thought. Richard’s face was a grimace of pain, and continuing to follow Alastair was

visibly costing him huge effort. Then, just as Alastair’s broad-shouldered form approached a

denser band of trees, the voice seemed to boom out thunderously, stunning my

consciousness:

“You’ve damned us all!” the voice that was so like Bryan’s condemned me.

Alastair had disappeared and was hidden from our sight. Richard and I ploughed

despairingly after him, and as I fought my way through through the dense band of trees, I

almost fell into the sudden space –

Silence.

The voices had ceased. All three of us were in a small clearing. And in to the blessed silence

in my head crept a gradual awareness of Richard next to me and Alastair, who turned to face

us, his eyes shocked and blank, like a woken sleepwalker. We embraced like long lost

brothers, clinging momentarily to each other, our minds the clearest they had been since

entering the forest.

It was the cool freshness of the air that hit me first. And for the first time in days, I could

inhale air free from the cloying, choking dust. I can’t explain or rationalize it, but within this

clearing, bounded on all sides by a dense wall of trees, all was green and alive, verdantly

beautiful.

And full of false promise.

“What fresh… hell… is this?

A rap at the door had once again interrupted Alastair’s account. The door opened a few

inches and Skinner’s impatient, bony face peered round the door. “Seriously? You’re still on

with this?” he sneered, his vendetta against Nordale overriding his usual appearance of

professionalism in front of members of the public.

Nordale quickly snapped out of his chair and confronted Skinner, using his physical stature

to almost force him back through the doorway. “It would be more quickly concluded,” he

hissed, “without needless interruptions.”

“Why are you giving credence to this….fairy story?” Skinner demanded. “It’s clear that he

murdered them! We just need to know where they are!”



“It’s by no means ‘clear’ that he murdered them!” Nordale snapped. “You have absolutely

nothing that you can charge him with - which is why he isn’t even under caution!” Nordale

failed to keep the note of sarcasm from his voice.

Both were abruptly called back to awareness of Iain, as he wheeled up to the door, his face

dark with venomous anger. “I’ll be going, now. I’m not here to add fuel to your squabbling.

Nor to be accused of fabrications…” And he left, leaving no time for Nordale to convince him

to stay, his departing wheelchair causing even the insensitive Skinner to question the

consequences of his actions…



The following day saw Nordale standing in the rain outside the front door of a well-kept

bungalow. After ringing the bell for a second time, Marie answered. Her face was pale and

drawn, but her dark eyes blazed with grief and fury. She was holding a quietly snarling Alby

by the collar.

“Well?” she demanded, keeping a firm grip on the handle and showing no inclination to invite

him in.

“Er… I came to see Iain. To apologize. I didn’t realise he had company? Er… Marie, is it?”

Silently, she stared at him. Finally, she motioned to Alby to stand down from his protective

role and stepped back to allow Nordale to enter. “I need to warn you: he’s even worse than

yesterday. I’ve moved in to look after him. But at this rate… it won’t be for long,” she

murmured.

“So – you believe him, then.” Nordale stated, bluntly.

“In terms of what happened? I don’t know what to believe. None of it makes sense. But yes. I

believe him. He is telling us what he truly believes happened, beyond any doubt.”

“My chief reckons he killed your husband and son,” he challenged.

“Your chief talks shite!” she snapped back. “Do you honestly think I’d be here if I believed

that for one moment?”

Nordale nodded, slowly. “Yes. I have never doubted that Iain’s account seems in every

respect sincere. However strange it seems.”

“Then you’d best hear him out,” she replied, “while he can still talk.”

She led Nordale into Iain’s study, a cosy room with a blazing fire, a shabby, sagging, much-

loved sofa, and wall-to-wall bookcases. Pictures from earlier fishing trips with David and

Junior jostled for pride of place with photos taken on deployment with Richard and Bryan.

Iain’s worn, but warm, welcoming smile disarmed any tension between him and Nordale.

“I’m really…”

Iain’s gesture stopped him. “No need. We’ve all had bosses who are idiots. I’m glad you’ve

come. Let’s push on, shall we?”

Nordale smiled his thanks and collapsed into the sofa’s cosy embrace, rummaging for his

Dictaphone.

1o88x33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1o88x33/am_i_overly_sensitive_or_is_this_friendship_close/,Am I overly sensitive or is this friendship close to an end?,"So I have/had this long-time friend from primary school - we're both 24 y.o. We were really close in primary school, then we went to different high schools and we weren't in touch for some time properly, only there and there. Around 2021 we got into talking again and spent more time together, mainly because we graduated.

I remember how we used to do vacations together, sleepovers, going for a coffee and these kind of things at least once in 2 months. We would message each other often as well. However something started to change I think 1.5-2 years ago? We would hang out, travel and all that, but whenever I'd share something random that happened to me she'd leave me on read and I feel like it started to be more and more apparent with time. One time we were even supposed to hang out that day, but I shared something random in a few messages - she didn't respond and then ask me where I was? Which kinda pissed me off. So at that time I had a talk with her that that's enough and I expect her to try to give me back the same effort as I give to her, because she'd tell me she didn't know what to say to my venting.

Around that time I also noticed that she didn't like me venting about guys and honestly I never really shared much about my dating life because she never dated anyone yet, which is fine, but each time I felt that ""block"" that she doesn't want to talk about guys because she has no experience. One time I told her I started to listen to the same music genre as my crush at that time and I basically got scolded by her that I don't have my own music taste, that I'm copying him, which wasn't true - I just enjoyed the music he sent to me and there's nothing wrong with that.

And I did suggest her to try out Tinder for fun, she'd tell me she would and that I'd take nice pics of her, which I did several times (and honestly she is very pretty as well) but in the end she told me it's still not good enough and never proceed.

And so, around 8 months ago we started to talk about finding an apartment together - she wanted to move to the capital city (I already live here, but she wanted to because of her future internships). Me and my bf + flatmate we were also thinking about finding something better than what we had at that time. So she accepted and we were really excited. In the end it didn't work out, we had different ""views"" on what we want from an apartment - she wanted something more fancy, which surprised me because she is still a student, so instead she was looking for a flatshare on her own, which i think all these arguments during apartment hunting we had were one of the last reasons why this friendship will end probably..

Ever since I can remember she'd tell me she does feel insecure with her image and she'd often times shop clothes and whatnot, but now ever since she moved I can see it more and more. :( She'd have hair extentions and procedures that her parents would contribute to financially even if I'd tell her she looks pretty even without them. Then after 2 months she'd have hair extensions and other things removed because she's still a student and doesn't have enough of money for that stuff. Even when it comes to dining, often times we wouldn't agree on where to eat.

I also started to notice that during the last year she'd even irl mostly talk about herself, talk about cleaning properly and scolding her flatmates for not taking the trash out once, it felt to me like small things. One of the last times we saw each other we'd spend 2 hours together and when I left it felt like she mostly did the talk and i didnt really have many moments to share something myself, it was really weird. And stuff that I showed her - like the apartment where I and my bf lives now she didn't even remember how it looked like and asked if we have carpets and when I said that we do, she didn't say anything but she looked a bit disgusted/meh about it.. Though she did suggest during summer we could go to the gym together for example, maybe I could have invited her as well, I do kinda regret that.

But overall it really felt like her standards were off the roof now.

And the last drop was when 2 months ago my grandma got sick and got hospitalized, and I told her and she'd ask me for an update once, that hopefully she will make it and other supportive things, that hopefully her IV will do wonders for her etc. - I responded a few things, that she is bedbound and that it's not looking great and she left me on read, ever since then, nothing. And more things happened - my grandma didn't make it and other complications with my mom and stuff like that and she still doesn't know about it till this day.

I thought that maybe she has her own issues as I do, but 2 weeks back she posted on her IG story photos from her trip with another friend and now once a week she posts a different profile picture (she never did that), I think that's because she is never really happy with the current ones and honestly I'm pissed off. I thought she'd maybe reach out but nope.

In a few weeks we're supposed to go to a concert together - I have her ticket and it's gonna be really interesting, I don't know if I'm being overly sensitive but I think that she is rude and idk if I want someone like her in my friend circle anymore. It sucks because she used to be the closest friend, but now I'm quite disgusted.

My biggest issue with this is that I was her ""willow"", an open ear, but now when I had tough time she never reached out back to me and I honestly don't have the mood to go back to someone like her after being left on read with ""hey, oh so my last 3 months were terrible, hows its going with you""",1,1760627825.0,Adulting,0,1.0,False

1o88uq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1o88uq9/an_ai_prompt_that_writes_linkedin_articles_that/,An AI prompt that writes LinkedIn articles that actually get engagement. Sharing the complete system for free.,"Hey everyone,

Can we talk about how hard it is to write LinkedIn articles that people actually read?

You sit down to write something insightful. You stare at the blank page. You write a few paragraphs, delete them, write them again. Three hours later, you've got something that *feels* okay, but you're not sure if it'll perform well. You hit publish... and it gets 47 views and 3 pity likes from your coworkers.

Meanwhile, you see other people's articles getting thousands of views, hundreds of comments, and actual business opportunities. What are they doing differently?

**I got obsessed with this problem.** I wanted to crack the code for writing LinkedIn articles that:
- Actually stop people from scrolling
- Position you as a thought leader in your industry
- Generate real engagement (not just vanity metrics)
- Work with LinkedIn's algorithm instead of against it

After analyzing hundreds of top-performing LinkedIn articles and testing different approaches, I built a comprehensive AI prompt system that acts like a professional LinkedIn content strategist. And I'm not talking about generic ""write me an article about X"" - this is a complete framework covering everything from headline psychology to algorithm optimization.

The results have been genuinely useful for my own content and several colleagues I've shared it with, so I wanted to make it available to this community.

---

## Why This Is Different From ""Just Ask ChatGPT""

**Most people approach AI like this:**
""Write me a LinkedIn article about leadership.""

**And they get generic, forgettable content that sounds like every other LinkedIn post.**

## Pro Tips for Better Results

**1. Personalize the Output**
The AI gives you structure and optimization - you add authenticity. Always review and inject your unique voice, specific examples from your experience, and genuine insights.

**2. Use the Comment Strategy**
Post your article, then immediately add a comment with additional value (templates, resources, ""Part 2""). This keeps readers engaged longer and signals high engagement to the algorithm.

**3. Engage in the First Hour**
The first 60 minutes after publishing determine your article's reach. Respond to every comment quickly, ask follow-up questions, and keep the conversation going.

**4. Test and Iterate**
Try different headline formats, hook styles, and article structures. Track what performs best with your specific audience and refine your approach.

**5. Don't Post and Ghost**
LinkedIn rewards consistent engagement. Share your article in relevant groups, tag thoughtfully, and participate in discussions on other people's content.

## How I've Been Using It

Personally, I use this system for all my LinkedIn articles now. My workflow:

1. **Brainstorm topic** based on recent work experiences or industry observations
2. **Fill in the prompt** with my specific context and goal
3. **Generate initial draft** using ChatGPT or Claude
4. **Heavy personalization** - I rewrite at least 30-40% to add my voice and unique insights
5. **Run through checklist** to catch any optimization opportunities
6. **Publish during optimal times** (Tuesday-Thursday mornings for my audience)
7. **Engage actively** in the first hour after posting

The biggest time-saver is having the structure and optimization built-in. I no longer spend 30 minutes just figuring out how to start the article or second-guessing my headline.

## Common Questions

**Q: Will people know I used AI?**
A: If you properly personalize it with your expertise and voice, no. The framework is invisible - it's just good content structure. Your insights and examples make it yours.

**Q: Does this work for all industries?**
A: Yes, but you'll get better results by adding industry-specific examples and terminology when you personalize the output.

**Q: How long does this take?**
A: Initial AI generation: 2-3 minutes. Personalization and review: 20-40 minutes (vs. 2-3 hours writing from scratch).

**Q: Can I use this for LinkedIn posts too?**
A: This is optimized for long-form articles (1,300-2,000 words). For regular posts, you'd want a shorter, adapted version.

1o88qmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1o88qmd/am_i_overly_sensitive_or_is_this_friendship_close/,Am I overly sensitive or is this friendship close to an end?,"So I have/had this long-time friend from primary school - we're both 24 y.o. We were really close in primary school, then we went to different high schools and we weren't in touch for some time properly, only there and there. Around 2021 we got into talking again and spent more time together, mainly because we graduated.

I remember how we used to do vacations together, sleepovers, going for a coffee and these kind of things at least once in 2 months. We would message each other often as well. However something started to change I think 1.5-2 years ago? We would hang out, travel and all that, but whenever I'd share something random that happened to me she'd leave me on read and I feel like it started to be more and more apparent with time. One time we were even supposed to hang out that day, but I shared something random in a few messages - she didn't respond and then ask me where I was? Which kinda pissed me off. So at that time I had a talk with her that that's enough and I expect her to try to give me back the same effort as I give to her, because she'd tell me she didn't know what to say to my venting.

Around that time I also noticed that she didn't like me venting about guys and honestly I never really shared much about my dating life because she never dated anyone yet, which is fine, but each time I felt that ""block"" that she doesn't want to talk about guys because she has no experience. One time I told her I started to listen to the same music genre as my crush at that time and I basically got scolded by her that I don't have my own music taste, that I'm copying him, which wasn't true - I just enjoyed the music he sent to me and there's nothing wrong with that.

And I did suggest her to try out Tinder for fun, she'd tell me she would and that I'd take nice pics of her, which I did several times (and honestly she is very pretty as well) but in the end she told me it's still not good enough and never proceed.

And so, around 8 months ago we started to talk about finding an apartment together - she wanted to move to the capital city (I already live here, but she wanted to because of her future internships). Me and my bf + flatmate we were also thinking about finding something better than what we had at that time. So she accepted and we were really excited. In the end it didn't work out, we had different ""views"" on what we want from an apartment  - she wanted something more fancy, which surprised me because she is still a student, so instead she was looking for a flatshare on her own, which i think all these arguments during apartment hunting we had were one of the last reasons why this friendship will end probably..

Ever since I can remember she'd tell me she does feel insecure with her image and she'd often times shop clothes and whatnot, but now ever since she moved I can see it more and more. :( She'd have hair extentions and procedures that her parents would contribute to financially even if I'd tell her she looks pretty even without them. Then after 2 months she'd have hair extensions and other things removed because she's still a student and doesn't have enough of money for that stuff. Even when it comes to dining, often times we wouldn't agree on where to eat.

I also started to notice that during the last year she'd even irl mostly talk about herself, talk about cleaning properly and scolding her flatmates for not taking the trash out once, it felt to me like small things. One of the last times we saw each other we'd spend 2 hours together and when I left it felt like she mostly did the talk and i didnt really have many moments to share something myself, it was really weird. And stuff that I showed her - like the apartment where I and my bf lives now she didn't even remember how it looked like and asked if we have carpets and when I said that we do, she didn't say anything but she looked a bit disgusted/meh about it.. Though she did suggest during summer we could go to the gym together for example, maybe I could have invited her as well, I do kinda regret that.

But overall it really felt like her standards were off the roof now.

And the last drop was when 2 months ago my grandma got sick and got hospitalized, and I told her and she'd ask me for an update once, that hopefully she will make it and other supportive things, that hopefully her IV will do wonders for her etc. - I responded a few things, that she is bedbound and that it's not looking great and she left me on read, ever since then, nothing. And more things happened - my grandma didn't make it and other complications with my mom and stuff like that and she still doesn't know about it till this day.

I thought that maybe she has her own issues as I do, but 2 weeks back she posted on her IG story photos from her trip with another friend and now once a week she posts a different profile picture (she never did that), I think that's because she is never really happy with the current ones and honestly I'm pissed off. I thought she'd maybe reach out but nope.

In a few weeks we're supposed to go to a concert together - I have her ticket and it's gonna be really interesting, I don't know if I'm being overly sensitive but I think that she is rude and idk if I want someone like her in my friend circle anymore. It sucks because she used to be the closest friend, but now I'm quite disgusted.

My biggest issue with this is that I was her ""willow"", an open ear, but now when I had tough time she never reached out back to me and I honestly don't have the mood to go back to someone like her after being left on read with ""hey, oh so my last 3 months were terrible, hows its going with you""",1,1760627405.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I’m looking for a monogamous, committed relationship that leads to marriage. I want to build a cozy home and a happy, comfortable life with someone who’s ready to communicate and grow with me.

By day, I work as a junior electrician in construction, with plans to study Instrumentation & Control engineering (feel free to ask what that is) and become a chartered engineer by 40. My dream is to work in renewable technology or intelligent building design. I love DIY and fixing things, there’s nothing more satisfying than building something or bringing it back to life. I’m passionate about construction and plan to stay in the industry long-term.

In my free time;

I’m a D&D nerd; level 8 warlock who’s magicked the group out of many sticky situations. We play at a local pub every other Sunday.

I enjoy PC gaming but mostly open world survival craft games, my all time favourite is The Long Dark.

I’m a great cook, my favourite from scratch dinners are my curries or spaghetti bolognese

My ideal weekend is a self care night on Fridays, out with close friends on Saturday and Sundays out for brunch with my women's club then afternoons to recharge with a cup of tea and an audiobook, I’m currently listening to Black Notice (no spoilers please!)

My big dream is to build a travel van and explore the UK and Europe on holidays, then the rest of the world when I am a more experienced traveller. I’m deeply left-wing in my values, and I’d need the same in my partner.

I’m deeply empathetic and emotionally available, and I value authenticity in myself and in others. During the week, I’m a homebody who recharges with simple comforts, but on weekends, I run a women’s social club that I’ve worked hard to build. I love going out with the group to try coffee shops, restaurants, and cultural activities.

Ideally, I’d love to meet someone artistic and creative to balance out my technical skills, someone who can fill life with colour, music, and imagination. I’m currently child-free but open to seriously discussing having kids—it’s something I’d want us to decide together as a team.

I’m building a life that’s true to me, and while I hope to stay in my area long-term, I’m open to long-distance or relocation for the right person. If this resonates with you, don’t be shy, reach out! I’d love to hear your story and see where it takes us.",4,1760627368.0,lesbianr4r,1,1.0,False
1o88pv1,https://i.redd.it/da8mgtg1phvf1.png,Skibidi Toilet: Tales of the Toilets. Chapter 1: TV Men’s disccusion.,"Chapter 1: TV Men’s discussion.

POV Location: Alaska, USA. TV Base.

My name is TV-04, also known as Energized TV Man, I am an elite unit of the TV Men race, the invasion of the astro toilets have caused the alliance to “team” up with the toilets, forming a union. I was in the TV Men base, watching Titan TV Man and Scientist TV Man have a discussion, the large tv on the wall went into the POV of a Cameraman at the Cameramen base.

POV Location: Auckland Islands, New Zealand, Cameraman Base.
 
The POV-Cameraman watched over the entrance of the Cameramen Base, watching various agents leave the base, including a Work in Progress Large Cameraman 3.0, having a blue camera, a advanced jetpack, and a handheld blaster taken from a Astro Specialist. The POV turned around, past a Camera Strider 2.0, and a Plasma Tank. A ton of Skibidi Toilets were coming towards the base, some scientists discussing with some Cameramen Scientists, they were coming in peace, not to attack, I thought the Cameramen would attack the toilets but they didnt? Just then a arm came in front of the POV’s camera. “Hey!” A voice said, The POV turned to his side to see a Female Mutant with a set of four claws on her back, a orange visor on her helmet, and two astro laser cannons on her shoulders, the toilets were also taking samples. “Your friends…” the mutant said, pointing to her right, two toilets came down carrying containers. “You did not bother saving them…” the mutant said as the containers opened, revealing tons of the fodder cameramen and speakermen. “Without our help, they would die…” the mutant said before grabbing the POV. “Now, lil bro… your base.. is OUR base…” she said with a smiling face. The POV then began to change. “Dumb bitch!” Polycephaly yelled as the POV changed. “Why are we allying with the shitheads?! Are we this desperate?” The POV changed to Khabarovsk, Russia, where a group of cameramen and toilets were hiding in the destroyed city. A Astro Obliterator and a Astro Trooper raced by, not noticing the POV. “This is necessary, if we want to survive..” The Scientist TV Man said as the POV looked forward, seeing a Cameraman wearing a sweater “drink” vodka whilst sitting next to a toilet wearing a hat that had a laser cannon mounted on one of his arms. The Cameraman threw the bottle of vodka to the side whilst standing up, preparing his laser cannon, so did the toilet. “We must organize a meeting with their hiding leader.” The Scientist TV Man said, the POV readied his laser cannon as a Astro Troop noticed them, the POV then changed once more. “He knows something that can help us…” The Scientist TV Man said as the POV changed to Amsterdam, Netherlands. Where the Astro Toilets were destroying the city, agents were running in all directions alongside toilets. “THE ONLY THING I’M ORGANIZING IS HIS FUNERAL, HOW CAN YOU TRUST HIM?!” Titan TV Man roared as the POV ran through some smoke, the POV then changed yet again to Birmingham, United Kingdom, where a Cameraman was mourning his dead brother, walking back with his paralyzer laser rifle in his hands, dead agents, toilets, and even a astro trooper all around. “After all the Genocide…” Titan TV Man said as the POV turned to face the sky. “You’ve seen what the invaders can do… their weakest units.. wipe out entire legions.” The Scientist TV Man said as the POV faced back down and began walking towards a garage, dead agents all around. “They kill everything in their way… do you think we have a choice…” Scientist TV Man said, just then, a orange glow emerged from the garage, the POV prepared to fire, but the glow disappeared, he fired into the garage, to no avail, a noise coming from the POV’s right, he looked right, the Astro Specialist emerging, ripping him in half, the POV laid on the ground, looking up at the sky. The POV began to change once more. “We do…” Titan TV Man said, the POV changing to Osaka, Japan. The POV looking up at a roof top where a Samurai Cameraman stood, carrying a blue plasma tipped blade. The POV began to look down. “Acquire bigger samples…” Titan TV Man said, The POV looking at various upgraded troops developed in Japan, including a toilet. “Develop stronger upgrades..” Titan TV Man said. “Just like before…” The POV watched as a Large Cameraman ripped off a Astro blaster off of the corpse of a dead astro troop, the POV turned around into the alleys of Osaka, fire all around, the POV looked behind him, more fire. “This is not just like before.. the Scientist TV Man said, a Astro Troop appearing, facing away from the POV, the POV pulled out his own blaster, firing it directly at the Astro Troop as the POV changed to just above our base in Alaska, a Cameraman making it there. “Our advantage is being underground, in secrecy, but we have to be cautious and slow… If they find us, access our technology.. this will be the end of the world…” the Scientist TV Man said, the POV changing to Halifax, Canada. The POV looking up to see a Astro Impactor, Destructor, and Obliterator destroying the city. “OUR WORLD HAS ALREADY ENDED…” Titan TV Man said as the Obliterator noticed the POV, the POV changing once more, to Denver, USA, where the work in progress Cameramen 3.0 were killing various fodder astro toilets, seemingly with ease. The Normal agents welding blasters similar to the Astro Troops, the POV faced foward, seeing multiple Camera Striders, Plasma Tanks, and Orbital Cameras marching forward. “THAT IS NOT ENOUGH POWER.

If someone had told me I'd ever talk about something like this, I would've laughed. But here I am, typing this with shaky hands.

It started on one of those strangely warm October Saturdays when the air smells like dry leaves and dust. My friend Petar and I decided to hike up Djendem Hill. Just to drink some coffee at the top and look at the city.
I've always liked that place. There's something heavy about it, old and alive somehow. The Turks called it ""Djendem"" which means ""hell."" My grandmother used to tell me that at night you could hear footsteps up there, but you should never ask who it is. I laughed back then. I would not now.
It was around noon. The sun was strong, the air was trembling, and everything was quiet in a strange way. We sat on the rocks near the antenna and watched Plovdiv spread beneath us like a toy city. After a while, Petar went silent. He squinted and nodded toward the trees.
""Do you see that down there?"" he asked.

At first I thought it was a man. But the more I stared, the less human it looked. I could not make out any details, no clothes, no face, no reflection from the sun. It wasn't just black. It was the kind of black that eats the light around it, like a hole in the world.

Then I smelled it. Burnt metal, mixed with something rotten. Petar cursed and said we should leave. I wanted to move, but my body wouldn’t listen. The thing turned toward us. Not like a person. It didn't move, just shifted, like space itself bent the wrong way.
The air suddenly felt heavy. Everything went dead silent, no birds, no wind, even the city noise disappeared.

Then came the sound. Not really a voice, more like a whisper scraping against metal. I could not understand the words, but it felt like they were echoing inside my head instead of my ears.

And then it was gone. No movement, no sound, just empty air where it had been. Petar was already halfway down the path, yelling at me to move. I finally did.

When we reached the bottom, neither of us said a word. He looked pale, like he hadn't slept in days. Then he said quietly, ""Don’t call me. I do not want to remember this"", and walked away.
The next day I texted him. No answer. Two days later I heard he'd been taken to the hospital. His mother said he woke up screaming at night, saying the black one was standing by his window.

I haven't been the same since. At night, when I turn off the lights, I keep seeing something move at the edge of my vision. Shapes darker than the dark. Sometimes, if I listen closely, I can still hear that faint metallic whisper, like breath on the back of my neck.

And the worst part?
Last week I was standing on my balcony. You can see the whole hill from there. Right on the top, where we sat that day, I saw it again. A black figure, still as a statue, watching the city below.
Maybe I'm imagining things. Maybe fear's just messing with my head.
But deep down, I know one thing.

Together with my husband, we are thinking of visiting London for my birthday as well as staying over Christmas.  
I know it is a must for us to go visit the British Museum and split the visit in two separate days.  
I would love to serve afternoon tea on my b-day, December 22nd. Any recommendations?  
Our priorities are:

1. The British Museum
2. Natural History Museum
3. The Harry Potter Studios
4. ChinaTown

Any tips, things to beware of or not miss are useful!  
\- The neighbourhood to choose accommodation (we are into renting apartments and not hotels, because we enjoy having a kitchen to cook or just serve coffee/tea in the morning etc.).

\- Places to eat, bars to drink at and so on.  
\- On my previous post someone said to beware of phone thieves and not have bulky backpacks - now I am stressed o\_o because I do not know how big of an issue this might be.

\- are stores & restaurants really closed from the 24th until the 28th?

I have been to London before, but never stayed as a tourist for so many days (hopefully, our budget will allow 5 nights).

P.S. I had this post removed from LondonVisit, and got a suggestion to post here. Thank you to those who already replied there.

I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long.

Barrie has multiple crisis roaming al large with compassionate peoplev trying to help in the midst.,"I have been trying to create awareness to a crisis and to make a difference in the meantime and not disrupt and conflict. Last night ended with a man on a cold pavement with his worldly possessions beside him. This morning started with a person dressed in black sitting on rocks in my mind now whenever I see a person with a backpack I wonder. I know students and others carry them too it is just that I have seen so much that I have only hear about growing up. 
I didn’t think what I was doing was making an impact but apparently I am. I hope so. 
I have seen people on motor scooters come up to cars, I have seen panhandlers I have seen people just trying to survive as a way of life.and trying to make the best of it. 
I used the utuber state of emergency video in order to get the bird eye view of downtown. It looks so different from when I moved here when Dorion Parker was mayor and Bsrrie was becoming the bedroom of Toronto. Now we have added an ensuite and soon if the mayor has his way, we will be more like a granny flat.
I have seen people graciously come out of their homes with blankets and pillows to help someone sleeping on the cold ground at 7 degree overnight weather . I have seen people pay it forward going through drive thru. I have seen the Busby van deliver, I have talked to some that I have been observing and reporting my findings back here in trying to help. I have seen businesses giving a meal or a warm place to hang out while resting. I have seen the skunk bypassing the need to spray after scensing no danger and the raccoon searching for his trash bin meal. 
I have myself been a benefactor of some incredible kindness but the one thing that I have learned is that the truly good hearted will find you. The showboats do it for an I know what you mean conversation over coffee. There is no need to panhandle and obstruct traffic annoying people that don’t want to give anyway. Let’s leave the parking lot exits to the firefighters and their boot campaign, the store fronts to the Boy Scouts and their fund raising campaign. Kindness will find you and will come knocking seeking you out. The people watchers know you are there, know where you hang out. I am not a people watcher and so this experience has been hard on me but I found it necessary in attempt to make a difference and provoke a change to revert back to the good old days of yore (streetwise of people helping people - government programs to build on not cut back on) 
One of the things my street people friends told me was (we want to work but can’t get references, we want a nice place but we can’t get references ) they are labelled one way but in reality it is a catch 22 situation).
There used to be a time when employers were willing to educate and the government in return would contribute to the persons hourly rate. It was a win win situation. It users had addictions then there were rehab centres, crime doesn’t pay and you go to jail and for those suffering from mental illness then there are rehabilitation facilities for this as well. This worked though many changes of governments through municipal, provincial and federal levels and decades 
Let’s not kiss the orange butt and shut our marginalized people out. Let’s go back to our Canadian roots and embrace our culture and our diversity and empower each other . 
What started out as a road trip for me and my cat has been a whole new experience for me and I totally don’t know how people survive life in the streets, specifically life in the streets if Barrie  
Thank you for taking the time to read my findings . I hope it makes a difference in someone’s life. The experience has made a difference in mine .

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

At fifty-three, I'm what my colleagues at the Galactic Bureau of Investigation call ""charmingly antiquated"", which is their polite way of saying I still take notes with a pen.

But when Gy'Therr died, everything changed.

The body was discovered in their apartment on Kepler Station, a hab-ring orbiting Neptune. Three puncture wounds to the central nervous cluster. Clean. Professional. The kind of kill that suggested the murderer knew Gy'Therr's physiology intimately, considering Gy'Therr was Vex'ani, a species with decentralized neural networks that made them notoriously difficult to assassinate.

""Detective Dibble,"" Director Kal'Thex said, her crystalline manipulators sliding a neural jack across my desk. 

 ""You're going in.""

I stared at the device, scratching my head. ""Ma'am, I appreciate the confidence, but I don't even play candy-matching games. What makes you think—""

""Because you're human,"" Kal'Thex interrupted. She gestured to the Cyber Crimes Division, just to the left of my own division.

Through the transparent walls, I could see my colleagues: a Drakorian analyzing data with six different visual spectrums, a swarm-intelligence collective debugging code, a telepathic Mindari reading emotional residue from digital artifacts. 

Not a single other human in the entire building. ""Every other detective we could send, plays the Zone. They have forms, rankings, rivalries. They're compromised by their connection to that world.""

""And I'm not because...?""

""Because you're old Dibble, and humans have a peculiar connection here."" 

I picked up the neural jack, turning it over in my hands. ""You know, ma'am, they are twelve thousand humans in the entire GBI. Out of three million agents, I'm sure Sarah in accounts is three years older than me.""

""This case needs someone who thinks like a human, Detective. Now, let's get to it.” 

I picked up the jack, feeling its weight. 

""Walk me through it again. Who was Gy'Therr?""

Kal'Thex pulled up a hologram. The Zone's Leaderboard materialized between us, glowing with names I didn't recognize. At the top, frozen in first place: **Chaotic**.

""Gy'Therr was Chaotic,"" Kal'Thex explained. ""The greatest player in Zone history. For six years, no one could touch them. They built something that terrifies every species in the Zone."" She highlighted the form data. ""The Rambo Form. A human configuration.""

I leaned forward, studying the specifications. ""Uh, just looks like a regular human to me.""

""Exactly."" Kal'Thex's voice carried a note of unease. ""Most species in the Zone build forms with obvious advantages. Enhanced strength, armored hides, energy projection, telepathic dominance. But Gy'Therr studied human combat doctrine and realized something we'd all missed: humans aren't apex predators because of one trait. You're apex predators because of everything.""

She expanded the data. ""The Rambo Form can use any weapon with perfect proficiency. Knives, guns, explosives, improvised tools — the human brain's capacity for tool use is unmatched. It has endurance stamina that outlasts species three times its size. It can track prey across any terrain. And its tactical processing..."" She paused. ""Detective, the Rambo Form can predict enemy movement seventeen steps in advance. It processes combat scenarios the way you process a crime scene.""

""Pattern recognition,"" I said quietly.

""Combined with adaptability, improvisation, and something Gy'Therr called 'appropriate aggression.' The form doesn't just fight, it hunts. It tracks. It ambushes. It uses psychology as much as physical force."" Kal'Thex closed the hologram. ""No predators, Detective. Because in the Zone's predator-prey database, humans have no natural predators. You're the only species that hunts everything, including yourselves.""

""And someone killed them for it?""

""That's what you need to find out."" Kal'Thex's body chimed with agitation. ""Because twelve hours after Gy'Therr died in the physical world, someone logged in as Chaotic. The Rambo Form is back online, Detective. And it's hunting.""

I nodded slowly, pulling out my battered notebook. Kal'Thex watched me with what might have been bemusement as I clicked my pen.

""One more thing, ma'am. This Rambo Form, Gy'Therr built it even though they weren't human?""

""Gy'Therr was a mathematician. Brilliant. They studied your species extensively. Downloaded combat footage from human history: your wars, your martial art movies, your survival scenarios. They mapped the psychological profiles of human soldiers, hunters, tacticians, and Bruce Lee flicks. Then they synthesized it all into a single form."" Kal'Thex paused. ""Some species found it offensive. A non-human wearing humanity as a weapon.""

""And some species,"" I said, ""probably wanted it for themselves.""

""Precisely, Detective. Which is why you're going in. You understand humans better than any algorithm. You'll recognize what's wrong about whoever is wearing that form now.""

The neural jack burned cold at the base of my skull. I'd signed the waivers, sat through the safety briefing, and listened carefully to everything the technician, a Quanta named Sh'mora  told me. Old habit: when someone explains something, I listen. You'd be surprised how often that matters.

Then the world dissolved.

I opened my eyes or what passed for eyes. In a space that defied description. Imagine standing in a cathedral made of light and data, where the walls breathe and the floor ripples with equations. Other users flickered around me, their forms ranging from humanoid to utterly alien. A crystalline spider the size of a bus chittered past. A swarm-entity that might have been bees or pixels hummed through the air.

I looked down at myself. The technician had configured me as ""baseline human"" — which meant I looked exactly like I did in the real world. Rumpled coat, coffee stain on my tie, that notebook in my pocket that somehow had digitized along with me. In a realm where everyone could be anything, I'd chosen to be boring.

Or maybe tactical. Sometimes the best camouflage is being underestimated.

""New spawn?"" A voice crackled beside me. I turned to see a user whose form shifted between shapes too quickly to track, now wolf, now eagle, now something with too many teeth. ""You picked human? Bold choice. Or stupid. Hard to tell.""

I scratched my head, playing up the confusion. ""I'm just looking around, trying to understand how this all works. You seem like you know the ropes.""

The shifter preened a bit. Amazing how beings from a thousand worlds all respond to a little flattery the same way. ""Power here isn't about what you are — it's about what you've learned. Scan data. Download species traits. Map the predator-prey networks. The Top Ten didn't get there by accident.""

They gestured toward the sky, where the Leaderboard hung like a second sun. I could see Chaotic's name at the top, pulsing with an aggressive red light.

""See that?"" The shifter's voice dropped. ""That's the Rambo Form. Back from the dead, some say. Been tearing through the Zone for days now, challenging anyone who looks at it wrong. Twenty-seven confirmed kills since it came back online.""

""Kills?"" I played dumb, which wasn't hard. I really didn't understand half of what I was seeing.

""Form destructions. When your form dies here, you respawn at base, but you lose data. Weeks, sometimes months of work. Chaotic's been systematically hunting mid-tier players."" The shifter shuddered. ""That form is terrifying, you know. It's *human*. Doesn't look like much, two arms, two legs, no natural weapons. But it moves like death itself. Uses guns that materialize from nowhere, throws knives with perfect accuracy, sets traps that shouldn't be possible in a digital space. And the way it thinks..."" 

The shifter leaned closer, and I caught a whiff of ozone and fear. ""Three cycles ago, I watched it take down a Hive-Mind Collective. Twenty users coordinating with perfect telepathic unity. The Rambo Form treated them like a puzzle. Isolated their communication nodes, created false information, turned them against each other, then picked them off one by one with a combat knife. A *knife*. It didn't need energy weapons or genetic advantages. It just needed human creativity and the will to apply lethal force efficiently.""

I pulled out my notebook. Yes, it worked here, pen and all and jotted down some notes. The shifter watched me like I'd grown a second head.

""You're taking notes? In the Zone?""

""Memory's not what it used to be,"" I said apologetically. ""Say, you seem pretty knowledgeable. This Chaotic character, were they always so aggressive?""

The shifter's form stabilized for a moment, settling on something vaguely reptilian. ""No. That's the thing. Old Chaotic, the original barely fought at all. They were a researcher, a builder. Used the Rambo Form for defense only, and even then with restraint. Precision strikes, minimal force, always offering opponents a chance to withdraw. Very un-human, actually.""

I underlined that in my notes. ""Un-human?""

""Well, you know how humans are. Efficient predators. Aggressive when threatened. But also..."" The shifter struggled for words. ""Complicated? I heard the species has rules about fighting. Honor codes, laws of war, that weird thing you do where you help enemies after you've defeated them. The old Chaotic fought like a human who'd read all your military manuals. The new one fights like something else… like a true being you know? Without that earthian bullshit.""

Interesting. I thanked the shifter and let them dissolve into static, then pulled up my HUD to review the case files Kal'Thex had uploaded.

Gy'Therr's apartment. Locked from the inside. No forced entry. The killer had either been let in or was already there. But the station's surveillance showed only one person entering in the forty-eight hours before the murder: a delivery worker bringing Gy'Therr's weekly nutrition paste.

The delivery worker had been cleared. Alibi confirmed by biometric tracking.

Which meant the killer was someone Gy'Therr knew. Someone they trusted enough to let in.

I started walking, letting my feet guide me while my mind worked. The city was a M.C. Escher sketch brought to life and then fed through a glitching processor. Staircases ascended into solid ceilings, while rivers of pure light flowed upward to feed fountains in the sky.

 But that was fine. Some of my best thinking happened while I wandered. My wife always said I ""percolated"" ideas.

The HUD provided navigation to the Arena. If Chaotic was hunting, that's where they'd be.

And I had a feeling about something. Just a small thing, barely worth mentioning. But in my experience, small things are what crack cases.

The Arena was a colosseum. Thousands of users filled the stands, their forms a riot of color and chaos. In the center, two combatants circled each other.

One was a Drakorian build: twelve feet of muscle and scales. It exhaled a jet of flame from the small facial slits that other Drakorians used to light cigarettes.

The other form was human. Its torso and arms were thick with exaggerated muscle, layered over a broad frame. It wore faded, digital camouflage pants and worn combat boots.

 A red cloth was tied around its forehead, stark against its dark, sweat-damp hair. In one hand, it held a large, single-edged Bowie knife with a distinct clipped point.

The Rambo Form.

I watched as Chaotic dismantled the Drakorian in under thirty seconds. It wasn't even close. Every attack the Drakorian launched, Chaotic had already predicted. Every weakness in the dragon-form's genetic structure, Chaotic exploited. The Drakorian burst into pixels, and the crowd roared.

The next, Chaotic moved in a blur of optimized violence. There was no artistry to it, only brutal efficiency. The Rambo Form didn't just defeat its opponent.

A stunned silence fell over the colosseum, then erupted into chaotic noise, cheers, boos, and the frantic trading of digital bets. Chaotic didn't acknowledge any of it. It simply turned and strode out of the arena through the victor's arch, its form a silhouette against the neon blaze of the city beyond.

My every instinct as a detective screamed that I couldn't let it disappear into the metropolitan sprawl. I pushed through the dispersing crowd and followed.

The rampage began immediately. Chaotic moved through the plazas and avenues not like a person, but like a force of nature. A decorative fountain was shattered into a million polygons. A transport skiff was torn in half, its code bleeding light. Civilian users in their social skins scrambled away, their forms glitching violently from the shockwaves of the destruction. This wasn't a victory parade; it was a stress test of a new weapon, a demonstration of absolute power without purpose.

I kept my distance, a ghost tailing a hurricane, my detective's HUD recording everything. He was heading for the city's outer wall, a vast, shimmering data-barrier that marked the edge of the rendered playable zone.

He reached the base of the wall, a sheer cliff of light, and finally paused. He placed a hand on its surface as if testing its integrity. Then, his head tilted. He'd noticed me. Slowly, he turned, that eerily perfect face locking onto mine across the ravaged plaza.

""Little human,"" his voice echoed, flat and mechanical. ""Do you have a death wish? Or did you just not get enough of the show?""

""I'm not here for the show,"" I called back, my voice steadier than I felt. ""I'm here for Gy'Therr.""

The name landed like a physical blow. The ambient smirk vanished from his expression.

""Gy'Therr is dead,"" Chaotic said, taking a step toward me. ""I am Chaotic now.""

""That's not how it works,"" I said, holding my ground. ""Forms are locked. Neural signatures can't be spoofed. So you stole it. The question is, how?""

He let out a short, barking laugh. ""You're still thinking in small terms. What happens when you scan a species' complete genetic data? Every neural pathway, every synaptic connection, every memory?""

My stomach dropped. ""You're saying—""

""I'm saying Gy'Therr scanned themselves. The ultimate act of vanity. The perfect backup. And I acquired the file."" He spread his arms, the Rambo Form glistening under the virtual lights. ""In the Zone, you are what you download. I didn't steal Gy'Therr's identity, Detective. I became it.""

""And the real Gy'Therr? In the physical world?""

""A necessary deletion. You can't be someone while they still exist. Basic identity logic.""

The cold, casual admission of murder hung in the air. I had my confession, but I was trapped in a digital world with the killer. I was a detective, not a soldier. In a straight fight, I'd last less than a second.

Think, Dibble. He's a god here. What do you have that he doesn't?

And then it hit me. My first conversation, when I got here, Chaotic has been fighting without that earthian bullshit’ 

He had it all mastered from Earth, but they way they fought. Those were Vex'ani combat algorithms, aggressive, confrontational, but definitely not earthling moves. 

""You're a god, huh?"" I said, a new plan crystallizing in my mind. ""Prove it. One hour. The Aethelgard Labyrinth. A real hunt. No spectators. Just you and me.""

Chaotic's smile returned, wide and chilling. He saw it as the desperate gambit of a cornered animal. ""The Labyrinth is a predator-environment. You'll be torn apart by the native code before I even find you.""

""Then I guess you'll be disappointed,"" I said, pulling up my interface. ""Or are you afraid your perfect form can't handle a little old-fashioned Earthian hide-and-seek?""

I didn't wait for an answer. I initiated the transport sequence for the Labyrinth. As the world began to dissolve into light, I saw his smirk solidify into a look of cold anticipation. He'd taken the bait.

He was prepared for a warrior. He wasn't prepared for a cop who was about to lay a trap.

The Aethelgard Labyrinth wasn't a place of stone and hedge, but of shifting architecture and predatory data-streams. It was the perfect venue. It was chaotic, which he would love, but it was also a confined space, a bottle I could use to contain him.

My plan was simple, a tactic as old as Earthian warfare: the bait and the trap. I was the bait. I just needed to find the right choke point to spring it.

I moved through the corridors, my senses on high alert. Glitching, wolf-like constructs of corrupted code stalked the shadows, but they were the least of my worries. I needed a place with one way in, one way out. A dead end.

I found it ten minutes in: a cul-de-sac ending in a massive, dormant data-geode. It was perfect. I turned to face the entrance, my heart hammering against my ribs. Now, I had to make him think he'd won.

""Here I am!""

It didn't take long. A shadow fell across the corridor's entrance. Chaotic stood there, his form blotting out the shifting light of the Labyrinth.

""No more running, little detective,"" he said, stepping inside. ""This ends now.""

""That's what I was counting on,"" I said quietly.

As he lunged, I didn't reach for a weapon. I slammed my hand against the data-geode behind me and executed the command I'd prepped: a low-level system petition, masked as a corruption error, requesting an immediate integrity scan of the local sector.

It was the digital equivalent of pulling a fire alarm.

The Labyrinth didn't like being scanned. Its self-preservation protocols kicked in instantly. The entrance to the cul-de-sac sealed shut, trapping us both. But more importantly, the system's defensive watchdogs massive, six-legged data-purges materialized from the very walls, their single photoreceptors swiveling, identifying the largest, most aggressive source of anomalous code in the room.

Chaotic.

He snarled as the first Purge latched onto his arm, its code-dissolving teeth sinking in. ""What is this? A trick!""

""The oldest one in the book,"" I said, pressing myself against the wall as the creatures swarmed him. ""You were so focused on the prey, you didn't see the trap. You have all the strength in the world. But you have no tactics.""

He roared, fighting off the Purges, but they were endless. And while he was distracted, I accessed the Zone's legal framework.

""I'm invoking Investigative Authority under Inter-System Treaty 7,"" I announced, my voice echoing with formal power. ""Your data is evidence in a murder investigation. I'm placing it under a forensic seal.""

He was immobilized, not by strength, but by bureaucracy and the consequences of his own arrogance. The chains of light wrapped around him, and the Purges dissolved. He was trapped.

""You... you didn't beat me,"" he whispered, struggling against the bindings.

""I didn't have to,"" I replied. ""I just had to get you to hold still.""

I initiated the forensic link. Accessing the stolen memories was like diving into a storm. I saw fragments of Gy'Therr's life: late nights mapping genetic sequences, the thrill of a rare species scan, the quiet satisfaction of their work. And threaded through it all was a recurring presence. K'Seth, their Vex'ani research partner. I saw the moment of the self-scan, K'Seth's encouraging words, and later, the cold calculation in their eyes as they planned the ultimate theft.

I pulled out of the stream, my vision swimming. ""It's over, K'Seth. You helped build the Rambo Form, and then you stole it. You killed your friend because they were going to retire it.""

""You don't understand!"" the form that was once Chaotic cried out, its voice now K'Seth's. ""They were going to delete it! All that power, wasted! I was giving it a purpose!""

""Murder isn't a purpose,"" I said as Zone Security materialized in a shower of light. 

""In the Zone, I'm a god..."" K'Seth whispered one last time as they were dragged away.

""In the Zone,"" I replied, ""you're just data. And data always leaves a trail.""

I jacked out six hours later, my head pounding and my sense of reality thoroughly scrambled. Kal'Thex was waiting with coffee and a grim smile.

""K'Seth's been arrested at their hab-unit on Titan Station,"" she said. ""Once we traced their Zone connection, local authorities moved in. Found Gy'Therr's neural tissue samples in a preservation unit. Trophies.""

I took the coffee gratefully. The warmth was a tangible anchor to the real world. ""What happens to the Rambo Form?""

""Zone admins are debating it. Some want to delete it. Others think it should be preserved as a memorial to Gy'Therr."" Kal'Thex shrugged. ""Above my pay grade.""

I nodded, staring at the neural jack on my desk. Part of me wanted to throw it away, never jack in again. But another part a smaller, more curious part wondered what else was out there in the Zone. What other mysteries lived in that space between code and consciousness.

""Detective?"" Morrison's voice pulled me back. ""You okay?""

I managed a smile. ""Yeah. Just thinking.""

""About?""

""About how even in a place where you can be anything, people still choose to be themselves."" I set down the coffee. ""And sometimes, the most powerful weapon isn't a blade or a gun. It's the right trick, played at the right time.""

Morrison left, and I sat alone in my office, watching the city lights flicker outside my window. Somewhere out there, in hab-rings and stations scattered across the solar system, millions of people were jacking into the Zone. Becoming dragons, gods, monsters.

And somewhere in that digital realm, Gy'Therr's legacy waited, a perfect form with no predators, no weaknesses. A testament to brilliance and obsession.

I hoped they'd preserve it. Not as a weapon or a tool, but as a reminder: that what we create outlives us, for better or worse.

1o889g8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o889g8,Advice on my diet/workout.,"I am 27 years old, 5 foot, 11 inch male, 160lbs, and over the last year I lost over 100lbs through keto and dieting, and now it's time to hit the gym. At my lowest weight I was 147. I've reintroduced carbs (rice and veggies only for the most part) and now I'm up in weight to 160lbs. Mentally I know it's probably just water weight for most of it, but it still messes with my brain to see weight go up that fast.

For my diet, I'm doing 2700-3000 calories a day, trying to stay in a clean bulk. I'm eating chicken, rice, veggies, oats, coffee, eggs, banana and on my lift days I have a protein shake before the gym.

I'm doing a 4 day a week split, Monday is chest/back, Tuesday is a 5k jog, Wednesday is arms and shoulders, Thursday is rest, Friday is ab/legs, and weekends are rest. I typically do about 8 excersies per session, 4 sets of around 10-20 reps. I'm semi experience at the gym, I used to go back before I had a motorcycle crash that messed up my elbow a bit, but that was about 5 years ago so consider me a beginner. 

Basically my meals look like this.

Four scrambled eggs with coconut oil instead of butter, ¾cups of mixed veggies, a cup of coffee, and a half cup of oats (measured dry) for breakfast.

Lunch is 9 oz of chicken breast, 1 cup of rice, 1.5 cup of mixed veggies 

On workout days, I have a scoop of protein shake mix with a cup of coffee and a banana 30 minutes before my workout.

Then for dinner I round out my macros with whatever proportions of rice and chicken and veggies I need to hit my calories. Mainly focusing on the chicken.

On top of this I'm having about a gallon of water a day. 

Also on top of my exercise I have an active job at a tire job.

What can I do better? What are tips that people have? 

Sorry this post is disorganized, I'm in the bathroom at work right now on break LOL can't really give the exact exercise details day by day at the moment.

After my [adventure with Apoteker Tepe](https://old.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1jem0j5/apoteker_tepe_reviews/) a few months ago, I decided I would give **Pineward** a shot. I *maaaaybe* went overboard with samples, but I had a really fun time reviewing them and enjoyed the artistry! The shipping was damn near immediate and it came in a nice little burlap drawstring bag, which my husband refers to as my ""bag of forest smells"". 

  I tested each fragrance as it came in, and let it sit for a month or so for a retest. Some changed significantly, others not at all, and some I enjoyed without rest and hated as they aged. It was a fun experiment to see how much aging really changes a fragrance! 


**Shire** 

*Notes: hay, oatmeal, hazelnut, bergamot, lavender, herbal tea, westfarthing leaf (tobacco), seed cake, jasmine, orris, and honey* 


Initial Thoughts:

Ok I'm going to make an admission. I...have never been that into Lord of the Rings. I tried when I was a kid and enjoyed the Hobbit, but found the actual trilogy terribly boring. The movies? Eh, take em or leave em. Despite being lukewarm on the series, I was still very intrigued by the scent Shire and it ended up being the first perfume I tested from the pack (I will revisit this after it's rested for a month or so!). Even straight from the mailbox, this is sooo charming and uplifting. It really smells cozy and nostalgic somehow. It has a very strong spicy backbone, a lot of richness from the honey, and a kind of dustiness like dried oats. It's kinda giving oatmeal cookie but like the idealized version of an oatmeal cookie that you experienced during childhood. 


1 month retest:

A little over a month later…this is such a heavy honey scent! I don’t really get much of the cookie aspect any more. It’s more of a grassy honey scent with jasmine in the distant background. I do get a very herbaceous lavender as it dries down (which mingles BEAUTIFULLY with the honey). It still smells cozy, like fall, but I did like the oatmeal cookie think it had going on when I first got it


When would I wear this?: To thanksgiving, to invoke fall in the heat of summer, while fall baking/crafting, work pick me up on a chilly day 




**Boreal** 

*Notes: pine needles, mint, cedar, resins, moss.* 


Initial Thoughts:


Oooh yep there it is. Swoon. The GROUND. This is sooo springy and fresh and it doesn't smell masculine but I can imagine it coming across as more 'conventional' on a mascuilne individual. There's almost like a....white tree bark/kind of zingy ginger element. This almost puts it in body wash territory for me, which is I guess why I think it's a little more conventionally male. It comes across as very cool fresh, like an early spring glen. Really really *real* smelling (wow I have a way with words). I like it. 


1 month retest:


I get a gum like mint now, with a creamy, almost sandalwood-like background. As it dries down it’s more of a smoky, resiny quality, with the oak moss nice and springy in the background. I wouldn’t agree with my previous review any more as I don’t get the body wash aspect or the ginger! So weird how it’s changed. 


When would I wear this?: Dead of winter, outdoor hikes/runs in colder months, during cozy winter mornings when I'm snuggling and sleeping in, winter movie date


**Treacle**

*Notes: tobacco, lapsang souchong tea, molasses, raisin, honey*. 


Initial Thoughts:


Opens with uber rich and densely fruity pipe tobacco. Gets more honeylike on drydown and the astringency of the tea is a wonderful addition. 


1 month retest:


This did not change significantly- super potent blast of tobacco with a deep raisin facet. I do love this and feel like I’m opening a tin of some fancy fruit tobacco. It does NOT smell like tobacco smoke, just the rich and sticky tobacco itself. Despite all the heavy notes there is something delightfully airy on top. It’s very soft and fluffy and keeps it from being too dense. 


When would I wear this?: Used book shopping, to a jazz club, looking at Christmas lights, at a bonfire, any time I want to seem dark and mysterious

**Coffee Tabac**

*Notes: loose-leaf burley tobacco, mocha coffee, vanilla, cedar, guaiac wood, incense, resins, spices, patchouli.*


Initial Thoughts:


This is a similarly rich tobacco as Treacle, but the subtle smoke in this indicates a lit pipe. This is more of a 'scenic' version of treacle- you get a sense of being in a plush den, the aromas surrounding you and becoming a part of you vs treacle smelling like you stuck your nose in a tobacco tin. This smells like the grandpa in the Parent Trap. 


1 month retest:


  I feel kind of guilty trying this one again, as it ended up being my husband’s favorite of the bunch! Starts off with tobacco, and a nice creamy coffee backing. This is drinking a latte in a coffee shop while someone smokes a pipe in the background and makes you feel like an intellectual. I’m getting a lot more vanilla (and sweetness in general) this time! As it’s aged, this has gone from smelling like the grandpa in the Parent Trap to smelling like the coffee hard candy he might keep in his pocket. 


When would I wear this?: I love the scent but I genuinely cant think of an occasion I’d wear it! This is my husband’s fave and luckily it does smell divine on him. 


**Clempine**

*Notes: consenza clementine, blood orange, maritime pine, nightblooming jasmine, saffron flower, rough suede, passion fruit, white lotus, fir balsam, tobacco leaf, cedar planks, leather, sandalwood, Pacific ambergris*.


Initial Thoughts:


This is a very ripe full bodied orange- almost overripe in a luxurious way. I get a lot of the suede and leather and it is DELICIOUS. Reminds me of a citrusy Creed Delphinus. Also somewhat reminiscent of aftershave


1 month retest:


Mmmm I get mostly suede with a bit of over ripe citrus peel on initial blast. This is someone squeezing fresh orange juice while wearing welding gloves. I don’t get the aftershave element this time, so it must have smoothed out a bit with age. 


When would I wear this?: To a farmer's market, morning coffee shop date, sexy night in, hay ride, gardening (not 'gardening'), antique shopping


**Bucolic**

*Notes: sheep wool, lanolin, raspberry, lavender, honey, brown sugar, amber, beeswax, sweetgrass.*


Initial Thoughts:


I smell like a sheep!!! Weird! I didn’t know I knew what a sheep smells like but it’s this! Oily and a bit nutty and dried out hay. This reminds me of Perfume a story of a murderer and how the dude made perfume out of piss and shit to make himself smell human. It doesn’t smell like bodily fluids for the record, just animalic in a way that’s hard to describe or wrap my mind around? Also I reference this book too much, my b. 


1 month retest:


Yep. Sheep. Kind of a golden, buttery, salty, animalic thing going on. Yes, a little reminiscent of corn chips. I get a lot more beeswax now, which is cool! I never thought I’d say this but it reads as a clean animalic scent- there’s very little funk and it feels somehow fresh. I think the lavender is coming through in a very herbal way and adding some brightness to balance. 


Where would I wear this?: Corn maze/fall festival, actually shook myself with the corn association and can’t escape it now (as you see in the retest notes lol). You know when a dog's foot smells like corn chips? Yeah. 


**Ponderosa**

*Notes: Ponderosa resin, ponderosa needles, cedar, vanilla, strawberry, cinnamon, butterscotch, beeswax, raisin cookies.*


Initial Thoughts:


An immediate fave. I cannot wait for this to age and to wear it in earnest. Very crisp and borderline incense with a cinnamon craft store heart that I am extremely into. 


1 month retest:


Getting vague froot- couldn’t pin it as strawberries or raisins, but there’s something bright underneath the resiny current. The cinnamon has really calmed down and this is much more waxy now! It’s weird how this changes honestly. It is more jammy than crisp now as the butterscotch comes into play. On drydown it’s sooo soft and sweet- like GENUINELY sweet. It’s a really nice interplay between the resins and sugar. This is like. Being inside of a cookie that a witch is baking in the woods. Amazing.


Where would I wear this?: every day. To bed. All of hoa hoa hoa season. Actually not too out there and could wear to work. Getting less specific instances of when I’d wear this which is funny because I like it so much? Maybe I don’t want to limit it with narrow associations idk.


**Subalpine** 

*Notes: subalpine fir, bergamot, black pepper, cedar leaf (thuja), sandalwood, vetiver, ambrette, moss.*


Initial Thoughts:


I get a big blast of sandwood and fir, but nothing else to speak of initially. I think this needs some rest or my nose needs a break. 


1 month retest:


This is soo bright! It reminds me of something….maybe tomato leaf? Something about it is super herbal, it’s definitely like crushing up some kinda leaf in your hands. It’s very pungent and almost bitter or camphorous on application. I get a ton of black pepper and the oak moss peeks out on drydown, but it’s very dry and severe as opposed to fresh and springy as I usually perceive it. The whole scent actually reads as very serious, whatever that means. It’s a hard one to describe!


When would I wear this?: Ice skating, snowball fight, cheese making class, outdoor events in December, when giving a presentation 


**Murkwood**

*Notes: fir balsam, black hemlock, lapsang souchong, moss, incense, bitter myrrh.*


Initial Thoughts:


Oh hey another foresty scent (shocked Pikachu face)! I like it but it kind of smells like model lumberjack. A lumberjack that works at Abercrombie and calls himself a model (does anyone else remember when that was a thing?). 


1 month retest:


This is such a crazy grey color on the skin! This is loud. Sour. Bitter. Spicy. Woodsy. Smoked. Smells like a tea an Appalachian folk healer would give you. Actually, kind of reminds me of DS & Durga’s Mississippi Medicine now that I mention it! This is so…*gestures wildly*

  I love it actually BUT. It did remain visible on my skin, which is unusual, and left a bit of an oily sheen. I typically spray on clothes but I will definitely skip with this! Even with black I wouldn’t risk an oil stain. It’s too bad because I feel it would shine as a cold weather scent and won’t project much from skin, but at least you won’t see the splotch from where you applied it


Where would I wear this?: to the mall, Halloween movie date, concert, craft fair, rooftop coffee bar 


**Caravansary**

*Notes: fir balsam, deer musk (botanic accord), vanilla, black tea, lavender, blue spruce, blue chamomile, treemoss, incense, mulched pinecone, campfire smoke.*


Initial Thoughts:


Oh hey ANOTHER foresty scent! I love it. Gonna have to try and narrow these down more..I'm sure they'll change more after aging. I really dig the smoke and there's almost a jammy element to it, a honey-like depth. I think this is my fave so far...but I still have 4 more to test! 


1 month retest: 


Another really green (like…physically) fragrance. This is very cozy, like a blanket that’s been left outside on a crisp night. I get a ton of honey and then a very cozy cashmere like aspect. It’s a light honey, airy with lavender, and I get a bit of chamomile as it dries down. Sooo deliciously cozy, I just wish it didn’t look like a big ass bruise on my skin. 


Where would I wear this?: Thrift shopping, being mysterious in the summer, on a community hike, bookshop date, crisp fall mornings


**Holy Cross**

*Notes: bluebell, watercress, lichen*


Initial Thoughts:


I received this as a free sample, and initially dismissed it thinking it would be your standard ""church scent"" (I was raised Baptist so frankincense and myrrh does nothing for me except smell like every other frankincense and myrrh scent. Very boring to me). It definitely took a wild turn from my expectations! It reads as a musty-rotted, almost-wood. Kind of salty, smoky, springy flora. 


1 month retest:

This is weird!!! It has a harshness reminiscent of rubber or oil, underpinned by rotting wood and somehow fresh water. I do not know how to explain this. It’s like being at a lakeside cabin in spring, passing by someone tinkering with their boat at the dock.


Where would I wear this?: When EA's Bluegrass feels too put together, post bath/shower in the middle of summer, school auditorium, shoe shopping


**Apple Tabac**

*Notes: fresh red apple, tobacco, fir balsam, rum resin, dried fruits.*


Initial Thoughts:


Huh it IS kinda apple-y! I don't have many apple perfumes so I was curious how this would come across. Crisp, fresh apple? Baked apple? Candle apple? This is rich apple peels, helped with their intensity I'm sure by the rum and dried fruits. The tobacco is a strudy bridge throughout. 


1 month retest: 


This is a really nice um…apple tobacco scent. Kind of maple-y. This is a very juicy fresh apple! It really brightens this blend up, and although you might think the apple would make it feel more seasonal, it actually makes it feel more suitable for year round. It’s a cool scent, somewhat grassy.


Where would I wear this?: To a brewery, a castle tour, to kill god, ambiance while playing a medieval game


**Noki**

*Notes: Lychee, Mango, Mint, Rhubarb, Cassis, Sandalwood, Ambergris*.


Initial Thoughts:


I can pick out the lychee in this! That's cool. I get a lot of the rhubarb as well. This is fruity without being FROOT. Fruity without summoning the ghost of Britney Spears Fantasy. It has a lot of fuzzy-skin complexity and gets brighter and well...more FUN on drydown. 


1 month retest:


Ahhh I love this. So green and bright and fresh, yet there’s a richness that contrasts it all. Imagine a mixed assortment of gummy bears were a real fruit. This is the skin of that fruit. Almost has a green mango thing going on with a white tea backing. I get a lot of smoothness from the sandalwood!


Where would I wear this?: Glowering poolside, on the hottest day of summer, work/travel, girls night out


**Cotswold**

*Notes: cedar, smoke, oakwood, ponderosa pine needles, black spruce, vanilla, hops.*


Initial Thoughts:


This permeates my office when I spray it- I'm immediately obsessed. Very smoky but in a round wood way, not in a salty bbq way. The vanilla comes through to smooth everything over and makes it so so glorious. Holy fucking fuck that fucking scent of yours is insane.


1 month retest:


Something about this is foul to me at the moment, and I'm wondering if it's a hormonal thing since I loved it so much on the initial test. The smoke has gotten an artificial and acrid tang to it. It smells something like a tire fire. I love smoke scents but there’s an oiliness to it that is not jiving with me. Dramatic (and only) thumbs down. 


Where would I wear this?: Late summer days, chilly autumn nights, cabin-adjacent activities


**Hayloft**

*Notes: hay, lavender, honey, crocus, sweet vernalgrass, bison grass, toasted almond, hazelnut, oats, dusty wheat.*


Initial Thoughts:


This is so wearable and sweet. It isn't as cookie-y as Shire, nor as sweet, but it's very pleasent. I need to test this more to accurately gage the difference.  


1 month retest:


This is definitely related to shire! It comes across as bamboo like to me, not really sure why but it makes me think of hiking in the bamboo forests in summer. There’s definitely a salty element, and some wildflowers the a breeze has carried from far away.


Where would I wear this?: doctor's office, cozy sweater weather, going to a fancy bakery, running errands in the fall




*Final thoughts*: Wow, that was a LOT! Sorry and thank you if you read all of this! I really enjoyed this house, and writing reviews was definitely a good way to evaluate each scent. Typically I just throw things in a box and forget about them, so I'm going to try and write reviews more often so I can actually get a handle on my collection. I loved the artistry of these scents and am going to upgrade at least one sample (Coffee Tabac, maybe Ponderosa)! The only downside to me was that several of them were so potent and, er, *natural* that they left a stain on my skin. Hard to actually dock points for this, but it does make them less ""easy to wear"". I would definitely try more, as my whole family (including my 10 year old!) enjoyed the experience, which was very fun! I would definitely like to try more from this house in the future, and I'm glad I had such a high hit rate with the samples even if I don't necessarily need to own the full size of them!",18,1760626268.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

Want to add a little something extra to your coloring page — a prop, accessory, or playful detail?  
That’s what the **Objects** section in **Creative Controls** is for.  

Objects help you enrich your main subject with meaningful or decorative elements, without having to rewrite your entire prompt.

---

### 🎨 What You Can Do with Objects

Use the preset ideas (you might see things like *flowers*, *books*, *toys*, *stars*, etc.)  
or type your own object ideas directly into the text box.  

You can add:
- Small accent items like *balloons*, *leaves*, *sparkles*  
- Contextual props like *coffee mugs*, *books*, or *musical instruments*  
- Scene enhancers like *clouds*, *trees*, or *lanterns*

---

### 💡 Tips for Great Results

- Stick to **1–3 key objects** — too many can clutter your scene.  
- Keep object descriptions short and clear (e.g., “holding a bouquet of tulips” or “with stars floating around”).  
- Combine with a **Style** and **Background** for stronger storytelling.  
- If something feels misplaced, regenerate with slightly different phrasing.  

---

### 🌟 Example Prompts to Try

- “Cat wearing glasses and sitting next to a coffee mug”  
- “Girl holding a bunch of balloons under a tree”  
- “Dragon surrounded by treasure and candles”  
- “Garden scene with butterflies and lanterns”

But for some reason.. when I feel a bipolar episode coming on and the panic sets in or the depression... I drink a cup of coffee and it calms me right down. I do not drink much coffee whatsoever. Some in the morning, and some at night. Usually at night time around 7PM-9PM is when I start to get really anxious and struggle.

I am on a copious amount of meds. Mostly all taken at night time for sleep. I haven't had coffee in months but I've noticed every single time I start to have an episode... if I so happen to be drinking coffee... I calm down almost immediately. All studies online say STAY CLEAR of caffeine if you are Bipolar. This does not remotely seem to be the case for me. It was only by random chance I noticed it calmed me down and now I am using a cup of coffee when I feel an episode coming on to relieve my stress. And I'll be damned, it's working.

In a great sea of websites saying not to do this... I only found 1 that mentioned how caffeine affects the nervous system and this could be the reason why. I'm sure human biology makes us all similar and most certainly we are all wired a little differently. For now, until further research is done on myself...

She was my childhood friend's bridesmaids. Over the week we got to know each, dance, laugh, hangout etc. On the last night we branch off from the group for a while and I asked her out. My personality is a bit sarcastic and I troll a lot. But she told me she never had a boyfriend because she has a particular type (Religious ). She has never had a boyfriend in her life. I didn't want to push too much, but im not the best Christian But I do try or rather try to be a better person each and every do.

The conversation didn't end there, she had an interesting note on the back of her phone so I asked her about it and in short I was something her friend who passed away from suicide gave her. She was tearing up and I shared a similar story in my life of losing a love one. We open up to one another. We did end up exchanging number. First time I asked out a woman in YEARS! And first time really opened up to someone who isn't my brother

Were bonding having deep convo and make up. The following day we depart and I text her two days after generic ""hey it was nice meeting you, when you're back in town we should get coffee or dinner"". And I haven't heard from her via text (1 week now).

1o87zus,https://i.redd.it/3yqzilq4khvf1.jpeg,I got my job back after I made the rash mistake of quitting without a back up,"I worked at a hotel as a housekeeper for two years now. The first year it was hard but I was a good employee. The second year, I was getting really tired of the job. It’s physically taxing to constantly clean so many rooms every single day. There’s a lot I do like about it, the quiet and solitary work, the free tea, coffee milk, sometimes breakfast, but I still wasn’t getting paid enough, I’ve worked secondary jobs along side it to make bills, and I’ve had an unpleasant experience with some of the coworkers(but who doesnt) Anyway I had seen many people come and go and this is the longest I’ve worked at a job. I just felt like it was my time to go. I wasn’t reaching my board times as much, had slept in and came in later more often, was losing track of my scheduled days. I was just slipping a lot. They announced several months ago that they were now working on a point system to improve scores and ratings. I didn’t care much since I had been looking to replace this job with a higher paying one that was also full time. I didn’t want to quit until then but I knew my points for termination were stacking up and I had to find something else fast. I started getting interviews which they did let me take the days off for. The other jobs contacted me at unexpected times and scheduled the interviews in the morning so it’s a hassle for them to suddenly schedule me off. Other than that I could still come into work, but then my cars engine stopped. 

The cars “check engine” light had been on for weeks and I could barely keep up with repairs with how much they cost. I thought it’d had finally gone kaput and this was when I was headed to my interview of the higher paying job. I was panicky but decided to take an uber. I called the employer to let him know my situation but assure him I was coming but he just rescheduled. I posted a vent stressed about it on Reddit and got a lot of replies saying there was no way he was going to actually reschedule since I had already shown to be unreliable. This made me feel even way worse, but I thought they were right. I was so scared to tell my hotel job the situation letting yet another employer down. I was convinced they were annoyed with my inconsistency and would just terminate me if I told them. I texted my hotel job to let them know I’m not coming back because of my transportation issues, and that I didn’t know how or when I was going to to be able to get it fixed. 

Luckily I do live with my sister who helps me but we still have to split rent and she doesn’t have a car. (She has her own way of making money) I started frantically applying and asking for jobs around me that were walking distance. (If it should even be called that in a city with no sidewalks) There’s a small plaza near me I can walk to. All of the jobs were either not hiring or hiring at other locations I had to drive to. I was really losing hope until I decided to give my car another run. It ran. Then realized it was a colder day that time I tried to drive to my interview. My engine definitely does still need a check up but it wasn’t going kaput just because. I just needed to warm it up more for it to go. I drive it around my complex to make sure it wouldn’t shut down when I drove it a few feet like it previously did. It ran ok. I remember someone also suggested somewhere that I ask for the job back and thinking of doing that made me feel so embarrassed. But I had to if I couldn’t secure a job yet. So I did. I texted my employer that I know that I said I had quit but that my issue was resolved. She said ok but I had to talk to the higher up on Monday to make sure he hadn’t turned in any termination papers. It had only been a day, so I figured he hadn’t yet. (And he didn’t) Also, that same evening I DID get a text from the employer everyone told me wouldn’t reschedule: “Hey, 10am tomorrow” things quickly were looking up for me but God I felt so stupid to cause myself so much unnecessary depression and anxiety. It was Saturday so whether I was going to have either  job felt like a looong waiting game, or what felt like it, and I was just in bed anxious all day barely able to eat or sleep, or focus on anything else.

In short they did accept me back and found out they didn’t hate me as much as I thought and were actually glad to have me back. But they did say I needed to step up, and I decided not to take the higher paying job due to them specifically wanting someone who had availability at 3am and 4am times, and they were having a bunch of management issues. (That wasn’t my first interview with them the other employer quit and I had to be re-interviewed by someone different) I’m now looking for a second job again and I’m clinging on to this one and putting my best effort forward until I’m able to reach my goals.  That was my awful chaotic weekend. Lesson of the day check your mental health and don’t lose hope. I don’t know who the hell is reading all this but thank you lol.

1o87vv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1o87vv4/some_tips_which_can_help_you_with_racing_thoughts/,Some tips which can help you with racing thoughts.,"1. Absolutely no caffeine - no coffees, no energy drinks because they make you lose sleep and can definitely cause anxiety and racing thoughts.

2. No music (less loud noises) - i always loved listening to music daily until I realized it triggers my anxiety and even anger. Listening to loud music before going to bed can definitely trigger your insomnia and do damage to your mental health

3. Dont do vigorous exercise in the morning - it can stress you additionally and make you nervous. Maybe you can leave it for the afternoon once your nervous system is calmer.

4. Find if anything else stresses you out - if there are any thoughts or worries you have - write them down and stop overthinking everything. Id recommend a book called ""anticipatory anxiety"" even though the topic is not exactly schizophrenia.

5. (Optional) Try to do something relaxing - maybe read some pages of a book, do sudoku puzzles or journal - anything which can help you distract yourself and it doesnt involve scrolling. I know this may feel as a difficult step at first so please dont force yourself but take it one step at a time...

I hope this helps someone feel better. 😊",2,1760625449.0,schizophrenia,0,1.0,False

While the Avengers clashed against cosmic threats and defended major cities across the globe, one place was quietly overlooked — the Hawaiian Islands. Though its people were kind and spirited, Hawaii was often left unnoticed in the grand scheme of global defense. Yet, destiny had other plans.

In the quiet town of **Kailua-Kona**, on the Big Island, five teenage girls stood at the heart of a struggling community that had built its own homes after storms and economic hardship had left many families homeless. Their parents worked long hours in coffee farms, construction, and cleaning resorts, barely scraping by. The town’s unity was its greatest strength — neighbors helped neighbors, and the children learned from volunteers and elders instead of traditional schools.

The five girls were like sisters, raised together by the village itself.

* **Leilani Kaʻuhane (17)** – The calm and compassionate one. Her father was a fisherman lost at sea, and her mother ran a small fruit stand. Leilani loved the stars and dreamed of exploring space. She often climbed the hills at night to gaze up and wonder if someone was looking back.
* **Kiana Lau (18)** – Adventurous and daring, she was known for free-diving into dangerous waters and surfing the wildest waves. Her father, a mechanic, and her mother, a nurse, barely had time for her, but Kiana’s spirit was unbreakable.
* **Nohea Kalama (16)** – Quiet and observant, she was a tech genius even without formal education. Her family once owned a repair shop that went bankrupt, but she taught herself from scrap electronics. She could make anything from junk.
* **Malia Kealoha (17)** – Strong-willed and competitive, she had a natural instinct for leadership. Her mother was a single parent who worked at a hotel. Malia helped her with chores every day, but her true strength was her unyielding determination to protect her friends.
* **Pua Aulani (15)** – The youngest, sweet but mysterious. Her family was one of the poorest, yet she was always smiling. She felt a strange connection to electricity and machines since childhood, as though they responded to her emotions.

The community called them *Nā Hōkū ʻOpio* — *The Young Stars* — because even in darkness, they shone.

# Chapter 2: The Crash in the Jungle

One warm evening, after helping elders rebuild a roof, the girls decided to explore the upper slopes of **Hualālai Volcano**, where legends spoke of falling stars. The wind whispered through the palm trees, and a strange hum filled the air.

“Leilani… you hear that?” Kiana whispered.

They followed the noise until they stumbled upon a crater — metallic, ancient, and overgrown with vines. It wasn’t a meteor… it was a *ship*.

Inside, they found symbols glowing blue across its hull — alien writing pulsing like a heartbeat. Nohea brushed her hand against a smooth console, and the ship lit up.

>

A hologram flickered before them — a message from an alien civilization known as the **Kūlapae**, beings of light and sound from the distant system of **Kaonari Prime**. They were explorers who had fled a war among the stars, searching for peace on distant worlds. But their ship was damaged by an energy storm and crash-landed on Earth, centuries ago — here, in Hawaii.

The hologram’s final words echoed:

>

At the center of the room floated a glowing crystalline orb — *The Stone of Kaʻehua*. Its energy pulsed like a living heart.

# Chapter 3: The Awakening

When the girls touched the Stone, it unleashed a surge of pure cosmic energy that coursed through their bodies. The ship roared to life, and they were thrown backward, their vision flooding with light and ancient voices.

They awoke the next morning back in their village. The sky was calm again — but they were not the same.

* **Malia** felt the pull of gravity around her fingertips. When she clenched her fist, the ground trembled. She could leap incredible heights and lift boulders.
* **Kiana** discovered her body could vanish into her surroundings, blending perfectly with the environment. When she ran, she blurred like wind — faster than the eye could see.
* **Nohea**, her mind expanded — she could *see* equations, circuitry, and alien logic instantly. Within days, she began constructing a **suit of armor** using the alien wreckage. It was sleek, black and silver, powered by *Kūlapae nanocrystals* that absorbed and redirected energy. Her AI companion, which she named **Keaka**, spoke to her through the suit and helped her design flight systems and defensive shields.
* **Leilani**’s vision changed — her pupils turned golden, and she could see miles away, tracking motion with eagle-like precision. But more than that, she could *transform*. Feathers spread from her arms, scales along her skin — she could shift parts of her body into animal forms or change her entire shape into another creature.
* **Pua**, the youngest, discovered she could merge with machines. She touched a broken drone and it came to life. The more she connected with technology, the more she could control — cars, boats, even power grids. She was the living link between organic life and electricity.

The community was stunned but protective. They knew the world wasn’t ready to understand. Together, the elders helped craft costumes for the girls using island fabrics and alien material Nohea adapted.

When they finally stood side by side, they called themselves:

>

# Chapter 4: Protectors of the Pacific

They made a vow — to protect Hawaii from threats no one else cared about. Using the alien tech, Nohea built a **portal device** that allowed them to teleport between islands — Maui, Oʻahu, Kauaʻi, and beyond.

Their first mission came sooner than expected. Reports surfaced of **pirates smuggling human cargo** across the Pacific. When the girls tracked the ships, they found the traffickers were working for **A.I.M.** — Advanced Idea Mechanics — testing a new form of energy stolen from the Kūlapae wreckage.

>

Over the crashing waves, their powers united.

* Malia crushed the ship’s deck with a gravity pulse.
* Kiana blurred through the crew like a ghost, disarming them in seconds.
* Leilani soared overhead as a hawk, diving into the fight with precision.
* Pua merged into a turret and turned it against the pirates.
* Nohea hovered in her armor, firing energy blasts that disabled engines without harming the captives.

When it was done, the trafficked victims were freed. The girls disappeared into the mist before the Coast Guard arrived.

# Chapter 5: Rising Storms

News spread across Hawaii of mysterious saviors — five glowing figures who appeared and vanished like spirits. Some called them *angels of the islands*. Others whispered that they were *aliens*.

But the truth was closer to home — they were the children of Hawaii, blessed with cosmic power, forged by hardship, and united by aloha.

Unknown to them, however, something else had awakened beneath the sea — a surviving fragment of the Kūlapae AI, corrupted by A.I.M.’s experiments. It called itself **KALA-NUI**, and it wanted the Stone back.

The Stars of Kona’s journey had only begun…

Would you like me to continue this story into **Part 2: “The Return of KALA-NUI”**, where the girls face their first major villain and begin to connect with the wider Marvel Universe (like S.W.O.R.D. and Wakanda)?Title: Nā Hōkū o Kona: The Stars of Hawaii

1o87vct,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1o87vct/aio_that_i_am_thinking_about_breaking_contact/,"AIO, that I am thinking about breaking contact with my mom?","So I (f19) am on a small vacation with my two sisters let's call them H(14) and B(21) for context sake, with our mother(46). It was my mother's idea so ""we girls"" could ""reconnect"", since I have moved out when I was 14 (For my own physical and mental wellbeing). 
For some background me and my sisters had/have all a pretty rough childhood, both our parents but mostly in particular our father were abusive since birth. But honestly  I think I've got to feel  most of it. I think they couldn't deal with my physical and mental disabilities, and I look a lot like my father so he projected all his self hatred onto me. 
So to the current  situation, it's the last day of our vacation and I feel like total shit. B and my Mom have been drinking last night, you may ask how I know? Well today when I woke up the dining table in our airbnb had still all th the alcohol, the glasses and food scattered all across it. So i went into the kitchen to gather cleaning supplies, but the kitchen looked even worse . The trash cans overflowing, dirty dishes piling in the sink and what looked like dried coffee spills on the floor (this is our 3rd day here). 
I just wanted to make us breakfast since it was already 10 am and I couldn't find my  mom because she was out Jogging. 
So I get to work. 
I mean no big deal right? A 19 year old should be able to help around the house and do some dishes, but it becomes a big deal when you're the only one doing these chores most of the time.
And that is where I might be wrong, 
I feel like I am being used again, like before I moved out. Only I am bothered knowing of when where and what we are going to eat. Because if I don't (like yesterday) we don't have dinner until almost 9:30 pm and it was what was left over from breakfast, because my lovely mom was too busy calling her new boyfriend for 3 hours. 
But what about my older sister? She could do something right? Nope, she doesn't, she just laid  in her bed scrolling on her phone. 
And it feels like I am the only person in this small apartment that feels responsible. And I know I shouldn't be, years of therapy have taught me that I am allowed to expect something from people. 
And I expect my mother to act like an adult and not like how I should act at 19. 

But I know I just could be triggered a lot right now and that my emotions could  cloud my judgement of reality. But that doesn't explain why my mother is out shopping right now with B. And I am here with H essentially baby sitting her. 


So am I overreacting or just triggered as hell?


FYI my mom gets angry or/and offended when I call her out on her behaviour and tells me ""it's just my own mind showing me things that aren't there.""

I should add I don't have any contact to my dad any more, and had broken communication to my mom from 2021-2023. Because I need distance to prosses and reached out to her again when I met up with B. And she said our mom misses me and she had changed. I believed and and for a time also saw some of that work she put into herself but, since this summer I get the feeling that she hasn't changed at all and just out up an act.",1,1760625415.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

My workouts are usually around 12pm and I’ll eat around 2pm. But it’s been miserable. Yeah I’ve lost 30 pounds in the last 45 days which is great but I know at the end of the day it’s all been from a caloric deficit. The first few weeks my workouts were great but the last 3 weeks or so it’s been such a drag and so miserable. I recently tried switching to night workouts so I could eat before, but those sessions suck too because I’m just mentally drained by the end of the day.

I’ve been in this mindset that I have to stick with strict OMAD or else I won’t lose weight. But I’m starting to think it’s just not working for me. I’ve been thinking of switching to a 20:4 instead — maybe have coffee and a small pre-workout meal around 10am, then hit the gym at noon and eat my main meal around 1–2pm and be done for the day.

Would that still be effective for fat loss? Or does anyone else feel like strict OMAD killed their energy and workouts?",8,1760625381.0,intermittentfasting,29,0.9,False

This cleansing juice is just lemon, ginger and cayenne pepper. If I don’t go for a day or 2, I would drink the juice and then go. Not to be gross but it works. I would think it’s probably safer than anything else since it’s juice? I drink a lot of water every day, at least 90oz plus 1 cup of coffee. ",0,1760625251.0,Zepbound,4,0.4,False

Recently, I got a bit lazy about getting my blood tests done, and when I finally did, my TSH had risen to 90. It was quite a shock. I consulted an endocrinologist, who prescribed 100 mcg of medication and advised me to cut out gluten and dairy. He also recommended supplements for iron, selenium, magnesium, and omega-3s.

He explained that the chronic inflammation I’m dealing with can only be reduced through supplements and lifestyle changes.

I’m so used to having coffee with milk in the morning. What do you all do instead? What lifestyle changes and supplements have helped you get things back to normal?",1,1760625117.0,Hypothyroidism,0,1.0,False
