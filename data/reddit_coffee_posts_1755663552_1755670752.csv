by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Mets vs. Nationals: A Tale of Two Slides (One’s a Waterpark, the Other’s a Hamster Wheel)**

The New York Mets (66-58) and Washington Nationals (50-74) collide in a clash of NL East fates, where the Mets aim to end a six-game road losing streak while the Nationals hope to avoid becoming the first team since the 2012 Tampa Bay Rays to lose 80 games and host a *Jeopardy* clue about their existence. Let’s break this down with the precision of a MLB umpire and the humor of a concession stand juggling hot dogs and existential dread.

---

### Parse the Odds: Why the Mets Are the Favorite (and the Nationals Are Just Here for the Snacks)

The betting markets are as clear as a postgame press conference with Max Scherzer: the Mets are heavy favorites. Decimal odds of **1.54-1.6** (implied probability: **62-64%**) suggest bookmakers view this as a “formality with a side of optimism for the underdogs.” The Nationals, priced at **2.42-2.67** (implied **38-41%**), are about as likely to win as a person convincing a group chat that 2005 was the ’90s.

The spread (-1.5 for the Mets) reflects the Mets’ superior pitching and batting, while the total runs line (8.5-9) hints at a game where “low-scoring” means *fewer* than the Nationals’ ERA allows. For context, Washington’s 5.34 ERA is so porous, it’s basically a sieve that also tweets existential complaints.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Rivalries, and the Curse of the “Almost Good”

The Mets enter with **David Peterson (3.30 ERA)** on the mound, a pitcher who’s as reliable as a coffee shop barista on a Monday. Opposing him is **Jake Irvin (5.14 ERA)**, whose ERA is so high, it’s practically a ZIP code for “where did this game go wrong?” Peterson’s 3.30 ERA is a tidy number, like a well-folded laundry pile. Irvin’s 5.14? That’s a stack of unfolded socks: chaotic, avoidable, and slightly concerning.

On the offensive side, the Mets’ **Pete Alonso (.268 BA, 28 HRs)** is a human missile launcher, while the Nationals’ **C.J. Abrams (.270 BA, 16 HRs)** is a leadoff man with the power of a “maybe” and the speed of a “definitely not.” The Mets also boast **Juan Soto** (baseball’s version of a golden retriever—unstoppable, lovable, and occasionally napping in the wrong spot) and \*\*Francisco Lin

How absolutely *precious* that you would consider yourself worthy of apprenticeship in the refined art of frozen confectionery acquisition. Truly, your confidence is... endearing, in the way that a child's crayon drawing is ""art.""

I fear you have gravely misunderstood the caliber of operation with which you seek association. This is not some ham-fisted smash-and-grab popsicle scheme that one simply... stumbles into after watching a few YouTube tutorials. The delicate orchestration of premium gelato liberation requires decades of training, an exquisite palate for quality assessment, and—dare I say—a certain je ne sais quoi that simply cannot be taught to the masses.

Your enthusiasm, while quaint, betrays a fundamental ignorance of the sophisticated methodologies involved. Do you even know the proper temperature differential required for optimal Häagen-Dazs extraction? Have you studied the intricate security patterns of artisanal ice cream parlors? Can you distinguish between a Ben & Jerry's Chunky Monkey and a store-brand imitation while blindfolded at thirty paces?

I thought not.

Perhaps you might find fulfillment in more... beginner-friendly pursuits? I hear the frozen yogurt circuit is quite forgiving to novices. Or maybe start with something truly entry-level—stolen packets of sugar from coffee shops?

When you've mastered the fundamentals and developed something approaching actual competence, do feel free to resubmit your application. In perhaps a decade or two.

I dreamt of the [redacted] mountain range last night. It almost seemed as though I was flying. I enjoy when I’m carried away in dreams. It feels weightless, and like I can breathe. So I soared through the cloudless sky and I see you in the colors that shine. The sky rang with hues of pink. Bold purples shown and they were vividly distinct. They cradled the mountain in such a way that seemed to leave its curves free from life’s decay. And as I sit here and enjoy my coffee with the breezes chill, it drifts to my skin to make me feel. 

So I start to feel the butterflies in my stomach frantically, as I consider the power in the core of the earth just casually. Like how it feeds its spherical body like a well loved thing, to provide us with the breeze that’s calm and cooling. It astounds me that such magic exists. That the trees still breathe through our very human tragic messes. That the birds still sing their comforting notes, while the sun beams and heals in Vitamin D which darkens our tones.

All day long, my cat acts like the mysterious roommate who barely acknowledges my existence. But the second the sun peeks through the blinds in the morning—boom. Suddenly I’ve got a furry alarm clock jumping on the bed, staring at me like I’m the love of their life. So what’s the deal? Why do cats go from aloof royalty to needy toddlers at sunrise?

**1. Their body clock is different from ours.**  
Cats are crepuscular (fancy word for “most active at dawn and dusk”). While we’re groggy and desperate for coffee, they’re wide awake and ready to party. After burning off energy during the night, morning is prime time for them to come looking for attention (or breakfast).

**2. Breakfast = love.**  
Let’s be real—half of that “affection” is just them saying *“hey, human vending machine, feed me.”* By the time you’re waking up, they’ve already been hungry for hours, and what better way to remind you than by being ridiculously cute?

**3. Emotional bonding.**  
It’s not *all* about food, though. Cats often feel safest and most connected during calm, quiet times—like early mornings when the house is still. Curling up next to you, meowing, or pawing at your face is their way of saying: *“You’re my person.”* It’s both sweet and manipulative, which is basically peak cat behavior.

**✨ The takeaway:**  
Your “cold and distant” cat isn’t two-faced—they just pick mornings to show their softer side. Think of it as their version of a love confession… conveniently timed right before breakfast.

So, does your cat also become a stage-5 clinger in the morning, or is mine secretly auditioning for the role of “most dramatic alarm clock”?",1,1755670113.0,u_MICHUPETUS,0,1.0,False

1mv6n19,https://www.reddit.com/r/PercyJacksonfanfic/comments/1mv6n19/2/,2,"# Chapter 2 — Nothing Says Normal Like Pancakes and Rainbows

*(Percy’s POV)*

You’d think after stopping a Titan war, I’d get a punch card for free naps and a lifetime supply of not being chased. Maybe a beach somewhere, a hammock, a Coke with one of those tiny umbrellas. Instead, I got exactly three things: pancakes, homework, and a creeping feeling like the ground under my feet was trying to remember my name.

Pancakes first. My mom’s Saturday-morning pancakes are how New York should open the Stock Exchange. Warm butter smell drifting down our hallway, radio low, the kind of blue sky that makes pigeons act extra judgmental. Mom flipped the griddle cake with a little wrist snap and said, “Eat, honey. First week back at school—fuel up.” She kissed the top of my head and pretended like feeding a demigod was the same as feeding a normal sophomore who didn’t occasionally sword-fight in subway tunnels.

Paul sat at the table grading essays, red pen flying. He had that calm, indestructible thing going, like if the fire alarm went off he’d just stack the papers and finish his coffee before leaving. “You got this, Percy,” he said, not looking up. “Don’t let Ms. Villareal catch you daydreaming.”

“I never daydream,” I said around a mouthful of blueberry. “I night-dream. Totally different.”

Mom slid another pancake on my plate. She didn’t say “be careful,” because she knows that makes the universe jealous. She just squeezed my shoulder in a way that said both be careful and also eat more, you’re skinny even for a kid who fights monsters.

Then school happened. It’s weird how after you’ve run through burning labyrinths and ridden hellhounds, hallways still make your stomach do that annoying nervous flip. I think it’s the lockers. They stare at you like metal trees full of squirrels that hoard algebra homework.

Paul’s English class was on the third floor. He did the whole “I am completely unbiased and do not know this young man” routine that fooled exactly zero people, and somehow it still helped. He got everyone laughing about metaphors and Macbeth instead of looking at me like I was an undiscovered species of trouble.

I pulled off a week of normal. No empousai cheerleaders. No hellhounds during gym. There was a kid who threw up in the cafeteria on Thursday, but I’m ninety percent sure that was regular human biology and not ancient evil. I even raised my hand once to answer a question about Odysseus, which felt a little like talking about an old family embarrassment. Yes, sir, he was clever; also he made terrible choices and he and I are not friends.

If the story ended there, we would all live happily ever after in a very boring book. But the dreams started on day six.

I’ve had bad dreams before. Prophecy dreams usually come with cheap special effects—green fog, a chorus line of doom. These were different. No fog. No gods. Just dirt. Cracked earth, wide as an ocean and as thirsty. In the middle, a seam opening like a mouth. I heard a whisper from below, low and old and annoyed, like the world was speaking through its teeth: rise. wake. my children. break your chains.

I woke up with my sheets damp and the apartment smelling like low tide. There were wet footprints on the floor that looked suspiciously not my size, leading to the fire escape. When I opened the window, the city breathed in my face—steam from a grate, a siren, someone yelling at someone else in a language I didn’t speak—and for a second I thought I saw the streetlamp’s shadow bend toward me like a cat arching its back.

Fun.

I did what any rational person would do: I didn’t tell my mom. I also didn’t tell Annabeth, because she was in construction-overlord mode, which is scarier than Ares on a bad day. Camp Half-Blood was a full-time build site. We’d won the war, then I’d used my one big wish to force the gods to claim all their kids and give them cabins. Turns out that meant actual cabins. Plural. For minor gods too. Annabeth had a bronze clipboard and a laser pointer and an expression that told nails they were about to be hammered for insubordination.

When I Iris-messaged, there was always shouting in the background. Nothing violent, just the normal chaos of satyrs arguing with nymphs about where to plant a fig tree that didn’t want to be planted. Annabeth would tuck hair behind her ear with the hand that wasn’t directing a crane. “Can I call you back?” she’d say, voice all business. “I’m up to my eyebrows in Athena-to-Nemesis sight lines.”

“Are sight lines a thing?” I said.

“They are now.”

I almost told her about the dream anyway, because if anybody can out-logic a nightmare, it’s Annabeth. But her forehead already had that wrinkle that meant she was counting beams. I didn’t want to add “unsettling whispers from the dirt” to her to-do list.

The city started acting weird in little ways. Humid afternoons that felt like the sidewalks were sweating. Pigeons lifting in concentric circles for no reason, then landing together like they’d practiced. In the deli on 96th, the man behind the counter stared at me too long. His eyes didn’t blink right. Later, when no one was around, I went back. He smelled like wet dog and seaweed. When he saw Riptide in my hand, he made a sound like a clogged drain.

“Not here,” he gurgled, throat widening, teeth going pointy. “The Earth Mother doesn’t like noise.”

“Cool,” I said. “I don’t like you.”

He grabbed for me over the counter. I stepped aside and let him taste Celestial bronze. He crumbled into yellow dust that made the rug look like it had a pollen allergy. I capped my pen and stared at the ceiling tiles while I waited for the Mist to do its thing. Mortal memory would turn that fight into something else—maybe a burst pipeline, maybe a raccoon. New York is very talented at explaining itself.

On the way home, the subway hummed wrong. Not wrong-wrong. Just…like the rails were singing a note too low for human ears and I was the only one who heard the harmony. I wasn’t looking for trouble. Trouble doesn’t care.

Mom noticed I wasn’t sleeping, because moms do. She made more pancakes. I tried to lie, but lying to my mom is like trying to surf on a brick. “Nightmares?” she asked, handing me the syrup.

“Stress,” I said. “School. The usual.”

“Monsters.”

“Probably,” I said. “There was a deli situation. I handled it.”

She chewed her lip and nodded like she was filing a report in her head. My mom is the bravest person I know, mostly because she keeps letting me leave the apartment at all. “You tell Annabeth?”

“She’s busy.”

“Percy,” Mom said, soft and firm at the same time, “being busy is what you both do. You still talk.”

I did call. I swear. I told Annabeth I missed her and she said she missed me too, and then she said, “Sorry, what did you say before that? Grover just explained why our new dryad hates sunflowers and I’m trying to convince Clarisse not to use a flamethrower near the hemlocks.”

“It can wait,” I lied. I was suddenly very interested in the pattern of discoloration on my ceiling. “Hey, uh—what’s a Nemesis sight line?”

She groaned. “Ask me again when you visit. You are visiting, right? Your stepdad’s fall break is in two weeks. Come up for the weekend.”

“I will,” I said, and meant it.

I tried to be a good student for a few days. I really did. The Fates laughed and gave me another dream.

This time I was in a field that might’ve been Central Park if Central Park had forgotten it was a park and decided to become a plate of cracked pottery. The trees were dead and still full of whispering. A shape moved under the dirt—big, round —like something’s back rolling just below the surface. The ground bulged. A stone hand pushed up, and for one awful second I thought it was a giant’s hand, but then I saw it was a statue, half-buried, trying to stand. Its face was a woman’s. Her eyes were shut. She leaned her head to one side and soil avalanched down her cheek. Somewhere, very faint, a lullaby hummed. It was not comforting.

I woke with my heart doing drumline practice and my Achilles spot buzzing like I’d leaned against an invisible electric fence. Yeah, that. The Curse of Achilles. It feels different now than it did at the Battle of Manhattan. Back then it was a thick layer under my skin saying, You can take it. Now it was a dot between my shoulder blade and spine, a coin-sized reminder that I could still take it, but it would still hurt. If you’ve ever worn a backpack with one loose marble in it all day, you know exactly what I mean. Every time something felt wrong, the marble rolled and thumped.

That morning I fed Mrs. O’Leary in the park—the shadow she traveled by opened like a friendly manhole cover—and told her to nap somewhere without eating a jogger. She wagged her whole body like a furry earthquake and gave me slobber you could surf. I wiped my face on my sleeve and wished the world would sit still for five minutes.

It didn’t. The next piece of weird arrived in Algebra, as usual. The new substitute had eyes like polished stones and teeth too orderly, like she’d borrowed them from a store. She wrote slope-intercept form on the board and said, “Mr. Jackson, what’s the difference between a line and a fault line?”

I said, “One of them is in math class?”

“Correct,” she said, smiling. “For now.”

She didn’t try anything. She didn’t have to. After class, she made a point of standing too close and saying, “Get rest. Children need rest.”

“Thanks,” I said, and didn’t.

On Friday, a minor god sent a message. Okay, it was a raccoon that knocked three times on our window and held up a business card in its little hands, but like, you live in New York long enough, you stop asking questions. The card said: **Janus & Co. Locksmiths** on one side and **Do Not Be Here On the Twelfth** on the other. Helpful. I checked the calendar. The twelfth was in five days.

I showed the card to Paul. He read it and said, “Metaphor?” Then he realized what house he was in and said, “Never mind. Are we not being here, or…?”

“I’ll be at school,” I said. “Which is a very different kind of danger.”

Mom put the card under a magnet on the fridge. It sat there next to a coupon for dry cleaning and a picture of me and Annabeth on the beach that made my chest do that dumb thing where it thinks it’s a heart.

I shouldn’t have been surprised when Annabeth tapped on my fire escape window at dawn the next morning. She looked like she hadn’t slept in two days. That thing happens to Annabeth where she gets more beautiful the more exhausted she is, but if you point that out she will build a library on you.

I pushed the window up. “Hi.”

“Get dressed,” she said.

She climbed in like a cat burglar and hugged my mom in the kitchen. The two of them looked at each other in that soft way they do, shared bravery passing like a secret handshake. Annabeth grabbed a piece of toast (approved breakfast food for urgent matters) and told us about camp. Claimings were up. Way up. The new cabins were half finished. Some gods had been sending signs; some were silent. The Oracle had gone into one of her “try again later” modes. And something in the woods was making the dryads whisper.

“We can handle it,” Annabeth said, the way architects say we can handle a cantilever. “I just—” She looked at me. “I wanted you there.”

That’s how I ended up on a bus with my weekend bag and my sword disguised as a pen, staring at the window while Queens sprinted by. The bus smelled like French fries. A lady three rows up had a Chihuahua in her purse that stared at me with the suspicious intensity of a TSA agent. I tried to nap. I ended up thinking about the twelfth, and the raccoon, and the dream.

We walked up Half-Blood Hill together under a sky the color of tin. The dragon under the Golden Fleece raised its head and let us pass because it has excellent taste. The valley spread out the way it always does—beach to the north, forest to the west, the cabins in a Greek omega around the green. If you’ve never seen it in winter, you should. The pines look like they’re telling secrets. The lake waits. The forge smoke goes up in neat lines, and the big house shines protectively, and if you ignore the part where the gods use you as chess pieces, it’s the safest place on earth.

We didn’t ignore it. Camp felt…off. Not broken. Not cursed. Just like the first second when a Jenga tower sways and everyone at the table inhales.

Kids everywhere. Younger than me, older than me, lots of faces I didn’t know. Some already claimed, standing proudly in front of cabins that matched their eyes or their vibes. Some camped in the Hermes cabin or on sleeping bags in the amphitheater, waiting, scanning the ridge lines of roofs as if a sign might spark over a doorway. I recognized that wait. It carves a person into attention. It says I am here, please say you see me.

Tyson found me before I found him. I heard him first—“BROTHER!”—and then he was picking me up like I was a bag of flour, which is a cool feeling if you like being a bag of flour. He smelled like smoke and ocean and happiness. He set me down and patted my head like I was the one dog on earth larger than Mrs. O’Leary.

“I build,” he announced. “Look!”

He dragged me toward the half-finished cabins, each with a personality disorder. The Nemesis cabin was balanced perfectly on a rock no bigger than my foot. The Hecate cabin had doors that changed if you blinked too long. The Iris cabin was…rainbows. Not subtle rainbows, either. The kind that make your soul clean. Butch from Iris cabin saluted us with a paint roller and had streaks of violet in his hair.

“We make it strong,” Tyson said, pounding a post that did not need more pounding. “And pretty. And not fall down. And also with room for big fish tank!” He whispered the last part like a government secret. “For Poseidon cabin. Shh.”

“I didn’t hear anything,” I said. “Especially not about the enormous fish tank that will probably make Cabin Three the most popular hangout under seventeen.”

He wiggled his eyebrows like he’d invented water.

We spent the morning hauling beams, which I can do without sweating now thanks to the stupid marble in my back. Annabeth measured, called out numbers, corrected Clarisse on the difference between “plumb” and “plum,” and somehow had a smile for every kid who looked lost even while juggling blueprints. Watching her is like watching someone conduct an orchestra with a hammer. She saw me glancing and rolled her eyes like, Don’t get mushy in front of the saw horses.

At lunch, the campfire blew the right color—lots of bright offerings, lots of smoke—though the flame had a personality that day. It leaned toward the forest twice, like it was listening.

I sat with my cabin and told the new kids the important rules: don’t feed the pegasi moldy sugar cubes, don’t accept any “free tours” from the Stoll brothers, and for the love of gods don’t go near the woods at night unless you’re into getting haunted by the souls of bad decisions. A little kid with freckles asked if he could pet Mrs. O’Leary. I said, “Absolutely, as long as you sign a waiver.”

After lunch, I went with Grover for a walk because you don’t ignore the satyr when he asks you to look at the trees. He wore a scarf that had lost a fight with a bush and said, “The dryads are jumpy. Something under the soil keeps making these big shuddery sighs.”

“Comforting,” I said. “Like the city pipes when they wake up.”

He nodded. “Except the pipes are full of roots.”

We passed the Apollo kids practicing archery. Will Solace glared at a chariot frame like it had insulted his ancestors. He called, “Jackson, if you dent any more of my vehicles I’m sending you the bill.”

“Put it on my tab!” I yelled back.

He gestured at the sky. “So many tabs, and yet no ceiling.”

In the afternoon, Clarisse convinced a handful of Ares kids to “stress test” the Nemesis cabin, which means she tried to ram it with a battering ram made of three Ares kids and a log. The cabin shrugged like, cute. Nemesis herself probably took notes on cosmic irony.

Throughout all of it, a question walked behind my eyes: where were the gods? Hermes used to show up like the world’s most chaotic mailman. Apollo threw down limericks if you looked up at the sun too long. Dionysus—Mr. D, if you’re polite or suicidal—was technically here, but he made a point of being at the Big House only when we weren’t. The ones who did send signs did it like guilty parents—here’s a trinket, kiddo, don’t ask me to show up in person.

That night I dreamed again. Because of course I did. Same cracked field. Same low whisper, louder now, as if whatever was speaking had rolled closer to the surface. A shape like a hill became a shoulder, then an arm. The ground split down the middle with a sound like a bar of chocolate snapping. The lullaby came back, and I realized it wasn’t a lullaby. It was a counting song. One, two, three. I woke up with that rhythm stuck in my teeth.

I didn’t wake alone. Mrs. O’Leary’s nose was pressed against my window from the outside, which is not creepy at all when your dog is the size of a car. She boofed softly, the universal giant-hellhound sound for you okay? I scratched between her eyes and said, “Fine.” She boofed again, which I took to mean liar.

In the morning, we held sword drills, because there’s nothing like the smell of sweat and bronze to make you forget your nightmare. I took it easy on the younger campers, which means I disarmed them without making anyone cry, and I let Clarisse disarm me once so she wouldn’t carry the grudge into next week. She still did, but more cheerfully.

Between drills, Annabeth and I walked the new pathway between cabins. She explained how the cobbles were laid in this pattern because of Athena reasons, and how the torch brackets were configured because of Hestia reasons, and how the sight lines mattered because of Nemesis reasons, and if you think I only remember the last one because Nemesis reasons sounds cool, you are absolutely correct.

“We’re almost ready,” she said, almost convincing herself.

“For what?” I asked.

“For whatever’s next.” She pressed her lips together. “You feel it too.”

“I have a marble in my back that rolls when the universe sneezes,” I said. “So, yeah.”

She bumped my shoulder with hers. “You know that’s a terrible metaphor.”

“I’m the metaphor.”

That got me a smile. I am weak.

We did some real good that week. Claimed kids moved into cabins that fit, and you could see their shoulders drop, like they’d been holding air and finally let some out. An unclaimed girl from the city, maybe eleven, got claimed by Hecate in a shimmer of aurora over her head. She burst into happy tears, then turned Clarisse’s ponytail purple by accident. Clarisse pretended to be mad. That’s progress.

But every time I let myself feel the good, the ground in my dreams counted to three and knocked.

On the eleventh—one day before my raccoon friend’s warning—Paul called to check in. He said the twelfth was a field trip day, so if I needed to be not here, I could be. He laughed and said, “That sentence made more sense in my head.”

“Thanks,” I said. It was weird, talking about ominous warnings with your English teacher stepdad while standing under a grape arbor that never dies.

Mom texted me a picture of the raccoon, who had returned to our window sill to hold up a different card that said: **GOOD BOY**. Mom added: *Is he talking to you, or to himself?* I texted back a picture of Tyson, who had put on a hard hat that said **FOREMAN** in crayon. Mom sent a heart and a pancake emoji. Technology is wild.

That afternoon, a dryad led Grover and me to the edge of the forest where the pines grow obnoxiously tall. She looked like a girl woven out of bark and worry. “Listen,” she said.

We did. For a long twenty seconds, I heard nothing but wind. Then a sound rolled through the earth like distant thunder. It wasn’t thunder. It felt slow and heavy and old. If sound could be a root system, that’s what it would be. The dryad flinched and pressed her palm to a trunk.

“It started after the solstice,” she whispered. “Sometimes we feel it in the mornings, sometimes at night. The little things go quiet. The moles. The worms.”

“Worms go quiet?” I said. “How can you tell?”

She gave me a look like trees gossip and humans are late to the party.

Grover’s brow scrunched under his horns. “It’s far away. West.”

“West is big,” I said.

“It is,” he agreed. “But sometimes big things still get here.”

That night I didn’t dream. That should’ve been a relief. I woke up feeling worse, like the sound had decided I wasn’t worth the effort and that insulted me.

Breakfast was loud. Somebody started a toast-throwing war with the Ares table. Mr. D chose that moment to stroll in, look at the chaos, and stroll out again. I caught a glimpse of his shirt. It said **I’D RATHER BE PLAYING PINOCHLE** in purple glitter. Every part of me wanted to run after him and shake him until a god fell out, but gods don’t fall. They recede.

After chores I jogged the lake path, partly because it calms me, partly because I wanted to hear water talk. It did. Not with words. With those happy clucks lakes do when no one’s bothering them. The Naiads waved and told me I was pale. They always say that. I splashed my face and tried to talk my ankle out of wobbling. It didn’t listen.

Annabeth found me by the canoe dock. She had drachmas in one hand and plans in her eyes. “Walk with me.”

When Annabeth asks you to walk with her, you’re going to walk somewhere she already mapped in her head. She led me around the green, past the forges, up to the ridge where you can see the whole camp like a bright bowl. She didn’t talk for a while. I didn’t either. Sometimes silence is the only way to respect a place.

Finally, she said, “Winter break. The plan—let’s make it real.”

“Real how?” I said, even though I knew. I wanted her to say it.

“Three weeks,” she said, pushing hair out of her face. “You. Me. Here. No quests.” She made a face at herself. “Okay, fewer quests. Finish the cabins. Teach the new kids. Eat by the fire. Sleep. Together, but, you know, sleep.”

I nodded. My chest did the stupid thing again. “Sounds perfect.”

“Come early,” she said. “I’ll talk to Chiron. We’ll make the time.”

“Done,” I said.

That night the whole camp went owl-quiet while the sun fell behind the ridge. The torches flared. The smoke from the fire smelled like cedar and toast. Someone played a lyre a little out of tune, which made it better. We sang. We ate. We threw the good parts into the fire for the gods and pretended we didn’t notice which flames leaned in and which leaned away.

I walked Annabeth to her cabin. I kissed her like a person who planned to still be here in the morning and the next morning and a long row of mornings after that. She kissed me back like she’d built those mornings onto a schedule and dared the universe to interfere.

Then I went to bed.

I did not sleep.

It wasn’t a dream that kept me up. It was the absence of one. The kind of quiet where your brain supplies its own threats. I lay there listening to the building creak. Cabin Three doesn’t creak much. It’s stubborn. It holds. But the world outside it was making little settling noises, and every time a beam sighed I thought of the cracked field in my head and the way the ground had counted to three.

On the twelfth—my not-here day—Annabeth kicked me awake at sunrise and we were out the door before breakfast. The Stoll brothers tried to recruit us into a “research project” that involved marshmallows and the climbing wall lava, and Annabeth promised to help “later,” which is Stoll-for “never.”

We went to the far ridge with the pine tree and the fleece and the dragon that pretends to be asleep. We sat with our shoulders touching. We said nothing. We watched the clouds pretend they were harmless.

“Do you ever get tired of this?” she asked finally.

“Of what?” I said. “Being magnificent? Constantly saving everybody with my dazzling charm?”

She snorted. “Of waiting for the other sandal to drop.”

I looked down at my feet. “As a collector of dropped sandals,” I said, “I can confirm we don’t always get to pick where they land.”

She threaded her fingers through mine. “We pick what we do next.”

“I’m picking pancakes,” I said. “After winter break starts, we’re having pancakes every morning until we can’t stand pancakes and then we’re having waffles.”

“You’re a visionary,” she said.

“I know.”

She leaned her head on my shoulder. The fleece glowed. The dragon opened one eye and decided we were boring.

We didn’t say Hera’s name. We didn’t say Gaia’s. We didn’t say I feel like the ground is watching me, or I think the gods are hiding something again, or what if the universe is rolling dice and we’re the little pieces. We didn’t have to. We’re good at pretending the future is a thing we can pencil in.

That night, Chiron told me to rest. He didn’t say why. He didn’t have to. His eyes had that faraway look like he was listening to hooves thundering down a hallway I couldn’t see. “Take tomorrow,” he said. “Read. Swim. Visit the forges. Let your thoughts be small.”

I promised I would. My thoughts laughed and picked up weights.

I spent the morning losing to Tyson at arm wrestling. He does this thing where he lets me almost win and it’s very offensive. Then I helped a kid from Hypnos cabin rearrange his bunk because the sun was hitting it “wrong,” and he fell asleep mid-sentence. I wrote a letter to Mom and told her everything was fine, which is demigod for everything is not fine but telling you would be cruel.

In the afternoon, I wandered to the canoe lake again. The water was glass. I could see my reflection: a guy who kept promising himself naps. I leaned over and said, “Any advice?”

The lake bubbled like it was trying not to laugh. Then a voice I knew too well, silent and everywhere at once, said, Not today, Perseus.

My father’s voice. Not angry. Not tender. Tide-flat.

“That’s helpful,” I said.

Silence, then: Be ready.

“For what?”

The answer was the sound of a wave folding on itself.

I stood up too fast and my head went light. My Achilles spot did its little marble roll and thump. Be ready. For what? For whatever counted to three and pushed. For gods who didn’t knock. For dreams that hummed lullabies that weren’t lullabies. For a winter break that was supposed to be quiet and wouldn’t be.

That night the campfire was extra warm. The stars acted like they always do—rude and beautiful. Annabeth kissed me goodnight again. For once, I actually fell asleep.

No dream. Dark and deep and complete, the kind of sleep that steals hours. When I woke, it was still dark. I thought it was the same night. It wasn’t. The silence wasn’t the good kind. It was a held breath.

I lay there, not moving, and noticed it. The tiniest vibration. Not in the cabin. In me. Not fear. Not adrenaline. Attention. Like someone had said my name just outside the door and the air had passed it along without using sound.

I told myself I was being dramatic. I told myself to close my eyes. I stared at the rafters until they were just rafters again.

In the morning, we pretended it had been nothing. We took inventory of the armory. We taught the little kids how to tie a canoe to a dock. We argued with Clarisse about whether the Ares cabin needed a second weapon rack or a bigger first one. We did a hundred tiny things that felt like pinning butterflies to a board while a storm built two towns over.

At dinner, I threw extra good food into the fire. I didn’t ask for anything. I just said thanks. The smoke went up and didn’t answer. I tried again. Still nothing. I told myself gods have other things to do. The thing about telling yourself things is it works exactly as long as you keep talking.

Afterward, Annabeth and I walked the long way around the green so we could get in one more set of the same conversation as always. We didn’t plan it. We just fell into it.

“We should teach the Hermes kids how to block low,” she said.

“Okay.”

“And the newer Aphrodite kids need to learn spears aren’t just for aesthetics.”

“Strong agree.”

“And…we should start the winter plan tomorrow. Breakfast. Then the forges. Then the lake. Then the library. Then more breakfast.”

“I like where your head’s at,” I said.

She stopped. “Promise me.”

“I promise,” I said, and meant it. I meant it like it was a line I could draw with my finger across the air and make the universe trip if it tried to cross.

We stood there a second more and watched the torches hiss. I don’t know why I noticed the way the wind turned just then. It was a tiny thing. The flames bent toward us. The smoke wrote nothing. The dark beyond the tree line looked pleased with itself.

“Tomorrow,” Annabeth said.

“Tomorrow,” I said.

I walked her to her cabin and then back to mine. I set Riptide on the nightstand. I made a mental list of all the normal things I would do in the morning. Eat pancakes if the kitchen made them. Help Tyson with fish-tank logistics. Say something that made Will roll his eyes. I let that list be bigger than the worry. I climbed into bed and stared up at the beams and imagined I could see the curve of the world holding us up.

I told myself to sleep.

This time I did, but the dark didn’t feel empty. It felt occupied. Not by a dream, not by a god, but by the hush that comes before someone knocks and doesn’t knock because they don’t think they need to.

I’m not saying I knew. I didn’t. If I’d known, I would’ve sat on my own feet. I would’ve tied myself to the bed with Clarisse’s spear straps. I would’ve asked Tyson to sit on me. I’m just saying I felt the quiet fill the room, and I mistook it for peace.

I’ll tell you the rest, I promise. But first, if you’re going to understand how I got from pancakes to the kind of silence that breaks, you need to know the months in between the war and the missing piece weren’t empty. They were messy and good and full of small brave things. They were everything we built—cabins, paths, routines—lined up like dominoes. They were me and Annabeth choosing tomorrow more times than I can count.

And then tomorrow caught up.

So, yeah. Nothing says normal like pancakes and rainbows. And if you ever see both in the same day, check the ground. If it’s breathing, maybe don’t go back to sleep.

Because the next morning was supposed to be the first day of the quiet part. Breakfast, forges, lake, library. Instead, it started with a promise, and ended with an empty bunk.

Not yet. Not this page. But soon.

Let me take you back to where the quiet ended and the counting started, the exact moment the ground decided to say my name out loud.

I will try to keep it short but still will add all the details that are necessary.

Before 7-8 months
I was in a small company where teams were quite small like 7-8 people and was working their since my career started. I made good friends their throughout  3-4 years and spent really good time. The company used to take us for team outings and also went to 3-4 trips a year by myself. Also my parents house was just few hours away so I will visit them quite frequently and it made me both happy and sometimes furious because I was jumping here and there. In the last company I never worried about work because I was doing good and enjoying whatever I was doing because it was fun at the end of the day.

From last 7-8 months 
Moved to a new company that is like 50x larger than previous one, new city and left all good friends. I don't what happened to me but I somehow started worrying about work too much because in big companies there is always more work than anyone can complete. Because of it, I fucked up my gym schedule, sleep schedule and also most importantly refrained from taking leaves for vacations. Just stated waiting for weekends and even on weekends it felt like I am dizzy all the time and just doing household stuff. 
In last 1 month or so, I started feeling that something is not good with me. Even with full efforts, I was not able to put my best in the work and started procrastination on the work items and also stopped caring about office timings, rules etc. I was feeling like I am missing everything and work is not the solution. 

Last 7 days
Some of my friends visited me last week and we went to an impromptu trip on weekend and had good fun. Except me the rest of friends planned to extend the trip and I denied because I was worried about the pending work, deadlines etc but by the end of the day I was supposed to catch the train to work town. Now I casually checked my available leaves and realised I haven't taken proper vacation leaves in last 7 months (that is first time in my career) and my mind instantly said ""fuck it, let's go"" and I went to the extended trip. 

Now 

Now I am sitting in my office, sipping same coffee but somehow it is more tasty and doing focused work from last 3 hours and writing this post. Now I feel like that I was fighting my inner identity of being a person who will go to trips every year and it was making me anxious, pushing me into deep intrusive thoughts and probably depression. I am now planning to do things that I always liked whenever I feel lost.

So that's is my observation that sometimes doing things that you liked or enjoyed the in the past or going to places where you had your best moments can make you feel good and keep you in the flow.",1,1755669236.0,productivity,0,1.0,False

It is my favorite keyboard. No other can and has compared to its perfection for what I need and space constraints.

I need help finding a comparable replacement to it.

The maker is Soundance but it looks like they only do laptop stands now.

I bought it without a mouse. I don't care if it comes with a mouse or not.

**Budget**: preferrably below $100 USD but I am crazy enough to pay for shipping from Canada if possible to get the over prices one I found. Orginally I bought the OG keyboard for like $35 USD in 2019.

In 2019 this was the listing title: [Wireless Keyboard, 2.4GHz Slim Compact Low-Profile Rechargeable Wireless Keyboard for Laptop, Mac, Notebook, PC, Desktop, Computer, Windows 10 7 XP, iOS, Soundance Black and Silver](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JGQP89G?ref_=ppx_hzod_title_dt_b_fed_asin_title_0_0) but that page does not exist anymore.

**Specs**:

* metal body
* the tech guys at work said they have a ""butterfly"" or ""scissors"" switch""
   * it was amazingly silently when I bought it
* the top is metal/aluminum and the bottom has black plastic
* it's 13in long about, I bought it to fit the size of my laptop due to space constraints that remain to this day
* I need a 75% keyboard layout (that's what the tech guys said my keyboard layout is)
   * it has to have the column of keys that has delete, home, pg up. pg down, end and arrow
      * though I don't neccesarily care what order but I use home and end EVERY DAY, so they are a must in that position. I really hope a subreddit of keyboard fanatics understand this particularity

[I found it](https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/seort/3HFQVFRGRGIS), only the problem is that it's sold on Walmart Canada and they don't ship to the US. I tried and they will not let me enter a US address. I only found one on the used market and that seller is no longer active so the likelihood of me getting that keyboard, even though I hit purchase is basically nil.

So whatever I just bought. I hate it and I would like to avoid wasting time with something like it agian. I also hate where the delete button is on this keyboard that I am typing on now.

1mv6eu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1mv6eu0/new_starbucks_scam_just_dropped_baristas_and/,New Starbucks Scam Just Dropped 💰🔥 Baristas and Customers Beware ‼️,"This is quite scary and it may cost me my job, but it seems clear to me that the honest thing to do is disseminate this information quickly so that it can be stopped. For context I am a barista (M17) and I was on a two person play for the majority of the duration of my shift. 

Today at work I got robbed, at the register, but not in the way you might think. $300. That’s about what was stolen. And it wasn’t stolen from me nor the register, but other customers whom Starbucks will HAVE to reimburse. 

‼️The scam is essentially this‼️: Criminal uses the cards connected to a multitude of starbucks customer accounts (Starbucks App) to pay for gift cards at the register. Seemingly harmless, but if you are the customer they are likely using YOUR money that you have connected to the starbucks app. Somehow these criminals have gained access to your accounts and are using funds to likely sell the gift cards to people at a discounted price (basically selling a 10$ starbucks gift card for 5$ by using the money that they’ve stolen from the accounts of customers) 

But how do I know this 🤔: After this situation (which I’ll explain later) happened a woman called asking why funds were missing from her account and being used at my store. The only reasonable explanation for why they’re hacking into starbucks accounts and stealing your barcodes (not for stars but tender 💵) is to buy or redistribute your money. To be honest, there’s marginal utility in hacking into and stealing the funds of other people purely for a free coffee every now and again. They are doing this to make money in a market of people who would want a cup of coffee for half the price, it’s that simple. They’re selling the Starbucks gift cards that they bought using customers’ hard earned money to people who see 10$ gift cards at the price of 5$ and think “this is a steal” and nothing more. This is the scam, this is their business model. 

The solution ✅: I have conjured a few solutions that are applicable based solely on who you are. 

For the customer 💁🏽‍♀️: I sincerely apologize if this has happened to you, if it has, contact starbucks HR. If they refuse to reimburse you then we will have to organize to ensure that they do, your data and your security must be paramount and therefore protected from criminals and by the people who you’ve entrusted your information with. I suggest removing all forms of payment from your app, you can still use and scan for stars, that isn’t the issue, just remove your cards so your money can’t be stolen. 

For Partners 😕: Unfortunately all we can do is notify our superiors in the Starbucks hierarchy and hope they will do something about it. If they aren’t sure of the solution, the one that I’ve devised is to not accept online gift cards as a form of payment for physical gift cards. This will temporarily disable their business model and ensure minimized losses for the company. 

For Starbucks 🧜‍♀️: This issue if unchecked will culminate in losses likely totalling hundreds of thousands of dollars. This scam isn’t in our training, we aren’t prohibited from exchanging digital gift card for physical gift card. Now, this can be resolved in two steps depending on the root of this issue. Firstly, you can systemically remove the ability to use digital gift cards as a form of tender for physical ones. This ensures that baristas will not repeat the mistake that I did and minimizes losses for the company. Secondly, you need to figure out the root of this security breach. These people are being hacked, not physically robbed from. If you outsourced the development of the app, sue, and advise against the usage of such developer to fellow restaurant owners with rewards apps, it’s the honest thing to do. If you are the app developer, you will either be sued if you don’t refund everyone, or you will fix the cause of the breach, transfer data or delete it (whatever is necessary) to minimize losses. Depending on how bad of a data breach there is, it may be best to temporarily remove the ability to pay using cards on the app completely either on the side of the barista or customer or both. This minimizes losses until the issue is fully resolved. That’s as far as I can advise you, if you’re employee seeing this and don’t have the purview to fix it, inform your supervisor. You need to fix this before more people become victims of this scam. 

My Story 📖: This is less relevant but nonetheless the context is paramount to the resolution of this issue. I was at the register when this black gentleman came up, he smelled of weed, but at Starbucks we are taught not to judge people by how they appear, we have no insight into their character, and additionally, where I live, California, it’s legal. He then let a regular order before him. I thought it was a gentlemanly gesture and I therefore was less ready to become suspicious of his behavior. I made the regulars tea and returned to the register. This man wanted gift cards. Understanding the seeming kindness of allowing another person to order before him due to the nature of the time it would take for me to scan all of the gift cards, I was proud (for our culture) of the act of temporal generosity. I realized only later than this gesture may’ve only been the means of disarming me through quelling any potential suspicion. He wanted to add $9.99 to each of the packs of gift cards. I thought it was interesting, because normally people would get 10$ or flat numbers without change, but that red flag fell underneath my suspicion. I only became suspicious when the names of the tender used (via screenshots of barcodes presumably from the starbucks app or website) continued changing. I asked what this was all for. He said he ran a charity where he was giving back to the community. Seemed fair. But then it kept happening, each time it would change, and worse, he was unwilling to use any of his own money for this, presumably because he didn’t want it traced back to him. This rang my alarm bells so I asked him how he got all of these gift cards. He said he got them through his church which they donated to him for his charity. I’m not a churchgoer and don’t really understand how microcosms of our culture spend their money. So I couldn’t really argue about the degree to which it was nonsensical. He was mumbling, but I don’t expect most people to be articulate, so I let it go. Starbucks teaches us to question our sentiments. Just because they look some way doesn’t mean that they are some way, they are just a customer. I internalized this, I believe it. We have emotional reactions to things because of our culture, just because a black dude who smells like weed is doing something suspicious, it doesn’t mean that what he is doing is wrong, it just means that I need to reevaluate why I think what I do. I stopped a few times to remember what I learned. “I’ll be back later bro I gotta go real quick and charge my phone then I gotta get some more.” “Yeah, sure, absolutely” I responded and smiled. Then he stayed for a while. Then he left. I let him go. He got away with the gift cards. I didn’t think anything of it. Until I got a call. I’m kinda new to Starbucks and hadn’t ever answered the phone. I asked my older barista to answer it, she said “Don’t hand me that phone you take it.” I answer the phone, “Hi this is Starbucks” “Hi is this Starbucks? I’m Rebecca, why does it say I just spent 40 dollars at your store?” A feeling of guilt washed over me. I was complicit in a crime. This woman lost her hard earned money because of me. But it wasn’t only her. It was probably near a dozen people, all losing various amount as a consequence of my incompetence. I walked toward my manager who was on lunch break desperately trying to explain the situation. “I think I just got robbed.” He hung up the phone then called her back. He told me to go back to the floor. I was traumatized. We are trained for customer service, but I couldn’t crack a smile. Eventually I went back, and asked him if we should call the police or what we should do, I told him he was going to come back. He responded “Idk bro i’m on my lunch break”. It was literally 7:00, but I just felt defeated and wondered if I should. He said he was coming back. Eventually he did and my shift, who was on lunch break, said he’d take the order. He eventually just denied him the exchange. I felt that justice wasn’t served. I knew it couldn’t be. I thought “if we were the ones to lock him up, we endanger the baristas at this Starbucks” I know my shift thought that before I did, and I felt terrified by the idea. Justice could not be served. Not in the way it should have. People should contribute to society, but then I thought that they are limited by the resources and education they receive at youth. In America, inequality of opportunity is observable everywhere. I don’t know if everyone realizes, but it’s evident to me that there isn’t enough of it for so many people. I think this is no different. It doesn’t excuse his behavior, but it explains it. It can allow for sympathy where there may not have otherwise been. For the rest of the duration of the shift I was traumatized. I cut myself while making drinks and bled some on the counter. I don’t even know how. I obviously wasn’t paying due attention. I couldn’t, I felt lost. I felt horrible. Not only was I complicit in a crime, but no justice could be served. I was debating calling the cops on myself, but I know that’s just foolish and the feeling of extreme guilt. If I stole your time (money) today, I’m sincerely sorry. I didn’t mean to. 

I don’t really know how to end this. Have a nice day or night guys and if I came across any way but apologetic and sincere, I’m sorry. It wasn’t my intention. I just wanted to give you guys an insight into how I felt during the situation. Hopefully you guys never have to experience what I did, the feeling really wasn’t fun. If there’s anything to conclude other than awareness of the scam, trust your instincts more than the benefit of the doubt. If you’re unsure of what to do, contact your supervisor. Hopefully they’re not also on lunch break. Also I’m scared that I’m going to be fired over this. What should I do? AITA?",0,1755668604.0,starbucks,7,0.3,False

Alright, friends, let’s chat about mornings. You know that feeling when you wake up, and it's like your brain is still in dreamland? 🌫️ Yeah, I’ve been there, too. But here's the thing: a little shift can make a world of difference. 

**For me? It was as simple as this: **no tech for the first hour.** Yup, you heard that right! No scrolling, no notifications pinging me awake—just me, my thoughts, and a warm cup of coffee. ☕✨ 

Here’s why I think it’s made such a huge impact:

1. **Mindful Start:** Without diving into the chaos of emails and social media, I get to set my own tone for the day. It’s like pressing a reset button on my brain! How often do we let the outside world dictate our mood right from the get-go?

2. **Improved Focus:** When I finally do sit down with my tasks, it’s like my brain is freshly charged. I can actually dive in instead of fumble around half-focused, wondering what the latest meme is. 🙈

3. **Time for Reflection:** That hour has become my personal think tank. I can reflect on my goals, jot down ideas, or even just daydream a little. Anyone else find that some of their best ideas come when they’re not trying to force them? 

4. **Unexpected Productivity Boost:** I’ve found that having this tech-free time means I actually get more done in less time when I do log on. It’s like I’ve streamlined my brain’s operating system! 🚀

Now, I get it, some of you are probably rolling your eyes like, “No way, I need my memes to wake up!” But hear me out—it's all about finding what works for YOU. Maybe you’d feel more focused if you took a short walk or did some quick stretches instead.

So, I’m curious—what tweaks have worked wonders for you? Are you an early riser with a quirky morning smoothie ritual? Or maybe you just can’t start the day without blasting your favorite playlist?

HCM Mausoleum 
Make sure to check the timings of when the museum and mausoleum are open. We made the mistake of visitng around noon and weren’t able the enter. Here are the opening hours for the mausoleum and museum: 

Mausoleum (Free entry)
April 1st to October 31st: 7.30 a.m – 10.30 a.m (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays: 7.30 a.m – 11.00 a.m) 
November 1st to March 31st of next year: 8.00 a.m – 11.00 a.m

Museum (entrance fee of 25000 VND)
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday 
Morning: from 08:00 to 12:00 
Afternoon: from 14:00 to 16:30

Another thing to note is that the dress code is very strict to enter, even though we entered when both the Mausoleum and Museum were closed, we had to wear pants / long skirt and tops covering our shoulders (no sleeveless). We ended up needing to pay for cover ups from street vendors outside 😬

Train Street 
We went to Mincolin coffee and really enjoyed the experience. It’s pretty close to one end of train street with an entrance right next to the cafe, so it’s not too crowded making the experience much more enjoyable. The staff were really sweet and helpful, offering to take pictures for us and telling us when the next trains were coming. The drinks were incredible, would highly recommend their cocoa coffee! 

We went at night as there are a few trains that run around 9pm, I’d highly recommend doing that. The seating is along the tracks so it can get quite hot and humid in the afternoon, at night there are not as many people and it’s much cooler, and the view of all the lit up shops along the street has its own charm! :^)

Old quarter
Definitely leave a day or two just to fully explore the Old Quarter, we found it to be one of the best parts of the trip, esp with the hustle bustle of the crowd. A lot of stores sell similar items (shoes, clothing, etc.) so be sure to look around to see which shops have the best items / lowest price! So far the quality has been proven to be great! You can afford to haggle a little bit, especially if you feel they’re overcharing you as tourists. We didn’t do this much, but there were times when one shopkeeper would charge us 100.000 VND, and 2 minutes later a second shopkeeper would ask us to pay 150.000 VND at the exact same item at the exact same shop. In those cases we mentioned they lower price and they agreed without much back and forth. There’s also a weekend market near Hoan Kiem Lake from Friday to Sunday, from around 6pm to 11pm which is worth checking out as well!

Hoa Lo Prison and Temple of Literature
We went to these two places before HCM Mausoleum, and we dressed modestly but soon realised they weren’t strict at all about the dress code (which gave us the false impression that it would be the same for the Mausoleum). You could wear shorts and tube tops but there was nobody to disallow you from entering. Both locations were really nice and would highly recommend going! 

Hotel Location
We stayed at Marriott and while our experience there was obviously great, it’s quite far from the city centre, so we had to allocate at least half an hour for travel (although often much longer). I think staying at old quarter or west lake could have saved us quite a bit of time, and we found there to be a lot more food options there. The traffic can be quite bad at times, especially closer to the centre, so do leave ample time to commute between places if you’re taking grab. 

Weather
The weather was pretty unpredictable, the forecast predicted rain on all 5 days we were there, but the only time it rained heavily was on our ride back to the airport! Always carry an umbrella with you, but more often than not it rained lightly for about 5-10 min and then cleared up (although that’s just our experience from our 5 days there). 

Payments
Almost every single place we went to accepted cash and definitely not as many that take card (even big chains and establishments). Definitely bring some cash around with you at all times, even in your local currency and convert to VND at any money exchange or tour booking stores. We found the exchange rates to be really good (much better than back home at the airport). Even at the stores that accept card, there will often be additional charges due to tax  so it would be in your best interest to always have cash on hand!

Overall we had a really great time, the people were really friendly and welcoming too! As female travellers we also felt really safe walking around even at night  :^) Hope everyone has as good an experience as we did!",3,1755667012.0,hanoi,0,0.8,False

In the following 5 months we were still seeing each other on and off while we were getting things sorted and separated.
Being an amicable separation the agreement was that we would stop seeing each other when he started looking for a new partner.
I myself choose to stay single and do therapy to heal; I also didn't want to interfere in case his new partner was against us staying in contact.

7 months after separation, we were having a coffee at a local cafe, and I discovered he was seeing someone (nude pic showed up on his phone....I nearly spit my coffee! 😂). Honestly I was happy for him, though he looked like a deer in the headlights. A few weeks later our old neighbour invited me for coffee and that's when I discovered that the ex and new partner had started seeing each others days after our break up (when we were still 'very amicable'). Pretty much he was cheating on his new GF with me for months, we even went on holiday together; mind you I knew nothing about her despite asking him every time we saw each other.
 I got immediately checked for all possible STD under the sun, and when everything came back negative I told him I wanted to go no contacts and wished him all the best. I also later discovered he was cheating during our relationship as well. Lastly, a few weeks ago he reached out to try and reconnect, but I told him to leave me alone and blessed his heart 😉.

I know I would have liked to know he was a cheater,  but shall I tell the poor lady, that has been with the cheater for almost a year now, what she's looking at?

I'm employed as head barista (co-ordinator) so I'm not a general manager, but not a crew person - I'm in between. Do I get manager perks, no? Do I hold all the responsibilities all other managers have at times? Yes. It's a bullshit arrangement.

Characters are me 31F, Manager 20F, and Head Manager 24F.
Some background for context. I have worked at this place for 3 years, and due to a chronic immune and digestive disorder, I have had a lot of time away from work this year. I informed them of this when I was employed and they are aware. I was in the hospital for a total of 6 months this year in two different stays and started having panic attacks due to medical trauma - a story for another time. All is on the mend now which I am so grateful for. However, with it being chronic it still lurks in the shadows. I recently met with my head manager and discussed returning to work. It was agreed I would only work in my position I'm trained in which is the cafe section. 

Today, I arrive at work and a new manager is working who I haven't met. She seemed rather rude when I introduced myself to her. Classic eye roll and, ver batum ""Go clean"" were her first words to me.
I'm taken aback and say ""OK"". I'm a friendly person and was shocked at this response. So I work in the cafe section for about 2 hours doing orders and cleaning away and then she comes and rearranges everyone to different positions for no reason. 
Reminder: I am only trained in cafe (i.e., I only make coffee, and maintain/clean the area. I can do other sections like serving but on my returning to work agreement, I was only to be in the cafe. I am also not trained in the new system that has been installed whilst I was away). She mutters, bearly audible over the beeps of the machines and the music they're playing on the speaker that I am to run the front of house, serving customers, and cleaning the dining space.

Manager: ""You run this section. Get out of the cafe."" in a muttered voice.

Me: ""Sorry I didn't hear you?"" (The machines are really loud and they were playing music.)

Manager: ""You're on this section now. Open your ears.""

Me: ""I couldn't hear you as your voice was quiet and the machines are all beeping. I can't do that section as that is not in the agreement I have with the head manager and I'm not trained in the new system.""

Manager: ""Well you have to do it.""

Me: ""No. The head manager agreed that I only do the cafe. You have three other people who can do that section way better and faster than I can anyway. And I'm not trained on the new system yet.""

The manager then eye rolls at me, and gets on her phone - I know she is texting the head manager about this. I remain in the cafe and make it the cleanest it has been in what seems like months. It was f*cking filthy when I arrived.
I hardly know anyone else working as the turnover is high. I asked another worker whom I've met once before ""Is she always a bit rough around the edges? Does she talk like that to everyone?"". The worker replied, ""I would have called in sick if I knew she was on.""

So, I finished my shift late as it got very busy, and with no help cleaned and stocked the cafe space. I check my phone as I leave and head manager messages me all confused over why I refused to do the other section work. I haven't replied yet but am thinking of stating:
We had an agreement that I would only do the cafe until I have the proper section training. You said I would have this happen weeks ago and it didn't happen. The manager on today was very rude and wasn't present on the floor for the majority of the shift, not helping when we got busy, then getting upset with our speed of service even though we were understaffed. 

So WIBTA for replying like this?

Some more context: getting work is difficult at the moment due to my location (rural) and due to my health condition. One day I can be fine, the next I can be in the hospital for three months. I'm studying full-time on the side at the moment and this job is an easy one for me (over 10+ years experience in the industry, pay is minimum wage though) and is flexible hours-wise. I don't want to risk getting fired because I refused to do something I'm not trained in.

This isn't the first time this has happened and I've asked for training in different sections of they want me to work. Today was sitting badly with me as this manager was immediately on her phone to the head manager. I'd love to read her messages tbh as it seems she has spun a different story. 

And bonus bullshit: the managers and coordinators all have a dinner outing at the end of the year which the company pays for and they're organising flights and hotels now for and I am not invited even though all other coordinators from other locations are invited... I wouldn't go anyway as I'm not a drinker (and these events are big drinking events) but the invitation would have been nice considering what I've been through this year with my health and the fact I'm returning to work?",4,1755666931.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

#Introduction

Back in 2016, I came across an article which marked the ten-year anniversary of the end of the 2006 Lebanon war by asking eighteen of their photographers to reflect on the images they had taken. The result was brilliant and touching, and subsequently inspired me to research and visit Lebanon myself. In 2019, I was at last able to set foot in the country of which I had been dreaming and which I had been frantically investigating for three years. I realised then how fast Lebanon was changing, and would change again – a feeling that was later confirmed by my second trip in 2021. This is why I feel so blessed to have had the opportunity to capture even a few of the wonders Lebanon hosts, hoping they will remain standing and even be restored in the future.

Nestled against the Mediterranean Sea and flanked by Syria to the north and east, with Israel to the south, the land now known as Lebanon was part of the Ottoman Empire for four centuries, before coming under French rule after World War I. Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943, but the Allies occupied the region until the very end of World War II. Lebanon’s history since its independence has been marked by alternating periods of turmoil, and political stability and prosperity, the latter being built on Beirut’s position as a regional centre for finance, business, and trade.

Not long after World War II, in 1947 another war broke out, this time with Israel. The Palestine War (or the War of Independence) has left many scars which can still be seen across the country today. An estimated 100,000 Palestinians fled to Lebanon during the war with Israel, and were not permitted to return after the ceasefire in 1949. As of 2019 there are still an estimated 175,000 to 450,000 Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon, with at least half still in decades-old refugee camps which nowadays resemble permanent settlements and neighbourhoods.


During the 1960s, Lebanon was relatively calm. During this time Beirut even earned the nickname “the Paris of the Middle East”, mainly due to its vibrant cultural life. The tourists flocked there, and the city became very cosmopolitan, but this soon changed.

On 13 April 1975, a huge civil war ignited, and its impact on the country is still visible to this day. The war lasted for over 15 years until October 1990, resulting in an estimated 120,000 fatalities. Approximately 70,000 people remain displaced within Lebanon, and there was also an exodus of around one million people from the country who have never returned.

The war officially ended in 1990, but five years prior to this, a second side conflict had erupted in the south of the country between the South Lebanese Army (Lebanese Christian militias supported by the Israel Defence Forces), and Lebanese Muslim guerrillas who were linked to Hezbollah. This second war only ended in 2000, when for the first time since 1974, the sound of mortar and gunfire in Lebanon finally stopped.

Sadly, for Beirut this peace would only last for six years until 2006, when a new conflict began on 12 July 2006 and continued until a United Nations-brokered ceasefire began 34 days later, on 14 August 2006. Israel laid siege to Lebanon, with waves of jets bombing across the country, including strategic sites such as Beirut airport and the road between Beirut and Damascus. Seaports were also blockaded. Despite the relatively brief length of this conflict, it had a devastating impact on the city’s architecture.

Lebanon’s rich architectural heritage can be traced back over 7,000 years to the ancient civilisation of Phoenicia, which built several major cities along the Mediterranean coastline. Many ancient ruins and fine examples from this fascinating period still survive today in modern day Lebanon, from Baalbek in the north-east, to Tyre on the south coast.

The Syrian Army occupied Lebanon between 1976 and 2005, until an uprising which followed the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri; during this twenty-nine-year period, the Syrian Army took over many buildings which were deemed to be of strategic importance. These included hotels on the route to the Syrian capital Damascus, and large homes or palaces at high vantage points such as in the mountain villages overlooking Beirut.

Whilst many of these buildings were left entirely vacant, as their owners fled the conflicts, others were left locked and full of belongings which remain there to this day. Locations in high positions, such as the Villa Paradiso, were ideal locations for artillery posts – a militia camped out in that building’s ground floor during the civil war.

The Syrian Army often stripped the buildings that they were occupying, as well as other neighbouring homes. Many stunning buildings were ruined in this way, with exotic tiles, stone, and marble plundered by the soldiers, including some of the renowned ‘triple arch’ features from these homes. Whilst Lebanon is a mix of architectural styles, my focus during both my visits was mainly on the most photogenic examples of 19th- and 20th-century architecture.


The Lebanese Mansion

There is something about Lebanese mansions. They are impossible to miss: the first thing which draws you in are the romantic exteriors of these usually grand two-storey homes.
These resplendent traditional houses first flourished in the 19th-century Ottoman era. The “Lebanese house” is usually a world of sunshine, light and colour, both subtle and vivid.

Some of these characteristic homes are also accompanied by an elegant iron balcony and a delicate colonnade, inspired by opulent Venetian palaces and Ottoman architecture.

At first glance, these heritage homes may seem alike, but if you look closer you can discern their individual personalities and unique traits. I found each architectural example unique, also varying in colour palettes from bright teals and clean whites, to soft orange and yellow hues. These homes were colourful, fascinating, and historic.

⸻

(Continuation)

Especially during my second visit to Lebanon, once I discovered a house that was disused or abandoned, it always filled me with excitement as I never quite knew what was going to be inside. Would the house be stripped of its former owners’ possessions? If not, what would remain? Would there be artwork on the ceiling?

What colours would reveal themselves to me? And what about the triple arcade windows – would they look as beautiful inside as they did from the building’s exterior?

Unfortunately, this jewel of Lebanese heritage is in danger. These beautiful residences, which blend so well into the landscape and give Lebanon its unique character, have been steadily disappearing. Sadly, they are losing the battle against mass urbanisation, and many are being demolished to make way for bland, affordable housing. Their restoration is awfully expensive, which means families have no choice but to abandon them in ruins or to sell them, only for them to be replaced by multi-storey concrete buildings.


#The Triple Arcade

On the outside houses are dressed in stone, with an ochre coating or another similar shade, and they feature the trademark three windows in the shape of arches that welcome this world of sunshine and light into the interior.

High ceilings were born from the need for cool rooms during Lebanon’s hot summers, as they allowed a breeze to pass through, and the central hall provided space for extended families to live together in the same large house. The three central large arched windows evolved and were doubled up to take advantage of the sweeping views of Lebanon’s hilly coastline and impressive mountains.

The triple arch usually has a central door, with a window on each side and a small balcony outside it. The high ceilings and the configuration of the doors and windows were designed to ensure cross ventilation, creating a comfortable and cool environment.

The red tiled roofs appeared during the 19th century, believed to be an Italian import. The roof never has windows or chimneystacks, and it is called the Tarboush or Fez of the house. These stylish red roofs were, and still are, sources of pride for owners across Lebanon.



#Abandoned Houses

Once a base for members of the Turkish army, but abandoned since the 1980s, this small Lebanese house gives us a first glance inside one of these traditional homes, albeit smaller than the others I explored.

A young man greeted us there, explaining that there was a rumour that the property had gold hidden somewhere inside its grounds. He confided that for years, and as recently as 2018, groups of people would come armed with new information and start digging around both inside and outside the abandoned building in search of this gold. Nothing has ever been found.

The next few pages depict images from other abandoned house discoveries that I made during my two visits to Lebanon, all of which feature the “triple arcade”. I have not disclosed the locations of most of them to protect them from potential vandalism, which I witness far too often. This selection was photographed across the country, and I am sure there are hundreds (if not thousands) more waiting to be discovered.



#Tripoli – طرابلس

The city is organised around the central Tripoli Citadel; I found myself lost amidst a tangle of streets and alleyways, flanked by a wonderful mix of architectural styles, from the high-rises built the 1970s to the many beautiful 19th-century buildings. I will never forget the honking and whirring of cars, mixed with the sound of coffee peddlers clinking their porcelain cups together to advertise the rich brews that they carried in large copper kettles at their sides.


#Baghdadi Ceilings

One of the main draws of these abandoned houses is the possibility of discovering a beautiful, art-filled Baghdadi ceiling. These ceilings adorn many homes throughout the country.

“Baghdadi” is the name for the traditional partition walls, or in this case false ceiling, which were used in these heritage buildings which sometimes date back 130 years. The Baghdadi is made of lath (wooden strips) before being covered in plaster, and then painted or occasionally used as a fresh canvas for additional mouldings, frescoes, or artwork.



#Tripoli (Continuation)

In the bustling heart of Tripoli are some of the most amazing old souks I have ever seen up close – they run right through the spine of the city. The lanes around them reveal some true photogenic gems, such as the Gendarmerie building, shown here.

Situated opposite the Great Mansouri Mosque towards Nejmeh Square, the building has long been deserted, although a car park has recently appeared outside. It is over 700 years old, and is distinguished by its old stones and elegant entrance.

The Gendarmerie building is considered one of the important historical landmarks of Tripoli, and has been designated as a first-class archaeological site as its construction dates back to the 1850s. It was witness to the renaissance of modern education in the city, built to be the headquarters of the first American school for girls in Lebanon, and then turned into a temporary headquarters for the motorised forces of the Gendarmerie, from which it takes its name. The building was later converted into a secondary school before becoming derelict.

Tripoli is full of unique architecture hidden among its lanes and alleyways, such as the hammams. Twelve hammams were listed as being in the historic city back in 1700, but today only five survive – three Mamluk and two Ottoman. Naturally, I have focussed on the two which are currently neglected.

Also located in the Slayeb neighbourhood of Zgharta, Dar Hamid Qabalan Frangieh proved to be the single most luxurious building that we visited during our time with Nissrine and Amiran.

The palace was probably built in the 19th century, but a floor was added during a later period, as suggested by its external architecture. It was evacuated in 1952 after being damaged by a lightning strike, and has been uninhabited ever since.

Whilst researching my first trip back in 2018, I came across an old photograph of an interesting palace with five (not the traditional three) arches, and a unique green tonality. The picture was titled as being in “Old Beirut”. To be honest, I had almost given up finding and photographing the location, thinking that it was such an old photo that the palace had probably since been demolished, as a consequence of war or years of continuous decay. Thankfully, my fears were proved unfounded.

Once through the main door, Nissrine let me take the lead up the final section of stairs to the top floor. Imagine my surprise when I walked into the large central room, and there it was – the same green palace from the photograph that I had seen back in 2018! Decayed, but perfectly preserved – it was clear from the undisturbed dust and rubble on the floor that barely anyone had set foot inside for many, many years.

The beautiful arches also appeared on the first postage stamp in Zgharta which was issued in 1972, and the building was placed on the general inventory of the Directorate General of Antiquities in 1982. Nowadays the palace is owned by the family of the former minister, Hamid Bey Frangieh.


#Byblos District – جبيل

Salim Beik Wehbe Palace

About a week after our day out with Nissrine, I met a guy called Tony whilst walking through the town of Amchit. At my request he guided us on foot to a mansion that I had noticed in an online article only the night before. The photograph in the article had been taken in 2017, so I had no idea of its current condition, or whether it had been renovated.

Tony explained to the current owner (Claude) the reason for our visit to the town, and Claude kindly agreed to let us photograph the upstairs section of the 120-year-old house. I am so glad we visited – it was a spectacular and beautiful home in the Italian style.

The house was built by Claude’s grandfather, Salim Beik Wehbe, who was born in 1833 and died in 1925. It once contained a printing and publishing office for a local newspaper, and these days it serves as a family home, as it was when it was first built.

As I was leaving Claude and his beautiful mansion, I bumped into an admirer of my work just outside the front door, which was a wonderful surprise – it is always a pleasure to chat with people who support what I do.


#House Ruins

Also situated on the outskirts of Amchit were the ruins of a small house that we discovered in passing. As my visit was purely spontaneous and unplanned, unfortunately I have been unable to find anything about its history.

It did, however, make for some interesting images, with the light pouring through the broken wooden slats above. The views looking towards the Mediterranean Sea were spectacular.

I’m 32F and looking to meet women to spend time with, whether that’s grabbing a coffee, checking out a new place in the city, or just having someone fun to hang out with.

I’m not very spontaneous, so I prefer planned outings over last-minute adventures. Think relaxed dinners, trying a new café, a weekend stroll, or just spending time chatting and laughing together. I’d love to connect with women who are easygoing, kind, and emotinally mature without too much pressure.

Open to friendships first, and if there’s a spark, I’m not against casual dates either. Mostly, I’d just like to find people I can feel comfortable around and share some fun experiences with.

Prefer women between the age of 28 - 37

Healing has been extremely rough. I was hoping for some special healing or something, but I wasn’t so lucky. Not completely anyway, but I did have to wait for a few days to be able to move around without crying. 

Kelsey and I have been getting along well enough, though it has been awkward. She basically had to nurse me back to health. It was weird because I had never had anyone do that for me before, and she was more than happy to answer my questions about the town. She isn’t hearing the calling anymore, but we think that town and the monster inside are still there. 

Finally, I decided to call my mom using a burner phone Kelsey got me. She didn’t recognize my voice and couldn’t recall who I was, even after I explained it to her. Whatever, she left me long before I left her. 

\-

The phone finally started ringing, and  I could hear it from my office, which surprised me because it was down on what Kelsey and I are calling the first floor. Kelsey is extremely interested in the building, and she feels more comfortable navigating it than I do. She told me that she would sketch maps and help get things organized. 

I made my way downstairs as fast as I could, but my leg made things difficult. The building changed again, too; the hallways became a little more organized. We also have chairs and tables; the biggest area is starting to look like a lobby of sorts. 

As soon as I got to the phone booth, the same wave of tension and fear washed over me again. I limped to the booth and opened the door. As I took the phone into my hand, I took a deep breath and leaned against the glass. 

\-

“Hello?” I mumbled as I licked my lips. 

“Sky. You did well. We know you retrieved Kelsey. The building will be in good hands under her. You both have special skills, but you must keep her out of the field.” The man on the other end of the phone says. 

“Okay.” I agreed, but I didn’t really agree, or rather, I didn’t fully understand. As we sat there in silence, it became clear that they weren’t going to explain anything to me. 

“Caleb is next. You’ll need him to help clean up the various areas where other people like you have been killed. You need to be careful, Sky. There are not many Marked people left. As for further staff, we are working on it.” The man said before I heard the phone get passed to someone else. 

“Sky.” A woman said. Her tone made my blood run cold. There was something different about her. 

“Yes? I’m here.” I whispered as I nearly put my head down. 

“Sky, you have an additional task. Caleb will be found at Greenridge High School. It is an extremely dangerous site that is overflowing with paranormal energy and so much more. His skill allows him to pull people back from a state of death. You mustn't allow him to do this. No more people are to be rescued from the high school or otherwise. Do you understand?” The woman said without taking so much as a single breath. 

“I understand.” I paused, remembering something important. 

“Is it possible that I can get a weapon?” I asked softly and slowly, knowing that I wasn’t supposed to be asking questions. 

“If your Marked Ability has been triggered, you will find a weapon in either your car or office.” The woman said before hanging up. 

\-

I told Kelsey where I was going and who I had to find, and went out to my car. The more I stayed up and moved, the more the pain faded away in my back and chest. Though my leg was still throbbing from time to time.

As I got into my car, I groaned and reclined the seat before noticing a briefcase in the passenger seat. I quickly reached over and popped open the briefcase. Sitting inside was a thick blue belt, a large flashlight, a set of keys, a badge, and a wallet. No weapon, but I suppose the flashlight would work in a pinch. The badge didn’t have a logo or anything on it aside from an image of me and my first and last name. Interestingly enough, the badge also contained a job title, “Secretary to the Director.” I scoffed and tucked the ID into the new wallet. A black credit card with no logo and $400 was waiting for me. I put the blue belt on and clipped the keys to it before starting the car and making my way to Greenridge. 

I set the GPS and started to drive, taking a moment to watch the technology. It was unlike any other GPS I had ever used and had a ton of input options. I could look for cities, towns, people, animals, but not items. Greenridge pulled up four different results. Greenridge (Town), Greenridge Private Academy, Greenridge (High School), Greenridge (REDACTED). I clicked the high school button, but made a note about the rest. 

\-

**The Curious Case of Greenridge** 

As soon as I approached Greenridge, I could tell something was off. I figured it was because I smacked my head, but the area around the town had a faint glow to it, purple. I’ll have to get more specific with the colors and remember what I’m seeing. 

I slowed the car down as I drove down the road and locked my doors. The houses looked as normal as you’d expect; if anything, they were each gorgeous to look at in their own way. Everyone had perfectly cut lawns, and if they didn’t have a lawn, the pavement was well-kept. No chipped paint, no dirty windows, and no dirty cars. People walked down the sidewalk or drove past me, but I didn’t notice anyone leaving the bounds of the town. 

It took me a minute to notice how perfect the roads were. There wasn’t a single pothole or pebble out of place. The more I looked around, the more I noticed other signs of perfection. The street lights were perfectly spaced apart, and each one looked brand new. The sidewalks looked fresh, and there was no graffiti. What stood out to me the most was the style of the town and the stores that I drove past. Everything had color, everything popped. The more I looked at the signs, the harder it became to continue driving, as if my brain was being actively pulled like a rubber band. I was able to fight the feeling for a little while before giving in and pulling over. I was drawn to a large, DONUT sign featuring a cartoon donut with large eyes and big white gloves. He had large yellow shoes with sprinkles on them. 

Charlie’s Donut Shop & Dougies Coffee Place sat next to each other, a shared pink building decorated with sprinkle decals. The windows were brought blue, and the sidewalk leading to the building was decorated with a frosting walkway. It was one of the most inviting buildings I had ever seen, and I couldn’t help but want to check it out. 

As I walked into the building, light music hit me like a soft wave. I slid my hair back and walked around slowly, trying to take in all of the atmosphere. The tables were shaped like large donuts, each with different frosting on top. The chairs were large coffee cups with cartoon characters on the label. The floor had smaller donuts and other breakfast decals on it, while the walls were decorated with various donut and coffee characters.

I walked over to the pink counter and smiled at the man behind it as I eyed the donut prices behind him. Everything was $1, so I wanted to order a dozen. 

“Hi! What can I get for you today, sweetheart?” The man said as he moved back a little to showcase the donut selection. 

Being called sweetheart made my skin crawl. His voice was a little too high-pitched to make me comfortable. As I blinked, I could see the light purple hue around the donuts. 

“Um.” I paused as my head throbbed. 

*Don’t eat anything until it’s been tested.* I heard in the back of my mind, it was not my voice nor the voice that my conscious normally presents itself as, weird, I know. 

“I’ll take 12 donuts of different flavors. I am feeling adventurous, so please surprise me. I would also like one cup of coffee.” I smiled at the man before shifting on my feet. 

He grabbed a bag to put the donuts in without taking his eyes off me. He bent his arm back a little and slowly took one donut off the back rack at a time. He never broke eye contact and never blinked. He put the bag on the counter and moved to get the coffee, finally breaking eye contact. 

“Are you from here?” He asked me in a low tone, completely different from when he called me sweetheart before. He sounded almost like a different person. 

“I am visiting my boyfriend,” I answered as he placed the coffee down, and I handed him $13. 

“Enjoy your time.” He said plainly as I took my goodies and quickly jogged back to my car. I put the items into the passenger seat and cupholder before starting the car and continuing to head to the high school. 

Something was definitely wrong here. 

\-

Once the high school came into view, I was shocked for two reasons. First, the place was gorgeous and looked like it had the backing of some extremely wealthy people. Second, I wasn’t expecting the place to be open. I could see kids leaving to catch their buses and decided to hang back. As far as I could tell from where I was, they looked completely normal. 

It took till around 5:30 PM for the place to clear out, and that’s when I spotted the car. A white buggy with a man sitting in the driver's seat. As soon as he started getting out of his car, I followed suit. I guess it was pretty obvious, but then again, I am not used to doing this. 

“Why are you watching me?” He shouted from across the parking lot. 

“Are you Caleb?” I called back as I tucked my hands into my pockets, trying to seem as calm as I possibly could. 

I watched him look both ways before jogging over to me. As soon as he got closer, he put his hand under his jacket, and I threw my hands up. 

“I am not here to-” I stopped talking the moment his gun was flashed to me. 

Caleb wasn’t anything like I was expecting him to be. He was a touch bigger and more rough looking. His facial hair was well-managed, and his wavy brown hair was combed back in such a way that he looked really official. 

“Who are you and what are you doing here?” Caleb asked me as he walked just a little closer to me before pausing. 

“I came looking for a man named Caleb. I was told that he would be here. I have no idea why the people who called need you, but I really need you to come back with me. Otherwise, I could die or something; they weren't specific.” I said as honestly as possible, I could feel my hands start shaking as I spoke. 

I watched him put the gun away with a sigh. 

“You must be like me if you can even exist here in a normal capacity.” He said as he put his gun away and walked closer. I motioned for him to follow me to my car, and he got in the passenger seat after moving my donuts. 

“I hope you’re not eating the food here,” Caleb said with grave seriousness. 

“Nope. I bought it to bring it back to uh the Foundation for lack of a better name.” I said as I proceeded to explain everything I could. I told him everything I could. I told him about Simon, the phone, Kelsey, and the monster. Eventually, I even slipped up and told him about my father before leaning on my car door and apologizing for oversharing. 

In return, Caleb told me everything he knew about this place.

“When I came back here, I left a lot behind, like a lot. Important people that I had grown to really care about, but I knew I had to come back. It was as if my body was begging for it, as if I didn’t come, I would go crazy. So my group and I had to split up, and those people were mostly like me or like us. Special.” Caleb paused as he slid a cigarette out of his jacket and lit it. 

“The first time I came back, everything was as I left it when I was younger. When we left, after we thought that we had destroyed the high school, the town was still normal. But when I came back, the town was as you saw it driving in. The stores were full of brands I had never heard of, and the high school was back and better than ever. My house was gone and replaced by what I have taken to calling Imposter Humans.” Caleb said as he inhaled before blowing smoke out of the passenger side window. 

“Okay, so what the hell happened?” I asked him as I reclined my seat back and watched the sun set behind the high school before it abruptly paused in the air, sending chills down my spine. 

“That’s what I am investigating. As far as I can tell, we are not the only people here who are not impostors. This school, though, is drawing the erm special kids. I had rescued a few before, but I think these are different. I’m sorry, I don’t have the words to describe what I mean.” Caleb apologized as he took another drag of his cigarette. 

“I was told not to let you rescue anyone else,” I told Caleb as I turned to face him. 

“I need answers, and if I can save even one person, I will. If you want to bail now, you can.” Caleb said. 

\-

“Can you tell me about the high school?” I asked as I got more comfortable. I wasn’t leaving without Caleb. 

“The groundskeeper told me that sets of 4 kids were killed here originally. 5 kids were supposed to die in each set. Each time a murder happened, the next one was guaranteed to be more gruesome. He told me that people were divided over the murders, but I never found a single newspaper about the incident. No murderer was ever caught after 13 murders.” Caleb shook his head and proceeded to tell me about the killer teachers found inside the building. 

""The strange thing is, he told me that the last two that were supposed to be killed were two girls. I met a woman named Cassandra who was looking for her sister, Hannah. Her brother had died, and on my way back, I thought about the murders. I think more people died here than I was told about, and I think the history is twisted.” Caleb said seriously. 

As I listened to him speak, I felt a sharp pain slide down the back of my head. It was as if a row of pins and needles consumed my brain. I turned my head to the school as my head throbbed and I balled my hands into fists. 

I had to be here. 

\-

Caleb and I waited for a while before deciding that we would go to the school together in the morning, and for now, we would move our cars closer to the trees. We decided to camp for the night, not knowing just how horrifying this experience would really be. 

\-

“Sky, get ready,” Caleb said as I opened my eyes. I pinched my nose and put my hair in a bun, tucked my shirt in, and tried to make myself look as presentable as possible. 

As we walked into the school, my headache got worse. At its peak, it felt like my brain was going to explode, but the feeling went away as soon as we walked through the front door. 

We were greeted by large groups of people and a large gecko decal on the floor. We could hear the band playing in the auditorium just to our left. Caleb looked at the area longingly. As the teenagers walked by us, they seemed to ignore us completely. No one turned to look at us, but strangely, they did walk around us. 

They were all dressed like they fell out of an old school movie. I tried to listen to some conversations, but it seemed like they were speaking complete gibberish, at least to me. Though Caleb did pull out a notepad to write down what we were hearing. 

\-

“Mine as well make her drink toilet water. Dirty Heretic. God Weeps.” 

“Molten Rocks Set Us Free.” 

“Bet She Tastes Like Liquid Gold. Clean. Diamonds.” 

“Cats do not football. East. East. North. West.” 

\-

I made a face, I couldn’t help it. Something about the words was unnerving, and I was eager for Caleb to lead the way. 

“We should go classroom to classroom,” Caleb suggested, and I could only nod. He seemed like he knew what he was doing. 

Following Caleb felt right, like filling in the piece of a puzzle in a way. 

\-

We walked into the auditorium to see what was going on, and we made sure to stay in the back. The song was horrible, like what someone might think good music sounds like. The wind instruments sounded like they were dying. 

The teenagers playing had elongated fingers that seemed to have bones in weird places. It made me cringe. I watched as they attempted to play their instruments before slowly backing out of the room with Caleb. 

\-

We checked out the gym next, and I was not prepared for what we found. Boys with elongated legs played basketball with what I can best describe as a bloody meatball. As it bounced off the floor, it left bloody circles on the ground. They spoke the same nonsense as the others, but their voices were much deeper. We exited quickly and continued to walk around. 

Eventually, we found ourselves in a classroom labeled “Astronomy-1.” 

“Something feels off about this one,” I whispered to Caleb as my headache came back, though much lighter. 

“We will be quick,” Caleb mumbled as he slowly opened the door. 

I nearly had a heart attack. 

They were looking at us; some had eyes that were too large, while others had eyes that were too small. Some had longer fingers, while others had fingers that were far too short. I watched as one of the boys, if you could call it that, smiled at me. It was a crude smile, teeth on top of teeth, and a brown tongue greeted me. It made me want to puke. 

“Can I help you?” The teacher said as she put down her instruments and turned to us. She was tall and lacked knees. Her shape was something like what you might find in a child's drawing. She was so misshapen that I briefly wondered how she was speaking. 

I took one last glance around the room before getting ready to speak, and that is when I saw the girl in the corner. I watched her write in a notebook; I could see the tears running down her face. She was shaking. 

She had to be human. 

“We are here to pick up our daughter for a dentist appointment.” I spat out without much of a second thought as I motioned to the girl. The other students all quickly turned to look at her. 

The teacher smiled a little and got a little closer to me before saying, “Astrid, your mother is here to pick you up.” 

The girl looked up at me. We couldn’t be that far apart in age, but I was hoping the Imposter Humans wouldn’t notice. I was trying to get her to go along with it, and luckily, she did. She got up and moved to us like her shoes were on fire. She didn’t even bother to bring her notebook, just her backpack. 

“Have a good day.” The teacher hung onto her last word a little too long for my liking as she watched us exit the doorway. 

\-

“Are you okay?” I asked Astrid the moment the door closed. It was a stupid question. She looked like he had been crying for hours. 

“No,” Astrid said as she rubbed her eyes, and Caleb motioned for us to hurry up and follow him. 

“We can’t leave yet. My sister is still here.” Astrid informed us as we rushed to the front door. This time, the other students were looking at us; they didn’t take their eyes off us. They just stood there, unblinking. 

The feeling of unease that had been slowly growing in my stomach was getting too intense to ignore. 

“Where is she?” Caleb asked in a hushed tone. 

“The library,” Astrid said as Caleb motioned for her to lead the way. 

\-

I had been on edge this whole time, and I thought that I was better at hiding it. Maybe I was getting used to all of this? But then the intercom kicked on, and I knew that I wasn’t getting used to anything. 

“Astrid. I know that you are with people who are not supposed to be here. Come to the main office right now, or there will be severe consequences.” A man said. His voice made me pause, but only for a moment. 

Caleb continued pushing forward as the man continued to speak. 

“Astrid. Do you remember what happened to your mother when she tried this? Do you remember what she smelled like?” He pushed. 

“Ignore it,” Caleb said, but it was hard to ignore. The look on Astrid's face made me want to cry for her. 

\-

As soon as we reached the library, a putrid odor hit my nose, making me gag. Astrid did the same, and I could hear Caleb grunting. We quickly made our way around the bookshelves until we could hear crying. 

We took a sharp left, and my body froze. I was too scared to move. Too in shock to pull out my flashlight. We were standing before a man in a black suit, his body had been completely torn open, entrails strewn across the brown carpet. Half of his skull was missing, his fingers looked like they had been chewed off. 

A girl sat next to the man, her hand intertwined with her long blonde hair. 

“Stella,” Astrid whispered as she went over to force her sister to stand up. 

\-

“Holy…” Caleb trailed off as he examined the books. 

“Look at this.” He said as he tapped me. It was clear that he was trying his best to keep his eyes off the body. 

As I faced the bookshelf, I paused and had to do a double-take; there were hundreds of yearbooks. Greenridge High School 2000, 2045, 1834, 1995, 532, 3000, and so forth. 

“That can’t be right. I went to this school, and it was never like this.” Caleb mumbled as my eyes landed on a book with a blue spine. I slid it off the shelf and read the cover, “Greenridge High School 2000: Origin.” 

I turned to Astrid and asked her to open her backpack so I could put the book inside. She did without any hesitation. 

\-

“Who is that?” I asked Stella as I glanced down at the body. 

“He said he was here to help,” Stella whispered as her lip quivered and she turned away from the body. “The Librarian took care of him.” She continued as I bent over to check the body. It took everything I had not to throw up. He was still warm. 

I used my foot to move his jacket; he was lying on a red folder, so I carefully took the folder out from under his body. 

“Greenridge” was printed on the cover. I slid it into Astrid’s backpack before pausing. Something was breathing around us. It was loud, heavy, but also sounded wet. Like someone had phlegm caught in their chest. 

I quickly looked around before getting a sinking feeling in my stomach. I grabbed Caleb’s arm as I slowly glanced up. Staring down at us was a grossly disfigured woman. Her hair sat on one side of her skull; it looked almost like melting ice cream. Her eyes had completely sunk in on themselves, and her nose looked like it had been peeled off with a potato peeler. She only had one ear, and her fingers were long enough to reach over the top of the shelf. 

I screamed, I stood there screaming as she opened her mouth to reveal rows of human and what could be animal teeth. She moved so quickly that the bookshelf she was balancing on started to give way. If Caleb didn’t force us to move, we would’ve been crushed. 

We ran down the hall so quickly that the pain in my leg started coming back. Though it was duller than before, it still hurt like hell. It didn’t matter, though. I had to keep moving. 

“There's an exit! But I could never open the door!” Stella called to us as we ran past more books. 

My heart was going a million miles per second, or at least it felt like it. 

\-

The Librarian gained on us quickly. Caleb and Stella led the charge, but I could feel myself getting slower. I could see tears gathering in my eyes as Astrid passed me, and before I knew it, I felt something grab my good leg. 

I cried out as I fell forward, slamming my nose on the floor. I could hear it break; it's a sound I’ll never forget. I broke out in screams as the creature dragged me backward. I moved my arms as fast as possible to try to grab the carpet. One of my fingernails was pushed back into my skin while another was broken, and I could feel my hands bleeding. 

I was flipped over onto my back to meet the creature's distorted face. She let out an awful hiss, something between that of a growl and the hiss of a snake. I felt its hand tighten around my legs as I struggled to break free. 

My mind was a buzz, my heart felt like it was hitting my chest like a rock hitting a window. Tears poured down my face as I spat blood out; I felt it land near my eyes. It pulled me a little closer before pops rang out from behind me. The creature let go as a hand dragged me backward. 

“Come on! My bullets won’t kill it!” Caleb screamed as I turned my head to see Astrid dragging me back. 

I was forced to my feet as we charged across the library and right out the back door. I was moving so fast that the world around us became a blur. Caleb took us to my car and had me hand over the keys. As we drove away from the high school, I watched the area around us. People who were walking on the sidewalk or driving past us looked right at us. We were being watched intently. Stores we drove by flipped their signs from open to closed. I told Caleb to use the GPS, enter Home in, and take us there. 

At the time, I forgot that I was told not to let him use his abilities. 

\-

As soon as we got back, I raced inside. I wanted to be alone, and I figured that Kelsey would show them around. I was still shaking and crying; it felt like I couldn’t breathe. I made my way to my office and shut the door to try and decompress. 

Once I was able to breathe again, I did what I could to clean the blood from my face. I’d have to buy new clothes because this shirt was trashed. I exhaled before I noticed the sound of a phone ringing. 

As I exited my office, I noticed that there were more office doors, way more. At least 7 new ones. I didn’t bother to see what Kelsey had done to her office; I limped down to the phone as fast as possible. 

\-

“Sky.” A man said to me as soon as I picked up the phone. 

“Yes?” I coughed before cleaning some blood from my lip. 

“Did you retrieve Caleb?” The man asked. 

“Yes,” I answered, thinking that it was weird that they even had to ask. They just knew Kelsey was here when I brought her back a few days ago. 

“Good. Your services are no longer needed. You will be terminated by the end of the week.” The man said before hanging up the phone. 

A feeling of looming dread pushed into me as I put the phone up and pushed my body into the glass. It felt like I was about to be hunted, like eyes were on me that I couldn’t see. This wave of fear was different; it was primal. 

I stood there in contemplation for a moment before the phone rang again. I reached over to grab it, cleaning the fresh tears from my cheeks slowly. 

\-

“Hello?” I coughed as I tried to steady my hand. 

“Skyler, I am with the Board. You need not be in distress. You need only to find the Director. Instructions have been left at your desk as well as some fresh clothing for your journey.” A man said before the line went dead.

1mv5rx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepwork/comments/1mv5rx5/7_principles_from_deep_work_that_actually/,"7 principles from ""Deep Work"" that actually transformed my output (and why shallow work was destroying my potential)","Read this book when I realized I was ""busy"" all day but accomplishing nothing meaningful. Constantly switching between tasks, checking notifications every 5 minutes, and wondering why my most important projects never got done. Here's what actually transformed how I work:

1. Deep work is a superpower, shallow work is quicksand

I started tracking my time and was horrified at how 80% of my day was spent on emails, meetings, and random tasks that felt urgent but weren't important. Now I block 3-4 hours daily for deep work on my most valuable projects. I now accomplish more in those focused hours than I used to in entire days.

2. Attention residue is killing your focus

Every time you switch tasks, part of your brain stays stuck on the previous task. I used to jump from writing to emails to Slack to research. Now I batch similar tasks and use transition rituals (like a 2-minute walk) between deep work sessions to fully reset my attention.

3. Create rituals, not just schedules

I built a specific deep work ritual: same coffee shop corner, noise-canceling headphones, phone in airplane mode, and a legal pad for capturing random thoughts. The consistency signals to my brain that it's time to focus. My brain now automatically shifts into deep work mode when I follow this routine.

4. Embrace productive meditation

During walks or mundane tasks like folding laundry, I practice productive meditation - focusing deeply on a single professional problem. No phone, no music, just pure thinking time. I've solved more complex problems during 20-minute walks than in hours of scattered desk time.

5. Quit social media (or at least tame it)

I deleted Instagram and Twitter from my phone and only check them from my laptop during designated times. The constant dopamine hits were training my brain to crave distraction. Now I can read for hours without feeling the urge to check my phone every few minutes.

6. Schedule every minute (but stay flexible)

I started time-blocking my entire day, not just work hours. Even leisure time gets blocked. This isn't about being rigid but about being intentional. When interruptions happen (and they will), I quickly adjust the remaining blocks. No minute goes unaccounted for.

7. Work like hell, then shut down completely

I created a shutdown ritual: review tomorrow's priorities, close all tabs, say ""schedule shutdown complete"" out loud. After this ritual, I don't check work emails or think about projects. This complete separation allows my brain to recharge and often leads to breakthrough insights the next day.

I stopped glorifying ""busy"" and started measuring my days by depth, not hours logged. One hour of deep work on my book project is worth more than six hours of shallow email responses.

My biggest mistake before was thinking I could multitask my way to productivity. The human brain doesn't multitask it task-switches, and every switch costs focus and energy.",3,1755666413.0,deepwork,0,1.0,False

1mv5qve,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mv5qve/upgrade_to_x54/,Upgrade? To x54,"Hello coffee enthusiasts! I recently upgraded my coffee setup from a manual J-Ultra and Cafelat robot to the X54 and Bambino Plus. My previous setup was excellent for making espresso, with a large espresso dial range that allowed me to easily experiment with different beans and note down the exact clicks. The robot was also great, and as a lever machine, I could adjust the pre-infusion and pressure settings to my liking. In my opinion, this setup offered the best features and longevity at a reasonable price, even though it required some time and manual work.

Recently, I moved to another country and needed a quick coffee maker for the morning before work. After researching, I decided to go with the X54. I believe that the grinder is more important than the machine itself. The Bambino Plus is a great choice so far. I’m getting delicious coffee, and the few seconds it takes to heat up is fantastic. The steamer is excellent, and I haven’t had any complaints about the Bambino.

I was excited about the flat burrs on the X54, but I must admit that it feels like a downgrade from the J-Ultra when it comes to dialing in. The espresso range is quite limited, but I’m glad that I can quickly switch between espresso and Aeropress. Overall, I’m getting great coffee from the X54, but the dialing in was worse than I expected. Additionally, the hopper seems to be getting loose, and I’ve started getting occasional errors, which may prompt me to return it.

I’m considering whether to replace the X54 or get something else. I’d love to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks for taking the time to read my rant!",1,1755666317.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I’m currently running a Bambino Plus (happy with it for now) and a Breville Smart Grinder Pro. I drink primarily americanos 1-2 a day with an occasional latte once or twice a week. My attempts at straight espresso have not been great, and I realize my attempts at ‘nicer’ coffee beans have been medium roasts that may not be well suited for my current grinder. I think for my use case, a grinder that provides good texture for a variety of bean roasts is ideal. 

I believe I’ve narrowed my selection to grinders that provide a good amount of texture, and now deciding between single dose vs hopper style grinder. 

I enjoy the hoper style of the breville as I like the workflow. I’ve never used a single dose grinder and unsure if the added step will be disruptive. I currently weigh dial in my espresso for each new bag and adjust midway through a hopper full as the beans age, but don’t weigh each grind every time. I know this isn’t ‘perfect’, but is the added work worth it?

I’ve ruled out the niche zero mostly because I don’t like the way it looks if I’m being honest. So currently between the Lagom casa and eureka specialita. 

Any other grinders I’m missing? People seem to love the timemores as well, but is it fair to say the Lagom will provide better texture? Any other timed grinders worth looking at? Willing to spend up to $1,000.

The fake positivity actually made my interviews worse. I came across like I was performing. This unnatural manner of expression also affected my thinking and response to the interviewer's questions.

Prue - Telekinesis 

Prue’s telekinesis would grow into being able to use telekinetic materialization, like in episode 1 when she materialized the creamer into the coffee. She would also be able to levitate, essentially using telekinesis on her body. 

Piper - Molecular Immobilization 

Piper’s power would grow in the same principle (slowing molecules down to speeding them up), but instead of huge explosion, they would cause flames. It would be similar to the witch in episode 1 that lights a candle using her finger. She would start off only being able to use this power in close proximity and only be able to create small flames/heat, but could eventually grow into being a strong offensive power. 

Phoebe - Premonitions

Phoebe’s powers would grow into astral projection. Seriously, I don’t understand why Prue got that power and Phoebe got levitation. Anyways this would be really useful for Phoebe being able to astral project and fight in close quarters in a low risk way. She could also learn to astral project into other people’s dreams/subconscious which could become a form of mind reading or communication. 

Paige - Telekinesis 

First of all, I’m taking away telekinetic orbing. Sorry, it was corny. While I’m at it I’m also taking away orbing, it was just too convenient. Paige’s powers would grow into telekinetic healing, combing her witch and white lighter side. She would be able to stop bleeding, close wounds, and extract poisons. It wouldn’t be a cure-all like whitelighter light, but it could save a life.

I no longer wanted to provide for them dahil nawalan na ako online business and ang dami ko rin failed decisions in life. I didn’t wanna be called as masamang anak kaya kahit walang-wala na ako noon, pinilit ko pa rin magbigay at noong napagod na ko sa routine na yun, I ran away from home. 

I don’t know if I was selfish at that time na unahin ko naman yung sarili ko kahit wala akong pera basta makaalis lang sa bahay na yun. Ang dami ko pinagdaanan. Naranasan ko magpa-umaga na nakaupo lang sa park kakahintay mag ka-job offer, natulog ako sa coffee shop, nakitira ako sa ibang bahay at na harass pa ako that time, at nagmakaawa sa pamilya ko kung pwede bigyan ako ng kahit ₱50 pangkain lang. Mag isa lang ako noong mga panahon na yun. Wala sila noon. Pakiramdam ko tinalikuran ako ng pamilya ko kasi nakikita ko naman noon na nakakabangon na ulit sila at may pera na. Sabi ko sa sarili ko bakit pinabayaan ako? 

I built my boundaries. Noong nakabangon ako at may trabaho na, sinabi ko sa sarili ko na hindi ko na hahayaan na masira ulit yung peace of mind ko dahil lang sa family ko. After a year of not getting in touch with them, isa sa mga gusto ko i-work out this year ay ang makipag reconcile sa kanila. I started visiting the house again — I get to sleep there, niyayaya ko sila lumabas sometimes to eat out, and binibigyan ko kahit papaano yung sister ko kasi nag aaral pa. I was happy at that point kasi ito yung gusto ko na limitations. Ayoko na nung obligado ako at masaya ako sa bond and connection na nabubuo ko with my parents/family. 

But I was wrong. I crossed my boundaries just because I was enjoying the moment that I get to be with them again. They borrowed money from me a month ago. Without hesitations I gave in at sabi ko pa sa sarili ko, I gave the money that I can afford to lose eh kaso tinalo ko pa rin sarili ko. I gave 5 digits and some portion of that was from my savings. Now that I’m asking them if they could give back some money kahit hindi lahat, basta may maibalik lang — I became the bad daughter. They don’t wanna pay now dahil pinahiram daw nila sa ibang tao yung pera nila at naghihintay pa sila mabayaran yun. Ang ending ay kailangan ko rin maghintay. 

This situation fucks my mental health. It flashed back all the happenings from the past. I should’ve done better to not allow them ruin what I’ve built for a year. This is not about the amount of money, this is about my trust issues with them kasi pakiramdam ko na betray nanaman ako. I couldn’t stand that I let this happen again. Hindi ba ako natuto noon? 

I filed a sudden leave from my work because I couldn’t think straight, 3 days na ako hindi pumapasok hindi pa kasali dun yung sick leave ko na 5 days naman noong first week of August. I feel so lost again. 

I can’t let this shit push me to be a failure again. ",17,1755663785.0,OffMyChestPH,13,0.96,False

Question: How does an Event go when Sensei is stuck with a laptop and it's not very clear what to enter?  
Answer: The event (The Change of Seasons) before the second reboot (There is Nothing) with the laptop (for those who did not notice the hint-the piece of paper that I drew on the board!!)  
1. the terminal number is 23 (Maya tells Sensei about the 23 circles of Hell;  
2. The IP address is 2342:5b7:489:de26:c666:x994:3126:b067 (this address was specified elsewhere - Trinity part 3, when the delivery time was specified);  
3. The port number is 1024 (the first of the messages registered via TCP, UDP is repeated);  
4. Username - only 5 options: HOPE, USER1, USER3, USER4, USER2 (try everything, the letters are uppercase, it's not difficult to guess where they come from);  
5. Boobies123 (the password pops up in conversation with Ami, when Sensei made all his passwords the same).  
\#  
  
Question: Everything is gone for me, no one is anywhere, and it says that the world is collapsing, what should I do?  
Answer: To promote the Event, you need to do the following:  
\- go to the sanctuary (where Sensei meets Maya) and pray to God.  
\- repeat at least 5 times.  
\- after that, on Sunday morning, you will have a new choice in the movement menu and you must send Sensei to school.

Question: I have a strikethrough event on the Nodoka ""Seeing Red"", does this mean that I missed something? Or the Question: How do I execute an event with a Node - ""What Causes Pain""?  
Answer: ""A little guide to 25.5 or those who miss the scene at Nodoka things that hurt/Things that hurt In order to see this scene, it is necessary that Yumi does not know that Sensei is ""dating"" Chika, it depends on a certain order of actions that we performed in the Second Chapter. The main scenes are the event Abyss at Yumi and Small Miracles at Chika, and specifically in what order these scenes were viewed if the first one was Yumi, then she doesn't know about the relationship between Sensei and Chika, if the first one is Chika, then Yumi knows about Sensei and Chika.""  
\#  
  
Question: Which word of the day should I enter? Question: How many animals are there?  
Answer: The Event "" Word Of The Day"". The word of the day: Perception (on the slide).  
Bird number: 58320582157 (on the same slide).  
Clock numbers: 2374820 (during the Happy Scene on the wall in the upper right corner).  
Heads: 4 (during the Scene of Happiness under the table).  
Love is: blindness (during the Scene of Happiness, the slide of the teacher and her ""sunflower"", on the clock at the top left).  
You're happy: yes (well, that's understandable)

Yes, Celebus has various Easter eggs (to be added), try stroking the girls on the head (MANY times) before the ""finale""  
  
  
Question: The event related to the first trip to the beach does not begin in any way!  
Answer: To activate this Event, you must:  
\- day 174+, Saturday, completed the ""Scientific Research"" event, completed the ""Back to the Heat"" event with Ami, completed the ""Much Less Scary"" event with Futaba, completed the ""Aim at the Balls"" event with Makoto, completed the ""Accomplices in Crime"" event with Kirin, completed the ""Snake Venom"" event with Tsunei, performed the ""Dark Essence"" event with Molly, performed the ""Sock Fetish"" event with Rin, performed the ""Supermom"" event with Sana.  
\#  
  
Question: What should I do to trigger the ""Overwrite"" Event?  
Answer: In order for the Overwrite Event to start, it is necessary:  
Day 102+, Sunday, the ""Reminder"" Event, the ""Letter T"" Happiness Scene (the ""Mocha Cafe"" event with Rin must be completed and upon arriving at the dorm, choose to Go Home), the ""How Do I Feel"" Happiness Scene (the ""Additional Event"" event with Chika must be completed)  
\#

Q: I don't want to be a bastard, so I decided to give Rin a chance, what should I do?  
Answer: if you don't want to be a bastard, do as described below.:  
Sensei/Chika/Rin relationship and Rin's cheating (SPOILER!!!):  
In the story, Rin admits to Sensei that she has fallen in love with Chika and asks him if he is messing with Chika. There are 2 options here:  
1. when you cheat on Rin and build a relationship with Chika behind her back (Schadenfreude critical event).  
2. when you calmly wait for Rin to gather her courage and confess to Chika.  
Total. There's a big story event where everyone goes to the beach in a crowd, ""What's done is done."" If you want to get to know Chica ""Adenroyd"", THEN she should be next to you, and this name is replaced by the first one - ""Love life let go"" (so developed. marks failed events). Well, if Sensei kept a gun in his pants and didn't grope a Chick in the dorm before Rin's confession, then he will be an honest guy (relatively) and a ""bro"" for Rin, and possibly someone more.  
\#  
  
Question: The ""As Loud As a Whisper Can Be"" Event is not triggered, what should I do?  
Answer: To trigger An Event As Loudly As A Whisper Can be, it is necessary:  
1. It should be day 214+ (Monday)  
2. The quadrillion billion trillion event has been completed  
3. Maki Miyamura's mission in Mom mode (Maki)  
4. Blue Jay (Makoto)  
5. One. Two. Three. (To Miku)

Question: I can't go through the fourth reboot, there are a lot of incomprehensible questions from the game and I don't remember anything anymore!  
Answer: To create ""Life, the full version"", you can team up with me, - said Kaiser. (Thank you!)  
The first journal is 85  
The second journal is denim  
The third journal is Judas  
Fourth journal - 18  
The fifth journal - coffee is more difficult. At the first interaction, none of the answers will be correct. After interacting with the magazine at least once, you need to call Tojo Ramen by phone from the board 08023231234. Sensei will ask Tsuneya about this assignment. She will give the answer.  
Sixth journal - Marsh warbler  
Seventh journal - 4863  
The eighth journal Has a few questions there:  
1. What year of solitaire is  - 1788  
2. what color is the scarf - green  
3. how many gallons are in the bathroom - 80  
4. What is one answer here? - 4  
5. How old are you - 31  
6. which bird makes a bridge - a magpie  
7. What is the word of the day - perception  
The Ninth journal, It seems, depends on the choice in that very survey. From the question ""WHICH OF THESE WORDS BEST DESCRIBES YOUR CURRENT STATE OF MIND,"" There were three options. Indifference, Calmness, and Worry. My choice was Anxiety. Based on this. The Ninth journal said that it could not give the key, but gave a free trial of the premium. The laptop has an item called ""unlock all puzzle answers"", which allows you to change the selection if you have a bonus. I chose Indifference. And the ninth journal changed and gave me a piece of the key. Perhaps if you initially chose Indifference, then the ninth journal will simply give you a piece. To do this, you need to eat squid 26 times.  
The password for laptop is Boobies123  
And you get another piece of the key if you eat rice 23 times.  
The scene of happiness is to play the lottery on a laptop. The ticket number is 157842. (Attention, you will be marked as a cheater if you go through this happiness scene without going through another ""Good Boy"" happiness scene, and this may spoil some of the moments in the game for you)  
\#  
  
Question: I can't go through the fifth reboot.  
Answer: To get the ""Nameless"" answer, you need to answer the questions you have asked, answer some of them below.  
Yumi: Question No. 1 kindergarten question No. 2 Okinawa, Tokashiku beach Question No. 3 water  
Tsuneya: Question #1 Franklin Delano Roosevelt question #2 zero, 0 Question #3 Tori shio, Tori shio ramen  
Maya: question #1 violin question #2 masks question #3 Niki, Niki Nakayama  
Ayane: a question of your choice  
\#  
  
Question: How to start the last (16) scene of happiness.  
Answer: Sena, a participant in the ""Small Stuff"", works during a simple download if you are mainly answering an additional question. The correct answer is: a cute puppy  
\#  
  
Q: How do I go through the last reboot at the end of Chapter 3?  
Answer: You don't have to use the guide for the new edition of the Times New Roman.  
A guide for creating the Times New Roman.  
Note: you can get into Ami's laptop, which is in the kitchen, and unlock the Happiness Scene (the laptop password is mom).
