by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Carolina Hurricanes vs. Minnesota Wild: A Puck-ture of Chaos and Confidence**

The NHL’s most thrilling mismatch of offensive fireworks and defensive fragility arrives Wednesday as the **Carolina Hurricanes** (-151) roll into St. Paul to face the **Minnesota Wild** (+127). Let’s break this down with the precision of a Zamboni and the humor of a penguin on a trampoline.

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Goalies

Carolina’s case for victory is as sturdy as a brick wall… if that wall were built entirely of pucks. The Hurricanes are second in the league in goals scored (69 total, 3.6 per game) and boast a +15 goal differential. Their star, Sebastian Aho (18 points), is the team’s culinary equivalent of a five-star chef—consistent, reliable, and never serving a dish named “loss.” Defensively? Well, they’re not exactly the Great Wall of China, allowing 2.5 goals per game. But when your offense can outscore most teams’ entire seasons, who needs a functional defense?

Minnesota, meanwhile, is the NHL’s version of a leaky sieve. They’re 22nd in goals scored (2.8 per game) and 22nd in goals allowed (3.0 per game), with a -6 differential that’s about as appealing as a root canal. Their recent injury crisis has forced rookie **Danila Yurov**, 21, into a top-line center role. Yurov’s NHL resume? One assist in his previous game. His new job: sandwiched between Kirill Kaprizov and Mats Zuccarello like a rookie intern thrust into a corner office. Spoiler: He’s probably still figuring out where the coffee machine is.

**Implied probabilities**? Carolina’s -151 line suggests bookmakers give them a 60% chance to win. Minnesota’s +127 line implies 43.5%—which is generous if you’ve seen their defense. The Over/Under of 6 goals? A nod to Carolina’s offensive artillery and Minnesota’s porous net.

1p1009g,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1p1009g/long_time_lurker_appreciation_post/,Long time lurker appreciation post,"Just a huge thank you to everyone who has shared their experiences (good, bad and funny) in here! It's been so helpful for me in the leadup to my surgery. Reading through the wide range of experiences helped me decide to go ahead and to know what to expect, what to ask about, how to prepare etc. 

My surgery was on 16/11 and I thought I'd share some stuff about my experience. Some of this info is Australia-specific, which could be useful for some people.

I had my hysterectomy and salpingectomy done at a public hospital and my experience was incredible. Once I was on the waiting list for the hysterectomy, it was only about a 6 week wait. They ended up using morcellation, where they cut things up inside a bag internally so they could remove it through the laparoscopic incision in my bellybutton. This was because I had a pretty large fibroid and they determined it was slightly too big to remove vaginally without risking damaging my vagina, and it meant they didn't have to do an open abdominal surgery. They'd determined that it was an incredibly low chance that there was anything cancerous in there, so they were confident morcellation would be safe. They talked me through this before the surgery. The procedure all went well and they found some superficial endometriosis on my cervix, but nowhere else. I stayed in hospital for one night, and they were very happy to let me stay another night or two if I felt I needed it, but all the nurses and doctors told me I was recovering amazingly well. I was definitely ready to go home to the comfort of my own bed. I was pleasantly surprised to get a private room - I'd expected a shared room and went in prepared with earplugs and noise cancelling headphones. The only downside was that there was someone in the next room with a baby and I never got to see the baby haha! Total cost ended up being $32 for the prescription meds they sent me home with, and $10 parking when my partner picked me up. Extremely grateful for our healthcare system, which has its flaws but has been wonderful. Very happy for my tax to be paying for this incredible healthcare for everyone. I know a few people who have gone through the private healthcare system here and had very similar experiences, the only difference has been that they've been able to choose who their surgeon is (and one of them had a balcony!). My surgery was classed as category 2, meaning they aim for a max wait time of 90 days, so if you were category 3 (6 months) it could be a better option to go with the shorter wait times in the private system if you have the insurance and money to cover it.

I did have some pretty unpleasant gas pain and bloating. Day 2 or 3 post op was probably the worst for that, although the post op pain on the day of surgery probably would have been worse but they kept me very well medicated in hospital haha! The best thing I did for that was keeping moving, just gently and slowly walking around for 5-10 minutes most hours after my catheter was removed the day after surgery. I've also been using De-gas and drinking peppermint tea. Don't know how much they've helped, but they haven't hurt. I'm still a little bloated now (day 6 PO) but my pain is very low.

I had my first bowel movement late on day 2 post op. The first one was not particularly soft, which sucked, but I breathed my way through it. I've been using stool softener (Movicol) and drinking prune juice (a warrior's drink!) since after the surgery, I feel like if I'd started the day before it may have been better, so I'll remember that for the next time I have a hysterectomy lol! Since then they've all been soft without being diarrhoea, so they've been pretty easy to pass without straining. They take a while so don't try to rush it. One thing I've noticed is that I'm often unsure if I'm going to fart or shit, so I've been going to the bathroom just in case a lot. So far I have not shat myself, so I'll take the win! I have a Squatty Potty which is a game changer for pooping even without going through this, so I highly recommend that or a similar stool/yoga blocks/whatever to elevate your feet a bit while you're on the loo.

Having multiple normal pillows to arrange in different ways is great. I have 4 due to my endless and ongoing quest for the perfect pillow, so I'm glad I've kept them all despite their imperfections! I didn't get any special pillows and don't feel like I missed out on anything, although those hysterectomy pillows with the pockets do look like they'd be pretty nifty. Having something to grab in bed to help me sit up and change positions could have been useful, but I've managed fine without it. My partner (who has been absolutely wonderful) has been there most of the time to help with that sort of stuff though, so if you have limited help it could be worth it. Same for grabbers.

I've been pretty exhausted, sleeping for about double my normal amount each night (normally I only sleep about 5-6 hours) and napping during the day. Incredibly grateful to have all the time off I need. I've started side sleeping again, which I was worried about as I find it hard to sleep on my back. I'm kind of propping my abdomen against one of my pillows for this, which reduces the discomfort of feeling like things are pulling or stretching.

One of my friends gave me one of those lap table things, which has been so helpful. I live in a smallish apartment so we don't have a dining table and just eat on the couch, either leaning forward to eat off the coffee table or just holding our plates/bowls. The lap table has been amazing for this.

Something interesting I've noticed is that having a full bladder feels weird. I think my bladder may have been irritated from the cystoscopy and catheter - for the first few days it was kind of painful when it was full, but it didn't hurt to pee or afterwards so I don't suspect a UTI. That's gone down, but it still feels kind of weird. I think my body is having to relearn what a full bladder feels like after having it squashed for so long by the fibroid. It's amazing not having to pee every 45 minutes!

Once again, a huge thank you to each and every one of you who have made this community such a supportive place. The whole process has been much less intimidating for the level of knowledge and experiences shared here.

Wishing you all the best with whatever stage of your journey you're on! Happy to answer any questions or elaborate on anything. Love to youse all! ",1,1763533051.0,hysterectomy,0,1.0,False

Rowena knew the adults that fed her were not her parents. Parents didn’t have magical contracts that forced you to use your magical gifts for them, and they didn’t hurt you when you disobeyed. Slavery under magical contracts are also illegal in the Kingdom of Erisdale, which is prospering peacefully after a great continent-wide war.

Rowena’s owners don’t know, however, that she can see potential futures and anyone’s past that is not her own. She uses these powers to escape and break her contract and go on her own journey. She is going to find who she is, and keep her clairvoyance secret

Yet, Rowena’s attempts to uncover who she is drives her into direct conflict with those that threaten the peace and prove far more complicated than she could ever expect. Finding who you are after all, is simply not something you can solve with any kind of magic.

*Rowena acts quickly to respond to Forlana and Alastor's provocation, and it's... not without effect...*

Rowena and Jess had just made it to their carriage when Gwen caught up, panting.

“Wena, are you serious? What was that?” the Alavari stammered.

“What was—Gwen, I don’t really have a choice here,” Rowena whispered.

“You think tearing apart Lapanterian and Erisdalian relations will resolve this?” Gwen asked.

Rowena was about to retort when Jess grabbed Gwen’s arm. “Both of you, in the carriage!” The trio bundled. Nary had the door closed when Jess turned to Gwen.

“Gwen, do you not realize what Lapanteria has done to us? What they have implicitly threatened to do?”

The Alavaria opened her mouth, closed it and winced. “Okay, it’s bad. It’s really bad, but Wena, you just pissed them off more. How’s that going to help things?”

Rowena closed her eyes, burying her face in her hands. “I’m not sure.”

The quiet gasps in the carriage lanced into her heart. Rowena peeked through her fingers, seeing how her friends were staring at her, eyes wide. 

“Wena, you had to have a reason for doing that,” Gwen said, her earlier acerbic tone quashed like a punctured waterskin.

“I did, but the more I keep thinking about it, the more I am wondering if I said the right thing. Lapanteria—Alastor, I don’t think he understood how serious we take his marriage to Forlana as a threat. So, I decided to say anything and everything I could to make it clear to them that Erisdale would respond strongly. I didn’t want to threaten military action, but I wanted to make it clear our view of what they’ve done, while not saying anything I know my parents wouldn’t approve. That’s why I told him we won’t be honoring the extradition treaty. There are clear terms in there that indicate what occurs if one side breaks it. That’s why I told him what we would consider as a threat because I am almost certain my father and mother would agree with me on that.”

The princess pressed her shaking hands together. Her thoughts whirling like a storm, flinging out flecks of ideas and concepts that she tried to latch onto but also let go. 

“I need to prevent a war. I need to make it clear that Lapanteria’s threatening it with their bid to possess a claim on Erisdale. I cannot let their challenge go unanswered, but…”

Rowena looked up at Gwen, unable to hide the cold terror that squeezed her entire core and choked her, like Sylva’s spell so long ago. “Gwen, you’re right. I *did* escalate the situation! Lapanteria is no longer a cordial neighbours and I don’t know how what to do next! I came here to attend a wedding! Not to negotiate an entire kingdom out of a potential conflict!”

Jess’ mouth was doing a fantastic imitation of a goldfish. As the carriage trundled on however, she shook her head as if shaking herself awake. “You looked so composed.”

The princess sighed. “What was I supposed to do? Crumble and ask for mercy?” she asked.

“Probably not,” Gwen said, massaging the bridge of her nose with her fingers, she slid over to sit next to her friend and wrapped her arms around her arm. “Wena, I’m not mad at you, I’m mad at Forlana and Alastor. I just wanted to know why you did what you did. I can see now you were thinking quickly and just did what you could do.”

“Is that going to piss Queen Titania off?” Rowena asked.

“Perhaps, but don’t worry about her. You have enough to be concerned about. I’ll make sure she knows that Lapanteria blindsided everybody,” said Gwen.

Rowena nodded. “But am I right that she wouldn’t intervene in this? She won’t try to stop Lapanteria from going to war with us?”

Gwen closed her eyes for a moment and shook her head. “Teutobal and I think that we need ot use our military if it comes to it. However, most in Alavaria, including Queen Titania are strongly against Alavaria going to war for any reason unless it’s our territory at stake. We’re tired, Wena. We are stil in debt and trying to upgrade the infrastructure that we left to rot during those years.”

“Queen Titania would look to the side if Erisdale is annexed by Lapanteria?” Jess asked, voice rising.

“She wouldn’t like it. She would harbor you if you are requesting asylum. She’d certainly not stop Frances from fighting on Erisdale’s side, and if Lapanteria tries to annex Erlenberg, she’d go to war, but Erisdale isn’t Alavari territory. Erisdale killed thousands of Alavari in the Great War, and Earl Darius supported experiments on Alavari that lived in Erisdale.”

Jess shivered at that. Rowena reached out to squeeze her hand. “I’m so glad he’s not around,” Jess muttered.

“He—Oh, Earl Darius. Right, he was your biological father,” said Gwen.

Rowena nodded before suddenly frowning. “Hold on, Jess. Your mother, countess Janize, was Queen Janize before she abdicated. She abdicated specifically to my father and mother, and noone else.”

Her girlfriend nodded. “That’s correct, but before you think that means you’re in the clear, I’m going to have to disappoint you. For all intents and purposes, you’re a new dynasty. Even if my mother did abdicate to your parents, and coronate them, Forlana technically does have a claim.”

“How strong is it?” Rowena asked.

“It’s actually quite weak, but marrying Alastor has made it threatening. He has royal blood, she’s descended from royalty, so their child will end up having that blood combine,” said Jess.

“Blood is that important?” Rowena asked.

Gwen met Rowena’s eye. “Blood is why rediscovering you was such an important victory for your parents, Wena. You are their firstborn child. If you’d had any children, they would have would have a greater claim than your brother’s.” The Alavari’s gaze switched, moving from Jess to Rowena, and back again. “This is why we may have an advantage. You two should not hide that you’re courting.”

“Excuse me?” Jess squawked.

“Jess, think about it. You’re a Princess of Erisdale, daughter of House Grey and the youngest legitimate member. Just showing that you’re courting Wena would send Forlana into a panic,” said Gwen.

Rowena coughed into her fist and shook her head. “Gwen, I appreciate you’re trying to help, but I’m not using Jess to shore up my legitimacy.”

The Alavari blinked and winced. “Sorry, that was going too far.”

“It’s alright, we’re… we’re scrambling,” said Rowena, smiling at her friend. She turned her attention back to Jess, who was frowning. When she noticed Rowena, she smiled back.

“Thanks, Wena. And… no offense taken Gwen. It’s not a bad idea,” she said.

Rowena nodded. “I’ll call my parents when we get back. Hopefully they have some more.”



\*\*\*

Alone in her room, the guards outside and Jess cleaning up, Rowena pulled open her hand mirror and thought of the mirror in her parent’s room.

After a few minutes of focus, a foggy image swam into view, coalescing until she could see her father’s tired visage. He was wearing a nightshirt, his hair a mess and she winced as she realized how late it was in Erisdale.

“Dad? I’m sorry, but I needed to talk to you now.”

Martin blinked and rubbed his eyes with his hands. “Rowena? What are you—Huh, okay it must be urgent if you’re calling us at this hour.”

“I’m afraid so.” Rowena pursed her lips, having rehearsed in her mind what she would say to her parents. Yet, she still coudln’t quite believe what she was planning to say. Still, no point keeping her exhausted father waiting.

“Dad, I’m recommending the army should go to Level Three Mobilization.”

Martin’s eyes snapped open. As he smoothed his hair back with his hands, his exhaustion briefly vanished, replaced by a look of calculated urgency. “Level Three—that’s ordering every brigade to their assigned mobilization areas and having them prepare for mobilization or battle. What in Amura and Rathon’s name is going on?”

Rowena took a breath and braced herself. “Veina, Prince Alastor’s bride-to-be, is Forlana Grey.”

The King of Erisdale stared at the mirror, eyes wide, one hand holding onto his chin. “Excuse me?” he asked, voice coming out a combination of a hiss and gasp.

“She’s been hiding in plain sight. During the wedding, they revealed her lineage and who she really was,” said Rowena.

“What in the shit parade was she doing in Lapanteria?”

“Securing an alliance, dad. Prince Regent Alastor marries a claimant to the Kingdom of Erisdale. She gets legitimacy through marrying a true royal. He gets—”

“A claim on Erisdale.”

“Precisely. I’ve tried to make it clear to him this is a bad idea by telling him the extradition treaty is broken, that we see this as an attempt to annex our kingdom, and that we will take whatever action is necessary to protect ourselves. I’m not sure what else to do aside from try to talk to him and demand she renounce her claim. Can you try to reach King Sebastian? You fought alongside him.”

“I’ll try but as you know, Alastor’s been serving as regent for years.”

“I know, I’m sorry. I’m just desperate for anything at this point,” said Rowena.

Martin blinked. He studied Rowena for a moment without saying anything, making her freeze. “Father?”

“Rowena, I know this is an insane responsibility and situation and you’re doing your best to try to negotiate with Alastor. Please keep doing that. You’re right that ideally, we want Forlana to renounce her claim, but if she doesn’t, make it clear we will maintain our sovereignty with military force if necessary. To that end, do whatever you need to do, say whatever you think is right. You have my full support and permission to order anybody or requisition anything.”

Rowena almost dropped the mirror as her fingers shook. She grabbed onto her wrist to steady herself. “Father, I… are you sure?”

Martin smiled. “Rowena, your mother and I believe in you. We know you care for our kingdom and our subjects. We know you want to prevent war no matter what. So believe in yourself.”

“I…thank you, dad,” she stammered.

“And if you think you can’t stay there any longer, get the hell out of there,” said Martin.

“Yes, father.” Rowena pursed her lips. “Can you let Frances know I need to talk to her to get the White Order and the Lightning Battalion involved? In the morning? At the 9th hour?”

“Of course. Do you think I should mobilize further troops past Level 3?” Martin asked.

“So long as we don’t start actively calling in reservists for the active brigades. If you want to start reactivating some of our reserve brigades, such as our artillery brigades, I think that would be appropriate. My hope is that Alastor will see us mobilizing and see that as signalling how willing we are to fight,” said Rowena

“It’s a good idea. Where did you get it from?” Martin asked.

“You actually. You mentioned that sometimes, standing one’s ground can catch someone off guard. From his reaction last night, I don’t think Alastor expects us to resist so strongly. We can’t declare war, but preparing to mobilize might surprise him and at the very least, buy us some time,” said Rowena.

Her father nodded with understanding, before suddenly grinning and shaking his head. “See, you’re already making me proud.” He looked over her shoulder at probably her mother. “I have to go. Got some urgent orders to draft. Take care, my dear.”

Rowena nodded, feeling her heart lighten just a little from her father’s confidence in her. “I will. Thank you dad.”



\*\*\*

Forlana’s eyes fluttered open and she grimaced at the arm around her waist. As gently as she could she lifted her new husband’s arm, wriggled to the edge of the bed and swapped it with her pillow.

Alastor held onto the pillow, muttering to himself as he dreamt. Shaking her head, Forlana grabbed the anti-abrasion sock to pull over her leg’s stump, before strapping on her wooden prosthetic foot. 

She was soon exiting Alastor’s chambers, with him being none the wiser, shawl wrapped over a simple green gown. After cleaning up in her private bathroom, she strode out from her bedroom, ready to face the day.

The Lapanterian Royal apartments were split between the King and Queen’s chambers. They had their own bathrooms, bedrooms and even servant wings, but they did share a private dining room which Forlana now sat down in. Servants drew the curtains open to let in fresh sunlight whilst a butler came to take her order.

Being royalty did have its perks, and Forlana smiled beautifically as Jaimes poured her a glass of water. “I’m feeling a little tired from last night. Tea and something hearty for breakfast, please? No seafood. Some fresh fruit, please.”

“Certainly, Your Highness.”

“Thank you, Jaimes. Can you also summon Annie if she’s up? I would like to be briefed.”

“Certainly, though, if I may be so bold, wouldn’t it be better for chief minister Duanoth to do so?” Jaimes asked.

Forlana regarded the butler, her lips pursed. He man was experienced, his years reflected in his salt and pepper hair. Forlana liked Jaimes. He was professional, fast and attended to her every need. However, he was also her husband’s man, not hers.

“Thank you, Jaimes, but I wouldn’t want to disturb the good minister so early in the morning,” Forlana said.

“Of course,” said Jaimes, he bowed before leaving.

Forlana sipped her water as the servants brought out hot tea. This was soon followed by a very Lapanterian-style breakfast Namely, beans baked in tomato sauce, thick-cut bacon and a kind of vegetable casserole made from shredded preserved cabbage and carrots. Sweet pastries were set to the side for her to finish after her main course.

It was perhaps slightly disappointing that she wasn’t getting something more Erisdalian in style. She’d kill for a roasted dale-brick, or maybe even the poutine that had become more popular of late.

Even so, it was delicious and she’d soon cleared her plate and was picking out a pastry. A shortbread with cream and a peach on top was her first choice as Annie walked in.

Her longtime maidservant, now in a court lady’s fine dress curtsied, smiling. “Your Highness, congratulations. Your wedding is the talk of the Sunflower Court.”

“They’re happy with it I hope?” Forlana asked. Annie was smiling, but her hands were clasped very carefully over her blue dress.

“Quite a few are a bit relieved. Knowing that their prince is marrying someone of noble blood has made them less apprehensive,” said Annie.

“Even if I am descended from an illegitimate child?” Forlana asked.

Annie shook her head. “The warhawks and Alastor’s supporters are glad that they have another bargaining chip against Erisdale.” The blonde woman pursed her lips. “However, there are some who are concerned, not about your marriage precisely, but at Erisdale’s response.”

Forlana rolled her eyes and took a bite from her pastry. “Princess Forowena’s tantrum was perhaps inevitable. I do think it was unfortunate and somewhat unexpected, but everybody knew that there would be some diplomatic consequences. So long as our long term goals remain on track, it shouldn’t be an issue.”

Her maidservant blinked. “Your Highness, if I may, why do you see Princess Forowena’s response as a tantrum?”

Forlana paused before turning to Annie, eyes narrowed. Her maidservant looked strangely worried. “Princess Forowena can’t change anything. My claim to the throne of Erisdale is stronger than it has ever been and now I have the force to back it up when I wish to press it. They can rant or rave all they want, but what can they threaten Lapanteria with?”

Annie swallowed. “That’s the thing, Your Highness, Erisdale is making moves.”

“What kind of moves?” a booming voice echoed as Alastor strode in, wearing but trousers, bedshirt and bathrobes wrapped around himself.

Forlana rose and bowed to him. “Good morning, husband.”

“Good morning, wife! Just give me some pastries, Jaimes, and coffee,” said Alastor. He kissed Forlana’s cheek as he passed and she did his, though more gently. The prince smirked and sauntered over to the chair across from Forlana and sprawled out across it. “What’s this about Erisdale making moves and why aren’t you getting a report from Chief Minister Duanoth?”

“I figured I’d rather not wake him, dear husband. Besides, Annie can be trusted. She’s served me for a very long time.”

The prince looked over Annie, his dark brown eyes searching, wandering over every inch of clothing and skin. “Pretty little thing are you?”

“Alastor, you do recall our agreement, do you?” Forlana asked in a sing-song voice, her back perfectly straight and her gaze levelled at Alastor.

“Oh, of course. That is, unless you are interested in some fun time, Annie?” Alastor asked.

Annie swallowed and tilted her chin up. “I apologize, Your Highness, but I prefer the company of women.”

“Oh, how unnatural, but you are Erisdalian after all I suppose,” said Alastor. He blew on his cup of coffee, dumped a small pitcher of milk into it, followed by ten sugar cubes, before taking a long draught. “So, what did your lady-in-waiting have to say before I made my entrance. Don’t stop on my account.”

“Erisdale delivered a statement to our embassy this morning indicating their displeasure with the wedding and for failing to arrest Lady Forowena as per the extradition treaty. They also advised us they see this marriage as a threat to the kingdom and will do whatever they need to do to protect their territory and citizens. King Martin and Ginger also advised us that the kingdom has moved to Level Three mobilization.”

Forlana flinched, failing to suppress her emotions as she crushed the custard fruit tart that she was taking a bite out of.

“Level Three mobilization? Are they serious? They—Oh damn, she wasn’t just saying that for effect,” Forlana stammered.

Alastor, smile gone, arched an eyebrow. “Hold on, Level Three mobilization?” he asked.

Forlana hid her surprise by cleaning up her hands and studiously not looking at her husband. That he didn’t know Erisdale’s mobilization system astounded her. Instead, she glanced at Annie and made a near-imperceptible nod.

Her lady-in-waiting took a breath. “King Martin and Queen Ginger’s Erisdale restructured their military after the Great War. It now has fifteen combat “brigades” between one-thousand to two-thousand strong, interspersed throughout the kingdom. These are made up of permanent, full-time soldiers.”

“So like our Royal Regiments,” said Alastor. “How is this unusual?” the prince asked.

Forlana swallowed tart into her mouth. “The composition of Erisdale’s brigades are different. Lapanteria’s Royal Regiments are part of a single army, the Grand Legion of Lapanteria and generally are concentrated in our core provinces. Erisdale’s brigades are dispersed throughout the kingdom, with every one of them equipped with horses that can carry the entire brigade, assigned mages, horse-drawn artillery, and logistics personnel, means that they can operate independently.”

Alastor drummed his fingers on the table. “Huh, they’re all modelled on the Lightning Battalion’s original mobility tactics.”

Forlana nodded, glad her husband was following and yet, still baffled as to why he didn’t know this in the first place. She glanced at Annie, who said, “The brigades can concentrate at a point to form an army, or they can mobilize according to four different mobilization levels.”

“Mobilization levels? This is quite complicated isn’t it?” Alastor muttered.

Annie swallowed. “If Erisdale fully mobilizes, that is, mobiliation Level One, the brigades absorb reservists at their staging areas and begin conducting bombat operations. They quadruple in size as musketeers and light infantry combine. What was a small brigade becomes a very large brigade with all supporting components.”

Alastor had been half paying attention as he ate his breakfast, but as he listened, he suddenly looked up. “Isn’t that 60,000 troops?”

Forlana nodded. “And that’s their immediate reserves tied to the brigades. Erisdale has equipment and reservists to reactivate a number of brigades. Fifteen more to make their army—”

“You’re telling me Erisdale can mobilize 120,000 soldiers?”

“With contingencies for a long war,” said Annie.

The prince glanced between the two women. “You must have your numbers wrong. They couldn’t mobilize more than two armies of less than twenty-thousand during the war.”

Forlana let out a sigh. “It’s been sixteen years since the war and back then, the nobles divided up the forces amidst their own levies, many of which were held back. Martin and Ginger have done away with that. The army is under centralized command, like ours, but to an even more extreme state. It’s why we never attempted to raise a rebel army to take the throne. To do so would wipe us out.”

Alastor wiped his lips and threw his handkerchief on the floor, his eyes blazing with fury. “How the hell did they justify it? Even monarchs have certain limits to their power. Their nobles would riot.”

Forlana froze, her stomach suddenly churning as she realized something deeply uncomfortable. 

“I don’t know,” she said, her eyes briefly downcast. Taking a breath, she met Alastor’s eyes. “In any case, Level Three Mobilization means that their brigades have moved to set staging areas, prepared to either receive an attack from Erisdale’s enemies or to absorb reservists. Equipment is to be checked, reservist lists to be updated and confirmed and all leave is cancelled. It’s the preparatory step to Level Two, all active brigades absorb their assigned reservists and consolidate, followed by Level One, all brigades to be reactivated and begin conducting combat operations. This is a signal to us. They will fight and are prepared to do so.”

Alastor braced himself against the table, brow furrowed. “Which means it’s now our move.”

Forlana forced herself to take a sip of tea, but the hot liquid brought her no relief. “Precisely, husband.”

I just went on my first vacation using hyatt points and free nights. I had 5 free nights from last year and finally got the chance to use it. I just went to LA with my family and we stayed at the hotel fig, hyatt place anaheim, and hyatt regency irvine and I have got to say the credit cards points game and the status with the hyatt card is real. It's really about the little things that made the experience, I went with my family and getting free hotel nights is a trip the vacation would have cost alot more without it. 

The hotels 

Hotel Fig was kinda... I liked the spanish colonial vibe but I feel like you'd have know what you want out of the hotel in order to really maximize enjoying it. Valet parking was like 70 bucks or 40 bucks at the parking lot next to it.... and it's not in the best area. Coffee at the bar was cool 

Hyatt place anaheim was in the middle of a lot of happening things but really just seems like a disneyland hotel more than anything. The room was VERY large and to me personally, I enjoyed it more than I did hotel fig. The breakfast was standard and well done, can't complain free good decent food. 

Hyatt regency irvine to me personally was the best one. I really enjoyed the rooms the interior was beautiful and well decorated the 2 water bottles they gave us were the metal ones it was sick, it gave the vibe of a big hotel and I read online that it was renovated recently and I could tell they really did the place up well. 

The bad

Probably just my first experience with it but we drove our car down and had to pay for parking everyday..... sucked lol

Overall I really enjoyed trying out different hotels and experiencing a bit of luxury living. The free aspect using points is actually massive. I'm really looking forward to trying out more brands and different countries hyatt hotels.",1,1763532607.0,hyatt,0,1.0,False
1p0zvbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1p0zvbu/my_abuse_story/,My abuse story,"TW: Animal cruelty, pregnancy, termination









Honestly, not sure why im posting this. I guess I just want people to hear my story, maybe for validation, maybe both. For context, I am a 22 year old female. My ex is 10 years older than me, so when we got together, I was 20 turning 21, he was 31. I was with him for a little over a year, and that year was pure hell. Things went to shit almost immediately, but I stayed. Maybe I had given him the benefit of the doubt at first. And, maybe that grace had slowly, but undeniably, turned into a fear of harm if I left. It didn't occur to me I was afraid of him until the first time he had ""jokingly"" threatened my life. At the end of the day, I'm alive. I most definitely need therapy, and have a severe negative bias towards men (which I am trying to challenge each and everyday), but I'm alive. It could've gone a lot worse. Im not good with timelines, things feel hazy from back then, maybe because I was in a constant state of dread. I'll format this into paragraphs in chronological order, to the best of my ability. 


We met on tinder. I know, horrible place to meet people. I was desperate, as I had never had a long term relationship. After having an exhausting push and pull situationship with a coworker of mine, (and finally deciding to cut him off) I decided I was done with the games and wanted something concrete. I had tinder premium, so I could see who liked me. I'll admit, he definitely didn't really stand out to me at first, but, I matched with him irregardless. His first message was very, odd. Very odd. Something along the lines of. ""Cute freckles! Are you a ginger hybrid?"" It...confused the hell out of me, and I should've unmatched him there, but I didn't. I responded back, saying my grandma had red hair, and he responded back with something equally as strange as the first. He then invited me to his house to meet his ""bathroom chickens"". I love baby chicks as much as the next guy, but going to his house on the first date? Nope. 

The date, I remember, was thrilling. He was funny, charming, and a lot better looking in person. We had a lot of things in common and a similar sense of humor. (It didn't occur to me at the time that maybe he was just telling me what I wanted to hear.) Im not proud to admit this, but I ended up going home with him, against my better judgement. Im pretty firm on my values, no sex outside of a relationship, but I had been celibate for 2 years at that point, and I folded. I ended up having a pregnancy scare by the end of that week, which was absolutely terrifying. I broke the news to him, and instead of thinking about it rationally, he immediately insisted we keep it. He said he didn't believe in abortion, and that was really my first real inkling that this wasn't going to work out. I am strictly pro choice, and I knew that if I was pregnant, that there was no way in hell id be keeping it, potential relationship be damned. Plus, he didn't even ASK me what my thoughts were. I tried telling him that I wouldn't want to keep it, but he cut me off, saying that ""we'd cross that bridge when we got there.""  It ended up being a false alarm, but I stuck around anyway, despite our opposing views. I didn't find out until later, but he had gotten 3 other women pregnant. All but one, it sounds like they terminated. He had a son, about 4 years old. I had a couple more warning signs before our next big incident, such as him rushing us to make it official, and got irritated when I wasn't immediately jumping at the idea, among other just very off, very insensitive remarks or comments.

Our next incident was about a week before my birthday. Saw that he had made a 2nd profile on snapchat, with a very suggestive name, and it had a story attached to it. It was a snap of him butt naked flexing in the mirror. I was very hurt, and when I saw him next, I questioned him about it. He said he saw that I had viewed it and called the whole situation ""awkward"". Awkward doesn't begin to describe getting betrayed by someone who was rushing to commit. Apparently, he had an exhibition fetish, which he was just now telling me about, after we had made it official. Im not going to lie, personally, this was a huge ick for me. He sent me a video of him deleting the 2nd account, and that was that, until it wasn't. 

I was cleaning his bathroom a couple days after (I know, already doing wife duties, but one of my love languages is acts of service) and I found a 2nd phone under his laundry. (He had 3, planning on getting a 4th before we broke up). As soon as I picked it up, there was a missed video call from a russian woman on an app called Joi. I looked up the app and it was what you expected. A adult videochat app. I said nothing until we went to bed. He left that specific phone charging in his room, where I was sleeping, unlocked. He could tell I was acting off, I don't know if it was a test, but I folded, and looked through it. Several apps, dozens of women. I cried myself to sleep, alone, as he went to go sleep with his son in his room. 

He asked me what was wrong in the morning, and I told him upfront. First the snapchat alt, and now this? He apologised, but I told him I had to go to work, and I'd think about what I wanted to do. All he said in reply was a meek ""I said I was sorry."" Either later that day or the next day's evening, I made it very clear just how badly he hurt me and what my expectations were. He sent me a suprisingly self-aware paragraph, and I was honestly touched. He promised he'd get counseling for his fetish and delete the apps. Stupidly, I believed him at the time. I never did check his phone after that, mostly because I didn't want to know what was on it. 

On my birthday, we had fun. It was hot as hell, but I didn't mind it. He did have a small job that needed to be done for his exterior service business, but I helped him finish it up, and we hit the town. Everything went great, until the end of the night. We were sitting in a bench overlooking the water, his head in my lap. It was peaceful, like a scene out of a cheesy romcom. Suddenly, he looks up at me, smiles, and says. ""If you and (sons name) were both dangling off of a cliff, I'd save (sons name.)"" I cried. Not because I thought that would've been the wrong choice, but the fact that it just came out of nowhere and was incredibly hurtful. One thing about me is, I absolutely hate hypotheticals. He loved them though. Would say the stupidest shit all the time, usually thinly vieled threats to dump me over something petty. He gave a half-assed apology, so that was that I guess. 

Oh, and a week after my birthday, he freaked out because I told him I was going to pick up a birthday present from one of my long time guy friend's house. I never even got to go. He blew up my phone for 3 whole days, accusing me of cheating, blowing things way out of porportion. I barely slept. He was angry texting me morning, noon, and night. I'd wake up to a bunch of angry texts or him spiraling. I tried gently standing up for myself, trying to reassure him, and eventually apologizing. He did nothing but double down, and made me feel worse. Eventually, on the 3rd day, I had enough. I was at work in near tears, and my work performance was down the drain. 

I told him to either stop right now, or we were done. He blocked me on fb and stopped. I assumed that meant we were done, and I had removed him on snapchat. I was devastated, hurt, angry, but only for an hour or two. I was actually starting to feel relieved more than anything. That I had finally gotten this hypocritical, jealous maniac out of my life. I was wrong. He blew up my phone through my number, begging me for a second chance. That he loved me, he's crazy about me, he needed me. Looking back on this, I really was a dumbass. I took him back. Things never did get better. Its getting late and my phone battery is tanking so im going to make this short. Over the course of our relationship, including what I have written above (in so specific order), he:

Threatened to kill me and my ""dream boyfriend"" if I ever left him for it. (I had a dream one night where I was arguing with a dream boyfriend and I was trying to leave him. Threatened to kill me a couple times actually.

Complained about a coworker incessantly for about an hour, admitted he yelled at him and called him a bitch in front of people. I don't remember what exactly what I said in reply, but he called his coworker the r word and refused to come to bed with me. I tried apologizing but it didn't work. 

Refused to take me to the hospital when I kept waking up with severe stomach pain 3 nights in a row because he ""didn't want to wake up (sons name)"". He made it very clear I wasn't a priority. He got mad and started rushing me when I took too long getting dressed because I was doubled over in pain. Ended up being terminal ileitis. He never visited me in the hospital. Never visited me when I had a uti that was turning into a kidney infection either. As soon as I was home, his son shoved me in the kidneys because I was ""in the way"", kid never got any sort of reprimand or scolding for it. I had taken him to the hospital when his back had a pinch in it. Wheeled him around the house for a day or two and helped him to the bathroom. Been there for every hospital visit him and his son had. Fed him and made sure he didn't have to lift a finger when he was sick too and bought him a shit ton of snacks, took his son to his mothers, and comforted him in bed while we watched tv. Never seemed to appreciate any of it. Pretty sure he never even said thank you. 

About 5 months in, rushed me to move in with him. Was honest and told him we needed to work on our communication before I did (turns out he was miscommunicating on purpose and it drove me mad because everything I said was twisted) and got pissed about it. That was our first breakup, I packed up my things and left shortly after he left for work in a huff. Left him a letter. He blew up my phone when he got home and claimed that he had felt bad so he had gotten me flowers (x to doubt)

When we were talking about getting together, he had told me he had gotten his son a pet, but wouldn't tell me what it was no matter how many times I asked. I was assuming it was a hamster or something low maintenance. It was a dog. Couldn't house break it for the life of us, and it made messes constantly. It used to steal my underwear specifically and chewed a bunch of holes in the crotches of them. Did this to at least 5 pairs. And 3 bras, one of which was a discontinued bra my mom had given to me, and another was a replacement of the other one he destroyed. Bra's aren't cheap. 

Refused to wear condoms, insisted on finishing inside, and complained about my nuvaring constantly, claiming it ""cut him"". Its a squishy ring, how? Akways told me how he wanted more kids for (sons name) to play with. Made me take out my nuvaring everytime we had sex. The dog somehow got ahold of one I had just inserted and chewed it to pieces. Had another one just straight up dissapear after sex. He had claimed the dog must've gotten it. I had put it on the coffee table, the dog couldn't reach it. When I started panicking, he acted nonchalant and barely helped me look for it.  

I got it in my stupid head that if i gave in and got pregnant, that he would start treating me better. I wasn't actively trying to get pregnant, but I became more careless with my birth control. He used to make me take pregnancy tests and would physically pull me by the hand to check the test with me. I wasn't allowed to take one without him. I ended up getting pregnant shortly after. I got very, very sick, and was bedridden for the first month, much to his irritation. 

I also started watching his son a lot more during then. I was too sick to work, so I obliged because I didn't want to seem useless, even though I really wasn't up for it. His son was incredibly energetic, and occasionally physically violent. He'd punch and bite and kick his father constantly. He never got help. Despite no matter how many times I told him no, either the dog or his son would sleep with us. The dog spent a lot of time outside and was known to go under the house in a little nook where a stray tom cat lived. Obviously toxoplasmosis was a concern, especially since I was pregnant. He treated my concerns as unfounded and annoying, and only stopped when I refused to sleep in the bed/when the dog kept pissing/pooping in the bed (something he insisted ""wouldn't happen"") 

His son would wiggle constantly in his sleep, and more often than not I would be halfway off of the bed when he slept with us and get no sleep. I had to beg and beg and even then, he was only kept out for a week or two. I always slept with my back towards his son, because he's nailed me pretty hard before in his sleep, and I wanted to protect my belly. I was woken up one day with him bringing thor's hammer down on my ass in the form of his balled up fist. He insisted he was asleep. It bruised slightly. 

Even when I wasnt pregnant but was working all of the time, he would insist I watch his son. Im just not much of a kid person, but as long as it made his life easier, I tolerated it for a while. He said his babysitter (whom I've met before, she had been watching his son for years) suddenly didn't want to watch him anymore, so that responsibility was solely on me. It left me with almost no free time though, and I kept asking him to get a babysitter, or maybe a daycare. He said he was working on it but nothing ever happenned. That was hardly the worst part though. It was the call he'd have with his son right before he came home that always stressed me out. He'd call, and I HAD to give the phone to his son, so his son could tell him how I did in babysitting him. His son (only 4) could say whatever he wanted and my ex would take it as fact and I would be scolded or punished when he got home. I got in trouble almost every single time I watched his son, usually something petty. I was so souless at that time, that I just gave up and shriveled into a ball everytime I got berated. It was very clear I was at the bottom of the pecking order and wasn't allowed to do anything. I got in trouble for trying to take a quick bath once while his son watched tv. I couldn't let his son watch tv in the morning- no wait, actually I could, when it suited him. Got in trouble if I did either though. 

While I was pregnant, the mornings were absolute hell for me. Ex still insisted I get up early to take his son to school though, while trying not to vomit in the car, because he got shift premium working mornings. Told him multiple times I couldn't, but by that time I was living with him and spent my tax return on food/things for him and his son. I had no money, and was isolating myself from my family. My relationship with my two best friends (guys) were mostly nonexistant at this point because my ex didn't want me hanging out with them one on one (which meant never), because, ""he went to dinner with an army friend that one time and it felt like too much of a date"".

 Actually asked me if I had phone sex with my online best friend. Found out a month later he had a best friend on snapchat which he had been friends with since he was 15. I asked him about it, and he showed me their image history, which was a singular picture of her dog. (You've been friends with her for 16 years, and you've only sent 1 picture to eachother?) Was very cagey about it. Just seemed very hippocritical. Got mad at me because my online friend was having a really bad day because one of his other friends was telling him she was going to kill herself. He was in hysterics and I spent 30 minutes trying to comfort him and talk him through it. I got bitched at later because of it. 

Told me for Christmas, he was going to get up early and make breakfast. I assumed that meant he was going to wake me up (i thought wrong) because I woke up at 2 pm with both him and his son gone. They went sledding without me despite him telling me we'd all go as a family. He ignored my calls but when he picked up he yelled at me for sleeping in so late. (I was pregnant and exhausted, he had a really bad habit of keeping me up and not letting me sleep). We were suppoased to go to my dad's to celebrate, but because it was super snowy (my car isnt built for snow, we were going to take his van) I had to sit at home and explain to my dad through tears, (who was very upset saying they made a bunch of food and spent a lot of time preparing for) that we weren't coming

Would complain about me sleeping past 10 constantly, and wouldn't just let it be. Sometime's he'd leave his son in my care, not tell me, and call me the morning of asking how he's been, then get pissed when I admitted I was asleep. Oh, but, you know, I couldn't go to bed peacefully because he would pester me for intimacy or say he was bored and wiggle or talk my ear off until I passed out. I wasn't in the mood very often because I felt horrible most of the time. He complained constantly about that too. 

I asked him to make steak for me once because I was craving it really bad after he got some from work. He told me no, and shamed me about it. Later, when I was in bed, he suprised me with steak. He ""Jokingly"" complained to me that I was asking too much of him until I started crying at the table. He didn't comfort me. Instead, he ate the steak in front of me with his bare hands, making heavy eye contact with me while I was sobbing. 

We went on a walk with his son and his babymama's parents one day while I was a couple months along. His son ran up the hill, turned around, and ran full speed at me and shoved me in the stomach with both hands. I threw up in my mouth and started sobbing. All 3 adults immediately started fussing over his son and defending him from me. The son, now startled, ran back down the path to the house and screamed like a banshee while we walked back. The entire walk my ex was defending him and telling me ""he was just a kid"". He held his son by the collar while he was shrieking to make him apologize. Then, we went to the park, (because shoving a pregnant woman in the stomach is stressful, and deserves a reward, not a timeout!)

He prioritized his buisiness over my health and wellbeing. He'd make me stain decks in the cold and use paint thinner while I was pregnant. He didn't pay me either until the last 2 times I helped. He often wouldn't let me eat if there was something else he felt was more important needed to be done and he was driving. We'd have to pull over so I could throw up. On mother's day, he left me in a hot car for 3 hours while he argued about payment with a client. I threw up, obviously. 

We surrendered the dog, not because I had asked. The dog was stressed out all of the time because my ex and his son didn't even like him and didn't want to be around him. I was resentful of the dog at the time, not only because of the mess and destruction, but because it had killed several of my young chickens and I woke up to one in pieces on the porch while I was struggling with morning sickness, I see now that it was just a scared animal that deserved a better home, especially one that won't throw him down the stairs for fun (courtesy of his son). I wasn't home for it, but apparently the dog had chewed up his sons brand new bike helmet, and he threw it off of the porch and it was now limping. I did my best for damage control and bathed and fed the dog and kept the poor thing warm while my ex made his son say goodbye to it because he didn't want to pay for a vet visit, so surrendering was the only option. I was fucking pissed. My ex gave me 2 days to both find a shelter willing to take him in, and deliver the dog, in 2 days, because he just didn't wanna do it himself. I drove 2 hours each way for a shelter that would take him in. I held that dog for the last time, and I apologised to him. That poor animal didn't deserve to end up in a home like this. I hope he got the help he needed, and is with a family that actually cares for him. I should've reported him for animal abuse, I really should have. I was so dependent and terrified of him though, I was afraid to. 2 weeks later he told me he was planning on getting a golden retriver and told me id be the one training and taking care of it.

These are just a fraction of the things he did to me while we were together, (he also neglected my bird and it starved, i had her for 2 years, and whenever we hugged he'd pretend to break my neck) all of these are 100% true. When I decided I had enough, he keyed my car put broken glass and trash in it, broke the windshield wiper, threw all of my clothes in the firepit, ripped up all of my photos of my late grandfather among other things, along with the pregnancy book my dad had gotten for us (something he promised to read to me everynight, but didnt), and smashed all of my flower pots I was tending to. I got a PPO, and a deputy was witness to everything he did. I probably wouldn't have made it out if it wasn't for my brother, his fiance, and mother who supported me and heavily enouraged me to leave.

I had to make the hardest decision of my life shortly after, in terminating my pregnancy. When I went in for a consultaion, I was told I had about a week to think it over until I was past the date they could perform the procedure. But, due to scheduling constraints, I had only 2 days. 2 days to make a decision. I had always wanted a daughter, I unfortunately didn't find out the gender until she was already gone. I spent those 2 days in agony, holding her and crying myself to sleep. I still feel tremendous pain, guilt, and longing over my baby girl. She would've been born Nov 4th, earlier this month. I love her very much, but I couldn't put her in that situation with a father who so clearly didn't care for her wellbieng. He would've made her life a living hell, if he didn't end up neglecting her first when I wasn't there. I didn't have the means to give her a life I wanted her to have either.

I don’t get stressed when I make a big financial decision… but let me overspend on some tiny, stupid thing, and it ruins my whole mood.

Like, if I invest in something risky and it dips?
I’m calm.
“This is long term.”

But if I buy groceries when I’m hungry and the bill jumps by 12 dollars?
I stare at the receipt like I’ve betrayed my entire family lineage.

It’s not even about the money.
It’s the feeling of “I should’ve known better.”

And I think that’s what adulthood really is, not the big dramatic disasters, but tiny choices that stack up.
A coffee you didn’t need.
A subscription you forgot to cancel.
A delivery you ordered because cooking felt exhausting.
Nothing life-ending… just these little dents that slowly shape how you think about yourself.

But then I remind myself:
Life isn’t a perfect spreadsheet.
Sometimes you mess up the small stuff.
Sometimes you waste money.
Sometimes you just need the overpriced sandwich to stay sane.

And honestly, that’s okay.

Around spring 2025, my husband and I joined a card game group in our area. He helps run it so he's been there every week he can, I go when I have the energy between 2 small children (both >5) and general housework. Taylor is also a weekly visitor to the group and at first she was pretty chill. She's always been awkward, so I feel like I overlooked some behaviors because I felt bad for her. 

I'm also gonna put this up here because I want it said at the front: I trust Andy implicitly. He and I have talked about this stuff, and he's assured me from his side that either nothing has happened or he missed signals. Not very surprising, he and I both didn't realize the other liked us for actual months while actively going on date-adjacent activities.

Right before summer, Taylor and her husband learned they were expecting and things have gotten...weird. Like I had a plan to go visit my family with my children for a long portion of the summer and she got really weird about how long I was going to be gone, texting often even though we didn't really talk much before, and so on. When I got back, things went back to normal. Then she started keeping Andy late talking strategies and the like and then sending these ""sorry, I had to borrow your husband"" texts after the fact. I read that as totally fine, if anyone starts talking to him about his favorite stuff he tends to linger and share what he knows. It's just the phrasing that threw me off.

The biggest thing happened when Taylor asked if I could drive her to a local coffee shop we both like. We were in the drive thru and she started talking about what we should do for the day. I explained that I had plans to join a friend's stream. She immediately asked if she could just come over and watch. I should have said no, but instead I just shrugged, said sure, and called Andy to let him know. When he picked up, she said ""Oh, it's our husband!"" Now to be clear, I shut that down then and there. I told Taylor in no uncertain terms that her calling Andy ""our"" husband was beyond not ok and she could not make that joke again. She apologized, and ended up coming over anyway because I'd already agreed to it and accepted her apology. 

It's been a few months since that, and this weekend she kind of acted up again? While at her baby shower, her friends were trying to convince Andy that he should join their biweekly D&D game (which isn't hard, Andy and I met because we're huge nerds). He respectfully kept telling them he'd have to make sure both our schedules could handle it. That's when Taylor said ""Oh come on, do it for your best friend!"" 

I'm not very proud of my response (Andy is), but I immediately looked up at my husband and said ""I don't know what I have to do with this, but you should go if you want to."" We ended up leaving not long after that due to the cold and I've been sitting with these feelings for a few days now. 

Like I said up top, Andy and I have talking about it all. He finds her claiming to be his best friend audacious as she is neither me or his closest friend from high school. The husband comment also weirded him out, but he was on the line when I chewed her out so he didn't have to say anything in the moment. 

The really big conflict I have is the fact that I know she's extremely socially awkward and all of these events prior to this weekend were written off as tasteless jokes. Now my brain has done a 180° turn and is saying she's a conniving homewrecker who wants to take my nerd. AIO?",1,1763532260.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

Hello everyone,
I’m looking to buy a vanilla dominant perfume or attar, something that’s either purely vanilla or has a strong rich vanilla presence for layering with Fragrance World Qahwa. My total budget for the combo is around 3–3.5k. 

I was dead set on getting khamrah qahwa because of the bottle, but after reading more reviews here, I learned that the coffee note tends to fade within 1–2 hours. Many posts/comments mentioned that it turns into a sickly sweet scent, resembles the og khamrah, which I’m not a fan of. Extremely sweet fragrances don’t work for me, and I’ve even had to give one away for that reason.

I recently saw a review here comparing fragrance world qahwa and double espresso with khamrah qahwa, and it seems like fw qahwa is more straightforward and coffee dominant and basically not sweet at all, which works for me. I’m also open to recommendations for a coffee forward perfume with a lingering rich vanilla note, as long as it isn’t overly sweet. But for now, my idea is to layer a vanilla scent with qahwa.

If you recommend an attar, please share a trusted seller’s contact as well. I also reached out to Talib, and he suggested naseem french vanilla. I’m not sure about the performance of alcohol free perfumes, and I couldn’t find many reviews of french vanilla here apart from the few yt reviews which seemed sponsored.

Daily Pre-Market Normalization Mechanism (could done weekly or monthly if daily is too often or hourly if the the price surge to >$100/share)
Before each trading session, the exchange runs a standardized normalization algorithm that calculates a split or reverse-split ratio for every listed security. The purpose is to ensure that the security’s adjusted opening price falls within a predetermined target band (e.g., $1–$5).
- This ratio can be any continuous value (not limited to 2:1, 3:1, etc.).
- Market capitalization and ownership percentage remain unchanged; only the unit price and number of share is modified.
- The adjustment is applied simultaneously across all securities.

2. Significantly Lowers Participation Barriers
By compressing nominal share prices into a very narrow, low-cost range, the market becomes more accessible to “average Joe” investors.

Scene: An indoor swimming pool with a children's pool next to it. Servalan is walking along a concourse between the two pools, two mutoid guards follow behind her. Her hair is damp, she has no makeup on and various scars can be seen on her left face and arm. She is wearing a one-piece black bathing costume and her towel is wrapped around her. She has just been swimming. She walks past a woman who has just got her child out of the children's pool. The woman the notices Servalan.

Woman: Servalan? Supreme Commander?

(Servalan turns to the woman in surprise. The woman is former senator Sireh, now Supreme Juror. Sireh is also in a one-piece bathing costume and is also wet. The mutoid guards stand back)

Servalan: Supreme Juror Sireh. What a chance encounter.

Sireh: (slightly agitated) It is. Please, can I talk to you for a moment? It won't take long. (Points to cafe) If you can please sit at the cafe - I'll buy you a drink.

Servalan: I am very busy.

Sireh: I know. But this is very important. (Sireh turns to husband) Ambrose? Can you...? (points to child) I have to... (points at Servalan)

Ambrose: (Sireh's husband): Sure. (takes child)

(Sireh grabs a towel and wraps it around her waist. She and Servalan walk together to the cafe)

Sireh: I know that in the cloak and dagger worlds of politics and espionage, this little encounter might seem a bit planned. But I can assure you it is not. I've been wanting to speak to you for a few days now about something urgent.

Servalan: I appreciate that, Senator, but my time is limited.

Sireh: I am certain that you will appreciate our coming conversation. (looks at Servalan's scars) Goodness, they really did a number on you with that bomb didn't they?

Servalan: I try to keep it hidden, most of the time. Cosmetics, of course.

(they sit down)

Sireh: (peering at Servalan's head) And do I see some white hair growing out of your scar on your head?

Servalan: Yes. I have to keep dying it.

Sireh: Oh don't do that, I think the shock of white hair will make you more distinctive.

Waitress: Hello. May I take your order?

Sireh: Flat white coffee in a mug with a teaspoon of honey and fresh cream. Servalan?

Servalan: I think I shall just have some water.

Sireh (smiles): Oh come now. If I wanted to poison you I'd have done it already.

Servalan: (pauses) Oh alright. I'll have the same drink as the Senator... and some water too.

Waitress: You got it (walks away)

Servalan: So. What is so important that you had to speak to me?

Sireh: (prepares herself). Servalan. You... probably know this already. But you're not well liked in Cabinet at the moment.

Servalan: I take it you've been meeting illegally, without informing me?

Sireh: (pauses, then smiles) Ah... arrest cabinet. So that's your plan! Of course I'm not going to admit anything, but your response does indicate some elements of your planned coup.

Servalan (smiles) I have no idea what you're talking about.

Sireh: Well since neither of us know what we're talking about, let me just say a bunch of things and see if any of it makes sense.

Servalan: Go on.

Sireh: We know you're planning something, Servalan. The cabinet has been keeping a close eye on your dealings in recent weeks. I think you're preparing a coup. But others in the cabinet think that you're too young and inexperienced for such things.

Servalan: Really?

Sireh: Of course I'm even younger and more inexperienced than you, so I don't know what they're really getting at. Anyway... just after the senate failed to remove you, and before I became SJ, I started up a little Senate investigation team to begin surveillance on you and to dig into your personal finances and all that stuff.

Servalan: (looks less happy). Interesting. Did you find anything?

Sireh: Yes we did. And I'm rather confused.

Servalan: Oh?

Sireh: I have to admit that some of the investigative team are forensic accountants. They've come up with an 80% certainty that you are somehow involved in the bribing of Senators, Cabinet members and various heads of department.

(Servalan remains silent)

Sireh: 80% is enough to ring warning bells, but not enough to charge you with anything. Other investigative efforts have also isolated other payments. And this compounds the probability considerably, which means that there's a 99.99% chance of your involvement. BUT (raises forefinger) apparently the algorithm used to determine the compounded probability cannot be presented as evidence in a court case. In short, we know what you're doing but we can't do anything about it.

Servalan: Well this is all VERY interesting, (starts to get up) but...

Waitress: Here's your drinks (places coffee and water on the table, then leaves).

Sireh: Well you can't leave now.

(Servalan sits back down. She looks at her coffee and her water)

Sireh: (grins) Do you want me to drink out of all our cups? Proves they're not poisoned. I'll get a straw... (she begins to reach over to a table nearby)

Servalan: No. I guess you're right. You could have me killed me many times before. (drinks)

Sireh (also drinks): Of course if I do get to the point of assassinating someone, I'd rather do it without my family present. (points to pool)

(Sireh's husband and child are having fun in the water).

Servalan: (looking at Sireh's family) I never knew you'd be so hard. (looks back at Sireh) I always thought of you as naive and principled.

Sireh: Oh, I still am, believe me. Very naive and principled. It's just that I've worked out that at this level of power, the type of decisions change somewhat.

Servalan: In what way?

Sireh: Well, take you for instance. I would've once thought that all the evidence we've gathered on you should result in you going to court, having the evidence presented and then the judge would pronounce you guilty and you'd go to jail.

Servalan: And what is your opinion now?

Sireh: Removing you from your position as Supreme Commander would be a ghastly mistake. The survival of the Federation itself appears to depend upon it.

(Servalan gives Sireh a quizzical look)

Sireh: The forensic accountants I have been using have found where the money has gone to, but not where it comes from. Usually in cases like this, government corruption is due to outside interests funnelling money and other resources to their desired politician or public servant. They can't find this with you. Apart from your wage as SC, no one is paying you to do anything. It's the reverse - you're paying people to do things. And some money seems to be drawn out of thin air. My theory is that you've got a back door channel into the Federation Central Bank, but my forensic accountants assure me that this is impossible.

Servalan: Indeed.

Sireh: And the other thing is the big picture. All the major decisions you've been making, even the ones you're making outside of your jurisdiction such as shutting down Universal Navigation, they can only ever be logically attributed to protecting the Federation. In other words, we've proved beyond any reasonable doubt that, corruption aside, you have the interests of the Federation as your top priority.

Servalan: (slightly confused) And Cabinet? Have they come to this conclusion as well?

Sireh: (shakes head) Oh good lord, no. Some of them can't even understand basic logic. All they're worried about is you taking over.

(Servalan comes to a decision. She quickly downs the rest of her coffee)

Servalan: Supreme Juror. I do appreciate the time we have spent together now. But if you're expecting some sort of quid pro quo, where I divulge as much information as you have given, you are mistaken.

(she stands up. So does Sireh)

Sireh: Oh perish the thought, Supreme Commander. I always knew that I'd be the one talking here and you the one listening.

(they shake hands)

Sireh: Whatever happens, understand this. I am aware of much of what you are doing, and I support any efforts to protect the lives of all Federation citizens.

For five years, I lived a beautiful lie. I was Aliana Hughes, the cherished wife of the city's most feared Mafia Capo and the beloved daughter of the Don. I believed my arranged marriage had blossomed into love.



On my birthday, my husband promised me the amusement park. Instead, I found him there with his other family, celebrating the fifth birthday of the son I never knew he had.



I overheard their plan. My husband called me a ""naive fool,"" a placeholder to legitimize his secret son. The ultimate betrayal wasn't his affair, but the sight of my own father's car parked across the street. My family wasn't just aware; they were the architects of my ruin.



Back home, I found the proof: a secret photo album of my husband's other family posing with my parents, and records showing my father had bankrolled the entire deception. They had even drugged me on weekends so he could play happy family.



The grief didn't break me. It turned into something cold and sharp. I was a ghost in a life that was never mine, and a ghost has nothing to lose.



I copied every damning file onto a USB drive. As they celebrated their perfect day, I sent a courier with my parting gift: a recording of their treachery. While their world burned, I walked toward the airport, ready to erase myself and start over.

My husband, Ivan Hughes, the most feared Capo in the Donovan Outfit, promised to take me to the amusement park for my birthday. He lied. I found him there with his other family, celebrating the fifth birthday of the son I never knew he had.



It all started this morning, in the beautiful lie I called my life. I was convinced I was the cherished, long-lost heiress, finally secure in my place. I believed my arranged marriage was a path to love, that my husband adored me.



That morning, he'd kissed me before he left, a possessive, almost absentminded gesture. His thumb traced my jaw, his lips firm against mine. ""Happy birthday, mia cara.""



The words were a warm blanket over the cold space in our bed he'd leave behind.



Five years ago, my rival, Kiera Reese, had tried to ruin me. She sabotaged a multi-million dollar art acquisition I was managing for the Family, a move calculated to paint me as incompetent in front of my father, the Don. My parents told me she'd had a mental breakdown, that she'd been sent to a private facility. The matter was closed. I believed them.



Over coffee downtown, my best friend, Debi, wasn't so sure.



""I still can't believe they let her off so easily,"" she said, stirring her latte with more force than necessary. ""She tried to destroy your reputation.""



""She was sick, Debi,"" I said, defending a narrative I desperately needed to be true.



I pulled out my phone, my fingers flying across the screen in a hopeful, girlish message to Ivan. Can we still go to the amusement park? For my birthday?



His reply was swift. Dismissive.



Buried with Family business. Rain check.



A familiar ache settled in my chest, but this time, it was laced with something sharp: doubt. It was always ""Family business.""



Debi's eyes narrowed. ""On your birthday? No man is that busy, Aliana. A man that conveniently busy is hiding something."" She leaned forward, a silent dare in her expression. ""You should take him lunch.""



Her words landed on the fertile ground of my newfound fear. So I went.



Hughes Bio-Tech was one of our cleanest fronts, a gleaming tower of steel and glass. Ivan's secretary, a young woman who always looked terrified of him, paled when she saw me.



""Mrs. Hughes! I... I wasn't expecting you.""



""Is Ivan in?"" I asked, holding up a paper bag with his favorite sandwich.



She wrung her hands. ""He's not. He's... at the Reese Gallery. In the West End. Overseeing an installation.""



Reese Gallery. The name snagged in my throat. A cold dread, thick and suffocating, began to pool in my stomach.



I drove, my knuckles white on the steering wheel. As I pulled up to the gallery, I saw it. My father's black armored sedan, parked discreetly across the street.



They weren't just aware. They were involved.



Through the gallery's floor-to-ceiling window, I saw them. Ivan. Kiera. And a little boy with Ivan's dark hair and a smile that was a perfect, devastating copy of my own. Ivan was laughing, a relaxed, unguarded expression I hadn't seen on his face in years. He looked happy. He looked like a man in love.



The little boy, Leo, shouted with a glee that echoed in the silent cavern of my chest. ""Daddy, can we go to the amusement park now? For my birthday?""



Ivan's voice, laced with an affection he never used with me, drifted through the slightly ajar door. ""I booked the whole park, kiddo. Just for you.""



Leo's birthday. It was the same day as mine.



Kiera leaned in, her hand on Ivan's arm. ""Does she suspect anything?"" she murmured.



Ivan's laugh was a cruel, ugly sound. ""Aliana? She's a sweet, naive fool. Believes every word I say.""



He leaned down and gave Kiera a tender kiss. It was the exact same possessive, almost absentminded gesture he'd given me that morning.



He continued, his voice carrying with an arrogance that assumed no one of consequence could ever be listening. He'd claim he was sterile. They would ""adopt"" Leo. Make him the sole, legitimate heir to the Donovan-Hughes line. My purpose, my entire five-year marriage, was to be a placeholder. A legitimate face for his illegitimate family.



My phone buzzed in my hand. A text from Ivan.



Thinking of you. Miss you.



For a heartbeat, the world went silent. The grief wasn't an ache; it was a physical schism, a fault line cracking through the bedrock of my soul. It didn't break me. It didn't shatter. It crystallized into something hard, cold, and sharp enough to gut a man.



I put the car in drive.



Chapter 2

Aliana POV:



I feigned sleep when Ivan slid into bed late that night. The scent of Kiera's perfume, a cloying gardenia, clung to him like a second skin. It saturated the collar of his shirt, wreathed his hair, and stained his skin.



""Aliana?"" he whispered, his hand stroking my back. ""I'm sorry about today. The business with the port... it was unavoidable.""



He was lying. The ease with which the words rolled off his tongue soured in my stomach.



""I'll make it up to you,"" he murmured, his lips brushing my shoulder. ""We can go to the amusement park next week. I'll buy you that new Birkin you wanted.""



He thought he could patch the gaping wound in my life with a purse.



I remained perfectly still as he pulled me into his embrace, my body a rigid column of ice. Ice-cold fury coursed through my veins, a poison far more potent than his lies. I focused on the steady rhythm of his breathing, waiting.



Once it evened into the deep, untroubled sleep of a man with no conscience, I slipped out of bed.



His home office was my destination-the one room in our sprawling mansion he always kept locked. ""Sensitive documents,"" he'd said. ""Family business.""



I tried the obvious passwords. Our anniversary. His birthday. His mother's maiden name. Nothing.



Then, on a gut-wrenching impulse, my fingers typed in the date. My birthday.



Access Granted.



It was Leo's birthday, too. The door clicked open.



In a locked drawer, hidden beneath files for Hughes Bio-Tech, I found it. A leather-bound photo album. Not ours. Theirs.



I turned the pages, each one a fresh stab of betrayal. Ivan, Kiera, and Leo at the beach, the little boy perched on Ivan's shoulders. Them at Christmas, opening presents in front of a tree. And then, the one that stole the air from my lungs. A photo of all of them with my own parents, Richard and Eleanor Donovan, all of them beaming. My mother's arm was draped around Kiera. My father was looking at Leo with a pride he had never, not once, shown me.



I moved to his laptop. It opened without a password. He was that arrogant. That certain of my ignorance.



A private folder was labeled simply ""L.""



Inside were videos. Leo's first steps, Kiera's excited cry in the background. Leo's first word. ""Dada."" A scanned copy of his birth certificate. Father: Ivan Hughes. Mother: Kiera Reese.



I found a subfolder: ""FINANCES.""



It contained records of monthly transfers. Millions. From a Donovan holding company, one of my father's legitimate businesses, to a shell corporation. The memo on each one read: ""Reese Gallery Investment.""



My parents weren't just complicit. They were the architects. They had bankrolled the entire five-year deception. They had paid for the life that was stolen from me.



My hands trembled, feeling as if they belonged to someone else as I worked. I copied everything-every photo, every video, every damning bank statement-onto an encrypted USB drive I found in his desk.



I walked back to our bedroom, the evidence a cold, hard weight in my pocket. I picked up my phone and called the only person I could trust.



""Debi,"" I said, my voice a dead calm I didn't recognize as my own. ""I need you to find out everything you can about Kiera Reese for the last five years. Everything.""



And then, a final, cruel twist of the knife. My phone lit up with a text from an unknown number.



It was a photo. Kiera, Ivan, and Leo, a perfect family portrait taken today at the park. Ivan was looking at her with an adoration that twisted my insides.



The message below it was from her.



He says you're a convenient substitute. I think you're just convenient.



Nausea churned in my stomach, a final, weak protest of the woman I used to be. But the grief had already been cauterized by rage. All that was left was a resolute, world-destroying calm.



Chapter 3

Aliana POV:



I was no longer a wife. I was a ghost, haunting the edges of a life that was never truly mine. And ghosts have nothing to lose.



Debi's contact in the city's underbelly was expensive, but efficient. A well-placed bribe to the Reese Gallery's admin manager and a fabricated resume were all it took. My new title: Temporary Cleaner.



I stood in the staff locker room, pulling on a drab janitor's uniform. A cheap, scratchy wig covered my hair, and a disposable face mask hid the lower half of my face. I was invisible.



My assignment: Kiera's private office.



The office was a shrine to her triumph. The architecture had my mother's ostentatious taste written all over it; the curated art on the walls was my father's preference. This place wasn't just a gallery. It was a monument to their betrayal, built with my money and my future.



On her desk, nestled between stacks of art catalogs, was a small, silver frame. I picked it up. It was a ""wedding"" picture. Kiera in a simple white dress, Ivan in a dark suit, standing on a beach. A secret ceremony. Vows whispered over the wreckage of the ones he'd sworn to me.



I moved through the gallery, my cleaning cart a shield. In the employee breakroom, a young gallery assistant named Anna was gossiping freely with another girl.



""Mr. Hughes is here all the time,"" Anna said, oblivious to the ghost listening from the doorway. ""Practically runs the business side. And the Don himself-Mr. Donovan-visits often. Very quiet, very private.""



She leaned in conspiratorially. ""And Mrs. Donovan? She brings Hollywood producers by every week. I heard her tell one of them that Kiera is 'the vibrant, strong daughter she always wanted.'""



The words should have stung. Instead, they landed like data points, cold facts in a long list of grievances.



I heard the familiar purr of Ivan's car pulling up outside. I grabbed a mop and began cleaning the main hall, keeping my head down, my movements slow and methodical.



Kiera's voice, sharp and annoyed, cut through the quiet. ""I'm so tired of this, Ivan. Her ghost is becoming tiresome. When are you finally going to get rid of her for good?""



""I betrayed her the moment you told me you were pregnant, Kiera,"" Ivan's voice was low, rough. ""That was the choice. We just have to see it through.""



His gaze landed on me. The new cleaner. His eyes narrowed.



""You,"" he commanded, his voice laced with the authority he used on his soldiers. ""Turn around. Take off that mask.""



Ice flooded my veins. My heart didn't just hammer; it thrashed against my ribs, a frantic, trapped thing.



Just as I began to turn, the admin manager appeared at my side, a blur of forced cheerfulness.



""So sorry, Mr. Hughes!"" she said, her voice a little too bright. ""She's new. And she has a terrible flu. We shouldn't expose you or Ms. Reese.""



She grabbed my arm, her grip tight, and hustled me toward the back exit. ""My apologies. We'll get someone else for the main floor.""



I didn't stop until I was in my car, blocks away. I ripped the wig from my head, my breath coming in ragged gasps. It wasn't just adrenaline fueling the ragged gasps for air. It was the chilling, absolute certainty of my mission.



I had seen their world. Now I would burn it to the ground.



Chapter 4

Aliana POV:



The café was a dive, the kind of place with sticky tables and the lingering smell of stale coffee. In a secluded back booth, I slid the USB drive across the table to Debi.



""This is everything,"" I said.



She watched me, her impassive lawyer's mask firmly in place, as I laid out the entire five-year lie. The secret family. The gallery funded by my father. The plan to pass Leo off as our adopted son.



When I finished, her professional mask crumbled. Shock hardened into a righteous fury that mirrored my own.



""They will burn for this, Aliana,"" she swore, her voice low and vicious. ""We'll take them for everything they have.""



I shook my head. The movement was small, but absolute. ""I don't want their money, Debi. I don't want anything from them."" My voice was devoid of emotion, a flat line. ""I want a clean break. I want to erase them.""



Debi stared at me, understanding dawning in her eyes. She saw it then. This wasn't about revenge. It was about erasure. My own.



""I found something else,"" she said, her tone shifting. She slid a file across the table. ""Ivan has a standing monthly prescription. A powerful, fast-acting sedative, purchased through a shell pharmacy owned by a Donovan associate.""



The words hung in the air. The nights I'd felt unwell and slept for twelve hours straight. The weekends I was too fatigued to leave the house. The holidays I'd slept through.



It wasn't illness. It was a conspiracy.



I was being drugged. By my own husband. With the blessing of my own parents. So they could play happy family with Kiera and Leo.



Debi's face was grim. Her next words landed like stones. ""They were going to drug you on your birthday, Aliana. So he could take the boy to the park without any questions.""



And just like that, the final piece clicked into place. The tea. The special tea my mother always made me when I was 'stressed.'



A strange, cold smile touched my lips. ""Then let them.""



Debi's eyes widened.



""Let them play out their little scene one last time,"" I said. ""And then I'll be gone.""



An hour later, back in Debi's pristine office, the plan took its final, irrevocable shape. I signed the divorce papers. Then I signed the document Debi had drafted, renouncing the Donovan name and all claims to the family fortune, present and future. It was a legal suicide.



Under the name Hope Andersen, I booked a one-way flight to Portland, Oregon. For this evening. My birthday.



When I returned to the mansion, the gilded cage, Ivan was at his laptop in the study. He quickly minimized a screen when I walked in, but not before I saw it. The VIP services page for the Starlight Amusement Park.



A moment later, a text flashed on his phone, which he'd left face-up on the desk. A message from my mother.



Everything is set. Can't wait to celebrate Leo's big day!



That night, I lay in my bed alone, the space beside me a cold, empty void. I felt no grief. No anger. Only the vast, terrifying freedom that comes with absolute loneliness.



The girl who wanted a family was gone. In her place was a woman who was about to un-make one.



Chapter 5

Aliana POV:



On the morning of my thirtieth birthday, I packed a single small suitcase. A few changes of simple, untraceable clothes. A book. The new passport and identity Debi had procured. Hope Andersen.



I made my way downstairs. My parents, Richard and Eleanor, were at the breakfast table, their relief so palpable it was nauseating.



""Debi and I are going on a last-minute spa trip,"" I announced, the lie coating my tongue like ash. ""Just for the day. To celebrate.""



My mother's face lit up with a grotesque, false brightness. ""Oh, darling, what a wonderful idea! You deserve it.""



She bustled into the kitchen and returned with a steaming cup of tea in her favorite china. ""A special calming blend, darling. For your nerves. You've been so tense lately.""



I took the cup. It had the faint, tell-tale scent of bitter almonds mixed with chamomile. The sedative.



I knew it was drugged. I brought the cup to my lips and drank half of it, the warm liquid a final, poisonous gift from the woman who gave me life. Then I feigned a wave of dizziness, my hand fluttering to my forehead.



""Oh... I feel a little faint.""



They rushed to my side, their faces masks of concern. ""You poor thing,"" my mother cooed, helping me to a chair. ""You've been overdoing it. Go upstairs and rest, darling. The spa can wait.""



My father's arm circled my waist, guiding me up the stairs. I let my head rest against his shoulder, looking up at them through my lashes. ""Are you sorry?"" I asked, my voice small and weak, the voice of the girl they thought they knew. ""For all the years I lost?""



""Of course, we are, sweetheart,"" Richard said, his voice thick with false sincerity. ""But we have you now. That's all that matters.""



In the master bathroom, I locked the door, knelt before the toilet, and forced my fingers down my throat. I vomited until only bitter bile remained, my body convulsing with the effort of expelling their poison. I washed my face, staring at the stranger in the mirror. Her eyes were cold, her mouth set in a hard line.



I changed into simple, dark, anonymous clothes. Black jeans, a grey sweater.



From my closet, I retrieved a single, immaculately wrapped gift box.



Using an anonymous app on a burner phone, I booked a courier. The instructions were precise. Deliver the package to the VIP suite at the Starlight Restaurant, Starlight Amusement Park. At 12:00 PM sharp.



To: Mr. Ivan Hughes.



I drove to a scenic overlook a few miles from the park. Through a pair of powerful binoculars, I watched them. Ivan, Kiera, Leo, and my parents. They walked through the private entrance, a perfect, happy family. Leo rode on Ivan's shoulders, his laughter carrying on the faint breeze. Kiera held Ivan's hand, a picture of contentment. My parents walked beside them, doting on the boy.



A text from Debi came through on the burner phone.



Wheels up when you are. Be safe.



I lowered the binoculars, the image of that perfect family burned into my mind. Then I blocked every number in my old phone's contacts, wiped it clean of all data, and let it fall into a storm drain. It disappeared with a quiet splash.



I started walking toward the airport.



And I didn't look back.

I don’t know *what* portal we accidentally stepped through on November 1, but *Pick of the Day* has been *fighting for its life* ever since.

**Here’s where we’re at:**

* The Overs aren’t over-ing.
* The spreads aren’t spreading.
* The teams I pick apparently see my post and immediately decide to play their worst game of the decade.
* Norman Powell looked at 30.5 PRA and said “nah I’m good...”

**This might be the funniest (and most tragic) month POTD has ever had… and we’re only halfway through 😅**

Everything else has been smooth: Other picks are rolling, Player Props are cashing, parlays are parlay-ing — but *Pick of the Day*? POTD decided to take an extended leave of absence.

So here’s what we’re doing:  
**POTD gets a short, 48 hour break** to reset, breathe, and stop embarrassing me 🤣  
When it returns, it’s going to return with a vengeance 👊🏽

Thank you to everyone who can laugh through the variance with me — you make this community what it is 🥰

We rebound. We reset. And we move on.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Philadelphia 76ers vs. Toronto Raptors: A Statistical Free Throw, Served with a Side of Humor**

The Philadelphia 76ers (8-5) and Toronto Raptors (9-5) are set for a high-stakes clash in Philadelphia, where the 76ers will attempt to avoid becoming the latest victim in Toronto’s four-game winning streak. Let’s break this down with the precision of a NBA analyst and the wit of a late-night host who’s had one too many coffee shots.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Toes

The betting lines tell a story of near parity. DraftKings lists both teams at **+191** (decimal 1.91), implying a roughly **52.3% chance** for either squad to win. The spread? A razor-thin **1.5-point edge** to Toronto (-1.5) on some platforms, while others trim it to 1.0. The total is locked at **235.5 points**, suggesting a fast-paced, high-scoring affair.

Statistically, the 76ers’ offense (118.5 PPG) matches up well against Toronto’s defense (115.1 PPG allowed), but their **38.0% three-point shooting** (7th in the NBA) could exploit the Raptors’ 23rd-ranked three-point defense. Conversely, Toronto’s **29.9 assists per game** (led by Immanuel Quickley’s 6.1 APG) highlight a team that shares the ball like a family recipe for lasagna—no secrets, maximum efficiency.

---

### Injury Report: The 76ers’ Absentee Drama

Philadelphia’s injury report reads like a rejected script for a medical soap opera:

* **Joel Embiid** (knee): The MVP candidate is out, leaving the 76ers’ frontcourt as fragile as a plate of baked Alaska. Without Embiid’s rim protection and mid-range dominance, their offense loses a gravitational anchor.
* **Adem Bona** (ankle) and **Kelly Oubre Jr.** (knee): Both out, further thinning a defense that allows **119.0 PPG on the road**.

Toronto, meanwhile, is relatively health

I’m 24f . My bf 23m came home drunk and I just didn’t want anything to do with it. 
So I told him we can talk later I’m not interested in hearing it. I could’ve been nicer sure but I was just not having it.
He then proceeds to slam our bed multiple times on the ground and breaks the metal bottom of it. 
Then grabs my nightstand and flips it upside down. 
It was honestly a blur and can’t remember him picking up the nightstand but I assume that’s how it happened because it’s a heavy wooden nightstand. 
He then grabs his gun and starts walking out of our room, which I follow after him begging him to stop and he wouldn’t let go of it. He didn’t point it at any one of us just to be clear. I was afraid of his intentions though. 
His brother was still dropping him off at this point so he heard the yelling inside and had to knock our door down since my bf was pushing me back into the room and I was unable to overpower him and reach the door. 

This just happened about 2 hours ago and I’m still shaken so I’m sorry if this is jumbled and everywhere.

 I asked him to please sleep at his brothers for tonight and they left for the night. 
I want to also add that about a month ago he was also drunk and we argued. That time he kicked out coffee table pretty hard. It did spook me but I honestly didn’t feel the way I do now. It’s as if it’s getting worse because he sees I’m allowing it? 

I’m afraid of him right now. My dog even pooped himself from all the commotion. Luckily we have no kids. He didn’t hit me but he did push me and although I try to make the situation small, I know it isn’t. I was crying the moment he began slamming our bed and I have been crying on and off since. I’ve never felt fear with him but tonight I couldn’t even look at him. I was afraid to ask him to sleep elsewhere. 

I just need some nice words for the night. I feel so lost. My family lives 4 hours away. I’ve already confided in my cousin but now I come here for anymore insight or advice. Is this really abuse? Will it get worse? I hate to say I have a feeling it will get worse but I also want to give him the benefit of the doubt. Please help me understand. I’ve never gone through this before.

Last year we moved from Wroclaw, where we lived 8 years, to Warsaw due to my job. We also have a one year old baby, so our priorities in looking for appartment changed and we chose Ursynów. I like it enough, a lot of greenery, parks for kids, all the stores we need, nursery is couple of minutes walk… but I miss Wroclaw. I miss Rynek, Ostrow Tumski, all the cozy coffee shops and restaurants (Bulka z Maslem used to be a favorite), I miss the area around Opera, Swidnicka street, all the biking… 

My question is I guess, is there anything in Warsaw that resembles this cozy vibe of Wroclaw? I’ve been on rynek here, it’s very underwhelming, and compared to Wroclaw, I guess tourist attractions are more spread throughout the town?

i am a car enthusiast who regularly go to cars and coffee on weekends and own a RX7 and a RX8 with my dad. My dad and i (mostly me) have been thinking of buying a Kei truck to use as a daily and not use my Pajero as much as it's reaching 300,000km soon and want to retire the car for only long drives and trips/camping only. Anywho i am based in Australia in one of the big major cities but live in state forest. So here is my question to anyone. 1. what type of kei truck you own and what is your experience like owning and driving? 2. how much is it to maintain/insurance? Any aussie owners who can answer this for the insurance would be awesome 3. is it good to use for a daily car to drive? 4. on highways do you get blown away like a leaf to outter space? 5. what are parts like for modding and repairing? love to make it as my own little beast. and finally will i get all the girls.... being kei trucks are indeed cute. 



if there are any other things that i need to know when i own one of the many plz share and what is the best kei truck you recommend?

1p0z2xb,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1p0z2xb/how_to_change_your_iphones_ip_address/,How to Change Your iPhone's IP Address,"So I spent the last few months figuring this out after running into some weird network issues, and honestly, it's way simpler than the tech articles make it seem. Whether you're dealing with connectivity problems, privacy concerns, or just got IP-banned from somewhere (no judgment), here's what actually works.

# TL;DR

**Easiest methods first:**

1. **Airplane Mode trick** \- Toggle it on/off for cellular IP change (30 seconds)
2. **Renew DHCP Lease** \- Built into iOS for WiFi IP change (2 minutes)
3. **Router restart** \- Unplug for 5-10 min to get new public IP (10 minutes)
4. **Switch WiFi/Cellular** \- Instant different IP
5. **VPN** \- Masks your IP entirely (if you need ongoing privacy)

**Skip the methods that don't work:** Manual IP configuration (only for troubleshooting), Tor browser (too slow for regular use), proxies (security risk)

# First: Understanding What You're Actually Changing

Here's the thing nobody explains clearly - your iPhone has **two** types of IP addresses, and which one you need to change depends on why you're doing this:

**Private (Local) IP Address:**

* Looks like: 192.168.1.147 or 10.0.0.23
* Only used within your home/office WiFi network
* Other devices on your network can see it
* Websites/apps on the internet can't see it
* Change this when: You're troubleshooting network conflicts or router connection issues

**Public IP Address:**

* Looks like: [64.233.160.0](http://64.233.160.0) (random numbers)
* What the internet sees
* Assigned by your internet provider (ISP) or cellular carrier
* Websites use this to track your location
* Change this when: You want privacy, need to access geo-blocked content, or got IP-banned

Most people asking ""how do I change my IP"" actually mean their **public** IP. That's what websites see and what gets banned or tracked.



# Method 1: The Airplane Mode Trick (For Cellular Data)

**Time:** 30 seconds | **Difficulty:** Brain-dead easy | **Type:** Public IP

This is stupidly simple and actually works for getting a new cellular IP:

1. Open Settings
2. Toggle Airplane Mode **ON**
3. Wait 5-10 seconds
4. Toggle Airplane Mode **OFF**
5. Wait for cellular connection to reconnect

**Why it works:** When you reconnect to your carrier's network, they usually assign a new IP from their pool. Not guaranteed every time, but works about 70% of the time in my testing.

**When to use this:** Quick IP refresh, you got temporarily rate-limited somewhere, testing if an IP change fixes your issue

**Limitations:** Only changes your cellular IP, not WiFi. Some carriers use CGNAT (shared IPs), so your ""new"" IP might still be in the same range.



# Method 2: Renew DHCP Lease (For WiFi)

**Time:** 2 minutes | **Difficulty:** Easy | **Type:** Private IP (sometimes public if router reassigns)

This is the built-in iOS method that most people don't know exists:

1. Open **Settings** → **Wi-Fi**
2. Tap the **(i)** icon next to your connected network
3. Scroll down to find **Renew Lease**
4. Tap it once, then tap **Renew Lease** again to confirm
5. Your WiFi will disconnect briefly, then reconnect with a new local IP

**Why it works:** DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is how your router assigns IP addresses to devices. ""Renewing the lease"" forces your iPhone to request a new IP address from the router.

**When to use this:**

* Troubleshooting connection problems (""Unable to join network"" errors)
* Fixing IP conflicts (two devices accidentally got the same IP)
* Your iPhone is showing connected but no internet

**Real talk:** This method changes your *private* IP on your local network. It won't change what websites see (your public IP), but it's incredibly useful for fixing connectivity issues.

**Pro tip:** If you're repeatedly having to renew your lease, your router's DHCP settings might be misconfigured or you have too many devices for your IP pool. Time to check your router settings.



# Method 3: Router Restart (The Nuclear Option)

**Time:** 10-15 minutes | **Difficulty:** Easy | **Type:** Public IP

This is the most reliable way to get a completely new public IP address:

1. Unplug your router and modem from power
2. Wait **5-10 minutes** (seriously, don't skip this - some ISPs require 30+ minutes)
3. Plug modem back in, wait for it to fully boot (\~2 min)
4. Plug router back in, wait for it to fully boot (\~2 min)
5. Reconnect your iPhone to WiFi
6. Check your new IP at [whatismyipaddress.com](http://whatismyipaddress.com)

**Why it works:** Most ISPs use dynamic IP addresses that expire. When your router disconnects and reconnects, the ISP's system usually assigns a new IP from their pool.

**When to use this:**

* You need a different public IP (got banned, want fresh start)
* Troubleshooting serious connectivity issues
* Your ISP throttled your connection based on IP

**Limitations:**

* Affects everyone on your network
* Doesn't always work - some ISPs reassign the same IP
* Takes time (you'll be offline for 10+ minutes)
* If you have a static IP from your ISP, this won't change it

**From my experience:** This worked 80% of the time with my cable internet. The other 20%, I got the same IP back. Your mileage may vary depending on your ISP.



# Method 4: Switch Between WiFi and Cellular

**Time:** Instant | **Difficulty:** Brain-dead easy | **Type:** Public IP

This isn't so much ""changing"" your IP as using a different one:

* **On WiFi?** Turn WiFi off, use cellular data (you'll have your carrier's IP)
* **On cellular?** Connect to WiFi (you'll have your router's public IP)

**When to use this:**

* Quick way to access something that blocked your current IP
* Testing if the problem is WiFi-specific or cellular-specific
* You're traveling and need to switch networks

**Limitations:** Not really ""changing"" an IP, just switching between two IPs you already have access to. Also burns through cellular data if you were previously on WiFi.

# Method 5: VPN (The Comprehensive Solution)

**Time:** 5 minutes setup, instant thereafter | **Difficulty:** Easy | **Cost:** $3-10/month | **Type:** Public IP masking

Look, I know r/privacy has strong opinions about VPN marketing, so let me be straight with you: VPNs don't make you anonymous, but they **do** mask your IP address from websites and apps.

**How it actually works:**

1. Download VPN app (I've tested NordVPN, Surfshark, and ProtonVPN)
2. Connect to a server (US, UK, wherever)
3. Your traffic routes through that server
4. Websites see the VPN server's IP, not yours

**When a VPN actually makes sense:**

* You need to change your IP frequently
* You're on public WiFi a lot
* You want location-based content access
* You face ISP throttling
* You need consistent IP masking, not just one-time changes

**When you DON'T need a VPN:**

* One-time IP change (use airplane mode or router restart instead)
* Just troubleshooting connectivity (use DHCP renewal)
* You think it makes you ""anonymous"" (it doesn't - cookies, fingerprinting, and account logins still track you)

**Free vs Paid:** Free VPNs exist but are generally slow, have data caps, or sketchy privacy policies. If you're using a VPN for privacy, paying $3-5/month for a reputable one makes sense. If you just need to change your IP once, use the free methods above.

**From my experience:** I use a VPN when traveling or on coffee shop WiFi. For everyday browsing at home, the free methods work fine for occasional IP changes.

# Which Method Should You Actually Use?

**For troubleshooting WiFi problems:** → Start with **Renew DHCP Lease** (Method 2)

**For quick cellular IP change:** → Use **Airplane Mode trick** (Method 1)

**For serious public IP change:** → Try **Router restart** (Method 3) or **VPN** (Method 5)

**For accessing geo-blocked content:** → **VPN** (Method 5) is really your only option

**For temporary ban/rate limit:** → **Airplane Mode** (cellular) or **switch to cellular data** (if on WiFi)

# Important Limitations (Reality Check)

Changing your IP address **does NOT**:

❌ Make you anonymous (cookies, browser fingerprinting, login accounts still track you)  
❌ Protect you from malware or viruses  
❌ Automatically change your GPS location (apps can still see your real location)  
❌ Bypass all forms of device identification  
❌ Solve all connectivity problems (sometimes the issue isn't IP-related)  
❌ Necessarily speed up your internet

Changing your IP address **does**:

✅ Give you a different address that websites/apps see  
✅ Help resolve IP conflicts on your local network  
✅ Potentially bypass IP-based bans or rate limits  
✅ Help troubleshoot some connectivity issues  
✅ Add a layer of privacy (but not complete anonymity)

# Troubleshooting Common Issues

**""I renewed my lease but got the same IP""**

* Normal. Your router might reassign the same IP if it's available. Try manually setting a static IP instead (Settings → WiFi → Configure IP → Manual), picking a number at the higher end of your network range like [192.168.1.200](http://192.168.1.200)

**""My IP never changes even after router restart""**

* You might have a static IP from your ISP (common for business accounts). Contact your ISP to confirm. Or they use very long DHCP leases. Try leaving router unplugged for 24+ hours (yes, really).

**""Airplane mode doesn't change my cellular IP""**

* Some carriers use CGNAT (Carrier-Grade NAT), meaning multiple customers share the same public IP. The IP you get will be from a pool, but might appear similar. This is normal for mobile networks in 2025.

**""After changing IP, some apps stopped working""**

* Some apps/services are tied to your original IP for security. Banking apps, streaming services with household verification, etc. This is expected behavior. Clear app cache or wait 24 hours.

**""I changed my IP but I'm still banned""**

* Could be a cookie-based ban, account-based ban, or device fingerprint ban. Changing IP alone won't fix those. You'd need to clear cookies, use different browser/device, or create new account.

# The Bottom Line

For most situations, you don't need expensive tools or complicated setups. The airplane mode trick and DHCP renewal will handle 90% of what people need. Router restart works when you need a new public IP. Only go for a VPN if you need ongoing IP masking or location spoofing.

I spent weeks testing these methods because I was having IP conflicts on my home network (turned out three devices were fighting over the same address). The DHCP renewal fixed it instantly. Later I got temporarily rate-limited on a website, airplane mode trick solved it in 30 seconds.

*Quick note: I'm not affiliated with any VPN company. I tested these methods on iPhone 13 Pro (iOS 17.4) and iPhone 15 (iOS 18.1). Steps should be nearly identical on other iPhone models and recent iOS versions.*",1,1763529902.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

Okay i’m not on reddit too much but i really just wanted to hear more opinions and rant. and also get advice on how to proceed with the situation and maybe even confront her about her actions?!

Okay so I [18 F] returned to brick and mortar school this september after being online for a while. On my first day back i see my ex from freshman year [also 18F] , i walk past her in the hallway and she looks at me eyes wide jaw drooped like not kidding at all. i gave her a polite wave bc ofc she’s a sweet person and our breakup was a long time ago and was mostly due to me just needing time for myself and we weren’t on bad terms plus she had a girlfriend. I see her in the hallways and we chat occasionally all is lovely. 

The next week i come home and my mom asks me “did you buy a book” and i’m like no i’m poor im not buying anything, she hands me the book and says it was on out doorstep. I’m so confused but then i look the the book and it’s THE book. She bought this art book for me way back in freshman year when we were dating bc she said it reminded her of me but we broke up before she could give it to me. Let me preface this i have never expressed to her that i would like the book nor have i asked for it this was very unexpected. Also to clarify she lives in my neighborhood so it’s not like she drove 30 minutes to do this lol. ANYWAYS i text her and let her know she can say hello next time and that she’s always welcome to my friendship and support and things don’t need to be weird between us and we get to talking more. A few days later she calls me and tells me her and her girlfriend broke up and she was talking yo me about it because i’m supportive and easy to talk to. 

The next night we face time and we talk and hard core flirt to like 2:00 am. The next day she carpools me to school bc my normal ride couldn’t. 

She picked me up early, got me coffee wouldn’t let me pay, let me pick the music put her hand on my thigh and we ended up hardcore kissing in her car and i was like so flabbergasted but it was consensual and very nice so no complaints dw! That day at school she’s very touchy and asks if we can hang out after school and i suggest she comes over to my house to study , we don’t study and some other stuff happens (not bad stuff just tmi stuff lol). It was my first time doing “other stuff” and she was very nice and attentive and before we did anything she promised this meant something to her over and over. This started almost like two months of messing around but there was also a lot of history and feelings attached. 

She said she really wanted to date me but wanted to be ready and get better for me first and i of course respected. We talked a lot about everything i told her all my quirks and chronic illnesses and all my feelings and we both agreed we had romantic feelings and care a lot about each other. I feel like she had some insecure attachment problems it was almost like she was looking for reasons we wouldn’t work and i always talked her out of thinking that way and resolving things bc yk they were just non issues to me but i listened to her and we always talked through problems pretty healthily in my opinion. 

The whole thing was very romantic it was in no way just physical at least not for me and she acted like it wasn’t for her. She was always very affectionate and sweet lots of pet names and smiles we’d bicker like an old married couple she tied my shoes for me for gods sake i literally got princess treatment basically she gave me her sweater and when i gave it back she said she loved that it smelled like me. I played guitar for her loves songs and other songs, she told me about her nerdy interests and we would talk about greys anatomy bc we both loved it! She showered me with compliments and touchiness she literally called me hers all the time and loved it when i did the same. It was all good light breezy sweet teenage romance. 

And then it wasn’t. 
i was sick for a couple days and when i came back she was so distant not affectionate at all and she’d been avoiding calls for a couple days maybe like 3 and id been giving her space. 

I knew something was up when in the car i was putting on my perfume and i offered her some ( she would always take one spray of my perfume because she wanted to smell like me ) but today she declined. It’s a small thing but paired with all the other stuff it just added to my worry. I had like the worst feeling ever all day. I see her walking in the hallway with this girl M i see her and go “boo!” (normally we walk together) she awkwardly said “ oh hi” and then turned to face forward and kept walking so i gave her space and walked alone. 

That night i decided to talk to her abt it. She wouldn’t call so this was all over text. basically I asked her if I had done something wrong because she’d been distant lately and she said no you didn’t do anything wrong. None of this is your fault. You’re such an amazing girl. You’re so sweet and I care so much about you and that’s when I knew it was over. Nobody goes on a whole monologue about how much they care about you and how they don’t wanna make things weird unless they’re about to break your heart. This conversation was approached much more elegantly and maturely, but long story short she basically said that she lost feelings for me and she just needed to not be in a relationship right now and needed to be alone to work on herself which I completely understand and I’m not mad at her for. she also asked if we could still be friends and I agreed because I care about her a lot and I just wanna be as close to her as she’ll let me. I was honest with her about how she made me feel but made sure she knew that I’m not blaming her or angry with her at all she apologized a lot and that was the conversation basically.

 So anyways that went down i was sad and upset bc i was trying really hard to make things work but i kinda saw it coming and i understood she didn’t want any kind of relationship and need to work on herself.

That saturday (2 days later) 
She posted M (the girl i saw her with and the girl she would occasionally talk to me about towards the end of the situationship) on her story to like a love song with heat emojis and shit. and i’m just like work on yourself my booty cheeks bc what?! I mean i just want her to be happy but also im kinda worried for this girl because my ex is kinda starting to show and f boy esc pattern. 

Also she said she wanted to be friends but has been actively ignoring me and avoiding me refusing to even look at me in the halls or anything.

I’m just so confused how can someone go from acting like their in love to avoiding me completely in less than a week especially with all of our history and connection. I don’t want her back at all i just keep running over every interaction thinking “did she mean any of it or did she just want to hit it and quit it?”  I mean she’s a good person and i care about her this whole things just very jarring and i’m very confused. 

But be honest did i get played? Any advice or commentary is appreciated i just needed to rant/ hear from an objective group thank you for reading my yap!",1,1763529864.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

# Introduction

Apache Kafka is a **distributed event streaming platform** designed for handling massive amounts of real-time data. Initially developed at **LinkedIn** and later open-sourced under the **Apache Software Foundation**, Kafka has evolved into the **backbone of modern data pipelines and Message Queues**.

It enables organizations to build scalable, fault-tolerant systems that can handle Trillions **of messages per day**. And you’re collecting logs, tracking user activity, or processing financial transactions from a Website or App, Kafka ensures **low-latency data movement** between systems. 

# Kafka Evolution: From Queue to Stream

Traditional message queues, such as RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, and **Amazon SQS**, rely on a **point-to-point model**, where messages are delivered once and then deleted. Kafka, on the other hand, introduced the concept of a **distributed commit log** — allowing consumers to read messages multiple times. The user can also read their Previous message.

**Key Differences:**



* **Message Retention:** Kafka retains messages for a configurable time, even after consumption.
* **Scalability:** Kafka partitions topics to distribute data across multiple brokers.
* **High Throughput:** Supports millions of messages per second with minimal latency.
* **Stream Processing:** Kafka Streams API allows continuous computation over streams.



# Kafka Architecture Overview

Kafka’s architecture revolves around **four main components**: Producers, Consumers, Brokers, and Topics.

Here’s how data flows:



1. **Producers** publish messages to **topics**.
2. **Brokers** store and manage these topics.
3. **Consumers** read data from the topics.



Each topic is divided into **partitions**, distributed across brokers for parallelism.



* You’ll typically have **3+ brokers** for fault tolerance.
* **Replication factor = 3** ensures no data loss.
* **Partitions** enable scalability and ordering.



Kafka guarantees **high throughput, durability, and scalability**—making it ideal for Node. JS-based microservices that rely on message-driven design.

# Producer

A **producer** is a client that publishes records (messages) to a Kafka topic. Each message is assigned to a partition based on a key or randomly. You can Also Define a Key or Groups. Send messages asynchronously to brokers.

*Key Configurations for Production:*

**Config Description**

acks: 'all': Waits for all replicas to acknowledge the message

retries: 10: Number of retry attempts

[linger.ms](http://linger.ms/): 5

Enables batching for performance: enable. idempotence: true

**Best Practice:** Use environment variables for credentials, and don’t allow auto-topic creation in production to avoid unplanned topic growth.

# Consumers

A **Kafka consumer** reads messages from topics and processes them in consumer groups. Each consumer in a group gets a subset of partitions — ensuring **load balancing** and **fault tolerance**.

*Features:*



* **Offset Tracking:** Consumers maintain offsets to know which messages they’ve read.
* **Rebalancing:** When a consumer joins or leaves, Kafka redistributes partitions.
* **Parallelism:** Multiple consumers increase throughput.



**Tip:** Always handle errors gracefully with Try and Catch Block and commit offsets **after** successful processing.

# Brokers & Clusters

Kafka **brokers** form the backbone of your Kafka cluster. Each broker stores partitions and handles read/write requests from producers and consumers.

Production Considerations:



* Minimum **3 brokers** per cluster.
* Use a **replication factor of 3** for resilience when handling a Large amount of data, like log messages, etc.
* Monitor broker health using **Prometheus** or **Burrow**.



Use **rack awareness** to distribute replicas across data centers.

# Topics & Partitions

A **topic** is a logical channel for messages. Each topic has **partitions**, which determine throughput and parallelism.



* **Topic:** Stream of messages
* **Partition:** Ordered, immutable sequence
* **Offset:** Message index within a partition
* **Parallelism:** Each partition can be consumed independently.
* **Ordering:** Guaranteed within a single partition.
* **Scalability:** Add partitions to handle higher load.



***Production Tips:***



* Don’t exceed **1000 partitions per broker**.
* Define partitions based on **traffic patterns**.
* Use keys to maintain **ordering guarantees**.



# Schema Registry

In production, maintaining consistent data structures across microservices is critical. **Schema Registry** enforces contracts between producers and consumers.

Benefits:



* Prevents breaking changes.
* Allows **versioned evolution** of message schemas.



Works with **Avro**, **JSON Schema**, and **Protobuf**.

You can use **Confluent Schema Registry** or **Redpanda Schema Registry** with KafkaJS using the u/kafkajs/confluent-schema-registry package.

# Security (SASL, SSL, ACLs)

Security Layers:



1. **SASL/SSL Authentication:** Ensures secure identity verification.
2. **Authorization (ACLs):** Controls access to topics.
3. **Encryption (TLS):** Protects data in transit



# Error Handling & Retry Logic

In real-world production systems, things fail — brokers go down, messages get corrupted, or network issues arise.

Best Practices:



* **Retry Policy:** Use exponential backoff.
* **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ):** Capture failed messages.
* **Idempotent Producers:** Prevent duplicates on retry.



**Poison Message Handling:** Skip or park malformed events.

# Monitoring & Logging

Monitoring Stack:



* **Prometheus:** Metrics collection
* **Grafana:** Visualization
* **Burrow:** Lag monitoring
* **ELK Stack:** Log aggregation
*  Performance Tuning



Optimize Kafka for large-scale Node.js production systems:



* Enable **compression (lz4/snappy)**.
* Tune **batch.size** and **linger.ms** for producers.
* Increase **fetch.max.bytes** for consumers.
* Use **async/await** instead of blocking loops.



Key Metrics:



* Consumer lag
* Broker disk usage
* Partition under-replication
* Message throughput (MB/s)



# Message Key

The **message key** determines which partition a record belongs to. It also ensures the ordering of related messages.

Example:



* Key = user123 → All events for this user go to the same partition.
* No key = random partition assignment.



# Serialization

Serialization converts structured data into a byte stream for transmission. Kafka supports multiple formats:



* **JSON:** Simple and readable.
* **Avro:** Compact and schema-based.
* **Protobuf:** Language-neutral and version-safe.



# KRaft (Kafka Raft Metadata Mode)

Introduced in Kafka 2.8+, **KRaft** (Kafka Raft) eliminates the need for ZooKeeper. It simplifies cluster management by embedding consensus and metadata storage directly into Kafka.

Advantages:



* Easier deployment and maintenance.
* Faster startup times.
* Enhanced fault tolerance.



# Integration with Logstash and Filebeat

Kafka works seamlessly with open-source tools like:



* **Logstash:** Collects, transforms, and forwards logs to Kafka.
* **Filebeat:** Lightweight agent for forwarding file-based logs.



This integration allows you to build **real-time data pipelines** from systems, logs, and applications into analytics or storage platforms.

Example pipeline: Filebeat → Logstash → Kafka → Spark → Elasticsearch

# Deployment: Docker Compose Example

# FAQs

1. What’s the best library for Kafka in Node.js?

 **KafkaJS** — it’s lightweight, production-ready, and actively maintained.

2. How do I handle message duplication?

 Enable enable.idempotence=true and use keys for deterministic partitioning.

3. Should I use Kafka with or without ZooKeeper?

 Prefer **KRaft mode** (Kafka 3.5+), which removes ZooKeeper dependency.

4. Can I use Kafka for real-time analytics?

 Yes. Pair Kafka with **ksqlDB** or **Apache Flink** for streaming analytics.

5. What’s the difference between Avro and JSON Schema?

 Avro is compact and faster for binary transport; JSON Schema is human-readable but less efficient.

6. How do I monitor consumer lag?

 Use **Burrow**, **Prometheus Kafka Exporter**, or **Confluent Control Center**.

I run a mid-sized group of firms headquartered in Business Bay with two additional branches in Sharjah and a back-office team in Islamabad.

Who we are:
We are an established operation offering Accounting, Corporate Tax, VAT, and AML services. Unlike many ""startup"" posts here, we are already revenue-generating with a solid client base and operational infrastructure.

The Goal:
We see a massive opportunity to automate and scale our services. We want to transition from a traditional service model to a tech-enabled fintech/regtech operation. We have the industry expertise and the market access; we are missing the technical leadership to build the engine.

Who we are looking for:
A hands-on Tech Partner/CTO. You shouldn't just be a coder; you need to understand how to build scalable architecture. We aren't looking for a freelancer or an agency—we want a partner who wants skin in the game and to build something massive with us.

1p0ysgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wichita/comments/1p0ysgv/city_manager_finalists_community_forum_thoughts/,City Manager finalists community forum: thoughts and impressions.,"I’m gonna start by walking through [my Flock-related concerns](https://old.reddit.com/r/wichita/comments/1oz9q5e/43minute_comprehensive_breakdown_of_the_security/) and how each of the three candidates chose to respond. For context, my question was rejected from being read aloud during the forum, which didn’t really surprise me and I took minimal offense to this quiet form of censorship. The question, as written:

> With the exception of Manhattan KS, every city in which each of you has served has previously bought-in to third party mass surveillance startups like Flock Security. These programs represent gross misapplication of public treasury and open the door to constitutional violations and comprehensive data breaches. What are your plans with regards to spying on Wichitans, should you be chosen as City Manager?

In their shoes, I probably wouldn’t select my question to be read aloud either. Instead of including my question, the lady screening the submissions chose to cap the night by offering the candidates a pair of ""softball"" back-to-back questions about our library system – each of the candidates answered the second library question with, basically, “See Previous Answer.” So yeah.

There was time for one-on-one questions after the forum, so I did that. I approached each of the three finalists and attempted to suss out their positions on this topic.

---

**Donte Martin** walked away from me as soon as I said the word Flock. I have no idea *what* his thoughts are on this topic, but he scores a big fat 0 on community engagement or building positive relationships with the public in my book. I say this recognizing that, to others, Donte is probably *very* active in building those relationships, and I'd be willing to course-correct my opinion given additional insights into his qualities of leadership, should any such opportunity present itself.

**Dennis Marstall** and **Mark Freitag** claimed their own respective levels of ignorance to the subject, despite both coming from cities where these monitoring systems have already been in place for a handful of years. Dennis responded that he would like to see a more comprehensive analysis of the surveillance programs we have in place, and expressed a desire to learn more about the subject before making any kind of decision on the matter. Mark was of a similar mind, but seemed to be even less informed on the subject.

I wasn’t *really* expecting any of them to mirror my concerns, but Donte cutting me off and walking away effectively tanks my reputation of him as a potential city leader. That’s just not how you build community or foster confidence in constituents, my guy. I also have the impression, based on his answers during the forum, that he doesn’t have a vision for Wichita, and would lead through office politics and delegating blame, which sucks because he’s the only one of the candidates with a deep institutional knowledge of Wichita, being of local stock.

---

Now, here's my impressions of their handling of topics raised during the forum. There will likely be more reporting on their responses by Actual Media, so take it with a grain of salt that these are only my own impressions, and I likely do NOT have the fullest picture of where/how any one of these finalists stand on the issues at hand.

Each candidate had about 50 minutes to speak in response to the same series of questions. Mark went first, then Dennis, then Donte. Mark's answers were, overall, fairly vague and he had more to say about the achievements of others than his own specific actions; Dennis's answers were concise and stemmed from germane experience; Donte answered like a middle-management interview at the mall. (Can you tell that I'm still sour?)

Mark Freitag claims to be a “hands off” city manager, implicitly trusting department heads to “get it done.” Many of the programs and achievements he cited from his past experiences were either already in place before he got there, or were built-up by others in the city community without his direct input.

With regards to spending taxpayer dollars, Mark’s philosophy is, “Effective first, efficient second.”

For the 7 of his 9 years serving as city manger in Janesville, the city budget was not balanced. He expressed that there was one year where the budget ended on a high note, which he said made him “feel lucky.”

Mark has previously been deployed to Belarus, Georgia (country), and Russia, in a role he failed to accurately convey in the moment or I just missed. I'll admit that name-dropping those countries, in that order, at this event, filled me with a sense of dread that may have distracted me for a crucial moment in which he detailed his function in those countries. I don't know.

When asked how he would strengthen citizen oversight of Wichita’s police department, Mark brought up a program he fostered called the Chief’s Advisory Council, and seems to be a proponent of always including an outside investigation whenever police step out of line. Wichita already *has* systems in place similar to this, but I hope that his bringing up the CAC means he would support additional oversight of our law enforcement.

Beyond that, Mark Freitag didn’t quite communicate a vision for Wichita, or even a passing knowledge of what or who we are as a community. My impression of him is that he would spend most of his days golfing with rich white dudes, and allow the city to operate without much in the way of active oversight or leadership.

**Final Performance Grade: C.**

---

Conversely, Dennis Marstall said a whole lot of things that piqued my hopes. He’s originally from Kansas, and came in to the forum tonight with a fair working knowledge of Wichita’s culture. Of the three candidates, Dennis appears able to balance what he already knows through decades of city management experience and what he still needs to learn – he’s open about his blind spots, and seems to invite communication and continuing learning.

Dennis says he wants to spend the first six months in his position, “Looking, Asking, and Feeling Out” our city services, with tours of districts, ride-alongs, and hands-on listening within the community.

Dennis expressed multiple times that he understands that the solution to systemic problems comes in the form of holistic plans. He cited an example: if the city were to allocate 3 million dollars to hiring additional police officers, he would explore reducing that to 2 million and defer the remaining million into some entirely separate community issue which runs parallel to the vision of ensuring safer streets and communities. He does not appear to suffer from budgetary tunnel-vision.

Dennis wants us to be revenue-neutral as we develop, work, and fund strategic plans. “Does this benefit the entire community?” is a question he claims to ask often. His vision involves “growing the city by making people WANT to be here.” He challenges department directors to spend taxpayer dollars intelligently.

*(When asked about increasing the walkability of Wichita, nobody mentioned revitalizing our downtown core with an emphasis on walkable livestyles, which feels like a no-brainer answer that they all missed.)*

Dennis appears to be cut from a similar cloth as Governor Kelly, in that both follow the notion that supporting and growing a vibrant business community leads to a direct uptick in nonprofits and philanthropy.

Dennis has a background in working in libraries, and wants to increase our library staffing, pursue additional library grants, and expanding a Bookmobile program to reach even more of our city.

**Final Performance Grade: B+.**

---

Dante Martin, and it does pain me to say this, just doesn’t appear to have a plan or vision for Wichita. I want to keep our leadership local as much as possible, but I can’t shake the feeling that Dante’s leadership will be day after day of shifting accountability elsewhere, or using committees and lack of communication as a screen for not getting things done. I hate having this vibe, and it was stewing before Dante had a chance to blow me off.

Like Mark, Dante’s answers mostly boiled down to sharing in the credit of programs and plans laid out by others, or propelling solutions enacted without much input from him.

Dante wants to lean heavily into Greater Wichita partnerships. He wants to build more robust talent pipelines, and says that the challenge is executing the plans that are already in place.

Dante’s strongest point came in the form of tackling crime and poverty by increasing early childhood literacy rates, citing this as a key part of creating downstream benefits to our city health. This mirrors Dennis’s strong “holistic approach” to solution-making.

Overall, it seems that Dante's primary selling point is that he's already inside the Wichita bureaucracy. The transition from Bob Layton to Dante Martin would probably be smoother than bringing in a genuine outsider, and in most instances I would cite this as a positive thing. I am now of the opinion that shaking things up with an outsider would be preferable to propagating this form of the status quo.

**Final Performance Grade: D-.**

---

I apologize if/that this is too editorialized to be useful to you.

For my money, I’d be most comfortable with Dennis Marstall as our next City Manager. He has the right stuff, and seems keen on falling in love with Wichita. I think he’d fit well, and bring passion to his work in a way I just didn’t sense from either Dante or Mark.

1p0yrfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1p0yrfx/the_god_circuit_part_ii_why_the_monroe_wave_is/,"The God Circuit, Part II: Why the Monroe Wave Is Just Neuroplasticity in Disguise","Robert Monroe didn't invent magic. He just gave it a frequency.

I was talking to my friend the other day—he's a civil engineer, the kind of guy who builds bridges and trusts math more than metaphysics. He'd read my first God Circuit piece and cornered me at a coffee shop with that look engineers get when reality starts acting suspicious.

""Okay,"" he said, stirring his coffee like he was mixing concrete, ""give me the translation. What's this Monroe Wave thing actually doing to people's brains? And don't give me the mystical version. Give me the version that won't make my calculator cry.""

So here's the translation. The engineer's guide to consciousness hacking. The scientific breakdown of why some frequencies literally teach your brain to believe itself into new realities.

# What the Monroe Wave Is — Minus the Jargon

The Monroe Wave is a pattern of hemispheric synchronization.

Think of it like this: your brain has two singers—left hemisphere and right hemisphere—who've been trying to harmonize for your entire life but keep hitting different notes. The left brain wants to analyze everything into neat little boxes. The right brain wants to feel everything into vast, swirling patterns.

Most of the time, they're slightly off-key from each other. Not terrible, but not... unified.

The Monroe Wave is the frequency that gets both singers to finally hit the same harmony.

When both sides of the brain hum in unison, consciousness stretches like warm glass.

Monroe figured out that if you feed slightly different frequencies to each ear—say 100 Hz to the left, 104 Hz to the right—the brain does something fascinating. It creates a third frequency, a phantom beat at 4 Hz, trying to reconcile the difference. That 4 Hz pulse becomes the conductor, getting both hemispheres to sync up and dance together.

It's like tuning a guitar. Except the guitar is your consciousness, and when it's finally in tune, you can play songs that were impossible before.

# Neuroplasticity: The Body's Built-In Spellwork

Here's where it gets interesting for people like Sammy who need their magic to have mechanisms.

Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to rewire itself based on repeated patterns of thought and emotion. Every time you think a thought, you're literally carving a groove in your neural network. Think the same thought with enough emotional charge, enough repetition, and that groove becomes a highway.

This is the mechanical proof of manifestation. We literally sculpt the receiver before the signal arrives.

When you're in a Monroe Wave state, your brain is in optimal rewiring mode. The hemispheric synchronization creates what neuroscientists call a ""hypnagogic state""—that drowsy, dreamlike consciousness where the usual filters drop away and the brain becomes more plastic, more moldable.

It's like heating metal before you forge it. The Monroe frequency heats up your consciousness, making it soft enough to reshape.

So when people talk about ""manifesting"" in these states, they're not just thinking positive thoughts into the void. They're literally reorganizing their neural architecture. They're building new highways in their brain that lead to different destinations.

Your thoughts aren't just wishes. They're construction equipment.

# The Crossover Point — Where Science Meets Spell

Here's what I find delicious about this whole thing: Monroe measured it, but witches have been using it for centuries.

The frequency range Monroe discovered—4 to 8 Hz—is the same range shamans, mystics, and hedge witches have been accessing through drumming, chanting, breathwork, and ritual for millennia. They just didn't have the technology to measure the brain waves.

You call it casting, they call it conditioning. Same process, different vocabulary.

Both traditions understand that repetition plus emotional charge equals reality alteration. Whether you're chanting over a candle or listening to binaural beats through headphones, you're doing the same thing: changing matter through repetition and emotional charge.

The witch knows her spell works because she can feel the shift in consciousness. The neuroscientist knows it works because they can measure the shift in brain waves. Same shift, different instruments.

Monroe just gave us the training wheels. Instead of spending years learning to drum yourself into trance, you can put on headphones and get there in twenty minutes.

It's the democratization of consciousness states. Magic for people who need their mysticism to come with user manuals.

# The Takeaway

Don't chase the exotic; train the brain.

I see people spending thousands of dollars on crystals, courses, and consciousness retreats, looking for some external technology to shift their reality. Meanwhile, the most sophisticated reality-creation device ever designed is sitting between their ears, and most people never learn how to operate it properly.

Your magic isn't in the candle; it's in the circuit.

The Monroe Wave is just one tool for accessing neuroplastic states. But once you understand the principle—that consciousness can be tuned like an instrument, and that tuned consciousness can literally rewire reality—you realize you don't need special equipment.

You need special understanding.

You need to grasp that your brain is not fixed. Your patterns are not permanent. Your reality is not set in stone.

Every thought you think with emotional intensity is vote for the world you want to live in. The Monroe Wave just makes those votes count double.

# Why This Matters Now

We're living in a time when the old systems—religion, government, education—are teaching us to outsource our power. To wait for salvation, permission, or instruction from external authorities.

But consciousness research is proving what mystics have always known: you are the authority. Your brain is the temple. Your thoughts are the prayers that reshape matter.

Understanding the Monroe Wave isn't about becoming a better manifester. It's about becoming a more conscious creator. It's about realizing that reality isn't something that happens to you—it's something that broadcasts from you.

When you know that your brain waves can be tuned, that your neural networks can be rewired, that your consciousness can be trained like a muscle, you stop being a victim of circumstance and start being an artist of experience.

That's not magic. That's just applied neuroscience.

But honestly? The distinction is starting to matter less and less.

# A Final Note for All the Other Engineers

You don't have to believe in magic to use these tools. You just have to believe in neuroplasticity. You just have to accept that your brain is more flexible than you were taught, and that consciousness is more trainable than anyone told you.

The Monroe Wave works whether you think it's science or sorcery. Neuroplasticity operates whether you call it brain training or spell casting.

Call it neuroplasticity or witchcraft—either way, your thoughts are rewiring the cosmos.

That’s fine. The real problem is when the spend suddenly speeds up in a way that doesn’t match your budget, doesn’t match the metrics, and definitely doesn’t match reality. That’s when it’s not “optimization” anymore — it’s real overspending.

Here’s a simple example.  
Daily budget: €48.  
Rough hourly pace: €2/h.

You check at 9:00 and see €3.20 spent. All good.  
At 9:15 you’re already close to €10.  
At 9:27 you’re at €17.  
At 9:40 you’ve passed €25.  
And during all of this? No leads, no meaningful clicks, nothing that justifies that acceleration.

When spend ramps up like this and Meta isn’t showing the usual “we’ll compensate later” message, it’s a huge sign that the algorithm is running out of control. And if you leave it alone, it can burn half your daily budget before you finish your coffee.

The worst move here is turning the whole campaign off.  
A softer approach works much better: lower the budget by 20–30% to slow things down without completely breaking the learning phase. Then set a spending limit at account or campaign level — the safety belt nobody uses until it’s too late.

For the next 30–40 minutes, watch the auction behavior. If CPM jumps, CTR drops, and Meta starts pushing your ads into weird placements, it’s usually a temporary instability.  
But here’s the rule of thumb: if things don’t stabilize within that 30–40 minute window, and spend keeps climbing with zero results, pause the ad set (not the whole campaign).  
Give it a couple of hours or just restart it tomorrow with a more controlled setup.

In short: overspending becomes obvious when spend speed has nothing to do with your budget or the quality of traffic. Slow it down, cap it, observe it — and only stop it when you’re sure it won’t correct itself.

I would like to cry but I can’t because my eyes will puff up even more. :) 

About six months ago, I started waking up with really puffy eyebags. They are not genetic and seemed to appear out of the blue. I have tried everything: caffeine creams, lymphatic massages, cold compresses, masks, dandelion tea / pills, sleeping with my head elevated, changing detergents, cutting off salt, exercising, sauna, etc etc. My usual de-puffing routines that worked in the past aren’t helping at ALL. Every day, I’m waking up with insanely puffy eyes no matter how long I’ve slept. The only things that help somewhat are drinking a LOT of coffee, exercise, or just waiting 5-6 hours for them to go down.

I went to an allergist and he told me I’m allergic to tree pollens, grasses, and mold. He also said that my turbinates seem to be swollen. I started Dymista (azelastine + fluticasone) and Alavert about two weeks ago but it’s not helping the eyebags even a little. 

All my bloodwork came back normal, including kidneys, liver, iron, etc. I thought maybe my thyroid was the problem, given my additional symptoms of frequent constipation, always feeling cold, extremely brittle and dry hair, irregular periods, brain fog, fatigue, needing 10-12 hours of sleep to feel normal, and very poor memory. However, TSH, T3, T4, and even TPO antibodies came back normal.

The only thing off was an ANA titer of 1:320 with a nuclear dense fine speckled pattern.

She went insane after the death of her husband, left her life and child behind, because looking at Robert reminded her too much or her husband, knowing that Robert(as a good man like her husband and his father before him) would someday follow the same blueprint as the men in his family always seem to do and consequently die in the same suit.

Roberts mother felt a kinship with cats, passively obsessing about their 9-lives mythos, and how if (in her psychosis) she was a cat, it would stand to reason that her son would be as well, meaning that he would also have 9 lives, and would survive the curse of dying in that cursed family suit.

 After a while of struggling on her own, she needed something with purpose to allow her to actually live. The only connections she had were of the hero variety, so in desperation, she reached out to a member of the Brave Brigade (one of the 4 who have not been introduced to yet) who works high up in one of the top tier branches in SDN. She took the offer with a caveat; No one would see her face, or know who she is. She could not be at the branch the Brave Brigade worked, as it was too close to her past, and the solution was simple: go to low-tier, low-stakes branch, where people wouldn't care or try to figure it out.



 She found some semblance of peace working in that SDN branch for a time: watching bottom-rung heroes catch purse-thieves and getting dispatchers coffee and paperwork.

**Answer:**

Hey, I’m sorry you’re going through this. The frustration must be overwhelming, especially when you’ve tried so many remedies with little relief. I’ve had my own share of skin issues tied to stress, and it can really mess with your head.

Sometimes, our bodies react when our minds are dealing with unresolved stress or conflict. It's like when our brains miss something that feels threatening, our bodies spring into a survival mode—resulting in symptoms like those puffy eyes.

For you, it could be that your body is responding to something deeper, like emotional stress or an ongoing conflict in your life that you might not be fully aware of. The fatigue and other symptoms could also be a part of this protective response.

Here are a few questions you might reflect on:

1. Is there something particularly stressful that started around the same time your symptoms began?

2. Are you going through a period of change or uncertainty right now?

3. Do you feel overwhelmed by obligations or feel like you’re stretching too thin?

4. How do you usually cope with stress or emotional upheavals?

5. Is there anything emotionally ‘puffy’—like feelings or conflicts—that might be weighing you down?

Exploring these might not fix everything overnight, but it can be a step in understanding your body better. Hang in there, and feel free to ask more questions if you need to chat.",1,1763528504.0,mytorial,0,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/kWhPHm206M): **January 19, 2025**

I'm currently pregnant with my second child. I found out three days before Christmas, and told my husband the following day. He was pleased as punch... myself, excited but more than a little nervous. Big mixed bag of feelings. For this and other reasons, I asked my husband if we could keep the news between us for a while and let me process/adjust to this new reality before sharing with our family/friends.

His response... ""I'm so excited - can I just tell Work Friend?""

I repeated that I would prefer to keep it between us for now, at least to get through the holidays without all the focus on us.

Fewer than ten minutes later he says ""Work Friend is super happy for us! And I told Other Friend, she says congratulations.""

I let him know I was disappointed and I thought his behavior was super disrespectful and shitty, but whatever, it's out of my hands now. He assured me that he wasn't going to tell anyone else.

Fast forward through the weeks following Christmas, during which he pestered and pressured me to tell his family members before I was ready. Again, we had his parents casually over for coffee one night and he ""let it slip"" without my consent because he's ""just so excited"".

Repeat this process with a few other friends and family members.

For whatever reason, he hasn't yet ""let it slip"" to his paternal grandparents. Because of this, his dad has been pressuring him to call them. Today, his dad gave him an ultimatum: he would say something before the end of the day if my husband didn't.

Husband comes home in a super disagreeable mood and proceeds to vent to me about his dad's total lack of consideration and how angry he is over this ultimatum. I calmly listen to him, and I agree, it's not a nice thing to do. It's not his dad's news to share. It IS inconsiderate. But this is where maybe I'm the asshole - ""I love you, but does this maybe give you some context for how it felt when you did the same thing to me?""

He then gets even angrier and tells me that it's not the same situation at all, criticizes me for making it about myself, says I have a victim mindset, he just needs support from me and not ""whatever this is"".

I then also blew up at him, defending myself, and we've hardly spoken for the rest of the night.

I can't wrap my head around him wanting sympathy from me after repeatedly hurting me with almost the same behavior.

but is it not the same situation? Is he right? Should I have put my own resentment aside to help him feel better? DID I selfishly make it about me? Maybe he would have made the connection without me pointing it out, or maybe he would have been more receptive if I just gave him a hug and let him calm down for a while.

I don't think so... I'm still livid. But please tell me what you think, outside observer.

**Relevant Comments**

**Downvoted Commenter:** NAH! Neither you or your husband is an ahole. You told your husband that he was going to be a father. That isn't just YOUR news. Sure, I know you may have wanted to keep it quiet, but this has clearly been a dream for your husband. Imagine someone you love coming to you and telling you they are going to make you a parent, when you really want to be a parent! That's exciting! He was excited! He is thrilled. He has every right to be! You may have wanted that information to stay a secret, but everyone has their own feelings about becoming a parent and, truthfully, this isn't something you can control for him. He is entitled to share something so monumental - even if you don't want him to. It's like a wedding. It wasn't just your wedding. It was his too. So, I can understand his enthusiasm and his excitement.

I would encourage you to not make this your line in the sand. Having a child is serious and there are so many issues to face. I can understand not wanting people to know before a certain time. However, I also understand the other side. You both are going to have to get over this now. You have bigger fish to fry! I suggest you sit down with your husband and tell him your reasons for wanting to keep it quiet. Tell him how you felt when he told people. Tell him that you understand his excitement, but just like he didn't want to tell his grandparents yet, you didn't want him to tell everyone yet. Now that things are out, you two have to work together. I encourage you to get counseling RIGHT NOW! Having a kid will introduce extraordinary challenges to your relationship, so if you aren't on the same page, you are going to have a lot of bigger issues. Please get marriage counseling now so you can learn how to better work together. Your little bundle of joy is coming and both of you are going to have to work together. Forgive his faux pas, even if he doesn't ask for it. Embrace him with love and let him embrace you with love. A man who is excited to see his beautiful wife bringing his child into the world is a fantastic thing. Congrats to both of you and I wish all three of you the absolute best!

> **OOP:** Your reply made me tear up, thank you. I do want to clarify that we are already parents to a spectacular toddler - this will be our second. I have suggested couples counseling to him for the sake of our communication, but he always finds a reason not to proceed. It makes me feel uneasy. This type of conflict tends to pop up pretty frequently for us. Heavy sigh. Your words still gave me a breath of optimism so thank you for taking such an understanding stance. And thank you for the well wishes.

**Downvoted Commenter 2:** YTA  The news was both yours and your husband's to share. His father, however, is not one of those people who gets to choose who knows when. So, no, the situation is not the same.

> **OOP:** You're right that is it's not my news alone. With all due respect, he is the one who denied us the opportunity for a discussion by going ahead with what he wanted to do.

**Commenter 1:** NTA. You are correct. He is a man baby. You should be even more angry than the initial betrayal because he clearly hates it being done to him but is fine with doing the same thing to you. Reconsider marriage and pregnancy.

> **OOP:** This is the part that has my head spinning the most... he clearly feels it's inappropriate behaviour, but not when he does it to me? And then thinks I will feel sorry for him? It's actually insane... It makes me worry about his mental health that he doesn't see how batshit this logic is... and mine. If I were my friend seeking advice, I would be having some words with me. Ughhhh.

**Commenter 2:** Criticizes you for... making your pregnancy... about yourself?! Did I fucking read that correctly?! NTA and I seriously hope this is just a brain fart on his part and not part of a pattern of how he treats you and your feelings.

> **OOP:** That first part made me LOL. Also loling because it totally is a pattern hahahahaha 🙃😭.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/c87FKrRDrm): **November 12, 2025 (nearly 10 months later)**

UPDATE: AITAH for offering no sympathy to my husband when his dad crossed a boundary?

original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/y4D3ubqeOb

Well, it’s been almost a year since I ghosted everyone on my original post. I was… overwhelmed, to say the least, by the responses. I still think about that situation often, and now that some time has passed, I wanted to reflect and update anyone who’s curious.

First, some quick notes:

1) My post was not karma farming, and everything I described actually did happen. Like a few of you guessed, it’s the kind of thing that happens pretty often with my partner. I’ll admit, I was fairly sure I wasn’t the asshole, but I was genuinely questioning reality. I guess I was looking for validation that I wasn't crazy.

2) I gave birth to my beautiful baby girl in early August! The birth itself was mildly traumatic, but that’s a whole other story. She’s the best baby ever (tied, of course, with my first, who’s equally awesome).

3) Guys, I think I’m in an abusive relationship.

lol, no shit, right?

But honestly, I didn’t recognize it as abuse at the time. So many of you reached out with resources about narcissistic and other forms of abuse, and I was deep in denial that it could be happening to me. Now that I’ve learned more about what it looks and feels like, I’m not so sure anymore.

Our relationship is not happy, and parenting with this man is exhausting. I’m doing what I can to preserve the relationship and protect my kids, but I truly don’t know how this story ends. I see a therapist when I can afford it, we go to couples counseling when it’s logistically possible, and I’m slowly working toward being self-sufficient in case it’s not safe to stay (anyone got leads on online employment for sociology grads?).

I’m being intentionally vague because I’m a real person going through this in real time, doing my best for myself and my incredible children. Please remember that.

I’m deeply grateful to everyone who helped me realize that I’m allowed to ask for help. In some ways, I’m doing better than ever. My confidence is slowly building back up, for one thing. But honestly? Life with this man is miserable right now. At least I can laugh about it, kind of.

A lot of people in the original comments condemned me for having children with him. Trust me, I beat myself up for that almost every single day. But at the same time… I don’t know. Maybe some of you haven’t had much personal experience with abusive relationships or toxic people?

Believe it or not, I’m not just some bumbling idiot who decided to make everyone’s life miserable and let some guy walk all over me. I met a man who, by all appearances, was my perfect match and it really felt that way for years and years into our relationship. Then things started to change.

Abusers are good at what they do. If it were always obvious, you wouldn’t see it happening so often, and it wouldn’t destroy so many people’s lives the way it does.

I still love him very much. I think I was overly permissive with him and brushed things aside or ignored early red flags because I have a high level of understanding and optimism, and I always want to see the best in people (sometimes, obviously, to my detriment). Just the kind of person who makes a perfect abuse victim, you say?! He is still dealing with the trauma of his own childhood abuse, but I’m slowly learning that it’s not my job to own that.

But that’s enough! That's none of your business! What I’m trying to say is that people and relationships are complex, and it would all be a little easier if we looked out for each other with love and support. Don’t fall into the typical Reddit black-and-white thinking. Touch grass, as they say.

To everyone who reached out with kindness or empathy - thank you. You helped me start to see myself and my situation more clearly. I still have a long and hard road to walk on, but it might have taken me years to get to this point on my own, so I truly appreciate you. Sending a little DM or leaving a little comment probably took you all of 15 seconds, but I want you to know it had a profound impact on me that will hopefully lead to positive change. That kindness be rippling and radiating, baby. Keep doing what you're doing.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I remember you! I also remember how infuriated I was FOR you when I read your original post.

First, congratulations on the baby!!!

Second, I'm so sorry you are where you are. If hypocritical things like what he did with telling everyone about the baby are common, I can only imagine how much worse things must be for you.

You CAN get out of this. It sounds like you're already making plans. Keep going. Keep working towards getting out. What kind of things are holding yoh up on this?

> **OOP:** you're so sweet, thank you. There are a few tricky interconnected factors, to be honest.
> 
> I'm a stay at home parent in an increasingly high cost of living area, and I've been out of the workforce for 3+ years so my employability isn't ideal. The job market where I am is trash... even recent grads are struggling to find full time work in their field. Housing/rental costs are also outrageously inflated. If I were to start working, childcare centers in my area are all full with wait lists that are months or years long. It's rough out there, I'm sure I don't need to tell you. As an aside, imagine how this dynamic works in favour of a toxic person!
> 
> It's not impossible, but it's also not easy to just get up and get out.
> 
> I'm deeply happy and fulfilled to be able to parent my children full time... it's what I always dreamed of and in a way, for the time being, it helps me shield my kids and keep an eye on things while I work on preserving my relationship with my husband... or deciding whether I want to preserve it. Now that my baby is getting a little more predictable, I'm looking into ways to increase my employability and income potential in case I end up needing to support us alone. :) Happy to answer any more questions you have.

**Commenter 2:** At least in my state, the state hires SAHMs looking to reenter into the work force. See how your state hires. Maybe it uses a civil service list. See what kind of jobs for which you’d be qualified (social work for example with your state’s Department of Labor, Office of Family Services, Department of Ed, Mental Health, Addiction Services, Office for people with developmental disabilities, Department of Health, etc.).

The pay isn’t ever great, but the benefits are usually unparalleled, as is the work life balance.

> **OOP:** that would be so excellent, love that concept. I'm in Canada and don't know of any such hiring practices, but I can access career counselors who might know more than I do.

**Commenter 3:** So, you may not be able to leave, but please understand, there is nothing you can do to fully protect your kids as long as you stay in an abusive situation. You tacitly tell your daughters that it's ok to be treated badly and your sons that this is what women deserve (when you can other your mother, sister, etc then you can other anyone). I am sorry for what you are going through and if you are in the US then you have fewer resources to work with than ever before. Research places that help abused women with children even if you think it's not that bad. Prep like it might be.

> **OOP:** I am in the early stages of accepting this reality, and I'm observing in myself a lot of very typical abuse patterns (including denial and learned helplessness which is the hurdle I'm trying to get over right now). I appreciate your wisdom and I promise I'm taking the matter seriously and keeping my childrens' safety as my primary concern. Thank you!

**Commenter 4:** It is really rough out there employment wise these days. Keep working towards finding something solid on that front.

Are you safe staying while you work out a plan? What about staying with family or friends to get out faster?

> **OOP:** Physically safe, emotionally is questionable haha. I'm pretty isolated (also, hello typical abuse victim) from friends and I don't have any nearby family members who can accommodate life with two small children.
> 
> I do have my mom as a lifeline, thankfully. She's been my biggest supporter behind the scenes. She recently ended up inheriting a bit of a hoarding situation, but we're slowly working on the possibility of sharing space with her until I can get on my feet. Some gears are turning, at least. Thank you for your insight!

**Commenter 5:** Ok, so for jobs go over to the subreddit r/hiringcafe .

Then for your situation, Google Domestic Exit Plan.

When you get close to leaving, get a small storage unit, put out of season clothing, personal documents (or a bank safety deposit box), family heirlooms, and anything you don’t want to “lose”. If he questions you, your spring cleaning, clothes don’t fit, your donating stuff, etc.

Safety should be a big concern, because when they find out you’re leaving or filing for divorce, things can escalate and get violent quickly.

Pack a GO Bag for you and each child (backpack with some clothing, a favorite toy, meds, and a spare car key for you) and put it under a bed, a friend’s home, a locker at the bus station. That way if things go sideways unexpectedly, you can run.

Stay safe & good luck

> **OOP:** Thank you! I've been putting together an exit plan like this with my therapist just in case, but I have no immediate intention to follow through with it yet. It's extremely empowering just to know that it's an option if the shoe drops.

**Commenter 6:** Has he at least acknowledged how hypocritical he was being or is it still all about him in his eyes?

> **OOP:** no, never acknowledged it. Water under the bridge from his end.

1p0ymc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEatsDrivers/comments/1p0ymc7/things_ive_learned_long_post/,Things I've Learned (Long Post),"I've done UE for  2 years so I missed the really good days of before. I see a lot of post complaining and I want to share tips that I utilize to get the most out of the app.

1) If you don't have to do UE don't because they have every way imaginable to fk you.

2) Don't sign up for the $1 etc boosts per hr. They will only send really crappy orders, you are paying to work for them.

3) Don't do the hourly rate; I never have and I've learned that anything that APPEARS to help you actually fks you.

4) Accept 1 of  the 3 orders that they send when you first log on or they will not send you orders at all, or only once per -hour if that.

5) Know your area; which days do you make the most, which times, what time of the month, what time of the day, which areas, etc

6) The worst orders are at the beginning of the month, bc people who can't really afford to order are ordering. Same for Fridays.

7) If you aren't getting orders you want to accept, take the break (pit stop/coffee break) and when it asks to resume requests, accept. Drive to another location.

8) Know where in your market to drive to pick up offers. If you sit in one spot you will not get orders. I may sit for 5 to 10 mins then drive down the highway (bc I always get orders). But if I sit in one space, either I won't get orders or I will get a crap order every hour.

9) I have a 97% satisfaction rate. I always leave ""At door, enjoy""  as a note and am genuinely nice when I drop off my orders (it's the saleswoman in me).  So I think that has contributed to me getting thumbs up.

10) Don't reject orders, just wait until it leaves your screen. If I reject they either send the same crap order multiple times or send similar orders, or stop sending me orders altogether.

11) UE has made it difficult (Like GrubHub) to complete promotions. So sometimes you have to take that $5 order for 3 mi. Look at it as $6/ 3 mi if it is a $2 for 2 orders promo.

12) Don't accept Walmart orders. Never have, never will, and I have seen too many horror stories on this app (Reddit)

13) If you have a college town near by Uber there because even if the area you deliver in isn't the waelthiest there are students there from places that have higher cost of living so you may get a $19 order for 2 mi because they are still tipping like they are at home.

14) Take screenshots of orders especially  leave at door orders,  in case order is stolen after you drop it off or customer lies.

15) If an order looks too good to be true it normally is and is stolen. But you can accept, call restaurant to see if it has been picked up and then cancel. If your cancellation rate is high then just don't accept, I'm telling you it's normally stolen. 9xs out of 10.

16) Same as number one don't fkin deliver for UE unless you have to. From my experience and from the posts I have seen here, WE are working for them at slavery rates, if that. Save yourself the worry and depression and put your energy into things that bring you a positive return on your investment whether that's your job or other streams of income.


What do they say ""thanks for coming to my Ted talk"" or something like that.

Wait there's more:

17) If there is a lot of traffic in the area and UE sends that text about you're not moving, when you accept orders, exit out -minimize not exit- the app then when you get to the restaurant go back in. This has helped me bc I think it's my old phone the app doesn't show me traveling even though I am so I normally do this with every order or UE will say I am not moving and take the order.

18) Don't accept an order unless you are dropping off one or about to, bc of the reason above UE will take your order bc of traffic -they literally did me like this today and after 2 mins in traffic AND after saying ""oh there's traffic. They  texted me and said I wasn't moving then took the order only after 5 mins of accepting.

19) Be nice to the people in the restaurants it will work out in your favor.

20) Try to only accept orders that you want. If you accept less than $2/mi they will continue to send you less. If you accept stacked orders they will continue to send you stacked. Matter fact fk stacked orders bc I'm not delivering to non- tipping ssa people.



If you have anything you have learned that's not mentioned please share. Other than that fk UE, seriously, with no vasoline.",3,1763528387.0,UberEatsDrivers,6,1.0,False

But then you see the man who breaks down at the airport ; shoulders shaking, eyes red, trying so hard to look “fine” because he was raised to believe tears make him weak.

What about the man who stays awake the whole night while you travel, telling you “text me when you reach,”
but not telling you that he won’t sleep until he sees that message?

What about the men who don’t speak poetry,
but remember your coffee order,your favourite side of the bed,
the way you take your dosa or how you like your hair on bad days?

What about the men who struggle to say “I miss you,”
so they show up with flowers,
or send you reels,
or write letters they rewrite again and again
because vulnerability is still something they’re trying to learn?

And what about the men who hold your hand in the dark ; 
not because they think you’re scared,
but because they are terrified of how much they feel,
and holding your hand helps steady the storm inside them?

We say men don’t know how to love.
But so many of them are loving through fear,
through pressure,
through all the softness the world told them to bury.

So here’s to them 
the men who try,
who struggle,
who care deeply but quietly,
who love without expecting applause.

To the men who never get appreciated, who rarely hear “you’re doing enough,”
to you: we see you, we feel you, and we are truly proud of you.

1p0yjfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1p0yjfc/hr_dawn/,[HR] Dawn,"John drove a tree harvester, and he was one of the best. With reliable draggers and loaders, he could clear the wildest acre you’ve ever seen in an hour, tops. He was so fast his boss had to buy another skidder and hire another operator just to keep up. The new guy, Greg, came up sick that Sunday morning. It was a two-hour drive to the worksite from town, and since John was already in the woods, he decided to clear out a stage half a mile from the loader with the remainder of last week’s fuel.

As he clamped the harvesting head down on a cluster of young, understory hardwoods, something small and white out his left window grabbed his attention. It looked like a toddler, and he thought it might be naked. John shut off the machine. With his gaze locked on the thicket into which he saw the little body scamper, he hopped down to the forest floor. John broke the heavy quiet with a call,

“Hello?”

There was no response. He stepped a little deeper into the woods.

“I’m not gonna hurt you. Sorry if my tractor scared you.”

He saw movement of the figure about thirty yards ahead, just a glimpse, but easy to register against the dark green.

“Hey!”

He quickened his stride, more confident that he wasn’t chasing down a hog. The boy couldn’t have been more than four years old, with a large head, shaggy dark hair, a plank-like chest and thin limbs. He was naked and dirty, dry mud on his feet and scraps of bark in his hair. With his big head in his hands, the child was crouched down and totally silent, like a fawn hiding in the grass.

“Hey there,” John said as softly as he could through his shock, “where is your momma and daddy? Are you okay?”

John pushed through the twiggy thicket of undergrowth. The little boy didn’t move until John touched his bony shoulder.

He looked up at John and said, “You found me.”

“Yes, I did, big man. I found you. Where is your momma?”

The child stood naked as a fish and squarely pointed West into the forest. John swallowed dryly.

“Are you lost?”

The kid didn’t answer.

“Do you know how to get back home?”

The kid was silent. John squinted westward. The sun had passed its zenith, and the view was overexposed. He could see no sign of a parent.

“Your house is that way?”

The little boy nodded and pointed again.

“Over there,” he said.

“Do you need me to help take you home?”

The boy put his hands up in the air with the universal ‘pick-me-up’ gesture.

“You can’t be buck-naked out here. Will you wear my shirt?” he asked and removed the garment. The t-shirt was a gown on the boy’s small frame, but it helped John to feel more comfortable holding him.

“What’s your name, kid?”

“Worm.”

“Alright then.”

The child smelled like sweat and dirt, and John thought the boy’s weight felt familiar in his arms. He hadn’t carried his daughter in years. There had been a last time, and he hadn’t noticed it. He could barely remember her face now.

The forest was old, untouched. The high, craggy hills drained broken sandstone into valleys that bottomed out in smooth ravines. It was dry this time of year, before the leaves start to turn tiger orange and magenta on the gravelly slopes, so the streams were empty.

John’s arms and back were getting tired. He’d been unable to see the harvester for at least an hour when he looked back. He stopped at a dry creek bed on a hillside studded with hickory to rest on the flat rocks that lined it. John put the child down.

“Gimme a minute,” he said, “How did you get all this way without your momma, boy?”

John wasn’t yet convinced the boy had a mother, but he wouldn’t feel right giving up this soon. It could only have been an hour and a half. The sun was getting low on the rolling horizon, the trees and stony outcrops becoming black silhouettes against the green and orange sky, when John first spotted the homestead.

There in a wide valley among a thin gathering of pines was a run-down, mobile home. John’s tension rushed out, and he noticed how tired he was. It felt like coming home.

“There it is! You were right, Worm!”

The little boy gave a shy smile. He seemed relieved as well.

There were no powerlines and no roads or vehicles anywhere nearby. The trailer was simply there: a few cinderblocks stacked up to the front door, some of its red shutters intact, some broken. The ground was nearly bare around the home, swept of the low-growing sweet bay and buckeye and punctual chunks of weathered limestone. There was algae and liverwort growing on the yellowed vinyl siding, and no light coming from within.

He thought there was no chance they had plumbing. John put the child down, put one foot on the lowest step, leaned in, knocked hard twice, and realigned.

“Hello? Anybody home?”

He waited.

“I found a little boy out here.”

Just as he moved to knock again there was a shudder in the singlewide, and the front door opened.

“Oh, my goodness! Is that my little Worm?”

The woman choosing her way down the cinderblock steps had waxy red lipstick, and heavy eye shadow that faded carefully from black to green. She held a long, thin cigarette which drew pale lines in the atmosphere around her head. She eyed the placement of her stiletto heels as she descended from the doorway, holding his arm for support. John was briefly stunned by the young woman. Although garish, he couldn’t help noticing how pretty she was.

“Miss, I found him running around our logging site about two miles thataway.”

He pointed back East. She held her palms up and seemed to dance in short steps toward the boy. The child made little movement, immobilized by John’s t-shirt which dragged the bare earth like a long dress.

“Baby, what were you doing way out there? I was worried to pieces!”

“He was naked and alone on the other side of those hills there. Must have taken him hours to get that far. It took me since early this afternoon to get him back.”

The woman took a drag off her cigarette and fussed with the boy’s hair.

“Lord, you must think I’m a terrible mother.”

“No, no, I’m not passing judgement on anyone, miss, I was just trying to understand how a boy his age could get that far out without nobody knowing.”

“I am so sorry,” she lilted, “I can’t stand it either.”

She tapped her cigarette.

“Thank you so much for bringing him home safe and sound. Is this your shirt?”

She pulled the dirty t-shirt over the boy’s head and looked John over with it in her hand. John could feel his blood pressure rising.

“Miss, what’s your name? I’m tempted to call the police. If you had been looking for him I could let this go, but I’m not sure you even knew he was gone.”

The young woman pursed her full lips and her eyebrows dropped. She tossed him the shirt.

“My name’s Dawn if you wanna call ‘em. I wouldn’t expect ‘em to come all the way out here for a boy safe at home with his momma, though. I’m sorry you got caught up in this.”

She was probably right, John suspected. His indignation dissolved when he remembered that all he had to do was walk back to his harvester, and all this weird, hillbilly shit would go away. He had his own life to worry about. She saw his shoulders and jaw slacken, and he put his shirt on, shaking his head.

“I love my baby. I really do. I’m just busy, and I can be forgetful. That’s no excuse, I know, but he’s a good boy, and he adores being out in the woods. Thank you, again. I mean it.”

The evening light had dimmed to a glow behind the pines. A cool breeze from the East carried the smell of their needles, sweet and clean. John was ready to leave.

“Could you use some water or something to eat before you head back?”

John wasn’t going to ask, but he did need water. He wasn’t even sweating anymore. He didn’t know how long the hike back to the cut site would be, but at least he wouldn’t be carrying a thirty-five-pound kid.

John nodded his head.

“I would appreciate some water, miss.”

“Well of course! It’s the least I can do for bringing my baby home. Please come inside.”

Dawn had picked the boy up and took one cinderblock step at a time, resetting at each landing. She had already crossed the threshold when John felt the impulse to decline. He stood before the steps, trapped by indecision. He considered turning around and walking back into the darkening forest, but the trek back wouldn’t be easy.

The mobile home had power. John did not remember any lines strung up around the trailer. The miniature foyer opened onto a den in front of him and a vinyl-floored kitchen to his left. Yellow bulbs without covers to diffuse the light washed the space with murky incandescence. A brown ceiling fan turned slowly above a low coffee table in the middle of the den. There was no television set, which made the home feel incomplete, without center.

Dawn’s open-toed heels tapped on the hollow floor as she moved around the kitchen to fill a glass at the kitchen sink. John did not see the boy.

“It’s still getting so hot during the day, but the nights are cooling down now. I hope walking him home wasn’t too much of chore.”

“It was no trouble,” John lied politely.

She handed him the glass, and he drank deeply. He asked for a refill and he, again, considered how difficult plumbing a house way out in the secluded hills would be.

“So, are you on a well? I didn’t think they’d run water lines out this far.”

“Oh yeah, there’s a well somewhere around here. My brother keeps up with it. I don’t even know where it’s at.”

“And the electricity?”

Dawn hesitated with the glass as she handed it to him.

“Yes, there’s a generator or something up the hill behind the house. I don’t deal with all that. I’m sure you can tell that from one look at me,” she laughed.

“What’s your brother do? Seems pretty handy.”

John watched her turn away and head for a plaid green sofa in the den.

“So!” she piped, “Would you like to sit down a minute? I could make you dinner if you want. You must be so tired.”

John drained the second glass, feeling uneasy.

“No, thank you. I really gotta get back.”

The kitchen window showed the remnants of the day, burnt orange on the tree line. The interior reflections were sharply captured on the grimy glass.

“It’s getting so dark out there, and the fog will be rolling in soon. I wish I had flashlight to lend you.” Her tone was pleading, overly saccharine.

“Thank you for the water, miss.” He smiled warmly. John headed for the door, staying as far the from the couch as he could. Dawn stood abruptly.

“You could get lost in all those trees out there.”

“I’m used to the woods. I think I can manage.”

“That’s right! Conqueror of the forest.” She walked nearer to him.

“But, you know,” she swallowed with effort, and her voice became small in the foyer, “you could stay the night if you wanted.”

John’s eyebrows shot up.

“That’s…very kind of you, but I really need to get back. It won’t take me long to find the cut site.”

John wanted to lie about needing to get home to his wife or girlfriend, which he didn’t have, but the lie wouldn’t come. He felt for the doorknob while keeping her gaze.

“I don’t mean to be too forward. You could take the couch if you want. I don’t get visitors very often,” she reached up and cupped her tender neck, “It can get so lonely out here without company.”

This was not the first time John had been prospected, if that’s what it was, but never without abundant overture. He had returned her lost child; did she see this as some form of reciprocation? Dawn was young and beautiful, and she gave him a soft, hungry look.

“It is getting pretty dark,” he said.

Shame and disbelief met John when he awoke on Dawn’s bare mattress. The double paned window told of no light from outside. He could hear the soft, woody hoot of an owl somewhere off in the forest. The room smelled of cigarettes and human toil, and the air was still. John covered his mouth and squeezed his eyes shut as he pieced together the evening.

No sooner than he had accepted Dawn’s invitation, she closed the distance between them and placed a hand on his chest, drawing him first to the den couch, musty and humid. She had undressed with precision, revealing a lithe figure, pale and without blemish. In each moment, John ignored the imperative to flee into the night.

He had checked the room repeatedly for any sign of the boy, Worm, promising to himself that if he saw the child he would end it and leave, but he never showed up. John was alone with his lust and self-hatred and the touch of warm skin writhing on top of him. Dawn bit him, and he knew he would find bruises the next day. She clawed his back and arms, and, once in her mostly empty bedroom, wrapped around him like a vine starved for light.

John felt for her in the bed, but he was alone. He could tell he hadn’t been sleeping long; he needed more rest, but the morning was still in a future he couldn’t imagine greeting in this house. He needed to leave.

John found his clothes on the floor and dressed quietly. The den was dark, the kitchen as well. It was silent throughout the house. John went to the sink to get a last swallow of water, anything to dilute the taste of Dawn’s cigarettes, but the faucet yielded nothing. Not a drop. He felt along the walls and found the light switch. It, too, gave nothing. John cursed through his teeth and made his way to the front door. Once in the foyer, blindly searching for the doorknob, he stepped on something firm and round. He felt the object roll and jerk under his boot. The snake hissed like the first shot of hot air from a garden hose baked in the sun.

A cry burst from his lips. He tore out the door, clearing the shoddy steps, and felt the cool night air on his face as he ran into the forest fog glowing in the moonlight.

The sky was cloudless, so he kept the North Star to his left. John slowed to a walk as he sought the dry creek bed, his only landmark. A din of crickets or treefrogs seemed to form a membrane around him and was not modulated by his pace or head movement as he bobbed around the thin branches of eager understory. Time only seemed to pass when he stopped to adjust his course, but the high, white moon locked overhead was a lidded eye mocking his progress.

The broad, flat rocks forming the western edge of the creek bed shone dim powder blue before him. John guessed he was about halfway. He felt like he’d stood on this exact rock in another life, and the events of the last twelve hours fluttered through him. He could not place them in the stream of his life without turbulence. John had to move on.

An hour passed. The trees looked all the same. Coyotes yipped and wailed from no direction he could discern, but an occasional stir of gravel nearby made him pray that he had not gained their attention. John felt sure he should have found the harvester by now.

Something caught his boot, a root or stone, and he tumbled into a hole, shuddering as his face ploughed into the dirt. Searing pain tore through his chest and neck. He missed two breaths before he rolled over, and when he managed to sit up, his right shoulder sagging under its own weight, he saw that he had found the hollow channel of the creek bed once again.

Confused, tired, and with tsunami waves of pain spreading from his shoulder, John began to weep. He searched with his left hand and found that his collar bone had snapped. He could feel a sharp point trying to escape his skin.

From down in the sandy bed, John looked up over the cliff-like bank and saw the boy standing naked on the flat rocks, pale and lambent in the star-wash.

Worm stood over him like the prophet of a new god, an inevitability.

John smeared the muddy teardrops from his face.

“Worm?”

“I found *you* this time,” the boy said. John could hear him smiling.

“Worm, I need your help. I don’t know how to get back. I don’t—. Do you remember where my tractor is? Where I found you yesterday?”

“I remember.”

John heard the churn of soil in the bed below him. Slow and intentional.

“Who’s there?”

A second voice came from the dark, small and familiar in a way that froze his lungs.  
“Do you remember us?”

He grabbed a thick root jutting from the bank and hauled himself upright, heart thudding. A face the size of a fist peered around a hickory trunk. Another blinked from the shadows under a limestone eave. More shapes gathering. Quiet as moss.

“What is this?” John rasped, “Where is your mother? Where’s Dawn?”

“I’m here, John.”

She came down the slope barefoot, a long nightgown the color of moonlight dragging through the leaves. Her belly was round as a boulder, heavy and low, as if the weight inside were pulling her forward. Her eyes were bright with terrible knowing.

“Let me go,” he said backing away, but the words collapsed in his throat. “I don’t want any part of this.”

“John,” she sighed, “you always come back.”

Something flickered in John’s mind—his own voice reverberating in a dark room, Dawn’s hand on his face, the same hand, the same room, echoing like seasons across time. There was no path back to the world he came from. He knew it.

Another child stepped out from behind the tree. Then another from the creek bed. Then another, lucent shapes blooming out of the shadow, one by one. They ringed him quietly, watching. The children—those pale, quiet things—with his eyes, his lips, his empty hands.",2,1763528129.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1p0yh0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/zoloft/comments/1p0yh0j/feeling_lost_on_what_to_do/,Feeling lost on what to do,"I have struggled with IBS for the past 5 years, which is triggered big time by anxiety. My PCP suggested Zoloft to manage the trigger and help with the IBS - started me on 50mg. First 2-3 weeks were very rough - definitely helped with my IBS symptoms, but had awful nausea, lack of appetite, dizziness, fatigue, etc…I lost 10 pounds in two weeks. 

Then - boom - many of these side effects started to subside, and I felt AMAZING. Less anxious for sure, happier, less food noise, still kind of tired. Life looked pretty good. 

Fast forward to ~8 week mark - I am at work and all of a sudden, I got VERY hot, dizzy, nauseous, and anxious; heart rate spiked during this episode. I had to lay down on my office floor until the worst was over and then take a sick day. It was truly scary - I couldn’t even sit upright in a chair. 

After some digging, I realized this was probably due to an interaction with stimulants and taking without food - I’ve been a heavy coffee drinker for about 25 years, and am on the nicotine patch for quitting (was ~14mg). 

Cue the goddawful caffeine withdrawal, which has mostly passed - about 10 days out from that drop. Still noticed HR spikes randomly, which I connected to the patch. Dropped patch dose as well (7mg). 

I also asked my Dr to drop my dose to 25mg about a week or 2 ago. After the bad dizzy spell, I didn’t take the drug for a day or so, and gradually felt much better. After restarting the 25mg, noticed (again) bad fatigue and still a ton of heat sensitivity exacerbated by stimulants. Even chocolate. Decaf coffee was making me drenched with sweat. I dropped to 12.5mg myself in the last few days which has helped a little based on early report (it does seem NOT taking it now results in soul crushing morning anxiety again…) I am still constantly tired though, and it’s affecting my ability to work during a period where I am in crunch mode big time. 

I don’t know if this is the drug for me - I desperately want it to work, as the IBS left unattended is pretty bad in a different way. I also work in a pressure cooker type of job that I’m not in a position to leave right now (and despite the pressure, there are things about my work I truly love). But these side effects are rough on me - I had similar reactions to Lexapro. And I LOVE COFFEE SO MUCH - decaf is just not the same. I was on Wellbutrin for years and did well on it, but I suspected that was contributing to my IBS problem so had to stop it. 

I feel so lost and frustrated, my body is clearly in revolt from all of the substance changes within the past month, and my Dr is well meaning but I can’t get back in to see her for another 3 weeks. Anyone have any words of support/advice??

1p0ygiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1p0ygiu/outoftheblue_dumped_over_text/,Out-of-the-blue dumped over text,"Sorry this is long.

I 29M started seeing this girl 25F off hinge. Hit it off after the first date, I had been newly single and took two months to make sure I was ready to meet other people after a relationship where I was abused and cheated on. Needless to say I was ready and happy to meet new people and completely over the past. 

Something to note:
I had dealt with depression for 5 years, and hit rock bottom at the end of my last relationship. But, after contemplating suicide after getting cheated on. I regained my self esteem and self worth. And I really truly have been feeling better than I ever have over the past 5 years of being depressed. I am in a great spot mentally and the most physically fit I have ever been.  

So, I get on hinge, chat with a bunch of really nice and beautiful women. Then set up a few dates. I go on one that just doesn’t work out, we just weren’t interested in eachother and that’s okay.

Then I go on another date with this girl K. It goes really well, we go for coffee and then walk around town for 2 extra hours just chatting. She seems to be really interested in me.
I follow up and say I had a great time and would like to see her again. After that, I cancel my dates with other women because I’m not the type to have multiple people on the go. 

We go on another date, things go well again. And we walk around again after drinks for a couple hours. So, more than a regular quick date and go. It feels natural and bf/gf material. 

We then start texting all day every day just shooting the shit and joking around. We share a Spotify blend thing and everything seems to be going well.

I go see her at her place where she’s dog sitting and I stay over we have sex and the chemistry is so great. 
One thing to keep note of is that I told her I might not be able to last that long because I hadn’t had sex for two+ months since I ended things with my ex. 

We have sex again later in the night things are going well from my perspective.

I’m leaving in two days for a trip. But I forgot my headphones at her place so I go back to get them. She has a bunch of friends over, I come over and hangout with them for a while. We joke around, they leave. She asks me to stay. She says it was a test and I passed. her friends like me and that’s really good. I stay over we have sex again, we chat all night, she’s excited to talk to me and says how much she likes that I’m there for her, that I’m choosing her and that I’m present. She says she’s had issues with guys in the past not wanting a relationship and just wanting sex. 

Another thing to note: She said she was dating a guy who she really liked but he was cheating on her with his ex girlfriend.

I leave for my trip after getting no sleep because we stayed up all night talking and being excited to spend time together.

We continue to text all day every day while I’m away. I’m updating her on my trip. She’s telling me she misses spending every night together since we spent two nights in a row together.

I come back we’re texting every day. I stay over one night, she shows me her favourite show. We laugh and cuddle and joke around the whole time. I go to work and we chat again all day.

We keep chatting like we’re are bf/gf the rest of the week.

I then have a sporting thing a few days later. But I go and stay at her place that night. We stay up chatting and then go to bed. 

I work from home the next day and she said I can just stay at her place to work: she’s a nurse so she had the day off. So, I’m working while she’s hanging out/napping/watching shows. She makes me breakfast. We spend all day together we cuddle and joke around and chat while I’m working. I order us lunch we eat together and hang out, then I finish work. We have sex a couple times and I realize I have to go to a family dinner which I forgot about. She had to go to an outing with her friend anyway.

So we say bye and plan on her coming to see my new place the next day.

We text all night and we text the next day. 

Before she’s about to come over she texts me essentially this.

“Hey I’ve been thinking about this for a while and I don’t feel you reciprocating the connection as much as I want. I wish you the best. Can you leave my mug on your doorstep for me to pick up sometime this week”

I’m baffled. She told me she thinks I’m super attractive; likes how good I am to her, that I’m committed to her, says I treat her right, we have the same values and beliefs.

So I’m upset and I ask her why she feels that way.

She says it’s because I mention exes too much and it made her feel uncomfortable like I’m living in the past and not emotionally available.

I’m again baffled because if I did talk about my exes it was just me being open about some experiences like a trip in Europe or when we went on a date close to my exes house I said how I got pulled over for the first time because I didn’t know there was a no-turn sign at one spot. So, nothing out of the ordinary or like I’m constantly reminiscing about things I did in past relationships.

She mentions I was “thinking about my ex the first time we had sex” 

when I said that I might not last long in bed because it’s been multiple months since I’ve had sex. 
For me that was saying, hey I don’t sleep around, I took the time to get over my ex before being in the situation to date again, and meet you. So I don’t want to ruin the moment by ending it quick. 

But she took it the totally opposite way and thought I was thinking about my ex during.


So all in all she told me she felt I wasn’t emotionally available and reciprocating the connection:

When in reality I was honestly in love with this girl and fully all in with the relationship. She appreciated how attentive I was, she told me I wasn’t really good to her, she told me I was super attractive, she liked how I was a great communicator etc..

So I was so confused:

I took some time to think about it. And then I decided to write her a handwritten letter apologizing for how I made her feel and I felt awful about making her feel like I wasn’t available because I was fully in love with her. And I said if you’re ever interested in giving it another shot, I could show her how things would be different.


I left it with a rose at her place 5 days after I got dumped over text.

No reply.

4 days later I text her asking if she received the note I left her; not pressure to answer, it was just windy that night so I was worried it blew away.


She answers a few hours later saying.

Hey I got the note, I have no interest in continuing any form of communication. Please don’t come to my house. I wish you well but respect my boundaries and my space. 

So I am just perplexed at how this went down.

I received so much affection and care and honesty from her. She was so nice and seemed to really like me. I put in a lot of effort because she said she liked that I did that. And then she dumps me cold turkey over text and says to never communicate with her again.

I’m so hurt.

I know if she was the right person for me she would have communicated her insecurities with any “ex talk” before bottling it up inside to a point where she decided she didn’t want the relationship any more.

But just for her to act like my girlfriend then pull the rug from under me has left me questioning everything.

I have gone to therapy about this and thought about it and I guess she just wasn’t that interested. But she acted so differently until the dumping.

I’ve just never been so misinterpreted and experienced such a lack of communication from someone before, and then shut out in such a cold way.

So I’m just looking for help on how to cope with this experience. Because it’s really taken a toll on my mental health and it’s really put me back into a depressive state which I haven’t experienced for months.

I feel like I communicated with sincerity and love (without saying love) and I really feel bad for mentioning my past relationships because I really truly was invested only in her and I saw a future with her.

What do you think of this situation? I know I can’t do anything else and I need to move on. But, I’m just having a really hard time letting go.

I know I just need to have a better outlook on relationships because I will always put my best effort and commitment into someone I feel strongly about. But, I need to also accept the fact that sometimes they just won’t be interested.

This was a 5 week relationship that started fast and ended faster. 

Also, what do you think about her actions? Was I just misreading everything and being naive? What could I have done differently? (Other than never mentioning an ex no matter what the situation before sex)

Do you think she’ll ever reconsider the relationship?

1p0yf2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hashimotos/comments/1p0yf2a/chronically_puffy_eyes/,Chronically Puffy Eyes,"About six months ago, I started waking up with really puffy eyebags. They are not genetic and seemed to appear out of the blue. I have tried everything: caffeine creams, lymphatic massages, cold compresses, masks, dandelion tea / pills, sleeping with my head elevated, changing detergents, cutting off salt, sauna, etc etc. My usual de-puffing routines that worked in the past aren’t helping at ALL.

The only things that help somewhat are drinking a LOT of coffee, exercise, or just waiting 5-6 hours for them to go down.

All my bloodwork came back normal, including kidneys, liver, iron, etc. I thought maybe my thyroid was the problem, given my additional symptoms of frequent constipation, always feeling cold, extremely brittle and dry hair, irregular periods, brain fog, fatigue, needing 10-12 hours of sleep to feel normal, and very poor memory. However, TSH, T3, T4, and even TPO antibodies came back normal.

The only thing off was an ANA titer of 1:320 with a nuclear dense fine speckled pattern.

I’m waiting for a rheumatologist appointment that is taking forever. 

Could something still be wrong with my thyroid despite my labs? Or has anyone had a similar experience?

I had reconnected with her after maybe 11 months of not talking, we met at a Christmas party and after that we talked but nothing really serious, I thought she was pretty then. Well i texted her a week or so ago and we agreed to get coffee at my favorite cafe that she said she’d never been to. Its a really cute little shop thats not super popular and even has a generic name, I got there 30 minutes early because i was nervous and I wanted to wait for her. When she walked in it was a little awkward but she was easy to talk to, we had our share of awkward pauses but we kept talking and she wasn’t rushed out at all, she got a iced chai and I got a hot mocha, (I paid, whatever, not important) we had really good conversation and I felt like we connected. Shes an incredible girl and maybe one day I’d marry her. Shes was that good. We agreed on a lot of deep things. and we were hanging out for like almost 2 1/2 hours. Shes also beautiful, her eyes actually had sparkle in them and I didnt want to look away it was addicting, of course I did to not be creepy. We had a good time and she hugged me afterwards before she left. (unprompted) She had just gotten out of a relationship that was probably her first, she told me it took her a while to get through the emotional distress, but she said that she’d been feeling better about it recently. I texted her tonight to tell her that I had fun and we should do it again, she said the same. But then I asked her out to dinner for a real date and she sent me this

“I'd be okay with that but I'd really like to keep things as friends for now until I feel fully ready to date again. It's nothing about you like I think you're actually so great but I just need some time for independence like I was saying earlier. I have no problem getting dinner sometime though if you're ok with that.”

I think the first time I’ve ever romantically been attracted to a girl and didn’t have to settle for looks. She was amazing all around and she even accepts my chivalrous gestures.

flash forward to a couple days ago. my husband and i are having sex and he starts rubbing my clit with his thumb while he’s inside of me, which i normally enjoy, and i started dissociating and had barely enough of my wits about me to grab his hand and pull it away before i started crying. and ever since i haven’t been able to touch myself or even wanted to be touched down there (which is unusual bc i normally have a very high sex drive). even thinking about it has been giving me anxiety…

1p0xzpm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p0xzpm,Please help my puffy eyes,"
Never thought I’d be looking for medical advice on Reddit, but I feel like I’m out of options. I cannot look in a mirror without getting depressed. I would like to cry but I can’t because my eyes will puff up even more. :) 

I am a female in her mid-twenties. About six months ago, I started waking up with really puffy eyebags. Not painful or itchy, just huge heavy bags. They are not genetic and seemed to appear out of the blue. I have tried everything: caffeine creams, lymphatic massages, cold compresses, masks, dandelion tea / pills, sleeping with my head elevated, changing detergents, cutting off salt, etc etc. My usual de-puffing routines that worked in the past aren’t helping at ALL. Every day, I’m waking up with insanely puffy eyes no matter how long I’ve slept. The only things that help somewhat are drinking a LOT of coffee, exercise, or just waiting 5-6 hours for them to go down a bit. 

I went to an allergist and he told me I’m allergic to tree pollens, grasses, and mold. He also said that my turbinates seem to be swollen. I started Dymista (azelastine + fluticasone) and Alavert about two weeks ago but it’s not helping the eyebags even a little. 

All my bloodwork came back normal, including kidneys, liver, iron, etc. I thought maybe my thyroid was the problem, given my additional symptoms of frequent constipation, always feeling cold, extremely brittle and dry hair, irregular periods, brain fog, fatigue, needing 10-12 hours of sleep to feel normal, and very poor memory. However, TSH, T3, T4, and even TPO antibodies came back normal.

The only thing off was an ANA titer of 1:320 with a nuclear dense fine speckled pattern.

I’m waiting for a rheumatologist appointment that is taking forever, but I just had to ask for advice. I am so, so sad. I miss my eyes, my face. 

For reference, the last photo is what my eyes used to look like.

My 6 month old son who was definitely a monkey in his past life is now climbing me like crazy. He just started crawling a few days ago and now all he wants to do is stand. I love him so much but he's been using me as his personal jungle gym for the past week and I'm kinda sorta maybe a little touched out/: 


I ordered a large play pen because he crawls so fast I just cant keep up with him all day, and then the climbing started 🙃 He tries pulling himself up on the coffee table, couch, and laundry baskets but because he's tiny (1% since birth), he can't reach to pull himself up and gets frustrated, so he needs me nearby 24/7. When he climbs me he can stand himself up without me holding him for almost five minutes and he's laughing and having so much fun the whole time.


I'm debating whether to buy him a pikler triangle, modular couch, or foam obstacle course like the tree trunk ones online. I worry about getting him the pikler because he's so young and unaware of his own limitations lol, and I worry about the couch or obstacle course because I'm not sure they'd fulfill his ""climbing"" needs. But at the same time I think he'd have fun crawling at different inclines and over stuff so idk...

Looking for some help choosing my next daily driver and would love real-world feedback from folks who’ve used these.

Use case / context
	•	Need one bag that can:
	•	Go to the office daily
	•	Handle weekend trips / quick flights
	•	Work as an everyday “do everything” backpack
	•	I like sleek and low-profile, nothing too tactical or loud
	•	I’m currently using an older generic backpack that’s… fine, but the organization and comfort just aren’t cutting it anymore

I’ve narrowed it down to:
	1.	Evergoods Civic Travel Bag 26L (or possibly 20L)
	2.	Aer City Pack Pro


What I think I know so far

Evergoods Civic Travel Bag 26/20 (CTB) 
	•	Pros (on paper): I also really like that waxed canvas look 
	•	Supposedly super comfortable harness and great for all-day carry
	•	Looks like it can flex well between EDC and travel
	•	Build quality and materials seem bombproof
	•	Good internal organization, but not overdone
	•	Potential cons:
	•	Might be a little overbuilt / heavy for simple office days?
	•	Curious how it feels in a more “office” environment – does it look too outdoorsy?
	•	Not sure if 26 is too big for true EDC, or 20 too small for light travel

Aer City Pack Pro
	•	Pros (on paper):
	•	Very clean, modern “office-ready” aesthetic
	•	Aer’s organization and laptop carry are usually on point
	•	Seems like a great work + tech bag
	•	Potential cons:
	•	Unsure how it does as a travel bag vs just a work bag
	•	Comfort with heavier loads? All-day carry?
	•	Is it too structured/boxy for more casual use?


What I’m carrying most days
	•	14” laptop + charger
	•	notebook
	•	Small tech pouch (cables, mouse, etc.)
	•	Water bottle + coffee mug 
	•	Light layer (hoodie or thin jacket)
	•	Occasional gym clothes or an extra pair of shoes
	•	For weekend trips: 1–2 changes of clothes, Dopp kit, plus the above



What I care about most
	•	Comfort with a full load (office commute + occasional travel)
	•	Laptop protection and easy in/out at the office/airport
	•	Looks – minimal, clean, not screaming “hiking pack” or “gamer tech bag”
	•	Durability – I’m fine paying for quality if it will last years
	•	Usability – zips, pockets, access, how annoying (or not) it is in real life


What I’m asking you all

If you’ve used:
	•	Evergoods Civic Travel Bag 26
	•	Evergoods Civic Travel Bag 20
	•	Aer City Pack Pro

…I’d love to hear your pros, cons, good, bad, and ugly:
	•	What do you love about it?
	•	What actually annoys you after 3–6+ months of use?
	•	How does it do as a single bag for:
	•	Office
	•	Weekend / short trips
	•	General EDC
	•	If you’ve owned both Evergoods and Aer, which would you pick for my use case and why?

Bonus points if you can comment on CTB 26 vs 20 sizing for someone who wants one bag for work + weekend travel.

Thanks in advance – trying to buy once, cry once here, so the more brutally honest feedback the better.",1,1763526120.0,ManyBaggers,0,1.0,False
