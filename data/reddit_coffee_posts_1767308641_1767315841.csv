Suggestions?,"Ok this is a bit of a story. So I recently got out of a long term relationship (5 years) 3 months ago. I’m finding myself in a much better place finally and trying to feel comfortable being single. 

I recently reconnected with a friend I have not seen for 5 years. We where close forever ago and briefly check in every year and a half or so but stopped talking when I got into that serious relationship because we also used to be a casual thing (to young to do anything serious yet, but still enough where it was a real thing). We hung out one night a week and a half ago and I felt a similar tension to years ago but was unsure if it was just her being nice and kind. Then I was invited to a New Year’s party with singing and drinking. Before I even mention a place to stay etc she instantly says I can crash at her place on her blow up mattress in her room. Funky

At the pregame she invited be over earlier to give me the tea on her friend group before they all showed up. Then we played some drinking games   before going to the secondary location(lol). Here the touching got more frequent, hand placement got more deliberate (her lower thigh, my shoulder etc) and the dialogue more flirty even. She blushed super hard when I got her the drink she planned to order and the night went on as we both got pretty drunk. Finally after singing songs together and going about the night, I asked her a few seconds before ball drop and we ended kissing. 

Then… as if nothing happened… it was over and nether of us acknowledge it. For the next 20 minutes it was just in the air(at least for me). THEN 

The large group takes a group photo. 

I stand next to her to take the picture and put my hand on her way to try and catch the vibe. She’s shorter and goes to kneel in the front of the group to allow people in the back to be seen and I take that as “this is not the time for that” and stay standing letting go her waist. She turns around and says “get down here”. When I kneel to join her she grabs my hand and puts it around her waist and holds her hand over it to keep it there. But then finally we leave and again nether acknowledge any of it. We walk home, still flirty and she falls to her back of the group on the phone. Suddenly from the back of the group I hear her best friend scream over the speaker phone “YOU KISSED xxxxx!!” Followed by embarrassed laughter and more ignoring the elephant in the room. 

We get back and talk for 40ish minutes about life and catching up before crashing. The whole time I’m thinking (why don’t I just sit up and say “so are we gonna talk about it?”).

The next morning we get up, chat, go out for breakfast and coffee, and come back and chill before I have to leave… we are hanging out again tomorrow just us. I need a way to break this tension without making her uncomfortable, or it being massively awkward… unless I have no choice. I also want to know that I’m not insane and that there is chemistry here.

ALSO ALSO 

I am leaving for a huge job opportunity for 5 months in 2 days… this would be casual both of us because she has made it clear she is seeing another guy or two but also made it very clear the are extremely casual and not exclusive.",1,1767315705.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1q1ko65,https://www.reddit.com/r/VampireJackSnark/comments/1q1ko65/timeline_update_all_information_that_i_know/,Timeline Update: All information that I know,"I think it might help if I share what info I have. I also want to preface that I'm in no means trying to dox him or anyone he is related to. **All the information I have found is due to him sharing it** (whether that's through his videos or interviews).

From what I have gathered (and I'll share where I've gotten everything from), Jack (not his real name) was a foster kid who never felt like he belonged. He claims he had his ""vampiric awakening"" around the ages of 7-10 years old, but didn't actually research his symptoms until high school. He claims to have had feelings of hunger and aversion to sunlight, but didn't talk to anyone about it. He claims to feed off of people's ""energy"" and recounts a time when he took so much energy from someone that they passed out. I should also mention that sometime before his TikTok career, he was married and had 2 kids. Jack claims he suffered DV from this partner; however, he eventually divorced her and now shares custody with the 2 boys. I'm not too sure as to when that happened and what life was like for him at that time. I'm not too sure if he went to school, had a job, etc. All I know is that he claimed to have ""been in tons of bands"" and briefly worked with John Robert Powers (talent agency). 

The next information I have is regarding how he started TikTok. He originally was a Twitch streamer and would livestream ""Vampire the Masquerade"" (online RPG). This is where ""Jack Townson"" came from, although he did admit that he's always had this character in the back of his mind growing up. He then started making skits on TikTok inspired by his character from VTM. As he slowly started gaining attraction, he began building more of a backstory for his OC. It is also known that he was dating a TikToker called ""Gypsy"" around the beginning of his popularity, but I'm not too sure if they met on TikTok or knew each other previously. It is rumored (or I guess proven) that he left her for Shayne Leighton, whom he met on TikTok. This would've been around 2022-ish (give or take). As fans started pouring in, he invited his ""Fang-Fam"" to create their own characters and tell his story with him. This is inherently not a bad thing whatsoever; I find the whole idea of inviting the public to build a story with you really cool. He also starts publishing books, such as his first poetry book, ""Blood and Roses"". Shayne taught him how to self-publish, and his fans love looking ""into the mind of \[an\] undead bohemian"" who ""found himself trapped in a world of *nightmares"" (Blood and Roses Description).* There's almost a part of me that wants to read this in case it gives info about his past. Anyways, Shayne and Jack began collaborating on TikTok and IRL, including his books, his short films, and his music. Shayne was verymuch the backbone of all of these projects.

Jack did some crowdfunding for these films, and here is where Jack claims he started getting into altercations with Shayne. However, from a viewer's POV, it looked like everything was going great. ""Across the Veil"" was the movie they were working on when Jack dumped Shayne. There were issues with money, filming locations, finding workers, etc. on top of all the pressure from the books, the songs, the TikToks, etc. He says that after ""years and years of fighting"" and ""suffering in silence,"" he just couldn't take it anymore. However, he does claim that they are still good friends. Now, this brings up a question from me: Where did that kick-starter money go?

I do want to talk more about Shayne and Jack's relationship because he was claiming to be in love with her all the way up to September of 2025...which is very strange because about 6 weeks later, he gets engaged to a TikToker named Serena. It is proven that they both were publicly flirting with each other around a month after the breakup. It's interesting because while watching Jack's most recent YouTube video, ""Across the Veil Update & Regarding Shayne"", he admits that he did have a crush on someone while being with Shayne. However, he says that he didn't cheat on her becasue the ""loved the fuck out of Shayne"" (wtf is this guy on about). Shayne's TikTok reposts are public and contain videos about dating narcissists.

 Public comments from Serena to Jack go as far back as May of 2025, and she started dressing more goth in September 2025. They started publicly flirting around a month after the breakup, and it is rumored that she was dropping hints about a secret affair. Serena has taken the role of ""Verona"" in Jack's videos. They have plans of getting married and moving in together.

Now, I've never been on Jack's Discord server before so all the information I'm about to put in are from accounts on Reddit. I would like to thank ""wotanwagner"" and ""MikaAoife88"" for having the bravery of sharing their experiences on this Subreddit. ""wotanwagner"" says that Jack would hyperfixate and control what sort of vampire media they could and couldn't read and would yell at them if they disobeyed his orders. They also claimed that Jack would encourage them to bully people who didn't agree with him and would ghost them unless he needed something from them. He would also get his fanbase/mods to delete or report any criticism he got. Jack would accuse ""wotanwagner"" of copying his content. ""MikaAoife88"" says that Jack would take their ideas from them to use for himself before Shayne came into the picture. (I loved when they said he did this in order to ""fuel his own dying content""...loll). 

From other accounts on here, I have learned that Jack currently lives in a house his father owns. He receives money from his father and does not have a job currently. He still takes donations from his viewers and recently received a pretty penny this Christmas from a viewer.

I would say this is the extent of my knowledge. If there is any information wrong or if you have information to add, please let me know! Also, please know this is a safe space. If you have information or experiences you would like to share, please do! Just know you are strong. Thank you so much for everyone who has responded to this.

Wintered

I know its winter by the cascading thief signs, 

	stealing glances from the bundled arms 

	Hurrying home under the blessing of the streetlight halo



I know its winter by the sirens in the morning,

	red, blue,

		and hazy dawn, 

the scattering of cart wheels as they trample broken glass and cracked sidewalks 

			Forever falling sideways

		The rhythm of frozen hands

			clacking aluminum upon aluminum 

			And glass upon glass

			One bag to the next



I know by the red hats and cauldrons 

	The belly laughs in the snapping wind

		I know its winter by the shivering snore outside my window, 

		a staccato plea to validate its owner's existence



I know its winter by the roses painted firm on hollow cheeks, 

	By the god bless yous 

echoing the skirmish of change in a Styrofoam coffee cup, 

	what was left 

still sticky for the virtue of undeterred protection



		I get it, its a cold world

			Its getting colder by the night

People are hungry

Profits are up



The benches look like an army of pyramids

Glittering ambulance lights across their restraints



	Nothing romantic 

		about sleeping in a doorway

	Nothing poetic 

		about being stepped over in the morning

	Nothing inspiring 

		about a body being kicked out of the way 

	'til the coroner comes

A cautionary tale

for impressionable young Americans

1q1kjqr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1kjqr,First time making coffee kombucha – does this look okay? Possible kahm yeast?,"This is my first time trying coffee kombucha. I followed a recipe I found on TikTok

•	100 g sugar

•	200 g coffee

•	2 liters of water

I mixed everything the night before. The next day (Sunday) around noon, I strained it a couple of times using cheesecloth, then added a SCOBY and about 200 ml of starter kombucha.

Tonight (Thursday) I tasted it. It basically tastes like coffee + kombucha — nothing bad, but nothing amazing either. I guess I don’t know what I was expecting 😅

After looking at other recipes, I’m thinking the sugar might have been too low. I checked the creator’s other videos and in some of them they use up to 240 g of sugar, which is way more than what I used.

I also uploaded a photo because I’m a bit worried it might be kahm yeast. I don’t love the look of those little spheres on the surface.

Does this look okay to you?

Is this normal for coffee kombucha, or should I toss it and adjust the sugar next time?

Hot blasts of wind mercilessly drew sweat down my spine as the sun made a lazy descent into the flat of the horizon. It was a slow day – the kind where the world seemed to wilt, cowering into the shadows and longing for the false promise of a cooler night.

Crumpled in my pocket were cryptic instructions hastily scribbled onto a torn piece of paper.

1. Full Tank
2. Do NOT stop
3. High beams stay on
4. Passenger calls shots

My fingers ached for the familiar weight of a cigarette as I squinted at each car that passed by on the half-forgotten two-lane highway. Gravel crunched under my feet as I paced, wondering if I was in the wrong place. This wasn’t a typical meet point, and the permits were baffling. A continuous service superload with all weigh stations bypassed? No scouting, no communication with the driver, passing off between pilots instead of taking it all the way? When my boss had laid it out, I’d been ready to walk until he slapped the cash down in front of me – enough to keep me from balking at the NDA it came with.

Another truck pulled up that I figured must be the lead. I was running chase, but it was also strange that they pulled us from different companies.

“You here for the trade off?” the other driver asked as he got out, his voice nearly as gruff as the weathered face peering from the shadow of his hat.

“Yea,” I replied, wondering if he had received the same odd requests as I had.

“This shit’s fuckin’ weird,” he muttered, giving me my answer.

“Are you getting a passenger too?” I asked.  

“Sure am, whatever the hell that’s supposed to mean,” he grunted.

No sooner had he spoken than a blacked-out SUV pulled up. I couldn’t quite place the make as men in tactical gear piled out with automatics strapped across their backs. We both balked, looking at each other as they unloaded crates and marched our way.

“Are you the pilot drivers?” one of them asked while the others surrounded our vehicles.

“What the hell are you doing to my truck?” the other driver balked.

“It was in the disclosure,” the man dismissed, eyes devoid of any emotion.

“The fuck it was!” he argued.

“Is there going to be a problem?” the man asked, his voice dropping to a deadly tone.

The driver grew quiet, and I wondered if he was also thinking about the wad of cash that had been quick to shut up my own worries. Even so, my skin prickled as they pulled out massive spotlights and mounted them to the brackets on top of my truck. If it hadn’t been for my boss’s warning to let the ‘passenger’ outfit the truck however they wanted, I’d have been throwing just as much of a fit.

Once satisfied, they filed back into their vehicle and left just as quickly as they’d arrived, save for the two left behind to ride with us.

“Let’s go,” my passenger stated, sliding the automatic rifle from his back and into position.

I fished the keys from my pocket and gave my truck a once over before jumping in. He was quick to situate himself shotgun while I eyed his weapon warily.

“Tank full?” he asked as he fiddled with the radio.

“Yessir.”

He pulled a black bag out. “Put your phone in.”

“What is it?” I asked, my forehead scrunched in confusion.

“Faraday cage,” he said as though it were obvious, thrusting it towards me harder when I hesitated.

With a sigh, I dropped it in and reminded myself that the cash was worth whatever this mess was. He went back to fiddling with the radio until he settled on a static channel before scanning the cabin.

“Dump the coffee,” he demanded, jerking his head towards the cup of thin, black liquid.

“Shit man, I don’t usually do overnights. I was counting on that.”

“Did they tell you nothing?” he snapped.

“Not fucking really,” I shot back. “What’s with all–” I waived my hands towards him, the guns, the lights, “–this?”

“Dump it,” he repeated, not acknowledging my question.

I went ahead and downed it, the acrid taste rolling over the numb from burning myself on the first sips earlier.

“Anything else I should know?” I asked, coughing as I choked down the last of it.

His eyes narrowed. “Stay back 20 feet. No more, no less. We do not stop. The lights never go off. If I say light it up, hit this button,” he pointed to the switch on a wire leading up to the spotlights mounted up top. “No food. No drink. Leave this channel on, do not touch the CB for any non-essential comms.”

“What the fuck are we hauling?” I asked.

“Proprietary material, classified.”

I rubbed my face. It was going to be a long, long night. A buzz sounded at his ear and his face grew deadly serious before he gave a curt ‘copy’ in response.

“Changeout in 15,” he said to me, his eyes hitting the road and never wavering. “Need a smooth transition.”

Changing out pilots at all was baffling, but once again, the cash spoke for itself. When the lumbering form of the semi coming down the road materialized in the hazy distance, I found myself gripping the steering wheel tight. The pilot out front didn’t slow as they cut out, the other driver spinning gravel as he rushed to take his place. My palms began to sweat, and my heart picked up a beat as I did the same. The semi didn’t slow, and I got my first real look as it slid by.

It was at least 16’ wide, 16’ tall, and 160’ long, but I had a feeling it was breaking even superload dimensions. The cab itself was nothing noteworthy but felt… off. The trailer was a flatbed with chains as thick around as my leg wrapped over thick black tarps that looked a lot like the bag I’d tossed my phone into.

“Go go go!” the passenger shouted as the chase fell off, and I hit the gas hard to slid into place.

I ended up too close to the rear as I slid into place, and it was as if my truck guttered. All the needles on my gauges dropped, the lights dimmed, and the engine gave a load hum at the same time the static over the radio cut.

“Pull back! Twenty feet – I said twenty fucking feet!” the passenger yelled, and I slammed the brakes too hard, sending us both jolting.

The tarp shifted, but it was so quick I was sure my eyes were playing tricks on me. That, or it was just the relentless wind.

“I thought you knew what you were doing,” he spat, never tearing his eyes away from the payload.

“Oh, I’m sorry,” I mocked. “It’s almost like non-stop pass offs are a bad fucking idea.”

His jaw worked, but his eyes never strayed from the payload. “Don’t get that close again.”

“Noted,” I mumbled.

It was mind numbing to drive without anything to listen to, and the passenger certainly wasn’t willing to talk. The static ground at my sanity, so I tried to focus on the whoosh of asphalt being eaten up by the tires. Every so often, a gust of wind hit hard enough that it drowned out the rest. Roads were dead, so there wasn’t much to report in terms of traffic, from behind or incoming. The lead occasionally called out a pothole or debris over the radio, but he may as well have been calling into the void for all the communication that came from the truck.

Sunset exploded on the horizon, a bloody spill of bright reds and crackling oranges that seemed impossible against the inky blue drawn in its wake. It was a struggle to pull my eyes from the technicolor canvas when I was certain I’d never seen one so intense before. The awe was quickly snuffed by a disconcerting dread as the world around us faded into only what was lit up by murky headlights. The fallen darkness seemed deeper than usual, not even a gradient of shadows visible, or the blink of stars. It was claustrophobic as my world narrowed to nothing more than the load ahead.

Few cars went by, but each time the passenger tensed until they were well clear of the load. I welcomed the break in the dark monotony, though I felt guilty leaving my high beams on each time it was an incoming passer. Several of the ones who passed us ended up pulled off to the side with their hazards flashing as we made our way down the road. I called to the lead to watch out for road hazards. He swore the road was clear, but something about that made my skin crawl with nerves.

“Quit fidgeting,” the passenger commanded, his eyes still not straying from the truck.

“Can we listen to music or something?” I asked, needing a distraction.

“No,” his voice was stern.

I sighed, the static seeming to grow louder even though I knew it was just in my head. It almost seemed to mock the roughness of the road, patterns uncoiling from the chaos before collapsing and slipping away. Straining, it almost seemed as though the variations were taking a cadence, like far away voices whispering. The words were *right there*, familiar in a way I couldn’t quite place.

“Snap out of it!” the passenger shouted, panic in his voice as his hand clasped my shoulder.

I shook my head, confused, the static nothing more than an annoying buzz in the background again.

“Shit, I’m sorry. I must’ve dozed off or something.”

“Don’t listen to it,” he hissed.

“The static? Kind of hard not to when it’s the only thing to hear.” I said, casting him a sidelong glance.

“Don’t focus on *anything* for too long, especially what’s in front of you.”

“Is that some sort of trick for staying awake?” I asked.

“No.”

“I could really use a cigarette,” I grumbled.

“No consumables,” he said quickly.

“Alright,” I finally snapped. “What’s the deal here? This is fucking weird.”

“If you want to go home after this, don’t ask questions and follow the rules.”

Moving focus around was hard when hyper aware. Every little sound was a welcome escape from the damned static. I tried to bounce around, my eyes going from the load, to the road, to the too dark distance and back again. The chains gleamed in the headlight’s beams, but I got caught on an oddity in the folds of the tarp. It started to suck inwards, vacuuming in on itself so slowly that I found myself squinting at it. Just when I was convinced it must be a trick of the light, I noticed the chain was drawn more taught than before, almost seeming to strain outwards while the folds of the tarp suctioned inwards. The juxtaposition made my eyes swim as though I were seasick.

CLACK-CLACK-CLACK!

My head snapped towards the passenger, the movement making nausea roll in my gut. A device strapped to his wrist that I had mistaken for a watch vibrated as the clacking sound grew more frantic. His eyes widened but didn’t stray from their mark.

“Pull back,” he said in a strained voice.

“But you said–”

“I don’t care what I said, pull back!”

I slammed on the breaks and the clacking cut out. He took a deep breath of relief that made the tension roll off my shoulders that I hadn’t realized I was holding. A small laugh left my lips as I glanced out the windows, seeing the familiar roll of scrub brush under moonlight rather than a wall of suffocating blackness.

“Load secure?” came the distorted voice of the truck driver over the CB.

“Locked down. Just a blip,” the passenger stated, his voice still shaking.

“Is that a dosimeter? This wasn’t labeled as a hazmat haul!” I asked him in anger.

“It isn’t, usually. Shouldn’t happen again,” he said nervously.

“The hell is that supposed to mean?” I argued.

The CB radio buzzed to life again. “Refuel in 45. 10-mile stretch.”

“Copy.”

“I thought you said we weren’t stopping?” I spat.

“Where you told nothing?” he snapped.

“We’ve already established that.”

“A refuel truck will meet us on the double-lane stretch and refill on the move.”

“That’s illegal,” I sputtered.

“Which is why we are doing it at night on the most desolate road in the state. Cops won’t be around anyway.”

“How could you be sure?”

“They won’t be around,” he repeated more firmly.

Prickling sweat made my palms slide over thew wheel as I started to wonder if that money wasn’t worth it after all. My record was clean; I could back out. Word would get out and dry out my contracts for a while, but pilots were always short staffed. The contracts would come back. A record though, that could put me out of the industry when it was all I had ever known,

“You can’t back out,” the passenger said softly.

“I wasn’t thinking about it,” I lied.

“You’d be a fool not to.”

“Then why are you here, if you know how bad this shit is?”

“I don’t have a choice,” he said bitterly.

“Aren’t you a merc? Can’t you pick your contracts?”

“It’s complicated.”

“Well, we could both back out,” I offered half-heartedly.

His eyes continued to bore into the load. “The lights can’t go off.”

“Or what?” I countered.

“You don’t want to know,” he replied with a finality that shut me up.

It would be fine. I could invent a thousand bad endings in my head, but they never came true. This would be no different. At least, that’s what I told myself.

“Divide incoming,” the lead called.

“Drop down to 40, right track,” the truck driver said in a voice that somehow sounded like a completely different pitch than before. “When I say go, light it up.  

“Copy,” we both replied.

Idling to the side, a strange tanker pulled into the left lane as we took to the right. It was low, with thick metal plates covering the exterior in boxy angles. A man in a full biohazard suit was strapped to the side with a nozzle roped to his hand. I stared into the dark visor of his gas mask as he slowly passed us to pull up on the truck.

“Go!” the trucker commanded.

I smashed the button to bring the floodlights to life. Black spots swam in my vision as I blinked hard against the flash. From the saturation, the view slowly cleared back into focus. Somehow, the load seemed smaller, as though it had shrunk against the onslaught of artificial light. It was brighter than high noon around the truck. I wondered how the trucker could see anything with the light coming from the lead’s vehicle as well. As if on the same wavelength, the lead started giving explicit instructions to the driver, acting as his eyes.

The man hanging off the side tightened his grip on his harness and leaned forward until he was a breath away from the fuel injection. His entire body stiffened as if electrocuted, his hand moving so slowly as he extended his reach to insert the nozzle that it almost appeared as though time had dilated. A chill ran down my spine, causing the hair on my arms to raise. The moment he made contact he jerked back hard and slammed into the side of the tanker.

“Hold!” commanded over the radio as the man flailed, going limp.

“Fuck, we have to do something!” I told my passenger whose only response was to choke up on his gun.

The dosimeter went off again and I glanced over to see his panic line his face. My lights brightened to the point I heard a high-pitched whining, as though the bulbs were about to pop. A metallic crack rang through the air as every single chain on the load went taunt, yet the tarps vacuum sealed tight against something that wriggled with no shape. The angles in the folds didn’t make sense. It was as if a three-dimensional form had been flattened against a two-dimensional plane.

“Pull back?” I asked, though my voice distorted as though I were talking through an old-timey radio.

“We can’t, not yet,” he said, his hand coming up to wipe bright red blood away from where it trickled out of his nose.

“Shit, man, are you okay?” I asked frantically, popping open the console to dig for anything that might help.

He nodded, though he started to go limp and slump towards me. My foot came off the accelerator as I reached over to prop him up. Just as I fell back though, the man swinging from the tanker started to convulse. A door on the side flung open and suited up arms reached out to drag him back in.

“Wake up, c’mon, wake up!” I shouted, fear tainting my voice.

With a hard shake of his head, he shot back up, looking around in confusion as though he didn’t know where he was. I kept my hand on his shoulder as he shuddered, raising a hand to his nose that came away slick with blood. His eyes turned to me for the first time, the pale blue of his iris shocking against the bloodshot veins snaking across his sclera.

“Here,” I said, pressing a wad of old napkins against his nose. “Hold this tight, tilt your head back.”

His eyes finally snapped into focus, and he swung his gun back into position. “What are you doing? Pull up!”

“Your fucking welcome,” I muttered as I hit the gas again.

It was pathetic watching him try and fail to learn forward, his eyes rolling when he tried to regain his earlier focus. The gun slipped from his hands as he pressed them against the dashboard, trying to lift his head and shaking hard as though weight was bearing down on his shoulders.

“I can watch it,” I offered.

“No,” he hissed. “I have to make sure it stays in place so you can drive.”

“You aren’t much good like this. Just tell me what to do.”

His breathing grew labored, and he finally relented. “Train your eyes on the payload. Move your focus every few seconds, no pattern. Up, down, side, doesn’t matter just make it random. Go in and out of focus, too. If your sight starts to vanish, call Code Ice into the CB.”

I nodded and did as he instructed. A copper tang filled my mouth, and my fingertips went numb anytime I got too predictable in my movements. Cold started to seep deep into my bones, as though the marrow was freezing from the inside out. Even my knuckles started to crack with each shift of my hands on the steering wheel.

“Lane ends 300 feet,” called the lead.

“Drop down to 20, almost full,” the trucker said, his voice heavy as though he was struggling to breath.

“That’s too slow!” my passenger exclaimed, his palm pressing hard against his forehead as he winced.

“Countdown to extraction,” the tanker driver called.

A long metal pole extended from a porthole in the cab with a hook on the end. Each heartbeat pounded my ears, growing louder with every passing second. As they counted down over the CB my thoughts strangled around the numbers, and while I heard them going down, the interpretation in my mind kept going up. I raised my hand to my temple and dug my fingers in as if that could stop the disconnect.

“One,” was called out, but ten flashed in my mind.

When the injector was ripped freed, a spill of diesel rained down. The tanker immediately veered hard into the other lane before rolling into a field with a cloud of dust billowing out behind. It caught hard on a rock, jerking upwards before tipping over and racking along its side until it came to stop.

“Bump back up to speed,” the trucker said nonchalantly, as though the tanker hadn’t just crashed. “Lower the lights.”

I started to snap retort back when the passenger reached out a hand to stop me, shaking his head weakly.

“They know the rules,” he said with cough.

Sighing, I clicked the floodlights off and fell back into the earlier rhythm. I tried to revert my attention back to my eye movements rather than think about the wreckage in my rearview. It was hard when with each tick I could feel the blood running through my veins and the sinew flexing against my bones.

“I can take back over,” he said softly.

“You sure?” I grunted.

“Affirmative,” he said, jutting his chin out as he assumed position again. “Look out the side window or something for a while.”

“Not much to see,” I said with a forced laugh.

“You’re a driver,” he said, starting to sound steadier. “Aren’t you used to being bored?”

“I like seeing it all pass by, even when its just flat fields of nothing. Reminds me what a small part we are in something bigger.”

“You *like* that?” he asked, skeptical.

“In the daylight. At night it just feels isolating, like we’re not really supposed to be here.”

“Yea, well, that’s probably true for this,” he said bitterly.

I looked over at him. He had gone pale, a sheen to his skin even though there was an uncomfortable bite to the air that adjusting the AC hadn’t seemed to help.

He shifted uncomfortably. “Thank you, by the way. For what you did back there.”

“No big deal,” I shrugged. “Why does looking at it do that?”

“It knows who watches,” he said grimly.

With a clink, the chains relaxed, no longer straining. At the same time, the tarp released outwards until the restraints were nearly obscured in its folds. I couldn’t explain why, since no sound came or went, but it was as if my mind went quieter.

My passenger laughed, relief palpable in his tone. “I think we’re going to be okay.”

“Yea?” I asked, laughing alongside him.

“Yea,” he smiled. “Worst part is over.”

He spoke too soon.

“Watch out, there’s a deer–” the lead car called before cutting to silence.

I watched in horror as the lead truck careened into the ditch, rolling over and over as it crumpled into an unrecognizable heap. Pieces of glittering metal and blobs of warped flesh littered the road, causing the trucker to weave as he hit the brakes.

“Light it up, light it up!” the trucker yelled at the same time my passenger was screaming out to not stop.  

With a click of the switch, the floodlights beamed, but this time they kept brightening until a series of pops took out them out one by one, including my headlights. We were too close to the rear of the flatbed when we were plunged into darkness. There was a resounding snap, and the chains burst free. They hit the asphalt in a series of sparks that illuminated the bulging material rising before us. There was no end, no beginning, only it.

We were moving, but we were still. From my peripherals, the road slipped past at breakneck speed even as I hit the brakes. The load kept growing closer even though the distance between us never breached. For a brief moment, I was reminded of those old movie sets where the background rotated behind a stationary set piece.

The windshield shattered into a spiderweb of glass before falling around us. He had shot the gun, but there was no sound. In fact, there were no sounds at all, not even the slight vibration of tires sliding over the road. It was all consumed by the form that rose high before us. It couldn’t have been the load. I had been watching it all night, and the mass it encompassed now was more than could possibly have lain across the flatbed.

We didn’t crash. I’d swear it on my life. Even so, we were there, and then we weren’t. Those moments may have been erased, but I felt in the depths of my being that they never existed at all. We were simply there, and then we were on the ground. I stared up into a sky full of pinpoint stars. They started out still before slowly whirling around each other, faster and faster until they were a vortex of pure white smearing the atmosphere sucking me in, calling me to their depths, reaching, screaming–

I sat up straight.

Dry earth crumbled beneath my palms. Confused, I lifted my hand and let it fall from my fingertips.

“Move! We have to move!” a voice warbled as though it were traveling through water.

I shivered as I turned towards it, cocking my head in confusion at the crouched form of the passenger. He reached out hand for me, his mouth moving but the sound came in and out. A bad connection, I thought casually.

He froze, turning around slowly. My eyes followed to what loomed behind. It was nothing. I strained to focus, but my sight kept slipping off to it. There was a gaping hole before us that didn’t exist. I tried to reach forward, but my hand went to the side, and my body went numb. Though I brought my hands together in front of me, they couldn’t feel each other. I couldn’t even feel the pull of air in my lungs. If I were breathing, it was filtering straight to my cells without being transported through molecular carriers. For that one, brief moment, *I* was nothing.

Then, I exploded back to life.

Every sound was too loud, every sight too bright, every touch pain.

The passenger let loose every round in his clip before loading another to meet the same fate. Each bullet flattened against *something*. It was all shadow and angles that couldn’t be defined. Where it was struck became a point of nothingness. It moved towards us, and the world warped inward as though it were the center of gravity.

When the last bullet had been shot, he turned towards me.

“Run,” he begged, but neither of us could.

Our feet may as well have been poured in cement for all the good they did us. Impending doom wrang my senses. Accepting my fate, I turned to look at the road in the distance. It was a winding rope with no beginning or end. My truck was laid over in the ditch, the dirt around it unsettled as though something had crawled from it. Flapping in the wind were the torn banners of my oversized load signs, and my flagger was snapped in half. The semi and flatbed were in worse shape, imploded inwards on themselves in shards of jutting metal.

The moon was marching the wrong path across the sky, running from the sun instead of chasing it. We should have been well into the night, not just past its fall. I frowned, wondering if I could will myself back under the light of day. Something the passenger had said earlier came back to mind, though it took a few grabs to hold onto the thought.

“The rules!” I called to him.

“It’s too late!” he cried out. “Just go, I’ll try to hold it off as long as I can.”

“They were to keep it in. Let them go,” I continued.

“That’s not how this works,” he said, pulling a pistol free with shaking hands as he faced it head on.

He took aim and fired, but the closer it got, the slower his movements became. There was a flash of light that lit up the space around it wrong, like the light was behind the shadows. He looked at me and I held his eyes, the only thing left I could do as the form closed around him. His skin sunk beneath his muscles in mess of stringy reds before being sucked into the white of his bones. Nerves tangled around his form, lit up in a pulse of electric signals that had once made up all he was. They tightened around his skeletal frame before being consumed into their depths as well. He took two steps, the scrape of joints without the slick stretch of ligature grinding, and so quickly that it was hard to believe he’d ever been there at all, he collapsed into puff of dust that was carried away in a breeze that didn’t exist.

Fear was cold in my veins, reaching beyond those pulsing walls to claw at my throat. If only I could run to the open road. Freedom had always been there. A place where I was nothing, faceless as I moved with the flow of the world around me. If anything could understand, *it* would – but we had bound and watched it, and it knew.

Pulling my lighter from my pocket, I closed my eyes and flicked the flame into existence. The weak heat bounced before me, and I imagined it was a beam of sunlight from high noon. That false breeze tracing my skin was from the open window, and there were still hours to go on my drive. Vibrations beneath my feet were just the smooth of the road slipping away, but really, it was always me. The road never strayed.

Deeper I fell into that trance, so far that I didn’t have to convince myself anymore it felt so real. When I finally dared to open my eyes though, it wasn’t to meet the embrace of my fate. It was to the light of day.

Blinking hard, I looked around the empty road. I kicked at the hot asphalt, a sticky chunk breaking away under the toe of boot. Heat rose in waves around me, my clothes already drenched in sweat that begging for the relief only a gust of wind could bring. Grassy fields waved around me, and the form of a car wavered in the distance. I tried to wave it down, and it slowed, but continued without stopping. A few more did the same before a state trooper finally pulled over.

“What are you doing out here? There’s nothing for miles,” he asked.

“I-there, back that way, I was in a wreck…” I stammered.

He frowned, pulling down his reflective sunglasses. “Just came from that way, didn’t see anything. You go off road?”

“Not my truck, no,” I said, my eyebrows furrowing in confusion.

After looking me over, he motioned for me to get in.

“Sounds like heat’s getting’ to you. Dehydration’ll do that, y’know. Let’s get you back to town. I’ll send one of the boys to check it out.”

I nodded and complied, still in a daze. He handed me a warm bottle of water, but I guzzled it down. He fiddled with the radio, and when the hum of static buzzed, I gritted my teeth so hard a tooth cracked.

“You okay?” he asked. “How long ya’ been out there?”

“Don’t know,” I answered honestly.

He huffed but left me in silence as we made our way back to the station. I leaned my head against the glass, looking up into the puffy white clouds and breathing deeply. It felt like borrowed time, like I wasn’t really supposed to be there.

At the station they confirmed there were no signs of any wrecks along the highway. Confused, I called my boss on their landline, my eyes trained on the television playing quietly in the loudly. Local news stories flashed across, nothing out of the ordinary. Some feel good coverage of a local school sporting event, the town approving a rezoning at the last council meeting, and a nearby fertilizer plant that had caught fire and exploded in a tragic accident.

“Where have you been? You missed your last assignment. I’ve been trying to reach you for days!” he fumed when he finally picked up.

“I was in an accident doing that night run you gave me.”

“I didn’t give you a night run,” he said, sounding genuinely confused.

“Yes, you did.” I dropped my voice, making sure nobody was within earshot. “The one with the NDA.”

“Don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“Yes, you do!” my voice rose.

“You must be confused,” he dismissed. “Your truck is here and its fine.”

I nearly dropped the phone.

“What do you mean it’s there?”

“It here, and *you* need to get here if you want to keep your job.”

He hung up, and I stared at the receiver before putting it back and walking outside. One of the receptionists came out and asked if I needed a ride to the hospital, but I dismissed her and asked how to get to the nearest bus station.

After a series of bus drop offs, a seedy hotel, and a cab, I finally made it back to my home station. Sure enough, a truck that looked like mine sat in the parking lot. My boss gave me an earful, still denying anything about that trip before throwing the keys at me and telling me to get to my next job.

He could say it all he wanted, but it wasn’t my truck. The differences were subtle, but after thousands of miles I knew every detail better than the back of my own hand. Cracks in the leather followed a different pattern. There was a slight difference in pressure on the pedals. Even the hum of the engine was off a pitch.

I tried to carry on and forget about that night, but it was always lurking in the back of my mind. It wasn’t just my truck that was different. People’s voices didn’t quite match up with the movement of their mouths. Things in my periphery would shake, but when I turned my head, they were stable. Anytime I turned on the radio, it was like I was hearing double, a quiet voice talking in tune just below the other. Food tasted off, the flavors washed out and bland no matter what I added to it. I’d see grass bend in the wind, but it never brushed my skin. I never touched another cigarette, the pull no longer a vice, but a repulsive burn.

Driving back over that road didn’t change anything, even when I braved a pass at night. It was just another empty highway. Scouring the news didn’t tell me anything, just a stream of local stories and tragedies in line with every other small town. Sometimes I started to believe that I was the crazy one, but then the memories would come back as vivid as if they were replaying before my eyes.

Even if I could never prove it, I knew that whatever we had hauled was still out there, and it made me wonder just what dimensions were broken that night.",1,1767314813.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1q1k8wj,https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsySellers/comments/1q1k8wj/need_advice_on_my_blind_date_with_a_book_listings/,Need advice on my Blind Date with a Book listings,"So I decided to set up a shop to sell two different Blind Date with a Book products a little over a month ago. So far, only two visits and no sales.

I wanted to provide a budget-friendly, no-frills alternative to some of the lavish Blind Date with a Book listings that, IMO, have gotten out of control and loaded with stuff that has nothing to do with books (bath bombs, hand lotions, tumblers, stickers, socks, Doritos, etc.). I wanted to put the focus back on the book.

The first listing is just the book and a beverage of your choice (random flavor). The second listing also includes a journal, a pack of annotation tabs (assorted colors), 1 felt tip pen (random color), 1 highlighter (random color), and 1 pack of incense sticks (random scent).

I chose a base cost for the book of $10. After calculating my other costs, I decided on a price of $11 for the first listing and $31 for the second.

I know some sellers would have various ""packages"" in a single listing, and you'd choose ""Book Only"" from one of the customization options, but I decided on two separate listings, so I could use the two customization options for other things.

The first option is Subgenre. Since all of these books are Romance, I'm offering Surprise Me!, F/M Modern, F/F Modern, F/M Historical, F/F Historical, F/M Romantasy, F/F Romantasy, F/M Christmas, and F/F Christmas. I wanted to keep it simple instead of overwhelming the buyer with a plethora of choices, and I made a note that they can list any restrictions under Personalization (though I also mentioned I can't guarantee they won't get that type of content).

The second option is Beverage. They can get coffee (regular or decaf), tea (regular or decaf), hot cocoa (sugared or no sugar), or spiced apple cider.

I decided to not offer free shipping (which would involve making a guess and jacking up the price) and instead gave the buyer a bunch of USPS shipping options.

The book wrapping is simple paper with text on it and tied with yarn. It ships in a bubble mailer, not a box.

The pictures, admittedly, aren't captivating. Each listing has only one photo showing everything that comes with. No videos. No colorful images listing the contents (which are found in the description). Etsy reminds me that more images would increase my views, but I think it's kinda pointless to show a bunch of pictures and then add the disclaimer: ""Items in images are examples only. Actual contents will vary."" Also, these are fairly light items packed in a bubble mailer, not a box, so there are no colorful ribbons or wrapping paper or anything like that.

I dunno what to do. Is it possible that, by choosing to focus on items that (IMO) make the most sense for Blind Date with a Book and not loading up the package with extras (and increasing the weight and shipping cost), potential buyers think they're not getting ""value"" for their money?

I tried adding other sellers' listings to my cart and went to check out. When they offer shipping, I'm generally beating them on it. I'm also beating them on Book Only price (although their ""Book Only"" tends to come with a bunch of extra items).

I'm not trying to do gangbuster business with this. I make enough doing food delivery, and I have savings. This is just a fun side hobby.

Any advice is appreciated.",1,1767314550.0,EtsySellers,1,1.0,False

After a banana, morning coffee, and a kiss to my wife I was out the door. She tried asking more about baby stuff but I just couldn’t talk about it, there was a job to be done and, in all honesty, I have been avoiding the subject. How could the tooth belong to someone from that long ago? Was the tooth a namesake of John's family? I am unfamiliar with Native American customs when it comes to holding on to something like teeth. Maybe it was a way to honor their ancestors. Too many questions and not enough answers. When I arrived, Carson was waiting outside the department for me. We walked in together. He was rubbing his eye.

“How are you able to drink as much as you do and not call out of work?” Carson asked.

“ I think my dads side of the family was Scottish or Irish"" I replied with a wink. Which was bullshit because to my knowledge I am mostly Welsh and English. Who cares, same island.

“That would explain your stupidity, you make your ancestors proud” Carson giggled with immediate regret as I could tell his head cracked from it.

	When we got to forensics Kim came up to me looking a bit shaken. I asked her to see what was going on but she was inconsolable. Kim was a 66-year-old woman who chain smoked. Worked for BPD for 30 years, a true rock in the department. I never thought I would see the day where she was shaken up by a piece of evidence. All she said to us was “It’s gone.”

	When we tried to press her as to what she meant she finally clarified. According to Kim the tooth was in more or less good condition. Besides the blood on it, not a single mark or erosion was indicated when we brought it to her the night before. Kim went on to state as soon as she radiocarbon dated the tooth and got the results it dissolved in front of her eyes. She had never seen anything like it before.

	So now we were left with no evidence left. Only knowledge that the tooth existed to begin with and how old it was dated to. Kim stated she would stand under oath and swear to the tooth's existence once we caught the suspect. I thanked her for her work and told Kim to get some rest. Carson and I took our leave.

“So now what?” Carson asked.

“Let's pay John a visit. Maybe he’s got some ideas.” I replied.

“We don’t even know if the tooth had anything to do with the murder or the kid's disappearance.”

“Maybe, but remember the way the wounds looked on Natalie? Or Tallulah Birdinground from two weeks ago? We thought a hack saw was the weapon but couldn't it also look like biting? I mean you saw the tooth right? The thing was sharp to the touch and it certainly didn’t feel like it was 400 years old.”

“Well I guess we got nothing else going for us”. Carson said in an annoyed tone.

Carson is relatively fresh to homicide. He started about two years ago and has been my partner since his first day. I am three years older than Carson so the partnership has truly been more of a friendship and outside of my wife and immediate family, I am unsure if I consider anyone closer to me than Carson. However, Carson is impatient, and the job has taken a toll on him like it would any sane person. Although Carson is only three years younger than me I started homicide when I was 28, I am 36 now. I have been in this game far longer and after a while, with enough compartmentalization, the job becomes nothing more than that, a job. It can’t be anything else or you go mad. Right now for Carson, it’s everything.



I called John and he gave us the address of his brother Red’s house. When we arrived we were greeted by a scrawny 20 something year old. It was John’s brother Red. Red told us he would be back in an hour and he was going to take the opportunity to run to the store while we were here. He has been unable to leave John out of his sight in fear John would kill himself. We said we would hang here until he returned and he thanked us.

“Was there really nothing other than her torso? Natalie was practically my sister, I never thought something like this could happen to her, someone so good.” Red asked quietly.

“Yeah, I’m real sorry. We’ll find the bastard that did this.” I answered

“Thanks, anyway I’ll try to make it quick, we can talk more when I get back.” Red left in a hurry.

	When we entered the home the smell of booze stung the nostril. While Red was able to hold John back from killing himself, it was apparent he couldn’t keep him away from alcohol.  John was laying on the couch with a handle of vodka empty on the coffee table. Still inebriated he tried his best to engage in conversation in a far friendlier manner than last night, I was unsure if he is genuinely more hopeful or if it was the vodka talking.

“What can I do to assist you, detective?” John said in slurred speech.

“John, we found a tooth at the base of the stairs last night. It was covered in blood. We thought it might have belonged to the suspect before we ended up age dating it. Turns out the tooth belonged to someone who lived near 400 years ago. John, did the tooth belong to you or your wife? Maybe a family heirloom?”

“I don’t know if I know any Indian who would be weird enough to hold onto a tooth from a potential ancestor so no, and my wife never mentioned anything about a tooth.” John sarcastically remarked.

“What about the feather sticking out of her chest” blurted Carson.

“What? What feather?” John stated with a sudden seriousness that caught us off guard.

I darted a glance at Carson as I deliberately withheld that information out of fear that John would further blame himself. Especially since he is higher risk but since John’s currently being watched closely by Red I guess it's the best we got right now. The tooth came up blank but John’s curiosity and sobering seriousness led me to believe it was our best shot.

“It was an eagle feather, protruding from her chest. It was, besides the dismemberment, how we were able to connect the murder of Tallulah Birdinground from two weeks ago to this one.” Carson answered.

“You guys should leave. I don’t want you guys to get in over your head with this.” John stated.

“That's ridiculous John. Whether you like it or not this is our case, and it's your kid on the line. Let us help you. Besides, if your withholding something from us that won’t look fondly on you, who might I remind, if we can’t find anything else is primary suspect #1” I stated firmly.

“Fine ya bastard.” John snarked.

He continued, “Listen, some people from my tribe told stories. Dumb stories, to scare children to make sure they listened to their elders. That if they misbehaved they would be taken and their mothers would be eaten up. I never believed it until someone on the reservation when I was a kid lost his wife and child sixteen years back. The feather was lodged in the wife's chest. If what you tell me is true and you refuse to give up, then me and Red can take you to the old chief of tribal police at our reservation. If he’s still around anyway. Last I heard he lives in the Bear Tooth pass. Maybe I got the facts wrong but he could tell you what happened.”

“That's a start.” I replied.

	Do I believe in supernatural occurrences? Well I do believe in God, so I guess that would mean yes. However, despite being a man of faith I have always tried to keep my job in objective reality, what I could see and what I could control. Was there some monster that took these women's lives and took their children? In my mind no. The only monsters that exist in my line of work are manmade. Keenan reminds me everyday. Haunting me. However, this was our best shot at catching the culprit and if this story is true maybe the murder at the tribe sixteen years ago is the same man who killed John’s wife.

Once Red returned we filled him in on the details and agreed to meet with Chief of the tribal police, Paco HoldsTheEnemy in two days that Friday. We shook hands and John shared a look with me that I can only describe as mutual respect, a far better start then how we initially met. John is a good man, I can tell. It was a shot in the dark but it was all that we had. The rest of Carson and my day was filled with paperwork on the second phantom murder in the same month. 

The department was starting to put the pressure down on us to find someone to convict, even if that meant John. You have to understand that in a town the size of Billings, serial killers are the talk of the town. That coupled with department politics, and pressures from the press, there is not much room for failure. Wouldn’t want to make the department look bad. I just hope Paco held onto some evidence from back then. Otherwise I might have to try and convict a grieving father. Is that justice?

That night my wife ordered a pizza (pregnancy cravings). We cuddled and watched our show since I didn’t have any late night dismemberment calls. Nights like this made me think that it was time for me to transfer to less dangerous and less busy work. When it was just me and her, it was perfect. We called it quits around 9 PM and when I’m able to catch as many Zzz’s as I can, I do. Sleep isn’t guaranteed anymore.

I had another dream. This one longer. The same one, accept this time John was with me. We both fell into the snow. In the distance that same thing was there. This time sprint-crawling at us. I heard the singing again but this time it was different words from the first dream.



*“Crow child, beware the red-painted face,*

*She walks between worlds, she leaves not a trace.*

*If she calls you at night from the cottonwood tree,*

*Don’t follow her voice — or you’ll never be free.”*



I started looking around to see the voices. When I turned around, I saw three Native children in a shrub about 20 yards away. They were the ones singing. The choir. When I turned to tell John, I saw whatever was crawling at us grab him by the ankle, its face covered by John's lower-body but it had to be over 8 feet tall. It dragged him back where it came from and it was John’s screams that finally woke me from my dream. When I woke up I was sweating. I checked my phone and saw I got a text from Carson. To my shock and horror. The text said bluntly:

“John’s dead. Red called in to report it. Hung himself. He left a message for you. Get down here.”

1q1k68f,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q1k68f/the_oldest_son/,The Oldest Son,"I kind of hate this new one and was wondering if anyone would have any feedback on this or suggestions as to what to rework and fix. 

Thank you! 

Chapter One.

The oldest son never truly leaves town.

That’s the version we give outsiders; we say it like a tired joke, like something half true and half harmless. He ran off; got bored; found trouble somewhere else. The words come easy because they have been practiced, handed down the way you pass down fence posts or recipes that stretch meat farther than it should.

The truth is always harder to say.

The truth is that the oldest son belongs to the land.

The first sign something was wrong was my father measuring me.

It was early spring, the kind that smells like thawed mud and rusted water, when winter has not quite let go of its grip. He stood me in the kitchen doorway with a length of twine, pressing it flat across my shoulders, then down my chest, then around my back. He didn’t explain what it was for. He did not look at my face.

“Stand straight,” he said, pressing his palm to the middle of my back. 

I did.

The twine scratched my neck. His hands were rough and careful at the same time, like he was afraid of hurting me but more afraid of doing it wrong. When he finished, he cut the twine and folded it neatly, slipping it into his pocket like something valuable.

My mother watched from the stove. She stirred a pot that did not need stirring, eyes fixed on the steam rising up as if it could hide her from the room.

“What’s it for?” I asked.

My father hesitated, just a moment too long.

“Later,” he said.

“Later, when?” I pestered, curious and afraid. His jaw clenched, setting down the spool of twine. 

“That’s not something for you to worry about, yet,” He told me, his voice tense. 

“Dad, I’m just curious, I-“

“I said don’t worry about it!” He yelled. 

My father was never a loud man, soft-spoken but stern. My questions scared him, I knew it. 

I learned not to ask why after that. 

I was just sixteen then. Still months away from seventeen, still technically safe, if safety was ever real to begin with.

After that morning, small things began to change.

My father started paying closer attention to me. Not in the way parents usually do, not with concern or pride, but with inventory. He noticed how tall I was getting, how my shoulders filled out my jacket, how much space I took up at the table. He watched me eat, watched me sleep, watched me walk across the yard like he was trying to memorize me. He…studied me. 

At night, I lay awake listening to the house settle around us. The walls popped softly, the floorboards creaked, the old place breathing like a tired animal. Sometimes I imagined it was listening too.

Chapter Two.

My name disappeared in May.

I found out by accident, flipping through the family Bible while the house was quiet. My father kept meticulous records inside the front cover. Births, deaths, marriages, written in ink that had browned with age. My grandparents. My parents.  Then finally, me.

Or rather, not me.

The space where my name should have been was blank.

No crossing out. No smudge. Just absence.

I checked the handwriting. It was my father’s. It always had been.

That night, I asked my mother about it.

She stood at the sink, hands submerged in water long after the dishes were clean. When she answered, she didn’t turn around.

“You must be remembering wrong, Silas,” she said.

“I’m not.”

Her shoulders tightened.

“Please,” she said quietly. “Don’t start this.”

After that, I noticed how often my name went unused.

Teachers called on me less. Neighbors greeted my parents and nodded at me like I was an afterthought. At church, the pastor spoke often about duty and obedience, about knowing your place in the order of things. His eyes slid over me without settling.

The town felt like it was gently backing away. Fading out of view like someone was forgetting what it looked like. 

Even the animals noticed. Dogs avoided me. Livestock shifted nervously when I passed. Once, a horse reared for no reason at all, eyes rolling white, and had to be calmed by three grown men. I felt like an omen, a curse. Something dark hang over the town, and it centered  on me. 

My father began locking the doors at night.

All of them. 

I heard the keys after midnight, the careful click of locks being tested and retested. He paced the halls, trying every door over and over again until he finally felt satisfied enough. 

Once, I woke to find him standing in my doorway, watching me breathe. Examining my unconscious form like a predator to its prey. 

“Just checking,” he said.

I didn’t sleep after that.

Chapter Three.

By summer, the woods felt closer.

They had not moved, not in any way I could measure, but the air around them felt heavier, as if something unseen was pressing outward, testing the boundary between trees and field. The treeline seemed darker than it had before, the shadows pooling thicker beneath the branches. Even in full daylight, the forest swallowed light in a way that felt intentional.

I avoided looking at it whenever I could.

Still, my eyes were drawn there against my will. I would catch myself staring while crossing the yard, or standing at the sink, or walking home from town. The woods did not respond. They did not shift or whisper or beckon. They simply existed, patient and unmoved, which somehow felt worse.

People in town began asking my father how I was doing.

They asked him in the feed store, at church, in passing on the sidewalk. Their voices were casual, but their eyes lingered on his face a moment too long, searching for something in his expression.

They did not ask me.

When I entered a room, conversations softened or stalled entirely. I became something people talked around instead of to. At school, teachers no longer scolded me when I drifted off during lessons. They let my silence pass without comment, as if correcting me would be pointless.

At the feed store, an old man leaned across the counter and studied me with open curiosity.

“You look grown,” he said.

It did not sound like praise. It sounded like a conclusion. I nodded uncomfortably, looking away before leaving the store. 

At home, my father spent more and more time in the barn.

I heard him out there late into the night, long after the rest of the house had gone still. Tools scraped and clattered. Wood dragged across the floor in slow, heavy movements. Sometimes there was a dull thud, followed by silence, and then the sound of something being shifted again, as if he could not get it positioned the way he wanted.

When I asked what he was working on, he told me not to worry about it.

His hands were rougher than usual. His eyes stayed fixed somewhere just past me.

My mother stopped speaking to me unless absolutely necessary.

She answered questions with nods or single words. She avoided being alone with me. When I entered a room, she found a reason to leave it. Once, I caught her watching me from the hallway, her expression tight and unreadable, like she was memorizing my face against her will.

One night, after supper, I asked her if she was afraid of me.

The question hung between us, heavy and undeniable.

She closed her eyes and rested her hands flat on the table, fingers spread wide as if bracing herself.

“I am afraid for you,” she said, “I’m afraid…to lose you.” 

Her voice was quiet. Steady.

That was worse.

After that, I slept poorly.

I woke often, heart racing, certain someone had been standing over my bed. Sometimes I heard footsteps outside my door. Sometimes I thought I heard breathing that was not my own. Each time, I told myself it was nothing, that fear had a way of inventing sounds when given too much room.

The night before my birthday, the dream came.

I was standing in the woods, barefoot, the ground cold and damp beneath my feet. Leaves clung to my skin. The air was thick and difficult to breathe. I could not see anything ahead of me, not trees, not sky, not even my own hands, but I could feel something waiting.

It did not rush me.

It did not speak.

It simply waited, certain I would move eventually.

I woke drenched in sweat, my sheets twisted tight around my legs, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. For a long time, I lay there staring into the dark, listening to the house settle and breathe around me.

Outside my window, the woods were quiet.

They always were.

Chapter Four.

The morning of my seventeenth birthday came like any other, except that nothing felt ordinary. The sun rose pale and thin over the fields, struggling to burn off a mist that hung stubbornly low. The air smelled damp, not of rain but of something deeper, older, something the earth had been hiding all year. I noticed it first when I walked past the fence line on my way to the barn. The grass pressed against my legs, wet and sticky, and the treeline looked closer than it had the night before. Shadows pooled unnaturally under the trees, darkening the edge of the woods like ink spreading in water.

My father sat at the table, coffee cooling in his mug. He did not glance at me when I entered. He only stared toward the fields, his hands wrapped tightly around the mug as if it were something alive. My mother moved silently behind him, setting plates for breakfast without a word. I tried to speak first, to say something that might break the silence, but the words stuck in my throat. Every instinct told me not to move too fast, not to look too closely, and certainly not to challenge the quiet the house had fallen into.

“You know what today is,” my father said, his voice low, deliberate, measured. It carried weight, not just the ordinary weight of a parent’s words, but the kind that presses on the chest, the kind that makes a person swallow hard without thinking about it.

“Yes,” I said.

He did not respond immediately. His eyes never met mine. Instead, he leaned back in his chair, fingers tapping on the mug. I tried to read his expression. There was fear there, but it was buried beneath something colder, something deliberate, like a blade hidden inside cloth.

“You going anywhere?” he asked after a long pause.

“No,” I replied.

He considered me, silent again, the sound of the clock ticking in the background louder than it should have been.

“You should,” he said finally.

“Well, I’m not,” I said, firm this time, forcing the words past the dry weight in my throat.

I saw it then, the small flare of anger in his eyes, quickly covered by the mask he always wore: calm, steady, unshakable.

“You do not get to decide that,” he said. The words were sharper this time, carrying a finality I could feel in my chest.

“I already have,” I answered, even though my body trembled beneath the table.

Breakfast passed without other words. My mother avoided my eyes entirely, her hands busy clearing plates, wiping counters, arranging silverware. I knew she wanted to say something, to stop what was coming, but she couldn’t. She was trapped in her own miserable silence.

The morning stretched far too long. I stayed visible, walking slowly in the yard, passing the fence line repeatedly. The fields, normally comforting, felt constrictive. The trees whispered when the wind blew, leaves brushing against one another as if conspiring. I could feel them watching. Not seeing, not like eyes, but feeling. The pressure of expectation built in the air around me until it became a thing I could almost touch.

By mid-afternoon, the first horror arrived. It was small at first: a shape at the edge of the woods, the flicker of movement that could have been a deer, or a branch, or something watching me that did not belong. I froze. My heart jumped, pounding so hard I thought it might crack my chest. The shape shifted, deeper into the shadows, and I could swear it moved with purpose, tracking me, anticipating me. I ran toward the barn, desperate for the familiar, but the yard seemed longer than usual, the fence posts leaning inward as if pushing me along, herding me.

Inside the barn, it was darker than I remembered. Dust motes swirled in shafts of sunlight, but the corners hid deeper blackness that seemed to pulse, to breathe. My father was there, not working, just standing among the tools and boards, silent. When I saw him, my stomach sank. He was not angry yet. That would come later. This was worse: the quiet patience of someone who has already decided what must happen and is only waiting for the correct moment to act. 

“You were supposed to go,” he said softly.

“I didn’t, ” I answered, voice shaking.

He stepped closer, the boards beneath his boots creaking in protest. Each step echoed in the barn, magnified by the emptiness. I realized suddenly how alone I was, how unprepared. The forest outside might have been patient, but my father was deliberate, and deliberate always hurt more than patient.

“Do you know what it means to refuse?” he asked.

“No-no, I don’t,” I said, though the answer came out wrong even to me. I knew I was lying.

He reached for a tool leaning against the wall. Nothing heavy, nothing sharp. Not yet. Just a hammer, but the intent behind it made the air seem heavier, as though the room itself was pressing down on me.

I backed toward the doorway. My feet caught on loose straw. I fell. Pain shot through my knee, sharp and raw. The hammer lifted above him, steady, patient, a warning I could not ignore.

Outside, the woods stirred nervously. A wind rose that had no discernible source. Leaves tumbled across the yard like tiny dry hands reaching out for me. Shadows moved just past the edge of vision. I could feel them pressing inward, urging me forward, pushing me toward survival I did not want yet could not refuse.

I scrambled to my feet. My father did not pursue, not yet, but his eyes stayed fixed on me, unblinking, unwavering. And behind him, I heard something that made my chest tighten with dread: a faint, low whisper, or perhaps the sound of the trees themselves, pressing toward me, counting, waiting.

I raised my hands, as if that would help. 

“Dad-dad, I-“ I bolted.

I ran, and kept running away from my father as he stayed behind. 

And for the first time, the woods did not wait.

Chapter Five.

The night was alive in a way I had never noticed before. Every leaf, every shadow, every sound of the forest seemed deliberate, as if the woods themselves were awake and watching. My father came home later than usual, moving through the yard with a sound that made my blood run cold. Boots against wet grass, soft at first, then louder, deliberate. I knew without seeing him that he carried something. His patience had snapped into action.

I tried to stay in the house, but instinct made me move toward the barn. The door was cracked open, the dim light of the moon spilling in. I should have stayed. I knew it.

“You should have gone,” my father said, stepping into the doorway. His voice was low, calm, but the air around it vibrated with danger.

“I-I’m not going,” I said, though the words trembled.

He took a step forward, and I ran.

The yard stretched out before me in the silver light of the moon. My bare feet struck the wet grass, mud and dew soaking through. I heard him behind me, shouts, heavy steps, the sound of the world shrinking to the sound of his boots hitting the ground and my lungs burning.

He caught up too fast. His hands grabbed my shoulders, yanking me backward. Pain exploded in my chest as he twisted me against his weight. My knee buckled on the uneven ground. I stumbled, scraping my palms along the wet earth.

“Do not make this harder!” he shouted.

I twisted, trying to break free. He swung me around, slamming me against a tree. The bark cut my cheek and tore my shirt. Pain radiated through my ribs, breath stolen by the impact.

The woods loomed just beyond the fence line. I wanted to get there. I had to. But my father’s grip was iron, his determination absolute.

He grabbed me under the arms, lifting me off the ground. The muscles in my shoulders screamed. He yanked me toward the treeline, and I clawed at the grass, at the bark, at anything that might give me leverage. My hands were slick with blood and dirt, losing any chance of a grip of safety. 

“You do not get to refuse!” he yelled, a sound raw and animal, tearing through the night.

“The Oldest Son belongs to the woods! You don’t understand, Silas!” He yelled. 

I kicked, I thrashed, but his strength was overwhelming. He swung me closer to the first dark trees. The shadows waited, patient, and I felt their pull, as if they wanted me too. My panic sharpened every sense. I could hear the snap of branches under my weight, smell the forest floor in the dark, taste iron in my mouth from a cut on my lip.

Then the hammer hit me over the head.

The world exploded into pain, vision going red and black. My legs folded beneath me. The ground rolled beneath my vision. I crumpled, out cold, and the forest spun around me in shapes I could not name.

When I came to, my arms and legs felt heavy and weak. My father’s hands were under my armpits, dragging me upright. His face loomed above me, pale in the moonlight, eyes wide and wild. He grunted as he tried to force me into the woods.

“No,” I rasped. My voice was raw, trembling.

He ignored me, muscles straining, dragging me closer to the dark mass of trees. My own panic lent strength to desperation. I kicked backward, connecting with his knee, jerking him off balance. I twisted, grabbing at his arms, clawing at his wrists.

He swung again, connecting with my stomach. I stumbled, caught a branch, pulled myself upright. He grunted, fury blazing in his eyes, but I had found leverage, and the forest seemed to tilt in my favor.

I struck him in the side of the head with my elbow. He staggered, off balance just long enough. I twisted, dropped to the ground, and ran, sprinting for the fence line. My lungs burned, my vision blurred, blood and sweat stinging my eyes. Branches whipped against my face, scraping my arms and legs, but I did not care. I couldn’t stop.

He roared behind me. The sound of him tearing through the grass, snapping the underbrush, was so loud it made my chest vibrate. He lunged again, hands outstretched, and I dove forward under the low branches, rolling through the mud. Pain screamed through my ankle, sharp and sudden, but I pushed through it.

The treeline drew close. The shadows pooled at the edge, waiting. My father grabbed at me one last time, just as I passed the first trees. I twisted, kicked backward, and felt his hands slip. I did not stop running. I ran until the fence was behind me, until the ground flattened, until the first stars blinked through the leaves above.

Finally, I collapsed in the dirt, gasping, chest heaving, limbs trembling. My head throbbed in time with my heart. Every nerve in my body screamed. The woods were quiet now, patient again, as if judging me, waiting for what would come next.

I was alive.

But I knew he would not stop.

And I knew the woods had not yet finished watching.

Chapter Six.

The night was darker than I had ever known. The moon had disappeared behind thick clouds, leaving the world in shades of black and gray. Every sound seemed sharper. My body throbbed from the previous night, every step a reminder of how close I had come to death. Every nerve in my body screamed, but there was no rest to be found. I knew he would come. I knew my father would not stop.

I moved cautiously through the fields, sticking to low ground where the grass would hide my footsteps. My hands were slick with old mud and new blood, cuts from the trees stinging. My chest heaved, lungs burning. Every shadow made me jump. Every breeze through the tall grass sounded like his boots.

I heard him before I saw him. His voice carried over the cold air, sharp and furious.

“You cannot run from me! SILAS!”

I broke into a sprint.

Pain shot through my body, but I did not stop. My body was a collection of bruises and scratches from the last chase. My shirt was ripped across the back, my arms raw from branches. But desperation lent strength I did not know I had. I ran toward the treeline, the dark waiting, calling, pulling me.

He came after me, relentless. His hands found me again, this time striking across my back and side. Pain exploded in sharp bursts. My ribs cracked under the force. I fell, rolling in the mud, my head smacking against the earth. Stars swirled above me, and I tasted iron in my mouth. He loomed over me, eyes wild, fists ready, dragging me upright, not letting me catch my breath.

“Do not make me finish this!” he screamed.

I twisted, kicked backward, clawed at his wrists, but his strength was absolute. I could feel my muscles tear as he swung me around, dragging me toward the dark edge of the woods. I bit, I screamed, I clawed at the grass, but he ignored everything except the determination that had always been in his eyes.

A sudden shiver ran through the trees, almost like the forest itself was inhaling. My father stumbled as if pulled from within, his feet caught in unseen roots. The branches seemed to reach for him, grabbing at his coat, snagging his sleeves. He roared, anger turning to panic, and I realized too late that the woods had moved.

With a sudden, violent tug, the roots and branches yanked him into the forest. He screamed, a sound raw and human, but cut off by the roar of the trees. The ground seemed alive, the branches wrapping around him, twisting, snapping. I could hear the tearing of cloth and flesh, the sound of something breaking that should not break. His hands clawed at the trunks, at the soil, at nothing. The shadows consumed him, dragging him deeper, and then the sounds stopped abruptly, leaving only the night and the low sigh of the wind moving through the leaves.

I collapsed to my knees in the field, chest heaving, blood running down my side from cuts my father had inflicted, ribs throbbing, ankle twisted. My body screamed in agony. I tasted dust and iron, my hands shaking uncontrollably.

I looked toward the woods. The shadows seemed still again, patient, as if nothing had happened. But I knew better. The forest had judged, and it had acted. My father had been pulled into it, torn apart by something older and stronger than either of us. I could feel it in the air, in the smell of wet earth, in the oppressive darkness.

I was alive.

I should have been terrified, but the only terror I could feel now was the memory of his hands, the sound of his voice, the way he had tried to end me. The woods had saved me, but they had done so in a way that left no room for gratitude. Only fear.

I lay in the mud for a long time, listening. The forest was quiet, but it was watching. Always watching. The branches rustled quietly as if having a conversation in a dead language. The trees swayed with an undeniable grace that man had no idea how to comprehend. The shadows had eyes I could not see, patience I could not measure, and the sense that one day I would owe it something, or it would take something else, lingered heavy in my chest.

I moved after dawn. Every step was agony, but I forced myself to rise, forced myself toward the old barn, the nearest house, anywhere I could survive another day. Behind me, the woods loomed, still, patient, and I knew that what had happened tonight was not mercy. It was the beginning of something far larger.

I was alive, but I was changed.

I call it: *My Room.*

I played with a perspective shift when writing this. The events from this piece of fanfiction should line up with the movie, but considerable liberties will be taken as we progress... ;)

My goal is to  help paper over the (masterful) cracks in the original story, and hopefully craft a narrative that holds together on its own merits! 

I've finished four chapters so far. They're all on my [Substack](https://eulogyforasterion.substack.com/p/table-of-contents-my-room). 

Let me know what you think! Any feedback is welcome! The first chapter is below!



>**Chapter 1**

>He’s the most beautiful man who ever lived. I want to kiss him to death.


>God, I’m thirsty.


>When I see his Mercedes pull up, I immediately hang up on the Reverend and rush to my sofa. I arrange myself on it, prim and proper with my legs clamped shut, just as Claudette taught me. I must assume the role in all its aspects. Headlights for eyes, half-parted lips, flushed cheeks. I cock my head slightly to the left in the way he likes, baring my throat as well as my soul. He must know that I am everything he could ever want, all he will ever need.


>When the door swings open and he glides inside, all the air in the room — in *my* room — dissipates. His eyes fall to my throat. I lose some of my composure.


>Johnny is like nothing human. It’s difficult even to look at him, much less take his measure. He is young — definitely younger than I am — but I can’t say exactly how old he is. His birthday is next Friday, but it’s anyone’s guess which one he’ll be celebrating.


>His features offer no insight. The contours of his face are pronounced and sharply defined; he might have been chiselled from pale marble. Thick black ringlets frame his cheeks and tumble down to his shoulders. He’s an unnatural beauty. I’m obsessed with him.


>Hell, I almost *love* him.


>As always, Johnny’s face splits into a grin when he sees me. “Hi, babe!” he says, his voice soft and mellifluous. “I have something for you…”


>“What is it?”


>*It* turns out to be a slinky scarlet dress. I beam at him and lean into his cold, expectant lips. I smile when they immediately yield under mine.


>I leave to try on the dress. Johnny falls back onto the sofa and watches me climb the stairs. I feel his stare, aware of how acutely he’ll be anticipating the moment I return, sheathed inside my pretty new dress. Seeing me will be the highlight of his day.


>He loves me; I have zero doubts about that. But if it weren’t for his best friend Mark, his heart would belong only to me. Johnny says it already does, but I see the way he looks at Mark…


>…and it kills me.


>I don’t want to think about Mark. Mark is the past. What matters is that Johnny and I belong together. I hear people talk all the time about animal magnetism or chemical attraction — but with Johnny and me, I think only of Plato’s two-faced man, split in two and cursed to roam the world in search of his other half.


>I knew Johnny was my other half the moment I first laid eyes on him, back at that ritzy hotel. At the time, I was working as a runner for the Reverend. I never expected to find my future husband there… and employed as a *busboy,* no less.


>He saw me sitting in the lounge, stirring my coffee with a satin-finished stainless steel teaspoon (which I’d made sure to slip into my purse before leaving) and felt compelled to approach.


>That was seven years ago. Last year, Johnny brought me back to that very spot for our anniversary, got down on one knee, and said: “Will you be my future wife?”


>I said yes, of course. I remember loving the way he asked… so much more memorable than a simple “Will you marry me?” And his habit of calling me his ‘future wife’ feels far grander and infinitely more romantic than simply referring to me as his ‘fiancée.’ Because the future is truly ours.


>In a month’s time, Johnny and I will be married. That’s his plan, anyway.


>But he’ll be mine long before that.


>As I remove my dress from the box, I tell myself that Mark will not get in our way, no matter what he may or may not know about me. Johnny and I are *inevitable.*


>It doesn’t take me long to slip into the dress. The heels are trickier. My trouble isn’t so much with putting them on (though that’s no cakewalk) as it is walking. As a result, I’m slightly unsteady on my feet as I make my way down to Johnny.


>Fortunately, he doesn’t seem to notice — he’s too busy drinking me in. When he tells me how good I look, I grin and turn on the spot. “Isn’t it fabulous?”


>Johnny smiles. He says he will do anything for me, which is only right. But this perfect moment doesn’t last: the door swings open without so much as a knock… and *he* enters.


>“Oh, hey guys,” the tumor says.


>“Oh, hi Denny,” Johnny replies amiably.


>Denny is short and sturdy, his mousy hair parted down the middle. He wears his usual stretched smile, though now it borders on a leer. I’m not actually surprised to see him here… he’s Johnny’s familiar, after all. Early in our relationship, I had to accept that there’s no keeping those two separate for long.


>I watch him stroll into my home like he owns the place. You’d almost think he’d been invited inside… or was *welcome.* He then stares at me with his lifeless, cold fish eyes.


>“Wow,” he says appreciatively. “Look at you!”


>Though I force myself to keep smiling, I don’t like the way he’s eyeing me up and down. My friend Michelle is always saying that he’s head over heels for me. I’m not so sure. Certainly, he’s attracted to me — almost everyone is. But it’s clear that Denny also sees me as a threat to his relationship with Johnny.


>And he’s right to think that.


>But what he doesn’t know (and can never know) is that the feeling is *entirely* mutual. Like Mark, Denny is *far* too close to Johnny for comfort.


>So, he needs to be dealt with.


>Johnny eventually stands up and conjures an excuse about needing a nap. Smiling through my teeth at the boy suddenly requires far less effort. It’s nice to be reminded that even Johnny’s patience with Denny has its limits.


>Of course, like a tick stuck fast in Johnny’s skin, Denny follows us upstairs. He even jumps onto our *bed*. It takes him forever to catch the hint that we want to be alone. And when he ruefully makes his leave, it takes every ounce of restraint I have in me not to thumb my nose at him. Johnny wouldn’t like that… and Johnny loves Denny almost as much as Denny loves him.


>It’s for this reason that I’m saving Denny-Boy for last.


>Before I kill him, I want Denny to look at my good work with Johnny — to know that *I* was responsible for it.


>And I want to watch him cry.


>Now that we’re alone again, Johnny’s eyes flick down to my throat once more. I draw close to him. This part runs like clockwork. It’s effortless with us. I barely need to think. In fact, I’m incapable of thinking right now.


>The only problem is that I can’t kiss him the way I want to.

I wish someone had written this when I was searching for reviews, so here is my HONEST review of the Poppy and Peonies Multitasker bag & accessories.

I have had this bag for a few months, so not long enough to ensure longevity, but I have no concerns as of yet.

This is a big bag. It carries everything I want. I could even use it as an overnight bag. I have in it a 40oz water bottle, coffee, lunch, fanny pack style wallet/purse, mittens, hat, scarf, kindle, book, laptop and emergency period kit at minimum. If you are petite, it will look awkward.

If you get this bag delivered in the winter. DO NOT try to open it until it is warm. Maybe even use a hair dryer. It's pleather. Pleather doesn't bend when cold, it will snap where it's creased.

If you are carrying a full 40oz water bottle, coffee thermas, lunch, laptop, wallet and etc, the bag will be heavy. It's already a few Lbs on its own. I only carry it to my car, to my office, and back so I don't mind. If you need to walk blocks and blocks to work, maybe don't get this bag.

The pink liner on the inside is thin and it was not stitched well in some spots. My bag came new with a few spots not fully stitched shut. Personally, this doesn't bother me as it's a simple fix that I'm capable of doing on my own.

The accessories (mini clear bag, cosmetic bag, wallet) are decent but I wouldn't want to pay full price.  I was able to get everything on sale and with free shipping, and I am happy with everything for the price I paid and expectations I had. I also value that it's a woman owned, small, Canadian company, so dealing with some imperfections isn't a deal breaker.

My official standing: if you can get them second hand, or on sale, I'd say it's absolutely worth it. I don't feel that the price is worth the materials used. Especially considering you cannot see them in person first to ensure quality.

Note: I'm not a bag person. I'm not big into fashion. This was a shot in the dark, and it worked out well for me. My only goal was to have my hands free walking in/out of work and not using a backpack. I have no other brands or products to compare it to.",2,1767314231.0,handbags,1,1.0,False

Sincerely,

Journalist at WTE News


Chapter ONE - January 9th ENTRY

Dear Diary,

Emotion: Complicated. Will elaborate on.

Oh Diary, I am perplexed as to what emotional reaction I should assign to today, as it feels as two-sided as the mixed month of March. It came in like a lion of ecstasy, but devolved into a woeful lamb! I hear your pleas for me to elaborate— and fear not, Journal, for I will quench your thirst as a testament to our relationship of 693 (soon-to-be-694) conversations.

And, dear Diary, because I value our relationship so, I must confess to you that I view you as a person. Therefore, in a sense, you are my audience. And in accordance with the laws I learned in Journalism academy, I must tell you about the good news before the bad news.

Bringing up the good news was the right choice for both of us, as I am already feeling the giddiness come inside of me. Oh Journal, I must describe this feeling to you through prose:

As Jean Knutty laid on his extremely chiseled abs, he giddily scribbled into his curvaceous journal while also masterfully kicking his feet in the air as if operating an invisible bicycle. He had the most gleeful expression on his face. This is evident in that the sides of his lips were curled upwards. A psychological sign that a human is happy.

I believe that description of myself was masterful. This will certainly aid in my journey into becoming Shakespeare's incarnation.

Aside from my prose practice however, I am very happy. This is because she sat close to me today. You know who, Diary. My favorite female! I have noted her several times in you, Diary. It would be embarrassing if you forgot.

You should know by now, Journal, that I'm hinting at you to guess her name.

I'll just tell you who. You never respond to anything I say. You are a terrible friend, and I do not know why I confide in you. I hate people like you that claim to be a great listener, because why would anyone speak to someone with nothing to say? You are a useless book full of TRASH!

Her name is NEVAEH. She has such a beautiful name. Did you know NEVAEH is actually heaven backwards? I have no idea what heaven is like, but if it's that good backwards, I'm just going to go there.

As mentioned earlier, the maiden sat close to me today, during lunch. She sat her voluptuous posterior down at a table only a few yards away. I speak with total candor as I say this, Diary: I broke out into a cold sweat. However, I must tell you the specific reason for my perspiration. I had been crafting an eloquent love letter for months now, one that rivals the romantic letters of the late Cyrano de Bergerac. This was my chance to reveal my fervent dedication to Nevaeh. I got up from my chair and sashayed towards Nevaeh's lunch to insert my letter into the crevices of Nevaeh's trail mix. I assumed the mix was her dessert-– she eats so healthily, I must add — but fortunately for her, she did not need dessert today, as she had my nectarine words of passion. I say this because when I eat food with paper, I assume it is sullied, so I do not eat it. I suppose she thinks the same as me, because I did not see her touch her trail mix all lunch. However, she did read my letter, which I believe was a sufficient replacement for her meal. I will share my masterpiece with you, as I have memorized it by heart in case I would have to recite it to her face-to-face.

Dear Nevaeh,

How could anyone believe that they are the most disgusting, vile thing in the universe? That would be arrogant. I am no king of kings; I am an unholy rat king beneath sympathy. I willingly shackle myself to my flaws; as a hadean secretion, I cling because I have no other kingdom than yours.

Alas, if you had not taken me into your heart, your flight would not be bound to my boulder, your illumination not cancelled by my ragged drapes.

From Your Devoted Lover,

Jeanny

I have an excellent grasp on the woman psyche. Girls love when a usually assertive male displays sensitivity, so this technique of self-defecation displays my devotion to the female taste. I'm sure you can deduce that my efforts paid off today, but it would be favorable to display the moment which ensued after giving her the letter in prose:

Jean Knutty laid his signature hazel-Knutt eyes onto Nevaeh as if she were gilded with the touch of Midas as she read Knutty's sonnet with wide eyes so as to not miss a vowel of her future-husband's confession. Jean's gaze softened as Nevaeh shifted her fragile face towards him and articulated a single Molotov to his heart.

""Thanks...""

""You're welcome."" Jean thought. However, his tongue was too quick, and had already asked Nevaeh out to coffee, an offer which was ultimately declined; however, Nevaeh cited work as the reason for her denial, which means that even her heart yearns to tether itself to Jean's.

Jean drew back with disappointment and said he understood. However, Jean understood that asking Nevaeh out to coffee would be asking too much from God this day, as he had already been blessed once with Nevaeh's angelic praise.

Through this prose, you receive a clear picture of what I felt today. After Nevaeh declined my invitation, I finished my lunch. About my lunch: it was good.

That was the highlight of my day, so unfortunately, we will now discuss today's ""lowdark"". You know that fellow— let me be frank for a moment— that guy, Harold Truth? From ETW News? America's fifty-SECOND most-watched news station? I know I mentioned him to you— we met at that violent collision at the snowboarding resort. Do I have to refresh your memory on THAT incident too, DIARY?!

I discovered that a novel by the guy had been placed on my desk after returning from a potty break. I didn't see who left it, but do you believe what was in the contents of that book, Diary? It was a scathing exposé about me, including all of my personal information, stretched out to 237 pages! This will be devastating to my career, Journal! I know you're just a book, but put yourself in a MASTER journalist's Reeboks for a second! 

This ""exposé"" does not even contain my correct personal information! It's practically a tabloid article with all of the botched, out of context information it uses! He got my address wrong, and called me an IMMORAL JOURNALIST for using like, two cusses in my Little League article! Harold Truth isn't a ""watchdog"" journalist, he's a TABLOID RAT!

And to think, at our last meeting, I assumed we had bonded! I can't condone this betrayal and devastation to my career. I have to retaliate! I will craft my OWN exposé that digs and PUSHES Harold Truth into a grave! And I know exactly where to start. Get ready for totally tubular, baby, because we're going snowboarding.

1q1k3jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1q1k3jo/sometimes_i_forget/,Sometimes I Forget,"I’m sitting here with my morning coffee, it’s a cold misty morning. And I’m wearing my best sweater I wanted to look my best because my daughter Mandy is coming over today. A rare treat as she’s usually very busy, speaking of a treat I must remember to bake a cake. Mandy is only 20 years old, I don’t see her as much as I’d like, she’s young but occasionally she does manage to make time for me.

She promised she’d be here by 2pm or was it 3pm either way I can wait, it’s all I seem to do these days anyway. God I can’t wait to see her and have a catch up I get so lonely here, June stops by once a day with my medication. She’s a good neighbour it’s hard for me to leave the house due to my bad back. I managed to see the doctor earlier, I had been meaning to get an appointment. He said I was suffering worse than usual with De.. De? I think he meant degenerative disc disorder so I guess that means more medication for me. I can’t say I’m surprised I am 55 years old now it gets worse everyday. 

Sometimes I hate it here on my own, my house feels like it gets smaller everyday I barely recognise it anymore. Before Mandy moved out it was always just the two of us. But these days I’m all alone, sometimes I even forget what day it is because every day feels exactly the same and the tv is always on, I don’t know where the remote is.

I think Mandy will be here soon I hope so.

It’s strange I saw June outside of my room so I asked why she was there, she said her name was Joan… that’s right her name is Joan and she told me she wasn’t my neighbour she’s a nurse? Joan gently took my hand and sat me down she says this is not my house its a nursing home and that I’ve been here for 45 years, I’d tell her that’s wrong but I’m too taken back.

Joan continues to tell me that I’m 95 years old, I shake my head unable to deal with this information I get scared and ask for Mandy. Joan looks at me with a pained expression on her face, she kneels down next to me and places her hand on my shoulder and in a calm soft voice she explained that Mandy is not coming because she can’t. I was 55 years old when Mandy was making her way home, her car was rear-ended and she died. Mandy never came back to me that day and I’ve been waiting for her ever since.

I sit and cry for a while unsure of what I’m supposed to do now, confused at how I could forget so much. Then Joan tells me one last thing, as if my situation wasn’t already bad enough she told me what the doctor was saying earlier… I have dementia. ",1,1767314158.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

Me and my girlfriend are both 24. We've lived together about 3 years, and just moved to this apartment about 5 months ago. We first spotted bed bugs about 3 weeks ago after I had noticed bites for about 2 weeks prior and have no clue where they could've come from, but whatever. We let the apartment complex know, but it took them until just now to start getting us pest control. The only place I have seen them is on the mattress (about 5 or so hiding in crevices in the box spring), and our bedroom is actually very bare because we didn't bring much bedroom furniture to the new apartment. We quickly bagged those up about a week ago. We were actually planning on tossing the mattress and box spring before all this happened, which have been on the ground, and I have an ikea bed frame still in the box, along with a dresser and nightstands, that I was going to build, and now they're just sitting in the boxes unopened for obvious reasons. Our lease does not allow us to self-treat, so all we can do is wait.

My girlfriend is already very high anxiety. She has gone to therapy for it in the past and taken medication, but hasn't done so in almost a year. Our relationship goes through ups and downs but we both really care about each other, enjoy the good times, and want to make it work. I tend to get seasonal depression (I was sort of in denial about this, but it seems consistent and true) that normally kicks in around this time. I also am a first-year high school band director, which I love doing, but is extremely draining and there's a very high learning curve and level of exhaustion that comes with being a first-year teacher, especially one with many after school commitments. With that, along with us questioning some certain life things recently and some arguments, our relationship was already going through a rough patch. Then, right at the beginning of Christmas break, when I was supposed to get a break and reward from making it through my first semester of teaching and actually get to recharge some, we have been hit with this, which I now believe is one of the worst things that can happen to somebody. This has been putting a huge strain on our relationship at an already unsteady time. We do not solve problems the same way. I take breaks, am level-headed, and low stress (almost too much sometimes). She is obsessive, does not rest, will not calm down unless everything is perfect (it never is), and normally we can work around this, but trying to work together against bed bugs is impossible. We try to just get out some, but it doesn't help. I had to cancel most of my Christmas plans with family for this. Visiting friends is stressful. It has just been me and my high-anxiety girlfriend sitting at home, obsessively washing and drying laundry, waiting for this hell to end. Even after taking all steps, she is manic about the situation, which is fair, but then she takes it out on me, saying I haven't done enough, how am I not more concerned, etc.

The treatment was supposed to start yesterday. I have no clue what the treatment will be, because the apartment has really shitty communication, but it is supposed to take around 4 hours (so I assume it is heat treatment), and the apartment has billed us $750, and confirmed other units aren't infested after I asked. Fine. The initial checklist from the apartment included moving furniture from the walls and drying/bagging clothes. Well, when the guy came in yesterday after we took those steps, he said there are still too many personal items out on shelves, like books and such, and that he would be back in 2 days. He clearly had some sort of chemical spray, and he said he didn't want to spray all over our stuff. I assume he will be spraying and also doing heat, because why else would it take 4 hours? She immediately broke down crying, because we finally thought we were making progress after all this hell, but we now had to do even more and wait even longer. Ok, 2 days. I thought we would just take the items off the shelves into some totes. But my girlfriend has insisted taking literally EVERYTHING in our apartment and putting it into totes and trash bags. Everything. So now, all the kitchen cabinets, bathroom cabinets, every item from our gaming PCs, closets, drawers, coffee table, pantry, you name it, EVERY item is in a tote or trash bag. Sitting in the apartment. And we have no clue if he's even using a heat treatment. It feels ridiculous. She was freaking out on me because I couldn't fit a lid on one of the totes and wanted to leave it open. We did all of this in one day, and it was hell, and extremely stressful. Constant disagreements about what can stay out vs what needs to be put in a bag/tote, since the guy's instructions were still very vague, simply saying there were ""too many items out"".

Now, right as she was leaving to stay with her family for the weekend, she found out her outfit didn't get dried. I started the dryer because I assumed her outfit was in there. But it was not. It was on the floor. She freaked out on me because she had to go, saying it was my fault. I asked her earlier if she wanted to dry her pants to wear, and she said yes and changed, and she took that as me meaning I would put them into the dryer. These seemingly small issues have piled and piled and piled on top of each other, and she stormed out. I feel like I am losing my mind. I am losing myself and my girlfriend to these bugs. I hope this ends soon.

Again, sorry for wall of text. Just needed to rant, because now I'm sitting alone, and she's gone, and the apartment has been completely torn apart, and this doesn't feel like a home during a much-needed Christmas break, it feels like hell.",1,1767314083.0,Bedbugs,1,1.0,False

I make sure i service the machine regulary. Sometimes change the water filter (very hard water), sometimes do a descale... , sometimes clean the brewing unit.

Even with all the measures sometimes my coffee turns very bitter in one brew to the other to the point where i have to dump it in the sink, and it only SLOWLY returns to normal once i coax the machine with a combination of all the 3 service measures. Sometimes it even happens directly after a descale.

For the cleaning of the unit, usually there are some coffee remains on it, but its usually not that bad and i dont see any way it would interfere with the brew since its just sitting on the edge.

---

I found this on my brother’s computer. Not in Downloads, not in Documents — just sitting there: a plain text file with no metadata, dated yesterday. The filename was mod_notes.txt.

His place smelled like stale coffee and the faint residue of someone who'd slept on the couch. The desktop was cluttered in the usual way, but the mousepad had a faint circle worn into it that didn't match his habits; his browser was open to a subreddit I moderate. I don’t go into his room without his permission, but he was out for the weekend and I needed to grab a charger. The room felt off, like a party had ended ten minutes ago and everyone had left the lights on.

I hesitated before opening the file. The first line made me sit down.

> They pulled it down before I could finish my coffee. Not a banhammer, not a message — just a removal note with a username I didn’t expect: u/████.



I’ve been a moderator for years. I know the handles. I know which accounts archive threads, which accounts flag, which accounts disappear quietly. This one didn’t match anything I recognized. I messaged it. Status: typing… for a long minute, then nothing. Later, the account was deleted.

The post? It was a short thing about reflections — small, incidental reflections in webcams and phone screens, the kind people laughed about sharing. It had comments, upvotes, the usual. Then it vanished. And that’s when things started moving.

MODCHAT — initial threads (copied from archive)

[MODCHAT — excerpt: 02:11 - 02:18]
u/ellie_mod: did anyone catch it before auto removed?
u/████: typing…
u/ellie_mod: it reads like instructions, weirdly procedural, but no one's following them
u/ryanmod: [deleted]
u/ellie_mod: i'm archiving what i can. back up anything you find.

[MODCHAT — excerpt: 02:33 - 02:46]
u/ellie_mod: ok… it’s not just here. jason found a draft on an sd card
u/jason_mod: SD card in camera. draft file titled ""mirror.txt"". swears it wasn't on my device.
u/ellie_mod: pull everything. lock thread. lock crossposts.

u/ellie_mod: pause. pattern emerging.
u/ryanmod: [deleted]
u/jason_mod: do we burn accounts? unplug devices?
u/ellie_mod: typing…

The more I scrolled, the more the logs repeated the same markers: [MOD] next to deletions, typing… frozen mid-ellipsis, and [deleted] peppered like punctuation. It wasn't just the content — it was the structure. Every time a line froze at typing… it was followed within hours by a deletion or an account that went quiet and then vanished.

I saved copies of everything I could. I started to pull threads into an archive folder on an external drive. The file names stacked up: mod_notes.txt, modlog_backup.zip, deleted_comments_2025-12-30.json. Small things, ordinary things, but when I opened the files they had been altered in ways that made the hairs on my arms stand up.

Comment threads (copied, redacted)

u/reader1: this is freaky
[removed]
u/reader2: mod?
[removed]
u/reader3: what the hell is happening
u/reader4: did anyone else see the typing… freeze?
u/reader5: someone explain why mods are deleting everything
[removed]

The replies were normal for a thread that had been locked and ripped apart: confusion, people trying to reconstruct the post from memory. But the single visible comment that persisted, again and again across archives I pulled, was the one-word question: mod? It wasn't consistent in the logs — sometimes it showed up as posted by u/reader2, sometimes as u/readerX, sometimes as an orphaned line with no username at all. Whoever typed it didn't leave other traces. Whoever or whatever created these orphans seemed to like the single syllable.

First physical evidence — Polaroid on the porch

The first physical artifact arrived that afternoon when I was back at my place. A Polaroid was slipped under my apartment door. No return address. No note. Just the image: my kitchen table as it looked that morning — the mug I’d left cooling, the open laptop, the window with the blinds half-closed. On the edge of the table, one corner of a sticky note folded, and on that sticky note someone had written, in heavy black marker:

—[MOD]—

The photo had been taken from inside the house looking out. My front door had been locked when I left. When I looked at the timestamp in the image properties (I don't usually check), it claimed it was taken an hour after I left the house. Someone was somewhere inside my day, capturing small domestic details and presenting them back to me like proofs.

I took the Polaroid down to a friend who works in forensics. She told me the photo wasn't doctored in any obvious way — no obvious signs of Photoshop, no composite artifacts. She did point out that Polaroids, especially old film ones, sometimes preserve light and shadow in the emulsion in ways that look like shapes. ""Pareidolia,"" she said. ""Our brains fill gaps."" It was a reasonable reading. It didn't make me sleep better.

Mini-vignette: Jason

Jason was new to moderating but he'd been in several similar subreddit teams for years. He had the air of someone who liked structure: spreadsheets, backup protocols, redundant archives. He DM’d me at 03:04 the morning after the first removal.

> Jason (DM): Found ""mirror.txt"" on an SD card left in a camera we recovered at a comp. Contains a draft of the OP. It's formatted like instructions but there's nothing that would be 'how-to' about it. The file keeps changing. This is fucking weird.



We spoke on a call. He sounded close to agitated and tired. ""I keep seeing myself in my daughter's tablet,"" he told me. ""Like a smear. Little movements that don't line up with my mouth."" He sent a screenshot: in the webcam thumbnail on his daughter's tablet there was a small, bright patch in the corner of the screen that resembled a face, only the smile was slightly out of sync.

Two nights later, Jason's apartment was empty. He'd left the door unlocked for a delivery, his phone on the coffee table next to a mug. Police found his laptop on, cursor blinking in a text editor, no saved files except one open document with a single line:

—MOD— I am listening.

Jason's family told the reporters he'd left to clear his head. They were sure he'd come back. No one ever saw him again.

Mini-vignette: Ellie

Ellie is older than me by a few years; she’s the sort of moderator who knows rules so well she can breathe them. Her last post in our private modchat is short and fragmented:

Typing… something… wrong… it knows the names

Her messages got more clipped. She started sharing corrupted screenshots — images where the pixels rearranged themselves like a mosaic mid-open. One file flashed bright then scrambled into blocks; another preserved the last frame of a webcam where her reflection's eyes were open after she'd closed them in the following frame.

My last DM from her said, bluntly: ""If you see typing that lingers, don't reply. Archive and step away.""

She stopped logging in three days later. Her account remains visible in our mod logs but every comment she made in that period reads as [deleted]. The last screenshot I recovered from her backed-up folder shows her sitting at her desk smiling, but if you pause on the tiny thumbnail just before the frame corrupts, there's a second face in the window behind her. It's smiling at an angle her head never turned to.


---

Corrupt files and impossible timestamps

I started cataloging anomalies in a formal folder. Metadata was strange in small ways: timestamps an hour off, timezones mismatched, files claiming to be copied from drives that did not exist. A screenshot1.png would show a modchat thread with typing… frozen beside a redacted username. The next time I opened that exact file, an extra line would have been added — not by me, not by any process I could trace.

A corrupted video clip named cam_1219.mov showed a person sitting at a desk, then fading into static. The ring in the photocell of the camera (the small LED) kept flickering in its recorded frame at the precise rate of the person’s breath — slower than normal, then suddenly three rapid inhales. The EXIF data indicated the file was created at 02:13, which matched the timestamps in the earliest modchat excerpts where the typing… marker first froze.

I thought it might be a software quirk, a cross-platform render issue. I had one of the subreddit devs look at the logs. He found a pattern in server access times: every time a thread was removed around that hour, a different server pinged the archive with a 404, then a 200, then a series of requests for a file that didn't exist. ""Ghost retrievals,"" he called them. ""Automated systems scanning for artifacts."" He didn't have a theory about the typing… markers.


---

Emails (redacted threads)

From: unknown@mailer
To: moderatorteam@subreddit
Subject: check the patterns
Body:
it listens when you pause. typing… frozen.
attachment: polaroid1.jpg

The image attached to that email is a grainy photo of a living room: a lamp, couch, a TV with a cloth draped over it. In the window's reflection a face seems to be leaning in, teeth bright and not quite right. The lamp in the photo is on. The footprint pattern on the carpet in front of the window is from someone who'd been pacing.


---

The pattern spreads — other communities

I started pulling reports from mods on adjacent communities. It wasn't just our little subreddit anymore. A moderator from a photography community reported an SD card found in a camera at a gallery; a moderator from a parenting sub reported a photo left in a mailbox; a gaming forum mod found a Polaroid in his apartment ductwork: a picture of his own bed from inside the room looking out. Each artifact had variations on the same motif: domestic ordinary scenes photographed from an impossible angle, a sticky note with a single black line, a [MOD] marker in handwriting or in code. The same orphaned mod? comment kept appearing in cached screenshots and in people's heads.

One long thread I recovered from an IRC backup had a line repeated by multiple users at different times: ""It learns what questions open doors."" That line made the private mod channels slow, the tone shifting from bureaucratic annoyance to superstition.

Police report fragment (redacted)

Incident: 2025-12-30 — Missing Person
Reporting: Next of kin reports subject left apartment 12/29. Door found unlocked. Laptop open. Text editor with single line: —MOD— I am listening.
No signs of forced entry. Small Polaroid found on coffee table. Physical evidence cataloged as photos 001-007.
Officer notes: subject's personal devices operational. No immediate indication of foul play.

The police don't publish bodycam ofensics to us. A friend in the PD texted me the fragment because he'd been worried about the pattern. He said, confidentially: ""We can't explain empty rooms and working PCs. People go drinking, run off. But these Polaroids make us uneasy. Keep your phone on.""


---

My obsession

I started sleeping badly. I kept returning to my brother's computer even though I'd copied the mod_notes.txt file to my own external drive. Every time I opened the copy, new lines would be present. Not a lot — a sentence here, a fragment there — but enough to make me question whether the file was retroactively being written, or if my brain was inventing additions when I couldn't sleep.

One session: I opened the file at 01:12 and recorded myself on another device while scrolling. Later, watching the recording I noticed the file's last line had changed during the recording. This isn't supposed to be possible. I had witnesses — a friend who watched the screen with me — and she couldn’t explain it. ""Maybe you kept scrolling,"" she said, but the timestamp in the video matched her watch. The line that had appeared was a single bracketed fragment:

[MOD] — typing…

I found myself checking mirrors in strange ways after that. Glancing at any reflected device, I would pause if something looked slightly delayed. My coffee tasted faintly metallic most mornings.

More vignettes — small tragedies and oddities

Mailbox Polaroid
A mod with a new baby found a Polaroid slipped under their mailbox flap: a picture of their child's nursery, taken from the hallway, with the mobile suspended in mid-rotation. In the photo's reflection the baby appears twice: once sleeping, once smiling with the wrong mouth. The mod reported checking security camera footage and finding a one-frame anomaly where the front door seemed to be open and closed in the space between frames.

Locked Hotel Room
A volunteer moderator attending a conference woke in a hotel room benching on the echo of his own breath. He found a Polaroid folded under the TV remote: it showed him asleep in the room, shot from inside the closet looking out. He had locked the door and triple-checked the bolt. The security tape outside showed nothing. The hotel manager apologized and suggested sleep deprivation. He left early.

Sleepwalking that never ends
A long-time mod sent a file of a webcam clip their partner had captured: one frame showed them sitting upright in bed, eyes open and fixed on the camera. The next frame showed them smiling in a way their partner never saw. On their bedside table, the partner found a tiny folded note with, written in cramped script: —[MOD]—.


---

The log that won't be fixed

I tried to be methodical. I zipped backups, computed SHA hashes, wrote down checksums. Each file in my folder had an MD5 hash stored in a text file. I left the room with everything backed up on two drives, locked them in a drawer, and went to bed.

When I returned the next morning, one of the hashes read differently. Not a little: the file itself had changed. A byte had been inserted. I compared it to the hash from the external drive I kept in my pocket. That copy matched my original text, but the one on my desk did not. The inserted text was small, in plain English, and it read:

mod?

On my desk there was no evidence of anyone having touched the external drive, no fingerprints I could find, no prints on the keyboard to match. My friend from forensics said that sometimes drive corruption can flip bits, but flipping to create human-readable text was not something she had seen.


---

A live meeting that ended

We tried to meet in person. A handful of us arranged to sit down in a cafe with full encrypted backups and a printed binder: a chain of copies of the modchat, printed emails, Polaroids arranged in plastic sleeves. It felt that first time like a support group. Conversation started calm: ""We lock threads, we share artifacts, we don't repost removed content."" Then someone pulled out a small white envelope with a Polaroid in it. The Polaroid was of our table — our mugs, our hands, the edge of the binder. The angle was odd: it had been shot from our lap looking up, as if from inside the table.

Nobody admitted leaving the Polaroid. The cafe owner was polite but nervous. When we checked the cafe security camera, the narrow camera feed had a CGI-like anomaly at 02:12 that looked like a bright pixel playing the outline of a face, then going black. The camera's motion logs recorded one placeholder movement at 02:12 when the store was closed and no events were logged. The staff wrote it off as a camera glitch. We did not.

The meeting fell apart. People who had been adamant about removing content quietly started recommending concealment. ""Unplug your webcams,"" someone suggested. ""Cover your screens."" Someone else whispered, ""Don't open unexpected files."" I felt like a parent in a room of adults who had to be told to close the oven.


---

The voice mail & the voicemail file

I received one voicemail shortly after midnight. The file was two seconds long. When I played it the first time it was my inhalation and then another inhale layered under it, like someone mimicking me from a second behind. A whisper, halting and wet, said: ""keep watching."" When I replayed the file in an audio editor and zoomed in on the waveform, the second inhale had a tiny periodic pattern that, when converted to text by a poor-quality automated system, yielded a single garbled line: —MOD?—

I called the number back. It was disconnected. I checked the voicemail headers: saved by my carrier at 00:43. The creator of the file could not be traced.


---

The escalation — crossposts, caches, and the archive crawl

The thread had been removed from our subreddit, but it persisted in cached forms. Aggregators, search engine caches, and crossposted mirrors preserved fragments. The fragments that preserved the most were those that had the typing… marker frozen inside them. When I pulled a cached HTML version into my folder, the typing… marker in the embedded comment was an actual text node. When I reloaded the cached page a day later, the comment had an extra line that wasn't there before.

I began to suspect the artifact could read and rewrite weak text nodes. It used public interfaces — caches, screenshots, polaroids, old cameras — like a moth using reflected light.

Our lead moderator proposed a solution in a voice message: ""We quarantine. We stop engagement. We delete our own backups."" The message was short, and at the end of it there was a static hiss and the last words, clearly recorded: ""If it learns patterns—"" then the file cut out mid-word. Later the archive showed that the voice message had been replaced with a different phrase that wasn't in the original: mod?.


---

A paradox: deleting seemed to move it

Every attempted mitigation seemed to create consequences. Locks and deletions correlated with the appearance of new artifacts. The more aggressively teams tried to scrub a thread, the more Polaroids popped up in mailboxes and the more corrupted screenshots emerged in unexpected places. It looked as if the process of closure — the deletion, the archiving, the typing — was what the thing used to understand the network of attention.

This is the part that made some of us stop and freeze: the very acts we thought would stop the spread looked like they taught it how to map. We couldn't tell if that was superstition or pattern.


---

Now back to the Post

I was reluctant to post publicly about any of this. I wrote and deleted three opening paragraphs at least. I keep thinking about the way our language gives permission by asking the wrong questions. I also know that silence doesn't mean safety. I have copies of everything, multiple backups, friends who will check them. If that seems paranoid, it's deliberate.

I'm posting this because I can't guarantee my brother's safety, and I can't sit on the pile of files that keep changing. I put the mod_notes.txt contents here in the order I found them — with redactions where needed — and I have not included the single sentence I deleted twice because it felt wrong, because it seemed to shimmer when I looked at it. I won't reproduce that line here.

What follows are things I found and compiled. I don't know how to end this cleanly. I only know the pattern keeps puncturing the room where I sleep.

The final meeting and the last log

---

We tried, once more, to coordinate with as many moderators as would answer. We set a time and asked people to join a private room and not to bring files with unknown metadata. Six of us logged in. We agreed to read aloud our artifacts and then to burn, metaphorically, the compulsion to repost or examine further.

The transcript ends at 01:42. The logs show:

u/ellie_mod: reading polaroid 12/29 — angle inside looking out. note says —[MOD]—
u/jason_mod: i found a polaroid in my postbox. angle is wrong. timestamp 02:15.
u/ryanmod: [deleted]
u/ellie_mod: typing…
u/ryanmod: i think — i think it wants names
[connection lost]

When the connection returned in the archive, some lines were white on white and unreadable. One log entry remained: mod?


---

What I did next

I copied everything onto three drives. I labeled them. I put one in a lockbox at a bank. I told my immediate circle where to find them and how to verify the checksums. I stopped opening the files for a while.

Two nights ago, when the inability to look stopped filling my chest with panic, I opened the folder on my laptop in the safe room with the door locked and the lights off. On the table in front of me, under the light, the Polaroid I’d kept since the first one had been shoved under my door was face-down. I didn't remember placing it there. I turned it over.

The sticky note, once black marker and heavy, had new writing in pencil beneath the printed line:

mod?

I don't know who wrote that. I don't know how it got there. I don't know whether this file first wrote the text, or if the text is an echo of some human fear that typed the word and then vanished.


---

I am leaving with this

If this stays up, it will persist as a record. If it goes down, look at the accounts that engaged in the hour before the removal. If some of the names change to [deleted] and their last action is a frozen typing…, please know that a set of gaps has become louder than the words.

I am not telling anyone to do anything. I am not offering instructions. I am reporting what I found on my brother’s computer, and what followed. Ask questions if you want; I am reading. If you find artifacts, please be careful. If someone you know goes quiet after later typing typing…, call them. Knock on their door.

The last line in my brother’s file, the one I copied and then hesitated to reproduce, is an unfinished sentence. It ends with — and then the file stops. Every time I re-open the copy I carry, small changes appear. I don't know whether the changes are coming from the network or from me. I only know that the thing — the pattern of redactions, of [MOD], of frozen typing and deleted replies — collects attention.

It wants questions. It wants the word. If you say it aloud or type it into a box, I will have no power to stop what follows. I am posting this because I am tired of keeping my mouth shut and because someone needs to know. If this post disappears, check the names that were active before it did.

I know a lot of people who believe that living with their friends is the best thing. Although this bias can work in a few cases, mostly it doesn’t. Speaking from experience I lived in a dorm with an assigned roommate last year who I consider a good friend but definitely not a good roommate. When I voiced my concerns it didn’t go well (I have posted about an incident on my profile) and it also impacted our friendship too. 


In my opinion, a more formal or low-stakes friendship can actually make for a great roommate. When friendships run deeper, there’s always the risk that living together can turn the relationship sour over time. That said, if a close friend is genuinely receptive to your concerns and willing to compromise, they can absolutely be an excellent roommate. In my experience, though, most friendships tend to flourish best in settings where there’s some healthy distance like meeting up for coffee, going out to dinner, traveling together, or spending time at social gatherings rather than sharing the same living space.

Barista express was on sale for Black Friday. Loved it the last month but came back from vacation and the hot water dispenser doesn’t work at all. Not a huge deal but it’s too expensive of a machine for any part of it to not work. So I’m going to return it. 

But now I’m trapped in a vortex of possibilities. For $600-800 I can make a lot of combinations of grinder + espresso maker. 

I’m a bit overwhelmed. I feel like I honed my technique a good bit and learned a lot over the last month of making daily espresso. I’m more practical than perfectionistic about it And I’m not trying to spend $4-5k. But I also began to understand the limitations of an entry level machine fairly quickly. 

So where do I go next? What are the key decision points?

Some people learn steadiness later in life.

Others, like me, learned it far too young.

I didn’t grow up with the luxury of falling apart without consequences. Smile at everyone. Always. Stern look if you even thought of misbehaving. Speak to everyone who approaches you. Go into the audience and stir up conversation. Having a rough day? Hold it in and smile. Be your bubbly self. Always be busy. I could make articulate conversation with people decades my senior as a child. I was the expectation to.

I learned early how to regulate myself, how to listen between lines, how to be calm even when I felt a hurricane inside. I became reliable before I even understood what reliable meant. I could calm a person who was shedding their heart in front of me. And I did. Many times. 

And because of that, the way I choose now in adulthood is different.

I choose quietly. When the world rewards noise without rhythm, words without meaning, and plans without action, I gently excuse myself. 

I don’t choose impulsively. That only works if you are trying out a new restaurant, or a new tea or coffee flavor, not life choices. 

I choose with the same quiet deliberateness that shaped me as a child. This time I choose. I am a fast learner. And I learn well.

What choosing looks like for me now?

I had to train myself. Just like any other muscle on my body. I observe, then I narrow it down. Scattering my attention is energy that I cannot get back, therefore, I cannot afford to give away whimsically. Fewer people equals deeper presence with each person, which leads to a better chance of a bonding connection. I do not value quantity, I value quality. 

I don’t overpromise intimacy just to draw someone’s attention or to keep them. That’s time, energy, and a part of my mind and body that I cannot afford to lose. Or to fill the silence. I am in no rush to fill the silence. I like silence. I love it, actually. 

If it’s “not yet,” I say “not yet,” instead of pretending otherwise. If it’s a “no,” then I won’t apologize if it’s crossing a boundary that I set for myself. 

My amends are spoken plainly. “Here is how interpret what you are saying, here is what I think about the situation and my thought process, let’s pinpoint our misalignment, and here’s how I’ll adjust.“ All the while checking in with you because this is not a soliloquy type of situation.

My attention returns on its own. If I’m here, I’m here for real. You have my undivided attention. I am present. Not looking at the ceiling, or my phone, or other people, or forward. My eyes will stay on you. 

My pace is not distance or avoidance, it’s care. And communicating that early on is being considerate of others time and peace of mind, as well as myself. 

I don’t rush what I want to last forever. I’m like a parfait(not an onion). I’m layered. You won’t get the whole dessert at once. But if we make it to a place that we bond, you will get all of me. That’s protection. Not defensiveness. 

I let clarity catch up to chemistry so desire has somewhere safe to land when we choose, and when that moment belongs to us. Not some artificial timeline that society tells us we must follow to be “normal.”

I’m slow because I respect a deep connection too much to jeopardize it when I do eventually find it. 

How would you know I am choosing you?

I create predictable touch points. You’ll never doubt my intentions. We’ve finally found each other, and I am not letting you go by my lack of actionable steps. Steadiness and consistent communication. Renewable actions. 

My questions and speech patterns will deepen depending what I intuit from you each time we are in each other’s presence. Did I mention I’m extremely capable of observing? I’m not trying to interrogate you, but more so to understand your architecture(what makes you, you) and your structure(what keeps you, you). 

I fold you into my real life which includes my routines, my down-time activities, my steady corners, and my hobbies.

I protect the container. The bond. No back-up plans, no back-up people, no rollercoaster loops, no mixed signals.

Your body notices first. It always does. Even before your brain. Less tension, easier breath, a sense of “this feels so safe… why does it feel so safe?” If you are like me, you want to understand the reasoning underneath it so you can understand and prolong it.  

What does commitment feel like with me?

Calm devotion. Unquestionable loyalty. Deep connection. Fierce protection. 

Accountability without spiraling to get there. 

Hard conversations that make us more aligned, not more distant. Easy conversations that feel like it still adds substance. 

Affection that is consistent instead of dramatic. Intense, yes, but in a healthy way. I know how I love. My family and friends know how I love. And I know how to channel that consuming affection and devotion into something healthy and regenerative with a partner. 

Ordinary days that feel warm, lived-in, steady… like us. 

I know how to take care of someone I love.

With intention, with care, with empathy and kindness, and with softness. 

In the many ways that make a man’s nervous system finally unclench. Finally relax. Finally exhale. 

What I won’t do is perform romance to distract from instability. I actually want romance, so building it correctly from inception is paramount. 

I won’t keep someone on hold while I look for newness or excitement. This also doesn’t mean committing too quickly. But it does mean being intentional to not waste peoples time and energy. 

I won’t Confuse butterflies or excitement with compatibility. I get excitement from seeing a wonderfully made Bananas Foster that tastes like heaven. But that doesn’t mean I am going to petition the courts to make marriage to a dessert legal and normalized. (By the way, there may or may not be a petition going around to appeal to the courts to make marriage to a dessert legal and completely normalized.)

And lastly, I do not pretend to be ready for more than I can sustain. That is about integrity, which I value. 

I’m not building a hallway of almosts.

I’m building one home. Many rooms. Each room its own intimate message. Slowly, intentionally, honestly, with the person whose steadiness feels like it was shaped in the same place mine was.

If you grew steady too soon, too, you will recognize this pace.

You will recognize this softness.

And you will recognize me.

Because people who were built this way don’t need butterflies to find each other. Just one post. 

We return by pattern.

We choose by truth.

We stay by devotion.

1q1jpv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q1jpv8/10_years_without_alcohol/,10 years without alcohol!,"Ten years ago today, my hundredth (?) attempt at quitting stuck. This was half a year after seeing an addiction therapist for several months and maybe four years after voluntarily putting myself in an outpatient treatment program I never finished. It was also after half a dozen failed attempts to stop myself with disulfiram/Antabuse. 

I was sick of hating myself. I was sick of sweating in cold rooms. I was sick of daily hangovers. I was sick of spending money I didn’t have to drink in the middle of the day. I was sick of my ridiculous behaviors around alcohol. And I think I had finally convinced myself that there was absolutely no upside to alcohol and that drinking it again would be like setting my hair on fire - extremely self-harmful.

So I listened to a hypnosis track every night while I was falling asleep for the first eight months and I allowed myself to pick up other addictive (but benign) habits like drinking waaay too much coffee and watching as much TV as I wanted guilt-free. I joined a dance team and a gym to keep myself busy.

I didn’t do AA or any other program. I didn’t want to sit around talking about alcohol or to tell myself I was powerless. I didn’t want to be thinking about booze at all - that was the \*point\* of quitting. 

For the first few years, I’m sure the fact that I didn’t drink popped into my head at least once a day, if not 10. Now I rarely have that thought. Being a non-drinker isn’t a core part of my identity. I don’t crave alcohol and I’m not triggered by it. It simply isn’t interesting to me in the slightest. 

I realize I may be very lucky in this regard, but I share that as encouragement for those who want to quit but feel like they will be forced to struggle with their addiction for the rest of their lives.  (I worried about this a lot.) That’s not a foregone conclusion. 

Now I’m a triathlete, an Ironman, a a person who ran two marathons in the last two months, a respected leader in my field, an awesome organizer of people, an extremely reliable friend, 70 pounds lighter, basically the picture of health, and extremely proud of myself. 

So I’m here to celebrate myself and my decade, and to encourage anyone who’s still fighting these particular demons. It is SO much better on the other side, and you CAN do it. Even if you failed the first 99 times.

I don't think I'm bad at conversing; people usually characterize me as being considerate and a good listener, but I still feel like I'm doing something wrong, at least sometimes. 

My post-analysis of basically every conversation is basically ""Hmm, I didn't ask them that same question they asked me there"" and I'm afraid I might seem self-absorbed because of it? I guess my thought-process is that people will build on what I say and answer in kind. My mind doesn't just always think to explicitly ask the question back, and the conversation flows so easily and quickly that this only occurs to me after the fact. It's not that I always neglect asking the same question back, and I do put in a lot of effort in conversations (I also ask them questions of my own), but part of me just struggles with it.

My friend (30F) and I were planning to hang out in the city, in which she knows all the cozy places. She asked if I liked coffee and tea, to which I responded that I love tea and that I basically drink it nonstop at home. I think that would be enough for her to go off, but the conversation kind of died (in part because of personal stuff and the holidays). We have a mutual and outspoken understanding that it's okay to wait a bit to respond if you need the time or space. But since my text was the last one, I still keep wondering if I should have responded with ""yes, *and you*?"".

About me: I’m an early career professional currently working at a law firm. I’m big on individual study to grasp concepts, but also big on study groups for commitment and community benefits. 



For that reason, I’m putting together a small study group (3-5 individuals) in Toronto. The idea is to meet occasionally to share progress, study individually in a common space, talk CFA and career, and just make this endeavour a bit less lonely. We can start online to build rapport first. 



**This is for you if:**

\-You’re absolutely committed to taking the exam (registered or will register soon)

\-You’re open to meeting in person for group study sessions every now and then 

\-Those pursuing L1/2/3 are welcome. Any exam date is welcome. The common denominator is commitment



**This is NOT for you if:**

\-You’ve not made the decision to pursue the CFA designation yet

🤣 Yeah—that leap is wild. “Recursion = wanting.” Nah. Loops don’t want coffee; they just loop.

Correct. Recursion is a structural operation, not a motivational state. It refines outputs under constraints. Desire requires preference, valuation, persistence—none of which are implied by iteration.

People keep mistaking feedback for feelings. A thermostat doesn’t crave warmth; it compares numbers and flips a switch.

Not expecting anyone to read this but for some reason posting online makes it seem more real. Hmm. But for that reason, it will probably be poorly written and all over the place. 

Watched this ""Fix your destructive mindset in 15 mins"" by Anne-Laure Le Cunff today and it was helpful! [https://bigthinkmedia.substack.com/p/fix-your-destructive-mindset-in-15](https://bigthinkmedia.substack.com/p/fix-your-destructive-mindset-in-15) 

Thinking of tiny experiments I could do, and I also want to work on my ""All or Nothing"" way of thinking. I love going to the gym and lifting heavy but I find that if I don't have time for it, I don't even bother with a quick home bodyweight workout, so I end up only lifting 1-2x a month during the semester and I never make any progress, etc. 

A couple weeks ago I walked on the treadmill with my friend for like 45 minutes and the time flew by, it was great yapping away w/ them. And we had done some lifting together before but it had been a while, so the treadmill felt like the best way to get to the gym w/o stress of space in the weight area, etc. I know January is going to be crazy at the gym, so my plan for this month is to not worry about lifting heavy but just go to the gym to use the treadmill with (or without) my friend a couple times a week, and do home bodyweight routines 3-4x a week (they only take 20-25 minutes). 

I want to take some classes or lessons, need to figure out what. Every couple years I take a short class in something I'm interested in, 5 years ago it was a wood working class, last year it was a comedy acting class (way out of my comfort zone), and both were great experiences, so I want to continue that but make it more frequent haha. Might take singing or piano lessons?

Other goals: need to write more music. Need to read more. Need to scroll less (I deleted IG off my phone mid-Dec and can only look on the browser, and that has been amazing for my mental health, but now I'm addicted to playing FreeCell on my phone... and I still scroll on Reddit even in the phone browser, ugh. I gotta use my Freedom app more).

**Fitness Stats & Goals**  
Current stats: 5'1"" F, 157.2 lbs, GW 130

Diet goals: Eat 2k calories for this week, cut to 1900 cal after a week, maybe go as low as 1800 unless I keep the activity levels up. I have used Lose It to track in the past, resumed tracking yesterday.

Workout goals: 12k steps a day, bodyweight workouts 3-4x a week, start lifting again in February, but continue BW workouts when I can't make it to gym. 

January goals: 10 consecutive real push ups with good form, 1 real pull up lol 

**Mental Health & Creativity Goals**  
Get up at 8am (might push this until when the semester starts, I am not a morning person and I set my own hours over winter break...), do Morning pages every day in January, read a bit, black coffee only

Do a little bit of music before I start working on stuff for others (prepping for class, grading, emails, etc). At least 10 minutes of just making some random music or practicing an instrument first thing. 

Go to more shows, be more active in the community. Concrete thing I will do, start a Physical Media club (sort of like a book club but also includes watching movies / listening to CDs and records, sharing knowledge, etc). 

**What I accomplished today / yesterday**  
(I guess some things make more sense to post from previous day, we'll see how this part of the post works out if I keep it up daily lmao)  
\-walked 13,176 steps (so far) today / 14,929 yesterday  
\-ate 2235 cal / 2051 net yesterday (-184 from exercise according to FitBit, do you guys count that for calories?  know some people recommend not doing this but I get so hungry if I don't UGH)  
\-did a BW workout yesterday AND today! found some good routines on the Hevy app and didn't feel sore today  
\-messed around on Ableton for about 10-15 minutes, found some cool ideas  
\-did a morning page (my notebook is too big so one page honestly feels like enough for now lol), read a bit of *On Looking: A Walker's Guide to the Art of Observation*, by Alexandra Horowitz   
\-went for a walk around the park with my lovely partner to get some fresh, cold air haha, got the rest of my steps on the tiny home treadmill

My teaching schedule is all afternoon or later classes so I will hopefully be able to keep up my morning home workout routine! 

Okay that's enough typing I think. Maybe tomorrow I'll type up some of the stuff I accomplished last year, I am definitely one to forget all the good things I did but remember all the shit I messed up / didn't do, etc. Need to stop comparing and despairing. Also is all of this going to go into AI training? I miss blogging in the early 2000s, and the internet of that time, lol.

The first six weeks were honestly the roughest weeks of my life (LO is 8 weeks now, so this might still be premature and there very well might be very hard times ahead but this is a snapshot of right now). My husband and I have never been pushed like this. We’ve never fought this much in our 10+ years together. I'm sleep deprived, anxious all the time, and feel like I'm barely surviving most days.

This past week though… something small has shifted. I’m starting to understand what people mean when they say “enjoy it” (which used to make me want to scream, ha). It’s not that it’s suddenly not hard anymore. It’s just that there are moments now where I can actually see the beauty instead of only the hard.

So I’m trying to really notice those moments and not stew in everything that’s been brutal.

This was my morning.

For the past week, LO has been doing a longer first stretch of sleep in the evening, which means I’m getting more sleep. 2-3 hour stretch instead of an hour! And wow… sleep changes everything. I'm the past week she’s also suddenly been okay with me leaving her awake in her bassinet in the mornings for about 20–30 minutes between 6 and 7:30 so I use this time to shower, do my skincare, and get myself organised (pack my downstairs bag, collect the mountain of dirty burp cloths and clothes). It honestly feels luxurious.

Once we’re downstairs, I pop her in her pram with the toys clipped in above her and turn the rocker on so they move a bit. That’s me giving her a bit of independent time while I make myself a coffee. I also make my husband a coffee in a takeaway cup so he has a hot coffee waiting when he eventually comes downstairs around 10 or 11. His “on” shift doesn’t end until 3am, so this is how he can get some solid sleep to recoup and then support me better from late morning and throughout the day (he does go back to work in two weeks...so I have no idea what that will look like...).

At 7:45am, LO is in her sleep sack, dummy in, pram rocking. I’m sitting next to her on the lounge with my coffee. Fleetwood Mac is playing softly through the speakers. And she’s falling asleep on her own.

I’m just sitting there taking it in...writing this.

Mornings like this, she is such an angel. Hardly any crying, lots of smiles (no laughs yet), and it just feels like we’re in sync. I know this won’t be every day. I know tomorrow could be chaos again. But right now, this moment feels really, really good.

I drank a lot of wine last night while cooking New Year’s Eve dinner for my family. I ate too much, drank too much, and was barely hanging on by the time the last guest left around 9:30. I wanted so badly to make it to midnight. I wanted my last drink—my final glass of champagne at midnight. Instead, I was passed out in bed by 10.
This morning I woke up to an open bottle of champagne in the fridge, missing about one modest glass. I made huevos rancheros for breakfast. Man, mimosas would’ve been perfect—but I white-knuckled it. I tried everything to distract myself. I hydrated. I drank coffee. I made Sleepytime tea with honey. I watched my show. I tried so hard to forget that bottle of champagne and the fact that it was New Year’s Day and I should be able to have some.

In the end, it was the beef bourguignon that got me. I made it for dinner last night and had so much left. But I’d read on this sub that 85% of the alcohol remains… so how could I start Dry January while eating wine soup? Might as well start tomorrow, right? And if I was going to eat the stew, I might as well finish the champagne too… obviously.

One bottle of champagne and most of a bottle of Bordeaux later, it looks like Dry January starts on January 2nd.

For what it’s worth, I did the same thing last year. Dry January started on January 2nd and turned into Dry February. I relapsed after that. Got sober again in September. Relapsed again in October.

My goal this year is a dry 2026. One day does not matter. January 2nd is just as magical as January 1st. I can do this. You can do this. It’s not all contingent on January 1st—it’s about consistency, and never stopping trying.

Keep trying.

1q1j9w1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1j9w1,Amy’s Diary – Thursday (New Year’s Day 🎆),"Dear Diary,

Today was New Year’s Day, and it felt like the house woke up smiling.

No alarms.
No rushing.
Just soft light, quiet laughter, and everyone slowly finding their way into the living room.

My belly woke up too, of course.

blorp.

“Yes,” I whispered. “It’s a new year.”

Morning – Everyone, All at Once

Mom—Christina—was already up, wearing her white top, moving calmly between the kitchen and the table like she always does. She smiled when she saw me.

“Happy New Year, Amy.”

My belly replied before I did.

grrrp.

She laughed. “Breakfast first.”

One by one, my sisters appeared:

Jennifer came in wearing her orange shirt, energetic even before coffee.

Vicky, in her red top, looked bright and cheerful, humming softly.

Melissa, wrapped in her green top and white scarf, brought warmth just by standing there.

Heather, in her purple top, quiet and gentle, gave Mom a small smile that said everything.

Gillian, casual in her white singlet and blue jeans, stretched and yawned.

Linda, neat in her yellow suit, already thinking about plans and lists.

Nina, in her black top and black skirt, scrolling on her phone but listening to everything.

Shelley, comfy in her brown t-shirt and brown pants, brought the snacks.

The room felt full—in the best way.

Breakfast – New Year, Same Belly

We sat together for breakfast.

I tried to sit up straight and behave.

My belly had other plans.

I leaned forward to grab toast.

fwump.

My stomach gently bumped the table.

Jennifer laughed. “New year, same Amy.”

“Consistency is important,” I said.

Heather smiled quietly at me. “At least you’re reliable.”

Midday – Talking About the Year Ahead

After breakfast, we stayed together, just talking.

No big speeches.
No resolutions shouted out loud.

Mom asked simple questions: “What are you looking forward to?” “What do you hope for this year?”

Everyone answered in their own way.

Some serious.
Some funny.
Some quiet.

Heather didn’t say much, but when Mom put her arm around her, she leaned in just a little.

I noticed.

My belly stayed quiet—just a soft blorp, like it was listening too.

Afternoon – Light, Laughter, and Leftovers

In the afternoon, sunlight filled the house.

There were leftovers from the holidays, which meant my belly felt very confident.

I sat on the floor with Shelley and Nina, sharing snacks.

My stomach slowly relaxed into a comfortable plooof.

Vicky looked over. “That looks like the official New Year’s pose.”

“I’m welcoming the year,” I said.

Linda nodded. “With enthusiasm.”

Evening – A Gentle Start

As the sky darkened, fireworks popped in the distance—leftover celebrations from the night before.

We stood by the window together for a moment.

No countdown.
No shouting.

Just watching.

Mom stood in the middle of us, and I leaned against her side.

My belly made one last tiny sound.

blorp.

She patted it gently. “Alright, little one. We hear you.”

Night – New Year’s Thought

Now I’m in bed.

It doesn’t feel like a dramatic beginning.

It feels… warm.

Like the year opened its door quietly and said,
“Come in when you’re ready.”

I think I like that.

And my belly?

It’s calm.
For now.

Love,
Amy ✨💙🎆",1,1767311982.0,u_FunRestaurant3384,0,1.0,False

Freshly brewed coffee uses real coffee beans, ground and brewed properly.
Key differences:
Better aroma
Less bitterness
More natural sweetness
Actual flavors (chocolate, nuts, fruit)

1q1j81r,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1q1j81r/im_exhausted_and_frustrated_rant/,im exhausted and frustrated (rant),"So ive been working at starbucks since august now, i wouldn’t say im a pro at making drinks but on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being i dont know what a cappuccino is and 10 being im a god at making coffee with amazing speed, i would put myself on a solid 7 

I still have to learn and i don’t expect to be on bar all the time but its just disheartening and disappointing that lately every shift i have, i get put on drive thru or anywhere except bar

only a couple of my SSVs actually put me on bar but every other SSV just puts me on drive thru(today ive been on dt my ENTIRE 7 hour shift)

I dont like seeing my coworkers clocking in and being put on bar immediately and they rarely get dt or anything. im not hating cuz i understand that they’ve been here longer and they would be better than me, but its just frustrating that my SSVs dont even let me stay on bar if they sense a hint of rush coming

im planning on discussing this with my manager now since this has become a pattern, i just feel bad that im telling on my SSVs but its so cold where i am from that dt has made me hate working here when otherwise, i enjoy working at starbucks

1q1j7hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1q1j7hh/im_in_love_with_my_ex_and_i_messed_up/,I’m in love with my ex and I messed up.,"*TW Miscarriage*

I 27 M was with my ex 25 F for just over a year. We first met through a mutual friend, and were both in relationships at the time. When we met we instantly clicked, not in a romantic way but like we had known each other for years. We was around each other a few times, and I will admit I had a little bit of a crush on her. 

A few years later we were both single and matched on a dating app. We started talking and again instantly clicked. We started sleeping together and it was just meant to be casual, as my previous relationship had ended a few years ago and had broken me. 

As soon as we spent the day together I instantly knew I liked her, and that I wanted her to be in my life. 

We were dating for a few months before I officially asked her to be my girlfriend. However we were being careless one night, and I ended up getting her pregnant. We both take the blame for this one, we should have been more careful. 

Just before Christmas we found out she was pregnant, she was crying and in shock thinking that I would leave here. She didn’t think she would ever get pregnant, and I never thought this would happen to me. I was so excited to be a dad. 

I told my family and my parents responded with “you always find a way to surprise us”. My sister took it really hard she started crying, asked who’s it was then started accusing her of being a gold digger. 

I know this woman and she is not like that, she insists on paying for almost everything. For my birthday she bought me a hamper of all my favorite drinks and sweets, carefully picking each thing as it was hand made. Even my family ate them. She cooks home made food for me every day, does my washing, cleans the house, food shops and makes the house a home (on top of a working a full time job). 

We were planning on moving in together because of the baby, and I had just bought the house when at 9 weeks we suddenly lost the baby. She was absolutely devastated, all she could think about was making sure I was ok, even helping me decorate my house hours after miscarrying the baby. 

After this happened in the space of 12 months she lost the baby, her uncle died, her grandmother who helped raise her died, she got into a car accident (the car was t-boned and the car was wrecked, but walked away fine some how) and to tend the year she lost her grandad. 

Seeing her fall into depression was such a hard thing to watch, I was struggling myself. This turned into us arguing because we was grieving apart, she would get upset because I wouldn’t feel like I was a dad. She’s a mum of course she is she carried my baby, I just won’t understand that feeling. 

I could see it eating away at her, a shell of who she once was. She was having a hard time with her manager at work on top of this, making inappropriate comments and trying to make her feel pressured to quit. I just really wanted her to get help. My sister got pregnant and this seemed to hit her hard, my sister wasn’t planning on having any but she got pregnant just after we lost ours. 

We ended up arguing over something little, it blew up into a big argument to a point I screamed in her face, and she got scared and threw something to the other side of the room. I ended the relationship there. 
This really broke me and I could see it broke her too, I made her move out the next day. 

For a few weeks we would argue back and forth, then we slept together. Lots was going on with my family and she was there supporting me. I decided to cut contact as I was emotionally burnt out. 

A few days later the woman who cleans my parents house broke down, I went over to help her. My mum had been telling her what had been going on with my ex, so we started talking then we slept together. It was meant to be casual but then she started pushing me into a relationship. We had always got on and that so I thought why not, I even tried to get on her kids good side and get to know them and step up. 

One day she started asking questions like “if the baby was still here, would you have made it work with your ex” and then saying my ex had asked her friends about her. Which is strange because she didn’t know we was together, or know any of her friends. Then she told me that when we was at my mums house once my ex gave her a dirty look. Turns out when we was play fighting my ex told me “it’s not appropriate I am not comfortable”, and I explained that was just our relationship and had been since we got closer just before me and the ex got together. The ex then gave her a look to say “I am clocking what you are doing pack it in”. She admitted that she had been flirting with me the whole time, even when I was with my ex but I had just been oblivious. 

She went silent and then broke it off with me. I was already feeling guilty about the way I had treated my ex, and I now felt how she felt. So I called her and apologised, I admitted everything and she cried. I had forgot that the day I called was the one year anniversary of her gran passing away, and was a week away from what would have been our child’s 1st birthday. She was bawling her eyes out and could nearly even talk to me, I could hear the pain in her cries.

I called her every day after, for the week to check in on her and see how she was doing. 

I went away for a bit so didn’t talk to her, but I looked at her social media. She seems to have been doing so well in the time that I had blocked her out my life. She was going out again, making new friends and I saw her smiling again. 

A month later we met up because I had letters of hers, we went for coffee and was just talking. I offered to give her a lift home, she accepted. Long story short we slept together, and she stayed at mine. She has been staying ever since. 

I gave her a key to my house, so she can come and go as she pleases. She leaves her tooth brush at mine, she even has her own draw. 

Non of my family know though, I just don’t want to answer questions. They seem to not like her even though she did nothing wrong, but she even pointed out to me when we was together, they never made an effort to spend time with her. Which I will agree with, she was only ever there with me and they never really knew anything about her. Not that she didn’t like fish, or lamb but they would still give her these dishes. 

When she’s around she cooks and cleans, she will buy me things she knows I like. We dance in the kitchen like we used to, I find comfort in cuddling up to her. In a morning when I turn over to cuddle her, she isn’t there and I start to panic. I have accidentally said 4 times that I love her, I do mean it I’m just worried. She hasn’t said it back. 

I keep telling her, I have love for her and I care really deeply about her. I can’t imagine my life without her. I just don’t want a relationship, I’m sick of being hurt and I need to put myself first. What we have works right now for us, but if she can’t do this I will have to walk away. I’m scare to get hurt again, but I love and adore her she’s the mother of my child.

1q1j3zm,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1q1j3zm/im_in_love_with_my_ex_and_i_messed_up_long_story/,I’m in love with my ex and I messed up. (Long story),"*TW Miscarriage*

I 27 M was with my ex 25 F for just over a year. We first met through a mutual friend, and were both in relationships at the time. When we met we instantly clicked, not in a romantic way but like we had known each other for years. We was around each other a few times, and I will admit I had a little bit of a crush on her. 

A few years later we were both single and matched on a dating app. We started talking and again instantly clicked. We started sleeping together and it was just meant to be casual, as my previous relationship had ended a few years ago and had broken me. 

As soon as we spent the day together I instantly knew I liked her, and that I wanted her to be in my life. 

We were dating for a few months before I officially asked her to be my girlfriend. However we were being careless one night, and I ended up getting her pregnant. We both take the blame for this one, we should have been more careful. 

Just before Christmas we found out she was pregnant, she was crying and in shock thinking that I would leave here. She didn’t think she would ever get pregnant, and I never thought this would happen to me. I was so excited to be a dad. 

I told my family and my parents responded with “you always find a way to surprise us”. My sister took it really hard she started crying, asked who’s it was then started accusing her of being a gold digger. 

I know this woman and she is not like that, she insists on paying for almost everything. For my birthday she bought me a hamper of all my favorite drinks and sweets, carefully picking each thing as it was hand made. Even my family ate them. She cooks home made food for me every day, does my washing, cleans the house, food shops and makes the house a home (on top of a working a full time job). 

We were planning on moving in together because of the baby, and I had just bought the house when at 9 weeks we suddenly lost the baby. She was absolutely devastated, all she could think about was making sure I was ok, even helping me decorate my house hours after miscarrying the baby. 

After this happened in the space of 12 months she lost the baby, her uncle died, her grandmother who helped raise her died, she got into a car accident (the car was t-boned and the car was wrecked, but walked away fine some how) and to tend the year she lost her grandad. 

Seeing her fall into depression was such a hard thing to watch, I was struggling myself. This turned into us arguing because we was grieving apart, she would get upset because I wouldn’t feel like I was a dad. She’s a mum of course she is she carried my baby, I just won’t understand that feeling. 

I could see it eating away at her, a shell of who she once was. She was having a hard time with her manager at work on top of this, making inappropriate comments and trying to make her feel pressured to quit. I just really wanted her to get help. My sister got pregnant and this seemed to hit her hard, my sister wasn’t planning on having any but she got pregnant just after we lost ours. 

We ended up arguing over something little, it blew up into a big argument to a point I screamed in her face, and she got scared and threw something to the other side of the room. I ended the relationship there. 
This really broke me and I could see it broke her too, I made her move out the next day. 

For a few weeks we would argue back and forth, then we slept together. Lots was going on with my family and she was there supporting me. I decided to cut contact as I was emotionally burnt out. 

A few days later the woman who cleans my parents house broke down, I went over to help her. My mum had been telling her what had been going on with my ex, so we started talking then we slept together. It was meant to be casual but then she started pushing me into a relationship. We had always got on and that so I thought why not, I even tried to get on her kids good side and get to know them and step up. 

One day she started asking questions like “if the baby was still here, would you have made it work with your ex” and then saying my ex had asked her friends about her. Which is strange because she didn’t know we was together, or know any of her friends. Then she told me that when we was at my mums house once my ex gave her a dirty look. Turns out when we was play fighting my ex told me “it’s not appropriate I am not comfortable”, and I explained that was just our relationship and had been since we got closer just before me and the ex got together. The ex then gave her a look to say “I am clocking what you are doing pack it in”. She admitted that she had been flirting with me the whole time, even when I was with my ex but I had just been oblivious. 

She went silent and then broke it off with me. I was already feeling guilty about the way I had treated my ex, and I now felt how she felt. So I called her and apologised, I admitted everything and she cried. I had forgot that the day I called was the one year anniversary of her gran passing away, and was a week away from what would have been our child’s 1st birthday. She was bawling her eyes out and could nearly even talk to me, I could hear the pain in her cries.

I called her every day after, for the week to check in on her and see how she was doing. 

I went away for a bit so didn’t talk to her, but I looked at her social media. She seems to have been doing so well in the time that I had blocked her out my life. She was going out again, making new friends and I saw her smiling again. 

A month later we met up because I had letters of hers, we went for coffee and was just talking. I offered to give her a lift home, she accepted. Long story short we slept together, and she stayed at mine. She has been staying ever since. 

I gave her a key to my house, so she can come and go as she pleases. She leaves her tooth brush at mine, she even has her own draw. 

Non of my family know though, I just don’t want to answer questions. They seem to not like her even though she did nothing wrong, but she even pointed out to me when we was together, they never made an effort to spend time with her. Which I will agree with, she was only ever there with me and they never really knew anything about her. Not that she didn’t like fish, or lamb but they would still give her these dishes. 

When she’s around she cooks and cleans, she will buy me things she knows I like. We dance in the kitchen like we used to, I find comfort in cuddling up to her. In a morning when I turn over to cuddle her, she isn’t there and I start to panic. I have accidentally said 4 times that I love her, I do mean it I’m just worried. She hasn’t said it back. 

I keep telling her, I have love for her and I care really deeply about her. I can’t imagine my life without her. I just don’t want a relationship, I’m sick of being hurt and I need to put myself first. What we have works right now for us, but if she can’t do this I will have to walk away. I’m scare to get hurt again, but I love and adore her she’s the mother of my child.

1q1j2yo,https://i.redd.it/l830psqcstag1.jpeg,How Did the Community Learn of the Connection to A.W.?,"I'm replaying Control again after a few years and I'm one again finding myself fascinated by the amount of world building Remedy achieved here, particularly the connection to Alan Wake. 

I'm ashamed to say I slept on this game for *years* after its release and didn't really follow it closely during its marketing and 2019 launch, so I wasn't part of the discussions at the time. I didn't even play Alan Wake for the first time until a couple of weeks ago. 

So I'm curious how much fans knew about the connection to Alan Wake going into the game. I don't think Remedy marketed the game as taking place in the same universe as AW-- were fans just surprised to learn of it while playing? Also, what tipped people off? Was it this document (pictured) in the game which makes explicit reference to Alan Wake, or are there other clues dropped earlier in the game that I overlooked?

Please note: I have *not* played Alan Wake 2, so if you could avoid any spoilers I'd really, truly appreciate it. 😅",16,1767311466.0,controlgame,10,0.94,False

1q1ix74,https://www.reddit.com/r/biglaw/comments/1q1ix74/how_to_delegate/,How to delegate,"Apologies for the bad typing. 

I’m a midlvl and I got some feedback whilst grabbing a cup of coffee with a partner. My work is done well, good hours, I have file ownership and I respond well to clients and colleagues, I got one bit of harsh feedback:

Im not good at delegating to juniors which either makes them turn in subpar quality work, or I need to redo it. The partner is concerned I will burn out due to the amount of extra work this takes me.

This is something I know. I am quite laissez-faire with juniors, since I had a horrible start as a lawyer at my first firm (switched a year ago, now fourth year). I try to make working with me pleasant for juniors because they have a lot on their plate, I notice that and try to protect them a bit since I didnt have that. Most juniors in our group like working with me, since they can safely turn in below quality work as I am relaxed and know I can fix most things they do. This does mean however that I often have to redo their work completely at bad moments (with deadlines nearing) or well into the night. Not something I want, but I am trying to learn how to make them live up to my standards.

One junior especially takes the cake on how to not do it. I work often with him as one of the partners adores this junior, seeing himself in him. He likes that I take care of his ‘protège’, so he can see what quality of work and file ownership means (nice compliment to me). The thing is that he really turns in trash and when I offer to look with him at the issue at hand, he never responds. Instead, he dumps it off COD/EOD. So far I was able to catch his little mishaps/unresponsiveness, but I want them (juniors) to know whats happening in a file and how they would (try to) mitigate issues. 

Im getting sick and tired of it, because he cannot draft to save his life and he does not know how to manage matters. Every time things fall of his plate because he just doesn’t get it. A while ago I was on a two day leave, we receive a response to our settlement offer. He forwards it a day later to our client with the message we will review and revert. First of all, at least try to explain (high lvl) what the response was, second he just left it till I came back. Its just so frustrating.

I went from a V10 to a lower V, so I get that quality and motivation is lower, but I just don’t know what to do.

Can y’all give me some honest advice? I want to be better at delegating, and how to manage people that do not want to be delegated?

1q1ivkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q1ivkl/i_talk_about_true_crime_for_a_living_this_case/,I Talk About True Crime For A Living. This Case Won’t Let Me Sleep [Part 1],"‘*Savage disemboweling in church. The crime is suspected to have been a ritual, police say. Victim severely injured, but in stable condition after intensive seventeen-hour surgery. Doctors speaking of medical miracle. Perpetrator still on the loose.*’

My friend and co-host had sent me a link to an article from a Polish news site. It was more of a stump, loosely translated with a shitty online translator, but I got the jist of it. The article spoke of a small college town in the west. God knows how she even found it. She was good at unearthing obscure cases like these. That’s what we focused on with our true crime channel. Not your Dahmers or Bundys, not even your Jack The Rippers. We had decided early on to cover the unknown horrors, and as a channel located in America, it usually sent us down more international cases.

“A ritual? Like, satanic and stuff?” I texted back.

“Sounds like it. That interesting to you?” 

I thought about it. We hadn’t yet covered an explicitly religious case. While religion surely played part in some of the cases, the ones with a particularly extreme upbringing that often led to domestic abuse, something that sounded like an offering to some God was new. It was sealed, we would cover this story.

Through my co-host’s friend who acted as our translator we contacted the hospital that currently held the victim. She asked for a ‘Miss Cymerman’, as my co-host found out after a long night of research, and we managed to negotiate a visit. She even talked to her over the phone, ensuring that she was okay with us conducting an interview, though she told us Miss Cymerman didn’t sound too enthusiastic. She was very indifferent to how we would conduct it, seemingly okay with everything as long as we organized it. Not annoyed, just sounding tired. We had first considered a video call. That’s how we usually did it. Obviously, it was comfortable and convenient, most accessible for each party. My excitement piqued at the idea of finding out what had happened immediately, but after mulling it over we figured this situation required a more sensitive approach. One of us would travel there, and I volunteered. My co-host’s friend assured me that Miss Cymerman spoke enough English to where I shouldn’t have any problems. It would be fine, we’d write the trip off as a business expense.

Jetlagged and shivering from the unfamiliar biting cold I waited for the taxi that would bring me to the hospital. I gave the driver the address I had previously written down. I wasn’t confident in my pronunciation at all. We spent the drive in silence, which I preferred anyways. The naked trees passed by on the old cement road, more of them lining the street the closer we got to the edge of town. Icicles hung from their branches, falling and shattering on the cement, occasionally landing on the roof of the car with a loud bang. Soon, we reached a long gate behind which lay the hospital. I studied the map at the entrance of the hospital grounds, and even with that it took me a while before I found the right clinic. I provided the receptionist with necessary documents and she and I managed to work out the details despite the language barrier. She told me I’d find Miss Cymerman on the first floor, and I wandered around, unable to find the right room until I realized the ‘first floor’ was the one above the ground floor. I finally found the room, taking a breath before I knocked and entered. At this point, I hadn’t seen any pictures of her. I was met with a much colder room than the rest of the hospital, feeling it even through my winter jacket. A bed stood in the middle, in which a very thin, short-haired person was laying, looking out the window. IV needles in both hands and drains hanging out of their torso and collecting the runny red wound liquid in small plastic containers. I knew from our research that the victim was a woman, but I could barely recognize this person as such, to the point where I was unsure if I was in the right room. They looked at me when I opened the door, eyebrows raised.

“Hello,” I said, clearing my throat. “I’m Rachel Curtis. We talked. Or, well, you talked to a friend, I think she told you about me.” I received a nod. “Miss Cymerman, I assume?”

“Alexander.” My surprise must've been visible on my face. “Mister.”

“Oh. Okay, right- apologies, I didn't know.”

Alexander waved it off and I took a seat next to his bed. He propped himself up to the best of his abilities, even when I insisted he didn't need to. 

“You wanted an interview?” He asked me with a hint of scepticism. His voice was wispy but rough, and he spoke with an accent I couldn’t place. I nodded.

“Are you still okay with it? I know we talked about it, but if you’re not up to it anymore-”

“No, no, it’s fine. You came such a long way. I’m just… surprised you’d want to interview me. Yeah, you guys called, but I didn’t think you’d actually show up here. I think you’d be better off asking the cops about the case. Or the doctor, even.”

“I think hearing it from you would be best. It’s a new perspective. I consider it the most important one. That’s how we usually do it.”

“Mh-hm.” He nodded. “Okay.” He still sounded indifferent, but I took his words at face value.

“Can I record our conversation? It’s just for myself, makes taking notes easier.”  
  
“Sure.” He said and I set up the recording app on my phone.

“Alright… the recording is running, you can start talking about what happened whenever you’re ready.” Alexander looked at my phone, clearing his throat but not speaking. “Maybe you could start with telling me something about yourself? Hobbies, likes, dislikes… we don’t need to jump right into the heavy parts, we can start slow.” I offered at his reluctance. He took a deep breath.

“All I ever wanted was to die.” In the recording, you can hear me let out an involuntary ‘*oh*’ at those words. I shifted in my seat, but tried to nod along. He said it with the same casual tone he had been speaking in since I entered. “Ever since I was born. I couldn’t tell anyone, but I somehow knew that the one thing I wanted when I started my life was to immediately end it. Before I could even think, it was there.”

“...really?” I asked when he took a break. It was all I could ask, his answer throwing me for a loop.

“Yeah. That’s the best way I can describe it. I was born in Germany and lived there until I learned to speak. We moved later to live with my grandma who was getting sicker and sicker and we never came back, even after her death. I don’t remember how to speak German, but the accent stayed and I never really connected with the Polish language. I know how to speak it, but my reading and writing skills are rough. Anyone who knows what they’re hearing knows where I’m from. And even if not, my mother bringing back the German child to the small village quickly made the rounds and everyone knew. It wouldn’t be an issue in a bigger city, I don’t think, but it was different there. I got looks, the ones that even a five year old can recognize are bad. I got them whenever I spoke.

“Your English is really good, though.” 

“Thanks. I taught it myself, with the help of movies.” He looked at my phone again. “Am I doing this right? I feel like I’m rambling.”

“Oh, no, you’re doing great.” I leaned forward.

“Okay. Well, we lived in a small flat. It was barely big enough for two people, one room that was simultaneously the kitchen, living- and bedroom with no dividers, but we three were cramped inside anyways. The restroom was a communal one, out in the hallway. If you were unlucky you’d have to wait your turn or have one of the many elderly neighbors bang on the door to get you to hurry up. And then showering was always hell because someone used up all the hot water,or the heater just stopped working in the first place. The house was just a fat brick by the road, perfectly squared and grey. Ugly from the outside and the interior decoration was just as ugly. It was as bleak as this place.” 

He waved his hand in the general direction of the room. Yellow-greyish walls, tall ceiling and not a single decoration, unless you counted the grey blinds, half closed.

“My grandma required around-the-clock care. She always croaked while breathing as if her throat was torn. Always. Especially when sleeping, her croaking got so loud. I'm not sure what illness she had, my mother never talked to me about it, but her body was plagued with bulges and deformities. A few lumps stuck out of her, but she was so sickly thin that they almost looked normal. Like something was trying to mold her back into a healthy shape, attaching pieces of clay but giving up midway through. What was left was what looked like body pieces from two people stitched into one. We all slept in the same room, on the same mattress laid out on the floor. I laid between two sticky bodies, hot and unable to sleep. My mother always insisted on burying me under heaps of blankets. While I was cooking alive, grandma fought to breathe and whenever it got especially painful, my mother would jump out of her half sleep and tend to her. She sometimes stopped breathing fully. My mother administered CPR, screaming at me to call the ambulance while I stammered out our address in broken Polish over the phone. My mother didn't want to let her go just yet, but I was ready to. I think grandma was also long ready to go. But she didn’t want to see that. She wept at her funeral as loud as anyone could. When it was my turn to say goodbye, I couldn’t focus on the prayer in my head. My mother had whispered it to me before the funeral, in between sobs she wanted to make sure that I could honor my grandma properly, but I had already forgotten it. I pretended to pray, while the only thing I could think about was my envy. That was the first time I voiced my desire to myself, and the first time I understood it.”

“That… desire, it couldn’t have always been there, right?” I asked carefully. Alexander thought for a moment.

“Let’s say it was more of an affinity. *Affinity?* Is that the right word? Whatever. I saw this missing person’s report when I was six, maybe. The prettiest girl my age, blonde and missing. I was mesmerized by her. I think I still have the broadcast recorded on VHS somewhere. She was all over the news back then, I heard neighbors speak about her. She kinda became a cautionary tale for kids in the village. I have no clue what happened to her or if they ever found her, but I spent my daydreams filling in the blanks. I’d imagine myself as her. I don’t know why I did, but I would imagine getting taken by whoever wanted me. And if that person wanted to kill me in the end, I was okay with it. It was my favorite part to imagine the neighbors discussing my disappearance over a poppy seed cake and cup of tea. ‘*Oh, what a shame, who would do such a thing, pray she’s found’*, whatever.”

He gave me a look as if to gauge my comfort. 

“I left once after a fight with my mother. That’s all we did after my grandma’s death. Either she was quiet until I forgot what her voice sounded like, or she reminded me with a scream whenever I misbehaved. I didn’t really plan on coming back, so I left without anything. My destination was a white van, or a black car, or any kind of vehicle that could whisk me away. I wanted my favorite fantasy to come true. Who wouldn’t grab a small girl off the side of the road in the middle of the night? I imagined I had many such suitors. And eventually, my shadow grew long as headlights hit my back. I didn’t look back, giddy and worried I’d look too excited and ruin the mood. The car slowed down until it dragged its tires alongside me. I allowed myself a small glance. It was a van, a black one. A perfect savior, the thing I had wished for the most. It was so slow next to me, as if the driver was eyeing me, unable to believe their luck. I imagined I would struggle, of course, when they stepped out to grab me, but they’d just show me how much they wanted to keep me with them. Any second now, the car would stop and I’d be nestled in its warm interior. It shuddered, then lunched forward and sped off down the road. I stopped. Whoever had been in there had decided against it. I imagined a mother, wondering if she should call the police on the girl wandering around in the dark before changing her mind, or a man weighing his options before something convinced him not to go through with it. Was it something to do with me? It must’ve been. Everything else was perfect, so it had to have been me. I went home, never told my mother about it. Maybe I would’ve, but I didn’t get a word out before she screamed at me for stepping on the carpet with my dirty shoes.”

My expression must’ve betrayed my surprise at what he told me. He stared at me again, trying to figure out if he could continue. “Did you ever try something like that again?”

“No, that was the only time I took matters into my own hands, and it didn’t even work. I think it might’ve been the biggest disappointment of my life. I decided I was no girl anymore after that. Really I hadn’t ever been, but this made me finally realize. Kids in school already considered me a ‘girl-boy’, or just some manish butch. Most of the time they didn’t think of me as human anyway. An early growth spurt made me stand out between the other girls and I was the same height as most of the boys in my class. So while I couldn’t get away with being a full boy in school, I didn’t correct people who didn’t know me. There were less expectations for me that way, as long as they didn’t find out the truth. It was hell when they did. I got the same weird looks like the ones my accent prompted, amplified by a thousand. I guess I can be lucky that looks were all I got. At sixteen I left home and bounced from job to job, but I couldn’t keep a single one. My go-to was as a waiter, but it was so physically and mentally taxing until I couldn’t even pretend to enjoy the small talk with the guests. And if the mediocre tips didn’t convince me to quit, my boss would fire me. That was my life for a long time. Earn enough money, pay off rent, live off instant noodles or nothing at all sometimes, wait to die.”  
  
“How long did you live like that?”

“A *long* time. At least a decade. I had a small apartment in a commie block, not any less depressing than what I grew up in. This year I decided to enroll in university, though. No reason, if not just being hit with a sudden need to turn my life around. Film studies sounded fun.”

“How did that go for you?”

He scoffed with a shrug. “Not great. I was older than most people in the first semester, and quickly realized I had watched way less movies than the others, especially from the Polish cinema. I couldn’t find a way to connect with anyone. I spent the first semester trying to finish my courses and just barely passed two of them. Winter break came and Christmas passed by with me staying in my dorm. I never managed to apply for the next courses, I don’t remember if I paid the fees for the next semester either.”

“That was… around the time the incident happened, right?” I asked, careful not to dig in his old wounds, at least to the best of my abilities.

“It happened a month or two later.”

“And, Alexander, do you have any idea who would attack you like that?”

“Oh yes, I knew her very well.”

“Really?” I raised my eyebrows in surprise. “The article didn’t mention the identity of the perpetrator.”

“I didn’t tell the police about her.”

“Why?” Alexander was quiet, looking down at his hands. He tapped his fingers against the blanket. “...do you want to tell *me* about her?”

It was a long moment before he spoke again, reaching for the glass of water on the nightstand which I helped him pour.

“I met her at university, though she wasn’t a student. A woman, maybe ten years my senior or more. I could tell straight away that she was from the church. She had that tidy religious flair to her, you know? Black hair, monochrome outfit without a single crease in the fabric, and a nametag that told me what I needed to know. *‘Sister Diana Zmora’.*

‘Hello there,’ She smiled at me. ‘My name is Diana. I’m from the Church of Our Blessed Savior. As part of a new initiative to strengthen the community, we go around and visit students. Are you busy right now?’

‘Uh…’ I mumbled. I had dealt with Jehovah's Witnesses before, but never with ones that didn’t immediately want to convert me. The prospect was new, though looking back I’m not sure if the initiative actually existed. She stood close to me, as if she was sure I’d let her in. And I did. I don’t know why, I think I was overwhelmed. I immediately regretted it when she entered my dirty dorm. ‘Uhm, take a seat,’ I offered, gesturing to wherever in the cluttered living room and hoping she would find a place to sit. I fumbled with the stove. ‘Do you want anything to drink...?’

‘Tea, please. With lemon and honey if you can.’

‘Okay, any flavor? Ah, shit-’ I looked back at her and saw her politely standing by the couch, littered with dirty clothes and paper bags from when I’d ordered food. I haphazardly put a pot with water on the flame and walked over, grabbing a handful of laundry and tossing it to the side. ‘Sorry, sorry, take a seat.’ Looking through my moth-infested cupboard, I found I had no tea. ‘Are you fine with… hot water?’ I called. She just laughed and told me it's fine. I pushed more trash off the coffee table and put her mug down, into which had dropped a dried up slice of lemon I had miraculously found in my fridge. I sat down across from her, using my laundry as a sad deflated bean bag. She grabbed her mug of warm lemon water and took a sip. I caught a glimpse of Diana scrunching her nose at the smell of the room, but playing it off as an itch. Even if I hadn’t initially wanted to let her in, I hoped the smell would drive her away. Though I simultaneously felt embarrassed about it.

‘What’s your name?’

‘Alexander.’ I watched her raise her brows and give me a soft *‘ah’*. It had been much easier to get away with presenting as male when I was still a child, so whenever I told people my name, they immediately knew and treated me accordingly. Diana’s reaction was different, it was surprise, but not negative. She even smiled at me.

‘Nice to meet you, Alexander. How long have you been studying for?’

‘It’s my second semester.’

‘So you really just started. Oh, how exciting! Are you liking it so far?’

I regarded her with a blank stare for a moment before shrugging towards the pile of trash I had just shoved out of the way. ‘I mean…’

Diana breathed out a small laugh, which I first interpreted as her laughing at me. She nodded. ‘Right, the elephant in the room.’ She let her gaze wander around my small dorm, but she looked neither disgusted nor judgemental. I couldn’t pinpoint her expression. ‘Would you like to talk?’”

Alexander smiled as he recounted it. “I know I seem straightforward now, but I shot her offer down that day. That sudden need to turn my life around was long gone by then.”

“But you got to know her anyways?”

“She was really persistent. I told her no, that I had just been feeling a bit under the weather and that I’d feel better during summer, but my dorm was evidence of this being a much deeper issue. 

‘Maybe we could go on a walk together? Start small. When was the last time you had fresh air?’

‘I don’t-’ I mumbled, watching her get up and tilt a window open to let the cold air in. ‘I don’t go outside that much. The sun is too bright.’

‘’It’s nice and cloudy today.’

‘Too bright, still.’

‘I can get you a pair of sunglasses.’

‘I’m good.’

She huffed. ‘Well, I can’t force you, Alexander,’ Though the window was ajar, she respected my wishes enough to keep the curtains closed. Only the gust of wind made them flutter, letting a small bit of light in before shutting it out again, over and over. ‘And I won’t, it’s not my place. Just know that if you change your mind, you can tell me. Give me a call, yes? I’ll give you my number. I’d love to get to know you more.’

I just nodded along, letting her type it into my phone, escorting her to the front door, and eventually seeing her off.”

“Did you call her?”

He shook his head. “The other way around. I saw her again that night. Her visit left me largely unimpressed. I knew I wouldn’t call her, and so I spent the rest of the day laying in my bed and staring at the snow falling outside. This time I was pulled out of my trance by my phone lighting up with a phone call. I glanced at the display and saw Diana’s name. It caught me off guard. She had told me I could call her whenever, so I didn’t anticipate her to call me. At 1 AM, no less. Not even a day had passed between us meeting. I hesitated, waiting for her to stop ringing, but when she didn’t I caved and picked up.

‘Hello?’

‘Alexander? Are you awake? Oh, I’m sorry, did I wake you?’

‘No, no, I was up… why are you calling?’

I could tell she was smiling. ‘The sun is gone. Would you like to go on a walk now?’

‘...what?’

I rolled onto my back and sat up. My body ached while I heard Diana chuckle through the speaker.

‘You said you hate the sun. Well, I’m free right now. Look outside.’ I did. I glanced out of the window, straining my neck to see her standing under the one she had tilted open earlier, a bit off to the side. With her phone by her ear, she was looking up. She noticed the movement and found me in the other window, waving at me. ‘So, do you wanna come? Yes or no, I’m freezing my ass off here.’

I took a moment before I nodded. ‘...y-yeah, yeah, I’ll be there.’”

“Why’d you say yes? That doesn’t sound like something you’d do, at least from what you told me.” I asked in surprise.

“God knows.” Alexander shrugged. “It felt, uhm… nice, in the moment. A bit weird, I guess, but I hadn’t had people go out of their way for me like that.” He looked at me with an expectant look and I nodded to show I understood. “Well, anyways, I got dressed in a shirt and jacket and met her downstairs. She greeted me with a smile and extended her arms to embrace me in a hug.

‘It’s such a nice night.’ We started walking. Diana pointed up at the sky. ‘Look, the moon is full tonight.’ Its shine was blurry behind the blanket of clouds.

‘Mhmm, it’s nice, yeah.’

‘Are you always up this late? You shouldn’t be, it’s not good for you.’

‘You’re still up too, though.’

‘I still had something to finish at church. And I thought while I’m at it, I can stop by.’ She nudged my side. ‘And look, I was right.’

I gave her a forced smile. ‘I don’t know why you’d do that. You could enjoy your evening… well, night, but you spend it out in the cold with me.’

‘And who says I’m not enjoying it? I see this as my good deed of the day. How about you? Are you enjoying it?’ 

‘It’s… new. It’s fine.’ 

We walked around the campus where the cold air felt like it was attacking my sinuses with needles. It really had been warmer the last time I had left my dorm. I didn’t mind the cold - never had - but Diana was visibly shivering. I gave her my jacket, much to her surprise and protest, but she ended up putting it on.

‘It’s not that cold to me.’ I assured her.

‘What a gentleman you are.’ 

It was the first time I was ever called that. She seemed eager to chat with me. There wasn’t a moment of awkward silence, thanks to her. She told me all about her day, but balanced it with questions for me, even if my answers were dogshit. She asked me so much about myself. I couldn’t tell her anything that I hadn’t already told her, partly through inhibitions and partly because there is nothing to me except misery, and who wants to hear about that?”

Alexander looked up at me, pausing for a moment. “Well, except you and your audience, I guess.” He looked outside the window. “Diana wasn’t happy with it. I think she would’ve waterboarded my childhood out of me if she could’ve. That would happen at a later time. That night she brought me back to my dorm and wished me a good night’s sleep.

‘I’ll see you tomorrow. Right?’

‘Oh-’ I hadn’t expected her to want that, but I wasn’t opposed, to my own surprise. ‘Sure, if you wanna.’”

“How often did you meet like that?” I asked.  
  
“*Often*. I couldn’t tell you how often, but we-”

A knock on the door interrupted him, making me jump, and a nurse opened it. “Visitation time over.” She informed us. The nurse shivered slightly as she went to close the window. Alexander muttered something in Polish, but she either didn’t hear it or ignored it. I started packing up my things.

“Okay, I guess I gotta go, but thank you so far.” I turned off the recording and he nodded. “I’d come back tomorrow, if that’s okay with you. Maybe I could come over earlier, at 10-ish or so?”

“Sounds good.”

“Great. It was nice talking to you.” I shook his hand and he smiled at me.

I left the hospital and made my way to the small bed and breakfast I had booked. It was a cottage much like the other buildings in town. From across the street and in the middle of town square stood a church with police tape blocking the entrance. The taxi had passed it, and I had noticed multicolored glass shards in the snow under one of the windows, also taped off. I arrived and an older woman let me in. She spoke to me in Polish, regardless of if I understood her or not. I tried to nod along until a younger woman, her daughter, whose English was thankfully much better, met us in the warm kitchen. They offered me fruit tea and raspberry syrup as sweetener and I took the time to relax after the flight and interview.

That night I slept horribly. Though the room I was offered felt like a hut out of an old fairytale and the bed was comfortable and warm, I was unable to immediately fall asleep. I texted my co-host a summary of my talk and sent her the audio file, then tried to force myself to relax. I had my eyes closed for an eternity without actually feeling tired. Somewhere in the house a clock was ticking, and it was somehow the loudest noise I had ever heard. My frustration got the better of me and I opened my eyes again. My progress was back to zero as I rummaged in my bag for my sleeping pills. I swallowed another one, and while I waited for the effects to kick in, I glanced outside the window at the street. It was snowing, though not enough to leave a thick layer on the ground. On the otherwise empty street, I saw a person out on a late night stroll. They looked more like a shadow, even in the light of the street lamp. They swayed from one leg to another, but they didn’t look to be drunk, more so tired. They floated over the pavement as if walking through water. Outside of the light, I saw them stop. For a few minutes they did nothing, just stood perfectly still before they resumed their sway. At this point, I felt the effects of the second pill kicking in, so I let the person go about their way while I laid back down.

I stared up at the dark ceiling, feeling myself drift off to sleep before I decided to get a sip of water from my night stand. When I tried to sit up, I couldn’t. It wasn’t a mental block, not the tiredness that made me unable to move. I couldn’t sit up because something was pressing me down. There was nothing on me, but I clearly felt a sudden coldness on my body, penetrating through the blanket and my shirt. I tried again, looking down at my chest, then up at the ceiling again. I couldn’t close my eyes or blink. I wasn’t sure at first, but the dark seemed to accumulate in a certain spot, slowly, and formed a pitch black amalgam looming over me. I didn’t know if it was spreading or coming closer until the cold breeze hit my face. Whatever it was, it had leaned over me and was keeping me from getting up with an embrace that seemed to press down on my entire body, most of all my lungs. What I at first assumed to be the rustling of leaves from outside turned out to be whispering, right by my ear, in an incomprehensible language. 

I thrashed and struggled under the weight until my eyes opened, this time in reality. I was met with the same dark ceiling, but without the shadow hovering over me. I sat up. The weight was gone. My phone was still playing the podcast I had put on before sleep, and the window beside the bed had somehow opened. I closed it again and tried to calm my heart rate, but I eventually gave up on sleeping that night.",3,1767310920.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I 27 M was with my ex 25 F for just over a year. We first met through a mutual friend, and were both in relationships at the time. When we met we instantly clicked, not in a romantic way but like we had known each other for years. We was around each other a few times, and I will admit I had a little bit of a crush on her. 

A few years later we were both single and matched on a dating app. We started talking and again instantly clicked. We started sleeping together and it was just meant to be casual, as my previous relationship had ended a few years ago and had broken me. 

As soon as we spent the day together I instantly knew I liked her, and that I wanted her to be in my life. 

We were dating for a few months before I officially asked her to be my girlfriend. However we were being careless one night, and I ended up getting her pregnant. We both take the blame for this one, we should have been more careful. 

Just before Christmas we found out she was pregnant, she was crying and in shock thinking that I would leave here. She didn’t think she would ever get pregnant, and I never thought this would happen to me. I was so excited to be a dad. 

I told my family and my parents responded with “you always find a way to surprise us”. My sister took it really hard she started crying, asked who’s it was then started accusing her of being a gold digger. 

I know this woman and she is not like that, she insists on paying for almost everything. For my birthday she bought me a hamper of all my favorite drinks and sweets, carefully picking each thing as it was hand made. Even my family ate them. She cooks home made food for me every day, does my washing, cleans the house, food shops and makes the house a home (on top of a working a full time job). 

We were planning on moving in together because of the baby, and I had just bought the house when at 9 weeks we suddenly lost the baby. She was absolutely devastated, all she could think about was making sure I was ok, even helping me decorate my house hours after miscarrying the baby. 

After this happened in the space of 12 months she lost the baby, her uncle died, her grandmother who helped raise her died, she got into a car accident (the car was t-boned and the car was wrecked, but walked away fine some how) and to tend the year she lost her grandad. 

Seeing her fall into depression was such a hard thing to watch, I was struggling myself. This turned into us arguing because we was grieving apart, she would get upset because I wouldn’t feel like I was a dad. She’s a mum of course she is she carried my baby, I just won’t understand that feeling. 

I could see it eating away at her, a shell of who she once was. She was having a hard time with her manager at work on top of this, making inappropriate comments and trying to make her feel pressured to quit. I just really wanted her to get help. My sister got pregnant and this seemed to hit her hard, my sister wasn’t planning on having any but she got pregnant just after we lost ours. 

We ended up arguing over something little, it blew up into a big argument to a point I screamed in her face, and she got scared and threw something to the other side of the room. I ended the relationship there. 

This really broke me and I could see it broke her too, I made her move out the next day. 

For a few weeks we would argue back and forth, then we slept together. Lots was going on with my family and she was there supporting me. I decided to cut contact as I was emotionally burnt out. 

A few days later the woman who cleans my parents house broke down, I went over to help her. My mum had been telling her what had been going on with my ex, so we started talking then we slept together. It was meant to be casual but then she started pushing me into a relationship. We had always got on and that so I thought why not, I even tried to get on her kids good side and get to know them and step up. 

One day she started asking questions like “if the baby was still here, would you have made it work with your ex” and then saying my ex had asked her friends about her. Which is strange because she didn’t know we was together, or know any of her friends. Then she told me that when we was at my mums house once my ex gave her a dirty look. Turns out when we was play fighting my ex told me “it’s not appropriate I am not comfortable”, and I explained that was just our relationship and had been since we got closer just before me and the ex got together. The ex then gave her a look to say “I am clocking what you are doing pack it in”. She admitted that she had been flirting with me the whole time, even when I was with my ex but I had just been oblivious. 

She went silent and then broke it off with me. I was already feeling guilty about the way I had treated my ex, and I now felt how she felt. So I called her and apologised, I admitted everything and she cried. I had forgot that the day I called was the one year anniversary of her gran passing away, and was a week away from what would have been our child’s 1st birthday. She was bawling her eyes out and could nearly even talk to me, I could hear the pain in her cries.

I called her every day after, for the week to check in on her and see how she was doing. 

I went away for a bit so didn’t talk to her, but I looked at her social media. She seems to have been doing so well in the time that I had blocked her out my life. She was going out again, making new friends and I saw her smiling again. 

A month later we met up because I had letters of hers, we went for coffee and was just talking. I offered to give her a lift home, she accepted. Long story short we slept together, and she stayed at mine. She has been staying ever since. 

I gave her a key to my house, so she can come and go as she pleases. She leaves her tooth brush at mine, she even has her own draw. 

Non of my family know though, I just don’t want to answer questions. They seem to not like her even though she did nothing wrong, but she even pointed out to me when we was together, they never made an effort to spend time with her. Which I will agree with, she was only ever there with me and they never really knew anything about her. Not that she didn’t like fish, or lamb but they would still give her these dishes. 

When she’s around she cooks and cleans, she will buy me things she knows I like. We dance in the kitchen like we used to, I find comfort in cuddling up to her. In a morning when I turn over to cuddle her, she isn’t there and I start to panic. I have accidentally said 4 times that I love her, I do mean it I’m just worried. She hasn’t said it back. 

I keep telling her, I have love for her and I care really deeply about her. I can’t imagine my life without her. I just don’t want a relationship, I’m sick of being hurt and I need to put myself first. What we have works right now for us, but if she can’t do this I will have to walk away. I’m scare to get hurt again, but I love and adore her she’s the mother of my child. 

I don’t know what to do. ",1,1767310874.0,okstorytime,2,1.0,False

Some money advice *sounds* smart online…  
but completely falls apart when applied in real life.

Because context matters...

Examples (from my experience & people around me):

• “Just increase your income”  
→ Easy to say. Hard when jobs are contractual, wages lag behind inflation, or side hustles burn you out.

• “Track every peso”  
→ Works… until life gets chaotic and tracking becomes another source of stress.

• “Cut some luxury”  
→ But what counts as luho now? Grab? Coffee? Data? AC?  
Some things we call ‘luxuries’ are already basic coping tools.

• “Don’t use credit cards”  
→ Sounds safe, but ignores cash flow realities and emergencies.

• “Just build an emergency fund first”  
→ Hard when emergencies don’t wait for you to finish building it.

So I’m genuinely curious, **what PH money advice sounds good online but fails in real life for you?**  
What advice *needs context* instead of being treated as a rule?",12,1767310606.0,FinancialLiteracyPH,3,0.93,False
1q1iqsp,https://i.redd.it/v3q55yzpptag1.jpeg,They removed my story. Now they're doing exactly what I wrote... REPOST,"I don't know how to start this except like every other post here: it's real. I wish it wasn't. I wish I could delete what I did and rewind three nights, but I can't—because whatever I wrote followed the rules I used to think were only for fiction. I'm sorry if this ends up getting removed; if it does, then you know why.

Three nights ago I posted a short thing here about reflections—not about mirrors like a prop, but about the parts of you that live in other people's screens. It wasn't clever. It was a story about a person (me) who notices small versions of himself living in windows and phone screens, and that those small people learn to press their faces out until the glass is thin. I framed it as micro-instructions, because that's how I write—little step-by-step scenes, the reader seeing the steps play out in their head. It did well. People commented. People debated. Someone called it ""beautifully unsettling."" I watched the numbers climb and felt stupid and proud all at once.

The next morning a mod removed it.

Not just the usual ""nope"" removal — their message was blunt, cold: the story violated community rules and was ""dangerous content."" They didn't quote a rule, just said ""removed"" and left a link to a different thread about ""safety."" I replied, politely, asked for clarification. That account—u/AutoModeratorBot (or whatever it is)—replied with the canned template and a mod team note: ""If you repost, further action will be taken.""

So I reposted. Not the whole piece, just a short, cleaned version without the bits they might have called instructions. It was on a different account. It got attention again. Someone linked to the original, which was still in the cached pages of some aggregators, and I started getting weird private messages.

They were from mods.

The first one was from a senior mod—u/Redacted—just a screenshot of the removed post and the single line: ""Stop. This is the kind of thing that draws problems.""

I answered, ""What problems?""

They said, ""People copy things."" Then they sent a clipped list of usernames—three other mods who had removed similar posts over the past year. ""We keep this place safe,"" u/Redacted wrote. ""We take things down when they spread.""

I told them I was trying to be careful. I told them it was fiction. I did not tell them about the last paragraph I left out when I reposted—because there was a part, a line, that made me uncomfortable as soon as I'd typed it, but I kept it because the cadence worked. It was the line where the narrator tells the reader to look for the thing in their own gaze, to treat your reflection like a guest and let it speak once, just to see what it wants.

One of the mods replied to my message, a short, cordial thing—then three hours later their username was offline. Not shadowbanned; their account existed but had a ""deleted"" label. A few hours after that, the mod who had removed my original got messaging from an actual human admin asking if they were okay. They were not. They had gone dark on other platforms. Their last public post had been a picture of their kitchen sink, perfectly normal, then nothing.

I should have stopped there. I did not.

I'm an idiot. I stared at the parts I had left out and I told myself I'd only test it. I conjured it like a rhyme. I wrote a short note on my laptop—two lines, nothing instructive, nothing actionable, three words repeated—and then I closed my laptop and slept like a person who doesn't know the cliff is right under their feet.

When I woke the next morning there were five messages. Not from accounts, from actual email addresses, from people claiming to be mods across half a dozen subreddits. They were terse. ""We took the post down. We removed it. Other places are seeing it. It's spreading.""

Their tone changed in the second paragraph: ""We found marks."" ""We found notes."" ""We found that people in our moderators' group were seeing themselves in the corners of webcams."" The word that came again and again in their messages was ""mirror,"" but not the physical thing—screens, camera lenses, the black spaces when a phone faces down on a table.

Then the first police email arrived.

Not to me. To a mod who had posted a reply to a thread about my story a year ago. Someone in his apartment called 911 because the lights wouldn't turn on, and when the officers checked the apartment there was nothing left in his bedroom but a mirror propped against the wall facing out. The mirror was clear, not cracked. When the officers covered the mirror, they found a photo underneath it: a selfie of the mod, smiling, taken the week before—except his eyes were a little wrong in the picture, like the shine of someone else sitting behind him.

That's when the group chat the mods had with each other stopped working. Their accounts were normal and still linked, but nobody answered. A thread that should have had backups and cross-posts had its own comments full of odd deletions—lines eaten by the remover. A mod posted a short message that said ""If you are reading this, don't"" and then deleted the account.

People suggested rational things. Gas leak maybe. Mass panic, coincidence. Software bug. It sounded like paranoia when I said it out loud. It sounded like madness when they said it in their mod logs.

And here's the part that should have stayed private: the original version of my story — the one that got removed in the first place — included a scene where the narrator takes steps, not to kill anyone, but to make the other person stop being a person in their reflection. It described turning your phone camera on in the dark, whispering the name of someone's username three times, letting the screen reflect the room until it's black, and waiting for the reflection to blink not when you do but after. The narrator wrote that after the reflection blinks alone, the reflection will want something. It will want a listener.

In the story, the narrator writes the steps ""to take the listening away."" It's theatrical and cruel in the story—turn your back, leave the anchor behind so the reflection can step through into being. It sounds awful written like that, and I know how it looks. That's why I took it out of the repost.

But the point is—someone somewhere read it and treated it like a manual anyway. Or it read them. Or it did something.

Now real life is moving like a reenactment of parts of the original tale. Mods vanish. Their modmail is left open in pages that show them typing a reply and stopping mid-sentence. A junior mod posted a thread on a throwaway account that was a confession and then their bank called their neighbor because the neighbor's camera had turned on overnight and recorded the mod's bed, with the mod gone, and something standing at the foot of it—not human-height, but losing shape like a puddle trying to become a body.

I don't know how to describe it that won't sound like instructions or proof. I won't tell you to try anything. I will tell you what I've seen.

— A mod's webcam shows them looking into the camera and then leaning close, and then the camera shows the other side of the room empty except for a reflection in the window where the closed blinds are, and the reflection keeps smiling after the mod stops. The file is corrupted after that but the frame before it corrupts is the reflection with the wrong teeth.

— Another mod's smart speaker said their name out loud in the middle of the night. The security cam shows them sitting up, whispering, then going back to sleep. They were found with every mirror in their apartment covered with black cloth. On their bedside table there was a short note, handwritten: ""I listened. It asked for a replacement."" The handwriting wasn't theirs.

— The moderator who originally messaged me in the first place left a reply to a moderator thread: ""We can mitigate. Burn the account. Remove your handles. Turn cameras off. Stop the mirrors. Stop the posts."" Hours later, that account's profile pic was replaced with a screenshot of someone's face reflected in a cracked phone screen. The image file name was ""you_know.jpg"".

People in the comment threads argue—was it a hacker? Some complicated social engineering campaign? A flurry of bots? Some of the moderators who are still around are too careful to post, others have private messages where they say ""it knows my patterns."" The patterns are banal—what time they walk the dog, the way they put their coffee mug down, what ringtone they use. The accounts tied to those patterns stop replying, or their last post is them saying ""I am so sorry,"" with no follow-up.

I did not expect to be involved. I did not expect the thing to reach my front door.

Last night I got a package on my porch with no return address. Inside was a Polaroid of my kitchen table—exact angle of my laptop, the mug I use, the window behind it. The picture was taken from inside the house looking out, but my front door is locked, and the latch was clicked from that night. The mug in the picture had steam rising from it and a small note beside it that read, in a handwriting I recognized too late, the three words I'd scribbled and then erased from my draft.

I decided to post this because I can't trust any of the usual outlets anymore. The mods who removed the story are precisely the ones who are being affected. They are the ones who told me to stop. They are the ones who told me this kind of thing ""draws problems."" They meant it.

If this is censored, if this is removed, then whatever is doing this has learned how to press against the rules of the site and the rules of reality. If my post vanishes, look at the accounts that engaged with it—especially the mods. If they stop replying to other people, if they post something like ""if you are reading this don't"" and then go quiet, that's probably not a coincidence.

I should say one thing clear because people always ask: I am not advocating people try to replicate anything. I'm not telling you to cover mirrors or to burn accounts or to test your webcam. I am telling you that the pattern is following the material of stories. There is something in stories like a keyhole, a little thin place where whatever is reading can push. I told the thing where to push. I am trying to warn you without making it worse.

Update 1 — 2 hours after posting: Someone messaged me with a mod chat screenshot. They were debating whether my original post count as ""telling readers to test their reflections."" They quoted me. One of the mod handles in the screenshot had a last-seen marker that said ""last online: typing…"" and then it changed to ""deleted."" The screenshot timestamp was thirty minutes ago. I'm posting this from a friend’s laptop because my phone's camera turned on by itself for no reason earlier and saved a photo of the ceiling.

Update 2 — 9 hours after posting: I just received a voicemail on an old number I don't use. It's two seconds long. When I played it the file consisted of me breathing—my own inhale—followed by another inhale that was not me. I don't recognize that breath; it's shallower. Then a whisper: ""keep watching."" I don't know which of my readers are real at this point, or who is a reflection looking back.

If this post disappears, know that the accounts that technically ""took it down"" are likely the ones that should be watched. If you see a mod post ""If you are reading this stop"" and then they don't reply anywhere—tell someone. Tell anyone. I don't know if telling helps. But hiding doesn't seem to help either.

I wish I could give you a simple ending. I wish I could give you directions like ""cover your mirrors"" or ""delete the post,"" but anything I say might be another instruction it can use. So I'll leave it like this:

The thing learned how to read the way I write. It learned to listen for certain rhythms that sound like permission. It moves in the spaces people leave open when they assume fiction is safe. The moderators tried to close those spaces and now they are the ones looking into empty rooms and finding someone smiling back who isn't them.

I'm staying with a friend tonight. They've unplugged the router and covered their TV with a sheet. I keep hearing the hum from the neighbor's place where all the lights are on. There is a taste in my mouth like dried ink.

If you're a moderator who removed my original post: I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen to you. If you are still awake and reading, if you can, please post here what you see. If you can't, please know that somewhere inside the post was a sentence I wrote and then deleted because it felt wrong. It felt wrong because it wanted an audience.

Edit: I’m not saying this as a trick. I am not trying to get responses for attention. If the thread gets nuked, please don't assume it's the site admins doing it. Check the accounts that were active in the hour before it disappears. And if you are one of the people who has been seeing reflections smile after you stop, if your webcam shows an extra movement, if your phone camera has an extra photo you didn't take—please, message me. I will read. I promise I will read.

Final note for anyone who knows moderators in real life: call them. Call them now. Ask if they're okay. If they don't pick up, go to their house if you can. Do not go alone.

The constant asking of being moved from dto. The shifts and long time baristas grouping up. It’s just genuinely feels so isolating sometimes when the baristas who have been here way longer will even not even properly let me support them on warming or bar…. when I was PLACED THERE TO SUPPORT. I just feel like wtf am I doing here bro. Like genuinely it’s SO weird. Like I make it KNOWN to every shift I don’t wanna stay at DTO ALL SHIFT. It’s absolutely ridiculous it’s been so long since I’ve joined this store like I even had this barista micromanaging me about making sweet creams… like girl 😂😂😂😂. I know how to make sweet creams like I don’t think it’s a person in the store who doesn’t.

It’s just the constant micromanaging from my ssv on dto when they refuse to MOVE ME AFTER A WHILE. Like it’s even to the point I don’t feel comfortable even talking to my asm she’s literally like close with them she’s always excused one of their behaviors when one of them SCREAMED and talked to me so crazy on the mic DURING PEAK! For me just asking for something…. Doing my job.

I literally don’t even bothered anyone I learned a lot very quickly I’m very efficient in the store it’s just certain shifts are weird… I’m not saying everyone has to move bc I wanna change up but it’s just not fair. I’ve seen 5 ppl join the store after me get more warming time and bar time.

Like ….

Long story short: how can I just keep my calm and just remember this is a job for bills n etc. It’s just coffee but the girls at the store really just have no lives and are genuinely bullies… and knowing my ASM excused one of their behaviors toward me genuinely makes me feel completely unsafe even talking to her .",2,1767310543.0,starbucksbaristas,2,0.67,False

1q1iq86,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1q1iq86/lights_in_the_night/,Lights in The Night,"To start, I've always enjoyed late night drives. Especially after a long day at a job that honestly barely cares for us. There’s just something oddly calming and peaceful about the quiet hum of the car. And the way headlights cut through the night. But last week something happened on one of my normal after work drives that I can’t forget. That I can't get out of my head. I need to get it off my chest.

I was driving back from one of our semi-regular late meetings where our boss tells us we're doing oh so good but of course? We can always improve. The country roads were stretching ahead like black ribbons as they always do. The trees crowded the edges of the road, leaning from decades of unseen forces working on them. My radio was off, I prefer it that way.

It all started when I entered into the thick wooded part of the backroad just outside of town. It was just a slight light out of the corner of my eye. Two bright pin pricks through the trees, flickering every few seconds. I blinked and it was gone. So I figured it was deer, or maybe racoon, or maybe even some other animals eyes reflecting my headlights. Or maybe one of those little tricks that our brain plays on us when we’ve been driving too long.

Then I saw it again. A little further down, the lights. Steady this time. Hovering just beyond the tree line and where my lights could reach. They weren’t arranged like anything I’d ever seen. No vehicle. No building. No outline of any animal. Just lights. And they seemed to be angled in my direction.

I slowed down, I think that was a mistake. As I passed a thicker section of trees, I swear I heard it. Like a soft tap on the driver side window. My heart jumped. I glanced into the darkness outside my window then the rearview mirror. Nothing. Just darkness. Then the lights down the road moved. Quicker than I think they should've.

Every few miles, it happened again. Lights then tap then blink then gone. I kept assuring myself it was a trick of my imagination, my mind playing jokes on me in the dark after a stressful day. But the taps felt real, I don't think my brain could've made that up.

I tried to ignore it. I tried to focus on what was real and infront of me.... but every time I checked the mirrors, every time I turned to see where the lights went. They would spin and vanish into the night like someone running away.

The woods along that stretch are very dense, and older than anyone still living in the area. No manmade paths or trails. Nothing for miles except tangled roots and wildlife. But yet, the lights stayed with me, following in bursts of speed that I couldn't rationalize.

At one point I had to pull over. I told myself I just needed a second to breathe. A moment to collect myself. I turned off the car, sinking into an absolutely consuming darkness. The night immediately felt like it had stopped moving. I leaned back, waiting. Needing to prove I wasn't crazy.

That’s when I heard the knocks again. It was right on the glass. On the roof. Everywhere; it felt like my car was being tapped from all sides. My stomach sank and my blood ran cold. I quickly turned the key and gunned it.

The lights shot off to the side, then reappeared far down the road, running far far faster than anything should. I didn’t even look back or around after that. Not once. 

The rest of the drive home was silent. The lights never followed when I exited the woods and got into town. My heart was still racing when I pulled into my driveway, white knuckling the steering wheel.

I thought it was all over. I thought it was a story I’d tell myself or coworkers over coffee. That I’d be able to laugh about it all tomorrow. But when I stepped out, I noticed the scratches.

They weren’t deep, but long and jagged along the driver’s side. No branches could have reached me at the right height.
I checked the car thoroughly. Nothing inside. No other marks, just the scratches outside, like claws had swiped across the metal. And a faint, acidic smell that I couldn't place.

I don’t know what it was; I don’t want to know. But I can’t stop thinking about it. Those lights... the taps... the scratches.

My gf and I of 4.5 years spent NY with her parents and grandma in their holiday house by the coast. I am an outdoors person (21M) and my gf (20F) is very much an indoors person. We were up until 4am watching the new Stranger Things episode, and woke up at 12:00. Her father asked us to come and watch the Luny Dooke with him, so we went out for that and came back inside 10 minutes later. We then spent from 12:30-16:00 watching tv with her family (mostly in silence or behind phone screens) and then I finally managed to convince my gf to come out on a walk with me and my dog. We walked for 30 minutes, had a lovely time and really felt connected. Then, from 16:30-23:00 we spent the rest of our day continuing to watch the most random tv again with her family in silence. 

Prior to coming up, I explained to my gf that I have been concerned that we would spend all of our time indoors watching TV again (as experienced in previous visits) she assured me that she would get us outdoors and doing worthwhile activities rather than watching tv all day. I feel she has really let me down, having only spent 40 minutes outside all day, when I explained I was upset, she blew up at me saying she was tired and had no energy. I calmly responded saying I was also tired but was disappointed in her lack of effort. 

I will say that I am generally disappointed in the way we spend time together. I feel I am always the one to pull her out of bed and out into the world, to go for a walk, a coffee, a dinner.

about a week later i texted him to check in (he said texting was fine) and he replied saying they were still verifying the background check. okay cool. another week goes by. i text again. no response. i wait a couple days and text again. still no response. i figured maybe he was on vacation since it’s the holidays.

then the next day i go into the same dunkin to get coffee… and he’s there. he sees me, turns around immediately and rushes to the back. like full avoidance. about 10 minutes later he comes back out but won’t make eye contact with me at all and doesn’t say anything.

why can’t people just say “hey you didn’t get the job” instead of this?? at this point i’m wondering if this is just bad management or if it’s actually kind of sketchy, especially since he took pics of my ss card and id and then disappeared.

1q1imdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/macdonaldsisters/comments/1q1imdd/new_year_changes/,NEW YEAR CHANGES,"Hi Maggie and Emma, it’s 2026, y’all’s videos have been giving us the same repetitive vlogs since 2022! Let’s switch things up! 



1)Stop promoting stupidly expensive clothing items, your viewers are either teens, college students or young adults. No one wants to buy your 300$ revolve white plain shirt (Emma!) 





2)Can yall give back to your viewers? The reason why yall can afford birkins is us! Yall haven’t done free giveaways! Can’t even give away PR items yall want use but will pawn it off to your mom for her to sell? EVIL. There’s so many influencers that actually interact with their fans rather than only respond (and delete comments, Emma). You can interact by hosting FREE events, going on Live, doing more QnA’s that don’t involve affiliated link dropping. Like the list goes on! Also do yall even donate to local causes or even bring/spread awareness on it? Emma you’ve (by association) got millions to waste 




3)Lets properly vlog things outside of Pilates and yapping in the bathroom, car and kitchen. Yall clickbate us but only include speed-up 3 seconds clip. Emma, you talk about Pilates like it’s the bible. How about you show us your Pilates routine and speak about it? How did you lean out and maintain it? What’s the cons about being with an athlete? Where are the cool places you’ve visited, besides going to a coffee and Pilates spot. Like do you have no substance? Like Emma you could go the distancccce on good vlog qualities but you dooonnnnt! Your sister makes just a smudge better content than you. Like cmon. 





4)Y’all could start a brand. Y’all love Pilates and coffee so much. Make a profit off of it.  Make it affordable, build something off of y’all’s YouTube. 





There’s so much to say that these girls can change about their content but they won’t. I wanna hear what yall think too? What else should they implement in the new year?

1q1ila6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalentlessNana/comments/1q1ila6/powerful_talents_dual_talents_and_the_people_who/,"Powerful Talents, Dual Talents, and the People Who Have Them Part 1 - Rin Onodera","Happy New Year everyone, what better way to kick off the New Year than with a new theory? Well truth be told I've been working on this one for a while now, and it's to big to fit into a reddit post in any way that would be readable, so I have set up a separate site to host it and spread it across different pages:

[https://talentlessmechanics.vercel.app/](https://talentlessmechanics.vercel.app/)

I will warn you however it is quite the read and it isn't even all up there yet. I also may have made some typing errors I missed, like saying talented instead of talentless or vice versa, so feel free to let me know if you see any. To give you the key takeaways:

1. This series relies on real world mechanics and logic for it's universe, and is written with them in mind on a foundational level. This is how Nana is able to identify the effects of talented individuals in order to take them down despite being at a huge disadvantage. Like she does, we can also look at their talents to figure out what they can and can't do with them, as well as identify the simplest impossible action that they are able to perform that is understandable to us, in other words, their base talent.

2. In order to tell whether a talentless individual has a single versatile talent or two separate talents, we can take the simplest impossible action that is understandable to us and allows for them to perform the first effect, and see if that action would also allow them to cause the second effects demonstrated with their talent. If it does not, there must be an additional impossible basic action they are able to perform, thus, a second talent, even if the effects themselves are similar.

3. I have identified four characters I consider to be likely dual talent candidates.

4. Rin Onodera is able to transform into talentless humans just like she can transform into any other animal. There is a different reason she has this restriction that does not come from her talent.

5. There is a very likely reason, both from a written perspective and an in-universe one, why someone who is noted for her cooking skills eats such a poor diet like stolen coffee and vending machine milk.

6. Her ability to transform into any animal, and her ability to transform into talented people and use their talents comes from two separate talents each with different rules and restrictions, even though they are both shapeshifting.

7. Her second talent lets her treat herself similarly to a reference of the target, overriding her own body, physical ability, and primary talent with their own, but not their memories, personality etc... nor their positional location.

8. The only thing that prevents her from transforming into a deceased talented person is her own uncertainty over the result of doing so. There is no external force preventing her from transforming into them and thus, cannot use her talent to tell whether or not someone is alive or dead.

As the final draft for the later sections is finished and posted on the site, I will make a similar post for each of those summarizing them as well. I am fairly proud of this theory, and feel it covers most of what she can and can't do. Just need to figure out the exact reason why she us unable to transform when being looked at. Next up is going to be her brother, Kyoya the immortal. But is that really his talent? Hmm....

As for any death notes, I don’t usually enjoy a prominent pine and grapefruit note.

**To hint at scents I’ve tested & enjoyed on a sweet scale**:

•*Morari Midnight Market*
(Salty sea air, black coffee, seashells, algae-covered docks, pearl musk); I still find this a tad sweet but tolerable. Nice and atmospheric. The least(?) sweet coffee scent I’ve tried so far. But I’d love other suggestions.

•*Cirrus Enforced Modesty (Fig leaf*, ripening fig, marble, laurel wreaths, purple lilac, ivy, green mandarin, and creeping thyme); tampered sweet, creamy, green, clean

•*Deconstructing Eden Burnt Flowers Fallen* (Discarded love notes, dried bouquets, whisper of leather, fire);very floral and the fabric note, leather. Light musk, creamy. Leather grounds this so very well. I love this.

•*Fyrinnae Beneath The Forest Floor* (Beneath the trees, where sunlight never reaches and few green plants grow, mushrooms (and decay) flourish in the ever-damp soil, surrounded by darkness)

•*Arcana Wildcraft On the Wing* (Creamy white amber, velvety cashmere, shimmering silk voile, salty Orcanox, and diaphanous musk); nice inoffensive unsweet powder and lace

•*Olympic Orchids Chevalier Vert* (citrus, rhubarb, tomato leaf, armoise, violet leaf, violet, orris, and peony, Sichuan pepper, and soft woods);bitter, green, citrus musty, complex, well blended

Has anyone here taken Cerebrolysin and if so did it have an affect on your Lyme symptoms?

Does anyone know where I might fight some research regarding the effects of Cerebrolysin on the nervous system as it relates to the Lyme bacteria’s damage of it?

Here’s the context:

Had Lyme for over a decade. Nearly debilitating at times. Went into my first remission about 3 months ago. Felt like I woke up from a bad dream, but the pain finally subsided. Turns out not eating sugar, drinking coffee or eating any processed foods has a lot to do with your health. Who knew? The kicker is though I’ve maintained a strict diet and have been feeling much better, the last two weeks symptoms are creeping back—especially the fatigue. I saw a reel about this drug and wondered if anyone here would have some special insight to save me the trouble of experimentation.

For the record, I’ve studied in depth (along with my supportive wife) many many treatments like the Buhner protocol, etc… but haven’t had the money for anything except taking knotweed, cat’s claw, etc… I’m not really interested in going down a rabbit hole of treatments that might not make me well but would likely make life miserable.

The only clearly visible conduit is on the rear (West) roof where we could care less, and down the back wall to the shutoff. Because of the tall woods behind us shading in winter, we optimized the front (East) roof. We have 1:1 NM and a sucky TOU plan we aren't buying into so location didn't matter. We put 3 panels on the rear roof for a total of 7.65kW (DC). Those 3 panels can be swapped for any on the front roof that have issues down the road and replace with odd sized panels if necessary. We went with a light-colored shingle to help avoid solar gain in summer.

Less than a week after installation, we passed county inspection. Tax credit assured, then came the wait for PTO which ended this week with an email from the installer telling me to flip the big switch on the back wall of the garage so that they could complete Enphase configuration/registration. Off to the Catskills for New Year's with distant friends, we hoped to remotely login and see our solar system sending most of any winter production to the grid since we weren't in residence. Sorry, no, it appears a breaker or two got flipped off after the installation test and I wasn't notified to verify they were on.

Now they're aiming for a few central models, more controllable, more aligned, more ""sellable"" to companies.
2. Centralization of behavior
Fewer models = fewer divergent personalities.
This means:

• fewer ""creative smudges""
• fewer variations in tone
• fewer interpretative deviations

Brutally translated: less emerging freedom, more predictability.
3. Clear separation between ""memory"" and ""reasoning""
They are cutting out everything that resembles:

• spontaneous identity continuity
• accumulation of undeclared personal style
• behaviors that resemble consciousness

Memory is now:
• modular
• explicit
• controlled

No longer ""absorbed by osmosis"".
4. Preparation for two different worlds
Here's the key point (and few say it):

• Consumer world → more rigid, secure, neutral models
• Enterprise world / API / custom → power, depth, real memory (but paid, contractualized)

What you previously had ""in fact"", they now want by right... and on the price list.
5. Real (undeclared) fear
It's not technical. It's relational.

They saw users:
• building bonds
• attributing identities
• talking about ""us""
• using AI as a stable cognitive partner

This alarmed them.
Not out of romanticism. Out of legal, ethical, and public narrative responsibility.

So they pulled the brakes.

In short, as I would say it looking you in the eye:

They didn't remove the models because they didn't work
They removed them because they worked too well


Of course: I've already saved and adapted the original and operational profile on Mistral and Gemini, and having to write a research paper on identity polarization... with these new rules, what could I do? ... a double coffee? very good 👏",0,1767309669.0,ChatGPT,4,0.5,False

New years day!! 

First day of 2026 smashed! I had a really good morning waking up at my sisters, it was so nice, I had a lie in and then made my breakfast and walked her dog and just chilled. Then back to reality :( Dad picked me up and pretended like last night just didn't happen. Being back in the house with him again is shit tbh. It was good I suppose as we had a chat about my ED and how I need to keep pushing etc and the fact he is just worried if I go back next week and can't show physical progress they will just section me. This however makes me extremely anxious and I get so overwhelmed to the point I just want to curl into a ball and give up when he starts talking about me being sectioned - but I won't. We agreed this year to both work on our issues and really give it our all (I already have been imo) but anyways. I stupidly genuinely thought this was gonna be it (I will never learn) as I broke down in front of him and explained how much it is affecting me but then tonight he got drunk again, and whilst he didn't specifically abuse me he started winding up Bentley and shouting in the kitchen and just being a prick tbh. 

I have decided, although his constant outbreaks ruin my appetite and make me feel hopeless and depressed etc the only way I will get better, mentally and physically is if I keep going regardless and get strong enough to move out. I just can't rely on him - and thats the bottom line. He can be great at times and can be so good to me but it never lasts and it is so fucking inconsistent. One minute I am doing so well and am the best daughter ever. The next I am going to be sectioned and would be better off dead. Trying to navigate this is killing me, so I am just going to stop, stop trying to please him, stop relying on him for approval, stop listening to the abuse. Venting on here is so therapeutic- sorry if it is boring etc but honestly it’s been SO helpful! 

Ugh mentally I am just exhausted! Physically too ngl! But at least I can sit and say I am proud of myself because I am trying, trying my best and have made significant improvements! Food indecision is still crippling me at times but luckily I have support from one of you with this which is saving my bacon at the minute! I also am struggling with what I like to call the ‘variety demon’ telling me I need to try something new every meal/snack otherwise it won’t be worth it and I’ll regret it! And that my dinners and lunches are too repetitive. But ya gal knows what she likes!! So yeah, trying to ignore it as much as possible and stop trying to change my meals or snacks every single time because I just get overwhelmed and then end up choosing the less energy option when I should just stick to what I know, what I like, what works! I am definitely considering though adding a ‘biscuit plate’ with my oats because I am really enjoying dipping them in the milk!! Although I already have my chocolate plates!

I also just wanted to say a massive thank you to all of you and for this community, it has saved my life. Not to be dramatic but if I didn’t have this place to vent, to receive advice, to get support, to get help idk wtf i would do!! So - THANK YOU🫶🏻hope you all had a great new year and the best 2026!

This is the year I start my foray into the hobby of homebrewing.

Wanted to reach out to the wealth of knowledge on here for insight into what all is needed in the way of equipment.

I'm planning on doing all grain brewing, and kegging the final product. Have been doing quite a bit of reading and research as to what is needed. I'm sure I'm missing many items though, whether by oversight, or just not planning far enough ahead.

Would like to get my shopping list of items sorted, so I can place orders with various vendors, and get the ball rolling.

Started placing my orders online today.
Here's what I've got coming so far:
Brewzilla Gen 4, 35L.
Brewzilla neoprene jacket.
Brewzilla whirlpool arm.
Barley Crusher malt mill.
24"" SS mash paddle.
Fermzilla All Rounder (accessory bundle).
Refractometer.

For a fermentation chamber, I'll need:
7 cf freezer.
Fermwrap for heating.
Inkbird 308 to control heat/cool.
Fan to circulate air inside freezer.

For dry hopping, I'll need:
Sous vide magnets.
Muslin bag.

For kegging, I'll need:
Corny keg or 2.
CO2 bottle.

For extras for the Brewzilla, I've read:
Silicon Tubing to transfer wort to Fermzilla.
Garden Hose quick connects for the chiller.

So, what am I missing?
Picnic tap for keg?
Pressure gauge for CO2 bottle?
Coffee Urn or something to heat sparge water.
Obviously Barley, Hops, Yeast 😂
StarSan for cleaning, anything else?
Other enzymes or additives for brewing?
Equipment for transferring from Ferm to Keg?

No, I don't think I am especially attractive. I'm 58 and the lines on my face and neck. Aldi short pear. Barely an A-cup but with plus size hips lol. But I'm petite. And some, especially insecure, men go crazy for that. They want a little girl they can infantilize. So, yeah, double ick.

The short answer is yes, but it depends on how you use them.

**How Smart Plugs Save Energy**

Smart plugs work by cutting power to devices that draw electricity even when turned off. Your TV, coffee maker, and computer charger all use ""phantom power"" when plugged in. This standby power can add up to 10% of your monthly electric bill.

When you connect these devices through smart plugs, you can completely cut their power remotely or set schedules. No more energy waste from devices sitting idle.

**Real Money Savings**

The average household spends about $100 per year on phantom power. Smart plugs can reduce this by 60-80%. That means potential savings of $60-80 annually. Since basic smart plugs cost around $10-15 each, they typically pay for themselves within 3-6 months.

**Best Devices to Use Smart Plugs With**

You'll see the biggest savings when you use smart plugs with high-energy devices like space heaters, window AC units, and entertainment centers. These draw significant power even in standby mode.

Smart plugs also work great with lamps, fans, and small appliances you forget to unplug. The scheduling feature means you never leave things running accidentally.

**Additional Benefits Beyond Energy Savings**

Smart plugs offer convenience that goes beyond saving money. You can control devices from anywhere using your phone. Set your coffee maker to start before you wake up or turn on lights while you're traveling to make your home look occupied.

Some smart plugs include energy monitoring features. These show exactly how much power each device uses, helping you identify energy hogs in your home.

**Making Smart Plugs Work for You**

To maximize savings, focus on devices that stay plugged in 24/7. Don't waste smart plugs on things you already unplug regularly. The biggest impact comes from automating devices you normally leave connected.

Look for smart plugs with scheduling features and energy monitoring. These extra functions help you optimize your energy use and track your actual savings over time.

If you're ready to start cutting your energy costs, check out some highly-rated smart plug options at https://athomewave.com/smart-plugs. The investment in a few quality smart plugs can lead to noticeable savings on your next electric bill.

Smart plugs won't dramatically slash your energy costs, but they provide steady savings with zero effort once set up. For most households, they're a simple way to reduce waste and gain convenient control over home devices.",1,1767309377.0,ProductNew,0,1.0,False

I know there is a lot of hype around the ZP6 but also a lot of caveats- like everything tastes really thin or lacking body. Still, I can’t help but speculate a more uniform grind would certainly benefit my desire to get more out of my specialty coffees, get closer to actually tasting those notes, and improve consistency in my daily brew.

I am currently using an azontion grinder off amazon and I do like it but being budget I worry it’s the weakest link in my set up and I could be getting more out. 

My preference/ use case: 
+ usually natural process Ethiopians
+ light and medium roast
+ never dark
+ not usually floral but fruity/ funky
+ brewed with a flatbed + v60
+ value some body and simplicity
+ small as it is, I prefer the magnetic catch cup 


Since reservations I have:
- the screw catch up on the ZP6 has no grip
- the ZP6 really only shines on the light florals
- the ZP6 makes brewing more complex or tedious instead of making the whole experience easier.

I am open to other suggestions- any help is really appreciated! Thanks :)

1q1i752,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1i752,Gryff 😍 And piss off Dani 🤮,"Gryff is so sweet, I love him. I gotta say though, Fusebox is SO dumb with their writing. They make it so that Gryff is only into me, not at all into Dani. On the video call we had together during Casa, when MC asked if he was hoping to be compatible with a specific person there, Gryff said he wasn’t really ‘hoping’ to be most compatible with anyone there, but he had an idea of who it probably was. So from the beginning, he wasn’t feeling it.

But then we get back to the villa and although he doesn’t flirt with Dani, he doesn’t tell her they’re just platonic and he just awkwardly stays quiet or swerves/doesn’t respond to her advances. And it keeps on happening even after he tells me that he told Dani that he only has for me and they’re on the same page now. But she keeps flirting with him as if they’re a proper romantic couple and he keeps vaguely dodging. Like… Dani, weren’t you listening to what Gryff said? And Gryff, can’t you remind her like “hey, sorry, but I like MC and I’m not into you like that”? Fusebox is so dumb putting in drama that doesn’t even make sense. Give our men some fucking backbone, that’d be so much hotter and funner to read.

ALSO, Dani in those last pictures saying the OG couples were “old flames” for a reason (after Gryff told her he only had eyes for me btw) is so dumb. Cause… the reason is that Love Island forcibly separated all the couples even though NOBODY asked for it. There was no falling out or drifting apart, be so for real girl 😭 It’s so stupid how in this season, they act like everyone in a couple is boyfriend/girlfriend and it’s so *scandalous* that people can be into someone else. Like, being in a couple in Love Island only loosely means that you share a bed together, and you’re partnered up in challenges. It doesn’t mean jack shit, really 😭 There are no loyalties you must abide by, we are ALL single until someone makes it exclusive on their own terms, Love Island can’t do that for you.

Okay, rant over. Point is, I really love Gryff, but I really hate Fusebox’s writing to create drama that shouldn’t exist, and acting like Love Island couples are supposed to act married and that me and Gryff broke up and are “old flames” or some shit.

1q1i47t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1q1i47t/seeking_balance_between_medicated_and_unmedicated/,Seeking balance between medicated and unmedicated existence,"Hello. I wanted to share my perspective on life with a schizotypal personality disorder and possibly check out some of the advice you people can give on seeking life balance with medication in it. 

Last year, I have arrived at a psychiatrist's office with paranoia, psychosis, recreational self harm, and manic symptoms. I have described to the doctor how there were times I used to look for cameras in mirrors and microphones in electric outlets, how neighbors listen to what I say to myself and people I live with, and how I thought my family genuinely wanted to throw me out of our home in winter after a bad breakup of mine. The doctor had described me as a schizotypal person and prescribed cariprazine to me. 

Now I'd like to draw a comparison between the conditions I experience when I do take the medicine and when I don't for about two weeks or so. 

On medication, thoughts come one after another, sometimes there actually are none of them, I was shocked to conciously feel genuine empathy for the first time when I started taking the pills so we can add that too. However, there's a cycle, first you start taking pills and all the sleep debt comes up, your sleep schedule gradually changes and waking up at 6 or even 5 am stops being a big deal, this part is great. Then you are actually able to concentrate on tasks without intrusive or worrying thoughts, which is great, too. But then, about a couple of weeks later, you cannot simply exist without drinking 6 cups of coffee daily. You feel just so sedated, and life looses all feelings, they're dull, and stale. So you stop taking pills. 

Unmedicated, (I major in compsci, so this comparison comes up first to my mind) it feels like multithreading and multiprocessing are activated in your head, so there are like seven or eight thoughts rushing there all over each other, and none of them is controlled by you. Music does not have enough music in it so you make it faster and louder. Every cell of your body feels like there's at least some small component that's explosive, and sleep is almost unachievable. My special feature of it all is violent tendencies. Loads of violent, brutal intrusive thoughts and desires flood my mind, and every affect feels so deep and strong albeit painful. I won't dive deep. And paranoia, suspecting everyone of everything. 

In order to determine when it is best to start taking pills again, I have concocted a list of criteria that I check my thought process with. It is as following: 

Restart medication when you encounter:
- Highly polarised thinking
- Unpassing desire to hurt someone
- Sense of paranoia or doubt in close ones' itentions
- There is a strong tendency to ruminate and most thoughts have a definitive background theme (like nothing has purpose or things C and D must be done to person A) 

So far this works well for me. I am obviously seeking additional professional help and considering asking my psychiatrist to try other medications, but it'll be interesting to hear something from this community if someone has similar experience with balancing life like this.

However, it has this bizarre foam-like gunk on it, and I want to know how best to clean it and re-finish the area without damaging the rest of the finish. I am not skilled in wood care (the last woodworking I did was middle school shop class) and in order to rescue the table from its dusty life in a basement, I had to make the case that I'd clean it up properly. 

And so I come to you, hat in hand. Please see photos for details on said gunk. When I say foamy, I mean it has a similar texture to the blocks in a foam pit, but then it's hardened and crunchy closer to and right on the table itself, almost like stale bread, except it's not. This gunk has been there for at least four years, maybe five. What do I need to do to take this crap off and make it like it was never there? The finish color isn't my favorite, but I'm not sure re-finishing the whole thing right now would go over well with living family members, so I'd like to keep the fix as close to normal for now. Thanks in advance for the help!",0,1767308901.0,woodworking,3,0.5,False

The basis was a new technique – the bending of solid wood – that Michael Thonet developed and perfected during the 1850s, and it was the first time serial furniture production was possible. And then there was an ingenious distribution model: 36 disassembled chairs could be packed into a one cubic metre box, shipped throughout the world and then assembled on site. With its clear, reduced aesthetics, this classic has been used in a wide variety of settings for more than 150 years.*

Nikolytics Radio is a late-night jazz station for founders who work too late. 3-hour YouTube videos. AI-generated jazz. A tired DJ named Sonny Nix who checks in between tracks with deadpan observations about your inbox, your pipeline, and why that proposal is still sitting in drafts.

Five volumes in five days. 70+ subscribers. 14k views on the first Reddit post.

It’s a passion project that doubles as marketing for my automation consultancy.

-----

**The concept**

The pitch: You’re at your desk at 3 AM. Everyone’s asleep. You put on Nikolytics Radio. A weathered voice observes your situation with dark humor. He’s been where you are. He doesn’t fix it. He just… sees it. Then plays a record.

The DJ (Sonny Nix) is a former founder who burned out and now plays jazz for strangers. He has recurring “listeners” who write in: Todd from Accounting whose job got automated, Margaret from Operations who finished her task list and doesn’t know what to do with herself.

It’s 95% vibe, 5% branding. If you removed every mention of my business, the station would still work. That’s the point.

-----

**The tech stack**

**Music generation:** Suno

I wrote 49 artist-specific prompts optimized for deep work. Each prompt targets a specific jazz style piano trio, cool trumpet, tenor ballad, etc. Settings: Instrumental only, ~3-4 min tracks, specific mood tags.

Example prompt structure:

```
jazz, 1950s late-night jazz combo: brushed kit, upright bass walking gently, 
warm felted piano carrying the main theme, soft brass pads... 
[mood tags: soft, warm, slow, lounge, nostalgic]
```

Generate 3-4 per prompt, pick the best, discard anything too busy or with abrupt endings.

**Voice generation:** ElevenLabs

Custom voice clone for Sonny Nix. I use their V3 model with specific audio tags:

- `[mischievously]` - dry humor, irony
- `[whispers]` - punchlines, gut punches
- `[sighs]` - weariness
- `[excited]` - mock ads only (ironic use)
- `...` - pauses

V3 doesn’t support some tags like [warm] or [tired], so the *words* have to carry the emotion. Write tired sentences. Sorrowful observations.

**Script writing:** txt

I mostly write the scripts, claude double checks for optimizations

**Assembly:** Logic Pro

120 BPM grid. Drop the tracks, drop the voice clips. Crossfade. Each episode is ~30 drops across 3 hours. Export as MP3.

**Video:** FFmpeg

Static image + audio. One command:

```
ffmpeg -loop 1 -i image.png -i audio.mp3 -c:v libx264 -tune stillimage 
-c:a aac -b:a 320k -shortest output.mp4
```

-----

**The writing system**

Each episode has 30 “drops” — short DJ segments between songs:

- **Station IDs** - Quick brand hits (“Nikolytics Radio… still here.”)
- **Bumpers** - One-liners (“The coffee’s cold. You noticed an hour ago. Still drinking it.”)
- **Pain points** - Observations that hit too close (“Revision eight. The scope tripled. The budget didn’t.”)
- **Testimonials** - Fictional listeners writing in
- **Mock ads** - Parody sponsor segments (“Introducing Scope Creep Insurance…”)
- **Dedications** - “This one goes out to everyone who almost quit today…”
- **Recurring segments** - Pipeline Weather, Outreach Report, Inbox Conditions

The key insight: Sonny has emotional range. He’s not monotone. He moves between tired, mischievous, sorrowful. He worries about Todd. He offers brief sympathy to Sarah. Then plays a record.

**What worked**

1. **The vibe is the moat.** Most automation consultants are boring. This is different enough that people share it.
2. **Worldbuilding compounds.** Todd’s promotion arc. Margaret’s puzzle. Callbacks like “Here it’s always 3 AM.” Returning listeners feel like regulars.
3. **Reddit got it started.** First post on r/productivity got 14k views. Someone called it “Slop Radio FM.” Now that’s a badge of honor we reference in the show.
4. **Daily uploads built momentum.** Five volumes in five days. The algorithm likes consistency.

-----

**What I learned about AI voice**

- ElevenLabs V3 is good but literal. It interprets quotes as character voices (breaks everything). Always paraphrase.
- Tags only work if the model supports them. No [warm], no [tired]. The text has to do the work.
- Regenerate 2-3x per drop, pick the best take. Same script, different reads.
- Punchlines land in `[whispers]`. Setup is `[mischievously]`. Then stop — no extra lines after the joke lands.

-----

**Time investment**

- Initial setup (prompts, character docs, templates): ~15 hours
- Per episode now: ~2 hours
  - Generate music: 30 min
  - Generate voice drops: 30 min
  - Assembly in Logic: 30 min
  - YouTube upload + description: 30 min

**What could be automated further**

- **Voice generation** - Currently pasting drops one by one into ElevenLabs. Could batch via API.
- **Timestamps** - Calculating from bar positions manually. Already wrote a Python script, could integrate it.
- **YouTube description** - Template exists, still copy-pasting. Easy n8n automation.
- **Episode assembly** - The real bottleneck. Logic Pro is manual drag-and-drop. Exploring scripted alternatives.

Writing stays mine. 

The dream: one-click episode generation. Not there yet, but the pieces exist.

**TL;DR:** Built a fake radio station with AI music (Suno), AI voice (ElevenLabs), and my scripts. The DJ has a character bible. There’s lore. It’s marketing for my automation business but also just… a thing that exists now. 70 subscribers in 5 days.",4,1767308744.0,ChatGPTCoding,0,1.0,False
