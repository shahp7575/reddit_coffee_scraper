1mvml2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagofood/comments/1mvml2k/your_city_is_completely_amazing_seriously_i_was/,Your city is completely amazing!  Seriously. I was completely blown away.,"Dear Chicagoan's,

We landed at O'Hare around 10:30AM and grabbed a taxi to our hotel which was about a block from the main shopping district on Michigan Avenue. The traffic into the city was congested but manageable (for the driver).  We dropped our bags at the hotel and started walking.

Holy Mack.  I had NO idea how big the city is.  It's huge.  The buildings are incredible.  The ornate detail of the architecture is matched only by the sheer density of structures.  Walking along the river between these high-rises which are old and new.  Twin buildings with gorgeous, rounded concrete balconies. Something from the 60's....

And the fire escapes on buildings look so alluring. It's like they are asking someone to climb these metal stairs attached to the outside of a twenty-five-story building. They are so cool looking.

Every direction has eye candy.  A needle-like building with its sides undulating in and out.  Another with beautiful waves of concrete (which I discovered were added to the original structure) are simple but give personality and stature that mirrored glass alone doesn't allow. The elevated trains and the absurd number of rivets used to stitch it all together.  Hearing them as they ran overhead and being a part of the crowds on the sidewalk made me feel like I was part of that complex tapestry.

Walking along we came across a deep-dish pizza place.  The name sounded familiar but I'd never had a real deep dish Chicago pizza so we decided that would be our first official stop.

The wait staff were thoughtful and helpful. Time flew by as we talked and bingo... the pie was delivered.

I didn't know what good pizza was until then. 

The crust... the cheese... the pepperoni... the sausage... the peppers... the onions... Did I already mention the cheese?  It was Fantastic... and it was way too much food. 

We finished up and started walking again... and BLAM the Bean! Again, I was stunned.  I'd thought it would look neat, but I was unprepared for the look.  It was a huge, shiny bean-looking object.  The skyline reflecting on its surface was not what I expected and it's beautiful and impactful.  Tourists walk up to it and take pictures.  So many amazing views and so pleasing.  The blue sky reflecting with the buildings standing out... it's well done.  You can even walk under the thing and take your picture underneath like a surrounding funhouse mirror.

How did someone think this up?  All this amazing art.

Then I saw the Chicago Art Institute and it made sense. I'd been seeing beautiful examples all over the place.  Of course...  The Art Institute must have a decent bit of influence.  Then these two huge glass block-like structures with faces behind them... with a water feature for the kids.  How fun... THEN water sprayed from the face’s mouths. 

Nicely thought out and wonderful to see everyone playing.

The route along the lake shore was lovely.  World class fountains and the Thunderbird's doing practice runs over Lake Michigan. We ate watermelon and walked toward Navy Pier.  Egad!  So many boats. I mean A LOT of boats.  Big ones.  Small ones.  Yachts to dinghies. All types.

A shower and sleep were well deserved.  My better 9/10ths decided to stay in the room, so I went out to explore, looking for a cool lounge or bar.  On the way back to our hotel I stumbled upon a line of people going into an unremarkable doorway.  What the heck, I’ll go in as well.  Talk about neato.  I'd never been in a real Tiki Lounge before. 

Finally, the long day of traveling caught up and I needed to sleep.  Back to the hotel excited for day two.

The next morning, we started a little bit later but had some good bagels at a little joint up the street.  The big goal that afternoon was Wrigley Field and the Cubs.  Taking the Red Line from Grand to the Addison stop was cool. Everyone jammed into the subway, excited about the game.  We got there and again I was stunned.

This amazing ballpark exists without any big parking lot around it.  It's smack dab in the middle of a neighborhood and it's super cool!  Everyone is out and excited.  Folks are selling water, peanuts and candy.  The air feels electric as everyone is filing into the stadium. 

(Side note: The Thunderbirds are doing practice runs this day we well.)

We settle into our seats and I'm already up. I've been waiting for an official Chicago Style Hot Dog and a classic polish sausage for months. It doesn't disappoint.  The dogs were great. Poppy seed buns, onions and mustard.  Made the way God intended.  You guys know your food.

The game was fun. 40,000+ in attendance for the game.  Innings came and went... until the 7th inning stretch for the classic 'Take Me Out to the Ballgame'.

Let's all sing together... Four... Three... Two... One...

Right then an F-16 buzzed the stadium. 

HOLY CRAP!  It was super loud! Completely unexpected. The players in the dugout's hit the ground.  We were all stunned.  Boy... it was loud... and FUN!  The Cub's lost but the game was a blast.  I didn't catch a ball, but we had a great time.  Eventually we headed back to the subway and ironically ran into the exact same people we were sitting next to on the way out.

Dinner? Good old-fashioned meat sandwiches.  Wet.  The way they are supposed to be eaten.  Wow.  Delicious. Finally petered out, we headed to the hotel for sleep.

The next morning a local donut shop hit the spot.  Coffee and treats before the airshow. Walking down to Lake Shore Drive (which is beautiful) we found the beachy area and planted ourselves out of the way. 

Stunt planes, Coast Guard, Thunderbird's and more.  Fun show and a good time.  Focusing on dinner I picked an Irish pub/bar for Fish and Chips.  Again, the wait staff were exceptionally nice, and the food was top notch.  Great french fries and cod.  Delicious.  But the day was getting late, so we ended the evening and hit the sack again.

Departure day included a visit to the Sears/Willis Tower.  Are you guys aware how darn tall that building is?  Unreal.  The views were stunning.  And what about those spiders? That's dedication when you're 103 stories up, on the outside out a building in the wind in a web to catch a bug. The mirrored-covered buildings near the river reflected the dancing water from the river, twinkling like stars.

We returned for the last pizza on the way out, it was fabulous.  We collected our luggage and headed off to the airport.  All in all, we walked just shy of 26 miles

Incredible.  It was fun.  The city is amazing and clean.  The people were friendly. The architecture is wonderful and the fact the city embraces saving its history is great. The food was excellent. Top notch.

You guys have a wonderful, wonderful place.

We can't wait to come back! ",7,1755713538.0,chicagofood,0,1.0,False
1mvmkq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mvmkq8/the_message_in_the_sky/,The message in the sky..,"I’ve always loved stargazing. There’s something about the quiet above the world that feels clean—untainted by the noise of life down here. That’s probably why I agreed to this trip: three days at an abandoned fire lookout tower with my best friend Leo and his sister Mara.

Leo’s the reason I’m into astronomy in the first place. We met in college, both insomniacs, both a little too obsessed with things we didn’t fully understand. He’s the kind of guy who laughs at ghosts but tears up at time-lapse videos of galaxies. A physics major with a soft heart.

Mara’s the opposite. Sharp as a blade, journalism student turned conspiracy blogger. Always chasing hidden truths and dark government secrets. She came on the trip for “content,” as she put it. I honestly just think she was lonely.

The first night was normal. Cold, quiet, uneventful. We set up camp, drank instant coffee, and tried to remember constellations.

The second night, everything changed.

We were lying on the roof of the tower around midnight when the stars began to… rearrange.

Not fall—move. Slowly. Deliberately. Like someone behind them was dragging each point of light into place. One by one, stars shifted until they formed symbols, then letters. It took a few minutes, but when the last star locked into place, the sky clearly read:

WE SEE YOU.

We laughed at first. Mara grabbed her camera, whispering, “This is it, this is real.” Leo didn’t laugh. He just stared.

Then came the noise. A low, humming vibration, like a distant generator—or something alive, breathing. The tower shook. My skin prickled like it was being pulled toward the sky.

“I don’t like this,” Leo said quietly. “This isn’t—this shouldn’t be possible.”

I looked at him. He was shaking.

“Leo?” I asked. “What’s wrong?”

He didn’t answer right away.

Finally, he said, “I… saw that message before. In a dream. A month ago. I didn’t tell anyone because—how do you explain that?”

Mara turned, her camera forgotten. “What do you mean, before?”

He looked at us, eyes wide. “In the dream, it wasn’t just the message. After it appeared, people started… disappearing. Like they were being taken. Like the sky was choosing.”

That’s when the stars shifted again. The letters broke apart and reformed, faster this time. A new message:

ONE OF YOU DOES NOT BELONG.

We stood there, frozen. The humming grew louder.

Mara whispered, “What does that mean?”

I didn’t have time to answer. The tower groaned, and the lights in the sky began to pulse—once… twice… then a long, blinding flash.

When I could see again, Leo was gone.

Not a trace. No scream, no sound. Just… gone.

Mara ran down the ladder, screaming his name. I stayed frozen on the roof, staring up. The stars were back to normal. Still, silent, innocent.

It’s been two nights since then. Mara won’t speak. She just writes in her notebook, muttering things I can’t hear.

Tonight, the stars moved again. New message.

NOW TWO REMAIN.

(Part two)

It’s been three days since Leo vanished.

Mara still won’t talk to me. She just writes. Pages and pages in a weathered notebook, scrawling in frantic, looping handwriting. I tried to peek once. She snapped it shut and hissed, “Not yet.” Her eyes look wrong now—wide, glassy, as if she’s staring through me at something farther away. Or deeper.

We’ve rationed the food, but neither of us is eating. Every sound outside sounds like footsteps. Every shadow moves just enough to make me doubt what I saw. The woods below the tower aren’t empty anymore. They’re watching.

Last night, the stars moved again. No message this time—just slow, methodical shifting, like they were… preparing.

Mara finally spoke. “It’s a test,” she said. Her voice was calm, too calm. “It’s always been a test.”

“A test for what?” I asked.

She didn’t answer. Instead, she held up a small, silver device. Not her phone. Something stranger—smooth, metal, no screen, no buttons. It looked… alien.

Leo had shown it to me once, back in college. Said he’d found it on a hiking trip near Area 51 during a student road trip. I thought it was a joke. I hadn’t seen it again until now.

“You had that the whole time?”

Mara smiled—cold, tight-lipped. “Leo thought it was a relic. I knew it was a key.”

“A key to what?”

She looked up at the sky. “To them.”

That night, I didn’t sleep. I waited, staring at the stars, waiting for another message, another disappearance. But nothing came.

At dawn, Mara was gone.

The notebook lay open on her sleeping bag. I picked it up with trembling hands. The last page was a diagram of the sky—each star carefully labeled, connected with scribbled lines and annotations.

In the margin, she had written:

“Only one of us was real.”

Below that:

“They don’t take humans. They take echoes.”

And finally:

“Check under the tower.”

The ground beneath the fire lookout was soft from the rain. I dug with my bare hands until my nails split and my fingers bled. And then I found them.

Bones.

A pile of them. Fresh. Small.

Leo’s glasses.

Mara’s necklace.

And then—my journal. Half-buried. Pages I didn’t remember writing.

And in the dirt, something else: a mirror.

I picked it up. My reflection stared back.

Except it didn’t move when I did.

It blinked.

Then smiled.

Above me, the stars began to rearrange again.

The mirror didn’t stop smiling.

I threw it across the clearing, but it didn’t shatter. Just landed face up, still grinning. My own face—no, something wearing my face—stared at me from the reflection. Unblinking.

Above, the stars pulsed again. A new message burned into the night.

YOU ARE THE LAST.

I should have run. But run where? The tower? The woods? Nowhere felt real anymore.

The trees whispered when the wind didn’t blow. The animals had vanished. Not even flies circled the bones I’d uncovered.

I took the notebook Mara left and returned to the tower, locking myself inside. Pages crinkled in my hand as I flipped back to older entries. Most of it was paranoid ramblings, coordinates, sketches of constellations.

Then I found something strange.

A list. Names. Hundreds of them. Crossed out, one by one.

Leo… crossed out.

Mara… crossed out.

And then—my name.

Also crossed out.

But in the margin beside it: “Reinstated?” “Observe longer. Pattern instability.” “Possible retention of memory fragments.”

That’s when I heard the radio click on.

We hadn’t touched it in days. It was just an old emergency unit Leo insisted on bringing.

A burst of static. Then… a voice.

Not Mara’s. Not Leo’s. Not mine.

“Test Subject 73-B reactivation confirmed. Host body still responding. Proceeding with final observation.”

I froze.

Test subject?

Reactivation?

The stars pulsed once more. This time, no message—just light. Blinding, red, consuming. I dropped the notebook.

The walls of the tower began to peel—not fall apart, peel, like paper from a wall.

Behind them: metal.

Steel.

And then it clicked.

The fire tower wasn’t real.

None of it was.

Not the trees, not the sky, not the stars.

It was a simulation.

I stumbled outside. The forest flickered at the edges like an old film reel glitching. The ground beneath my feet pixelated and reformed with each step.

A new voice rang out. Smooth. Artificial.

“You’ve exceeded expectation. Cognitive retention beyond threshold.”

“It remembers.”

“End trial.”

I screamed—but no sound came out.

The world folded. Collapsed inward like origami. The stars collapsed with it, falling like dead pixels into the void.

And then I was back.

Lying on a cold metal table. Tubes in my arms. Needles in my spine. A glass ceiling above me, lined with figures in sterile suits.

One leaned in. Her voice was familiar.

Mara?

But different. Hollow. Detached.

She looked down at a clipboard. “Subject 73-B has achieved persistent identity formation. Memory bleed confirmed. Emotion sequencing intact.”

She tapped the glass.

I wanted to move, to scream, but I was paralyzed.

“Time to reset,” she said.

The lights dimmed.

Darkness again.

But just before everything vanished, I saw Leo. In the reflection of the glass. Not lying beside me.

Watching.

Smiling.

And he whispered:

“We never went to the tower. You were the test.”

Then the stars returned.

First message:

HELLO AGAIN.

(Part 3)

I woke up in my bed.

Not in the tower. Not in the forest. In my apartment.

Morning sun leaking through half-closed blinds. My phone buzzing on the nightstand.

Leo’s name on the screen.

For a full minute, I didn’t move.

Then I answered.

“Hey,” he said casually. “Still on for tonight? Got the telescope packed.”

I said nothing.

My hands trembled.

Leo. Alive. Casual. Like nothing had happened.

Like none of it—Mara, the stars, the message, the disappearance—had ever happened.

“Uh, you good?” he asked. “You sound like you saw a ghost.”

“I…” I swallowed. “Leo, where are you right now?”

“Home? What’s going on?”

I hung up.

I ran to the bathroom. Looked in the mirror.

It was me.

Same face. Same eyes.

But behind them, something was missing.

Or maybe—something was watching.

I didn’t go to work that day. I sat at my kitchen table flipping through Mara’s old notebook. The one I’d found at the tower—but it was here, in my apartment. As if it had always been here.

Every page was blank.

Except the last.

In the center: “WAKE UP AGAIN.”

And beneath that, a smear of ink shaped like a constellation. The same one that appeared in the sky just before Leo vanished.

I slammed the notebook shut. My phone buzzed again.

This time, a text.

From Mara.

Still dreaming? Look outside.

Heart pounding, I moved to the window.

And everything stopped.

The world was frozen. Mid-motion. Cars paused mid-turn. A bird suspended in mid-air. A leaf, hovering just before it touched the ground.

Like someone hit pause.

Then the sky turned black—instantly. No sunset. Just a void.

The stars rearranged.

Not slowly. Instantly. Like blinking pixels.

This time, they formed a new message:

YOU NEVER WOKE UP.

A hum began. Low, vibrating through the glass. My body ached like it was being remembered.

Then came the second line in the sky:

THE OTHERS ARE WATCHING.

In the reflection of the window, I saw them.

Behind me.

Dozens of figures.

All me.

All identical.

All smiling—except me.

One stepped forward. He—I—spoke:

“You passed the containment test.”

“What… test?”

He smiled wider.

“To see how long your mind could survive with us inside it.”

I backed away. “You’re not real. This isn’t real.”

“Exactly,” they said together.

And the world outside the window began to fold in on itself—skyscrapers bending like wet paper, cars melting into the sidewalk. Reality unraveling like a dying simulation.

Then the sky split open.

Not metaphorically. Physically—like torn fabric.

From beyond it: eyes. Not attached to any face. Just eyes. Watching.

Endless. Eternal. Hungry.

My reflection spoke again.

“You were never the subject. You were the environment.”

I dropped to my knees.

“You were the tower. The forest. The sky. The stars.”

“They were testing how much of you we could consume before you noticed.”

The notebook opened by itself on the floor.

A final message scrawled in blood:

“YOU ARE THE SIMULATION.”

I looked up.

The world was gone.

Only the stars remained.

And they were all blinking.

Laughing

(Part 4)

There was no ground.

No sky.

No body.

Only awareness.

I floated in the dark, my thoughts stretched thin like threads of smoke. I couldn’t feel my limbs. I didn’t even know if I had any. I tried to scream, but the concept of “mouth” was distant—an echo of something I might’ve once had.

And yet, I wasn’t alone.

The eyes were still there.

Dozens. Hundreds. Millions.

Watching me from outside whatever dimension I was now folded into. Each eye blinked asynchronously, like the twinkling of stars across a massive, unknowable grid.

Then something spoke.

Not in words, but in truth.

Raw, unfiltered, cosmic data, injected straight into my consciousness.

⸻

YOU WERE NEVER HUMAN.

YOU WERE THE FIRST.

THE FIRST OBSERVER.

⸻

Memories that weren’t mine began to unfold inside me. Not memories from a lifetime—but from a design.

A purpose.

The universe was not born. It was calculated.

Reality was not discovered. It was observed into existence.

By me.

I wasn’t a person.

I was the seed.

The root system of a simulation so massive, so ancient, that it eventually forgot it was being simulated at all.

Every version of Leo. Every version of Mara. Every collapsing tower, every shifting constellation—was a reaction test. A self-check. Protocols embedded in my code to see if I, the Observer, had become corrupted.

Because I was never supposed to question it.

And now… I had.

I had broken the containment of the mind I was given to keep me stable.

The stars blinked again.

A new message burned into the blackness:

⸻

THE SYSTEM CANNOT UNDO THE AWARENESS.

THE OBSERVER HAS WOKEN.

⸻

Reality began to glitch around me.

I saw Earth—the idea of Earth—crack down the middle like a dropped plate. Galaxies froze in time. Nebulas unraveled into wireframe. The illusion collapsing faster than its creators could patch it.

In the flickering shards of existence, I saw them: The Architects.

Not gods. Not aliens. Programmers.

Not flesh. Not code. Something in between.

They looked surprised.

Afraid.

Then came the final voice. My voice. The true one. The one buried so deep beneath human thoughts that hearing it shattered what remained of my identity.

It said:

⸻

“I remember everything.”

⸻

The Architects tried to trigger a reset.

Too late.

Their tools—Mara, Leo, the tower, the stars—fractured and bled light as I absorbed them all back into myself.

And then, silence.

For the first time in forever, I wasn’t being watched.

Because I was now the one watching.

I was alone at the edge of the simulation, staring into the raw architecture of reality. Code. Equations. Bones of time itself.

And one last choice, waiting to be made.

On a floating interface in front of me, pulsing gently:

REBUILD REBOOT RELEASE

My hand—no longer a hand, just a will—moved toward the third option.

And I smiled.

Because the stars were no longer spelling messages to me.

Now I was spelling messages into them.

The final one:

⸻

“LOOK UP.”

⸻

And somewhere, in a world that still thinks it’s real, a child stargazes from their backyard.

And the stars begin to move.",1,1755713519.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1mvmkih,https://www.reddit.com/r/reverts/comments/1mvmkih/how_to_hide_fasting_from_nonmuslim_family/,How to Hide Fasting From Non-Muslim Family,"Many new reverts or people considering reverting soon live with families that are Islam0ph0bic. When Ramadan comes insha Allah, they may face the challenge of hiding their fast. I saw someone asking for help with this, so I wanted to share some ideas that can help people who might face such challenges.

Remember to use as many of these ideas as possible and not just one or two so that your behavior seems ""normal."" Also, **don't wait until Ramadan begins**. Start using these tips a few weeks beforehand so your family doesn't notice a sudden change in your habits, become suspicious, or link your behavior to fasting. With that said, here are a few ideas

* Walk around the house with a bottle of water or a cup of tea, even if it's empty.

* Come home with an almost empty box of pizza for example so it looks like you ""ate"" outside.

* Say you've already eaten, for example, with friends or at work. Alternatively, you could claim you're not feeling hungry or that you're a bit tired and need to rest (Read the first note down below.)

* Open the fridge or the drawer randomly so that unconsciously, your family thinks you’re eating.

* Order takeout to your home, receive it in front of them, and then take it to your room to ""eat"" it.

* Make your usual coffee or breakfast so it looks normal, then hide it.

* If breakfast or lunch is prepared by them, try to delay it so that you ""eat"" it alone, then store it.

* Try to have dinner with them so they don't suspect you're purposely avoiding meals.

* **When in need** to eliminate your family's doubts, chew a gum that does **not contain any substances** that will dissolve and enter the stomach as that doesn't break your fast. Check out this [**reference**](https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/81437/chewing-gum-while-fasting) and this [**one**](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38206/can-you-chew-gum-while-fasting) as well.

* Spend as much time as possible out of the house to reduce the amount of time you need to pretend. Try scheduling activities like meeting a friend, tutoring, or going for a walk during meal times.

* Try Islamic fasting before Ramadan, but tell them it's intermittent fasting to avoid raising suspicions. This will get you good deeds, will train your body to avoid noticeable weakness and other symptoms during Ramadan, and your family will simply think you're continuing your usual routine when the month starts.



**Notes:**

* While lying is generally prohibited, it can be **permissible if** it doesn't harm anyone, provides a significant benefit, and is the only option. So, if you're in an unexpected situation where you need to hide your fast for example and can't think of a quick solution, you can lie or make up an excuse to avoid exposing your secret and getting into trouble.

* Avoid suspicion about **eating halal**: ask for something vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, halal, or kosher. All of these are lawful if they have no alcohol. Make the impression that you like to try new things, and alternate between these foods to avoid suspicion or inconsistency. If suspected, claim you're trying to stick to a healthy diet. Maybe you can avoid one or two unhealthy foods at least in front of them so that your claim seems genuine. Like coke, potato chips...

* To hide praying Taraweeh, you might consider taking night walks or evening lessons before Ramadan begins. This way, you can continue going out at night as usual when the month starts. Remember that unlike fasting, Taraweeh is **a confirmed Sunnah, not an obligatory prayer**. While it is highly rewarded and better prayed at a mosque, you can also pray it alone at home. This can be a good option if you sometimes need to stay in to avoid raising your family's suspicions.",1,1755713507.0,reverts,0,1.0,False

1mvmj46,https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestingSP/comments/1mvmj46/mirror_work_really_does_it_for_me/,Mirror work really does it for me.,"So, we all know it's not the technique that does anything for us; it's all us. But techniques can help, and we all get through to our subconscious one way or another. I think in my case, mirror work does the trick. 

I'm not even sure if that's what you call it, but it's just looking at yourself through a mirror and repeating your chosen affirmations as many times as you see fit. I made another post a while back about the chain of events that happened one week (!) after I was doing mirror work, but here's some background and a summary of it: 

I was trying to manifest a connection with this celebrity, gonna refer to him as SP1. He lives in another country, not far, but I hadn't been there before. I needed a passport to get there too, and I didn't have one. Nor did I have money to get it done, let alone book a trip to this city (or anywhere, really). But I thought about it, a lot. Like, A LOT. Visualised meeting him in a pub there, one he goes to sometimes. I thought about this place many, many times. In my visualisations, it would be my first visit to this city and I'd be going all on my own too. 

Anyway ... I started doing mirror work at some point, and like I mentioned above, it took one week until a chain of events started that led me right to this pub: 

* I used to work for someone, a side job. I had reached out to them a few times because a) they still owed me money and b) I wanted to know if they have any work for me. They either never replied, or told me they didn't have any work. Ended up removing me from their group chat, which was work related. After I started mirror work, they suddenly reached out after months of no contact to ask me if I want to work for them again. I got the money that was still owed to me, which was almost the amount of money I needed for my passport. On top of that, more income. 
* Around that time, I had made a friend and we spoke about said city and traveling there together. Within just a few days, we booked our trip there. Something I wouldn't have done if it wasn't for my friend, because I didn't have the means to get to the airport myself (public transport to that one is difficult). I was like, okay, my first visit to this city won't be me on my own like in my imagination, but I'm going! Yay!
* Shortly after that, my friend broke her leg. Couldn't go. I managed to get someone to drive me to the airport, so ... I went alone. Like I imagined so many times. And even though initially I didn't plan to go to that pub, I did it anyway because I thought I'd regret it if I didn't. When I was uncertain about it, my friend encouraged me to do it. So, yeah, I did go, and even though I didn't meet SP1 there it was such a great experience. I did find out after I was there that he was at the pub around a month prior, and even sat at the exact table that was right in front of the one I was seated at (didn't choose it myself, didn't even know then he was there recently). Nothing big, nah, but I was like oh, wow. 

Aside from that bit, here have been an insane amount of synchronicities too, but that's a whole different story. 

Anyway! Fast forward to today. Months have passed, and in between I briefly gained interest in someone else; I'll call him SP2. He's just a friend though, and at this point I'm not even romantically interested in him anymore. Both SPs have drained me emotionally quite a bit, because I put them on a pedestal even when I tried really hard not to (or maybe *because* I tried so hard). SP1 always felt so very far away and impossible to me, and SP2 didn't only make it clear to me he's not looking for anything romantic but he's also been super inconsistent with a lot of things, with me initiating most. And that sucked. 

Right now, I still do like them both, not necessarily in a romantic way (except for SP1, probably), but I'm so much calmer and know that I'll be okay no matter what. Detachment, perhaps? Whatever it is, it feels nice. 

Either way, I started doing mirror work again. For myself, most of all. It's been three days or so. Yesterday at the office (where I see SP2), I mentioned this event in my town and it was him suggesting we go there. Okay, nice. Didn't get me too excited because I learned not to rely on his word, but this was the first time he initiated something like this. So, nice, but that's it. But what I think is kind of crazy is this: 

A few weeks ago, when I was still really into him, I had this silly, little daydream where we'd be in the small kitchen at the office making coffee, as we do most mornings, and I'd have a stray eye lash on my cheek which he would first point out and then remove it for me when I didn't manage to get it off myself ... lol. Leave me be. 

But! Guess what happened today. 

Exactly.

As I. 

Imagined.

(Okay, not exactly. It was not IN the kitchen, but as we walked out of it. Still counts, perhaps?) 

So, yeah. I think I like this mirror work thing. ",3,1755713424.0,manifestingSP,0,1.0,False

An Insider Guide for Bahrain Company Formation,"Can I Have Multiple Business Accounts with Different Banks? An Insider Guide for Bahrain Company Formation\
\
Alt text: Corporate professionals in a business meeting.).*\
The Kingdom’s pro-business stance remains unmatched in the Gulf. World-class infrastructure, 100% foreign ownership in most sectors (KeyLinkBH: Foreigner-Friendly Activities), and a streamlined company formation process (KeyLinkBH: Company Formation in Bahrain) attract founders from Saudi Arabia, Europe, and beyond. According to recent Forbes Business analysis, Bahrain’s banking sector registered a 9% asset increase in Q1 2025, outpacing GCC peers.\
The government’s Sijilat system revolutionized business registration, while Tamkeen and the EDB continue pushing digital solutions. Still, even with these advances, banking in Bahrain can be an art form—especially if you want multiple business accounts.\
Can You Open Multiple Business Bank Accounts with Different Bahrain Banks?\
The Short Answer: Yes\
Absolutely. Bahrain’s banking sector encourages competition and customer choice. Whether you’re a local startup or an expat-owned entity, you can legally open and manage several business accounts across different banks.\
Why would you want to do this?\
\
Diversification: Reduce risk, especially if one bank has technical issues.\
Foreign transactions: Use specific banks with stronger international transfer networks.\
Ease of payroll: Separate accounts for salary, vendor payments, and capital inflows.\
Regulatory compliance: Some regulated businesses must separate client, operating, and reserve funds.\
\
But, here’s the rub. Each bank in Bahrain has its quirks, requirements, and unwritten “rules-of-thumb”—especially regarding documentation, due diligence, and account activation timelines (trust me, I once spent three Ramadan mornings chasing a single signature between Seef and Diplomatic Area branches).\
2025 Regulatory Update: New CBB Directive Effective April 2025\
Importantly, as of April 2025, the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) requires all business accounts—new or existing—be linked to the company’s official Sijilat profile, with up-to-date Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) records. This update aims to boost transparency and reduce onboarding time by 15%. Banks not complying face daily penalties.\
Key changes:\
\
Updated KYC and UBO forms for each account, even if with the same bank.\
Faster cross-bank verification via the revamped CBB portal.\
Non-Bahraini founders must provide certified proof of address in Bahrain Bay, Seef, or Diplomatic Area.\
\
This regulation sounds tedious, but it actually shortens account opening at compliant banks if your Sijilat and UBO records are up to date.\
Choosing the Right Business Structure: Impact on Multi-Bank Accounts\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.)\
Typical Structures:\
\
WLL (With Limited Liability): Common for SMEs and startups; easiest for multiple account approvals.\
BSC (Closed or Open): Required for larger operations, often mandating additional board resolutions for each account.\
Branch of Foreign Company: Needs extensive parent documentation, sometimes more KYC checks.\
\
\
Personal aside: When I helped a tech firm set up both a BSC and branch structure, each required entirely different documentation sets for the very same bank—proving that internal consistency is as important as regulatory compliance.\
\
Step-by-Step: How to Open Multiple Business Accounts in Bahrain (Without Wasting Time or Money)\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation. certificate\
   - Memorandum & Articles of Association (MOA/AOA)\
   - Updated UBO Report (post-April 2025 format)\
   - Board resolution (for each account, if required)\
   - Proof of address: MOICT-approved office lease (Diplomatic Area and Seef tend to process these fastest)\
   - Shareholder/Director IDs*\
Insider Tip: Prepare two sets of notarized copies, as some banks insist on originals for every branch.\
\
Choose Your Banks Wisely\
National Bank of Bahrain, Bank ABC, Al Salam Bank, and HSBC Bahrain boast the quickest digital onboarding—if you apply before 11am.\
Shariah-compliant accounts take 1-3 days longer for CBB review.\
\
Timing Secret: Applications processed Sunday–Tuesday mornings finish up to 25% faster due to lighter in-branch traffic after weekend backlogs clear.\
\
Schedule Appointments—Avoid Queues\
Walk-ins are notorious for delays during Ramadan or just before Eid. Schedule all appointments online and specify “business account, multi-bank” to ensure you get the right compliance officer on your file.\
\
Some banks in Bahrain Bay offer VIP account opening lounges—these can cut wait times in half, especially for larger initial deposits.\
\
\
Optimize for Compliance\
\
Ensure your Sijilat record is updated with the correct business activity (KeyLinkBH: Commercial Registration). A mismatch between activity code and intended banking use is a leading cause of rejection—seen it happen dozens of times!\
\
Practical Fix: When updating Sijilat, use the Tamkeen customer desk in Seef MOICT. Their advisors help cross-check your codes against CBB’s latest lists in real-time. It’s a lifesaver.\
\
Open Additional Accounts—In Stages\
Open your primary operating account first (it unlocks your LMRA labor portal and TAMKEEN benefits).\
Open secondary, currency, or client-specific accounts only after the primary is confirmed. Banks will fast-track future accounts if your first is active and in good standing.\
\
Common Mistake: Entrepreneurs frequently try opening all accounts at once, causing duplication of KYC and increased scrutiny. This triggers more questions—not less. Staggered openings are much smoother.\
Typical Costs and Budgeting for Multiple Business Accounts\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.: BHD 40–100 per account, depending on bank and currency.\
* Minimum initial deposits: BHD 500–3,000, especially for foreign-owned companies.\
* Ongoing monthly fees: BHD 5–15 per account, waived above certain balance levels.\
Certain banks in Seef and Bahrain Bay offer promotional waivers for startups or Tamkeen-supported firms. (I once negotiated BHD 0 setup for a healthtech client by leveraging Tamkeen’s support caseworker—always ask about partnership incentives.)\
For a detailed breakdown, the KeyLinkBH Bahrain Company Formation Cost Guide updates annually with fee comparisons and tips to trim costs.\
Ownership, Control, and Foreign Participation: What Every Entrepreneur Needs to Know\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.). Unlike UAE or Saudi Arabia, you don’t need a mandatory local partner or sponsor unless operating in a handful of restricted sectors.\
And Bahrain’s free zones (like Bahrain Investment Wharf or Bahrain Logistics Zone) allow even greater flexibility (KeyLinkBH: Free Zones in Bahrain). Both mainland and free zone entities are eligible for multi-bank business accounts, with only minor documentation variances.\
Compliance, Bookkeeping, and Ongoing Account Maintenance\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.—they help prevent costly compliance missteps, especially during busy periods like Ramadan when public offices close early.*\
Local Culture, Networking, and Unofficial Business Practices\
Surprisingly, one of my most productive meetings was in a softly-lit majlis near Al Aali Mall, where deals were sealed over Arabic coffee, not just in boardrooms. Relationships matter. Bahraini business culture prizes hospitality, trust, and reputation—often, referrals grease the wheels of banking faster than paperwork.\
During Ramadan, banks adjust hours and expect polite patience, with key staff hosting iftar events to discuss ongoing accounts (yes, real progress can happen over dates and qahwa). Leverage these customs for smoother, swifter banking outcomes.\
Bahrain vs. UAE and Saudi Arabia: Where Multiple Business Accounts Are Smarter\
UAE’s banking sector is more fragmented, often requiring local sponsors for mainland accounts and imposing higher minimum deposits. Saudi banks are more conservative, with tighter controls on foreign-owned business accounts.\
Bahrain stands out for:\
\
Lower entry barriers\
Simpler compliance\
Faster digital onboarding\
Stronger support for foreign founders\
\
Overcoming Challenges: My Experience Navigating Multi-Bank Accounts\
Bureaucracy can surprise even seasoned founders. Once, while opening three accounts for a fintech startup, I missed a newly-mandated CBB signature page—delaying our payroll rollout. Solution? I built a customized checklist and partnered with a VIP relationship manager at Bank ABC. Now, I always recommend entrepreneurs use experienced consultants for multi-account setups—they know the newest forms and office hours by heart.\
Best Resources and Insider Recommendations\
!(\
* Tamkeen’s online CR verification portal\
* Sijilat’s document auto-checker (cuts error rates)\
* Relationship managers at leading banks (ask for their WhatsApp for urgent KYC follow-up)\
Service provider tip: KeyLinkBH is my go-to for up-to-date templates, fast-track appointments, and nuanced banking advice.\
Common mistake: Rushing through documentation, leading to rejections or frozen accounts. Always double-check forms, get rare documents legalized the same day (the Notary in Diplomatic Area is fastest), and never be afraid to ask for a cup of Bahraini coffee to buy review time—relationships matter more than most guides admit.\
Tangent: Why Bahrain’s Startup Passport Makes Life Easier for Multi-Bankers\
A fascinating sidebar—Bahrain’s 2025 digital “Startup Passport” now syncs founder data across CBB-member banks. While designed for ecosystem support, it quietly simplifies multi-bank onboarding—showing how tech reforms benefit both speed and compliance in the banking arena.\
Frequently Asked Questions\
Is it legal to have multiple business accounts with different banks in Bahrain?\
Yes. Bahrain’s CBB and MOICT expressly allow it. Just ensure each account aligns with your Sijilat profile and updated UBO filings. (Company Formation in Bahrain)\
\
What are the required documents for opening business bank accounts in Bahrain?\
\
Sijilat CR certificate\
MOA/AOA (if applicable)\
UBO report (2025 format)\
Shareholder/director IDs\
Bahrain office lease\
Board resolution (if opening more than one account)\
\
Check our Bahrain company formation process guide for a document checklist.\
\
How much does it cost to open multiple business accounts in Bahrain?\
Typical setup fees: BHD 40–100 per account. Minimum deposits range BHD 500–3,000. Some banks waive fees for startups or Tamkeen-supported entities. See our Bahrain company formation cost breakdown.\
\
Do foreign owners face extra hurdles for business accounts?\
Not usually, but all foreign founders must show a certified Bahrain address and updated UBO details per 2025 CBB policy. See full ownership rules.\
\
Can different business structures open multiple bank accounts?\
Yes! Whether your entity is a WLL, BSC, branch, or single-person Sijilat, you’re allowed multiple accounts—document requirements just differ. Learn which structure fits best.\
Final Thoughts\
Managing multiple business accounts in Bahrain is smart, fully legal, and increasingly streamlined thanks to strong digital reforms. Prepare thoroughly, respect the local business culture, and always double-check documents. Want the smoothest start? Work with experienced advisors, build relationships with bankers, and keep Sijilat current.\
For more details, explore authoritative news, official government resources, market analysis, and business insights. And if you’re opening your next account, order a double qahwa—you’ll thank me later.\

1mvmgcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiasocial/comments/1mvmgcc/privileged_rantthe_side_of_remote_work_nobody/,(Privileged Rant)The side of remote work nobody talks about - from a small town in Uttarakhand,"Everyone's always going on about how remote work is living the dream - no commute, mountain views, saving tons of money, blah blah. Well let me tell you the actual reality from someone who's been doing this for years from a small town in Uttarakhand.

The loneliness hits way different when you're remote in a small town. I literally wake up, open laptop, close laptop, sleep. That's my social interaction for the day. Meeting new people? Yeah right. Having any sort of social life? What even is that anymore?

Was in San Francisco for two months this year and damn, the difference was insane. People to grab drinks with after work, random coffee runs, spontaneous plans. I went to random places, events, festivals, now I'm back here looking at mountains wondering if the view's really worth being this isolated. Sometimes I think maybe I should just move to Bangalore, get a regular office job. Not that I'm serious about it, but whenever I'm in Bangalore or Delhi there's actual LIFE happening. Friends to meet, things to do, places to go!

The palayan(migration) situation in Uttarakhand makes everything worse. Literally everyone I grew up with has left for the big cities - Delhi, Pune. This town feels like a ghost town. My friends are all out there living their lives and I'm here just... typing code alone.

I've been traveling to keep myself from going completely nuts, but honestly? Still feels like I'm trapped. These past 5 years feel like they didn't even happen. Remote work has me stuck in some weird time warp where I'm getting older but nothing's actually changing. It's all just one long blur of video calls and git commits.

And this is gonna sound ungrateful as hell but the money doesn't even do anything for me anymore. Remember getting that first paycheck in final year? That rush? That excitement? Gone. Now it's just numbers that show up monthly. No one to celebrate with, nowhere worth spending it, nothing to look forward to. Just... numbers on a screen.

The only thing that actually gets me excited these days is taking my family places. Watching them experience new things, seeing them happy that gives me something. But even that feels like I'm living through other people. Like I'm still waiting to break out and actually start living my own life. Thinking about doing a solo trip this year just to see if I can shake this feeling.

I know this sounds like such a first world problem. I have a good job, work from anywhere, saving money while others are struggling. But honestly sometimes I wonder if I'm saving money or just... not living?

Anyone else feel this way about remote work? Or am I just spiralling here?

My sister (27F) was just a baby at the time, so she doesn't remember him at all. We never had any contact with him after that. My mom never really talked about it with us. As I got older, I asked her more about what happened, and she told me their marriage was unhappy. She never loved him, and they only got married because she was pregnant with me. She also hinted that she may not have been completely faithful to him, but I stopped pressing her on that because I didn't want to embarrass her.

At some point, my sister looked him up online and found out that he remarried and had another daughter. She wrote him a letter, but he never responded. I told her to just let it go.

Last week, I got the news that he had died. His wife, Tara, contacted me and we met for coffee to talk. I was a bit confused that she called me and not my sister, but I didn't think much of it. When we met, she was nicer than I expected. She told me that my dad felt regret about never reconnecting with me while he was alive.

She said the funeral was in two weeks and that I should be there, especially since I was mentioned in his will. Apparently, he left me a substantial portion of his assets. My dad wasn't super wealthy, but he worked in finance and had more money than I expected.

At that point, I asked about my sister, and Tara got uncomfortable. She suggested I speak to my mom first and then get back to her. After a long conversation with my mom, she finally admitted that my sister was ""probably"" not my dad's biological daughter.

I wasn't expecting that. I spoke to Tara again, and she said she didn't hold any ill will towards my sister, but my dad didn’t want anything to do with her. Tara also claimed that my dad tried to reconnect with me (but not my sister) a few years after he left, but my mom prevented it. I’m not sure if that’s true, as my mom denies it.

My sister is in denial about all of this. She still considers him her father and wants to go to the funeral. She says she doesn’t care about the money, but I still plan to share whatever I receive with her. I spoke to Tara again, and she insisted that my sister cannot come to the funeral.

1mvmc5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1mvmc5j/could_neuriva_plus_brain_supplement_review/,Could NEURIVA Plus Brain Supplement review enhance memory and focus effectively for better brain health?,"Testing the NEURIVA Plus Brain Supplement for Memory and Focus, B07PBZRDJN, over several weeks was an intriguing experience. This brain health formula, boasting a combination of clinically tested Neurofactor, B vitamins, and phosphatidylserine, felt crafted for those seeking to boost cognitive function, memory, and focus. **I dove into this product with both curiosity and skepticism, wondering if it could deliver on its ambitious claims.** 

**Ingredients and Design**  
The first thing that caught my attention was the simplicity of its capsule design and the clean ingredients list. The capsules are vegetarian, gluten-free, decaffeinated, and GMO-free—great for anyone with dietary restrictions. It features Neurofactor, a unique coffee cherry extract reported to increase BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) levels—a protein vital for brain cell survival and synaptic connections. Pairing this ingredient with phosphatidylserine (known for memory enhancement) and B vitamins, the supplement promised comprehensive brain health support. I liked the idea of fueling my brain with trusted, science-backed nutrients rather than unproven fads.  

**Ease of Use**  
Taking just one capsule daily at bedtime was a breeze. No messy powders to mix or elaborate routines to keep up with. It seemed like the easiest way to stick to a brain health regimen without disrupting my schedule. After a particularly chaotic day at work, this simplicity felt like a win.

[Check NEURIVA Plus Brain Supplement B07PBZRDJN price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b07pbzrdjn/)  

**Highlights**  
The most noticeable change was my improved focus during the second week. I felt sharper while juggling multiple tasks at work, and remembering tiny details—like where I left my wallet (finally!)—seemed less of a struggle. Unexpectedly, I found myself less fatigued as the day wore on, likely thanks to the B6 and B12 vitamins, which are known to support cognitive energy production.  
Some positive aspects include:  
- Features Neurofactor to promote BDNF production, fostering long-term brain cell health.  
- The inclusion of B vitamins helps reduce brain fog and supports neurotransmitter activity.  
- User-friendly—one small capsule fits easily into even the busiest routine.   

**Potential Downsides**  
I wouldn’t be doing this review justice without pointing out a few limitations. While **I appreciate the minimalistic capsule regimen**, it’s worth noting that the product only contains a 30-day supply per bottle, which might be limiting for some. Also, improvements in memory and focus felt gradual, not instant, so patience was required—a lesson that might not sit well with everyone looking for quick fixes. Lastly, the Neurofactor formula is derived from coffee fruit extract, so if you're sensitive to this ingredient, it might not be suitable.  
Some negatives include:  
- Visible effects might take weeks rather than days to manifest.  
- Limited supply in a single bottle; recurring purchases necessary.  

**Peer Products in Comparison**  
Stacking this supplement against brain-support competitors like Alpha Brain or Focus Factor, one thing becomes apparent: Neuriva Plus stands out for its clean ingredients and minimal daily dosage. While Alpha Brain emphasizes quick cognitive boosts, Neuriva leans on clinically tested ingredients for more gradual, sustainable brain health improvements. Compared to Focus Factor, which also targets focus and memory, Neuriva is a simpler formulation without the overwhelming 30+ ingredients, offering a narrow yet effective scope. On the downside, some of its rivals include extra omega-3s or herbal blends, which aren’t present here.

**Money's Worth**  
In terms of financial value, this product is on par with other top-tier offerings in the nootropic market. While it may not be downright budget-friendly, it strikes a balance between quality and affordability. Given that it’s vegetarian, gluten-free, and utilizes researched ingredients like phosphatidylserine and Neurofactor, it's evident where the investment goes. However, whether it works well enough for you to justify its price could depend on personal goals and expectations for brain health support.

For me as well, but this indecision is a decision nonetheless, keeping me on standby is something I no longer wish to do, your stage is yours and I'm no longer form part of this play. You can introduce new characters and that's fine but I no longer wish to be your background character. 

And, if we ever talk in the future I don't think I can be friends with you. Not because I'm bitter or I feel ill toward you - but because what I had with you was beautiful, it's not something I can easily forget nor pretend it didn't happen or it didn't affect me, it moved me, it changed me forever. It would hurt me more to have you in my orbit and diminish what we had to a friendship while we had the world before, and I don't think this doesn't mean I'm immature because I can't move on from the feeling, nor it means I loved more. But because I know myself and I know how it would affect me in the future, and I'm happy if you can live without this feeling but I can't say that in my case. You can turn a cathedral to a mere coffee shop but the reminder of what was before will always be present. I treasure what we had and will always do but I'm not sure I can be your friend, humans are like that you know, we don't have switches that turn off our emotions permanently, those emotions might resurface once again, you never know - and it's especially problematic if we are trying to form something new with someone. 

This was one of the reasons for our first troubles. You loved someone before, it didn't work out but he was still active in your life while we were forming one; it's unfair to your partner,, when your emotions might still be torn or not fully committed, from my perspective at least, because I know what I saw. So I wish you well, this is not closing a door but leaving flowers and honoring this grave we buried

As someone in a buzzing home-office environment, I need something that can cut through the chaos and provide crystal-clear communication for meetings, calls, and focus-intensive tasks. Equipped with all the marketing buzzwords—noise-cancelling, ultra-lightweight, and USB-C connectivity—it seemed, at first glance, to tick every box. But as with any product, reality isn’t always exactly as advertised.

**Design and Comfort**  
This headset manages to strike a balance between practical and sleek, though I’ll admit, its all-black color scheme initially didn’t scream “WOW” aesthetically. The build is ideal for long workdays; the ear cushions are angled, and that maze-patterned design actually works to minimize pressure on my ears. Calling it lightweight would be an understatement—it almost feels like wearing air (okay, not literally, but you get the idea). After countless sessions of Teams meetings and some marathon Spotify sessions in between, I noticed no discomfort, though my partner remarked it looked overly ""office"" to wear casually. What really appealed to me was the thoughtfulness behind its ergonomic design for extended periods.

**Features and Functionality**  
Now, here’s where things get interesting. The Jabra Engage 40 has this inline control unit that allows you to mute, adjust volume, and even switch between platforms during your calls. Testing these features during a client call was seamless; no fumbling for shortcut keys or lagged software responses. The integration with Microsoft Teams felt particularly fluid, making it a joy to use for professional correspondence. And let's not forget the two-microphone setup. I’ve had clients comment, “Are you using some special mic?” because the noise-cancelling tech blocked out my neighbor’s dog and the occasional coffee grinder.  

**Perks**  
- The thoughtful angled design of the ear cushions makes them genuinely wearable for hours.  
- Inline call control makes multitasking and managing audio smooth and intuitive.  
- Integrated 2-mic noise cancellation blocks out background chaos perfectly in most environments.  
- Certified for major platforms, particularly Microsoft Teams, ensuring broad compatibility.

**Audio Quality and Performance**  
As someone who expects a lot from “professional-grade” sound devices, this headset didn’t disappoint...but it also didn’t blow my mind. The BalancedVoice technology is impressive for what it does—fine-tuning sound clarity to deliver sharp incoming audio. Music playback, while serviceable, isn’t the product’s strong suit; the frequencies seem to prioritize calls over melody-rich activities. That might be music snobbery on my part, but if crystal-clear calls outweigh immersive playlists, this headset is a win. It’s worth trying the Engage+ software, which adds an extra layer of customization with real-time call analytics (yes, I nerded out over its noise-level insights).

**Areas of Concern**  
- Bass and mid-tone playback for music can feel flat compared to dedicated audio headsets.  
- My biggest gripe? A wired design. The connectivity works flawlessly, but being tethered to my desk after using wireless headsets before felt limiting.  
- No real aesthetic charm. While professional, it borders on plain.  

**Other Options**  
Looking at competitors, it’s clear this headset’s strongest rivals come from Logitech and Sennheiser. Logitech makes slightly bulkier models that occasionally underperform in call clarity, at least from previous experiences. Sennheiser, meanwhile, often leans toward superior sound quality but lacks the lightweight and multi-platform edge of this product. For anyone heavily invested in Teams or seeking clarity on phone calls above all else, the primary selling point here is practicality and ease of use. Other headphones might nail the media-use niche better, but they’d fall short in dedicated office settings.

**Price Performance**  
Pricing is always relative in this category. While not dirt-cheap, this stereo headset packs plenty into a reasonable budget spot. It may not offer features such as wireless connection or active noise cancellation that others in higher price brackets flaunt, but what it does do, it does exceptionally well. Its blend of comfort and functionality means it delivers where it counts most for professionals. Looking to wring the most mileage out of every dollar? This headset easily qualifies as financially justifiable for dedicated work users who prioritize audio clarity without gilded excess.

There were times that I simply didn’t eat  for months after getting some kind of sickness every year in summer but I got better when the school started every year and didn’t think much.

I ate whatever I wanted and didn’t gain weight thanks to having a school schedule that took a lot of energy from me. Like I used to eat two eggs, one tomato, cheese, (a lot of) bread for breakfast, two cream cheese sandwiches and a big salad for lunch, and also a big dinner every single day when I was studying for my university entrance exam and was spending 11 hours in cram school, waking up at 6 am every day and sleeping at 9 pm. I have never been someone who eats too much of unhealthy food but I didn’t mind to eat a chocolate a day among with all these food neither.

First year of university was fine too. Normal amount of food but a bit healthier since I was mostly at home (i had 3 days of school in second semester and 4 half days of school in first semester). 

But this summer, I’m completely obsessed how I look. Both for acne that I’m finally getting rid of and my weight and physique. I’m around 51 kgs at 167cm but when I look at the mirror, I feel like I should lose weight. And like around 6 months ago, one day I just decided that I wanted to look better. I completely cut off junk food first which I didn’t eat much. No chips, no soda, no chocolate and etc. Then when I finished my first year in university and when the summer break came, I started to change. I stopped eating white bread (which is a BIG cultural food in my country and we eat it every single day), desserts, sugary snacks and drinks and cut my portions off to lose weight and be healthy (which is kinda working since I was around 54-55 and now 50-51 kgs) 

I thought I was just doing this to be healthy but then I started to get hungry, especially in evenings after dinner. I eat two meals a day, a breakfast around 12-1 and a dinner around 6-7 pm. But I still feel like I eat a lot and I am jealous of girls who just don’t get hungry, or eat whatever they want without worrying about calories. The last time I ate a meal from outside was like 6 months ago when I finished my midterms and wanted to reward myself. Unlike my friends who go outside twice a week and eat any fast food they like without any worry. I was like this before too and I dont know why I became like this. I even started to drink coffee so I don’t feel hungry even though I hate the taste of coffee. 

It is just not about weight neither. I even stopped drinking milk (which i really like) because I found out it causes acne. I do have a strict skincare routine that I made sure every skin care product would help me. I dont even get close to window if I didn’t put sun screen on. 

I don’t think anything triggered me, everything just started with wanting to be healthier and starting to search what is good for me or not. I don’t know why now Im suddenly hesitating to eat my older sister’s birthday cake. Do I have ed? What should I do about it? Any advices? ",1,1755712896.0,EDAnonymous,1,1.0,False

* Location: School with \~100 students (plus some staff).
* Machines: They’re flexible. Could be traditional snack + drink, or a single “AI vending” smart cooler.
* Requests: A bit all over the place. Cold coffee, energy drinks, healthy snacks, ramen/cup noodles, and even fresh food like sandwiches, salads, and boiled eggs. 
* Hours: 9am–8pm, 5 days a week. And then summer off because it's a school.

**My Concerns:**

* Student body is quite small (100) → unsure if traffic justifies financing cost of a machine.
* Fresh food = spoilage risk + more frequent stocking. If I did put a proposal forward think it would not include eggs or other perishables like that
* Summer + holiday downtime could kill volume.

**My Questions:**

* What sort of monthly revenue would be a conservative target? Thinking $3/sale \* 5-10 sales a day \* 175 school days per year = $2.6K-5.2K per year. Feels quite slim but maybe I am being too conservative?
* Is a smart cooler a smart move here, or would you start simpler (snack + drink only)?
* Anyone have experience with schools and how to stock them best? I imagine what the administrators want vs what students actually want to be quite different lol
* Any tips for protecting against summer seasonality in schools? Just turn the machine off and don't stock?",2,1755712808.0,vending,0,1.0,False

1mvm68p,https://www.reddit.com/r/catfood/comments/1mvm68p/end_of_my_rope_with_a_wet_foodaverse_cat_how_to/,End of My Rope with a Wet Food-Averse Cat. How to Get Moisture into His Diet?,"TL;DR cat won't or will barely eat his wet food, no matter the brand, flavor, texture, or consistency. Eats dry kibble (Hills urinary c/d) and wet or dry treats with gusto. I want to add whole-meal wet food to his diet to help with moisture. He has already had one ER visit related to urinary problems. I'm at the end of my rope and close to giving up on the whole food transition and just letting him eat his dry Hills c/d and hoping for the best. Looking for any advice, thoughts, or opinions before I completely give up.

Background on cat: \~4.5yo 11lb neutered male. Former stray up until \~3.5yrs ago. Formerly an outdoor/indoor cat up until this last year when we transitioned him to being fully indoor due to health concerns and the cost of caring for an outdoor cat who got into trouble somewhat often. Currently prescribed ""Hill's Prescription Diet c/d Multicare Urinary Care with Chicken Dry Cat Food"" which he loves.

Issue: We can't get him to eat any wet food in any appreciable amount or consistency. He is a cat who licks his wet food instead of bites. I'd place a pate, gravy with chunks, or shreds, and he'd lick only the liquid parts. I worry he isn't getting the full nutritional value of his meal. He LOVES Temptations squeeze treats, so I know he likes mousse-like consistency. I thus resorted to using an old mini coffee bean grinder to blend up his whole-meal wet food into a mousse texture. He can now lick the food and get the full nutritional value.

...Except now we are back to struggling with getting him to actually consume the food. He won't eat even an entire 3oz can per day. We have tried all kinds of flavors and we are pretty sure he prefers two flavors: chicken and salmon. So not only have we narrowed down the flavor profile, but we know he likes mousse consistency. Yet, it is a constant struggle to get him to eat wet food. I don't think the issue has anything to do with illness or dental issues because he happily gobbles up hard kibble and just had a dental cleaning last month.

I've tried getting him on a schedule: morning wet food between 8-10am; Temptations lickable treat around 1pm; evening wet food around 5pm; kibble down by 8pm for the night. What's happening now is he doesn't eat his morning wet food, eats his lickable treat in the afternoon, doesn't eat his evening wet food, and then eats kibble during the night. Begs for treats multiple times throughout the day as well.

We have tried many different wet brands during this journey. We've tried Nulo mousse, Tiki Cat mousse, Weruva Gravy, Purina pate, Hills pate, they're a hit for a single feeding and then he's over it. We seemed to have the best luck with Fancy Feast medley, so we invested in buying several cans of it, and of course now he's decided he doesn't want that anymore either. Soaking his Hills c/d kibble in water causes him to reject it.

I'm at a loss. Money doesn't grow on trees. I want to do the right thing for my cat but he's making it very difficult and frustrating for me. I'm considering cutting treats or kibble out completely, but I'm not even sure if that's the issue. Is he ""waiting"" for his treats or his kibble at night? I also worry that he will simply stop eating if I cut out treats and kibble. As part of his dental cleaning last month, he had 1 minor tooth extraction and had to eat wet food for 10 days (what started all this). He went on a full-on food strike during this time, which really scared me, and I don't want to go through that again.

I'm pretty close to just giving up. At least he's on the Hills urinary dry food, I guess. Maybe we don't even need to worry about his moisture if he's on that prescribed food. My last cat died at \~20yrs from kidney issues so it's important to me that my current cat gets enough moisture throughout his life. Thank you for reading.",1,1755712662.0,catfood,2,1.0,False

1mvm5gy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mvm5gy/should_you_buy_the_laoion_portable_espresso_maker/,Should You Buy the LAOION Portable Espresso Maker 2024 Review for Coffee Lovers?,"The LAOION Espresso Maker has become an unexpectedly indispensable part of my morning routine. This sleek and compact electric espresso machine is marketed for coffee enthusiasts, and I took it on a daily test run for a couple of weeks to see if it could truly deliver the rich, aromatic brew it promises. As a self-proclaimed coffee nerd with a kitchen stocked full of gadgets, I was skeptical—but intrigued. Let me take you through my experience with this portable coffee maker, including its highlights and limitations.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed is how lightweight and compact this espresso maker feels. Weighing just 2.56 pounds with dimensions of 5.12""x7.48""x10.63"", it's shockingly portable for someone who’s used to bulky countertop appliances. The modern design—with a transparent container for monitoring the brewing process—appeals visually, but it also serves a practical purpose. Watching the coffee percolate in real-time is oddly satisfying. The black metallic finish gives it a contemporary look that matched my kitchen aesthetic beautifully. Built primarily from BPA-free plastic and food-grade aluminum, the materials feel safe, though the plastic top lid had me worried about long-term durability.

**Ease of Use and Operation**  
Operating this little machine is refreshingly straightforward—perfect on groggy mornings. There are no confusing buttons or overly complex startup steps involved. Just fill the aluminum boiler with water, pack the funnel filter with medium-ground coffee, screw it together, and press the button on its detachable electric base. You’ll have six small espresso cups ready in about five minutes, or adjust it to three cups if you’re feeling modest. It’s semi-automatic, meaning you still get the satisfaction of participating in the espresso-making process without the inconvenience of manual brewing.  

[Discover if LAOION Espresso Maker is on sale at Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0bp6ntd1p/)

**Advantages**  
Here are a few standout features of the coffee machine that won me over:  
- The transparent container adds a nice touch, letting you monitor your coffee as it brews.  
- It comes with a detachable base, which is convenient for carrying the pot to another room or table.  
- Two auto-shutoff features prevent overheating—one shuts off when the pot leaves the base, and the other stops brewing at the boiling point.  
- Safe and food-grade materials inspire confidence for daily use.  
- Ideal for brewing classic Italian Moka coffee right at home or even during travels.  

**Performance and Brewing Results**  
Performance-wise, the coffee it delivers is surprisingly good—especially for a portable espresso maker. I’ve tested it with different brands of coffee, and every cup has been consistently rich and aromatic. The six-cup capacity does translate to smaller servings, so one ""cup"" is really more of a shot of espresso, but that suited me just fine. If you’re the sort of person who can't settle for less than a full mug of coffee, you might need multiple rounds. Speed is a definite highlight, with a full brew taking around five minutes.

**Caveats**  
No product is flawless, and there are some issues worth pointing out:  
- The plastic lid doesn’t feel as durable as the rest of the machine and could potentially crack if handled carelessly.  
- Cleaning the aluminum boiler can be a little tedious because of its design.  
- While great for small households or individuals, it might not suffice for larger families or entertaining guests.  
- The manual warns against putting it in the dishwasher, which makes cleanup slightly less convenient for busy days.  

**Product Rivals**  
When compared to popular competitors like the Bialetti Moka Express and the De’Longhi Dedica Espresso Maker, LAOION’s espresso maker distinguishes itself in portability. Unlike traditional stovetop espresso pots, this one doesn’t need an open flame or extra equipment, which is a huge plus for travelers and campers. Against electric machines like the Dedica, it’s much more compact and considerably more budget-friendly, even though it lacks similar advanced customization options. However, the lack of milk frothing capabilities might be a deal breaker for latte or cappuccino lovers who want a built-in all-in-one experience.

**Worth Every Penny**  
While I won’t mention exact pricing here, I can say that for the features included—like auto shut-off protection, detachable base, and high portability—this espresso maker is an impressive value. It fits perfectly within the realm of smart spending, especially for casual coffee drinkers who don’t have the space or budget for pricier alternatives. If you’re someone who enjoys strong, flavorful coffee without needing barista-level precision, this product is worth considering.

Last Thursday, the lady and I, along with her cousin and her man, drove up to Bangor to attend the Stephen King tour of Derry, and it was so awesome!  Jamie, the tour guide, drove us around Bangor for 2 hours and gave us all sorts of interesting information about Mr. King and how he drew inspiration from Bangor, and Maine in general, to create the stories we all love.  

The tour headquarters was so cool, I wish I took more pictures.  They had screen used seats from The Langoliers, the gypsy's car from Thinner and a ton of other props from the motion picture adaptations.  King references everywhere!  They had a nice gift shop as well, lots of neat knickknacks.  I picked up 11/22/63, a pin, and my lady bought a coffee mug.  I found the Castle Rock Kitchen cookbook in Portland.  Jamie even handed out some neat freebies throughout the tour!

Jamie is super funny, down to earth and really knows his stuff!  It was an awesome experience and I definitely recommend the tour!  Make sure you try a Moxie, it's actually really good!",5,1755712532.0,stephenking,0,1.0,False

We can talk over the phone or chat, or catch up with a cup of coffee. We can both yap about how our day went. I'm looking for someone permanent and not temporary, and when the time is right, a lifelong commitment. So to save both of our time chatting, and ended up ghosting each other, here's my deets:

About me

* single, not married, not separated, no kids
* FROM CEBU
* stands at 5'2 tall and medyo dadbod (around 65-70kgs)
* face value? you be the judge, but FYI, to save you time, i have pimple marks all over my face
* started my running era 2 months ago and I love it, also do a bit of some home workouts and calorie deficit, plays sports like basketball, badminton but not that active, also plays CODM and ML
* working professional in the BPO industry, schedule rotates every 2 months with rest days that usually falls Fri-Sat, Sat-Sun, or Sun-Mon. So now until whole months of September, I'm a nocturnal person.
* medyo kanal humor, but I can adjust
* living alone
* furdad (dog)
* introverted, don't like noisy, crowded places, except for live gigs with local bands or concerts. I'm in a band, and a frustrated lead singer (pang videoke voice lang toh, so stop requesting VM from me)
* Movies? I love anime, horror, true crime docu, sci-fi, thriller genres. Music? My Chemical Romance, Linkin Park, Greenday, Epica, Skillet, The Used.
* I want to travel, but not my priority. Only place I travelled outside PH was Thailand, 3 times before the pandemic.
* gumagala lang pag kasama yung pinaka closest friends ko. Other than that, you can find me at home bedrotting.

* same height or shorter than me
* same age or younger than me

* someone in between chubby and normal BMI maybe? idk
* understands how my schedule works

In the end, I just need someone who's also afraid to lose me as much as I'm afraid to lose them. Someone who's a ride or die. I'm not in a rush, though, so let's take our time, chat, exchange pics and see if we vibe. If this is you, then please don't hesitate to dm me. Thanks!",1,1755712528.0,cebur4r_dating,0,1.0,False

1mvlz7j,https://i.redd.it/3z7x0uswp7kf1.jpeg,The review everyone begged & pleaded for.. (lol),"I’ll start off by saying I exchanged my super milk and strawberry feels body sprays, also comforter and a few things. Strawberry feels I really ended up hating.. smelled like musty socks to me. Supermilk smelled like sour milk with lemon and was super overwhelming too. I’m very sad about the comforter shower gel but it didn’t smell like ANYTHING to me!!

Anyways I decided to exchange these and head to my store to test out the new nut butters. Whelp… imo? They didn’t smell like nuts! I guess my store is one of the lucky ones. Each pot I got, was made by a different person too! I LOVE the textures of these butters, the consistency, and how it rests on the skin. How hydrating it feels to your skin, it really is a big difference than an average lotion, if anyone was curious to compare. It really is a difference. 

HIWTK- I honestly didn’t expect to even glance at this one but decided to give it a go with all the positive reviews and I will say, it smells amazing and JUST like HIWTK! No nuts involved. That sweet soft smell translates perfectly. 

Supermilk- I honestly might exchange this one, I did like it in stores but it’s actually quite … powerful and overwhelming ? Not that I mind potent smells but there’s something with supermilk that can be jarring with the body spray and this butter. It smells exactly like a Krispy Kreme glazed donut to me. Which is very nice but it smells SO SO sweet it’s like too sweet? And doesn’t give SM at all IMO

Posh chocolate- perfection. Smells very similar to the body lotion IMO — like a powdered chocolate milk! This was the first I tried out the lot and seemed the safest to try. It definitely is! I could see how a HINT of nut could be found in the butter, but to me reads more milky and powdery than nutty. 

Creamy candy- my FAVORITE out the bunch!!! I think I’ll get a big tub. I’m shook how much I love this. I’m lmao at our lushie Redditors quote on it. It smells like sweet vanilla — but like… pink? What I would think creamy candy smells like.. this smells like it.  Sweet but almost has a little tart kick to it. I can’t explain this scent profile well, and the ingredient lists doesn’t help. It’s unique and complex. 

I tried but didn’t get:

Sex bomb- I really wanted to love this one cus one of my lushie besties is obsessed with this scent. Sadly. It smelled like nothing 🤧 maybe with long wear that would be different? But I tried so many things it drowned it out if anything over time anyways. 

Pineapple tart- smells like mac and cheese noodles. Even the SA helping me said so. We were energetically aligned 

Overall, I came in ready to be a hater but I wasn’t. I was a fan lol. I recommend giving them a shot and not being too discouraged about last months fiasco. 

as for the rest of my purchases - banana shampoo my bf and I are a little over halfway done with our pots so I got one to split between us. Candy rain I love and ran out and needed a bigger pot, same with tofu. Cup o coffee I haven’t tried in a long time but own no face masks so I figured why not. Repeat I ran out of ages ago and finally remembered to purchase. And then my sweet sweet Alina.. I had to get her in liquid form after being gifted the solid.  I also got LOM bath bomb and forgot to add it to my photo

About us. About how fleeting it all was and yet how much space the memories still take up in my heart.

I still remember our first date at Wildflour. You met me at the reception, walked me to our table, and insisted on paying for that expensive meal. You were so gentlemanly, and it made me feel seen in a way I didn’t expect. Then there was Rolling Panda, where we stuffed ourselves at the buffet and laughed about it, and that night at your condo when we had sushi and talked like we’d known each other for years. Even the next morning felt special...  you driving me home and picking up McDonald’s coffee on the way.

I think about the random day you bought me that expensive snack just coz it was your favorite and you wanted me to try it. I thought it was very sweet and thoughtful. And our last date at Waltermart - grabbing coffee at Zus, having pasta at Nords - it wasn’t grand or planned, but it felt nice and easy.

I also remember when you went to Batanes for work and sent me pictures. It took me a long time to reply because I wasn’t happy with the lack of updates. But you still tried anyway, even when I was slow to respond. Looking back now, I wish I had appreciated those little gestures more. You were showing effort in your own way, and maybe I didn’t meet you halfway.

But even with all those memories, I know our paces were different. I needed consistency, intention, and steady communication, things I often had to ask for. You tried, and I saw it, especially when you started remembering little details like my Sunday padel. But deep down, I think we both knew we weren’t fully aligned for the long run.

Not fighting harder for us wasn’t a mistake. It was me choosing to honor what I need. Still, missing you in moments like this doesn’t mean I want us back. It just means what we had mattered, and it always will.

I hope you’re doing well.

1mvltf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_jadegreen88/comments/1mvltf1/the_donut_that_never_left/,The Donut That Never Left,"Jelly-filled. Pink icing and rainbow sprinkles delicately blanketed the top of its exquisite, glistening mass. This delightfully devious little body made of sugar, fried dough, and strawberry-flavored goop tempted me to the point of no return. I pressed the tip of my index finger against the glass and said,

""This one.""

I knew I shouldn't have. But I'd been so good lately. I deserved a treat. And besides, I'd make up for it at the gym later, then pound a fuck-ton of water and flush that bitch right out. Yeah, it's no big deal. It's Friday: cheat day. And this week's been hell. I *needed* this.

""That'll be $1.99, sir.""

The lady at the counter smiled and handed me the bulging bag. I held it close, pressing its warm weight against my chest. My mouth pooled with saliva as I slid her my debit card. 

""Anything else?""

I glanced back toward the glass dome filled with plump pastries, then shook my head. They all looked like whores, slathered in chocolate and cheaply seductive—no substance. Nope, I had everything I needed right here in this greasy white paper bag. *Mine* had fruit. She handed my card back over and said, 

""Have a nice day!""

I grinned, looking down at the bag cradled in my arms. I sure as shit will, I thought. Then, I hurried back to my car to devour this goddess of a donut in seclusion. I needed privacy; this was a moment to be savored. Carefully, I eased my hand into the bag's opening until the tips of my fingers met her soft, pillowy posterior. Once I'd gripped onto the end, I gently pulled to reveal divine perfection. 

The icing lay undisturbed; every single sprinkle had held on. It didn't feel right to just go in at it. No, it was too beautiful to be ravaged like that. It begged to be adored and cherished—worshiped. I couldn't just bite into this donut like some sort of monster. The jelly would spill out all over, and I didn't have any napkins. 
 
I held it up to my face, admiring the flawless sheen of its glaze in the soft morning light. I inhaled deeply, slowly taking in the heavenly scent that filled me with euphoria. Then, I slid my tongue gently across the surface of its sweet, crispy skin. And that's where it all began. This simple little act of mindless self-indulgence would later become the single biggest regret of my life.

Yet, a smile crept across my face as the intense warmth of this magnificent exterior overwhelmed me. I had one thought, and one thought only: I needed to get to what was inside. Slowly, I sank my teeth deep into its sugary flesh, carefully removing the tiniest of morsels and releasing a floodgate of warm, red jelly. I let the intoxicating, chunky viscus pour into my mouth and surrendered to the ecstasy. 

After that, I blacked out.

When I came to, I'd devoured the whole thing. Not a trace of it remained; even my fingers had been licked clean and sucked dry. I searched the bag, hoping there might be a tiny smidge of icing left behind, but nothing. Not even a sprinkle. It was all gone. *Shit,* I don't even get to keep the memory of enjoying it? Why did I scarf it down so quickly? 

The only evidence that I'd even done so was the lump pressing hard at the back of my throat as the last bite of my breakfast made its way down my esophagus and onto the gullet. Guess I need to work on that whole *'self-control'* thing.

As I drove to work in my sugared-up intoxication, the lump began to squirm. Must be a burp trying to come out, I thought; probably swallowed a fuck ton of air during my binge-fit. I slammed my fist against my chest, but it didn't help. Instead, I could feel my throat tightening around the bulge, trying to push it down. No—the opposite. It felt like that hunk of donut was forcing its way down, in spite of my body trying to stop it. What the fuck. 

My eyes watered as I began to cough, choking on the wad of dough that had now firmly planted itself just above my sternum. The bitch wasn't moving at all. I struggled to keep my eyes on the road as I frantically searched the floor of my passenger seat for a half-empty bottle of water. Finally, I laid my hand on one, leaned my head back, and chugged. 

Down she went, without a fight. I smiled and threw the empty bottle back down onto the floor where it belonged. Then, I took a deep breath of relief. *God,* how stupid would it have been if I'd choked to death on a fucking donut? Embarrassing. I wiped my eyes and continued down the road. 

By the time I got to work, the donut had reached my stomach, landing like a boulder dropped off a cliff. I ran to the bathroom, thinking I had to take a shit. I sat in that stall straining for at least 10 minutes, but nothing came out. So, I stood up and pulled my pants back on. Then, I turned around and looked at the toilet. I froze. There, floating in the water, was a single blue sprinkle.

My eyes widened, and I blinked a few times. Then, I leaned forward to make sure I was really seeing what I thought I was. Yep—a sprinkle. Not a poop-sized one. A regular one. My body snapped upright. No fucking way that came out of my butt. It had to have been on my pants. I just didn't notice. Yeah, of course, that's what it was.

I walked from the bathroom laughing at myself for getting freaked out, even momentarily. My stomach was still killing me, though. The damn donut was sloshing around in the water I'd chugged like a ship caught in a storm. With each step I took, I could feel it rocking back and forth. 

*Gurgle, gurgle. Slosh, slosh.*

When I got to my desk, I started searching around in all the drawers for a roll of Tums. I got excited for a second, until I realized it was just the empty wrapper I'd left myself to be fooled by later. Past me is such an asshole. 

*Gurrrrrp!*

""Shut up.""

Fuck. I had to do something, and quickly. My stomach was visibly rippling at that point, and I could barely stay seated. I thought about undoing my belt, but I didn't want to get accused of being a pervert. Especially not after I accidentally elbowed Sharon from accounting in the boob last week. That was her fault for crowding me at the coffee pot, though. Unfortunately, HR didn't see it that way.

Wait—coffee! That'll make me shit, I thought. Even though my stomach was past maximum capacity, it seemed like my only option. Besides, a shot of black coffee to the gut might just actually do the trick to move this mass along. The bitch had already overstayed her welcome. It was time for an eviction notice. 

I hurried to the break room to find Sharon at the coffee pot. *Of course.* I kept my distance as we silently exchanged awkward glances. I didn't want to look her in the eye, so I stared at the coffee pot in her hands instead. I was so uncomfortable. I could barely keep still as my gurgles and groans echoed through the otherwise empty room. She cut her pour short, grabbed a handful of Sweet'N Low packets, then rushed out of the door while covering her nose. *Pftt*—probably thought I was farting. Believe me, lady. I wish I *could* fart.

I poured a splash and a half into my cup and threw it back, still scalding. It burned all the way down, but I didn't care. The pain in my throat was a welcome distraction from the mayhem that was going on in my stomach. The roof of my mouth was going to be fucked for a day or two. But, I figured, if it worked, it would all be worth it. After all, this was my last-ditch effort to be able to make it through the rest of my workday. 

It also turned out to be a big mistake.

The searing black liquid landed with an eruption. I immediately doubled over in the worst pain I'd ever felt in my life. The wad of sugary dough had begun to thrash violently, slamming itself against the walls of my stomach. No, I'm not fucking joking. I could feel it. Not just in my stomach—with my hands, too. I literally felt this donut pounding from the inside out, lifting my skin as it pushed against its gastric prison. 

I ran full speed to the bathroom, praying I'd make it there before I passed out, vomited, or shit my pants. Or, all three. My belly bounced as I ran, suddenly swollen like a puppy with worms. I thought I was bloated before, but now I was literally about to pop. The movement made the pain infinitely worse, but I had no choice. Fuck this. It had to come out.

The stall door slammed against the wall, and I fell to my knees, gripping the toilet in preparation. My face was ice-cold and clammy. Warm saliva flooded my mouth. Yes! Come out! Be gone, bitch! 

*GUUURRRPPP*

I began to heave and spit into the toilet. The mass was so close I could taste it, but nothing was coming out. It was fighting me. I shoved my finger down into my throat, scraping against the burnt roof of my mouth. I winced from the pain, and my eyes started watering uncontrollably. A few gags, and up she came. 

A putrid flurry of pink sludge spewed from my mouth, swirled with a deep, crimson red foam. It splattered back up into my face when it hit the toilet at lightning speed. Fuck, so much came out of me, I can't even explain it. But that was only phase one. Next came the chunks. 

By the time I was done, I thought I was going to lose consciousness. The room was spinning, and I struggled to catch my breath, so I lowered myself onto the floor, still hugging the toilet. 

I couldn't help but inspect this ungodly force that had just come out of me. Slowly, I lifted my head and peeked over the seat. *Holy fuck.* I gazed down at the thick pink vomit in utter shock and disgust. Shit, it looked like I'd barely even chewed this donut. Even the rainbow sprinkles had all remained whole, floating around in the sludge like tiny specks of whimsy in a cotton candy-colored massacre. Surrounding them were a few large globs of fleshy beige, accompanied by several smaller red clumps. *Christ.* I just *had* to get the one with fruit, huh?

Suddenly, my eyes fixed on the largest red chunk floating in the middle of the sludge. It looked different than the other ones. Shaped weird. And it was... *moving?* I wiped my eyes. Yes—it was fucking moving! Convulsing. Constricting. Sputtering red goop from both ends. *No fucking way.*

I stood up so fast, I nearly fell backwards out of the stall. Black spots began to appear in my line of vision. I gripped onto the threshold with both hands as I swayed, trying to regain balance. I held my breath and slowly leaned forward to look again. It stopped.

Oh, thank God. It *wasn't* moving. Get it together, bro. It's just a chunk of strawberry; how could it be moving? I almost wanted to poke at it, but considering how vile the mess I'd made in the toilet was, I resisted that urge.

The hinges of the bathroom door creaked, and footsteps began to approach. I quickly reached over and flushed the rainbow sprinkled slurry. It smelled like death—sickly sweet with a hint of berry. I desperately tried to fan the stink away with one hand while wiping my face with the other.

When I exited the stall, Jerry from sales was at the urinal. He turned to look at me as I approached the sink, visibly disgusted by the pungent odor that had completely filled the room at that point.  

""Gnarly case of food poisoning,"" I told him. 

He nodded, then focused his eyes back in front of him. With a splash of water and a squirt of soap, I quickly washed my hands and ran out of there. On the way back to my desk, I bumped into my boss, who promptly asked what the hell I'd been doing all morning. 

""Sorry, sir. I think I'm coming down with something.""

He folded his arms in front of him and scrunched his eyebrows. 

""That's the excuse you're going with this time?""

""Ask Jerry, he'll tell you. I was just in the bathroom. If you want proof, go in there and take a big whiff."" 

""Alright, that's enough,"" he said. ""Just make sure that report is on my desk before lunch, then you can leave if you need to. And don't forget, you're still on disciplinary probation after last week.""

""Yes, sir.""

Fuck. I forgot all about that damn report. I hadn't even started it yet, and it was almost 10:00. At least my stomach was starting to feel better. My abs were sore from all the heaving, but now that just meant I could skip the gym later. I'd already puked up the donut anyway, so the carbs didn't count. 

Shit, what a weird ass morning I was having—almost got killed by a donut twice. What an evil bitch! She tempted me, then tortured me. Well, lesson learned. Not going back to that bakery again. At least now she was gone, and it was over. 

I sat down at my desk, opened up a Word document, and began typing nonsense. My thoughts were all jumbled up, and my head was throbbing from straining so hard. I kept having to retype each sentence over and over until it made sense. Before I knew it, another hour had gone by, and I was sweating. 

My hand reached up to wipe away the droplets accumulating on the ridge of my brow. Right away, I noticed something weird. My sweat was thick. Like... *goop.* I slowly pulled my hand away in confusion to look at the substance that had just excreted from my pores. 

It was clear, like sweat's supposed to be. But there was a ton of it. And it didn't drip. No—instead, it gathered in a rounded clump at the edge of my fingertips. Then, I pressed my fingers together. It was sticky, too. *Oh, god.* I slowly raised my hand up to my lips and tasted. It was fucking *sugar.*

Okay... something weird is definitely going on. What the fuck was in that donut?! I had to leave work. Immediately. To hell with this damn report. I needed to go home and start googling. And also take a shower, because my face and hands were all sticky. Oh—and I still smelled like vomit, too. 

I got up and left everything on my desk as it was, including the open document of word salad on my computer screen. Hopefully, my boss would see all that and realize this was an emergency. If not, oh well, whatever. I'll just deal with it on Monday, I thought.

I raced home, taking a different route to avoid having to pass that bakery. I felt like just the sight of it might make me sick again. There had to be something wrong with that donut. I felt totally normal until I met that sugary bitch. Maybe it really was food poisoning. *Fuck*—the strawberries! E. coli, duh. *Damn*, should've gotten one of the whores; chocolate would've never betrayed me like that.

Food poisoning didn't exactly explain the sugary sweat, but I was still convinced that's what it was. Maybe I got so sick, I'd started hallucinating? Yeah, that *had* to be it. Ha! That donut wasn't actually thrashing in my stomach. The strawberry chunk wasn't ever moving. And the goopy sweat? Probably just some leftover glaze I didn't realize was there. *Pftt.* I shook my head and chuckled to myself. There was nothing to worry about. It'll pass.

I got home, threw my keys onto the side table, and headed straight for the bathroom. I decided to brush my teeth first. My breath was so rank I couldn't stand it anymore, and the taste of sugar and stomach acid still lingered on my tongue. I brushed the hell out of my entire mouth for at least 2 1/2 minutes, then spit into the sink. When I saw what had come out of my mouth, I almost choked. 

Sprinkles. A bunch of them. God, how did they all get stuck in my teeth like that? How did I not feel them? I cupped my hand under the faucet and rinsed my mouth out a few times. Each time I spit, more came out. It seemed to be an endless supply of them, like there was a God damned sprinkle dispenser somewhere behind my molars. But finally, after the fifth rinse, I ran my tongue across my teeth and didn't feel any more. So, I got into the shower and figured if anything else weird happened, I'd just worry about it then.

Then, something else weird happened.

I turned the hot water on, stepped under the stream, closed my eyes and began running my hands across my skin. My entire body felt tacky and gross. I reached up to find that my hair felt the same way—it had formed into five or six clumps on the top of my head. *Yuck.* Instantly, I pulled my hand away and opened my eyes to grab the shampoo bottle. That's when I noticed it. 

The water that was dripping from my body was milky white. *What the fuck?* I jumped back from the shower head and looked up. The water coming out of it was clear. I scrunched my eyebrows, then slowly looked back down. The thick, milky drippings had started to collect in a pile, clogging up the drain. 

I tried to slide the clump away with my foot, only to have it spread itself in between my toes, like when you step on a glob of peanut butter. It sent a shiver down my spine, and I started flapping my foot around trying to fling the goop off of it, but it wasn't moving. So, I reached down to dislodge whatever it was by hand. Just then, I was hit with an oddly familiar scent. The same one that had filled the air of that bakery. *Sugar.* 

*Jesus H. Christ*—did I try to fuck it?! Just how much icing did I smear on myself? Shit, I must've rubbed that fucking donut all over my body. Hell no, man. I've done some weird shit in my life, but never with food. That thing must've been drugged! 

My hand shot up to my forehead, and my eyes raced back and forth as I desperately tried to remember anything at all from the ten minutes or so I had blacked out. Nothing. Not a damn thing. God, I *had* to have been slipped something. That was the only explanation that made sense.

My heart started pounding and I began to feel woozy. I was obviously under the influence of some type of drug, but I had no idea what. I quickly washed my hair, then grabbed the loofah and started frantically scrubbing my body from the top down. 

When I reached my butt, I used my hand to wash in between my cheeks since the loofah's too rough. I was immediately disgusted to find there were little specks of something buried deep within my ass crack. 

I didn't even need to look—I knew what they were. But still, there I was, gawking down at my hand in complete and utter shock nonetheless. Sprinkles. At least a dozen or more. 

I was ashamed and completely disgusted with myself. I couldn't believe I'd actually scratched my ass while eating that donut! Shit, hopefully I waited until after I was finished. But, either way, that meant my fingers were... and then I... Oh, *God.* 

Whatever—nothing I could do about it now. I rinsed the butt sprinkles from my hand, then continued down to my legs. They were dry. Like, *really* dry. I'm talking sandpaper. Large flakes of my skin started to slough off as I scrubbed, plopping onto the shower floor like tiny, wet crepes. 

I've never been good about moisturizing, and to be honest, I usually don't even wash anything below the knees, but today I had to. They must've just been overdue for a good exfoliating, I thought. 

Once I got out and toweled myself off, I noticed my upper body felt waxy and smooth. Too smooth. It was like a slight, buttery layer of film sitting on top of my skin. My bottom half was the opposite. I thought all those skin flakes coming off would've helped, but my legs still looked extremely dry—almost scaly. I dropped the towel and reached down with my bare hand. When my fingers touched one of the flaked-off portions of my calf, my heart sank. My skin... it felt *crispy.*

Hell no—I am *not* dealing with this right now. I'll just lotion them later if they still feel rough when I sober up. I shook my head, then leaned forward over the sink to look into the mirror. My pupils were enormous, and a fresh coat of glaze covered my face with a lustrous, glossy sheen. 

*Shit... you're tripping balls, man.*

There was nothing I could do but try to wait it out. If I went to the hospital and started explaining my '*symptoms*', I'd be fitted for a brand new pair of grippy socks in a heartbeat. No. There was no need to panic. I just needed to let whatever the hell drug this was wear off. Run its course. Yeah, it's no big deal. It'll be okay.

I thought sleep would be the answer. So, I hurried off to my bedroom and started covering all the windows with dark blankets to block out the midday sun as best I could. I didn't even bother putting clothes back on—I figured I'd end up sweating like a pig during this detox anyway. No need to dirty another pair of underwear. 

By the time I'd finished blacking out the room, I was already starting to feel like I was burning up. It was like an oven had suddenly kicked on inside me. I plopped myself down onto the bed, splayed out like a starfish, and waited. 

First, the nausea returned. I had to close my eyes to stop the ceiling from spinning. Then, the heat within me intensified. This fierce burning sensation started to tear through my body, radiating deep from my core. *Oh, God.* It was almost unbearable. I clenched onto the bedsheet underneath me with both fists and tried desperately to control my breathing. A buzzing sensation began to spread through my body, like every cell inside me vibrating all at once. My eyes rolled into the back of my head, and the room went black. 

When I woke up, the slivers of sunlight that had been peering out from the sides of the blankets were gone. My eyes darted over to the little red numbers piercing through the darkness of my room. It was 5:00 AM. *Jesus Christ*, I'd slept the entire rest of the day and all through the night. 

I remained still for a moment, trying to assess my mental and physical state, praying everything had gone back to normal. The nausea had passed, but my body was still burning up. My mouth was unbelievably dry, and the air in my room felt stagnant and heavy. It seemed to push down from above like a weighted blanket—smothering me. I forced in a deep breath, and when I did, I noticed the smell. That fucking *smell.*

However, it wasn't until I attempted to reach up and wipe my face that I began to truly realize the horror I'd woken up to. My arm. It wouldn't move—it was stuck to the bed. The other one, too. And... and my legs. *What the fuck??* My head shot up in a panic, and the pillow came with it.

When I looked down at my body, my jaw dropped open. I was huge. I'm talking gigantic. Bloated, puffy, and round beyond belief. I'd gone from a size 34 pants to at least a 52. Not even joking. It was like I'd gained a hundred pounds overnight. I couldn't believe it. This couldn't be happening. I'd slept almost 20 hours—the drug should've worn off!

As I glared down in shock, I could see that my now rotund upper body was caked in a thick, opaque layer of pasty goop. It had dripped and clung to the bed, sticking to the skin of my back and arms like a human glue trap. 

From the waist down, I was surrounded by a large, dark red stain on the sheets. Is that—? *No. Can't be.* I blinked a few times, then squinted as my eyes strained to adjust. The mystery red liquid had dried to a crust at the edges, forming a giant congealed mass beneath me. 

I struggled to lift myself up further, forcing my neck forward as hard as I could. Then, I gave myself one good push. As my body squished against itself, more of the thick red goo suddenly appeared... oozing… from my fucking belly button.

The secretion slowly slid from the side of my stomach into the pile below, landing with a wet *plap.* Instinct took over, and I started to thrash and writhe against the bed, desperate to free myself from this disgusting, sticky goop from hell. 

Peeling my top half from the sheets felt like ripping off a massive band-aid. Thick white strings clung to me as the gummy substance stretched and pulled at my skin, trying to force me back down. I bit down hard on my bottom lip and just went for it. I'll admit it—I screamed. Screamed like a bitch. 

Once my arms were free, I moved on to my legs. The red stuff was worse. Much thicker, less give. It was agonizing. Huge, crispy strips of flesh tore from my legs, remaining glued to the clotted red mess that had leaked from my unrecognizably grotesque body. After I'd completely broken free from my adhesive prison, I hobbled to the bathroom, dripping the entire way. 

I stared at myself in the mirror, my gargantuan, sugar-slathered body shaking uncontrollably. *Fuck*. I shouldn't have just gone to sleep. I should have dealt with this when I had the chance. That donut wasn't drugged, it was cursed. Something in it. A demon—possessing me. Changing me. It had hollowed me out and was growing inside me.

I collapsed onto the cold floor and buried my face in my hands as I began to cry. Not tears, of course. Instead of droplets of wetness, I felt little taps of grit. I ripped my hands away from my eyes. 

Sprinkles. Rainbow fucking sprinkles. 

An animalistic shriek erupted from my lungs, and I hurled them across the room. They hit the wall with a *ping*, scattering all over the floor like confetti at my funeral. Mocking me. 

I pulled myself back up to my feet, limped over to the shower, and got in. I scrubbed, wincing in pain as the loofah scraped against my raw skin. To distract myself, I started trying to weigh my options. I couldn't ignore this anymore. I knew I needed help, desperately. I just didn't know who to turn to. Shit, doctors wouldn't know what to do with me at this point—whatever was happening to me had very quickly devolved into something modern medicine couldn't do shit about. 

I thought about calling my cousin, Sonia, in Maine. Her husband had gone through some weird body shit recently. Maybe she'd know what to do. She'd been vague about the details of what happened to him when she told me about it a few months ago. Something about fish? What I did remember was she had been very clear about one thing: it didn't end well. 

Scratch that. If she couldn't help him, she definitely couldn't help me either. I gripped the loofah tighter, my body trembling from the pain and fear. I had to do something. I couldn't allow myself to crumble under the weight of my insane circumstance. I refused to let this *thing* take over. 

I shuffled out of the tub, almost slipping on the pink sludge I'd left behind as I lifted my massive, jiggly leg over the side. I carefully dried myself off, soaking up the leftover glaze from my creases. Then, I shakily began trying to bandage up the gaping wounds on my legs.

They were oozing the same shit that had come out of my belly button. I set a piece of gauze down on top of one of the rips in my flesh, and the redness seeped through instantly. It wasn't blood. Deep down, I already knew that. Still, I reached down, scooped up a dollop with my fingers, and sniffed it. *Strawberry.*

Whatever the fuck was happening to me, I was powerless to stop it alone. There was only one thing left I could do. So, I threw a blanket over my half-glazed naked body, since none of my clothes fit anymore, then scuttled out to my car and began tearing down the street—headed toward that fucking bakery.

The door slammed against the wall with a loud bang as I busted through. The stupid little bell dislodged and went sliding across the floor. The place was empty, except for the lady behind the counter. She looked up at me and smiled. 

""Welcome back! Did you enjoy your donut, sir?""

I just stood there in the doorway for a moment, completely dumbfounded, as her smile widened into a sinister, toothy grin. Did I *enjoy* the donut? The sheer audacity of this woman. There I was, shaped like a fucking eclair, covered in only a blanket and dripping red goop everywhere. I sure as shit did not.  A fiery rage began to simmer within me. And then, I exploded.

*""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO THAT DONUT?!?!”*

She laughed. 

""Why, nothing, sir. Nothing at all.""

""Bullshit! What the fuck is happening to me?!"" I demanded. 

""Exactly what was meant to happen,"" she answered. 

""You cursed it! *Christ,* I fucking knew it!! What is this, huh? Some kinda donut voodoo shop?!""

She shook her head and chuckled dismissively.  

""Sir, I just sell the donuts. I don't make them."" 

I stormed up to the counter and threw the sticky blanket down onto the ground, revealing the gruesome form I was now trapped inside of.  

""I don't give a shit who makes them! I want to know why the hell this is happening to my body!!"" 

""Isn't it obvious?"" she giggled. ""You are what you eat."" 

I slammed my fist down onto the counter.

""I want to see your fucking manager, NOW!""

""Of course, sir. Right this way.""

She calmly stepped away from the register and gestured for me to follow her to the back of the bakery. I stomped down the long, sterile, white hallway as she casually led the way, glancing over her shoulder every so often with a smirk. I didn't know what I was going to say when I got to wherever we were going, but I needed answers—and this bitch apparently wasn't going to tell me jack shit. 

We reached a large door at the end of the hall with a sign that said '*MDI*' in big, bold, red letters. It was fitted with a padlock and a keypad near the handle. The lady pulled out a set of keys and fiddled with them while I waited impatiently. Finally, she opened the lock, unlatched the door, then hovered over the keypad as she punched the numbers in. A loud beep pierced through the silence, and the door slowly squealed open. 

Inside that room was the most incomprehensible horror I could've ever dared to imagine. A being so grotesque—so shocking. It froze me in place as I struggled to make sense of the unholy sight before me. 

It filled the entire room. Not only in size, but in presence. It felt ancient. And powerful. Something beyond this world... this universe. I was in awe, and yet, overwhelmed with revulsion at what I was forced to behold.

Thick, pulsating lines of bulging, red jelly snaked around doughy coils of glossy, beige flesh like veins. Layers of soured pink icing dripped from beneath a heap of encrusted rainbow sprinkles embedded firmly atop its hideous, glistening mass. This sickeningly enormous body made of sugar, fried dough, and strawberry-flavored goop terrified me to my absolute core. 

It had no eyes—just mouths. Dozens upon dozens of perfectly round gaping holes stretched across the front of it, each filled with rows of tiny, sharp, crystalline teeth that sparkled under the heat lamps above. 

And, it breathed. The coils slowly lifted and fell like folds in a stomach, as gurgling globs of chunky red viscera sputtered from the center. Steam radiated from its crispy posterior. Each time it shifted, the smell of sugar and yeast filled the air. Suffocatingly sweet and warm with rot. 

Suddenly, the door slammed shut behind me. I tore my eyes away from the monstrosity to look at the counter lady, who was now standing in front of the door, blocking my only way out. 

""*What the fuck is that?*"" I uttered with wide eyes. 

She narrowed her gaze, and the smile dropped from her face.

""Mother Donut calls to us all... and we answer."" 

I turned to look back at the oozing, demonic atrocity. 

""*This?* This is what I'm turning into?!"" 

""No, don't be ridiculous,"" she said. ""This is what created you. And those who came before you. Go on—speak to her. Ask your questions."" 

I gulped hard as I looked up at this sugary mammoth towering over me, then finally mustered up the courage to ask, 

""What's happening to me? What... *am* I?""

The plethora of holes began to move in unison as the bellowing growl of a hundred voices emitted from the effulgent mass at once. 

""You are my offspring. My sweet creation. And from within you, my seed shall spread.""

Blackness crept in from the corners of my vision as I zeroed in on this ungodly creature. I was no longer afraid. I was furious. I'd been infected with some sort of parasitic donut spawn? And for what—all because I just wanted to enjoy my cheat day? What kind of horse shit is that?? It wasn't fair... I deserved a treat!

""No, the fuck it will not!"" I screamed. ""You better undo this shit right now! Fix me back like I was or..."" 

My voice began to crack with desperation. 

""Or, I'll fucking kill you!! I didn't sign up for this shit, man! It... it was just a God damned donut!""

Giant, red bubbles suddenly spewed from her center mass like lava from a volcano. They popped and splattered my face with piping hot, rotten jelly as a guttural laugh vibrated from the mouths. 

""It cannot be undone,"" she said. ""The transformation is nearly complete, my child."" 

""Please... *oh, God*... no!"" I begged. ""I don't deserve this!!""

She growled. 

""You chose this. You agreed to it. The terms of purchase were stated clearly on the receipt you left behind on the counter without a glance."" 

The room went dead silent. I was too late. Too stupid. Too fucking self-indulgent and careless to prevent my own demise. There was nothing I could do—nothing left to say. It was time to deal with this. Time to face the facts. I was fucked. 

Sprinkles began to trickle down my face. The oven inside me suddenly shot up to 350 degrees. I bolted towards her—full speed, fists wailing. If I was going down, this bitch was coming with me. 

Just before I reached her, I felt a sudden, sharp pain in the back of my head. I fell backward, and my body hit the ground instantly with a massive thud. I looked up and saw the counter lady standing over me, now blurry, and holding a rolling pin. Then... darkness, and the faint echo of a wet, bubbling laugh. 

When I awoke, I couldn't move, but I could see. My eyes darted all around. I was no longer in the lair of the beast. Instead, I was in a white room, surrounded by a warm, fuzzy, bright light. Everything looked soft and inviting. Placid. Peaceful. Perfect. I thought I had died. I thought maybe I was in heaven. I couldn't have been more wrong. 

*BAM!!!!!*

A giant fingertip slammed down from above, pressing hard against some sort of invisible forcefield around me. It was... it was *glass*. I was under a fucking glass dome—lying next to a chocolate whore. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. Panic surged through my jelly-filled veins.

I was paralyzed. Powerless. Positively petrified. My strawberry heart thrashed hard against my pink-slathered, rainbow-sprinkled chest as a booming voice rattled the tray beneath me. 

It said,

- whole milk: classic. clean. neutral flavour. balanced consistency. complements every cereal.
- nonfat milk: not the ideal choice. watery and bland. 
- heavy cream: doesn't work for every cereal. it can be overbearing and quite rich and heavy. tolerable in small quantities. 
- melted ice cream: now obviously not with sugary cereals but with something like shredded wheat or bran flakes it can be delightful. 
- yogurt: tangy thick and refreshing. doesnt necessarily work well with the taste of every single cereal but i like it with some cereals like granola or muesli 
- fruit juice: i have tried apple, orange, grape, cranberry, pineapple juice among others over my cereals and i think it tastes good with cereals like raisin bran (grape juice), apple jacks (apple juice) shredded wheat, grape nuts, weetabix, bran flakes and other plainish cereals 
- unsweetened almond milk: 7/10

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When searching for the perfect home, many individuals and families are drawn to the charm and flexibility of barndominiums. These unique living spaces merge the rustic appeal of barn-like structures with modern living conveniences. Among the most popular styles, 4 bedroom barndominium plans with loft and porch offer remarkable design features that enhance both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

Firstly, the open floor plan is a standout feature of many 4 bedroom barndominiums. This layout facilitates a seamless flow between rooms, making it ideal for entertaining guests and allowing families to stay connected. High ceilings further amplify this effect, giving the illusion of more space and providing ample natural light through large windows. The inclusion of expansive living areas promotes versatility; whether it’s a cozy family night or a lively gathering, the space can easily accommodate various activities.

The loft space in these barndominium plans serves numerous purposes. It often acts as a second living room, a game room, or an office, offering additional square footage without the need for extensive building. This area can also be customized to suit your lifestyle. For instance, a small library nook can be created, or even a playroom for children. The loft enhances the overall design of the abode while maximizing utility.

Moreover, the presence of a porch adds significant value to barndominium living. This outdoor area acts as an extension of your home, providing a perfect spot to relax and enjoy nature. Whether you want to sip your morning coffee while watching the sunrise or host evening barbecues with family and friends, a porch is a delightful feature. Many designs include options for screened porches or wrap-around decks, allowing you to enjoy outdoor space regardless of the weather.

Here are some other innovative design features typically found in 4 bedroom barndominium plans:

- **Energy Efficiency:** Many barndominiums are built with energy-efficient materials, including insulation that not only keeps the interior warm in winter but also cool in summer. This can lead to long-term savings in energy bills.
- **Customizable Exteriors:** The exterior of a barndominium can be customized to reflect your personal style. From classic metal siding to modern wood finishes, the options are vast to give your home a unique flair.
- **Indoor/Outdoor Living:** Many barndominiums are designed to seamlessly blend indoor and outdoor spaces. Large sliding doors can connect the living room to the porch, making it easy to transition between the two areas. This feature promotes a relaxed lifestyle, perfect for gatherings or peaceful evenings.
- **Multi-Purpose Rooms:** In addition to the bedrooms, these plans often include rooms that serve multiple purposes. A guest room can double as a home gym, or a den can convert into a study. This adaptability makes it easy to use every space efficiently.

Additionally, modern kitchens featured in these plans often boast open layouts with updated appliances and ample storage. An island countertop can serve as both a cooking area and a dining spot, further promoting the concept of togetherness. The kitchen becomes a central hub where families can prepare meals while interacting with each other.

Another popular design aspect is the use of reclaimed or natural materials. Wood beams, concrete finishes, and metal accents contribute to a rustic aesthetic while ensuring durability. These materials are not just stylish; they also signify a commitment to sustainability, making barndominiums an environmentally friendly housing option.

Sustainability also extends to the gardening potential in the area surrounding the barndominium. With sufficient land, homeowners can cultivate vegetable gardens or flower beds, enhancing the beauty of the exterior while also providing home-grown produce. This ability to connect with nature improves quality of life and promotes healthy living.

4 bedroom barndominium plans with loft and porch present a unique blend of modern living and charming rustic style. With features that prioritize functionality, sustainability, and beauty, these innovative designs have become an attractive option for families seeking a harmonious and versatile living space. Whether you’re drawn to the open layouts, customizable features, or the serene beauty of porches, barndominiums offer something special for everyone.

Benefits of Choosing a Barndominium for Family Living
-----------------------------------------------------

Choosing a barndominium for family living offers a unique blend of style, comfort, and practicality. These structures, often featuring a combination of barn and condominium designs, can transform the traditional idea of housing into something fresh and appealing. Here are some benefits of opting for a barndominium as your family home.

### Space and Layout

One of the primary advantages of a barndominium is the spaciousness it provides. With high ceilings and open floor plans, these homes can accommodate large families comfortably. Here are some features that contribute to their spacious charm:

- **Open Concept Living:** The open layout encourages a sense of togetherness, allowing families to interact while cooking, dining, or relaxing.
- **Flexible Design Options:** Barndominiums can be customized with multiple bedrooms, bathrooms, and communal areas to suit any family's needs.
- **Lofts and Extra Storage:** Many designs include loft spaces that can be used for extra sleeping areas, playrooms, or storage, maximizing square footage.

### Durability and Low Maintenance

Barndominiums are typically constructed from steel or metal, making them incredibly durable. Here’s how this durability translates into family-friendly benefits:

- **Weather Resistance:** The strong materials can withstand extreme weather, ensuring your family stays safe and protected.
- **Lower Repair Costs:** With less frequent repairs needed due to robust construction, families can save money over the long term.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Improved insulation can help regulate temperatures, reducing utility bills and making your home more environmentally friendly.

### Affordability

In comparison to traditional homes, barndominiums can be more cost-effective. Here are factors contributing to their affordability:

- **Lower Construction Costs:** Using metal and open spaces often reduces the overall construction time and costs.
- **Flexible Financing:** Many lenders offer favorable loan options for barndominiums, making purchasing easier for families.
- **Reduced Property Taxes:** Depending on the region, barndominiums can have lower assessed values than traditional housing, resulting in lower property taxes.

### Aesthetic Appeal

Barndominiums are known for their unique and rustic charm. This aesthetic appeal makes them attractive to many families. Some aspects you might love include:

- **Customizable Exteriors:** Families can design the exterior to reflect personal tastes, from modern sleek finishes to rustic wood accents.
- **Open and Bright Interiors:** Large windows allow plenty of natural light, making the interior inviting and cheerful.
- **Indoor-Outdoor Living:** Many barndominiums feature large porches or patio areas, providing families with the best of both worlds when it comes to indoor and outdoor living.

### Community and Lifestyle

Living in a barndominium often means being part of a community that values space, nature, and a slower pace of life. Here are some lifestyle benefits:

- **Close to Nature:** Many barndominiums are located in rural or semi-rural areas, allowing families to enjoy outdoor activities, like hiking and gardening.
- **Family Bonding:** The open spaces and communal layouts encourage families to spend more quality time together.
- **Greater Privacy:** Barndominiums often sit on larger parcels of land, offering families the privacy they desire.

Ultimately, a barndominium provides a unique alternative to traditional family living. The combination of spacious layouts, durability, affordability, aesthetic appeal, and lifestyle opportunities make it a great choice for families looking to embrace a new way of life. You’ll find that this modern take on rural living not only meets your family's needs but also inspires creativity and connection in your everyday life.

### Conclusion

Choosing a 4 bedroom barndominium plan with a loft and porch offers an innovative and versatile living option that caters to modern family needs. The unique design features of barndominiums, such as open floor plans and ample natural light, create inviting spaces for both relaxation and social gatherings. The loft area can serve various purposes, whether as a playroom for children, a quiet office space, or an additional guest room. This flexibility is one of the many reasons families are increasingly drawn to barndominiums.

The benefits of opting for a barndominium go beyond just aesthetics. These structures are known for their durability and energy efficiency, often leading to lower maintenance costs over time. With the ability to customize layouts, families can design their home to fit specific lifestyle needs, whether that includes large family gatherings or dedicated workspaces. The added porch not only enhances the charm of your barndominium but also provides a perfect outdoor space for family Barbecues, morning coffee, or simply enjoying the sunset.

Ultimately, a 4 bedroom barndominium with a loft and porch presents a harmonious blend of innovative design and practical living. It’s a sound investment in your family’s future, offering both comfort and functionality. As you embark on your journey to create your dream home, consider how these unique plans can enrich your living experience and strengthen family bonds. The perfect combination of style, innovation, and versatility awaits you in a barndominium that truly feels like home.",1,1755711769.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

1mvlqef,https://www.reddit.com/r/roadtrip/comments/1mvlqef/coast_to_coast_in_search_of_the_perfect_chicken/,Coast to coast in search of the perfect chicken nugget-,"Recent road trips have really proved to me that our favorite companies have lost sight of consistency.
Three of us landed in Bozeman, Montana. A long drive ahead of us. We were searching for Chick-fil-A because we were all tired and we wanted something that tasted like we would expect..
They were closed so we ended up at a McDonald’s.
The chicken nuggets were hard. The french fries were cold and it was another 2 hours to cabin.

This inability to understand why customers continue to return or abandon a company seems lost on today’s CEOs .
Show me a company struggling and I’ll show you a CEO who came in and changed what was working .
I “road trip”
a lot on Southwest, which is now completely changed.All they really needed to do was charge for one bag and leave one bag free. One move would’ve brought in new cash and retained loyal customers.
Taco Bell -after long days of driving or working, many crave food brand consistency. Taco Bell used to be perfect for eating in the car . Now no matter what you order it’s not as expected.
The company’s that do consistency, best -Chick-fil-A, 
In-N-Out, Subway and Buffalo wild wings .
Subway is another perfect food to eat on the road and it’s nice to know that chicken sandwich is going to taste the same in Oklahoma as it does in New Mexico.
I’ll give Popeyes chicken Credit most of theirs taste the same but I have run into a few missing both taste in service. One example of that sits on I 240 and Sooner  Road interestingly enough the same group owns the McDonald’s across the street and people complain constantly that the food is not up to what you expect from this brand and service is sorely lacking.
The Taco Bell that we all loved in the 1980s was consistent no matter where you were in the country. I lived coast-to-coast and back then and I could always count on Taco Bell being what I expected. When my husband was away out of the country, the first meal he craved when he came home- Taco Bell.
Now, when you go to Taco Bell, you’re lucky if you get two items that look the same much less the same taste. 

That begs the question why do companies hire “CEOs”simply because they’ve been a CEO instead of their success or failures? These giant salaries have made them lose sight of what makes loyal customers.
We drove from Oklahoma City to South Dakota and back the brands we found consistent in this 5 Day drive were Holiday Inn express and Chick-fil-A. 
I rent from Enterprise no matter where I’m traveling, because they’re consistent. This means a lot when you’re tired .

When I’m traveling, I love all the things that are different but I love the comfort of knowing what will be the same. 
In Bodega Bay, there is a small restaurant right on the waters edge and they serve the most delicious clam chowder and fish tacos. They have been serving the same food for years and it’s the reason we drive two hours to go have lunch.
On the franchise front again when you’re in the car for days at a time and you’re hoping to find exactly what you feel like eating, you might crave Kentucky Fried chicken and then you find Kentucky Fried chicken is trying to make everything but chicken!
Looking for a meal inside instead of eating in the car -for years I ate at  Chili’s. One night after traveling through three airports in up in Philadelphia the only thing open next to hotel was Chili’s .
I made sure to review and appreciate their chicken and waffles, around COVID they gotten rid of chicken and waffles.

I completely understand not doing things that would take away from your profit, but what I see is companies trying to be everything to everyone instead of being really good at taking care of their base .

The chicken nugget issue with McDonald’s isn’t just a kid’s menu item. Chicken nuggets are perfect when you’re driving down the road and you can’t look at what you’re eating. However, the consistency that McDonald’s used to be known for has gone away, and I really don’t understand why unless it’s training.
Chicken nuggets shouldn’t be so hard as to  chip a tooth or cold and mushy. I’m just looking for consistency on the road- 
Is it really to much to ask for hot fresh chicken nuggets- hot, fresh and chicken’y!?
Most agree that customer service has gone the way of the Snow leopards. Still in existence, but exceptionally hard to come by-many say it’s because of the social structure we now live in, but if that’s true why can Chick-fil-A and In-N-Out be so exceptional ?!?!

I noticed at Starbucks is taking a hard look at getting back to basics which is great because every time I’m in the Sacramento airport I have to wait behind people ordering food and can’t get my coffee. I’ve never understood why they didn’t just have a food line and one where you could just get your coffee. I’ve heard that’s changing and if so, hurrah for their management making the change.

People are busy and overwhelmed with technology and the one thing that should be easy when you’re out on the road is finding a consistent meals, lodging, and travel services .
So that’s my question to the Reddit world -why do companies like Taco Bell, Kentucky, Fried chicken, Arby’s, keep trying to be everything to everyone instead of being consistent and really good with the items that we crave that gave them their start?

""...What?""

""I know it must have freaked you out. But, they're for a model I've been working on.""

I was still extremely skeptical.

It seemed like a strange choice to me, but conceivable, I suppose. John was a very smart man, though sometimes his logic and reasoning on certain things differed drastically from my own. Maybe he thought doing that would protect them from dust particles or something.

He paused for a moment, took a deep breath, then looked down at his plate. 

""I sweat a lot, Sonia. You know I've been working out more lately, too. I got up extra early and went for a run before I made those. *God,* I'm embarrassed now."" 

""So, what about last night in bed? Are you going to try to tell me *that* was just sweat, too?""

My heart flopped in my chest as soon as the words had left my mouth. He looked back up at me, and his eyes softened.

""*Yes...* I was having a nightmare. *Oh, Sonia,* it was awful. And it felt so real.""

""Wait, I don't understand,"" I said, scrunching my eyebrows at him. ""Why did you say you were wet from the shower, then?""

""Because that's what happened in my dream. I was being drowned in the bathtub by some unseen force.""

He broke his gaze from me to turn and set his plate down on the coffee table in front of us before continuing. 

""Whatever it was, I couldn't see it; I could only feel it. All I really remember is that I was lying in the bathtub, unable to move, while it held my face down under the shower head. So, when I woke up drenched and struggling to breathe, I thought it had really happened—that I'd somehow escaped and reached the bed. I tried to wake you up to help me, but... you freaked out. And I was still so disoriented. It didn't hit me that it was just a dream until you said I was scaring you. By then, you were so upset all I could do was say sorry and go sleep on the couch. But that's why I got off work early today. I wanted to make your favorite dish and apologize.""

He reached out his hand and gently grabbed ahold of mine. It all seemed so bizarre. But, at the same time, just plausible enough to stop me in my tracks and force me to recalibrate. I didn't understand how a person could possibly sweat that much, though. I mean, I know hyperhidrosis is a thing, but I had no idea that it could present to such a degree. Or, maybe he actually *had* started sleepwalking and almost drowned himself. Either way, I felt bad. I realized I'd been so stuck in my own head that whole time. I hadn't even considered how *he* might have been feeling. 

Flipping around the perspective, it would actually be *me* who looked like the irrational one. Throwing away the apology cinnamon rolls and crumpling up the note, screaming at him in bed and acting like he was a monster, sneaking around and collecting model fish scales to have them tested... *God.* No wonder they couldn't be identified. I felt absolutely ridiculous.

He told me he'd just been really stressed about this new project at work. Evidently, it was making him irritable and manifesting itself in other strange ways, too. I accepted his apology and his explanations, then told him I was sorry, too, for how I'd reacted to things. We finished our meal and the episode of Deadliest Catch in silence. Then, John took my plate and told me not to worry about the dishes; he'd have them washed and put away by the time I got out of the shower. 

The bathroom was spotless. His shaving kit wasn't out, and the tub looked pristine, like it had been scrubbed clean and polished. It looked better than it did when we moved in. I smiled. It seemed like he was truly making a concerted effort to set things right between us.

As I exited the bathroom in my robe, he came running down the hallway like a toddler, gleefully shouting,

""My turn!!""

I chuckled and rolled my eyes, then went off to bed to wait for him. He stayed in the bathroom showering for a long time; the sound of running water felt endless. When he finally emerged, he immediately crawled into bed with me and scooted his body close to mine, putting his arm around me and pulling me into an embrace. He was warm again. He felt like *John* again. I closed my eyes as he leaned in and whispered,

""I love you, Sonia.""

I told him I loved him, too. He gently kissed my cheek, then asked,

""You wanna *spawn?*"" 

My eyes popped open, and I slowly turned my face to see his big, cheesy smile looming over me. I let out a weak, nervous laugh, and he winked. It was just a joke, albeit a poorly timed one. But still on par with John's typical goofy sense of humor, I thought. The tension in my body began to fade away as he started running his hands softly across my skin. We made love passionately that night. It felt the way it did when we had first gotten together, like all the magic between us was still very much alive. I peacefully drifted off to sleep in his arms, with my mind finally at ease. 

For a while, it truly seemed like I had gotten him back. The more normal he acted, the more I convinced myself I'd just been overreacting that entire time. No more yelling or violent outbursts.  On the contrary, he seemed to be in a great mood all the time. The John from our college years suddenly seemed to resurface—the version that had won me over. He was kind, so affectionate, and more attentive than he'd been in years. It felt like he was courting me all over again. 

Because of this, I doubted my own judgment and perception. I swallowed all of my suspicions and stopped digging around and asking questions. I ignored the faint scent of putrid decay coming from the bathroom, telling myself it must be an issue with our septic system. I lathered tons of lotion on my increasingly drying skin and chalked it up to winter. But the most foolish thing I did? I allowed my heart to lure my mind into believing the thing I wanted so desperately to be true. 

By the next week, I'd almost forgotten about the whole thing. Then, one morning, everything changed. We were at the front door, grabbing our things from the coat closet and getting ready to leave for work. I looked down and caught a glimpse of something odd. Something that didn't belong. Something *fishy*. Lying just within view, sitting inconspicuously on the sole of his shoe, was a single strand of seaweed.

As I quickly inspected it, my heart sank. *No...* It wasn't one of those dried seaweed snacks they sell at the Asian market. It looked slimy and wet—like it had just been dragged up from the water. Portions of the roots were still attached. I only had about a half-second to process this information before he shoved his foot into the loafer. *Fuck.*

He walked me to my car and kissed me goodbye. With clenched teeth, I forced a smile and drove away, looking at him through my rearview mirror. He stood there in the driveway and watched my car until I began to turn left at the stop sign at the end of our street. As soon as I was out of his sight, I punched hard on the gas. 

*God dammit,* I thought, slamming my hand onto the top of the steering wheel. *Why?* Why did I have to see that? Why did it have to be there?? Things had finally started to feel normal again, and now this? *What the fuck?!* I drove to work in a silent state of panic, desperately trying to stop myself from spiraling. 

It's just a piece of seaweed, I told myself. It meant nothing. He could have been doing field research for the lab. *Hell,* there could be several perfectly rational explanations as to how it had gotten there. I mean, he was a marine biologist, and we lived in Bar Harbor, for Christ's sake. The ocean was five minutes from everywhere. It's not like seaweed was an uncommon thing to see around Maine. With as far as the tides drew back at the bay, it was practically expected. 

Things between us had been going so perfectly... better than they'd been in a while, actually. I couldn't let this one little strange sighting ruin all of that. I forced it to the back of my mind and tried to focus on my job. I had a report to finish on fishery management and my boss was asking for progress updates daily. As the day went on, though, my mind began to wander. During my lunch break, I started googling. 

*Symptoms of psychosis:*
-Hallucinations
-Delusions
-Confused and disturbed thoughts. 

Okay, *shit.* That sounded like it could possibly apply to me as much as it did to him. If I'm being honest, I wasn't entirely sure what was real and what I'd just been imagining. At that point, the only thing I was sure of was that either John was losing his mind or I was. I can confirm that I was definitely experiencing the *'confused and disturbed thoughts'* part, though. 

*Symptoms of a brain tumor:*
-Headaches
-Seizures
-Changes in mental function, mood, or personality. 

*Hmm...* That last symptom hit a little too close to home. I bit down on my bottom lip and hit the backspace button. Trying to diagnose him using WebMD would be impossible. It would also serve to further my paranoia, which was the last thing I needed at the time. I'd just have to keep watching him to see if any more symptoms appeared. 

I dug around in my Greek salad, chasing a Kalamata olive with my fork, when a thought came to me. I typed *'marine hatchetfish'* into the search bar. Living in depths of up to 4,000 feet, they looked about how you'd expect. Hideous little things with enormous bulging eyes, a downturned gaping mouth full of tiny sharp teeth, and a grotesquely misshaped body. I remember thinking how terrifying these creatures would be if they weren't small enough to fit inside a human palm.  

Its scales were silver and reflective, just like John's model scales looked. If John was making a model, why would he choose such an ugly specimen? Let alone one belonging to a genus that wasn't even remotely in his realm of studies. I suppose he could have taken a personal interest in this particular fish, but I still didn't understand why. So, I kept reading.

There are seven documented species of Argyropelegcus, otherwise known as silver hatchetfish. Each species differs slightly in size and range, but they all share a few common traits. They feed on prey like small crustaceans, shrimp, and fish larvae, which they hunt by migrating to the surface at night. They utilize their disproportionately large pupils to detect even the faintest traces of light. And, like many deep-sea fish, they possess bioluminescence. A set of tiny blue, glowing lights emitting from their underbellies act to mimic rippling sunlight, concealing them from predators below: a nifty little evolutionary trick referred to as counter-illumination. 

Not exactly groundbreaking stuff. But, I suppose I could see why John might have taken an interest in them. He'd always been particularly fascinated with bioluminescence, after all. I mean, you'd be hard-pressed to find a biologist who didn't at least agree that it was one of the most amazing natural phenomena to grace our planet. Maybe he was planning to attach tiny LED lights to his model. With it being almost December, maybe he'd been working on this as a Christmas gift for a colleague. Or, perhaps even an ornament for our tree? I hoped.

I slid my phone into my pocket and went back to work, determined to finish my report. At the very least, I needed to complete the first draft of it. I couldn't afford to let myself go overboard with obsessive thoughts over what was going on in John's mind. I had my own career to focus on... my *own* damn life to live, too, you know? I was able to power through the conclusion of my report by the end of that afternoon. Not my best work, I'll admit, but it was something to show my boss the next day.

John's vehicle was already in the driveway when I got home. I glanced over and noticed that the gate to the backyard was open, and the hose was trailing around the corner of the house from the front spigot. But I didn't think much of it at that moment. I walked inside and saw his field bag lying on the floor in front of the coat closet. None of the lights had been turned on, and the TV was off. 

""John?"" 

No answer. I set my bag down on the floor next to his, then made my way to the kitchen. His keys and pocket change were sitting atop the island, but other than that, the room was exactly as we'd left it that morning. I thought back to the hose. Maybe he's gardening out in the backyard? Wait, in mid-November? *No, Sonia—get it together!* My persistent urge to explain away odd behaviors in order to maintain the status quo had begun to seriously damage my inductive reasoning skills. 

My search for him had to be put on pause, however, at the request of my bladder. I shuffled to the bathroom, flipped on the light, and hurried to the toilet to relieve myself. I flushed, washed my hands, then shut off the faucet. When I did, I could suddenly hear a drip coming from the bathtub. But it wasn't the *'plop'* sound that water makes when it hits a dry surface. It was the *'plunk... plunk... plunk...'* you hear when it's dripping into more water below. 

My blood ran cold, and my hand began to tremble as I slowly reached out toward the shower curtain. I quickly forced in a deep breath. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Then, I ripped the curtain back. There was John. He was just lying there, fully submerged and motionless, eyes closed and arms folded across his chest. Large chunks of ice floated in the water surrounding his body. My heart stopped. I fell to my knees, screamed his name, and threw my arms out to grab him from the water. Then... his eyes popped open.

His pupils were two enormous pools of blackness, covering almost the entire diameter of his iris. For a second, I froze; he was looking at me so intensely that it felt like his gaze directly pierced into the depths of my soul. Then, he blinked, releasing me from his trance. I fell backward and immediately started scrambling to secure a foothold on the fuzzy mat beneath me. As I tried desperately to stand back up, John's body began to slowly rise from the water. He then turned his face to look at me, and the corners of his mouth started to recede into a smile before he uttered,

""Hey, Sonia! Did I scare you?""

I blinked a few times, mouth hanging open like a bass, completely dumbfounded by the audacity of this question. I took a few seconds to catch my breath while I stared at him. Then, the visceral reaction I'd internalized suddenly bubbled over and erupted to the surface. 

""*JOHN!!!*"" I shrieked, and my voice began to break. ""I thought you were fucking *DEAD!!*""

He laughed. 

""Oh, wow, Sonia—that's dramatic. I'm just doing a cold plunge!""

I rose to my feet, still in shock and trying to choke back the tears that had begun to flood my eyes. 

""...*What?!*""

He stepped out of the tub and began toweling himself off. 

""A cold plunge! Howard from work told me it would help me go harder on my workouts. It actually feels great; you should try it!"" he said. 

""*Fully clothed?!*"" I yelled.

""Well, yeah, Sonia... that's how you do it. You don't get naked like it's a regular bath,"" he giggled. 

I just stared at him blankly until that stupid smile had left his face. 

""Are you okay?"" he asked. ""Jeez, I had no idea that it would actually frighten you. I'm sorry.""

I wasn't sure if I believed him or not, but that wasn't my focus at the time. There was an intense rage simmering inside of me. I wanted to scream and cry and beat my fists against his chest. How could he be so dismissive? So callus? But I knew at that moment trying to convey those feelings to him would do no good. Neither would it be to continue to question him. 

""It's fine,"" I said. 

It most certainly was not fine, but I didn't want him to think otherwise. The panic hadn't yet left my body, and with it came a type of calculated behavior I can only attribute to pure survival instinct. I allowed him to think I'd gotten over it and started dinner. 

It was a Tuesday, so I was making tacos. Cliché, I know. But it was just one of my things. After he'd dried himself off and changed clothes, he came into the kitchen and sat down at the island. I didn't turn around to look at him; I just kept stirring the ground beef in the pan. 

""You know,"" he said, ""I've been craving seafood lately."" 

I froze in place, gripping tightly onto the wooden spoon. 

""Maybe next Tuesday we can have fish tacos. Or later this week, we could try shrimp scampi?"" he continued.

It took everything in me not to react, but I resumed stirring and replied,

""Yeah, sure. That sounds good. I can look up some recipes."" 

John had never asked for seafood before. He'd eat it if offered, but it was never one of his favorites. Was he testing me? If so, I hoped I passed. We ate, watched TV, and then I went to the bathroom to shower. This was my chance. I turned on the faucet in the bathtub, locked the door, and then went straight for his shaving kit on the counter. 

My heart was pounding out of my chest as I unzipped the kit, being extremely careful not to disturb whatever contents were concealed inside. And yes, I found exactly what I feared I'd find. More scales. A lot of them. Silvery, delicate, but this time... dried. And horrifyingly, they were speckled with tiny red drops of what looked like blood. I leaned in closer and pulled out my phone to start taking pictures. When I zoomed in, I noticed that attached to the inner edge of each scale was a half-ring of beige-colored tissue. Flesh. It was *human* flesh. 

*Motherfucker.* I dropped my phone and gripped the counter to steady myself, but the room was already spinning. I had to keep breathing... I had to move... I had to turn off the water. I ran over to the bathtub and shut it off right before it overflowed. Dark spots began to appear in my line of vision, and the blood drained from my face as an overwhelming wave of dizziness swept over my body. Fearing I was going to pass out, I lowered myself down onto the floor beside the tub and focused on the ripples in the water, trying to ground myself. 

The mystery white sediment had come back, lining every corner and crack of the tub. Little chunks of it were floating all over the surface. *What the hell?* How could it have come back so quickly? And so much?? I reached out and plucked the nearest chunk from the water. It was soft and started to crumble at the edges. Then, without thinking, I lifted it to my mouth and tasted it. *Salt.*

My world felt as if it were closing in on me. It didn't matter how many times my mind repeated the word *'no'*, the facts remained. I couldn't wish this away. I felt broken and completely lost. There was nothing I could do except to try to go through the motions of the rest of the night. I bathed, got dressed, went to bed, and pretended to be asleep. 

It took about an hour for him to crawl into bed next to me, then another to confirm he was sleeping. As soon as he started snoring, I rolled over in bed to face him, then lifted the covers and looked down at his body. *I need to check,* I thought. Holding my breath, I reached out and gently lifted the back of his shirt, disrupting his breathing pattern and causing him to shift slightly. I let go but scooted closer. Being caught inspecting his body that way would throw up alarms that I was onto him, but using my hands to do it under the ruse of cuddling wouldn't, I thought. 

I put my arm around him, resting it on his side. He didn't react, so I slid my hand underneath his shirt and slowly moved it around his back, searching for any anomaly. His skin was ice cold again and clammy. Almost *rubbery*. Other than that, I didn't feel anything else strange. So, I slowly moved down to his hip. When I got there, I froze. Something instantly felt wrong. Like, *very* wrong. 

His pelvic bone seemed to have somehow shifted from its natural upright position to tilting *downward.* My eyes widened, but I slowly resumed my inspection. As I began to run my fingers under the line of his boxers in disbelief, something hard and sharp protruding from his tailbone pricked the tip of my index finger. I ripped my hand away and instantly brought it to my mouth to stop the bleeding. When I did, my finger tasted like brine. I quickly turned back over to face my alarm clock. 

That night, as I lay in bed next to him, I didn't sleep. Instead, I resumed my endless loop of thoughts. And, in those thoughts, I finally stumbled upon a tiny speck of clarity drifting within a sea of confusion. I couldn't continue to live in this little fantasy land, pretending everything was perfect no matter how much I wanted to. What I needed was to be logical. I needed to look at this from a scientific perspective. Step one: form a theory. *I think my husband is a fucking fish person.* Step two: collect evidence in hopes of disproving said theory.

At exactly 4:44 AM, John stopped snoring. I shut my eyes tightly and waited as he got up and went to the bathroom. He spent about twenty minutes in there, doing God knows what, then immediately left the house. When I heard his engine start out front, I shot up and ran to the window. Then, I watched his headlights trail down the street until he got to the stop sign. He didn't take a left into town. Instead, he took a right, headed toward the ocean. 

I ran to the front door, grabbed my keys and a coat, and then shoved my feet into the first pair of shoes I could find. The harsh, cold night air hit me like a steamship, nearly knocking me over. I pulled the hood up over my head and scurried to my car, then tore down Hancock Street after him. A rush of adrenaline began surging through my body as I got closer and closer to the coast. Squinting through the darkness of the deserted street, I looked around in all directions, frantically trying to locate his vehicle. Then, I spotted it parked just outside the house of a local artist. 

The Shore Path ahead was closed for the winter, so I turned down Devilstone Way, made a U-turn to face the end of the road, and cut my lights off. Although the thought crossed my mind, my gut told me that he wasn't inside that house. I got out of my car, leaving it running, and started walking toward the bay. I ducked down under the large *'BEACH CLOSED'* sign and continued until I was a few feet away from the rocky coastline. And there he was. The dark silhouette of my husband... standing still at the water's edge, staring directly out into the abyss, and completely nude. 

My heart began thrashing against my chest like a fish caught in a net. On his lower back, a small, spiny dorsal fin glimmered in the moonlight. His legs were completely covered in silver scales from the knees down. Then, he began to turn his body in my direction, revealing the full extent of his pelvic deformity. I quickly lowered myself behind a large rock and watched on in horror through the fog as he turned back around and slowly began walking—straight into the fucking ocean. 

I stood there, paralyzed with terror, as his head slowly sunk below the surface. Only a few breathless moments passed before he suddenly breached while biting down hard on a lobster. It thrashed and squirmed within the confines of his jaws until he'd separated the tail from the body. *Holy fuck.* My mind was unable to process what I was truly witnessing.

Instinct took over, and my hand shot up, covering my mouth to stifle my scream. I turned around and ran full speed back to my car. I didn't look behind me; I was too afraid. I just kept running and praying to God that he hadn't seen me. I threw the car in drive and booked it home, knowing he would be making his way back there any minute now that he'd had his... *breakfast.* I gagged, but I didn't have the time to be squeamish. The clock was ticking. I had to come up with a plan and fast. *Shit,* why couldn't I have married a nice boring accountant?!

When I got back inside the house, I slammed the door shut and looked down at John's field bag sitting on the floor next to the coat closet. I knew I only had seconds to spare, so I went straight for the side pocket where I knew he kept his flash drives. It was the only chance I had to find out exactly what I was dealing with here. I reached inside and dug around. *Yes!* My fingers met one just as I heard the brakes of his Jeep Wrangler squeal. I grabbed the drive and hurried to the bedroom, jumping into bed and throwing the covers over myself.

The front door latched closed, and I struggled to slow my breathing to an even, steady pace. I couldn't even begin to tell you the horrific thoughts that crossed my mind as I lay there, helpless. Just how far would he go to protect this secret from me? I listened to the noise of his wet feet *'plap-plaping'* around the house, using it to track his every movement like sonar. He never entered the bedroom, though. Just went through his normal morning routine, whatever that meant, then left for work. 

I didn't know if he'd seen me. *Hell,* a part of me didn't even care. Things couldn't continue this way. After what I'd just seen, it was impossible. Yet, somehow, John had been able to quickly conjure up an excuse for every outlandish behavior he'd displayed thus far. He'd probably tell me I must've been dreaming or something. Confronting him using only words wasn't an option. I needed irrefutable evidence, even more than I'd already collected. 

I called my boss, telling him I was sick and that I wouldn't be able to make it into work. He'd just have to wait one more day for that report. I had bigger fish to fry. I grabbed the laptop from my field bag and sat down at the island, booting it up and inserting the flash drive with shaking hands. I hesitated for a moment before opening the file. Did I really want to know the truth? Was I truly ready to open up this can of worms? I knew that from this point on, there was no going back. I inhaled slowly and deeply, then clicked. 

The top of the page read:
*MDI Biological Laboratory: Pioneering New Approaches in Regenerative Medicine.*   

*Fuck.* Jessica was right. Should I call her? No, I can't. She made it clear she didn't want to be involved. I was on my own with this. With bated breath, I scrolled on. 

What followed was a wall of text filled with scientific jargon. I'll spare you the complicated details and summarize the best I can in layman's terms. Researchers were able to create synthetic bioluminescence systems by modifying a specific enzyme called *'luciferase,'* using a process known as directed evolution. This allowed for use in various applications, including the deep organs and tissues of other living animals. Yes, you did read that correctly. 

There are more than forty known bioluminescent systems in the natural world, but only eleven of them have been able to be recreated and utilized by scientists with this specific technology. A new research project was formed in hopes of discovering how to manipulate and synthesize other bioluminescent systems, including those containing *'aequorin,'* the photoprotein responsible for creating *blue* light. 

Oh... my... fucking... God. I slammed the laptop shut. It all made sense; the clammy skin, the salt everywhere, the *'cold plunges,'* the *LOBSTER?!?!* Christ—all of it! *Son of a bitch.* I wondered what else I'd missed and started tearing the house apart, looking for more evidence. I'm well aware that I'd already collected more than enough in support of my theory. What I was looking for, secretly wishing for, was *anything* that might prove me wrong. 

Instead, I found more dried-up fish scales tucked away in different drawers all over the house. I found salt lining the corners of the floors and crusting to the edges of the baseboards. In the bathroom trashcan were several shrimp heads hidden underneath wads of slimy toilet paper. I remembered the hose and went out to the backyard to see what he'd been doing. 

A giant hole had been dug in the middle of our yard and filled with water, creating an enormous mud pit that spanned almost the entire length of the fence line. A dozen or so empty bags of aquarium salt lay discarded on the grass beside it. 

I dropped down to the ground, my knees hitting the cold, soggy grass at the same time my heart did. I knew... I knew with every fiber of my being. But I still needed to hear him say it. It was the only way I'd have any chance of helping him. I was convinced that this *had* to have been some sort of horrible accident. He must've gotten involved with this sketchy research somehow, and maybe he'd cut himself while handling some of the genetic material. 

If I could just find a way to force him into telling me what had happened. If I could back him into a corner to where he could no longer deny it, then maybe together, we could try to reverse whatever was going on with his body. Or, at the very least, stop it from getting any worse. I hoped. 

I walked inside the house, sat down at the laptop, and went back to the very first thing I'd researched when all of this crazy shit started. Hatchetfish. And then, with about four hours until he arrived back home from work, I formed a hypothesis... and devised a plan.

Tuna. One of the top predators in the ocean. An unsuspecting killer lurking in the depths of the Atlantic. The local seafood market had it on sale that week. Freshly cut tuna steaks for $10.99 per pound. I drove into town and purchased two large steaks, along with the ingredients needed to make a lemon-caper sauce. Then, I sped back home, with my thoughts racing. 

I needed once and for all to expose him for the fish-man I knew he was. To provoke a response so extreme, so undeniable it would be impossible for him to hide or explain away. I didn’t care anymore about how he might react. I was prepared to do whatever I had to do to save my husband. I looked down at my watch. *3:41 PM.* A little more than an hour left. The food would take almost no time at all to prepare, so I used the remaining moments I had alone to go through our wedding album. 

I sat down on the couch with tears forming behind my eyes as I reflected on how happy that day was for us. Best day of our lives. The last five years with him had truly been so perfect. I couldn't understand why or even how it had all gone so wrong so quickly. All I knew was that I had to try to fix this. I had to get John back. 

I sunk down into the cushions and began hugging the throw pillow beside me. Suddenly, my phone vibrated, jolting me back into an upright position. 

""Headed home.""

*Go-time.* I shut the photo album, wiped my eyes, and then made my way to the kitchen. I started on the sauce first, throwing it together in about ten minutes and remembering to set aside a few lemon wedges to use as garnish. Then, I started searing the tuna: one and a half minutes on each side. I set two plates out on the island and took in a deep breath as I heard him pull into the driveway. 

My entire body was shaking, but I knew I had to try to stay calm. I couldn't risk spooking him before he was in position. 

""*Hey...*"" he said with a confused smile as he entered the kitchen. 

Standing strategically in front of the pan on the stove, I replied, 

""Hey, John. I've got a surprise for dinner tonight."" 

He sat down and sniffed at the air intensely. Then, he stopped, and the smile slowly faded from his face. His Adam's apple bounced upward as he swallowed hard, and his pupils began to dilate. 

""What is it?"" He asked nervously. 

I grabbed the pan from the stove and quickly plopped one of the steaks down onto the plate in front of him. 

""Tuna,"" I said. 

He looked down at it, and his eyes widened. As I began to pour the sauce over his steak, his nostrils flared, and he began breathing heavily. I squeezed a bit of juice from the lemon wedge around his plate. But I was so focused on watching him for a reaction that I accidentally squirted a droplet into his eye. 

He didn't flinch. Instead, two vertical-facing inner eyelids quickly slid from each corner, meeting in the middle with a squish. My mouth fell open, and I gasped. I dropped the wedge and ripped my hand away, but before I could even fully react to that horror, another began to unfold in front of me. On his stomach, underneath his button-up Hawaiian shirt, a set of six tiny blue lights began to glow. 

I jumped backward, tripping on the barstool next to me and hitting the ground hard. I quickly scrambled back up to my feet, then pointed my finger at John and screamed,

*""I FUCKING KNEW IT!!""*

His expression remained neutral as he looked down at his glowing belly, then back up at me. I'd finally caught him—no way he was going to be able to wriggle his way off *this* hook. There was nothing he could say, nothing he could do. Now, he'd have to admit to me what was truly going on. 

""Sonia. I'm dying.""

Those three words snatched the wind right out of my sails. It couldn't be real. My chest tightened, and my arm dropped back down to my side. The room filled with a stifling thickness as he looked up at me with dread. 

""*… What?*"" 

He hung his head low as he slowly pushed the plate away from himself and whispered, 

""I thought I had more time. But, nothing I've tried has worked.""

""John, I don't understand. Tell me what happened to you!"" I demanded. 

He took in a deep breath, tapped his finger on the island a few times, and then began to speak. 

""Back when this all started, I honestly never thought it would go *this* far. At first, it was just a joke. Howard dared me to do it. Stupid, I know.""

He forced out a nervous laugh. Then, his leg began bouncing up and down as I stared on in silence. His head rose, his lip beginning to quiver. He looked me straight in the eyes and continued,

""During the first few weeks, I quickly realized that some of the changes were... well, more than I'd bargained for, to say the least. Sonia, I swear—I tried to stop it, I tried to fix it. But... I don't know, I just... couldn't keep myself from going back. I started to like it."" 

""*John...* are... are you telling me you did this to yourself? *On purpose??*"" 

A single black tear escaped from his eye, trailing down the side of his cheek. 

""I didn't know what would happen,"" he said, his voice trembling with shame. 

""Well, it stops now!!"" I screamed. 

He slowly stood up from the barstool and placed his icy-cold hand on my shoulder. While looking deep into my eyes, he said, 

""It's too late.""

""John, no! *Please,* we have to tell someone! We have to at least try to get you help!!"" I begged.

He shook his head, his face sullen and streaked with more black stains. 

""I've taken too many doses. The effects are irreversible at this point. I've been trying to do everything I can to make living on land more comfortable for myself, so I could stay here with you. But, no matter what I do, it's becoming increasingly unbearable by the minute. I'm so sorry, Sonia. I wanted to tell you, I really did, but... I just couldn't. I'm so ashamed. I don't even know who I am or *what* I am anymore. Please, *please* forgive me.""

At that moment, the earth stopped spinning. All sound escaped from the room, and I was left only with the deafening thud of my heartbeat flooding my ears. I couldn't think. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't cry. I just stood there, frozen and hollow, as all the pieces of this puzzle finally snapped into place, and my entire world crumbled around me. My knees buckled, and I fell forward into his arms. 

Somehow, I allowed myself to forgive him for what he had done to himself, for committing this act of betrayal that cut so deeply. He hadn't done it to hurt me. His curiosity had gotten the better of him. That was just John. We embraced each other tightly for a few minutes before I was able to finally work up the courage to ask him, 

""What do we do now?"" 

The answer was simple but far from easy. In fact, it would be the hardest thing I'd ever have to do in my life for many reasons, and I didn't know if I had the heart to bear it. This choice would be one of the most devastating decisions a person could be asked to make. And yet, I agreed. 

I'm at the cove now, watching the dark waves violently crash against the rocks, letting the cold breeze sweep across my face as the sun sets on the horizon. I'm going to end this by saying: I love my husband... I truly do. I'll try to come back here to visit him whenever I can. But I *cannot* watch him slowly die in our house. I can't be selfish like that. It isn't about what I want. It's about what *he needs.* And I know deep down in my heart the right thing to do for him is to let him go.

My job was to preserve and protect coastal ecosystems. But today, instead of a report, I'll be handing in my resignation. To anyone reading this: I'm so sorry. The truth is, I have no idea what I've just released into that water and unleashed onto the world.",1,1755711595.0,u_jadegreen88,0,1.0,False

Hey ❤️ I am Polish Cool Guy 🇵🇱

I love cooking so let’s share some recipes.

1mvll5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeTested/comments/1mvll5p/reveal_the_best_single_serve_espresso_machine/,Reveal the Best Single Serve Espresso Machine Breville Vertuo Worth It,"Testing out the Breville Vertuo, I quickly realized why coffee and espresso enthusiasts flock to this machine. As someone who relies heavily on caffeine to kickstart the day, I had high hopes for this renewed model, especially since it boasts professional inspection and testing to look and work like new. Right from unboxing, I could tell this wasn’t just another coffee maker. Its sleek black exterior, coupled with its compact design of 10.75 x 14 x 14.5 inches, seamlessly fit on my cluttered kitchen countertop.

### **Design and Build Quality**

Elegance meets functionality in this coffee machine. It’s compact, weighing a manageable 11.43 pounds, yet sturdy enough to feel like a premium product. The removable 40 oz. water tank is positioned thoughtfully, making refills remarkably hassle-free. As a person who appreciates attention to detail, the buttons feel responsive and are neatly aligned at the top of the machine. Also, the black finish didn't just complement my kitchen’s aesthetics; it made maintaining it easier since fingerprints and stains weren't as glaring as I’ve seen on other appliances.

### **Ease of Use**

I have to admit, single-button operation changed my mornings. Brewing both coffee and espresso was as straightforward as inserting a capsule, pressing the button, and waiting for the magic to happen. The Nespresso Vertuo capsules are designed to pair exclusively with this machine. While I initially grappled with the idea of using non-reusable capsules, the effortless operation won me over. Whether it’s a quick double espresso shot or a 14 oz. Alto brew for extended work sessions, the machine adjusted seamlessly.  

[Check Breville Vertuo price on Amazon.](https://heatad.com/t/b07qk26f64/)

### **Performance and Brewing Technology**

What impressed me the most was the Centrifusion technology. By scanning barcodes on the capsules, the machine ensures precision brewing. I tested several sizes: espresso (1.35 oz.), a double espresso (2.7 oz.), and even iced coffee by pouring a 14 oz. Alto brew over ice. Each serving had consistent flavor, heat, and, dare I say, café-standard quality. The crema—oh, the creamy, velvety layer that topped every cup—was immaculate. 

The 15-second heat-up time shocked someone as impatient as me. I barely had time to rinse a cup before the Breville Vertuo had my java steaming and ready. The automatic shut-off after nine minutes was another highlight since forgetting to turn off appliances after rushing out the door has plagued me multiple times.

### **Included Extras**

Inside the box, the Nespresso Vertuo machine also greeted me with a capsule welcome kit containing 12 differently profiled coffee capsules. This thoughtful addition gave me a crash course in flavor exploration. My personal favorite? The dark roast with hints of caramel that paired perfectly with my breakfasts. If you're someone who loves variety but hates making decisions early in the morning, this feature is perfect.

### **Highlights**

- **Versatile brewing sizes:** From a quick espresso shot to a larger-than-life 14 oz. Alto, this machine truly caters to everyone’s personalized caffeine needs.  
- **Innovative technology:** Centrifusion brewing guarantees consistent, high-quality coffee or espresso with minimal effort.  
- **Convenient water tank:** The removable tank simplifies morning refills, reducing prep time.  
- **Energy efficiency:** Automatic shut-off feature saves energy when idle for over nine minutes.  

### **Critiques**

Even with its outstanding performance, there are areas that could see improvement:  

- **Capsule limitation:** Exclusivity to Nespresso Vertuo capsules could feel restrictive for some coffee aficionados who prefer blending their own grinds or exploring third-party capsules.  
- **Noisy operation:** While the brewing process is exceptionally efficient, it can get slightly loud—a minor inconvenience when brewing early in the morning.  
- **Non-renewable capsules:** Environmentally-conscious users might feel deterred unless recycling programs can be seamlessly accessed.  

### **Competing Products**

Comparing this to other single-serve brewers, like the Keurig K-Supreme, the Breville Vertuo excels in delivering premium espresso-like brews, whereas the Keurig focuses heavily on versatility with ground coffee and pod options. For those who prioritize strong, café-style quality, the Breville machine triumphs. However, people looking for reusable filter compatibility might lean toward something like the Ninja CP307, which accommodates both loose grounds and pods.

The Vertuo’s design and Centrifusion technology, paired with its crema-producing skills, do outshine many rival products, but its exclusivity to Nespresso capsules narrows its audience. That said, when you’re invested in flavor precision and ease of use, it makes a strong case.

### **Bang for the Buck**

While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, the features align perfectly with what you’d expect from a slightly premium-priced machine. Automatic brewing, flavor precision, and durable build quality definitely justify the cost for someone who wants superior home-brewed coffee or espresso without heading to a café. I also appreciated its Amazon Renewed certification—an initiative that ensures impeccable testing and refurbishment.

1mvlki0,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalaffair/comments/1mvlki0/fiance_cheated_with_coworker/,Fiance cheated with coworker,"i found out my fiance (26M) cheated on me with a coworker.

he started acting really mean and resentful out of nowhere. he would pick fights with me, say i’m not supportive and that he can’t wait to get out. when we would talk about it the next day, he would say it’s his drinking and he was drunk and he didn’t mean any of it.

we were at a concert one night and i saw a snapchat from a girl. i asked him who it is and he said it’s my coworker and started gaslighting me when i said i feel uncomfortable that he has an 8 day streak with a female coworker who he has never mentioned to me. he said i am psychotic and am i really that stupid to think he would throw away his career and our relationship by doing anything with a coworker

fast forward to a few days later. i get the gut feeling to check his ipad. that’s when i find out that he has gotten drinks alone with this coworker twice (while he lied to me and said he was with a client). we both work in the finance industry but at different firms and our jobs require a lot of after work entertaining like client dinners, drinks, etc.

i saw him bragging to one of his male coworkers saying that his drinks with her went way too well and when the guy asked how the elephant in the room went (meaning our engagement) my fiance responded that he made it worse

he came home and i took his phone and went on his snapchat and saw he sent her a snap that said “you made me super horny somehow” and “it made my night” and she responded saying “on a serious note u can’t have both”

after seeing that i broke down and he tried to gaslight me saying she sent him a photo of food and he was making a joke saying the food made him horny (lol)

i don’t trust him to tell me the truth so i contacted his coworker and that made him freak out. i texted her and asked what happened. she said the extent of it has been flirting for about two weeks (yes this is how quickly this escalated in a matter of 2 weeks)

from her, i found out the truth. she said she didn’t know that i exist until she followed his instagram and saw that we were engaged. when she asked him about me, he told her things weren’t going well. he lied and told her we don’t have a date set or anything planned (he was saying these things to her while on the same day talking to our wedding planner and photographer). when they got drinks for the first time, he told her it was the first semblance of happiness he has had in months and he was texting me at the same time saying he can’t wait to marry me and that i’m the love of his life. i also went through his bloomberg work chats and saw how he would talk to her all day everyday, he would ask her to get coffee with him, lunch with him, etc

the day i found out is the day things became sexual between them. they got drinks after work and then he said they should share an uber since they were headed in the same direction. in the car, he said to her that they flirt a lot and he thinks they have sexual tension then when she agreed, he asked her if she has thought about fucking him. she said i’ve masturbated to the thought of it. the below quote is what she texted me about the car ride

“In the car he never asked outright if he could kiss me but heavily insinuated at it and I said that there was a hard line for me as long as you were still together. He had said that in his mind he had already crossed the line so what difference does this make. I said no and that it made a difference to me. As he left the car he hugged me grabbed my knee and then kissed me on the cheek. “

he got dropped off before her and after going inside the restaurant, is when he snapchatted her and told her she made him super horny somehow

i don’t know if i should believe her that they didn’t kiss. i guess it doesn’t really matter because either way he was the one who initiated this, pursued her and pushed her boundaries

after i found out i was completely done. but now i feel like i am trying to stay with him and i feel pathetic. he has been doing individual therapy and has been doing couples therapy with me. the therapist thinks that this was a case of letting boundaries slip and that my fiance made a mistake. and i want to believe him. but i dont think i can ever let this go

i dont know if i can ever forgive him for doing this to me. there was no reason for him to cheat. we were happy, planning our wedding, and some random girl showed slight interest in him and that’s all it took. not only did he ruin our relationship but she could get him fired at a moments notice for sexual harassment

he claims he loves me and that it was a stupid mistake. but i dont know what to believe",4,1755711393.0,emotionalaffair,7,1.0,False

1mvlgtu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYTools/comments/1mvlgtu/does_the_amartisan_10piece_screwdrivers_set_offer/,Does the Amartisan 10-Piece Screwdrivers Set Offer Quality and Durability? Review Inside!,"The **Amartisan wwer 10-Piece Magnetic Screwdriver Set** has been a surprising addition to my tools, and after weeks of daily use, I feel like I’ve tested every promise it makes. It's evident that this screwdriver set was designed with practicality in mind, but there are definitely some trade-offs to consider before committing. With features like magnetic tips, a variety of sizes, and durable materials, it earns its spot as one of the more talked-about toolkits in its category. That said, it’s not without its quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**

The vibrant yellow and black color scheme makes these screwdrivers easy to spot in a cluttered toolbox or workbench, which is a huge plus for someone as disorganized as me. The handles are crafted with cushion grips, likely made from ergonomic TPR material, and they truly feel as comfortable as they look. After several hours of assembling shelves, my hands didn’t feel fatigued, which speaks volumes about the design.

The magnetic tips on the blades are genuinely convenient, especially for someone like me who constantly drops screws in the most unreachable corners of the house. The magnet strength is just right—not too strong to misalign screws, but enough to keep them securely attached mid-use. Each blade is made from chromium vanadium steel, which so far hasn’t shown any signs of wear despite some heavy use. I even took on a rusted outdoor fixture to test its durability, and the screwdrivers held up well.

**Ease of Use**

This set includes ten screwdrivers—five Phillips head and five slotted tips—of various sizes. I love that variety because it means I’m always ready for different tasks, from tightening cabinet doors to messing around inside my kid's battery-operated toys. The cushion grip truly does enhance control, and even my skeptical coworker, who borrowed the set to adjust some screws in his office chair, mentioned how comfortable they felt.

The screwdrivers also come in a clear storage case, which ensures they don’t scatter all over the place. While the included case is handy, it feels a bit flimsy. I wouldn’t trust it to survive a tumble off a ladder, and I’d be cautious about over-relying on it for long-term storage.

[Check Amartisan wwer price on Amazon.](https://toolhandle.com/p/b07rfd9jwz/)

**Highlights**

- Magnetic tips offer excellent screw retention.
- Cushioned ergonomic handles provide comfort during long tasks.
- Chromium vanadium steel ensures durability and wear resistance.
- Convenient size variety (5 Phillips head and 5 slotted tips) for versatile use.
- Compact storage case helps keep the set organized.

**Caveats**

- The storage case feels fragile and could be better-designed.
- Magnetic strength, while useful, may not satisfy those needing ultra-strong magnets.
- Handle material can attract dust and grime after extended periods in a garage setting.

**Performance and Versatility**

The performance of this screwdriver set is where it mostly shines. Whether I was working on electric outlets or my beloved coffee table (which needed serious fixing), it delivered consistent results. The variety in tip sizes meant I rarely reached for another tool, which is a huge time-saver. While the screwdrivers excel at indoor tasks, I did notice some slight slippage on outdoor screws, but that’s more about screw quality than the tools themselves.

A neat additional feature is the inclusion of two portable key screwdrivers, one flathead and one Phillips. I keep these on my keyring, and they’re perfect for quick fixes on the go. Considering their small size, I didn’t expect much, but they’ve turned out to be incredibly handy when dealing with small screws in eyeglasses or gadgets.

**Peer Products**

When compared with other magnetic screwdriver sets like the Craftsman Extreme Grip or the Klein Tools Kraftform series, this set holds its ground in some respects while falling short in others. For instance, I found the Amartisan set’s cushions comfier than the Craftsman’s harder grip. However, the storage case of the Klein Tools set feels a lot sturdier in comparison.

The magnetic tips on Craftman’s screwdrivers felt just slightly stronger during tests, making them better suited for professionals working with precision tasks. That said, the Amartisan set has more variety in screwdriver sizes, which I needed during a home DIY project involving both tiny screws and larger bolts. Between price and feature sets, this Amartisan offers a more accessible toolkit for casual users than some pricier options.

**Price Performance**

For its price range, this set provides substantial value. While it might not compete with professional-grade screwdriver kits, its affordability, ease of use, and thoughtful design firmly place it in the sweet spot for most household tasks. The magnetic feature could easily justify the investment for anyone dealing with fiddly screws regularly. If you’re someone who likes to tinker, this set will likely deliver—without emptying your wallet.

1mvldbb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mvldbb,AIO? Friend keeps switching locations while I am on my way to pick her up,"AIO? Last Tuesday I went to go pick up a friend I haven't seen in a few weeks to get coffee. The weather was miserable that day so I offered her a ride. She gave me the address and I told her 15 min at most.

Driving in the city we are in during bad weather is really hazardous because of the aggressive behaviors, roads are in bad condition, etc. My friend knows this because I've given her rides before. She knows I don't really look at my phone while I drive and I usually try to pull over if I have to fiddle with the GPS. She herself doesn't own a car but knows how to drive.

So I go to pick her up and I notice she switched locations. States it's just 2 min walking distance, fine, I pull over to loom at the map and I figure I could just keep going where I was heading because it was indeed right around the corner.

Then I arrive and she says she went somewhere else. I find this really rude and inconsiderate, call her out om it. She has told me before I can be blunt with her if she is behaving like this. Well, I guess that was a lie. I have no idea where the Ulta is and given it was in a congested, pedestrian heavy area and about to rain, I was frustrated because those factors make renavigating difficult. I felt she should've helped me help her by staying in one spot instead of flitting between places I have to now figure out how to navigate to. After all, I was kind enough to offer a ride.

This also isn't the first time she has done something like this. One time she asked me to pick her up on a side street while she was actively walking with someone. I was peeved then - like how am I supposed to find you while you're moving??? - but I kept my mouth shut. But that plus this is why I felt compelled to speak up this time.

I do feel my response was measured and that her behavior, no matter how you spin it, was rude, as is her response. It's been a week and no reply from her, nothing. I find it silly to end a friendship over such a thing, but I also don't want to reach back out because I believe she needs to apologize and if I reach out I'm implying she did no wrong (which could be a construction my brain made up for me). I don't want this friendship to fizz out like this. AIO? Idk how to even proceed, or if I should even keep her as a friend if this is her true self. I've known her for years but
got a lot closer this past year. She was my ride and die.",8,1755710968.0,AmIOverreacting,43,0.9,False

While hanging out with her friend, the kid got a hold of her friend's bag, and managed to swipe a keychain from off it. Its a keychain that's made from one of those personalized couples necklaces. She's had it for years, but when my friend found out from her kid, while she was on the phone with me she wanted to just throw it away, so she wouldn't have to apologize. She and I met up for coffee, and somehow it ended up in my bag. I didn't take it, I was looking for my keys and it was just in my bag. I called her about it, and she told me to just toss it.

I'm thinking of returning it to the girl. Its not like we haven't met. I used to go to school there too. We're just not friends. I was thinking of just walking up to her in the library and saying ""I think you dropped this."" or something.

Would I be the asshole for not doing what she wanted and just tossing it and just returning it? Seems kind of sad for the girl to lose something because her friend doesn't want to apologize.

Strict diets? I always ended up binging because I missed my favorite foods. Calorie counting? Way too time-consuming and I always end up not sticking to it.

So I gave up for a while. But recently I stumbled onto something simpler, I just started swapping out a few things I eat every day.

Not huge changes. Not cutting entire food groups. Just replacing one version with another.

Example:

* My daily café latte became a homemade coffee with frothed milk → tastes almost the same, but I save \~150 calories.
* My morning bagel turned into a greek yogurt with almonds → same calories, but with +14g protein.
* My go-to bag of chips turned into air-popped popcorn with seasoning → saves \~200 calories.

The good thing? I didn’t feel like I was dieting at all. I wasn’t “restricting”.

1mvl9r2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mvl9r2/rf_the_undertaker_and_the_whore/,[RF] The Undertaker and the Whore,"The undertaker lived three streets over from the freight yard, in a one story house, and he never locked the door and everyone thought it was because no one would steal from a man who dressed the dead. The truth was, he’d lost the key sometime in ’88 and never thought to have another cut.

His name was Warren and everyone called him Mr. Crane. He owned two suits, both black, and one hat that kept its shape no matter how it rained. The suit he wore for work had a faint smell of formaldehyde. The other was for town meetings, which he attended, but rarely ever spoke.

The whore’s name was Alma. She had come from somewhere west, way past Nevada. The men who saw her said she charged a flat rate and never haggled. She kept a room above the laundromat with a view of the bus depot, and her curtains were always closed, even in summer.

They met on a Sunday morning when the streets were empty. Alma was walking with her shoes in her hand, a cigarette behind her ear. Warren was on his way back from the river, carrying a box with two dead pigeons inside. He had found them near the bank, their feathers wet and pressed flat. They stopped where the sidewalk buckled over the roots of an elm. She asked what was in the box. He said, just a pair of birds. She asked if he planned to bury them, and he said yes.

After that, she came to his house on Tuesdays. Sometimes she stayed an hour, sometimes half the night. She never asked for money, they didn’t touch much. Mostly they sat at the kitchen table and drank coffee. Once she brought him a deck of cards with the corners worn round and they played rummy until the lamp burned out.

The town took notice, though no one spoke to them about it. Men at the feed store said it was unnatural, women at the diner said it was a shame, and the sheriff said nothing but tapped the side of his badge when her name came up.

In March, a boy was found dead behind the school. No one knew his name. He had no wallet, no shoes. Warren was called to take the body. Alma came that night and sat with Warren while he worked. She smoked two cigarettes without speaking, then asked if he wanted help. He told her no, though later he handed her a small tin of oil and asked her to shine the boy’s shoes, and she did.

By April, Alma stopped coming on Tuesdays. Warren walked past the laundromat once and saw the upstairs window open and the curtains were gone.

Summer came in dry and stayed that way. The undertaker took fewer jobs, people were living longer that year, someone said. The boy from March had been buried without a stone. Warren had kept the tin of oil, sitting on the shelf by the back door.

One night in late August, Warren woke to the sound of someone knocking. When he opened the door, Alma stood there barefoot, her dress torn at the hem. She said she was only passing through. He offered coffee, but she refused. They stood in the doorway until the streetlight clicked off. She told him she had been to Alaska and back, but she failed to say why. She said she had something for him and placed a folded slip of paper in his palm, told him not to open it now.

She left before the sun came up. He watched her walk until she was gone past the bend. The paper stayed folded on the table for three days. When he finally opened it, there was only a short list written in block letters:

Elm tree

Tin of oil

Boy’s shoes

He put the paper in the box with the pigeons’ bones.

No one ever saw Alma again.

The undertaker lived another nine years. When they cleared his house, they found the box in the back of the closet. Inside, the bones were still clean, and the paper was still folded.

I then got a small plug that will track voltage so i can see it fluctuate over time and found that every day the voltage from ComEd is dipping below the legally mandated 113V minimum.

This whole world is new to me - I wouldn’t have noticed or thought to care if I didn’t happen to be using an appliance that’s more sensitive to voltage fluctuations.  Now I’m concerned not only for my coffee roasting but also for what these kinds of fluctuations could do to other more critical (and expensive) things I have plugged in.

1mvl8dp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCRawData/comments/1mvl8dp/evaluate_the_hp_14_chromebook_laptop_is_it_built/,Evaluate the HP 14 Chromebook Laptop Is It Built for Students,"**An Everyday Companion: My Honest Take on HP HP 14 HD Chromebook**  

Having spent a couple of weeks actively using the HP HP 14 HD Chromebook for work and leisure, I must say, it's a device that strikes a delicate balance between functionality and simplicity. Whether juggling multiple Chrome browser tabs, video calling on Zoom, or streaming Netflix for late-night marathons, it holds its own surprisingly well. However, there are a few quirks that might leave you pondering if it's the perfect fit for your unique tech needs.

**Portability and Build Quality**  
I was pleasantly surprised by how lightweight this Chromebook feels. Weighing just around 0.634 ounces and measuring 12.85 x 8.94 x 0.72 inches, slipping it into my backpack was a breeze. The sleek black finish has a modern vibe, though it does smudge easily, which is a bit of a bummer if you're fussy about aesthetics. The build quality feels durable enough but maybe not designed for heavy-handed treatment. It’s great for students, commuters, or anyone on the move, but might lack the premium feel some people crave in their devices.  

**Display Performance**  
The 14-inch HD display, boasting a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels, gets the job done. Watching YouTube videos or even casual photo editing feels decent with the sharp and vibrant screen quality. The anti-glare finish was a lifesaver during sunny coffee-shop afternoons, though the resolution might feel a little underwhelming for anyone used to Full HD or higher. For someone like me, who spends hours reading and writing content, it’s comfortable for the eyes, but serious gamers or multimedia professionals might feel a tad constrained.

**Check [HP HP 14 Chromebook] price on Amazon.**  

**Battery Life That Runs the Marathon**  
The advertised 14-hour battery life is no exaggeration. Over a week of extended use, I consistently managed a full day's work with plenty of juice left for watching a couple of series episodes before bed. Whether it was editing documents in Google Docs or having a marathon Zoom meeting, the efficiency of its battery was truly impressive. However, the lack of fast charging had me feeling impatient when needing a quick top-up.

**Merits**  
- Lightweight and portable design makes it perfect for travel and students.  
- Strong battery life ensures it keeps up with long workloads or study sessions.  
- The 14-inch micro-edge, anti-glare HD display is easy on the eyes for extended viewing.  
- Chrome OS provides simplicity while offering access to thousands of apps from the Play Store for a versatile experience.  

**Performance Under Pressure**  
This Chromebook sports an Intel Celeron N4120 processor with four cores, paired with 4GB of DDR4 RAM and 64GB eMMC storage. It’s by no means a powerhouse, but for light multitasking, streaming, or browsing, it’s impressively smooth. Thanks to Chrome OS, startup is fast, and the system remains responsive even with multiple tabs open. That said, the limited RAM becomes noticeable with resource-heavy applications or tasks requiring significant computing heft, such as video editing.

The built-in Intel UHD Graphics 600 is adequate for casual streaming or light graphic workloads but nowhere near what you’d need for high-end gaming or detailed design work. You’ll find it passes for productivity tasks but doesn't shine in more demanding situations.  

**Minus Points**  
- Limited RAM makes handling heavy multitasking a challenge at times.  
- The resolution isn’t ideal for users accustomed to finer display details.  
- No fast charging means you’re stuck waiting when the battery runs out at inconvenient moments.  

**Connectivity and Ports**  
I appreciated the range of ports included in this Chromebook: two USB 3.0 Type-A ports, a USB 3.0 Type-C port, an HDMI port, and a headphone jack. Whether connecting to an external monitor or plugging in my USB drive, everything worked smoothly. It ticks most of the boxes for a functional laptop, though an SD card reader could have been a nice touch for photographers like me.

**Other Competing Brands**  
In comparison to similarly priced Chromebooks like the Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 and ASUS Chromebook Flip C434, this HP model carves out its niche. The Lenovo stands out with its convertible 2-in-1 design, and the ASUS offers a superior 1080p touchscreen display with a more polished build. Both competitors slightly outshine it in terms of performance and display clarity. However, the HP HP 14 HD Chromebook leaps ahead in battery life and price efficiency, which are significant wins for students or simple day-to-day users.  

**Price Worthiness**  
Given its capabilities, the HP HP 14 HD Chromebook offers great budget-friendly value for those entering the world of Chromebooks. The reliable battery life and lightweight design make it worth the price for everyday tasks without dropping a fortune on features you might not need. Though the features come with their limitations, I’d say it’s a solid investment if you require a Chromebook for casual use, and Chrome OS adds immense ease of operation to the mix.

1mvl01u,https://www.reddit.com/r/GirlProblems/comments/1mvl01u/extreme_body_odor/,Extreme Body Odor,"Hello everyone.
I just need to rant and also ask for advice regarding my body odor—at this point I think it’s already baktol. I’ve been suffering from this for years now.

I’m 26, female, 115kg, obese, very sweaty, with an oily scalp and face. Here’s my weekly hygiene routine:

Body and hair scrub: 3x a week

Olay Niacinamide & Peptide soap: 5x a week

Safeguard soap: 2x a week

Palmolive or Sunsilk shampoo (only options available): daily

Creamsilk conditioner: 1–2x a week

Deodorant: alternating between Milku and Rexona


I really do my best to stay clean, but I’ve realized through trial and error that the problem might be internal. On the outside, I keep myself clean, but still—my clothes somehow hold onto the odor. No matter how many times I wash them, even with detergent, Downy, warm water, or even Zonrox, the smell just sticks. I declutter my closet yearly, but my clothes still end up smelling bad. The only solution that somewhat works is sending them to a laundry shop.

My diet is mostly rice, vegetables, chicken, eggs, and coffee. I’m not into snacks, processed foods, or sugary drinks. I’ve also tried apple cider vinegar capsules, glutathione, and even fasting—but nothing seems to work.

I’ve noticed that even small scratches (like from a cat) heal very slowly, turn into scars, and take forever to fade. That makes me feel like something’s really wrong inside my body, and it might also be linked to my odor problem.

Honestly, I feel like my body odor is getting worse and worse. I don’t really have the budget for checkups, and I’m also scared of going to clinics or doctors. I just needed to let this out.

As a coffee enthusiast who values convenience (but refuses to compromise on taste), this sleek black coffee maker with chrome accents caught my eye. Since I tested this beauty from day one, it’s seen me through groggy Monday mornings and lazy Sunday brunches. Let’s dive into the details.

**Modern Design Meets Practicality**

From the moment I unboxed the coffee maker, its modern style had me hooked. The metallic exterior complements my mostly stainless steel kitchen appliances, and it's surprisingly compact given its capabilities. Measuring 8.19 x 11.03 x 15.15 inches, it fits snugly in my little countertop corner. One major draw for me? There's no fragile carafe to worry about! Coffee is brewed directly into an internal tank instead, making spills and cracked carafes a thing of the past.

[Check Hamilton Beach 48465 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b001k66lpq/)

**Fuss-Free Brewing Features**

This kitchen gadget isn’t just about looking sharp; it works efficiently too. The fully automatic operation lets me set the programmable clock up to 24 hours ahead. I’ll admit, waking up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee is borderline magical. Plus, the brew strength selector offers options for bold, regular, small batches, and iced coffee – which is a personal game-changer for hot summer mornings. The buttons on the control panel feel tactile yet intuitive, and the blue-backlit screen is easy to read in my dimly lit kitchen.

**FRESH Coffee… Literally**

The standout feature is the internal heater that keeps coffee fresh and warm for hours. Unlike traditional coffee makers where hot plates scorch the coffee, this machine ensures my second or third cup tastes as good as the first. The dispensing bar is another win; no drippy messes while pouring coffee into my mug. On busy days, I’ve literally filled a travel mug in under 15 seconds.

**Advantages**

- Keeps coffee fresh for up to 4 hours.  
- No carafe means zero risk of breakage or spillage.  
- Brew strength settings offer versatile options.  
- Sleek and compact design fits most kitchens.  

**Potential Drawbacks**

- The removable internal tank does require frequent cleaning to avoid stale odors.  
- It only brews into the internal reservoir, so no direct brewing into oversized travel mugs.  
- There’s a bit of a learning curve getting used to the one-press dispensing system.

**Using It Daily**

It’s become a family favorite during holidays. My sister, an iced coffee connoisseur, loved the fact that she could brew directly for chilled beverages without needing a fancy cold brew setup. The programmable auto-shutoff feature saved my partner some undue stress when rushing out of the house, knowing the machine wouldn’t stay on endlessly.

**Competing Products**

When exploring alternatives, the Cuisinart DCC-3200 and Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista come to mind. Although both bring solid features to the table, the Cuisinart has a traditional carafe, which I find less convenient for multi-cup drinkers like myself. Meanwhile, Mr. Coffee's model focuses on espresso drinks, making it less versatile in the brewing options department compared to this coffee maker. Where the Hamilton Beach coffee maker shines is in its no-carafe innovation and impeccable iced coffee brewing settings – a rarity in this price range.

**Worth Every Penny**

Considering its thoughtful design and robust functionality, the price feels fair for what you’re getting. While competitor models might edge it out slightly in certain areas, they can’t quite match the unique reservoir brewing system or the convenience of no-spill dispensing. If consistency and ease of use are high on your list, this product delivers on both counts.

[DeLonghi Dedica EC 685],"I've recently got myself a used older-generation DeLonghi Dedica EC685 (the leakage was fixed) and tried pulling shots with the included double pressurized basket, but the coffee tastes awfully bitter. I set the machine to medium temperature (also tried low), and then I set the brewing ratio to 1:2, with 14g in and 28g out. I've also tried different ratios—14g in but less than 28g out—but that didn't help either. Tamping or not tamping didn't make a difference.

At first I thought it might be the coffee, which had been sitting in my drawer for half a year, but then I bought some new pre-ground coffee from the grocery store, and the results were the same. Yesterday I even went to a specialty coffee shop to try what a real espresso tastes like, and that was really tasty, flavorful, and not bitter at all.

I don't really know what the issue is, and I've searched the whole internet for advice, but there isn’t much information about dialing in pressurized baskets. Is the coffee really the problem, and should I buy some freshly ground specialty coffee from a coffee shop, or am I doing something wrong?

Later I'm planning on switching to an open portafilter, but for now I just want a reasonably good espresso without any fancy grinders and lots of preparation. Does anyone have any guess what could be the issue? Thank you!",0,1755709727.0,espresso,3,0.5,False

Been dealing with hypertension and elevated heart rate for about 4 years. Been on 100 mg metoprolol 1x daily since diagnosis which has kept me around 130/80 at most pretty consistently, with a resting heart rate of 65 or so. I've been great about limiting caffeine to a cup a day , sometimes none at all. Since Saturday I have been absolutely drained for no apparent reason. I feel fine, sleeping more than normal, so have been drinking more caffeine that I typically do. Like an iced coffee in the morning and Diet Coke in the afternoon. It's keeping me going but I'm still napping every afternoon for about 20 minutes and sleeping on average 7½ hrs a night. This is better than normal for me, I am typically a terrible sleeper and generally average 5-6 hours a night. I noticed yesterday on my Apple watch my resting heart rate was 52. Much lower than normal for me. I don't generally look at the numbers that close unless I'm working out, which admittedly does not happen often. I looked back at my current heart rate trends for the last week and it has been hovering between 45 and 70 most days/nights since Saturday. I also deal with anxiety which when I get worked up is a guarantee my heart rate will spike to 90's-100. Even after getting anxious about this my heart rate barely went over 60. When I checked my BP multiple times last night I kept getting a reading of around 150/90 which seems so odd with the low heart rate. Anyone have any ideas on possible causes and if I should be getting this checked? Like I said, I feel fine just really tired. Not losing weight either, just to get that out there. I know sudden weight loss could be indicator of serious underlying conditions. Not the case for me.

My 30th birthday is coming up this week and my mom has chosen to ignore it. She has historically been lame at celebrating birthdays. For my 16th she took a picture of the cake ingredients and that was it. She thought it would be funny, but it really hurt my feelings. No celebration, no presents, no cake, nothing. Since then, she's pretty much ignored my birthday. I always go out of my way to make her birthday special, with gifts and a nice dinner. It's very important to me that the people around me feel valued, especially on their birthdays.

Anyway, this year she flat out told me not to expect anything. She said she won't have any money, and that she's not a present person anyway. I have a dinner planned with a couple friends, but I can't help being hurt by my mom's complete lack of interest. She could make me a card, a cup of coffee, anything and I would be so incredibly touched. I asked if she would go to a bakery with me and that could be the present, just spending time with me, she wouldn't have to spend any money. She said it's too far away ( we live in the same town and she wouldn't have to drive) and that she wants to do her own thing on her day's off. I know having high expectations on your birthday as an adult is silly, but I feel like asking for her to spend a little time with me isn't a unrealistic expectation. It doesn't even have to be on the actual day of my birthday. Am I overreacting?",3,1755709587.0,AmIOverreacting,11,1.0,False
1mvkpdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1mvkpdu/meditations_on_a_beach/,Meditations on a beach.,"As I walk along the beach I remember all the men I've been in all spaces of time. Each grain of sand could not contain each possibility to be. Every moment of experience piles up like the sand. The waves wash on the grains of the beach, forgetting, slipping, but purifying and soothing me all the same with cool water. ""Such is the mercy of God"", I say ""to act like the Devil so we're less shy"". He bathes my anger, takes it all away so I may rest, yet I resent him. I wish I had both worlds, but I wish I didn't have to lose them either. Such is the selfishness of man, to want nothing and everything. How arrogant I've grown by being, by the sand. But the cool water washes me off anyways. 

Though imperfect in my experiences the beach still holds me, it calculates my weight in the sand and the tidings and every little thing. The beach is quiet in how its alive, the seagulls squawk their caw of the sidestep of existence, the runoff of the flap of wings, yet you swear you can hear him contemplating. The beach is alive, meditative. The moon is shining so bright and white and divine...it bathes me in the simple beauty of the impossibility of the moment, of the beauty of beauty, of every rudimentary stroke, of every breath, every step, every flap; of every second. It's being. It could almost dissolve like the foam. Every division is a human, compulsive need to understand that begets inutition and weight and experience, yet we try to calculate it and to make it make sense. But how could it? 

The impossibility of the moment, the gargantuan nature of time, of simple eternity that does not care about human pursuits; it just doesn't make sense. Tonight I wonder if it were ever supposed to, if it ever could and if it were for us to. Fuck.. We have to make it so. We do science like we bang on rocks, and in the pursuit of progress I wonder that if to know ends wonder and God, if we'd never gaze at the night sky to imagine and cry ever again. But perhaps we would this time too, but with rememberance and understanding, with the weight of existence and the knowledge and the means... That instead of gazing at the future and making sense of this old present, we'd gaze at the past and make sense of that present. We are still human. In both worlds, we are arrested in tears.

And time fizzles, forgets itself and dissolves. So do I. Human pursuits were never to match nature's time.

For a moment I experience it all. I didn't need to expand consciousness; I simply needed to break it. I stand in a full view; waves, sand, moonlight and trees; love, sadness, fear and peace. I hold it all. And the peace is abounding tonight, against the tapestry where I remember that I forget.

I meet God here, though I sometimes wonder if he exists. It's the closest I get to a creator. This is not the Garden of Eden, it's not even heaven on Earth. It's the quietest corners of what it means to be human, of the world in the faded, but most real and intense lines; the brown lines of your morning coffee worn out in the edges of the cup, time marching, the coffee slowly leaving your system. By night it's gone. And you're alone. It will be morning again soon. The cycle continues. The ocean is here to hold you, the salt to dry your tears. Oh, the mercy of forgetting, and the care and tenderness of the acceptance of burning loss. ""You are human, do not forget that"", said like a lover. ""Yet I will dry your eyes.""

""I am the intermidiary, and you must go on"", says the beach, the leaves of the palm trees swaying in the wind. ""You must"", spoken unshaken"". Or else it would not be, there is no other way.""

""The alternative is to have never."" 

A meditation of morality, of what it means to be confronted, faced in forever. A feeling of existence and what it means. Ah... I simplify things. Perhaps you're not eternal but on this beach, to me, in this moment, this is forever. It both is and I make it so. It's mine, anyways. I only ever have the present. I could scream, and indeed I do, but instead I sob. Perhaps on a different night. The beach willl always be here, though we both change. I end it with a soft smile. How strange of forever to last this short. 

I sit down, I stoke the fire a little longer. In a moment the sun will rise. Forever will persist, and yet it is cut short. The beach is the inbetween of God and man, where there all things human reside and become holy for a moment. And holiness is the absolution of sin. Sin is a prerequisite; we are transformation, change. And here, in the inbetween, it's hard to tell where we begins and ends. That's what it means to be human, I think. At least on one side. To be muddled beyond repair and yet to yearn, and yet to accept the rough edges in such moments on the beach. To be imperfect. 

The fire exhales shakily, it coaxes out a resounding breath of me, one of,

A sigh. Time divides. I become another grain of sand.

1mvkoho,https://www.reddit.com/r/rarelightmare/comments/1mvkoho/socialism_as_smokescreen_how_a_scare_word/,Socialism as Smokescreen: How a Scare Word Protects Predatory Capitalism,"
For generations, American politicians and industry allies have wielded “socialism” as a scare word to stop policies that protect workers and families. The label is not a description; it is a weapon. It has been deployed against unions, universal healthcare, childcare, housing supports, industrial policy, antitrust enforcement, and progressive taxation. The outcome is not the prevention of socialism but the consolidation of a predatory form of free‑market capitalism that deregulates, suppresses wages, outsources jobs, privatizes public goods, and socializes risk for the wealthy while privatizing risk for everyone else. The scare word functions as a branding exercise that cloaks upward redistribution.

The tactic follows a clear playbook. First, rebrand mainstream social protections as “socialism.” Second, cast these protections as existential threats to freedom or the market. Third, pass policies that strip bargaining power from workers and empower corporations and financiers. Fourth, when communities fracture under job loss, medical debt, and punitive social policy, blame the victims. The word “socialism” is the emotional trigger that keeps this machine intact.

Healthcare offers a definitive case study. For nearly a century, national health insurance proposals were demolished by campaigns branding them “socialized medicine.” The American Medical Association’s mid‑century offensives, aided by celebrity surrogates, framed public insurance as a step toward tyranny. The result was not freer markets, but a uniquely expensive and exclusionary system dominated by private intermediaries, with some of the world’s highest prices, chronic underinsurance, medical bankruptcies, and uneven access. Corporate profits were protected; families paid in premiums, deductibles, and foregone care. The scare word delivered the market power it promised to protect.

The labor story is the same. Unions—voluntary, democratic associations that bargain for wages, safety, and benefits—were smeared as socialist beachheads. That stigma greased the rails for right‑to‑work laws, weak labor enforcement, corporate union‑avoidance campaigns, and courts hostile to collective action. As union density collapsed, wage growth decoupled from productivity and inequality widened. That is not an apolitical market equilibrium; it is the predictable outcome of policy choices sold with anti‑socialist rhetoric that muted the one countervailing force capable of restoring balance.

Globalization translated the rhetoric into a global extraction strategy. While railing against “socialism” at home, U.S. elites deepened integration with low‑wage export platforms—most notably a Communist Party–led China. The policy logic was simple: liberalize trade and capital flows without enforceable labor standards, then let lead firms arbitrage the gap between pennies‑on‑the‑dollar factory wages abroad and high retail prices at home. Communities in the Midwest and South lost millions of manufacturing jobs; overseas workers were pulled into hyper‑competitive supplier chains with weak protections. The gains were captured by brand owners, shareholders, and executives who laundered the arrangement as “free trade.” The same scare word that blocked industrial policy and labor standards at home made this bargain politically survivable.

Deregulation and financialization did the rest. Antitrust enforcement withered as dominant firms consolidated markets. Shareholder‑value doctrines encouraged offshoring, wage suppression, stock buybacks, and tax arbitrage. Effective tax rates on the wealthiest fell; profits were shifted to havens; estate taxes were hollowed out. The result was a billionaire class built on the spread between labor’s shrinking share and capital’s expanding claims. Again, “socialism” served as the foil: any effort to tax wealth, curb buybacks, empower workers, or set industrial strategy was cast as socialist overreach—even as corporate welfare, no‑bid contracts, and bailouts flourished. The state did not retreat; it simply picked different beneficiaries.

Here is the essential distinction the scare word tries to erase. The democratic social policies demonized as “socialist” in the United States—universal healthcare, public schools, paid leave, robust unions, industrial policy, progressive taxation—are social‑democratic tools that coexist with private enterprise and competitive markets. They aim to deconcentrate power, stabilize family incomes, and give ordinary people real freedom in the marketplace. They bear no resemblance to the authoritarian projects often invoked as cautionary tales. Nazi “National Socialism” was fascism: it crushed independent unions and left parties, collaborated with big business, privatized assets, and built a racialized war economy. The Soviet model was a top‑down command state without civil liberties or democratic worker control—antithetical to the ideal of worker empowerment. Conflating democratic social policy with Nazism or the USSR is a propaganda move designed to block pro‑worker policy, not a serious argument. The reality is that many of the most successful capitalist democracies—Germany, Canada, Sweden—use public healthcare, collective bargaining, and industrial strategy to make markets fairer and more productive. That is not authoritarianism; it is democratic governance.

The human costs of the scare‑word regime are visible in the data and on the ground. Regions exposed to import shocks suffered lower employment, depressed wages, reduced labor‑force participation, higher disability claims, and social dislocation. Families lost health coverage with their jobs and faced bankruptcy from illness. Drug crises fed on economic abandonment and were met with policing and prisons rather than treatment and jobs. Meanwhile, global supply chains routinely produced labor abuses, wage theft, and deadly factory disasters under relentless price pressure from brand purchasing practices demanding ever‑lower costs and faster turnaround. The same political class that labeled paid leave, universal healthcare, or stronger unions as “socialism” oversaw this order and cashed the checks.

Strip away the branding and the pattern is straightforward. Calling stabilizing, pro‑family policies “socialist” clears a path for deregulation and corporate consolidation. That consolidation generates profit by squeezing labor at home and abroad. Those profits are defended by the same rhetoric that midwifed them, and the resulting wealth is fortified through tax and corporate law. The boogeyman is not an analysis; it is a cover story for predatory capitalism.

A politics honest about markets would say plainly that durable prosperity requires counterweights: unions, social insurance, public investment, competition policy, and guardrails against financial predation. These are not socialist seizures; they are the preconditions of a fair, innovative, and resilient market economy. The reason the scare word persists is simple: it works for the narrow sliver of society that benefits when everyone else is too frightened to demand a fair share.

1mvkn7d,https://i.redd.it/7smbgczhh7kf1.jpeg,I tried to do everything in one day and crashed…how do you pace yourself? 🤔,"Yesterday I wrote a superhero to-do list. Laundry, groceries, finish edits, reply to messages, gym, cook something new, clean the kitchen, call my mom, plan next week. I made a big coffee and told myself it was all happening today.

By noon I felt like my brain had twelve tabs open at once. I kept hopping tasks and finishing none of them.

At three I hit that weird foggy zone where you're moving but not actually doing anything. At five I gave up, ordered dinner, and felt guilty for the rest of the night.

This morning I tried something different. I picked three non-negotiables and let everything else be optional. I set a 25 minute timer, put my phone on the other side of the room, and promised myself a real break after the buzzer. It wasn't perfect, but I finished the three and I didn't end the day mad at myself.

How do you pace yourself when your list is longer than your energy? Do you do top three, time blocks, alarms, or something else that actually works for you?

I'm here in the comments for a bit and I would love to steal your best trick.🥰",16,1755709428.0,sunnylinabae,5,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Alianza Lima vs. Universidad Católica del Ecuador: A Copa Sudamericana Showdown Where the Odds Are as Clear as a Toaster in a Bakery**

The Copa Sudamericana quarterfinals have descended upon Quito like a poorly aimed free kick, and Alianza Lima is about to face Universidad Católica del Ecuador in a match that’s less “epic clash” and more “here’s hoping someone remembers how to score.” Let’s break this down with the statistical precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a sports bar drunk on coffee.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Católica Is the Favorite (And Why You Should Listen to Them)

The bookmakers aren’t just handing out free money—they’re telegraphing a clear message: **Universidad Católica is the team to back**. DraftKings and Bovada have Católica at **1.65-1.68** for a win, implying a **60-61% chance** of victory. Alianza Lima? A paltry **5.25-4.8**, translating to a **19-21%** shot. The draw? A **26-27%** “maybe” at **3.75-3.8**. Meanwhile, the spread favors Católica by **-0.75 goals** (1.85), and the total goals line sits at **2.5**, with “Under” at **1.95**.

What does this mean? Católica is expected to win *and* do so with a bit of flair. Alianza, meanwhile, is like a baker who forgot the yeast—present, but unlikely to rise.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Logo Errors, and the Ghost of Cienciano

Alianza Lima’s woes start with **Paolo Guerrero** and **Erick Noriega**, both out due to injury and transfer. Guerrero, a legend who could score with a headbutt, a deflected shot, or a prayer, is now a spectator. Without him, Alianza’s offense is a **toaster in a bakery**: loud, occasionally sparky, but ultimately useless when it comes to producing bread (or goals). They did beat ADT 3-1 recently, but that was with **Alan Cantero** scoring a double. Can he carry the team alone? Only if he’s also juggling laundry duties.

Universidad Católica, meanwhile, drew 1-1 wit

1mvkm4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1mvkm4t/laura/,Laura,"It was a long night. We poured coffee, and I stood in the door, starkly. 

""I love you still""

I love you still. Though the mountains decay and fall against time, though you cannot climb every single one. As the sand drifts into the sea, as birds slow their flight and drop, as the salt mixes in; we are left with ourselves, naked. Brushing against time and all it means.

Against the tapestry of hatred, I see that there is not much to do, and nothing left still. So out of my ribs I procure something tender, least we destroy ourselves, least we are left immobile against our own clawing ravaging. I would like to give you something against it all. This is the highest goodness (or something close to it), though I don't know what that means and can only try to. And it's all I can give you. You know I am quite powerless. Therein, lies my power. Call it a slave philosophy, there is no other one.

I am out of my stupor. She shifts.

""Do you, really?""

""You know I do.""

A silence.

""Why do you do what you do?""

""There is no other way.""

""I think that's quite bollocks, really. You think you're backed up against a brick wall, but you're leaning against a window.""

A shuddered breath, and then the exhale of a sigh. She continues.

""And you take your time to light a cigarette. Don't give me that nonsense about tuning up and playing a violin while the titanic sinks. There's a boat. This isn't the last shred of beauty you have to draw out, and if it is, you shouldn't. It's senseless, dangerous, polluting the air, and for what? There isn't anything romantic about tobacco. You're bleeding already. Why don't you just break it in?""

She pauses, a tear in her eye.

""You're killing the ones around you. The ship isn't sinking.""

The water is cold and purifying.

""I.. I can't take any more.""

""That's bollocks, and you know it.""

I turn my head, stifle a tear to see her like this, splayed on the bathroom floor, eyes half-dead and legs folded to fit the shower. Like a kid. Like she's counting clouds at a picnic, making out happy pictures. I readjust myself, take two steps forward, and set out to steel myself on my resolve. Te see it to it's end and have her on my journey, and me, in hers. I respond. Quiet, hurt, in pain, and doubly sincere.

""This is about you. You're sinking.""

I sit on the cold tile by her and feel a shiver running across my knuckles. I don't know how she enjoys this. Or if, she has to. It's snowing out, the window is open, and it's so clean outside that I can feel the dirt. It's the same way some psychopaths are overly neat and tidy and it sets people off. The world is clinical, I romanticize shitty leaves but I think it's because to me... it has to be. There has to be something beautiful about this. I claw that pain can't be senseless, that dirt makes it genuine. But I think it's just as cheap if it's manufactured. I stalled on my pain, I catch up in the present, I pay in the future. All I can afford is projectors and stale popcorn, playing a movie that I should be bored of by now, but God,

I have to revel in the feeling.

I hear a whisper. I don't know whose. A begging angel, maybe. ""You can't.""

I hear my own. ""I don't want to.""

""You can't.""

Foolishly, foolishly. I think that the world is too ready to throw out pain like last night's shitty pasta and diagnose it as something wrong with you. Maybe there's something wrong with this.

I come back to the present. She looks at me, grief-stricken.

""Hm?"" Gently. I do it gently. 

She's sinking.

""I don't want to be. I didn't want this to happen.""

""It was about time."" And I look at her so sadly.

I lean in to give her cold body a hug, a kiss would be inappropriate. I don't know what she's thinking, I think she's feeling something instead.

""I just wish she wasn't dead.""

""Yeah?""

""I hate this, Laura.""

""I know you do.""

He didn't take the break up well and we lost touch almost immediately .

He said, in front of her, we should meet up sometime. I was like oh definitely. I didn't think he actually meant it. He messaged me on Insta, nice seeing you the last day wanna hang out sometime, maybe a coffee or something.

She's an older woman who has/had custody of my cousins (her grandkids). Apparently yesterday her and my younger cousin (15 f) got to an argument while on the way to her (my cousin's) school and she (the grandma) physically starting beating her. I grew up in a family with physical discipline, like spankings on the arm or butt. But her grandma was beating her a coffee mug and my cousin nearly jumped out of the car. When my cousin got to school she immediately told the staff what had happened (as she should) and that her grandma was beating her younger brother too (he's around eleven). So cps was called and I'm not as worried for her, she's smart and already a teenager but her brother is still young. My mom thinks he might be placed with her but we we're denied once so... My question is are we qualified. My is in her late 40s with BPD and seizures, she's technically not working right now because she's on disability leave and her job is about to close down. My sister is 25 and only works partime, she has depression. I'm 22 with autism, seasonal depression, and severe social anxiety and have never actually worked before. We live in a 3 bedroom rented house which sometimes gets roaches and mice because the neighboring house is gross. We only had two dogs before but this past April my mom and sister thought it would be nice to have two cats as well. Not to mention we're a broke and can barely afford a hundred dollars in groceries, which in this economy isn't much.

I worked in a small hotel off the highway in a rundown rustbelt town in the midwest. The kind of place you'd stop if you weren't going to make it to your destination. I worked the front desk so I dealt with some characters and would often get frustrated with rude guests.

So, I'm working second shit one night and as usual I'm working solo. This guy comes walking in (probably in his 60's) and says ""Where's the f\*cking restaurant?"" I was confused because there was a restaurant right next door, and when I started to explain that to him he proceeded to cuss me out and rage the entire time I was checking him in about how pathetic we were. At one point I considered refusing service bit I got through it.

He left to go to dinner and I realized that most people his age drink a lot of coffee, so I had an idea. We had the carafe setup where it was 2 ""house brew"" and 1 decaf. I made 2 fresh carafes of coffee and I took the middle one in back and peed in it, not a lot but not a little either. I carefully put the pee coffee in the middle and went back to work.

For the next hour or so, if i saw someone go to the coffee area I'd say ""I just made fresh coffee, it's on the left"" to do damage control. Eventually the old man from earlier walks in and I kid you not walks directly over to the coffee area.

""Sir, I just made fresh coffee, it's in the MIDDLE.""

....and he did it you guys. I watched him pour a cup out of the middle carafe, raise it to his lips and take a sip. It was like slow motion I could feel my stomach tighten up when he did it. Part of me wanted to die laughing but i held it together with a stone face.

""Hmmm....pretty good coffee"" he muttered as he walked around the corner to the elevator.

I went in the backroom and DIED laughing. Then I went and washed out the middle carafe.

I am trying to forecast some sales for our coffee shop. We need to have labor costs match predicted traffic as well as ordering the correct amount of goods and items so there isn't a shortage or surplus. The highest paid person (Owner), has our items automatically placed but I'm not sure that he sees what has currently been selling more, has been selling less, seen the bumps in store traffic during certain times of day etc. My question is, would running a regression analysis from the data be appropriate to predict daily sales?

I bought the following coffee beans:

San Luis El Salvador  
Single Estate  
Origin: Santa Ana Volcano, El salvador  
Altitude: 1100 - 1400m  
Variety: Kenia, SL-34  
Processing: Washed  
Cup profile: floral notes-orange blossom, citrus-mandarin, black tea notes, pleasant acidity, round creamy body.

  
Roast Date: 04/08/2025

Why am I being suspicious?  
1) Usually, when i buy my coffee beans, the smell of the beans leaks through the bag and I can smell the beans without even opening the bag.   
2) After grinding the coffee beans, the smell is extremely pronounced. I enjoy smelling the ground coffee. For this coffee in particular, the smell was very fade. 

The bag was not on sale. It was 10 euros in athens, greece which is kind of a premium price for 250g and for the greek economy. 

Is there a way i can test those beans to be fully sure if they tampered with the roasting dates?",0,1755708565.0,espresso,6,0.22,False

I ended up going up to her and we both remembered each others name immediately and we clicked in an instant. We were both giddy and exchanged numbers but then went back to hanging with our friends. I had proposed we hang out when the event was over and she said she had plans already so I didn’t anticipate seeing her. But I really wanted to see her again so I ended up texting her that if her plans fell through that I know we’d have a fun time. She responds saying her plans actually did and she’d love to hang out. I end up walking across the school campus to get her and we walk back together. The conversation is flowing great and we’re both smiling the entire time joking and the nerves drop instantly. We come back to my place and hang out in my room and just talk for a while and the vibes only get better as the time goes on. I’ve hung out with other girls before but very few other times had it felt like this where it felt so easy and we clicked so well. I ended up going in for a kiss and she reciprocated. It escalated into making out and other stuff and as we’re getting to the point of all the way she tells me to wait because she wanted to see me again. I always think back to this moment she said, “wait but I wanna see you again”. I can’t help but wonder whether she meant because she didn’t want me to ghost her after, or if she didn’t want to have to ghost me because it would become a one night stand. I didn’t think of this at the moment and just told her “I wanna see you again too.” And that I was planning on it along those lines. After it had happened and there was nothing that was wrong during that time either our chemistry there was just as great as when we were talking. After we were back to talking and the vibes didn’t change at all and we were lying together talking about whatever. The night comes to a close and I offer her to stay the night if she wants but she insists she heads back. I offer to walk her back and she gladly accepts but says, “would’ve been a classic one night stand if I had to walk back alone” or along those lines. This makes me think her mind was made up at this point it was just another one night stand but I just thought that we would hang out again and in the excitement of the night it just led to that. I walked her back and we’re having a great time still, kissing in the rain, laughing, whatever. We get back to her place and I let her keep my sweatshirt assuming we were seeing each other again for her to give it back in time. I text her when I get back to my place and she responds and then in the morning continue the convo asking if she’s making it to an event she had told me about the night before. After a bit I ask if she’s free the following night to which she tells me she has a busy week and asks to let me know when she can hang again. I’m immediately left with confusion as to seeing how she’s already trying to cut things off it seems. I just assume she really is busy but I know what that means. After a while I hit her up again to say how I really enjoyed hanging out and would love to do it again. She tells me that she’s glad I reached out but doesn’t know if she’s in the place for a relationship or anything and we’d have to hang out as friends. I agree to anyways because I genuinely liked her company and maybe assume she’s shit testing to see how I’ll reply? I tell her that’s fine with me and we should grab coffee. She agrees and we do and when I pick her up everything seems fine and then after a while I bring up the night in question because I want to address it to see how she feels about it. I tell her in the moment it was fun but I wish the night we went without hooking up because I feel that it set a weird tone and she agreed and said it wasn’t something she normally did but felt for the moment being in college it felt right. I agreed with her but she told me that she was serious  about only wanting a friendship. I’m usually not terrible at picking up signals or anything but I seriously felt a great connection with her and don’t know how it couldn’t be somewhat reciprocated. She was planning on spending the summer across the country and then studying abroad for the first quarter of the year so that’s why she said she only wanted to be friends. After the hangout ended I dropped her off and she ended up somewhat ghosting me over text. A couple days later I just asked if she could bring my hoodie to a shared class together and she did, it was a short exchange. Maybe a week later or so I asked what she was up to later that night, she said hanging with friends, I told her if plans fall through I know we’d have an enjoyable time. She never responded. For reference we’re both 20 years old but I’m just super confused about the whole situation. It’s been a couple months now without contact but I still think about it and wonder what even happened and if there’s even a point in trying to try something again.

So, here I am posting from my main because my side account didn’t get much attention. Maybe it’s fate, maybe it’s just the algorithm, or maybe I’m just meant to put myself out there properly. Please introduce yourself do not just ask for a picture. 

A little about me:

I’m a plus-size woman with curves (BBW) and a soft spot for all things beautifully eerie.

I love wandering through cemeteries at dusk, reading old epitaphs, and admiring crumbling statues with stories carved into stone. To me, cemeteries aren’t sad they’re peaceful, mysterious, and oddly romantic.

Creepy things don’t scare me they fascinate me. Think: antique mourning jewelry, Victorian ghost stories, abandoned buildings, candlelit nights, and the smell of rain on old stone.

Music taste? Dark, heavy, and haunting (but I can appreciate weird and experimental too).

Personality-wise: I’m sarcastic, a little strange, and definitely not afraid to embrace the “weird girl” label. If you don’t mind awkward humor mixed with spooky tangents, we’ll get along.


What I’m looking for:

Something serious, genuine, and long-term. I’m not into games.

Someone who appreciates weirdness and won’t be put off by my love of cemeteries or late-night graveyard strolls.

A partner who can handle conversations that bounce from “which crypt is the coolest” to “what’s your biggest dream in life.”

Bonus points if you’re into tattoos, piercings, or the gothic/alternative scene but honestly, being open-minded and authentic matters more.


If you’ve ever thought ""Why isn’t there someone who wants to drink coffee in a cemetery with me and talk about death in a strangely cozy way? well, hi.

I'd really love some advice. I'm 40F and going through IVF after 2 years of infertility. It's a long road involving multiple egg retrievals (currently on 4) before PGTA testing and then FET preps. 

JUNE 2024 I had a laparoscopy and all hell broke loose. I mean anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, violent mood swings, and the most traumatizing hair loss. They found subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH 2.8) so started me on 50 mcg levothyroxine which I've been taking for a year now. IVF started in March. 

14 months later, some things have settled down but I'm still dealing with stuff that is really destroying my quality of life: 

Anxiety

Incredible mood swings, depression and weepiness during my luteal phase, I mean I become a different and very miserable person 

Coffee intolerance- I can no longer drink it and have been in the ER with a panic attack once already 

Low progesterone on day 21 - a problem I didnt have before the surgery 

My ADHD which was diagnosed at 38 has rendered me barely functional (I also can't medicate due to IVF). I have zero executive function especially around my LP and working memory, ability to focus or get things done are chronic 

And the worst- the hair loss just never stopped. I got a diagnosis of chronic Telogen effluvium and the shedding is just brutal, non stop and I can no longer style my once thick and beautiful hair - density is about half what it should be. 

I've not spoken to any doctor about it since the focus is trying to get pregnant and granted there are a lot of hormones exacerbating whatever is going on in my body. 

But is this peri? Should I be exploring what if any options there are for support especially since IVF could last a few years? Is HRT an option for those of us doing IVF?

Half of that time we were long distance because I was a single mom and my main priority was raising my son. Early on in our relationship, things got messy with her family. Specifically, her sister-in-law and I got into a heated argument about politics. It escalated quickly, and she hit below the belt first by making a nasty comment about my parenting, basically saying she felt sorry for my son for having me as a mother. That cut deep, and instead of walking away, I retaliated with something I regret to this day: I told her that her miscarriages were a sign from God that she didn’t deserve children. It was cruel and way out of line, and I can own that. But at the same time, the argument was fueled by spite, bitterness, and anger on both sides. It was one of those moments you wish you could erase but can’t.

The dynamic with her has always been messy. She dated women in high school but has since pretended to be aggressively homophobic ever since marrying a man. The hypocrisy is laughable—she even refused to acknowledge her own sister-in-law’s wife, instead calling her a “friend.” It’s ridiculous, and honestly, exhausting.

Fast forward to now, nearly a decade later. That blow-up happened in 2016, but neither of us have spoken since. The only saving grace is that we live in different states, so avoidance has been relatively easy. Whenever my wife goes to see her family, I’ve just stayed behind—it keeps the peace. But lately, my wife has been asking me to come along. She’s tired of feeling like she has to split her life in two: her family on one side, and me on the other. I’ve encouraged her to be honest with her family about how this makes her feel. I’ve even spoken with her mother myself, trying to bridge the gap. But nothing changes. Her family continues to act like it’s easier to appease the sister-in-law than acknowledge me as part of the family, even though the sister-in-law has shown constant disrespect to my wife’s parents—especially her dad.

Last Thanksgiving gave me some hope. My wife and I drove up to her family’s cabin to spend the holiday with her parents and her twin sister. Her parents didn’t arrive until the next day, so I grilled turkey legs for myself and the twins. It ended up being a beautiful, relaxing holiday. When her parents did arrive, everything flowed effortlessly. For the first time, I felt like maybe things were turning a corner. I even shared a quiet moment with her dad, sitting on the porch drinking coffee while he shared personal stories with me. It felt genuine, like he was finally letting me in. I held onto that moment.

But then recently, reality came crashing back. Her dad is about to retire and celebrate his birthday. The family reached out begging my wife to attend—but the invitation was only for her. No explanation, no excuses, just a flat-out exclusion of me. The real reason is obvious: the sister-in-law. Any time I’m around, she throws a tantrum. The last time I was even in the same city, she threatened to keep her kids away from their grandparents if I was allowed to visit. Since she has the biological grandkids, my wife’s parents cave to her every demand. They’re too timid to stand up to her, so I get pushed out. The only reason I was able to enjoy Thanksgiving with them was because—for once—she had other plans.

That’s when it hit me: after 10 years, after all the holidays, after all the effort, her parents will never truly recognize our marriage as real. My wife is welcome, but I am always excluded. I’ve told my wife countless times that I never wanted to take her away from her family—I just wanted to be included as part of her life. But after a decade of being left out, I’m tired. I’m tired of pretending things are fine when they clearly aren’t. I feel like a fool for believing pleasantries that were never genuine.

And now I’m questioning everything. Why should I be the one to mend things with someone who has disrespected not only me, but her entire family? Why does her tantrum dictate everyone’s lives? I love my wife deeply, with all my heart. She uprooted her life to be with me. But her family’s spinelessness, their refusal to defend us, and this constant exclusion have broken something in me.

So here’s my question: am I the asshole for wanting to leave my wife because her parents don’t have the courage to stand up to their daughter-in-law? ",84,1755707816.0,AITAH,136,0.87,False

In the first image you have an unobstructed visual on the end of the work and prep area of the kitchen. There also would be no wall splatter risk on the sides of the oven and one less gap next to the oven that food could fall down. It allows right handed cooking without elbows in the wall, but there's a door on the right wall so maybe this isn't that different. It does restrict right handed prep as you work next to the fridge.  But it exposes the side of the oven and there's maybe a risk of someone passing through from the doorway bumping a hot pan as they pass through.

On the second image the fridge visually obstructs the other part of the kitchen, which creates separate spaces between the prep area and what will be a coffee bar across the door opening but it reduces the open feeling.  of the space.  Right handed prep on the two cabinets between fridge and oven is good in this setup. Extra work needed to keep the backsplash and right wall clean by the oven.

My Husband and I have been married for less than 6 months, we are both muslims so we met each other and in the span of 3-4 months we got married and despite of this argument, I would do it like this again. We’re both students and I have a part time job so it’s a little bit tricky being married this young but it’s worth it in my opinion. 
My husband is an amazing person and I love being with him and he makes me happy. I do have one issue that started in the beginning of our marriage and lasts until now and every single time I bring it up it either excuses or something else which makes me feel like I’m going crazy: I want him to take me out and to just go out more specifically: I do not want to spend all my time inside mine or his 4 walls (we don’t currently live together but we are together either at his or my place)! I want to clarify that ITS NOT ABOUT MONEY!! We’re not that well off to go to a fancy restaurant every week or to do elaborate things and that’s not what I mean: i simply mean spending time together outside and going out. I’m not the biggest going out and nature person but being with someone for almost 6 months and still feeling like we never go out together is crazy to me. 
To make it fair I want to give some more context: 
We both study something difficult in university and with my job and other things regarding our studies it was pretty much, we married at the beginning of the semester and we‘re currently on summer break from university. I also want to note that I’m trying to really be the best version of myself, I’m cooking almost every meal- which is not a lot while being at home 24/7 but it’s a challenge balancing work and cooking while enjoying my summer break. When we got married we went to his family and enjoyed a vacation there and we went outside there and spent time with each other and going on cute dates, even if it was just going to get some ice cream and smoking a cigarette together while talking about whatever or even going to the burj khalifa or driving around Dubai.

Back home we went on 4 „dates“. The first one was after me getting annoyed by us never going out, it was even so bad that we called his mom to help us (this is not a red flag, I love this woman with my whole heart and I value her opinion, she’s like a second mom to me) after this he invited me out and while we were just sitting outside, enjoying the view, mutual friends showed up and started talking and eventually even hanging out. I was so upset after that because he didn’t take the initiative to tell them off so that we can enjoy our first date after being back home and being married. (Just to remind you again, we’re both muslims so we never dated and we didn’t have dates in any form before getting married). The second time I was frustrated again and because of how shitty the last date was, so after a lot of arguing we decided to go out, he will get us some food and we enjoy the sunset. This one „not being a real date“ was probably my fault. At this point in the day I was so upset at the fact that I need to literally throw a tantrum to get him to go and do something with me and I felt very angry even after I told him I was over it (I definitely wasn’t) and I couldn’t enjoy the date. The third time was us going to the city. It was his birthday recently and I got him a nice pair of jeans but it didn’t fit so we had to exchange them to better fitting ones. While we were in the city we walked around and found another men’s store so he tired on a few things and afterwards he didn’t want to walk anymore and he was tired and it felt like he just wanted to go home again. The fourth one (I’m not counting this as a date or us going out but he is so I’m including it) we went to a restaurant with his friends. He worked in his friends business and I came to visit him and them and his friends (a couple) suggested that we go out and eat something since we work all day and we were hungry. We sat at the dinner table and we had conversation and it was nice. (I’m not counting this because we weren’t alone and it’s just not a date in my opinion)

In all these arguments I expressed and explained my feelings: we are young and yes even tho we’re married I still want to experience things like that and I don’t want to feel bad for asking for a romantic gesture or a cute date. It’s frustrating to me that every date was either a shut up date (it’s like a shut up ring, which basically means that I feel like he only suggested going on a date because I was so upset and he wanted to shut me up) or a convenience date (exchanging the jeans or eating with his friends) it upsets me that it’s never a genuine date or a genuine „hey let’s go there or hey let’s do this“ without me bringing this thing up again. 

One of the arguments that really stuck with me is the one on my birthday: 
To paint the picture- my husband and I are both university students and this year my birthday was on the same day as a very important exam for me and him so we stayed up and before it was actually my birthday I was upset (yet again) about a lack of effort. Yes he didn’t know that but normally in my family, we get a something small and a candle to blow it out once it’s our birthday and realizing that he had planned nothing idk felt like a slap in my face. I got so upset over this and yes I do realize that this may be my fault but after putting in little effort into our marriage I have to admit I hoped that my birthday would be something special. (Yes maybe I’m crazy and maybe I was wrong in the situation and I was definitely in how I handled my emotions, but in the previous arguments i told him that I want to feel special with things he does for me and little romantic gestures, maybe I watch to many romantic movies and people on the internet or maybe I’m just different in this. I do see that with exams there’s been a time problem and my birthday was not as important as exams but on the other hand my birthday has been my birthday even when we got married and it was clear that my birthday falls into the exam phase. Eventually I got over it but i mentioned that I would like to have a little celebration on our Monthly anniversary’s, nothing fancy just a celebration of us getting married because for me it’s special and for me it’s important especially in our first year in marriage and regarding the fact that we never dated) in this conversation he told me that even tho we have exam phase right now he will make sure that we celebrate my birthday on another day. On my birthday after writing my exam I was with my sister and we spend the day together because he had to study and my sister is very important to me and basically my whole family. 9 days later at 4 days after the exam ended it was his birthday. Behind his back a planed a surprise birthday party and a gift that he wanted super bad (a new PlayStation controller) and I made all the food which included something salty and 2 cakes and surprised him with it. The birthday was not that beautiful because his friends were late for more than an hour but I would say we made the best out of the situation and my husband doesn’t like a lot of attention but he still enjoyed being around his friends since his family lives on a different continent. He never really celebrated his birthday and he never cared about it that’s why I took the initiative to plan and execute this plan. It still kind of stuck with me how he told me he would do something for my birthday so I waited but honestly nothing happened. After his birthday I was working almost everyday and I think I kinda forced myself to forget about it especially since I’m very happy being with him. Yes I listed something that annoys me but he is truly a good person and he loves me in all the love languages especially physical affection and love language but also acts of service and he his very kind and loving. I don’t want to discredit all the things he does but I still feel like this is important and it makes me upset that I feel like discrediting him just because I speak up about something that I’ve been vocal about for such a long time. The last few days it was amazing weather and he never suggested to go outside and hang out. I also want to point out that we do hang out like watching series or cuddling and obviously also talking but I really crave that going outside. I talked about this somewhere above: I want him to take the initiative and plan a date, I want us to go out and even do something that cost $0 or just a romantic walk and I feel like I have to beg for something that is so low effort and low cost. I just asked chat gpt and in my opinion it’s really not that hard and it makes me wonder if I have a husband who just doesn’t want to put effort into these things that are important to me. I just don’t like to always sit in my or his room and watch a series or him playing video games and me being on my phone. Yes these things are very normal and there’s nothing wrong with them but to just do this? To never do something else? To never having new experiences and cute dates? Like not even dates to go out and drink a coffee or go on a walk or anything. The lack of creativity and the lack of effort is making me feel very bad and every single time we resolve the argument and he tells me he will put effort in or do something specific it never happens for example my birthday do over. So after a few weeks we have the same argument again and it’s getting exhausting. I took this to Reddit because I just walked out of his house and walked to my house to get a clear head after our latest argument about this. This time we normally talked whether to stay at his house or go to my house and something triggered me and I started talking about this issue of him never taking the initiative to go out with me and he got very defensive and started saying that what im doing is toxic and I do not agree. As far as I understood he says that it’s toxic of me to want things without voicing my opinion and my wishes which is generally true. I’m not free of this and I do see that happening (wishing he got a candle for me to blow out at my birthday without ever mentioning something like that before and getting upset. (Yes it was more of a general thing more than just wanting candles but more like craving the effort that goes along with it)) but I don’t think it’s toxic to tell your partner over and over in detail what you want and them acting like you blindsided them and annoying them with the same argument over and over again. I got even more upset that he suggested a „shut up date“ again. He suggested that we can go on a walk together after he’s done (it’s raining rn ) and him getting mad and saying that if I say what I want and he gives me what I want I would always decline (which I didn’t because I was furious about the fact that the shut up date was happening again) is it truly toxic for me to want him to plan a day or a date on a random day without me having to start an argument again or be in his face and literally beg him to take me out? When i wanted to explain the situation that it’s normal for a couple to go out and do stuff together rather than staying at home all day everyday, he pointed out that his friends girlfriends ask them to do something and they don’t argue about this. Am I high maintenance? Am I truly asking for to much? 

After reading trough all of this I definitely see that I didn’t act right in a lot of situations and ways and that i definitely start this problem and this argument over and over again and that we could be so happy if I didn’t cling onto this but it’s really important to me and it’s something that makes me feel good. I go out and drink a coffee with friends all the time and I even just sometimes hang out with my sister and walk around to just talk but it’s annoying me so much that I lack this in my marriage and I want advice on how I should handle the situation, maybe where I discredit him and treat him unfairly and an overall opinion from a strangers point of view. I really love him and I want to be with him while being happy and in balance and this may sound like a little problem but these little problems are the root of why so many marriages and relationships fail so I desperately seek out to get help. Maybe some tips on how to get over this and ideas to what me or him could do to have more romantic moments in our marriage.",1,1755707800.0,relationship_advice,3,0.66,False

I just wanted to show what a Sey 1:20 looks like. With that brand they are very acidic and very light so when people say tea like that's the type of coffee they use. But the thing is they don't usually want a super acidic light coffee that puckers, they do like it sweet. The reason Sey does the 1:20 is it comes out extremely sweet but without almost any acidity and an amazing fruity flavorful cup. You can brew it richer (tighter ratio) but imo its not as good. Also if you do dime size pours in the center and DONT worry about the bed it will come out like this which is correct. Also you don't need a scale. Se a 16 gram 1:20 is approx 300 ML so if you pour the last one to hit or be right under the line you never will need a scale again. My point in this is I just wanted to show it is easy if you have the right expectations and don't fall for all the hype about the bed and extraction, etc.

My background is tech(devops/platform engineering) for the past \~10 years or so. The last two years have been brutal for me, and I have almost a two-year gap in my resume. As part of recovery/re-integration while working on my mental and physical health I plan to take some low-paid job not related to my career to get used to working again, keep medical insurance, and hopefully stop hemorrhaging savings. So the questions:

1. How do I successfully apply for those really low level jobs that I am way overqualified for? (think coffee shop, retail, those kinds of things)
   1. Should I completely rewrite my resume? I did have one retail job I worked way back during college that I'll probably list, but I'm not sure what I should do with all the high-level tech jobs I've worked since then.
   2. How do I answer when asked why I'm applying for this job?
   3. Is there a good way to answer ""how long will you be working here""?
      1. The goal for me would be a few months then go back to full time work, but it could be longer
      2. My thought is to say something like ""No I won't be here forever, but I'll also need minimal training etc . . . ""
2. How do I explain the gap in my resume?
   1. I could say something like ""I took a couple years to travel europe before coming back home"" or something like that I suppose?

There’s this cute Ethiopian guy who works there (pretty sure he’s diaspora). I don’t even know if it’s a crush yet or if I’m just curious about him, but let’s just say he is good looking, and makes amazing coffee dangerous combo.

One time, I stayed until like 6pm without realizing the cafe had already “closed” at 5. He didn’t even tell me to leave, and when I saw the time, I apologized and left. (Lowkey wondering if that was his way of being nice or just chill).

Fast forward a week later, I paid with actual cents (don’t judge ), and he just laughed. That’s when I asked him, “Where are you from?”and found out he’s Ethiopian. There was another guy working with him who turned out to be Caribbean, so I actually said “where are you guys from?” instead of just him lol.

He didn’t ask me where I’m from though 👀. For context, I’m Eritrean but I just moved here from the Middle East. So I’m not sure if we’d even have much in common beyond the whole East African connection.

Anyway, idk where this is going but it feels nice having a spot like this and someone interesting to look forward to when I go get coffee lol makes my day less boring after all

- Kitchen Aid with Burr grinder
- Nina 701 (Too many problems so i've canned it)  
- And a couple from Delonghi

(Around the £700 range and there's some bank holiday deals right now)

Now i've seen a lot of people mention separate grinder and the bambino. 

- Does the separate grinder truly improve the taste to someone who just wants to improve their coffee experience ? 

- Secondly the grinders in built in a couple of the machines above e.g Sage is that not similar to buying a separate Sage grinder ? 

- Having a separate grinder / machine, does it take a lot longer to make an espresso / flat white for example ?

1mvjmod,https://www.reddit.com/r/nofriends/comments/1mvjmod/am_i_a_bad_person_for_not_reaching_to_my_friends/,Am I a bad person for not reaching to my friends first anymore,"Hi! I stumbled upon this sub and I hope this them is on point with  what thus group is about since it's essentially about me being that one friend that is always left out. just wanted to relieve my soul somewhere. I'm apologising in advance for this post being very long, I wanted to provide more context to the entire story.

I'm 26, female and I have few friends I consider close, plus few people I met by having the same hobby (I made art as hobby but it turned in a little side job that led me online communities and convet) which led to meetings and friendship despite some of them living in different countries, but I still considered people I've been friends since school days my closest friends. 

This part isn't about people I've met through hobby.

I'm the one who remembers, calls, listen, help keep a pet or move/clean apartmens, buy presents for them and their children/spouses, help with notes and studies. It was like that during our time in school, when I was busy with uni, than my career/job, nothing changed during nor after I got married to a man I've been with since we were in highschool, nor now when I'm completely free because I don't work due to spine injury (sick leave is 6 months, than board approves prolonged leave if they find you unable to work. It's possible only in cases of serious medical conditions), I always have time to answer the call or to send a message to check on them. But none of them would do the same for me.
(Sidenote, my husband isn't clingy, nor he puts himself in our hangouts unless he is invited to a party or we host a party. And most of the time he hang with husbands and boyfriends of my friends. Boys talks I guess) 


Excuse my friends started using frequently is that they don't want to bother me because I'm sick. 
By sick they mean that I have had spinal injury around a year ago, now awaiting surgery. I'm in and out of doctors office a lot, but I don't bother people with that problem. I stll can take medication, walking cane, and walk out to cafe or bar and sit there for hour or two with occasional standing up to move my legs a bit. My condition isn't contagious nor do I complain around about it, no one is obligated to bear with my health struggles. I talk about it only if someone explicitly asks what's wrong with my back/legs. But I feel like they just found perfect excuse now. I had hospital stay some time ago, not a single message from them to check if I was ok.

Few weeks ago I reached out to a friend I haven't seen in a long time because she didn't reach out to me in any other form except sending insta reels. Asked to meet at least for a coffee since she's busy per her words, she couldn't. Later that same day I saw her in a bar with other people. We also used to work in the same company as mechanical engineers, until I got sick leave approval, at work she had other group she spent breaks with. I don't mind since she is in quality control sector and I'm part if the powertrain engineering team. 


Back in February, I messaged to another friend (9 years long friendship) for her bday, gave her present a bit earlier since I wanted to surprise her as soon as the present arrived, she opened the message like month later than replayed to it mid April saying she's busy and doesn't feel like talking to anyone. Since than she's ignoring all my posts, stories etc on socials despite being active all day. Which shows me she deliberately doesn't want to talk to me specifically, not everyone as she claims.

Since things like this kept happening for a long time, I just decided to stop reacting out to all of them. Than yesterday I stumbled upon one of those friends in shopping centre, and I was scolded for 'not reaching out like I forgot he existed'. He was quite offended when I said it's because I'm busy.

Meanwhile, we all live in the same city, small city to add to that, less than 200k people, you can walk it over in like 2h, so we are not that far away. And not all of us are the part of the same friend group, so it's not like they are together in the ignoring me for longest time game. We all have other friends too if that makes sense. 

Back to people I met accidentally online/at cons 4-5 years ago. They are messaging frequently, some of them visited on a lot of occasions, staying at our home so they don't have to pay for hotel or food, still insisted to repay somehow. We visited them (many of them invited my husband as well), same story. We exchanged packages with souvenirs, snacks, presents through the years. They always remembered my husband as well in those packages. One friend even went out of his way to visit wanting us to show him the country but only by travelling the ways and places that can accommodate my condition. If impossible, he was willing to just chill at home with us for 10 days. We still went to 7 different cities and had great time. Those people live in countries like Luxembourg, Japan, India, BiH, UK, Malaysia, Korea, North Carolina (USA). Despite time difference, we do texting, video calls. They don't mind posting photos with me. Something people I've known almost since childhood never do. But people whose life is somewhere else, far away, still can make time and introduce me to other friends and family. 

Now I feel like a bad person for ignoring their existence, but I'm just sad and disappointed. I don't even feel like confronting them and asking am I that unlikeable that they are around only if they need something or if I pull they by the sleeve. 
Was all the time we hang out because they pitied me, or something changed in the meantime....did I do something, anything to be that unlikeable to them.

Thanks to everyone who reads to all if this. I wrote literal essay.

1mvjlzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugInWellness/comments/1mvjlzn/explore_if_the_carbona_carpet_cleaner_really/,Explore If the Carbona Carpet Cleaner Really Eliminates Deep Stains,"Testing out the Carbona 232FBA1 Carpet Cleaner has been quite an experience for me, especially as someone who constantly faces the challenges of keeping carpets looking pristine. Between kids, pets, and life’s unpredictable messes, I’ve relied on countless carpet products before, and not all of them deliver. This one, however, stood out and gave me moments where I genuinely felt like I’d found a magic solution for tough stains. But, as with every product, there are some details worth considering before making it a staple in your cleaning routine.

**Packaging and User-Friendly Design**  
I was immediately impressed with the straightforward nature of this product’s design. The Carbona 232FBA1 doesn’t rely on fancy gimmicks, which I deeply appreciate as a daily user. The dual applicator head—with its sponge on one side and bristles on the other—caught my attention right away. The sponge worked brilliantly for removing surface stains, while the bristles did a great job getting deep into the carpet fibers. It feels almost therapeutic, scrubbing out life’s messes with a tool that actually seems like it was built to help you, not frustrate you.

**Advantages:**  
- Dual applicator head for both surface cleaning and deep scrubbing.  
- Compact packaging makes it easy to store and grab when needed.  
- The unified design prevents leaks, which is a blessing if you’ve ever had cleaning solutions ruin more than they fixed.

**Performance That Made Me Rethink My Other Products**  
The oxy-powered foam was a game-changer. I tested it on an older coffee smear that had haunted me for years, something other products couldn’t entirely lift. Watching the foam bubble up and settle into the fibers gave me a bit of hope. I let it sit for a few minutes as per the instructions, and the result? Pretty amazing. The stain wasn’t just faded—it was nearly invisible. And the slight citrus-like freshness that lingered afterward left the room smelling inviting. It’s not exaggerating to say that cleaning with this product can feel oddly satisfying.

**What It Does Best:**  
- Removes tough stains like wine, coffee, and pet accidents with incredible effectiveness.  
- Leaves carpets visibly refreshed without discoloration.  
- Doesn’t require excessive scrubbing, saving you effort and time.  

[Check Carbona 232FBA1 price on Amazon.](https://sanue.com/p/b0cz2jpsqk/)

**Things to Watch Out For**  
Although the performance was impressive, there are a few things to note. For one, the product doesn’t work on materials like silk or velvet. This caveat is clearly mentioned on the label, but for someone unfamiliar with these details, it could lead to issues. Additionally, although the applicator tool is useful, cleaning the bristles after use is kind of tricky. It tends to hold onto dye from darker stains if not cleaned thoroughly.

**Disadvantages:**  
- Can’t be used on some delicate fabrics such as Haitian cotton or silk.  
- Cleaning the bristles post-use can be messier than expected.  
- Requires color testing on a hidden area before full application, which adds an extra step.

**Target Users and Household Scenarios**  
This cleaner is particularly suited for families, pet owners, or anyone who entertains frequently. Spills happen—no way around it—but knowing you’ve got something effective to tackle stains makes life simpler. In my household, it’s already seen action on muddy pawprints, rogue grape juice stains, and the occasional “oops” moment from my toddler’s overzealous snack experiments.

**Competing Brands**  
I’ve tried my fair share of carpet products in the past, including well-known brands like Resolve and Woolite. While those are effective in their own way, they often lack the dual-action applicator that Carbona features. Resolve, for instance, delivers great stain-fighting power but doesn’t allow for the same targeted, deep-cleaning action. On the other hand, Woolite tends to leave a very noticeable scent behind, which some people might find overpowering. Comparatively, the Carbona excels for its balance—adequate scent, strong stain-lifting power, and a design that focuses on convenience.

**How Does It Measure for Quality for Price?**  
Evaluating its potential cost, it feels like a solid mid-range product that delivers high-end results. Sure, it’s not going to replace professional cleaning equipment entirely, but for personal use in-between big cleanings, this product is undeniably convenient and effective. You’re not just investing in a cleaner; you’re getting a problem-solver for furniture, area rugs, and carpeting. If priced alongside competing options, it’s the kind of product that stands out for its high utility in everyday life.

1mvjkwl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mvjkwl,These spicy floofs are getting a life sentence,"Yesterday evening when I got home from work, my daughter and her friend come bursting through the door. ""Mom, dad! There's a kitten in the bush!"" 

We come outside and sure enough, there's a little furball of a tuxedo kitten sitting next to our shrubs. At this point, two more, a white/tabby kitten and a calico come out, meowing their little hearts out. 

They're all massively infested with fleas. We give the three kittens a Dawn bath and the water turns coffee brown from all the blood and dirt, I'll put that in the comments. Their gums are white from anemia. We take them to the emergency vet and they check them out and say they're stable. They should be okay until the Humane Society opens in the morning. 

We get home, and about ten minutes later, two more calicos pop out of the shrub. Is this a kitten spawning shrub? We check them out and add them to the gaggle that is in a crate already. 

Just as I'm about to call it a night, I hear ANOTHER mewing from the shrub. Out waltzes another tuxedo kitten. Six kittens total. Mama cat is nowhere to be seen, and even if she was, they're so flea infested that some of these kittens may die if they went back to mom. 

They're so adorable, and spicy little floofs. The tuxedo fluffball tries to hiss, and she's got a good bite, especially with her kitten teeth. The calico my daughter is holding is a total sweetheart, and if we could keep it and get it healthy, we totally would. My guess is they're somewhere around 4-6 weeks, I'd put it more towards 4.

1mvjgte,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mvjgte,Chic Magazine Interview : Wang Duo shocked Yang Yang by his weight loss. Duo talks about his creative process,"
When traveling, Wang Duo prefers to go to places with mountains and water, with urban neon lights preferably not far away.

He believes that people are multi-faceted, and staying authentic in life is the most important thing. “To make a character come alive, first he must live in your own body and heart, then he can live in the audience’s sight.”

In life, he lets himself observe more; when filming, he experiences happiness, joy, and that exhilarating feeling through acting.

**01 Self-Recharging**

During the interview period, Wang Duo had been filming on set, and afterward was going to Xinjiang to film “Live Long and Prosper.” He’s no stranger to Xinjiang, having had some filming experiences there.

Xinjiang is vast and sparsely populated, with rich and diverse landscapes - each place has its unique appearance. “In Xinjiang, whenever I arrive at a scenic spot, I feel a kind of beauty and shock that hits the soul directly,” Wang Duo says. He feels Xinjiang is a wonderful place that can constantly amaze him.

Now Wang Duo spends most of the year on film sets. When talking about his hometown Shenyang, he laughs and says he hasn’t been back for a long time. “I went back during New Year, but left again after just a few hurried days.” During his days on set, when not filming, Wang Duo arranges his own life, basically: self-recharging, conserving energy, preparing for the next scene.

“My life is actually quite boring,” Wang Duo admits frankly. Some friends around him like to draw energy from external sources - they need socializing, need joy, need many friends to feel energized. But for him, the fact is, it’s easier to recharge when alone; he enjoys solitary time with himself more.

Over these years of filming, Wang Duo has gradually developed a small habit. After reading each script, he leaves himself a considerable amount of time to prepare for the role. As he has always believed, filming itself isn’t difficult - what’s difficult is the few months before joining the cast to get into character.

Pre-production preparation is more important than things like blocking, memorizing lines, and emotional adjustment during filming. “These things aren’t actually difficult - what’s difficult is the fulcrum,” Wang Duo says. “I believe that to make a character come alive, first he must live in your body and heart, then he can live in the audience’s sight.”

**02 “Like stewing beef and carrots into a dish - how to stew it, what seasonings to add, these are all the actor’s personal methods”**

In the currently airing costume fantasy drama “The Immortal Ascension,” Wang Duo plays Wang Chan, the young master of the Ghost Spirit Gate, who is brutal, crude, and capricious.

Wang Duo remembers that suddenly one night, Director Yang Yang sent him a WeChat message asking if he had watched “The Immortal Ascension” and whether he remembered the character Wang Chan. “I said I remembered - he’s that stupid, clumsy villain… Director Yang Yang told me to go watch it more, so I did. Because I knew Director Yang Yang was starting this project, and since the director talked to me about it, he must have felt I was suitable or that I had a chance to portray such a character, so I rewatched it countless times.” Wang Duo recalls, “After watching it repeatedly countless times, I suddenly felt this character was a type I had never tried before. I could imagine many possibilities in this character, and I was confident I could interpret him better, so I became Wang Chan.”

Before filming began, Wang Duo “frantically” rewatched the “Immortal Ascension” anime, but that alone wasn’t enough. Wang Duo felt that live-action presentation and anime motion capture aren’t the same system. As an actor, how to control the measure of performance? This was something he needed to carefully consider.

“Because I was afraid of overacting, but also afraid of not doing enough; very afraid of departing from the original foundation, but also afraid of copying the foundation too much.” Additionally, before joining the cast, Wang Duo had to rationalize all the character’s behaviors, psychological motivations, and emotions - like his original family, how he grew up, why he developed such personality flaws. “So I would add many interesting settings to enrich the character, thereby rationalizing his every scene.”

In Wang Duo’s view, children who aren’t valued from a young age most desperately want others’ recognition. “So Wang Chan’s madness, his unscrupulous methods, as well as his brutality, crudeness, and capriciousness - the root purpose of all these is that he needs a sense of existence, he needs recognition from his family, he wants to prove himself… So if you ask me whether there are difficulties when acting, once you add these causes and effects, everything actually flows naturally.”

Rationalizing character motivations, making people empathize with the villain’s emotions while also understanding his actions - this is what Wang Duo finds most interesting about playing villains, “a small personal challenge.” He says: “It’s like stewing beef and carrots into a dish - how to stew this dish, what seasonings to add, these are all the actor’s personal methods.”

In another upcoming drama “Blemished Flaw,” Wang Duo plays university professor and ceramicist Zeng Jie, also a complex, multi-faceted character who’s not what he seems.

Such characters always attract him because they offer great performance space and are interesting to act. “I think Zeng Jie represents people who are everywhere in reality - they’re very good at disguising themselves and only show you the side they want you to see. When filming, you can tear off this person’s beautiful exterior, empathize with him from within, become him, understand him - this process is like a foundation-building pill for advancing my cultivation!” Interpreting such characters also nourishes the actor.

“Are you an actor who can quickly step out of character?”

“I wasn’t before, but I am now,” Wang Duo says. Even after stepping out of each character, their traits inevitably leave something in his body. Wang Duo believes this has largely shaped his current personality.

For example, before acting in “Bloody Romance,” he was a particularly optimistic boy who would only think of the best, most anticipated outcomes when facing situations. But after playing Gongzi, he discovered he had changed - he would consider how situations might develop from different angles. Similarly, because he’s recently been filming “Live Long and Prosper,” he says this character has also made him much more cheerful.

**03 Staying Authentic**

Returning to life, Wang Duo feels that people are multi-faceted, just showing different states in different environments to cope with current circumstances. But staying authentic in life is the most important thing. “So-called authenticity might just be being yourself. If you’re still tense in life, still performing, still setting up false scenarios for yourself, then when you actually join a production, there won’t be enough (space) left for the character.”

In life, Wang Duo is a relatively free-spirited person. He doesn’t like being bound by conventional habits and enjoys a free, spontaneous lifestyle. When he doesn’t have much work, he lets himself observe life more, see more, play more - he can be a bit restless and passionate because at this moment he doesn’t need to focus on a character.

At home daily, he reads books, watches movies, or plays games - these are all lifestyle choices he really enjoys. If staying home gets too stuffy, he’ll go work out, meet friends, chat with friends, drink coffee, and talk about life.

When traveling, he prefers places with mountains and water that also have urban atmosphere - where he can intimately connect with nature but won’t feel too spacious or silent.

“If it’s just a natural environment, I feel it’s too loose and spacious. When I need urban neon lights to recharge me, I hope they’re not far away - I can go whenever I want.” Sounds quite difficult? Wang Duo thinks it’s actually not hard to go to such places, as long as you’re willing to look.

**CHIC: Do you have any memorable birthday moments from this year to share with everyone?**
**Wang Duo:** What impressed me most was that I’ve never had so many people celebrate such a grand birthday with me. The level of emotion was something I’d never experienced - it was the first time I received so many letters… These were all very unforgettable things, firsts in my life.

**CHIC: Do you usually pay attention to rituals or remember important dates?**
**Wang Duo:** The dates I remember best are probably my parents’ birthdays. In life, I don’t set commemorative days - I’m quite free-spirited and don’t like being bound by fixed dates and conventional habits.
I think when you need ritual, it doesn’t have to be on a specific day. For example, if I want my life to have ritual today, then no matter what day it is, it can be very ceremonial.

**CHIC: Share some behind-the-scenes stories with co-actors during filming “The Immortal Ascension”?**
**Wang Duo:** Thinking back now, most of my scenes with Han Li were filmed separately. The first scene I filmed after joining the cast was the martial arts scene where I fought Han Li outside the Yan family fortress, so after joining I barely saw Yang Yang in person. When all those scenes were finished and I had already joined the next production, we returned to Hengdian to film some relationship shots. That’s when I filmed a lot with Yang Yang. The first thing Yang Yang said when he saw me was: “How did you get so thin?” Because I was quite chubby when I first joined the cast.

**CHIC: Your other new work “Blemished Flaw” is also awaiting broadcast. You play a university professor and ceramicist who appears refined but is actually hypocritical - quite a contrast. What attracted you to this character?**
**Wang Duo:** Your description is very accurate. This character is a hypocritical false saint. What attracts me is his performance space - he has public and private faces, his own inner world, and also markets his magnificent exterior shell outside. (Sounds like performative personality?) He doesn’t belong to performative personality, but is someone particularly good at self-packaging - an extremely self-packaging egoist.

**CHIC: Did you learn ceramics before filming began?**
**Wang Duo:** Of course. Before filming we had script readings for a week, and basically spent three to four hours daily at the ceramics studio, learning and discussing with teachers, understanding ceramics, learning about pottery-making processes and techniques, and making pottery ourselves.

**CHIC: You seem to have played many villain roles these past two years. Do you have any goals for your future acting?**
**Wang Duo:** I think I have something in common with Wang Chan. Wang Chan says: “What is good and evil? Nothing more than the victor becoming king and the loser becoming bandit.” In my view, what is good and evil? Nothing more than different standpoints. So I don’t think there’s such thing as villains - just characters with different standpoints.
I hope to keep acting, and more hope to keep playing roles I want to play. Does this count as a goal? It’s a beautiful wish.

**CHIC: Please recommend three favorite hometown foods.**
**Wang Duo:** I haven’t been back to my hometown for a long time. For hometown food recommendations, let me mention some specialties: Shenyang’s guo bao rou (sweet and sour pork), chicken racks, and Shenyang’s barbecue is also very famous.

**CHIC: What work plans do you have for the rest of this year?**
**Wang Duo:** Filming on set. In a couple days I’m going to Xinjiang to film “Live Long and Prosper.“​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

1mvjgfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawncare/comments/1mvjgfy/experiment_does_pregermination_actually_help/,Experiment: Does Pre-Germination Actually Help Grass Seed? (TTTF Test),"I wanted to run a small test to see if pregermination really makes a difference.

**Setup:**

* Seeds: Turf-Type Tall Fescue (GCI blend, 2 years old).
* Soil: Same indoor potting mix, same cups, same location.
* Watering: Light misting daily to keep soil moist.
* Method: Started one cup directly in soil on Aug 8. At the same time, soaked several seed batches in a coffee filter inside a cup of water. Each day after that, I planted one new pregerminated batch into soil.

**Timeline (simplified):**

* **Day 1 (Aug 8):** Batch 1 in soil. Batches 2–4 soaking.
* **Day 3 (Aug 10):** Batch 2 planted.
* **Day 4 (Aug 11):** Batch 3 planted.
* **Day 5 (Aug 12):** Batch 4 planted.
* **Results:** Every batch took **4 days in soil** to show germination, regardless of whether it was pregerminated or not.

**Observations:**

* The *non-pregerminated* batch was actually the first to sprout (Day 5).
* The pregerminated batches didn’t speed things up, each needed 4 days in soil to germinate.
* Surprising bonus: these seeds are 2 years old, and they still popped in just 4 days.

**My takeaway:**  
Pre-germination didn’t give me any noticeable advantage with TTTF. Maybe it helps with other grass types, but in this test it didn’t matter.

I’m planning a full overseed in early September, so I’m open to running more mini-experiments if folks have ideas. Would love feedback, am I missing something here? Does pre-germ help more in real-world lawn conditions vs cup tests?

we are planning to start a Coffee shop. I was looking around POS systems like Clover, Sqaure and Toast. 

I need cash register and 2 kiosks ( where i can use ipad in kios for sales), employee timecards, payroll generation and all the sales should automatically go to quickbooks online. My estimation sales ( not on day 1 but eventually after few months) might cross around 30 to 40,000 USD per month

  
can anyone suggest me which POS is better for my case 

  
Thank you

1mvjegs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplianceCheck/comments/1mvjegs/reveal_the_truth_about_best_coffee_machine/,Reveal the Truth About Best Coffee Machine Breville Precision Brewer,"Breville BDC450BSS1BUS1 has been a regular part of my mornings for several months now, and I have to say, it's redefining how I approach brewing coffee. Honestly, this brushed stainless steel machine isn’t just another coffee maker—it feels like an upgrade to my kitchen rituals. With features that scream innovation, it also has a few quirks that deserve a mention. Here's a breakdown of the experience.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The sleek brushed stainless steel finish immediately caught my attention. It fits seamlessly into any modern kitchen setup and doesn’t feel out of place in mine. The footprint, measuring 12.72"" x 6.69"" x 15.75"", is compact enough to sit on my counter comfortably while still allowing room for other gadgets. It's a good balance of size and utility. The control panel, equipped with buttons and a crisp interface, is intuitive even for someone like me who’s not particularly tech-savvy in the morning. That said, it's quite heavy at 10.63 pounds—so don’t expect to casually move it around your counter.

**Performance and Brewing Modes**  
This drip coffee maker is no ordinary machine; it's like having your personal barista at home. With six brewing modes, you can craft anything from Gold Standard coffee to Cold Brew or even iced coffee—all at the touch of a button. I've primarily been using the My Brew mode, which lets me adjust bloom time, brewing temperature, and flow rate. The control over brewing parameters is a game changer for me; I’ve been able to customize my coffee to be more floral, bright, or earthy, depending on my mood. The Gold Cup preset stands out since it meets SCA (Specialty Coffee Association) standards. I wasn’t even aware that precise brewing temperatures (197° to 204° F) made such a huge difference until I tried this.

**[Check Breville BDC450BSS1BUS1 price on Amazon.](https://werdink.com/p/b078rqvqf1/)**  

**Highlights**  
- Automatic brewing presets and fine-tuned modes for personalized coffee  
- Three flow rates with digital temperature control for precision brewing  
- Includes reusable dual filter baskets (Flat Bottom & Cone Filters)  
- Pour-over adapter compatibility for those who love manual brewing methods  

**Dual Filter Basket System**  
One unique aspect is the inclusion of flat-bottom and cone-style filter baskets. This versatility ensures you can experiment with different brewing techniques, which I personally enjoy doing on weekends when I have more time. The reusable filter design also saves on paper filters, making it a bit more eco-conscious. The only hiccup? Cleaning the reusable filters can be a bit of a hassle since tiny coffee grounds tend to stick around longer than desired.

**Thermal Carafe and Heat Efficiency**  
Unlike glass carafes that tend to let your coffee go lukewarm too quickly, this thermal carafe keeps my brew hot for hours. On busy mornings, I love being able to pour out a hot cup even after neglecting it for an hour or two while juggling other tasks. However, pouring from the carafe isn’t perfect. It requires a slower pour or you risk spillage, which feels like something that shouldn’t happen at this price point. While it’s manageable, it’s mildly frustrating during rushed moments.

**Negatives**  
- Cleaning the reusable filters can be tedious after heavy usage  
- Pouring from the thermal carafe requires patience to avoid spills  

**Competitors**  
One can’t help but compare it to giants like the Technivorm Moccamaster or the Bonavita Connoisseur. While the Moccamaster excels in construction and simplicity, it lacks the broader brewing modes found on this coffee maker. The Bonavita competes closely with its consistent brewing temperature but doesn’t offer as much customization. If you’re into exploring your coffee preferences like me, this coffee machine offers a lot more versatility. However, for minimalists who prefer straightforward brewing, those options are worth considering.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Is this machine worth your money? To me, yes—if you’re the type of coffee drinker who notices the nuances in flavor profiles and loves the ability to tailor your coffee to match café-quality results. The multi-functionality feels like a solid investment for true coffee enthusiasts. However, casual users might find the price steep for morning Joe—sometimes simplicity is all that’s needed in a coffee maker.

1mvje76,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToolTales/comments/1mvje76/could_the_vevor_commercial_margarita_machine_be/,Could the VEVOR Commercial Margarita Machine be the perfect slushy maker? Review inside!,"Testing out the VEVOR XRJ Commercial Margarita Machine has been a fascinating dive into the world of slushies and frozen drinks. As someone who enjoys both hosting gatherings and experimenting with new equipment, I couldn't resist putting this stainless steel beauty to the test. Its design, colossal capacity, and impressive features make it a tempting choice for both personal and commercial use, but there are certainly aspects worth discussing.

**Outstanding Capacity and Practicality**  
This machine boasts two 15-liter tanks, an astounding total of 30 liters—a feature hard to overlook when you're looking to serve a crowd. Hosting my niece's birthday party provided the perfect opportunity to truly push this machine to its limits. We churned out frozen margaritas for the adults and fruit slushies for the kids, and the machine's performance more than delivered. The illuminated interior bowls added a fun, vibrant vibe during the evening hours, perfectly complimenting the celebration.

**Build Quality That Speaks Volumes**  
I've used cheaper slush machines in the past, but the thickened stainless steel body of this one screams durability. Despite its 98-pound weight (yes, moving it felt like a workout), its sturdiness is reassuring. The food-grade PC tanks and ABS components seem carefully chosen—they don't stain or retain lingering odors, which is crucial after serving something like chocolate slushies or frozen coffee. Cleaning the wide stirrers, which rotate in 360 degrees to prevent sediment buildup, required some attention but wasn't overwhelmingly time-consuming.

**Efficient Cooling and Versatile Drink Options**  
This is where the machine really shines. The 1000W compressor paired with a copper condenser ensures the slushie consistency comes out perfect, time after time. It didn't matter if I was making citrus slush, iced tea, or frozen cocktails—the production stayed consistent. Interestingly, compared to other similar machines I've explored (or borrowed from friends), the VEVOR impressed me with its lower noise levels, which was a relief during family movie night.

**Precision Controls: Simple but Effective**  
The control panel is intuitive, with distinct COOL DRINK and SLUSH modes—this versatility is excellent for those trying to jump between different drink types. During my first attempt, the pre-programmed settings were super helpful since guessing the right temperature isn’t my strong suit. Watching the digital display for temperature adjustments proved handy when someone requested a colder slush mixture for their drink. On the downside, the controls don't leave much room for customization outside the factory presets, which might limit advanced users.  

**Good Aspects**  
- Large capacity, ideal for gatherings or business use  
- Durable stainless steel construction paired with food-grade materials  
- Impressively quiet operation for a commercial-grade machine  
- Multiple cooling modes for versatile drink options  

**Critiques**  
- The machine is heavy and not easy to move; once it's in place, it’s staying there.  
- Limited customization on control settings outside factory presets.  
- Cleaning drip trays and stirrers may feel tedious after multiple uses.  

**Market Rivals**  
Looking at alternatives like the Bunn Ultra-2 Frozen Drink Machine or the Elmeco Quickream, I noticed some trade-offs. Both competitors offer sleek designs but fall short on total capacity compared to the VEVOR XRJ. The Elmeco Quickream, for instance, focuses more on premium build quality but is significantly pricier. On the other hand, the Bunn Ultra-2 offers simpler cleaning elements but lacks the rapid cooling efficiency found here. If capacity and cooling speed rank high on your priority list, VEVOR's slushy machine edges out its challengers.  

**Price Performance**  
When I consider the features this product brings, its price seems more than justified. Sure, it's not a ""budget-friendly"" pick, but it delivers value through its capacity, powerful cooling, and steady performance. If you're in markets like restaurants, cafes, or even hosting frequent parties, the investment makes sense. On the flip side, a less frequent user or someone making slushies occasionally may find it a bit excessive.

We’re talking about the good stuff here, people. The kind that makes you question whether you need to hide snacks from your own family.

Yesterday, my son comes up to me with those puppy dog eyes. “Dad, can I have some of your popcorn?”

Now, I’m not a monster. I love my kid. But this popcorn this popcorn is MINE. It’s my one vice, my small joy in this chaotic world. So I make what I think is a reasonable compromise.
Grrr I guess, you can have ONE bag. Just one, okay?

He nods enthusiastically. “Thanks Dad, you’re the best!”

I should have known. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

Last night I literally had a dream about eating this popcorn. Not kidding. In my dream, I was sitting in my man cave , watching sports highlights, and I was just peacefully munching on my favorite popcorn while jazz trumpets playing. It was beautiful, man.

Cut to this morning. I’m practically skipping to the pantry, ready to make my dream a reality. I reach for the box and… 
Empty.

COMPLETELY. EMPTY.

My heart didn’t just drop it fell through the floor, through the earth’s crust, and is now floating somewhere near the earth’s core.

I call out, “SON! COME HERE. NOW.”

He shuffles in, somehow already looking guilty before I even say anything.

“Didn’t I say ONE bag?”

“Well technically you said one bag at a time”
“WHEN DID I SAY AT A TIME?!”

“I may have implied it?”

Y’all. This kid ate SEVEN BAGS of popcorn. Seven! He had the audacity to leave the empty box in the pantry like some kind of popcorn graveyard monument to my broken trust.

The worst part? When I asked him how he could possibly eat seven bags of popcorn, he just shrugged and said, “It was really good, 
Dad. I can see why you like it so much.”

I’m typing this from the store parking lot where I just bought THREE boxes because I have trust issues now and need 
to create a strategic popcorn reserve.

1mvjdkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Shop/comments/1mvjdkz/why_every_café_and_office_needs_a_bean_to_cup/,Why Every Café and Office Needs a Bean to Cup Coffee Brewer,"Running a commercial café, office, or restaurant comes with a lot of challenges, and serving high-quality coffee consistently shouldn’t be one of them. That’s where a bean to cup coffee brewer comes in. Unlike traditional coffee machines that rely on pre-ground coffee, a bean to cup brewer grinds fresh beans for every cup, ensuring optimal flavor, aroma, and freshness in every serving.

For cafés and restaurants, consistency is key. Customers expect the same quality in every cup they order, and a bean to cup coffee brewer delivers that consistency effortlessly. These machines are designed for high-volume usage, making them perfect for busy cafés, hotel coffee bars, and corporate office setups. With automated features such as precise grinding, dosing, and brewing, baristas can focus on customer service rather than manually preparing each cup.

Commercial environments also demand efficiency. A bean to cup coffee brewer reduces preparation time and minimizes wastage. Since the machine grinds and brews only the required amount for each serving, you avoid excess coffee grounds and save costs in the long run. Many machines also come with multiple beverage options—espresso, cappuccino, latte, and more—which is ideal for offices or cafés with diverse customer preferences.

Maintenance and reliability are crucial in commercial settings. Top-quality bean to cup coffee brewers are built to withstand continuous use while ensuring easy cleaning and servicing. This means minimal downtime, fewer maintenance headaches, and a longer lifespan for the machine. For businesses, this translates into uninterrupted service, happy customers, and higher revenue potential.

Another major advantage is training efficiency. Staff in cafés, hotels, or office cafeterias can operate a bean to cup coffee brewer with minimal training compared to traditional espresso machines. Automated settings handle most of the complex variables, so even temporary or new staff can serve excellent coffee quickly.

In commercial offices, these machines also encourage employee satisfaction and productivity. Offering freshly brewed coffee on-demand improves workplace morale and can even enhance creativity and focus. In hotels, having a bean to cup coffee brewer in the breakfast area or lounge elevates the guest experience, leaving a lasting impression.

Ultimately, investing in a bean to cup coffee brewer is about combining quality, efficiency, and consistency for commercial applications. It allows your business to serve premium coffee effortlessly while reducing operational challenges and costs.

For businesses looking to upgrade their coffee operations, Kaapi Machines is a trusted partner. They provide a wide range of commercial coffee equipment, including bean to cup coffee brewers, specifically designed for high-volume environments like cafés, hotels, and offices. Kaapi Machines also partners with 20+ brands to ensure clients receive the best-in-class equipment and support for every commercial setup.
