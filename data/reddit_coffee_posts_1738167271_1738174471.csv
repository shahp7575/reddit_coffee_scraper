1id0dhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/awakened/comments/1id0dhp/stranger_friends_like_these/,Stranger Friends Like These,"This is the second alarm. The first was turned off before Dave found himself in another dream, this time at a buffet, piling his plate full. He was on the way to his first bite before discovering himself, once again, in bed, squinting and fumbling with a noisy screen.

Who remembers how to turn these things off?

He swipes, and swipes again, and it just keeps going. He taps. The screen falls to his face. Sitting up now, still struggling, then finally, silence. Monday morning apparently. 6:18.

Whatever was on that plate at the buffet a moment ago will never be seen again. He wonders to himself if he should quit. 6:20.

Alright, fine.

He sits up and over on the edge of his bed, wiping at his eyes before stretching. Then bathroom duties. Closet duties. Kitchen,  breakfast, coffee, now the train. 

Are all these people going through the same symphony of Monday Morning Misery? Well, perhaps. Their faces don't show it if so. Someone smiles at a screen. Another, bewildered, before nodding to agree with theirs.

On Dave's screen is a playlist. He skips to the next song, waiting for the coffee to match an energizing beat. He taps his foot as thoughts reflect again on the buffet, and quitting, then vacation. That's it. He'll take time off and try Vegas. Then as the train eases into the next station, he sees her, and she sees him too.

Suddenly Monday isn't so bad after all.

Whatever this Symphony is, Dave is okay with it, because he isn't alone. He wasn't alone before. Happy, actually, as well as anyone can be.

Now though, he isn't alone in the way one feels when meeting the abrupt chaos of the ordinary, waking up from a dream. Here's someone else, her smiling eyes, a moment of a glance and familiar comfort to affirm: me too.

She disappears into the shuffling dance of passengers.

Now my uni is back in session and I have so many assignments and notes. I’m supposed to start my internship in two days and today start my student ambassador program. I’ve got many responsibilities and even though all I want is to cry and lay in bed, I can’t. Many people who have studied abroad and the uni staff suggested being busy to help with the sadness of being back. Then there’s a lot going on in my personal life. But I’m tired all the time and I’m constantly taking naps. 

So I’m wondering if y’all have any tips for staying energized. Coffee doesn’t make me energetic and I’ve been told that consistently drinking energy drinks on my meds can be dangerous. Is there something that works for y’all?? ",1,1738174306.0,bipolar2,0,1.0,False

I recently got a used Philips Incanto HD8911 and have been troubleshooting an issue with the steam function. Steam or hot water is not coming out of the wand but is escaping inside the machine. I do hear clicks when I press steam and I also see steam andd hot water filling up my drip tray so it's seems like it's working but it's just not pumping to the wand.

Here’s what I’ve done so far:

1. Checked the Steam Function – When I press steam, I hear the boiler working, but steam escapes inside instead of coming out of the wand.


2. Removed and Cleaned the Brew Group – No change.


3. Opened the Machine & Found a Valve – Steam was escaping from what looks like a distribution valve inside. (Like in the video)


4. Removed & Cleaned the Valve – Soaked it in descaling solution, checked for blockages, and reinstalled it. Still no steam from the wand.

What could be the issue here? I've never fixed a coffee machine before but so far I'm loving working on this and I hope it won't be a big issue. Any advice would be much appreciated. ",1,1738174221.0,ifixit,0,1.0,False

I (23F) have been dating a guy (23M) for about 5 months now. It started as a casual hookup but as things progressed we both caught feelings and had a talk around the 3 month mark about being exclusive and making things official after winter break (we’re in the same masters program). We started treating each other as bf/gf ever since then. Winter break was fine, we did long distance but texted and talked on the phone very often. Upon returning we exchanged Christmas gifts and he got me something very traditional and representative o his home country.

We’ve been back for about a week and last weekend we had a talk about us. Turns out he’s been having doubts about making things official as I’m graduating this may and he still has one more year and we are still not sure about what the future will bring or where we will end up working at. During winter break I also had my time to think about it and was also worried because I wasn’t 100% sure if committing to a relationship with so much uncertainty in our lives was the right thing to do. Thus, after that talk we agreed to keep dating, being exclusive and focus on the present and our careers for now. 

I thought everything was clear and fine until yesterday. We go to a big state school and I have friends in different postgraduate programs. One of them reached out to me and invited me to get a coffee. Turns out one of his friends saw the guy I’ve been dating on Tinder and matched with him earlier yesterday. After this I talked to the guy, told him what was brought up to my attention and he admitted using tinder occasionally when he's “bored” but never actually going on dates or meeting up with anyone. He recognized it was fucked up but insisted he only downloads it every once in a while, swipes for a bit and then deletes it again. I know he hasn’t met up with anyone because our master’s program is so demanding we are constantly busy and studying together. However, I don’t think “swiping on tinder because I’m bored” makes any sense. He said he doesn’t want to lose me and will delete it forever but idk if I can trust him after this. To me it is about respect and trust but also we are not officially bf and gf so AIO?",2,1738174116.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False
1id09mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1id09mq/cold_tolerance_is_my_postcovid_superpower/,Cold tolerance is my post-covid superpower,"I'm not even sure if this is related to covid, but it showed up after a rebound infection. I'm wondering if anyone else has noted something similar. I'm a 62F.

I had covid in the fall of '23 for a couple of weeks, and had a fever pretty much the whole time. I was home in bed sick, not hospital sick. When the weather started to cool once I was better, I noticed that I felt better somehow when I was physically cold. My temperature was back to normal, which is around 36.3.

I normally loathe being cold but I've become one of those annoying people who wear shorts and tank tops outside in -20 Celsius. I do not shiver or get goosebumps since this has started. My fingertips ache when I touch something cold, so I am careful to wear gloves. My body doesn't register that it's cold in a normal way. If my arm is cold to touch and I bend my arm, I get a message from my upper arm that it is touching something cold, and a message from my lower arm that it too is touching something cold. Somehow they don't register that they themselves are cold.

I'm quite happy at normal indoor temperatures but cold feels so good now. It's been a nippy winter, so I am loving the -20 C. I was shocked to find how wonderful falling snow feels on exposed skin. I may be becoming a malamute.

We no longer have a long covid clinic in town. I did see Internal Medicine six months ago or so, who did not care for my post covid theory, took lots of blood, and said they would contact me if anything was abnormal. That was six months ago, and no further word from them. I did just have an MRI of my head, just to be sure there's nothing weird going on. 

I don't like warm drinks or even warm food really anymore. I also went from being a lifelong coffee addict to not knowing or desiring coffee in any way. It's like the coffee part of my brain was surgically removed. I make myself cold tea, which sounds disgusting but keeps me going. 

As symptoms go, it's not serious, it's just weird. Very weird. I'd be interested to hear from kindred spirits. ",1,1738174096.0,covidlonghaulers,0,1.0,False

1id07i5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1id07i5,My border terrier will not. Stop. Tugging. Help!,"I do not mean lead tugging. I mean insisting on ‘tug of war’ style tugging on literally everything.

My husband and I have a very loving, sweet border terrier. She is just shy of 1 year 3 months and we got her around 7 months. Pics to remind myself she is actually a joy overall and not just a naughty demon of energy.

Just to give you an idea of her day, her routine is:

- Husband lets her out of her crate around 7:30am
- She has breakfast, runs round the garden etc, then we walk her at 8am for 25 mins
- I spend another half hour with her
- Goes into her crate for a nap at 9am
- Take her out of crate around 11am, let into the garden to do her thing for 15 mins whilst we make coffee, then she chills alone until 12.30pm
- Walked at 12.30pm for 45 mins
- Sleeps in crate from 1.30am until around 4.30/5pm
- I get her up and spend an hour playing or training (tug of war, ball in garden, free work - whatever she seems into that day)
- Fed 6pm
- Walked for 30 mins
- Chills with us for rest of evening (interspersed with play and training as she seems up for)
- Crated overnight at 9pm

We didn’t used to do the morning crate nap, but a doggy behaviourist at our puppy training classes said she needed more sleep than just a 3-hour nap in the afternoon. This dog has NO CHILL atm which… lol teenage terrier amirite? So wouldn’t sleep left to her own devices. So she now gets 2 crated naps, morning and afternoon.

I have had 2 terriers previously, one border. I absolutely know that tug of war/chewing/tugging in general is their instinctual behaviour from hunts. I do not want to try to ‘train’ this instinct out of her - I simply want to channel it into appropriate items (i.e. her toys).

HOWEVER. I am really struggling at the moment. She is constantly going for the blanket on the sofa, the blanket over her crate, her bed, the actual sofa, just to tug. I think she essentially wants the endless feeling of tugging on something in her mouth and a stationary object like a sofa is IDEAL. It is soft, it doesn’t move, meaning she can tug to her little doggy heart’s delight. I absolutely think it’s also an attention thing as I never come down to the blankets on the floor… she only tugs on those when I am in the room, and generally when I’m actually sat on the sofa.

I have been dealing with this for the last few months by leaving the room every single time she starts on something she’s not meant to. Then coming in with a toy, praising her when she engages in tug with the toy, and then playing with her with the toy. My logic is she will eventually realise that toys get her playtime/attention and unwanted objects do not…

However, both my husband and I have been doing this a few months now and she STILL immediately goes for the sofa when I sit down on it. She STILL goes for the blanket on the crate when we’re eating dinner. She STILL tugs the blanket on the sofa when we’re watching TV. I leave, come back and try to engage her with another toy but often she just doesn’t. Want. The toy. She wants the sofa and only the sofa!

I’m kind of like… AM I actually doing the right thing if this is having little impact over months? Should I be doing something different?

I have tried to teach her ‘leave it’ with treats but she is so clever that all it does is create a behaviour loop - she is smart enough to understand that if she does bad thing and stops doing it she will get a treat, even when I add behaviours to break up the loop (so she wouldn’t get the treat right away, I get her to give her paw or some other trained behaviour for the treat). She’s the kind of dog where treats are great for teaching an active behaviour (sit, down, paw) but not for a ‘leave it’ or any other kind of negative action.

So… help! Am I doing the right thing? Will this consistency pay off when she’s not a naughty teen anymore??

Also I’m 24 weeks pregnant so please be kind even if we are clearly doing the wrong thing 😭",2,1738173952.0,DogAdvice,1,1.0,False

This is a new, more streamlined version. I'm at 50 CNR/rejections and 0 requests, so any feedback or tips on improving my approach are greatly appreciated. As someone with no professional writing credentials, I know it's a long shot, just thought I'd pique interest for at least one request by now.

Dear \[Agent\], 

Alex is a “puller”—a rare individual who can see the memories of others simply by touch, a skill he'd once hoped to use for good. But that hope ended when he pulled the demented mind of a serial killer one year ago, causing a mental breakdown and sending him into seclusion. Now he works in an isolated office for his brother’s company, slowly trying to recover his mental strength and find meaning in a life burdened by the many dark memories he’s collected over the years. 

But then strange things start happening around him—an employee who was thought to be dead reappears on late night surveillance footage, and a mysterious flash drive filled with sensitive information from a rival company shows up on his desk. When a friend is kidnapped for ransom, targeting his brother’s business, he springs into action to track down the perpetrator, searching the minds of the people around him as he follows the trail of a sinister force working in Manhattan. What he sees leads to an unnerving revelation: he may not be the only one involved with a special ability—and to stop them, he’ll need to push his skill further than he ever has before.

PULL is an 80,000-word psychological thriller with speculative elements, blending twisty psychological suspense in a tone similar to A.J. Finn’s *The Woman in the Window* with grounded speculative elements concerning memory akin to Blake Crouch’s *Recursion,* in an immersive world that sees Alex walk through memories like the characters of *Inception* walk through dreams.

I work as an Emmy-nominated sound designer and film composer, shaping and elevating the stories of others, an immersive storytelling skill I bring to my own writing.

Please find the first \[300 words\] below for your perusal. Thank you sincerely for your time and consideration.

\---

I used to use my ability for good.

But on a fog-stained morning one year ago, they called me in again. After I’d told them I was done, I was never doing it again. But how can these detectives resist? What’s better than a human lie detector—is a puller. Someone who can see what other people have seen, know what they know. Someone who can get them answers.

I opened the door to the observation room, dimly lit, the acrid smell of burnt coffee and frustration hanging in the air. Standing in front of the window, Bill turned to me and lit up like a Christmas tree. “Alex, thank God!”

I kept my weight on my back foot, studying his face, waiting. He looked disheveled, the dark circles under his eyes creased by a long night of no results. He pointed through the glass into the interrogation room.

“Look, you gotta help us,” he said. “This perv, Drake, kidnapped three kids up in Albany. We didn’t find them with him when we brought him in. Has them kept away somewhere.”

I could tell he wanted to grab my shoulders in desperation.

“You gotta do your thing, Alex,” he said.

“I told you, I’m not doing that anymore.”

“It’s *kids*, Alex. If we don’t get a location from him, they could die.”

I looked at the man sitting at the table in the interrogation room. Stringy brown hair, stubble, dirt. A rat. Large and menacing, yet slight and brittle. He stared lock-lipped at the detective sitting across from him, an unhinged look in his eyes.

I wasn’t going near that guy.

“No.”

“Alex.”

Bill raised his hand to reach for my shoulder. I flinched, edging back. He caught himself, remembering, and lowered his hand.

“We’re not getting anywhere,” he continued. “If you don’t help us, those kids are as good as dead.”",1,1738173946.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False
1id07ay,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1id07ay/i_need_to_lose_3040_lbs_of_mostly_fat_in_4_months/,I need to lose 30-40 lbs of mostly fat in 4 months.,"I’ve been fat a majority of my life (I’m 19) and have tried to lose weight but always ended up caving, I stuck to carnivore for awhile and I’m back on it now. So I’ve been doing carnivore and eating 1 carnivore meal a day since June 27th and it’s almost January. During the months of October - December I stopped doing carnviore and started to eat like normal. From June 27th to October 1st the lowest weight I got to was 198 lbs. I originally weighed 240 lbs. That weight was lost without exercise. Starting January first I decided to do carnviore again.

1id06g9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1id06g9/i_hate_this_fake_woman_long/,I hate this fake woman. (Long),"I have been going to this entertainment venue for several years. Last summer we got a new employee, Kevin.  We hit it off pretty well. We had another new employee, let's say AL,  and he brought Mandy with him. 

Al and Mandy had a lot of drama. He would blatantly flirt with other women right in front of her. Then apparently they went somewhere in Texas, and he flat out would make out with other women in front of her. Mandy in her determination would never leave him no matter what he did. 

One day I went to the venue. Mandy was looking for Kevin, but Al was there. She followed poor AL around apologizing. She looked like a stalker. He had to literally turn his back on her. 

Turns out Kevin had to have emergency laparscopic surgery in which some of his intestine were removed. His work is somewhat physical, and he came back after 2 weeks. 

Several time Mandy, K, and I were there she would wait for him to turn around and be busy. She would ask me when I was going to leave, like she was trying to shoo me away. Later I told Kevin, and he nearly accused me of lying. ""She's never like that to me.""

No shit, she wanted to be with him and for me to go away. 

She's really nice and smiling when he and his other coworkers were there. I suspect I get the version of Mandy closer to what AL got. AL claimed she is crazy, but with other people she's on her best behavior. 

K comes back after only 2 weeks of work, and she was asking him to move heavy furniture for her. I heard them talking, and she specifically mentioned that she needed help with heavy stuff. 

This is what made me done with her. When he couldn't hear us, I told her to get someone else to do it. She said she was moving in another 2-3 months. I told this bitch that the surgeon said he needed another surgery. I told her he was in pain. The day before he could barely move. He made like 5 or 6 throws, and he was done. She said he just threw for an hour. 

I told her, if he did that means he took extra pain meds and/or wasn't letting on how much he was in pain. She told me she knew all about recovery because she used to work at a hospital. 

When I met her, she worked at a coffee joint, and now she works at a restaurant. She is in her early 20s. She never said what she did at the hospital, but apparently she's an expert on gi issues! 

I had to take a month from all physical activity after I had a boob job. I felt ok, but I was not allowed to raise my heart rate. This man came back after 2 weeks! Imo it was almost miraculous how active he has been. 

Fast forward a few months. He's throwing up blood again. I guess Dr Mandy was wrong about his recovery. 

I've seen her with another man one time. Now she has made it a habit to invite him to her apartment with me sitting there. Yes! She's bold! I do care about him, but im not gonna fight over a dude esp not situationship. He and I have our own issues, but that's for another thread. We had issues before she came along tbh. 

I hope Mandy can fight because a lot of women will be violent with her. There are some crazy women out there who will open up a can on Mandy even if she's not official with the guy. I'm surprised she has made it this far. 

I get tired of her being fake nice to me. Ugh. If I go off on her, I'll look like the problem. She's nice to me and smiles when Kevin can see her. ",2,1738173882.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

**Blurb:**

**What does it take to turn your life around? Death, of course!** 

I died in this lame ass world of ours and woke up in a completely new one. I had a new name, a new face and a new body. This was my second chance to live a better life than the previous one. 

But goddamn it, why did I have to be a witch? Now I don't just have to be on the run from the Inquisition that wants to burn me and my friends. But I also have to earn a living? 

**Follow Elsa Grimly as she:** 

1. Makes new friends and tries to save them and herself from getting burned
2. Finds redemption from the deeds of her previous life
3. Tries to get along with a cat who (like most cats) believes she runs the world
4. Deals with other slice of life shenanigans

**\_\_**

**Chapter 10. So, are we rich now?**

""Okay,"" Smokewell said, ""Let's talk in a language that I understand. Tell us how many steambolts will you give for that piece of gold.""

Zir'Zulec tapped his chin with a bony finger. ""If I was to buy this from you, I'd offer to buy this for ten thousand steambolts without hesitation.""

For the first time, Smokewell's expression was something I could read by looking--she was shocked. Lily hopped up in joy. ""Yay, we are rich! How about you rattle some coins for us now, Mr. Big Money Lich?""

""Certainly,"" Zir said and raised his hand as if to summon the money out of thin air but Asmod sprang up to snatch the piece of gold from him.

""Later, Zir,"" he said.

The lich stared down at the short man. ""I thought you wanted to sell it.""

""We do, but not yet,"" Asmod said, tossing the piece of golden finger back at me.

""Why not?"" Lily said, her shoulders slouching.

Asmod didn't answer her, he just turned to leave after saying to Zir, ""We'll meet again, old friend. We might have some business to do then.""

Smokewell, Lily and I followed him out of the big office and out into the dining hall again.

""What was that, Asmod?"" Lily put her hands on her hips and knit her eyebrows.

""Yes, what was that?"" Smokewell said, ""I thought I was finally going to see some good money.""

Asmod scoffed as he led us out of the restaurant and back to the surface. ""Trust me, this isn't how you want to make your money,"" he said as we all got into his steam carriage and headed back to his place.

""Is this about ethics and morals, Asmod?"" Smokewell said we entered his apartment. ""Are you mad that we are making money off of some immortal man's bones. Well, that's still not the worse way of making money, you know?""

Asmod shook his head. ""Ethics and morals have nothing to do with this."" He pulled up a chair over to the coffee table and gestured us all to huddle around it. He tossed the piece of gold onto the table and said, ""Didn't you hear what Zir said? That thing is not from this world. You and I know that it isn't from this world. It's not gold but it costs a lot more than gold. And Zir didn't have any problem paying thousands for this little pinkie sized thing. What does it all mean?"" He threw a gaze at each of our faces.

""I'm sorry, does it not mean that we get rich?"" Lily said.

""Yes, you get rich. But at a much higher cost than you get paid,"" Asmod said and leaned further. ""If this thing is so potent and valuable, don't you think it will have people come sniffing for more? All magic leaves behind a trace in some way. If Zir or anyone else uses this thing in something, it is going to leave a trail. Someone will come following that trail. Where is it supposed to lead them?""

""To us,"" I said.

""And you have an entire skeleton made of this thing. What will that lead to?"" Asmod said.

""Whoever comes looking for more will try to take it, possibly by force,"" Smokewell said slowly.

""That's just the appetizer, I'll serve you the dessert right away,"" Asmod said, ""Imagine its the Inquisition who gets a whiff of this thing's existence. They'll come looking for it and find that the skeleton is in the possession of a bunch of witches.""

""Wait, so we aren't going to be getting rich?"" Lily asked.

Asmod sighed. ""You will. I mean you can if you are clever about it. There are hundreds of ways in which you can get caught with this. But there might just be one to actually get away with getting rich quick.""

""Which is?"" Smokewell asked.

Asmod paused and regarded us all with caution before saying, ""You should think of getting your name cleared from the Inquisition's priority burn list.""

Smokewell burst out laughing, rolling around on the couch. ""I knew you were a great enchanter but I didn't know you were just as good at being a jester.""

Asmod wasn't amused. ""Really, Alana?""

The cat stopped laughing to catch her breath. ""Yes, I'm serious. Look at me, Asmod. And I mean take a long, good look at me. I became a cat. I used to be the great Alana Smokewell, aging like fine wine--""

""Not really,"" Lily quickly added.

""And I became a cat. A damn cat, Asmod. Why do you think I did it?"" Smokewell said.

""Because you like back rubs?"" Lily said.

""You like to sleep all day?"" Asmod said.

""No, you fools! It's because it was getting dangerous to live as Alana Smokewell,"" the cat snapped. ""And it wasn't just me but it was the girls I was putting in danger."" She pointed a paw at us. ""They would've been burned by the Inquisition just because they were my apprentices. I would like to believe that I managed to throw them off our trail by killing my human body. But I wouldn't be surprised if the witch hunt is still going on for the girls. Do you think the Inquisition will just clear our names like that?""

""Um, there's a way to clear our name,"" Lily said, nervously rubbing the back of her neck. ""What if we just...come in peace and sign the Regulated Practices Agreement?""

""No,"" Smokewell said in a heartbeat. ""A thousand times no.""

""But--""

""I said no!"" Smokewell snapped.

Lily went silent. Old Elsa's memories told me about the Regulated Practices Agreement. Apparently, the government hadn't completely banned the practice of dark magic. The Agreement was their way of keeping magic users like us in check--which involved placing restrictions on how we practiced our magic. I had a hazy recollection of some witchcraft covens signing the Agreement rather than risk getting burned.

""Is it really a good idea?"" I asked carefully. ""We are always on the run. And if we want to buy a house, we would have to forge new identities. We sure aren't going to be able to sign our real names anywhere.""

The cat's pupils dilated and her back arched. ""No student of mine is going to be a dog on the government's leash,"" she said.

I went quiet.

Asmod let out a sigh and stood up. ""If that isn't an option for you then the second option is you do what Elsa suggested, you forge new identities for yourself and keep living with your heads down.""

""I'll take it,"" Smokewell said, licking her paw.

Lily's body turned stiff, she gripped her skirt as she kept frowning at the floor. ""Wouldn't that mean we'll all retire from...practicing witchcraft?"" she said in a small voice.

""Would you rather get burned, Lily?"" Smokewell said.

""I'd rather be a dog on the government's leash!"" Lily snapped.

The cat stared at the girl silently. This time Lily held her gaze without flinching. Even that wasn't enough for the girl since she decided to speak up. ""You said, you were only giving up the title of a witch, not its practices or spirit. How can you just be ready to 'keep your head down' and forget it?""

The cat's mouth opened. She seemed ready to say something that would've hurt Lily a lot more, so I decided to butt into the conversation. ""Stop before this becomes a full blown argument,"" I said, ""I get it, we don't want to stop being witches, we also want to be rich and we don't want to get burned just for existing. For that, there's a third, more dangerous option we can take.""

""Well?"" Smokewell said, ""If we are going to sit and discuss all the worst ideas, might as well hear you out as well.""

I took a deep breath and started talking.

When I was done, everyone stared at me with wide eyes, pale faces and mouths hanging open.

""Why?"" Asmod said. ""Do you have a death wish, Grimly?""

""No, quite the opposite, in fact."" I grinned.

""But it still sounds dangerous, Miss Elsa,"" Lily said. ""And I mean, we aren't even sure if it will work. And if we fail, we'll all probably die.""

""Let's do it,"" Smokewell said.

Asmod and Lily gawked at the cat. ""You've lost your mind too!"" the man said.

""I'll give Elsa's plan a try before even considering to sign that damn Agreement,"" the cat said.

""So it's settled then,"" I said stretched my back and looked out the window. The sun was slowly rising above the clouds. ""We'll need to do some digging before we put the plan into action. But before that, I'm gonna get some much needed sleep,"" I said and went to get one of the spare mattresses from Asmod's bedroom.

I slept like a baby till the afternoon.

And when I woke up, my head wasn't spinning, nor was it heavy--something that I always felt when I slept (which wasn't very often) and woke up in my previous life. I sat up in the spare mattress I'd rolled up the floor and stretched my back. I looked out the window. The sun was bright in the sky. The clock said it was quarter past two in the afternoon. Lily and Smokewell were still asleep on the mattress next to mine. Asmod was probably downstairs in his shop. This was my chance.

I didn't bother brushing my teeth. I simply grabbed my suitcase and carried it into the empty bedroom and locked the door. The events of last night's dinner and everything that happened flashed into my mind. The things that had happened before that dinner came to my mind. I remembered what I'd felt while riding the steam carriage through the empty streets of Orowen at night.

I knew I didn't want to go back to the world that I had memories of living in. I also knew that it meant I was going to live in a world where the Inquisition existed and I had to be careful to not get caught and burned on a stake. But I also possessed magical powers in this world, for God's sake! I'd seen what heaven was like and summoned a giant ethereal being that spoke to me like a humble servant (he'd also gone on to flatten about fifty people at once cuz he misheard my command, but that was a different matter.)

But that was the thing. I had the power to survive and change things for myself in this world. And with that golden skeleton that we'd retrieved, I was probably going to end up living a comfortable life if I played my cards right. I couldn't have had this chance in my previous life. So the fact that I wanted to be here and live a good life was clear as day to me.

But that meant, I had to become Elsa Grimly to live the life that was practically hers. I also felt like I owed it to her since she was the one who had committed the liberation ritual, which had somehow allowed me to end up as her (and also allowed me to summon that Abyssal form named Yazara En). It would've been a waste if I decided to give up all these oppportunities.

Yes, I wanted to be here and live as Elsa Grimly. But for that, I'd first have to figure out who she was. Which meant uncovering as many of her memories as I could.

So I started to unpack her belongings.

Now, before I start, I’m not mad at him. I just get sad some days. 

He suffers from some kind of migraines. But not your typical ones, like almost mini strokes. I’ve been begging him to go to the doctor for it since the day we met and he won’t go. I’m not sure why. I even offered to take him, so long as he gets the insurance info from his parents (since part of it is him being worried his parents would insist on a “natural” alternative which hasn’t done squat for him). 

Now, these migraines are triggered by anything and everything. I watch carefully about what I get him and eye the ingredients the best I can. He knows his triggers better than i do and I can’t keep track of em all, all I know for sure is certain syrups and anything with MSG. It just gets sucky when I really really really want him to try my drink and he can’t, only if he sips and then spits it out regardless of if he enjoys it. I would love to share my favorite coffees with him and try new soda flavors with him like he loves to do with me. 

Again, I’m not mad at him. He can’t control it. It’s just my TED talk. Wishing he’d actually go and get it checked out so he doesn’t have to watch everything so carefully. ",1,1738173712.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1id029d,https://www.reddit.com/r/karelianbeardog/comments/1id029d/first_serious_kbd_behavioral_problem/,First Serious KBD Behavioral Problem,"Ive got two KBDs. Ive had them since they were 8 weeks old. One (intact male) will be 5 in June and the other (fixed female) will be 3 in April.

Both are excellent dogs. The younger one is a dwarf (originally intended to be a dam, but dwarfism, so fixed). She doesn’t have excellent recall like my older male and will ignore commands when fixated. I can call my male off of anything and he will listen. 

The female NEVER gets off leash outside of the yard because of this issue. She still gets work, but never off leash. I don’t presently believe that will ever change. She’s been given the same training regimen we have used for other dogs but even though I haven’t given up completely, I have accepted that she probably won’t ever be capable of off leash work. 

We live inside a midwestern city, not giant, but not rural. We get our exercise and training in on state forest land regularly (3x a week). But we don’t train in the city aside from infrequent dog park visits and regular walks around the neighborhood.

In my neighborhood, plenty of people walk their dogs. My dogs yip and bark at them when they’re nearby, but that’s it. A few neighbors have brought their dogs to the fence (after asking) so the dogs could get a sniff and 100% of those dogs don’t get barked at anymore when they pass by. 

However, there is this one neighbor that has a black poodle. And my dogs are both VERY interested in it. The owner walks this dog by my house at least three times a day. My male went over the fence at them a few months ago but I had come to the door to investigate the barking and gave him a command. He instantly turned around and came to the door. He didn’t even get halfway to the sidewalk. The dog owner was understandably rattled but got it together and kept walking. 

When this person and their dog pass by my yard, my dogs have a different, more aggressive baying cadence and tone. It doesn’t sound like, “Hi! Please come closer,” it sounds like, “Danger! Danger!”

I am super diligent about keeping an eye on the dogs when they’re in the yard and will instantly bring them in if the barking goes on for more than a couple seconds. But today I made a slip. I put them out first thing in the morning and went about making coffee. A few seconds later, I heard the more-aggressive barking and went to the door. When I opened it, I heard a human yell and saw my younger female had got out of the yard and was within a meter of this person and their dog across the street from my house. I ran over and collected my dog and brought her back in. The dog owner was rightfully indignant and read me the riot act. I knew it was my fault and absorbed it. I asked her if she saw where my dog came from and she told me (i found the spot and plugged it, this cant happen again).

But I cannot determine what it is about this particular person and their dog. Both of KBDs are well socialized and are safe and friendly to strange dogs. But there is something about this black poodle that sets them off. And in my morning haze, I failed to prevent a confrontation. I’m 100% responsible. My dog didn’t physically attack the owner or dog, but she aggressively approached them and Im sure the owner felt like they were about to be attacked. 

Has anyone else ever seen their KBD hold a grudge against a particular dog they regularly see but have never met? Is there anything that I can do aside from maybe getting a taller fence and more strictly timing their yard visits to when this particular dog has already gone by?

I got a real Karen vibe off this lady, but I don’t really know. All I can say is that if I were scared of a dog in my neighborhood, then I certainly would not walk by that dog’s yard anymore. But this lady has had two incidents in the exact same spot just a few months apart, yet still comes by every single day multiple times. ",1,1738173616.0,karelianbeardog,0,1.0,False

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Planning a getaway for Memorial Day weekend can be exciting, but it also requires careful thought to ensure your trip is enjoyable and memorable. Here are some essential tips that will help you design a perfect escape.

### Start Planning Early

Memorial Day weekend is a popular time for travel. To avoid last-minute stress, start planning at least a month in advance. This gives you ample time to find the best accommodations and deals on flights, trains, or car rentals.

### Choose the Right Destination

Consider what type of vacation you want. Are you looking for a beach getaway, a mountain retreat, or perhaps a city adventure? Research popular destinations that align with your interests. Some top choices for Memorial Day weekend include:

- **Beach Locations:** Florida, California, Hawaii
- **Mountain Escapes:** Colorado, Montana, North Carolina
- **Urban Experiences:** New York City, San Francisco, New Orleans

Select a destination that resonates with your vibe to ensure an enjoyable experience.

### Set a Budget

Before you dive into bookings, outline a budget. This should include travel, staying costs, meals, entertainment, and any other expenses. Sticking to a budget helps prevent overspending and allows you to enjoy your trip without financial stress.

### Plan Activities in Advance

While spontaneity is fun, planning some activities ahead can be beneficial, especially for popular attractions that may require reservations. Research local events and festivals happening over the holiday weekend. Here are some options:

- Outdoor concerts and music festivals
- Local parades and ceremonies
- Historical tours and nature hikes

Make a list of must-see places and things to do, and also include some backup options in case your primary choices are crowded or booked up.

### Pack Smart

What you pack depends on your destination and activities planned. Create a packing list based on the weather, and include essentials like:

- Clothing suitable for outdoor activities
- Beach gear, including sunscreen and swimsuits if heading to the coast
- Comfortable shoes for exploring
- Snacks for the journey

Packing smartly keeps you organized and ready for anything your trip might throw at you.

### Consider Travel Insurance

Travel insurance is often overlooked, but it can save you from a headache if things don’t go as planned. Whether it’s a canceled flight or unexpected medical expenses, having coverage provides peace of mind during your getaway.

### Be Flexible

Traveling around a holiday can come with unexpected issues, like traffic or last-minute changes in plans. Keep a flexible mindset, and be ready to adapt. This outlook can turn what could be a frustrating situation into a fun adventure. Just go with the flow!

### Enjoy Some Time for Relaxation

While planning activities and experiences is essential, don’t forget to carve out time for relaxation. Maybe read a book on the beach, or enjoy a leisurely brunch in a charming café. Taking time to unwind can enhance your overall travel experience.

### Connect with Locals

Meeting locals can provide insights you won’t find in travel guides. Ask them about their favorite spots to visit, dining recommendations, or hidden gems. Not only will you enhance your trip, but you’ll also create meaningful connections along the way.

### Document Your Memories

Remember to capture memories as you travel. Take photos or keep a travel journal. This can not only help you reminisce but can also inspire your future trips.

With these essential tips, you’ll be well-equipped to plan a memorable Memorial Day weekend getaway. Enjoy every moment of this special time and create lasting memories!

### Conclusion

Memorial Day weekend is the perfect opportunity to embark on an adventure, create lasting memories, and kick-start the summer season. Whether you choose to explore the breathtaking Rocky Mountains, relax on the sunny beaches of Florida, delve into the vibrant culture of New Orleans, enjoy the stunning landscapes of the Pacific Northwest, or embrace the charm of historic cities like Boston, each destination offers unique experiences that cater to every traveler’s interests.

To ensure a memorable getaway, planning is essential. Start by considering transportation options and accommodations early to secure the best deals. Create a flexible itinerary that allows you to explore highlights while also leaving time for relaxation and spontaneous adventures. Don’t forget to check the weather and pack accordingly, and have a backup plan in case your first choice isn’t feasible.

Involving the whole family in the planning process can also enhance the excitement and make everyone feel part of the adventure. Engaging everyone in activities that appeal to their interests fosters connection and enhances the overall experience. As Memorial Day approaches, take the time to reflect on what you hope to achieve from your getaway. Is it family bonding, adventure, relaxation, or cultural exploration?

Ultimately, the best places to travel for Memorial Day weekend are not just about the locations but also about the joy of shared experiences and the memories created along the way. So gather your loved ones, pack your bags, and get ready to make this Memorial Day weekend unforgettable!

First, I asked ChatGPT to tell me what themes fair foundation shade names fit into, and two of the themes were:

1. Natural Elements (Delicate & Ethereal References) - Inspired by naturally occurring materials and soft imagery.

Examples: Ivory, Alabaster, Porcelain, Pearl, Snow, Frost

2. Luxurious & Refined (Classic & Elegant) - Names that evoke sophistication and prestige.

Examples: Shell, Silk, Lace, Cream, Cashmere

Then I asked it to generate some names for darker shades with the same themes. At first it just gave a bunch of food items, but after being prompted again, it generated:

Natural Elements (Ethereal, Earthy, and Celestial Inspired)

Obsidian Veil, Obsidian, Bronzed Horizon, Ember Twilight, Ember, Sienna Aurora, Sienna, Terracotta Eclipse, Umber Storm, Umber, Golden Eos, Sepia Solstice, Sepia, Duskstone, Dusk, Sable Moon, Sable, Horizon, Terra, Eclipse, Solstice.

Luxurious & Refined (Fine Materials, Soft Textures, and Prestige Inspired)

Velvet Onyx, Velour, Gilded Terra, Gilded, Satin Ember, Bronzed Silk, Ebon Mirage, Mirage, Sable Cashmere, Sable, Midnight Suede, Suede, Regal Sepia, Regal, Lustrous Umber, Imperial Dune, Lustre, Eos, Nocturne.


I honestly love these names! What do you guys think? Any creative minds have other ideas?",1,1738173470.0,MakeupAddiction,1,1.0,False

Sivik, UN Citizen

Date [Standardized Human Time]: January 27, 2137

“Um, Doctor Torres, can I ask you something a bit strange?” I fidgeted with my paws uncomfortably. 

“Of course, Sivik, this is a safe place.”

“I’m not quite sure how to phrase this without sounding insane, but… how do I know if a memory is real?”

“Are you worried you are having false memories?” 

I sighed. “Just one. You remember my friend, Tivel, the one who died?” I felt myself choking up slightly. 

“Of course, what about him?” He looked at me over his notepad. I still found it a bit strange that he preferred paper over a digital pad.

“Well, about a week ago I was with Telif-”

“-Your Arxur friend, correct?” 

“Yeah, him. Anyway the two of us were getting a bath together.” I thought I briefly saw his eyebrow raise at that but he quickly went back to a neutral expression, so I continued. “Anyway um, I told you before I felt guilty getting close to him because of how Tivel died, but while we were together I, um, okay, this might sound a bit crazy, but I could swear I heard Tivel’s voice telling me to remember something, but I wasn’t sure what he wanted me to remember.”

“I don’t think that sounds weird at all. It’s quite common to hear a person's voice when you’re remembering something they told you.”

“I know, but why would he tell me to remember something, instead of just the thing I am supposed to remember if it was something real? How do I know I’m not just making something up in my head to make myself feel better about falling in love with an Arxur when they killed the only friend I had before I came to Earth?”

*Huh, I don’t think I’ve ever admitted he was more than just my bunkmate out loud before. Was I that ashamed? I’m so sorry, Tivel. You deserved better than me.*

“Memories can be tricky. Sometimes we block things out because they’re too painful to remember. Sometimes we invent memories to make ourselves feel better.” He leaned forward. “Sivik, I haven’t known you long, but from what you’ve told me you don’t mince words and you don’t forgive yourself easily. Do you think you would make something up just to feel better? Or do you think it’s more likely you didn’t want to remember it because you thought it would lessen your guilt, and you didn’t want to let yourself off easy?”

“That, um, that actually makes sense.” I scratched the scar behind my ear. “Um, can I tell you the memory then you can tell me if it sounds real?”

“Of course, I told you you can tell me anything. I’m here to help you.” He smiled softly. 

“Thank you. The details are still a bit fuzzy, but I think some more have been coming back to me. This was about a week or so before the raid that took his life.” *Don’t you mean before you took his life?* “We, um, we were talking and out of nowhere he asks me if I think Arxur are capable of compassion. I remember being taken aback by his question. Even thinking something like that was cause for a predator disease screening.” I saw disgust on the doctor's face at the mention of predator disease. “Sorry, I know you think that stuff is nonsense.”

“My apologies, it's just upsetting to me how poor the Federation’s understanding of mental health is, but it is not your fault. Please continue.”

“Yeah um, like I was saying we’re just sitting there talking and he asks me this out of nowhere. Now at the time I didn’t know better so of course I told him no. They only want to hurt and kill us. If they were capable of compassion why would they torture and eat us? You know, stuff like that.” I chuckled slightly at my old self. “I say all this shit, and Tivel just goes ‘I think they are’. I should have stopped him there before someone heard us. I mean, a commanding officer could have come in for inspection at any moment, but I was curious and asked him why he thought that. That’s when he tells me something he said he’d never told anyone before.” I took a deep breath. “You see, unlike me, Tivel wasn’t born on Venlil Prime. He spent the first few cycles of his life on a small colony world near the edge of Venlil space. When he was about seven cycles old there was a raid on his colony. He was at home with Sayka and Vekes, his mom and dad, when they heard the sirens go off. They lived in a poorer neighborhood that was far from the bunkers, so they figured their best bet was to try and hide at home and hope if they made it look like they evaced they would be passed over. So they tossed a bunch of shit on the ground and left the door open before hiding. Tivel and his mom hid in a closet in his parents room. His dad didn’t fit so he decided to hide in a cupboard in the kitchen. I guess he figured he wouldn’t make it, because Tivel said the last thing he remembers Vekes saying was how much he loved both of them. A few claws pass and the screaming and gunfire outside starts to calm down, so they start thinking they made it. That’s when they hear the front door slam open and the sound of two Arxur talking.” 

I was starting to have trouble talking as I felt the tears coming. I’d never met Vekes, but I knew how much Tivel loved him, and how hard it was for him to tell me this. 

“It’s okay,” Doctor Torres said gently. “You don’t have to continue today.” 

“N-no, I want to. Just.” I took a breath and counted to ten. “Just needed a moment. So they hear the two Arxur and immediately one of them says it smells fear and he hears his dad start screaming. One of the Arxur is laughing and asking him where the rest of his family is, since it doesn’t want him to die alone. Vekes is telling them they are at the bunker. That they were already gone when he got home. The one holding his dad tells its partner to check the rest of the house to make sure he’s really alone. They hear its claws on the ground as it approaches the room. Sayka is trying to keep herself from sobbing thinking the two of them are dead. She whispers to Tivel to close his eyes and that she loves him. He closes his eyes and they hear footsteps getting closer to the closet. The door opens but they’re both so scared they can’t even scream. He said he knew he shouldn’t have, but he wanted to see his mom one last time so he opens his eyes and the Arxur is just staring at them. It doesn’t look hungry, it just looks sad. His partner calls from the kitchen asking if it found anyone. Tivel is sure this is the end, but instead it shouts that the rest of the house is empty, and closes the closet door. Tivel and Sayka spent almost a whole day in that closet thinking it was some sort of trap. Some sick game to give them false hope. But it wasn’t. Tivel asked me if they can’t feel then why did it spare him and his mom? You know what I fucking said to him?” The doctor shook his head. “I said it probably just wasn’t hungry and didn’t want to waste food. He pours his fucking heart out to me and that’s all I fucking say. He said maybe that was true, but he still felt bad for it. They killed his dad, and he feels sorry for it because it might have felt bad about it.” Tears were pouring down my face at this point. “That’s why I think I made this up. Why wouldn’t I remember Tivel telling me about how his own fucking dad died and how he was spared by an Arxur until I fell in love with one? Am I really that bad of a friend?” I wiped the tears from my face and looked up at Doctor Torres. “So, what do you think? Did I just make this up to make myself feel better?”

The doctor paused for a moment. Clearly thinking of a way to try and convince me that making up some sob story about my dead friend so I could justify loving Telif didn’t make me a monster. 

*Just fucking say it already. Tell me I don’t deserve to be loved.* 

“Why don’t you ask his mom if that happened?”

I stared blankly at him. “What?”

“Why don’t you ask his mom? You said she was there. If it happened she would remember it. So why don’t you just ask her?”

“What?” I repeated as I stared at him slack jawed. “Just ask her? How can I just ask her?”

“You said before that the two of you lived next to each other on Venlil Prime and that’s how you met. Why don’t you go ask?”

“It’s not that simple!” I protested. 

“Why not? Do you think she moved? If so, those records should be public. You could look up her new address, or just her contact information and give her a call.”

“No, she didn’t move,” I hissed. “But why would she want to see me?”

“Why wouldn’t she? You said you spent a lot of time there growing up. I’m sure she would love to catch up.”

“Yeah, when I was a pup, but I haven’t spoken to her in over a decade. There’s no way she wants to talk to me.”

“Why not?” 

“Because I’m the asshole who got her son killed!” I practically shouted. “The same asshole who didn’t even show up to his fucking funeral because I couldn’t look her in the fucking eyes. Would you want to see me if you were her?”

“Maybe, maybe not, but you’ll never know if you don’t try, and I think you could both use the closure.”

*Stars fucking dammit why do humans always have to make so much fucking sense? Fuckers.*

“But if I talk to her she’ll tell my parents, and I haven’t spoken to them since I came to Earth.”

“Why haven’t you? You said they tried their best raising you in our past talks and that you still love them.”

“Because I don’t want them to know what kind of monster their son is,” I whispered. “Look at me. I stick out like a loose Gojid quill. Some metal-armed freak who’s dating the species our entire planet hates.”

“You know, you don’t have to tell them you’re in a relationship with an Arxur, right?”

*STOP PICKING APART MY EXCUSES.*

I shoved my face into my arm and screamed for a moment before talking again. “Fine, you’re right, but I can’t go alone. I’m-I’m not ready for that.”

“Then why don’t you bring Jacob? Humans are allowed on Venlil Prime and I’m sure he would be happy to go with you, based on everything you’ve told me.”

*I want to headbutt you so fucking bad right now.* “That’s a good idea…”

“Glad you think so. I think talking to Sayka and your parents will be a good healing experience for you.”

“But what if they all hate me?” I whimpered.

“Then you still have your new family. Nothing can take that away from you, but do you want to live the rest of your life wondering about it?”

“No,” I grumbled. “This therapy shit is so annoying, you know that?”

He chuckled. “Yes, I get that a lot. We have a few minutes left, is there anything else you wanted to talk about today?”

“Um, yes actually. I think I told you before I got a new job. Well, I start tomorrow and I’m worried about having to hide my true self all day. I don’t know if I can do that again…”

“Then don’t,” he stated.

“What do you mean ‘don’t’?! I’m going to be working with herbivores again! They won’t want to be around someone like me!”

“You said they’re all herbivores that are willing to help humans and Arxur, why wouldn’t they want to be around you? It sounds like you have something in common already.”

“But what if they think I’m a freak? What if they all talk about me behind my back like my classmates and fellow soldiers did?”

“Tell your boss. You’re an adult and they’re your coworkers not your friends. There is never an excuse for that kind of behavior and humans don’t tolerate hostile work environments.”

“Do you know how frustrating it is when you just point out the obvious all the time,” I hissed.

“If it’s so obvious why didn’t you think of it?” He smiled. “Anyway our time is about up, but I don’t have any other appointments today if you want to talk more.” 

“No, I need to get home.” I hopped up from the couch. “I um, I want to go see my boyfriend and I need to ask Jacob if he’ll go on a trip with me next weekend.”

“In that case, have a great rest of your day.” He smiled that annoying smile at me.

~*~

“So why didn’t you tell us about this earlier?” Jacob said as he shoveled a spoonful of potatoes into his mouth.

“I um, I wasn’t sure if I just made up the memory to make myself feel better about being with Telif,” I replied sheepishly. “When I first remembered it during our bath it seemed so real, but the more I thought about it it felt more and more like just some stupid dream. Does that make sense?”

“I guess.” Jacob scratched his chin. “My memory is garbage though so I’ve never really trusted it. That’s why I write everything important down.”

Telif didn’t say anything, he just stared down at his plate. “Telif?” I put my hand on his paw. “Are you okay?”

“You feel bad about being with me?” His voice was shaking.

*Fucking dammit Sivik, can you do anything right?*

***Just be honest with him. He’ll understand. Telif always understands.***

“Telif, please look at me.” He held up his head and I could see he was trying not to cry. “Telif, I love you more than anything, and that’s the truth, but I would be lying if I said I didn’t feel a little guilty about it.” The tears were starting to form. “Hey, let me finish before you cry.”

“Okay…” he whispered.

“I didn’t tell you at the time because I was worried you would think I was a monster, but Tivel wasn’t just a fellow soldier. He was my first real friend. He was the only person who was always nice to me. Killing him is the worst thing I have ever done in my life, and I don’t think I can ever completely forgive myself for it. The only thing that kept me going in some of the darkest moments of my life was my hatred for the Arxur, so when I started falling in love with you it felt like I was betraying his memory. Telif, before I met you the only thing I felt most days was anger. Honestly I don’t even think you being an Arxur was the biggest issue. I think I was just mad at myself for feeling happy.”

“So you’re not ashamed of me?”

I could feel myself starting to cry again. “Telif,” I wrapped my arms around him. “I don’t even deserve you, how could I ever be ashamed of you?” His breathing was still a bit ragged as he tried to stop his own tears, so I hugged him tighter. “Please believe me that I love you more than anything.”

“I believe you… I’m sorry.” He sniffled. “I love you too.”

I pulled back from the hug and kissed him like in one of the cheesy romance movies Alex used to love. 

“Dawwwwww.” 

“Annnnnnd there goes the moment,” Telif grumbled. “Can you behave for once in your life?” 

“I’m sorry, you two are just so fucking cute.” Jacob tried to sneakily wipe a tear from his own eye.

*For such a pain, he really is a softie deep down. Guess that’s why he can’t stop inviting any alien who’s ever been sad to live with him.* 

“Sorry if this is out of nowhere, but thank you for everything, Jacob,” I said.

“Huh? I’m being thanked for being annoying?” 

“No, just you’ve done so much for me I don’t think I can ever pay it back.”

“Then don’t.” He shrugged. “I don’t do shit expecting somethin’ in return.”

“You know Jacob hates when you’re nice to him,” Telif laughed as he wiped his own eyes dry. “He has to pretend he doesn’t care about us because he knows he’s actually the nicest person ever.”

“Ugh gross stop.” Jacob fake gagged. 

“He’s right, you’re the sweetest guy I’ve ever met. Not even Telif can compare.”

“Stooooooop.” Jacob held his hands to his ears. “You know I hate compliments.”

“Then let me show my boyfriend how much I love him without your commentary.” I kissed Telif again before chuckling as I saw Jacob resist the urge to be a pain in our ass. 

“Fineeee just stop being so cute. I can’t handle it.”

“Sorry, not possible,” Telif replied smugly. “Sivik can’t stop being cute even if he tries.”

I pushed him slightly. “You’re one to talk.”

“I’m going to do it again if you two don’t stop right this second,” Jacob groaned.

“Fine, fine, but only because I have a favor to ask you,” I giggled.

“Oh? What’s up?” 

“WillyougotoVenlilPrimewithme,” I blurted out before I could convince myself to back out.

“Yeah of course, why though?”

“I want to go see Sayka. To ask her if my memory is real, and to apologize like I should have all those years ago.” I took a deep breath. “And to see my parents and ask if they still love me.”

“Yeah I can do that, when we goin’? Do I need a passport for space? I’ve never been.”

“Wait really?” He shook his head. “I forgot humanity just barely left their solar system. And I was planning to go this weekend if that’s alright.”

“I don’t have shit planned. You gonna be fine on your own for a day or so Tel?” 

“I’m a grown man. I can handle a day without you two,” Telif hissed. 

“Okay but don’t watch anything too scary without us. I don’t want to have to call Sam and tell her a giant lizard needs someone to come over because he’s having nightmares.”

“Oh fuck off,” Telif growled. “Why don’t you two just go today so I don’t have to deal with you anymore.”

“Because I start my new job tomorrow, silly.” I nuzzled him.

“Oh yeah, you excited?” Jacob asked.

“More nervous than anything,” I replied. 

“I’m gonna miss having you with me during my tests, but at least we’ll be in the same building.” Telif nuzzled me back.

“That’s it. I’m going to go play video games before you two give me diabetes.”

Telif and I shared a look before he turned to Jacob. “What the fuck are you talking about?” 

“Ugh nevermind! Stupid aliens ain’t know shit ‘bout humor!”

January 28, 2137

“You ready for your first day?” Telif asked cheerily. 

“No, not at all,” I sighed. “Why did I agree to work with herbivores? They’ve never liked me before, they won’t like me now…”

“That’s not true. Everyone likes you.”

“I can quite literally count my living friends on one paw.”

“So can I, but it doesn’t stop me from trying.” He nuzzled into me. 

I grumbled, “Fine, I’ll try.”

“Good boy.”

“I’m older than you!” I pushed him slightly.

“Well, then act like it,” he replied smugly as he climbed out of my car.

*Stars dammit he’s right. I can’t be acting like a pup on their first day of school.*

“Ugh, wait up you jerk.” I jogged after him. “I start a bit later than you, can I at least walk you to Aysef’s office still?”

“Oh? But I thought I was a jerk. Surely you want to leave my company as soon as possible.” He flicked his tail playfully. 

“Ugh, shut up and let me hold your paw, you bastard.” I grabbed his paw in mine. 

“You know all you have to do is ask nicely,” he replied playfully as he squeezed my paw back. “But seriously I’m sure they’ll love you as much as I do. I wish I could go with you, but even if they’re willing to assist Arxur, something tells me my presence would still be a bit much for most of them.”

“Yeah, I still can’t believe any herbivores stuck around after finding out they’d be helping Arxur, indirectly or not. I wonder if they’ve been warned they’re sharing a building with a few. Would hate to cause a heart attack if someone ran into Aysef or you by mistake.”

Telif gasped in fake surprise. “But I thought you and Jacob said I wasn’t even remotely intimidating!”

“Ah that’s a good point, but Aysef is definitely a pawful.”

“I’m genuinely not sure how I’ll handle him without you,” Telif sighed.

“At least Jesse will be there to keep him in line. They are excellent at keeping him focused.”

“True true.” Telif stopped as we approached the door to Aysef’s office. “Think he’ll actually be on time for once?”

“Not a chance.” I grabbed both his paws in mine and stood as tall as I could. The Arxur caught on quickly and bent down to give me a quick kiss.

*I don’t know why these feel so nice, but the humans were really onto something with it.*

“Bye Sivik, I hope your first day goes well.”

“Me too,” I grumbled. “Meet you here after work? 

“Works for me.” 

I felt a pit in my stomach as he closed the door behind him and I was left alone to go socialize with my new colleagues. Even though my new office was in the same building, it felt like it took me forever to finally reach it. By the time I made it to the front door, I was panting slightly and was almost late, despite having arrived thirty minutes early to drop Telif off.

“Come on Siv, you can do this,” I whispered to myself. “You spent your entire life talking to other herbivores. The only thing that’s changed is you have friends now, so at least you can bitch about work when you get home if it sucked.”

I opened the door to the laboratory that Doctor Rivers had shown me during my interview. A few humans were already in the lab, talking to each other with cups of coffee in their hands. Their eyes wandered over to me, and one of them gave me a friendly wave.

“Good morning, are you the new employee?” one of them asked as they took another sip of coffee.

“Um yeah, I’m Sivik.” I began walking over. “Am I early? I thought there would be a few more people here.”

“Nah this is about when everyone else gets here. I just start early because my kids get out of school at three, so I need to be able to leave early and go get them. Abby over here is just a freak who likes mornings, so she asked to start at the same time as me.”

“Hey now,” the woman replied. “I mean it’s true but hey.”

The first human laughed. “You know I appreciate having you here with me. I’d be bored as hell without you during my first few hours. Oh and that over there is Cole. He’s not part of our team, but he works as the overnight security guard so he sometimes comes over here when he’s bored.”

“Nice to meetcha,” Cole said as he shook my paw. “I’m actually about out of here for the day. Just wanted to stop by and bring these guys some coffee before I left.”

“We appreciate it, Cole,” Abby replied. 

“It’s nice to meet you all.” I looked at the first human again. “Um, what was your name by the way?”

“Oh right, forgot to introduce myself,” he chuckled. “I’m Nathan. It’s wonderful to meet you as well. I know working with other species is probably super boring for you since you’ve known life outside your solar system existed for centuries at this point, but god it’s still so exciting for me to meet aliens! I apologize in advance if I get annoying with questions. I just absolutely adore learning about other cultures.”

“I might not be the best to ask,” I admitted. “I was always a bit of an outcast.”

“Ah sorry to hear that, man.” Nathan sounded a bit uncomfortable. *Maybe I shouldn’t let all my problems out immediately.* “Hope this isn’t insensitive, but is it because of the arm? My little brother was born without a leg and other kids could be huge dicks about it.”

“No, the arm is a recent development. I was just always a bit… different.”

“Ah, say no more man,” Abby chimed in. “Kids can be such assholes to people who are different. It seems to be a universal constant. I was a bit chubby as a kid and got so much shit for it.”

“Dang, sucks to be you guys,” Cole added before taking a sip of his coffee. “I guess I was just born cool, because everyone liked me.”

“And yet here you are hanging out with us losers, makes ya think, doesn’t it?” Nathan smirked. 

“I’ve truly fallen so far.” He tossed his coffee cup into the trash. “Anyway I gotta get goin’. You three have a nice rest of your day. See you tomorrow.”

“Later Cole,” Abby and Nathan chorused. 

“Nice meeting you,” I added.

The door had barely closed when I heard it open again and a Yotul walked in. 

“Later, Cole.” I heard him call out as he came in the door. His eyes locked onto our group and he casually walked over. “Mornin’ everyone. You must be the newbie we were told about.” 

I reached out my paw to shake his, before remembering that was a human greeting, but he barely seemed to notice as he took it in his. “That’s me. Name’s Sivik.” 

“Huslo,” he replied. “I can tell you’ve been working with humans for a bit if you go right for the handshake. Were you part of the exchange program?”

“Not exactly,” I admitted. “I was part of the Venlil Space Force, but ended up joining with the UN military as a pilot. Crashed here during the Battle for Earth and have been here since.”

“‘Sume that’s how you lost your arm?” I flicked my ears ‘yes’. “Much more noble than me in that case. Lost my leg when I was a pup playin’ with my pop’s harvester. Luckily, and this is the only time you will ever hear me singin’ their praises, the Feds had already made contact and were able to fix me up or I might not be here.”

“Damn, sorry to hear that.” I patted his shoulder. 

“S’all good, was a long time ago.” He took another sip of his coffee as the door opened again. 

“Good morning boys,” the unmistakable voice of a Sivkit called out. 

“Mornin’ Raxy,” my other coworkers called out. “Get over here, we got a new friend.”

“Don’t get your tails in a knot, you know it takes me a bit to move.” As she entered my view I realized why. Like most Sivkits she was walking on all fours, but I noticed she had a large brace on her back. Her ears perked up as she saw me and I saw her tail flicking happily. “Oh hello handsome, I didn’t know we were getting a Venlil on the team.”

I felt my ears get warm as I replied, “Oh hello, I’m Sivik.”

“Oooo, Sivik. Sivkit, it’s a perfect match,” she replied with a tail flick.

“I um, I have a boyfriend,” I managed to choke out.

“Oh don’t pay her no attention.” Huslo interrupted our awkward moment. “She’s been married for twenty years now. She just likes to know she’s still got it.”

“Oh Huslo, you’re no fun,” she pouted. “He’s right though I am happily married.” 

“Wanna tell ‘im why you got that brace?” Huslo added. “We’re sharin’ our tragic backstories.”

“Oh it was quite horrible,” she answered solemnly as her ears drooped. “But I guess I can share. You see, when I was a child I was…born with a really fucked up back.” I stared at her in confusion. “I’m playin’ with ya sweetie.”

“Oh, sorry I um, haven’t been around other herbivores in awhile. My social skills might be a bit… bad.”

“S’alright.” Huslo patted me on the back. “We’re all a buncha outcasts here.”

*This is going too well. When am I going to wake up?*

The door clicked open again and a Zurulian walked in on his hind paws before tossing a bag to the side and moving to all fours like Raxy. I quickly noticed both of his front legs were prosthetic, but looked much more advanced than mine. “Good morning everyone, who’s the new blood?”

“Mornin’ Tectut,” Raxy said cheerily. “This handsome young man is Sivik.”

“Nice to meet you.” I waved at him. 

“Oh, another member of the missing arm club.” He quickly walked over to me. “Mind if I take a look at it? I haven’t seen one like this before.”

“Tectut, down boy,” Nathan chided. “He’s been here for five minutes, give him a moment to settle in before you start being you.”

“Oh, alright.” He flicked his ears in apology at me. “Sorry about that. I just love robotics so much I sometimes forget there are people attached to these limbs.”

“It’s alright, I guess,” I replied as I clicked my arm off and handed it to him. “It’s a pretty standard one, nowhere near as fancy as yours, but I have done a bit of customization on it.”

“Amazing!” He looked it all over. “Did you have past experience in prosthetics?”

“Nope, just an engineering degree, online design docs, and a screwdriver,” I laughed.

“That is incredibly impressive in that case. Oh I hope you’ll let me pick your brain about this at some point,” he said with a wag. 

*Dammit, I don’t want to hang out with people outside of work. Just be honest about yourself like Doctor Torres said. They’ll leave you alone when they realize you aren’t like them.
*
“Um, maybe. I’m uh, not the most social creature in the galaxy,” I replied sheepishly.

“Ahhh, I bet you were accused of having predator disease in the past.” I looked down knowing my reputation was already ruined. “Oh no need to have any shame in it. All of us were.”

“You were?!” I blurted out.

“Sure was,” Huslo replied. “I had the audacity to be cranky about the feds givin’ me a shittier model of prosthetic just cuz I’m a quote ‘primitive’, so I shoulda just been happy with whatever garbage they gave me. Forget that it wasn’t the right size and caused me years of pain. Must be predator disease makin’ me grumpy.”

“I’m the opposite,” Raxy added. “Exterminators assumed something must be wrong with me because how could anyone in my position dare to be happy. I had so many predator disease screenings, but they never found anything wrong. Isn’t that funny? I wasn’t miserable so they assumed I was diseased!” 

“As for me. I was facing a disease that was slowly rendering my arms useless, but they wouldn’t give me prosthetics to replace them, since they believed cutting up my body when I ‘still had functional limbs’ was immoral and something only an Arxur would do. Eventually I got tired of begging for help so I took it into my own paws. I found a man of questionable morals, instructed him on how to tourniquet my limbs so I wouldn’t bleed out, and paid him to chop my arms off and leave me outside the hospital doors. After that they had no choice but to give me some fresh new limbs.” The Zurulian had a mischievous look in his eyes as he spoke.

*I feel like Aysef and him would get along.*

“Yeah, we all feel that way when we learn just how nuts Tectut is,” Huslo chimed in. “Oh, by the way, I know they were supposed to, but somehow no one warned Raxy, so just going to make sure you’re aware. Did anyone tell you there are Arxur in the building?” I felt my jaw drop slightly. I couldn’t believe they were so casual about that. “Fuck I knew they didn’t. Please don’t be scared. Doctor Rivers assures us they’re isolated to their own side of the building and that we are completely safe.”

“I’m not scared,” I replied bluntly. “I just didn’t expect you all to be so…nonchalant about it. I was told everyone here agreed to help Arxur too, but I figured you would just try not to think about it at best.”

“Nah, I don’t care about sharing a buildin’ with Arxur. You heard how they were treated. Their government forcibly starving them so they have no choice but to kill us. I don’t know if I ever want to meet one, but any ones that are fighting against the Dominion are fine with me.”

“Yeah, I just feel bad for them,” Raxy added. “I don’t know if I could ever be friends with one, but we tried to eradicate them. If the Federation had done that to the Sivkits I wouldn’t like them either. Not to say they haven’t committed atrocities, but I don’t think the average soldier has much choice. I’m happy to help them overthrow the Dominion too.”

I looked over at Tectut, still unable to believe what I was hearing. I half expected him to spit out some Federation propaganda as he opened his mouth. “Personally, I just believe it is a doctor’s duty to help everyone. The Arxur have been our enemy, but it is not a doctor’s duty to judge. I will help anyone, no matter what they’ve done. As men of science we can’t afford to let our own feelings cloud our judgement.”

*Okay, that’s more like what I expected.*

“What about you, Sivik,” Raxy said with a wag. “How do you feel about helping predators?”

*I don’t think I should tell them about Telif just yet…*

“I um, I was saved by an Arxur. When I crashed on Earth it was an Arxur soldier who carried me to safety and brought me to the medics who saved my life. She even tried to comfort me. I never got to thank her, so I guess I just want to find a way to make it up to her.”

“Well, you’re in the perfect place for that,” Abby chimed in. “And we’re happy to have you on the team.”

“Agreed,” Nathan added. “It warms my heart to know there are aliens out there who can look past species and just want to help.”

We spent the next few minutes chatting as more humans began filing in. As it was my first day, they had Huslo showing me the ropes. He told me more about his life. How he’d only been about two cycles old when the Federation showed up, so he didn’t remember much about what life was like before first contact. Despite my better judgement screaming at me to keep him at arm’s length, I found myself opening up to him a bit as well. I told him about my life growing up. It felt like we’d barely started and already the day was coming to an end. The rest of my team began filling out and heading towards their cars, and asked if I wanted to walk with them but I let them know I was meeting someone on the other side of the building, so we said our goodbyes as I went to go meet Telif. He was still wrapping up the last tests of the day, so I sat with Jesse for a bit and chatted with them about how their day had gone. Eventually it was time for Telif to head out as well, and I greeted him with a hug.

“Hey Sivik, how was your first day?” he asked with a wag.

“It went better than I expected,” I admitted. “Everyone was really nice.”

“See? Told you they would like you,” he replied smugly. 

“Yeah yeah, so how was your day? I miss anything fun?”

“Not too bad. More fun blood tests today. I swear half the time it feels like I’m working with those vampires from the human movies.”

“Hmm, that could explain why Jesse sleeps in a coffin.” 

“No, that's just because they’re something called a ‘Goth’,” Telif chuckled as he climbed into the passenger seat of my car. “They did play some new music for me today while Aysef was off doing…whatever it is he does when he isn’t with us. I liked it.”

“Oh? Wanna put some on?” I asked as I started the car. 

“Sure thing!” he replied excitedly. “This band is also over one hundred years old!”

“Stars, did humans just stop making anything good? Is that why they’re all so obsessed with old shit?”

“They played me some songs that came out this year as well,” Telif answered my rhetorical question. “This one was just my favorite.”

“Whatever you say, old man.” I stuck my tongue out at him as the car began our journey home. 

“Who told me the other day how much they liked Columbo and Sherlock Holmes, then admitted they need to listen to me more often because I have excellent taste in media?” 

“Okay okay, just play your old people music,” I laughed. 

The song started with an instrument I recognized as a piano before the singer began singing about his childhood. The instrumentals were nice and I found myself swishing my tail along to the music as Telif looked at me with a smug look. I couldn’t let his ego get any bigger, so I refused to admit out loud I was enjoying it. Luckily we were both tired from our day, so it was easy to distract him by leaning my head against his side and cuddling into him while we made our journey home. As I rested my head against my partner I almost couldn’t believe how good of a day I had had. My coworkers were nice. My boss was friendly and actually let us take breaks without complaining, and, best of all, I was easily able to visit Telif on my lunch break and got to spend more time with him.

*I can’t believe I’m actually looking forward to work tomorrow for the first time in my life.*

For the majority of those three years I worked from home and all was great. I enjoy all the leaders I work for and not having to commute was amazing. Recently our CEO has mandated everyone be in the office 4 days a week. I didn’t think this would impact me as much as it has. Not only getting up two hours earlier, getting ready and commuting but I also find now I have extreme anxiety being in the office. I’m not sure what the source of this anxiety is. I’m fine when I’m alone at my desk working but even running down to our cafeteria to grab coffee when there are random people down there makes me super anxious and shaky. I don’t want the leaders I work for to think I’m weird or have something wrong with me but this is really impacting my day to day life. I’m not sure if subconsciously I’m scared of them judging me because they are some of the highest paid people in the company and that’s causing the anxiety? I don’t want to leave the company - but I have been looking at other remote EA opportunities as it’s really hard to get an exception to stay WFH - but I’m not finding anything even remotely close to what I’m making now. I should also note that I used to be in the office before COVID in a different role and I wasn’t anxious at all. I also notice myself getting so much more overstimulated as people are constantly chit chatting with me or being noisy and I can’t focus near as well as I do in my home office.

1iczrn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pristiq/comments/1iczrn3/side_effect_or_other_medical_problem/,Side Effect or other medical problem?,"TLDR: So I've been on the generic for well over a year. I think I'm at 100mg right now, 1xday. I got a new job in September and have had severe difficulties staying awake in the office. I haven't had this issue before working in similar roles. But I've also been consistently having problems staying asleep and falling asleep instantaneously. Has anyone else experienced this on this medication or am I potentially dealing with something different/worse? Let me explain further:

When I go to bed, it does not matter what time, it could be 10AM-1AM, weekday or weekend. I will wake up in the middle of the night. Sometimes it's 2am, sometimes it's 3-5am, sometimes it's all of the above. The way I handle it is I go and use the bathroom, wander around my apartment and then go back to bed. But this has been occurring 80% of the time. Likewise, I usually try and get some work done on my phone before going to sleep and lay in bed with it. Most of the time, I don't even realize I fall asleep and the phone ends up on the floor. It can be anywhere from 45 seconds to 5 minutes. And sidenote, WEIRD vivid dreams. Like just bizarre crap.

But when I get to work, usually at 8am, I start to have issues with dozing off at my desk around 9:45-10:45 almost every day. And it's bad enough to where I cannot stop myself from dozing off and I don't realize I do it until I wake myself up from snoring. And then I try to play it off, because I'm severely embarrassed. Some days I try to grab a coffee during my break and that doesn't fix it. I try to stand and wander around, that doesn't fix it. But it's embarrassing.

1iczo8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1iczo8r/is_the_ninja_dualbrew_pro_cfp301_coffee_maker/,Is the Ninja DualBrew Pro CFP301 Coffee Maker worth it? Here’s my review!,"Testing coffee makers has become a bit of a personal passion, especially since my mornings don’t officially begin without that first cup. For the past month, I’ve been using the Ninja DualBrew Pro CFP301 Coffee Maker, and it’s been an interesting journey. The unit combines drip coffee brewing with compatibility for K-Cup pods, promising versatility that many of us coffee enthusiasts crave. Spoiler: it delivers in many areas but does have its quirks.

**DESIGN & BUILD QUALITY**  
Unboxing the Ninja DualBrew Pro CFP301, the first thing that struck me was its sleek black design and compact structure. It fits neatly on my kitchen counter without eating up too much space, which is a blessing in my already cluttered kitchen. The build is primarily plastic, which doesn’t scream luxury but does feel sturdy enough for daily use. I noticed a few minor scuffs on the surface after a week of use, which could be a dealbreaker for those particular about aesthetics.

One standout feature is the movable water reservoir. You can position it on the side or back, depending on the layout of your kitchen. This small but thoughtful touch made it much easier to refill without awkward maneuvering. The included fold-away frother is another nice addition, though I found it a bit flimsy when frothing thicker milk alternatives like oat milk.

**BREWING PERFORMANCE**  
This machine is a multitasking champion. It handles both traditional coffee grounds and K-Cup pods, giving you flexibility depending on your needs. My mornings are usually a rush, so I appreciated the speedy brewing time for K-Cups—it’s noticeably quicker than my old Keurig. That said, if you’re using the pod brew for larger sizes (10-12oz), you might find the flavor a tad diluted.

For ground coffee, the Ninja DualBrew Pro allows you to choose from four brewing styles: Classic, Rich, Over Ice, and Specialty. I’m someone who occasionally experiments with iced coffee, and the Over Ice setting worked like a charm. It brewed strong coffee that didn’t feel watered down once the ice started to melt. However, the Specialty Brew setting, designed for concentrated coffee, felt more like a gimmick to me. It was fine but not as rich as I expected for lattes or cappuccinos.

**COFFEE FLAVOR**  
The coffee flavor is where the Ninja DualBrew Pro CFP301 really shines. I tested several types of coffee grounds—from light roasts to dark blends—and the machine consistently brought out their distinct notes. The Thermal Flavor Extraction DUO technology seems to play a role here, ensuring even saturation of coffee grounds for a well-rounded cup. However, pod brews didn’t quite achieve the same depth of flavor as ground coffee, which is typical for K-Cup machines.

**CLEANING & MAINTENANCE**  
Cleaning this machine is generally straightforward. The removable water reservoir and frother make it easy to rinse out after each use. The auto-clean function is a standout feature, especially for someone like me who often forgets to descale appliances on time. Still, I did notice some drips on the warming plate after brewing. While not a huge issue, it’s something to keep a cloth handy for.

**PROS**

* Versatile brewing options for every coffee mood.
* Compact design with a customizable water reservoir position.
* Delivers bold, well-rounded coffee flavor with grounds.
* Fast brewing for K-Cups, great for busy mornings.
* Includes a fold-away frother for cappuccinos and lattes.

**CONS**

* K-Cup brews can taste weaker, especially in larger sizes.
* Plastic build may not appeal to those seeking a premium feel.
* Dripping from the spout onto the warming plate can be annoying.
* Frother struggles with thicker milk alternatives.
* Specialty Brew setting doesn’t feel as rich as advertised.

**COMPARISON TO COMPETITORS**  
I’ve owned a Keurig K-Elite in the past, so naturally, I compared the two. The Ninja DualBrew Pro CFP301 outperforms the Keurig in flavor extraction and brewing versatility. The rich brew setting on the Ninja is something the Keurig simply can’t replicate. However, the Keurig feels slightly more polished in terms of build quality, with less dripping after brewing. For those who primarily use single-serve pods, the Keurig might still be the better bet.

On the flip side, machines like the Breville Bambino Plus offer superior milk frothing and espresso quality, but they lack the convenience of K-Cup compatibility. The Ninja DualBrew Pro strikes a middle ground between versatility and affordability, making it ideal for households with varying coffee preferences.

**COST ANALYSIS & VALUE FOR MONEY**  
While the price varies, the Ninja DualBrew Pro CFP301 offers excellent value given its range of features. You’re essentially getting a drip coffee maker, a single-serve pod machine, and a frother in one package. This versatility saves you from buying multiple devices, which makes the investment worthwhile. Still, if you’re someone who exclusively drinks espresso or specialty coffee, you might find better options at a similar price point.

**FUNCTIONALITY & FEATURES**  
Let’s talk about the settings because, honestly, they’re a treat for control freaks like me. From small cups to full carafes, the machine offers nine brewing sizes with grounds and four sizes for pods. The independent hot water system is another thoughtful touch. I’ve used it to make tea, ramen, and even oatmeal on busy mornings.

The programmable timer is handy if you want to wake up to the smell of coffee, though setting it up the first time wasn’t as intuitive as I’d hoped. Once figured out, it worked flawlessly. I also tried the Over Ice setting with a medium roast, and it brewed a strong, refreshing cup that held up well against melting ice.

brand new to the home espresso world, and have fallen into the rabbit hole. I was searching online for a home espresso machine and have my sights on a Gaggia Classic. I'm a bit of a tech nerd, so the community around the arduino mods definitely has me intrigued, but wanted to get my foot in the door before dropping a few hundred on a new toy. So I bought a used casabrews from a friend for $50 to just experiment and at least get started with some home espresso. I've watched a ton of videos and want to start slowly upgrading the portafilters, grinders and accessories, but I'm a bit lost. 

I got some preground espresso at the super market. I understand it's not the freshest or best quality. I also understand I have the stock pressurized basket that came with the machine and have not yet upgraded to a bottomless portafilter. I thought at worst I would get some pretty generic espresso, no distinct flavor notes or much to write home about, but that's kinda what I wanted.

I wanted to learn the fundamentals of the machine and practice puck prep with something kinda cheap and generic, have something already ground and roasted for espresso, before rushing out to buy all different kinds of specialty roasts and changing the variables in grind, extraction time, etc. Figured square one was the best place to start; find a workflow, then when ordering better coffee can change the variables to optimize. But off the bat made some of the most bitter and astringent espresso I've ever had. Now I'm a bit confused. I don't know whether to blame the coffee, whether to blame myself for poor technique, blame the machine or the portafilter, or all the above. So I guess my question is when you make a bad shot, what is the thought process for diagnosis? 

I went to a local roaster that had a tasting room so I could try their espresso and if it was good I was going to get some of their beans, so at least I could have a baseline to try to get to at home, but I wasn't particularly impressed, so I'm looking for other roasters in my area. When you've not tried a particular brand or roast before, how far down the rabbit hole do you go trying to optimize everything before concluding you may just not be a fan of that style or roast?

And the main thing about is that he can shoot a beam of testostorone out of his all seeing eye and remove all estrogen in ones body that is blessed by the all mighty Eye of testostorone!
Also he can benchpress 102kg aswell as materialize exactly 10 eggs in anywhere. Another interesting thing is that he is usually seen in the female bathrooms protecting the weaker gender from the bad spirits. He is also likely to be pleased by a gift of porridge and some coffee with milk that being his main source of nutriens. (He enjoys the eggs too) He was first spotted in one of the crusades around 13th century and has been rumoured to have an evil twin that is named ""Eye of Estrogen"" and he is the polar opposite from our protagonist.

1icziz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Step2/comments/1icziz9/passed_260_exam_writeup/,Passed. 260. Exam write-up!,"I started my prep with Amboss and White Coat companion. I started off by reading the main modules like gynae, paeds, and surgery from the book and then did around 100 questions on that particular subject just to get a basic understanding of stuff before I jumped to doing uworld. Then I started off with UW, consistently scoring at least 60%+ on every block, and I tried to learn as much as I could. Then I moved on to the NBMES and UWSAs. Understood my mistakes, worked on those areas and here we are!

Studying Advice: Since you have already given your step 1, you know where your strengths lie, as do your weaknesses. I would recommend that you start working on those weaknesses from very early on. For example, I knew that content was not my issue, I can learn and retain, but my solving ability wasn’t good in step 1, nor was it amazing in step 2, so I consistently kept that in mind and worked on it, and made hardcore rules to follow for the exam. Here is the list of solving rules that I developed over time when I observed my mistakes consistently:

1. Read the first line, and last two lines, and then the options
2. Go through the entire stem thoroughly
3. Translate and rule other options out. (this is like really really important. For example, you have a question about a 24-hour-old newborn with a 12-hour history of bilious vomiting, and they have asked you the next best step to diagnose this condition, you need to translate what each option correlates to, in this case, this is likely midgut volvulus for which you would first do an abdominal x-ray, followed by upper GI series)
4. Mark and move on. Don’t overthink
5. Come back ONLY to your flagged questions. READ THE STEM AGAIN. Until and unless you do not have a lightbulb moment (that moment where you’re like oh yeah now I get what they are trying to ask), do not change your answer! (this rule was really difficult for me to follow because I always second-guessed myself and changed my answers and then regretted it) 

Studying Material:

1. Uworld: Uworld remains the gold standard. Every small concept that it teaches you, you need to learn it. It would only be helpful to you. All the algorithms, all the tables, everything is important. I coupled my Uworld with Anki (will talk about this too) and that helped with retention. The low-yield stuff in the uworld is also important.
2. Amboss: Amboss was exceedingly helpful. If you haven’t bought it or don’t plan on buying it, please buy it, it would be worth it. I bought it along with a friend and we found it to be really helpful. So here’s the reason why Amboss is so good, and why during the last month I primarily focused on Amboss rather than uworld. Just like the NBMES, Amboss also likes to confuse you between options rather than making a complicated q stem and tricking you where you don’t need to be tricked (like uworld does), and that is so helpful. I’ll give you an example, there was a question in amboss about a case of testicular torsion and it had both Doppler ultrasound and surgical exploration as options for the next best step in management. Normally, you would think that I need to get a Doppler done to check for the blood flow to the testes, but Amboss taught me that no, you directly take this patient to surgery, however, that is not the case with ovarian torsion where you need to do a doppler before. It didn’t show up on my exam but definitely got me a point or two in the nbmes. Amboss is well known for its high yield 200 and its articles that you need to do before the exam, those articles and those questions really helped me get questions correct on the exam that otherwise I would have most certainly gotten wrong. So please, invest in it and use it well. 
3. Anki: I am not an anki person. I never was, and I probably never will be. But I understood one thing very early on I need to step out of my comfort zone and use it because it would be very difficult for me to retain information otherwise. But I used it on my own terms. I made my own cards and catered to my learning method, and that helped me a lot. If there is one exceedingly high-yield resource that can help you get a good score, it is Anki, because baselessly solving questions without retaining anything isn’t going to take you anywhere. If not Anki, then you need to make sure that you are revising your uworld tables and algorithms in one way or another, because if not, you will regret it. There is just too much information to learn, do yourself a favor, and make your peace with it very early on.
4. NBMES: So, unlike step 1 NBMES, step 2 NBMES are a little tough, and they have a difficult curve too. To score around 255+, you need to score close to 80% in the NBME which isn’t a piece of cake for everyone. While solving NBMEs, I know that everyone hates to read through the weird purple-bluish explanations, but they are really important. You see, it is the same content that they test over and over in different ways. If you learn it well, you will not regret it. It could be the thing that leads you to score very high. So, while doing NBMEs, please time yourself, and revise them really well.
5. CMS forms: I don’t understand why people do not utilize this resource. These are questions made directly by the examiners with exactly similar concepts that will be tested in your exam. There is just absolutely no reason to not do them. These are around 40 forms, with 50 questions in each of them, so please please solve these. You should be getting at least 40/50 correct to say that you did well on a form. I scored around 40+ in all of them except some OB/GYN and Paeds forms.
6. Divine Intervention Podcasts: His podcasts were really helpful. I started off listening to him when I was doing uworld. I started with the rapid review series, which was a good way to overview things and learn stuff. I listened to him while doing gym exercises, otherwise, I felt sleepy listening to his podcasts ngl. His high-yield podcast list was really helpful for my exam too since my exam was packed with QI questions. 

In my final month, I primarily focused on doing Amboss, CMS forms, and NBMEs. I was solving around 200 to 250 questions per day. The more questions you solve the more well-prepped you will be because the exam tests your clinical judgment more than anything, and that is something that you can only build through solving as many questions as possible (another reason to do amboss and CMS). In my final two weeks, I read the amboss articles, solved biostatistics and ethics from amboss and uworld, did amboss 200 high-yield questions, listened to divine intervention podcasts (really helpful), revised my NBMES, went through algorithms, and some important PDFs that’s it. 

I am posting my practice scores, which I calculated based on [this calculator](https://dashboard.elhusseinyusmleprep.com/dashboard/scorecalculator) (may not be very accurate about NBME 13 and 14, use Reddit formulae to calculate), a lot of people use [this other calculator,](https://enterprise.shinyapps.io/converter/) but I found the former to be more accurate based on some Reddit posts of people who took NBMEs online. 

Here are my scores:

1. NBME 10: 244 - 3.5 months out
2. NBME 11: 252- 3 months out
3. UWSA 3: 236 3 months out
4. UWSA 1: 246- 2.5 months out
5. NBME 9: 250- 2.5 months out
6. NBME 12: 245- 2 months out
7. Old old free 120: 89%-  45 days out
8. Old new free 120: 83%- 30 days out
9. NBME 15: 256- 20 days out
10. NBME 13: 260- 15 days out
11. NBME 14: 251- 10 days out
12. UWSA2: 264- 5 days out
13. New Free 120: 83%- 4 days out
14. Amboss Predictor: 259
15. Uworld correct %: 68%
16. Real deal: 260 Alhumdullilah

Advice related to NBMEs:

As I have mentioned, NBMEs are really important and it is crucial that you do these really well. As you can see from UWSA3 to NBME 12, my scores weren’t that great and it was difficult to pull myself out of the spiral where it felt very undoable. Though they broke me a little, those scores motivated me to do better. I understood my mistakes, I learned where I was going wrong, I made the rules for myself and stringently tried to follow them throughout, and then the scores improved. I gained my confidence and I learned that it was very doable. Allah Miyan most certainly helped me out in ways I could not have imagined and led me to score as well as I did. So, fellow test takers, there will be moments of doubt where you would feel like giving up, but I would urge you to stand up and fight because IT IS REALLY EASY TO MAKE EXCUSES. Everyone can make excuses, don’t take no for an answer, and keep pushing, and I guarantee that you will do well in this exam. This group is filled with people who are much smarter than me, who I know would do really well in the exam too, you just need to believe in yourself that you can do it.

Some stuff that I feel you should keep in mind while solving NBMEs:

1. Ruling out is as important as ruling in. For example, a post-menopausal woman presents to you with urge incontinence, and now you are thinking that yes this is post-menopausal urge incontinence, but would the next best step be prescribing vaginal estrogen? No. You would first do a urinalysis to rule out a UTI. Similarly a stable angina patient presents in your clinic, should you do an exercise stress test to confirm the diagnosis? No, you would first need to do an ECG to rule out any acute conditions like MI.
2. NBMEs are not trying to trick you. Often times the simplest answer is the correct answer.
3. If you are given a condition and asked the next best step, but the ideal test that you use to diagnose that condition is not in the option, mark the option that points towards its treatment. For example you haven’t been given CT abdomen contrast to diagnose acute diverticulitis, rather than marking an odd option such as barium enema, mark the one that involves giving treatment i.e. antibiotics
4. If you are confused between two options or two diagnoses. Think about it like this. If I diagnose this case as this, will my next best step would be this? For example, if you are confused between GERD and PUD, and you have both in options as Nissen Fundoplication and EGD, you should go for EGD, because even if this patient had GERD, you wouldn’t just directly do Nissen Fundoplication
5. Read the stem thoroughly. Remember the algorithm and see how much of the algorithm has already been followed in the question. For example, if you get a question about idiopathic intracranial hypertension, you won’t just directly mark do head CT or smth, you would first see that okay wait they have already done imaging, now I need to do an LP
6. I think NBME 11 was probably the easiest and most doable. I regret that I solved it so early on, I would have definitely scored 260+ in it if I had solved it later on when I was better prepped. So, this advice may sound a little unconventional but solve NBME 11 in the last for a confidence boost. 
7. Don’t underestimate the NBMEs and their predictability, but also don’t take your score to heart. Know that you can always improve if you keep on working on yourself. 

These are some things I learned after repeatedly getting questions wrong, and understanding where I was going wrong. NBMEs follow some tricks, if you identify these patterns, you are bound to do well. 

Exam Day:

I got a good night’s sleep. I packed some cold coffee, protein bars, a biscuit, and a water bottle. I went in with the mindset that I have prepped my best and I am going to give it my best shot. I was actually really excited to solve the paper because I decided to enjoy the process rather than being scared about it. That helped. I flagged around 10 questions per block, I very rarely changed my answers (hate that I changed any at all), and kept a positive attitude throughout. Time was not an issue for me, I was able to solve my block in 40 minutes and had around 20 minutes just to review my flagged questions. My exam was difficult, I had around 10 questions from biostatistics + QI per block, I did not get many ethics questions but the ones I did were difficult. Besides that, a lot of it was doable, but 15% were wtf questions that I could not have prepared for. The most important thing was that I didn’t overthink stuff, nor did I overcalculate while solving the questions, I kept a very chill mindset throughout and I think that helped. 

I came out of the exam hall feeling confident, and at that time I knew my score could be anywhere between 250 to 270. But as soon as I went home and started remembering questions, and checking them, it got really bad really fast. These 14 days were torture fr. Not only did I have to study for my med school annual exams, but I also had to do some work, keep myself sane, and find time to overthink my exam. Really glad that this is out of the way today. 

Final words: This exam requires loads of guts. And to do it in my fourth year when people told me that it would be difficult for me to do, it was even tougher. But I am glad that I stood up and saw this through, no matter how difficult it got. I kept believing in myself because others believed in me too, and that is why I stand where I stand today.

1iczijv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1iczijv/lather_log_2024/,Lather Log 2024,"Welcome to your SOTD Lather Log for 2024

* 22,511 shave reports from 313 distinct shavers during 2024 were analyzed to produce this report. Collectively, these shavers used 2006 distinct soaps from 385 distinct brands. Note: these numbers are minimally inflated by iffy Lather Games ""[soap](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1dorgty/comment/lah3old/)"" choices.

## Observations

* Alliteration clearly drives shaving behavior. Mammoth Monday launched House of Mammoth to the top of the Soap Makers table in 2024, surpassing last year's winner, Barrister and Mann; and Tabac Tuesday sent Tabac to the top of the Soaps table, also pushing aside Barrister and Mann who won last year's contest with Hallows. Spearhead Saturday and Stirling Sunday (or vice versa) feel like untapped marketing opportunities. Could [Thor's Hammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1axu9hc/comment/krvyygg/) Thursday revolutionize a lesser known soap maker's business?

* House of Mammoth dominates the top ten in the Soaps table. Not only were they the only soap maker to have more than one soap in the top 10, but they managed to place six soaps in spots 5 through 10.

* There are no surprises in first and second in the Brand Diversity table: Stirling and B&M always win this contest, but below them things get interesting. Declaration Grooming comes within three scents of what would have been a pretty major upset if they succeeded in passing B&M. And Ariana & Evans is a complete surprise in fourth since seventh is they highest they've ever ranked for this contest in a single month. I guess lots of single use soaps over an entire year add up.

## Notes & Caveats

* I only show the top n results per category to keep the tables readable and avoid max post length issues.

* The unique user column shows the number of different users who used a given brand/soap/etc in the year.

* The Brand Diversity table details the number of distinct soaps used during the year from that particular brand.

* The change Δ vs columns show how an item has moved up or down the rankings since that year. = means no change in position, up or down arrows indicate how many positions up or down the rankings an item has moved compared to that year. n/a means the item was not present in that year.

12.5 units of tirzepatide.

 I took my 3rd dose on Monday and I just hit 10lbs down. I completely cut my caloric intake, focusing at around 1300 a day and trying to get 100 grams of protein but really sitting at about 80. I haven’t done any working out yet but wow today feels DIFFERENT. I’ve still had what I consider food noise - I’m still thinking about food all of the time. However my body is not interested. I think eating is my response to boredom, so usually I will have an OWYN protein coffee (I swear by these). Today though I just can’t. I literally choked down my oats overnight, I took three sips of my OWYN, I have no interest in even water right now. This is the first time I’ve actually felt like what I’m consuming wants to come right back up. No nausea just like…grossed out? Any advice or insight on why the sudden change?

1icze0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/loveafterporn/comments/1icze0k/how_do_i_do_things_for_me/,How do I do things for me?,"Ever since D-day (September 2024) I’ve become basically a shell of myself. Before I discovered that my boyfriend had been lying about watching porn and had secret accounts to follow girls, I was a different person. I loved clothes, perfume, trying new beauty products. I loved to get coffee and walk around my city. I liked doing my hair and nails in cute styles. I made sure my house was always clean and loved to light candles. I would say my mood was generally upbeat and friendly.

Now I just wear pyjamas, a big t-shirt. My hair goes days without being brushed or washed, my house is a mess, I never wear any of my perfumes. If I have to go outside I wear all black and no make up. I put a hat on so I don’t have to do my hair. I don’t eat. I haven’t done the dishes or laundry for days. I genuinely don’t see the point. I hate the fact I’m a pale brunette. I want to cut my hair off. 

He asked me today what’s wrong and why I’m sad, why don’t I eat. I said if I spent 1 year looking at other men behind your back would you want to do anything nice for yourself? He didn’t answer.

I don’t know what to do. I used to focus on the fact he mostly followed blondes and that was his type. Now I’m just confused. He looked at overweight brunette girls because at least they had big boobs. But then he looked at blonde muscular gym girls with fake boobs? Women with BBLs that were borderline comical. Curvy brunette girls in so much make up, but then slim, no hips, big boob girl-next-door blondes that were pretty with no make-up. 

What direction am I supposed to go in? I can’t be everything. I know they like “variety” but that’s almost worse than having a type because he will never be satisfied and it won’t take much for his eyes to wander. At least I could dye my hair blonde and apply some tan. I can’t be plus sized and skinny, I can’t have fake boobs but also big natural boobs. I can’t be muscular but also soft & curvy. If I wear obvious make-up then I won’t look like the girl next door. I can’t be blonde but also brunette. I give up.

I’m sorry for the negativity but I just feel hopeless 🙁",6,1738171985.0,loveafterporn,2,1.0,False

1iczc47,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1iczc47/the_letter_youre_never_gonna_read/,The letter you're never gonna read,"Hey, N. How's it going? I truly hope you're good and getting better everyday. 

The last time we spoke, we ended things in a good way, but I'm not good. I'm not good at all. 

We met through Tinder, of all things, and started talking as friends. You were coming out of a bad relationship, I was coming out of a deadbeat marriage and we agreeded we'd only talk and be friends.

But after every talk, after every moment, things were becoming different. The little, subtle things. Even the emojis were changing. A lot of people will thing the emoji thing is stupid but we know how much that had value. The little black heart emoji I'd send you. The same black heart you put right next to my name on the contacts on your phone. The same little black heart you on the bio of your instagram. 



Again, this is meaningless to the fucking planet, but meant something to us. And everything started with that kiss after we worked out together and then taking you home. From that moment on, I was, and am, hooked. Everything about was and is amazing and I was thinking to myself that this is too early, we're fresh out of relationships and this is too early.



But after every talk, every conversation, every emoji... even when we were having coffee one day and I told you I was planning on moving to a different city for a possible job, if I eventually get it, and you started browsing on your phone for positions in that same city.

I mean, I know I shouldn't have left this happen like this, but I did. 

And, for a while, I thought ""this is awesome... let's see what the future holds, I mean... both adults, both living our lives."" And then, that Sunday, you told me you needed to slow things down and it was better for us to just to be friends again. You reminded me of your situation, reminded me you were fresh out of a bad relationship. For a brief moment, I tried to talk to you about getting through this together, like we said we would... but you were firm and I respect you too much to try to force things.



So I said my goodbyes, wished you a speedy healing, but we kept talking as friends. Sending goofy things on instagram, text messages here and there... Even when you got a bit drunk and texted me something sensual, it took everything in me to avoid responding...



And now I'm here. I know you're gonna get better and I want you to. Will I be here when you're ready? I don't know. I don't know what life holds for me, I don't know if I'm getting that job... Is that something I would want? yes... I want us to give us a chance to be us, if that makes any sense.

Well... this letter you'll never read, because you're not on reddit... but I needed to write this. I respect you, I wish you the best, but you hurt me. I know we are fresh out of things and this may be whiplash... but it hurts like hell...

Anyway, friends from the internet. Thanks for reading.",2,1738171863.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

----------------------------------------------------------

Gift cards are a popular choice for giving presents, as they allow the recipient to choose what they want. However, selecting the right gift card can be tricky. Different occasions call for different types of gift cards, and narrowing down the options can make your gifting experience smoother and more enjoyable. Here are some handy tips on how to choose the right gift cards for various occasions.

### Consider the Occasion

The first step in choosing gift cards is to think about the event you’re celebrating. Each occasion has its vibe. Here are some examples:

- **Birthdays:** Fun gift cards like those from entertainment venues, restaurants, or favorite stores work well for birthdays. These give the birthday person the freedom to treat themselves.
- **Weddings:** For weddings, consider gift cards to home goods stores or restaurants. Newlyweds often appreciate practical gifts that help start their new life together.
- **Holidays:** Seasonal gift cards, such as those for popular retailers or online stores, are perfect for holidays. They offer a variety of items that fit festive moods.
- **Graduations:** Aim for gift cards that support the next stage in life. Think about stores for clothes, tech, or educational supplies as graduates step into their careers or further studies.
- **Just Because:** Sometimes, you just want to brighten someone’s day. A gift card for a coffee shop or spa can show you care without a specific reason.

### Think About the Recipient

Understanding the recipient’s preferences is also key. Here are some things to consider:

Check The Details Here: http://richdaddydating.com/AIfluencers-Premium  
  
- **Their Hobbies:** If they love shopping for clothes, a fashion store gift card works well. For foodies, consider gourmet food stores or restaurants.
- **Age Group:** The type of gift card might vary with age. Kids might enjoy gaming or toy store cards, while adults may prefer dining or shopping cards.
- **Their Lifestyle:** If someone enjoys travel, a gift card for airlines or hotels can add a personal touch to their gift.

### Check for Flexibility

Choosing gift cards that offer flexibility is beneficial. Some cards can be used in multiple locations or are not tied to one single brand. This flexibility can enhance the experience for the recipient, allowing them to choose how to spend their gift. Some popular options include:

- **Prepaid Visa or Mastercard:** These can be used anywhere that accepts cards, giving the recipient vast options.
- **Amazon Gift Card:** With countless products available, an Amazon gift card is perfect for almost anyone.
- **Store Chains:** Gift cards from store chains that have various departments (like Target or Walmart) can also be a good choice.

### Pay Attention to Expiration Dates and Fees

Some gift cards may come with expiration dates or hidden fees. Before purchasing, read the fine print to ensure the recipient will get the full value of the card without complications. Here’s what to keep an eye on:

Check The Details Here: http://richdaddydating.com/AIfluencers-Premium  
  
- **Activation fees:** Some cards require activation fees, which can reduce the overall gift value.
- **Expiration dates:** Ensure the gift card does not expire shortly after gifting.
- **Inactivity fees:** Some cards deduct fees if not used within a certain period, so be aware of these policies.

### Personal Touch Matters

Adding a personal touch to your gift card can enhance its impact. Consider the following:

- **Handwritten Note:** A simple note expressing your thoughts can make a difference.
- **Presentation:** Present the card in a thoughtful way, like a beautiful card or small gift bag.

Using these tips can help you navigate the selection process and ensure that your gift card is both thoughtful and appreciated. Choosing the right gift card will not only bring joy to the recipient but can also reflect your understanding of their preferences and the occasion. So, next time you're in the market for a gift, keep these strategies in mind to make your selection process easier and more meaningful.

Tips for Maximizing the Value of Your Gift Cards
------------------------------------------------

Gift cards can be a fantastic way to treat yourself or someone else, saving you time during the shopping process. However, to truly maximize their value, consider a few strategies that can help you make the most of every card you receive. Here are some tips that are sure to enhance your gift card experience.

Check The Details Here: http://richdaddydating.com/AIfluencers-Premium  
  
### Know the Terms and Conditions

Before you start spending your gift card, take a moment to read the terms and conditions. Here’s why:

- **Expiration Dates:** Gift cards often have expiration dates. Knowing when your card expires allows you to plan your spending accordingly.
- **Restrictions:** Some cards might have restrictions on certain items or during sales. Be aware of these to avoid disappointment.
- **Fees:** Certain cards may have inactivity fees if not used within a specific timeframe. Check to see if yours is one of them.

### Combine Gift Cards with Sales

Using your gift card during a sale can significantly increase its value. By combining your card with current promotions, you can snag great deals. For instance:

Check The Details Here: http://richdaddydating.com/AIfluencers-Premium  
  
- Check the store’s website for any ongoing sales or discounts.
- If they offer a buy-one-get-one-free deal, use your gift card to purchase the items at a lower cost.

This way, you can get more for your money and possibly even stretch your gift card further than expected.

### Use Gift Cards for Big Purchases

If you have a larger sum on a gift card, consider saving it for a big-ticket item. For example:

Check The Details Here: http://richdaddydating.com/AIfluencers-Premium  
  
- Electronics such as a new tablet or headphones are often more expensive. Using a gift card for a sizable chunk of the payment can ease the financial burden.
- Plan to save your gift cards for a holiday sale or Black Friday event, where discounts are likely to enhance your purchase even more.

### Buy Essentials

If you find yourself unsure about what to buy with your gift card, consider purchasing essentials. This ensures you are making practical use of the funds:

- Groceries can be a smart choice; many grocery stores offer gift cards.
- Household items, like cleaning supplies or basic kitchenware, can also be great picks that help ease your monthly expenses.

By focusing on essentials, you won't just feel good about spending; you'll be obtaining items you genuinely need.

Check The Details Here: http://richdaddydating.com/AIfluencers-Premium  
  
### Consider Gift Card Exchanges

If you have a gift card for a store you don't frequent or prefer a different brand, consider a gift card exchange. Many websites allow you to:

- Trade your unwanted gift card for one that suits your needs better.
- Sell the card for cash or use it to purchase a popular retailer’s gift card.

This is a smart way to make sure you're always getting enjoyment and value from your gift cards.

Check The Details Here: http://richdaddydating.com/AIfluencers-Premium  
  
### Share with Friends and Family

Sometimes, sharing is the best way to maximize a gift card. If you're unable to find something you want, consider sharing it:

- Give it to a family member who can use it more effectively.
- Team up with friends to buy a larger item that you can all enjoy together.

Collaborating this way ensures that the card does not go to waste and everyone benefits.

Check The Details Here: http://richdaddydating.com/AIfluencers-Premium  
  
### Keep Track of Your Gift Card Balances

As you spend your gift cards, it’s easy to lose track of how much is left. To avoid this issue:

- Use apps designed to store your gift card information and track your balances.
- Keep the physical cards in one spot so you can easily access them when needed.

Staying organized will help you make sure you fully use each card.

Check The Details Here: http://richdaddydating.com/AIfluencers-Premium  
  
By following these tips, you can stretch the value of your gift cards further and maximize the joy they bring. Remember, it’s not just about spending the card, but making the best choices that align with your needs and preferences.

### Conclusion

Choosing the right gift cards for different occasions can be a rewarding experience, allowing you to tailor your gifts to the preferences of friends and family. By keeping in mind the interests of the recipient, whether it's their favorite restaurant, retail store, or online platform, you can ensure that your gift is both thoughtful and useful. Additionally, selecting versatile gift cards that offer a wide range of options can enhance your gift's appeal, making it perfect for birthdays, holidays, or congratulatory gestures.

Maximizing the value of your gift cards is equally essential. Always do your research to find out which cards offer the best deals or promotions at different times of the year. Don’t forget to check for expiration dates and potential fees, as these can reduce the card's value. Using apps and websites that track and compare gift card values can also help you make informed decisions, ensuring you get the most out of your purchase.

Ultimately, whether you’re giving or receiving gift cards, being mindful about selections will lead to more meaningful exchanges.

It’s More Than Just Pretty Pictures,"Hey everyone! Let’s talk about **Generative AI** for a second. Sure, it’s cool to watch an AI turn your text prompt into jaw-dropping art (who doesn’t want to see a corgi riding a unicorn in a galaxy far, far away?). But the benefits go way beyond creating eye candy. Here’s a quick rundown of why this technology is more game-changing than you might think:

# 1. Turbocharging Creativity & Brainstorming

Stuck in a creative rut? Generative AI can jump-start your ideas with fresh concepts or unexpected designs. Think of it like having a super powered brainstorming buddy who never sleeps and occasionally comes up with downright wacky suggestions that spark your own brilliance.

# 2. Personalized Content at Scale

Whether you’re a small biz trying to tailor ads for different audiences or a giant corporation cranking out product mockups, AI can handle the mundane, repetitive tasks. No more copy-pasting the same design in 20 color variations. AI’s got you covered, freeing you up for higher-level strategy (or just a coffee break).

# 3. Education & Research

Generative AI isn’t just for commercial use. It’s also amazing for simulating scenarios in medicine, engineering, and climate studies. From generating new protein structures in biotech to visualizing future cityscapes for urban planning, AI helps researchers test theories without the usual cost and time constraints.

# 4. Training Wheels for New Skills

Want to learn a new art style or level up your design chops? Generative AI can provide reference images, style suggestions, or even fully rendered templates to guide you. It’s like having a personal tutor that hands you ready-to-use material whenever you’re stuck. (No more googling “cool art ideas” at 2 AM.)

# 5. Automation, But Make It Fun

We often think of automation as robotic assembly lines and repetitive data entry. With generative AI, automation can be playful and weirdly creative. It can crank out catchy headlines, compose short music samples, or come up with unique social media posts—no soulless corporate talk necessary (unless that’s your brand, I guess).

# Bonus: The “Wow” Factor

Let’s be honest, a lot of us got hooked on AI because it’s insanely cool. Watching an algorithm conjure up something from thin air never really gets old, and it can impress clients or audience members who aren’t yet jaded by how “normal” this tech is becoming.",1,1738171376.0,GenerativeAiLovers,0,1.0,False

So last night we ended up having a conversation, where he ended up saying basically “out of all of my friends and coworkers our house is the cleanest” and it frustrated me severely because the only reason our house is clean, is because I clean it frequently. We have two dogs, which have medium-short hair but shed a ton. He works a weird schedule - 6 day work week 2 of them being off days. I don’t work, I am disabled due to various injuries and I get paid because of it. This is where it gets hairy. On disability I get a little over 4000, whereas he makes roughly 2000. So when it comes to division of money, I make more. We had a conversation about what I do around the house during the day, and things like splitting chores. I don’t ask him to do much ever, but I have been regularly asking him to put away dinner and load the dishwasher. 

So one of the problems lie with something he told me the other day, he was upset with me on week one because there was one night that I took a nap and he thought I didn’t make food, which I did and it was delicious. But he was actually angry over that and told me after the fact. And then there’s the part where I’m slowly noticing him doing less and less, and asking me to do more or expecting that it gets done. An example is that he ate cookies with milk the one night and his cookie cup stayed on the coffee table for several days, because I didn’t pick it up after him. 

Lastly but not least, and here’s why I put our monthly salaries in. He said something about how he would expect me to do more/put in more if I didn’t make as much as I did. As in being the only person to cook/clean, and still packing his work meals. But I’m already doing all of that. Every single day. That’s all I freaking do. I moved 300 miles away from my family and I have no friends here, all I do is clean and read. 

I guess I’m just feeling a little jaded over the whole thing because I feel like I’m constantly asking for just a little bit of help because I can’t regularly do things like sweeping/mopping, or bending over without pain.

Hello everyone!

I’ll try to explain the situation briefly:

About a year ago, I worked with someone professionally for a few months during my training at the company. I always liked him. We got along well. And I always assumed that I was at least likable to him because he’d hug me every now and then (sometimes even longer when alcohol was flowing at a Christmas party, for example), and we genuinely had a good time. More than usual, I’d say. He’d also ask how I was doing after my time there, sometimes even calling me. But after about six months, that stopped. A year later, I still couldn’t get him out of my head, so I messaged him on WhatsApp to see if he’d like to meet for coffee. He immediately replied with “Sure” and suggested we pick a day.

The meeting was a bit strange and not very positive. He wasn’t in a particularly good mood and criticized the café I’d chosen so much that we ended up going somewhere else.

As for his criticism of the café, he said it was too outdated and the clientele was too old. The café is in a 5-star hotel, so it was actually quite nice, and he’d agreed to it beforehand and even checked the opening hours. But when we got there, he didn’t want to go in. I think that says more about him than about me. The meeting lasted about two hours.

Anyway, toward the end, he mentioned that he’s apparently in a relationship now. In that moment, I felt pretty deceived and almost burst into tears.

He casually mentioned her in passing towards the end, like “yeah, that’s my girlfriend’s friend’s brother…” Even though I asked him multiple times during the conversation what was going on in his life and how he was doing, he didn’t mention her at all.

He ended the meeting with just a hug and “It was nice.” Well, what else could he say if he has a girlfriend?

I really had no idea I had misinterpreted everything... or that we were just talking past each other. Am I the fool here? Or is his behavior strange?

When a young woman asks a man out for coffee, isn’t that usually seen as a date? That’s how I’ve always understood it, especially when there’s no special occasion. We’d never met privately before either. Of course, I didn’t confess my feelings to him.

A few days later, he even wished me a happy birthday via WhatsApp (he actually remembered). Apparently, for him, everything seemed completely normal.

What do you think? I need advice. I’m heartbroken over this. I feel really sad really dumb for meeting up with a guy who’s already taken. How can I best move on from this?

At this point, I’ve removed his number for self-preservation because I find everything about this situation so horrible.

I've pretty much been struggling with... pretty much everything for as long as I can remember. Dry flaky skin, my face gets real greasy through the day, dark spots come even if I don't touch the pimple, and of course I'm very prone to acne. Skin is very textured and sensitive especially on my forehead and cheeks. Most of my pimples are those little ones that when you pop them feel rock hard (blackheads i think?). But this is currently the worst my skin has ever been. (Pictures included that i took this morning). 

I included a picture of my current products. Laroche posay purifying foaming cleanser
Axis-y dark spot corrector serum
Laroche posay double repair moisturizer 
Cerave renewing SA cleanser

I pretty much do the same thing every day, morning and night-- cleanser, serum, moisturizer. I use the Cerave SA cleanser 1-2x per week at the moment. I used to use it every day but I felt like it might very been a bit too harsh on my skin. The routine definitely needs work for sure. So many products out there lol it's overwhelming! I wash my face with warm water and rinse off with cool water.

Some life details~ I recently moved to upstate new york from georgia for work (NOT great for my eczema lol so cold!) I work in a factory environment, so my skin probably gets pretty dirty throughout the day though i try my best not to touch my face as much as i can. It's an anxious habit of mine I'm trying to kick, picking at scabs and stuff. 

Diet wise I'm definitely a sugar and carb girl, I admit. I love coffee and pasta and seafood. Definitely need some changes there and I'm gonna work on it. Also getting in more water for sure. 

That's all the details I can think of to share. Feel free to ask me any more questions. I'd love to here suggestions on how I can fix my face haha. It's getting harder and harder to look in the mirror 🙃 Greatly appreciate any help or tips.

My flavours/tasting notes are on point (to my taste) and I've never had better tasting coffee at home! It took me a while to dial in to my taste but I'm really pleased. I prefer the brighter/sweeter/funkier flavours more than a full body. I just don't get that same feeling of caffeination unless I get the cafe's pourover. Aside from their obviously higher skills/knowledge/technique, they use an origami brewer and I'm using a v60 (switch open, haven't tried immersion yet). This has been across multiple bags of light roast specialty coffee of different (single) origins, roasters, and processes.

* Grinding at 95 clicks on my Kingrinder K6
* Brewing at 95c
* Pre-heated brewer + rinsed filter
* 22.3g to 350ml (1:15 ratio, same numbers as cafe)
* 5 equal 70ml pours
* First pour followed by a 45 second bloom with wet WDT
* Wiggle/swirl after the last pour to level bed

Any advice on how to extract more caffeine? I assumed it would come alongside the great flavours I'm getting, but I guess not? Is it just the setting of the cafe that makes me ***feel*** more caffeinated? Am I doing something wrong? Any advice is appreciated! Thanks from a newbie!

***spice***

The lab is cold,

sterile walls echoing with the sound of my steps.

The hum of machinery buzzes all around me, 

distracting and lulling me into complacency.

My neatly ordered thoughts slip loose unnoticed,

drifting freely to the floor to gather in unswept piles,

scattered leaves grown to be lost.

&nbsp;

I run the same tests again, again, again.

Pipettes filled with precision I can measure but not feel.

Beakers bloom with the same expected results.

Neutral, gray, safe.

I tell myself this is progress,

the familiar equations,

the controlled outcomes,

a flawless repetition of competence.

The whispers of failure and risk are muted here,

planned and compensated for.

Yet so is everything else.

&nbsp;

I think of the faces outside the walls,

seeing in but obscured from me,

their approval like shadows on the other side of fogged glass.

Every calculation an offering to their expectations,

every result bent into shapes they’d recognize as success.

&nbsp;


And yet.

The quiet voice inside me,

a mistake in the data I willingly spared from the eraser.

Soft but unrelenting,

asking, offering,
 
if this is the answer I was seeking.

I bury it under a mountain of data.

&nbsp;


Then one day,

she comes.

&nbsp;


She does not belong here,

this woman who carries the smell of smoke and saffron,

whose hard hands are dusted with soft flour,

whose laughter tastes like cinnamon.

She stands at the threshold of my sterile world

and calls it suffocating.

&nbsp;


Before I can stop her,

she’s adding things to the experiment.

A pinch of paprika that will surely burn.

A splash of vinegar that bubbles and spits.

Her instinct is chaos,

she does not measure, she does not weigh.

Her tools are wooden spoons and fingertips,

experience and intuition.

&nbsp;


The results should be ruinous,

and they are.

Colors bloom where there were none before,

violent reds and shimmering golds.

Smoke rises, curling into shapes I cannot name.

The formulas break apart and form breathtaking things,

things that I can not find on my books and charts.

&nbsp;


But there is life here now,

wild and untamed.

Beautiful, terrifying.

And I,

I cannot look away.

&nbsp;


She grins, wiping her hands on an apron stained with experiments of her own,

evidence of a life before her arrival,

burn marks and fraying but also memories and lessons learned.


&nbsp;


“Try it,” she says.

Her voice is warm.

Coffee held in cold hands.

&nbsp;


I dip a cautious finger into the chaos,

let it stain my skin,

then my lips.

The taste is unfamiliar,

a collision of sweet and bitter and something that lingers,

sharp as truth.

&nbsp;


I realize then.

I have never been scared of the process,

I have been afraid of the hunger.

Of wanting too much,

of letting the heat of my own desires consume me.

But now, the fire feels like home.


&nbsp;


So I take the beakers, the pipettes, the rules,

and shatter them.

I invent new methods.

Ones that start with questions instead of answers,

Ones that taste like possibility,

Ones that burn my tongue but also dance on it

Ones that leave me craving more.

&nbsp;


The lab is alive with color and sound.

It is messy.

It is mine.

&nbsp;


And she stays.

Her laughter fills the spaces between my doubts.

Her voice gathers the scattered leaves into messy piles,

so that we may jump and roll in them together.

Making new messes, new reasons to keep creating.


&nbsp;


The future stretches out before us,

an endless experiment.

Not perfect, but vibrant.

Not safe, but mine.

And for the first time,

as I set my own cup before myself,

I do not measure before I pour.",3,1738170970.0,actuallesbians,1,1.0,False

I'm in a long distance relationship with a partner who was diagnosed with BPD this past year after thinking it was Bipolar for a while. We met in fall of 2023, and officially started dating in spring of 2024. It is important for context to mention that we are polyamorous - I am living with my nesting partner of nearly 6 years. They currently aren't dating anyone else due to all the emotional turmoil they're struggling with, but they've always seemed fairly content with the dynamic. Sometimes jealousy arises and we talk about it and work through it, but as far as I know this relationship dynamic doesn't seem to be exacerbating things for them.

In the fall of 2024, they really hit rock bottom and ended up in the hospital for the night. No attempts made, but some self harm for sure. This came after weeks of progressively more intense doom texting, lots of refrains of ""I'm done"" and ""I can't do this anymore"" and ""nothing matters"". This period was predated by a really intense obsession with their favorite band and the tour they were on, which at times was a lot but also it made them happy so even if I got tired of talking about it all the time, I wanted to support it because seeing them happy was such a relief. Once that bright spot passed, they declined very intensely.

It came to a head when I was having a talk with them because I was at my wits end and they were having a uniquely bad night - I don't want them to feel like they can't come to me for support, but it got to the point that whenever ANYTHING set them off, whether it was traffic or some other relatively 'normal' inconvenience, I'd have to talk them off the ledge. More of our communication was me talking them down rather than us talking about like, life and other points of connection. They said they'd try to rein it in a bit, but they were already having an awful night, so they got a ride to the hospital because they were worried they'd hurt themself. 

We are basically back at this same point now - after their last hospitalization, they started getting a bit better. They entered an outpatient therapy program and started family therapy, and eventually got a new job at a coffee shop chain. They hate the job but it's allowing them to pay the bills, y'know? It's definitely been a trigger for them but they've been so below water that they can barely manage to think about finding a new job, let alone apply for one. They had a few goodish months where they had stuff in their life to keep them motivated and happy - a new favorite show, reconnecting with some old friends, and a really good run for their favorite football team. They also made some progress in this outpatient group and learned some new coping methods and all that and seemed to be making progress. Not always a straight line, but a general upward trend. But once the football team's run ended, they hit rock bottom just like in the fall after their favorite band's tour.

I don't resent them for this, I know they need help and they're doing their best, but I simply can't be there for every single negative thought and it was really starting to bleed into my life in ways that made it hard for me to function even from a distance. I care about them so much and want to help them as much as I can but I was anxious 24/7 and having minor panic attacks because they were being so volatile and I was so scared for them. Right now I've had to step away several times to cry while typing this because I'm so scared for them and so emotionally frazzled by this all. I love them and I'm so scared for them.

I don't want to be paternalistic, this is their life, but I am so afraid that they'll keep ending up back here because it's too hard for them to work on investing in long-term efforts to make life easier - things like signing up for disability, looking into jobs that suit them better, trying to establish hobbies or maintain friendships, etc. I know it's incredibly hard to do these things, even without BPD, but we often talk and have loose plans about maybe doing X or doing Y but then something bad comes along a few days later and those plans always fly out the window.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to leave because when things are good they're great! But the good is fading right now and they are having trouble taking steps to dig out of this hole outside of just getting through each day. I can't blame them for not being able to find a better job or like put themselves out there that much, I know they're carrying such a massive burden and surviving with it is a feat in and of itself, not to mention the job market is AWFUL. I'm just worried it'll be this constant cycle of rock bottom > slight improvements > hyperfixation and distraction, leading them to temporary happiness without setting up 'safety nets' for the inevitable crash when the fixation eventually passes > rock bottom again. 

I don't know what I'm looking for out of this post, but if you have any advice please I need anything you've got ",2,1738170885.0,BPD,2,1.0,False

I'm trying to figure out what I'm missing here, and I think a good first step is figuring out the fundamentals of what exactly ""dating"" is.

Sure I'm young, but I feel like I missed ""the ground floor"" when it comes to dating, like I'm missing the base mechanics that makes the rest of it make sense. It'd be like if you gave a kindergartener a physics 102 textbook with the first 50 pages missing, and expecting him to understand what was going on. 

The fact that It seems like new rules get added changed and removed every 3 weeks doesn't help. I don't know what a ""three month rule"" or ""double texting"" or whatever is. Jesus Christ, I'm looking for a girlfriend, not trying to meta spec my charicter build in a video game.

For example, I didn't realize that dating != girlfriend until embarrassingly late, probably in my mid teens. I assumed if you were dating someone, you were in a relationship with them. I didn't realize that dating was the trial phase, and that most people are actually talking to/dating multiple people, and only after a few dates is a relationship ""official"" (I think? Like I said, this is all new to me). 

The little experience I have hasn't helped much either. I asked a girl out to grab coffee, and she told me she'd be out of town for a bit but would be happy to join me when she was back. Success! ...Until she got back and I followed up on it, where she said ""oh, full disclosure I have a boyfriend, but I'm still down to grab a coffee as freinds"". A little disappointing, but hey she's cool and I've made a new freind. Success! ...Until I got a text from her boyfriend (she was my coworker. I would buy coffee from her so often, she'd memorized my rewards points phone number) saying ""Hey man, you seem cool, and I respect the hustle, but she's not gonna meet up"". 
Welp, I tried. 
Maybe my initial coffee proposal wasn't explicit enough, maybe she just didn't want to say ""no"" to my face, maybe it's something else entirely. She knows, and I don't. 
Between that and randomly getting ghosted on apps after a whopping 2 whole messages, I can't say I've gotten a lot of answers.

That's where you come in dear citizen! I want you to pretend I'm an alien that crash landed in your backyard. I don't know anything about anything, and you've gotta explain to me how dating works. I'm not asking ""how do I date successfully"" I'm asking ""what is dating?"". Step by step, how does it normally unfold?

The surgery to remove my kidney was fine and the cancer itself is fine. But it’s left me with a lot of chronic issues. 

The main one is methane dominant SIBO. Which has thus far been treatment resistant. It also caused extreme shortness of breath which is killing me. 

A lot of people with this disease have a lot of success by temporarily doing carnivore. 


I was advised to come here for advice.  

So the first is. Is this safe for me with one kidney. Or are there any pitfalls I’d have to look out for?

Methane SIBO causes terrible motility. Going carnivore would cut out all the things I eat for motility like chia and certain water soluble fiber sources. What are people’s experiences with constipation and the carnivore diet?

Do supplements screw this up if they are plant derived. I take Allicin (garlic) ginger, artichoke, and neem which are all powdered plant based supplements? 

Can I continue to take those and still be considered carnivore ?

Can you do small amounts of sauces?

Can you use spices outside of salt and pepper?

Can you drink coffee?

How dangerous is carnivore for cholesterol? Should I get a baseline reading before starting ? Or check it while I’m on it?


Any advice or any resources anyone can think of would be good to read would be appreciated. Or any advise for meals or brands for whatever. 

I’m at wits end with this. And doctors just aren’t helping me anymore.  And so many people report this fixing their SIBO I’ve tried everything else I figure why not. ",1,1738170292.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False

I wanted to share what I did and how I studied so maybe that can help someone in the future. 
My first attempt I only seriously studied for about a week and went into the exam blind my exam timed out at 33 questions and I knew I had failed before my results even came out. 

My second attempt I studied on and off for about 2 months and then 3 weeks before my exam I hunkered down and studied every single day for 8 hours per day. I cannot recommend this enough but Repetition, repetition and repetition!!!

In my exam it was mostly Math - this is a subject I’ve struggled with my whole life and unfortunately everyone is right practice does make perfect, you seriously have to practice math every single day so you don’t have think twice about how to go about solving a math problem during your exam. You need to be on autopilot once you see a math problem because ofcourse you can solve something in 10-15 mins if you have the time to think about it. 
My exam was mostly Biostats and PK, I would make sure to know how to interpret ARR, OR, HR, NTT,NHH not just how to solve it. For PK I used Chatgpt to write me problems because UWorld did not have enough problems for me to full understand how to tackle each problem. Tbh I used Chatgpt whenever I couldn’t solve something because it gave a clearer explanation and steps to solve problems whereas uworld explainations were too complicated and there’s easier ways to go about the problems. 
For the clinical portion, I used PNN lectures (I got the notes from someone on reddit - thanks!!!) for my second attempt and honestly it was a godsend. Rxprep book has too much unnecessary information, and it got really confusing studying.
The pattern I noticed during my attempts is that you need to know every BBW, safety considerations and any unique characteristics of a drug/disease state along with the first line treatment. 
Once I got the hang of studying I finally understood how things are connected and each disease state is dependent on the other in some cases. 
Things I would definitely know are: 
-Drugs that cause renal disease
-Drugs safe to use during renal disease 
-Drugs to separate from antacids 
-Drugs you need to take with food
-BBW of drugs (I used the FDA website and just made a list - nothing in detail just what it causes/what to do)
- Acute/Critical care: DO NOT SKIP THIS CHAPTER. You need to understand hyper and hypo calcium,sodium,potassium, phosphate, magnesium and how to treat each state. 
-Pregnancy. You need to know each and everything about pregnancy- I made a whole other document listing each disease state and how to treat it during pregnancy. I had questions on pregnant pts about how to treat UTI, Hypertensive emergency, hypertension, seizure disorder, thyroid disorders
- Thyroid- DO NOT SKIP this chapter - Know that both PTU and methimazole are hepatotoxic but only PTU has BBW, know when to use each drug during each trimester of pregnancy (they tell you pt is in 12 weeks pregnant or 32 weeks pregnant etc), KNOW that levothyroxine dosing is based on TSH levels (not T4) 
- Diabetes - BUD of insulin, warnings for DPP4i, GLP-1RA 
- Know drugs that are hepatotoxic
-How to dispose Lithium(mix in coffee grounds)
-Monitoring for pregnancy when using hydroxyurea
- Lamotrigine starter packs and WHY we use them
-ID : Know the shapes and stains for each gram positives and negatives and know how to treat each infection- my exam only had CAP, cystitis, PCN allergy cephalosporin 
Cardio- know EVERYTHING ABOUT HEART FAILURE

---------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to creating a cozy farmhouse kitchen, a warm and inviting atmosphere is key. This style blends rustic charm with functionality, making it the perfect space to gather with family and friends. Here are essential elements and decor tips to help you design your dream kitchen.

### Color Palette

The color palette for a farmhouse kitchen should evoke the soothing tones of nature. Consider using soft whites, muted grays, and pastel shades. These colors work wonders in making the space feel airy and spacious. Accents in earthy tones like sage green, sky blue, or warm beige can also add depth.

### Open Shelving

Open shelving is a hallmark of the farmhouse aesthetic. Not only does it provide easy access to your favorite cookware, but it also allows for creative displays. Here are some tips:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-decor-farmhouse-kitchen  
  
- Use reclaimed wood for a rustic touch.
- Mix and match dishes and mugs for a casual vibe.
- Incorporate plants or decorative jars to add personality.

### Farmhouse Sink

A large farmhouse sink serves as both a functional and stylish focal point. It’s perfect for washing vegetables or filling large pots. Opt for an apron-front style in materials like stainless steel or fireclay for durability and class. Pair it with a classic gooseneck faucet to complete the look.

### Lighting Fixtures

The right lighting can transform your farmhouse kitchen. Layer your lighting with a combination of pendant lights, recessed lights, and under-cabinet lighting.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-decor-farmhouse-kitchen  
  
- **Pendant lights:** Hanging pendant lights above an island add charm and draw the eye upwards.
- **Recessed lights:** These provide a soft, even glow that's perfect for cooking and entertaining.
- **Under-cabinet lights:** These are crucial for practical workspace illumination.

### Wooden Elements

Wood creates warmth in a farmhouse kitchen. Think about installing hardwood floors or using wooden beams on your ceiling. Antique or reclaimed wood tables and chairs add character and vintage appeal. Don’t forget to include wooden cutting boards and utensils for functional decor.

### Textiles and Patterns

Textures play an important role in the overall coziness of the kitchen. Use soft textiles such as checked or striped tablecloths, cotton dish towels, and plush rugs. Patterns can inject life into your space, so mix and match fabrics to create an inviting area. Consider incorporating:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-decor-farmhouse-kitchen  
  
- Checkered patterns for table linens.
- Floral prints for curtains or cushions.
- Knitted throws for a warm touch.

### Decorative Accents

Decorative accents can bring your farmhouse kitchen to life. Antique jars, vintage cookbooks, and handmade pottery are perfect for adding charm. Here are some ideas for decorative elements:

- Use a large chalkboard for notes, menus, or recipe ideas.
- Display seasonal decor like pumpkins in the fall or fresh herbs in the summer.
- Select a statement piece like a retro clock or an old farm sign.

### Efficient Layout

A cozy kitchen isn’t just about how it looks; it’s also about how it functions. Make sure your layout is efficient. The classic work triangle between the sink, stove, and refrigerator ensures that you can move around freely while cooking. If space allows, include an island for extra prep space and socializing.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-decor-farmhouse-kitchen  
  
### Personal Touches

Don’t forget to add personal touches. Display family photos, collections, or heirloom items to make the space uniquely yours. Small details, like a handwritten recipe on the wall or a cherished dish on display, can evoke memories and create a sense of home.

By incorporating these essential elements and thoughtful decor tips, you can create a farmhouse kitchen that is not only beautiful but also functional and ultimately cozy. This space should reflect your personality and welcome loved ones, making every meal a cherished moment.

Practical Storage Solutions for a Stylish Farmhouse Kitchen
-----------------------------------------------------------

Creating a farmhouse kitchen is all about marrying functionality with rustic charm. A well-appointed kitchen provides ample storage while exuding warmth and style. Here are some practical storage solutions to help you achieve that cozy farmhouse feel without sacrificing organization.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-decor-farmhouse-kitchen  
  
### Open Shelving for Easy Access

Open shelving is a fantastic way to showcase your dishware and kitchen accessories. Not only does it make everything easily accessible, but it also infuses personality into your space. Consider using reclaimed wood for shelves to enhance the rustic theme. You can:

- Display colorful dishes or vintage glassware
- Add potted herbs for a touch of greenery
- Layer your items for a more visually appealing arrangement

Remember to keep the items on your shelves tidy and organized. Regularly declutter to maintain that clean farmhouse aesthetic.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-decor-farmhouse-kitchen  
  
### Utilize Trolley Carts

Trolley carts are incredibly versatile and can serve various purposes in your farmhouse kitchen. You can use them for extra counter space, ingredient storage, or even as a coffee station. Look for one that fits your style, such as:

- Wooden carts with metal accents
- Vintage-style rolling carts to add charm
- Modern designs for a sleek contrast

Position the cart near your main work area for easy access, or tuck it away when not in use. This flexibility is perfect for smaller kitchens that need adaptable solutions.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-decor-farmhouse-kitchen  
  
### Maximize Cabinet Space

Your kitchen cabinets are essential for storage, but they can often feel cramped. Here are ways to make the most of cabinet space:

- Install pull-out shelves or drawers for easier access to items in the back
- Use stackable organizers to make use of vertical space
- Add dividers to keep lids and pans neatly arranged

Consider painting your cabinets in a light, airy color to brighten the space while enhancing the farmhouse vibe.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-decor-farmhouse-kitchen  
  
### Incorporate Vintage Storage Containers

Embrace the farmhouse aesthetic by incorporating vintage storage containers. Not only do they provide practical storage solutions, but they also serve as decorative elements. Look for:

- Glass jars for pantry items like grains and spices
- Wooden crates to store produce or other essentials
- Antique treasure chests or boxes for a charming touch

Grouping similar containers on open shelves or countertops creates an organized yet rustic display.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-decor-farmhouse-kitchen  
  
### Hidden Storage Options

Make use of hidden storage to keep your kitchen clutter-free. Here are some clever ideas:

- Use the space above your cabinets to store less frequently used items
- Install magnetic strips on the wall for knives and metal utensils, freeing up drawer space
- Find furniture pieces like benches or ottomans with storage options to tuck away items

These solutions can help maintain an airy, open feel in your kitchen while still providing functionality.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-decor-farmhouse-kitchen  
  
### Coordinate Your Colors

While this might not seem directly related to storage, coordinating colors can make your kitchen look more organized. Stick to a palette that reflects a cozy farmhouse feel, such as whites, soft pastels, or earthy tones. This will help your storage solutions blend seamlessly into your kitchen while still standing out as decorative pieces.

### Label Your Storage Solutions

Don’t underestimate the power of labeling. Clear labels on jars and containers can make your kitchen look more organized and professional. Use rustic tags or chalkboard labels that tie back to the farmhouse theme. This not only helps you find what you need quickly but also adds a personalized touch to your storage solutions.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-decor-farmhouse-kitchen  
  
By incorporating these practical storage solutions into your farmhouse kitchen, you can create a space that is both stylish and functional. Your kitchen will not only reflect your personality but will also cater to your everyday needs, ensuring you can cook, entertain, and enjoy life in a space you love.

### Conclusion

Creating a cozy farmhouse kitchen blends style with functionality, making it the heart of the home. As you design this inviting space, remember to incorporate essential elements such as warm colors, natural materials, and rustic accents. A well-chosen color palette can evoke the warmth of a country retreat, while elements like shiplap walls, open shelving, and vintage decor add character. You can also mix modern appliances with traditional touches for a seamless look that honors the farmhouse style.

Storage is key in any kitchen, especially in a farmhouse setting where both form and function matter. Embrace open shelving to display charming dishware and glass jars filled with pantry staples. Incorporate vintage baskets and wooden crates for stylish yet practical storage solutions. This not only helps you keep your kitchen organized but also maintains that charming farmhouse aesthetic.

But is it really worth it? While having multiple memberships gives you options, spreading your points too thin can make it harder to actually enjoy the perks. Plus, not all loyalty programs offer the same experience. Some make it easy for you to redeem rewards, while others have complicated rules or require a lot of spending before you see any real value. I think a great program should feel rewarding, not frustrating. If you’re constantly checking if your points expire, struggling with clunky apps, or feeling like you never reach a freebie, then, it’s not adding to your coffee experience.

I've recently started sitting down at a coffee shop to get out of the house (WFH) and they don't have many outlets available.

I get maybe 9 hours of juice while working online. Nothing too hard core, just on Chrome with >15 tabs open. No Bluetooth, 2nd screen, or music to drain the battery. Power saver mode's on, albeit I do have the brightness up to about 70% (not an ultra HD screen)

I *DO* need to replace the internal battery as it's at 30%. I think replacing it might get me an extra hour or two but I was expecting the 72W giganto-battery to last longer. 

The 72W battery would drop by about 15% every hour.

I like getting drinks from the Starbucks at work, which you can order ahead from on the app (not like grocery stores that have a starbucks affiliate coffee bar). I have receipts from previous times when I've given them my personal cup and they would apply the discount at that store. Today, I ordered a cold brew and gave them my personal cup, but saw that they didn't apply the discount. When I brought up the discount and that they've given the discount before, the barista said they don't do that. They even asked someone else who confirmed what they said and even added that they ""don't have the system to do that."" I didn't want to press them on it since there was a line forming and I felt bad for holding them up.

I'm more annoyed about the 25 stars than the 10 cent discount. I also didn't know that a store can just stop honoring the personal cup discount when they used to before just a few weeks prior. However, online, I can still put in a personal cup option for that store, but I've never done that before since I was never sure how it worked and wasn't sure if the discount would be honored at checkout. I guess I'll take this as a lesson to just order drinks and apply the personal cup discount on the app instead of going in person. I may do that later today for my second cup of coffee lol. May make an edit later on what happens then.

If anyone has had this issue before, please share. If anyone is a batista, I'd love to know what is done on your end to apply the discount at checkout and what prevents certain stores from applying it. I'm sure it's a long shot, but if anyone knows if there's a way to at least get the stars for using the personal cup, I'd really appreciate it.

Just wanted to vent since I work at an ER and at 50+ hrs this week. Coffee is honestly one of the things that keeps me going mentally and physically in this jungle haha. Very sorry if this came off entitled. Thank you for listening to my ramblings.

Context:
I'm in a 4 month relationship and we started as LDR. Seaman si boyfriend and last Nov sya umuwi pero paalis na ulit sya this week.

Nung online pa lang kami ok naman masaya, every break nya or pag gising nya and after his work constant naman sya sa pag msg ang pag tawag sakin. Nung umuwi sya nung una ganun pa din but eventually nag bago nung naka ramdam sya ng mild depression (not diagnosed) kasi he isolated himself (pero ang totoo ako lang naman yung sinabihan nya na gusto nya mapagisa and nakikipag kita pa din naman sya sa friends nya). Yung isolation from me lasted for 15 days, no contact. 

After that isolation yung daily flow ng conversation namin is nagbago. No more good mornings and how are you. Madalas sa gabi na lang sya nag cchat and about random stuff lang like about sa pamangkin nya, about sa kapatid nya, etc. Then sa gabi call bago matulog, mga max na yung 30 mins lang. 

Pag magkasama naman kami we are good, masaya. Mga 2x a week lang kami mag kita. Madalas food trip or coffee trip sa mga nakikita nya sa TT na mga lugar. Or sa bahay nya kami, nag ML or nilalaro yung pamangkin nya. One time I tried na mag ask ng mga questions I googled para sa mga mag partner para may sense naman yung time namin together. Kaya lang ang sagot nya is puro wala, di ko alam, go with the flow lang, and so on.

For context, hindi sya malambing na tao, di din sya vocal. I can't even remember when was the last time na nag I love you sya sakin, hindi I love you TOO. And since ugali ko i mirror kung ano pinapakita ng tao sakin ganun din ako sa kanya. When he ignored yung good morning ko, yung I miss you and I love you, I stopped it. Pero I feel naman na mahal naman nya ko (or baka feeling ko lang yun) I love him pero sobrang bored na ko sa relationship namin. I feel na wala syang lalim. Also to add, he told me na he can't take negativity like ayaw nya nakakarinig ng negative kasi pag inabsorb daw nya nag ttrigger daw ng anxiety nya.

Di ko alam what to do. I want to stay in this relationship pero I'm not happy.
How can I tell him how I feel without making it sound negative?

Previous Attempts: I tried to talk to him ng serious about other matter and he acknowledged it naman pero di ako naka abot sa concern na toh kasi ramdam ko na nalulungkot na sya.",1,1738169598.0,adviceph,3,1.0,False

I am guilty of drinking multiple a day sometimes because I honestly am just in love with the flavour more than anything. I am currently looking into ordered matcha powder on Amazon when I am able to, but until then I will continue to purchase matcha from various coffee shops that offer it.

I usually order it from Starbucks because my partner works there and lets me use their discount when we go together and I know that at Starbucks they add classic (it was liquid cane sugar before for anyone who isn’t aware that they changed the recipe and way of making it… Which sucks), so, naturally when I am ordering matcha from a coffee shop I didn’t know offered the drink before I ask if they pre-sweeten it.

I know that usually people don’t add sweetener to matcha, but I like iced matcha lattes specifically, and I am very used to Starbucks. I mean this in the nicest way possible; feel like I genuinely need someone to explain to me why whenever I ask if a coffee shop adds liquid cane sugar or classic to their matcha lattes they look at me very confused?

I feel like the interactions I’ve had when I ask about how they make their matcha is the most wild question they have ever had and they don’t understand what I’m asking…

I don’t disclose that I’m a diabetic because I don’t feel like it’s relevant (Correct me if I’m wrong! I’m still learning and am coming up on 1 year since my diagnosis), but I don’t like the feeling of being judged by the employee for asking a dietary question and I’m not sure how to avoid that.

I understand food service workers are not educated on diabetic food restrictions in their training (When I was in food service I know I wasn’t, but I was educated on allergies, intolerances, and celiac), but the feeling of judgement doesn’t feel nice considering my whole life had turned upside down and I can’t live as freely as others and part of that is not being able to order drinks without asking questions beforehand.

I am open to any feedback, and I am in no ways faulting food service workers for simply not being educated on a whole area of food restrictions, but I am trying to express that they are responsible for the way they react and that judgement is not an acceptable reaction to a question regarding a recipe.

If you’ve been keeping an eye on the latest developments in natural wellness, you’ve probably heard about CBG, or cannabigerol. Often referred to as the ""mother of all cannabinoids,"" CBG is rapidly gaining popularity for its incredible benefits and potential therapeutic effects. Whether you’re looking for a natural way to enhance focus, reduce stress, or support overall health, CBG might just be the game-changer you need.

# What is CBG and Where Does It Come From?

CBG is one of the many cannabinoids found in the hemp plant. According to [Verywell Mind,](https://www.verywellmind.com/cannabigerol-cbg-uses-and-benefits-5085266#:~:text=CBG%20shares%20many%20similarities%20with,can%20counteract%20THC's%20psychotropic%20effects) unlike THC, it doesn’t produce psychoactive effects, meaning you won’t experience a “high.” Instead, CBG interacts with the body’s endocannabinoid system to promote balance and support various bodily functions. What makes CBG unique is that it serves as a precursor to other cannabinoids, including [CBD and THC](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-022-01478-z), meaning it’s present in younger hemp plants before breaking down into other compounds.

Because CBG is found in such small amounts in hemp (usually less than 1%), it’s more difficult to extract, making it one of the rarer and more valuable cannabinoids on the market today.

# Why Use CBG? The Benefits You Need to Know

CBG is packed with benefits that can help improve daily life. Here are some key reasons people are turning to CBG:

* **Supports Focus and Mental Clarity** – Unlike CBD, which is often associated with relaxation, CBG has been [shown ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11597810/)to promote alertness and enhance cognitive function. If you struggle with brain fog or trouble concentrating, CBG might be the perfect addition to your routine.
* **Reduces Stress and Anxiety** – Many users find that CBG provides a calming effect, helping to ease tension without making them feel drowsy. According to [WSU Insider,](https://news.wsu.edu/press-release/2024/07/31/cannabinoid-cbg-reduces-anxiety-and-stress-in-first-human-clinical-trial/) *research* revealed that 20 mg of hemp-derived *CBG* significantly reduced feelings of anxiety at 20, 45 and 60 minutes after ingestion compared to a placebo.
* **Supports a Healthy Gut** – [Science Direct ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006295213000543)says CBG has been studied for its potential to help with digestive issues, including inflammation in the gut and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
* **Anti-Inflammatory Properties** – Whether you deal with joint discomfort or general inflammation, the [Mayo Clinic](https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/cbg-not-cbd-oil-for-neuropathy/) says CBG may offer relief due to its powerful anti-inflammatory effects.
* **Neuroprotective Benefits** – Early [research ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780323900362000399)suggests CBG could support brain health and may even help protect against neurodegenerative conditions.

From personal experience, I’ve noticed that CBG has helped me stay sharp throughout the day without the jitteriness I sometimes get from caffeine. I take it in the morning, and it keeps me feeling focused and balanced—no afternoon crash, just steady energy.

For some context, we are all emigrants and trying to learn the new language and this is how we all met. Somehow everybody else had to go and was busy and something made me stay behind, even though I hardly know her.
I know that her husband is out of the country for work for a few months and thought she just wanted company.
Around a warm lunch, she started telling me how she is relived that her husband is away for a few months. It's just her and their 5 year old daughter. And she started telling me about all the abuse. I let her talk and told her that I was there, that she wasn't alone, I also left an abusive relationship last year.
I talked to her about Lundy Bancroft book, she asked me if she could find solutions in it and as I only read less than half I couldn't answer.
Will this book help her?
I was so taken aback by it all that I might not have said everything I could have.
I said that I believed her, that nobody deserves to be treated that way...
I told her we could meet again for a coffee or something else anytime.
What else can I do to help her?

The thoroughfare came to a cement ramp that led up to the megalith itself. Large glass doors stood open, and inside, Jane could see lights.

Dozens of Christmas trees of every size, color, and combination decorated the expansive lobby. Little crystal ones like Stefan’s lined a red carpet that led to a massive reception desk. Lasha bounded to this and took a seat behind it like a professional.

Jane stepped through the doorway. Immediately she was overwhelmed by a sense of having forgotten something crucial that she needed to do. She turned back to the entrance and felt a cold fear.

“The White Witch’s magic,” said Ciris. She took her hand and pulled her in. “I will guide you.”

Two trees with branches painted white and bedecked in clear lights perched on either end of the desk, saturating Lasha’s face, revealing the deepest emerald eyes Jane had ever seen. His mop of shaggy hair was a luxuriant blond, and freckles spattered his nose and cheeks, the latter blessed with a set of impish dimples that appeared when he smiled, as he did now.

“Can I help you?” he asked.

Stefan roared, “We’re not here for games!”

Picking up a small, silver Christmas tree, Lasha reclined in his chair. The tree was crowned with a solitary, pink star that pulsed bright and dim and cast its blush across his face when he held it close. He inspected the ornament as though his day, until now, had been a tedious monotony.

“We’re here to see the Dreamer,” Ciris declared.

“Oh really. Well, she’s sleeping and doesn’t want to be bothered.”

“I’ll kill him!” Stefan lunged across the desk.

With a kick, Lasha smoothly rolled his chair back, crossed his legs, and continued his exploration of the artifact in his hands.

“State thy business,” Lasha droned.

“There’s a promise, and I intend to keep it,” said Ciris. “This queen needs to get to the Free City. She needs to meet the Orb Thief.

His eyes lit up. “Queen? Queen of where?”

They turned to Jane. She had been watching this droll spectacle unfold as if it had been rehearsed.

“I—” She faltered. The deepening amnesia engulfed her. “I can’t… I don’t… remember.”

“A queen who does not remember cannot see the Dreamer,” said Lasha as if he were reciting from a rulebook.

“It’s the enchantment,” said Ciris. “It springs from here. Think. Think hard. Where are you from?”

Jane closed her eyes, rewinding the clock of her mind—back through the city, the cave, the staircase chiseled into the cliff face, the door, the room with the fireplace, and her moment with Knutson. Down the dark hallway to General Alexi and the other man with the American accent, the coffee and cookies. Through the suburb just outside the blast zone, the military transport and the handsome but sad soldier who was once a surfer boy from California, his story of the orphans, back on the JTS airplane where she’d read the biography of Abraham Lincoln. All the way to Titan Tower in New York. Until she was making love with Christy in front of a television broadcasting drone footage of the protest fires.

“America!” she said, opening her eyes.

“America?” said Lasha, his gaze fixed on her. “I’m sorry, I’ve never heard of it.”

“You little shit!” Stefan roared, slamming his hand flat against the desk.

Lasha erupted into a fit of giggles.

“And I’m not a queen. I’m the President-elect of the United States of America.”

“Fine.” He set down the ornament. “Cost of admission: I want to go. I’m tired of this pocket.”

“No!” said the teens in unison.

“You won’t be alone. There’re the other orphans,” said Ciris.

“They want to eat me!”

“I’m talking about the good ones.”

“And then they’ll all join the hunters, and then I’ll be alone.”

“The old lady will come,” said Stefan. “She likes you, I think.”

“I don’t like her. Stinky witch.” Lasha looked around as though someone was going to jump out and scold him.

“Fine,” said Ciris. “It’s your funeral.”

“No!” exclaimed Stefan. “It’s too dangerous.”

With a sigh, Ciris dropped her shoulders. “Maybe it’s the right path.”

“He’s too small. He can’t even take the beast.”

“I’ll learn. I promise!” Lasha pleaded.

“He can meet the Orb Thief. Better now than later,” said Ciris. “You’ve seen the moon here? It’s full of blood tonight. For all we know, the Chaos will come here first.”

“Fuck!” Stefan turned in a frustrated circle, pointing at the smaller boy. “Just don’t you get yourself killed.”

A victorious smile spread across Lasha’s face.

“Okay. Hurry up. Let’s do it. Off to the Dreamer,” said Stefan with a clap of his hands.

“One more thing.” Lasha crossed his skinny arms.

Stefan grabbed his own scruffy hair and pulled. “What?”

“A kiss.” The boy’s dimples deepened with his devilish grin. “From Ciris.”

“Oh, you little… I will kill you. You’ll wish the howlers got you.”

Ciris put a hand on Stefan’s chest. “It doesn’t matter. Come here.” She leaned across the desk. Lasha approached, a wary eye on the bigger boy. She brought her face near to his, rubbed his nose with hers, and quickly planted a kiss on his lips.”

Lasha collapsed back in his chair, panting. “Wow! The kiss of true love.”

Stefan rolled his eyes.

Lasha set about rearranging the Christmas trees. He started by dragging the largest one that stood guard by the door over to the desk. The two that sat on the desk he put on the floor by the chair.

“Hmm, how does it go?” he mumbled to himself.

This process went on for some time as he crisscrossed the room, setting a tree here and another there, then recalling something and moving a tree he’d just positioned to a new location.

In the middle of the room was a large, empty dais elevated on steps. In another reality, it may have been occupied by a majestic statue of St. George battling the dragon. Lasha carefully gathered all the small tree ornaments and set them in a broad circle, demarcating the perimeter of the dais’s platform.

At last, he said, “Okay, come in here.”

They stepped over the trees into the circle.

Lasha looked around, lifted his hands in a dramatic gesture, and looked around again as if he expected something to happen. Nothing.

“Well?” said Stefan.

Lashed hummed thoughtfully.

“You forgot.”

“No, I didn’t. I never forget.” He cradled his elbow in one hand and tapped his chin with a slender finger. After a moment, his eyes lit up. “Stefan, your tree! That’s it.”

Stefan pulled the small crystal tree from his satchel and handed it to him.

Lasha tapped the top. The blue laser inside of it blinked to life.

The warm, stagnant air of the lobby broke with a cool breeze, causing goosebumps to travel across Jane’s skin.

“You did it, Lasha!” exclaimed Ciris.

“Well, where is she?” said Stefan.

“I don’t know. I think I need another kiss.”

“Lasha!”

“Fine.” He positioned the tree in the circle with the others.

The instant it touched the floor, Jane noticed the bed at the center of the dais.

Déjà vu engulfed her. She should have been shocked at the marvelous manifestation, yet the moment she saw the bed, she felt that it had always existed there, going back years, centuries, eons—only now she was choosing to acknowledge it. It was the kind of bed she remembered from her childhood; unlike any bed that had ever belonged to her, but the elaborate beds from the stories her grandfather, a true raconteur, used to tell her when she was a little girl visiting his secluded cabin nestled deep inside the Allagash wilderness of northern Maine.

The bed was crafted from snow-white wood, smooth and polished to a lustrous sheen that reflected the Christmas tree lights with an ethereal shimmer. The large footboard was meticulously carved into a scene of hounds with gnashing jaws and furious figures hunting a doe across a meadow. While upon a hill, a stag stood stoic, its rack crowning the mural and twisting up and around to form the footposts, which in turn supported a tester of graceful storks. Each stork held in its bill a corner of the chiffon canopy that descended around the bed like a mist as they soared across the sky. The bed’s legs were those of a dragon, its talons piercing the marble of the lobby floor to anchor it; the creature’s spines formed the side panels that supported a thick, voluptuous mattress.

A cool and gentle wind parted the chiffon to reveal a little girl covered in a white sheet, her black hair fanned out in a delta over a plush pillow, and her thumb, damp from her sucking, rested gently against her lips. The head of the dragon, like a great sentinel, stared down at her with wise, serpentine eyes.

With awe, they approached her as though she were an altar, taking in the magnificent bed on which she slumbered. But their gazes always returned to her face, for her sleep was a sight to behold. She was still, as if she were an integral part of the bed itself, as if she were hewn from the same wood by the master’s skilled hand.

“Is she dead?” whispered Lasha.

“No,” said Ciris, “look.”

The lids of her eyes were alive with the flicker and roll of dream sleep. The instant Jane noticed this, she felt a force of work and effort radiating from the sleeping child.

“Lo, the Dreamer,” Ciris said, a reverence in her voice.

“When will it happen?” Lasha asked.

“The witch said to wait,” spoke Stefan. “Dreamers dream what dreamers dream.”

Jane, though unable to comprehend, could not look away. The girl was no older than eight or nine, her black hair matted to her face by sleep’s sweat. Her long eyelashes brushed her cheeks. As the minutes ticked away, the child’s body became more animate—the twitch of a finger, the shifting of a leg, the slight movement of her lips as if to form a word, then let it go.

It was Lasha who finally spoke. “Will it hurt?” he asked.

“I don’t know,” responded Ciris. “It’s different every time. The first time, it hurt. I was sore for weeks.”

“Are you afraid of pain?” Stefan asked.

“No!” the boy shot back, “I’m not afraid anything.”

“Really?”

“Nope.”

“Not even of the Sisters?”

“Nay,” said the boy, wrinkling his nose in a growl.

“Nor of the hunters?”

He prided up his chest, his small hand falling on the hilt of his knife. “Nay!”

“Not of the unknown, the dark and the alone of the Chaos that approaches beyond the Veil? There’s still time to change your mind.”

“Nay. I fear not,” he whispered, almost crying.

Stefan grabbed him and hugged him. “It’s okay to be afraid. It’s just not okay to quit.” Stefan kissed his forehead. “You stay by me and never leave my side. You understand?”

Lasha nodded, tears in his eyes.

“It’ll be a great adventure.”

Suddenly, Ciris spun around and looked back past the desk to the doorway. “Here.” She pulled off her sword and tossed it to Stefan, then leapt down the steps and out into the darkness of the shantytown.

The boys stood still as statues, watching and waiting.

The Dreamer dreamed. Jane could now hear her raspy breath.

The panther burst back through the doorway, bounded up the steps into the circle, and crouched before the bed, where it let out a roar. When it stood, it was Ciris, naked. Sweat covering her skin, her hair was wet and glistened in the light like a dark rainbow.

1icy6qc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CICO/comments/1icy6qc/trying_to_lose_weight_at_a_normal_bmi/,trying to lose weight at a normal BMI,"Hey! Just wanted to come on here and ask some advice in regards to trying to lose some weight as someone who has what's considered a ""healthy/normal"" BMI already.

I currently weigh around 65kg (I actually don't have a scale yet and will be picking one up today) and height wise I'm 172cm - putting my BMI at around 22. My goal is to lose 7-10kg to get into the 55-58kg range. 

I'm eating 1500 a day alongside doing 30-60 minutes of exercise bike and some body weight exercises probably 5 days a week. I do about 7000 steps a day. (Any exercises people find helped them better?)

The main thing I'm struggling with is cravings and being able to stave them off. Last night I went wayyyy off plan (I usually intermittently fast from 8pm to midday/1pm the next day to limit my eating window) and probably ate like 3000 cals (rip) pretty much just cos I was craving chocolate. I tried getting a small bar and eating it slow etc etc and seeing how it went but it just made me more hungry and I just gave up and went crazy eating a ton of stuff that in hindsight I didn't even want that much.

Does anyone have any good tips to prevent this kind of thing happening? I have some stuff in place that usually works like starting my fast at 8pm, not having too low of a deficit, having herbal teas and black coffee when needed + trying to distract myself, but unfortunately sometimes it clearly just doesn't work! I've found myself wondering into the deep dark depths of edtwt looking for tips but obviously it isn't the best place to go looking as I want to avoid any disordered eating practices as I've been there and really just want to lose some weight for myself and my own goals (and stay healthy). 

Also not sure what the consensus is on cheat days? To have one or not to have one...and how often? Just worried about hitting a plateau pretty easily due to already being a normal BMI.

1icy6ej,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1icy6ej/fl_loitering_ticket_in_own_yard/,[FL] Loitering Ticket in Own(?) Yard,"Florida

  
Title may be slightly misleading with the ""own"" yard as I live in a gated townhome in a condo/townhouse complex and that is where my confusion kind of is. I'm in a townhome that has a front garage, driveway, small yard, back patio/unfenced yard, and a sidewalk from the driveway to the front door (not connected to any other sidewalk). The documents state we own from interior walls in, which makes sense as the HOA pays for and contracts out for yard and outdoor maintenance. However obviously despite maybe being common use people don't go hang out in other folks yards, park in their driveways, etc. I am in good standing with the HOA and always pay on time and in full if that is relevant, so according to our documents that means I should have use of our common spaces anyway.

  
What happened is I was sitting on the grass in my front yard area eating my lunch as the weather is nice and sunny after last weeks freeze. I often eat in the back but that was very shady at the time I ate today and I wanted to enjoy the sun. A sheriff's car came by and did a lap around the neighborhood, I assume because we had a shooting (domestic dispute) a week ago and folks have been hounding the HOA for more security than just our security company who basically just does parking tickets. I gave a head not/smile combo for the first go round, then when they came around on the second the police officer exited the vehicle and approached. I said what's up, and they asked what I was doing. I said I was spending my lunch outside enjoying the change of weather, he said what lunch (I'd finished my sandwich) I said I finished but had time left so wanted to be outside in fresh air. He asked what I was doing in the neighborhood and I was like?? I just said, eating lunch in my yard? He said I didn't live there, I said yeah I def do. He made a side comment about loitering and being unemployed when I was like I WFH and I eat outside almost every day and take a walk. Then he asked to see ID and I said it was inside I could go get it if he really needs it, he said no don't move then said he was going to write me up for loitering and refusal to provide ID. I was like this is my house, how is that loitering, and I have my license it's just inside....my house? He asked for my name and DOB and I gave it to him because I didn't want nonviolent resistance or something added too but tried explaining more like hey I have my license, my wallet is literally just inside the door on my bench let me get it, it shows this is my address, and he said he didn't want to hear it and don't go anywhere (the yard is small so we are like 10ft from my front door max). At this point I shut up. He said I was being charged with 856.021 Loitering and Prowling and 901.151 refusal to provide identification. 

  
I feel like this is so stupid? And I'm freaking out? I have 1 speeding ticket I did traffic school for in college a few years ago for going literally 3mph over but like I don't even jaywalk I am so pedantic and rule following. I have a professional certification that takes a lot of effort to get and involves an ethics review for renewal where they look at crimes committed, it looks like these are both misdemeanors with fines and potential jail. I am not someone who would be good in jail at all. My parents think I should just call (who?) and try to clear it up but I've also heard don't talk with cops more than you need to if you're a suspect of something. I figure I should get an attorney but what type do I go to for this and can you estimate how much it'll cost? Is there any way shape or form this could be loitering because the condo association technically owns the yards? I've never even seen a loiterer because of the gates (incl pedestrian ones) and not really being off a busy road. It's a fairly small complex and I recognize everyone I see in my neighborhood pretty much every time I walk. People sit on their front porches with tea/coffee/dogs/books, kids play in the street, it's quiet and no pan handlers or stuff like that.

  
I have a ring cam and it started recording when he walked up as it registered that as new movement, the audio is hard to make out and it doesn't show the before of me just minding my business (it does show me going to sit out about 10 mins before this happened, but not the 10m in between as it's just motion activated). It doesn't have the entire interaction but I feel like that could still be helpful?",1,1738169076.0,legaladvice,1,1.0,False

Return to the cozy fantasy world of the #1 *New York Times* bestselling Legends & Lattes series with a new adventure featuring fan-favorite, foul-mouthed bookseller Fern.

Fern has weathered the stillness and storms of a bookseller’s life for decades, but now, in the face of crippling ennui, transplants herself to the city of Thune to hang out her shingle beside a long-absent friend’s coffee shop. What could be a better pairing? Surely a charming renovation montage will cure what ails her! 

If only things were so simple…

 It turns out that fixing your life isn’t a one-time prospect, nor as easy as a change of scenery and a lick of paint.

A drunken and desperate night sees the rattkin waking far from home in the company of a legendary warrior surviving on inertia, an imprisoned chaos-goblin with a fondness for silverware, and an absolutely thumping hangover.

As together they fend off a rogue’s gallery of ne’er-do-wells trying to claim the bounty the goblin represents, Fern may finally reconnect with the person she actually is when there isn’t a job to get in the way.",91,1738169013.0,CozyFantasy,11,1.0,False

Mecha Peach seems to have inherited a peculiar workaholic trait, constantly giving Lord Bowser coffee and paperwork, updates about current stuff, and is constantly bossing around the troopa to make sure they don't slack off instead of guarding the dragon ball, so we need to give her constant reminders, which is strangely ironic. 

We took inspiration from Geno and made one of her hands open up to reveal a flamethrower, and gave her one of those cane swords in disguise as an umbrella. We also gave her a parachute to duplicate Peach's gliding ability.

We gave her tank treads to move around, which was a mistake on our part, but she's adapted somehow and used a Cape Feather she somehow got from the powerup storage to get around.

I was finally able to get my hands on the Poetic Edda EP, and it came jus this morning.

So, first off, DT is on my daily playlist... I know these songs inside and out. I was excited, after having a really shitty week.  I sat down this morning and listened to the record. I haven't used my record player in forever. So I grab my coffee, hit play and sit back.

I was fucking blown away at how the sound quality was so different, and even the songs... I was convinced that the album had a different mix. I'm not an audiophile, but I swore I'd never heard such a sound quality improvement in my life. This mix was phenomenal. I couldn't explain why my record player sounded so amazing.

Then, as I listened to Winter, with maybe 2 minutes left... It occurred to me why... I had it playing at fucking 33RPM.

At first I sat and had a good laugh at how astonishingly stupid I was, but then I realized if any of you have the ability to listen to it at 33rpm... DO IT. It sounds amazing. All the growls and vocals hit harder. The guitar and stringed instruments slow down, the notes just stand out more. The solos that blast through slow down, you can really appreciate the complexity and nuances.

It was great, I'd love of for some of you to try this for yourselves! It absolutely made my morning!",17,1738168477.0,Deathcore,9,0.85,False

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

They're always complaining about not making enough money, despite being completely replaceable. Anyone can stock a shelf or take an order. The worst thing is that they aren't even good at what little they do. If you are at a café, the waitress never comes to refill your coffee and see if you want something else. At a restaurant they always forget anything that is the slightest bit different. If you ask for a different bread, they forget. If you ask for desert, they forget. 

In retail stores they never know anything about anything being sold at the store, and they can never solve anything. For example they can run out of a thing several weeks in a row, and not do anything to correct it. All they can do is to put things already in stock up on the shelves.

Flair Pro 2 Black| Bought on here from a user about a month ago probably only put a few shots and couldn't get used to the workflow, and then I found a Cafelat for a good price and liked that more. | $230 shipped
1ZPresso K-Plus (scuffed) | Bought like 3ish years ago when I started my coffee journey. In rough condition, only because I traveled a lot with it and when I was getting used to it I dropped the magnetic catch cup a few times, dropped the handle, and when trying to clean the burrs out I couldn't unscrew either side so had to use vice grips to open it, so both the ring and bottom burr container show signs of wear (the bottom burr is really hard to open to clean...) This grinder still works fine, still grinds like it was new, but I don't use it much anymore and it's time for someone else looking to get into coffee to buy it. Pretty good grinder for either filter or espresso. | $115 shipped",5,1738168111.0,coffeeswap,1,1.0,False

She came 40 minutes late but she did keep in touch when she could, she said that she has to leave soon, we had a coffee, 20 minute chat and then she left (she said she will have to leave to pick up siblings from school/work). We talked and it felt really good, she was as confident as I expected but easy to chat with, we had a laugh a lot but I made 1 mistake as laughed at something she didn't think I should have (so feel like a bit of an idiot now). We did however chat more and she asked me questions too, she did chec her phone a lot apparently chatting with her mum by text which was probably right. 

Later said sorry that she will have to leave soon but ""if we meet again then, it will be here"" she said. We chatted a bit more and she got a message, then left very soon after that saying ""sorry"" and apologising more as she went.

(I think I did my very best to keep up with her, had an interesting chat about family, work and ussuall stuff. Although I'm not really bad looking or anything, I still feel that maybe she's way out of my league, and worry what if she won't want to see me again)

during all 3 of my donations, i've had the citrate reaction: tingling mouth and lips, weird taste, some jitters. i didn't realize it wasn't normal so i never said anything. during yesterday's donation, it was more intense but still not enough that i felt i needed to mention it because i just figured it was part of it.

i felt fine after my donation, drank coffee on my drive home,  ate (oatmeal with fruit and honey) and went to work. drank water, but maybe not as much water as i should have. start to feel a bit off while working. take a break, eat a snack, drink more water. start looking into the tingling during donation and realize it's not normal. i'm about 4 hour past donation time at this point. my body temp is all over the place, feet are sweaty but cold, hands are really cold. i lay down for a bit. think maybe i need some tums/calcium. i have to drive to the pharmacy to get some and when i get inside, i have this sudden rush where i'm convinced im going to pass out, heart racing, sweaty palms and feet, feel like i'm going to pee myself, spotty vision, can't process info. grab some tums and shove like 3 in my mouth and try to focus on chewing them. get some pedialyte and a coke thinking maybe it's dehydration or low blood sugar. maybe a vasovagal response? call my husband while i drive home in case i pass out. it was terrifying. feel off all night but chug through pedialyte and take more tums and eat a quesadilla.

my arm hurts through the night. i ice the injection site. i have a kind of radiating burning sensation up my arm and into my chest and shoulder. the cuff was very tight and did feel kind of high during my donation so i'm wondering if they somehow pinched a nerve with that or with the needle? it still hurts/burns/radiates into my chest and down my arm today. i occasionally have these little twitches around my shoulder blade on that side. am still having some minor tingling in hands and feet. sweaty, cold hands and feet. generally feel a bit off. occasionally my heart feels like it's racing. have a slight dull headache that kind of comes and goes.

i've continued hydrating and got some calcium supplements to take. trying to up my calcium food intake and generally take it very easy and rest in bed, but I actually feel better when I’m up and moving around (maybe less anxiety response since I’m distracted?) 

i'm supposed to donate tomorrow. is it possible i'm having symptoms of hypocalcemia? since i've had the reaction all 3 donations but never did anything about it to replenish calcium? do i have a pinched nerve? both? something way more serious?

if you made it this far, thanks for reading & for your insights!",1,1738167748.0,plassing,0,1.0,False

I changed the post flair on the original post (it was Wedding Drama Llama) I added stuff not about the wedding so that's why.

UPDATE!

We got married in December. We had hymns. Everyone sang the one they knew, but no one knew the second one. I had a suspicion when I chose it that no one would sing it, but I wanted it anyway. I'm still glad I had it played because it means so much to me. His parents made me worry about the hymns the entire time, but I'm fine with how it turned out. I had made peace with the fact that, when I decided to have hymns, no one might sing at all, and I was okay with that. I was just worried the entire time about an ""I told you so"" from his parents. It wasn’t fun. People need to learn to mind their own business.

I don't remember what started it, but before we got married, we had another argument—probably about his parents, which are the only thing we argue about. Maybe I shouldn't bring up old stuff; maybe that does indeed make me the asshole. All I remember is that we started talking about the situation with the engagement ring again. What drove me crazy was that he said something along the lines of not wanting to call me or his mother a liar because he didn't want to choose between two people who both loved him. I was so upset that he was fence-sitting and didn’t believe me, even after all that time. Maybe that makes me the asshole again because I want him to take my side. I really just want him to believe me when I’m speaking the truth. To me, it’s about trust. We worked it out, but that was a big issue for me.

Whenever his parents have caused a problem, my now-husband gets upset when I bring up all the past things they’ve done because he doesn’t see a pattern. The only reason I bring it up is that I want him to put his foot down once and for all and notice the pattern. He hasn’t yet.

The morning after the wedding, he brought up another criticism his mother had of me. She didn’t like what I said when they asked how my dad was doing. It wasn’t disrespectful; it was just the truth about my dad. Maybe it’s a cultural thing, but it’s not derogatory in my family—it’s just a description and an accurate one at that. I would never talk crap about my dad. I love him; he’s one of my favorite people. My husband said that if I say it again, his mother said she is going to confront or correct me about it. That tells me that, when they ask how my dad is doing, they genuinely don’t care—they’re just saying the things they feel obligated to in normal conversation.

It’s rules for thee and not for me, though. From the first day I met them, they’ve non-stop trashed and talked badly about their daughter, even when I didn’t ask about her. They would just go on tirades about her, airing all her business, and they were angry as they spoke. Hate-filled is the vibe I got. They even did this in front of their grandson (their daughter’s son), who they have custody of. He is little, but that shouldn’t matter.

I guess next time they ask about my dad, I can either just say what they obviously want me to say—“He’s fine” (which isn’t true, and I’m worried)—or say what they don’t like and let her go off. Then, I’ll tell her how I feel about them talking about their own child.

Anyway, I was upset about my husband bringing up his mother’s criticism the morning after the wedding. We couldn’t even be married for a full 24 hours without me hearing about how his mom had yet another problem with me. He did apologize, but it just shows that I can’t say the right things to satisfy them. And he wonders why I’m so nervous and uncomfortable around them.

I also didn’t appreciate this conversation about my dad because, right after the ceremony, my dad had to leave since his pants ripped. I didn’t get any staged photos with him or time with him at the reception, and that was devastating.

Months before the wedding my dad had a serious medical issue and almost died, so I traveled to my hometown to see him. After only a few days, he was barely out of the hospital at that time (maybe still in). His parents texted me and asked me when I would be coming back. I was not happy with this and texted my SO to ask him why his parents would be asking me this. He was not happy when I told him this. He said that he had just been messaging them before they messaged me. They had ask him when I would be back and he told them “I don’t know and I am not going to ask her so that she doesn’t feel pressured.” He did say after he told them they shouldn’t have messaged me that. I did feel pressured by them. I guess that's what they wanted because no one can be that stupid.

Oddly enough, his grandma has been friendlier and more welcoming to me than her own daughter. His grandmother calls me on the phone every once in a while to talk, and we usually talk a lot. His mother never does. He has basically told me that it’s up to me to extend the olive branch and call his mother.

1. I think, typically, the parents or in-laws should do that.
2. Really? After everything, I’m supposed to be the one to do it? Seriously?

His parents often won’t come out and say what they want, whether it’s good or bad. Instead, they just text something ominous, like, “We need to have a talk…” Then, when asked multiple times what it’s about, they refuse to say. I don’t like that.

Once, after waiting all day to find out what they wanted to talk about, I got emotional. His mother was rude and exclaimed, “OH MY GOD,” rolling her eyes at me. I just don’t see the need to play games. Just say it. If it’s not something super heavy (and maybe even if it is), just spit it out. I don’t want to sit around all day wondering if they have a problem with something.

His dad even did this just to have lunch one day. It’s weird. I told my husband to put his foot down about this stuff, but he just shrugged me off, saying, “That’s just how they are.”

Their dog has bitten me more than once and has lunged at me several times. Whenever I played with my now-nephew at their house, that dog would follow him around constantly.

The first time the dog bit me, I was holding my nephew, playing with him in the middle of the living room. They were all in the room as well. It bit me on the leg, and I felt pain and let out a scream, not knowing at first exactly what happened. The dog has dirty teeth and doesn’t have its shots. It has bitten several people, including kids. Whenever I act nervous around that dog, his mother looks at me like I’m crazy and tells me the dog won’t bite me. She acts like I’m being ridiculous. But it has bitten me—and others—before. Why wouldn’t it bite me now?

Months ago, when we didn’t have a dining table or coffee table, I would continually tell him to invite his parents over so I could try to have a good relationship with them. He continually made the excuse that we didn’t have a dining room table. We have not once eaten at a table when we visit his parents' house, so this seemed illogical to me. Then he also used the excuse that his parents had told him they didn’t feel welcome here. They did have a problem a few months after we moved in, saying they never see him/us, despite the fact I have told him to invite them over several times. My husband has to work a lot; of course, you aren’t seeing him that much anymore—he doesn’t live with you. I wasn’t too happy about them guilt-tripping him about this since, since I moved in with him, I rarely get to see my parents. My parents aren’t guilt-tripping me about not seeing them. My parents would come up sometimes when they could, and guess what? They were fine eating without a coffee table or dining table. They made it work. I guess it’s good enough for my parents but not his.

I was also a little upset one time when his parents came over. Instead of ordering something or me making something, the three of them went out to lunch. At the time, I could not physically leave the house. That one I probably shouldn’t have a problem with, but they make a big deal about not seeing me often either. So why not sacrifice and sit on the couch and eat like you do already at home to spend time with me?

On a positive note, I suppose they wanted to help get and pay for some wedding stuff. It was last minute, and again, I wasn’t involved in the conversation because after the hymn blow-up, they stopped group messaging me about our wedding. So once again, after he came back from his parent's house, he said they wanted to buy the tableware and drinks. I already had everything picked out and ready to order. I was torn between letting them handle it or handling it myself and making sure it was what I wanted and needed, especially when they wouldn’t communicate with me, and it had to all go through their son. I also felt guilty about not letting them do it so I could save us money.

Turns out, they weren’t willing to do everything. Something along the lines of, they will get plates and stuff, but we have to get utensils. That’s just not practical in my opinion because I just thought it would be easier to do it all together and have everything in the same location. Also, there would be no room for error if either they or I got everything. There wouldn’t be a mistake of one of us assuming the other got something that we didn’t. Also, they were not willing to get the drinks that I wanted to have at the wedding. My husband said this was because they wouldn’t be able to get the right thing. All I wanted was tea and lemonade for the kids and for my family. I had also said multiple times that I would rather not have alcohol because a few of my relatives who planned to attend are alcoholics, and I was worried for them and others. They made a big stink about having alcohol, so we did have it. It turned out fine because none of those people showed up in the end.

Well, anyway, I told my husband that I would rather get the tableware if they were not going to get all of it. He wanted us to let them help if that's what they wanted. I let him handle it, and they got all the tableware. They ended up forgetting some of it at home, though, so I’m assuming one of my cousins who was helping to set up (love them) had to get them? I’m not sure. That was exactly why I told my husband I wanted to handle it so that I got the things we wanted and needed and that I made sure it was where it needed to be.

Also, a week before the wedding, his mother was making a big deal about ice. She was insisting that I tell the reception venue to provide me with ice and that I need to pay whatever fee they ask. When I first booked my reception venue, they explained that they wouldn’t provide anything extra that was not already listed and included. All we were getting was the venue, tables, tablecloths, chairs, and chafing dishes—the basics. Which was all fine with me. They set everything up for you, give you a door code, and leave you be. Works for me! I was not going to bother them with this or ask them for something extra when they made their policy clear in conversation and in the contract. I had made it clear to her they did not and would not provide it but she continually insisted that I pay them to do it.

I was already swamped with last-minute wedding things, and I did not need to beg the venue to give me ice. I had also told his mother before she told me to get ice from the venue that the reception venue is in kind of a strip mall, and at the opposite end of that tiny strip mall, there was a convenience store that would be open and had ice. I said this more than once and explained whoever in my family I could ask to kindly help out and get ice would have no problem walking less than 30 seconds over to the convenience store in the same strip mall/parking lot. Nope! She insisted I badger my venue to give me ice. Even if I had and the venue was willing, I’m sure the fee would be more than I’d be willing to pay for ice, especially when it can be obtained in 2 minutes very easily.

During this conversation, I also mentioned that I probably wasn’t going to have centerpieces and that doesn’t bother me. (If I wanted to have centerpieces, they would be blue since my wedding theme was blue floral, and I would have wanted faux flowers.) A few days before the wedding, my maid of honor and I happened to be at a craft store picking up some other wedding things, and she did ask me if I was sure about not having centerpieces, we could pick up some things at that store and make them. I said I was fine without them—the wedding venue is elaborate, and we can make the reception simple. I guess his mom was trying to be sweet because she got some wedding reception centerpieces for us. They were red roses, not fake, and some boutonnieres, etc., for the ones who didn’t have them. Maybe I’m naïve because I really don’t think this was malicious, but my friends have pointed out things that make them think she was being a jerk. Their points are that she knew my theme was blue floral, and she got red anyway, especially when she had not liked the idea of me getting blue flowers for bouquets in the first place. She knew that I was getting fake flowers for bouquets and boutonnieres, and she didn’t like that either. So she got real flowers that were red to spite me. I honestly feel bad that she spent her money on real flowers that I didn’t need, and they trashed them shortly after. Either way, if she had good intentions or not, at least the centerpieces didn’t clash too much since I had a red velvet semi-naked cake, a red anime-themed cookie cake as a surprise for my husband, and an anime red-themed guest book. She didn’t know any of that though.

His mother does his taxes every year because she used to be an accountant, according to them. (She worked under an accountant; she was never an accountant.) Well, he asked me the other day if I want to file jointly or separately. I think the best benefit would be to file jointly, but my income is none of his mommy’s business. So if he insists she does his, I will be doing my own. Also, and I know a lot of people will disagree with me here, but I think finances are easier to manage from the same account. I told my husband that I’m too prideful and I have some debt to pay down from wedding expenses; I don’t want to share an account until I do that, but I want to share an account. He would be fine with sharing an account now, though. Maybe I should insist that we at least get a shared account now because I know for a fact his mommy still has access to his, so that’s too much in our business for me. It weirded me out when we started dating. Whether we do or do not share accounts now, or if we ever do, I just don’t like his mommy being able to see his expenses/our expenses if you want to call it that. I probably should just tell him to get his own account because I think the only way she has access to it is if she's also an account owner. (Yes I know that he could just give her the login but I think it's more than that). Yeah, mom has access to his bank but his wife doesn’t that's weird. I'm a little to harsh on this one (because I'm livid about everything else), but he is fine with sharing a bank account at any time.

He has told me before that when he was a kid, his goal with everything he did was to make them happy. He also said that his sister would get chance after chance, be coddled, and get whatever she wanted, and he wouldn't get the same treatment. He says this in a matter-of-fact way: it is what it is. Is he suppressing his feelings, or does he really just think nothing of this? I’m suspicious that they are involved in his life so much and in our business because they can’t do the same with their daughter, who is an ex-drug addict and dealer. Maybe I’m wrong.

There’s a lot more significant and insignificant things that I could say about what goes on, but I feel like if I say more specific/identifying things, someone would be able to pinpoint who wrote it, and I do not need it getting back to his parents. Maybe I’ll get mad one day and air all my dirty laundry out for the entertainment of strangers on the internet.

At this point, and this is me being an asshole, but you know when someone has pissed you off and screwed you over so many times that even the slightest misstep on their part makes you angry? That’s where I’m at now. Trying not to be. I’m really trying to give people the benefit of the doubt, but after all this, I really don’t want to, and I don’t trust them.

They make me feel ashamed, embarrassed, anxious, self-conscious, and not good enough. They stress me out and make me mad. I'm worried about this stuff happening when we have kids. I'm different than them, our family will be different. They need to stop trying to dictate and let us be because nothing we do causes problems for us.

Thank you so much Charlotte (and Mike) you have given us all so many hours of laughs and joy!

Thanks, community!
