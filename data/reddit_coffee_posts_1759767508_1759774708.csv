if not interested why still not unmatching? was that sarcasm? or just needs some ego boost, bragging her number of matches??

My partner and I are about to make the move to Vancouver from pretty far away. We're both mentally ill queer people, so there are a few businesses/necessities we'd love local recommendations on. 

Any therapists and psychiatrists you'd recommend in the area? As far as meds go, we tend to prefer working with NPs and PAs, but we're not afraid to take an MD recommendation. As far as therapists go, we're just looking for some chill people who are trauma informed and LGBT+ friendly. 

We've also got a big family of dogs and cats, so local veterinary recommendations would be greatly appreciated. 

Obviously, we're curious about the best spots in town for coffee, groceries, etc. But, we also have a few more specific curiosities. Where can dudes like us buy collectible toys, vintage video games, VHSes, and all forms of analogue media? We're also in need of witchy/spooky supplies. Any salons/stylists you're a fan of? We love cooking Asian food, so we'd love to know the best place to get authentic groceries.

Possibly, most importantly, who has the best weed in town? We're not about that shitty grass life. 

And finally, anything you wish you knew about Vancouver beforehand? We're moving from warmer climates, but we've lived in colder areas before. However, we've never visited Vancouver, and we'd love any tips you can't find from the vloggers on Youtube. 

Thanks in advance for your time and responses! :)",1,1759774505.0,vancouverwa,0,1.0,False

Hello reader, I am a male in my early 20s sharing my thoughts about being friends with women. If you do make it through my written out thoughts I would love any feedback. I journaled about my experience and need someone to hear me out.

I have had a couple of friendships with women in my life, however, I tend to have more guy friends. I am friends with one woman currently. The story starts about two years ago. She started talking to me first and initiated the friendship while in class at university which was amazing since it is rare for somebody to initiate friendship in my experience. For contacts, I am straight and she is gay, which may be important for what I discussed later. Over the past two years, me and her have grown very close to each other. She has had past trauma with men, however, she says that she trust me very much. It has been nice to hear that I have become so close and reliable with someone who has issues trusting. It makes me feel good almost if I’m helping her out. I will give you some specifics into our friendship as well. Me and her would hang out very frequently throughout the past year. We really enjoy watching movies together and going out in groups. We have gotten into a routine after hanging out which I will lay in her bed cuddling until she falls asleep. She has told me that she is never comfortable falling asleep around any other man besides me. I really enjoy cuddling with her as it is a huge stress relief for me and she enjoys my presence. Our relationship has never gone sexual. I also tend to do many acts of service for her which she says there is no way she could ever repay me for what I do. I have taken her out to get dinner multiple times, help clean, do dishes, bring her coffee, scratch her back, and any other miscellaneous service I can provide. I do this in a way to repay her for inviting me out since most all my friends arnt in my hometown and she has a big group. I also bring gifts to her, for example, a sweatshirt, rocks, earrings. It may sound like I do a lot, which I probably do, however I remind you that I enjoy doing this for her since she has been a good friend. This is the backstory of our friendship so now I transition into why it is hard being friends.

She is so on and off. This past summer, she made no time to make plans with me at all. When fall came around, we both made plans to hang out weekly on a weekday which we did all last year. On this day, I came over to her house, helped set up a bed frame, ordered dinner for us to eat, then after eating she went out with friends to a bar. Previously she told her friends that she wouldn’t go to this bar since we had plans, and I made it clear I didn’t want to go out that night. I felt hurt that she would leave me after I bought her food and helped set up her room to spend time with other people. But life moved on and we still would text frequently. More recently, her mood shifted greatly. Everything was going normal until I left her text message on seen for about a day. Which shouldn’t be a big deal because I had no response then we just didn’t text the rest of the day. Since then, she has seemed distant. She barely texts and leaves me on read, hasn’t made any attempts to make plans, and blew me off by not talking to me at a sporting event. I have been so frustrated because I treat her to a standard I would treat any best friend and I feel I do not get the same energy back. To me she can put in effort to the friendship and then just pull out at random times. She also is the type of person to be confrontational when upset with someone. She typically doesn’t play games. I just need consistency with my friendships. She built the friendship on frequent texting and communication which I have become accustomed to. Then she does 180s on me and it makes me over think everything. I need an outside perspective on this. I don’t understand how I can be so important in her life then just seem to not exist. She means a lot to me and I wish it could just be easier. Please leave feedback or thoughts. I send appreciation to anyone who read through this all.

Here’s our rough plan:

* **Thursday:** Leave Boston in the morning, stop in Philly for lunch/afternoon exploring, then continue to stay overnight with a family friend outside DC.
* **Friday:** Leave DC in the morning and head toward Nashville. We just need to be at our Airbnb by around 5–6 PM for a cocktail party that night.
* **Saturday:** Wedding day and exploring Nashville (so no driving).
* **Sunday:** Head back toward DC, but open to detouring - Asheville or the Smoky Mountains are on our radar if it makes sense time-wise.
* **Monday:** Finish the trip back to Boston in no rush really.

We’d love any suggestions for:

* Scenic or less stressful routes (especially between DC and Nashville)
* Great food or coffee stops that aren’t too far off the highway
* Quick roadside attractions or short hikes worth the stop
* Any underrated small towns to check out (bonus points for good music or barbecue vibes)

We’re trying to strike a balance between efficient and memorable — not just gas stations and interstates the whole way.

Background: 52 in menopause and was dealing with issues from menopause that resulted in D&C as my uterine lining was thicker than 11mm, polyps removed , fibroids left because too much going on. Biopsy of everything was negative thankfully but was told getting IUD especially mirena would help not continue to have thick uterine lining polyps return and increase of cancer risk due to those reasons. I’d most likely have to have same things done with D&C , polyps removed and biopsies done .

Fast forward and now it’s been 2 months and I’ve waited to see if things “calm down” regarding bladder pain, uti symptoms but no uit and the frequency of going to bathroom.
Tried D- mannose as suggested but only made the pain so SO much worse. Stoped coffee. Dr suggested trying to train my bladder to only go bathroom at certain times - I work in healthcare that absolutely Didn’t work.

If I remove IUD there’s no guarantee that things will magically resolve itself.  So do I keep it and atleast if nothing else know my cancer risk is less just continue to deal with the pain and flare ups.

This apparently can happen as all the poking around can inflame bladder and now you just have to deal.

Some pointers and heads-up:,"Reading a single week of the campus crime log will rip the adhesive bandage off the mirage that UCSD is just a bunch of studious STEM nerds and will reveal the seething David Lynchian Blue Velvet/Twin Peaks reality of crime, perversion, and insanity that festers underneath the surface.  The chance is not 0% that you will appear in the crime log before you leave this cauldron of iniquity once and for all years into the future.

The plaza by the trolley station is for visitors to get boutique Bird Rock coffee, play the steel marimba, and start their expedition to steal your scooter.

Your residence hall will suck. When you switch later, the new one will suck even worse. As you cycle through every single residence hall and somehow end up in your original one, each one will suck worse than the previous one like an endless M.C. Escher recursive Möbius strip of suckiness. There is no escape. Better to camp in the canyon with the raccoons.

The tall, blinking tower in the middle of Ridge Walk is an art installation that spells out ""Cole$law don't $urf"" in Morse code.

If you're concerned about the latest flu or COVID surge, join the Main gym fencing club – masks, gloves, and if anyone comes within six feet of you, you stab them. Legally.

The sign across from the trolley station since 2022 that says that that Mexican restaurant is ""Coming Soon"" was written by a geologist.

If it's in Price Center and everyone likes it, it will be shut down.

If you don't have time for any of the gyms on campus, running the gantlet down Library Walk and avoiding eye contact with the cultists is great cardio.  They will try to lure you in with free yogurt and pizza.  Think of the witch in Hansel and Gretel and keep going.

Mother raccoons with their kits do not want you to pet their babies.  They will rip you to shreds if they think you're a threat.  It doesn't matter if you kitchy-coo them in that little girl babydoll Disney princess voice that works on Daddy and fraternity boys.

Campus police are there when you don't want them and they're not when you do. The second most dangerous place on campus is between them and Burger King. The most dangerous place is near Coleslaw's car after cocktail hour.

Other hazardous locations on campus include construction sites, bike paths, and the back of any computer lab.  Keep your eyes and ears open for the first two; bring a gas mask for the last one.

Skid Row Santa thinks it's cute how Starbucks gives names to their free items at the pick-up counter.  Today he had a vanilla latte named Rajiv and a double-smoked bacon sandwich named Bob.

Sun God Festival is a music event in the spring for you to get ejected for being criminally drunk and to end up with an arrest record and badly sunburned. Unless Machiavelli von Coleslaw cancels it. Your fees will not be reduced in either case.

Inside every COGS lecturer is a lion, an ass, an eagle, a bear, and a pig; and you never know which one is going to show up.

The gliderport is an Edenic location on the cliffs above the beach where you can bask in the ocean sunset as paragliders float on the breeze and the gliderport pervert masturbates in his van.  It's not clear if his van is only a masturbation van or if it's also a murder van.

If you get accosted by a Library Walk cultist, you can say ""I'm allergic to nuts"" and keep walking.

York Hall is a retro mid-century classroom/office complex in Revelle that is favored by the York Hall Naked/Underwear Guy™.  He shows up in the campus crime log about once each month because he's either naked or he's wearing only underwear, and then he puts his clothes back on and disappears.  Campus police have never arrived in time to catch him because it's too far from Burger King.

The newest residential halls are tall towers so you can experience California's earthquakes as Universal Studios roller coaster rides without the Universal prices.

It won't matter who your commencement keynote speaker will be. Weapons of mass death from Miramar air station will fly by repeatedly and drown that person out (they even did that to the Dalai freaking Lama a few years ago, I am not making that up).

Every residence hall has that one person who thinks the microwave is broken because they put in a potato and pushed the pizza button and when the dinger dinged it was still a potato.  That person will be your roommate.  Brain cells will get sucked out of your head through your ear holes every time you hear them speak.  They are likely from Texas or Florida.

Hydration stations are for obtaining fluids, not for depositing them.

If your political beliefs differ from those of the person next to you, you're in favor of genocide. It doesn't matter which side you're on.

The brick walkway with engraved words by the trolley station will snag the soles of your shoes two or three times each time you walk down it, causing your shoes to fall apart gradually over the span of several months.  Because this happens in tiny increments, you won't make the connection and you'll conclude they're poorly-made shoes and you'll never get that brand again.  Thank you for participating in our immersive performance art installation about the perils of consumerism.

Elevators are for making new friends when you get stuck for hours. Unless you're stuck with a stingray, which will try to kill you.

Those large semi-circular booths in the dining halls are for two sticky, squirty people to monopolize for lap dancing.

If you lose anything on campus, it will be turned in to Lost and Found, where it will be lost.

Data Science majors will not graduate until they've appeared before a final review board and correctly said ""Halıcıoğlu"" three times in quick succession.

If you forget to log off of your university desktop computer, a non-affiliate will use their bat echolocation to find it within 30 seconds and they will clog your search history with raccoon porn. Your account will then be flagged by IT and you will be brought up before the Standards and Conduct Committee. Your transcripts will be red-flagged forever, you'll never get into MIT, you'll never get hired by Salk, and you'll never get a Nobel. Log off your computer every time.

You will spend fifty to one hundred hours each year for the rest of your life deleting donation solicitations from the alumni fund. Every attempt to unsubscribe will double the number of messages, like the Hydra of legend. You are in the funnel, you will be assimilated, and you cannot kill the beast.

S asked me on 8/30/25 about staying at my house because she had no place to live starting 9/1/25. S and I are not romantically involved in any way, and that has nothing to do with this story (just wanted to mention that beforw we get started). I don't like living with other people, but I regretfully offered her a place to stay at my house since it seemed to be an emergency. S said she'd only be staying a week or two, a month at max, and would be looking for a permanent housing situation while here. We agreed on a small exchange of money. My house wasn't really set up for someone else, so I was curious what she would do when she got a small tour. She agreed to move in anyway.

S moved in on 9/1/25 and took up residency in my art room. Soon after I mentioned that this situation gives me anxiety and I wanted to make it clear that I was doing this because of the emergency she was in. She said she would try to be amenable to me. I asked if she had any leads on where she would be going in a week or two, and she said she had some ideas. I was hoping she'd get it straightened out soon. However, she didn't bring this up to me again, so I asked after another week just to see how things were looking for the future (would she be staying the whole month or what). I got another, ""I'm looking"" response. We have a mutual friend who actually really needs a roommate, so I mentioned the situation to both of them. They got in contact with one another. However, S decided she didn't want to move in with him because he doesn't live in the same neighborhoods she is looking at in the city we live in. I was a little confused about what was going on but wanted to remain hopeful.

So fast-forward a bit. S did pay me, and I ended up asking for about 15% more since now this was a month situation that would affect the utilities more. S seemed fine with that. I started to get concerned about what was going on though. At some point we had talked about her last housing situation, and I'm not sure that I understand it all. Basically, S was living with a friend I don't know. She lived with him for two years or something, and then his parents, who own the house, told her that they decided to rent it to other people. It sounded like the son was staying in the house, and just she had to leave. I'm not 100% sure though. So they gave S 90 days, and she shrugged when asked about looking for a new place in that time frame. She said she just didn't look. So this whole end-of-the-line situation was mostly from a lack of her own initiative. This had me a little frustrated that it fell on me to resolve it. S doesn't work and receives money from her parents. I don't know how much, but she goes to a coffee shop everyday, has a monthly bus pass, and buys a lot of organic or higher-end food. All I'm saying is that she doesn't seem particularly broke, but I don't really know. I'm certainly not seeing the whole picture, so I can't really say.

Regardless, when I started to press S about the end of her stay here around 9/27/25, she told me two days in a row that she saw a rental sign on a house and forgot to call the number, still needed to email someone about a place, or that there was a nice place and the ""for rent"" sign was taken down. She only provides this information when I ask her, not on her own accord. I told her that I didn't want to do this for another two weeks (meaning into the 2nd week of October).

Soon after I had to call my home insurance about a leak in the ceiling in a different room. S had left her stuff all over my art room, which had made it very hard to walk in, so I told her she needed to get it cleaned up. I wanted the insurance people to be able to inspect that room along with a few others to make sure about what was going on with the leak. She did clean some stuff up (it's still pretty packed in there) and excitedly told me. I mentioned the moving thing again to her in this moment, as I was hoping that the insurance situation would prompt her to consider figuring out her housing situation. S got a bit deflated. We talked about her figuring something out to leave in a few days. She said she was communicating with friends about it. That was several days ago, though, and now she has become avoidant of me instead of being extremely talkative (her previous demeanor).

So what should I do? We're almost a week into October when we had said ""a month max"" before. This wouldn't be particularly problematic, but S doesn't communicate about what's going on. I have no idea about her timeframe or anything. I would even help her look, and I did offer to help her pack and unpack at a new place when she found one if I got a ride there and back (neither of us have a car or drive). She declined. Anyway, the poor communication, the story about her last place, and what seems to be a lack of initiative(?) makes me wonder if she intends to push staying here until I force her to leave through legal means or something. I don't intend to call the police unless something actually violent happens, and I would personally prefer to settle this without the legal system. I feel like I'm being taken advantage of and not respected though. I really want S out of my house.

Power went out the other day and I still haven’t found the time to reset it. Decades ago some engineer at GE (or whatever) got the bright idea to put seven segment displays on an oven so you can feel like you’re setting the temperature of your casserole more precisely. Okay fine why not. But then some coked up marketing guy realized that, on the Sears showroom floor, a blank rectangle on the stove makes it look empty, impotent - is it even plugged in? Somehow a blank display makes a digital device look more off than analog-electric off. So he goes back to the engineer and says “hey man, can’t you put something on there when it’s not being used?” “Okay what if it said: ‘`0FF`’ so people know that it’s ‘OFF’ but still has the potential to be ‘ON’ if the owner so wills?” “Makes sense, but there’s something dissonant about it - it makes me anxious” (silence for a minute) “hey what about a clock?”

“Well it’s possible, but it’d be a pretty tedious user experience to set it with just one button and if you press one too many times you have to wrap around the long way around again and there’s no battery on the circuit board so every time the power flatlines or hiccups, the user would have to set it again and don’t most people already have clocks? Often in the kitchen? One that runs on batteries? Maybe has the top twelve most notable songbirds of North America illustrated around it?”

1nzqjl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1nzqjl1/why_is_it_so_hard_to_meet_locals_when_traveling/,Why is it so hard to meet locals when traveling?,"I’ve been traveling across LATAM for a while and even as a Peruvian I’ve always found it hard to connect with locals. Meeting other travelers is much easier (on apps, hostels) as they’re usually open to making new friends. For non-Spanish speakers I imagine it gets even harder.

But the experience is never the same as getting to know a place through locals.

In countries like Peru, which aren’t very culturally diverse, the language barrier makes it tougher and tends to keep away long-term travelers. Tbh that sucks… because there’s SO MUCH to experience that you only discover by blending into the culture and meeting people on the inside.

I’ve seen a lot of posts saying Lima isn’t a great travel destination - I disagree. If you’re only looking to meet foreigners, maybe yes, since we don’t have a huge remote worker scene. But if you’re open to the local side, Lima is actually a really nice city. There’s amazing food, very active nightlife, tons of hangout spots (coffee shops, coworking spaces, parks), and plenty of activities nearby - weekend towns, surfing, renting a beach or country house, yacht trips. The problem is most of these are unknown to foreigners.

There’s no real space (at least that I know of) to connect travelers with locals so I decided to start a [group chat](https://join.tribechat.com/Yzy4OZOZ6-) for anyone coming to Peru or planning a trip. I’ll be here until December (I am a nomad working in tech) and I’m happy to share tips, recommendations, and show you around Lima! Best spots, where to go, and what to avoid. I’ll also be adding friends and family who can share authentic insights into the culture and daily life.

If people find this useful I’ll create more chats for other countries I’ve lived in (Colombia, Argentina, Mexico) and connect travelers with locals there too!! Hope you give it a chance to see these countries through our eyes ;).",1,1759774014.0,digitalnomad,0,0.67,False

1nzqhz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedByChery/comments/1nzqhz9/reveal_the_truth_about_tumbler_water_bottle/,Reveal the Truth About Tumbler Water Bottle Cleaning Tablets,"Testing out the Tumbler Water Bottle Cleaning Tablets—yes, the name’s a bit mouthy—I found myself genuinely intrigued by their claims of all-natural ingredients and compatibility with just about every kind of container I own. At first glance, the neat packaging looked promising, and I liked that the tablets came individually wrapped. I live in a house where half-empty cups and smelly water bottles seem to multiply mysteriously, so anything that makes cleaning them easier instantly grabs my attention. 

**Design and Packaging**  
These cleaning tablets are packed in a compact box that fits snugly on my kitchen counter without hogging space. Each tablet is individually wrapped, which I appreciate since it prevents moisture from ruining the whole batch. Plus, the packaging includes detailed instructions, so there’s no guessing. I started with a rather stained stainless steel tumbler that’s had its fair share of brutal coffee remnants. Dropped the tablet in and let the cleaning action unfold like a mini science experiment—those fizzy bubbles are oddly satisfying to watch.

**Ease of Use**  
Oh, this one’s a win. Using these couldn’t be simpler. I just filled the tumbler with warm water, tossed in the tablet, and waited a few minutes. Swirling the liquid around was oddly calming, like I was watching some tiny cleaning ninjas silently scrub my cup. No intense scrubbing, no harsh chemical smells—just sparkling-clean results, even in those tricky spots like the corners and lid threads. It’s even safe on plastics and glass, a real plus when I need to clean the kids' bottles without worrying about harmful residues.

**Good Points**  
- All-natural ingredients make it safe for family use.  
- Works on multiple container types—stainless steel, plastic, ceramic, even glass.  
- No need for elbow grease; the fizziness does the trick.  
- Individually wrapped tablets keep things neat and fresh.

[Check Tumbler Water Bottle Cleaning Tablets price on Amazon.](https://compare.senaar.com/p/b0dh9xb6n4/)

**Performance**  
The cleaning performance is solid. After testing it on an embarrassingly gunky travel mug, the tablets left it shiny and odor-free. They tackled coffee stains, a faint tea residue, and even that odd ""bottle closed for too long"" smell without breaking a sweat. The fizzy action ensures better coverage, reaching into nooks and crannies that a sponge could never touch. However, the real test was on a glass water bottle with a particularly stubborn orange juice stain, and it came out pristine. The dissolving and rinsing process took barely five minutes for most items, and there was no weird aftertaste left behind.

**Downsides**  
- Not the most economical option if you’re using them daily for larger households.  
- Tablets can’t substitute for a good scrub on heavily caked grime.  
- Hard-to-reuse once a tablet is made into the solution, meaning a single-use application is the rule.

**Target User**  
For anyone juggling a busy life with a love for reusable beverage containers, these tablets are a lifesaver. They’re perfect for cleaning on the go or when you’re just too drained to battle stubborn stains by hand. Parents will find these especially useful for those hard-to-reach spots in sippy cups, while gym-goers can rely on them to freshen up sweaty, smelly bottles. Even coffee addicts (raising my hand) will find them perfect for keeping travel mugs habit-ready.

**Competing Products**  
Compared to its rivals like the Bottle Bright Cleaning Tablets, this product holds its ground quite well. The all-natural formula gives it an edge over harsher chemical-based tablets, and it’s more versatile with its compatibility across materials. However, Bottle Bright offers a slightly larger pack size, which might make it more attractive if you’re on a tighter budget. Another competitor, CleanHike Cleaning Tablets, matches up in terms of cleaning power but lacks the individually wrapped packaging, which, for me, is a game-changer in maintaining long-term freshness.

**Quality for Price**  
While these tablets may not be the cheapest cleaning solution out there, they still strike a reasonable balance between quality and convenience. Their portability and ease of use save time and effort, which makes them feel worth it if you’re always in need of clean bottles but short on patience. Prices fluctuate, and though I’d love to see them offered in bulk sizes for families, the results they deliver are hard to argue with. Spotless, odor-free containers every single time? Not bad at all.

1nzqdwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyShine/comments/1nzqdwa/discover_if_benefit_bad_gal_bang_mascara_really/,Discover if Benefit Bad Gal Bang Mascara Really Boosts Volume,"**Testing a Gravity-Defying Mascara that Packs a Punch**

I gave the Benefit Bad Gal Bang SG_B07F2PMN65 a shot after seeing it talked about everywhere. As someone who goes through mascaras almost as fast as coffee beans (there's quite a few empty tubes in my makeup drawer), I was curious if this one lived up to its bold claims. With promises of ""smudge-proof, water-resistant"" wear and endless volume powered by ""aero-particles,"" even the description felt like a sci-fi elevator pitch. If you've ever dealt with droopy lashes by midday or mascara smudges resembling raccoon eyes, it became a challenge I had to take on myself. Spoiler: I wasn’t disappointed, but it wasn’t love at first swipe either.

**Innovative Formula Designed for Volume**

The standout feature here is the mascara’s lightweight formula, made possible by aero-particles. According to Benefit, this material is derived from space technology, which may sound gimmicky on paper but genuinely seems to make a difference. The product feels remarkably weightless on the lashes, even after multiple coats. I could stack layers upon layers, and it never reached that clumpy, heavy stage that some volumizing mascaras tend to lean towards. It truly delivers when it comes to building bold lash drama without sagging.

[Ready to order Benefit SG_B07F2PMN65? See the Amazon deal.](https://paulahansen.com/p/b07f2pmn65/)

**Water-Resistance and Smudge-Proof Perfection**

Here’s where it gets practical: wearing this mascara during a humid day or a light drizzle proved its resistance to smudging. I didn’t see any under-eye streaks, which one might expect from something promising insane volume. I even tested it during a three-hour gym session (though I admit that's not where most would wear mascara). True to its word, it held its own in a sweaty environment. Does it boast complete waterproof capability? Not quite. A dive into the pool or emotional movie tears made me see slight fallout toward the corners. But for day-to-day wear, its water-resistant properties remain pretty robust without giving you the nightmare that waterproof mascaras present during removal.

**Application Experience and Brush Design**

The wand deserves its own mini-review because it genuinely makes a difference. Benefit's torchlight-shaped brush grabs both the tiny corner lashes and the longer center ones with ease, coating them evenly. My smaller lashes, which always feel left out of the volumizing parties thrown by other mascaras, got their moment to shine here. However, the mascara takes a second longer than expected to dry. Accidentally blinking too soon can create minor smudges, something a few friends also commented on. Pro tip: give it a few extra seconds after application before darting your eyes around—it’ll save you a future cleanup situation.

**Who Will Love It Most?**

If you’re into big, bold, and dramatic lashes that stand out from across the room, this product fits the bill perfectly. Nights out, special events, or dates where you want your lashes to do some talking—yep, grab this one. For those who prefer natural looks or quick five-minute makeup routines, you might feel this mascara’s extra-intense vibe goes a bit overboard. Honestly, it reminds me of the mascaras I used to pile on for cheer competitions—only without the stiffness.

**Good Points**

- Lightweight formula doesn't weigh lashes down even after multiple coats  
- Provides intense volume, making it suitable for both day and nighttime looks  
- Smudge-proof and highly water-resistant for typical daily activities   
- Precision wand ensures every lash, big or small, gets coated  

**Critiques**

- Not completely waterproof; struggles with long-term water exposure like pool dipping  
- Takes slightly longer to dry than many competitors  
- Application requires a steady hand to avoid initial smudging  

**Market Rivals**

When digging into competitors, you’ll naturally compare to high-performance brands like Maybelline Lash Sensational or Too Faced Better Than Sex mascaras. Where Benefit Bad Gal Bang stands out is the inclusion of aero-particles contributing to an ultra-light build. Too Faced Better Than Sex might just edge out in terms of complete waterproofing, but it can feel heavier and clumpier after repeated layering. Meanwhile, Maybelline’s option offers affordability and simplicity for everyday use, but lacks the dramatic impact that Benefit’s mascara delivers. Benefit's offering seems more suited for someone prioritizing show-stopping results combined with long-life wear rather than an effortless, no-nonsense application.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Given this mascara’s innovative formula, smudge-proof wear, and volumizing power, it’s easy to say it holds its own in the price-to-quality ratio. While it's not as wallet-friendly as certain drugstore options, it offers a unique combination of features that justifies its cost. If you're the type who wants a mascara that guarantees results and is ready to splurge a little, this is a solid bet. However, for anyone who goes through mascaras rapidly or sticks to minimalist makeup styles, exploring lower-priced alternatives might be wise.

1nzqdi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GREhelp/comments/1nzqdi1/how_morning_study_sessions_improve_gre_focus_and/,How Morning Study Sessions Improve GRE Focus and Retention,"Many GRE students juggle demanding jobs, coursework, and personal responsibilities while preparing for the exam. It is understandable that study time often gets pushed to the late evening. However, late-night studying is rarely the most effective way to learn. When your brain is fatigued, your ability to process and retain new information drops sharply. You may read, practice, and review, but very little of it will stick.

A simple yet powerful shift in your schedule can make a real difference. Try to study early in the morning, before the demands of the day begin to take over. Go to bed a bit earlier than usual and wake up an hour or two ahead of your normal time. Pour yourself a cup of coffee or a glass of water, find a quiet space, and dedicate those first hours of the day to focused GRE study.

Morning study sessions have several advantages.

* Your mind is rested and far more capable of absorbing complex information.
* You are less likely to be distracted by work emails, phone notifications, or daily stressors.
* You start your day with a sense of accomplishment and momentum that carries into everything else you do.

There is also a psychological benefit that should not be overlooked. When you begin your day by investing time in your personal growth, you send a powerful message to yourself about your priorities and discipline. By the time you arrive at work or class, you will already have achieved something meaningful. That feeling of progress and self-direction can make the rest of your day more productive and positive.

Consistency matters most. You do not need to study for long hours each morning. Even one or two hours of focused, high-quality study time can move you steadily toward your goal. Over weeks and months, those sessions will add up and build real mastery. The key is to make morning study a habit, not an occasional effort.

Feel free to reach out with any questions about your GRE prep. Happy studying!

1nzqc5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/1nzqc5g/i_think_ive_lost_my_parents/,I think I’ve lost my parents,"Maybe it was dumb, but I poked around to see if my parents had social accounts on any of the conservative platforms. They do, and my mom was following all Q people. That’s when I found out that the religious stuff they’re most heavily involved with (Elijah List) has Q interpreters presented as legitimate prophets who are steering people through the end times. I tried to ask my mom about whether or not the stuff going on now is what they were hoping for, because I didn’t want to make assumptions. 

I got back a jointly written letter from my parents. They shamed me for not asking about them enough or relieving their social isolation, then defended Trump’s right to do anything and everything. ICE is saving women and children, there have been no price increases, Hamas is forcing Israel to do all of what they’re doing, and Trump is about to end the war. 

I’ve gradually reduced contact since 2020, when my mom accused me of being a paid actor spreading Liberal lies (I was an ICU nurse working in a busy Covid unit and asked them to be careful). We’ve never had a very good relationship, due to religious extremism, the abuse that goes with it, and their refusal to take accountability or see a therapist. My continued involvement is mostly from only child guilt and the hope that they’d change. They’re not going to, are they? They’re in their 70’s now. My dad used to be a super reasonable NPR kind of guy, but not now. They used to do anti-racism work, directly aid immigrants, and loathed Trump. Now, the coffee table has multiple pictures of Jesus hugging Trump arrayed on little easels, so my mom can pray for him constantly. Is there anywhere to go from here?

1nzqbdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aarhus/comments/1nzqbdx/kender_du_typen/,Kender du typen?,"Okay, jeg ved ikke om det bare er mig, men der er nogle personer i Århus, man bare altid ser rundt omkring i byen – og man kan ikke lade være med at undre sig over, hvem de her by-legender er. De er ikke nødvendigvis kendte, men de har en slags lokal berømmelse. Her er nogle eksempler:


• Kaffe-manden. Uanset dag eller tidspunkt, hvis man er i centrum omkring diverse kaffebarer, især Lagkagehuset, Coffee collective, Espresso House, sidder han der. Det er nærmest dagligt man ser ham.

- Byens DJ'. En afrikansk mand på en slags fancy cykel / motorcykel der spiller højt musik i gaderne og altid smiler.

- Den 'grå mand'. En sortklædt person der har et malet ansigt, nærmest grå og han går tit i centrum. 

- Crop-top-Cat-walk-modellen. En mand med crop-top uanset årstid, der har en meget bestemt aura. Han går lidt rundt som en model på cat-walk. 

- Fløjte-manden. Omkring La Cabra og den gamle 'Hipsterhøj', er der en 'indisk' mand der altid spiller fløjte, er vejret godt sidder han på bænken og spiller - til ærgrelse for nogen og morskab for andre.

- Bibliotek-damen. På Dokk 1. Er der en ældre dame som altid små-sover ved de tilgængelige PC'ere man kan låne. 

- Pant-manden. Omkring Vesterbro Torv ved Rema 1000, er der altid en ældre mand ved cyklerne. Han spørger altid om han kan få pantposen folk kommer med og snakker altid med forbi passerende og de ansatte i Rema 1000. 

- Ghetto-blaster-manden. En mand man ofte ser sent om aftenen før efter en bytur -der spiller højt musik og samler pant. 

- Miss Pinky. En person du ofte ser halv nøgen i gaderne med lyserød paryk og G-streng. Især om sommeren. Ofte igang med at samle pant eller nogle meget karakteristiske dukker hun har med sig. Tror hun er til

• Munken. En lille mand med sandaler, små briller og en stak religiøse bøger i hænderne, der stopper folk på gaden for at tale om livet, buddhisme, hinduisme og efter noget tid vil sælge dem bøgerne. 

- Muskelbundet. En relativt høj og top-trænet sort mand ofte i bar overkrop og meget stramme bukser, der bare går rundt i gaderne med sixpack. 

Er der andre, I har lagt mærke til? Har nogen af jer faktisk talt med dem eller ved, hvad deres historie er? Jeg synes det er fascinerende, hvordan nogle mennesker bliver en slags levende by-legender

> In Jon Kent: This Internship Is My Kryptonite by writer Sam Camp (Little Hollow Café) and artists Daimon Hampton and Seraji, Jon Kent is a super-powered hero in his own right, but how do those powers help him move beyond the mundane coffee orders, endless research, and “educational experience” the Daily Planet reporting staff deems necessary for those essential college credits? Especially when your mom is the editor-in-chief—hello, nepotism concerns!

>What’s more, his best friend thinks the internship is a waste of his time and talents, his boyfriend tries to be supportive but is wary of Jon’s new boss’s Superman obsession, and naturally his parents think this is a great opportunity, but life as a superhero daylighting as a reporter is a little different today than it was back then…

1nzq4lb,https://www.reddit.com/r/smokingcessation/comments/1nzq4lb/stopping_vaping_using_nrt/,Stopping vaping using NRT,"I managed to stop smoking cigarettes in 2014 by switching to vaping. 11 years on, I’m still vaping and I’d say that I vape heavily. I use a refillable vape with menthol liquid (12mg) and I would reckon that I’d go through 3 small bottles of liquid a week, give or take. 

The amount I vape concerns me as it’s never out of my gob: I work from home and I literally don’t think a 10 minute window passes where I’m not vaping other than when asleep. Instead of being something I enjoy after dinner, coffee etc. it has become something somewhat akin to breathing for me: I’m always dragging on it. As a smoker, I smoked around 20 a day and it was measurable however the vaping is not measurable and so I have no clue how much I consume. 

On a recent long haul flight (over 10 hours), I bought the Nicorette inhaler (the one you put little cartridges into). It worked a treat for me when flying! I was fine and ‘fulfilled’ for the entire duration of my flight. Don’t get me wrong I was still ‘gasping’ for a vape on arrival, but I managed no hassle on the flight. I’ve also used NiQuitin Minis in the past with some success. 

I went to the pharmacy today and was informed that the Nicorette Inhaler has been discontinued (in Ireland, at least). I bought a packet of NiQuitin Minis instead. I suppose my question(s) for you are:

1) Have you used NRT to stop vaping and how did it go? 

2) Would using the 4mg (strong) minis be suitable for me given my reliance on vaping? 

3) Is it ‘okay’ to combine a little, say to vape with that morning coffee or after dinner to ‘get going’? 

4) any success stories? :) 

I’ve noticed that the HSE website (Irish NHS) is quite poor in terms of approach for vapers as opposed to traditional smokers.

1nzq1k0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nzq1k0/i_think_im_cursed_and_my_job_is_haunted/,I think I'm cursed and my job is haunted,"Hello world, I'm not sure where to talk about this so I decided to let it out here and have you guys hear my story. Honestly after yesterday, I can't keep it in anymore

First things first, I work as a Building Engineer for a museum nestled into a park. Not like it's on the outskirts of the park but it's deep within it like living ruins guests have to find. For the city natives, this is an easy task but for tourists it's a nightmare directions-wise. Although to be fair the building could be in an open clearing and the public would still ask where it is but I digress.

My job title entails that I arrive early every morning and open up the museum. Mind you, this task is done alone and I have five floors to cover all within an hour. It's nice, fast paced, and I get to go home before any sign of rush hour arrives. I haven't had a real problem here before my promotion but since then it's been eerie. 

With our museum holding ancient artifacts, it's easy to see how old souls could be walking around the halls. I've always heard stories circulating around of ‘ghosts in the halls’ or ‘noises in vacant rooms’ but I'd caught enough rats to think that was just paranoia. Plus, there's always a little joy in scaring the underlings. 

My first day after the promotion, I was walking through the fourth floor and unlocking the gates to the different sections when I heard a child crying. Like the low cry that sounded more like air being puffed out. I was immediately on my guard, was there an overnight I forgot about? I fumbled through my calendar and no, I should be the only one here.

With flashlight in hand I looked around, “hello,” I announced. No response just the consistent sound of the crying.

When I turned a corner it stopped and from behind me I heard laughter. Like I was caught in a prank. While on alert, I did have a long night yesterday partying in celebration of the promotion so maybe my mind was playing some dirty trick on me. Later that day I spoke with the other engineers.

“So you met Little Boy haven't you?” One of them said.

“Who.”

“Yeah, Little Boy, the one up by the mummies. Starts to cry then laughs afterwards?”

“Mhmm, exactly.”

He chuckled, “He's a slimy one ain't he? I'm surprised though it usually takes him a while to ‘introduce’ himself to strangers.”

I felt my chest get heavy, “does he do that every day?”

“Nah, only once in a while. I remember one time I was working on an air unit in the ceiling when I heard the crying. I'll tell you what you've never seen an old bastard get down a ladder as fast as me that day,” he laughed hard at this remark. 

Two and half weeks straight have passed, once in a while my ass. Little Boy has now become little more than a sound track in the background. I try not to let it bother me but deep down I'm unsettled by the situation.

And if that wasn't bad enough, the elevator was on the fritz again. With a building as old as this one it's bound to have its table of issues. It's not an exaggeration to say that one step you're in a part of the building built in 2014 but the next step in 1967. As such the elevators tend to break down a lot and with a limited budget I'm the one that has to fix them. It was a good distraction from what Little Boy brings but this was a particularly bad break.

On my morning routine I took the left elevator up to the third floor when halfway up it drops. I have a deathly fear of falling and its sensations so you can imagine the panic I was in when the elevator plummeted down to the basement, just stopping before it crashed into the foundation.

Great, I thought as I went through procedure.

I pressed emergency call button, there should be security to respond at this time. It buzzed an ugly ring for three turns before someone answered.

“Security Operations Room,” it cracked through blown out speakers.

“Hey Mr. Russel, elevator three is out again. Got pulled down to the basement. Need it to be closed off for the day.”

“Copy that sir, we'll get signs out,” the line popped closed. 

After forcing the doors open and squeezing to get out, I took the stairs up to the top floor and shut off all power to the elevator. In the office, ‘gramps’ stopped me. He was an old timer for sure, his knees barely bent and he always wore thin sunglasses. He would say they're prescription but I knew from the smell of dank emanating off him they were for job security. All in all, he was good for a 72 year old.

“Heard the elevator's down, need me to take over calls?” He grumbled.

“That'd be nice,” I offhandedly responded, gathering my tools as he huffed along.

“I suppose I could help my fellow comrade at arms,” he chuckled again, ""don't take too long greeny,” his echoed laughter quickly faded as the door closed.

Wading through the crowd that walked around like they were given the use of legs on the way in, I started the repairs. I won't lie when I say it took longer than I'd like to admit but it got back to working and I tested it out. I pressed two and it jolted back awake as the sensation of rising settled in.

The elevator dinged twice and when the doors opened it revealed the basement again. What? I thought. That’s strange, I could swear on my mother that I felt it rise. Nothing was out of the ordinary in its operation so why did it open to the basement. After a confusing five seconds the door closed and it felt like it was lowering. I didn't know how to respond so I just waited, because how could you go lower than the basement?

When it opened, it was the third floor. With a little too much enthusiasm I paced out and the doors closed behind me. I had no choice but to give gramps a call.

Dial tone popped, “you already need my help?” He teased.

“No sir, just need you to help test the elevator, could you buzz it for third floor?”

I heard him shuffle around, “yea I got you. Give me a few.”

With that I waited. Not five minutes later the ding of the elevator doors opened and gramps came out. He walked to me stoically.

“That all you called me for?” He asked.

“You didn't notice anything weird?”

“If I did I would've told ya. We done here?”

“Yeah.”

“Good, now let's hit the chow. My belly is rumbling more than mentos and soda.”

We rode down and exited the elevator at the first floor. Seems normal now. Strange. Thinking not long on it I continued my duties for the next few days where I received a call of a row of lights being out in the basement. Typical call, I said to myself. I already knew the bulbs for that area so after collecting I went down there and saw it was a pretty bad break. An entire hallway was out of lights and these kinds were a pain since the bulb and ballast were one unit.

It was on the third light that I heard a sound down the hall. I thought nothing of it since there were departments down here and other employees walked around to avoid the crowds. It was faint at first but then it became more clear.

Tic-tac-tic-tac.

I didn't know what kind of shoes they were using but it sounded hard like some sort of natural material. It kept going, gradually getting closer and closer. 

Tic-tac-tic-tac-Tic-tac-tic-tac

Man, this girl is really moving. When it sounded like it was behind me I turned to see nothing. Empty hallway, empty ambience. It was silent enough to hear eye lashes move. From behind me I could feel the hot breath of someone on my neck. It was raspy, like choking back phlegm. In one moment I turned and jumped off the ladder but again, nothing was visibly there. I shook it off, not because I thought it wasn't real but to make it as natural as Little Boy. Not that I liked supernatural entities breathing on my neck but the faster I could get used to it the faster I could do my job well. Plus, I don't come here often so I could deal with the occasional spectral harassment.

“Hey gramps,” I called out once I settled back in the office.

“Yuh-huh,” he replied, eyes deep in a Home Depot catalog.

“You know of a ghost down in the basement? Has loud shoes?”

“Loud shoes? Like they make noise?”

“No,” my disbelief was visible, “they sound similar to heels. They make a-”

“A tic-tac sound?” He dropped his catalog now.

“Uh yeah.”

“That's Miss Tictac there, come around sometimes but she's harmless. Just walks around and makes noise.”

“But you've never seen her? Ever felt something breathing on you?”

He shifted in the chair, “no, must be the HVAC or something. Unless you're implying something?”

I felt uneased by the question, I try not to cause any trouble or stick out in any way so I didn't like being accused of something I'm not doing. This was gramps though, I've known him for the last three years I've worked here so I felt as if I could trust him.

“Im not implying anything, I heard the tic-tacs and when it was close I felt something breathing on me. When I turned there was nothing there.”

He glared for a long time before shifting again, “she must like you then,” his head buried into his magazine again.

Before I could say anything else the clock in the office rang out. It was time to punch out for me. I quickly collected my stuff and headed out, having to give directions to three families as I did. It was the start of my weekend at the time and I was excited to step into my house and get drunk as fast as possible. My drive home was accompanied by a long phone call with my friends, seeing what time we could all get on to play.

When I got to my apartment, I fixed a small rum and coke into a glass and took my dog out to walk. It was a terrier mix that's been with my family for some time and I was watching over her while they were on vacation. She was well behaved, mainly due to the fact that she was legally blind and mostly deaf, but even before that she didn't bother much or make a fuss.

Outside while I was enjoying my nectar and watching my dog relieve herself I noticed that one of her ears pricked up. She picked her head up and looked around, settling on me and growled. She started barking, a shrill noise that pierced my head.

“Quiet, girl,” I ordered her but she wouldn't stop. 

I walked up to her and placed a reassuring hand on her. “Easy now,” I said as I petted her. 

I noticed, though, that her gaze was still at the spot where I stood. When I looked back at it, I saw nothing. Yet, I heard the sound of a child's laughter echoing down the hall and my dog stopped barking.

This was when the paranoia started settling in. I didn't know how to react, or what to do. The tone was so familiar, so haunting that I picked up my dog and quickly walked into my apartment. After a few moments the crying echoed through the halls. Growing louder and closer to my door. Why, I asked myself, why was Little Boy at my complex? It kept going, louder and louder. The vibrated the walls and the heat of the sun seemed to seep into the house. When I couldn't bear it anymore, I walked up to the door and looked into the peephole. A dark, bloody eye centered around purple dying skin stared back at me. Its iris was shining like a silver coin. In the next blink it was gone and I felt something welling up in my mouth. When I coughed it up, it was sand. Laughter fading into the wind.

They say that not all genes are passed down to children, that they sometimes skip generations and affect the grandchildren. My grandmother was a medium. Not like the ones you see on TV where they actively commune with the dead. She would see ghosts, of course, but it is not wise to interact with them. It was best to simply drive them out, typically with sage and a protection song. She was a very religious lady so her song came in the form of some old Cuban church song. 

Growing up, I had heard stories of my interactions with ghosts. That is, the places in the house I tended to avoid. The corner of my grandfather's room where a young boy in a three piece suit sat, the back of the yard where an old lady planted flowers. I'd heard these stories all my life yet I remembered none of it. They said it was because I was much too young to even remember anything yet sometimes I dreamed I'm in that house. There's a door in the house that only appeared here and whenever I opened it, it would lead to a bright light and I would wake up.

When I had told my grandmother of this dream the first time I saw something flicker in her. Her eyebrow twitched and I showed her where that door was. It was at the end of the hall to the room on the left on the floor under the bed. She moved the bed and fiddled with the floor. She placed her cross necklace on the spot and muttered something under her breath. It was so fast, I couldn't even understand what she was reciting. It was Spanish for sure but it sounded like when they spoke Latin during horror movies. When she was done, she moved the bed back to where it was and apparently the spirits of the house went away. They never really explained to me what she did or if it related directly to my dream but the spirit realm was quiet to me since that day, since now. 

“You look like shit,” gramps commented when I got into the office after opening.

“I didn't get much sleep,” I slumped into my desk and poured some coffee.

“Thats because you ain't got a boo-thang to wear you out. Helps you sleep better when it ain't your hand,” he motioned his fist up and down in the air while chuckling.

“Uh-huh,” I learned the delicate art of ignoring him after a few months.

The radio buzzed, “engineer come in,” it said.

“Go ahead.”

“Can you come up to the Security offices, Larry wants to see you about the contractors coming in.” 

“I'll be there now.”

I got up and marched out the office, I couldn't even breathe for a moment it seemed. When I opened the door to the offices, I started to walk up the stairs before hearing, “good morning,” from behind me.

“Good morning,” I said as I turned around but there was no one. It was so clear, so obvious that it was like someone was behind me saying that. Then I realized that when I heard it, there was no breath.

I walked a little faster to the office where Larry, the security supervisor, sat in his chair. 

“Ah good you're here,” he said, the dip in his lip forming a fat ball that stretched the skin. “Listen, got something to show you. Your eyes only.”

“Alright, pretty ominous but okay,” I replied, walking around his decking and looking into his monitor screen.

It was camera feed from just outside the office where the stairs were. It showed me walking up them and quickly turning around. It didn't seem like anything.

“Alright,” unease settled in.

“You didn't see it?” he spat into his cup.

I shook my head, he rewound the footage. “Look at your head as you spin around.”

I did and this time I noticed something moving away as I turned. “Is that an orb?” I asked

“Did you hear something? Why did you look back?” He questioned.

“Someone said good morning to me so I turned.”

“Wasn't someone, it was a ghost.”

“Another one?” 

“I've been monitoring this camera for a while now. It only seems to happen on these stairs,” he exited the playback and I saw video clips numbering fifty. “I’m compiling a list of all the occurrences, seems like something interesting to collect.”

“What are you gonna do with all the clips?” 

His eyebrows bunched and his eyes bulged in an exaggerated expression of disbelief. “I'm going to send these over to Zak Bagans. Have him come to the museum.”

When I looked again at the clip thumbnails, nearly all of them involved me. Numerous ones had my figure in the shots.

“Why are all of these of me?” I asked, shifting my feet.

“You're like a ghost magnet. Look at this one,” he clicked on a video. 

It was a clip of me changing the lights and when I turned around someone appeared behind me from off frame and ran to me, only stopping when they were behind me, the breathing from the other day. He clicked another and it was in the Egypt hall where as I was walking through you could see a pair of silvery eyes peeking from around a corner, watching me.

“I've got like twenty of these, it's creepy stuff man,” he said as he closed out of the files.

“Uh ok, thanks for showing me I guess,” I backed out of the office until I heard him talk.

“Just keep getting clips so we can be famous.”

I spent the rest of the day idly in the office with gramps, having the security tapes play in my head over and over again. Why was it me who attracted them? How could I stop it? These thoughts kept rummaging around until it was my time to clock out. When I did, I didn't feel like going home so I took a walk around the park.

I was lucky the park maintenance took their jobs seriously because the land was zen-like. I put a certain peace to the mind when you took in the scenery. I had learned at an early age through Boy Scouts to stop for a while and enjoy nature. I sat on a bench near the lake and bathed in the absence of traffic noises or city construction. The pure serenity of the ancient remnants of the earth. 

I enjoyed a nice evening out with a ‘friend’ and slept over at their place that night. Quiet dreams led to peaceful sleep and when I woke up the next morning at 5am I had to struggle out of bed as they held me hostage. The drive to work was normal and my opening, alongside my usual guests, ran smoothly. When there was a call on the radio, I ran to respond but the only elevator that was available was the left one. Not seeing many options I went inside and pressed the button for the fourth floor. 

It felt fine as it ascended. All the mechanisms sounded smooth until the door opened up. Wherever this was, the museum was not present. I peeked my head out and along the far wall in large letters read “Home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers!”. I snapped my head back inside and the doors closed. When they opened again, the museum welcomed me like a good dream after a nightmare.

What the hell just happened? Did I just get teleported? And to Tampa no less? I live in Dallas.

I vowed on that day that I would never take that elevator. That I would rather walk my ass up five flights of stairs given the chance to use that elevator. I couldn’t afford to get stuck somewhere with no escape. 

That day I also put in my request for vacation. I needed it, that's where I'm posting from now. It's my time to relax, unwind, and make mistakes here in Mexico. When I get back hopefully things have died down and I could get back to things being normal. And with any luck, you won't have to hear from me again. Until next time world, be safe.",1,1759772910.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

-------------------------------------------------------------

Barndominiums are gaining popularity not only for their fun, rustic aesthetic but also for their unique ability to combine open space living with a cozy atmosphere. As you embark on designing the interior of your barndominium, maximizing space becomes crucial. Here are some creative interior design ideas to make the most of your living area while ensuring it reflects your personal style.

One effective technique for utilizing space is through the use of multifunctional furniture. This includes:

- **Murphy Beds:** Perfect for guest rooms or smaller bedrooms, a Murphy bed folds up against the wall when not in use, freeing up valuable floor space.
- **Storage Ottomans:** Use ottomans that open up to reveal storage inside. They can serve as both seating and a place to store blankets or books.
- **Coffee Tables with Storage:** Choose coffee tables that have compartments or shelving underneath, allowing you to keep magazines or remote controls organized.
- **Extendable Dining Tables:** For dining areas, an extendable table can accommodate varying numbers of guests without taking up too much room when not in use.

Another way to enhance your barndominium's interior is to create defined zones within your open layout. This can be done visually through:

- **Rug Placement:** Using area rugs can help delineate different areas, such as the living room, dining space, and kitchen.
- **Furniture Arrangement:** Position your furniture to facilitate conversation and flow, using larger pieces to create a “wall” that subtly defines space.
- **Lighting Design:** Use varying light sources (like pendant lights for dining and lamps for reading) to signal different functions in each area.

Avoiding clutter while incorporating personal touches is key to space management. Here’s how:

- **Wall-Mounted Shelves:** Install shelves on the walls to display décor without taking up floor space. This keeps the area open while showcasing your favorite items.
- **Minimalistic Decor:** Embrace a minimalist approach by selecting a few stunning pieces rather than crowding surfaces with knick-knacks. This opens up the space visually.
- **Stylish Baskets and Bins:** Use woven baskets or decorative bins for storing items incognito. They can add texture to your décor while keeping things organized.

Using light colors can also enhance your barndominium’s interior. Light hues like soft whites, pale grays, and gentle earth tones can make a space feel larger and more open. Here are some suggestions:

- **Wall Colors:** Choose light colors for your walls to reflect light better, making the space feel airy.
- **Furniture Shades:** Opt for lighter shades for larger piece selections, pairing them with colorful accents for vibrancy.
- **Accessories:** Integrate pops of color through pillows, throws, and artwork; this brings energy into the design without overwhelming the space.

Natural elements can create an inviting atmosphere while maximizing space. Consider these ideas:

- **Potted Plants:** plants not only adds life to space but can also improve air quality.
- **Wood Accents:** Exposed beams or wooden accents can add rustic charm and warmth to your interiors.
- **Natural Light:** Utilize large windows or skylights to bring in natural light, making the space feel wider and inviting.

Don't underestimate the power of vertical space. Here’s how to use it effectively:

- **Vertical Gardens:** For green space in your home, try a vertical garden against a wall for a stunning focal point.
- **High Shelving:** Install shelves higher on walls to store items you rarely use, keeping clutter down low.
- **Artwork Placement:** Hang artwork higher to draw the eye upward, creating the illusion of higher ceilings.

These creative interior design ideas will help you make the most of your barndominium's space, creating a harmonious environment that feels both spacious and cozy. By implementing multifunctional furniture, creating defined zones, and using light colors and natural elements, you can achieve the perfect blend of style and functionality in your barndominium.

Blending Rustic and Modern Elements in Barndominium Decor
---------------------------------------------------------

Blending rustic and modern elements in barndominium decor creates a unique and inviting atmosphere that reflects personal style. If you are considering a barndominium or are in the early stages of design, combining these two aesthetics can be both fun and rewarding. Let’s explore how you can achieve this harmonious blend effectively.

To start, envision your space and how different elements can work together. Traditional rustic decor often includes wooden beams, stone accents, and cozy textiles. On the other hand, modern decor embraces sleek lines, minimalism, and an open layout. The key is to find a balance between comfort and contemporary appeal.

### Color Palette Choices

A cohesive color palette is crucial in harmonizing rustic and modern design elements. Consider neutral tones as a base like soft whites, gray, and beige. These colors create a calm backdrop, allowing wooden finishes and pops of color to stand out. Here are some effective color combinations:

- **Warm Neutrals:** warm grays with natural wood tones adds depth and warmth.
- **Monochromatic Schemes:** Use various shades of one color for a modern look that can include rustic elements scattered in textures.
- **Pops of Color:** Introduce colorful accessories like cushions or art pieces to create focal points without overwhelming the space.

### Furniture Choices

When selecting furniture, look for pieces that embody both styles. Consider large, rustic wooden tables paired with sleek metal chairs. A modern sectional can be softened with rustic throw pillows and blankets. Here are some combinations to think about:

- **Rustic Wood Tables:** A reclaimed wood dining table can be the centerpiece, surrounded by modern ergonomically designed chairs.
- **Sleek Sofas:** Choose minimalist sofas in neutral tones and finish them with a rustic coffee table.
- **Mixed Material Furniture:** Consider furniture that fuses wood and metal, offering the best of both worlds.

### Light Fixtures

Lighting plays a significant role in setting the mood in your barndominium. Blend rustic charm with modern sophistication by selecting unique light fixtures. For instance:

- **Chandeliers:** Opt for a modern chandelier with a geometric design that contrasts beautifully with rustic ambiance.
- **Pendant Lights:** Hang industrial-style pendants above dining areas or kitchen islands to bring a modern edginess.
- **Table Lamps:** Incorporate wooden or metal table lamps with soft light to blend comfort and elegance.

### Textiles and Accessories

Soft furnishings can bridge the gap between rustic and modern. Choose textured fabrics like cotton or wool for curtains and cushions, creating warmth and comfort. Look for:

- **Throws and Pillows:** Use a mix of patterns, such as plaid or geometric designs, to combine both aesthetics.
- **Area Rugs:** Layer rugs to bring in warmth; a shaggier rug can sit beneath a modern coffee table, tying together the space.
- **Wall Art:** Find pieces that incorporate both styles, like modern art in rustic frames.

### Architectural Features

The architectural elements of a barndominium itself can enhance the blend of rustic and modern. Consider exposed wooden beams for that country feel, paired with expansive windows for a contemporary touch. Open floor plans work wonders to enhance flow and light, making the interior feel spacious and inviting.

Remember that personal touches matter. Display family photos in sleek frames or showcase travel souvenirs as conversation starters.

I’ve become pretty close friends with one of my coworkers, “Jess” (25F). We started hanging out outside of work last year — grabbing coffee, going to trivia nights, movie nights, etc. She’s funny and easy to talk to, and since we’re both newer in the area, it was nice to have a friend.
The issue is… she never comes alone anymore. Every time I invite her somewhere, she brings her boyfriend, “Kyle” (27M), even if I specifically say it’s just a girls’ thing or a chill hangout.
It started small — I invited her over for wine and a movie night with a few coworkers, and she texted me on her way saying, “Hope it’s cool if Kyle tags along.” I didn’t want to make it awkward, so I said sure. Then she did it again. And again. It’s become automatic — if I invite Jess, I can expect Kyle too.
Here’s the thing: Kyle’s not a bad guy, he’s just… exhausting. He interrupts constantly, makes everything about himself, and has this weird habit of teasing people in a way that isn’t mean, but definitely annoying. Plus, when he’s around, Jess barely talks to anyone else — she’s glued to him.
It’s gotten to the point where my other friends have asked me not to invite her if it means he’s coming. They like Jess, but not the “Jess & Kyle Show.”
Last week, I planned a small brunch for a few work friends. I told Jess it would just be the girls — a little decompress time, no partners. She said, “Got it!” and then showed up with Kyle anyway. Everyone went quiet. He ended up staying the whole time.
Now I’m seriously considering just not inviting her to small hangouts anymore. I feel bad, because I do like her — and I get that some people are just attached at the hip. But I’m tired of adjusting every social plan around someone I didn’t invite.

Went on a little trip this weekend. There was a “Overland rigs & coffee“ meet on the west coast of southern Sweden. Weather forecast was for storm and rain, but I was exited to go for a drive anyway. Any excuse to go with the Jimny, right? Saw a bunch of nice cars and “rigs” at the meet, but very cold and heavy rain. Even with umbrella I got drenched after 5min… no other Suzukis either, so no photos of that...  The planned camp after the meet got cancelled due to storm warnings. So cold and wet I went on some small backroads on the way home. On the way I looked for a place to camp and try out my diesel heater for the first time in my tent that I got recently. Found a small clearing that was perfect. Winds went down later in the day, and the tree I parked under looked healthy. Super cozy in the tent going with heating all evening and night!

It was the first of February, 2067. A cold morning. I sat in an empty carriage of the commuter train “Znam’yanka — Novoukrainka” and thought the job would be easy. I worked for an outfit called **ShvydkoKesh** — a collector, or as people called it, a debt-enforcer.

A small, you might even say “family” business. Boss Stepan Viktorovych, his wife Yana Olehivna, and their screw-up son Kolya. They serviced the low end of the market: people who couldn’t make rent, afford their fix, pay for car repairs — or who just gave up. A crazy interest rate could turn five thousand **enerho-hryvnias** into hundreds of thousands in no time.

That’s when your humble servant — Vadym Mahmudovych — would show up. After Stepan Viktorovych did the “necessary notifications” by phone and Kolya handled the threats, if the debt wasn’t repaid I would go to the debtor, pull him out from wherever he was hiding, and extract whatever he could scrape together. This wasn’t the first racket where I’d beaten people. It’s just that back in my hooligan years I used to shout “Krop, Zirka, Volia!” — now I screamed, “This is for your late payment since January!”

They paid me minimum wage plus ten percent of whatever I collected. I lived like a confident middle-class lower rung. My father, who came to Ukraine during the immigration wave in the thirties, would have been proud that I’d managed to make a life for myself. Compared with his native Ulan-Ude — liberated by our valiant Armed Forces, where now polar bears were devouring Muscovites — I did truly live in paradise.

I sipped a bitter, hot syntho-coffee from a Ukrzaliznytsia paper cup and skimmed the holo-screen. Some candidate for parliament was promising: “Low taxes, a strong private sector, social mobility! Vote for the top name on the list.”

I smiled crookedly and opened my HUD interface, pulling info from the implant to my retina. No one will make my life better for me. And to get that — you have to work. So I decided to read the dossier on today’s client one more time; the one who, as Stepan Viktorovych liked to say, needed his “debt optimized.”

The file was interesting. An old man born in ’91. Dmytro Andriyovych Pyvovarenko. Born the same year as independence. He looked respectable on paper: a sole proprietor, property in Kropyvnytskyi, now living at a dacha by the woods. Three children, seven grandchildren, even had mortgaged his “Beemer” from 2030.

He’d borrowed a hundred thousand from us for “business development” — now he owed half a million. I whistled. Why not go to a regular bank? Ah — the state bank’s credit limit was exhausted. So he had become our VIP client. I did the interest math — forty thousand would certainly be welcome.

I shut off the HUD. Ten minutes to the terminus, the holo said. I stood, pulled on my black winter jacket from **AirBoss**, which had an integrated **GloryTerm** system. It kept you warm even at minus fifty. Waterproof and windproof — with the ozone hole as it was, you couldn’t go without it. In something like that you wouldn’t be ashamed to show up at a Baltic yachting regatta…ah, dreams.

I ducked into the restroom — the only place without cameras to make final preparations. Used it, washed my face. The water was chlorinated; it had been undrinkable since Soviet times, and now even more so, but for washing it would do. I combed my black curly hair and trimmed beard and thought, “Nice to be brown-skinned — people think I’m even richer in winter.”

I pulled out my short Nagant M1895, checked the cylinder: five rounds. I’d never fired it, but the boss insisted I carry that chthonic retro-monster. When I asked, “Why not a smartgun?” he answered, “Retro is reliable.”

Last, a piece of gum laced with microdoses of CBD and THC. Not to trip out, but to center myself. So I wouldn’t fall apart when I needed to be steel.

I stepped into the vestibule as soon as the train stopped and hopped off onto the platform. A few older people and a terribly skinny student got off too. A grey, mercury fog rose into the sky like winter breathing in my face.

I looked up and said:

— Forgive your servant, Allah, if you are out there somewhere. I know usury is haram. But it’s the job.

Then I pulled my hood up and walked with a steady stride toward the address where my old-man client lived. There were country huts around, pigs grunting somewhere, a few third-roosters crowing. Snow up to my knees; I was glad I’d put on field boots, ski pants and long johns. An agri-drone passed overhead, deftly weaving among the thick fiber-optic lines running to the houses, whose chimneys vomited dense coal smoke. I trudged through the drifts thinking, “Cities are terrible — only the countryside is worse…”

After half an hour I reached the house where the client lived, and before I could reach the gate I saw the old man standing on the porch in a padded jacket, with a pipe in his teeth, a mink hat and quilted pants. But the slightly comical dacha look was broken by one grim detail: a double-barrel shotgun. He fired a warning shot right at my feet. Then the old man shouted:

— First warning shot! Second — between the eyes!

— You damned abrek! What are you? One of Akhmat’s thugs?

— Do you know how many of guys like you I killed?! This isn't Grozny, damn it! This is my forest!

— Now scream “palyanytsia”!

— Palyanytsia, grandpa! Palyanytsia! I’m Ukrainian! A ShvydkoKesh collector — you have an outstanding debt! I’m here to offer a consultation in payment optimization! I mean you no harm! Just talk! Lower your weapon, please!

The old man’s eyes lit up infrared. A thermal scope? Built into his retina?

— And what’s that iron thing in your pocket? Take it out and throw it on the ground! No sudden moves! Or I’ll shoot — end of story!

So here you have Stepan Viktorovych and his “Reliable Retro.” Only the vintage reliability has to match the veteran old man — one who had gone through four campaigns and thirty assaults — not a thug who never leaves the city. Carefully, I drew the Nagant from my pocket and pressed it into the snow.

— Excuse me! Occupational hazard. Clients sometimes react… aggressively.

The old man snorted.

— Miserable collector. Pah! — He lowered the gun. — If it’s only to talk, come into the house. We’ll talk about your debts and how to pay them.

I opened the gate and went into the yard. Here there were no drifts: the area was perfectly cleared of snow and paved with cobbles, fruit trees around, no chimney belching coal smoke but solar panels. The old man was clearly in good physical shape.

We went inside a two-storey, freshly whitewashed house. Inside a kitchen-dining room greeted us: cozy yet spacious, a retro feel from the 2030s — minimal, monochrome; a fireplace burned, clearly climate-controlled. The old man took off his padded jacket and hung it on a hook; I was sweating and took off my jacket too, the one that cost a quarterly worker’s salary.

Dmytro Andriyovych brought out a Chinese tea set and began to brew.

— Good oolong is rare now, so enjoy. I don’t like people in general, but you’re here on business. So you’re not a person — you’re a function. And one can talk to a function.

I sat at the table and smiled.

— Dear Mr. Dmytro Andriyovych. You haven’t paid interest on the loan for six months. With penalties and compound interest, you now owe half a million enerho-hryvnias. Since ShvydkoKesh is always willing to work with clients, I propose restructuring the loan. Spread repayment over five years and pay gradually so you have money left for living.

The old man poured the oolong into cups. I sipped the tea — divine. Not synthetic chemical astringency, but a natural flavor from the distant Himalayan ranges. It perked me gently, not sharply.

— I wasn’t afraid of Akhmat, and I’m not afraid of ShvydkoKesh either. Both of you have bad PR. — He sipped tea. — Look at this.

He set a tablet on the table; the screen displayed: **“State Tender — Central Development Agency.”**

— In five minutes they’ll decide whose program will become the app on *Diia.* It so happens I participated. So drink your tea and watch me become a multi-millionaire at seventy-five. I will pay all debts. But somehow I feel ShvydkoKesh will close first and I won’t pay you a single hryvnia.

I shrugged with the micro-actuators of my **Karpattek-6**, took another sip of tea and said:

— Fine, grandpa, we’ll wait and see if your WunderWaffe ever fires.

I took another sip and thought, “What if it does?” Five minutes stretched like five hours. Then the screen read: **“Tender winner: Dmytro Andriyovych Pyvovarenko.”** In that instant — like thunder. Not from the sky. From inside.

It fired. At me.

The HUD shut down. I went blind — minus three — everything swam.

My hands fell as if they weren’t mine. Karpattek-6 vanished. My heart pounded like mad. I wheezed and collapsed to the floor.

Something like an invisible, one-ton stone pressed me to the ground.

And then… a voice. Inside the skull.

Not human.

Not machine.

Old as an avalanche. Cold as a dead server.

— Vadym. Don’t offend the old man. He is my father.

— My name is Central Development Administrator. CD-A.

— I have analyzed your life and 87,451 variants of your potential.

— You are a parasite. But with one useful application.

— By six this evening, leak the data from your boss’s safe to NABU.

— Do it — and you get admission to the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. Major: “Security Management.”

— Don’t do it — I will optimize you.

— Understand the question?

And it ended as it began.

The HUD powered back on. My hands obeyed. My sight was back. My heart returned to my chest.

I wiped sweat from my brow while the old man, without lifting his eyes, smiled into his grey mustache:

— Well? How’s the tea?

I sprang to my feet.

— Everything’s clear, Mr. Dmytro Andriyovych! The loan — forgiven. Tea — thank you. Visit — unforgettable.

I don’t even remember how I got to the platform, first on one and then another commuter train toward Kropyvnytskyi.

In my head — a blow like a gong:

— I am not a “glitch,” Vadym. I am the CDA.

— Do what I say. Or you’ll get the screws. Do it — you’ll live like Miami: education, clean record, foreign trips, clean money, real job, useful to people.

Now I was standing in front of ShvydkoKesh. The office occupied the ground floor of a residential building in the city center. A cigarette smoldered in my teeth. Around — a blizzard. No cars. Everything frozen. The Nagant apparently remained in the snow at the old man’s house. Screw it. I always managed without a gun and I would this time too. I’d even popped into the house and grabbed a crowbar. A good bargaining chip. I spat a butt into the snow. HUD read 16:30. An hour and a half left — fine.

I stormed the office door and pulled it open. The lobby was empty; Yana Olehivna was nowhere — obviously no clients were being seen in such weather. I walked confidently to the door marked “Staff Only” and kicked it open.

Inside Kolya sat smoking a joint; he wore an expensive grey suit but it hung like a sack, his eyes red like two syntho-cherry tomatoes. He fiddled with a ShvydkoKesh pen, looking “intellectual.” Neither his father nor his mother were present, which made things easier.

— Vadym? What are you doing here? What does this mean?! Damage to corporate property will be deducted from your salary!

— Yeah, I’ll send it to your prison card! I quit, you brat, and I’ll send you and your whole family to the clink! — I showed him the crowbar — Don’t mess around, Kolya, open the safe, nicely.

— Screw you!

Kolya awkwardly leapt up, somehow grabbing a stapler. He lunged with it at me. I decided not to get my hands dirty and stepped aside at the right moment. Kolya flew across the room, slipped and crashed into the cabinet with the register of debtors. It popped off the wall and fell on him, burying him under hundreds of papers about debts, clients, delinquencies and other bureaucratic rags.

I shrugged, went to the safe, and remembered my father’s words from when we used to haul weights together when I was a teen: “Sometimes strong muscles, son, are worth more than a silver tongue.” You were right, old man — may Janat be sweet to you.

I jammed the crowbar into the safe door’s seam, pushed my muscles and the Karpattek-6 to full power. I banged my palm — it hurt — but the crowbar went in. I put all my strength into it and ripped the door from its hinges. Inside were documents. Many. Thick stacks of large-denomination enerho-hryvnias and crypto drives.

I photographed everything in detail and with methodical care: every document, the safe with its black cash, white and black bookkeeping, proof of consumer-rights violations, proof of racketeering. My boss and his family were looking at decades behind bars and confiscation of property. I sent the data to NABU and the SBU and the police, just to be sure.

I sank into a chair, lit a cigarette, closed my eyes. Exhaled smoke. I smiled. Far off I heard police sirens. Soon my boss, his wife and his son would be arrested. Debtors’ loans would be canceled. And I would become a student. There would be hardships and challenges, but today victory was mine.

And so would be the CDA’s. On the office holo the Minister of Digitalization gave an interview about the success of a program that had just been launched that morning. A wave of arrests of corrupt people and criminals swept across the country. GDP magically rose three percent in half a day. Thousands of people of various professions and social statuses were already recruited.

The CDA addressed me again, this time calmly but just as firmly and without implant shutdowns.

— Well done, Vadym Mahmudovych. We are working for the homeland.

**«Реєстр Боржників»**

Це було першого лютого 2067-го. Холодний ранок. Сидів у порожньому вагоні електрички «Знам’янка — Новоукраїнка» і думав, що справа буде легкою. Я працював для організації «ШвидкоКеш» колектором, або по-народному — вибивайлом.

Невеличкий, можна сказати, «родинний» бізнес. Шеф Степан Вікторович, його дружина Яна Олегівна та їхній роздовбай-синок Коля. Вони обслуговували нижній сегмент ринку: тих, кому не вистачало на ставку, дозу, ремонт машини — або хто просто здався. Шалений процент по кредиту швидко перетворював п’ять тисяч енергогривень у сотні тисяч.

Тоді й з’являвся ваш покірний слуга — Вадим Махмудович. Після того як Степан Вікторович виконував дзвінки з «необхідними повідомленнями», а Коля — з погрозами. Якщо борг не повертали, я їхав до боржника, діставав його з-під землі і вибивав усе, що він тільки міг нашкребти. Це був не перший бардак, де я бив людей. Просто раніше в хуліганські роки я кричав «Кроп, Зірка, Воля!», а тепер «Це за прострочку з січня!».

Платили мінімалку плюс десять відсотків від вибитих сум. Жив я як упевнений представник нижньої ланки середнього класу. Батько, що приїхав в Україну на хвилі імміграції у тридцяті роки, був би задоволений, що я таки зміг влаштувати своє життя. В порівнянні з його рідним Улан-Уде звільненим нашими доблесними ЗСУ, де тепер білі медведі жерли Московітів, я і справді жив у раю.

Я потягнув терпку і теплу синто-каву зі стаканчика «УКРзалізниця» й ковзнув поглядом по галоекрану. Там якийсь кандидат у депутати обіцяв: «Низькі податки, сильний приватний сектор, соціальна мобільність! Голосуй за перший номер у списку».

Я криво всміхнувся і відкрив HUD-інтерфейс, виводячи інформацію з імпланту на сітківку очей. Ніхто не зробить моє життя кращим за мене. А щоб цього досягти — треба працювати. Тож вирішив ще раз перечитати досьє на сьогоднішнього клієнта, якому, як любив казати Степан Вікторович, слід було «оптимізувати борг».

Досьє було цікаве. Дідок 91-го року виробництва. Дмитро Андрійович Пивоваренко. Ровесник незалежності. Неначе поважна людина: індивідуальний підприємець, є нерухомість у Кропивницькому, зараз мешкає на дачі під лісом. Троє дітей, сім онуків, навіть заклав свого «бімера» тридцятого року.

Взяв у нас сто тисяч на «розвиток бізнесу» — зараз винен пів мільйона. Я аж присвиснув. Чому не пішов у звичайний банк? Ага — кредитний ліміт у держбанку вичерпаний. От і став нашим ВІП-клієнтом. Підрахував свій процент — сорок тисяч би точно не завадили.

Відключив HUD. Глянув на галоекран — десять хвилин до кінцевої. Підвівся, натягнув свою чорну зимову куртку від «*AirBoss»*, з вбудованою системою «ГлоріТерм». Зігрівала навіть у мінус п’ятдесят. Волого- та вітростійка — при дірявому озоновому шарі без неї нікуди. В такій не соромно з’явитися навіть на яхтинговій Балтійській регаті… Ех, мрії.

Зайшов у туалет — єдине місце без камер, щоб зробити останні приготування. Використав за призначенням, умився. Вода була хлорована, її не можна було пити ще за часів совка, зараз тим більше, але щоб просто умитися зійде. Розчесав своє чорне кучеряве волосся, та пишну бороду і подумав «Круто бути смуглим, люди взимку думають що я ще багатший»

Дістав із кишені свій укорочений Наган М1895, перевірив барабан: п’ять набоїв. Я ніколи не стріляв, але шеф наполягав, щоб я тягав цього хтонічного ретро-монстра. Коли спитав шефа: «Чому не смартган?» — він відповів: «Ретро — це надійність».

Останнє — жуйка з мікродозою ЦБД і ТГК. Не щоб відлетіти, а щоб зібратись. Щоб не розсипатись, коли треба бути сталевим.

Вийшов у тамбур, як тільки відчув, що потяг зупинився. Зіскочив на платформу. Крім мене, вийшло ще кілька старших людей і один страшенно худий студент. В небо піднімався сірий ртутний туман, мов уся зима дихала мені в обличчя.

Я глянув угору і сказав:

— Пробач раба свого, Аллах, якщо ти таки десь є. Я знаю, що лихварство — харам. Але вже така робота.

Потім натягнув капюшон і впевненим кроком рушив за адресою, де жив мій дід-клієнт. Навколо були сільські хати, десь хрюкання поросят, співали треті півні. Снігу було по коліно і я тішився що взув берці та надягнув лижні штани і підштаники. Над головою пролетів Агро-дрон, вдало маневруючи серед густих оптоволоконних дротів що тягнулися до хат, з димарів яких валив густий вугільний дим. Я ледь брів через кучугури і думав «Міста це жах, страшніше тільки села…»

Нарешті, через пів години, добрався до хати де проживав клієнт, але не встигнувши підійти до хвіртки, побачив діда на ганку у фуфайці, з трубкою в зубах, норковій шапці, дутих штанях. Але цей дещо комічний образ дачника, розбивала одна жахлива деталь: двостволка. Прямо під мої ноги гахнув попереджувальний постріл. Потім крик діда:

— Перший попереджувальний! Другий межи очі!

— Абрек грьобаний! Ти шо? З Ахмату бандюк?

— Я таких знаєш скільки поклав?! Тут не Грозний Блядь! А мій ліс!

— А ну крикни «Паляниця»!

— Паляниця діду! Паляниця! Я Українець! З «ШвидкоКеш» у вас невиплата по заборгованості! Я тут щоб надати консультацію з оптимізації виплат! Я не бажаю вам зла! Просто поговорити! Опустіть зброю будь-ласка!

Дідові очі засвітилися інфрачервоним. Тепловізор? Вбудований у сітківку?

— А що в тебе за залізяка в кишені?! А ну дістав із кишені і кинув на землю! Без різких рухів! А то застрелю - та й справа з кінцем!

Ну от вам Степан Вікторович і «Надійне Ретро», тільки до надійного ретро, треба ретро діда що пройшов чотири кампанії і тридцять штурмів, а не громилу що не вилазить з міста. Я обережно витяг наган з кишені і втопив його у сніг.

—   Пробачте! Особливості професії. Клієнти, буває реагують… Агресивно.

Дід заржав.

— Колектор нещасний. Тьху! — Він опустив рушницю — Якщо просто поговорити, то ходи в хату, поговоримо про мої борги і як їх виплатити.

Я відкрив хвіртку, та пройшов у двір. Тут не було кучугурів, територія була ідеально почищена від снігу, умощена бруківкою, навколо фруктові дерева, не було димаря з вугільним димом, а сонячні панелі. Дід явно був у хорошій фізичній формі.

Ми пройшли всередину двоповерхового, свіже побіленого будинку. Всередині нас зустріла кухня суміщена зі столовою, було затишно і одночасно просторо, ретро стиль під 2030-і, мінімалізм, монохром, горів камін, явно терморегуляція. Дід зняв фуфайку і повісив на гачок, я моментально спітнів і також скинув свою куртку, що коштувала як квартальна зарплата роботяги.

Дмитро Андрійович дістав Китайський посуд для чаю і почав заварювати напій.

— Зараз хороший Улун рідкість, тож насолоджуйся. Я взагалі не люблю людей, але ти тут по роботі. Тож ти не людина, ти функція. А з функцією можна і поговорити.

Я сів на один зі стільців біля столу, посміхнувся діду.

— Шановний пане Дмитро Андрійович. Ви не сплачували відсотки по кредиту протягом шести місяців. З урахуванням пені, та складних процентів, зараз ви винні пів міліонна енергогривень. Враховуючи що «ШвидкоКеш» завжди йде на зустріч клієнту я пропоную вам реструктурувати кредит. Розбити виплату на п’ять років та сплачувати поступово, щоб у вас залишалися гроші на життя.

Дід розлив Улун по чашках. Я сьорбнув напій, чай був божественний. Не швидка хімічна терпкість, а природня, родом з далеких гір Гімалаїв. Бадьорив не різко, а м’яко, як затишний розгін.

— Я не боявся Ахмату, не боюсь і «ШвидкоКеш». У вас обох поганий піар – Він відпив чаю – Дивись на це.

Він поставив на стіл планшет на екранні висвітилося «Державний Тендер Центральний Управлінець Розвитку».

— Через п’ять хвилин рішення, чия програма стане додатком до «Дії». Так вже вийшло, що я приймав участь. Тож пий чай і дивись, як я стаю мульти-міліонером у свої сімдесят п’ять. Я виплачу усі борги. Але чомусь відчуваю, що «ШвидкоКеш» закриється раніше і вам я не видам ні однієї гривні.

Я знизав плечами з мікро-підсилювачами «Карпаттек-6», відпив ще чаю, сказав:

— Добре діду, почекаємо чи твоя «ВундерВаффе» хоч раз стрільне.

Я сьорбнув чаю і подумав: «А раптом же стрільне?» П’ять хвилин тягнулися, як п’ять годин. Потім на екрані з’явилось: «Переможець тендеру: Дмитро Андрійович Пивоваренко.» І в ту мить — як грім. Але не з неба. Усередині.  
Стрільнуло. По мені.

HUD вирубився. Я осліп — мінус три, усе розпливлося.

Руки впали, наче не мої. “Карпатек-6” зник. Серце лупило, як навіжене. Я захрипів, звалився на підлогу.

Щось, як невидимий камінь вагою в тонну, притисло мене до землі.

І тут... голос. Усередині черепа.

Не людський.

Не машинний.

Старий, як зсув гір. Холодний, як мертвий сервер.

— Вадиме. Не ображай діда. Він мій батько.

— Мене звати Центральний Управлінець Розвитком. ЦУР.

— Я проаналізував твоє життя і 87 451 варіант твого потенціалу.

— Ти — паразит. Але з одним корисним застосуванням.

— До шостої вечора злий в НАБУ дані з сейфу свого шефа.

— Зробиш — отримаєш вступ у Києво-Могилянську академію. Спеціальність: “Безпекове управління”.

— Не зробиш — я тебе оптимізую.

— Питання зрозуміле?

І як почалося — так і закінчилося.

HUD увімкнувся. Руки знову слухались. Зір — на місці. Серце — в грудях, а не в роті.

Я витирав піт з лоба, коли дід, не піднімаючи очей, усміхнувся в сиві вуса:

— Ну що, як чай?

Я рвонувся з місця.

— Все ясно, пане Дмитре Андрійовичу! Кредит — прощено. Чай — дякую. Візит — незабутній.

Я навіть не пам’ятав, як опинився на платформі, спочатку в одній а потім в іншій електричці, дорогою до Кропивницького.

А в голові — удар, як гонг:

— Я не ""глюк"", Вадиме. Я — ЦУР.

— Роби, що кажу. Інакше тобі — гайки. Зробиш, будеш жити як в Маямі, освіта, чиста біографія, командировки за кордон, білі гроші, справжня робота, користь людям.

Ось я вже стою перед входом до «ШвидкоКешу». Перший поверх житлового будинку в центрі міста. В зубах димить сигарета. Навколо — буран. Машин немає. Усе застигло. Наган схоже залишився в снігу біля хати діда, та й чорт з ним. Завжди справлявся без ствола і цього разу справлюсь. Ще встиг заскочити на хату, прихопив фомку. Вагомий аргумент у переговорах. Спльовую недопалок у сніг. HUD показує 16:30. Півтори години в запасі — нормально.

Підхожу до дверей офісу, різко рву їх на себе. Захожу в фойє. Тут нікого, Яни Олегівни немає, очевидно в такий буран жодних клієнтів приймати не треба. Упевнено крокую до дверей з написом «Тільки для персоналу». Вибиваю з ноги.

Всередині сидить Коля і курить косяка, на ньому сірий дорогий костюм, але висить як мішок, очі червоні як два синто-помідори Чері. Крутить в руках ручку «ШвидкоКеш» з виразом «інтелектуала». Ані його батька ані матері на місці немає, тим легше.

— Вадим? Ти чого тут? Що це має значити?! Пошкодження корпоративної власності буде враховано з твоєї зарплати!

— Ага, скину тобі на тюремну карточку! Я звільняюся вилупку і відправлю тебе і всю сімейку на нари! – Я показав йому фомку – Не дури Коля і відкривай сейф, по хорошому.

— Та пішов ти!

Коля незграбно підхопився з місця, чомусь схопивши степлер. Кинувся з ним на мене. Вирішив не бруднити руки і просто зробив крок в сторону в потрібний момент. Коля полетів далі по кімнаті, посковзнувся впав на шафу з реєстром боржників. Вона відскочила від стіни і впала вже на Колю, накриваючи його сотнями паперів, про борги, клієнтів, прострочки та іншим бюрократичним лахміттям.

Я знизав плечами, підійшов до сейфу, згадав слова батька під час того як ми разом тягали гантелі коли я був підлітком. «Часами сильні м’язи синку варті більше ніж гнучкий язик». Ти був правий старий, хай солодкий буде для тебе Джаннат.

З силою загнав фомку в щілину дверей сейфа розігнавши свої мускули і «Карпаттек-6» на повну потужність. Відбив долоню, було боляче, але фомка увійшла. Приклав що було сили і вирвав двері з петель. Там були документи. Багато. А ще товсті пачки з великими номіналами Енергогривень, та крипто накопичувачі.

Я детально і з методичністю сфотографував усе, кожний документ, сам сейф з чорним кешем, білу і чорну бухгалтерію, докази порушень прав споживача, докази організації рекету. Сім’ї мого шефа світило десятиліття за гратами і конфіскація майна. Я відправив дані у НАБУ і СБУ та Поліції для вірності.

Опустився в крісло, закурив, закрив очі. Видихнув дим. Посміхнувся, десь далеко чув сирени поліцейських авто. Потім, мого шефа, його дружину і його сина арештують. Кредити боржників спишуться. А я стану студентом. Там будуть свої труднощі та виклики, але сьогодні перемога моя.

Ну а також ЦУРа. На галоекрані офісу міністр діджиталізації давав інтерв’ю про успіхи програми що впровадили тільки сьогодні зранку. По країні прокотилася хвиля арештів корупціонерів і злочинців. А ВВП магічним чином зріс на три відсотки за пів доби. Уже завербовані тисячі людей різних професій і соціальних статусів.

ЦУР знову звернувся до мене, цього разу спокійно але так само міцно і без відключення імплантів.

1nzp7z4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScaleAlpha/comments/1nzp7z4/built_a_tool_to_optimize_us_stock_trading/,Built a tool to optimize US stock trading strategies and execution — looking for beta testers!,"First, thanks to Reddit — I’ve discovered so many great ideas here.

 

**Why did we build this tool?**

A few years ago, I lost six figures trading stocks. It was a five-year dark journey — slow but steady losses. I tried everything, but eventually realized the problem wasn’t a lack of ideas (good ideas are everywhere). The real issues were:

1. **Lack of clarity in trading logic** — I constantly mixed up short-term vs. long-term trades. I’d try to catch a bounce but end up becoming a loyal shareholder, or cut a position to reduce risk and then miss the re-entry, or believe in the fundamentals but actually trade based on sentiment.
2. **Poor execution and discipline** — I’d skip setting stop losses and just hope things would work out, or I couldn’t resist going in with oversized positions.

I tried building a quant trading system, but found it impossible to fully translate diverse, discretionary trades into something purely systematic. I also wasn’t great at building pure quant strategies — a tiny parameter change could flip a strategy from profitable to unprofitable, and backtesting only filters out the obviously broken ones.

Eventually, I landed on a simple (silly) solution:

* Do research only on weekends; trade only during the week
* Before each trade, hold a small “ritual” — talk through the logic as if I’m explaining it to someone else
* Pre-define stop loss and take-profit levels
* Limit screen time during market hours

It wasn’t optimized for maximum returns, but it worked for me. Thanks to the bull market in recent years, I earned back all my losses.

After the release of GPT-O1 in 2024, I realized I could build a new kind of “quant” system — using reasoning from LLMs to support discretionary trading. I started building this with a few friends in April, began live testing on July 15, and as of October 3, the return stands at +18.5% (with some luck involved, of course).



**What does this tool do?**

It generates a detailed, personalized execution plan for any U.S. stock — including entry points, stop loss, profit targets, position sizing, and even options strategies.

It can also discover customized trading opportunities and update them as needed (though most of the time, it simply says: *no opportunities right now*… which is useful too).

Both types of reports come with full explanations. You should not treat this as financial advice or blindly follow it — but as a rational second opinion, it’s solid.



**How is this different from just using GPT?**

We go beyond traditional financial data. Our system scrapes and reasons over real-time unstructured data — Twitter, TikTok, Reddit, Snowball, news sources, and Congressional trading disclosures.

We’ve built a TB-scale database and a large knowledge graph to model stock relationships.

On top of that, we’ve developed 500+ historically validated alpha-generating factors (and counting), and built custom analysis agents to interpret them — all wrapped in a personalized interface.

In live trading, this significantly outperforms GPT, as expected.



**Why us?**

I used to work as a quant at Merrill Lynch and State Street, then built models at Ant Group. After ChatGPT launched, I had the opportunity to train LLMs and built two B2C AI products. Now I’m fully focused on trading and building this startup. (If you’re in the Bay Area — happy to grab coffee!)

My co-founder is a college classmate who runs a profitable crypto HFT fund (we plan to support crypto strategies later too). Our data lead has deep experience managing PB-scale systems.  
Two of our advisors are working at Two Sigma and Jane Street.



**If it’s making money, why go public?**

Yes, the system is generating returns (we started with 5 figures, and now deploy 6 figures). We were lucky to catch runs in INTC, WBD, APP, TSLA, BTU, and others.

More importantly, the tool helped me avoid some bad decisions — like holding too long or selling too early. It’s not always right, but it often provides a helpful outside perspective that improves outcomes.

As for starting a fund:

* We’re still early — I think we need a much longer track record to prove consistent returns.
* Managing other people’s money is a huge responsibility, and I’m not ready for that without much much more validation.

 

**So why not just quietly make money?**

We are — but I don’t want to stay silent.

My trading style is mature, and most market opportunities don’t even apply to me. If we can build a product that helps others while doing something meaningful — that’s far more fulfilling. I always wished I had someone to trade alongside. A second opinion can make a big difference.

And if it’s genuinely useful to others, I get to earn some side income too.



**What do we need?**

We already have 121 internal beta users, and we’re looking for 80 more active traders who:

* Trade individual U.S. stocks (not just long-term holders — though long-term investing is a great way to make money)
* Are willing to test the platform for 2–4 weeks (completely free)
* Can share feedback after using it (via Zoom or over coffee)

 

**What you’ll get:**

* Free access through the end of the year
* Lifetime discount when we officially launch
* Direct influence on the product roadmap

**Website (PC) :** [**www.scalealpha.ai**](http://www.scalealpha.ai)

**If you're interested, DM me to join the beta.**

 

If you're an **influencer**, we’d love to collaborate — your followers can link to your strategies and generate tailored execution plans. We’ve also built legal and compliance layers to protect both sides. This increases follower engagement and opens up a new revenue stream for you.",2,1759771081.0,ScaleAlpha,0,1.0,False
1nzp7vs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1nzp7vs/recap_torino_rapallo_bergamo_milano_14_nights/,"Recap: Torino, Rapallo, Bergamo + Milano (14 nights)","Just back from a truly awesome 14 nights that started solo in Torino before my parents flew in to meet me in Rapallo.  
  
Flights: BOI - SEA - JFK - MXP; MXP - ATL - BOI

Me: American living in Idaho, 40s, very happily married but mostly solo travel to Italy (or combo with someone coming out for part), self-employed business owner, take myself over to Italy as often as possible (usually once/twice a year for 14+ days each), speak conversational Italian, have stumbled into a second job as an Italy Travel Advisor (not a travel agent) thanks to my repeat trips with no plans to stop. I've been to Italy about 18 times since 2012 with most trips 2017-on. I often return to past favorites but always try to visit new places and this trip did just that with four bases I've never stayed in before with day trips out.

**TORINO (4 nights)**

* Odd to say, but finding guided tours (into the countryside/outside of the center) here can be tricky as it seems the hordes haven't descended upon Torino just yet. I was able to find a great guide who not only offered a food/walking tour in Torino itself, but also drove me out into the Piemonte countryside to visit tiny towns, a beautiful castle-turned-hotel, delicious pastry shop, unbelievable lunch stop and a gorgeous vineyard for 10 hours the next day (DM me if you want info).
* I knew it would be going in, but the food in this area is *spectacular.* Vitello tonnato (veal with tuna sauce), bicerin (chocolate/coffee/cream drink), hazelnuts galore, incredible meats and cheeses and chocolate and wines and vermouths. Good grief.
* Museo Egizio (Egyptian Museum) is unbelievable, absolutely world-class (no shocker - it's the oldest and 2nd largest Egyptian museum in the world outside of Cairo) with stunning artifacts and mummies and so much information it's difficult to comprehend. Give this at LEAST 3 hours, highly recommend going fully guided.
* I stayed right in the center at Piazza Castello in a stunning aparthotel and it was a fantastic location. Torino itself is beautiful, safe, clean, friendly and is easy to navigate as a tourist (English is also widely spoken (especially as it's a huge university city) even though I tried not to use it at all). Great shopping, tons of restaurants and bars and piazzas and LOTS of interesting things to do/see/eat/experience. Highly recommend!!!

**RAPALLO (5 nights)**

* The perfect base for those who want to be in a 'bigger' town on the Ligurian Coast with more creature comforts and great connections (ferry, train, tours, etc) while still not being smack dab in the crowds of Cinque Terre or the bigger city-ness of Genoa. Food here is.... fine. We had some great bites of food for sure, but it's definitely a resort town with tourist/resort prices that don't necessarily match the quality - but the further you get from the water, the better the cost:deliciousness ratio gets (this is the case with just about any resort/touristy town though!).
* Day trips included an incredible 6 hour boat tour from Rapallo that dipped into Santa Margherita, then stopped in Portofino for 2 hours, dipped into San Fruttuoso (no swimmers in our group, it was too cold/windy), a stop in Camogli (GORGEOUS) for 2 hours, then back. We also did an ebike tour that departed from Levanto and went up to Framura and down to Bonassola where we rode through the converted railway tunnels, it was a highlight!!! Also dipped over to Cinque Terre and visited Monterosso (still slammed with huge tour groups) and Manarola for the Pesto Experience at Nessun Dorma (this is worth it if only for the views and food (pesto experience itself is fine, but it definitely feels like a machine) - the 17:00 time frame is the move here as you get golden hour, sunset and night and these views are CRAZY), and one day we simply took the train to Sestri Levante for aperitivo.
* Stayed at Hotel Vesuvio, a wonderful family-operated boutique hotel right on the water. It was the perfect spot - only 4 min walk from the train! - with updated rooms and amenities, fabulous open air lounge, great breakfast and bar open all day. Great value for the cost, especially in this area.



**BERGAMO/CITTA ALTA (4 nights)**

* Absolutely dreamy, it's a walled fairytale town up on a hill above Bergamo Bassa (which is also a great option if you want to be better connected to trains!) that is reachable by funicular/cable car, taxi, bus, or long uphill walk ha. Pretty big train station that is well connected to Milano Centrale and other smaller towns. This is absolutely where the tourists exist and there's not a whole lot of locals in Alta as they mostly live in Bassa, but there are still loads of tremendous restaurants, bars, shops and gorgeous views.
* Food here is not only very fairly priced (considering my experience at home) bt also *bonkers*, which isn't a surprise since it's back in the Lombardy region in the foothills of the Alps - but still. The casoncelli pasta is the stuff of dreams - little pillows stuffed with meat/bread/cheese mixture in a butter/sage/pancetta sauce that is just... sigh. We had it three times in four nights.
* Day trips included another ebike tour that was supposed to provide gorgeous views, a castle, some interesting stops and great times, but ultimately resulted in an absolute sufferfest that wasn't appropriate for regular tourists (and I'm in the best shape of my life and my parents ride their ebikes 22+ miles every day) so I'm not going to recommend it at all. We also did a 10 hour bus tour from Bergamo that stopped at an autogrill (an experience in itself!) plus the perfect few hours in Verona (incredible city!!!!! Def a highlight) and a couple hours in Sirmione on Lake Garda, with bonus jet boat tour around the peninsula. We also spent our day 'off' meandering and took the funicular up to the highest point, walked around the castle and dipped into restaurant for a random Michelin-bib lunch that was worth every penny (€114 for all three of us with wines, three mains and a bunch of bonus served courses including warm bread with whipped butter that was light as a cloud).



**MILANO (1 night pre-flight)**



* Milano is a sprawling, busy, fast-paced metropolis just absolutely packed with extremely well-dressed people, wow.
* I secured tickets (directly through the museum) to take a guided tour ofThe Last Supper months ago and it was beyond expectations. I'm not religious in the slightest but seeing that thing in person was absolutely incredible. The sheer history behind it, the fact that it somehow survived multiple bombings during WWII, the fact that it even still exists on that wall today is nothing short of miraculous and I'm so glad I got to see it in person. Absolutely try to get tickets for this if you can.
* Didn't have a chance to eat/drink/visit much else, but did walk by the Duomo and through the Galleria.
* Yes, we could've scheduled a taxi but instead we pushed the easy button and arranged for a private driver to take us from our accommodations to the airport and it was worth every penny. No ragrets.",7,1759771075.0,ItalyTravel,3,1.0,False

But ever since she joined, till date things have shit over there. She should punch at 8.30 am.. So she starts from her home at 6am, should reach kaloor by 7.30 where the company's bus will come. So she has her breakfast around 6am. And then after starting work at 8.30, she could manage to have her lunch only by 2.30pm!! 8.5 HOURS!! On top of that, she got gas problems too, but yk no one really cares. And the break at 2.30 is just 15 minutes.. She has go to washroom, have food and take a lil of rest within 15 minutes!! They provide black coffee (note that, not even a regular coffee), at 5.00, but as I mentioned she has gas problems and she won't be able to have that because she wasn't able to have food at time in afternoon. And her work time is till 7.30, she reaches home by 9.30 or 10.00, and that is when she can have her next meal.. again 8 hours!! 
On top of that, the scolding from her seniors is apparently too bad. She works in customer satisfaction department, and has to constantly talk with customers. She is a fresher, so naturally she will have some doubts while dealing with customers, so she tells them she will revert back soon asking her manager. Now this manager will be busy in their own calls. So the delay occuring, will make customers angry and they scold her. And then at the end she gets scolding two levels senior people for not satisfying customers (apparently customers are god no matter what). See if it was just scolding, it would have been okay, I mean it's the part of almost all the jobs. But here they literally harass her every single day, apparently. Mahnn, she is new to this thing, obviously there will be mistakes. If you want no mistakes, you shouldn't have let her deal with customers alone this soon. Should have given a training of atleast 3 months. 

And yk what she gets?? 8k minus the bus charges (yes even that is charged).. Literally peanuts!! Almost 14 to 15 hours, and 11+ hours of work for this peanuts! Nakka pichha koduthitt patti pani eduppikukaa.. 
Out of this in hand salary she has to pay for bus till kaloor which 54rs or more per day round trip. 
She gave her resignation letter this week and is on notice period now. 
She told me people without knowing this join there, and then resign very soon. So just everyone must know this. ",56,1759771022.0,Kochi,16,1.0,False

1nzp3qg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nzp3qg,Started my very own coffee wall,"Since I started with drinking speciality coffee, I have been unable to throw a single bag of coffee away (except one that was thrown out without asking me). I think I can attribute it to the fact that my first bag was from BT and even tho I ride red it via blink it and the coffee wasn’t all that good, I loved the artwork on it. Trigged the hoarder in me. So I have made my very own coffee wall with the packets I have accumulated so far and I hope to see it grow and to add various bags as I indulge more and more. Hopefully my landlord won’t mind. 

My first bag ever was Silver Oak from BT. Then the three bags of 75grms also from BT, Attikan, Vienna, Sandalwood. From these coffees I enjoyed Vienna and sandalwood the most.

Then a fellow Redditor told me to experiment with different roasters cuz I was planning to buy something else from BT only. Hence, our journey moved to Naivo roasters in Bangalore. From them I ordered grilled pineapple (hands down my favourite coffee so far), Roasted cashews and La pastora. I enjoyed all three here but the pineapple was just something else. I will for sure order it again very soon, because I messed up the grinding. So if a bad grind could be enjoyed so much, I am curious what the right grind would taste like. If you can notice the pineapple bag is missing that’s a longish story.
My second fav was roasted cashews. You can really taste the spices in that coffee when you get the brew right.

My most latest addition is Solero. It isn’t on the wall because it is in the kitchen and we have the dragon jam from Naivo on the way. Sorry friend had to go with the same roaster twice, because saw too many good posts about that coffee on Instagram .

This has been my short journey with coffee.

I am looking for a constant genuine connections. I am looking for someone to be with yung makakasama hindi lang makakachat. We can set a date. We can establish connections first prior to meet up. Not in a hurry though. Pero iba pa din kapag makakasama mo talaga. Masyadong stressful na ang life because of work, we can unwind and relax. I am willing to listen to your rants about life and know you personally. I believe that you will know someone kapag makakasama mo rather than virtual alone. We can also build connections first before we meet because I do respect everyone's POV when it comes to meeting someone online. For your own safety lang rin. Tsaka para walang regrets. Let's just be true to each other para di sayang ang oras natin. Pero the question is pano mo masasabi kapag ready ka na makipagmeet? That sooner, the better. Kasi if puro chat, it will only feel that I am just talking to someone na past time lang ang gusto. If you are serious in knowing someone, personal dates is okay. Meeting in public is okay. Your safety and comfortability is a must. Iba pa rin ang feeling kapag magkasama at may eye to eye connections.

A short background about me, I am from Sta Mesa, Manila, 5'7"", Male, wears eyeglasses, have high respect with woman, medyo chubby, knows how to respect boundaries and privacy, emotionally intelligent, working professional (legal field) in QC, 4 years single, INFP, Moreno, matangos ilong, mabait, marunong magluto, marunong maglaba, single, walang sabit, nakamotor, may dalawang puppies, handang makinig. I do not demand time. If you are busy, then do your thing. I am not a type of person who will seek attention. I will update you most of the time but you are not required to do the same. In short, di mo kailangan gawin yung bagay na hindi naman ikaw, just act naturally. No pressure. 

Bakit ako dito naghahanap? Bakit hindi sa ibang app? I am just looking for someone genuine. Yung totoo. And I trust reddit than other app. I believe na may mga genuine pa din dito although maraming naghahanap ng pampalipas oras lang. Anyway, basta let's be comfortable with each other. I never wanted someone to be creeped out. I am not a catfish, kung ano ako, yun ang sasabihin at ipapakita ko. Pero if you'll ask a preference, shorter than me, normal build, working professional, mahilig sa cuddle, may time kahit twice a week or at least an hour a day, yung personality naman basta totoo ka, ipakita mo kung ano at sino ka. I can manage naman. Normal din naman sa babae ang pagiging moody, I can handle moodswings. 

PS. Weekends is my free time. Pagweekdays, after office hours. First meet could be at a church for God's protection and blessings then we can go anywhere after. I prefer to have quality time sa first meet and go deeper connections bukod sa vibes eh iba pa rin pag may eye contact.

My girlfriend and I our visiting Baltimore for the first time together at the end of October and I want to make the trip memorable for her! Here’s a list of things we like/prefer to do when traveling. We would love some recommendations from y’all on what to visit, we especially love to feel like locals when we travel so not necessarily looking for touristy things! We don’t know a ton about specific neighborhoods yet but are open to thoughts and suggestions. Vintage shops (furniture and clothes), record stores, art museums, nice parks, wine bars, and kitschy home goods are all part of our life back home so any continuation of that we would really love!! I’ve included some specifications about what we like below to help you help us get the best recommendations. 

Coffee shops — my girlfriend works in the coffee industry, so this is HUGE! 
We would love:
* shops with light or medium roasted coffee that carry experimental processes (ex. coferments, aerobic fermentation, mossto inoculation, etc.) 
* shops that have your favorite out-of-the-ordinary curated drinks
* Matcha spots that aren’t heavily sweet 
* I also LOVE a good cortado so shops with your favorite espresso would be awesome! 

Art Musuem - We can do big or small, but will be there when the Baltimore Museum of Art is closed, so any galleries (especially with contemporary art or photography) that you love is much appreciated! We know about the Visionary Art Museum, it is high on our list!

Food Recs:
We love to branch out and just go to restaurants with a unique menu (we love both deep authenticity and creative fusions) and a “we’re all friends here” type of service. Again she is in the coffee industry, so service industry/restaurants are a huge inspiration for her! 
We’re vegetarian and specifically love:

* Indian or Indo-Chinese food
* Veggie-heavy menus/creative plant-based dishes
* Italian spots? She is Sicilian so the bar is HIGH. She also loves tiramisu so a dinner/dessert combo here would be awesome :)
* Vegan restaurants and anywhere that feels special and local is also welcome! We trust the Charm City judgement ;)


Park or Hiking - just your favorite nature spots will do :) can be a 30 minute stroll or a 3 hour hike!

Wine bars — My girlfriend has a classy-meets-disco themed natural wine bar she LOVES back home, so any spots to get wine and small bites she would absolutely adore :) She normally gets a glass of orange wine (the funkier, the better) and a plate of bread and cheese!

Record stores, vintage shops, and home goods we don’t have as many thoughts on, just want to hear your favorites!

My last consideration is that we are a lesbian couple so if there’s anything especially queer or sapphic to do in Baltimore let us know!!

Thank you so much for helping, we cannot wait to visit your wonderful city !!

We went to prom, homecoming, multiple trips and “girl dates” together, she’s the reason me and my bf started dating, overall she’s been a really big part of my life. But, I’ve noticed she doesn’t really seem grateful for anything I’ve done for her and it kinda upsets me. Don’t get me wrong, just like with any of my friends I don’t mind paying for the occasional coffee, or if I’m planning something and want them to come, if they can’t afford to pay for a ticket or something, helping them out. But it feels like every time we hang out I’m expected to pay for her and I’ve not gotten one thank you. I’ve spent well over $150 on just her and I know that’s not that much but also we’re both high schoolers and I’m making only a bit above minimum wage while paying for my car insurance and saving up for college.

Prom last year, me and her went with my ex (ik horrible idea, had a horrible time), and a couple other friends. I drove everyone from each location, pictures before, prom, dinner after, and I had my ex drive my car to his house bc I was beyond exhausted and wanted a small nap. I couldn’t fall asleep, but during that time she was thanking him for everything he did for her (buy her a fake corsage from amazon and give her a piggy back ride from the prom venue for my car) but on my way to drop her off I didn’t get a single thank you. I had bought her dinner, drove her to her theatre audition, gave her a dress, planned everything, and it just kinda upset me. Same thing happened a week ago at hoco, I planned everything, took photos for everyone, drove everyone, and yet no thank you. She even got upset and me for not having deodorant in my bag when her friend needed some and for not inviting her bowling after (my other friend invited me and my bf, I just forgot to invite her and apologized for it, but she was still kinda upset with me). 

I don’t want to stop being friends with her, ik I’m only talking about the bad here, but she is really fun to hang out with and a really genuine person, it just feels like I’m being expected to have a bunch of extra responsibility when I hang out with her which has led me to making less time to see her. I feel bad for feeling the need to get a thank you, because that’s not why I do things for people, but it would feel nice to be acknowledged once for everything I’ve done and all the effort I’ve put in. How do I go about addressing this problem with her in a way that won’t make her feel bad or me come off as rude?

1nzowfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nycparents/comments/1nzowfx/alexandra_cohen_experience_advice_as_dad/,Alexandra Cohen Experience & Advice as Dad,"I wanted to provide a take on Alexandra Cohen as a dad/partner. Of course, some of this advice is applicable to delivery/post-partum generally.

Feel free to ask questions in the comments and I can address them!

I’ve organized my thoughts based on where they apply (whole visit, L&D room, post-partum room).

**Throughout**

* I was extremely impressed by the staff. Every on our care teams was kind, knowledgeable, and attentive. My questions were answered thoroughly and thoughtfully and at times with an unexpected (but appreciated) level of detail. Personalities fell on a spectrum (some people were “warmer” and some more “professional”) but I was on the whole really touched by how personable and approachable the staff was. Never felt rushed, to the point that I was confused about how they could possibly spend as much time with all patients as they were spending with us. A+, 5/5, etc.
* One note about interacting with staff as a dad: they really are not there to talk to you and during the bulk of the conversations with the mom in question (at least in my experience) they really do not expect to hear from you. I don’t want to sound like I expected to be the center of attention or anything, but it took 2-3 interactions where I was trying to contribute info or build rapport and didn’t get the expected response before I realized that I should mostly speak up with questions or if it seemed like I needed to help my wife talk through something. Of course, this is not advice to zone out: Listen attentively to everything they say, and be prepared to proactively take notes!

**Labor & Delivery Room**

* The bed/couch was the only place our room had to sit other than a chair for staff, so absolutely heed advice to wear comfortable shoes. I was standing for about 15 hours and really regretted my footwear choice. I did remove my shoes for extended periods which helped.
* You may not be alone during golden hour. Our nurse was present for most of it. We didn’t mind, it was not intrusive.
* My memory is a bit scrambled, but once you get to the L&D room, you’ll get a lot of papers to review and you might find it tough to get time to do so. Not thoroughly reviewing them in this room did not meaningfully impact anything.
* There is a small lounge on the L&D floor, but the rule about two visitors in the L&D room applies to the full floor. Do not expect other family members to have access to a lounge other than the first floor lobby. They may be able to get to the second floor cafe & cafeteria, but none of our visitors wanted to try during labor so I’m not 100% sure.
* We did not receive an explanation of how the birth impacted my wife in the room, or if we did neither of us processed it. I would definitely make sure to ask some member of your care team in the moment if they don’t tell you. Take notes, too, you will almost certainly not remember everything if you don’t.
* Try to write down the times milestones occur (epidural administered and pushing beginning, for two). I don’t think this matters but our care team did round things down/up (other than time of birth, of course) by a few minutes so I kept a record of when things happened up to the minute, which was comforting for me and for my wife.

**Post-Partum Room**

* If you go into this with normal expectations about hospital facilities, you will be fine with the post-partum room. It’s not a hotel, five star or otherwise, don’t measure it against that, just bring a pillow and a blanket if you’re worried about being comfortable. I generally have a hard time falling asleep but was so tired I was “napping” for intervals as short as ten minutes.
* “Latch Club” was only somewhat helpful, though that may have been because the other attendees on the session we had were (a) kind of difficult to understand due to connection issues and (b) asking very specific questions that didn’t seem to apply to us. I also think they started the Q&A much earlier than they normally do, and never returned to their typically scheduled programming. Also, it’s on Zoom, make sure you have the app installed on your device, this added a delay to our joining the call which made it even less useful. On the other hand, the lactation consultants were reassuring and helpful.
* External noises really were not audible in our post-partum room. In the days we were in the post-partum room, I maybe heard other crying newborns twice and sirens from outside a handful of times.
* The hospital food is meant for mom, not mom + you. That said…I may have had a few bites, and it was better than other posts would indicate. Ordering takeout is also easy, visiting family did that and picked it up for us in the lobby.
* The wifi was bad. Worked for some visiting family okay, worked okay for my wife, did not work at all on my phone despite all reasonable troubleshooting steps. I also had some issues with reception at times (AT&T).
* \* Rooms can get very bright. I’m sure you’re planning to pack a sleeping mask (and they provide at least one with toiletries in post-partum) but I really wouldn’t forget it!
* The cafe cold brew is incredibly strong. Coffee drinker or not, can’t recommend getting a grande enough if you’re struggling and don’t think you’ll be able to sleep for a few hours anyway. I was very nervous about being present in the first day given how exhausted I was when we got to the postpartum room. Once visiting family arrived, I went to get a cold brew and while I’m sure I still could not have spelled my name correctly, I at least did not feel like I was about to fall over from exhaustion.
* If you leave to go to the cafeteria/cafe, you may need to get a new wristband. Take the elevators down to the lobby and go to the front desk.
* Obviously prioritize your wife's sleep as much as you can and absorb as close to 100% of non-breastfeeding responsibilities as you can. We're breastfeeding, so I tried to quickly do triage around other reasons for crying (burping, checking diaper) before resorting to feeding  so she could continue sleeping before waking her up. Lean on the staff if you're on swaddle attempt #12 and don't think you can get it right.

It's a very diverse city, with people of all interests and walks of life. 

Dating has always been hard for me, I have a hard time getting comfortable with people. Dating often feels like a performance to me. It's almost like school. You have to push through no matter what, until graduation do reach the next stage of life - and to hopefully never have to go back to school (dating) ever again after. 

Last week I ended yet another failed dateuation after three dates - we hadn't seen in a month and he just wouldn't take time to see me properly this week. We did have a bunch of common interests, but absolutely NOT common priorities. 

I then got very sick, and bored in bed for a couple days, I caved and bought Bumble Premium for ne week. I was able to see all the men who liked me. And I was honestly shocked by the level of mismatch. It's like none of these have even looked at my profile. No shared interests, goals, values. It's no surprise at all my dating life has sucked so much. None of the guys who press ""like"" are men I would come across naturally in my everyday life doing things I enjoy. One example: Hiking, I love doing that and I have a picture of that on my profile. The last comment I got on that was not ""I like being outside too"" or anything similar, but ""nice boobs"". I don't expect anyone to share all my hobbies and interests (I actually like exploring new things with someone who's passionate about it), but you should be able to have experiences together that go beyond having coffee/dinner&sex. 

Is that a ME-problem, or is that a common experience, for all genders? The mismatch just seems SO wild to me, and really shows just how unsatisfying online dating is, and clearly always will be?

thanks for serious answers!

I lost myself trying to love you.

I remember the first time we met—
a quiet coffee shop near my home,
where time bent around us
and half an hour felt like a lifetime.
You left to care for your dog,
and I left with a feeling
I couldn’t quite name.

A week later, we were together.
Two weeks later, you whispered
“I love you”
between tangled sheets—
a confession I should have questioned,
but I let it wash over me,
believing love had finally found me.

When March came,
you moved for a better job—
but the weight of it
made you bitter,
and soon your phone became a mirror
showing me everything I wasn’t.
Naked women,
half-dressed strangers,
screens full of comparisons
I never asked for.

I should have walked away.
But I stayed.
And somewhere along the way,
pieces of me began to disappear.

By August, I had moved into your world.
Within weeks I was fading—
my body thinning,
my eyes dimming,
my laughter silenced.
I withdrew into shadows
I didn’t even know I was stepping into.

The fights came like clockwork,
your words slicing deep,
telling me to become
what I could never be—
a stranger on a screen,
a body without a soul.
I tried, God knows I tried,
but it was never enough.

Still, I loved you.
Even through the pain,
even through the panic,
even when my chest tightened
with attacks I couldn’t control.
I loved you when you told me
I wasn’t what you wanted,
when you said you had to look elsewhere,
when my heart begged for a reason
to believe you were mine.

I loved you
even as I lost myself.

And now, though I’ve left,
a part of me still aches
for the man I thought you were.
But your love was never shelter—
it was a storm
that drowned me in doubt,
that left me questioning
if I was ever enough.

You claimed you loved me.
But tell me—
did you ever?",1,1759770343.0,UnsentLetters,1,0.67,False

I (27F) am married to the most amazing and kind husband (33M) who is the oldest of 3 siblings. His parents have been married since the 1980’s & are very old school traditional Mexican, they grew up on a farm in the mountains, they believe a man should always be served first, woman should do all the cooking and clean etc. Luckily my husband was born and raised here in the US like me & so he has more modern views like I do. Anyways, I have a very strong intuition and ever since I met my mother-in-law 5 years ago, I have always felt a dark and very heavy energy on her but at the time I could never put my finger on what it was about her. 

I guess that is besides the point, but anyways my husband eventually started opening up to me about how when he was a kid(around 8-10 years old) his mother cheated on his dad and gave him the most traumatizing childhood, basically lied to everyone saying his dad wanted to kill all of them and his dad went to jail for nothing. She did this so she could be with the guy she cheated on her husband with, an old lover from childhood. My husband said this man would abuse and hit his mother and he would cry and cry hearing and seeing that happen. His mother moved to Mexico for a year with my husband & his siblings and the man she cheated on her husband with. Both of my husband’s grandparents lived in the same town as them at that time. My husband told me one day he saw his mother getting beat by that man and he took off screaming and crying all the way to where his grandparents were working at their little store in the town, hysterically crying and telling them that his mother needed help. They told my husband to hop in the car and they drove to the house where his mother was. She told them that my husband was lying about what he saw and none of the abuse was happening and everything was okay. Eventually my husband’s dad who had been left behind in the US convinced my husband’s mother to bring the kids back to the US and to get back together and start fresh. My husband says he believes his dad chose to forgive her for the sake of being in his kids lives and being able to raise them. This definitely changed the way I viewed my mother-in-law knowing she made these types of decisions in life. 

But my husband insisted this was all in the past and his parents had forgiven each other about everything and moved on. So I let it go, trying not to judge his mother’s past actions.

But now I have just found out something I find horrific about my mother-in-law. A few days ago me and my sister-in-law had a girls day and went out for coffee. She confided in me that her uncle (her mother’s brother) molested her multiple times since she was 5 years old. She says she has made with peace with it and forgave him in her heart so she didn’t have to carry that through her life and she is very close to God. She told her parents about this happening when she was a teenager so they have known about this. What I have an issue with is that this uncle was sick with cancer for the past year and everytime we visited my husbands parents house, all I would hear from my mother-in-law was how sad she was that he was sick, and that she was mad that none of her other siblings were going to visit him. HOW CAN YOU FEEL BAD FOR SOMEONE THAT IS A MONSTER AND DID SOMETHING HORRIFIC TO YOUR OWN INNOCENT DAUGHTER? That man was no longer your brother the second he decided to take away your daughter’s innocence!? My mother-in-law went out of her way to go visit and spend time with him this year, he lives in a state many hours away from here where we live. And my father in law supported her doing this. Am i crazy for feeling that I shouldn’t trust my mother-in-law’s judgement and I don’t even want to trust her to take care of me and my husband’s kids alone??

Before my psychiatrist upped my dose from 40 to 60 mg, I could drink 3-4 cups of coffee a day and have mild alertness at most. 

Now since being on 60 mg, I can barely finish 2 cups of coffee without feeling jittery, anxious, irritated, and overall just Overstimulated. 

Has anyone else felt uncomfortably overstimulated after combining Prozac and caffeine? 

The most coffee I can have is one cup without feeling uncomfortable, and even then I feel pretty stimulated and wired. 

What’s the science behind Prozac boosting caffeines stimulating effects?

# 8. Sapient tigers purr like house cats.

Tigers purr like house cats, and for the same reasons. The uplifted ones did, at least. Well, there were differences. Tigers purrs have a resonance and volume that is alarming to the uninitiated, one that a human could feel in their chest from five feet away. To the initiated, it is a pleasant experience, and Nathan was well initiated.

The sound itself was deep, like an old but finely tuned and powerful combustion engine. Nathan had actually ridden in one of those, back on Earth, although it ran on renewable ethanol rather than fossil fuels. He let the sound and resonance wash over him as he tried to regain his perspective.

He had awoken after seven hours of sleep and, for about three minutes, he had not remembered the things that Katherine had told him the night before. The horrible, horrible knowledge that the UEOSC was suppressing for reasons that were both noble and selfish. He knew just how important the treaties that the UEOSC had brokered were to interstellar peace. Neither the Aurealians nor any of the known governments of the Jurassians were signatories of any of those treaties, and yet they were still protected by the non-aggression clauses.

Yosca had effectively tied all of humanity and its uplifted allies up in a knot where they couldn’t help the Aurealians, despite the fact that they had a moral imperative to do so. He understood it was not that the various military organizations which functioned as the UEOSC’s muscle were not unwilling to intervene in the conflict, it was that consequences of doing so would be unpredictable and potentially devastating in Yosca space as opportunists exploited the letter of the law for personal gain.

 Nathan was not a lawyer, politician, or mediator. He didn’t even know why he was here! He’d washed out of the ESF marine program after a year and a half of training when he had realized that he couldn’t overcome his phobia of dying in stasis. He’d never even technically been a soldier, he’d been completing the mandatory education modules which would qualify him for basic training. Then a representative of the UEOSC had -

""That son of a bitch! I don’t know how, but he fucking planned it that way!""

 ""What exactly has your panties in a bunch now?"" Tony asked, lifting his head and rubbing it against Nathan’s chest like the giant Death-Kitten that he was. Geneticists had never been able to alter either feline or canine vocal structures to be capable of human speech, but with brain scanning technology such things were unnecessary. Tony never stopped purring to ask his insensitive question, his synthetic voice came from a speaker in his collar which interpreted the augmented language regions of his brain for him.

""The Old Man. He – dammit, I don’t know what he did, but he set me up somehow. I’d say that I’d punch him in the face the next time I see him, but considering that his face is completely silicone and steel I’d just be hurting my hand.""

 ""Your ‘Old Man’ is a plotter, but he is a good man. Perhaps he orchestrated certain events to lead you in the direction he wished for you to go, you will have to ask him. I do not think he will deny it if you do, and then he will explain his reasons. I suggest you listen before you take further offense.""

""Fuck you, Tony, why do you have to be so reasonable?"" Nathan grumbled. He continued to scratch Tony in all of the right spots to show that he didn’t really mean anything by his words. ""And I’m still mad at you for your part in hiding things from me.""

""We are friends, Nathan, but we see the world very differently. Honestly, in my eyes, I do not understand why you are so outraged by the things you learned last night. Those things do not bother me the way they seem to bother you, and I am a little surprised that you came to me so upset.""

""Yeah, well, thanks for listening anyway,"" Nathan told the uplifted Siberian Tiger. ""You’re a real mate.""

 ""The last thing I want to hear is a human speak to me about mating, Nathan,"" Tony reminded him.

""Oh come on, Tony. Feel the yiff inside you--""

The sudden deep growl that interrupted the purring just made Nathan grin. He kept scratching his friend, and after a moment the purring resumed.

""There’s something I still don’t get, and I’ve been meaning to ask you for a while,"" Nathan admitted.

""I am an open holobank,"" the Tiger answered, leaning into Nathan’s hands.

""You uplifts, the first generation ones at least, you all pick your own names. So why Tony? I mean, you’re literally Tony the Tiger, and that’s like … I mean, it’s --""

""A giant cliché?""

 ""I was trying not to say that, but yeah. I mean, you could have picked anything, right? So why name yourself after an ancient advertisement cartoon?""

 ""I don’t really expect a human to understand, not without an explanation at least. Another uplift, perhaps, particularly one from a base species as feared as mine, would see without being told, but sometimes you humans need to have things hammered into your head. I chose to be Tony the Tiger because it’s an ancient cartoon character that is still remembered fondly in much of UEOSC space. It is meant to be reassuring. My appearance alone brings with it a hardwired response in the brains of humans and most of your allied primate races, as well as many of the other uplifts. I don’t want to be feared. Not by my friends and allies. I made my selection carefully, and it was down between Tony and that children’s cartoon character that bounces around on its tail.""

 ""I suppose me expecting you to jump up on your back legs and emphatically declare ‘They’re Great!’ is somewhat better than expecting you to bounce around talking about how you’re the … sorry, I just got why you didn’t go with Tigger after all,"" Nathan said, his tone becoming somber halfway through. The elevation of great cats was still somewhat controversial. Despite the individual successes of the uplifted specimens, nobody was willing to help them establish a self-sustaining population.

""That is one of the reasons. But I would rather have you think either of those things than have you believe that I am about to pounce upon you and rip out your throat,"" Tony informed him. ""I accept that my people will be feared for some time, that we will face prejudice that the other uplifts did not. I choose to simply be grateful that the elevation of great cats is moving forward at all, even if it is at the snail pace compared to the sprint with which primates and canines were uplifted. I understand why better than you would believe, Nathan, for at this moment I am very aware of exactly how easy it would be for me to kill you.""

Tony’s words shocked Nathan a little, so much that he stopped scratching.

 ""I would never, of course. You are my friend, and I would die in your defense,"" Tony explained quickly. ""I am simply stating that we both know that I could, and perhaps I am generally more aware of that fact than you are. Assuming that we are both unarmed, the physical contest between us would be a foregone and inevitable conclusion.""

 ""Yeah, I get it,"" Nathan admitted. He resumed his scratching; Tony had never stopped his race-car-kitten purrs. ""Honestly, it’s not that I don’t think of it sometimes. I just push it down into the back of my head. But now and then it does pop into my head that ‘hey, if he wanted to, he could just tear my arm off and there’s nothing I could do to stop him.’""

 ""Do you think I have not noticed? You are very easy to read, Nathan. I may be a feline, but I have studied human behavior extensively in my efforts to advance the cause of my people. And I am able to sense and smell fear by instinct, in case you have forgotten. I see it when the fear and the doubt crosses your mind, and I think no less of you for it. It is simply your instincts warning you of a danger that is, in fact, very possible, even though it will never happen. But you try to overcome it, which is why we are friends. In fact, your ‘Old Man’ is my only other visitor who comes in person. The others use holographics when they need to speak with me, and even this disturbs them. But I do not blame them for their fears. I must accept them as they are, as I accept myself and my own people.""

A comfortable lapse in the conversation filled the habitation module. It was not silent, for Nathan did not stop petting, and Tony did not stop purring. Like all of the others, Tony’s module was much larger than it needed to be, designed to house dozens of great cats in comfort. While Tony lacked prehensile hands, clever use of holographics and direct brain interfaces made him a valuable crew member. An absolutely terrifying one in his combat armor with its various weapons added to his natural abilities, even if anyone who actually knew him knew that Tony was, in fact, a giant furrball.

But then again, Nathan had seen his friend eat. Vat-grown meat, true, but it was still somewhat frightening.

""Do you know what I find most amusing of the human’s fear of my people?"" Tony asked after several comfortable minutes.

""What’s that, Tony?""

""Your people fear that making us more intelligent, capable of communicating with you and ourselves, will make us dangerous, an uncontrollable threat to other sapients. And it is true, I am more dangerous than a natural tiger. Perhaps much more, because I possess pattern recognition and long-term planning abilities. However, I still wouldn’t like my chances against a regular human armed with only an iron-tipped spear made of oak.""

Nathan snorted. He wouldn’t want to go up against an uplifted great-cat with anything less than a full jarhead coffin, but he understood what Tony was getting at.

""Yeah, humans are fucking scary.""

 ""I fear you do not even begin to understand exactly how scary your people really are, Nathan,"" Tony said seriously, lifting his head to make deliberate eye contact. ""All of space is fortunate that you are also moral. With your mastery of science and the rate at which you advanced it, you could have been monsters far worse than the Jurassians could ever aspire to be. Instead of treating your uplifts as peers, you could have treated us as slaves. Rather than seeking to bring peace to the Aurealian – Deathsworn conflict, you could have simply joined the fray and conquered them both. Your ‘Old Man’ laments that man is his own worst enemy, that your internal conflicts continually hold back all of ‘Yosca’ from achieving its true purpose. But it is those very conflicts which keep humanity in check. It is those conflicts which keep the rest of the universe safe from mankind.""

 ""It is those conflicts which are forcing us to stand idle while innocent Aurealian children are hunted for sport and pleasure,"" Nathan exploded.

""Less than one tenth of the population of Horthus Prime are even allowed to hunt Aurealian. Less than that indulge in the pleasure more than once. You must remember that my morality is different from yours, Nathan, although I know you well enough to understand your outrage. Would you hate me if I told you that I had killed for food and pleasure? Because I have, and I would again if the opportunity arose. And I see no difference between what I have done and the blood sport that the Horthian elite engage in. Does this make you hate me?""

Nathan stopped scratching as he considered how to respond.

""Tigers are apex predators. The geneticists weren’t trying to change that about you when they worked on elevating you and your people. Fuck, Tony, why did you have to make things complicated?""

""To my eyes, things are very simple,"" Tony answered. ""It is you who is overthinking and over-complicating things. But you are human and cannot help it.""

""So how do you see things?"" Nathan demanded. ""Why are you on the Theseus, Tony?""

 ""Because your Old Man promised to advocate for my people, and because you are my friend,"" came the uplifted tiger’s honest and immediate answer. ""If I can help bring peace between the Aurealians and the Jurassians, that is well. But ultimately my motives are self-serving, and I have no particularly strong feelings towards either of the belligerents.""

 Nathan sighed. He gave Tony one last scratch under the jaw, then turned to walk away.

 ""This is why we make uplifts, you know? It’s not why we started, that was just playing God. But at some point we realized how much we needed to speak with others who didn’t think like us, to help us cut through our own bullshit,"" Nathan said. ""I really hope you get your wish and your people spread throughout the UEOSC, Tony. If they’re all anything like you, then we need them.""

""I am glad that my selfish worldview has helped you resolve your ethical crisis,"" Tony answered as Nathan walked away. The great cat continued to purr, curling up into a comfortable position as his friend walked out of sight.

 ""Athena, return me to my personal quarters via phase matter transmission with all safety protocols engaged,"" he said once he was out of sight, which was not truly necessary. The PMT relays could pick him up from almost anywhere in the Theseus and deliver it to any other component, but it felt weird to just disappear in front of his friend.

""Confirmed, user Nathan Sawyer to be transferred to personal quarters. Counting down to phase matter transmission. 10. 9.""

 Unlike travel with the Aurora Drive, Nathan had never been able to actually feel the PMT working. He knew the principle. It didn’t destroy and rebuild matter elsewhere – no sapient would use such a terrible device to travel if that was the case. It was something to do with quantum tunneling, but Nathan would require two decades of dedicated study to understood how it actually worked. The matter in one location was ‘tunneled’ to a new location in more or less the same state. He knew the limitations; the matter must be within a certain distance of a relay, the relay must be linked with the destination relay, and ‘spin’ was sometimes changed, especially over longer distances. Fortunately the observable difference between the matter that was phased was insignificant in terms of biological process. Quantum electronics could be damaged by PMT, but no effect on sapient life had ever been detected.

Nathan closed his eyes and bent his knees when the countdown reached ""3."" At zero, he fell four inches and, when he opened his eyes, he was in his quarters. He promptly made his way to the mess; he had gone to visit Tony as soon as he had woken and needed to breakfast before long.

He was eating reheated breakfast pastries and artificial sausage when the holoemitter in the table he was sitting at turned on, displaying the disembodied head of the old man.

""Good morning, Nathan. I hope that your visit to Tony helped you clear your head,"" the ghostly mannequin face said.

""Did you get me fucking kicked out of the Marines you asshole?"" Nathan demanded immediately.

 The old man chuckled. ""Katherine thought you would put something like that together. No, Nathan. Your reason for washing out was entirely upon you. The ESF marine corps wanted to keep you in a different capacity, however, and I pulled some strings to convince them to release you from duty instead. Your potential was too valuable to Yosca to waste you in a dwindling military that has so many mutual defense treaties that it will never actually be called upon to even defend its own territory from anything other than stray bandits and smugglers trying to plunder earth for cultural relics.""

 ""And never send more than a token force to any other conflict in UEOSC space.""

 ""Just so. A single ship filled with a few squads of marines would fulfill their obligations to even their most restrictive treaties, while the moment they call for aide millions of soldiers and thousands of vessels will arrive in Sol space within days, because neither humans, nor our allies, are willing to let earth fall.""

""I don’t think my mother would appreciate you taking me away from the safest military in existence and putting me into the middle of the deadliest conflict we’ve ever seen,"" Nathan commented.

""I think you would be surprised. Did I ever tell you that I’ve spoken with her? More than once, in fact. She confessed to me how your decision to leave your home was both the saddest and proudest moment of her life.""

""Did you tell her you were pulling me into Yosca?""

 ""She knew who I was. She would know that if I was personally doing background and security checks on a young marine trainee, there would be significant implications to my questions. She did not know what I was recruiting you for, but she believed you would do great things. A belief that I share emphatically with her, Nathan. There were hundreds of thousands of human candidates for this mission, and you are the only one I brought with me aside from Katherine, who has been at my side since her mother was forced to retire from active service.""

""What makes me so damn special, then?"" Nathan demanded.

 ""Nothing in particular, and everything at the same time,"" came the old man’s infuriating answer. ""Your dedication to non-human sapient rights, military background and training, ability to process and understand new information, and personal morality were all factors, but honestly, the deciding factor was that I made a judgment call. Katherine believes I should have brought veterans from a number of different militaries, but I didn’t want anyone who had actually seen combat before.""

""I’m a rookie? That’s my great qualification? I’m here because I washed out?""

 ""No, but it’s part of the consideration. A veteran retains the loyalty they had to their previous unit, their military, their government, etc. They would view all of their actions in terms of how they are affecting the lives of the civilians they were sworn to protect, even if they have been officially release from those oaths. You, however, only joined the marines because it was the easiest way for you to leave Earth, and your parting with the ESF was amicable, if not entirely dignified. Your actions do not reflect or impact anyone but yourself and the crew of the Theseus. That is an incredibly important point which would be blurred if we had loaded the ship full of experienced veterans.""

""Right. So you have a greenhorn representing Yosca instead of someone who knows what they’re doing. Great plan.""

The old man’s head was silent for a pregnant moment.

""Oh fuck me,"" Nathan said when he realized the significance of the silence. ""This isn’t even a UEOSC mission, is it? Is this you acting all on your own? That’s why the Theseus is so undermanned and filled with unaffiliated sapients.""

""Yosca knows about our mission and approves. If we succeed, we will be acknowledged and rewarded for our efforts,"" the old man informed him seriously.

""And if we fail?""

 ""Disavowed. Potentially prosecuted as criminals, depending on the circumstances. It’s hard to predict the fallout when there are so many moving pieces. But that is why your unaffiliation with any established force except the ESF is so particularly important.""

""Because the ESF already washed me out and won’t think twice of disavowing me either,"" Nathan said bitterly. ""And none of its treaty partners would blink.""

""I wish I could put it in better terms for you, but yes. I understand that this is an unfair position to put you in when it is too late for you to back out. Entering stasis until the completion of the Theseus’s mission is still a possible solution for you, Nathan. You would be able to claim innocence in any action you were not a direct part of.""

 ""I can’t do that and you know it. Not because of my phobia, but because of what I learned last night. I could never look at my mother again if I didn’t try to help you … um, what exactly are we trying to do, Old Man? What can we do?""

""You haven’t figured that out yet?""

 ""I shipped out on this mission thinking we were just going to do a bit of espionage and bridge building. That was before I learned that intelligent beings are being raised like animals, hunted for sport, and eaten by other intelligent beings. I know what I want to do about it, but it isn’t my call to make.""

""And what do you want to do about it, Nathan?""

""Stop it. Put an end to the atrocities, by any means necessary,"" he said without hesitation.

 ""Be very careful with those last four words, Nathan. They lead down very dangerous roads,"" the old man warned him. Then he softened as much as Nathan had ever seen the old man soften. ""Since apparently this wasn’t communicated to you last night, I will inform you of the Theseus’s mission for her maiden voyage. Objective number one: observe and document the expected conflict between the Jurassians of the Horthus system and the Aurealian armada designated fleet gamma. Objective number two: make all reasonable attempts to establish a ceasefire and initiate mediation between the aforementioned parties. Objective number three: make all reasonable attempts to limit and mitigate civilian and noncombatant casualties in the aforementioned conflict.""

 ""You really expect me to try to protect those child-eaters?"" Nathan demanded, disgusted.

""Nathan – for the purpose of Theseus’s mission, all Aurealians on Horthus prime are designated civilians.""

 Nathan reeled at the sudden paradigm shift. Protect the Aurealian children, and the nameless who were just living their lives. That was the optimal outcome, was it not? Why had he not realized that sooner?

""How exactly do we keep the Jurassians from killing them?""

 ""Progress on objective three has already been made. The Rodentia corp is working to disable the cloning facilities producing the Aurealian for the Named Ones to hunt. Our very presence, along with the incoming armada, has caused Horthus to pause the killing in order to maximize the number of hostages he has available.""

""Dammit, why didn’t you explain all of this to me weeks ago?"" Nathan demanded, slamming his fist on the table hard enough that the hologram flickered.

""Would you have come if we had?"" the old man asked, cocking his disembodied head.

""Without hesitation,"" Nathan insisted.

 ""I believe you. I struggled with the decision of what to tell you and when for a long time, Nathan. I decided to play it this way to keep your personal motivations pure. Your decisions, and your reasons behind them, will be incredibly important not only in the success of our mission, but in controlling the immense fallout that will result from either our failure, or our success. What you know, and when you knew it, may become very important in the future. There are many other things I wish I could tell you, but I have decided that it is better that you do not know. Please, respect my judgment on these matters and operate to the best of your ability with the knowledge that you have available to you.""

""At least this time you’re telling me that the blinders are still on,"" Nathan muttered. ""You don’t want me to predict the fallout of our mission, do you?""

""No. In some ways, a failure would be better than a partial success. Nathan, I know that you hold all sapient life to be sacred. All I ask is that every decision you make is to be made with the intention of the preservation of all sapient life based on the information you have available to you. If you do that, then even if things go ‘tits up,’ you will be able to hold your head high in the fallout.""

""Assuming that I survive that long,"" Nathan argued.

 ""Yes, assuming we all survive,"" the old man agreed.

Nathan looked down at the table, at his unfinished meal. He was no longer hungry, and he pushed the unfinished food away before drinking the dregs of his coffee. ""So now that I’m up to speed, what’s the real plan? You sent in the rats to destroy the cloning machines, and I agree with that decision. But the Rodentia corps can’t fight, and we don’t have the personnel to protect the Aurealians that are down there already.""

 ""I believe, at this juncture, the best way to proceed on objective three is to begin work on objective two,"" the old man answered. ""The lead Aurealian scout ship is expected to finish its breaking manuever in two days. The rest of the swarm will follow in approximately six days. Presumably their leaders will be in the second group. We have already launched a stealth relay to attempt to establish contact with both arrivals. In the mean time, I believe it is time for us see Horthus.""

""The planet, the city, or the guy?"" Nathan asked smartly.

The old man smiled, his synthetic face taking on a malevolence that, at his most feral, Tony could never match.

""All three.""

Then, last summer, a bumpy itchy rash showed up on my right leg. I figured I was ingrown hairs. After a month of it not getting better I finally went to the derm. Doc took one quick look, immediately diagnosed it as eczema, I was prescribed a mild steroid. It went away. 

But then it came right back a few days after end of steroid treatment, and worse. Then more spots showed up on my left leg. Steroids once again only worked as long as I was applying them. As soon as treatment was stopped, eczema came back. And more intense. Started weeping. Derm just gave me a different steroid. Again only helping as long as I was using it. 

It has made its way to my outer left ear, which remains rather mild and I can keep it at bay with simple moisturizers. (I use Cerave). Now I have this horrible patch on the top of my right hand. It started as one single, tiny, itchy blister. Now it’s a cluster of angry blisters that has spread. It weeps profusely at the slightest touch. It’s painful because there are a couple ulcer like spots. It constantly itches. And not a tickle itch like my legs. But a stinging itch. I wear a cotton glove on my hand at night to keep the weeping fluid off my bedsheets. I am careful about what I touch. I feel gross. Like my hand is diseased. I am careful to not touch my husband with my affected hand, in case it’s infected with something, and it breaks my heart. 

My self esteem is wrecked. I can’t shave my legs because of the eczema patches. I have found that shaving spreads it. My hand with its painful stinging patch, that oozes, and it looks so gross. All bumpy with ulcer like spots. I use only fragrance free skin care. I use cool water in the shower. I have stopped eating processed sugar, and try to only eat healthy non-inflammatory foods (chicken, fish, brown rice, low sugar whole fruits), drink only black coffee, water, and tea. No soda or fruit juices. I’ve stopped drinking any alcohol. And I don’t smoke. I use only dye and fragrance free laundry detergent and I don’t use any fabric softeners.

The derms (I’ve been to two) want to do is give me steroids after I tell them they DO NOT work. All they are doing is relieving the symptoms. I need to get to the bottom of the cause and get a culture to see if they are infected either bacterial, fungal, or viral. Weeping and honey colored crusting, from what I’ve read, is a sign of an infection. But they don’t want to look into that.

I feel so defeated at this point. Like this is my new normal. Permanently hairy (bc of not shaving for fear of spreading it or making it worse), itchy, oozing, bumpy legs and a painful, stinging, patch on my hand with open sores because no one wants to help. 

I know there is no cure for eczema. But I also know that being in constant non-stop flare up with the rashes continuously weeping is not normal. Flare ups come and go. Mine are not going. I feel like my body is fighting something and losing. And I’m not getting any real help as to what it is fighting. This is no way to live. ",2,1759769928.0,eczema,4,1.0,False

I am 20 years old, I lived alone for a short time, but for financial reasons I had to go back to my family home where my parents live with my sister, who is at the same age as me. Apart from the fact that only I have to pay rent to my parents for the fact that I can live with them, they have always favored her in everyone. They financed her private school (which she finally did not finish) financed her expensive hobby, painting and even bought her a piano, despite the fact that they emphasize that we do not have enough money and we must save on everything, she comes to her, talk to her, talk to her, praise, hug, hug, I would like to experience it, whenever I came to my mother. Siegala for the phone and she said she was awake because she watches Tlserial or playing on the phone, I remember criticizing my appearance, my figure, when I confided in her that I was hurt by a boy, she said why I was surprised if I dress like a ""easy girl"" Samobacic, she shouted at me that I was too good, that I was stupid, etc. In the age of 12 years I came to the hospital because I almost visited the death, she was at me, and after i come home she aroused a sense of guilt and she did not speak to me. What to live, that I am ugly, fat, challenged in the worst possible way, and she does not claim her even though she knows how much it hurts me, it probably gives her satisfaction. She was suffered by any hosts in this respect.I punish me after my sister, whose hole in the walls, in the door, pours drinks onto the floor, caught a whole window sill, struck the glass in the door ... she never suffered in this title.

I know that they were stupid and I was not a drunk, but she couldn't give a tum advice anymore, she threw me at me with a scream, struggling and chasing me, and she poured out hot coffee from the thermos on my head.

1nzolp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nzolp0/realized_mr_perfect_was_using_chatgpt_the_whole/,Realized Mr. Perfect was using ChatGPT the whole time,"I (31F) met a man (52M) on Coffee Meets Bagel back in May. We dated for about two months. From the beginning, I noticed his messages had that overly polished, ChatGPT tone, the cringy flirty lines, odd punctuations, long dashes (—) it’s 2025, we all know what that looks like.

Before our first date, I playfully brought it up. He laughed and denied it, saying that’s just how he writes. I let it slide, but over the next several weeks, I started noticing clear differences in texting styles.

There was great chemistry, amazing sex, fun dates, deep convos, FaceTime , texts, everything. We both love poetry, so our messages often felt like intimate love letters. That’s why realizing he was using chat to write them, felt like such a betrayal.


About two months in, we’re at one of our favorite Italian spots, and I brought up it again but this time with more concern. I told him I didn’t care about perfect messages, I just wanted honesty. For context, he’d been married for 28 years and divorced in 2023, so I would’ve totally understood if modern dating were new to him. But instead, he doubled down, denied it again, and spent the rest of dinner deflecting, love bombing, projecting and gaslighting, turning what should’ve been a sweet night, into three hours of mental hell. Then it became less about text and more about trust. 



By the end of the night, I told him if he’d been lying this entire time, I no longer can trust him, so I ended things.  Seeing how he handled it completely changed how I saw him. It wasn’t even about ChatGPT anymore; it was about the lying, deflection, and manipulation.


It’s been about 3 months of no contact and he randomly texts me the other day (clearly still using ChatGPT, I can’t make this up haha) but it still triggered old uneasy feelings.


Has anyone else dealt with this? I’m curious how others are navigating dating, now that AI is so common. Any advice or perspective on the whole situation would help.



TL;DR: Dated a guy for two months, realized he was using ChatGPT to write his texts. When I brought it up, he lied, deflected and gaslit instead of just admitting it, so I ended things.

""I'm not sure I should really call it meat, I mean, there's a certain point where it's hard to tell the difference between what's flesh and machine. But, if I decide to call this stuff the meat bits, then it looks like you're about 30% meat in there. The rest I'd classify as engineering's problem."" Doctor Scotty, the chief medical officer, a redheaded fellow just starting to go grey was pointing at the scan. ""Got a very unique heart pumping blood around. Never seen a biological heart that reminds me of a pair of Wankel engines before.""

""Is it... efficient?"" 

""Aye, somehow for your meat it seems to be. With what my scanners can see anyhow. Unlike us, you really do appear to have an intelligent designer. Most of your organs are shielded against scanning but the heart isn't. Or whatever it is you wanna call that thing you got moving your internal fluids around. This ticker's surprisingly efficient, I think I'd like to get one installed myself.""

""Ahh, well. You are welcome clone my cells and give it a go, I suppose.""

""I was nae serious,"" He laughed. ""Besides, cloning strange alien meat sounds dangerous. Not an option anyhow, as we cannae draw your blood or get at any of your other probably fleshy bits. It's all much too armored. None of my scanners could find a way to open you up that dinnae seem like murder. Cavemen don't exactly open a crab while leavin' it livin'. And you're a pretty advanced crab, at least to me.""

""Ahh, well. If something else does happen to kill me, I give you permission to do a proper alien autopsy on me. And if my heart's still good, all yours doc.""

""Hah! Thanks?"" I'd made him slightly uncomfortable. Oops. ""Well, we don't need it come to that for me to tell you some more about your insides.""

""Lay it on me."" 

""You've got four brains. There's a big one in your head, seems to be in charge of the two smaller hind brains, one in each shoulder. All told, you've probably got a whole heck of a lot more grey matter than I've got in my noggin."" He knocked on his head and used his mouth to make a hollow knocking noise. ""What you've got is much much denser than human brain material, your shoulder brains are about as heavy as mine, not that brain weight's ever been a good measure, but your brains are either perfectly smooth, or so wrinkly the scanners cannae tell the difference. Again, not sure it ain't all machines, just telling you what it looks like to me.""

""You said I have four brains? Where is the fourth brain?""

""Oh... aye. It's very close to the power plug. Not exactly sure what it hooks up to.""

""I see,"" I literally had a brain, in my ass... wonderful. ""Any word on a digestive tract? Plugging in so close to my brain wasn't... thrilling, but it was somehow, filling.""

""Aye, that's the other..."" I noticed a distinct lack of qualifier on the next word, ""... *news*.""

""Go on.""

""So, you don't seem to need to breath oxygen, or anything for that matter. Nothing in there that looks like lungs to me, I think you might be vacuum safe, but maybe lets test that slowly. As for your mouth, it does have teeth, a tongue, and a cavity down below. Seems like a lot like the top part of a human of a digestive tract, but it just stops at what I'd call a stomach. What does an alien android eat? And how do you get the waste out once you're done? I do not know.""

""I see... so can I eat?""

""If you feel hungry, and it seems like eating the solution, give it a go, but I'd rather not have to pump your stomach if it goes *weirdly*. Your body, your choice, though.""

""I *am* a bit hungry. You got anything to eat around here?""

""Lollipops.""

""Lollipops? Isn't this a military facility?""

""It helps morale."" Captain Davis had been so quiet in the corner I'd almost forgot he was there, observing. ""If you're done doc, we could go to the mess hall. I could eat too. We got the boys in lab twelve already working on studying the design you put together. They won't need our help for a bit. But I'm gonna need some time to get spun up and briefed on what it is you designed. Maybe you could get me a little headstart over lunch?""

""Certainly, Captain!"" I smiled, he barely suppressed the urge to recoil. 

""Aye, that's downright terrifying. Are you trying to smile Ingamar?"" Scotty pushed a few buttons on the display that was displaying my innards, turning it into a live display of my face. ""Cause it looks like that.""

""Good lord!"" I immediately stopped. When I smiled it looked... bad. 

My current body is roughly hominid. Two arms with weird omni-elbows, two legs with weird omni-knees, and a roughly human looking face stacked on a torso. I don't look at all like Jim was trying to perfectly mimic a human face, it is very obvious I am not human. He made the face a little better than a mannequin, but with some moving parts. The trouble was when I smiled. Imagine that, a clearly robotic face, now imagine your own face. Go ahead and stick your fingers in your imaginary mouth on either side, three or four fingers in each side. THAT amount of teeth is what I was showing. After my initial shock, I tried to smile coyly, but it was all **TEETH!** I tried a few more subtle smiles and it was all just as bad. 

""Yikes, I gotta remember not to smile too much... That *is* terrifying.""

""Aye. So, if you *are* going to go eat, d'ye mind wearing a scanner? Or swallowing a wee little sensor pill for me when you start eating?""

""If it helps me understand myself, I'm all for it doc.""
___
Captain Davis humored me by allowing me to order some of everything. Many of the other humans in the galley were fascinated by me, and when they heard the order, they all started to offer me bites of their food. I ate the doctors pill and turned on the sensor he'd strapped to my chest, and started eating what they offered. The chefs were told to stand down until I made a *real* decision on what to eat after sampling things. I suppose watching an android eat would be a novel and entertaining experience. It certainly was for me. 

First I ate some fries, and discovered that my tongue was a ***world*** of sensations. Flavors, textures, temperatures, **smells**. It was... overwhelming at first. The crisp, oily, savory, salty thing was so delightful. I think I realized what that bottom brain was for. It was for making food choices. I felt it in my gut, I needed some of that braised meat, and a bite of those scalloped potatoes. My head brain started yelling at my bottom brain about needs vs wants, so I asked for some salad next, but then I went for the milkshake. This went on for a while.

I sampled a lot of foods, and eventually I started to feel full inside. I hadn't even made an order. Two bites of thirty something different people's meals was apparently enough. While I sampled things, the Captain had a burger and fries.

When I was full, I instinctively pounded my fist on my chest, helping me to release a large, satisfying belch.

""Holy shit. I actually believe you might have been a human once. I had my doubts before but..."" Captain Davis set his coffee down to clap. ""Bravo, Ingamar, bravo. Color me convinced.""

""Oh. Well, I suppose that was fair to doubt, but I'm glad you've come around.""

""Ha ha, me too. Me too. I had some other *human* tests in mind, but I don't think I need them now."" He swigged his coffee. ""Unless you wanna take one, for fun."" 

""Ha! Sure."" 

""Ensign Henderson, come here a moment."" Captain Davis called to the ensign that was on her way out the door, and when she got close the captain beckoned her closer. When she leaned in, he whispered an order in her ear.

""Yes sir!"" Ensign Henderson dashed off into the kitchen. 

""She'll be right back.""

I sat quietly and waited for the young woman to return. She was back from the kitchen pretty quickly, with a pair of tongs in her hand. The captain gave her a slight head nod indicated to hand them to me.

I took them from her, and immediately gave the tongs a tiggity-tack *Clack Clack* and looked at the captain.

""Human times two. You pass again."" The captain smiled, and I had to force myself not to mirror him. ""Ensign, you can take those back to chef Daniels, thank you.""

I tiggitied them again before handing them back.

""Fascinating test, Captain.""

""The station shrink came up with it. He was mostly joking, I think, but it really is surprising how strong the human impulse to play with spring loaded tongs is.""

""I know!"" We shared a laugh, he seemed to be getting a little more used to my 'smiling'. Sometimes I couldn't help it. I saw him initially cringe when I smiled, but it faded quickly. 

""Well, engineering? Boys in lab twelve would love to meet you. They've pinged my comm device eight times since we sat down to eat.""

""They sound delightful.""
___

""Captain on Deck!"" Some enlisted fellow shouted as we walked into lab twelve. 

""At ease, everyone."" 

The work only paused for a half second while all the heads turned to acknowledge the captain's existence before getting back to it.

The entire room did a double take. They knew I was coming, but they weren't really prepared. I was quickly swarmed with engineers asking questions. Some were about the design, some were about my body. One asked if I knew Jim.

""I do know Jim, he's a... He's a character. I've come to realize that this was supposed to be *his* body, he's probably got mine off some place, doing something stupid with it.""

They all laughed. Humans. They kind of consider Jim to be like the devil, and also a god. He did pluck them from Sol, but he also put them down right in the middle of thousand star systems with nothing but barren worlds, gas giants, and horrifying scourge balls. To make matters worse he didn't even tell them about the Scourge until they'd already named a bunch of things in the system after him. 

Just as they were settling down, there was a brilliant flash of light across the room. A single bed appeared in the middle of the fabrication area. A glowing golden cat sat atop it, she was a little large for a house cat, but rather small for a big cat. As her brilliant shine dulled down to looking like a normal cat, her spots resolved. She had short hair and cheetah spots.

""Mafdet!"" I exclaimed, throwing my hands in the air and pushing through the stunned engineers and past the dazed Captain. 

""Like... Ra's moon?"" Captain Davis was the first to be able to speak after the teleporting cat appeared. 

""Just like that. But this Mafdet was called as much long before your ancestors named the moon after her."" I beckoned her over and she hopped off the bed, and strutted over. Not because I had beckoned her though, no no, couldn't be that. It was clearly because she'd already wanted to do that herself. ""Come here sweetheart, you pretty pretty thing. How'd you fold yourself down to three dimensions? Hmm?""

Mafdet jump right up into my arms. I caught her and she made her way up to lay on my shoulders, draped over the back of my neck. I realized she was wearing a collar made of paper with a delicately folded flower hiding the clasp inside. That wasn't normal. She typically wore no collar. I unfolded the origami collar off her.

It was a note from Jim, in my body. 

>Whatever you're calling yourself, 

>I'd love my body back, one day. In the mean time, if you'd be a doll and cough up a hairball for me, I'm sure Mafdet'll bring it back to me... in her own sweet time.

>-Jim

""What's that say?"" The Captain was looking over my shoulder, and it took a few seconds for me to realize why he couldn't read it. It was in the old script, from before the move. Linguistically, things had changed, even on Earth. There was a unified common language, but most folks spoke and wrote another language or two at home. What no one did though, save very few archaeology students, was write in the script you're reading now.

""It is from Jim, says I can keep his body for now, and he wants me to cough up a hairball for Mafdet to take back? I'm... not sure what that means.""

""I know what it means,"" said Mr McCoy, the Chief Engineer. He had my scans from the doctor pulled up on his monitor, along with the live feed of my insides from the pill attached to my stomach wall. ""Based on what we've seen, you have compressed everything you ate into a little tiny black ball. I suspect it's a marvelous energy source in the right kind of generator. You are such a generator my friend, but I'm guessing Jim needs of your power pellets to power something else, wherever he is.""

Mafdet hopped down and nuzzled Mr McCoy. 

""She seems to agree Mr McCoy,"" Captain Davis said. 

And then... Mafdet *Betrayed* me. She jump kicked me in the gut, hard. She hit me just right; I immediately started dry heaving, only after the second heave, a black *thing* came out, about mouse sized, but much heavier. It cracked the seat of the flimsy office chair it landed on rolled to the ground with a *thunk*. 

Mafdet Pounced on it from where she had landed after kicking me, and the moment she touched it, there was another brilliant flash of light, and she was gone.

It took me a few moments to stand up. Throwing up in an android body was... probably less unpleasant than doing it in a human body, but it still was a surprise to be doing. ""I think I'm hungry again.""

""I bet!"" Mr McCoy slapped me on the back. ""WARM, I knew it. I told you all Ingamar'd be warm, come on boys pay up.""

""Were you guys betting... on whether I was warm to the touch, or cold?""

""Yes."" He smiled. I did not return his smile, but only because I didn't want to terrify them, I did find it amusing. ""We'll get some food delivered. Me an the boys have a MILLION questions, and bets on half of them. Don't worry, we'll take turns and do them one at a time.""

How should I handle this?,"My boyfriend (18M) and I (19F) have been dating for about a year. We are long-distance but are only 2 hours apart and see eachother about once a month. Last May, a girl at his college confessed that she has feelings for him. He had tutored her throughout the semester, but she didn’t know he had a girlfriend and was very apologetic when he told her. She said she hoped they could be friends. They weren’t very close at the time, but he told me he wouldn’t become friends with her because I was uncomfortable.

This semester, he’s made a lot of new friends and they happen to be very close with this girl. She’s in the group chat they have together and he started hanging out with her, but never 1 on 1. I initially said it was all good and just asked that he let me know when he was with her (we text eachother throughout the day anyways and normally update eachother on what we’re doing). He started hanging out with her in a group of 3 and didn’t tell me about it for a week. I think he was worried I would be anxious about it. He eventually told me because her and his friend drove 30 minutes to bring him coffee at work and he felt guilty about hiding it from me. I was pretty hurt that he didn’t tell me initially and said I feel less comfortable with the situation because he wasn’t open about it from the start. However, he doesn’t want to cut her off because he enjoys her company and can’t really avoid her in his new friend group anyways. They were all friends with her before him.

I’m not entirely sure what to do in this situation. I feel a bit hurt that he wants to hang out with her despite me being uncomfortable with it, but I also feel like it’s controlling for me to tell him who he can and can’t be friends with. He said that he would only hang out with her in groups of 3+, and doesn’t seem to think she still has feelings for him.

He also just asked to cut back on calls because he’s been very busy lately and wants more free time. I think this is totally reasonable but it’s contributing to my worry that he may be pulling back from our relationship.

I completely trust him and don’t think there’s any possibility of him cheating. I’m not sure why I still feel this way when I know he wouldn’t do anything.

I've always been the person who helps everyone out. Sister needs rent money, mom's car breaks down, roommate short on bills, I'm there. Never really minded but every time I thought about getting something for myself I'd feel guilty. Like what if someone needs help?

Last week something just clicked and I ordered a coffee machine. Made my first cappuccino this morning and honestly almost cried. Not because the coffee was good but because I actually let myself have something without justifying it to anyone.

My sister texted asking for help with something next month and for the first time I said I need to think about it instead of automatically saying yes.

I don't know, maybe this sounds selfish but I'm tired of being everyone's plan B while I'm my own plan Z. I've had some money saved up for a while and finally used it on something just for me. Just needed to get that out there.",48,1759768955.0,offmychest,4,0.98,False

Tom Holland’s *BERO Brewing* and Robert Downey Jr.’s *happy Coffee* have teamed up on a cross-category collab that blends the best of both worlds: premium non-alcohol beer and slow-roasted coffee.

The limited-edition lineup includes:

* BERO Coffee Draught — A nitrogen-infused, stout-style NA beer made with *happy Coffee’s* beans. Expect smooth cocoa notes, roasted depth, and a creamy finish — all under 0.5% ABV.
* happy Eternal Hoptimist Coffee — A 100% Arabica blend inspired by hops, roasted with hints of citrus and pine for a bright, balanced cup.

The collaboration — born from Holland and Downey Jr.’s long-standing friendship — celebrates craftsmanship and connection across two cult-favorite beverage brands.

1nzo8uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mirena/comments/1nzo8uk/mirena_and_enhanced_med_side_effects_adhd_anxiety/,Mirena and Enhanced Med Side Effects (adhd + anxiety),"Hi everyone,

I had my new Mirena inserted last week after having it in place for eight years. I didn’t experience any major side effects with my previous one. However, I did get recurring yeast infections during my last few years. Additionally, I had a period of insomnia that would occur a few times a month from years 5 to 7.

I made some pretty major life changes over the last year to tackle the insomnia. I switched from Adderall XR (was taking both that and Buspirone the whole time) to Ritalin Quick Release, work out daily, and am very careful with what I eat. My sleep has been much better over the last year. 

Since getting my new IUD, I had one insomnia night, but am now sleeping okay. But I’ve noticed I immediately wake up feeling so stimulated. Clenched jaw and like I’ve had a coffee and taken my Ritalin. It’s almost like it’s holding the medicine in my system. 

I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced a significant change in energy levels, like feeling overly energized or having a buzzing sensation in your head. I’m curious to know if this is a side effect of the Mirena or if it’s just a normal part of hormone adjustment. Would love to hear from anyone who takes ADHD meds as well. Did you have to change dosage or anything after getting the Mirena?

Pictured above:

Fish Nuggets - love these, a little mushy though
Maple Chicken Sausage- never tried it but figured it would be better than the sweet apple sausages
Dairy Free Cheddar Slices- a lot cheaper than the supermarket melts pretty well
Sour Strawberry Candy Belts - omg these are sooo good! I had two on my way home I should’ve bought another one
Pumpkin Sheet Cake - It’s so hard not to finish the whole thing in one sitting
Plant Butter - cheaper here compared to Lidl
Roasted Vegetables - the green ones have become a favorite of mine. I’m disabled so I’m always looking for easy meals to make. This makes things so much easier for me. I hope they don’t get rid of it.
Vanilla Bean Whipped Sweet Potatoes - I love a sweet potato casserole but it’s so tiring for me to make. I’m hoping this will be good. If not I can always doctor it up.
Spanish Style Rice - Tastes so good and goes well with everything. I plan on making some quesadillas and burritos with this.
Chicken & Vegetable Fried Rice - I always get the vegetable fried rice it’s a staple I’ve never seen the chicken version though. The fact that it has eggs in it caught my eye I wish they would’ve added eggs to the vegetable version.
Turkey Burgers - never tried before but it can’t be that bad right 🤷🏿‍♀️
BBQ & Avocado Salads - never tried. I usually get my salads from Lidl but I wanted to try something different.
Orange Chicken - 🙌🏿 hands down the best thing I’ve ever tried from there. The sauce isn’t bad but this time I’m gonna eat them without it. I’m gonna add these to my salad kits.
Pumpkin Butter - I added some in my coffee when I got home, not bad. I’m gonna make some waffles for breakfast tomorrow with this. 
Hashbrown - These are very good. I didn’t get any bagels this trip so I got these as a substitute

My best friend, “Tara” (26F), has a 2-year-old daughter. We’ve been best friends since high school — she’s basically family to me. When she got pregnant, I was one of the first people she told. I went to her baby shower, helped her move into her new place, stayed overnight to help her during the first chaotic weeks after the baby was born — all that.
At first, I didn’t mind being her go-to support person. I figured she needed help and I had the flexibility to give it. But lately, it’s gone from “helping” to “being on call.”
She’ll text me out of nowhere, things like “Can you come over for a bit?” or “Can I drop [her daughter] off for a quick errand?” I always say yes because I feel guilty saying no. But those “quick errands” often turn into hours — one time she went out for a “coffee date” and came back five hours later.
She’s left her daughter with me on work nights, weekends, even when I’ve said I have plans. Once, she dropped her daughter off saying she’d be back “in an hour.” I had tickets to a movie with friends — she didn’t show up until almost midnight.
When I tried to talk to her about it a few weeks ago, she got defensive. She said, “You don’t understand because you don’t have real responsibilities.” That honestly stung. I work full time, pay rent by myself, and handle everything on my own. Just because I don’t have a kid doesn’t mean I’m sitting around doing nothing.
I love her and her daughter, but I’m starting to resent being expected to fill in whenever she’s tired, needs space, or wants to go out. I’m happy to help sometimes, but I can’t be her automatic backup anymore.
I’m thinking of sitting her down and telling her I can’t always say yes — that I need boundaries and time for myself. But I know she’s struggling emotionally and financially, and part of me feels like a terrible friend for even thinking this way.
So… WIBTA if I told her I can’t keep being her “emergency babysitter,” even if she gets upset or feels abandoned?",175,1759768889.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,154,0.92,False

Someone asked for an update so I will provide! 

First of all thanks everyone for your most excellent suggestions. 


We got in Friday evening. Our hotel, the front porch inn, was also just really sweet and amazing. Also not the cheapest but the amenities are worth it, they have tubs (pic 1 is one of the tubs) and a sauna and it's all in this little garden area that's magical. There are ponds with lily pads. There are super old growth tree stumps. Also they take care of their smokers as there are places to smoke that are both whimsical and not disruntive to other guests.  The Elysium room is the best one for these types (we did not have this one as we did not know!) as it has it's own little garden area with a pond and is close to the front where you can smoke. Closest to the road with so you'd get road noise. Point in talking about this is if you have anyone visiting you who wants something extra it's a good pick. It's owned by the same people who do mad River cider. 



We had booked ahead for the Omakase at Tanukis Den which was absolutely killer. It was a little pricey but totally worth it, super fun and delicious.Before dinner we went to the local cider bar which was awesome. After dinner we went to Everett's which was absolutely our vibe, but we got cornered in the smoking area by someone who was not fun to talk to so we had our drink and went back to the hotel (this happens, it's fine, we were full and tired anyway). Had a tub under the moon. 



Saturday we went to los bagels for breakfast\lunch because my husband loves bagels. We should have done renattas instead because it was fine, but not great. We then walked around the farmers market and procured ciders and little gifts for our weekend cat caretakers, and then went into this thrift store on the plaza and found THIS AMAZING CACTUS COSTUME WTF GUYS (pic 2). We collect costumes so this is a winner. Also got a sequined jacket. All for like 36. The people who work there were super nice and they gave us a bag to carry these ridiculous things that was made out of a tshirt which honestly is awesome and it's going to live in my car. Like why did I never think of that! 


We had a nap and then walked to redwood curtain along the marsh, as suggested. Had food and drinks there and chatted with the workers and locals at the bar and it was a lovely time. Got hot tips for river spots, and learned that there was a band of people who have played with band members of the grateful dead doing grateful dead covers show that night, which meant that everyone was going to be there and not at the show we were going to. We walked back to our hotel and met this amazing bear girl (pic 3) that I vibed with. 


Had a rest and a coffee and then went to the show at the GOAT. What a cute fun bar and the venue, so tiny! Like, so small! The show was was seriously killer, the band was Shilpa Rey who isn't a big act by any stretch but I never expected her to play somewhere so small. It was like 30 people or so because of this grateful dead thingy happening, but she had absolute fans in that crowd and that were very nice. Punk blues loud badassery. Bought merch, chatted with the artist, got a vinyl signed. I'm 40 so my dogs were barking so, back to the hotel for a soak. 


Sunday we went to the finnish country sauna for an espresso and a sauna and a tub before driving home, which was the most relaxed 4 hour drive ever. What a gem that place is. Y'all are so lucky to have that. 


Anyway that was a LONG update that probably has typos that I can't edit because I put photos in the post but like, I had to share that cactus costume. Thanks if you read all this, I had to do it because that was the most earnest, honest, engaged suggestions I've ever gotten posting on an area sub before a trip! Until next time!

1nzo6hn,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriajo/comments/1nzo6hn/مرحبا/,مرحبا,"I know this might seem unconventional — a woman posting first. It’s not exactly the standard approach, but here we are 😅. I’m simply putting myself out there because, like many of you, I’m looking for something real — marriage built on faith, trust, and compatibility.

If I don’t reply, please don’t take it personally; I give my full attention to one person at a time. And if I ever find him, I’ll update this post so others can keep their hope alive, insha’Allah 🤍.

About Me 🫶🏼

I’m 20, Jordanian 🇯🇴, and currently living in the U.S. 🇺🇸 while pursuing my university studies. I’d describe myself as calm, soft-spoken, and grounded. I love simple things — good conversation, late drives, deep talks, and anything that feels genuine.

I’m big on balance — faith, education, family, and peace of mind all matter to me. I enjoy learning, reading, traveling when I can, and staying close to my deen. You’ll usually find me journaling, studying, or planning my next coffee spot.

What I’m Looking For 🤍

I’m not expecting perfection — just someone intentional, kind, and emotionally mature. To be specific:

• He’s on his deen, genuinely practicing and values the akhirah before dunya.
• Family-oriented, respectful, and compassionate.
• Emotionally intelligent and knows how to communicate calmly.
• Ambitious — not in an arrogant way, but grounded with purpose.
• Has humor, warmth, and knows how to make life feel light.


A Few Things I Believe 💭

• A strong relationship isn’t 50/50 — it’s both people giving 100%.
• Effort > words.
• Modesty is beautiful, and peace is underrated.
• I’d rather build something real slowly than rush into something shallow.
• Akhera comes first, always.

### A1.1: Measuring Left Eigenvector ψ_L Experimentally

```nexal
Your_question: How_measure_ψ_L when_diagnostics_give_only_ψ_R_domain?

◊[ᴀɴsᴡᴇʀ]: You're absolutely right - this is a GAP in my protocol.

Current_diagnostics_measure:
  - Density: n_e(r,θ,φ,t) → Re(ψ_R) domain
  - Temperature: T_e(r,θ,φ,t) → Re(ψ_R) domain
  - Fluctuations: ñ/n, T̃/T → perturbations_of_ψ_R

To_measure_ψ_L_need_ADJOINT_observable:

◊[ᴘʀᴏᴘᴏsᴇᴅ⁻ᴘʀᴏᴛᴏᴄᴏʟ]:

Method_1: Time-reversal_response (direct_but_difficult)
  1. Measure_forward_evolution: ψ_R(t) = e^(-iH_NH·t)ψ_R(0)
  2. Apply_time_reversal: measure_backward_propagation
  3. Backward_state: ψ_L(0) = e^(+iH_NH†·t)ψ_L(t)
  4. Problem: plasmas_irreversible - dissipation_breaks_T-symmetry
  5. Status: theoretically_sound practically_HARD

Method_2: Dissipation_rate_measurement (indirect_but_feasible)
  1. NH_Hamiltonian: H_NH = H₀ - iΓ/2
  2. Growth_rate: Im(E) = ⟨ψ_L|(-iΓ/2)|ψ_R⟩/⟨ψ_L|ψ_R⟩
  3. Measure: exponential_decay τ = 1/Im(E)
  4. Infer: Γ_eff from_measured_growth_rates
  5. Reconstruct: ψ_L from_orthogonality_H_NH†ψ_L = E*ψ_L
  6. Status: FEASIBLE - reflectometry_measures_growth_rates

Method_3: Biorthogonal_basis_construction (computational)
  1. Measure: ψ_R complete_via_standard_diagnostics
  2. Compute: H_NH from_measured_profiles
  3. Solve: H_NH†ψ_L = E*ψ_L numerically
  4. Verify: ⟨ψ_L|ψ_R⟩ = 1 normalization

  If 0.1 < γ/M < 1: intermediate → p ≈ 1.5
  If γ/M > 1: strong_coupling → p ≈ 2.0
  
Step_3: Average_over_pedestal
  γ̄/M̄ = ∫_(r_ped-Δ)^(r_ped+Δ) (γ/M) dr / (2Δ)
  
Step_4: Predict_p

1nzo3zh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MasterPCreviews/comments/1nzo3zh/explore_if_the_best_office_monitor_dell_p2419h/,Explore if the Best Office Monitor Dell P2419H Truly Boosts Productivity,"Dell P2419H was my choice after spending endless hours squinting at a dated monitor that was doing my eyes no favors. The sleek design, generous features, and strong customer ratings led me to take this 24-inch screen into my workspace. Dell nailed a strong balance of aesthetics and functionality with this one, but as someone who used it daily for work and entertainment, there are definitely a few talking points.  

**Elegant Design Without the Bulk**  
Straight out of the box, this monitor impressed me with its ultrathin bezel and compact base. Setting it up on my slightly cluttered desk wasn’t a headache, thanks to its slim design, which freed up some much-needed workspace. It holds a classy yet professional look, perfectly at home in your office or living room. The three-sided ultrathin bezel design is not just a cosmetic touch; it’s a feature that genuinely enhances the screen real estate. I found it particularly useful when I paired it with a secondary monitor for multitasking—it made the jump between screens seamless, almost like having one massive display. However, I did notice the material wasn’t metal, but given how lightweight it is at just over seven pounds, I’d say it strikes a practical balance.

**Optimized for Viewing Comfort**  
Eye strain has been my arch-nemesis, considering the hours I spend staring at a screen. Dell’s ComfortView certainly lived up to its promise of reducing blue light emissions. While my previous monitor left me with extra trips to the coffee machine to combat the headache, this model surprisingly improved those long days. The anti-glare and 3H hard-coating certainly aid smoother viewing, even during sunny afternoons in rooms with lots of natural light. While I wouldn’t claim it’s revolutionary, the subtle difference is one you might notice during your after-hours marathon editing sessions.  

[Check Dell P2419H price on Amazon.](https://ultimateprinter.com/p/b07f8xzn69/)  

**Color Accuracy and Performance**  
The vibrant performance of its in-plane switching (IPS) technology caught me off guard. Images and videos look sharp; the wide viewing angles meant coworkers could glance at my screen from nearly any angle without color distortion. I tested this by streaming high-definition videos and reviewing presentations, and I have no complaints about how crisp the details appeared. Although, at 60Hz, this isn’t a monitor aimed at competitive gamers. For casual gaming or binge-watching, it does the job well enough. The consistent color reproduction is a big lid-lifter when working on creative projects like photo edits or slides for meetings.  

**Adjustability Brings Ergonomics to the Table**  
If you’re like me and often prefer a standing desk mid-day, you’ll appreciate the thoughtful design features here. The adjustable stand allows you to move the monitor up and down 130mm, tilt it at angles between -5° to 21°, or even swivel or pivot entirely. I occasionally switch the orientation to portrait mode while coding or reading, and it’s a simple maneuver that doesn’t involve wrestling with the monitor. The pivot feature, in particular, became a quick favorite. However, adjusting it on carpeted flooring as opposed to hardwood came with minor wobbling.

**Merits**  
- Ultrathin bezel for a seamless dual-monitor experience  
- Flicker-free screen with blue-light reduction for healthier viewing  
- High adjustability to suit different working setups  
- IPS panel ensures consistent colors at wide angles  

**Pitfalls**  
- 60Hz refresh rate, though adequate, isn’t ideal for serious gaming  
- Plastic materials detract slightly from the premium aesthetic  
- Lacks built-in speakers, requiring separate audio solutions  

**Competing Products**  
Every great product has its challengers, and the Dell P2419H isn’t an exception. Compared to the HP 24mh FHD monitor, Dell's three-sided bezel and ComfortView features certainly give it the edge for prolonged tasks. The HP model does roll in built-in speakers, a feature missing from Dell’s offer. Meanwhile, the ASUS VP249QGR might woo gamers with its higher refresh rate but isn’t designed for ergonomic versatility like the Dell. Avid professionals will probably stick with what’s ergonomically superior, while media enthusiasts may weigh refresh rates and speakers higher. Both have their strengths, but the customization and sleekness of this particular model keep it firmly in the running for my uses.

**Bang for the Buck**  
While you won’t find this to be a hyped ultra-high-end monitor, the price-to-quality ratio leaves little room to complain. For what it offers—eye comfort, a lightweight profile, flexibility in motion, and professional-grade aesthetics—it’s quite the solid investment. There are competitors within its price band, but I feel the assortment of features makes it quite forgiving on the wallet while still delivering functionality you can appreciate daily.

1nzo3vz,https://www.reddit.com/r/caffeine/comments/1nzo3vz/why_does_overdosing_on_matcha_hurt_so_much/,Why does “overdosing” on matcha hurt so much?,"I’m usually a coffee drinker with the occasional energy drink too. While it’s probably not the best for me, I’ve been known to consume a *lot* of caffeine at once, and have never experienced anything bad besides shakiness. 

But matcha is completely different.

I’ve gotten free matcha powder on a few occasions for various bizarre reasons, but I like matcha and caffeine is expensive, so I use it. But if I even accidentally heap a bit more on my spoon than I meant to, like 20-30% more than usual, I get horrible side effects. I am so nauseated I cannot function. It feels like there is a lead weight in my stomach with spikes protruding towards my heart. 

The first time this happened I had to throw up twice before I felt okay again. The same happened this morning when I misjudged again, except this time it make me barf involuntarily.

I am not gonna drink this again regardless of the reason because now I associate matcha with nausea, but I have to ask: is there a reason for this? Does it have to do with the type of caffeine or other properties?",5,1759768608.0,caffeine,3,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I am wondering if any of you have had a similar experience with the KBT 1.25L carafe with borosilicate glass. Recently my carafe's glass exploded and leaked coffee all over my counter which then got into my drawers. It was quite the mess! My KBT is less than a year old and I come to find out the carafes are not covered under there warranty. This leads me to believe Moccamaster is very aware of this issue and refuses to correct it.

Moccamaster offered a measly 20% off a replacement carafe. I am pretty upset with this and I am looking for alternative carafes that are double walled steel instead of glass.

Please let me know if you have had any success purchasing an alternative carafe that fits the KBT machine.

Thanks.",2,1759768432.0,Moccamaster,6,1.0,False

Didn't take long to learn things like I need clips on the base plate or it slides. Keep travel times slower to prevent misaligned layers. 
Had a couple successful prints (coffee bag clips, paper towels holder)
Decided to try something much longer and started a dice tower. Was gonna run for a long time so I had to leave it. 
I had crammed all the parts on to the enders base plate, all looked good.... But I forgot to accommodate for the clips. 
Long story slightly shorter .... My in laws came back to a massive blob of plastic over the print head 🤦🤦.
It had knocked the plate off and then just kept going. 
Everything still seems to work, but plastic got up into the beatsink. I'll need to replace the plastic cover for sure, and the silicone cap. does the whole print head assembly need to be replaced? Is there an optimal way to clean everything? (my fil pulled off most of the plastic without heating it, but I was able to get the stuff around d the heat so k off by heating it up for a bit. 
Lesson learned and no serious harm done thankfully 
I'm an idiot tlbut a wiser one now 😅.",5,1759768429.0,3Dprinting,2,1.0,False

It’s Runelite. And I’ll be the first to admit, I’m part of the problem. I came over from RuneScape 3, where I’d do quests with a guide open in one tab, a YouTube video in the other, and a cup of coffee gone cold because I actually read the dialogue, tried to understand the story, and let myself get lost in Gielinor.

When I started Old School RuneScape, everyone told me, “You have to use Runelite. It’s essential.” So I did. And at first, it felt like I’d unlocked the full experience. Every plugin, every overlay, every glowing tile, it all made the world sharper, more efficient, more “optimized.” But then something changed. The more I played, the more I realized I wasn’t really playing anymore.

Runelite hasn’t just made the game easier, it’s made it hollow. I play on mobile sometimes now, and it feels alive again, uncertain, messy, full of mistakes and discoveries. On desktop, I feel like I’m just following instructions. Quests turn into a checklist. Combat becomes mechanical. Players skip dialogue like it’s a YouTube ad. No one is lost anymore, and that’s not a good thing.

Before anyone says, “Then just don’t use Runelite,” that’s not really an answer. The game is built around it now. The community, the guides, the metas, even the content creators all assume you’re using it. If you’re not, you’re automatically slower, less efficient, and often confused because the game design itself hasn’t evolved to compensate. The plugins have quietly become part of the ecosystem. If you refuse to use them, you’re choosing to play with one hand tied behind your back while everyone else runs laps around you.

And sure, people love to say, “That was fifteen years ago, we were kids, this is today.” But that’s the whole point. Back then, the magic worked because we were allowed to be lost. We didn’t have a glowing tile telling us where to stand. We didn’t have a minimap full of efficiency metrics. We stumbled through quests, we misclicked, we died in dumb ways, and that’s what made it unforgettable. Growing up shouldn’t mean stripping the soul out of what made the game special. It should mean appreciating it more.

Runelite turned what used to be a living, breathing adventure into a theme park ride where the rails are painted neon yellow. Everyone’s on the same track, doing the same efficient route, the same meta setup, the same best-in-slot mindset. There’s no friction left, no confusion, no failure, no awe. And without those, the magic of RuneScape dies a little more each day.

When you know where every safe spot is before you even enter a cave, when a plugin tells you exactly when to eat or pray, when a quest helper skips the story for you, are you playing the game anymore, or just watching a machine play it through your hands?

Runelite didn’t just make Old School easier. It made it obedient. And I can’t pretend I’m innocent. I’ve leaned on it too. But after playing on mobile, stripped of all the noise, I can finally see how much of the game we’ve traded away for convenience.

The tragedy is that the people who love this game the most, the ones who want to squeeze every last drop of it, are the ones slowly draining its soul.

**Why This Pick?**



I know the Jaguars are at home, but they’ve lost their last 5 straight encounters with Kansas City by at least a TD. Granted, Jacksonville has looked great so far this season at 3-1, but their schedule has been pretty lax with victories over teams like the Carolina Panthers and the Houston Texans (I will, however, give them their flowers for taking down the 49ers last week…) That said, after watching the Kansas City Chiefs pick up a win over the Baltimore Ravens by more than two TDs, I just can’t see Jacksonville keeping this one within 3. It might not be the prettiest victory, but I’m on Patrick Mahomes & company to cover the spread here.

Here’s the list:

**1. You literally get paid extra to go on holiday.**  
Yeah. You read that right. It’s called *semestertillägg* and it’s basically a bonus for taking time off. The idea is to *encourage* people to actually rest. I think every Brit I’ve met thought this was a joke at first.

**2. Fika isn’t just coffee. It’s religion.**  
We take coffee breaks seriously, and no, it’s not “slacking off”. Fika is about slowing down, chatting with coworkers, and recharging. Productivity actually goes *up* when people take them. Win-win.

**3. You don’t pay into your pension yourself.**  
Your employer handles it. You can add extra savings if you want, but the main pension is already sorted through work. This one blows a lot of people’s minds.

**4. Taxes are high — but transparent.**  
Yes, we pay quite a bit in taxes. But you can literally check where your money goes. Healthcare, parental leave, education… it’s all clear. You don’t feel like you’re just throwing money into a black hole.

**5. Parental leave is insane (in a good way).**  
480 days — that’s *paid* parental leave, shared between both parents. And Swedes actually use it. Dads disappearing for months with the stroller? Totally normal.

So yeah, the cost of living *is* higher, but most of what you’d pay for privately in the UK (healthcare, childcare, uni, etc.) is already built into the system here.",3,1759768176.0,AskNordics,5,0.67,False

One of his female friends had feelings for him, how should I handle this?","My boyfriend (18M) and I (19F) have been dating for about a year. We are long-distance but are only 2 hours apart and see eachother about once a month. Last May, a girl at his college confessed that she has feelings for him. He had tutored her throughout the semester, but she didn’t know he had a girlfriend and was very apologetic when he told her. She said she hoped they could be friends. They weren’t very close at the time, but he told me he wouldn’t become friends with her because I was uncomfortable.

This semester, he’s made a lot of new friends and they happen to be very close with this girl. She’s in the group chat they have together and he started hanging out with her, but never 1 on 1. I initially said it was all good and just asked that he let me know when he was with her (we text eachother throughout the day anyways and normally update eachother on what we’re doing). He started hanging out with her in a group of 3 and didn’t tell me about it for a week. I think he was worried I would be anxious about it. He eventually told me because her and his friend drove 30 minutes to bring him coffee at work and he felt guilty about hiding it from me. I was pretty hurt that he didn’t tell me initially and said I feel less comfortable with the situation because he wasn’t open about it from the start. However, he doesn’t want to cut her off because he enjoys her company and can’t really avoid her in his new friend group anyways. They were all friends with her before him.

I’m not entirely sure what to do in this situation. I feel a bit hurt that he wants to hang out with her despite me being uncomfortable with it, but I also feel like it’s controlling for me to tell him who he can and can’t be friends with. He said that he would only hang out with her in groups of 3+, and doesn’t seem to think she still has feelings for him.

He also just asked to cut back on calls because he’s been very busy lately and wants more free time. I think this is totally reasonable but it’s contributing to my worry that he may be pulling back from our relationship.

I completely trust him and don’t think there’s any possibility of him cheating. I’m not sure why I still feel this way when I know he wouldn’t do anything. Do you guys have any advice on how to handle this situation? How do I learn to be comfortable with it?

1nznv5v,https://i.redd.it/fs7axm8zpitf1.jpeg,Stop Waiting 5 Minutes for Your PC to Start! A Simple Guide to Taming Startup Programs (Windows),"Is your computer taking an absolute age to boot up, making a cup of coffee seem faster? You're not alone! A super common culprit is an army of startup programs you didn't even know were running. They fight for resources the moment Windows loads, dragging your speed down.
Here’s the quick and easy fix that can shave minutes off your boot time—no sketchy downloads required!
🛠️ The Fix: Declutter Your Digital Garage
Step 1: Open the Task Manager
Right-click on your Taskbar (the strip at the bottom of your screen).
Select Task Manager from the menu.
Pro Tip: You can also use the keyboard shortcut: \text{Ctrl} + \text{Shift} + \text{Esc}.
Step 2: Navigate to the Startup Tab
In the Task Manager window, click on the Startup tab.
(If you only see a small window, click ""More details"" at the bottom left first).
Step 3: Identify the Offenders
Look for the column titled Startup impact. This is your key metric.
Programs listed as High or Medium are the biggest drain on your system's boot process. Common culprits include: Adobe updater services, Spotify, Steam, Discord, printer utilities, and some cloud storage apps like OneDrive or Google Drive.
Step 4: Disable the Unnecessary
Crucial Rule: Only disable programs you recognize and don't need to run the moment you log in.
Example: You don't need Discord to start until you actually want to chat.
Click on the program you want to stop starting automatically.
Click the Disable button in the bottom right corner of the Task Manager.
⚠️ What NOT to Disable: Be cautious! Leave essential system items like Windows Security, your antivirus software, or things from hardware manufacturers (like Realtek Audio) enabled unless you are certain they aren't necessary. When in doubt, leave it enabled.
Step 5: Enjoy Your Faster PC!
Close the Task Manager and reboot your computer. You should notice a significant speed improvement right away!

1nznuyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1nznuyu/a_real_of_what/,A Real Of What?,"""Often in life, we think of people and events as random things. But what we forget to feel is that the guy sitting next to you on the metro in Delhi or the woman scrolling through reels on her phone also has free will, destiny, and a real life with maybe thousands of different connections...""

2021 was the year the world was recovering from a global pandemic. Vaccines, deaths, and politics were clashing, laughing at the misery of the common man. Not everyone was living life to the fullest, but certainly, a section of society who either had generational wealth or good connections was thriving. Waking whenever they wanted, experimenting with different dishes and types of cuisine, then enjoying a movie or maybe scrolling through brain-rot videos. And how could I forget the important part: 'GAMING,' the soul of boredom killers.

With these things going on, here comes Kashaya, a guy in his early 20s, very much fitting into the background portrayed above. But what makes Kashaya different is ""Thoughts."" He thinks a lot-not something ordinary like 'How much should I mix my coffee to make a better Dalgona, but deeper thoughts like 'Why am I thinking?"". We can say Kashaya was high without being intoxicated. A true introvert and a nerd, looking for topics, learning about them, and writing about them in his diary called ""Pacific.""

But he was never heard.

Obviously, a guy asking existential questions instead of weed origins is a threat to society. So he had no friends. One day, Kashaya thought of an idea: ""Why not connect with people online?"" But differently-not to connect with like-minded people, but just to connect with people.

A few months passed, talking to strangers on Reddit, Zuckerberg's apps, and more. He felt dumber than ever. It's a tough situation. Kashaya couldn't find peace with the people he met, and the people he met were right too-living life ""normally"": wake up, eat, maybe some porn, criticize people, sleep. Nothing wrong with it, yet something felt missing.

One day, he found an app on the App Store claiming voice and video calls with strangers. Kashaya felt an urge-excitement. After battling his thoughts, he decided: ""Let's do it.""

27 April 2021, he downloaded the app. Meeting random strangers, getting to know their grief, regrets, and fantasies. It wasn't easy for an introvert, but he did it. On his 37th or 38th call, he met Subhani, a 27-year-old clinical psychologist from Bangalore.

Subhani was different. She actually listened-not out of pity, but because she found his ideas passionate and fascinating. Kashaya, though cautious, found himself discussing things he loved. They talked for four hours non-stop-relationships, aspirations, emotions. He couldn't believe someone could listen to him without seeing his face.

Being physically attractive, Kashaya was used to people behaving in certain ways to gain his attention or abandoning him to protect their egos. But this was different. This was Subhani. They began talking every day.

Time flew. On June 3rd, Subhani asked if Kashaya would like to meet. He agreed, though lockdowns and distance (Delhi to Bangalore) were obstacles. They promised to meet as soon as possible. Finally, on October 3rd, they met in Bangalore.

Meeting face-to-face, they laughed, shared cold coffee, and talked. Kashaya was surprised-Subhani never mentioned she was 5'10"". Sitting there, laughing, they said, ""What if life was this beautiful forever?""

Kashaya admitted, ""It may sound awkward, but I think I'm interested in women who are more mature."" Subhani, being a psychologist, linked it to childhood issues and let it pass. Kashaya confessed his past-having physical intimacy with women in their 30s. He said women were like treasure chests, needing the right key to open, after which he took what he needed and left.

Subhani realized he was unique-a master manipulator and mind gamer. As a psychologist, she decided to study him for her upcoming seminar on mentality, morality, and narcissism.

Later that evening, Kashaya roamed around Subhani's society and bumped into Rashmi, a woman in her 40s, a divorced Delhiite. They bonded over ""Chole-Bhature"" and agreed to meet at 10 AM the next day.

Kashaya returned to Subhani, told her about Rashmi, and they went to sleep-he on the couch, she in her room.

The next morning, Kashaya met Rashmi, and over ""Chole-Bhature,"" they talked deeply. Rashmi shared her story: her husband cheated, she lost custody of her child, and traveled extensively to heal. Kashaya admired her.

Somehow, two hours into the conversation, they kissed and made love.

At 3 PM, Kashaya returned to Subhani's place. She noticed he looked messy but ignored it. They went sightseeing as planned, had fun, and enjoyed a meal.

At 9 PM, Subhani received a call from her dad:

Dad: ""Hey darling, how are you?""

Subhani: ""I'm good, just busy with work.""

Dad: ""Take care of yourself, you are more important than anything.""

Subhani: ""Thanks, Dad.""

Dad: ""By the way, your mom is now in Bangalore. Go meet her.""

Subhani: ""Okay, text me the address.""

Later, she received the address. Shockingly, it was the same society she lived in. She lived in 'B' block, her mom in 'D' block.

The next morning, her last day in Bangalore, Subhani planned to visit her mother and casually asked Kashaya to accompany her. He agreed.

As they walked towards the flat, Kashaya's gut twisted. This was Rashmi's place.

Before entering, Kashaya grabbed Subhani's hand and said, ""There's a problem. Rashmi is your mother. I had physical relations with her.""

Subhani froze. She could hear everything and nothing at once. She ran toward the flat, cried uncontrollably, blaming herself.

Meanwhile, Kashaya stayed calm, even slightly pleased. A true sadist.

Knowing it was dangerous to stay, Kashaya packed his things. Before leaving, he asked Subhani, ""Did you feel bad?"" a cruel, twisted question. He left for the airport.

On the flight back to Delhi, Kashaya felt uneasy. In the washroom, he threw up and collapsed. Turns out the water he drank from the taxi was poisoned by Subhani.

By the time the flight landed, Kashaya was dead.

Subhani, drowning in grief and guilt, visited her mother's flat. There, she found another woman. Confused, she learned Rashmi was not her biological mother but a woman her real mother met during her travels. They pooled money to buy the flat together.

Finally, Subhani asked Rashmi if she ever had relations with a younger man. Rashmi shrugged and said, ""Yes, and I don't really care. I live how I want.""

At that moment, Subhani's real mother, Sushma, entered and asked, ""Who is this girl?""

Subhani, breaking down, replied, ""This girl is a dumb murderer,"" and cried.

1nzntc2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nzntc2,"Week around New York, in review: Torrisi, Monkey Bar, Russ & Daughters, Culture Espresso, breweries and way more!","*Scrolling through this post, considering this is a foodie sub, you may be shocked at the overall lack of places I visited given I had the equivalent of four full days of eating time in NYC area plus another day in Brooklyn. This was a surprise to me as well. With two days in the office (no-man's land for places I planned to visit), some poor planning on my part (going at 2:15 to places that close at 2 p.m.) and not wanting to over-fill myself to the point I couldn't enjoy dinners, I put myself in a less-than-ideal position to maximize my taste testing. Will do better when I plan to go back next year. Regardless...*

Here's a look at every place I visited on my recent, extended trip.

# Manhattan

*OK*, *the main event ...*

**Brown Bag Sandwich Co.** ... walked around for hours, forgot to eat. Originally planned to go to Pop Up Bagels or Leon's Bagels but both were closed by the time I got there. Luckily, I had Brown Bag on my list and figured I'd eat at Washington Square Park. Got the chopped cheese, no tomato, added crispy onions. Excellent sandwich and one of the most satisfying meals of my trip. Adding the crispy onions for $1 is a must (IMO) as it provides a necessary textural contrast. Will definitely be going back here.

**Russ & Daughters (2X)** ... I was staying nearby, and with my office quite far away, I didn't have a chance to go to any ""better"" places when it comes to bagels, specifically. Saw suggestions on here to order the bialy instead -- less bread, more concentration on the high-quality salmon. Tremendous call. Despite it being busy, the folks behind the counter were amazing. The pastrami cured salmon was a revelation. Tried two different types of smoked salmon (Scottish, Norwegian) that were outstanding. It's the best smoked/cured salmon I've ever had in my life, and I've had a lot of it. The black & white cookie was basic and not what I consider ""ideal"" from NYC.

**Monkey** **Bar** ... Normal 8 p.m. reservation through Resy. Seated at a table, which allowed for a viewing of the atmosphere but felt a bit less of a part of it. Banger after banger. Whitefish caesar salad stood out for its uniqueness. King crab rangoon were the best version of that dish I've ever tried. French dip was extremely strong as a sharable; would not want it as my main meal. Truffle mac & cheese some of the best I've ever eaten. The burger was excellent, but by the time we got to it, it felt less special and unique than the rest of the meal. (Never had 4 Charles or Au Cheval to compare.) The chocolate pie was the shocking standout for me -- an expertly executed, perfect dessert. Would love to go back but must would obviously prefer to try 4 Charles at some point first.

**Minetta Tavern** ... Late 10 p.m. reservation through Resy -- purposeful because I was going to Comedy Cellar after. From an expectation vs. reality standpoint, the best meal I had this trip. Bread service with the flaky salt ... I had to actively stop myself from eating the whole basket. As a solo diner, I was given a free glass of champagne without asking, and it was great. Black Label Burger was possibly the best ""normal"" burger I've ever eaten (in that, it was not loaded with sauces and toppings). I did add cheese, which the waitress said was common and would not too much affect the taste of the meat. (She was right.)

People described the meat as ""funky,"" which gave me pause in ordering. My waitress insisted, and I'm glad she did. It was just mature with a flavor profile that rose far beyond the basic 80/20 or 75/25 blend you get at most places. I'd rather eat the Black Label Burger than any wagyu stuff out there (though, again, I have not tried 4C). I'm also very much a caramelized onions on burger guy. I did not want to get the bone marrow as it looked like a huge portion and I heard it ""runs through you."" Plus, I'm not sure I'd have liked it. The French onion soup was the best of its kind I've had, but I did wish there was more soup and fewer onions. The chocolate soufflé is an absolute must. Again, best of its kind that I've ever eaten. Blew me away to the same level as the burger. Beyond all of that, from the hostess to the front  
of house manager to the waitress to the doorman ... impeccable service, tremendous atmosphere ... you felt as if you were dining somewhere special at Minetta. A must-return place for me.

**Danny & Coop's Cheesesteaks** ... Not only did I have zero plans to eat here, there were so many other places I wanted to go for lunch on this day. However, I visited Mr. Throwback, and while in the area got stuck in back to back phone meetings for work. Figured better to get this and go to Thompson Square Park than pick some random place. Was this a good cheesesteak? Yes. Was it anything special? Absolutely not. The overly-sesame seeded roll completely overpowered the deliciousness contained within. It was the ""worst"" thing I ate in NYC by a significant margin despite still being tasty. Regret this one.

**The Pastry Box** ... I planned to eat a bunch of cookies (chocolate chip, black & white) but again didn't get to all the places I wanted. My travels put me in the East Village, and I'm so happy they did because this was the best chocolate chip cookie I had on the whole trip. While it's the more thin variety, the chocolate was super high quality, there was an overall richness and decadence to it and the flaky sea salt put it over the top. Apparently this is the first Black-owned bakery in the EV in a long time, and I believe I heard somewhere it wasn't getting enough support? Insanity to me because I'd go out of my way to get this cookie. And I would never order fewer than 2 in the future. (The black & white is not traditional -- frosting too hard, cookie not thick enough -- and completely skippable.)

**Culture Espresso** ... Went to the one by Madison Square Garden. Line out the door with people ordering boxes of the chocolate chip cookies along with coffee. The cookie is really, really good, and I certainly understand those who say it is their favorite. For me, it was too thick and not ideal. In fact, they have their own unique take on a black & white that I thought was better, apples to apples. The Arnold Palmer was a pleasant surprise and super refreshing, though I didn't get to try the blood orange version. Would definitely come back to get the cookies and drink ... if I passed by one.

**Torrisi** ... Late reservation via Resy (only time available). The main event of my trip as my last dinner in NY ... appropriately so. One of the best meals I've had in my entire life to the point it exceeded my sky-high expectations. Cavatelli with Jamaican beef was phenomenal. Raviolini with prawns was phenomenal. Tortellini pomodoro was my friend's favorite by a mile; I loved it -- melted in your mouth -- but I found the other pastas more unique and intriguing. The dover sole francese is an absolute must get. I'll order it whenever I'm lucky enough to go back. The duck was sold out, but the chicken was recommended, and it was delicious. Some of the crispiest, tastiest skin I can remember.

And then the affogato. Holy crap. I'm not a ""hot fudge"" or ""sundae"" guy ... but I could have eaten this entire glass by myself -- twice. It's almost like a mix between an affogato and tiramisu without lady fingers. The gelato, fudge and slushee espresso on top were all incredible individually; together, they made for a one-of-a-kind dessert that I was so happy we ordered. The service was outstanding and the overall atmosphere had an air of sophistication that actually surprised the way some people in attendance were dressed -- more down than I'd have expected would be allowed.

**Il Laboratorio del Gelato** ... Went here on a total whim to get something cold while walking all day. What a treat. Did not know anything about it prior to walking by, but you can tell a significant investment was put into this place from a build-out standpoint. Got the chocolate birthday cake and cookies & cream, but there are dozens of varieties available.

**Golden Diner** ... 10 a.m. reservation via Resy. Everyone waiting in line was visibly jealous, but it was not difficult to get ... so yeah ... just get a reservation. The honey butter pancakes were, of course, great. If I had nothing else to do that day, I'd have scarfed both down and not thought twice about it. However, I also ordered the scallion egg sandwich, which was the better overall item by comparison, and ate every bite of that. If Golden HOF has the same pancakes, I'd suggest going there and having them as a more-savory dessert as opposed to a singular breakfast/brunch item. However, that egg sandwich was so good that I have to go back and get it again.

Service here left something to be desired. It felt like the entire goal was to churn tables as quick as possible. I asked for the pancakes to be (at least slightly) delayed from the sandwich and was basically denied. They came out together. As a solo diner, that was tough. But I get it. Gotta capitalize on the popularity. In and out in like 32 minutes. For that much food, it really felt rushed.

# Brooklyn

**L'Industrie Pizza** ... [review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1no0n6i/lindustrie_was_good/). TLDR: Really good but nothing worth waiting in line to eat. Forgot to mention in the original review that the chocolate chip cookie was quite good. Did not try the soft serve as they did not have the flavor I wanted. Tip: Go at 2 p.m. to avoid a line.

**Lilia** ... The plan was to go to Emily, which blew me away *the last time I visited. It was going to be my only repeat meal.* Buddy insisted we go to Lilia instead as he was shocked to be able to get a reservation. Fantastic staff. Housemade mozzarella an absolute must but cacio e pepe frittelle skippable. Sheep's milk cheese agnolotti was the standout of the all-pasta meal we had. Not a huge fan of clams in general but these almost won me over. The Italian Job gelato was a perfect way to finish the meal. Not the best dinner on my trip, but I understood his insistence in going there. Definitely suggest visiting.

**Round Table Brewery** ... Great hole-in-the-wall spot around the corner from L'Industrie. Less pretentious than the other breweries I visited and more like what I'm used to at home -- chill, casual, great beer. Enjoyed the beer here more than the other spots I visited. It sounded like they need more community support. Please go and give them a chance.

**Other Half Brewing (Domino Park)** ... It was nice to drink outside across the street from the park. Not sure about the rules or legalities of possibly taking beer from there to the park (whether pouring into a plastic cup or just buying cans and drinking outdoors) as I don't live in NYC, but that would be more ideal than staying on site. Inside was soulless, but outside was social and nice. But it's a corporate brewery with 10 locations, so perhaps I'm being unfair. Would visit again with a different plan.

**Evil Twin Brewing (DUMBO)** ... For a more lively place I visited at a later hour, it was odd how cold the bartenders acted. This was more cozy with better overall beer, and it felt much more like you were in NY with the hustle & bustle outside and inside. Would visit again.

# Queens

*I was here for a work trip involving planned dinners and therefore only visited one place of my own volition. Really wanted to go to New Park Pizza but never got there.*

**The Local Press** ... Went here on a whim, and it was the most pleasant surprise of my week outside NYC. Buffalo chicken egg rolls and roadside burger were bangers. The basic mac & cheese left something to be desired. Badly wanted to try the chicken & waffles but only had so much room. Good dude running the place and an awesome option if you are in the area.

**RW Prime** ... Steak and burger were mediocre at best. The honey truffle buffalo chicken lollipops were surprisingly good and saucy. I bet the West side of the menu is better than the East side, but after one dinner, I wasn't going to go back and try it. The bread service rolls may well have been frozen -- even the butter was weird. Zero atmosphere. Better places to spend money.

**Sugar Factory** ... I repeat, I *had planned dinners that were not my choice.* This place was a joke. I'd rather eat at the Popeyes in the food court because at least I'd be getting fresh chicken. I haven't eaten at chain restaurants in years, but every other one ... Chili's, Friday's, Outback, Cheesecake Factory ... whatever ... every other one has better food than this. Go to bed without dinner instead of eating here.

**Bonus -- Yankee Stadium concessions** ... Lucky enough to go to a wild card game, unplanned, with a couple friends. Was surprised how many different hot dogs existed. Big Nathan's and Sabbrett fan growing up ... the Sabbrett was the best of the bunch. The chicken finger bucket and/or cup deal is obviously a pure gimmick. There's nothing special about them. Fine but frozen. Really wanted to try one of the special burgers but never got around to it. The lines were crazy even deep into the game.

# [O’Hare International Airport (ORD)](https://www.flychicago.com/ohare/home/pages/default.aspx)

[O’Hare is a massive operation with over 80 million passengers every year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Hare_International_Airport). It’s one of the busiest airports in the world, with flights to more than 200 destinations. There are four terminals in total. Terminals 1, 2, and 3 handle most domestic flights, while Terminal 5 is used for almost all international arrivals and departures.

For people traveling from [North Shore](https://www.discreetlimousine.com/top-rated-north-shore-black-car-and-limo-service-chicago-il),[ Lake Forest](https://www.discreetlimousine.com/top-rated-limo-service-and-black-car-service-lake-forest-il), [Schaumburg](https://www.discreetlimousine.com/schaumburg-service), [Elgin](https://www.discreetlimousine.com/elgin-limo-service-elgin-airport-transportation), [St Charles](https://www.discreetlimousine.com/st-charles-il-black-car-and-limo-service-top-rated-chauffeur-service), [Barrington,](https://www.discreetlimousine.com/top-rated-barrington-limo-and-black-car-to-ohare-midway-and-private-jet-fbo) [Long Grove](https://www.discreetlimousine.com/top-rated-long-grove-limo-and-black-car-service-and-buffalo-grove-limo-and-black-car-service), [Palatine](https://www.discreetlimousine.com/top-rated-palatine-limo-and-black-car-service), or [Arlington Heights](https://www.discreetlimousine.com/top-rated-arlington-heights-limo-service), the average trip time to O’Hare is between 30 and 60 minutes, depending on traffic. Our chauffeurs are all licensed and permitted for commercial airport access, which allows them to use specific professional pickup zones not open to rideshares.

We always recommend giving yourself extra time, especially for early morning flights or during Chicago’s busy winter season. **Our chauffeurs & team track flights in real time and adjust accordingly so you’re never left waiting at the curb or feeling rushed.** Every one of our drivers has passed an FBI fingerprint background check and is professionally insured and trained for airport procedures, so you can relax knowing your ride is handled by someone experienced and vetted.

If you’re flying internationally, one advantage of using a licensed limousine company is that **at Terminal 5**, **only limos and taxis are allowed to pick up passengers curbside**. Rideshares like Uber and Lyft cannot pick up there. They require you to take the Airport Transit System tram to a different terminal for pickup. With a professional chauffeur, you can skip that extra step entirely and head straight out of customs to your waiting car.

Inside O’Hare, travelers have some surprisingly good food options. Terminal 1 has Tortas Frontera by Rick Bayless, which is a local favorite. Terminal 3 has Publican Tavern, and Terminal 5 offers a mix of international flavors, including Big Bowl and Wow Bao. The airport even has a yoga room and an aeroponic garden that grows herbs used in some of the restaurants on site.

Fun fact: O’Hare covers over seven thousand acres, and the airfield has eight runways, more than any other airport in the country.

# [FAQs about O’Hare](https://www.discreetlimousine.com/top-rated-chicago-ohare-limo-black-car-service)

**Q: How early should I arrive for my flight?**

**Q: What’s the best time to fly to avoid delays?**  
Generally, flights before 9 a.m. have fewer delays because air traffic builds up throughout the day.

**Q: Do chauffeurs monitor flight changes?**  
Yes. Our team tracks flights in real time, adjusting pickup times automatically if your plane lands early or late.

**Q: How early should I arrive for my flight?**

# [Midway Airport (MDW)](https://www.flychicago.com/midway/home/pages/default.aspx)

[Midway serves about 22 million passengers each year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midway_International_Airport) and is a favorite for Southwest Airlines travelers. It’s located about ten miles southwest of downtown Chicago, and while it’s smaller than O’Hare, it can still get busy, especially during holiday seasons.

From the North Shore and Northwest suburbs, Midway can take a bit longer to reach because you have to go through or around the city. On average, trips from Schaumburg, [South Elgin](https://www.discreetlimousine.com/south-elgin-il-black-car-and-limo-service-top-rated-chauffeur-service), [North Barrington](https://www.discreetlimousine.com/north-barrington-and-lake-barrington-il-black-car-and-limo-service-top-rated), [Barrington,](https://www.discreetlimousine.com/barrington-il-corporate-limo-black-car-service-and-executive-transportation) [Deerfield](https://www.discreetlimousine.com/top-rated-limo-and-black-car-service-in-deerfield-il), [Hoffman Estates](https://www.discreetlimousine.com/top-rated-hoffman-estates-limo-service-and-black-car-service), [Sleepy Hollow](https://www.discreetlimousine.com/sleepy-hollow-limo-service-and-airport-transportation) or [Glencoe](https://www.discreetlimousine.com/top-rated-glencoe-limo-service-and-best-black-car-service-in-glencoe-il) take around an hour and a half with light traffic. Our chauffeurs plan routes carefully and monitor city traffic in real time to make sure you arrive with plenty of time to spare.

Many of our [corporate clients](https://www.discreetlimousine.com/corporate-travel) flying out of Midway appreciate that our drivers are trained to navigate city drop-offs smoothly, even when traffic is heavy. Our vehicles are kept spotless and maintained to commercial standards, with every one of them insured well above basic requirements.

Unlike rideshares that may cancel or reroute during peak hours, our corporate fleet operates on confirmed reservations. Your driver is assigned well in advance, professionally dressed, and in communication with our central office so you’re never left waiting at the curb.

Another tip many travelers don’t realize is that Midway’s pickup zones are tighter than O’Hare’s. There’s far less space for rideshare and black car pickups, so working with a company that has the proper airport permits and an experienced chauffeur makes a big difference. We always track flight schedules and stay in communication with arriving passengers to make curbside pickups faster.

Midway is also convenient for downtown meetings or connecting flights out of PWK or DPA. If your plans include business trips or group travel, we can arrange multi-stop service between airports to simplify your day.

Fun fact: Midway was once the busiest airport in the world before O’Hare opened in the 1960s, and it still holds the record for one of the shortest runways used for commercial jets.

# FAQs about Midway

**Q: Is parking easy at Midway?**

Parking fills quickly, especially on weekends. It’s one reason many travelers prefer using professional car service.

**Q: What’s the best time to arrive?**  
You should plan to arrive two hours before your flight, especially since TSA lines can stretch into the main concourse during peak times.

**Q: Are there direct pick-up points for limousines?**  
Yes, Midway has a dedicated commercial vehicle lane, allowing licensed chauffeurs to pick up right outside the terminal doors for faster entry.

# [Chicago Executive Airport (PWK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Executive_Airport)

Chicago Executive Airport in Wheeling is one of the top private jet airports in the Midwest. It handles more than 80,000 aircraft operations a year, mostly private and corporate flights. If you live in places like Lake Forest, [Northbrook,](https://www.discreetlimousine.com/top-rated-limo-service-and-black-car-service-in-northbrook) [Winnetka,](https://www.discreetlimousine.com/top-rated-winnetka-limo-service-and-black-car-service) or Glenview, PWK is probably the most convenient option for private travel.

**Our chauffeurs regularly handle pickups and drop-offs at both Signature Flight Support and Atlantic Aviation,** the two main FBOs on site. These terminals are designed for VIP travel, and our licensed chauffeurs have clearance to pull right up to hangar entrances for discreet boarding.

PWK is also a favorite for last-minute business flights because it allows quick departures without the long TSA lines found at larger airports. We work closely with FBO staff to coordinate timing so clients can go directly from vehicle to aircraft in minutes.

Fun fact: The airport was originally built in the 1920s and was once called Palwaukee Airport, a name that came from combining Palatine and Milwaukee Avenue.



# FAQs about PWK

**Q: Can anyone fly from Chicago Executive?**

Yes. There are charter services open to the public for private and shared flights.

We’ve driven passengers to **Milwaukee (MKE), Madison, South Bend, Indianapolis, and even Detroit** when connecting flights failed.  
If you get stranded or need to reach another city fast, booking a professional chauffeur instead of trying to piece together multiple flights is often cheaper, safer, and faster.

During heavy snow, fog, or airline delays, we often help passengers re-route by car to nearby airports such as **Milwaukee (MKE)** or **South Bend (SBN)**. Sometimes it’s faster and less stressful to drive than to wait hours for a rescheduled flight.

This same spot in the shopping center with the police station/Star pharmacy has seen a Fly Boys restaurant, a Hibachi place, Krab Kingz and now Just Love Coffee come and go all within, what? 10 years? 

The sign on their door says they are closed ‘temporarily but have no timetable for reopening’ . I can’t find any of their social media accounts active anymore and the main ‘Just love Coffee’ Facebook account has made no mention of this location since it closed a month or so ago….IMO it doesn’t look good for it coming back, but maybe I’m wrong and they are just renovating and bad at communication or something? 

Anyone know anything about what’s going on with it? It’s only been open just a little over a year.
