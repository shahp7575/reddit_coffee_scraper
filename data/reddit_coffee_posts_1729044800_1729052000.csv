I am very successful yet no woman has ever wanted to date me. Probably because all women are whores who only want sex so they can baby trap successful men such as myself. 

Anyways, I was perusing tinder when my eyes were graced by a beautiful petite asian woman. I immediately recognized her as a lowley hotel worker which is such a shame because she was quite enchanting. 

I prepared a loquacious text asking her to get coffee, however she dared to tell me that she was ""too tired"" after working at her ""job"" (I consider her job meanial at best, not very hard work at all so she should not be as tired she claimed) and that she didn't want to get coffee.

I decided to let it slide. Once. Well reddit, it happened again. I asked her so kindly to get coffee with me and she told me she was too tired from work and that she wanted to sleep. I was quietly enraged and promptly reached out to my associates and other successful business friends that happened to own the hotel and asked them for some information. 

As I thought, she was a lazy liar. She had one day off and did not work very hard at all. So I decided to throw her a bone one more time as I thought she was very petite and beautiful. 

I asked her out for coffee and she DENIED me! She used the same old probably false claim as before. I was so enraged I immediately blocked her number and decided to call the authorities.

The police could not assist me so I took it up with her manager. Apparently I, a very successful and important man, filing a complaint against her, a low-clas groveling disrespectful bitch, did not go over well with her management and she was promptly fired. 

What I didn't know was that she was here in my country on a work visa! No work no work visa!! The immigration police in my country acted swiftly and she found out they were trying to deport her. Karmas a bitch! 

Well on that very same day she started blowing up my phone begging for a job because she knows I am very successful and wealthy and could find her immediate employment due to my status immediately. 

I chuckled to myself as I gleefully told her that she did not give me (a nice, lovely, caring, successful, guy) a chance and that now she would reap the consequences. Play stupid games win stupid prizes!! 

Now she might actually have to go back to whatever 4th world country she came from but I don't feel bad. She is stupid and ugly and fat anyways.

First breakup,cuz of me (complicated), Second breakup cuz of her but i don't blame her for that.

Fast forward to this year (2024) with 1 year gap of not talking or texting each other (2023) we started texting each other again and i invited her to grab a coffee as friends of course and she gladly accept the invitation,talking about our lives now and suddenly she brings this topic about marriage and said something like ""u know, i don't wanna go to your parents house if we get married (jokingly)""

I was so taken aback by that joke that i started to developed feelings for her again atm but decided to just forget about it and staying friends. But then things got really idk chaotic? Cuz then outta nowhere both of us started saying stuff to each other on text like her saying ""wyd? Wanna get out?"" And i said ""no"" and she said ""wow,i thought you wanna marry me.."" like wtf is going on?

Genuinely, i still do have some feelings for her but this feelings wasn't the same as before,like i don't felt the sparks like the first time i met her anymore.

Here is his bio written by his current caretaker, who knows him best: 

Bowser is a beautiful 10-12 month old male husky weighing around 40 lbs. He was found as a stray in July, and taken in by a local family in San Antonio, Texas. He is a fast learner, and in just a short time, he's now kennel trained and house broken. If you love him, he'll love you right back, and wherever you are, he is sure to be right beside you. He gets along well with other dogs. He loves to play fetch, and go on walks, and I must add he walks very well on a leash. He loves water; if there's a pool outside, he'll probably jump right in to cool off. He loves car rides, and he'll really enjoy it if you take him to get a pup cup from your favorite coffee joint. He is a truly special dog who has overcome so much, and we want to see him go to a forever home where he will be loved and cared for the way he deserves.

Please reach out to me ASAP if you are interested in giving Bowser a beautiful forever home. Out-of-state applicants welcome but note that you'll need to be able to cover transport.

This can be kinda intimidating and honestly not very fun. 

I think a casual meet up group or something where folks 20's-30's can do plant swap events, casual plant id hikes / bio blitzes, hang out at a coffee shop talk about houseplants, study for CA botanist certificates, group nursery tours, etc. would be a fun thing. Keep it judgement free, kick out the jerks, and meet people with similar interests would help build a fun little community.

1g4qstm,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1g4qstm/rogriefs_grace_chapter_1_hope_amid_loss/,[RO]Griefs Grace - Chapter 1: Hope Amid Loss,"The office was clean. It smelled of pinesol and whatever floral candles they had burning around the small room. The magazines stacked on the table in the waiting room were as bleak as ever. 

“Marcus?” a woman asked from the doorway, clipboard in hand. She scanned her eyes around the room until they laid upon me. The only person here, dumbass. “Are you Marcus?” she asked. Calm down, she has to verify. Plus, she's going to ask you a bunch of questions anyway, that's what a therapist does. I nodded and she waved me into the room. 

When I stepped through the door, the scent of lavender and chamomile hit my nose suffocatingly. Peering around the room, I wondered who encouraged this decoration. God, that wall color is fugly. This better go quick. As long as I don’t get thrown into some in-patient facility, I'll be fine.

“Okay, I’m Dr. Marlen, please have a seat and we’ll go ahead and get started.” I wordlessly took a seat. Say something you weirdo. 

“How long will this take?” I need to get back home. I'm exhausted and want to sleep. I’m not even sure how this session was supposed to help me, but I heard it was supposed to make you feel better. Maybe this will help the guilt. 

“Not long. We just have to sit here and talk for an hour, then you'll be on your way. Can you start by telling me your date of birth?” She clicked her pen thrice, ready to fill out the paperwork. One click would have been enough.

“March 18th, 1986” I said, confirming what was already written on her sheet from the last time I was here making this appointment. This is already starting to feel pointless.

“Okay. Thank you. Why don't you start us off by telling me about your life. Who you are, any significant things, pets, or people in your life, things like that,” she said, a small smile on her face. Remember, she's here to help me, not make fun of me. 

“I guess,” I paused, trying to think of what to say next. What a difficult question to answer. “I'm Marcus. I don't know, I work as a car mechanic. I have 2 dogs, I…” I trailed off, unable to think of things to describe myself. “I don’t know.” I shrugged

“That’s okay. Why don't you tell me about any special people in your life right now.” Marlen said. My mind raced at the thought of answering this question. 

“I guess,” I paused again, taking a breath, “There is a girl. Was. Was a girl. Her name was Chloe.” I said, thinking back about the night I met her. 

*The night quickly brought on a raging storm, forcing me to pick up my pace and hurry home. My aching feet are yelling at me to stop and take a short rest. The rain was coming down with such force, it roared against the pavement. Thunder and lightning barreled through the sky with a ferocity that turned dormant cars to loud panic. Many were warned not to drive tonight as roads quickly turned to rivers. Shit day to not have a car. Damn, I can't wait to get inside.* 

*Two streets from my home, ready to light a cigarette before getting some shut-eye, I noticed the peering brake lights of a car slowly submerging in the merciless water on the road. I could hear the engine scream and shift as they attempted to fight the currents, but it was to no avail. I don't know what they were expecting, fighting this storm in their tiny car. It looked like a Volkswagen. They might as well have been attempting to pull a trailer home on a bicycle. The hazards began to flash brightly, reflecting off the rushing water of the street.*

*By the time I had made it close enough to the car, close enough to see the ugly green paint, the relentless rain and flowing water had completely stalled the car out. I couldn't help but feel bad for the poor soul who would now be spending the rest of their night in this hellish storm. Feeling bad enough, I decided I couldn’t leave them. I make my way into the street, wading into the now knee-deep water and almost being swept off my balance by the current. As I approached the passenger window, hoping not to startle whoever was inside, I tried to make my presence clear. I peered through the window and saw a girl with her head against the steering wheel, clearly sobbing. I couldn’t hear her, but the way her shoulders moved as she sat there defeated said enough. God, I must’ve looked like a real creep. Standing there with a dumbfounded look on my face as I peered through her car window.  When she looked up and saw me, however, she didn’t seem as startled as I suspected, instead surprised and scrambling to reach for the passenger handle and swing open the door for me. Her voice almost drowned out by the rain, it was hard to hear her.*

*“Oh my God! You must be absolutely freezing, get inside!” She said, exasperated but worried. I reluctantly obliged, taking in how cold the rain had gotten in the last few minutes. Not accounting for how soaked I was until I climbed in her car, I felt bad for any potential damage I was about to cause to her seats. “You’re crazy, it’s like 40 degrees outside, and this storm.” She said loudly, smiling through tears still escaping her eyes. I felt an anxiety bubble up in me at her words, feeling like an idiot.*

*“I-” I had begun to speak but was quickly cut off by her again.*

*“What were you thinking? Crazy man.” She laughed, her smiles doing their best to conceal her stress and sadness. I felt my anxiety subside quickly, as the gravity of her situation fully hit me.*

*“What am* I *thinking? You’re the one trying to fight this storm in a Bug!” I motioned to her stalled car.* 

*“Hey, I happen to like ‘Betty’, thank you very much!” She chuckled and slapped her steering wheel.* 

*“Well just for the future, green is a terrible color for a car.” I said matter of factly. She tilted her head at me with a confused, maybe even concerned look on her face.* 

*“Green? You’ve gotta be hallucinating, my car is bright yellow!” She said, confusion and concern in her voice. “Wait, are you…” She put her finger over her mouth as she studied me, deep in thought and amusement growing in her voice as she spoke. I could feel my face heat up, knowing what she was going to say. “Are you color blind?” I nodded my head in embarrassment, confirming her suspicions. Her face began to glow with a sense of bewilderment. It was strange how she reacted. Most people tend to shrug off that little piece of information and pretend like you’ve never said anything about it, but she didn’t. She was looking at me like some kind of rare creature you only hear about in fantasy stories. I watched as she quickly scrambled to find her phone, opening a search engine and typing in a simple word: “Yellow”.*

*This may sound strange, but we sat there for hours. Looking over different shades and hues of yellow and green, she even showed me her exact car color. I don't think either of us realized how much time had passed until she interrupted our ongoing tangent about colors.* 

*“Oh, I never got your name.” She said suddenly. Looking at me with excitement, I felt strange at that moment. As if someone was looking at me as more than just another person.*

*“My name is Marcus.” I replied, holding out my hand to shake hers, but instead was met with a tight embrace.*

*“I’m Chloe, and thank you for staying with me, Marcus. I don’t know what I would've done if I didn't have anyone to talk to tonight.” She said while letting me go.*

*“It’s no trouble.” I laughed. “I didn’t have anything else to do, and it was nice to get out of the rain.”*

*“That's your excuse for helping me? C’mon, give me a story!” She punched my shoulder playfully.*

*As strange as it seems, that was the first night I ever met her, but we talked as if we had been friends for years. We laughed a lot that night, and at some points, she even cried. Apparently, she was having a pretty tough week, and just needed a friend. She told me how her grandmother had just passed away, and how she had come to town for her funeral. She explained how close she and her grandmother were, and even told me how this little car was a gift from her grandmother on her eighteenth birthday, and how much she cherished it no matter how beat up the car had become. She told me stories that opened windows to her melancholy.*

*I guess her comfortability with me ended up rubbing off on me, because I ended up telling her about my own life that night. I told her how my car had broken down two days prior, and I had to walk to work while I was making the money to get it fixed. I told her about how I was struggling to keep my head above the water at the time, and how I even had to give my dog away because I couldn't afford his food regularly. She listened to every word I said like it was the most interesting thing she had ever heard. I remember cursing the morning sun as it peered through the now fading thunderheads, the storm letting up some. I had enjoyed the night so much I didn't want to ever walk away from it, but I knew that getting her car running again was important. The story she told of her grandmother made that very apparent.* 

*Fixing her car again was a pretty easy feat, seeing as the issue was rather small. We pushed the car up the small incline of the street, out of the majority of the water. After fiddling around in the car, I smacked the hood of her car to signal it was working again, and she tried the key in the ignition. The engine roared to life, and she jumped and threw her arms up with excitement.* 

*I’ve always been pretty bad at goodbyes, so I simply gave a slight wave and began to walk towards the sidewalk, water flowing through my shoes once again, but considerably less this time. Before I could fully make it, I felt her grip the sleeve of my still damp jacket and push a small piece of paper into my hand. When I glanced back to see, I was stopped in awe. She was smiling just like she had been when I first got in her car. A few more tears escaped her eyes down her cheeks as she grinned. She hugged me tightly before running back to her car.*

*“Thank you! You’re a lifesaver!” And jumped back into her car. I watched the green- no, yellow Bug cautiously drive down the street and turn left on my street. Coincidence is what I told myself as I continued to walk down. Trudging out of the water onto the sidewalk, I opened my palm to see a crumpled note. I unfolded the note, revealing a phone number etched into it quickly with a pen. As I rounded the corner to my street, my house being the first on the block, I noticed that same, tacky Bug in the driveway next to mine. An elderly woman rushing out of the house to the car, umbrellas in hand. Chloe stepped out of the car, hugged the woman, and walked inside with her.*

“That was the first night I had met the woman of my dreams. I remember every detail of that night as if it were yesterday.” I said, I could feel the smile on my face.

“That's a beautiful story Marcus.” Dr. Marlen said, smiling at me as well. 

“Since then, however, her car has broken down, and it has actually become an ornament on our front lawn for some time. Just over 4 years now. Sometimes, before leaving for work, I install a new piece in the car for her, and she had no idea. This morning, I installed the last part. I wanted to give it to her just nine minutes after midnight for our 10th anniversary.” A wave of nausea washed over me. 

“Well why don’t you? It would be a perfect gift for her,” she said. 

“She's dead.” her face fell. “She was killed in a car accident three years ago. That's why I'm here.” I said matter-of-factly. I wasn’t one to hold back. “My doctor thinks I have become too negative of a person, and it's affecting everything in my life, thinking about Chloe that is. I need to figure out how to not feel so…” My brain stopped thinking for a moment, and I blanked. 

“So lost?” Marlen finished my sentence for me. I shrugged, not knowing if that was the correct word or not. The nausea grew. A long silence blanketed the room, and I could hear the ticking of the clock on her wall, the hum of the lights on her ceiling. Marlen broke the silence first. “What did she look like?” She asked. My throat closed as I thought of Chloe. I felt a sharp pain in the side of my thumb. I looked down, and saw my finger pressed firmly in the skin, nearly tearing it open with my nail. A bad habit of mine. 

“Do you feel anxious thinking about her, Marcus?” She asked, and the pit in my stomach urged me to respond affirmatively. The skin broke on my thumb, and Marlen stood up.

“Most days. And nights. I guess almost all the time?” I don’t know who or even what I was asking. She rummaged through some drawers before emitting a tiny ‘ah’ and presenting me with a small bandaid. I thanked her quietly before unwrapping the bandaid and carefully folding it over my finger. I crumpled the paper that encased the bandaid and fiddled with it between my fingers. Silence fell over us again. Can she hear me playing with this paper? I tapped my heel against the floor, and my stomach settled slightly. What if she can hear this and thinks it's annoying? Stop it. A lump formed in the back of my throat, and I coughed a few times to clear it. It didn’t work. 

I glanced at the clock and noticed our time was almost up. Marlen began to sort through the papers she had written on and tidy them into a neat stack with a couple *tap tap taps* on her clipboard. She began to stand up, and I felt a rush of adrenaline. 

“She was blonde.” I said in a hoarse whisper. I tried to force it out with more volume, more confidence like I wasn't crumbling into pieces right now, but all I could force out was a pitiful few words. I cleared my throat of the lump, and Marlen sat back down. “She had blonde hair.” I said again, this time with more poise. Marlen nodded and folded her hands in her lap, encouraging me to go on. I felt a flutter in my stomach. Not butterflies, though, more like cutting knives. “I would always drown in her beautiful opal eyes. Even when I’d catch her wearing messy pajamas, she'd overshadow any supermodel. When I felt her hand on my shoulder, I'd melt to gold. She was nearly perfect. She had shit taste in movies, though. She was always down to see something by Michael Bay or Dennis Dugan.” I said and laughed, “Also she was an absolute monster in the kitchen. I mean what fucking psycho cooks their pasta in the *microwave*! And she would always correct my grammar if it was wrong, even if we were texting. She had this way of doing things where you could never really be mad at her, but you’d be annoyed. It felt so irritating at the moment, but now, it all feels so trivial.” I looked at Marlen, “You know?” I asked, hoping what I said made any sort of sense. She didn’t look confused, instead, she smiled gently. 

“I appreciate you sharing that with me, Marcus. She seems like a wonderful person.” Marlen sat back and relaxed. I began to feel scared but I'm not sure why. Shouldn’t I feel relieved after sharing things with therapists? That’s how this works isn’t it? I must be doing something wrong. I thought more about Chloe. I could hear her laugh, see her eyes, feel her hair on my face in the mornings, smell her perfume. I could feel everything about her around me. 

“Are you thinking about her again?” Marlen was offering me another Band-Aid and a tissue. I looked down, and I had broken through on another finger. A drop of blood had landed on my pants. I nodded and took it from her before wrapping the cut with it and wiping the blood with the tissue.

“What has your life looked like since she passed? Any relationships since then? Romantic, or not, doesn’t matter.” Marlen brought out the clipboard once more and crossed off things I couldn’t see from where I was seated. She certainly doesn’t beat around the bush.

“Mainly just sitting at home if I'm not at work. Sometimes I'll enjoy a company outing or grabbing some food and drinks with some friends. Occasionally I've gone out with a coworker or two to have drinks. Once it almost worked out romantically, but she didn't want,” I cleared my throat, “Well, a widower.” A sense of guilt rose in me after sharing that last part. “Oh my god, I didn’t mean that as if I were trying to forget Chloe and go after another woman. I just meant,” I struggled to find the right words, “Ya know, sometimes they would remind me of Chloe, right? And I would feel this sense of fulfillment for a moment until it faded, and all I could think about was Chloe again.” I slumped down, feeling defeated in my explanation. I didn’t want to forget Chloe, I just didn’t want to be alone either. A knock sounded at the door, turning both of our attention.

“I apologize Marcus, I’ve allowed for all the extra time I can. My next client is here, but I’d like to see you here again soon, okay? Don’t be a stranger to my office.” She said, standing up and reaching out to shake my hand. I grabbed her hand to reciprocate quickly, and we began to gather our things. I began to walk towards the door before she called after me. “Oh, and Marcus,” She said, “Don’t be afraid of new things. She would want you to be happy.” The door closed behind me with a soft thud. I wasn’t ignoring her, I just needed to get out of there. I said quick goodbyes to the receptionist and whatever dark-haired lady was in the waiting room, and began my walk back to my car. As I descended the stairs to the parking lot, I thought more and more about what Marlen said to me about Chloe. Would she really want me to move on like this? I don’t know. This is so confusing; I didn’t even want to go to this stupid therapy session. My stupid doctor recommended it. This is his fault. 

The sky was a dark blue, almost black. It was about eight at night, so understandably so. The stars haven’t begun to show yet, it’s still too early, and we have too much light pollution here anyway. I got in my car, but for some reason, I couldn’t bring myself to put the key in the ignition. My body was telling me it wasn’t time to go home yet anymore. Thoughts of Chloe flooded my mind. That day in the park when a bee flew in her hair and she screamed like a maniac, I let out a soft chuckle. The time I took her to the aquarium, she stared at the tiger sharks for almost 2 hours straight, telling me everything she knew about them. Days and nights with her played like a movie in my brain, like how your life flashes before your eyes when you die. But I wasn’t dying. I was sitting in my car after a therapy appointment, thinking about my dead wife. I looked at the time, feeling confused. Have I really been sitting out here for an hour? Shit. I picked up my keys from the center console, and held them to the ignition when the sound of an engine not turning over caught my ear. I looked out the passenger window, and saw a woman sitting in her car. The same woman from the waiting room I had passed an hour ago. She must have finished her appointment too. The woman tried the key one more time, getting nothing but a small ticking noise. Dead battery. That sucks. She looked around my age, messy dark hair thrown up haphazardly. Pretty, like Chloe too. 

I went to ignore her and put my key into the ignition, but that same feeling from earlier held me back from turning the key. Marlen’s words rang through my head.

*Don’t be afraid of new things. She would want you to be happy.* I looked back over at her, now resting her head on her steering wheel, driver door open. I knew I had jumper cables somewhere in my trunk, too. Before I could stop myself, I rolled down the window and called out to her. 

“Hey, do you need some help?” I offered. She looked skeptical, but sad at the same time. Almost as if she had just finished crying. I stepped out of my car and grabbed the jumper cables out of the trunk, holding them up like an offering. “I can jump your car for you if you’d like.” She slowly got out of her car and popped the hood, sniffling. 

“Thank you, I would really appreciate the help.” She lifted her hood and presented me with the internals of her engine bay like she was saying to go for it. 

“I'm Marcus, by the way.” I introduced myself and stretched my hand out to her. 

“Nicole. Thank you again.” She shook my hand. 

“I should be able to have you started-up here in a few minutes.” I clamped the red cable onto the positive terminal before connecting it to my car, and the black cable on the negative terminal before doing the same.

“Could you possibly walk me through what you're doing? I don’t know much about cars.” I nodded while smiling and carefully explained each step I took and why. I explained why you had to connect and disconnect the cables in reverse order and what order you had to connect them in. She listened like it was the most important piece of information she had ever received. After explaining the whole process, I started my car and signaled her to turn her car on after a few minutes. On the first attempt, it turned on, and her face molded into that of delight. I disconnected the cables appropriately and closed her hood before letting her know she was all good to head home. 

“Have a good night, Nicole. Maybe I'll see you around some day.” I said as I put the cables back into my trunk. Before I could climb in my car, I felt a soft hand grabbing mine.

“Hey,” She said quietly, “This is a totally crazy thing for me to do but do you maybe want to go get coffee with me sometime? You can totally say no, I know I’m coming across as super creepy right now.” She sped up as she was talking. I could tell she was nervous.

*She would want you to be happy*. Marlens voice was in my head again. Damn that therapist, she's good. This didn’t seem so pointless anymore. Chloe’s smiling face appeared in my mind next, and instead of feeling anxious, or sad, or nauseous, I felt clarity and confidence. It was like she was telling me everything was going to be okay. Butterflies swelled in my stomach instead of knives. 

“I would actually really like that, yeah.” I smiled at her. Maybe with Chloe’s help, I actually can do this.

He was found in very rough shape and underweight in July by a kind person who took him into her home and nursed him back to health. They are thinking he was hit by a car. You will note in the July photos that his leg has a strange disposition. It is now healed and he has full use of his leg. She has other animals and it's not feasible for her to keep him. He needs a good adoptive home ASAP to prevent him from going to the shelter. He is neutered and UTD on vaccines! 

Here is his bio written by his current caretaker, who knows him best: 

Bowser is a beautiful 10-12 month old male husky weighing around 40 lbs. He was found as a stray in July, and taken in by a local family in San Antonio, Texas. He is a fast learner, and in just a short time, he's now kennel trained and house broken. If you love him, he'll love you right back, and wherever you are, he is sure to be right beside you. He gets along well with other dogs. He loves to play fetch, and go on walks, and I must add he walks very well on a leash. He loves water; if there's a pool outside, he'll probably jump right in to cool off. He loves car rides, and he'll really enjoy it if you take him to get a pup cup from your favorite coffee joint. He is a truly special dog who has overcome so much, and we want to see him go to a forever home where he will be loved and cared for the way he deserves.

Please reach out to me ASAP if you are interested in giving Bowser a beautiful forever home. Out-of-state applicants welcome but note that you'll need to be able to cover transport. If you're in the midwest, transport will be around $400.

I take a long time to drink my coffee and as a result sometimes gets cold before I finish it. I don’t mind cold coffee, so I drink it anyway. My BF thinks this is disgusting (he doesn’t like coffee anyway). He told me that he doesn’t want me to drink my coffee that way, because it disgusts him. I told him that it’s me who’s drinking it, why should he care. He insisted that it is disgusting, and “if I don’t want you to drink a cup of coffee around the house, then you don’t” and the good old “my house, my rules”. He compared it to him not wanting guests to smoke in his house, or taking off shoes at the door. However, I told him that those examples are not comparable because secondhand smoke is still harmful and wearing dirty shoes in the house makes the floor dirty for everyone else’s feet. How I drink a cup of coffee does neither. I lost my cool and told him to go F himself for being controlling. AITA?

**OOP Added a quick update Same Pist/Sane Day** 

UPDATE: I showed him the comments and he conveniently came up with the excuse “I am sorry you found it as a controlling act. I said that because, not being used to coffee, I can smell its odour. So I don't want the odour to spread around the house.”. I’ve told him that it’s not a matter of me seeing it that way, he is being controlling and it’s unacceptable. He keeps asking me to explain why, even though I feel like I have about a million times. I said that I’ve explained enough and I’m not interested in talking until he takes responsibility. 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS** 

**StarryMotley** 

>Regarding your update: He's framing this as a matter of your opinion and pretending not to understand in order to avoid admitting what's obvious to everyone on this sub. This is because he already knows he's behaving badly, and is doing it on purpose, and wants to continue doing it, because it benefits him. Big, big, big red flags. Please get away from him. NTA. He's controlling and manipulative. 

**OOP** 

>>Thank you for your input! Can I ask what it is you think he’s benefiting from? 

**StarryMotley** 

>>>He gets to control you. Maybe not on everything, but the longer you stay and the more controlling behavior you tolerate, the more will slip under the radar and the more you'll end up meeting his unreasonable demands. You'll decide--not even consciously--that you would rather do what he wants than fight him on some small issue. And then another small issue. And then a big one. And meanwhile, he will not be making efforts to please and accommodate you. You may even start to question yourself and internalize his viewpoint. 

>>>It's never about cold coffee; it's about power. Manipulators and controlling people never start with ""be my 24/7 maid who I have sex with but who never gets off herself, who gives me children if I'm into that, who isn't allowed to have money or a job or talk to her friends and family and who lives miles or COUNTRIES away from anybody who might help her get out of this abusive relationship."" They don't start there; they start with ""you drink coffee the wrong way"" and ""I'm so very sorry that YOU were irrational about my coffee request."" 

>>>If you had pointed out how many people think he was an asshole about the coffee, and he had gone ""oh wow, yeah, I was being an asshole, I'm sorry"" and then not done it again, then that would be one thing. But what you posted about his response sent chills down my spine. That is not the response of a mostly-well-meaning guy. That is the response of a guy who will twist reality in knots to get what he wants. 

**~** 

**CosmicOceanHorror** 

>Fuck no, that guy sounds like an asshole. He sounds like a chauvinist pig and he doesn't deserve you. 

>Quick question: Surely you knew whether or not you were the asshole before you posted this? 

**OOP** 

>>I was sure that I was not the asshole, but he doesn’t take responsibility and instead assumes it’s because of my past emotionally abusive relationship. 

**failedantidepressant** 

>>>That’s called gaslighting 🚩🚩🚩. 

>>>Your current boyfriend is emotionally abusing you. You’re breaking up with him, right? 

**OOP** 

>>>>I told him about the comments and he said “I am sorry that you found it as a controlling act. I said that because, not being used to coffee, I can smell its odour. So I don't want the odour to spread around the house.”. I told him it’s not a matter of how I see it, his behaviour is unacceptable. He keeps asking me to explain why even though I feel like I’ve already explained a million times. I eventually said that I’m not interested in talking until he takes full responsibility. 

>>>>He just said: “I am deeply sorry. What I did was criticism over a ""small thing"" like drinking coffee, and I must have made you feel unaccepted and imperfect. Something like this should never become a constant dynamic in any relationship.I take full responsibility for what happened”. 

>>>>What do I do? 

**failedantidepressant** 

>>>>>It’s entirely up to you but I can promise you this will not be the first or last time he does this. His apology sounds like he’s telling you what you want to hear so you’ll drop it. 

>>>>>He’s sorry that you found his behavior controlling , he’s not sorry for being controlling. There is a very clear difference. 

[Update](https://rareddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gm385e/update__aita_for_telling_my_bf_to_go_f_himself/)  **May 18, 2020 (19 days later)** 

So, someone posted my BF’s social media page as a comment (now deleted) in the original post. Unfortunately my BF still received some nasty messages, which was never meant to happen, regardless of who was at fault. If you are the person who did this, you are TA, big time. Why on earth would you do that? What if I was in a dangerously abusive relationship? That could have put my life in danger. 

My BF, even though I showed him the original post while there were 6 comments, blamed me for this persons behaviour and accused me of allowing cyber bullying. He also did not agree with any of the comments. I told him I understand why he’s upset and that I am upset too because I truly believed it was completely anonymous and I did all I could to remove the comment as soon as I saw it. He did not agree with any of the comments and said that I am the one who is controlling. He also said that what I did is unforgivable as well as irresponsible and reckless. I said I needed to be alone to think about things. 

After I thought about everything that happened, I asked him if we could talk the next day. Despite what happened I felt it would be the decent thing to talk on the phone. I feel he responded pretty aggressively, saying things like “I am ready now, don’t know about tomorrow”. He told me to write it down as I preferred to have a mob go at him, to text him tomorrow to check when he’s available, and that he’s not at my disposal. I told him to please stop being aggressive, it’s unreasonable to expect me to guess when he’s available, and that the point of asking when he’s available is to appreciate he may have other things to do. 

The next day, I sent him a voice recording because I felt that he would turn aggressive on the phone. I told him that I think we are on different paths and it would be for the best to end this relationship. Apparently by that point he already decided to end the relationship, but then said later that he was willing to give me a second chance and that his love was stronger. He said that he made grave mistakes and that he feels sorry, but he doesn’t want to be with someone who doesn’t let him be himself. Okay, I hope that gives him the closure he needs. Then I had a cup of coffee. 

EDIT: Sorry if it was unclear! What I meant to say is that I broke up with him. And then I enjoyed my cup of coffee in peace.

>Just a question here - did you make you are your boyfriend identifiable in the post? How would anyone have know it was your bf to share his social media... Other than him when you showed him the post and responses 

>Throwing out the theory here that he posted his own social media in there to manipulate the situation and distract it from him being wrong. It's no longer about him being controlling about coffee but makes you feel bad and puts you at fault for making the reddit post. 

**OOP** 

>>No, I didn’t post any identifiable information. No names, no locations, nothing. Just a conversation. I thought perhaps someone found my social media page through a picture I posted of myself and found him that way, so I deleted it. I also thought that it might have actually been him, because I sent him a screenshot of my original post when there were only 6 comments and he didn’t seem to have anything wrong with what I wrote. In fact he kept asking if more people commented. He told me that someone gave him the link to the post. I never hid the post from him. 

**niamhk13** 

>>>Really strange! I think it was him tbh but gal I see in the comments you are now free to enjoy your lukewarm coffee in peace 👏.

(also that 5 bucks is my coffee tmr, lol) anyways i went and talked to them and told them that we needed to talk about how we were splitting things up bc of everything i outlined above. they said ok dont worry about it and part of me knows it seems super petty but the other part of me is just frustrated because i buy things for the house all the time and dont expect to split every single thing and im fine with buying a cheap thing of soap at walmart. and im salty bc i warned that this would happen and i know what its like to live with people (y and z just moved away from their parents) and my suggestions were all dismissed.

I wanted to provide more details, especially since my diet was a huge factor in helping me achieve my goals.

**Focusing on Diet:** Once I started hitting the gym regularly, I knew my diet had to support my muscle growth. Here's what worked for me:

* **Protein Intake:** I ate non-vegetarian food in all my meals. Chicken, fish, and eggs were my main protein sources. I also included whey protein after my workouts to ensure I was getting enough to support muscle recovery.
* **Carbohydrates:** White rice was my primary source of carbs, and I didn’t skip it. It gave me the energy I needed to push through my workouts and build muscle.
* **Healthy Fats:** I included dates and walnuts in my diet for some healthy fats and additional nutrients.
* **Meal Timing:** I ate four meals a day, and after each meal, I would take a short walk to help with digestion. This habit kept me active and helped maintain my metabolism.

**The Impact:** This high-protein, clean diet, combined with consistent workouts, helped me transform from being skinny to building lean muscle. I wasn’t overweight, but I needed to bulk up and gain strength. Adding whey protein and ensuring I ate the right amount of food gave my body the nutrients it needed to grow stronger.

**Camera Practice for Better Posing:**

If you're a bit camera shy and want to improve your confidence in front of the lens, I have a simple exercise for you:

1. **Select a Post:** Choose one photo from Pinterest that you find attractive.
2. **Create a Folder:** On your mobile device or laptop, create a folder specifically for this exercise and name it “Pose\_1.”
3. **Capture Your Own Photos:**
   * Start taking as many pictures of yourself as you can, trying to replicate that particular pose.
   * Pay attention to facial expressions and body language, mimicking what you see in the photo.
   * There's no need to wear the same clothes; just focus on the pose and how it feels.
   * **Use Shortcuts:** Set up your camera to take pictures hands-free or use a tripod.
4. **Organize Your Photos:** Once you get a shot that closely resembles the pose you're trying to copy, create another folder named “Pose\_1\_Correct.”
5. **Set a Time Limit:** Dedicate about 25 minutes each day to this practice.
6. **Repeat:** Continue this exercise for as many poses as you want over at least three months.

**Dating Tips:** Alongside my diet and fitness journey, I also learned a lot about dating:

* **Let Her DM First:** When using dating apps, I’d recommend not initiating the conversation. Wait for her to DM you if she’s interested. This approach takes pressure off and allows for more genuine interactions.
* **Be a Gentleman:** Avoid unnecessary flattery and be respectful. Treat her with kindness and show genuine interest in her as a person.
* **Plan Dates Wisely:** Once you’ve connected, set up a date as soon as possible. Choose affordable places like parks or coffee shops instead of expensive restaurants. This keeps things casual and low-pressure.
* **Be Prepared:** Always have a plan in mind for your dates. If things heat up, be ready for any situation—know a safe spot, and bring protection if needed. It shows responsibility and maturity.
* **Keep It Simple:** During conversations, respond to her cues rather than trying to steer the chat. Be natural and authentic, and don’t initiate topics that might make her uncomfortable.
* **Don’t Wait Too Long:** If you’re talking to someone on a dating app or Instagram for months with little to no engagement, it could indicate a lack of genuine interest. Set up a date ASAP. If she’s not making an effort, it might be best to move on.

By incorporating these tips into your dating life and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, you’ll not only enhance your physique but also your confidence in social situations.

If you’re looking to bulk up and improve your physique, I suggest focusing on a high-protein diet with non-veg sources, paired with the right balance of carbs like white rice. Consistency is key, both in diet and workouts. Feel free to ask more questions or reach out for advice on your own transformation journey or dating experiences.

1g4q92g,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1g4q92g/coworkers_talking_about_trans_stuff_possible_male/,Co-workers talking about Trans Stuff. (Possible Male Fail?),"Today I was at work and building lamps in the back of a department store. There were two of my co-workers (Two women in their late 40s to 50s.) who were talking while opening boxes of Coffee syrup. They started talking about their children. I'm a very nosy person, so I listened in, because, what else am I going to think about at 8 in the morning on a holiday at work.

Woman #1: So do you have any kids?

Woman #2: Yes, they're all adults. I have two sons, and one... uh, Daughter.

Woman #1: What do you mean?

Woman #2: Well she - he's been dealing with Gender identity issues.

Woman #1: Oh! I think I have another friend who has a child like that.

Woman #2: It's quite weird for me. I raised them as my daughter. And I'll always know her as that. But I respect their decision. They've been dealing with it on and off for a few years now.

Woman #1: Oh yeah. And now that they're an adult, they can probably explore those feelings. If they were a kid, I'd think I would have a problem with that. Like, they're too young to understand their body, truly.

I rolled my eyes at that last bit. But hey, I'm not willing to debate that. Especially considering I'm too focused on wrapping up electrical wires into cable ties. Plus, I can't debate for shit. And as the conversation continued it was clear that they were very respect about the person in question, and transgender people in general. But then suddenly they turned to me.

Woman #1: How about you Mason (My Dead/Working Name) how did you go about your Gender identity. When did you first find out you were that way?

I was caught by shock. Not only because they figured out I was eavesdropping on their conversation, but that they thought of me in way. So I bumbled out a response.

Me: Well when I was about 10 or 11, I started to not feel right as a boy. And I wanted to be more like a girl. It wasn't until I was 16 that I pursued those feelings. (All info there is true)

Woman #2: And how old are you?

Me: I'm 19 currently.

Woman #2: I see.

Woman #1: And is Mason the name you were given at Birth. Or did you change it from another name.

Me: No it is my Birth Name.

Woman #2: And do you think you'll you name at some point.

Me: I've thought about it. But for now, Mason is fine.

That last bit is a bit of a lie, since outside of work I'm always called Anna. And always addressed She/Her, as I identify as a Trans Woman. From then on, they talked about things. This interaction has made me think. How do People see me at Work? After all, my name is Mason (A primarily male name) and I've never shown uncomfortability with being called by He/Him pronouns. But I also wear relatively feminine clothing during work. And I did ware a Dress during our recent work Picnic. I also have very visible breasts, and also quite a big butt. Both due to HRT. And on top of this, I'm also like the tallest person of the staff. I'm not exactly sure if that contributes to how I'm perceived. I'm still on the fence on weather I should fully transition at work. There's one person I know who is a transphobe (Since they were talking shit about trans kids in sports), and they happen to my supervisor. Plus that's not saying there's no other people who might turn on me. I don't know, I guess I'm pretty content to who I am. Apart from name and pronouns, I'm basically who I am at work as I am outside of work. But it does make me question what every single one of my co-workers think of who I am. Idk...

(raw doggin' it alone, all the time)","I  (CCC-SLP, 2020 grad) thought we had a culture of mentorship in this field, but I realize how naive and silly that is now that I'm in it. 

I come from the service industry, which is not known for anything except being the thing you do when you're not good enough for anything else\*. Despite this, I became a skilled baker and cake decorator through mentorship alone. I ended up working for some of the most respected bakeries in the PNW designing and creating couture wedding cakes, developing recipes and marketing our products. I always felt like I had a team behind me made up by other people in the industry, current/former co-workers and employers, etc. I always knew I had someone to vouch for me and someone to reach out to if I was ever stumped on a problem. 

As an SLP, I am alone all the time in everything I do. The other SLP at my facility is cordial and respectful, but is clear that she will not engage with me outside of interactions necessary for our shared practice (e.g. scheduling, billing problems, etc.). I've reached out to colleagues /co-workers over the years, offering to buy them a coffee/beer for their time and 2 cents. I've approached this in multiple ways, always trying to be casual/social in my vibe, and I've been summarily rejected each time. 

I'm sad that I've gotten almost no on-the-job training and that what I've had, I had to beg for and was then made to feel guilty for the cost. Nowadays, I figure everything out on my own and face 100% of the consequences when things go wrong. I feel lost a lot of the time and even though I know I'm trying my best, I'm sad for my patients who get an inexperienced practitioner. 

Do you have someone you can spitball with/ask your SLP questions to? Colleagues you can confer with? Grad school buddies? Professional communities? BFF who also happens to be an SLP? Please share your experiences.

**AITA for telling ex-husband I love him?**

**Originally posted to r/AmItheAsshole**

[Original Post - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ehlu8y/aita_for_telling_exhusband_i_love_him/)  **Dec 30, 2019**

I (F29) was married to my ex (M30) for 5 years. Near the end of our marriage I felt he wasn't giving me the attention I needed nor was he the same man I married.

After months of talking and trying to sort things out, I decided to pack up and leave. We spent a week away from each other after which he came over to where I was staying (sisters house) to try for one last time, I denied him and we had a pretty clean divorce. We never spoke to each other since.

The months leading our divorce, I got to know one of my work colleagues (M29) more and more and we really had a connection. We did talk more frequently and exchanged messages but I was sure not to start anything untill my husband and I were truly over.

After our divorce, I persued with my coworker and we got on pretty well to begin with, however it became evident that I had made a huge mistake leaving my husband.

I was blind to my own shortcomings in our relationship and realized that I was constantly pointing out his. This only hit me once I moved in with my coworker who, unlike my ex, didn't put up with any of my nonsense. Only then did I truly realize the value of my ex-husband.

My coworker and I dated for a year before I couldn't suck it up any longer. I missed my ex and honestly felt like my whole world was crushing down without him. I left my coworker and managed to get in touch with my ex-husband.

We met up for coffee, he told me how much he struggled to get over me untill he met his (now) fiance. I was crushed, it was obvious that I broke this mans heart, a man who looked beyond all my faults and loved me without limit. I decided to be honest with him and tell him how I felt, about how I'm not over him and made a huge mistake leaving him.

This threw him off and he went on talking about other things trying to move away from talking about our relationship. I get the hint that he has moved on and don't press too hard.

As we were leaving I tell him I love him, I didn't have any intention to but I thought this is my last opportunity and I will regret it if I don't, he didn't reply and we went out separate ways.

Later that day, I get a message from his fiance, saying how she thinks I'm being disrespectful to their relationship and her soon to be husband and that I should move on.

I never replied but was I really disrespectful to their relationship? I never made a move on him nor try to seduce him, I was just honest with how I felt about him.

Edit for clarification:

*""This only hit me once I moved in with my coworker who, unlike my ex, didn't put up with any of my nonsense""*

Many pointed out that this sounds as though I missed that my ex was a 'doormat' and that my coworker wasn't.

This wasn't what I meant, what I meant was that I realized that it wasn't my husband who was failing me rather it was I who was failing him.

I did reflect alot on the way I acted throughout the marriage and am not proud about the fact that I let him down whilst blaming him. We did talk about this during our meetup and I did apologize for not being the partner he deserved.

From the comments it's evident that I am in the wrong here and I agree that it's time for a therapist and some personal development

1g4q24o,https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1g4q24o/how_to_submit_unanswerable_questions_to/,How to Submit Unanswerable Questions to Open-Source Projects,"As a web developer, I've had the privilege of using and contributing to many outstanding open-source projects. In the open-source community, asking and answering questions is one of the most engaging aspects. Some exchanges are fruitful, while others fade into oblivion. There are many charming and practical commonalities in the way people ask questions. I've distilled these into a guide that I hope will assist those, like me, who are filled with curiosity and eager to (unintentionally) frustrate open-source project maintainers.

Here are 13 tips on *how to ask unanswerable questions*:

### 1. Be as concise as possible
*""Less is more; keep quiet and get rich.""*

Trim down the number of words in your question. Don’t make the other person feel you're rambling. Use the simplest words to describe your issue, distill the keywords, and cut out any lengthy processes or unnecessary details.

- **Good Example**:
  ```text
  CSS compilation error
  ```
- **Bad Example**:
  ```text
  I added xxx.css to my project, but there was an error during compilation. The error message is as follows:

  Module build failed: SyntaxError: Unexpected token

  This is how I imported it:

  import 'xxx.css';

  balalalala .....
  ```

### 2. Use delay tactics
*""Become a long-term pen pal with them.""*

If the maintainer replies, they usually ask for further information. Remember not to respond too quickly, or you might seem like a workaholic (hovering over your computer waiting for a reply). You have a life too—grab a coffee, chat with friends, and reply a week or two later. Trust me, they’ll either lose patience and close the issue or get frustrated because they can't.

- **Good Example**:
  ```text
  You: I encountered a console error when using the Button component.
  Maintainer (within 2 days): I couldn’t reproduce your issue, can you provide a reproducible example?
  Maintainer (3 days later): @you
  Maintainer (1 week later): ping~
  You (2 weeks later): Oh sorry, I didn’t respond sooner. Here’s my code.
  ```
- **Bad Example**:
  ```text
  You: I encountered a console error when using the Button component.
  Maintainer (within 2 days): I couldn’t reproduce your issue, can you provide a reproducible example?
  You (within 2 days): It might be slightly different in my case, here’s the code.
  ```

### 3. Send them everything
*""I don’t have time to debug—this must be your problem.""*

Incorporating open-source modules into medium or large projects can lead to weird issues. Hundreds of files, numerous business modules, and tight deadlines make debugging a pain. Just zip up your project and send it over for them to figure out.

- **Good Example**:
  ```text
  My database project has a frontend component issue. Here's my code. Could someone take a look?
  Attachment: db-service-app.rar (434MB)
  ```
- **Bad Example**:
  ```text
  I encountered an issue in my project when using a frontend component. I simplified the code and found it happens when xxx and yyy components are used together. Here's a minimal reproduction.
  Attachment: component-xxx-yyy-bug.zip (12KB)
  ```

### 4. Leave them hanging
*""To be continued...""*

Always hold something back—don’t lay everything out at once. Make your issue full of suspense to pique the reader’s curiosity.

- **Good Example**:
  ```text
  You: My code has an error, I don’t know what to do.
  You: I have a problem—can anyone help?
  You: Is anyone there?
  ```
- **Bad Example**:
  ```text
  You: I'm using the latest version of xxx, and my console shows the following error…
  Here's how I called it…
  My code repository is here…
  ```

### 5. Mess up the formatting
*""Don't make it too easy for them to understand.""*

Never format your question. You're a developer, not a designer, and formatting isn’t your forte. You’re too busy coding to learn any formatting syntax. Whether they can understand it isn’t your concern.

- **Good Example**:
  ```text
  renderBatchButton() {
  
  return(
  
  <Dropdown overlay={this.renderExportMenu(""2"")}>
  
  
  
  Export
  );
  }
  
  renderExportMenu(category) {
  
  let exportFile = ({ key }) => {
  
  console.log(key)
  
  }
  
  let items = [];
  
  if (this.props.global.template_list) {
  
  items = this.props.global.template_list.map((item) => {
  
  if (category === item.category) {
  
  return (<Menu.Item key={item.id}>{item.name}</Menu.Item>);
  
  }
  });
  }
  ```
- **Bad Example**:
  ```js
  import React from 'react';
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
  import { Menu, Icon } from 'antd';
  
  class Demo extends React.Component {
    state = {
      collapsed: false,
    };
    toggle = () => {
      this.setState({
        collapsed: !this.state.collapsed,
      });
    }
    render() {
      return <Menu>...</Menu>;
    }
  }
  ```

### 6. Omit key information
*""Did I forget to mention it’s not plugged in?""*

Your project was running fine, but after a particular action, or code change, or in a specific environment, an issue occurred. This difference is often key to the problem, but keep it to yourself—no need to share too much.

- **Good Example**:
  ```text
  You: My code has an error.
  Maintainer: I tried everything but couldn’t reproduce it. Can you provide a reproduction?
  You (long after): Oh! This only happens in Chrome 35.
  ```
- **Bad Example**:
  ```text
  You: My code errors in Chrome 35.
  Maintainer: Got it, I’ll take a look.
  ```

At some point Katsuki comes home and he realizes whats happening so he calls Mina. Mina comes and Hitoshi keeps forgetting that she's there, they realize it's serious and tak him to recovery girl.

1g4pyft,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g4pyft/i_let_a_man_kidnap_me_for_3000_a_week/,"I let a man kidnap me for $3,000 a week","It started with an odd ad.

I know how it sounds — sketchy, ridiculous, even dangerous.

But desperate times, right? 

Tuition and books were squeezing me dry, and part-time at Nemo’s wasn’t exactly leaving me flush with cash for the weekends. So, when I stumbled on the ad while doom-scrolling late one night, it caught my attention.

**Seeking a cooperative partner for specialized training. Must be discreet. Generous compensation offered. $3,000/week. No experience necessary.**

I read it over a couple of times.

The ad itself was beyond simple — just a white square with black font. It felt… a little off. But at the same time… $3,000 a week? Who wouldn’t be tempted?

It was one of those promoted ads, so I figured it was targeted at me. Maybe my phone had picked up on me complaining about how broke I was. And *specialized training*? What did that even mean? It had to be shady, right? But the idea of making that much money in a single week? That could cover rent, bar money, and my overdue credit card bills in one go.

I should’ve clicked away. I should’ve known better. 

But I didn’t. Instead, I leaned in closer, heart pounding a little faster as I clicked on the ad. The only thing that popped up was a form to input some data.

**Name**

**Email**

**Phone Number**

I hesitated for a second, but what’s the worst that could happen? Some scammer tries to steal my identity? I was already broke; they wouldn’t get much. And if they wanted feet pics? Who cares, people get to see them for free in sandals at the grocery store.

So, I filled out the form, hit submit, and finally dimmed my phone. I went to bed, convincing myself nothing would come of it. I’d probably just get some weird spam emails.

Two days later, I got a text from an unknown number.

**Hi Samantha! Please fill out and sign this form, and then we can chat about a start date! I love your experience and résumé!**

I stared at my phone. 

*Experience and résumé?* 

I hadn’t attached anything to the application. It was strange… but that $3,000 a week was still front and center in my mind, quickly pushing away any red flags.

I clicked the link and was greeted with a boilerplate Non-Disclosure Agreement. It just said I couldn’t talk about the job or discuss who my employer was. Seemed standard for something shady, I guess.

My finger hovered over the signature line. I could feel a small part of me, the sensible part, screaming to stop, but I was already in too deep. I signed and hit send. 

A few moments later, a new text from the number popped up.

**Samantha! Amazing, how about we meet at Nemo’s at 3pm tomorrow?**

I was a little nervous at this, but maybe he meant another Nemo’s location, not the one in U City where I worked.

**The one in U City btw :)**

*Shit*, I remember thinking…

But Nemo’s in U City was their biggest location. So maybe he wanted somewhere spacious, where we could have an easy conversation about the job. My shift also happened to start at 6pm, so I guess it worked out well. I could meet with him, then get in a quick hour or two of studying before I clock in.

\*\*\*\*

When I walked into Nemo’s, I knew exactly which guy he was. 

Because I could feel him staring at me. It was such an odd gaze. Unsettling.

He looked normal—nice, polished, maybe a couple of years older than me. His outfit was put together in a way that suggested he cared about appearances. When our eyes met, he lit up with excitement.

“Please! Did you get a—” he started, motioning toward the counter.

“I don’t drink coffee after noon,” I cut him off, polite but firm.

He laughed, a little too easily, like he was trying to put me at ease. 

“Sure, sure. Of course, I’ll make note of that.”

There was a brief pause. He seemed tense, like he wasn’t sure how to dive into the real reason we were meeting. But finally, he did.

“Samantha,” he said, leaning in slightly. “I’m willing to pay you in cash. But the collaboration I need from you is… unusual.”

I raised an eyebrow, unsure where this was going. “Okay…”

He shifted in his seat, as though preparing himself for my reaction. “I promise this isn’t dangerous for you. I assure you, your safety is my top priority. It’s just training for me.”

My mind raced, trying to connect the dots, but nothing made sense. “What kind of training?”

His smile never faltered, but there was an underlying tension now. “I want to practice abducting you. In various ways. I can’t explain my full intentions, but trust me, your safety is paramount.”

I blinked, trying to process what he’d just said.

“Abducting me?” I echoed, my voice barely above a whisper.

“Yes, but like I said, it’s not what you think,” he assured me, leaning forward in his chair. His eyes sparkled with a mixture of excitement and something else I couldn’t quite place. “It’s more of a simulation. I need to test different methods, see what works best in different scenarios.”

I felt a shiver run down my spine. “You want to practice kidnapping me?”

He raised a hand, almost as if swearing an oath. “You’ll always know when it’s going to happen. We’ll set boundaries. I’ll never hurt you, I promise. It’s purely for research purposes.”

My brain was spinning. I had no idea how to respond to something like this. “Why? Why me?”

His smile widened. “Because you’re perfect for this. You’re smart, quick on your feet, and you need the money. And I’m offering you a lot of it.”

I opened my mouth, but no words came out. The room felt too warm, the sounds of the café fading into the background as my thoughts raced. Every instinct was telling me to leave, to get out of there while I still could. But then that $3,000 flashed in my mind again. Rent. Bills. The looming student loans.

“I… I don’t know,” I finally managed. “This sounds...”

“Unconventional,” he finished for me, nodding as if he completely understood. “But think about it. A few weeks of this, and you’ll never have to worry about money for a long time. You could focus on your studies, maybe even take some time off from Nemo’s. You wouldn’t have to struggle anymore.”

I swallowed hard. 

“You’re sure it’s safe?”

“Completely,” he said, his tone calm and confident. “We’ll have contracts in place, and safety measures. I wouldn’t risk your well-being, Samantha. This is just… a sort of exercise, training.”

I sat there, staring at him, torn between the bizarre offer and the very real lure of financial freedom. 

The sensible part of me screamed that this was insane, that no amount of money was worth risking my safety for. But the other part… the part that had been worn down by late nights, double shifts, and the constant stress of making ends meet was tempting. Very tempting.

“Okay,” I said slowly, the word slipping out before I could stop it.

His smile widened. 

“Great. We’ll start next week.”

\*\*\*\*

The first time it happened, I thought I was going to die.

I was coming out of Target, a couple of bags in hand, already thinking about dinner. The quickest route to my car meant cutting through the Tesla supercharger lot, and I couldn’t help but smirk at the people lounging inside, watching Netflix as they charged up.

I didn’t see the black Tesla sedan parked right by me until the door swung open, and that’s when everything went dark. I regained consciousness in the trunk, my hands and legs bound.  My mouth was sealed shut with what felt like tape.

I slipped back into unconsciousness.

I didn’t wake up until the morning, in a hotel room. It was some random hotel I had never been in.

As I sat up, I felt incredibly drowsy. I scanned the room and saw that room service had been ordered for me. 

Next to the food was an Uber gift card and a nice looking stack of cash. I took an Uber home and couldn’t stop thinking about how I would spend my $3,000.

That was the first time he abducted and released me.

Over the course of the semester, it happened eight more times.

Each abduction was different, each one terrifying in its own way. Sometimes it was chloroform, other times it was sleeping pills slipped into my morning coffee. 

One time he pulled a gun on me in broad daylight.

Another, I woke up in my own bed with no memory of how I’d gotten there, a faint chemical smell lingering in the air. 

He even tricked me through a fake Bumble date once, catfished me with the profile of a hunky Italian man, luring me out with the promise of a fun night, only to have a bag thrown over my head the moment I stepped out of my apartment.

How the abductions kicked off always felt random. But he always wanted to carry me or drag me at some point during them. That part never changed.

The hotel I woke up in was always a new one. Some were nicer than others.

And it was always the same routine. Breakfast. Uber gift card. Cash. And despite how odd I felt, the money was adding up. By Christmas break, my checking account was sitting at $19,223.74. I felt invincible, rich.

\*\*\*\*

Over winter break, I went home.

I wasn't sure if the abductions would continue or pause. I figured they'd pause, so I didn't plan on the $3,000 coming in. But I channeled my inner Santa and splurged anyway.

I bought my younger brother a PS5 and some games, got my parents a new Kitchen Aid mixer, and even bought Taylor Swift tickets for my twin sister, Ellen.

The presents were a hit.

But Ellen noticed something had changed about me. One late night while we were both home from break, in our bedroom, she confronted me. 

“Sam, where’s all this money coming from? You’re spending like you hit the lottery.”

I shrugged, sticking to my rehearsed lie. 

“I’ve been tutoring some kids. Pays loads better than you’d think.”

“In what?”

“Calculus.""

“You’re terrible with numbers,” she said.

“Want to see itemized receipts?” I quipped back.

She gave me a long, skeptical look, then rolled her eyes.

“Sure, Sam. Whatever you say.”

I don't think she fully bought it, but thankfully, she dropped the subject. We spent the rest of the night catching up about our lives at different universities.

Mine had been uneventful, at least dating-wise. I had been too busy making money to worry about boys. But Ellen had gone through a string of bad dates, including one guy who wouldn’t leave her alone. 

“He was loaded, which was awesome, but a complete and total nut job. Kept calling me his soulmate on our second date.”

“That’s awful,” I laughed.

We stayed up so many nights over break catching up and sharing college stories. But I never caved and told her the truth about how I had been making my money.

I'll always regret that.

\*\*\*\*

When I got back to school in January, the abductions stopped.

And the cash? That didn’t come either. I texted him a few times, but always got no response. Weeks passed. I figured he’d forgotten about me. Maybe it was over. I considered reaching out to my old manager at Nemo’s. 

Then, out of the blue, I got a text:

**Sorry! Will give you payment in cash Thursday. Nemo’s. 7:15 pm.**

Thursday came, but no cash or meeting. I waited at Nemo's for about an hour before I received another series of texts.

**Sorry again! Will mail you a check. Was running late today.**

**\*final payment btw.**

**I’m prepared and don’t need any more practice :)**

I sighed and went back to my dorm, put on Netflix, and tried to forget about the whole thing. Easy money never lasts, I figured.

Around 1 a.m., my phone started vibrating under my pillow. I dug it out and saw that Ellen was calling. I answered.

“Hey, bitch!” I said, smiling.

“Sam! Call mom and dad! They’re not answering. I think someone’s following me —”

“Wait, who?!”

“Some guy in a mask! I called the police —”

I could hear her breathing pick up, she was running now. 

“I think it's — ”

And then I heard it. The screaming, the phone hitting the ground. 

""Ellen? Ellen!"" I screamed into the receiver, but there was no response. Just the hollow sound of the line still connected, but her voice... gone.

Then all I could hear was silence.",26,1729048540.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1g4pxn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1g4pxn8/back_to_friends/,Back to Friends?,"Warning:  This is long, but I'm not sure how to transition this relationship from romantic to friendship, and since we're in the same masters program and friend group, I seek advice.  But clearly I fucked up since I'm here.

I (35M) recently fell in love with a classmate (27F).  I didn't plan on it.  She was very interested in me, and she was so feminine and had such cute energy she got my guard down quickly.  We dated for... 10 weeks.

The first time we hung out outside of school, we were at a bar with a lot of masters students.  We didn't all know each other yet, and I had the same conversation five or six times with other people introducing myself... what I did before the program, what I want to do after, etc.  I felt tired of having this same conversation and I saw myself about to be in another one, so I removed myself and looked for Vicki (not her real name).  I found comfort in being with her.  There was something soothing about her presence, the fact that she seemed genuinely interested in me, and she was easy to talk to and she was like, really funny.  She also had a cute accent which helped.

I bought her drinks all night.  We all wandered to a few different bars around Soho with our classmates and then at the last bar we said bye and we went to get pizza just the two of us.  We sat on her stoop and ate and talked about life, sex, what drugs we'd done.  I had a train to catch the next morning, but she invited me up and I slept at her apartment for a few hours.   We didn't have sex but we just shared what felt like the beginnings of real intimacy.  I kissed her once delicately and said bye.

When I got back from my trip, I saw her at school and she wanted to talk.  She said she didn't want to date, because she didn't want to be ""the girl that dates a guy in the masters program.""

""Okay"" I said. I was bummed after our amazing night. I hadn't had a night like that in a very long time, years probably. But at this point --  totally fine, I had only hung out with her once and I appreciated that she communicated what her feelings were.

The following weekend I went to my friends art show and then I had a date with a new girl after.  Vicki was texting me asking me what I was doing.  I didn't tell her I was on a date, but something tells me she could tell.

At school, Vicki comes over to me every day to chat.  I usually sit by myself outside in the sun.  She teases me that I'm a ""lurker"" and that I'm always on the phone having important conversations.  (I use my breaks from class to catch up with people).  We hang out a lot with other students and start doing more things together, she wants to be with me always, it seems.  We go to movies, bars, concerts.

One of these events she tells me she knows I was out on a date and that she might ""have a problem"" with feelings of attraction she has toward me.  She was more attracted to me than I was to her, and I found it a little off-putting how forward she was telling me about how intense her feelings were without ever really checking in on mine... but I had a great night with this girl and she found a little soft spot in my heart.  I asked her out to dinner.

I take her to a super nice spot, because I can afford it, and because I haven't gone out on a date like this in a while.  I was super sweet.  I lied to the restaurant and told them it was her birthday.  When they brought her out a little cake, I even gave her a card and a little present (necklace... maybe too much) and she was over the moon.  She was kissing me, sitting on my lap, basically just all over me.  I figured this girl liked me a lot.  We have sex.  We keep it a secret from our classmates.  We have a lot of sex.  She tells me she loves while shes on top of me.  Or she almost does and I catch her.

""We're you about to say that you love me?""

""Fuck it, yes. I fucking love you so much.""

We go on a trip with our masters classmates.  20 of us in a big house.  We talk in the hot tub about our families, the good bad and ugly. We sneak off to fuck in the bathroom, we go off on our own to get groceries and coffee, we listen to The National and talk about what kind of music we like, and what it reminds us of.  She calls me her special darling boy.  I'm starting to melt.

She tells me she told her parents she was ""starting to see this darling boy who was so kind and generous and she cared for.""

I was actually on a trip to visit my parents, and so...

I told her I told my parents too.

Now she's not as quick to reply as she usually is.  I detect a vibe shift, and I think she's trying to cover it up.

I see her at school and we talk.

""I have so much going on.  I have a full time job, this masters program that I'm struggling with, all my friends are mad at me because I've been spending so much time with you.  I think we should just be friends, and maybe if we get a little drunk one night, who knows.  It's just not a good time right now.""

*Oh.*

At this point I'm sad, but it gets worse.

I go rock climbing with a platonic girl friend, and Vicki texts me to come to the bar she's at.  When I'm done climbing, I go meet her.  She's drunk.  She takes me to sushi and offers to pay for it, but I bought it for her instead.  We go back to her apartment and fuck for the last time.  At this point I'm so attracted to this girl I came almost immediately, never lost my erection and came again 10 minutes later.  So that's new.

I was fine with this arrangement, but maybe I wasn't.  The next time we hangout.  I got drunk.  We were all drunk.  I told her that she likes me, and that I like her and we should just fucking go for it.

She didn't like that.

Later at a comedy show we were playing footsie with each other while out with other friends.  I make a joke about getting married one day, which she reciprocates.  She's rubbing my legs under the table.

Then I told her I loved her.  Well actually I didn't.  I had the bright idea to drunkenly tell my friends ""I love Vicki.""  Then I realized how wasted I was.  It was definitely time to go home.  I got up and made everyone get out of the booth so I could vacate.  I'm Irish exiting. I go up the stairs, and Vicki catches me outside the club.

""Hey! Is everything okay?!  Where are you going, what's wrong?""

This was the last time she cared about me in a way that could have been interpreted as romantic.  I told her nothing was wrong I was just too drunk.  She understood. I went home.

I didn't hear from her all the next day, and she wasn't in class.

That night, she calls me.  Our friend had an accident and was in the ICU. He cracked his skull from a nasty fall. It happened after I left the comedy show.  She found him unconscious with his eyes open.  Everyone was super rough with him, bouncers trying to shake him awake, EMT doing the same.  He was actually refused care at Mt. Sinai.

""He's just drunk"" said professional medical doctors.

Vicki took him back to her house to sleep it off, why shouldn't she trust the doctors?

But he was fucked up.  Vicki called his mother who was a doctor and she told them to go back to the hospital and this time he was admitted, fractured skull and sub-dermal hematoma. ICU for 5 days.

He's okay now.

But on the phone with her, I try to comfort her. And we didn't know what was going to happen.  I tell her she did everything right and it's not her fault the doctors refused him care.  I tried to encourage her and tell her that our friend would be okay when we didn't really know if he would be.  I told her I would do anything she needed and I was here to help her.  She was coordinating a lot with our friends family, the doctors, the bar to get the footage of the fall etc...

But then I didn't hear from her in six days. She was barely at school. I understood that this was traumatic for her and I tried to let it go.   But it ate at me.  She confided in me so much, why can't she talk to me at all now when she needs help?  I saw her and she seemed like she wanted to go home and not talk.  I walk her to the train.

""How are you doing?"" She asked me hallowly.

""Good.  But I miss you, is there anything I can do to help?  Maybe we can spend some time together soon?""

She can't even answer, she turns and goes through the turn style and gets on the train.

I talked to another friend of ours, I knew that Vicki confided in her.

""Has she said anything about me, I feel like I'm bothering her but I find it strange that we were becoming so close and now she's shutting me out.  I get there's a ton of stress but I thought I could help, but it seems like I'm just adding to it.""

She told me I should probably move on.

I send Vicki a message:

Look, I understand that whatever we had is over.  I'm hoping we can still be friends and I'll keep inviting you to the things I plan with our friend group.""

She wants to talk to me.  She's chipper now, like before our friends accident, which is now kind of upsetting because it reads like a lack of empathy to me.

She tells me I didn't do anything wrong and that she really enjoyed the time we had together and that now is just a really bad time for her, and she was sorry she was cold.

I understood, but what about all the feelings she had for me?  They were gone now...void of all cuteness and compliments.  I found comfort in her words though, and while I planned myself to move on, maybe I could check in on her in the future and see if a spark could reignite.  Who knows?

The next day she gives me a card.  Like a thank you note.  For dating her.  I found it weird.  But I guess it was sweet.  She wrote tons of thoughtful shit inside but it stung to read ""*even though we're not dating anymore"" etc etc etc.* I didn't really need a card to remind me of that.  I felt it still. I feel it still.

But she's chipper.  And she's calling me a lot.  She talks about plans of entrepreneurial ventures that we could work on together in the future, which I'm obviously wary of but I like her excitement and I appreciate her attention again and things are back to normal?  Without the sex I but I appreciated our emotional intimacy, I don't have many friends like that and I'm feeling close with her again.

The next day she gives me a compliment. I forget what it was.

""Thanks, but you can save it for the vows."" I was fucking with her, we used to joke like this.  This is what this relationship has been, and I understand we're not dating but... I didn't realize this joke is off limits.

""Look I think I need to tell you something. Can I tell you something. I think it might help.""

""I was fucking with you, but okay..""

""I didn't feel a deep emotional connection with you.""  I sat there, dumbfounded. ""With my last boyfriend I felt it nearly immediately, I never felt it with you.  I've only felt it for one man in my life and it's really important that I feel that in my partner.  We're so different. I think we could have had a beautiful life together if I were older but it's important that I find this""

*So this is what it was all along*.  She was never too busy, I mean she was maybe, but that wasn't the real reason.  She knew this for nearly the whole time?  And she showers me with compliments, tells me she loves me during sex and tells her parents about us when she didn't even feel the most important thing she needs in a relationship?  This was hard for me.  It was a lot easier when I could blame timing, but now I couldn't.  It was just me, and her.  I know I'm not *responsible* for someone else's feelings.  I know that I'm not *lacking* anything, but it still hurt because I consider myself someone with a considerable level of emotional intelligence.  I knew I sensed changes in her feelings but I wouldn't have guessed this.  I *felt* the deep connection what she was talking about; I felt it with her.  After a while, certainly not from the beginning.  This was a losing battle, but I still didn't go down without a fight.

""I don't know if you have the space emotionally to feel those feelings.  You said it yourself, you're overwhelmed with school, your friends are mad at you because of me, you have a full time job.  If you weren't worried about everything else I think these feelings could grow.  They grew for me.  I didn't feel them in the beginning, either.""  This conversation lasts 75 minutes.  It was kind of sweet to hear about all the relationships in her life and how every one of them was different and some were more special, but everything I said:

Deaf ears.  She explained that she had learned so much in her last relationship, and if she hadn't had that experience she would have dated me for five years and then broken up with me before the wedding or something.  But this didn't feel like growth to me, it feels like an opportunity that was just completely wasted from someone pretty irresponsible about another humans feelings.  I don't feel super mature, but maybe I am compared to her.

But also, I understood.  I've broken up with people for the same reason, but that felt different.  Maybe because I'm on the other side, but when I did it it was because there was also no attraction, no excitement, no fun.  Vicki and I had so much fun together, she was incredibly attracted to me. I don't understand when these doubts even began to fester.  But it doesn't matter.

I need to just forget it about it.

*Queue montage of depression I wish I could fast forward my life through.  Kinda still here actually.*

I tell her I need some space.  She says she'll give me space. The next day:

""Do you hate me?""

I ignore her.  I skip the class we have the next day together.

""You're missing some crazy discussion in class""

...this isn't *space*.

Three days go by where I get to think and she doesn't bother me.

*This is space*.

I break my silence with something like this:

Hey thanks for being patient with me I've just been thinking about how to go about this relationship. It's been hard knowing the truth, but I do appreciate you telling me.

The next day I see her talking with her friend that told me to move on.  They seem like they're in the middle of it, so I nod to both of them and walk by.

""Aren't you gonna come say hi?"" Vicki asks

I explain they seemed like they were in an intense conversation so I didn't want to interrupt but I start to make small talk.  Vicki ignores me, and I'm talking mostly with her friend.  Uncomfortable. I excuse myself to get a coffee, and get back to work.  Although my mind is a swamp and focusing on anything is nearly impossible.

A few hours later during a break in class, Vicki is walking back from the cafe, and I try to be friendly. I vacate the group I'm talking with and walk towards her.  She adjusts her path and averts her eyes to avoid me.

""Are you fucking with me?""

""Are you going to be civil? Can we be civil?"" She's upset, but then she melts.

""I told myself I was going to ignore you all day.  I'm mad that you took five and a half days to reply to me and now you don't want to be friends.  Everything is so serious with us now and I just want to have fun, you're so much fun and we knew this could happen when we started and I just want to be friends again.  We're in the same friend group and I want us all to get along.""

She's being pouty and really fucking cute.

""Do you need a hug?""  We step close and give each other a hug that only lovers can do.  Well, maybe not that far but... I mean, actually yeah probably only lovers can do.  But I'm a fucking idiot.  Why am I hugging this girl?  She said she'd give me space, she ignores me and now I'm comforting *her?*  This should be harder for me than it is for her.

""It looks like you had a fun weekend"" She said to me.  ""You took Jennifer flying.""

And I did.  I'm also a pilot and took another girl in our friend group up in a Cessna 172.  She posted a story where she was landing the plane. Clearly Vicki was jealous, but she knows we're just friends.

""Do *you* want to go flying? I'll take you up""

""You and I *both* know we can't do that""

""Okay...""

And since then... there's been very little contact. I've seen her with our friend group and it's very cordial. We don't share a close bond anymore, and it kind of upsets me.  But writing this has helped me discover that maybe that's okay.  I really wanted to be friends with her.  I actually watched *Normal People* to help me process this and thought maybe we could be like Connolly (sp?) and Marianne.  But we can't. And we won't be.  Vicki is too young for me, and I basically need to pretend it never happened.

We're going to go out with the same group, and she's going to talk to other guys.  And I'm going to talk to other girls.  I don't want to lose my friend group because of this... but if it's not sustainable then I guess I just have to be accountable and own it, cut my losses and make new friends.  But I kind of suck at making new friends.  And that's part of the reason I liked Vicki.  She was so outgoing, brought me out of my shell and made me feel special.

I really hope I can tolerate it when she starts talking about other guys or bringing them around. She seems like she has the maturity level where she's going to try and shove it in my face.  I'm trying to be respectful but at the same time, I felt a lot more for her than she felt for me, and I'm not sure she's going to be cognizant or respectful of that or my feelings in general.

I think my plan is to just ask nothing of her, focus on my grad program, live my life and have fun.  Stay with my friend group and if she throws other guys in my face, do my best to not be bothered by it. And I'll be nice to her but, I'll focus more on the other relationships in my friend group.  What do you guys think... is this the right approach?",1,1729048468.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I find it hard to ever be a victim. To put my mind there, I feel somewhat of a bitch. Here’s the situation:

An ex-employee for my site is targeting a current employee of ours for sexual harassment claims likely because he reported her to HR for showing up to the site drunk and being obnoxious. She was also reported in the incident for being at the store since 0800 performing security duties out of uniform and off the clock. When he escorted her out, she told him to “get over yourself” because he was irritated while escorting her out and told her sternly to leave the property. She came into the store blurting out, “IM DRUNK!” This got her suspended. She came into the store the next day and freaked out, calling me, very upset, claiming that he was starring at her the whole time she was there with her husband. This is where she told HR that he sexually harassed her by claiming he was stalking her. On camera, you can see the female ex-employee multiple times without the employee in view of her. She then continued to request his hours since his report cost her a couple days of work and that was immediately denied and they told her that was inappropriate. Following this, her husband continued to come to the store while the employee was there, indirectly taunting him, telling people he was a coward for no apparent reason. The second day the ex-employee was back from suspension, we had an incident where she called me in from the parking lot for what she claimed was an emergency. She freaked out, whispering like a wound up chattering pair of teeth telling me that her husband was there to beat up a guy in a wheelchair for asking her for nude photos. It was later discovered that she had been leading the man in the wheelchair on for weeks at that point until husband found out and she played victim, claiming he sexually harassed her by asking her that question. He had actually been coming in every day she worked, giving her hugs, saying he loved her and bringing her coffee. I’ve witnessed that myself. Anyway, as supervisor, I said our mission is to locate the man in the wheelchair to escort him in the store for safety reasons I later told him about when I found him as he was leaving. The man in the wheelchair seemed somewhat aware that he was being followed and I advised he call the police but his caretaker said the midget husband isn’t worth calling the cops even though his ambition was to harm the man in the wheelchair. Ultimately, the client’s loss prevention who was there for the incident was left in shock and fed up with her knowing the other incidents. He demanded I report her or he would call the company owner so I did report her and let my bosses know that loss prevention is saying that if she’s on the clock, they will go home early from now on. This got the ex-employee fired. She now comes in to the store every day asking me to help her get the job back. She is following the employee and showing me pictures of him walking around with loss prevention off the clock (it’s normal, we are very good friends and don’t actually work off the clock) saying it’s unfair as if our company still involves her.

1g4psgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/postpartumprogress/comments/1g4psgu/for_those_who_experienced_postpartum_psychosis/,"For Those Who Experienced Postpartum Psychosis: How Did You Realize Something Was Wrong, What was it like coming out of it, and How Did You Begin to Repair Things if Damage was done?","I’m here seeking clarity and hoping to connect with others who have been through the darkness of postpartum psychosis or dealt with severe postpartum changes. How and when did you first realize that something was off? For those of you who experienced postpartum psychosis, what was it like when you “woke up” from that state? Did it hit all at once or gradually? And if your actions during that time caused damage to your relationships or life, how did you begin repairing things?

I’m currently in the middle of a complicated situation and struggling to make sense of it. My wife gave birth to our first child six months ago, and her behavior shifted drastically. If you’d like more context, feel free to look through my previous posts, but the chaos since our child’s birth has left me wondering if postpartum psychosis—or even an undiagnosed personality disorder—might be at play.

The change in her behavior was sudden and extreme. There wasn’t any abuse, infidelity, or major conflicts between us, yet she convinced herself that taking our child to her parents’ house (without any warning) and filing for divorce was the right thing to do. No discussion happened beforehand—just drastic action.

Even more baffling are the reasons for the divorce, which center around accusations that I have a mental health disorder putting her and our daughter in danger. The evidence she provided is strange:

• Drinking coffee one day but not the next.

• Listening to the same song on repeat for a while one evening.

• Discovering my shoe size is 10.5, not 9.5.

• Suggesting we hire a $25/hour nanny instead of a $35/hour one.

• Walking too much.

None of these things were ever brought up during our marriage, and these “issues” feel like they came out of nowhere. Each time I share part of this story, people ask me if PPD/PPA/PPP might be at play.

The only major problem between us was my mother-in-law. She treated me terribly, manipulated situations, belittled me, and tried to control both my wife and me. Now, it seems like her influence is behind much of what’s happening. I fear she’s taking advantage of my wife’s vulnerable mental state to get what she wants.

For context: I know how serious this subject is and took every step I could to raise the alarm months ago. I contacted her OBGYN, who only reached out to *her*—which, of course, backfired. I also texted her parents, but they laughed off the idea that she was experiencing a mental health issue. It seems like everyone close to her is in denial. And yet, people outside the situation keep asking if she could be experiencing postpartum psychosis or another mental health episode, because none of this feels normal.

If anyone has experience—whether it’s personally going through postpartum psychosis or being on the receiving end of these changes—I would be so grateful for your insights. I’m conflicted, overwhelmed, and just trying to figure out the best way forward for my child, my wife, and myself.

My parents would brush it off always and tell me my stomach hurts because of a cold. I usually get heartburns around 4-5 pm and it lasts for 12 hours, it normally stops hurting when i have thrown up every last bit of food in my stomach. Back then this would happen 2 times per month usually. Then 4 years ago, I finally convinced my parents to seriously check it out and I was diagnosed with chronic gastritis. I have been to different doctors and I have bern prescribed different drugs in different periods of time (PPIs, H2 inhibitors). When I get heartburn I do try taking antacids but they don’t always work. Gaviscon never works, tums and maalox manage to stop the pain just sometimes but not most of the time.  Now the weird thing is (I’m from Albania and 3 years ago I came in China to study) in China I rarely get heartburns, probably around once a month, but every time I return back home for holidays and stay there for 1-2 months I get heartburns every once in two days. I’m constantly fearing I will get it every day when I’m back home. The thing is because I’m not used to chinese food I eat very simple food here, chicken, rice, vegetables, yoghurt, I don’t drink coffee or eat any fast food and this is what I try to do back home too. This summer back home I was very strict with what I ate and I only ate food that wouldn’t cause acidity problems, the same things I eat in China. I always make sure to not lay down after food , back home I would even take a walk after meals to help better digest it. And of course I only experience stress in China because of my studies and being so far from home, yet I only get heartburn almost every day when I am back home.

So I've always been into tarot and astrology and stuff like that and today I just tried my very first spell. It's been over a year since I left a horrific abusive relationship that lasted 10 years and I'm finally ready to start meeting people. The problem is is that I'm not a casual dater-I'm someone who's like: I want to meet my person and know thats them and thats it. Unfortunately we know life isn't like that.
Recently I went to Aftershock for the first time and saw someone that absolutely made my heart stop. Not only did I see them once, I saw them TWICE which is crazy considering that seeing someone twice at festival that big feels almost impossible. I have never looked at a stranger and felt the way that I did and unfortunately I was too scared to talk to him.

I posted on reddit on my other account trying to find him but I think it's a lost cause but it got me really thinking about my divination, I decided I was going to do a spell and ask the universe to bring love to me. Before doing this I did A LOT of research. Looking into ingredients, cleansing protocols etc etc. I've done cleansing before for my friends but have never attempted a spell.
So I made up my alter(my coffee table lol) with my different crystals and stones and stacks of tarot cards etc etc.  
I had a red candle and used my bowl for water, pink salt, honey and cinnamon. I wrote down all the attributes I'd want in a partner(which was a lot) and then I closed my eyes and prayed to Aphrodite and Venus(whom I see as my patrons given that it feels right and my chart is majorly Venusian, but thats a story for another day.) 
Then I took a picture of the list, burned the list using the candle and dropped it into a mostly empty candle. 
After I did a couple of spreads of my tarot cards-asking various questions.
And heres where things get crazy.
The paper was not burning out. Like it was burning but the fire did not STOP. Which was strange to me? I thought perhaps it was the jojoba oil I used for cleansing but honestly I thought it should've gone out. I opened the window because it was a tiny bit smokey and figured this will help send it out into the universe more and then I got a spell jar(extra potency-go big or go home right?). I filled it with the salt, the water mixture and then I pulled pieces of the ashed paper and put it in there and sealed it with wax from the red candle-then I put it outside on my patio.

After I regarded the still burning paper and was like-okay well what the hell do I do now? So as a test I poured some of the left over water mixture in there and the fire that came out of it was CRAZY. like I don't know if it was the oil or what but it was INSANE. The feeling I got from it was this incredible surge of energy and I couldn't help laughing like a crazy woman. It did spray some wax and I finally picked it up and brought it to the sink so that it could cool down and I could dispose of it later. 

Anyways-crazy energy or fire hazard we'll never know, LOL",1,1729047819.0,witchcraft,2,1.0,False

The city really is a pit, Akira thought to himself, gazing through the grimy window bars. Outside, the skyline of Ashfall Hollow loomed like jagged teeth against a bruised sky, and below, chaos unfolded in the streets. Another bank heist—the third this week—played out with sirens blaring and masked figures darting in and out like rats scavenging for scraps. It was the same scene, over and over. Like clockwork, the Hollow ground itself down, fed on its own decay.

He let out a long, weary sigh.

The waitress approached his table cautiously, her eyes darting to the sniper rifle propped up in the corner like some ominous shadow. She was young, maybe early twenties, with a nervousness about her that reminded him of a rabbit eyeing a hawk. Her hand trembled as she clutched the notepad. ""Um, sir… what—what can I get you?""

Akira glanced up at her and saw the fear swimming just below the surface. ""Relax. I’m not here for trouble. Just waiting for something to wrap up."" He leaned back, folding his arms casually. ""I'll be out of here soon.""

The waitress nodded, though her expression didn’t seem to calm. ""So, uh, what would you like to order?""

He tilted his head and rattled off the most elaborate drink he could imagine.

So, I was curious to know if anyone in this thread has made the switch from a drink like NOS, and how GamerSupps compares? (both in their caffeinated and caffeine free variety, as I'm looking at both.)

And while there are lots of technical terms, artistic ambiguities, and subjective preferences, it all comes down to being intentional with your choices and understanding how to turn those choices into a finished photo.  


Intro photo: [https://imgur.com/a/umQoDvi](https://imgur.com/a/umQoDvi)

    While you may not always be able to control the lighting, you can control where you are in relation to the light to achieve the same effect.)
 

# Qualities of Light [https://imgur.com/a/KV4Ka9L](https://imgur.com/a/KV4Ka9L) 

    The hard, yet diffused light in this scene helps give a strong contrast with deep shadows that separates the subject from the background without the need for a shallow depth of field. The diffusion keeps the reflective surfaces from becoming too distracting, as well as helping to maintain a more even exposure across the highlights.

We’ve previously discussed the differences in hard vs. soft and specular vs. diffuse, so let’s get into *why* we might want one over another. The quick and easy answer that gets thrown around is “use the softest light possible” but in reality that’s often not the best choice.  
 

**Soft, Diffuse** 

This lighting works great for simple portraits where you want the subject’s skin to look smooth and even, or in busy scenes where the subject may stand out through color, framing, or texture. The light is even, with fewer shadows to worry about becoming a distraction. It’s fairly flattering for portraits, can work great for getting an even exposure on a landscape, but often lacks the more distinct shadows that can add dimension to a scene.  
 

**Soft, Specular**

While the difference between a diffuse and specular light can be subtle at times, this style works well for portraits when you want a softer or more flattering light but still want a wider dynamic range. It can be useful in a scene to create a more dynamic image while keeping everything brightly lit, or in adding further contrast to a low-key scene where you still want the model in a softer light.  
 

**Hard, Specular** 

While this is generally considered unflattering for portraits, it can look amazing in landscape or street photography. The high contrast between highlights and shadows can create a dynamic scene based on lighting over color, or can be used to make certain colors stand out. The hard lines of shadow can also be used as a compositional element that interact with the scene.  
 

**Hard, Diffuse**

While this is much the same as using the more specular light, diffusion over a hard light can smooth out the brightest highlights and let you get a slightly more evenly lit subject in an otherwise high-contrast scene. This can also be slightly more flattering for models when using a hard light, although correct placement of lights (or positioning of the subject when using ambient light) will still have a greater effect on “flattering” light than the diffusion.  
 

# Positioning Lights 

Modifiers may drastically change the quality of light hitting your subject, but an even greater difference can be made simply by repositioning your lights (or moving your subject in relation to a light). With a smaller light source, the difference of a few inches (or centimeters, for most of the world) can have a significant impact on the final result. For outdoor photos, the difference of a few minutes can impact how the sun hits your subject. In general though, changes in light are measured in broader movements, or in the subjects relation to the light. This leaves a lot of variation and overlap when discussing lighting position but helps give a standard nomenclature to use when planning or discussing your shots.  
 

**Near vs. Far**

This is the broadest term, but also one of the most useful. It originates in the film industry where exact lighting descriptions are impractical due to actor’s movement through a scene. The fact that it covers a broad variety of lighting is what makes it useful though, and can often be used to tie fairly unrelated shots together in a fairly consistent manner.  
 

The premises of near or far lighting relies on the subject’s position in relation to both the camera and the key light. In portraiture, for example, imagine looking top-down on the model and draw a line running through their head in the direction they’re looking. If the camera and light are on the same side of the line, that’s *near lighting*. If the camera and light are on opposite sides of the imaginary line, it’s *far lighting*. While this seems too simplistic to have much impact, simply having the subject turn their head can completely change the look. And if building a series of photos, getting that consistent look of near or far lighting can tie together photos from different sessions taken on different days, while using different lighting setups.  
 

When discussing landscape or street photography the dividing line can sometimes be harder to define but is equally important in creating a consistent body of work. The dividing line may be the face of a building, a terrain feature, or any number of things within the scene that are intended to be a primary subject. This can also help to highlight a non-obvious subject within a scene by tying the lighting on that particular subject to the rest of a set, while the more obvious subject may have a different light.  
 

**Feathering**

To “feather” a light simply means to turn the light. The source stays at the same point, but the angle is changed in relation to the subject.  
 

This can be used to get a more dynamic shot with a softer light source, as it’s essentially shrinking the source in one direction. The downside is that less of the light’s power is aimed at the subject, so that will need to be factored into the exposure. Especially when balancing with background or ambient light.  
 

**Flagging**

While we’ve discussed what flags *are*, using them can sometimes be difficult as it’s an extra piece of gear to coordinate. In general, when placing the flag between the light and subject you have more control and more coverage the closer the flag is to the light. You can also move it farther from the light though and get a more precise coverage of a smaller area. It’s generally pretty simple to pick up on as you experiment, but you can also feather the flag to get even more precise control or place the flag between the light and camera to prevent flaring in the lens (similar to using a lens hood).  
 

**Diffusing**

Again, this was discussed in the previous lesson but there is more to a diffuser’s application than just knowing what it does. It can soften the light on a subject, but if the subject is lit separately it can also be used to soften the light on the background to add another form of separation between background and subject. And as any diffusion material will also reduce the brightness of the original source, diffusion can be used as a partial flag to dim light on the background without blocking it completely.  


# Adding them all Together

 Lighting descriptions can sound complicated and full of technical  jargon, but if you break it down into individual pieces it becomes much  more manageable. Let’s look at this image as an example: 

[https://imgur.com/a/jIz8YXZ](https://imgur.com/a/jIz8YXZ)

    When breaking down the lighting used in an image, it's important to look at the shadows for clues on where the light is positioned, how hard of soft the light is, and if there is a single light or multiple sources. In the same way, we can look to the highlights to see how diffused the lighting is.  Other context clues may include the background, reflective surfaces, catch-lights in the eyes, and textures.  The ability to ""read"" the lighting in a photo can help when planning your own photographs by giving descriptive terms that will allow you to build up concepts based on reference photos or by giving you the knowledge to know how and when to deviate from a reference.
 

 To begin, we can assume that this is a hard light source based on the  sharp edges on the shadows. It also has a steep gradient between whites,  highlights, and mid-tones so we can make the judgement that it’s also  using a specular light. Putting this together with the background clues  of an open fence, trees in the background, and subject matter that is  farm related, you can make a strong inference that this shot was taken  in natural lighting. And going by the angle of light, we can identify  that it was either taken in the morning or evening, likely outside of  “golden hour” but closer to those times than noon.  


So any control  over lighting in this situation was done by time of day and position of  the camera. We know that is was taken with little to no cloud cover as  the shadows are sharp and distinct, and with the camera nearly  perpendicular to the path of the sun (so facing north if it was taken in  the evening, or south if it was taken in the morning).  


Going by that positioning, we can describe the shot as taken with *near lighting*, side-lit or slightly backlit, with a single hard, specular light.   


# Artistic Use 

Once you understand the basics of exposure and lighting, it’s fairly simple to get a well-lit photo. There’s more to a photo than just having the shot well lit however, and a large part of creative lighting is deciding what parts of the scene to light, and from what direction.  
 

Do you want only the subject lit? Do you need some of the scene illuminated as well, but want it’s exposure to be darker than the subject? Or do you prefer more of a silhouette? And does that silhouette have a well-lit background, or a single strong source? For a set or series, how similar does the light need to be? Will it look cohesive simply by choosing near or far lighting? Do you want a single hard light in your shots to tie them together, or do you want an even more uniform look and need the same light placement? Does hard vs. soft matter as much to you as that similar lighting placement?  
 

Knowing what you want the end result to look like, and by extension where to place the lights (or place your subject within the light), is an important step in planning a photo. Deciding on the lighting can sometimes be as simple as using what’s practical and available, but utilizing the lights can be purely artistic.  
 

Scenes that are darker or more low-key tend to have a more imposing, ominous, or lonely, or more intimate feel to them. In contrast, brighter scenes tend to be more cheerful, carefree, or personal. The exact emotion evoked can vary quite a bit depending on the exact lighting but the different styles tend to fall in those categories.  
 

You can use that emotional response either to strengthen the response from your audience by using a lighting scheme that works with your composition or to add a dissonance by working opposite to your composition and coloration. A well-lit, evenly exposed shot that has harmonious but faded colors and a smaller subject centered with lots of negative space can use the brighter emotions of the lighting and colors with the more “lonely” emotions from the negative space and muted tones to cause a contrast in emotional response that can be stronger than a single emotion due to it’s conflicting nature. In the same vein, a low-key close up with bright colors can cause conflicting responses that build on each other and add to the effect.  
 

On the other hand, conflicting responses can also simply make the shot look unintentional. It’s definitely worth experimenting with but focus more on what you feel from the result than any chart or list of what styles give what emotions. Knowing the general response is a good starting point, but don’t be afraid to deviate from the general consensus if your lighting isn’t giving you the emotional response you want out of your shot.  
 

# Planning the Scene

 [https://imgur.com/a/qEIkWCR](https://imgur.com/a/qEIkWCR)

    While some scenes may be more spontaneous and not allow for strict planning, having an idea of what you wish to capture can allow you to position yourself to still use the lighting to your advantage.  In this photo for example, there was less than a minute between seeing the scene unfolding and losing the chance to get the shot. Prior planning of the lighting to keep a consistent look across a series of photos taken throughout the year allowed for an unplanned shot that fit thematically with other shots taken months apart.

To get to the most basic question of lighting setup- Where do you want the light to hit?  
 

Knowing the answer to that question will dictate where your lights need to be, or for a natural light environment where (and when) you need to position yourself. Do you want a dark, low-key portrait with Rembrandt lighting? You’ll need a single light source that’s highly directional, either from a grid or flags, with the light positioned based on where the model is facing to get the shadows on the face in the correct place. Are you looking to get a dramatic landscape? Besides finding the right location, you will also want find the right time and weather to fit your vision. Do you want a quaint coffee shop scene? When does the light shine through the window, or do you have lights you can use to replicate that?  
 

How much of the room needs lit? You may need to either add more lights (or reflectors), or you may need to use flags to keep it from being too bright. Maybe a scrim would help to act as a flag without cutting the light completely on the background. Haze could be used to soften the entire scene without needing to use a softer light and can help the light stand out as an element on its own.  
 

If you plan how you want the light to look, working back to where you need to place lights or position your subject becomes easier and involves less trial to get the scene you want.",1,1729047173.0,photoclass,0,1.0,False

Backstory: 
Recently transitioned from debit to credit and was doing a rough monthly budget before, nothing too strict. But at the same time was making sure I wasn’t over spending and adjusting things as needed. 

As a trial run, to see if this budgeting style works for me I’m going to start from scratch and not enter my total checking account amount. I’m going to start with my single paycheck I get this week and just enter that amount. 

For example, let’s say I get paid $1500 every 2 weeks. now my budget is bi-weekly, I spend my paycheck over 2 weeks. 

Now my questions are: 
- each paycheck (I.e 1500) should be distributed  in my categories until I have $0 left? 

- If my categories get filled up, but I still have money left over, can I just put that additional money into my savings category like add extra to it besides the amount I budgeted? 

- If 1 category goes unused, that money rolls over to the next month? It’s budgeted, but not used, correct? 

- If I usually budget $300 a month for groceries then I’m going to budget $150/ paycheck aka every 2 weeks? 

- in the case of running out of funds in one category, I can move money from another but what if my paycheck won’t cover my expenses for the next 2 weeks after I’ve covered the necessities? ( bills/rent/grocery) 

I know this may sound like a stupid question cause I feel silly typing it out lol But what I mean by asking this is if I want to budgeted $50 for coffee and $50 for clothes but my current paycheck doesn’t cover that, then I can’t fill those categories until the next paycheck, so that means I can’t buy those things until next paycheck either? 

- and for the credit cards, do I add a certain amount in that category from each paycheck as well, or can I just add the total balance from a single paycheck when it’s closer to the due date? For example if I get paid in the last 2 weeks, and my bill is due in those last 2 weeks I can either use that paycheck entirely to pay it off or I can take a certain amount from both paychecks? Is there any specific way to go about this? I’m not sure if I understand the whole credit card concept yet 

I know this is pretty extensive, but I hope someone with experience can help me out! ",3,1729046987.0,ynab,2,1.0,False

What now excites me is to write some of it instead of just reading it. I'm embarrassed to admit it because now it's so mainstream, but I'm a massive fan of the Dune series. Watching Dune part 1 in the theater was almost a religious experience for me. Some scenes in Dune 2 were great but overall it was a massive letdown.

Things I've tried in the past and no longer do, but could talk to you about if you're interested:

- Ballroom and swing dancing
- Iranian Students Foundation (I'm not Iranian, maybe that's why I didn't feel like I belonged here).
- Jewish life on campus (used to do a lot of this but not anymore).

Please send me a DM if this interests you and we can grab coffee and go and sit on McKeldin Mall!

Happy to send pictures if you want.

1g4p7v9,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1g4p7v9/venting_about_my_hellish_3month_and_counting/,Venting About My Hellish 3-Month (and Counting) Post-College Job Hunt,"I really don't care if anyone sees this, I just need to get this off my chest.

I had heard about how hard it is to get hired after graduating, but OH MY GOD, it is so much worse than I ever could have imagined.

So I went to college (a very average school--nowhere fancy but a decently well-known, legitimate, local university) and I got my bachelor's degree. I also worked the same, full-time job for three years as a student. Given this, I naively thought ""oh yeah I can get a job no problem."" To be clear, my expectations were not high at all. I knew I wouldn't be working in the field I studied and got a degree in. I innocently believed that having a bachelor's degree (+3 years of related prior work experience) would be able to get me the most bog standard, basic office job. But after 50+ applications to a variety of jobs like this (all of which specified little to no experience and an associate's degree as the minimum qualifications), I have had zero luck. I've gotten three interviews and that's it. The part that pisses me off the most is how damn long it takes to even get a response. I've waited up to a month and a half only to randomly get an automated email saying ""this position has been filled"" or ""this position has been withdrawn."" I did an interview a MONTH ago that I have STILL not heard back about--I emailed one of the recruiters to ask if I was still being considered, and they said they are still ""working on it."" That was over a week ago now. To clarify, THIS IS A $14 AN HOUR POSITION THAT IS BASICALLY JUST A GLORIFIED RECEPTIONIST POSITION. Why the hell is it taking over a month for me to even hear back about this!?

When I realized it was going to take a while to find a ""real job"", I decided to look for employment elsewhere in retail/fast food/etc. to help bring in some extra money. I thought this, at least, would be easy enough. In college, I worked summer jobs at places like this, and the hiring process never took more than a week or so. That's why I am sitting here, two-and-a-half weeks after applying to well over a dozen of these jobs, totally baffled. I am not applying to work at the fucking White House or whatever--I applied to places like Kroger and IHOP. What is the delay? I genuinely do not understand--why was I, as a student, able to get a job at places like this so much more easily than I, as a graduate with a degree? It should be the opposite, right? I thought the reason I went and got a degree in the first place was because that would HELP ME GET A JOB!

And the worst part about this is that I have NO ONE to vent to this about irl because it's just so embarrassing to even talk about, to have to admit that ""yeah I've been unemployed for three months, even though I've been trying very hard."" There's also a psychological element of guilt I feel whenever I spend money on anything besides groceries or rent that's caused me to feel uncomfortable on doing fun things to take my mind off this mess (I can't go to a coffee shop or go see a movie without my brain whispering ""you're unemployed. you shouldn't be wasting money on unnecessary things like this!""). And the process of finding/applying to jobs is so damn exhausting on top of that. I just keep refreshing my email over and over and over again every day, expecting a job offer to be there--or at least an offer for an interview, only to get nothing and feeling really upset. Having to endure all this has been so discouraging and depressing.",3,1729046121.0,recruitinghell,2,1.0,False

I(f25)  got on hinge and met  M(34) we have a good amount in common and plan on getting coffee on Friday.  I've known him 2 weeks and we had one phone conversation that went well, But he complimented me like 20 times throughout the 2 hour convo, I mean at some point  you stop being able to reply and it just kinda kills the conversation?

once I felt that it was excessive i laid it out gently and explained that I'm not sure what to say, and maybe pace it if thats something he enjoyed but that i accept his complemmts and its kindnof him to share but the excess made me a bit uncomfortable. He was very sweet about it, but in the next 20 minutes he kept the same pace but added an apology after. This confused me but i didnt say anythig because i thought maybe hes just nervous? Ofc I understand wanting to compliment someone you like I just don't understand why he felt the need to say every single one that pops in his head

I'm giving him the benifit of the doubt because I feel that  this may  just be in my head and that I need to get over my ""compliment ick"", he seems genuinely nice, and kind,  and I'm a pretty good judge of character, he doesn't seem weird or anything I just can't get the excessive complementing out of my head and need someone to tell me if im crazy or if this is an ick  for others too?

I'm asking for some ideas personally for me anyone can think of.

My main goal is to meet a woman but I want a place I can go and enjoy regardless and without the sole purpose of finding someone.

I've never been to a bar and wouldnt know what to do besides stare at a wall (also none of my friends want to go with me)

I would feel uncomfortable in a cafe, I dont read or drink coffee. Though I may try it at some point. But talking to a woman at a cafe would feel like I'm just bothering these poor lady's.

I dont think any hiker is going to stop and want to talk to strangers.

I wouldnt know what class to take and I dont think we have much around me.

Maybe I've spent to much time being antisocial and I'm the problem. Any advice would be great and I'm willing to go out of my comfort zone as long as I know what I'm getting into. Again my main goal wouldnt be meeting woman, but I would like that rare chance that it would happen.

Also would I start a friendship first or straight up say ""yo you kinda cute ngl"".",1,1729045420.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

What brought me into love addiction recovery places was my issue with having emotional affairs. Right now, I'm having rumination because another female co-worker has ghosted me. It started with me saving her parking spot, emails but nothing personal, then bam. No contact. 

This is not the only female worker who has ghosted me. Another one years ago in 2018, when she was emailing me and chatting with me, all of a sudden just ghosted me, what triggered it I have no idea. I used to make coffee for the office and some didn't want any, some did, and now, that is a daily reminder of how my limerence begins and ends. I get ghosted. I guess I need these harsh reminders that I am here to work and not fool around. My cycle proves that I can't have any female friends, it's completely obvious to me. Anyway, I am working on what is causing my cycles of limerence and triggers and pre-triggers and who to be in a calm, sober state not seeking any attention from women. At work, it's getting easier, and I don't even want to make any eye contact with anyone, even if they are honestly trying to just do work and be profession, I can't stand making any eye contact now and I can't stand it when someone is a female customer and I have to help. 



I become like a robot now without any emotions and kind of dead inside now. But honestly, this is how I prefer it, because if I was the other way, it would be all happy and flirtatious and I am so very tired of going down this route and I need to be with integrity. I also shared some of my issues in a men only addiction meeting I attend once a week. Then we prayed together. Anyways, I hope you are doing ok and getting help for whatever issues you are current facing. This is crazy and sinister. 

Honestly, I want people to ghost me, perhaps I will be helped with my own boundaries and learn more too. ",1,1729045308.0,loveaddiction,1,1.0,False

Today, I made amends with a situationship and found closure in our relationship. We both realized that it would be best for us to remain friends just like we used to since we had been using our connection to distract ourselves from the pain caused by our long-term exes.

Having an open conversation about our feelings was truly a wake-up call for me. It’s time for me to focus on personal growth and become the woman I’m meant to be. I also want to get back into reading, as I believe that embarking on this journey of self-discovery will be incredibly beneficial!

I’d love some book recommendations for a young female audience (I’m 21). I’m looking for books that explore themes of self-love, self-worth, moving on, and most importantly, being OKAY with and PROUD of being single.

My goal is to become an independent, strong woman who doesn’t rely on a man for happiness. If the right person comes along, I want to view him not as my other half, but as a whole individual with his own feelings and complexities—and they just so happen to be my boyfriend who I love deeply. 

I prefer to pick up a copy of the book at a bookstore like Barnes & Noble just because I like to have a physical copy to look cute while reading at a coffee shop or keep in my tote bag hehe! I could search online, but I feel like I can get the best book recommendations from people who are going through/have gone through a similar experience to me!
