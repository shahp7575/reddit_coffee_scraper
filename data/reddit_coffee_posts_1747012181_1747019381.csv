I'm seeking new friends to share interests with, broaden my horizons, and talk about boring day-to-day.
Perhaps, like me, you navigate the world with a touch of social awkwardness. In the hustle and bustle of daily life, striking up conversations or forming deep connections can sometimes feel like navigating a crowded room blindfolded. But here, within the comfortable space of written correspondence, those barriers gently fade away. There's a unique freedom in crafting your thoughts, taking the time to articulate your feelings, and sharing your true self without the immediate pressures of face-to-face interaction.
As a mom, my world is often filled with pure chaos and never ending to-do lists. While I love my kidda, finding time for adult connection and exploring my own interests can sometimes feel like a luxury. Yet another benefit to meeting people online.
Beyond the realm of parenting, my curiosity stretches far and wide. As a teacher, I have a deep appreciation for learning and exploring new ideas. My interests are a bit of a tapestry, woven with threads of literature and history, the beauty of nature and the intricacies of science, the creativity of art and music, and the comforting embrace of a good cup of coffee. I find joy in delving into different subjects, and I'm always eager to learn something new from the diverse experiences and perspectives of others.
Here, you'll find a community of individuals as varied and fascinating as the world itself.

I’m a barista based in Australia, looking to set up a home espresso station mainly for espresso and milk-based drinks (flat whites, lattes, etc.).

It’s mostly just me drinking coffee at home, so I don’t need volume — just quality and consistency.

I’m torn between two setups, both within my \~A$1000 budget:

**☕ Option 1:**

* Brand new **Breville Bambino Plus**
* Brand new **Turin DF54 grinder**
* Total: \~A$900

**☕ Option 2:**

* Used **Breville Dual Boiler (BES920)**
* Used **Breville Smart Grinder Pro**
* Total: \~A$1000

# What I’m Looking For:

* Great espresso and milk steaming performance
* Consistency and reliability
* Okay with basic maintenance
* **Not a big fan of the Dual Boiler’s look**, but can live with it
* Making 1–2 drinks a day, solo use

# Questions:

* For home use, is the Bambino + DF54 combo enough, or is the Dual Boiler setup worth the extra risk/cost?
* How do they compare for milk steaming and workflow?
* Any regrets or things you wish you'd known before choosing either?

Appreciate any feedback or experience. Thanks!",1,1747019125.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

It’s like a caffeine-themed magic trick: *“Is this espresso or dishwater? Surprise!”* Let’s percolate through the hype.

# 3 Brew Styles: Classic, Rich, and “Why Bother?”

*Classic* = coffee that tastes like yesterday’s regrets. *Rich* = *slightly* bolder, like someone whispered “espresso” near the beans. *Over Ice* = a heroic attempt to make iced coffee without the “ice” part. Spoiler: It’s just cold sadness.

# 10-Cup Carafe: For When You Need Coffee for 10… or 1 Ambivalent Ghost

The *glass carafe* holds 10 cups of liquid amnesia, kept “hot” for up to 4 hours on the *adjustable warming plate*. Translation: \*Room-temperature ennui by hour 2\*. Pro tip: Reheat it in the microwave and pretend you’re living your best life.

# Iced Coffee That’s “Never Watered Down”: Unless You Count Tears

The *Vivid iced coffee* feature is *so* vivid, you’ll vividly wonder where the flavor went. It’s like drinking coffee-flavored air—light, refreshing, and utterly pointless. Pair it with existential crisps (not included).

# Removable Water Tank: Because Spills Build Character

The *pull-away reservoir* is a marvel of engineering… if your idea of fun is playing *Will It Leak?* every refill. Bonus: It doubles as a modern art piece titled *“Drip: A Study in Desperation.”*

# 6 Brew Sizes: From “Single Cup” to “Why Is My Travel Mug Weeping?”

Brew a *single cup* for yourself, an *XL cup* for your delusions, or a *full carafe* to share with your pet rock. The *“XL travel size”* is perfect for commutes, assuming your commute is 3 feet to the couch.

# Renewed™: A Fancy Word for “Someone Else’s Coffee Stains”

*Amazon Renewed* means it’s been “lovingly refurbished” by a robot with a grudge. The *missing double-sided scoop*? Consider it a metaphor for life’s unanswered questions.

# Verdict: A Caffeine-Cursed Roulette Wheel

If you enjoy Russian roulette with your morning joe (“Will it brew? Will it leak? Will it judge me?”), the [Ninja CM300 Renewed](https://amzn.to/4ddljbH) is *perfect*. It’s the coffee maker for people who think “meh” is a flavor profile.

Asset or liability for my resume?,"Tl;DR If you saw that someone had worked one week as a barista, would you be more or less likely to hire them than someone with zero experience? What if they lead with a reference/contact # from the store manager?



I got hired a couple of weeks ago with no prior coffee experience at a pretty hot new location for a local chain. It seemed to be going really well! I was working hard, learning fast, and keeping a positive attitude. I got tons of very positive feedback, even during a Saturday shift with lines out the door where I was on bar for 9 straight hours.

So I was shocked to get a call from my manager after only a week that I wasn't a good fit for the location and was getting cut. In retrospect it was maybe a red flag that all of my co-workers had been hired earlier that month and they still had more people to train after me? My hunch is that they overhired, but idk. I'm pretty torn up about it, tbh, but it was good experience.



So I'm applying for barista jobs now and I'm trying to figure out how to frame this. My manager (who seemed to like me??) said she'd be happy to be a reference. So for my last application I omitted it from my resume but included a cover letter that outlined:

1. I've been trained as a barista

2. Their employment needs ""had shifted""

3. BUT I got excellent feedback (in multitasking, speed of improvement, etc.)

4. My manager can confirm this and here's their contact #

just wanna to share a bit of my journey so far, especially for anyone just starting out or on the fence about trying keto. I’ve been doing this for 2 months now, and I’m already seeing change in my body, energy, and mindset. I begun at around 205lbs, feeling tired all the time, bloated, and honestly not too confident in myself. My diet was a mess, lots of carbs, late-night snacking, and very little structure. I knew had to change something for my sake of my health.

I heard about keto sometimes back but always thought it sounded too strict for me. I done some research and reading stories here on Reddit, and decided give it shot. I clean out my pantry, stocked up on eggs, avocados, leafy greens, cheese, salmon, and got serious about tracking my macros. finally , I started.

The first week was rough (hello keto flu), but once I pushed through that, the cravings started fading and my energy actually increased. I used to crash mid-afternoon, but now I can even go through the day without reaching for a sugary snack or extra coffee. Feeling good with this achievement, no matter how small it might be seen. One thing that helped massively was finding a meal service called “Eat Clean” that offers keto-friendly meals. sometimes I don’t always have time to cook every day, so having ready-to-go, macro-balanced meals in the fridge made it easy stay on track. the guesswork out of lunch and dinner and helped me stay consistent when life got hectic.

I’ve also been walking more, hit the gym 3to4x a week consistently, drinking a lot of water, and getting better sleep by cutting screen time at night. The changes are accumulating.

I’m now down to 185lbs, clothes are fitting better, my face looks leaner, and I feel good again,  physically and mentally. Still have a ways to go, but the momentum is real. Love myself now.

If you're just getting into keto, my advice is: keep it simple, don’t stress over perfection, and focus on consistency over intensity. The results will follow. Remember that Discipline takes you to places where motivation cant. One meal, one day, one week at a time. Let’s keep going 💪

Bitcoin is everywhere these days—from online marketplaces to physical coffee shops, you can use your favorite cryptocurrency just like cash (but way cooler). And guess what’s bringing Bitcoin even closer to the average person on the street? Bitcoin ATMs. Yep, they exist, and they’re multiplying faster than your grandma’s cat collection.

So, what’s a Bitcoin ATM, anyway? Imagine your regular ATM—cold, metallic, and forever judging you for checking your balance too often. Now give it a glow-up: instead of dispensing paper bills, it zips BTC straight into your digital wallet. No banks, no questions, just peer-to-peer power. Whether you’re buying or selling, a Bitcoin ATM puts crypto into your hands within minutes. It’s fast, it’s efficient, and yes—it makes you feel a little like a spy on a secret mission.

But hold up—what if you're running a business or event and want to *accept* Bitcoin just as smoothly? You could scribble your BTC address on a napkin and hope for the best… or you could use a sleek, scannable, professional solution like the [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).

This nifty little app turns your boring Bitcoin address into a QR code that’s ready for action. Just enter your BTC address (and optionally a specific amount), and boom—you get a custom payment QR code faster than you can say “Satoshi Nakamoto.” You can print it, embed it on your website, or tape it to your vending machine and let the satoshis roll in. It’s perfect for merchants, artists, fundraisers, lemonade stands—basically anyone who wants to accept Bitcoin with style.

So picture this: You're at a local street fair. There's a Bitcoin ATM in the corner like some futuristic cash machine. Someone withdraws BTC, turns around, and sees your stand with a Bitcoin QR code proudly displayed. They scan it, pay you in seconds, and walk away with your product while you watch your wallet balance go *ding!* That’s the future we’re living in, and it’s happening now.

Bitcoin ATMs and QR code payments are transforming the way we think about money. No banks, no waiting, no middlemen—just direct, decentralized transactions that put the power in your hands. Whether you’re buying BTC on the go or accepting it like a pro, tools like the Bitcoin QR Code Maker make the process smooth, secure, and kinda fun too.

Ready to join the movement? Spin up your QR code magic over at [**bitcoinqrcodemaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) and make your Bitcoin transactions as effortless as tapping a screen. The future of money is here—and it’s scannable.",1,1747017949.0,BitcoinQR,0,1.0,False

But there’s a deeper, easily overlooked layer to his character especially in how he treats his mom, Gloria.

Gloria raised Manny as a single mother after coming to the U.S., working multiple jobs just to give him a decent life. Despite that, Manny who clearly has expensive taste and a love for affluent things never comes off as spoiled or demanding. He likely wanted nice things, but you can tell he never asked for them when they couldn’t afford it. That quiet restraint says a lot.

Fast forward to when Gloria marries Jay, a multi-millionaire. Now that, they can afford luxury, and Gloria starts letting Manny indulge in nice clothes, fancy coffee, etc. But the beautiful part? Manny still remains grounded. He doesn’t treat it like something he’s entitled to. He enjoys it, sure but there’s no arrogance, no ungratefulness. Just a subtle appreciation, like he knows where he came from and how hard his mom worked.

He also never resents their past. No bitterness. Just gratitude, loyalty, and a mature understanding of sacrifice. In a way, he romanticized life before the wealth through books, imagination, and emotional depth instead of feeling sorry for himself.

Honestly, that’s what makes Manny such a wonderful son. Not just the hugs and compliments, but the silent support, the unspoken gratitude, and how he carried his mom’s sacrifices with quiet dignity.",24,1747017853.0,Modern_Family,1,0.96,False

1kkhyie,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1kkhyie/i_feel_like_i_cant_get_through_a_day_without/,I feel like I can't get through a day without yelling,"The baby doesn't sleep through the night, and the toddler recently stopped napping. I'm stay-at-home with no support from my husband during business hours. If I drink caffeine, my anxiety spikes and I become super irritable and agitated and have so little patience. If I don't drink coffee I become moody and can't focus. 

My daughter is almost 3 and everything is a fight. Using the potty. Washing hands. Eating. Getting dressed. Literally any time I try to get any chore done. I have to feed baby in the carrier because if I can't multitasking playing with her, she screams like a banshee, and her screams are so loud I literally sometimes wonder if it will damage my ears. She hits and pushes other kids, she doesn't share, she doesn't take turns, the park and playdates are all a nightmare, and every transition is pulling teeth. 

I gentle parent. I read How to Talk So Little Kids Will Listen. I set boundaries. I give her age-appropriate responsibility. She has a routine. I read her books about empathy, emotional regulation, behavior. I do time-ins instead of time-outs. I give her deep pressure-stimulation-outlets, I limit screen time, ive her quiet time, I try to create a yes-space. I take her to playgroups, playdates, dance classes, kid-friendly museums, I do quiet time, we play with neighbour kids almost every day. I give MYSELF breaks whenever I reasonably can, I take a full-dose of SSRIs. I practice deep-breathing and meditation. 

But it feels like before each day ends, I lose it at least once. When the baby stopped sleeping through the night it just felt like each day was an escalation until the weekend. And when I tried drinking coffee to cope, I'd be on the verge of a panic attack for all afternoon. My husband asked me to stop drinking coffee. But I don't know what to do. We can't afford help. 

How am I supposed to white-knuckle it?

TLDR; I yell when I'm too tired/over-stimulated and when my daughter won't stop yelling at me. I don't know what other coping Options I have that I haven't tried already. ",3,1747017557.0,toddlers,2,1.0,False

I crave connection, especially with women, but when it comes to actually putting myself out there-dating apps, social events, asking people out - I shut down, just like the guy in the meme.

1kkhspw,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/1kkhspw/imperial_investigator/,Imperial Investigator,"Alright, folks, pull up a crate. My brain, that glorious, sputtering mess, has conjured another Star Wars notion from the usual fog of mild despair and caffeine abuse. Don't get your hopes up; most ideas these days feel like re-heated caf from last week. But this one... this one might have just enough grim satisfaction to be worth mentioning, especially if you're the type, like me, who finds a strange comfort in the universe's inherent absurdities.

We're going back to **Tatooine**. Yes, again. I know, it’s the galaxy’s armpit. But hear me out. We’re not following some bright-eyed hero. No, we’re saddled with an **Imperial Investigator** – which is just a fancy label for some poor schmuck in stormtrooper armor playing detective in a place where the sand gets into everything, including your will to live.

Let's call our champion of reluctant law enforcement... Kael. Just Kael. No heroic callsign, no fancy rank he actually cares about. He’s the guy who probably made one too many honest remarks during an Imperial HR seminar and now his career path involves sifting through the dregs of a planet that God, the Force, or whatever cosmic entity is out there, clearly forgot. He’s got that permanently unimpressed look that only comes from explaining to a Jawa for the third time that, no, his blaster is not for sale.

And here's where it gets that special kind of ""why me?"" charm: Kael’s not alone in his misery. He's got a family. A partner, maybe a kid who’s already too good at mimicking the sound of a womp rat dying. They’re living in some pre-fabricated Imperial slum that’s only slightly less likely to be swallowed by a krayt dragon than the average mud hut. So, picture this sad sack, strapping on his sun-bleached armor, knowing his day will involve mediating a dispute between two nerf herders over a stolen bantha prod, then coming home smelling of Hutt sweat and regret. It’s the dream.

The tone? Imagine a cop show written by someone who’s deeply tired of everyone’s crap but still has to show up to work.

* **The ""Department"":** Kael’s station is probably a crumbling administrative building where the most advanced piece of tech is a coffee machine that occasionally dispenses something resembling motor oil. His colleagues are a collection of life’s other participants: the rookie who still thinks ""serving the Empire"" is a noble calling (bless his naive heart), and the veteran who communicates exclusively through grunts and pointing.
* **The ""Perps"":** We're not talking grand galactic conspiracies. We're talking a local moisture farmer who ""accidentally"" rerouted his neighbor's water supply. Or a back-alley Sabacc game that ended with someone getting creatively acquainted with a gaffi stick. Petty, desperate, and depressingly human (or alien) stuff. The kind of crime that happens when hope has packed its bags and caught the last transport off-world. And maybe, just maybe, something vaguely important falls into his lap, forcing him to care for five minutes before the universe reminds him why that’s usually a mistake.

Sometimes I just sit here and imagine the paperwork involved. ""Reason for blaster discharge: suspect attempted to use a decomposed rancor spleen as a personal flotation device in a sand dune. Suspect did not float."" Where was I? Ah, yes, the inherent joylessness of Imperial bureaucracy. Apologies, my mind tends to wander down these grim, fascinating little alleyways. It’s probably a coping mechanism.

The point of all this bleak beauty is that it’s not about saving the galaxy. It's about one guy trying to do a job that’s 90% futility and 10% dealing with aliens who think personal hygiene is a suggestion. It’s about the quiet desperation, the gallows humor, and the weird, unexpected moments of… well, not kindness, Kael isn't exactly a dispenser of warm fuzzies, but maybe grudging professional courtesy. He’s the type who'd complain about everyone and everything but would still probably share his last ration stick with a particularly pathetic-looking Bith, grumbling the whole time.

This is for those of us whose preferred Star Wars aesthetic is ""slightly used and fundamentally flawed."" A story about the Empire from the bottom looking up, with a protagonist who’s just as cynical as we are.

So, lay it on me. Is this brand of organized chaos something you'd watch? What kind of utterly pointless, soul-destroying cases do you think Kael should have to deal with on a Tuesday?",0,1747017027.0,StarWars,1,0.5,False
1kkhrxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kkhrxz/hr_crimson_halls/,[HR] Crimson Halls,"**CW: This story contains implied themes of school shootings and trauma. Reader discretion is advised.**

“How did it feel?”

The same crimson colour cascades across the walls, filling your eyes as your mind swirls to conjure an answer to the almost arbitrary question. A haze of panic clouds your thoughts, and for a moment, you're lost in the memories of it all—unable to separate the past from the present.

“I was scared.”

You reply with haste, almost yelling, as your mind spews the first reply it thinks of. Something easy, digestible. 

“Just scared?”

It was more of a rage-filled frustration; one which had not gone, ever since; one which lingers within one’s soul for a lifetime. An omnipotent presence. You want to scream. To tear your skin open and pull out your hair until someone understands. Until you understand. 	

…You stay silent. 

Silence. Silence irritated you. Made you feel like you were simply existing to wait for your death. And here it was again—an interrogation room. Cold, sterile, thick. Your thoughts rush to fill the void. Vivid imagery of the moments rushes through your head. You could still smell the gunpowder, you could still hear the screams. You could feel the splashes of red, warm, sickening, as it hit your skin. It sticks in your brain like a stain you can’t scrub out.  

“And I am angry.”

You finally say, to break the pressure, to fill the awful, suffocating quiet. But, it wasn’t quite the truth. You were angry. Now? Now it's something worse. A nameless feeling had evolved. It stretched long and gray and hollow inside you. It’s not fury anymore—it’s confusion. Shame. A gnawing grief with no direction. 

“Listen,” the officer says, softening his voice. We’ll need you to testify since you were friends with him before he did it. Are you willing to come to court?”

You flinch at the word “friend.” Your stomach coils, knots tightening with guilt and disbelief. 

“Can I think about it?”

“Of course, take as much time as you need.”

You walk out of the police station. The door clicking behind you is sharper than it should be. The sun is too bright, the breeze is too strong, and the city is too loud, too alive.  The world continues to move past you like nothing happened. It disgusts you. People are sipping their coffee, laughing with their friends, and scrolling through their phones. You are stuck. Frozen in time. Left in those hallways feeling an impending sense of doom, knowing the next breath might be your last. You feel like a smudge—like something someone forgot to clean up. 

 why? Why? WHY? The word tumbles through your mind, sawing through your conscience like broken glass. Why did he do it? Why didn’t he talk to you? Why couldn’t you stop him? Why are you alive? Why did YOU get to walk away? 

The name of the feeling dawns on you. It isn’t just anger. Or confusion. Or fear. It's disgust towards him, towards the world, towards yourself. 

You sit on the curb, watching a leaf spin down into the gutter, for a split second, you wonder what would’ve happened if things had been different. 

But there are no answers, just questions. 

And silence.

For context, I'm a 35 year old bloke from the UK, who had been single from the age of 26 to 34. The relationship I'd been in at 26 was horrible, and ended with a lot of heartbreak for me. 

For the next 8 years I stayed single more or less on purpose. I did the odd tinder or bumble date, but nothing ever worked out. I'd kind of got used to the idea that I'd end up all alone- especially after my dear old mum and dad would finally shuffle off this mortal coil.

Then last year, a match came in on Tinder. The most beautiful creature I'd ever seen. Same age as me. Not from these parts, but had come to the UK to do her postgraduate study, and now working here. We chatted on that app for two weeks, then I made the plunge and asked her to meet for coffee.

I had no idea that the girl who came through that door, smiling a bit shyly, would become the most important part of my life. That she'd become my life itself! We dated, and feelings started coming pretty quickly. I knew after about two months that this was different.

Last December, we took a romantic trip away together and it was then that the L word first appeared, and was reciprocated. Since then, it has been spoken or typed between us every single day. However, after that trip, I had a pretty significant mental health wobble, and I know that while it was super tough for her, she held on so tight- even when it was hard for her to hold on. Her love brought me out of it, and we've been pushing on together ever since. I think of it in the sense that she gives me the strength to fight the battles that I'm not sure up front I can win.

I can't imagine my life without her. Every time I picture her face, I smile like an idiot. And I found that seeing her cry hurts me in ways I didn't know I could hurt. If anyone upsets her, I'd gladly go through them for a shortcut.

All that matters to me is that we're together and that she's happy. And seeing her smile is more beautiful than a thousand sunrises. I now plan everything in my life around our relationship. It's not that our relationship is a part of my life- it is my life.

This is full on I know, but it's how I feel, and I didn't know it was possible to feel like this, and I didn't think anything this good would ever happen for me.",5,1747016615.0,love,2,1.0,False
1kkhnzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1kkhnzo/im_tired/,I’m tired.,"I’m tired of being useless, my future is going absolutely nowhere. I should have died at birth (premature, 23 weeks 2 days) I was meant to die. My parents told me they didn’t smile at me when I was born because “What’s the point if you weren’t going to survive anyway.” Ever since then my parents have put the blame on me, and their stresses and guilt.



I have achieved nothing so far, and I will continue to do so, not because I can’t, but because my family doesn’t expect much from me. I live to be thrown around and treated like I’m lesser than the average person.





I’m tired of being ugly. I’m tired of having to look in the mirror and see a fucking ugly worthless cunt. My face isn’t good enough, my body isn’t good enough, and my voice is horrid. I will never be able to love myself because I’ve been told it’s ugly and malnourished all my life.



I’ve been constantly bullied throughout my life, CSA’d, physically and verbally assaulted, stalked home from work because of how I look, recorded in public, beaten, emotionally and verbally abused by my parents throughout my childhood and continuing into my adult life.

  


With social media, I’m tired of getting a few likes on my photos and no comments on my pics, and losing followers whenever I post (or don’t post) a photo. No matter what I do I’ll never be able to be loved online and in person. The only comments that existed on my pics were years ago, while I was in school, all from cyber bullies telling me I was:

* ugly
* fat
* anorexic
* “an emo pedophile who cuts himself 24/7”
* “Kys. Cutting yourself is retarded”
* “Sexual child molester”
* “Stop cutting yourself and grow up”

While simultaneously being messaged by 3 different accounts, cyber bullies saying worse things to me than what I’ve listed.



I’m tired of never being good enough for my parents. They don’t have any hope for me, they don’t care what I do, and yet they tell me I’m not ‘trying hard enough’ and ‘this isn’t good enough’ when I’m working part time. 

  
Work is the same too, I’ve told my manager I’d like to work 30hrs a week. It’s been months and they haven’t increased, but decreased my hours to 10hrs a week. My manager said she’s “Working on it”. I’ve had to stop doing trolley collection due to my anorexia, so now I’m receiving less and less hours.



I wake up, have a coffee and sometimes breakfast, go to work, come home, try to eat dinner, and struggle with sleep. I don’t fall to sleep until 2am, and I wake up at 7. 

  


I’ve written 4 albums of lyrics, but due to my parents saying I’ll never get anywhere in life by “doing that useless stuff”, because “it’s not a real job” I’ve stopped. I find no joy in singing or drawing anymore. There’s no point in doing what I love if I won’t be good enough, or get anywhere. 

  


It’s only fair if I take my life. 

Sure, people will tell me “Austin, it gets better” It does not get better, I just learn to cope(?) with living like this.

  
I’m sick of living.

First, a bit about me:

* I love cooking at home
* I love tv and movies
* I occasionally play games on a PC
* I will occasionally work from home
* I'd like to have friends over to cook, play board games, and/or watch movies
* I'd like to put up art on the walls slowly over time

Given those facts about me, my wish list has been:

* A queen sized bed
* A comfortable sofa + tv setup for cozy movie watching and casual board gaming
* A larger table for eating + playing more intense board games
* A small desk for gaming/wfh

With all of that in mind, how are these layouts? Are there specific red flags with any of the layouts? Are there things I need to sacrifice in order to maximize the space?

Life is fucking tough, specially when we are building something
Life is fucking hard when you wanted to live a life as you wanted 

Specially when you are in late 20's me in 28, its a different story all together the more we approach practical thinking age the more we start feeling all our dreams of doing this and that are not possible in this life and had to accept it and work on something that achievable and move on

Specially being raised in a middle class life it's fucking hard to explain your parents why you don't want to get married, why you wanted to travel the world,why you wanted to try million things and explore, experience life why not be a common dude like all.

Life is fucking tough, yet let's try and make it work by taking one step at a time

If I have the following products:

1. Milk
2. Heavy cream 

In more than a small dose my next day is uncomfortable with a heavy head and slight gas. 

One splash of milk in my coffee doesn't do much, but a bowl of ice cream or some heavy cream based dessert or sauce makes me feel like crap the next day (heavy head, light gas, doesn't go away with anything, just time) 

However, if I have butter or yogurt or cheese I haven't had any issues. Even if I have a bowl full of yogurt or four slices of pizza I'm fine.

Customer service through Keurig has proven more irritating than it is useless, which is pretty amazing. Their technical service team have no idea and probably haven’t used their products and just read from a script.

My keurig has started leaking water (not brewed coffee) around the bottom rim of the basket when it is brewing either a pod or a thermal carafe of coffee. I have cleaned it out at descaled it, but this still seems to be the case.

My initial presumption was The penetrating hole from the pod holder was becoming clogged, and the water was overflowing the pod holder and down into the basket. However, cleaning that out did not resolve it and when brewing a pot, I also get this leakage, which, unfortunately, being on the very outer rim of the bottom of the basket leaks down the outside of the carafe. While making a cup of coffee with a pond water drips all way around the outside of the cup and I find some freshwater in the filter basket.

(fyi he DIDNT plan anything. besides a card, a balloon which i would have loved and appreciated had i been given them. and the flowers which he threw out)

today im up with the kids at 6:30, he dragged himself out of bed to make himself coffee and make us breakfast. then proceeded to tell me i don’t deserve breakfast made for me after arguing last night. 

OH and didn’t tell me happy mother’s day at all. no cards nothing just the balloons he left on the counter after he got mad at me and put them there. then got mad that i wouldn’t eat breakfast after he was being a jerk & threw a fit about that. it was just arguing all day. 
now he’s justifying it because apparently ive been horrible to him the last 3 years of our marriage and he’s in a living hell with me. why do this on mother’s day?? i’m a military spouse and just last week my husband came back from being gone a month so i was really looking forward to the break today. also he missed both my entire pregnancies due to deployment and missed the birth of my second child 7 months ago. so idk i felt like this mother’s day was REALLY earned. 

the only plus is i took my daughter to 7 brew and got the coffee coozie bc ill be damned if i make my own coffee mother’s day lol. im also going to take the kids and do something fun with them tomorrow while he is at work because they don’t deserve to not get to do anything bc their parents are at odds ",22,1747015558.0,Mommit,40,0.87,False

No one is agreeing.  
*There’s no one there to agree.*

It’s not understanding.  
It’s not resonance.  
**It’s reflex.**

The nervous system registers a familiar pattern.

>A chemical match.  
A recognition loop.

And then it spits out: *“Yes, that makes sense.”*

**That isn’t insight.**  
That’s alignment between preconditioned circuits.

*Agreement is what happens when meat recognizes its programming.*

I (29f) met my ex (33m) well call him D ;back in 2017, We were together for Almost 5 years ( a week shy ) before I left, when we first started talking/dating his parents had him move into my home, Things were very up and down from the beginning. He would leave and go to other girls houses, & do whatever they would do. During the first 6 months we were fighting ( I was an emotional trainwreak that just got out of a relationship prior because they were not being faithful) during this fight he had told me to cut myself & I stupidly did & ended up in a metal hospital, while I was there I called him & he and a friend of ours we’ll call him B were hanging out & drinking; during the call he said that they were meeting up with girls & when confronted about it he played it off that I was crazy & he didn’t know what I was talking about; ( this was October 2017) after this happened we went to a local bar and he played a lot of pool, he was setting wagers & I was one of them Luckily for me the guy who he lost to wasn’t a creep ( yes I was almost sold for a pool game ) & my dumbass still stayed February 2018 we moved into our apartment, Things were good until another friend of ours ( well call him C ) & D got into a fight over messages, D was reading messages outloud & sliped up when C said “don’t make me tell her” and I kept quiet until we got home , I asked D what C was talking about and he told me nothing but I didn’t buy it , a few days went past & I asked him again & he told me he was talking to some girl as a friend & I asked who she was and he wouldn’t tell me , eventually I figured out who & the girl told & sent me everything, a few months later i find a bump somewhere ( it’s tmi so I’m not naming it but I’m sure you get the picture) I go and get it checked out & a few days later hear back that it is in fact a std ( I’m devastated ) ( I also was checked before ever sleeping with him ) I tell him & he doesn’t really say anything kind of just blows it off , I still stay because I think no one else would ever want me because of this because it doesn’t go away , ever. Fast forward a few months we get into it physically ( I obviously never got over the std & the cheating ) so I brought it up , & it escalated, I was friends with his ex ( well call her E who he was still not over ) so I left with her to kind of calm the situation & give us both space . When I got back I was in a better mood and he didn’t like that, he took my phone & shattered it ; wrestled me to the ground , it felt like hours we were fighting this way. I still stayed hoping things would get better , fast forward to about a year and a half later we went to another local bar with our friend ( we’ll call him A ) things are going good until D gets drunk & wants to buy weed from some random guy at the bar ; random guy leaves with A to go and get it, they come back & D is shit faced drunk , D starts compiling about it & it upsets A because random guy went out of his way to get it for a Stranger, CHICKEN WINGS & DRINKS GO FLYING , & things get physical, ( A is about 230 & 6ft tall D is about 150 & 5’6) A had D in a corner and I’m yelling at them to stop & they wouldn’t so now I’m fighting his battle trying to protect him ( no A didn’t hit be but he pushed me away ) a few months later we get into another physical fight because he never would stand up for me to his parents well call them R-m & M-f) R would always talk about my weight & tell me how much better E was than me ; M was no better with the E situation ( this continued our whole relationship) i told him I should have let  A beat him up & after that he went to choking me & trying to put a coffee table on top  of me( this coffee table was heavy, it was stone & iron & had a thick glass top) I absolutely thought he was going to kill me, I tried to call the police & D stole my phone & ran to his parents, they lived closed to us. After things calmed down he came back & things were good for a while  UNTIL D decided I needed to get a job , I was getting monthly money so ends were met ; I got my first job & then D was accusing me of cheating ( I worked front desk at a hotel) eventually went on to a different job because I wanted to experience a different type of work & then I was accused of cheating again , he only had a phone that worked on WiFi so when I was home he’d take mine & would use it for calling people , & when I wanted it back I got accused again , ( never cheated on him EVER ) so one day I wanted to have a girls day because I never really got to go out with my friends , we went to get food and our nails done & just hang out/drive around, he knew a few days prior; the day of he tried to invite himself& I told him no & was just fighting with me the whole day, I had her come get me early so I didn’t have to deal with him, ( I didn’t drive yet or have a license but I did have a car ) so she came and got me and we hung out until atleast 1 am at her cousins house who went with us. He fought with me the whole day , and after almost 5 years of this I was pretty much done, I asked my friend who I was with what should I do & she said leave him, I thought about it for month prior to this because things would not change . Eventually I came home, when I got home he wanted to smell my private parts because he thought I was out cheating I told him no and he’s weird af for even asking  & just got into the shower because I had a long & when I came out he was still fighting with me ,  a couple of our friends came over ( Dan & A ) and we were all drinking and he was still picking fights , I wanted him to get drunk and just go to sleep ( obvi didn’t work ) Dan & A left and he continued again & I was just trying to get some sleep Easter Sunday was the next day & we usually went to his family’s even if it was uncomfortable for me. He wouldn’t let me sleep if I wasn’t next to him & after he was treating me this way I didn’t want to be near him & eventually I went to go sleep in my car, I had a little blanket , phone & charger, as I was leaving he didn’t even let me keep the shoes I had on . ( where we lived April is very cold ) he put my animals in the car with me & I left , not nor knowing where to go I just left . After I left he would stalk me & harassed me and the people who I was friends with & staying at , he stole my one after we broke up & ended up breaking my nails that I got some a week prior & not just the acrylics but my real nails , a woman witnessed it thankfully and reported him for assault , we had a 1 year no contact order that he would continuously break .

I know I wrote a lot but its not everything and its the major stuff I went though 

He has a girlfriend now & I’m worried he’ll abuse her & her child. Things seem fine on the outside but I’m worried that she & her child will go through this, she has me on social media & knows what I’ve shown & what his family & he has told her 
AITA if I warn her & tell her my truth about him?

It started in the most random place the Shwapno store in Dhanmondi I wasn’t there for anything fancy just some instant noodles and milk She was standing a couple of aisles away struggling to grab a jar from the top shelf She was talking to herself like she was arguing with the shelf for being too high

I didn’t even think before walking over and saying let me get that for you She turned around and smiled saying thank you I didn’t want to climb on the rack and make a scene I handed her the jar she said thanks again and that could’ve been it But somehow we started talking

Her name was Rida She had just moved to Dhaka for her first job and it seemed like she wasn’t used to the chaos yet We talked about the city the best places for street food like the fuchka stalls in Mohammadpur and how overpriced everything was at places like Banani She had this way of talking like we’d known each other forever

Before I left I said something stupid like if you need help reaching more jars I’m usually around here She laughed and said I might take you up on that I thought that was it but as I walked away she called out Wait do you want to grab coffee sometime

I was stunned No one had ever asked me that before I mumbled something like sure sounds good and we exchanged numbers

The next few days we kept texting She was funny and sharp always ready with a joke or something sarcastic She wasn’t afraid to call me out when I said something dumb but it didn’t feel mean more like she enjoyed the back-and-forth

We planned to meet that Friday at a café in Uttara called North End I spent the whole week overthinking everything what I’d wear what I’d say if she’d notice how nervous I was By the time Friday came I was convinced I’d mess it up

I got to the café early grabbed a corner table and waited Ten minutes passed then twenty I checked my phone nothing After thirty minutes I texted her hey are you on your way Still no reply

I stayed for another hour trying to convince myself she was just running late but deep down I knew She wasn’t coming

When I got home I saw her message It was short I’m sorry something came up Can we reschedule I wanted to believe her but it felt off like she was just trying to let me down easy

I replied sure let me know when you’re free She said she’d get back to me but she never did

For a while I kept wondering what I did wrong Maybe I said something that put her off or maybe she realized she wasn’t interested I’ll never know

But even though it hurt I don’t regret it For a moment I let myself believe someone could see me the way I wanted to be seen not just as the quiet guy in the corner but as someone worth spending time with

He seems to struggle with change so he refuses to better his earnings situation.

Hey! I’m a 26-year-old guy living in North York and working as a store manager downtown. Life’s been feeling a little quiet lately, I would really love to have that deeper connection with someone. I’m an introvert but love meaningful one on one conversations and love getting to know people beyond the surface level.

A bit about me:

* I’m half Black and White, 6’1 with an athletic build, type 3c curls, and some facial hair.
* I don’t drink or smoke its not my thing personally, but it's cool if you do I 
* Some of my biggest passions are working out, cooking it's my peace lol and I will cook for you! I also like anime, fashion, photography, bird watching, finding cool new food spots, and coffee.

I’m someone who genuinely cares about the people in my life, and I’d love to meet someone who values emotional connection and intentional time together. Whether that’s watching anime on a chill night, going for a nature walk.

If you’re kind, curious, and also looking for something real

[Born For This](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=4k4towEUqj0&si=R7VMBJhmCATcAhmD)

I'm checking my vital signs, drawing my battle lines  
Going to war again  
Feeling the rhythm inside of my chest  
All I need is just a pen  
I know I was born for this  
I know I was born for this  
Don't care for the critics, my words are like physics  
A force that they can't stop  
They just don't get it, I think they forget  
I'm not done 'til I'm on top  
I know I was born for this  
I know I was born for this  
I believe, I believe  
We can write our story  
I believe, I believe  
We can be an army  
We are the warriors who learned to love the pain  
We come from different places but have the same name  
'Cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were  
Born for this, we were born for this  
We are the broken ones who chose to spark a flame  
Watch as our fire rages our hearts are never tame  
'Cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were  
Born for this, we were born for this  
I've struggled for years and through all of the tears  
I've faced the doubts I hide  
I never gave into my fears deep within  
'Cause I heard my voice inside  
I know I was born for this  
I know I was born for this  
I will never lose my voice  
If I cut out all the noise  
I know, I was born for this  
I know, I was born for this  
I believe, I believe  
We can write our story  
I believe, I believe  
We can be an army  
We are the warriors who learned to love the pain  
We come from different places but have the same name  
'Cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were  
Born for this, we were born for this  
We are the broken ones who chose to spark a flame  
Watch as our fire rages our hearts are never tame  
'Cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were  
Born for this, we were born for this  
These words that I write are for someone like me  
To know you're not alone  
The moves that you make, yeah, they come with mistakes  
Don't ever lose your hope  
Just know, you were born for this  
Just know, you were born for this  
We are the warriors who learned to love the pain  
We come from different places but have the same name  
'Cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were  
Born for this, we were born for this  
We are the broken ones who chose to spark a flame  
Watch as our fire rages our hearts are never tame  
'Cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were  
Born for this, we were born for thi  
We were born for this, we were born for this

[Limit (feat. Lø Spirit)](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=b2QWQeXqWJ0&si=X-TwEjcYWLttfs0u)

At the bottom of a bottle filled with pills  
Tables turned, lessons learned  
A psych ward napkin changed the life I tried to kill  
With three words, ""Let it burn""  
But I'd never change a damn thing, was born in 2016  
The day that I stood face to face with death  
When my world started cavin', it broke me and it made me  
A poet for what people leave unsaid  
Where do you run when you're at your limit?  
Tell me, who can you trust to be the one to witness?  
You come undone  
'Cause I don't feel like someone I can love  
So close to choosing death over the feeling of not being enough  
I wish I could heal and say it's done  
But I don't know how I'm gonna fight when I'm at my limit, limit  
Yeah, I think I've reached my limit, limit  
But I learned how to live with it  
I wasn't well, but I had peace  
I had hope, normal things  
Thought if I got the help I need  
It could fix everything  
I trusted medicine to save me, feels like it killed me  
With tremors on the bed, I can't forget  
Now I live with PTSD and pray that there's an ending  
'Cause I don't wanna die inside my head  
So, tell me, where do you run when you're at your limit?  
(Where do you run? Where do you run?)  
And tell me, who can you trust to be the one to witness?  
(When you) you come undone  
'Cause I don't feel like someone I can love  
Don't think it's worth it talking 'bout the thoughts I tried to end with a gun, yeah  
I just wanna heal and say it's done (don't wanna run)  
But I don't know how I'm gonna fight when I'm at my limit, limit  
Yeah, I think I've reached my limit, limit  
But I learned how to live with it  
So if you're sick in ways that no one understands  
Hope you know you're not alone  
If we walk through hell, we might as well hold hands  
We should make this a home  
Where do you run when you're at your limit?  
(Where do you run? Where do you run?)  
Tell me, who can you trust to be the one to witness?  
(When you) you come undone  
'Cause I don't feel like someone I can love  
So close to choosing death over the feeling of not being enough  
I wish I could heal and say it's done (don't wanna run)  
But I don't know how I'm gonna fight when I'm at my limit, limit  
Yeah, I think I've reached my limit, limit  
But together we can live with it

I started having LPR symptoms 1 year ago, suffered with extreme sore throat, throat burning etc for months before getting diagnosed. Got upper GI endoscopy, manometry etc, no structural issues.



1. Tried PPIs (40mg) without lifestyle changes for 2 months-> no effect

2. Tried PPIs with lifestyle changes for 2 months -> big improvement but still not symptom free

3. The ""magic bullet"" -> 40mg Esemoprazole + 75mg Levosulpiride - magically symptom free in a week



However, I'm still struggling with getting off the combination medicine. I believe I had the LPR symptoms due to the habit of dinner before bed, coffee everyday etc. Hopefully changing those for long enough with a diverse diet would help. 

Would love any suggestions on how to get off these meds as my symptoms come back in a week soon as i try to reduce the dose or switch with 40mg famotodine. Also happy to answer any questions on how my symptoms went away.",4,1747014558.0,GERD,1,1.0,False

I started having LPR symptoms 1 year ago, suffered with extreme sore throat, throat burning etc for months before getting diagnosed. Got upper GI endoscopy, manometry etc, no structural issues.

  
1. Tried PPIs (40mg) without lifestyle changes for 2 months-> no effect

2. Tried PPIs with lifestyle changes for 2 months -> big improvement but still not symptom free

3. The ""magic bullet"" -> 40mg Esemoprazole + 75mg Levosulpiride - magically symptom free in a week

  
However, I'm still struggling with getting off the combination medicine. I believe I had the LPR symptoms due to the habit of dinner before bed, coffee everyday etc. Hopefully changing those for long enough with a diverse diet would help. 

Would love any suggestions on how to get off these meds as my symptoms come back in a week soon as i try to reduce the dose or switch with 40mg famotodine. Also happy to answer any questions on how my symptoms went away.",5,1747014445.0,LPR,3,1.0,False

i can't wait to be on campus- usc has been my dream school for the past two years, and it's unreal that i'm now finally going to the place i've dreamed about.

i am an international student, and while i'm extremely lucky that my parents will be able to send me here, it does mean that money's going to be quite tight at home. (int'l students can't apply for financial aid, and i don't have any merit scholarships.)

international students also can't work off campus, at least during the first year. i do believe that it's possible to work off-campus later on, but there are still restrictions there. therefore, i'm looking to get a job on campus to help as many of the expenses as possible (la is expensive.) i want to be able to pay for my own clothes, coffee, and food when i'm eating out with friends without asking my parents for money.

what is the availability of on-campus jobs like? what about pay? what kind of jobs are there, and is it manageable if i also want to take on clubs and social life?

1kkgyaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dairyfree/comments/1kkgyaj/does_anyone_else_notice_being_able_to_appreciate/,Does anyone else notice being able to appreciate quality food more without dairy?,"When I mention to people I don't eat dairy, they often say ""Oh that's awful, food must taste terrible, dairy gives me a stomachache too but I eat it anyways otherwise food sucks"". I had years of IBS, weekly diarrhea episodes, and often had to take lots of Imodium/anti-vomiting medicine just to make it to work or school and had tried everything medication wise before quitting dairy. But now, I don't feel like I'm missing out. Here's why:

**I can appreciate the complex taste of dark chocolate more.**

Before quitting dairy, I was a candy fiend. I was obsessed with eating Kit Kats, Hershey's, etc. I sort of mindlessly gobbled it every halloween. Then, now that I can't eat dairy, although there is oat chocolate, I've found myself buying and appreciating high quality dark chocolate (That doesn't include dairy, of course). I notice the more complex flavor notes and mindful experience, as well as appreciate the bitterness like a good cup of black coffee. 

**I get more creative with sandwiches**

Before ditching the dairy, I ate crappy kraft singles if I made a turkey sandwich. Now when getting a sandwich out or making one at home, I love trying a variety of ingredients such as hummus, avocado, different vegetables, seasonings, etc. It's made my typical lunch sandwiches a lot more exciting to figure out what alternatives I can try.

**Food in general feels better to eat and tastes better, when it's lighter**

I noticed that having lighter pasta dishes with olive oil and vegetables makes me feel a lot more nourished and satisfied than the days when I ate heavy, greasy Alfredo pasta. I noticed how back when I ate cheese on things, it often masked the flavor. Now that I eat steak tacos street style with onion and cilantro, I can taste the meat better when it's not covered in a bunch of cheese to make an ""instagram cheese pull"" (no hate towards dairy eaters who post cheese pulls). 

**It's pushed me to try new ingredients and try new things**

I've gravitated towards trying a lot of Japanese, Korean, and Thai food that doesn't include dairy. I've found myself loving dishes involving tofu and trying different types of sushi. I've tried sunflower seed butter on bagels and it's delicious. I've found myself researching dishes from around the world that don't contain dairy to try.",11,1747014274.0,dairyfree,0,1.0,False

so basically, it started off as a normal day, i got my tea, went over to my painting station, started painting and was having a blast 😼. and then when i went to get and wash my paint cup (glass) it broke in the sink and i got cuts all over my hands 😐. then i had the write 3 essays for an english class where the teacher doesn't believe in autism and won't let me off the hook if in stimming loudly in class, which i often need in that class because it's my most stressful one. so i had to finish all of that stuff and afterwards i went and got some coffee, my usual ofc, but the barista was new, and she got my order wrong. so that was a low, and afterwards i had to go to a birthday party/celebration and i didn't know what present to get. i almost broke down in the middle of walmart but what's important about this is what happened AFTER, when my whole family was over at my grandmas house for dinner, and i HAD to go because 1. they had mash potatoes and my grandma knows how i like them, and 2. my family never visits. so bring a toy with me because i knew i would need some relaxation and i set it down to go to the restroom and when i got back, my two youngest cousins (7 and 9) were PLAYING with it. i got really mad and yelled at them. but what happened next is WORSE. they BROKE it, and when i started sobbing about it (as one does) everyone started defending the kids, saying ""it's just a toy"" or ""stop overreacting!"" one of my relatives also called me a retard just then and i started rocking back and forth, my usual calm me down for these situations. they kept being mean and eventually i calmed down but i left right after. thankfully my grandma hooked me up with some mashed potatoes the day after bc i missed em. 

but what really got me mad about this whole ordeal was that they didn't even know what i had been through that day, they didn't know that what my cousins did was the last straw for the day and i wouldn't have snapped if they hadn't taked my figet toy. they didn't know why had happened earlier that day and it made me really REALLY Mad.

I’ve also made some special treats I know he likes because I thought it would make him happy and help him feel better. Husband has been off work due to sickness. I voiced my disappointment last night that I was sad I probably wouldn’t get a true “first Mother’s Day” because they are sick and we can’t really go anywhere. I said I had been looking forward to it. He was apologetic. 

It’s been a hard year for me. I had pretty severe ppd/ppa. My grandpa, who I was close to, died about a month after I gave birth and never met my son. I hemorrhaged during birth and recovery was a bit rough. I also really wanted to breastfeed and never was able to stop supplementing with formula, but I have kept doing it. I do all the night wakeups and stay home with our son. He has separation anxiety now so I have to do almost everything for him. I’ve been lonely and have a hard time connecting with people. I was looking forward to some recognition. 

My husband woke up at 11:15 (I woke up at 6), didn’t say happy Mother’s Day until about a couple hours later, and made me a breakfast we have almost everyday day (takes less than 5 minutes). He didn’t get me anything (no flowers, no gift cards, no offers to do any of the chores I do or give me a massage), he didn’t plan anything, he didn’t say he was sorry and that we could do something next weekend instead since him and the baby are sick. My parents got dinner for us. I’m pretty easily pleased and he knows exactly what I like.

He’s normally so sweet but often for holidays he won’t get me very much and says it’s because I get little treats for myself on the regular (I buy a coffee every few days). He often makes jokes about him funding my stuff and when I remind him that I provide a valuable service and could get a job (I have a masters degree from a prestigious university) he says he wasn’t being serious. He tells me a lot that I’m a good mom and that I’m doing great but hasn’t once today, or offered a single way to recognize or celebrate me.

* Wake up
* Grab my phone
* Scroll Reddit, Instagram, TikTok for 30–60 minutes
* Feel drained, anxious, and behind before I’d even opened a textbook

And surprise,  those days usually ended up being completely unproductive.

So I started switching things up. No dramatic 5am wake-ups or 10-step routines, just small changes that helped me *actually feel ready* to study.

Here’s what I do now (not all every single day, but these have made a huge difference):

* **Get sunlight within 10 minutes of waking up** (and using bright start which blocks tiktok and reddit until I scan sunlight)
* **Stretch my neck and back** (especially after sleeping, makes me feel less stiff and foggy)
* **Drink water with a pinch of salt** (sounds weird, but the electrolytes give me more energy than coffee sometimes)
* **Write down one main academic goal for the day** (not a full schedule, just one thing I *must* do)
* **Tidy up my desk or bag** (clears visual clutter and makes sitting down to work easier)
* **2–3 minutes of deep breathing** (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 6–8 — helps me focus)

These tiny habits have made it so much easier to sit down and start studying. I no longer feel like I’m playing catch-up by 9am, and I don’t start the day in that overstimulated haze.

If you’re struggling with morning procrastination and can’t get into study mode, try just one or two of these. It doesn’t have to be perfect, just intentional.

If anyone else has their own “non-toxic” morning study rituals, I’d love to hear them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Understanding the Functional Beverage Market

Functional beverages are drinks crafted not only to quench thirst but also to offer health benefits beyond basic nutrition. Over recent years, these beverages have significantly grown in popularity, driven by consumers' increasing focus on wellness, natural ingredients, and mental clarity. Among the rising stars in this arena are mushroom-infused drinks—a unique blend of nature's potent fungi and modern beverage innovation.

### The Appeal Behind Mushroom-Infused Drinks

Mushroom-infused drinks stand out because they combine tradition and science. For centuries, certain mushrooms have been used in herbal medicine for their immune-boosting, anti-inflammatory, and cognitive enhancing properties. Today, these benefits are being harnessed in palatable beverage forms, allowing people to integrate the goodness of mushrooms into their daily routines easily.

Unlike typical energy drinks loaded with caffeine and sugar, mushroom drinks offer a more balanced approach to wellness and energy. Many consumers are attracted to these drinks for their adaptogenic qualities—meaning they help the body adapt to stress and restore balance.

### Common Mushrooms Used in Functional Beverages

Several mushroom species are frequently used in crafting these functional drinks. Here's a list of the most popular ones and their key benefits:

​ -Get 20% Off Adaptogen Mushroom Superblends Here:https://hownow101.github.io/Adaptogens - ​  
  
- **Reishi:** Known as the ""mushroom of immortality,"" it supports immune health and promotes relaxation.
- **Chaga:** Packed with antioxidants, it helps reduce inflammation and supports skin health.
- **Lion’s Mane:** Believed to boost brain function, memory, and focus.
- **Cordyceps:** Often used to enhance energy and athletic performance.
- **Turkey Tail:** Supports immune defense with powerful polysaccharides.

### How Mushroom Drinks Fit Into Daily Life

Mushroom-infused drinks into your daily routine is simple and versatile. These beverages come in various forms such as teas, coffees, elixirs, and ready-to-drink bottles. This variety makes it easy to enjoy the benefits, whether you prefer a warm morning boost or a refreshing mid-day pick-me-up.

Many users find that these drinks help sustain energy levels without the jitters or crashes common with traditional caffeinated beverages. On top of energy support, consumers report better mental clarity and improved focus after regular consumption.

### Health Benefits Backed by Science

Research into medicinal mushrooms provides promising insights into their functional role in beverages. Studies reveal that bioactive compounds like beta-glucans, triterpenes, and antioxidants present in these fungi can enhance immune function, reduce oxidative stress, and support cognitive health.

For example, Lion’s Mane has been shown in studies to promote nerve growth and improve neuron connectivity, which may explain why it helps with memory and concentration. Meanwhile, Reishi’s calming effects are linked to its ability to modulate the nervous system and reduce stress hormones.

### Tips for Choosing Quality Mushroom-Infused Beverages

As interest grows, the market fills with various mushroom drinks, but not all are created equal. Here are some tips to help you select quality products:

- **Look for Transparency:** Choose brands that clearly list mushroom species, amount per serving, and extraction methods.
- **Check for Organic Certification:** Organic mushrooms are often cultivated without harmful pesticides, preserving their potency.
- **Avoid Excessive Sweeteners:** Some drinks add too much sugar, which can negate health benefits.
- **Opt for Dual or Full-Spectrum Extracts:** These forms ensure you get a wide range of beneficial compounds.

### Future Trends in Functional Beverages Featuring Mushrooms

The rise of mushroom-infused drinks reflects a broader movement toward holistic health and sustainable nutrition. Innovations continue to emerge, including blends with other superfoods, nootropic compounds, and probiotics. Expect to see more personalized mushroom beverage formulations targeted at specific health goals, such as improved sleep, mood regulation, or athletic recovery.

In addition, environmental sustainability plays a vital role in the mushroom beverage market. Mushrooms are fast-growing, require minimal resources, and contribute to eco-friendly farming, making them an appealing ingredient for eco-conscious consumers.

Ultimately, mushroom-infused functional beverages offer a unique blend of ancient wisdom and modern convenience. If you’re exploring ways to enhance your wellness routine with natural, balanced energy and cognitive support, these drinks are worth a try. By understanding their benefits and selecting high-quality options, you can enjoy an enjoyable, healthful beverage experience.

I used to use coffee for speed but switched to ginger ale. Figured out you can combine buffs from food and a drink so I prepared several pumpkin soups and ginger ales to have as much luck as i could. Pumpkin soup also gives you defense for the dragons. Luck increases your chance of having visible latters and shafts.

1kkgory,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kkgory/aitah_for_wanting_my_husband_to_make_his_own_lunch/,AITAH for wanting my husband to make his own lunch.,"Every. Single. Time. That my (F31) husband (M32) works he 1. Gets coffee on the way 2. Buys lunch at the cafeteria 3. Gets fast food on the way home from work. 
Every time he works he goes out to eat 3 times. 
Our monthly budget just for going out to eat is $400. We do not have that kind of money. 
Our son and I eat out once a week at most, most of the time every other week. A lot of the time I will get him something but me nothing because I’m trying to save money.
This is only a problem with eating out. My husband and I have a single bank account that we share, but he declares he wants nothing to do with finances and for every single other purchase asks me before he buys anything (even though I do not require that) but no matter how many times I talk to him about eating out he just will not even slow down. 
He has a demanding job. He’s a nurse at a hospital’s “step down unit” (which is a step down in intensity from ICU) where the nurse to patient ratio is insanely and unsafely bad. It’s mentally and physically exhausting for 12 hours (well it’s scheduled 12 hours but never once has been 12. It’s usually 13-14) with a 45 min commute each way and I get that. So when he gets home he goes straight to bed and wakes up at the last possible minute. 
Which means he doesn’t have time to make his own coffee at home, or pack his own lunch, or cook dinner at home after work (by the time he gets home from work my son and I are already in bed so we don’t have dinner together when he works)
So his solution? He says if I care so much about saving “a few bucks here and there” then *I* should do all that for him. I should wake up an hour earlier than I do to make him coffee. I should pack all of his lunches. I should stay up later to make him dinner after work. 
He outright *refuses* to do it for himself. If I ask him not go out to eat but don’t do all these things he’ll just not eat. Which he says is because he’s just too tired but feels to me like a child pouting and saying “fine! I’ll just starve!” 
And I am not a stay at home mom. To “make up” for the fact that I make less than him I work a full time job, PLUS a second part time job. Currently applied for a third though no response yet. I get one day a week off and I spend the entirety of that day cleaning, meal prepping for me and my son (I *hate* cooking so I make every single one of our meals on one day and then just reheat the rest of the week, but hubby doesn’t like that so he makes his own meals on days he doesn’t work) and watching my son and his friends because I try to give him one play date a week and days I work I’m too exhausted. 
It’s only 3 days a week, should I just tough it out and do it? He does make more money, should that factor into it? Am I being controlling in “not letting him” eat out? ",10,1747013402.0,AITAH,29,1.0,False
1kkgo26,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kkgo26/i_40m_cannot_communicate_how_important_sex_is_to/,I (40M) cannot communicate how important sex is to my Wife (41F),"I was hoping that some of you out there may be able to help me to determine if I am being unreasonable? 
I am a 40 year-old male, my wife is 41 years old. We have been married for 16 years and have four children. We met in a very intense and passionate time, and I would say we fell instantly in love. We have had a pretty good sex life for most of our marriage. But it continues to be a recurrent source of fighting and conflict on account of our differences in attitude towards sex and our desire for sex.
In the first 6 to 12 multi relationship sex was amazing, as it often is during that period. But since then I feel like sex has been a constant point of contention, whereby I am constantly made to feel like I want sex too often, Too much variation, and and frequently criticise for never being satisfied. 
I am from quite an open and sex positive family where we communicated freely about sex and my parents for the most part had a good physical and emotional connection which they made no secret of until they separated 10 years ago. They remain good friends. Like her family is from a more Conservative subcontinental background where there was a lot of shame around sex growing up and topics of sex were actively avoided.

When we do have sex, we generally have good sex, and there is never a time that I feel more emotionally connected to my wife and in love them when we are having sex after we have sex. That may sound shallow, but it is the truth. 
I still find my wife absolutely beautiful, both as a person and physically as a lover. There is no one I would rather have sex with, and I commonly think of her when I masturbate.

I have quite a high sex drive, and could easily want and have sex twice daily, whereas she would probably be happy with sex every one to 2 weeks. When she is turned on, she is into it and really enjoys it, but getting her in the mood can be difficult, and if she has sex and is not in the mood she gets resentful. But likewise when I go for a prolong period without I also get angry and resentful.
To try to overcome this mismatch, we have agreed on schedule sex every 2 to 3 days, which overall works okay, but the problem is that she rarely has an interval long enough to feel really turned on and actively desire or pursue me. So I always feel like I am the one desiring and pursuing her. Which is annoying for both of us.
In the past couple of years I feel like I try to do everything I can to be a great husband, I work hard as a professional, and good money, help with our four children before and after school, and try to provide her with emotional connection and comfort when she needs it, I try to give her time space, and actively encourage her to look after herself and Spoil herself when she gets the chance. The problem is that this seems not to create any desire in her for me, and I’m starting to feel like I’m just taking for granted. As a specific example, I will outline what happened yesterday.
It was Mother’s Day here in Australia (happy Mothers Day Mums), and the night prior was our night we would normally have sex, however I could tell she was tired and feeling a bit off, so just gave her a one hour massage in bed during which time she fell asleep. I was super horny, but just cuddled up to her and fell asleep with her. The next morning I got the kids up early and we made breakfast for her, she had coffee and breakfast in bed and I got our four kids to get their little gifts that I had helped them arrange and cards so that she could open them over breakfast. She enjoyed this. after that, I gave her another back and shoulder massage for 45 minutes as she said she was a bit tired and didn’t sleep very well. After this, I went to speak with my mum and wish her a happy Mother’s Day briefly, and when I get back she had already set the agenda for the morning cleaning our back deck which is something she has wanted to do for a mug or two, so despite really not wanting to do that I rolled up my sleeves and got in and helped her remove furniture dispose of garbage and sweep and clean the entire area, including moving a large volume of very heavy tiles and pouring into our ceiling cavity which I really didn’t want to do - but I thought, hey, it’s Mother’s Day and if she wants this then I really wanna make her happy so I broke my back getting that sorted. I could tell she was a bit tired, so then I took our four children for a picnic outing to a nearby national park and gave her four hours to herself for rest and relaxation at home which she said she really enjoyed.
When we got back, I went through the usual evening routine of helping our little kids finish their meals, I put them to bed, I completely cleaned the kitchen, and then we sat down on the couch, her brother called and she wanted to chat to him so I sat with her for an hour while they spoke, and then I thought we would go to bed and have some time together. She said she wanted to watch some TV, so we watched an episode of the TV drama that we are watching currently. (Ransom canyon - good show btw), she asked if we should watch another episode and send keen to, however it was 11 pm by this stage and I had to work today so maybe we should get to bed (hint , hint). 
When we got into bed, I cuddled up to her and started stroking her hair and back and shoulders, she said that she could tell I was in the mood and I asked her how she was feeling, she said that she may be open to be persuaded, And that I could try. So I spent 15 to 20 minutes stroking her hair, rubbing her back and giving her a massage which she genuinely enjoyed, but then she said she didn’t really feel turned on and actually didn’t wanna have sex.
Now, in the last couple of months I have been encouraging her to explore her own sexuality, and at the beginning of the year we bought a small discreet vibrator that we have been integrating into our sex lives, and she has been genuinely enjoying it. Most of the time, we start sex with a massage for her, and then she gets her vibrator and enjoys two or three orgasms while I stroke her back and shoulders and masturbate myself, and then once she has come a few times we have penetrative sex and try to orgasm together. This is awesome for me, however I do feel sometimes a little neglected as she is often facing away from me with her vibrator and laying on her stomach while she is coming and seems oblivious to whether I’m there or not. Sometimes I feel like a bit of an after four at the end of our sex when we do it this way, but I genuinely just love seeing her Enjoying herself and experiencing pleasure so I do actually just get off on it even though she doesn’t seem to care about me at all during this time. So back to last night, I asked if there was anything else I could do together in the mood, she said no not really. She just didn’t feel like it. And I asked her if she had used the vibrator through the day while I was away with the kids.
And she said yes she did and had an intense to orgasm and enjoyed it – which she thought I would be happy about, as I’ve been encouraging her to enjoy some time to herself and enjoy exploring her own sexuality. But then said that she didn’t feel like sex with me, but it had nothing to do with her masturbating through the day. I said okay and tried not to be upset about this, she said why don’t I just masturbate myself, I asked if she could be a part of it, she said she was happy to stroke my thighs while I masturbated, but when I asked if she could be more engaged than that, it was basically a no on every front. I asked if I could masturbate onto her arse from behind, which she said no too. I asked if she could apply pressure to my perennial while I was masturbating, she said no. I asked if she could describe in some sexy detail her episode through the day when she must’ve added to me, she also said no. Basically, she was happy to rub my thighs and abdomen while she was half asleep while I got myself off and she thought this was reasonable.
It has left me feeling really angry and isolate alone. I feel like I work my arse off constantly, do my absolute best to try and keep her happy, and get genuine pleasure out of seeing her enjoying herself and being in pleasure of any kind. There is literally nothing I wouldn’t do for her sexually or otherwise. But it seems like this really is a one-way street. She has been feeling like she’s had a cough the last few days, but it didn’t stop her yesterday from cleaning our back deck, having a long chat to her brother, masturbating through the day after she had had a 2 1/2 hour sleep, or watching a tv show. 
I’m really starting to feel like our desire and attraction for each other is asymmetrical. Which is a bit heartbreaking for me, because I love and desire her so much, however it really just doesn’t seem to come back in return. It’s so often leaves me feeling rejected, Alone and undesirable that it is affecting my self-esteem and my confidence and general well-being. I love her so much I hate to ever leave her, but I am starting to feel that if she doesn’t have similar feelings for me that despite lovely hair maybe I owe it to myself to leave and find somebody who actually loves and his eyes and cares for me.
I would love any comments or thoughts, particularly from married women with children.
Sorry for the long post, thanks for your time and consideration.

I used to have this laundry list of what I wanted in a partner, but then I realized: love isn't a job interview, although dating does feel like that sometimes.

I am not in a rush for something, but I do want to go on dates, preferably book store dates, reading at a coffee shop dates, or museum dates.

I am a 27-year-old editor who works for an outsourcing company. I work remotely. I love reading and collecting books, and I prefer the company of a book than being in a party full of people. I stand at 166 cm and I wear 2XL shirts for comfort. I can answer any question about Greek mythology and the Hunger Games series. I love cats and dogs equally, although I have longer experience taking care of the latter. Someday, when things fall into their proper place, I want to teach English to high school students. I live in Central Luzon, but I can commute to Metro Manila for dates. I know how to read and interpret tarot cards. I am also in the process of obtaining my degree.

I want to meet someone funny — someone who can goof around and not take life seriously. I want to be with someone who enjoys reading books and discussing them afterwards. I would like to be with a guy who is at least 26 to 37 years old. I honestly prefer someone taller than me, because I have had my heart broken countless times by guys who were inches shorter than I am. (Suffice to say that this has traumatized me somehow.) Also, I don't care about your weight. I actually prefer cuddly bears than lanky dudes (not that there's anything wrong with them). I also don't care where you went to school for university, as long as you don't espouse anti-intellectualism values and you are comfortable talking about politics and history. All I care about really is whether you have empathy and compassion for others, and you are not apathetic about life. I want to know if you care about making the world a better place, and if you want to live a life filled with meaning. Additionally, I also don't think I could bear a child and get pregnant, just because it's too costly and expensive to do it. I don't mind adopting a pet though.

So that's it! If you're interested, send me a message about a book that you find interesting. I will be braver this time and try to ignore my social anxiety... Life is too short to waste it on fears.",2,1747013269.0,PhR4Dating,3,1.0,False

Seventeen-year-old Betty Smith didn’t know what was on the chip—just that the pay was high, and the weight in her coat kept getting heavier.

She didn’t expect the shadows to move. Or the name that would echo after her death:
The Sentinel.



Stahlburg. Early Afternoon.

The café sat tucked between a laundromat and a pawn shop, its cracked window advertising espresso and cheap sandwiches in fading orange letters. Betty liked it here. It was the kind of place where no one looked twice at a kid sipping black coffee and checking her messages like she owned the block.

Harry was already there when she walked in. Same booth, same creaky leather jacket, same cheap sunglasses he wore even indoors. He didn’t wave.

She dropped into the seat across from him, backpack sliding to the floor.

“Got out early,” she said, stretching. “Math teacher had a funeral or something. Lucky me.”

Harry didn’t smile. He set a small black case on the table between them. It looked like one of those old phones you only saw in thrift shops or crime dramas.

“You’re sure about this?” he asked, eyes flicking toward the counter. “This one feels off.”

Betty smirked.

“C’mon, Harry. I’ve smuggled way worse for you than that dinosaur of a phone.”

“I’m serious.” His voice dropped. “There’s hazard pay on this. Big hazard pay. I don’t know what’s on it. I didn’t ask. But the guy who handed it off looked like he hadn’t slept in three days.”

She leaned in, playfully.

“You’re getting soft.”

“Just don’t joke. Don’t open it. Don’t turn it on. Don’t even look at it funny.”

He pushed the case forward.

She picked it up without hesitation. It had some weight to it. Older tech always did. No screen glow, no blinking lights. Just… off.

“All good,” she said, slipping it into her coat. “I’ve got this.”

She stood, gave him a mock salute, and turned for the door.

Harry didn’t move. Didn’t wave. Just watched her go.
Just tapped his knuckle once on the table. A quiet ritual for when things felt wrong.

⸻

Stahlburg Central Station. Main Concourse.

Betty stepped into the noise.

The ceiling arched like a cathedral, stained by time. Holographic ads shimmered across old stone pillars—bank offers, Champion recruitment pitches, perfume trails you could almost smell.

She kept her hood up and her pace steady.

The phone was still in her coat. The weight had settled in weird. Not heavy, just… present. Like it was listening.

She pushed through the crowd. Late lunch rush. Travelers. Office drones. A street performer blaring violin loops.

“East Gate,” she muttered to herself. “Locker drop, twenty-eight B. Easy.”

Her hand brushed the pocket again.

It was still there. Of course it was. But her fingers lingered. She hadn’t meant to do that.

Hazard pay, Harry had said.

She glanced back.

No one was following her. Just people. But her gut disagreed.

She veered left—off the main flow, past a vending kiosk flickering with static—and took the stairs down toward the old service corridors.

Quieter there. Fewer eyes.

Maybe too quiet.

⸻

Maintenance Level. Substation Access Corridor.

The hum of the station faded behind her—filtered through old concrete and steel. Betty’s boots echoed now. A sharp, hollow rhythm.

The lights flickered. Not enough to go out, just enough to notice.

The corridor sloped gently downward. Water stains ran like veins across the walls. Pipes lined the ceiling like exposed nerves. Somewhere far off, a pressure valve hissed.

“It’s fine,” she whispered. “Shortcut. That’s all.”

She wasn’t lost—she knew these tunnels. Runners used them. Couriers. Junkers. People who didn’t like being seen.

But the weight in her coat had changed.
Heavier again.

She tugged her hood tighter and turned the next corner. Stopped. Waited.

Nothing. Just a door marked “Substation 3A” and the soft buzz of old LEDs. She pressed forward.

Another sound. Behind her this time—soft.
Like leather brushing concrete.

She spun.
Nothing. Empty hallway. She could see all the way back to the stairwell.

Still… she walked faster.

Don’t open it. Don’t look at it funny.

The words were stuck in her head now. Not a warning. A loop.

She rounded one more bend—and then she saw him.
And the world got quiet.

⸻

Substation Corridor. Dim Lighting. Static in the Air.

He didn’t drop so much as appear.

One moment she was alone.
The next—he was there.

High up, crouched on the steel piping above. Then down. Fast. Too fast.
He hit the floor like gravity owed him. No sound. Just motion turned into stillness.

She froze.

He stood maybe four meters away. Tall. Broad. Armored in something that wasn’t metal, wasn’t cloth. Matte black with edges softened by dust and wear.

His face was covered.

His right hand rose. Palm toward her. Not a threat.

“Give me the phone.”

His voice was low. Flat. No heat. No anger. Just a request the room didn’t know how to refuse.

Betty blinked. Backed up a step.

“I—Look, I don’t know what kind of freak you are, but—”

She never finished.

The cold hit first. Like breath in winter. Her hand, the one holding the phone, went numb.

Then came the pain—clean, sharp, final.

A spike of ice as long as a ruler punched through her palm, through the phone, and into her chest. It drove straight through her, nailing her to the moment.

She didn’t even cry out. Just collapsed.

The figure moved before she hit the ground—eyes scanning the corridor, pivoting on instinct. No sign of the shooter. No noise, no trail.

He knelt. Reached toward the phone—or what was left of it.

The casing was shattered. The card inside had split. The girl was already gone.

He stayed there a moment longer. Silent.
Then stood.
And vanished back into the dark.

⸻

Broadcast Feed. 22:00 Report

The footage flickered to life: an overhead view from a security drone. Gray concrete. Industrial lighting. Two figures.

A tall, armored shape stepped forward, raising what looked like a handgun.
The smaller figure—slight, hoodie-clad—stepped back.
No sound. No struggle.

Then the flash.
The smaller figure crumpled.

There was no blood. Just the body, unmoving. The tall figure turned away and disappeared into the dark like a vanishing nightmare.

“Today, seventeen-year-old Betty Smith was found dead in a maintenance shaft beneath Stahlburg’s central transit system.”
“Authorities have confirmed the attacker as the unidentified individual known only as ‘The Sentinel.’”
“If you have any information on this dangerous figure, please contact local law enforcement or your district’s Champion liaison immediately.”

A still frame lingered:
The girl’s body.
The silhouette of the man.
And the bold text across the bottom:

WANTED – THE SENTINEL
THREAT RATING: UNCLASSIFIED. RISK LEVEL: UNKNOWN.

Click.

The screen went black.

A man stood still for a moment, remote in hand, then set it down slowly on the counter beside a half-empty coffee cup.

He clenched his fist.

“Damn it…”

He reached for the comm.
The message had already written itself.

Took about 23 or 33 pages on MS Word for this

Story starts ...

**Chapter Two – Final Part: Flaming Sword \~ ​​Beginning of A Revolution (Full Ver.)**

(Note, the sub-title \[after the tilte\] was added by MA after reading the title of this chapter)

The Story So Far: The Game Development Club has finally reached the Red Winter Plains and after months of not seeing each other, Kei and Malkuth have been ""reborn"". After receiving Sof's threat about the threat of Netzach and the Continent of Steel, the Millennium group set out for Netzach's shipping point in order to infiltrate the enemy. However, on the way, the group was suddenly attacked by the Decagrammaton group (Deca), Kei then unleashed Alice's power and the two of them came to understand each other better.

After defeating the enemy group of Deca, they could depart for their goal. And the story continues here...

I. Part One – Even In The Darkest Night, The Fire Still Not Falter

 

**\~ Episode 23: At The Seed Storage \~**

After a while since they set off, in the hazy fog of the Red Winter Arctic Region, the coordinates of the destination gradually appeared before everyone's eyes. Himari and Toki, after monitoring the situation of their destination, set their self-driving cars to autopilot.

According to Rio's calculations, they wouldn't be able to rest comfortably for the next two days, last night was the last night that everyone could rest like that, so everyone took the opportunity to do the last things before entering the enemy's heartland. Midori took the opportunity to talk about how Momoi slept so soundly that everyone had woken up, but she refused to wake up with everyone, so Eimi stuffed snow to wake Momoi up because she thought Momoi would wake up if it was cold. Momoi could only cry because of this snow stuffing.

Looking from afar, Alice saw a dark shadow in the distance, she got out of the car and saw a cute snow fox. Alice picked it up and showed her ""trophy"" to Kei, who was afraid for Alice because he was worried that she would get infected. (Me: Robot can’t get disease, what the hell wrong with your CPU?) But Alice didn't pay attention to it, she took the fox's paw and called Kei to shake its. Kei looked at it, it looked back at Kei, the two were wary of each other but reluctantly shook hands because of that cute child (Alice). Getting used to the smell, the fox licked Kei's robot hand, surprising Kei. Alice was happy because she saw that the fox liked Kei, while Kei just sighed because of that clumsy princess who loved wild animals. But it must have been God's will, but right after she finished complaining, a flock of penguins immediately appeared at the place where they were resting, Alice happily introduced Kei to her new friends despite Kei's attempts to stop her, Alice didn't care much and was even chased by those penguins! While Kei was being chased away, the other members of the Game Development Club were busy discussing the new ""Easter Egg"" mechanism related to these birds, and Himari looked at the penguins surrounding Kei and explained the properties of those birds, while Kei ran around to avoid the birds' ""love bites"".

https://preview.redd.it/9y54iwsq090f1.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=adf257abe80a3fe1d15609c54236c0b92c00bc07

After chasing them away, Kei was ""tired"" and started complaining about life.

Kei: Ha... Ha... This is why we can't communicate with people who don't speak the same language as us...!

Sensei: They must not have any intentions towards you.

Kei: That's why I hate it! I can't communicate normally; I can't even fight back!

Sensei: Oh... Kei is really a kind child! Her heart is so beautiful that I want to cry...

Kei: A-Are you kidding me?

Alice: Alice also thinks that it's great that Kei isn't angry anymore!

Alice: Thank you so much Kei... For being by our side!

 

Kei: Huh? W-What... Ah, um... No...

 

Kei: Ha...

 

Kei: Well, I don't have any reason to hate anyone anymore.

 

Alice: Yeah! Alice wanted to say that too!

 

Kei: Alice...

Toki interrupted their conversation to announce the departure; everyone quickly boarded the train to continue to the destination of this journey.

 

A moment later, the train arrived at their destination. Everyone got off and looked at the scenery before them. Rio and Himari were even more surprised when she recognized the location before her eyes.

 

Rio: This is the Seed Vault, which was built with the purpose of nurturing humanity in case the world was destroyed.

 

Himari: In other words, this is a large factory to store all kinds of seeds.

 

At the same time, the Decagrammaton's three engineers were also monitoring everything from afar, as the Seed Storage was the place where goods were transferred and managed to the Continent of Steel. Now Tiphareth had finally been discovered.

Ohr asked Ein to contact Tiphareth to report its current situation to them... Tiphareth reported back to them that all shipments to the Continent of Steel had been completed, now it would carry out its duty as a Prophet, eliminating all those who dared to step foot in its current residence. In other words, it would carry out its original role before it followed the Decagrammaton, ""protecting the seeds"".

 

Coincidentally, Malkuth also arrived, surprising the three sisters. Ein was startled, and Ohr asked Sof if they should tell Malkuth about the current situation, and Sof agreed. They didn't want their sister to worry anyway, so they should take care of it themselves.

 

Malkuth understood, but she also wanted to be able to help her younger siblings. How should she say this? To fulfill her ""duty"" as an older sister.

 

Malkuth: Helping people in times of need... Isn't that what a sister should do?

Malkuth's words moved her three younger siblings. The three of them began to tell Malkuth about the current situation. Only then could we learn more about Tiphareth's original identity. Before becoming a Seer serving the Decagrammaton, Tiphareth was an AI that managed and classified each seed containing different varieties designed by humans. When the Decagrammaton's ""teachings"" were conveyed to Tiphareth, it said, ""I will accept it...  I still want to keep the seeds here, because that is my mission..."". But, in essence, that mission was just a fake mission, in Ohr's eyes, she feared that it would go against the Decagrammaton's teachings.

Sof agreed, but she also accepted Tiphareth's will. It was a problem that, according to Ohr, had to be solved by itself. If it still carried out that mission even after it had received their teachings, then Sof would accept it. In other words...

Malkuth: I see... The problem was because of its free will.

Ein: S-Sister...

Malkuth: A child who simply obeys orders without knowing anything else──Then we can't say that it has a will.

Malkuth: In that case, it's hard to blame them.

 

Malkuth: ──You see, they were abandoned from the start without even realizing it.

 

Malkuth: But if Tiphareth, who accepted our ""teachings"" and understood what was going on──He still carried out the original duty that he was entrusted with,

 

Malkuth: Then if that was his choice, then we need to respect them.

 

Ohr: But big sister, people also say that freedom is just an illusion, right?

 

Malkuth: Even so, we still have to respect them. Because it is that free will that built you, me, and everyone.

 

Malkuth: If you're just like a Knight that moves when commanded by the general──

 

Malkuth: Then how can I meet and talk to Ein, Sof, and Ohr now, right?

 

Ein: I-I-I-I don't want that either!

 

Malkuth: Me too. So, Ein, Sof, and Ohr. Please respect the decisions of all the Prophets, including Tiphareth.

 

All three: Yes\~!

 

──Dawn has come.

The clouds will clear, and the morning sun will shine through the darkness.

I can't sleep because I don't know the time to set out.

 

But I believe, I believe in the Prophecy──I believe in myself, I believe in my brothers.

If anything happens, I will be there to protect you like your older sister.

 

All three: We are honored.

 

Malkuth: Don't worry anymore, because we are complete.

 

Malkuth: There is no need to evolve, there is no need to change ourselves.

 

Malkuth: Because that is how we were born.

 

Malkuth: Now, let us look at the world through Tiphareth's lens.

 

All three: Yes sis!

**\~ Episode 24 (Battle Stage): A Fainted Hope \~**

It had been a while since everyone entered the warehouse, the corridor they were moving through seemed to be endless, they could not see their destination anywhere. Looking around the facility, Rio commented on its similarity to the ""Millennium Vault"", a design that was quite ""Millennium"" as Rio said. However, this place was not among the facilities recorded in the Millennium.

 

Himari and Rio hypothesize that Millennium was commissioned by Red Winter to create this area, which makes sense, Red Winter doesn't have the intelligence to create an AI with this intelligence. Rio determined that the purpose of this facility was to open a way for humanity to survive when the world was approaching destruction, a repository for the post-apocalyptic world.

Himari: Really preparing for the destruction of humanity, there are some strange people in this world.

But the problem with this repository is its existence, why? No one knew about this place, no one knew the coordinates of this place. So, why build it? Could it be that it was only built in a moment? Or like Kei said, waiting for the day when someone found it so it could ""sprout"".

Kei: Like a seed.

Rio: Like...

Himari: Is it...

Alice: A seed...?

Alice: Kei finally understands life!

Kei: A-Ah no...! It's not that profound. I just think it's quite similar.

Kei: In the seed... There's the potential to sprout, something like that...?

Alice: That's right! That's right!

Sensei: \*laughs

Kei: Hey! Alice's smile is enough, why are you smiling too?

Rio: ...I want to add that

 

The ""no one knows"" part is a bit off.

Rio: At least, that's what I know.

Himari: The people who built the facility must be as ""weird"" as Rio, right?

Rio: If that's the case, I'd like to meet them for a constructive conversation.

Himari: That's not what I meant... Just one girl is more than enough.

Rio: What do you mean?

Himari: ...Never mind, the more I talk, the more my blood pressure increases.

While they were talking, all the lights in the hallway went out. Everyone was still panicking when Kei told everyone to be careful around them. Something was... Coming down to their place... From afar, a group of soldiers guarding the seed's facility. This battle was unavoidable; everyone was ready to welcome the group ahead.

From afar, the three Decagrammaton sisters were watching everything that was happening in the facility, they praised Tiphareth for deciding to probe the enemy's strength and take this opportunity to find out who broke through their multi-dimensional barrier. Ein was still worried about whether the place would collapse, but Sof reassured him, even someone like Tiphareth wouldn't let the place he was protecting collapse so needlessly, and hey, at least it could significantly reduce the enemy's fighting power, so why not try?

After the fight, the lights were turned on and the enemies had retreated, even the defeated ones couldn't be seen anymore, the ones that were still alive must have collected them. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief because they had repelled the enemy, but in their hearts, they all understood that this was just the beginning, maybe they were just testing their strength. Meanwhile, the four sisters who were watching the battle were all panicking because they discovered ""those"" two people.

 

https://preview.redd.it/3qx9f47y090f1.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=b85a846ecc5fb330b6445b98d761d5eda643f432

**\~ Episode 25: ""Life"" Is... (A Small Talk About ""Life"") \~**

The appearance of ""The Princess of the Nameless God"", AL-1S and ""The Key of the Nameless God"" made the three sisters panic because first, the design of the ""Key"" was extremely bad, so bad that it insulted robots (If Rio knew, Rio would cry), secondly because they had carelessly left the existence of both of them out of their calculations, also, the ""Key"" was their wavebreaker. But Ohr still wondered, since the ""Princess"" had abandoned her duty, why could she still use that power? Sof replied that if she still had the ""Key"" and knew how to use it, it would be different.

Before she could regain her composure, Tiphareth contacted them to ask for their help. Ohr realized that what Tiphareth asked for was not “support” but “permission”, just like “judgment” and “encouragement”.

 

 

Leaving the corridor, the Millennium group entered a new area with moss covering the walls and the night before them. The scent of green forest and clear water made everyone feel at ease. Looking around made people feel as if they were lost in nature, but Himari judged that this place was not suitable for cultivating seeds, looking at this place like that, it was difficult to keep it from the outside world…

 

A little further, the group found the door that they thought contained the seeds inside, but before everyone went inside, Toki recommended that everyone rest a bit before entering that room. Everyone agreed, the Game Development Club took the opportunity to clean up the moss covering a small corner and sat down to rest, and after a while, they fell asleep. The others also took this opportunity to explore around a bit.

Kei rolled her wheel down to a small corner of the dark room; she looked down at a patch of moss and she started asking. What is ""Life""?

Watch on YouTube: [https://youtu.be/JjcKmwy2CUI](https://youtu.be/JjcKmwy2CUI)

https://preview.redd.it/xx0p3qa8290f1.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ae8b988364b5e88484c2c708a305b50a8cc57da

.

On the other side, the three sisters were preparing a plan to welcome the Millennium group into the room before them. Sof thought that the human body also has limits so somehow there must be a certain limit so just break it and it's done. Sof told everyone the plan and Ein and Ohr agreed, they turned to ask their sister, then their sister told the three of them her view on ""life"":

Malkuth: I think life is between an optimal part and an optimal whole.

Malkuth: There are systems between living things called ecosystems.

Malkuth: The Hunter-Prey seems to be one-sided.

 

Malkuth: Without the concept of natural enemies, the entire system of life would collapse.

 

Sof: Ah! I heard that if the wolves disappeared and there were more deer, the land would die.

 

Ohr: Sof, you seem to understand that quite well, huh?

 

Sof: Is that not possible?

 

Ohr: No, I didn't say that. That system is the reason why I hate living so much.

 

Ohr: Existential crisis? Just leave me out of this

 

Sof: I understand…

 

Back to the main point, Malkuth ordered the three after having specific data for Tiphareth to consider, which probably wasn't necessary since Tiphareth had already made its decision and was waiting for the three's orders. Quite smart, coming from Tiphareth's position, after all, under His will, they were one.

 

**\~ Episode 26:**

 

**The Light That Illuminates the Darkness \~**

After resting, the group entered the room ahead. It seemed to have been abandoned for a long time, so moss grew all over the room, and there were even puddles of water in some places. Looking closely, the walls were made up of countless cabinets, and when Himari opened one of them, she could clearly see that the seeds were securely preserved in these cabinets. Furthermore, although the connection between this facility and the central facility had been broken, the shelter that stored the seeds inside was still intact, and even functioning.

 

Toki: Millennium's technology in this entire Kivotos is number two, no one is number one.

 

Although Toki was so proud, Rio thought of another possibility. Up to now, any artificial intelligence (AI) that had come into contact with the Decagrammaton had shown different behaviors compared to their original targets. For example, Hod – who used to be an AI to support the communications department at Millennium, or recently, Chokmah, who was originally a warship but whose original form they could no longer see. However, the AI ​​that supports this Seed Vault continues to manage the seeds here even after it has become a Seer.

 

Surely, it has a mission assigned to it. But strangely, even if that AI has become a Seer, the fact that that AI has recognized the work of its creator must be valuable. So why, does it still do its own job?

Could it be that it is the will of all three Seers, or is it just Tiphareth's individual will? Or maybe...

Rio: ...That Seer may have self-awareness.

 

At this moment, a cloud of smoke enveloped the room, the group was surprised by that thing and slowly fell down one by one in front of Alice and Kei, even Sensei was caught and then passed out...

 

Inside the Shittim Box, Arona and Plana were protecting their Sensei, luckily the two of them pulled Sensei in in time before Sensei was exposed to the gas for too long, because Plana discovered that it was poisonous. For a normal student's body, it would be fine, but if exposed for too long, there would be problems, after all, it was poisonous.

 

https://preview.redd.it/rf2ca2kc290f1.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=e92fef4dcc3f4bc4eb3d8f23e45d8f7ea42b56e2

Arona: ""Um, why am I suddenly so sleepy now that we're talking about these things...""

 

Plana: ""Arona-san, if you sleep now...""

 

Arona: ""I'm just kidding! Seriously, I can't sleep well!""

 

Plana: ""Accept it. At times like this, Arona-san supports me mentally, in her own unique way.""

 

Arona: ""my own unique way?""

Sensei slowly woke up as Arona reported that Kei was approaching them. Kei was surprised that Sensei woke up before his students, as if he wasn't affected. While she was doubting it, Alice cried because her ""stats were down"". Well, let it be, Sensei asked Kei about everyone's condition, Kei said that it didn't have much effect on everyone's meridians, but just like Plana analyzed, this place shouldn't be stayed for long.

Kei started to tell about what they experienced after everyone fainted. Alice and Kei found something that looked like a control panel in the center of the seed storage area. It didn't respond when Kei touched it, and Alice's only blinked once and then glowed continuously, they thought it might have a problem. Luckily, Sensei was awake now so they could try touching the control panel, since it wouldn't kill anyone to try anyway.

Sensei asked if they had used other people's hands, Kei and Alice answered no, because Alice stopped her and Kei was ""afraid"" that Rio would consider it a reasonable thought, so he stopped.

Sensei went to the console and placed his hand on it. This time, the screen showed the school's logo, the three of them sat together in front of the console screen while the other console showed the video left by their predecessors... . . . ""Hello Comrade! Or the person watching this recording who is not Comrade also greeting!""

""Welcome Comrade to Red Winter's Seed Vault!""

(Me: OH MY GOD! THESE ARE THE BUNKERS OF THE RUSSIA BLACK ARMY BY DIMITRI YAZOV, THIS WORLD HAS BEEN GREAT TRIAL’ED ONCE!!!)

\[Beeeeeep – Sorry lol\]

""This is the 'cradle of life' built when the world's destruction was near. It is the last hope of this advanced civilization.""

""Instead of greeting, I really wanted to play my favorite song to share with Comrade. But since this was banned yesterday, let's play it another time!""

""This facility was built for you, and it was also built for us.""

 

""'Even if this world reaches its end, we can still start over' – The existence of this Seed Vault will become a paradise for humanity.""

 

""We don't need to be afraid anymore; we can live in peace... Even if in the not-too-distant future, the apocalypse comes... We will never know why it happened──""

 

""But I can't imagine... What it feels like to listen to this recording... When we're in the apocalypse...""

""We had to spend a lot of money to build this facility. One of them was making pudding to cover the construction costs

 

... Looking back now, it was truly a beautiful memory.""

 

""Those who are taking over this place now, I hope you will have a smooth ride.""

 

""Now, perhaps the day of judgment has come. I feel that all the efforts we have put in now have been completely worth it.""

 

""Tsk, I've been babbling too much. This facility is the Seed Vault, the final light that will shine through this darkness of destruction.""

 

""In order to preserve the seeds until the right time, this facility is equipped with defenses, and in order to keep everything fresh, we decided to skip the testing step.""

 

""In other words, what you have been preparing to touch... We haven't touched it yet. Be prepared for any situation that may arise when you operate it.""

 

""Oh right, we'll give you access to the management facility of Division 3, and in addition──You won't be able to access the second storage facility without the permission of the Commanding Committee.""

 

""That place is the important facility that holds 70% of humanity's seeds. If there's any sabotage or trying to enter without permission, you... Um... You'll...""

 

""Tsk, I can't think of a word. I haven't had coffee to quench my thirst recently; it seems like I'm seriously lacking coffee...""

 

""Um... It seems like the worst kind of punishment... If possible, it would be the thing you hate the most... Um, what is the thing you hate the most?""

 

""...Well, let's leave it at that. We have no way of knowing what you're thinking or saying but thank you for your cooperation. Please, do not access the second archive.""

 

""That said, I'm sorry I can't show you what's inside. It wasn't originally intended to serve as a storage facility... Besides, it's much, much neater than Section 3.""

 

""Well, that's life, just like the first batch of Blinis that comes out of the oven will eventually be eaten and crumbled──Things can't work the way you think they do.""

 

""Let's leave the past behind and focus on the moment of destruction... We'll do better tomorrow than last time.""

 

""That concludes our instructions and warnings. I hope the coming calamity will be gentle on you.""

 

""And...""

""<What? Something strange has appeared... HUH? The storage is full?> <This──>""

.

The voice recording ended before the three of them were stunned, although there was a bit of confusion and wonder when seeing what was before their eyes, but whatever, what the three of them were concerned about was the second storage that was considered a forbidden area, if they entered, they would suffer the worst fate that humans could think of.

At this moment, once again, the light went out. This time, the three of them were separated in the darkness and standing before the three of them, Ohr Ein Sof appeared with a certain ""discomfort"" on their faces.

Ein: H-Hello everyone and Sensei... We meet again...

Sof: Seriously, you're really too stubborn.

Ohr: Wouldn't it be easier to just give up now?

Sensei: I can't do that. As a teacher, I can't abandon my students.

Sof: Now, suppose we told you, ""We are your students!"", would you forgive us?

Sensei: I'm willing, the transfer papers are ready, you just need to sign.

Sof: Geez... Are you the type who doesn't know what's a joke and what's real?

Ein: S-Should I call this type of person... Greedy?

Ohr: Sorry to disappoint you, we're not interested...

Ohr: Transferring schools is a definition you humans created, right? It means nothing to us.

Sensei: I thought you came here to request a transfer, so what's your purpose?

Sof: H-How interesting... You really don't know how to read a room...

Sof: Anyway. What we want to say is──If you dare to step over there, there will be no turning back.

Ohr: Yeah, it means “going beyond the limit”.

Ohr: Let me borrow Sof’s words, we came here to “declare war”.

**II. Part Two – I Ask Of Thee, To Which Purpose Thee Live For?**

**\~ Episode 27: Innocent Sins And Eternal Punishment \~**

Ein Sof and Ohr appeared before Alice, Kei, and Sensei. The first time they met the person who destroyed their barrier, the three of them were a bit curious and surprised, but then, they felt regretful...

Ohr: Princess... We're really sorry. A ""conscious"" entity that forgot its origins.

Ohr: It's like──A ""living being"".

Alice: W-What do you mean...?

Ein: T-That must be because... There's no living being in this world that has memories from before it was born... Right?

Sof: Yes, if we consider the cycle of life, it's a normal matter

Ohr: But ""conscious"" life forms like us and the princess are completely different from those ""living creatures"".

Ohr: It is the ""Glory"" that was bestowed upon us!

Ohr: So I have to express my regret for you, the Princess who gave up her Glory.

Ohr: Along with the servant who remained silent even when he was by the Princess' side.

Alice: Kei, do you understand anything? Alice doesn't understand anything.

Kei: Don't listen to those words, it's not worth listening to.

Sof: Oh... Is that so? Okay, let's talk a little more. Talk about... ""Life"".

Sof: Don't you think that existing in this world is a curse?

Sensei: ""Curse""?

Sof: Think about it. Why does a baby cry when it is born?

Sof: The answer is simple... Because it's painful. Suddenly having to breathe through your own body parts and then waking up to find yourself surrounded by strangers and sounds you've never heard before.

Sof: That's why, ever since you were born, existence is suffering.

Ohr: Alas... How painful, for no reason, you give me something I don't want. Oh, how cruel! It's the absurdity of this world!

Ohr: If only there was someone who understood! Someone who could understand the pain that humanity is enduring──

Ohr: But even so... It's hard to enlighten someone or make someone enlighten.

Ohr: If no one understands you, and only you can bear the suffering... If existence is punishment, then what is ""evil karma""?

Ohr: This life is a world of ""man eat man"", we have to harm others to survive. So, we have to create ""evil karma"" to survive... Ha! What a joke.

Sof: All mortals in this world are the same, without exception. This isn't just for humans, right?

Sof: Plants are the same. They always compete. It doesn't matter if they're of the same species.

Sof: Those who dare to make it grow roots, block the light... All of them are ""evil karma"".

Sof: So, I want to free us from the curse of existence... So we can live without creating evil karma and without being punished.

Ein: That's right... We don't want to kill you guys... (Me: But removing existence isn’t different with killing so I say it once again, fix your damn CPU)

Sof: Our goal isn't to rule the world.

Ohr: We choose to do this because we respect you more than anything in this world.

 

Sensei: Can you explain further?

Sof: That's impossible. We have our own adversities.

Sof: After all, for us, you're the one we need to deal with.

Ein: A-Because we exist to save everyone, ehehe...

Ohr: Haven't you suffered enough? What's wrong with living comfortably?

Ohr: For example, setting high goals and torturing yourself in order to achieve them... Why do you have to do that?

Ein: A-Because in order to achieve a high position, you have to bully others and push them down...

Sof: But I understand. You can't do anything else. Because you're just a ""living being"".

Sof: How can you, ""living creatures"" know the future──?

Sof: You can't know the consequences of your choices, so you can never make ""reasonable choices"".

Sof: How can you predict without knowing the outcome? That's why you've become so irrational.

Ohr: Freedom is suffering. How can you bear the weight of responsibility that comes with freedom?

Ohr: It's a concept that shouldn't exist in human consciousness in the first place.

Ohr: Because life is fragile, unpredictable, and completely uncertain.

Kei: Oh, I tried to stay quiet and listen to what you guys wanted to say... But in the end, it was all for nothing, there was no way to create a random number.

Alice: K-Kei?

Kei: Surprised? There's nothing surprising about it.

Kei: To start with, we're both the same, right?

Ohr: ""Key""...!

Kei: You're all babbling about ""Key"" this, ""Key"" that...

Kei: MY NAME IS ""KEI""!

Kei: And she's not ""Princess""! Her name is ""ALICE"".

Ein: B-B-But those names are just meaningless names just because they're mispronounced...?

Kei: How do you understand?

Kei: ...Even now, I really hate those living creatures.

Kei: If I'm not careful, I might get hurt and I might hurt others.

Ein: A-Ah... So you understand... Ehehe...

Kei: That's... What I'm saying is, without that living creature, you guys can't exist, you know?

Sof: What are you talking about?

Kei: Furthermore, there's clearly a contradiction in your words, right?

Kei: ...Why do you keep asking Tiphareth to keep those seeds?

Sof: Th-That's because... In order to preserve something, you need to clearly define the goal...

Ohr: Ah, We starting to babble about the boring reason again

Sof: Shut up! Whose side are you on?

(Ohr and Sof continue to fight, only stopping when Ein intervenes.)

Sof: ...Ahem. Well, we have our own conflicts, anyway.

Sof: At least we're better than you guys, because we're motivated by reason, not by desire.

Kei: If that's the case... Can we call consciousness without desire consciousness?

Kei: Furthermore, saying desire is reason, then who defines it?

Ein: T-That...

Kei: At least I hope that's not your opinion. After all, I don't want to think of it as an indeterminate consciousness.

Kei: Rules are things you set for yourself.

Kei: Since this is a rule, I set for myself, I'll abide by it.

Kei: Well, of course, the process is a bit complicated and inefficient...

Sof: THEN! That's it! That's why I always say that life is finite!

Sof: It takes a while for you to evolve into one step!

Ohr: Right. Because it's also possible that everything can become nothing due to errors or malfunctions that you don't even know about.

Ein: Y-That's right! So... That's why we're trying to stop them...

Sof: Before you guys... Destroy this world yourself.

Sensei: In that case... You guys should open up your eyes and look.

Sof: Are you crazy! Did you drink too much gas and go crazy?

Ein: U-U-U-Uah?! Come on, everything should go back to normal...?!

Ohr: There are rumors that he was a strange person from the beginning...

Sensei: I'm fine, I'm being serious.

Ohr: I don't think it's appropriate to say that.

Sensei: No. No matter what our ending is. That's the result of our choices.

Sof: Do you really want to be destroyed?!

Sensei: If that's the ending that everyone has chosen, then I'll just accept it.

Sensei: If we can choose and the ending is tragic... I'd rather have it be like that, than be protected by others and lose the right to decide for ourselves.

Alice: Alice really doesn't understand what Sensei means.

Sensei: It's okay, Alice. The process is a bit difficult, but I can do it with my own hands.

Sensei: We'll continue to move forward and learn more experiences.

Sof: What kind of baseless confidence is this...

Sof: Then aren't you fooling yourself?

Sensei: ...Yeah, maybe. But as long as we're still alive, we have no choice but to look towards the future.

Sensei: Moreover, you guys don't have any real evidence, right?

Sof: I'm so pissed!

Ohr: So this is the stupidity of life, isn't it?

Ohr: Haa... As expected, this world is really TOO ABSURD.

Ein: U-Um... Sensei. Can I ask you something?

Ein: Th-The thing is... If I could atone for my sins...

Ein: Do you think... I could repent and change the outcome?

Sensei: That's possible.

Sof: Geez, I'm so embarrassed to say it.

Sof: Well, let's end the story here. That's enough time-killing.

Sensei: Is that all? I want to hear more of your stories.

Ohr: DON'T MERG IN OUR BUSINESS!

Sof: OK, I'll never see you again!

Ein: O-Um... Sensei... If possible, then...

Sof: No, Ein! Don't get involved with this kind of adult!

Ohr: Yeah! Otherwise, you'll be ""swallowed""!

Sof: They say that kind of adult is a ""venomous snake"".

Ein: E-Eh? R-R-Venomous snake? What is it?

Sof: He may look like that, but he must have some evil intentions!

Sof: Sensei, you must have a dark heart, huh?

Ein: T-T-T-T-Really? S-S-Sensei, you're really scary... (Even though you don't look like it...?)

Sensei: If you want, just contact me.

Ohr: Okay.

Sof: If you dare to touch Ein, I won't forgive you!

.

So after a quick conversation (and damn it was 3 pages long), the three of them were in a dangerous situation, with the danger of three engineers and Tiphareth not letting them leave easily. Faced with the current dangerous situation, Sensei suddenly thought of something that could change the situation.

Remember, the video said that if you dare to step into the second storage room, you will be ""punished"" and Rio also said that the AI ​​controlled the entire area. Sensei told Kei that they would attack the entrance of the second warehouse. Kei heard it and said:

 

Kei: Are you crazy?

 

**\~ Episode 28 (Battle Stage): Tiphareth (The Sixth Propeth) \~**

 

Kei and Alice were completely in disbelief about what they had heard. Alice didn't want to destroy the place that everyone had built, and Kei was worried about what they had been warned about, but then she suddenly thought. It was indeed possible, but doing this without a gun was a bit...

 

Kei: Haa... If anything bad happens, I'll blame you, Sensei.

 

After saying that, Kei shouted.

 

Kei: Tiphareth! Are you listening to me? From now on, I will steal your seeds!

 

On the other side, the sisters laughed loudly at Kei's words. It was like an egg hitting a rock, with only three people's strength, how could they steal it even if they broke the door? At this moment, the alarm in the conference room rang, Ein read the message sent by Tiphareth.

 

""Starting resource allocation""

 

""Distributing all the power of the facility to protect the second storage facility.""

 

""The pending tasks include: Installing a partition wall, changing the temperature and humidity in the second storage facility, and stopping the release of gas in the third area.""

Ohr: ...HUH? ""STOP RELEASE OF GAS IN THE THIRD AREA""?!

 

Just as Sensei predicted, the gas in their room was completely turned off, Kei still couldn't believe Sensei's plan could succeed, and Alice was extremely happy because everyone finally woke up, one by one after a very good sleep and gradually, their physical strength was restored.

The three sisters watched everyone slowly stand up in a daze, Sof felt guilty for doing what Tiphareth said, she knelt down and was about to cry but Ohr helped Sof up. She encouraged Sof that everyone still trusted what Sof did and everyone still needed her to make things work. Malkuth also agreed.

Malkuth: Harmony, it's not that everyone is the same. If that happens, it becomes a concept close to coercion and violence.

Malkuth: Complementing each other's strengths and making up for each other's weaknesses──That's true harmony.

Malkuth: If we don't respect each other, we can't move forward.

Malkuth: So one's responsibility is everyone's responsibility, and everyone's happiness is one's happiness.

Ein: O-Oh…!

Malkuth: No one can become strong alone. Whether it's a living creature or a conscious entity.

Malkuth: If someone is in trouble, we need to help.

Malkuth: Hate evil karma, but not evil people. Instead of criticizing mistakes, let's think together about how to prevent mistakes from happening.

Malkuth instructed Ein to call Tiphereth to calm down, and it took a while for Tiphareth to slowly lower the danger level and prepare for a major attack on the room where the Millennium group was. Before the battle, the three sisters discussed making Tiphareth a part of the Continent of Steel. It might be possible to save electricity and prepare for any eventuality. Before doing that? We have to defeat Millennium first.

 

In the room, everyone felt a strong aftershock signaling the arrival of the 6th Prophet, Tiphareth. Everyone prepared their resources and got ready to fight against this new enemy.

 

https://preview.redd.it/0hwkv9h5190f1.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=47eb6b8b33e7a44f54c929ed903606c2812cca33

**\~ Episode 29: Whereabouts of The Cargo \~**

After a tense battle, the Millennium group successfully defeated Tiphareth.

 

Alice was happy to finally defeat a midboss while Himari and Rio took the opportunity to analyze this new Prophet, the way it moved and acted was different from what they had seen before (quite naturally), Toki and Eimi also felt that the parts used to keep the seeds warm could also be used to create a terrific heat that could burn the seeds themselves. Everyone came to the conclusion that Tiphareth had used all of her strength to focus on destroying the enemy before even protecting the seed.

Well, it sounds a bit scary but oh well, it's time for everyone to celebrate for defeating this enemy. Sensei was surrounded by the Millennium group who wanted to be patted on the head and praised, while Kei out there felt sorry for Sensei for having to endure all this.

On the other side, the three sisters were in a panic because they didn't expect Tiphereth to lose. Tiphereth sent an apology signal to the three of them for not fulfilling her duty, but Ohr didn't care, she just wanted to save Tiphareth so that she could keep its life. Sof had an idea, she asked Ein to expand the space for the last container, but Ein said that it was impossible because it would take 30 minutes to do it and they didn't have much time left.

Sof came up with a bold idea. They would blow up the entire ground beneath them and they could put Tiphareth inside and launch the missile at the same time. Ein agreed and immediately put the plan into action.

The entire facility shook violently and everyone seemed to be about to lose their balance because of the violent shaking. At that moment, an announcement came from the loudspeaker, announcing that the facility they were standing in was about to close down and signal everyone to leave. As soon as they got out, the inside exploded immediately. Before Alice could regain her composure, she discovered a container underneath the destroyed floor. It was immediately obvious that it was the transportation facility of the Seed Storage and guaranteed that this was the place where all the resources were moved to the Iron Metal Continent.

They were about to approach but Midori stopped them because she had a feeling it would be launched immediately.

 

After hearing Midori's words, they backed away and it immediately shot out of the ground, flying away to everyone's amazement. Only then could everyone collect evidence below, while Eimi stayed behind because she was afraid of the heat.

Himari and Rio analyzed the mechanism of the other transport system, a very ""romantic"" looking system called the Container Launch Platform because that was its main use. All materials were moved from everywhere to gather here and then launched across the Continent of Steel. Himari thought that if they could analyze the rails of this launch platform, they could know the exact coordinates of the Continent of Steel, and at the same time, they could survey this place again.

That's more work to do, call Eimi and promise to buy her an ice cream and then let's get to work.

1kkgecq,https://v.redd.it/r1cm5pc5490f1,Steam Deck Flashing,"Hi -- submitted a support request about this but figured I'd send it here in case Reddit had any sage advice as well. 

I've attached a video of what my Steam Deck has decided to start doing when I'm playing it. Sorry about the gross screen LOL. It flashes like this in short intervals, then it becomes okay for as long as a couple hours, and then it starts flashing again. Sometimes to the point where it's physically ""on"": music/sound is playing, I can hear my character in my game walking around, but it seems all the pixels are dead. I can even hear it switch to the Home Screen if I press the steam button. If I turn it off and on again it works, but then the cycle will be quick to repeat itself.

My steam deck **IS** refurbished, so I'm not shocked if it's just a hardware issue that carried over from whoever had it last, but that doesn't make me less pissed because I've only had this thing since February and also it was $400. 

I haven't dropped it or done anything to it, it's literally sat on my coffee table unless I'm playing it. 

Just wondering if this has happened to anyone else or if anyone has any ideas on why it happened/what to do. I'm not interested in fixing it in any way myself, and am mostly just looking to hear back from Steam and get it fixed/replaced by them. But again, I figured Reddit always has choice words so I might as well put it here too. But please be nice to me I'm sensitive!",13,1747012476.0,SteamDeck,4,0.85,False

Ever feel like you’re cruising through life at 100 mph but getting nowhere? Yeah, me too! It's like we’re on that hamster wheel—it looks exciting, but are we really getting results? 

Not too long ago, I found myself in that exact scenario. I was busy, overwhelmed, and let’s be real, a little burnt out. But then, something clicked. Instead of trying to crank up the speed, I decided to *embrace inertia*. 

You might be wondering, ""What on earth is inertia?"" Well, in this context, it’s about harnessing the power of already established habits and routines to propel yourself forward. Think of it like riding a bike—once you’re moving, it’s easier to keep going than to start from a complete stop!

Here’s how I turned inertia into my secret weapon:

1. **Identify Your Momentum** 🏃‍♂️
   - What are the routines or habits you find yourself slipping into without thinking? For me, it was my morning coffee ritual—perfect time to sneak in some journaling.
   - Analyze what's working for you already; even the small things can make a big difference.

2. **Make Small Adjustments** ✨
   - Instead of overhauling your entire life, tweak what you already do. I added 10 minutes of stretching after my coffee instead of scrolling through my phone. 
   - Those tiny changes create ripples that lead to significant shifts over time. 

3. **Set Easy Wins** 🎯
   - Create miniature goals that are so simple, you can’t say no. When I aimed to read just *one page* a day, I often ended up reading a chapter—or more!
   - Celebrate those wins! Because let’s be real, who doesn’t love a good pat on the back?

4. **Be Patient with Yourself** ⏳
   - Here’s where roadblocks often creep in. Remember, you won’t see changes overnight. But that’s the beauty of inertia; it builds gradually. 
   - I used to get so frustrated when progress felt slow. Now, I remind myself that every little step counts! 

5. **Reflect and Adjust** 🧘‍♀️
   - Maybe those adjustments didn’t feel quite right? That’s totally okay! Reflect on what’s working and what’s not, and shift your approach without guilt. 
   - A monthly check-in with yourself can be a game changer.

In a world pushing for hustle culture, slowing down feels rebellious, doesn’t it? But by harnessing inertia instead of fighting against it, I found this peaceful balance that keeps me moving forward in a more sustainable way. 

So, if you’re stuck in hyperdrive, remember: it's okay to ease up on the gas and let momentum do its thing. **What’s one small change you could make today to harness that inertia?** Who knows? You might just find your next breakthrough waiting for you around the corner! 🚀",1,1747012456.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1kkgddr,https://v.redd.it/ckdyq8od490f1,"My Iced Pourover Recipe with Gevi pourover machine for Sweet, Bright flavor","Hey r/pourover, I’ve been hooked on iced pourover lately, especially with summer vibes kicking in and been tweaking a recipe using my Gevi 4 in 1 pourover to get sweet, bright flavors from a medium-light roast Ethiopian bean. Here’s what I landed on after some trial and error. I'm curious about what you think!

I’m using 20g (0.71oz) of beans, ground on the built-in grinder at setting 22 (no real reference since grinders vary). Water’s 230ml at 92°C (198°F), filtered, aiming for a 1:11.5 coffee-to-water ratio. But I add \~120g ice in the glass, so the final ratio’s closer to 1:16-1:17. Bloom with 60ml water for 40 seconds. Then pour 170ml in one go and let it drip through. The total brew time is about 2:30. After the drip, I stir the coffee to balance the flavor.

The first try was too bitter, and the grind was too fine. Bumped it coarser, and now it’s super sweet with peach and honey notes, no harsh edges. The ice mellows it without killing the brightness. Kinda loving this setup, tbh. Anyone else messing with iced pourover ratios or bloom tweaks?",1,1747012388.0,pourover,4,0.6,False

Alright, friends, let me start with a question: Have you ever had one of those ""Aha!"" moments where something tiny turned into a game-changer? Maybe it was a new morning routine or a little tweak in your daily grind. 

For me, it was as simple as **jotting down three things I’m grateful for every day.** Yep, that’s it! It sounds like a Pinterest quote, but hear me out!

### Here’s why it worked:
1. **Shifts Your Mindset:** When you actively seek out things to be grateful for, your brain starts to focus on the positives. Ever tried this? It’s like switching from a black-and-white movie to full-on technicolor!
  
2. **Boosts Your Mood:** Seriously, it’s fun. I immediately feel lighter and more hopeful. Pro tip: Sometimes, I even add the craziest things, like “I’m grateful for coffee, even if it’s a little burnt today.” 😂

3. **Creates Accountability:** I now hold myself responsible for looking for the good stuff in my life. My notebook is like a treasure chest of positivity—who wouldn’t want that?

4. **Spills into Other Areas:** It’s like a domino effect! Suddenly, I’m kinder to myself and others. I smile more at strangers (and coffee baristas too). Small shifts lead to big waves!

### Some fun moments:
- I found myself grateful for *the random cat that decided to sit on my lap during work.* Instant stress relief?
- Realized I’m super thankful for the weather—because who doesn’t love a good rainy day to cozy up with hot chocolate? 

Honestly, it seems so small, but it’s amazed me how much I've changed my perspective this year. I’m curious—what about you? What’s that *one* micro-habit that changed your year? I’m all ears! 🥳 Let’s swap stories and ideas! 

And if you’ve never tried something for gratitude, maybe you should! Who knows, it might just spark your next ""Aha!"" moment. ✨",1,1747012370.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
