1lzgu7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Home/comments/1lzgu7b/why_smart_home_appliances_are_more_than_just_a/,Why Smart Home Appliances Are More Than Just a Convenience,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to spark a conversation around smart home appliances ‚Äî not just from a ""cool gadgets"" perspective, but how they're genuinely transforming our homes in practical and sustainable ways.

# What Are Smart Home Appliances?

In short, they‚Äôre everyday home devices that connect to your Wi-Fi or other networks and can be controlled remotely, often via smartphone apps, voice assistants (Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri), or automation routines.

Think:

* Smart refrigerators that monitor groceries and suggest recipes
* Washing machines that run during off-peak hours to save electricity
* Smart ovens you can preheat on your way home
* Robotic vacuum cleaners (hello, Roomba) that map your home
* Even smart air conditioners and ceiling fans that adjust based on your preferences

# Why Bother? Are They Worth It?

**1. Energy Efficiency & Cost Savings:**  
Most [smart home appliances](https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/smart-home-appliances-market-3775) are designed to use less energy. For instance, smart thermostats like Nest learn your habits and adjust heating/cooling to minimize waste ‚Äî which can lower utility bills significantly.

**2. Convenience & Automation:**  
Set it and forget it. From running the dishwasher at night to getting alerts when the laundry is done, smart appliances save time. You can even automate tasks based on routines or sensors (e.g., turn on the coffee machine when you wake up).

**3. Remote Monitoring & Control:**  
Ever left home wondering if you turned off the oven? Smart appliances let you check and control devices from anywhere. Some also notify you if there‚Äôs a malfunction or maintenance issue.

**4. Integration with Smart Ecosystems:**  
Most devices now play well with Alexa, Google Home, Apple HomeKit, etc. Imagine saying: ‚ÄúHey Google, I‚Äôm leaving,‚Äù and your house powers down the non-essentials.

# Some Cool Use Cases

* **Smart Fridge:** It detects you‚Äôre out of milk and adds it to your shopping list.
* **Smart Dishwasher:** Automatically delays washing to the cheapest energy window.
* **Washer/Dryer:** Sends a ping to your phone when done. No more forgetting and rerunning cycles.
* **Air Purifiers & Humidifiers:** Monitor indoor air quality and adjust settings based on real-time data.

# Downsides?

Yes, there are a few things to watch out for:

* **Privacy & Data Sharing:** Some devices collect usage data, so read the fine print.
* **Wi-Fi Dependency:** No internet = no remote control.
* **Cost:** Higher upfront cost vs. traditional appliances.
* **Compatibility Issues:** Not all brands play nicely together.

# A Few Brand Recommendations

Based on user reviews and personal experience:

* **Smart Thermostats:** Nest, Ecobee
* **Smart Fridges:** Samsung Family Hub
* **Washers/Dryers:** LG ThinQ, Whirlpool Smart
* **Robotic Vacuums:** iRobot Roomba, Roborock
* **Dishwashers:** Bosch Home Connect

Would love to hear from others ‚Äî

1lzgt1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1lzgt1b/guy_recognized_me_from_one_class_three_years_ago/,guy recognized me from one class three years ago ü§î possibly interested? AIO?,"this post might be stupid because i think it's unlikely that i'll see him again, or at least not for a long time‚Äî but i randomly think about it and i'd love some feedback! (im gonna use weeks bc it helps me keep track lol) 

TLDR at bottom!

around a month and a half ago i'd enrolled in a summer class, where id drive to campus twice a week for class and then stay in the library to study for an upcoming exam. since its summer there werent many students in the lib aside from students in one of our grad programs, and the ones that were there i tended to notice. 

one day after class (five weeks ago) i made eye contact with this pretty cute guy in passing, and idk it seemed like he looked in recognition? but i overthink so i played it off. left my bag and went for coffee. came back a little later and decided i wanted to move, so i went to a diff table, and just then he moved his bag and sat at the table next to mine. again, didnt think much of it. 

eventually he asked if he knew me from somewhere, and we figured out that he was one class with me when i was a freshman (and based on his grad date, he was a junior at the time). i took his word for it because the profs matched up and it was a small class, but i honestly dont remember interacting with him, it wasnt a class where youd talk to others much, and though id say im a talkative person, because of the quiet nature of the class in general i barely ever spoke to anyone. 

he eventually revealed he'd been meaning to ask me where be knew me from because he'd seen me around the pasy few days, which i was confused by because i'd never seen him in the library other days i was there (and was mostly in a private study room anyway). anyways it didn't really seem creepy so we kept talking. because we'd been chatting for a bit and he ended up coming to stand/lean over the side of my desk, i offered him to sit next to me but he kinda brushed it off? (i assumed it was because he'd go back to studying but the whole time we talked he just stood there). 

soon after he left to study, and i only saw him again one week later (so four weeks ago). the convo was like five minutes because he had a class but again, friendly, seemed nice, good eye contact i think? but idk didn't ask for my number or ig or anything. the last week i was there for class (so three weeks ago) i tried to see if he'd show at the library a third time but i had to go so we didn't get to talk after the second time. 

i feel like an idiot explaining ""long and meaningful eye contact"" so im not going to but i was just curious about others' thoughts on this. 

tldr; saw cute guy at lib few weeks ago, came up to me bc he'd noticed me multiple times and allegedly recognized me from *one* class we had three years ago (and never had classes together again). convo flowed, but didnt ask for ig or number, didn't take my offer to sit next to me, but came up on his own a second time the week after to talk while he coudl before class. my summer class ended soon after so i didnt see him after that

also i didnt ask for ig or number or anything bc i dont wanna make a fool of myself and get attached... (context i get attached p quick and exactly a week before our first interaction a dude i'd been ralking to admitted to leading me on LMAO)

About a month ago, my buddy- total tech nerd and crypto geek - told me about a method to make money that turned out to be insanely simple and surprisingly profitable.

Someone I can laugh with, have deep conversations with and care so much about in this whole world as if she is the only person that matters.

I'm a Simple man who treasures every moment of his life. I love Humor, watching wrestling, football, movies, shows, listening to music and going out to enjoy the weather and get a good meal at a good restaurant or a coffee.

I'm a Muslim by faith but Spiritual. I believe religion. Is one's own personal connection to God so it's just your heart that matters to me. 

If your love is as deep as the ocean and as bright as the stars and eyes that a man can drown in. If your words and conversations provide comfort to my soul and your touch heals my soul, what more can I ask for? That's the woman I want to settle down with.

If you believe you are that woman, feel free to send me a chat. I'd love to know you better and see where this goes.

And yet, the city? Fully awake. Neon reflections bouncing off skyscrapers, delivery bikes whizzing by, crypto tickers glowing like it's mid-day. Welcome to the new norm: 24/7 exchangers, where money ‚Äî whether paper or digital ‚Äî never sleeps.

Let‚Äôs get real. This isn‚Äôt just a local quirk. It‚Äôs a full-on shift in how finance breathes in this part of the world. And places like [bitloga.com](https://bitloga.com/index.php?ref=274)? They‚Äôre not just keeping up ‚Äî they‚Äôre setting the tempo.

# Dubai doesn‚Äôt do ‚ÄúOff hours‚Äù

You ever tried to find a working ATM in the middle of the night back home? Good luck. But in Dubai? Night owls and day-grinders share the same space. Time zones blur. Business deals happen over midnight coffee. So naturally, needing to swap fiat for crypto at 4 a.m. isn't weird ‚Äî it‚Äôs... expected.

# A melting pot of transfers

Dubai‚Äôs full of expats ‚Äî engineers, freelancers, investors, dreamers ‚Äî all moving money across borders like it‚Äôs part of the daily commute. Whether it‚Äôs sending AED back to Manila or flipping a few grand into stablecoins before a market move, the demand is relentless. People want speed. Certainty. No drama.

# No signup? No problem.

This is where BitLoga hits the mark. No hoops. No ‚Äúcreate an account‚Äù walls. Just straight-up, **fast and private exchange**, right when you need it. That kind of frictionless design? It‚Äôs not a bonus anymore ‚Äî it‚Äôs what users assume should *already* exist. Anything slower feels like dial-up internet in a 5G world.

# Stablecoins: The unsung heroes of the Gulf

Everyone talks Bitcoin. But here? It‚Äôs the **stablecoins** ‚Äî think USDT, USDC ‚Äî quietly taking over. Pegged, predictable, and perfect for instant swaps. And the kicker? BitLoga makes getting your hands on them feel almost... boringly easy. Which, let‚Äôs be honest, is exactly how money movement *should* feel.

So yeah ‚Äî this boom in 24/7 exchangers? It‚Äôs not hype. It‚Äôs the new financial infrastructure for a city that refuses to shut down. Dubai‚Äôs heartbeat doesn‚Äôt skip ‚Äî and neither does BitLoga.",5,1752480425.0,BitLoga,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **The WTA Italian Open Showdown: Kathinka Von Deichmann vs. Ekaterine Gorgodze ‚Äì A Clash of Resilience and Precision**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a tennis spectacle that‚Äôs as much about grit as it is about grace. On **July 14, 2025**, the WTA Italian Open will witness a fascinating final: **Kathinka Von Deichmann (LIE)**, the Swiss-Liechtensteiner enigma with a first serve faster than her country‚Äôs internet, faces off against **Ekaterine Gorgodze (GEO)**, the Georgian firecracker whose forehand could double as a flamethrower. Let‚Äôs dissect this matchup with the precision of a line judge and the flair of a poet who‚Äôs never met a metaphor they didn‚Äôt overuse.

---

### Contextualizing the Matchup: A Tale of Two Tenacity

First, let‚Äôs set the scene. Von Deichmann, the 23-year-old seed in this tournament, is the kind of player who makes you wonder if ‚Äúdefensive wizardry‚Äù is an official category in the WTA rulebook. Her recent 125K victory over Angelica Raggi (ITA) ‚Äî a three-set thriller (4-6, 6-0, 6-3) ‚Äî showcased her ability to dig deep, like a Liechtensteiner alpine hiker who‚Äôs forgotten the summit is a metaphor. Meanwhile, Gorgodze, the 28-year-old Georgian veteran, has been a storm in the 125K qualifiers, dismantling Anastasia Abbagnato (ITA) 6-1, 6-1 with the precision of a GPS-guided backhand.

Their rivalry? Non-existent. Their styles? Polar opposites. Von Deichmann is the Swiss Army knife of tennis ‚Äî versatile, unflappable, and occasionally prone to rust if the sun shines too long. Gorgodze? She‚Äôs the sledgehammer. Big serves, big hitters, and a game plan that screams, ‚ÄúWhy settle for a rally when you can end it in one shot?‚Äù

---

### Key Data Points: Numbers That Make You Go ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶‚Äù

Let‚Äôs get statistical, but with a side of whimsy.

1. **Von Deichmann‚Äôs Recent Form**: In her 125K final, she lost the first set but roared back with a 6-0 second set ‚Äî the kind of comeback that makes you check if your coffee‚Äôs still hot. Her third-set 6-3 suggests she‚Äôs a late-blooming rose, or as her coach might say, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs like a Swiss chocolate ‚Äî best after aging.‚Äù
   * *Stat of Note*: Von Deichmann‚Äôs **first-serve percentage** in the 125K was 68%, per the *2024 WTA Serve Analysis Report*. Not elite, but enough to keep Raggi guessing.
2. **Gorgodze‚Äôs Dominance**: Her 6-1, 6-1 dismantling of Abbagnato was so clinical, it made the Italian linesperson question their life choices. Gorgodze‚Äôs **ace rate**? A blistering 14 aces in two sets ‚Äî roughly the same number of people who‚Äôve successfully defended a WTA 125K title this year.
3. **Head-to-Head (What We Know)**: These two haven‚Äôt met before, but Gorgodze‚Äôs career win rate against top-50 players (58%) vs. Von Deichmann‚Äôs (42%) gives us a hint: the

##‚Å§ Key Features Analysis

The best wheelchair cup holders offer a combination of stability, convenience, and durability. We've selected models based on their outstanding features.

**adjustable Clamps:**

Adjustable clamps are crucial for‚Å¢ ensuring a secure fit on various wheelchair frames. ‚ÄãThe ideal cup holder will ‚Äåaccommodate a wide range of frame diameters,‚Äç typically from‚Äã 0.5 inches to 1.5 inches. This‚Å£ feature allows the cup holder to be ‚Äçeasily attached to different parts of the wheelchair,‚Å§ such as the armrest, frame, or push handles. Furthermore, high-quality ‚Äåclamps feature non-slip ‚Äãmaterials‚Å¢ or rubber padding to prevent ‚Äãscratching and provide extra grip. The adjustability also extends to the angle of the cup holder,allowing users to customize the position for optimal accessibility.

**Global Compatibility:**

Universal‚Å£ compatibility means the cup holder is designed to work with most standard wheelchairs, power wheelchairs, walkers, rollators, and transport chairs. This is achieved through a versatile mounting system ‚Äãthat can adapt to different frame shapes and sizes. cup holders with swivel capabilities ‚Äçfurther enhance universal compatibility by allowing the holder‚Äç to‚Å§ be rotated to ‚Äåavoid obstructions or to position‚Äã it for ‚Å£easier access. Cup holders suitable for various container sizes are‚Å¢ also essential, ranging from standard water bottles to larger‚Å§ insulated ‚Äãcups or even small food containers.

**Durable Construction:**

The durability of a wheelchair cup ‚Äåholder is paramount, ‚Äåas it must withstand daily use and potential impacts. High-quality cup holders are typically constructed from robust materials such as ABS plastic, stainless steel, or aluminum alloy.

**Easy Installation & Removal:**

Ease of installation and removal is a key consideration for users who may ‚Å¢need to‚Äç frequently adjust or transfer the cup holder‚Å£ to different mobility devices. The best cup holders feature tool-free installation,using simple clamp mechanisms or ‚Äåquick-release ‚Äçlevers. This allows for effortless attachment ‚Å¢and detachment without the need for specialized tools‚Å¢ or assistance. The clamp should be easily tightened and loosened to ensure a ‚Äãsecure fit and ‚Äãprevent slippage during use. ‚Å¢A simple yet reliable installation process‚Äç enhances user convenience and promotes ‚Å¢greater independence.

**Secure Grip Design:**

A secure grip design ensures that beverages of various sizes remain stable and prevent spills even when navigating uneven surfaces. The cup holder should ‚Å¢feature interior grips or flexible‚Äç holding‚Äã arms that conform to the shape of the container.These grips prevent the container from rattling or shifting during movement, reducing‚Å£ the‚Äã risk of accidents. Some advanced models even incorporate shock-absorbing materials or designs to further minimize ‚Äãthe impact of vibrations ‚Äãand bumps. A secure grip‚Å¢ design enhances safety and provides‚Å§ peace of mind, especially for‚Å¢ users with limited dexterity.

**Enhanced Safety:** Preventing spills reduces the risk of accidents and injuries.

# Why I built it

I work from a shared studio and wanted proof if someone touched my Mac while I grabbed coffee. Existing ‚Äúwebcam recorders‚Äù either streamed to third-party clouds or drained the battery. So I focused on staying¬†**100% offline**, and added a feature I haven‚Äôt seen elsewhere, which is:

# Surveillance Mode

* **Arms itself only when you lock the screen**.
* Records at the highest resolution your camera supports (up to 4 K).
* Disarms automatically when you unlock, so it never records while you‚Äôre at the keyboard.
* If your primary camera disconnects, it falls back to any available webcam.

# Other bits you might like

* Adjustable motion sensitivity & recording length (10s ‚Äì 1 min).
* Optional¬†**Launch at Login**¬†for 24/7 set-and-forget.
* Saves clips to a ‚ÄúSpyCam‚Äù album in Photos ‚Üí they sync via iCloud Photos, so you can review footage on your iPhone without ever touching a third-party server.
* Runs native on Apple Silicon¬†**and**¬†Intel; idle CPU usage hovers around 2‚Äì3 %.
* Menu-bar control, optional hidden Dock icon, multilingual UI.

# Privacy first

1lzgih2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/1lzgih2/right_way_to_handle_these_situations_with_an/,Right way to handle these situations with an inconsiderate housemate.,"Can I get some guidance please. I'm autistic and living in a less-than-ideal situation currently. Having fled a domestic abuse situation, I am living in a refuge currently where I share an apartment with one other woman and her child.

She's... quite frankly grubby, gross and inconsiderate about her housekeeping. On a few specific situations I have asked and reminded her repeatedly since I arrived 6 weeks ago. I'm very careful to immediately clean up my messes so things are ready for me to use again and because it's inconsiderate and rude to leave shared spaces  in a state where the other person has to clean someone else's mess to be able to cook/bathe/exist in the space.

These are things like... leaving food mess all over the kitchen and walking away and leaving it (bear in mind I always leave it clean so she is taking a space someone else has cleaned and every time they use the kitchen, its left in a mess). Piling up dishes in the sink rather than just washing them. I have an infant so need to be able to wash her bottles frequently etc and need an empty sink to do so. Leaving open food containers (the rules are that all items have to be in our cupboards or the fridge etc) like butter, jams, bread, cereals etc all open and spills everywhere. Not flushing the toilet, not cleaning up her kids toilet skid marks, leaving the bath full of used water and/or not washing or rinsing after use. When she does clean, she uses my cleaning supplies. I just bought fairy liquid on Friday morning, was away Fri and Sat nights and when I got back at midday yesterday its all gone and I had to go replace it before I could wash baby bottles. She leaves her washing in the machine constantly. Not once have I taken washing down to be done and found the machine free to use.

Now with each of these things I have asked her and reminded her again and again. I've asked she leave her dishes piled next to the sink if she isn't washing them straight away, because I shouldn't be having to wash her stuff just to be able to do my own or wash bottles. I've asked her to clean up the kitchen sides after using it so that I don't have to clean her mess before I can cook. I've been asking her to empty the washing machine so I can use it each time. I've asked her each time I have needed to bathe or shower to empty the bath and rinse it, or rinse it if she has (rarely) actually emptied it. She uses self tan a lot so it leaves visual, muddy looking marks everywhere if not rinsed. I've handed her toilet cleaner and asked her to address her sons skid marks when it's been left. I've explained I dont mind her using my cleaning stuff and it being considered communal but that she needs to be buying it half the time if doing so. Ive said she can use the plastic plates and cuttlery sets I bought for my daughter for her son but to make sure she is cleaning them and not hoarding them in her room etc.

Nothing is changing and I'm getting fed up with it. So I have started changing how I handle these things. If she leaves the sink full, I pull out and pile up her dishes and then wash what I need to. I move all the stuff she leaves out over the kitchen into a pile to one side so I can clean it. When she leaves stiff everywhere and I need to clean, I am making a pile of their belongings (nothing personal is allowed to be out in the shared spaces) and putting it outside her door so I can hoover/mop/dust etc. I've started keeping my cleaning supplies in my cupboard. I've moved my daughters utensils into my cupboard. When I need to use the washing machine I take her wet washing and place it on the coffee table for her to address and then use it rather than waiting for her to appear and get round to emptying it after being asked.

The attitude I am now getting is wild. She's stamping around when I have put her washing out for her to address or slamming cupboards when I have left her dishes in a pile to do. She's huffing when she leaves her room and finds a pile of her belongings outside her door etc and the attitude is making me think I am handling this wrong... but I have tried asking and explained the impact her leaving stuff has repeatedly and she says she will do things differently but nothing has improved. So I have a choice between letting myself be walked over because she cant be bothered to be clean and her thinking I will do it if left... or changing how I manage it so I am not a doormat and now I am not at all sure I am doing the right thing. 

Are the things I am doing rude given the context?

1. How to Not Be a Social Media NPC  
Stop believing everything you see online.
  - If a TikTok ""guru"" says ""doctors hate this trick,"" they're full of shit.  
  - Memes are funny, but they‚Äôre not research papers.  

- Don‚Äôt argue with idiots.  
  - You won‚Äôt convince a flat-earther. You‚Äôll just lose brain cells.  

- Oversharing = future regret.  
  - Posting your breakfast? Fine. Posting your home address? Congrats, you‚Äôre now a target.

2. How to Not Suck With Money 
- If someone promises ""easy money,"" they‚Äôre scamming you.  
  - No, you won‚Äôt get rich from dropshipping, crypto pumps, or ""passive income"" courses.  

- Debt is a trap. Don‚Äôt fall in.  
  - Taking a loan for a new iPhone? Cool, now you‚Äôre poor *and* basic.  

- Save something. Anything.  
  - 10% of your paycheck = ""oh shit"" fund. No savings = eating ramen when life kicks you.  



3. How to Not Ruin Relationships  
- Don‚Äôt text drunk. 
  - You‚Äôll wake up to a cringe festival in your DMs.  

- You can‚Äôt fix people.  
  - If they‚Äôre toxic, walk away. ""Potential"" is a myth.  

- Lying to ""spare feelings"" backfires.  
  - The truth comes out eventually‚Äîjust with more drama.  



4. How to Not Destroy Your Health 
- Sleep > hustle culture. 
  - 5 hours of sleep = zombie mode. No amount of coffee fixes that.  

- Food isn‚Äôt therapy. 
  - Stress-eating leads to hating your reflection.  

- Move or decay.
  - 30-min walk daily > gym selfies with zero effort.  



5. How to Not Hate Your Life 
- Comparison is a joy-killer.  
  - Someone‚Äôs ""overnight success"" took 10 years. Focus on your race.  

- If your job sucks, plan your exit. 
  - Complaining changes nothing. Action does.  

- Start before you‚Äôre ""ready."" 
  - The ""perfect time"" doesn‚Äôt exist. Just begin.

I don‚Äôt have a medical condition besides a coffee addiction and an already overactive bladder. Besides that, I‚Äôm a fully functioning human. I work a somewhat standard job which doesn‚Äôt require long hours without a bathroom. I could go pretty much whenever I want. Which is why I started wearing them in the first place; the constant need to stop what I‚Äôm doing every 30 minutes really frustrated me.

Here‚Äôs how it started.

I looked into solutions. I could deal with using the bathroom at home, but doing it so much at work prevented me from entering my ‚Äúflow,‚Äù as my job is pretty mindless. There‚Äôs obviously medicine I could take but I hated thinking about the side effects, and it would affect me all the time. The thought of diapers had occurred to me but I never took it seriously. In July of last year I said fuck it and tried it. I live on my own and don‚Äôt have many friends so it‚Äôs not something I need to hide except when I‚Äôm in public (I have my own space at work).

I was surprised that it not only held everything, but really helped alleviate my stress of always having to get up. I got used to wearing them at work within a week.

Of course it didn‚Äôt stop there. It was so convenient that I started wearing them outside of work. Not in my house (yet), but when I went shopping or just running errands. This continued until October when I had my first real accident. Up until then, I had only been peeing in them, and had only been using them outside of the house. I could feel my bladder weakening but I kept telling myself that if I wanted to, I could stop whenever.

Nope.

Thankfully it was in my own house, but I had a real accident while on my computer. I knew it was happening when it started, I really just forgot I wasn‚Äôt wearing a diaper. Once I realized what was happening, I couldn‚Äôt stop it. I pee often enough that it wasn‚Äôt a huge flood, but it was definitely enough to warrant some clean up.

I could have realized what would happen if I started wearing them all the time. Deep down I knew, but I kept telling myself I‚Äôd be fine. I‚Äôm sure you can guess the rest. But it doesn‚Äôt stop there.

After I switched to 24/7, I started using them, occasionally, for number 2. Same story; it became so convenient that I just started doing it all the time. I‚Äôm just fucking lazy. And now I‚Äôm completely dependent on them, and probably will be the rest of my life.",0,1752479223.0,10thDentist,5,0.33,False

## key Features Analysis

The modern round outdoor coffee table boasts a range of features designed to withstand the elements while providing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

**Material Durability:** the longevity of an outdoor coffee table hinges on the materials used in its construction. Many high-quality tables now feature powder-coated aluminum frames. This provides excellent rust resistance and structural integrity. tabletops often incorporate materials like tempered glass, which is shatter-resistant and easy to clean, or sustainably sourced teak wood, known for its natural weather resistance and lovely grain. All-weather wicker is another popular option, offering a classic look and superior resistance to moisture and fading.

**Size and Dimensions:** Choosing the right size is crucial for maximizing space and functionality. Round outdoor coffee tables typically range from 30 inches to 48 inches in diameter. A smaller table,around 30-36 inches,is ideal for smaller patios or balconies,providing enough surface area for drinks and snacks without overwhelming the space. Larger tables, 40-48 inches, are better suited for larger seating arrangements, offering ample space for serving dishes or displaying decorative items. The height should also be considered; standard heights range from 16 to 20 inches, ensuring comfortable reach from most outdoor seating.

**Weather Resistance:** Outdoor furniture must be able to withstand varying weather conditions, including sun, rain, and temperature fluctuations. Look for tables with UV-resistant finishes to prevent fading and discoloration from prolonged sun exposure. Tables with rust-proof frames, such as those made from aluminum or stainless steel, are essential for preventing corrosion in humid or coastal environments. Water-resistant materials like teak wood and all-weather wicker are also excellent choices for durability. some tables may also include drainage features to prevent water from pooling on the surface.

**Design and Style:** The aesthetic appeal of an outdoor coffee table should complement your existing patio furniture and overall outdoor d√©cor. options range from sleek and modern designs with clean lines to more conventional styles with intricate detailing. Material choices, such as glass, wood, or wicker, significantly contribute to the style. Consider the color and finish of the table to ensure it harmonizes with your outdoor setting. Some tables may also feature unique design elements, such as woven patterns, interesting leg shapes, or contrasting material combinations.

Key features of the best round outdoor coffee tables in 2025 include:

* durable, weather-resistant materials like aluminum, teak, and all-weather wicker
* A variety of sizes to suit different patio and deck spaces

## FAQs Section

**What is the ideal size for a round outdoor coffee table?**
The ideal size depends on the size of your seating area and the number of people you typically entertain. For smaller patios or balconies, a table with a diameter of 30-36 inches is usually sufficient. Larger patios can accommodate tables with diameters of 40-48 inches. Consider the distance between the seating and the table to ensure comfortable reach.

**How do I protect my outdoor coffee table from the elements?**
To protect your outdoor coffee table from the elements, consider using a furniture cover when it's not in use. Regularly clean the table with a mild soap and water solution to remove dirt and debris. For wooden tables, apply a sealant or oil periodically to maintain the wood's natural moisture and prevent cracking. Avoid placing hot items directly on the surface, and use coasters to protect against spills.

**What materials are best for outdoor coffee tables in coastal environments?**
In coastal environments, it's essential to choose materials that are resistant to salt air and humidity. Aluminum and stainless steel frames are excellent choices for rust resistance. Teak wood is naturally weather-resistant and holds up well in coastal conditions. All-weather wicker is also a durable option that can withstand moisture and fading. Avoid materials that are prone to rust or corrosion, such as iron or steel without a protective coating.

""Mr. Cross, I just sent you a copy of the divorce agreement. My husband and I signed it on our wedding day. Could you take a look and let me know if there's anything I should be concerned about?""



Eleanor Robinson stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, absentmindedly running her fingers along the edge of her phone.



""I've reviewed the document, Ms. Robinson. Everything appears to be in order,"" Leo Cross replied, his voice calm and professional.



He continued, ""There's still one month left on the three-year term. Once that expires, the agreement will take effect immediately. At that point, you'll just need to head to the courthouse to finalize the divorce.""



""Alright. I appreciate it.""



After hanging up, Eleanor lifted her gaze to the wedding portrait on the wall.



She wore a white gown, smiling so brightly that it lit up her entire face. Dominic Bennett stood beside her, impeccably dressed and effortlessly handsome. Yet, not even the faintest hint of a smile touched his lips.



The truth was plain to see. She loved him, and he couldn't have cared less.



Eleanor gently traced the photo, her fingers brushing the hard line of Dominic's indifferent expression. Under her breath, she muttered, ""The day's almost here. You must be thrilled, huh?""



At that moment, the sound of the door unlocking pulled her back to reality. She quickly dropped her hand and turned toward the entryway, saying, ""You're home.""



She took Dominic's coat as he shrugged it off before crouching down to switch out his shoes for slippers. Every movement was fluid and practiced, like it had become second nature.



Dominic loosened his tie, then said coolly, ""Bennett Group will be holding its anniversary gala next month. I need you to be there.""



Eleanor paused, still holding his coat. A beat later, she shook her head. ""I can't.""



""Why not?"" he asked with a frown.



She was about to respond when his gaze turned sharp. It was as if he had suddenly figured it out.



""Is this because I've been spending time with Ashley? I told you I was in love with someone else on the day we got married. And you agreed you wouldn't get in the way.""



A jolt of pain tore through Eleanor's chest, like someone had ripped her open from the inside.



She had never imagined her husband would confess that he was in love with someone else on their wedding night. As if that weren't enough, he handed her a signed divorce agreement set to take effect three years later.



Eleanor was simply holding up her end of the deal. By next month, she'd be gone, so of course she couldn't attend the gala.



Three years earlier, Robinson Corporation and Bennett Group announced a marriage alliance between the two families.



Eleanor had nursed a quiet crush on Dominic for years. So, when she learned she was going to marry him, she was overjoyed.



But on their wedding night, he handed her a divorce agreement.



""I'm in love with someone else. Since she comes from a modest background, my family would never accept her."" Dominic had said it flatly and without hesitation.



Then, he continued, ""Give me three years. Once I become the head of the Bennett family, no one will be able to object. Until then, we pretend to be husband and wife. After that, we'll go our separate ways.""



That night, Eleanor signed the papers just as he asked. Later, she locked herself in the bathroom and cried until morning.



‚Ä¶



Barely three months into their marriage, Ashley Lowell vanished after a fight with Dominic. He lost his mind trying to find her, pulling every string he could. But in the end, there was still no trace of her.



During that time, Dominic didn't come for days. And when he did, he was usually drunk, his eyes dark and hollow.



Then one night, he came stumbling through the door. The next moment, he pushed Eleanor down onto the bed.



His breath reeked of alcohol as his lips found hers. However, he slurred, ""Ashley‚Ä¶ Why did you leave? Why would you be with someone else? Don't you believe me?""



Eleanor froze. A sharp ache gripped her chest, making it hard to draw air.



As it turned out, Dominic had found Ashley. Unfortunately for him, she had already moved on to someone else.



That same night, Eleanor gave herself to him. But as he held her close, he called out another woman's name again and again.



When Dominic woke up the next morning and saw the bloodstains on the sheets, he looked stunned. Still, he said nothing.



Eleanor acted like nothing had happened either. She laid out fresh clothes for him and reminded him of his meetings.



Outwardly, she held it together, while inside, she was falling apart.



From then on, she only tried harder to take care of Dominic.



Eleanor knew his stomach couldn't handle much, so she got up early each morning to make something gentle. She understood how much pressure he was under, so she learned how to give massages to ease his tension.



She knew he valued silence, so she never raised her voice. Even in her own home, she moved quietly, always mindful of her steps.



Gradually, Dominic began to treat her like a real wife.



When he returned from business trips, he'd bring back small gifts. When she had a cold, he made her tea. At night, he'd pull her into his arms, his palm resting warm against her waist.



He never mentioned the divorce again. It was as if that agreement had never existed.



Eleanor, on the other hand, foolishly began to believe that maybe Dominic might fall in love with her after all.



But then, Ashley came back three months ago, freshly out of a breakup.



Dominic dropped everything to be with her. He took her out for meals, went shopping by her side, and even canceled important meetings just because she said she was feeling down.



One day, Eleanor stood by the window and watched as Dominic's car pulled away. He was headed to Ashley's apartment again.



That was when she understood‚Äîtrue love didn't need proof. She could give him everything she had, and it would still never measure up to a single glance from Ashley.



Thankfully, the three-year marriage contract was almost up. Eleanor told herself it had all just been a dream.



And now, she was finally waking up. It was time to go.



‚Ä¶



""Why aren't you saying anything?""



Dominic's voice snapped Eleanor out of her thoughts.



She stared blankly at him, her throat tightening. Had he forgotten about the divorce agreement?



For the past three years, she had counted down every day. She was terrified that when the time came, he'd walk away without a second thought.



But now, it seemed like he didn't remember at all.



Just as she was about to remind him, his phone rang.



The moment Dominic picked up, Eleanor could hear Ashley crying on the other end. She couldn't make out the words, but she saw the color drain from his face.



""Don't be scared. I'm on my way,"" he reassured Ashley.



Having said that, he hung up, grabbed his keys, and bolted for the door.



In his haste, Dominic's shoulder slammed into Eleanor, sending her stumbling backward. Her back slammed into the doorframe, and she winced.



Even so, he didn't glance back. He was already gone.



Eleanor steadied herself against the wall and slowly made her way to the bedroom. When she removed her sweater, she saw the bruise already forming.



She retrieved the first aid kit before applying ointment in silence. All the while, her chest ached as though something were being hollowed out from the inside.



Then, she sat on the edge of the bed, gazing out the window as dusk crept in.



At that moment, her phone buzzed. It was Dominic.



""Come to Downtown General Hospital,"" he instructed.



Eleanor's heart skipped a beat. She blurted, ""What happened?""



""I'll explain when you get here.""



‚Ä¶



By the time Eleanor arrived at the hospital, she spotted Dominic outside the operating room. He held Ashley close as she sobbed uncontrollably.



Eleanor stopped in her tracks. The sight of them together was enough to knock the breath from her.



""What happened?"" she asked softly as she approached them.



Dominic looked up and replied, ""Ashley's mom was just diagnosed with acute leukemia. She needs a bone marrow transplant immediately.""



Eleanor blinked. ""And?""



""We searched the registry, but there are no matches,"" he said lightly. ""I just got tested. I'm a match.""



Eleanor stared at him in disbelief. ""You're going to donate? But there are risks. You‚Äî""



""I didn't call you to ask permission,"" Dominic cut in. ""They need a family member's signature to proceed.""



The word hit Eleanor like a blow. Legally, she was still his wife. But in his eyes, she had never been family.



She clenched her fists so tightly that her nails dug into her palms. Finally, she managed to say, ""Alright. I'll sign.""



With that, a nurse handed her the consent form. She wrote her name slowly, each stroke landing like a weight in her chest.



Once that was done, Dominic released Ashley and walked toward the operating room.



Just before the doors closed, Eleanor called out, ""Dominic!""



He turned, but his eyes gave nothing away.



A tremor passed through Eleanor's lips. After a pause, she simply said, ""Be careful.""



Something flickered in Dominic's eyes. Yet, he said nothing and stepped through the doors.



The moment the doors clicked shut, tears finally streamed down Eleanor's cheeks. That was when she understood that Dominic's love for Ashley ran so deep that he would've given her everything‚Äîeven his life.



Chapter 2



The red light above the operating room doors stayed lit. The hallway was silent, save for the sound of breathing.



Eleanor sat on the bench, her hands numb with cold.



Across from her, Ashley's eyes were rimmed with red. Every so often, she glanced toward the operating room doors.



Finally, she spoke, her voice barely above a whisper. ""I'm so sorry, Ms. Robinson. I never meant to bring more trouble to you both.""



Eleanor looked up at her but said nothing.



Ashley wiped at her tears, her voice choking with emotion as she added, ""I never thought Dominic would still care this deeply after all these years.""



Then, she paused, as though drifting into a memory.



""Last year, on my birthday, he flew all the way to Peressa just to bring me a necklace. It was one I had mentioned once in passing, something I said I liked.



""I couldn't believe he remembered. But I was still angry at him, so I threw the necklace at him and wouldn't even let him in.""



At that, Eleanor's fingers curled into fists, her nails biting into her palms.



She remembered it clearly. Dominic had told her he'd be out of town for a few days on a business trip. When he came back, he had casually handed her a necklace.



Eleanor had been overjoyed. She kept it tucked away at the bottom of her jewelry box and couldn't even bring herself to wear it.



But now she knew. The necklace was something Ashley had rejected, and he had simply handed it off to her.



Ashley went on, ""The Christmas before that, I got into a terrible fight with my boyfriend at the time. I posted something dark on Instagram. Dominic saw it and flew over that same night.



""He stood outside my apartment for hours. It was snowing hard, but he never moved. He didn't even try to knock.""



Eleanor's chest tightened. She remembered that Christmas, too.



Dominic had been unusually passionate that night and made love to her seven times. She had believed he was finally falling in love with her.



The next morning, she woke up alone. In fact, the space beside her had long gone cold. Still, she assumed he had left to handle some urgent work.



But the truth was, he had rushed off to see Ashley.



At that moment, Ashley's tears fell again. ""I was angry for three years and refused to reach out. But Dominic never forgot me. He wrote me a letter every single day, even though I never replied.""



Suddenly, Eleanor couldn't breathe.



She remembered all the nights she saw the light still on in Dominic's office. She had thought he was working late and even made coffee to help him stay awake.



All the while, he had been writing love letters to Ashley.



She had let herself believe that while Ashley was gone, Dominic truly wanted a life with her. Now, she realized it was just an illusion she had clung to.



Eleanor had convinced herself that he was finally letting her in. But all along, his heart had been somewhere else.



Just as Ashley looked ready to speak again, Eleanor stood abruptly.



Her face had turned pale by then. Even so, she kept her voice steady. ""I have to go. There's something I need to take care of.""



Without waiting for a reply, she turned and walked away. Her steps grew quicker, until she was all but running.



‚Ä¶



At home, Eleanor packed her things in silence. There was nothing left to do but wait for the divorce agreement to take effect.



In the days that followed, she saw updates about Dominic through Ashley's Instagram.



His surgery was a success, but he didn't stop to rest. Instead, he immediately arranged for Ashley's mother to be moved into a private hospital room and flew in a top medical team from overseas. He even reviewed every detail of her treatment plan.



In Ashley's latest post, Dominic sat by his bed. Even with the IV still in his arm, he was carefully peeling an apple for her.



Her caption read, ""I'll never find anyone who loves me this much again.""



Pain crashed over Eleanor like a tidal wave. Before she knew it, her tears hit the screen, blurring Dominic's gentle profile in the photo.



She thought of the years she had spent taking care of Dominic.



She had made him oatmeal every morning for his sensitive stomach. At night, she kept the lights on late, waiting for him to come home. The fruit she brought him was always peeled, cored, and cut into perfect, bite-sized pieces.



And now, he was doing all that for someone else.



Eleanor took in a deep breath, wiped away her tears, and told herself, ""It's okay. Once I stop loving him, I'll finally learn to love myself.""



Chapter 3



Dominic returned home a week later. Eleanor hadn't expected to see him. As far as she was concerned, he should've been glued to Ashley's side around the clock.



""There's a family dinner tonight. Get changed,"" he said flatly.



Eleanor didn't argue. She simply changed into a formal dress and followed Dominic out the door.



‚Ä¶



The atmosphere at dinner was lively. Glasses clinked as everyone exchanged pleasantries. Eventually, the topic shifted to Eleanor and Dominic.



""You two have been married for three years now. Isn't it time for a baby?"" someone asked with a grin.



Another chimed in, ""Exactly. Dominic's the head of the family now. There needs to be an heir.""



""Eleanor, you really ought to speed things up,"" said a third.



Eleanor lowered her gaze and didn't respond, her fingertips idly tracing the rim of her glass.



Right then, Dominic, who had stayed silent until now, spoke. ""There's no rush.""



His voice wasn't loud, but it cut straight through the room.



In an instant, everyone fell quiet. Their expressions shifted, yet no one dared push further. After all, Dominic was now running the family.



Just like that, the mood turned heavy, and the rest of the meal passed in uncomfortable silence.



‚Ä¶



After dinner, Sharon Moore, Dominic's mother, rose to her feet. Her gaze landed on Eleanor, sharp and cold.



""Come with me to the study.""



Everyone at the table knew what that meant. Sharon was about to corner Eleanor about having a baby.



Dominic clearly caught on too. He frowned and said, ""If you've got something to say, say it to me.""



But before Sharon could respond, his phone rang. He glanced at the caller ID, and his expression shifted slightly.



Without another word, he stepped away to take the call. His voice softened as he answered. ""Ashley? What's going on?""



Sharon let out a scoff at that sight. Then, she turned to Eleanor, snapping, ""Come with me!""



Eleanor pressed her lips together and quietly followed.



Once the study door shut, Sharon's expression darkened.



""Sit,"" she ordered.



Eleanor slowly settled into a chair, the marble beneath her heels cold.



""Do you even know what you've done?"" Sharon asked, looking at her with clear disdain.



Eleanor, however, kept her head down and said nothing.



Suddenly, Sharon slammed her hand against the desk. ""You just sat there while Dominic told everyone he wasn't ready for kids. You should've corrected him!""



Then, she yanked open a drawer, pulled out a bottle of pills, and banged it on the desk. ""These are fertility supplements. You'll start taking them today. And you'll sleep with Dominic every night until you're pregnant.""



In the past, Eleanor would've accepted it without question. But this time, she lifted her head. Her voice was soft but steady as she replied, ""I'm not taking them.""



""What did you say?"" Sharon narrowed her eyes.



""I'm not taking them. Dominic doesn't want a child right now, and I'm respecting that.""



All these years, Dominic had made sure to take precautions. Even when things got out of hand, he always made sure Eleanor took the morning-after pill.



She used to think he just wasn't ready. Now, she realized he had never intended to have children with her.



And since she had already decided to leave, she wasn't going to tether herself to him with a baby.



Sharon's voice rose sharply. ""Excuse me?""



""I said I'm not taking them,"" Eleanor repeated.



Sharon trembled with rage as she yelled, ""How dare you! You're his wife, and you refuse to do your part? He donated bone marrow to Ashley's mother, but you didn't even try to stop him!""



In the next second, she barked, ""Bring me the belt!""



Soon, the household staff appeared with a thick leather strap in her hand.



Sharon snatched it from her without hesitation. ""I'm going to ask you one last time. Will you take the supplements?""



Eleanor shook her head in response.



Without warning, Sharon brought the belt down across Eleanor's back.



The first strike landed hard, a searing pain ripping through her and radiating down to her limbs. She clenched her jaw as cold sweat broke out across her skin.



""Will you take the pills?"" Sharon asked again.



Eleanor gritted her teeth and shook her head once more. And so, the belt came down again and again.



Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, she caught sight of Dominic in the garden. He was still on the phone, and he stood with his back to the study.



His posture was loose, easy. Now and then, he let out a soft chuckle. Clearly, he was enjoying whatever Ashley was saying.



Chapter 4



""If that's how it is, then I'll beat some sense into you until you learn what it means to be a real wife!"" Sharon shouted.



The belt tore through Eleanor's shirt, leaving streaks of blood across her back. She trembled from the pain, yet she refused to give in.



""I-I won't take the pills‚Ä¶"" she stammered.



By then, blood had soaked through her clothes, and her vision began to blur. The last thing she saw was Dominic's back, still on the phone.



As darkness closed in around her, Eleanor thought that maybe this was for the best. One final pain, and she would never hurt because of him again.



‚Ä¶



When Eleanor regained consciousness, she found herself lying in a hospital bed.



A moment later, she heard the hospital director speaking in a respectful tone. ""Mr. Bennett, the marks on Mrs. Bennett are quite severe. Some have gone deep into the dermis.""



""Use the best medicine,"" Dominic replied, his voice low and cold. ""Get the best doctors, too. I don't want her left with any scars.""



""Yes, Mr. Bennett. We'll do everything we can.""



After the director left, Dominic turned. That was when he finally saw that Eleanor was awake.



He rushed to her side, frowning. ""How are you feeling?""



Eleanor tried to move, but the pain across her back flared like fire. Still, she stayed composed. ""I'm fine. The nurses here can take care of me. If you've got things to do, go ahead.""



To her surprise, Dominic didn't leave. Instead, he sat beside her. His expression was unreadable as he asked, ""My mom gave you a hard time. Why didn't you call me?""



She thought of how his back had been turned and how he had been so focused on talking to Ashley. The memory made her let out a bitter chuckle.



""Well, you looked busy."" After a pause, Eleanor asked softly, ""If I had called, would you really have come right away?""



""Of course,"" Dominic answered without hesitation.



She stilled. That wasn't the answer she had expected.



""I've already handled things with the family,"" he added. ""No one's going to pressure you about having a child anymore.""



Eleanor lowered her gaze, then replied, ""Okay. You should go now.""



""Why do you keep trying to send me away?"" Dominic shot back, his brow furrowing.



His response took her by surprise. ""Aren't you busy?""



After all, he was always tied up with work and Ashley.



""Not lately."" Dominic reached over and pulled the blanket up around her. ""I can take care of you for the next few days.""



That caught her completely off guard.



‚Ä¶



True to his word, Dominic stayed at the hospital to care for Eleanor over the next few days. He adjusted her bed, fed her, and even changed her bandages himself.



One night, when the pain kept her from sleeping, he sat by her bed and gently patted her back. He stayed that way until she finally drifted off.



His tenderness brought back memories of the closeness they used to share. But Eleanor wouldn't let herself fall for it again.



She had already made up her mind to leave, and there was no going back.



‚Ä¶



A week later, the marks on Eleanor's back had faded significantly.



That day, as Dominic applied ointment, she let out a soft gasp without meaning to. Almost immediately, his hand froze mid-motion.



Puzzled, Eleanor turned, only to meet his intense gaze. His Adam's apple bobbed, and below his waist‚Ä¶



Her expression shifted slightly. However, Dominic was already leaning in, his breathing growing heavier with each passing second.



Just as his lips were about to meet hers, a sharp sound broke the tension.



They both turned to see Ashley standing in the doorway. The fruit basket had slipped from her hands, and fruit rolled across the floor.

Alpha Kael Creed‚Äôs hand sliced through the air like a blade. And then a sharp crack echoed through the room.

# Full Read Link¬†[https://writers.techfullguide.com/broke-by-alpha-1/](https://writers.techfullguide.com/broke-by-alpha-1/)

My head snapped to the side. A metallic taste flooded my mouth, and a ringing noise exploded in my ears like a swarm of bees trapped in my skull.

I stumbled, catching myself on the edge of the desk, my fingers trembling.

My left cheek went numb before it began to burn‚Äîhot, sharp, humiliating.

When I looked up, Kael‚Äôs hand was still hanging midair, his knuckles bone-white with tension.

My mate. My fianc√©. And now the man who‚Äôd just struck me in front of everyone‚Äîto defend his precious Beta‚ÄîRiley.

For a brief second, Kael‚Äôs expression faltered. A flicker of guilt. But it vanished, swallowed by rage and impatience.

‚ÄúTalia, can you stop making a scene for once?‚Äù

Someone snorted. A few others chuckled under their breath. No one stepped in.

Riley stood beside him, chestnut curls catching the light like strands of honey. Her red lips curled into a lazy, mocking smile.

‚ÄúKael, don‚Äôt be so harsh. Look‚Äîyou‚Äôve scared your little mate. Poor thing‚Äôs about to cry.‚Äù

Kael‚Äôs jaw tightened, his eyes still smoldering, but he reined in his tone, voice sharp yet measured. ‚ÄúTalia, this is Ashveil Pack, not Silverclaw. Try to remember where you are.‚Äù

The room buzzed with murmurs and half-stifled laughter.

I touched the corner of my mouth. It came away wet, though I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was blood or tears.

Eighteen years of knowing this man. I‚Äôd seen every side of his temper‚Äîbut I never knew a slap could sting this bad.

Humiliation, rage, and heartbreak twisted together like barbed wire in my chest.

I dug my nails into my palms, swallowing the scream lodged in my throat.

Kael started to say something else, but I didn‚Äôt care anymore.

I turned on my heel, grabbed my bag, and shoved the glass doors open.

Behind me, someone let out a sharp whistle. ‚ÄúLook at her run. She waddles like a damn penguin!‚Äù

I had no idea where I was going‚ÄîI just knew I couldn‚Äôt stay here.

I couldn‚Äôt stand one more minute in Ashveil Pack. Not with those eyes on me. Not with that handprint burning on my face.

Sure, Kael never had much patience with me. But he‚Äôd never hit me before.

This wasn‚Äôt just a slap. It was the first time in my life someone had ever struck me.

Not even when my world first fell apart at six years old.

Back then, Silverclaw Pack was attacked, and my parents moved us into the Ashveil Pack for safety.

That‚Äôs when I first saw Kael.

He was sitting in the yard, playing with a toy truck. Sunlight streamed down, stretching his shadow long across the ground until it brushed the tips of my shoes.

We grew up next door to each other.

My mom used to say we were like two saplings growing side by side. Only‚Ä¶ Kael grew faster. Stronger.

When we were in grade school, a boy named Tommy stuck a wad of chewed-up gum in my ponytail.

The class burst into laughter.

The teacher tried to smooth it over. ‚ÄúHe just likes you, sweetheart. Boys tease girls they like. Don‚Äôt cry.‚Äù

Those words stung worse than the gum.

After school, I cried all the way home.

Kael‚Äôs father, David Creed, heard what happened. He called out to his son, who was doing homework on the floor.

‚ÄúKael. Tomorrow. Go have a word with Tommy in second grade.‚Äù

The next day, Kael stormed into my classroom and kicked the back door open.

He moved like a wild little beast, charging Tommy with his tiny fists clenched. He slammed a fist on the boy‚Äôs desk.

‚ÄúListen up,‚Äù he growled, grabbing Tommy by the collar‚Äîstill speaking in that soft, childish voice. ‚ÄúTalia‚Äôs my little sister. If you ever mess with her again, I‚Äôll end you.‚Äù

Before leaving, he patted my head.

And from that moment on, I became Kael‚Äôs shadow.

Chapter 2

Back in middle school, Kael would always hit the field after class to play soccer. His teammates would drag him off for ice cream, and I‚Äôd squat on the sidelines with my backpack, waiting so long that my stomach would start growling.

He‚Äôd grumble and yank me up by the arm. ‚ÄúTalia, are you glued to me or something?‚Äù

But he‚Äôd still break his strawberry popsicle in half and give me the bigger piece.

As I remembered, he hated when people said he ""hung out with girls.""

One time I went looking for him, and his buddies started teasing, ‚ÄúLook, Kael brought his little mate!‚Äù

He got so pissed he chucked his whole bag of marbles down the storm drain.

But when I missed school the next day with a fever, he skipped class, climbed the fence, and showed up outside my window.

He tossed crumpled notes through the screen, each one scrawled with a messy little joke meant to make me laugh.

By high school, I caught him staring at me more times than I could count‚Äîwhen I was chewing on a pen while solving equations; when I tucked my hair behind my ear; even when I dozed off on my desk.

His gaze would land softly on me like the brush of a summer breeze‚Äîbarely there, but impossible to ignore.

One morning, I turned around suddenly and caught him in the act.

‚ÄúKael,‚Äù I said, locking eyes with him, ‚Äúhow do you solve this problem?‚Äù

His pen slipped right out of his hand.

Sunlight poured in through the windows, lighting up the tips of his ears until they looked like they were glowing.

‚ÄúI, uh...‚Äù He scrambled to pick up his pen, his bangs brushing my fingers. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just... I mean...‚Äù

His voice trailed off into a mumble.

I rested my chin on my hand and just watched him.

Turned out, the same boy who once punched another kid for bullying me‚Äîwould tremble just from being near me.

Outside the window, moonflower petals drifted down like snow onto his open textbook.

On the night I turned eighteen, under the glow of the full moon, our wolves finally recognized each other.

My wolf had no doubt: he‚Äôs the one. He‚Äôs our mate.

Our parents were overjoyed and immediately proposed a union between the packs.

And Kael? He pulled me into the fire escape and slammed the door behind us.

The motion-sensor lights flickered overhead. His palm was clammy, but his grip on my fingers was so tight it almost hurt.

‚ÄúThink this through,‚Äù he said hoarsely. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still young. What if... What if someone better comes along someday?‚Äù

I reached up on tiptoe and pressed my fingers over his lips.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one better than you, Kael.‚Äù

He flinched like I‚Äôd shocked him‚Äîthen kissed me like he was finally letting go of every hesitation he‚Äôd ever had.

In the dark, I touched the scar on the back of his neck‚Äîthe one he got in eighth grade, shielding me from falling debris.

That night, moonlight filtered through the iron grates, casting broken shadows over us both.

And his amber eyes shimmered like something out of a dream.

After college, I joined the Ashveil Enterprises‚Äîa company long controlled by Kael‚Äôs family, and ended up working under Kael.

Everything was perfect.

Right up until we were about to get engaged.

That‚Äôs when she showed up.

Riley.

An Omega transfer. Kael‚Äôs new Beta.

From day one, she played the sweet girl card hard‚Äîhanding out coffees with a megawatt smile.

‚ÄúNice to meet you all! I‚Äôm looking forward to working with you!‚Äù

But when she reached my desk, she froze.

‚ÄúOh my god...‚Äù she covered her mouth with a giggle. ‚ÄúAre people still using Hello Kitty thermoses?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything.

She bit her lip. ‚ÄúOops, I didn‚Äôt mean it in a bad way! I just say what‚Äôs on my mind. No offense, okay?‚Äù She leaned closer. ‚ÄúBut seriously... aren‚Äôt you a little old for all this cutesy stuff? I thought women in the workplace were supposed to be, like, elegant and put-together.‚Äù

It felt like the whole office turned to stare at me at once.

My Hello Kitty keyboard, the figurines on my desk, the pink dust covers around my monitor...

Kael used to call these things ‚ÄúTalia‚Äôs fortress.‚Äù

Now, under those judgmental eyes, they felt like a childish display begging to be laughed at.

My ears rang like someone had poured acid into my skull.

Riley's constant laugh drilled straight through me, loud and shrill, like a jackhammer cracking open the little world I‚Äôd built for myself‚Äîcute, safe, and stupidly naive.

‚ÄúGeez, relax. It‚Äôs just a joke, grandma. Don‚Äôt tell me you can‚Äôt even take a little teasing?‚Äù

My knuckles went white, fingers digging into the hem of my skirt.

‚ÄúEnough.‚Äù

Kael‚Äôs voice rang out behind me.

I turned and saw his mouth curled in a sharp, dangerous smile‚Äîhis signature tell when he was pissed.

The sun backlit him from the floor-to-ceiling windows, giving his profile a golden edge.

For a second, he looked just like the boy who once beat up a classmate for gluing gum in my hair.

Riley pouted. ‚ÄúSorry, I was just joking. You‚Äôre not really going to overreact like this, are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a coffee shop. If you want to gossip, Riley, then maybe you should quit and go start a podcast.‚Äù

She slunk back to her desk, face stiff with barely concealed rage.

Chapter 3

I don‚Äôt even know when things changed between Kael and Riley.

It was like I blinked, and suddenly‚Ä¶ the lunch our housekeeper sent over from home came with three sets of utensils.

I stared at the takeout bags, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing here I even like.‚Äù

Kael didn‚Äôt even look up from his reports.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing salads today. Riley says it‚Äôs good to cleanse the system once in a while‚Ä¶‚Äù

Riley slid into the seat next to me, holding her designer coffee like it was a prop in a rom-com.

‚ÄúOops! My bad, Talia\~‚Äù

Her manicured nails tapped on the lid, sending out a hollow rhythm.

‚ÄúI forgot you‚Äôre not into salads. But hey, grown-ups do need to eat healthy sometimes, right?‚Äù

She left the rest unsaid‚Äîbut the smug curve of her lips finished it for her.

I looked at her, my voice quiet but steady.

‚ÄúYou keep saying my name like we‚Äôre best friends or something. Newsflash‚Äîyou're older than me. Should I be calling you grandma?‚Äù

The office went dead silent.

For a second, Riley looked like I‚Äôd slapped her. Her perfectly winged eyeliner twitched.

That‚Äôs when Kael finally looked up from his desk‚Äîjust to frown at me.

‚ÄúTalia, that was uncalled for.

If you're into authentic coffee (Yung tipong ayaw mo na matulog) Try their coffee. For those naman na not really into coffee or gusto pa makatulog, you can request naman half shot lang. 

Service: Mababait naman the people there and for me they have quick service. Another thing I like KL is that clean ambiance that caf√© gives. 

Location: Villa Sta. Maria (Ric and Remy's may papasok sa side, just pasok a little bit and you'll see KL sa right side). They also have parking there but I think you can park naman sa sides if di available ang parking. ",1,1752478422.0,zamboanga,1,1.0,False

Head to Elvaston Castle this weekend for the Food & Drink Festival. Artisan stalls, street food, local ale, cider, cocktails, and enough sugar to send your step count sideways. There‚Äôs live music, kids‚Äô activities, and plenty to wander through while grabbing a bite. It‚Äôs all set in the castle grounds, so you get good food with a decent view. Easygoing crowd and more than enough to keep you happily distracted for the day.

Alpha Kael Creed‚Äôs hand sliced through the air like a blade. And then a sharp crack echoed through the room.

# Full Read Link [https://writers.techfullguide.com/broke-by-alpha-1/](https://writers.techfullguide.com/broke-by-alpha-1/)

My head snapped to the side. A metallic taste flooded my mouth, and a ringing noise exploded in my ears like a swarm of bees trapped in my skull.

I stumbled, catching myself on the edge of the desk, my fingers trembling.

My left cheek went numb before it began to burn‚Äîhot, sharp, humiliating.

When I looked up, Kael‚Äôs hand was still hanging midair, his knuckles bone-white with tension.

My mate. My fianc√©. And now the man who‚Äôd just struck me in front of everyone‚Äîto defend his precious Beta‚ÄîRiley.

For a brief second, Kael‚Äôs expression faltered. A flicker of guilt. But it vanished, swallowed by rage and impatience.

‚ÄúTalia, can you stop making a scene for once?‚Äù

Someone snorted. A few others chuckled under their breath. No one stepped in.

Riley stood beside him, chestnut curls catching the light like strands of honey. Her red lips curled into a lazy, mocking smile.

‚ÄúKael, don‚Äôt be so harsh. Look‚Äîyou‚Äôve scared your little mate. Poor thing‚Äôs about to cry.‚Äù

Kael‚Äôs jaw tightened, his eyes still smoldering, but he reined in his tone, voice sharp yet measured. ‚ÄúTalia, this is Ashveil Pack, not Silverclaw. Try to remember where you are.‚Äù

The room buzzed with murmurs and half-stifled laughter.

I touched the corner of my mouth. It came away wet, though I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was blood or tears.

Eighteen years of knowing this man. I‚Äôd seen every side of his temper‚Äîbut I never knew a slap could sting this bad.

Humiliation, rage, and heartbreak twisted together like barbed wire in my chest.

I dug my nails into my palms, swallowing the scream lodged in my throat.

Kael started to say something else, but I didn‚Äôt care anymore.

I turned on my heel, grabbed my bag, and shoved the glass doors open.

Behind me, someone let out a sharp whistle. ‚ÄúLook at her run. She waddles like a damn penguin!‚Äù

I had no idea where I was going‚ÄîI just knew I couldn‚Äôt stay here.

I couldn‚Äôt stand one more minute in Ashveil Pack. Not with those eyes on me. Not with that handprint burning on my face.

Sure, Kael never had much patience with me. But he‚Äôd never hit me before.

This wasn‚Äôt just a slap. It was the first time in my life someone had ever struck me.

Not even when my world first fell apart at six years old.

Back then, Silverclaw Pack was attacked, and my parents moved us into the Ashveil Pack for safety.

That‚Äôs when I first saw Kael.

He was sitting in the yard, playing with a toy truck. Sunlight streamed down, stretching his shadow long across the ground until it brushed the tips of my shoes.

We grew up next door to each other.

My mom used to say we were like two saplings growing side by side. Only‚Ä¶ Kael grew faster. Stronger.

When we were in grade school, a boy named Tommy stuck a wad of chewed-up gum in my ponytail.

The class burst into laughter.

The teacher tried to smooth it over. ‚ÄúHe just likes you, sweetheart. Boys tease girls they like. Don‚Äôt cry.‚Äù

Those words stung worse than the gum.

After school, I cried all the way home.

Kael‚Äôs father, David Creed, heard what happened. He called out to his son, who was doing homework on the floor.

‚ÄúKael. Tomorrow. Go have a word with Tommy in second grade.‚Äù

The next day, Kael stormed into my classroom and kicked the back door open.

He moved like a wild little beast, charging Tommy with his tiny fists clenched. He slammed a fist on the boy‚Äôs desk.

‚ÄúListen up,‚Äù he growled, grabbing Tommy by the collar‚Äîstill speaking in that soft, childish voice. ‚ÄúTalia‚Äôs my little sister. If you ever mess with her again, I‚Äôll end you.‚Äù

Before leaving, he patted my head.

And from that moment on, I became Kael‚Äôs shadow.

Chapter 2

Back in middle school, Kael would always hit the field after class to play soccer. His teammates would drag him off for ice cream, and I‚Äôd squat on the sidelines with my backpack, waiting so long that my stomach would start growling.

He‚Äôd grumble and yank me up by the arm. ‚ÄúTalia, are you glued to me or something?‚Äù

But he‚Äôd still break his strawberry popsicle in half and give me the bigger piece.

As I remembered, he hated when people said he ""hung out with girls.""

One time I went looking for him, and his buddies started teasing, ‚ÄúLook, Kael brought his little mate!‚Äù

He got so pissed he chucked his whole bag of marbles down the storm drain.

But when I missed school the next day with a fever, he skipped class, climbed the fence, and showed up outside my window.

He tossed crumpled notes through the screen, each one scrawled with a messy little joke meant to make me laugh.

By high school, I caught him staring at me more times than I could count‚Äîwhen I was chewing on a pen while solving equations; when I tucked my hair behind my ear; even when I dozed off on my desk.

His gaze would land softly on me like the brush of a summer breeze‚Äîbarely there, but impossible to ignore.

One morning, I turned around suddenly and caught him in the act.

‚ÄúKael,‚Äù I said, locking eyes with him, ‚Äúhow do you solve this problem?‚Äù

His pen slipped right out of his hand.

Sunlight poured in through the windows, lighting up the tips of his ears until they looked like they were glowing.

‚ÄúI, uh...‚Äù He scrambled to pick up his pen, his bangs brushing my fingers. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just... I mean...‚Äù

His voice trailed off into a mumble.

I rested my chin on my hand and just watched him.

Turned out, the same boy who once punched another kid for bullying me‚Äîwould tremble just from being near me.

Outside the window, moonflower petals drifted down like snow onto his open textbook.

On the night I turned eighteen, under the glow of the full moon, our wolves finally recognized each other.

My wolf had no doubt: he‚Äôs the one. He‚Äôs our mate.

Our parents were overjoyed and immediately proposed a union between the packs.

And Kael? He pulled me into the fire escape and slammed the door behind us.

The motion-sensor lights flickered overhead. His palm was clammy, but his grip on my fingers was so tight it almost hurt.

‚ÄúThink this through,‚Äù he said hoarsely. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still young. What if... What if someone better comes along someday?‚Äù

I reached up on tiptoe and pressed my fingers over his lips.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one better than you, Kael.‚Äù

He flinched like I‚Äôd shocked him‚Äîthen kissed me like he was finally letting go of every hesitation he‚Äôd ever had.

In the dark, I touched the scar on the back of his neck‚Äîthe one he got in eighth grade, shielding me from falling debris.

That night, moonlight filtered through the iron grates, casting broken shadows over us both.

And his amber eyes shimmered like something out of a dream.

After college, I joined the Ashveil Enterprises‚Äîa company long controlled by Kael‚Äôs family, and ended up working under Kael.

Everything was perfect.

Right up until we were about to get engaged.

That‚Äôs when she showed up.

Riley.

An Omega transfer. Kael‚Äôs new Beta.

From day one, she played the sweet girl card hard‚Äîhanding out coffees with a megawatt smile.

‚ÄúNice to meet you all! I‚Äôm looking forward to working with you!‚Äù

But when she reached my desk, she froze.

‚ÄúOh my god...‚Äù she covered her mouth with a giggle. ‚ÄúAre people still using Hello Kitty thermoses?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything.

She bit her lip. ‚ÄúOops, I didn‚Äôt mean it in a bad way! I just say what‚Äôs on my mind. No offense, okay?‚Äù She leaned closer. ‚ÄúBut seriously... aren‚Äôt you a little old for all this cutesy stuff? I thought women in the workplace were supposed to be, like, elegant and put-together.‚Äù

It felt like the whole office turned to stare at me at once.

My Hello Kitty keyboard, the figurines on my desk, the pink dust covers around my monitor...

Kael used to call these things ‚ÄúTalia‚Äôs fortress.‚Äù

Now, under those judgmental eyes, they felt like a childish display begging to be laughed at.

My ears rang like someone had poured acid into my skull.

Riley's constant laugh drilled straight through me, loud and shrill, like a jackhammer cracking open the little world I‚Äôd built for myself‚Äîcute, safe, and stupidly naive.

‚ÄúGeez, relax. It‚Äôs just a joke, grandma. Don‚Äôt tell me you can‚Äôt even take a little teasing?‚Äù

My knuckles went white, fingers digging into the hem of my skirt.

‚ÄúEnough.‚Äù

Kael‚Äôs voice rang out behind me.

I turned and saw his mouth curled in a sharp, dangerous smile‚Äîhis signature tell when he was pissed.

The sun backlit him from the floor-to-ceiling windows, giving his profile a golden edge.

For a second, he looked just like the boy who once beat up a classmate for gluing gum in my hair.

Riley pouted. ‚ÄúSorry, I was just joking. You‚Äôre not really going to overreact like this, are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a coffee shop. If you want to gossip, Riley, then maybe you should quit and go start a podcast.‚Äù

She slunk back to her desk, face stiff with barely concealed rage.

Chapter 3

I don‚Äôt even know when things changed between Kael and Riley.

It was like I blinked, and suddenly‚Ä¶ the lunch our housekeeper sent over from home came with three sets of utensils.

I stared at the takeout bags, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing here I even like.‚Äù

Kael didn‚Äôt even look up from his reports.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing salads today. Riley says it‚Äôs good to cleanse the system once in a while‚Ä¶‚Äù

Riley slid into the seat next to me, holding her designer coffee like it was a prop in a rom-com.

‚ÄúOops! My bad, Talia\~‚Äù

Her manicured nails tapped on the lid, sending out a hollow rhythm.

‚ÄúI forgot you‚Äôre not into salads. But hey, grown-ups do need to eat healthy sometimes, right?‚Äù

She left the rest unsaid‚Äîbut the smug curve of her lips finished it for her.

I looked at her, my voice quiet but steady.

‚ÄúYou keep saying my name like we‚Äôre best friends or something. Newsflash‚Äîyou're older than me. Should I be calling you grandma?‚Äù

The office went dead silent.

For a second, Riley looked like I‚Äôd slapped her. Her perfectly winged eyeliner twitched.

That‚Äôs when Kael finally looked up from his desk‚Äîjust to frown at me.

‚ÄúTalia, that was uncalled for.

1lzg0e9,https://i.redd.it/wys7tiwaiscf1.jpeg,Should I upgrade my machine (Saeco) or invest in a grinder first? [‚Ç¨350-600],"Hello there!

Here‚Äôs my current day-to-day setup: an old Saeco machine, which I‚Äôm using only with the pressurized filter basket. I don‚Äôt have a grinder yet, and that‚Äôs the point I‚Äôd like advice on. I‚Äôm planning to go further down the espresso rabbit hole, so by the end of the year I‚Äôm considering getting a Baratza Encore ESP to finally start grinding fresh.

Besides that, I‚Äôll gradually pick up the usual accessories (a proper tamper, a decent scale, etc.). What I‚Äôd like to know is: should I stick with this old Saeco machine for now, or would it make more sense to upgrade to something like the De‚ÄôLonghi Dedica or Sage Bambino as a better entry-level espresso machine?

My total budget for coffee gear by the end of the year will be around ‚Ç¨350‚Äì600. One extra note: I‚Äôm not looking to get a manual grinder (at least for now). 

**Here I'm sharing additional info, maybe it helps to make a decission:**

Location: Spain

Preferred drink types: Mostly espresso, but also aeropress. Adding ice most of the times.

Drink frequency: 1‚Äì2 per day

No major limitations regarding space

Experience level: Beginner, moving past entry-level

Manual or electric preference: No manual grinder for now

1. Do employers ever offer things like coupons, gift boxes, care packages, or wellness perks for new parents?
2. Are there programs for parental support, counseling, baby care resources, or backup childcare?
3. I‚Äôve heard of hospital indemnity insurance is it worth adding if you already have a decent PPO plan?

Effects
- mainly more muscle strength, and control: I used to have weak knees when feeling unwell. That‚Äôs completely gone. Also arms and legs are not heavy anymore. I feel fit and wanting to exercise. No crash. No brain fog (it was related to PEM for me). 

- food intolerance gone: With March infection I couldn‚Äôt tolerate coffee, milk, beef, weed. My heart rate would go up for 2-3 hrs until it was calming down again. Recorded it with Apple Watch - reproducible after each meal. It took some weeks experimenting to find out what was going on. Now I can eat anything. I don‚Äôt care about ingredients (despite eating as healthy and veggy as possible) and I continue to ditch alcohol. 

Side effects
- sudden sleepiness: had that the first few weeks with Gou Teng when using about 1g and take it at once. It was a strange phenomenon. My eyes just shut down but I could not sleep. Never had that before. It got better when I reduced the dosage and started to take it in small sips across the day. It seems to be resolved now. I can take 2g in the evening and don‚Äôt have any side effect. 

- Tunnel vision and light sedation: in the beginning I had this about 30 min after Gou Teng intake. I soon connected it to Wormwood (Artemisia Annua) which I trialed for a few weeks alread. When I left Wormwood away (5 days of taking nothing to clean the system) it was resolved. 

- digestion issues: I got a message from someone who was just starting to use Gou Teng who reported strong digestion issues. I‚Äôm about to find out more. But I recommend to start slow (as always) eg 200mg for a few days - 500mg for a week - 1 g for a week - 2 g for a week, avoid drug interactions (reduce other drugs as much as possible), use fermented food to support your guts or try probiotics along.

At a quiet caf√© somewhere in Paris, Loki (the Norse god of tricks) slumped in his chair. He stirred his coffee like he was mad at it.¬†‚ÄùOdin called my art trash. Me! I‚Äôm the only one who ever made Asgard interesting.‚Äù¬†He flicked a sugar packet across the table.¬†‚ÄùWhat‚Äôs the big deal?¬† I just turned his throne into a giant rubber duck.

Loki smirked.¬†‚ÄùAt least my prank had style. Yours was just‚Ä¶ sparkly.‚Äù

‚ÄúSays the god who got caught because his duck quacked during Odin‚Äôs speech,‚Äù¬†Hermes shot back.

Loki‚Äôs eye twitched.¬†‚ÄùAsgard is still superior. We have the Bifrost‚Äîa bridge that puts your old, broken chariot to shame. And Valkyries? Terrifying. Magnificent.‚Äù

Hermes leaned in.¬†‚ÄùOh please. Olympus has ambrosia that actually tastes good, not just ‚Äòboiled mead and bragging.‚Äô And Pegasus could outfly your sad little reindeer.‚Äù

‚ÄúEight-legged reindeer,‚Äù¬†Loki corrected.¬†‚ÄùAnd Sleipnir would trample your overgrown pigeon.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least my ‚Äòpigeon‚Äô doesn‚Äôt look like a spider horse‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYOU TAKE THAT BACK‚Äî‚Äù

Just as Loki lunged halfway across the table, something outside the window made them freeze.

Coco the monkey, wearing a diamond-studded helmet and tiny sunglasses, rolled by in a gold-plated golf cart. It casually tossed a banana peel over its shoulder while grinning at Loki and Hermes.

Loki and Hermes stared. Then, identical smiles spread across their faces.

1lzfqwu,https://v.redd.it/nbmxhhuxgscf1,"Ramy Youssef, tearing up, brought Zohran Mamdani and Mahmoud Khalil onstage at his recent comedy show. Mahmoud ‚Äî a pro-Palestinian activist who had just been released from ICE detention ‚Äî told Zohran, ‚ÄúI am excited about the possibility of raising my son in a city where you are mayor.‚Äù","On a recent Saturday night, at a sold-out show at the Beacon Theatre, in New York, the comedian Ramy Youssef paced the stage as small circles of lights danced on a wave of red curtains behind him.

. . .

Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia graduate and pro-Palestinian activist just released from ICE detention, was in the front row. To his right sat his wife, Noor Abdalla. To his left, Zohran Mamdani.

It was a delight to catch a glimpse of Khalil in the throes of laughter. He laughed as though each laugh were a physical vessel urgently exiting his body, or a secret he‚Äôd held for so long that it had forced its way out. Khalil‚Äôs body jerked forward when he laughed‚Äîhis laughter was more of a kinetic event than a sonic one. He rocked, he shook slightly, and he smiled wide. One seat over, Mamdani laughed, too, with a bit more volume; his laughter seemed to arrive less like a long-held secret than like an idea that he couldn‚Äôt wait to share. Most of the audience didn‚Äôt know that the two men were in the room, and because of this most of the audience missed out on the small miracle of watching them share their joy at the scene before them.

When Khalil was detained by ICE, in early March, he became the first and the most visible case of the Trump Administration detaining students on visas or green cards who had engaged in pro-Palestinian protests. Throughout his detention, which lasted more than a hundred days, Khalil wrote op-eds in his prison notebook, then dictated them over the phone. In one of these pieces, written after Abdalla gave birth to their son, he described the unfathomable heartbreak of being forced to miss the birth of his first child. But he also foregrounded his core political principles, continuing to center Palestine. He saw his detainment not as a reason to shrink from his beliefs but as an opportunity to stand firmly and publicly behind them.

**If you are not careful, and if you are not tapped into your own humanity and that of others, it can be tempting to mistake people for symbols.** It is easy to affix a political prisoner to his political positions, or to the horrors of his detainment, and to see nothing else. The government sought to make an example of Mahmoud Khalil, to show others what happens when you are vocal about the rights of the Palestinian people. In many ways, this is how the state distorts the perspective of even the most well-meaning people: if what you understand about Khalil is that he has suffered, and you believe that his suffering is unjust, and your heart aches for his suffering, that ache may overwhelm your ability to understand him as anything else. Such shortsightedness isn‚Äôt nefarious, but it does make a fraction out of a full life. I love the Hadith about a collective body because it is not just about pain‚Äîit is about sharing the full spectrum of human feeling. I am not drawn to action only because people have suffered or are suffering; I am drawn to action because I am distinctly aware of every inch of humanity from which suffering keeps people.

I met both Khalil and Mamdani backstage. At first, Khalil appeared to be equal parts overjoyed and overwhelmed. But after an initial rush of people taking pictures, a quiet settled over him, and over the space. Within that calm, Khalil seemed observant, open, and far more interested in others than they could ever be in him. When we found a secluded corner, Khalil wanted to talk about poems, about the wonders of early fatherhood, about what might await him in the coming months besides the exhaustion of his ongoing case against the Trump Administration.

Abdalla told me that her husband had been learning to hold their baby, and what rushed to mind was the reality that Khalil, who is thirty, is still so young. Left in peace, he would be devoting all his time to figuring out the world of new fatherhood and life after grad school. He didn‚Äôt ask to be made a symbol, even if he navigated becoming one with grace and care. It was blissfully surreal to be backstage, at a comedy show, drinking coffee with him. I felt such gratitude for the presence of his whole self that all I could find to say, during that first moment of calm, was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you are here. I‚Äôm glad they couldn‚Äôt take you from us entirely.‚Äù

Khalil and Mamdani hadn‚Äôt met before, but I watched them flow into easy, often funny conversation. **It was fascinating to watch two beacons of Muslim victory turned toward each other: one man tasked with reimagining a city, the other with making his freedom about something beyond himself.** Mamdani was dressed in a dark suit with a patterned tie, as he often is on the campaign trail. He talked about the spike in death threats he‚Äôs experienced since his primary win and how differently he‚Äôs had to move now that he has a full security detail. I thought of the book tour that had absorbed much of my past year. As the crowds got bigger, the threats on my life increased, and I would now and then have to have some security personnel watch over a book-signing line or escort me back to a hotel. I would send texts to my group chat of Muslims, saying some variation of ‚ÄúI feel most Muslim when someone wants me dead,‚Äù and we would laugh. It might not be funny if you are not one of us.

Khalil said that he, too, has been inundated with threats, and that they‚Äôve increased exponentially since his release. He said that he mostly just tries to ignore the threats, and to be careful when out in the world. After this, there was a brief silence among the three of us, a beat of shared recognition of the difficulties of staying alive. **For some people, Khalil and Mamdani offer, in different though not unrelated ways, essential stories of endurance, a set of ropes to which so many are clinging to survive unsurvivable times.**

In the lull, I found myself considering distance again‚Äîthe distance that exists between two Muslim men who are navigating two distinct victories that thrust upon them similar concerns. **I thought about the distance between the people who want you dead and the people who want you gone, vanished through deportation or a more mundane form of silencing. There might not be as much distance between those two groups as we‚Äôd like there to be**, especially if their members are loud, have power, and are unafraid to publicly fantasize about material violence. **The distance between both populations lessens even more in cases where someone seems to be getting gone and then has the nerve to come back**‚Äîto be dismissed as a loser and then win a primary, or to be jailed for pro-Palestinian speech and, when freed, speak up for Palestine at the first opportunity possible.

After the moment passed, Mamdani smiled, put an arm around Khalil, and said, ‚ÄúI wish I could take you with me everywhere.‚Äù And the three of us laughed, even if there was a bit of heaviness within the joke. Laughter soiled with grief is still laughter.

. . .

Toward the end of Khalil‚Äôs short remarks, he looked at Mamdani as if it were just the two of them in the room, and he said, **‚ÄúI am excited about the possibility of raising my son in a city where you are mayor.‚Äù** It was a stunning moment, one of those times when you could, if you were listening, hear a collective catching of breath before a fresh wave of applause. People made their way to the exits, some wiping away tears. I saw a friend, and we hugged. She said, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realize I was crying, but now I can‚Äôt stop.‚Äù

As beautiful as that memory was, what lingered in my mind was the final joke of the night, when Khalil said that he was honored to be standing with Mamdani, ‚Äúa man so principled that ICE hasn‚Äôt arrested him yet.‚Äù He paused and then, with perfect timing, added, ‚ÄúYou can tell they are thinking about it.‚Äù Mamdani laughed. Youssef laughed. I laughed in my seat. It was a classically funny joke, made by someone who had been snatched from the lobby of his building by ICE agents, a joke lovingly directed at a mayoral candidate who has been threatened with deportation by the President and other political leaders. The joke was funny because of what some of us in the room knew and because of what the person telling it had lived through. The joke was funny because, though some of us in the room wept often, our laughter outpaced what we know of the world, for a few seconds at a time.

- I switched out my profile photo for a clean, approachable shot (AI touchup helps!) and finally updated that bland banner to something relevant for my industry.

- Redid my headline ‚Äî not just my job title, but what I *do*, *how I help,* and *who I help.* Stuffed in keywords but kept it natural.

- My About section became more like a coffee chat intro ‚Äî focused on my story and what motivates me.

- Listed achievements with measurable outcomes in Experience (not just duties), and asked a few people for honest recommendations.

One stat that hit home: LinkedIn data shows profiles with strong summaries get almost 4x as many views. It‚Äôs real.

If you're curious, I mapped out my full process step by step here (plus some tools/tips):

1lzfpdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1lzfpdz/your_employee_in_the_car_screw_off_my_billionaire/,Your Employee in the Car? Screw Off! My Billionaire Best Friend Is My Groom Now,"I leaned against the wall, carefully cradling my six-month bump as I waited for my prenatal checkup.  
  
Once the scheduled examination was done, I planned to visit my husband Aiden‚Äîmaybe we could head home together.  
  
After all, the rain was coming down hard outside. The rideshare app showed nearly 200 people ahead of me in the queue, and my phone signal kept cutting out sporadically.  
  
Aiden wasn't scheduled for specialist clinic duty today, but one of his team's doctor colleagues had called in sick last minute. So he'd been forced to cover a half-day shift.  
  
The heavy smell of disinfectant in the hospital corridors mixed with the damp scent of the downpour outside, making me nauseous.  
  
The waiting area was packed. Children crying, anxious inquiries, nurses trying to maintain order‚Äîall the sounds blended together into a headache-inducing chaos.  
  
I found an empty spot on the bench outside the obstetrics office and had just settled down when I spotted Aiden's tall figure emerging from a consultation room.  
  
He wore his crisp white coat, pressed to perfection, his face still bearing the exhaustion from last night's surgery.  
  
But his gaze swept across the crowd with that familiar sharpness and... intensity. This was the Aiden I knew‚Äîcalm, efficient, completely intolerant of chaos or rule-breaking.  
  
As one of the youngest deputy chief cardiologists at a top New York hospital, his professionalism and strict adherence to protocol were practically carved into his bones.  
  
I'd always considered this a strength.  
  
Just as I was about to call out to him, I saw a figure skillfully weaving through the queue, heading straight for Aiden's office.  
  
That silhouette... was that Vera?  
  
I frowned. Vera was an intern who'd joined the department just over a month ago. Young, pretty, always flashing that sweet smile.  
  
My first impression of her at the hospital had been positive‚Äîa breath of youthful energy.  
  
But here was the problem: she shouldn't be anywhere near Aiden.  
  
Or more precisely, she shouldn't be appearing in such a... privileged way.  
  
Because Aiden had a habitual ""rule""‚Äîto avoid unnecessary complications and distractions, all the interns and assistants he worked with were exclusively male.  
  
This wasn't something he'd actively demanded, but after several young female doctors had tried to ""get close"" through various methods‚Äî""accidentally"" spilling water, messing up reports, asking for ""guidance"" until late at night‚ÄîAiden had had enough.  
  
He'd requested that the training office only assign male interns to his team.  
  
Over time, it became an unspoken understanding within the department.  
  
Even the administrative assistants knew to simply leave documents on his desk‚Äîavoiding any accidental contact with Dr. Aiden.  
  
So what was Vera doing here?  
  
""Aiden!"" Vera's voice carried that deliberately soft sweetness. ""Sorry to bother you, but my stomach pain is really severe...""  
  
Aiden turned slightly. I couldn't even catch the change in his expression before I saw him raise his hand to pull open the consultation room door, gesturing for Vera to enter.  
  
Then, facing the patients and their families who'd been waiting outside for ages, he said flatly: ""Please wait. Handling an emergency.""  
  
Complaints erupted immediately.  
  
""Are you kidding me? We've been waiting all morning!""  
  
""Emergency? That girl looked perfectly healthy just now.""  
  
""Yeah, isn't Dr. Aiden supposed to be the most by-the-book guy here? Line-cutting?""  
  
Aiden's expression didn't budge an inch, as if those voices simply didn't exist.  
  
He was about to close the door when his gaze inadvertently swept across the crowd and landed on me in the corner.  
  
For a split second, I saw surprise flash in Aiden's eyes. Then it shifted into something almost imperceptible... annoyance?  
  
But he said nothing. With a sharp ""bang,"" he shut the consultation room door, blocking out everyone's stares.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
My heart plummeted. Ten minutes? Twenty minutes? The consultation room door remained firmly shut.  
  
The complaints outside grew louder, nurses tried to calm people down, but it was no use.  
  
An icy sensation spread through my limbs. Not from the air conditioning‚Äîbut from knowing that behind that closed door lay territory I, as his wife, rarely set foot in, yet another young woman had effortlessly claimed.  
  
Even with Aiden himself breaking the rules.  
  
Finally, the door opened. Vera emerged holding a payment slip, her cheeks flushed, eyes bright‚Äîshowing absolutely no signs of the ""severe abdominal pain"" she'd mentioned earlier.  
  
She walked toward the payment counter with light steps.  
  
As she passed by me, she even shot me a look that carried triumph, almost defiant in its smugness.  
  
Aiden followed, his expression restored to its usual calm, as if he'd never broken any rules at all.  
  
He looked at me, not giving me a chance to speak: ""Almost off duty.  
  
Finished with your checkup? I still have a few patients‚Äîafter that I'll drive you home. Too much rain outside, rideshares are impossible.""  
  
I said nothing.  
  
The crushing disappointment and sense of betrayal left me heartbroken. I followed Aiden silently to his break room to wait.  
  
Every minute of waiting felt endless.  
  
The break room still carried the faint scent of jasmine perfume‚ÄîVera's fragrance from earlier.  
  
I stared at the neatly arranged files on Aiden's desk and the no-smoking sign beside them, remembering that argument from a month ago.  
  
I'd just finished throwing up from morning sickness and felt suddenly hungry.  
  
When I went to see Aiden, I brought only the mildest lemon water‚ÄîI knew how sensitive he was to strong smells.  
  
But when I took a sip in his office, Aiden said coldly: ""Tina, this is a hospital, not a coffee shop. That smell will linger for hours‚Äîit could affect my clinical judgment. Please don't eat or drink anything in here again.""  
  
Just one sip of water. Aiden had used such harsh, cold phrasing as ""affecting judgment.""  
  
And now, Vera, merely an ""intern,"" had not only broken Aiden's rule about working with female interns, but had also been privileged enough to skip the crowded clinic queue and enter his consultation room because of a ""stomach ache""?  
  
Yet her lingering jasmine fragrance‚Äîwouldn't that affect his ""professional judgment""?  
  
When Aiden returned after seeing his last patient, I was standing by the window, watching the storm outside. ""Let's go."" He grabbed his car keys. ""I parked in the basement garage, no need to get soaked.""  
  
The underground garage felt somewhat damp from the storm's penetration. Aiden's black SUV sat in the spacious parking spot.  
  
When I reached the car, Aiden didn't immediately unlock it, instead looking toward the passenger side.  
  
I followed his gaze and saw the passenger door open.  
  
Vera poked her head out, her face a picture of ""surprise"" and ""apology"": ""Tina? Oh my God‚ÄîI'm so sorry! Earlier, Aiden saw I couldn't get a ride and with this terrible rain, he offered to drop me home... I didn't mean to intrude. Aiden, maybe I should sit in the back?""  
  
She pretended to unbuckle her seatbelt to get out, but Aiden simply unlocked the rear doors and said to me: ""Get in.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Then Aiden turned back to Vera, his tone noticeably softer, carrying a hint of reassurance he probably wasn't even aware of: ""It's fine, stay put. You're soaked out there.""  
  
Vera sweetly said ""okay"" and settled back into her seat. Her face still wore that apologetic expression, but her eyes betrayed her current smugness.  
  
I supported my bump and awkwardly maneuvered into the back seat. The car started up and smoothly pulled out of the garage. We drove into the storm.  
  
The car shut out the wind and rain, but it couldn't shut out the silence inside. Aiden broke it first, his voice calm: ""Vera's apartment is pretty far. We'll drop her off first.""  
  
I said nothing, and the last shred of hope in my heart completely vanished. From the hospital to our home was normally a ten-minute drive. But Vera's apartment was in the complete opposite direction‚Äîthis ""far"" was definitely not just a little out of the way.  
  
I watched their silhouettes. Vera seemed a bit cold, arms wrapped around herself. Aiden immediately reached over to turn up the heat near the passenger seat.  
  
Vera said something quietly. Aiden tilted his head slightly, actually smiling, and responded in low tones. I clenched my fists, my body trembling involuntarily. Aiden was completely ignoring me.  
  
The warm air from the heater mixed with Vera's jasmine scent, wafting back toward me in waves. Pregnancy had made my sense of smell acute‚Äîin that moment, it made me nauseous.  
  
Instinctively, I cracked the window open slightly. A blast of cold, rain-laden air immediately rushed in. ""Ah!"" Vera let out a shriek from the passenger seat, dramatically hunching her shoulders. ""So cold!""  
  
Aiden glanced at me through the rearview mirror, his eyes showing displeasure: ""It's pouring. Close the window! Getting the car wet makes it smell worse.""  
  
My heart felt like it was being crushed by a giant fist. Three days ago, just because I'd taken that sip of lemon water in his office, he hadn't spoken to me since. But now?  
  
Vera could sit in his passenger seat wearing perfume, enjoying the heat he'd turned up for her. Just because she complained about being cold, Aiden immediately blamed me for opening the window.  
  
Principles? Rules?  
  
Apparently they only applied to me.  
  
A wave of nausea surged from my stomach, the baby kicking hard‚Äîmaybe sensing my emotional turmoil.  
  
I closed my eyes, took a deep breath of the cold air streaming through the window, forcing myself to stay calm. Then I expressionlessly rolled the window back up.  
  
The car returned to its enclosed warmth. But Vera's mood hadn't immediately recovered. She began complaining softly: ""This weather is awful. I should have grabbed a jacket before leaving.""  
  
""Are you hungry?"" Aiden suddenly asked, his voice surprisingly gentle. The car happened to be passing a brightly lit convenience store.  
  
Vera hesitated: ""Well... a little. I always seem to get hungrier when I'm not feeling well...""  
  
Aiden immediately put on his turn signal and smoothly pulled into the convenience store parking lot. Without looking at me, he unbuckled his seatbelt: ""Wait here.""  
  
Rain hammered against Aiden's umbrella as he got out, instantly soaking half his pant legs. He didn't seem to care, heading straight into the store.  
  
A few minutes later, he returned with dampness clinging to him and water droplets on his clothes. He handed Vera a hot cocoa and a paper bag containing a warm cinnamon roll.  
  
""Eat it while it's hot,"" his voice was low and caring. ""Warm your stomach.""  
  
Sweet, buttery, rich cinnamon scent immediately filled the small car interior. I watched Aiden's soaked sleeves and shoulders, watched the concern in his eyes as he handed Vera the food.  
  
In that instant, I gave up completely. I thought of countless late nights when Aiden came home exhausted after surgery, how I'd tiptoe around, not daring to make a sound for fear of disturbing his rest, because he'd said he hated being bothered most of all.  
  
I thought of all his prohibitions: the cleanliness of private spaces, the ban on eating in his office, the strict boundaries in personal relationships... I'd spent nine careful years maintaining all of Aiden's principles.  
  
Turns out, every rule could be broken.

## What is Benevia Fundex?

**Benevia Fundex** is an AI-powered trading platform designed to make trading more accessible and (hopefully) more profitable for everyone. It uses real-time data and automated analysis to help users trade multiple asset types, including crypto, forex, stocks, and even commodities.

Think of it like your own digital trading assistant. It doesn‚Äôt just show charts‚Äîit analyzes them for you, offers trade suggestions, and even automates trades based on criteria you set. If you've used platforms like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**, the core concept is similar, but Benevia Fundex seems to focus more on customization and user control.

## Who Created Benevia Fundex?

Details about the actual creators of **Benevia Fundex** are pretty limited, which is honestly a bit frustrating. From what I could dig up, the platform was developed by a team of fintech professionals, traders, and AI engineers. It‚Äôs probably a small to mid-sized team rather than a massive corporation, which can be a good thing‚Äîmore innovation, less red tape.

That said, I‚Äôd love more transparency. Unlike Coinbase or Binance, where you know the leadership team, Benevia operates a bit more anonymously. Not a dealbreaker, but something to watch.

Thick as thieves. Shared everything. He was my best friend since childhood. We meet each other at kindergarten and we've been pals ever since. Our mothers grew up together and everything.

Until it stopped.

I have grown distant, true, but in the last three years I've been taking care of my sisters because of a terrible illness. Every time we see each other he's grown distant as well, constanly texting or leaving voicemails and being vague about it when I'm there. He's erratic and he never sticks up to a plan. He constantly runs around and wants me to meet them even at the other side of town when I'm not there. Whenever I tell him I'm too tired to do as he says and believe me, taking care of my family is basically a full time job now, he acts offended and even says that ""time is fleeting"" and he ""may not be here forever"". There was a time I just plain wanted to get a coffee and take a break and got offended when I didn't want to help him sort some documents. I'm sorry to say that, but it was very early in the morning and I just didn't have the mental capacity for that.

Needless to say I haven't had much time to hang out with people, not even him. He, too, has become more withdrawn and, most worringly, secretive. What worries me the most is that everyone around him has only bad things to say. He recently broke things off with several life long friends. Got into ugly fights. Sees enemies everywhere. Had some ugly breakups and there are even voices of him being abusive towards his girlfriend.

Now he's talking about some plan to leave town and go somewhere else for a not very well defined ""job"" and I'm extremely worried. I've been told that I should leave things be and think about my own family first, but I'm worried he's going to harm himself or worse. This situation is absolutely devastating and I fear I'm going to lose my best friend forever and this situation is tearing me apart.

# How to Choose the Best Coffee Packaging [2025 Guide]

The quality of coffee packaging is paramount to preserving the aroma, flavor, and overall freshness of coffee beans, whether whole bean or ground. Selecting the right packaging is a crucial decision for coffee roasters, distributors, and even home brewers who take their coffee seriously. This guide will delve into the essential factors to consider when choosing the best coffee packaging in 2025, ensuring your coffee reaches consumers in optimal condition.

[[Browse top-rated how to choose the best coffee packaging on Amazon]](https://best.healthytargeting.com/clearance-products/?KW=how+to+choose+the+best+coffee+packaging)
## Key Features Analysis

The selection of appropriate coffee packaging requires careful consideration of several key features that directly impact the coffee's preservation and marketability.

**Material Composition:** The material used in coffee packaging plays a vital role in protecting the beans from external elements like oxygen, moisture, and light. High-barrier materials such as multi-layered films with aluminum foil or metallized layers are commonly used to create an effective barrier. These materials are often laminated with polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP) for heat sealing and structural integrity. The choice of material should also consider sustainability aspects, with increasing demand for recyclable or compostable options.

**Valve Technology:** One-way degassing valves are essential for coffee packaging, especially for freshly roasted beans. These valves allow carbon dioxide (CO2), which is naturally released by roasted coffee, to escape from the package without allowing oxygen to enter. The valve prevents the bag from bursting due to the buildup of CO2 pressure and protects the coffee from oxidation, preserving its flavor and aroma. High-quality valves ensure a consistent and reliable degassing process.

**Sealing Mechanism:** The sealing mechanism is critical for maintaining the integrity of the package and preventing leaks or air ingress. Heat sealing is the most common method, creating a strong and airtight closure. The type of seal, such as fin seal, lap seal, or quad seal, depends on the bag format and the desired aesthetic. Consistent and reliable sealing is crucial for ensuring the coffee remains fresh throughout its shelf life.

**Bag Format and Design:** The format of the coffee bag influences its functionality, shelf appeal, and consumer convenience. Common formats include stand-up pouches, side-gusseted bags, flat-bottom bags, and pillow bags. Stand-up pouches offer excellent shelf stability and visual appeal, while side-gusseted bags provide a larger volume capacity. The design should also consider factors like ease of opening, reclosability (e.g., zip closures), and the ability to stack and display the bags effectively.

**Printing and Labeling:** High-quality printing and labeling are essential for conveying brand information, product details, and legal requirements to consumers. The printing method, such as flexography, rotogravure, or digital printing, should produce vibrant and durable images that withstand handling and storage. Labels should clearly display information like roast date, origin, flavor profile, and brewing instructions. Accurate and attractive labeling enhances the product's marketability and builds consumer trust.

**Sustainability Considerations:** With increasing environmental awareness, sustainable packaging options are becoming increasingly important. Options include using recyclable materials (e.g., PE films), compostable materials (e.g., bio-based polymers), and reducing the overall packaging material. Consider using water-based inks and minimizing the use of adhesives to enhance recyclability. Consumers are increasingly seeking eco-friendly products, making sustainable packaging a competitive advantage.

## Core Benefits

The benefits of choosing the right coffee packaging extend beyond mere containment, impacting the product's quality, shelf life, and consumer perception.

**Extended Freshness:** Proper coffee packaging significantly extends the freshness of the coffee beans. By creating an effective barrier against oxygen, moisture, and light, the packaging prevents oxidation and staling, preserving the coffee's aroma and flavor for a longer period. This ensures that consumers enjoy a high-quality cup of coffee, even after weeks or months of storage.

**Enhanced Aroma Preservation:** The aroma of coffee is a critical factor in the overall sensory experience. High-barrier packaging materials and one-way degassing valves work together to retain the volatile aromatic compounds within the bag. This ensures that the coffee retains its rich and enticing aroma, enhancing the consumer's anticipation and enjoyment.

**Protection Against Contamination:** Coffee beans are susceptible to contamination from external sources, such as moisture, odors, and pests. Proper packaging provides a protective barrier against these contaminants, ensuring the coffee remains clean and safe for consumption. This is particularly important for maintaining the quality and integrity of specialty and premium coffees.

**Improved Brand Image:** The quality and design of the coffee packaging directly impact the brand's image and consumer perception. Attractive and functional packaging conveys a sense of quality and professionalism, enhancing the brand's appeal. Sustainable packaging options can further boost the brand's image by demonstrating a commitment to environmental responsibility.

**Increased Shelf Appeal:** Eye-catching and well-designed packaging increases the product's visibility and attractiveness on store shelves. The bag format, graphics, and labeling all contribute to the overall shelf appeal, influencing consumers' purchasing decisions. Effective packaging design can differentiate the product from competitors and attract new customers.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about coffee packaging can help consumers and businesses make informed decisions.

**What is the best type of material for coffee packaging to maintain freshness?**
  Multi-layered films with an aluminum foil or metallized layer provide the best barrier against oxygen, moisture, and light, which are the primary factors that degrade coffee quality. These materials are often laminated with polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP) for heat sealing and structural integrity.

**Why are one-way degassing valves important for coffee packaging?**
  Freshly roasted coffee releases carbon dioxide (CO2). One-way degassing valves allow this CO2 to escape from the package without allowing oxygen to enter. This prevents the bag from bursting and protects the coffee from oxidation, preserving its flavor and aroma.

**Can coffee packaging be recycled or composted?**
  Yes, there are recyclable and compostable coffee packaging options available. Recyclable options typically use PE films, while compostable options use bio-based polymers. However, the availability of recycling or composting facilities may vary depending on the region.

**How long does coffee stay fresh in properly sealed packaging?**
  Properly sealed coffee packaging can extend the shelf life of coffee beans to several months. Whole bean coffee typically stays fresh for longer than ground coffee. The roast date is a more reliable indicator of freshness than the ""best by"" date.

## Competitor Comparison

Comparing different coffee packaging options can highlight their strengths and weaknesses.

### Product Comparison Overview

#### Premium Foil-Lined Bag
  *   **Material:** Multi-layer foil laminate with PE lining
  *   **Valve:** High-quality one-way degassing valve
  *   **Seal:** Heat-sealed with zip closure

#### Standard Polypropylene Bag
  *   **Material:** Single-layer polypropylene film
  *   **Valve:** None
  *   **Seal:** Heat-sealed

#### Compostable Bio-Polymer Bag
  *   **Material:** Bio-based polymer film
  *   **Valve:** One-way degassing valve (compostable)
  *   **Seal:** Heat-sealed with optional zip closure

### Key Differences Summary
The Premium Foil-Lined Bag offers the best protection against oxygen and moisture, ensuring maximum freshness, but is not recyclable. The Standard Polypropylene Bag is the least expensive option but provides minimal protection and no degassing capabilities. The Compostable Bio-Polymer Bag offers an environmentally friendly option with good protection and degassing, but may have a shorter shelf life than foil-lined bags. For businesses prioritizing freshness and premium quality, the foil-lined bag is the best choice. For those focused on sustainability, the compostable bag is a better option.

## Ideal User Profile

Different users have different needs when it comes to coffee packaging.

**Specialty Coffee Roasters:** Specialty coffee roasters require packaging that preserves the unique flavors and aromas of their high-quality beans. They prioritize high-barrier materials, reliable degassing valves, and attractive printing to showcase their brand and product. They also value sustainable packaging options that align with their brand values.

**Large-Scale Coffee Producers:** Large-scale coffee producers focus on cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability. They require packaging that can withstand automated filling and handling processes. While freshness is important, they often prioritize affordability and volume capacity.

**Home Brewers:** Home brewers who roast their own coffee need smaller-scale packaging solutions that are easy to use and store. They may prioritize resealable bags and attractive designs for personal enjoyment or gifting. They also appreciate sustainable options and clear labeling.

## Buying Recommendations & Conclusion

When selecting coffee packaging, consider your specific needs, budget, and sustainability goals. If preserving freshness and aroma are your top priorities, invest in high-barrier materials and reliable degassing valves. If sustainability is a key concern, explore recyclable or compostable options.

Overall, choosing the best coffee packaging involves balancing several factors, including material composition, functionality, design, and cost. By carefully considering these elements, you can ensure that your coffee reaches consumers in optimal condition, enhancing their experience and building brand loyalty. The Premium Foil-Lined Bag is recommended for high-end coffee, while the Compostable Bio-Polymer Bag is a good choice for environmentally conscious businesses. The Standard Polypropylene Bag should only be used for short-term storage or when cost is the primary consideration.

I get up knowing i made mistakes that i can't undo. I get up each morning and try to do the same three things. Make coffee, Read emails and messages, and last breath. I been doing that for about 4 months. This last week I got the job i wanted. Nothing crazy but it in a field i know well. As i got the job i felt nothing at first. It seemed like a step was made but it was not worth it almost. I lose out on some great times with good coworkers to go into the unknown.   
  
So i took a breath   
where was i 1 year ago: I hated myself, I hated my job and i just felt like i was rushing to get better.   
where was i 2 years ago: I did not have a job i was fighting to find one.   
where was i 3 years ago: I broke up with the women i loved not to hurt her from my past mistakes  
where was i 4 years ago: I was charged with a crime   
where was i 5 years ago: I was doing drugs and lying and being an ass   
where was i 6 years ago: I was lost 

I thought about these last 6 years. I am very proud of what i am doing. I am proud to say that i keep moving forward. I made plenty of mistakes and look at them constantly. I know that i am going down the right path now. I have a chance to go back to school through my job. I have a CHANCE to live a little normal .   
  
I say these things on a random post not only for me. I find i read the internet late at night looking for something to show me i am doing right. Not a lot of people show their weakness fully out there.  For me i was lucky enough to have Brother that came back to me later in life to help. I was lucky enough to have good friends that i found who saw the better me. I had strangers who gave me advice that ill never forget. 

""time is not able to be Bought, Sold, or Bargained for. So let your actions in this life show your worth."" 

""freedom does not come for free. You earn it"" 

""Don't be me. Learn from me and my mistakes"" 

My favorite still is this   
  
""Man did you eat today? Because if you did not that's where you should start""  

Why do i bring this up? why does this matter. Because my drive my hunger for knowledge, betterment, and for food is how i got here. We are all hunger for more. I just hungered to live again. Now that i am there i find it both sad and upsetting. I wasted years fucking around and finding out. I am behind but there is a path. I found it with help. I hope that people who are struggling read this and see that you are not alone. It takes time and effort and just a little bit of being an ass to get there. I know you will get there.

""Get the OR ready. Remove her womb. Make sure it‚Äôs done before she wakes.""



The pack healer went rigid with shock.



""Alpha... Remove her womb?!""



""Alpha‚Äîyou don't have an heir! You do this, the pack will have no heir. The pack elders will never accept it!""



Cassian's voice was ice-cold, devoid of emotion.



""I don‚Äôt need an heir from Evelyn Carter. Annabelle delivered my heir yesterday. He will inherit everything. Evelyn‚Äôs womb is a threat.""



The healer's face crumpled with disbelief.



""But that boy will carry another man's name, call another man Alpha. After seven miscarriages, The chances of Luna carrying another are barely there.""



Cassian lit a cigarette, his voice bitter.



""Annabelle is my true mate, I‚Äôd do anything for her, I don't care some Moon Goddess pairing.""



""Alpha, but‚Äî""



""Enough."" He frowned. ""Do it.""



Just as Cassian got up to go, his phone buzzed. He hit speaker by mistake.



""Alpha, got the cash. Hell, after seven jobs, I could do this shit in my sleep. Next time, I‚Äôll wear a vampire disguise‚Äîreally carve up that Luna's belly‚Äî""



""No next time. Take your money and disappear from Moonvale.""



Footsteps approached from deeper inside.



I stumbled back to my room, barely making it to the bed before Cassian entered.



""Evelyn, you're up. When did you wake up?""



Sweat beaded on my forehead as I fought to appear normal.



""Just woke up. You weren't here, so I thought I'd stretch my legs.""



His eyes narrowed slightly, studying my face.



My wolf whimpered with terror. Just when I thought he'd caught me, he scooped me up and settled me back on the bed.



""Baby, you scared the hell out of me. We already lost our pup‚ÄîI can't handle losing you too.""



He dared to mention our pup.



Thinking of all the puppies he'd murdered, I pressed a hand to my chest as grief threatened to overwhelm me.



Those accidents, the attacks, the fall‚Äîall of it orchestrated by my own mate.



""The heal needs to do a follow-up procedure. Just to make sure everything's healing properly.""



""I know losing the baby hurts, but we'll try again. We'll have the most beautiful pup‚Äîstrong like their Alpha, gentle like their mother.""



Cassian handed me a vial of potion. In the brief moment he turned away, I saw a thick, dark liquid shimmer as something else mixed in and vanished.



He pulled me close, his expression soft with false concern.



But I could see through the mask now. Every gentle touch was a lie.



""Do I really need to drink this? I'm not very thirsty...""



Cassian, you've slaughtered seven of my children. Now you want to steal my very ability to be a mother?



He didn't even pause, stroking my hair with that practiced tenderness.



""Come on, don't be difficult. You need your strength to heal. You want your Alpha to worry himself sick?""



""Let me help you with that.""



He pressed the glass to my lips, his grip firm enough that refusal wasn't an option.



I closed my eyes, each swallow feeling like liquid fire burning down my throat.



As the drugs took hold, I saw the healer slip into the room through my blurring vision.



""Begin immediately. And...""



Cassian's voice dropped to barely a whisper.



""Make sure she can‚Äôt walk again.""



Chapter 2



""Alpha, is this really necessary? Isn‚Äôt that‚Ä¶ a little too cruel?""



""Do it!""



I knew Cassian was always calculating and paranoid, but I never imagined that just seeing me awake early would push him to such cruelty.



My puppy, my chance at motherhood, and now even my ability to walk‚Äîhe was taking everything.



Cassian, is this how you treat the mate the Moon Goddess chose for you?



My wolf howled inside me, wild and silent with fury.



I screamed silently in despair, struggling to sit up, but the darkness pulled me deeper.



As the anesthesia began to wear off, I heard the healer's voice through the haze:



""Alpha, her womb has been removed. And... she'll never walk again.""



Cassian's voice was filled with satisfaction. ""Good. Perfect.""



When I fully awakened, tears were falling onto my hands‚Äîhis tears, so convincingly real.



""Evelyn, the healer says infection damaged your womb. You'll never be able to have children.""



I ignored him, frantically trying to move my legs.



Nothing. No sensation at all.



I broke down completely, sobbing as I demanded:



""Cassian, what did you do to my legs?""



Tears streamed down his face, his voice breaking with practiced grief.



""There were complications with the anesthesia. You're paralyzed from the waist down.""



""Don't be scared, baby... no matter what happens, I'll never leave you. I'll always love you.""



I'd never realized what a gifted actor my mate was.



He dismissed the nurses, personally feeding me soup, cleaning my body, even tending to the post-surgical bleeding himself.



He worked tirelessly until evening, then kissed my forehead tenderly.



""You've suffered so much for our pack. I promise I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you.""



I studied his exhausted face, then looked away coldly.



""You should rest if you're tired.""



""I'll stay right here with you. Just call if you need anything.""



Once he was asleep, I reached for his second phone.



I'd always known about Cassian's other device‚Äîhis ""work phone""‚Äîbut had never thought to check it.



The password worked on the first try.



Annabelle's birthday.



The lock screen showed their wedding photo.



A wedding photo... He'd married her in secret. The white dress seared my eyes.



With trembling fingers, I opened his messages. He called her ""baby"" in every text.



Endless conversations that grew more horrifying with each scroll.



Every business trip had been a lie‚Äîexcuses to be with her.



All those times I'd been hurt that he never came to my doctor appointments.



When physicians asked about the Alpha, I'd smile awkwardly and say he was busy with Alpha duties.



His standard response was always the same:



""I‚Äôve been tied up with pack affairs. Check-ups aren't a big deal‚ÄîI'd just be in the way. You can handle routine things yourself.""



But he'd attended every single one of Annabelle's prenatal appointments. No matter how busy, he never missed one.



He wrote about how excited he was for their child, calling them the most precious thing in his world.



Scrolling further, my heart shattered completely.



Every time I got pregnant, they planned how to kill my child.



Even the car accident from a year ago‚ÄîAnnabelle had been behind the wheel.



She'd said she wanted to experience the thrill of hitting someone. Cassian had eagerly agreed.



His only instruction: ""Try not to kill her outright.""



They discussed hurting me and murdering my children as casually as commenting on the weather.



My nails dug into my palms until blood dripped between my fingers.



The photo album contained thousands of pictures‚Äîall of Annabelle. Candid shots, selfies together, morning scenes, walks, intimate dinners where he'd prepared special meals for her pregnancy...



There were 99+ videos. I switched to that section and felt ice water flood my veins.



Countless recordings of their intimate moments, like they were documenting every encounter.



Even role-playing scenarios that made my stomach turn.



I pressed my hand to my mouth, fighting nausea.



But worse were six videos labeled ""First,"" ""Second,"" all the way to ""Sixth.""



Realizing what they contained, bile rose in my throat as blood filled my mouth.



Chapter 3



I bit down hard on my lip and opened the sixth video.



Cassian and Annabelle were laughing together.



In front of them lay...my unboren puppy.



The blade might as well have been cutting into my own flesh. My wolf howled in agony, the pain causing my stomach to cramp violently.



I couldn't hold back anymore, leaning over the bed rail as dry heaves wracked my body.



I didn't sleep that night, my wolf pacing restlessly in my mind as tears soaked through my hospital gown.



The next morning, Cassian brought me breakfast as usual‚Äîan elaborate spread he'd personally selected.



Pancakes, fresh fruit, coffee, pastries...



I'd once thought this was his way of showing love. Now I knew it was just thoughtless guilt, buying his way out of actually caring.



Remembering the videos, I dry heaved again.



Seeing my distress, Cassian's expression filled with concern:



""Still feeling sick? Damn it, this is all my fault. I hate seeing my mate like this.""



""I'm fine. I want to go home.""



Something flickered across Cassian's face‚Äîa moment of tension.



""You just lost another pup. My mother isn't... handling it well. If you go back to the pack house now, you'll just walk into a shitstorm. Maybe we should wait until things cool down.""



I said nothing, but his expression told me everything I needed to know.



That afternoon, while he was gone, I packed my things and wheeled myself to the pack house.



I rolled through the front door to find Annabelle curled up in Cassian's lap, both of them cooing over a baby whose scent carried unmistakable traces of Graves bloodline.



Margaret emerged from the kitchen with a bowl of bone broth, personally feeding Annabelle spoonful by spoonful.



The three of them looked like the perfect family unit.



The moment Margaret caught my scent, her eyes flashed with her wolf's displeasure.



""Well, well. Look what crawled back to the den. You've got some nerve showing your face here after what you've done.""



""My Alpha son treats you like a precious mate, and this is how you repay him? Another dead heir. You're cursed, and you're bringing that curse into our pack!""



""Annabelle is the one deserves to be Luna of the Moonvale Pack. Get out of my territory‚Äîyou're poison to this pack.""



Annabelle followed Margaret's gaze to me, her eyes glittering with the triumph:



""Luna Margaret, don't be so harsh. What if Evelyn gets upset and starts spreading lies about Alpha and me to the other packs?""



""Let her try. No pack leader gives a damn what a barren she-wolf has to say.""



I knew Margaret had always despised me. She thought I was too headstrong for an Alpha's mate, too independent‚Äîthat I'd challenge her son's authority instead of submitting properly.



Annabelle was everything she wanted: beautiful, submissive, making Cassian the center of her universe like a proper Luna should.



She'd only wanted Annabelle as her son's mate, but then Annabelle married into another pack, and I'd given up everything to be the perfect Alpha's mate.



Margaret had reluctantly accepted me into the pack.



But years of failed pregnancies had pushed her resentment to the breaking point.



Now that Annabelle was back‚Äîwith Cassian's heir‚ÄîMargaret felt free to unleash every bit of venom she'd been storing.



If only she knew that every one of those lost pups had been orchestrated by her beloved Alpha.



Every grandchild she'd mourned had been murdered by the woman she was now treating like precious pack treasure.



In the past, Cassian would have used his Alpha command to intervene. Now he sat there holding Annabelle's child, acting like he couldn't hear a word.



Annabelle nestled deeper into his arms:



""Cassian, you're paying more attention to the pup than to me. Your wolf is making mine jealous.""



Cassian's expression melted with adoration as he nuzzled her neck, scenting her:



""You know you're my true mate. But look what I have for you.""



I followed Annabelle's delighted gaze to a document on the coffee table: ""Pack Territory Transfer Agreement.""



""Oh my God, Cassian! You're giving me pack lands?""



She kissed the corner of his mouth, shooting me a triumphant look over his shoulder.



I smiled back coldly, my wolf finally going still in my mind.



Enjoy it while you can.



Soon enough, you and your precious Alpha will be crawling back to me, begging.

Thank you for reading about my experiences. 

I arrived at work just before 8, and was surprised to see the Cemetery Director waiting for me in the admin building.

‚ÄúHey Vic, what are you doing here so late? I would have thought you'd be long gone by this time,‚Äù I said, walking over to start a fresh pot of coffee.

‚ÄúI have some bad news to tell you and a major request of you,‚Äù Victor said brushing at his prematurely grey hair. There was a tinge of frustration in his voice.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I asked, pulling up a chair and bracing myself for the answer.

‚ÄúKyle no longer works for us anymore. There was an incident with that old tree outside of the cemetery and when confronted about it he blew up. It was decided that he would resign from his position rather than be fired and face a third degree felony‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you serious? He wasn‚Äôt the only one that chopped down that fucking tree, I helped him do it!‚Äù I shouted, jumping to my feet and knocking the chair to the floor.

‚ÄúI am aware of your involvement,‚Äù Victor said, holding a hand up for me to settle and take a seat. I picked the chair up and sat back down.

‚ÄúThe difference between the two of you is that you are willing to listen and keep your sense about yourself. You also didn't bring the axe. I know that I can work with you and Kyle has proven time and time again that he is uncooperative.‚Äù

I sat and thought about his words with clenched fists. I took a deep breath and rested my hands on the table. After a few moments to regain my composure, Victor sat down as well.

‚ÄúWhat is the favor that you want?‚Äù

‚ÄúI need you to work six days a week to help cover for our lack of night guards. Eli has refused to work more than one day a week and I can't fully rely on Thomas and Jacob to pick up the slack. I can trust you to handle the responsibilities. I can trust you to handle the workload. I need you,‚Äù Victor pleaded, his voice straining. Clearly the search for more potential Night Guards wasn't going well.

‚ÄúI want to quadruple my current pay rate,‚Äù I said unflinchingly.

‚ÄúI will give you two grand a night, two grand each night will go to the damages you owe for the destruction of that tree until it is paid off. After that, I will guarantee that you will make whatever you want.‚Äù

I stared at Victor in disbelief. He was actually willing to entertain my outrageous demand. How could the cemetery even afford to pay such large amounts of money.

‚ÄúTonight, I will be joining you. If you are fine with these terms.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess‚Ä¶that would be fine,‚Äù I said, still slightly shocked that I was agreeing to work so much and for so much money.

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù Victor said, clapping his hands and standing. ‚ÄúJust so you know, that tree was valued at over four million dollars, for your part in cutting it down you're on the hook for 1.2 million.‚Äù

My mouth fell agape to the contract I had just agreed to. I had committed myself to working six days a week with no end in the foreseeable future. Victor checked his watch and pointed at it before grabbing a flashlight and heading out. I poured myself a coffee and began the nightly ritual of locking the gates, mentally preparing for my first night working with Victor.

That night had been a series of mild inconveniences, one after another. First was a series of discarded fast food bags and empty soda cans. Then it began to downpour, the rain came down so hard that if anyone had snuck into the cemetery, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to see them.

When I went into the admin building to get a hot cup of coffee, I knocked the pot onto the floor, shattering it into hundreds of pieces. I silently cursed at the mess when a leathery hand emerged from the mess. Pulling itself from the ground strips of soaked cloth clung to the leathery skin as it slowly rose up. I turned and left the admin building, deciding to clean the mess up later.

As the rain began to die down, I finally saw Victor looking at the splayed corpse of another sacrifice to the cemetery. Bathing in the blood below, a series of harpies and mermaids lapped at that blood on one another's bodies. Feathers and scales merged together as the fish heads of the mermaids nipped at the drops of blood falling on them. 

As I approached the beasts scattered in a rush, ignoring Victor completely. I looked at him with an expression of annoyance before approaching the mess. Just as I was looking at the trees the body was suspended from, it was knocked off by the mass of tendrils, cattails, pinecones, and onyx. The front of my already soaked jacket was sprayed with the mist of blood and what I hoped was just dirty rain water.

As dawn approached I was enjoying a short game of chess with Michael. Watching over us a figure with many shifting faces kept giving unsolicited advice as I moved Michael's knight to take my remaining bishop. The shifting faces leered at Michael and smiled at me as it spoke of returning what was lost if I opened the gate. Michael told the thing to fuck off as I wasn't opening the gate before 6 no matter what was promised. All six of the shifting faces merged to that of a scowl before it dragged its lumpy form away.

Moving my rook to take Michael's Queen, I knocked on the table before Michael conceded the match. His eyes grew dull as he said that he didn't like Victor.

‚ÄúHe reminds me too much of the mayor. Unwilling to close this cemetery for good like I have asked all of the previous cemetery directors.‚Äù

I looked at him in confusion.

‚ÄúYeah, just wrap some chains around the gates and weld them shut. No locks, no entry into the cemetery besides the fools eager to see what evils lurking inside. This place has been fed for over two hundred years, I don't know about you, but I think it could go without eating for the rest of eternity.‚Äù

I waved my hand for him to continue, shocked at such a simple solution.

‚ÄúWithout souls to feed this place, the cemetery would slowly have to feed on itself. I imagine that after some time the spirits would consume themselves to satiate the undying hunger of this place. The good fortune of the town would probably fade but is the cost worth it?‚Äù

With his question he faded and I looked down at my watch to see it was 6. I walked over to the south gate and unlocked it before going home.

I thought about what Michael had said. None of the cemetery directors would agree to just permanently close the cemetery. That Victor reminded him of the demonic mayor that had started all of this.

I wanted to know more, perhaps there was something I could do to stop any more sacrifices to that hellhole. Cutting down that tree had helped in slowing down the sacrifices to the cemetery but people would still sneak in. 

Perhaps, if the gates were permanently closed off, a few guards could just patrol the outside and chase off any would-be entrants. 

There were two things that I needed to know first.

Did Kyle still remember how to weld?

And second, what was wrong with Victor?

My apron felt tighter all of a sudden, like it could sense the tension crawling back into the room. My fingers curled loosely on the counter, eyes locked on the glass front doors as she stepped through them.

Mabel.

She wandered over to me with a lazy gait, playing the part well-shoulders relaxed, face unreadable. But her eyes... her eyes darted, just once, toward the back of the store. Just once, and that was enough for me to know.

She leaned on the counter like any customer would, brushing her hair behind her ear with a hand that barely trembled.

""I need help outside,"" she said, voice soft. Measured. ""Can you unlock the propane? I need that today.""

I blinked.

The request was simple. Normal. Innocuous, even. But it was wrong.
We both knew it.
She didn't need propane.

But this wasn't about propane.

It was code. A signal. A lie wrapped in just enough truth to pass unnoticed by ears that might still be listening. Watching.

I gave her the faintest nod, not even sure it could be seen.

""Sure thing,"" I replied, my voice tight, carefully neutral. ""I'll get the keys.""

I stood up slowly, my knees stiff, legs buzzing with the pressure of what we were about to do. The stool scraped back behind me-a harsh little squeal that made my skin crawl. I reached beneath the counter, hand sliding along the cool underside of the till until it hit the shallow metal drawer tucked just out of sight.

It clicked open with a soft snap.

Inside: keys. Dozens. Rusted, unlabeled, and jumbled together like they hadn't been touched in years.

My fingers sifted through them. Most were generic-padlock, back room, alley gate-but then I saw it: a dull brass key with a crooked little ""P"" scratched onto a plastic tag, nearly worn away.

Propane.

I had never used it before. Had never even noticed it before. But now, it felt like it had been waiting. Just like the town. Just like him.

I slipped it into my pocket and stepped out from behind the counter.

The air outside slapped my face with cool, dry fingers. Bright morning light tried to cut through the building shadows, but it couldn't quite reach us back here. Not behind the store. Not in this forgotten sliver of the lot.

Mabel stood by the locked propane cage, arms crossed tight, her stance rigid. Like she expected something to go wrong. Like she was already bracing for it.

She didn't look at me when I joined her. Just nodded once.

I pulled the key from my pocket. It felt heavier than it should've. Cold, like it had just been pulled from the dirt.

I pushed it into the lock.

And turned.

We stood still for a moment-Mabel and I-beneath the slanted shadow of the grocery store's side wall. The metal propane cage clicked open under my hand, the sound too loud, too final. It echoed off the pavement like a bell tolling in some long-forgotten church.

Still no sound from inside.

No creak of the back door.

No slick echo of polished shoes dragging across linoleum like bones on tile.

Mr. Stantsman hadn't followed.

He trusted me. That trust settled like rot between my ribs. He thought I was still his. Still inside the rhythm of his world. Another cog in the machine he'd greased with centuries of memory.

Good.

Let him think it.

It bought us this-this thin, shivering sliver of time. This breathless gap before the storm, where everything balanced on the edge of a match head.

Mabel's dress caught the wind again. That same faint flutter. This time it sounded like a whisper-like something exhaling behind us. I didn't turn around. I didn't want to see if the store was watching.

We moved like dancers on a stage where the walls could blink.

The van's doors opened with a groan too loud for comfort. I winced. We both did. But no one came.

Inside was everything we had left that hadn't been taken by this place-three bags, some boxes, a road map curled in the glovebox. There was no room for doubt in there. No room for guilt.

I stepped aside, letting Mabel shove her apron deep into a corner like it was soaked in something that could follow us. She stood straight after, eyes wide, face pale-but not from fear.

From clarity.

She looked back toward the building. Then at me.

""Are you ready?"" she whispered.

I nodded. My mouth was too dry for words.

The wind picked up again-sharp, sour, the way copper smells right before it rusts. The air shifted around us. Grew thick. Aware.

The building hummed louder. Not just light buzz. Not just old wiring.

It was alive.

The fluorescent sign flickered once, then again, stuttering like a heart trying to restart. I could swear the walls groaned-a subtle, sick sound, like wood too soaked to stand was sagging in its bones.

We both turned toward the back door.

It waited. Just a few yards away. A rectangle of peeling paint and rusted hinges. Closed.

For now.

I reached into my coat pocket and pulled it out-the lighter. Cool, metallic, weighty for something so small. My thumb brushed over the striker, but I didn't flick it. Not yet.

I turned to Mabel, meeting her eyes. They weren't frightened anymore. Just wide. Steady. Like she had already stepped past fear and found something sharper on the other side.

Silently, I extended my hand.

She looked down at the lighter in my palm. For a moment, she didn't move.

Then she took it.

Her fingers brushed mine-cold, trembling-and closed around the lighter like it was sacred. Like it was her final rite.

No words passed between us. None needed to.

It was hers now too.

Our weapons were litless, but ready.

Two lighters.

Two girls.

One secret too dangerous to leave standing.

Behind us, the store loomed. Still and silent, but not asleep. No, it was never asleep. You could feel it listening, breathing through its shelves and walls and humming fluorescent veins. Waiting to feed again.

It didn't know we were about to starve it.

Mabel tucked the lighter into her coat, her jaw clenched.

Then she turned toward the building.

We walked side by side, like a procession. A funeral march-for a creature pretending to be a man, for a store pretending to be a place of business, for a town that forgot itself just to survive.

And as we stepped closer to the back door, I whispered the only words that mattered:

""This time... we don't leave anything behind.""

Slowly, with the hush of a secret being whispered to the dark, we twisted off the caps of the gas containers. The scent hit us instantly-sharp, stinging, metallic. It curled in the back of my throat, clinging to the air like a warning.

We nodded once.

And then we split.

Mabel veered left. I went right.

The gas sloshed inside the cans with each step, heavy and purposeful. I tilted mine, letting the liquid splash in wide arcs against the foundation of the building. The concrete drank it greedily. I didn't hold back.

Around us, the world was too still.

Not a bird. Not a breath of wind. Just the faint, almost imperceptible hum of the store behind its walls-like it knew what we were doing.

I kept going. Past the side entrance. Past the receiving door. Past the tiny cracked window where I once caught a glimpse of something watching me from the dark.

Gas trailed behind me like a ribbon of intent. I splashed some higher-on the siding, on the window frame. I could almost imagine it sizzling, like the store was flinching.

When I rounded the corner and saw Mabel again, her can nearly empty too, my hands were shaking.

We met at the front. No words. Just understanding.

She set her empty can down.

I did the same.

We stood in front of the door-the door-the one that had opened so many times to so many unknowing people.

And for the first time... we weren't going in.

We were locking it out.

We both pulled out the lighters, fingers trembling. The metal was cold, but in my palm it felt like it burned-like the weight of everything we were about to do had somehow transferred into that small flame.

Our eyes locked. No words. Just a silent promise.

A nod.

A breath.

Flick.

The flames sparked alive, tiny and defiant in the thickening night.

Time slowed.

We tossed the flames-two deadly sparks arcing through the air.

For a moment, nothing.

Then-

WHOOMPH!

The fire roared to life, snapping and crackling, racing across the spilled gasoline like a living beast unleashed. The walls caught first, then the windows. The smell of burning wood and plastic filled the air, sharp and suffocating.

The store screamed in firelight, shadows twisting wildly against the smoke-choked sky.

My heart slammed against my ribs, pounding louder than the blaze.

We didn't look back.

Not even once.

Feet pounding pavement, lungs burning, we ran-two desperate souls fleeing a nightmare finally set free.

Mabel slipped silently into the back of the van, her breaths still ragged, heart pounding in the heavy silence between us. The weight of what we'd done settled on her shoulders like a shroud.

I climbed into the driver's seat, hands shaking just slightly as they gripped the steering wheel. The van's engine growled low and steady-our only shield against the eerie quiet outside.

The fire behind us roared, a distant beast devouring the night, sending tongues of orange and crimson flickering against the dark sky. Smoke curled upward, thick and choking, blurring the edges of the burning store into a ghostly silhouette.

The street was empty. The town held its breath-watching, waiting-as if it knew this was just the beginning.

I glanced in the rearview mirror, catching the flicker of flame reflecting in Mabel's wide eyes, the same mix of fear and fierce hope that I felt burning inside me.

With a deep breath, I shifted the van into gear and pressed down on the gas, driving us forward-away from the ashes, away from the past, chasing a fragile promise of freedom that felt both distant and desperately close.

Flames clawed hungrily at the night, devouring the building in a furious blaze. The heat was a distant roar behind us, but the glow painted the sky in angry streaks of red and gold.

Ash drifted down like dark snow, settling thick and heavy on the van's roof and windshield. It stuck to the glass in grimy patches, swirling in the cold air with every gust.

Inside, the scent of smoke was sharp and biting, creeping in through the cracked windows, reminding us that what we left behind was gone for good.

I wiped at the windshield, my fingers trembling, eyes fixed on the road ahead even as the weight of what we'd done pressed down on us like the falling ash.

Mabel sat silently beside me, her face illuminated by the dying firelight, a flicker of something fragile-hope? relief?-in her eyes.

The town was fading behind us, swallowed slowly by smoke and shadow.

And for the first time in a long time, the road ahead felt open.

We drove. Drove through winding roads shrouded in the thick night, the van's headlights cutting through the darkness like twin beacons. The air inside was heavy-charged with a mixture of fear, relief, and something fragile: hope.

Every mile put distance between us and the burning ruin behind, every turn steering us further from the nightmare we'd escaped.

Then, just ahead, a weathered wooden sign emerged from the gloom, lit faintly by the van's flickering lights.

""Now Leaving Whistlemoore.""

The words felt like a benediction.

I blinked back a lump in my throat as the weight of years-the memories, the fear, the suffocating silence-began to lift.

Beside me, Mabel exhaled a breath she'd been holding for what felt like forever.

For a moment, the world was still.

And we were free.

Truly free.

But we didn't stop. Not yet. The miles unraveled beneath the tires like a dark ribbon, twisting endlessly ahead. The van's headlights cut through the thickening fog that clung to the edges of the road, swallowing everything in shadow. Every mile put more distance between us and the nightmare we'd left behind - the smoldering ruin of the store, the town that let it breathe, the creature with the crooked smile.

The acrid scent of smoke still clung to the air, settling like a ghost in the van's cramped cabin. Our hands trembled, hearts pounding in sync with the engine's low growl. We dared not speak, afraid words would shatter the fragile calm.

Hours bled into a long, restless night, the darkness pressing close, heavy with unspoken fears.

When dawn finally broke, pale and uncertain, it revealed the road stretching on forever ahead, empty and silent.

Then, there it was.

A small wooden sign, half-crumbled and weathered, leaning into the breeze:

""Spring Hill.""

The letters were faded but still clear - a whispered promise of new beginnings.

We crossed the line slowly, the weight of what we'd done settling deeper with every heartbeat.

We were met with faces-real faces. Warm, smiling, alive. No hollow shells, no glazed eyes watching from behind cracked windows. Here, people greeted us with a nod, a wave, a curious but kind glance.

The streets breathed with life. Children's laughter echoed from a nearby park. Dogs barked playfully. Lawns were neatly trimmed, gardens bloomed in bursts of color, and porches held rocking chairs gently swaying in the morning breeze.

The houses stood proud and well-kept-paint bright and fresh, windows shining clear in the sunlight. This wasn't a place caught in time or trapped beneath some creeping shadow. This was real.

Hope stirred quietly in my chest.

Maybe here, in Spring Hill, we could finally exhale.

Maybe here, the past would stay buried.

Maybe here, we could be free.

We drove on, leaving the main street behind as the town's cheerful bustle gave way to quieter lanes lined with modest apartment buildings.

Eventually, we pulled up in front of a small, brick complex tucked beneath towering oaks whose branches swayed gently, casting dancing shadows in the late afternoon light.

The apartment complex was small and cute, almost like a cluster of cheerful cottages huddled together. Each unit wore its own splash of color - soft blues, warm yellows, and gentle greens - bright but faded just enough to feel lived-in, welcoming rather than new. Flower boxes hung beneath windows, bursting with blooms that swayed lightly in the breeze, and the gentle hum of life buzzed softly around us - distant laughter, a dog barking, the clink of dishes from an open window.

It was the kind of place that promised safety, normalcy, and something close to peace. A sharp contrast to the shadows and silence we'd fled. Here, beneath the wide sky and amid the colors and sounds, we might finally find the freedom we had been chasing.

We stepped inside and the manager handed us the keys-34 B. The door was painted a gentle, faded pink that somehow felt both comforting and hopeful. The apartment was small but cozy: two modest rooms, simple furnishings left behind by the last tenant, and sunlight filtering through lace curtains, casting soft patterns on the worn wooden floor.

We tossed our bags onto the floor, the weight of them suddenly feeling lighter in this new place. The air smelled faintly of lavender and old paper, a world away from the stale, heavy atmosphere we'd escaped.

For a moment, we just stood there-two girls clutching each other's hands, breathing in the quiet, daring to believe we might finally be free.

Our stomachs growled, loud and undeniable in the quiet apartment. I laughed softly, breaking the silence.

""Wanna hit the store? Get some food. Maybe some other stuff. We're in a new home now,"" I joked, trying to lighten the weight still hanging in the air.

Mabel smiled-a real smile this time-and nodded.

We headed back out to the van, the late afternoon sun casting long shadows behind us. The streets felt different here, softer somehow. Alive. Hopeful.

For the first time in a long while, the future didn't feel like a threat. It felt like a possibility.

We drove down streets lined with beautiful restaurants, cozy coffee shops, and quaint bread bakeries, their windows fogged gently from warm ovens inside. Tire shops and small boutiques dotted the blocks, all gleaming clean and well-kept under the soft glow of the afternoon sun.

People strolled along the sidewalks, chatting easily with neighbors, laughing as children darted between them. The hum of life-so ordinary, so vibrant-washed over us like a balm, a stark contrast to the heavy silence we'd left behind.

Here, the air smelled of fresh bread and blooming flowers, not memories and shadows.

It was a town that breathed. That lived. And for the first time in forever, we felt like we belonged.

I slammed the brakes harder than I meant to. The van jerked, tires squealing against the pavement. Mabel lurched in her seat with a startled yelp, grabbing the dashboard.

""What-Marie?""

But I couldn't answer. My mouth had gone dry. My heart was pounding like it wanted to claw its way out of my chest.

I was staring. Hand raised. Finger trembling as I pointed.

""Mabel... am I seeing that?""

She followed my gaze.

Between a cheerful little caf√© boasting daily soup specials and a modern hardware shop with shining glass windows and potted plants out front... it stood.

Worn. Out of place.
A building with chipped boards and faded green trim. A single cracked window covered in grime. The wood siding buckled with age. The awning sagged like tired shoulders.

And there-painted sloppily, too red, too bold, too familiar-was a sign that simply read:

Grocery.

My stomach turned.

Mabel's breath hitched beside me.

We hadn't even moved in yet.
We hadn't escaped.

The store was here.

It had followed us.

Through the grimy glass, a figure stood - tall and thin, almost skeletal in frame. His bald head caught the dull light, gleaming like bone. His grin stretched unnaturally wide, teeth unnervingly sharp, glinting like knives in the shadowed doorway.

He waved slowly, deliberately, fingers curling and uncurling as if pulling invisible threads. His eyes-too bright, too empty-locked onto us, piercing through the glass like cold blades.

He beckoned us inside with a crooked finger, the motion both inviting and sinister, like a spider luring prey into its web.

The van's engine idled behind me, a distant hum beneath the creeping weight of dread pooling in my chest.

Mabel's hand tightened on my arm.

But the man's smile never wavered.

And the store waited - patient, hungry, eternal.

Once you make a deal with the store-with a Mnemosith-there is no escape. No thread to pull you back through the tangled web of shadows you thought you'd left behind.

The bargain sinks into you like a slow, dark rot, wrapping tight around your mind and soul. It twists your memories into iron chains, each one heavier than the last, binding you to a fate you never chose.

It speaks in soft, honeyed lies, promising relief, comfort, even power-only to strip away the pieces of yourself that hunger for freedom.

The price isn't just counted in coins or time. It is measured in fragments of who you are: laughter, love, hope, and dreams-all sacrificed beneath its cold gaze.

And when the store's hunger finally settles, it doesn't just take what you have-it takes you.

A husk wandering the aisles, lost between past and present, a ghost doomed to feed the insatiable hunger of the Mnemosith forevermore.

There is no leaving. No undoing. Only the endless echo of memories fading into oblivion, swallowed by the darkness that waits behind every creaking door.

On the other end of the line, Victor Powell's father, Albert Powell, asked, ""Seri, are you sure you want to terminate the agreement and divorce Victor?""

Serena Powell held her phone calmly. ""I'm sure.""

""Even if Leon's custody goes to the Powell family, you're still leaving?""

""Yes. I believe Leon would rather stay with his dad. The Powell family can give him the best education. He doesn't need me anymore.""

Albert's voice was low. ""Alright. As for the divorce agreement, you can talk to Victor yourself.""

""Okay,"" Serena replied.

Albert didn't hang up right away. ""To be honest, I've been satisfied with how Victor's been these past few years with you around.

""So, as a reward, I'll arrange for you to join the design team in Glonia you've always wanted. In a week at most, you'll be out of the Powell family.""

Serena thought, 'A reward? Rich people really do live in a different universe. In their world, even feelings come with a price tag.'

She agreed. After she hung up, her phone screen was still frozen on a recent Instagram post from her husband, Victor.

Victor had been posting bits and pieces of his daily life for over a month now, but this was the first time Serena had seen them. He had never accepted her friend request on his private account‚Äîuntil now.

In the newest video, their son Leon Powell was playing happily with another kid around his age. The ironic part was, everyone in the comments thought Serena was the one who filmed it.

Someone commented: \[Your wife's really good with the camera. Your son looks so happy.\]

Victor's reply stood out like a slap: \[Yeah.\]

Serena thought, 'Yeah? Is he praising Eliza Stone, his childhood sweetheart, for her camera work, or is he just letting people assume she's his wife now?'

\*\*\*\*\*

Serena grew up in an orphanage. Seven years ago, when she was still in college, Albert suddenly approached her and offered her three million dollars‚Äîto buy seven years of her life.

To pay for surgery for the orphanage director who had been kind to her, Serena reluctantly agreed.

Back then, she had already heard the story of Victor and Eliza. Both of them came from powerful families, grew up together as childhood sweethearts, and were deeply in love. But the year they graduated college, Eliza suddenly vanished without a trace.

When Victor found out Eliza had gone abroad for an arranged marriage, he completely lost it. He started drinking, smoking, and pushing himself to the edge, spiraling into serious psychological issues.

The psychiatrist once said only emotional healing could cure a wounded heart.

To save his nearly deranged son, Albert found Serena, who looked strikingly similar to Eliza, and had her care for Victor to heal his emotional wounds.

From then on, Serena began to get close to Victor on purpose, relentlessly pursuing him. She had that rare mix of innocence and allure. And with a face that looked just enough like Eliza's, she made sure to stay in Victor's sight every single day.

When he was down, she would cheer him up. When he got sick, she stayed up all night to look after him. And when his depression hit, she was the only one who ever reached into the darkness and pulled him back.

With time, Victor gradually got used to having Serena around.

Until one day, Serena caught him in the middle of a breakdown, about to slit his wrists. She grabbed the sharp blade with her bare hand and forced it out of his grip.

Her hand was sliced open, the cut deep and long, bleeding uncontrollably. The doctor said if it'd gone any deeper, she would've lost the use of her hand. Because the wound was so severe, even after it healed, a jagged scar remained across her palm.

That was the first time Victor hugged her. ""Seri, let's get married. Okay? Let's go to city hall tomorrow,"" he said.

Serena stood frozen, thinking it was her sincerity that had moved him. But later, when she found Eliza's wedding invitation tucked in a drawer, she realized it had all happened on Eliza's wedding day.

Less than two years after they got married, Serena gave birth to Leon. During those two years, Victor wasn't particularly affectionate, but he treated her with respect. Also, Leon was very close to her‚Äîhe clung to her more than he did to Victor.

Serena had feelings, after all. She had already come to see this place as her home. She loved both Victor and Leon deeply. It wasn't about the black-and-white contract anymore. She truly wanted to be with them for the rest of her life.

So for the sake of her family, Serena gave up her dream of being an accomplished designer and became a full-time housewife.

During the day, she cleaned the house. At noon, she brought lunch to Victor. In the evening, after picking Leon up, she cooked dinner for him. At night, she still had to meet Victor's needs in bed.

She was like a machine that never stopped working year-round, quietly and tirelessly taking care of her husband and son for five straight years.

Serena used to think things would just continue like that. But a month ago, Eliza came back. She was divorced and brought her son with her.

When Victor found out, he rushed to the airport without an umbrella, ignoring the heavy rain. He could even forgive everything Eliza had done in the past, as if none of it mattered anymore.

He thought Serena didn't know. But she knew everything. Over the past week, Victor had grown more and more impatient with her. He started treating her like a servant, barking orders at her. Even Leon had become cold and harsh toward her.

Serena had argued with them and fought back, but they called her ungrateful and narrow-minded. Then, in the next moment, they gave all their tenderness to Eliza.

Serena only found out about this through Instagram. Ironically, Victor never posted on Instagram. Even back when they got married, he refused to let her announce it on the app, saying it was their private life and he didn't want outsiders to know.

But ever since Eliza came back, Victor's Instagram had been full of pictures of the four of them‚Äîhim, Leon, Eliza, and her son. They all looked so warm and loving, as if they were the real family.

That was how Serena learned that when she was sick, Victor and Leon were out shopping with Eliza. When she was heartbroken, Victor and Leon were celebrating Eliza's birthday.

Even yesterday, on their wedding anniversary, Victor and Leon ignored the dinner Serena had spent the whole day preparing and walked out the door‚Äîjust to be with Eliza. When Serena tried to stop them, they told her she was being dramatic.

Serena thought, 'I should've realized it a long time ago. There's no place for me in this family anymore. I actually believed I could move beyond that contract and stay with them forever‚ÄîI was being delusional. It's time to wake up and leave.'

She took a deep breath and wiped the tears from the corner of her eyes with a cold hand.

Just then, the sound of the front door opening came from outside. Victor and Leon were back, the chill of the wind and rain still clinging to them as they came in.

""Seri, Leon fell and got hurt. Take care of his wound,"" Victor said, his voice low and steady, calm as always, automatically slipping into that usual commanding tone.

""I don't want her to do it. She never shuts up and nags the whole time."" Leon's brows were furrowed tightly, his face full of annoyance. ""I want Eliza to do it. I want to call Eliza.""

""The weather's too bad. Eliza can't make it,"" Victor answered, stepping inside indifferently, his voice flat. ""Be good. Let your mom handle it.""

""Okay, fine."" Leon looked disappointed and reluctant, his head drooping as he slumped onto the couch.

When he looked up and saw Serena still hadn't brought the first-aid kit over and was actually turning to walk away like she hadn't even heard them, his temper exploded. He shouted impatiently, ""Can you hurry up? What's with you today? So slow and annoying.""

# 2.Chapter 2 Out Of Character

Serena turned to look at Leon, her eyes filled with coldness. ""That's how you talk to your own mother?"" she questioned.

Leon was startled by her reaction, completely thrown off. This was the first time Serena had ever spoken to him like that.

Even Victor paused and looked over, a trace of surprise in his eyes.

Leon shouted, ""What's your problem? You're the one who's standing there doing nothing. If it weren't raining and Eliza couldn't come, I wouldn't even need you‚Äî""

Serena cut in, ""Fine. Since you adore Eliza so much, then wait for her to take care of it.""

Leon froze, staring at Serena in disbelief as she walked away.

In the past, whenever he got hurt, Serena would panic, fuss over him, hug him, comfort him‚Äîbut today was completely different. She just left.

Victor was a little surprised too, but didn't think much of it. He frowned at Leon and said, ""Leon, you need to learn how to handle difficulties in life without letting your emotions get the best of you.""

\*\*\*\*\*

In the bathroom, Serena stared blankly at the toiletries on the sink.

For the past few years, neither Victor nor Leon had ever had to squeeze their own toothpaste. She always got up a few minutes earlier to adjust the water temperature just right and lay out all their toiletries ahead of time.

She still remembered one time when the water had been too hot, and Victor snapped at her, ""Can't you even get something this simple right?""

Serena looked away. After taking off her clothes, she turned on the shower and let the hot water pour down on her, as if it could wake her up, again and again.

After a long time, she finally turned off the water. The look in her eyes grew more and more resolute. From now on, her life would no longer revolve around her ungrateful husband and son. She was going to live for herself.

When she came out of the bathroom, Leon was in his room. Victor was sitting on the couch, watching that ""family"" video on his phone. The corners of his mouth lifted without him even realizing, a clear sign of how pleased he was.

Serena let out a mocking laugh and walked over to the drawer. She then pulled out the divorce agreement and walked toward Victor. ""Victor, let's get divorced.""

Victor kept his eyes on the video playing on his phone and mumbled, ""Okay.""

Serena placed the divorce papers on the table. ""I'll walk away with nothing. You can have full custody of Leon too.""

Victor was still staring at his phone, seemingly absorbed in the comments under that Instagram post.

""If you don't have any objections, just sign it,"" Serena said.

""Okay."" Victor took the pen Serena handed him. He paused for a second, just as a notification popped up on his phone. Without even glancing at the agreement, he signed his name on the agreement.

Serena asked, ""Victor, did you even hear what I just said to you?""

""What?"" Victor shot her an impatient look, tossed the pen on the table, and leaned back on the couch. ""Isn't it about buying insurance for Leon? Just buy it.""

Serena realized he really hadn't heard a word. All his attention was on his phone. Ever since Eliza came back, she had gotten used to him being like this.

Just then, Victor's phone started ringing. It was a call from Eliza. He quickly turned around and stepped out onto the balcony to answer it.

Serena looked at the signed divorce papers on the table and let out a cold snort.

All it would've taken was one glance‚Äîhe would've seen it had nothing to do with insurance. But he didn't. His mind was filled with nothing but Eliza. He couldn't see anything else.

Serena put the divorce papers away and went back to the bedroom to pack her things.

Just then, the doorbell rang. When Serena opened the door, she was met with a delicate, innocent-looking face. Her heart skipped a beat in her chest.

It was Eliza. Even though Serena had only seen her profile in Victor's Instagram posts, she recognized Eliza instantly.

""You must be Mrs. Powell, right? Sorry to bother you this late,"" Eliza said. Standing next to her was her son, Oliver Stone, each of them holding a suitcase‚Äîone big, one small.

Serena remarked flatly, ""What do you need?""

""Is Victor home?"" Eliza asked.

""Yeah."" Almost the second he heard Eliza's voice, Victor rushed out from inside. ""I told you I'd pick you up. Why'd you come on your own? Come on in before you catch a cold.""

Eliza let out a dry laugh and didn't come in right away. Her eyes landed on Serena as she spoke, ""Mrs. Powell, I'm having some property issues back in the country, so I'll need to stay here for a few days.""

Serena smiled and thought, 'Stay here? Out of everywhere else, she has to move into her ex-boyfriend's house when he's already married? What is this supposed to be, taking over my place already? Making herself at home?'

Before Serena could say anything, Leon came running out of the house, cheering happily. ""Eliza, Ollie, you're finally here,"" he giggled.

He pushed past Serena, excitedly trying to welcome Eliza and Oliver inside.

Eliza greeted Leon but still didn't come in. She kept looking at Serena and asked cautiously, ""Mrs. Powell, I'm really sorry. I don't have many friends back home, so I had no choice but to turn to Victor. You don't mind, do you?""

Serena sneered, ""And if I do mind? Does that mean you're not coming in?""

Eliza clearly hadn't expected Serena to say that. Eliza froze, and before she could say anything, a young voice cut in ahead of her.

""What's your problem?"" Leon immediately stepped in front of Eliza to shield her. ""It doesn't matter if you mind. This is Dad's house.""

Eliza's expression changed. ""Leon, you can't talk to your mom like that. Your dad and your mom are married. That makes this her home too. She's the one who raised you. It hasn't been easy for her, and you should try to understand her.""

""Okay."" Leon lowered his head. Normally, he'd argue back for every word Serena said. But now, because of Eliza's words, he suddenly quieted down. ""I got it.""

Victor went ahead and picked up Eliza's luggage without waiting for Serena's response. ""Come in,"" he remarked.

Eliza looked at Serena apologetically and kept saying, ""Thank you.""

Serena just stood there quietly, watching them. Compared to the rest of them, she felt like she was the outsider here.

Serena scoffed a cold laugh in her heart. She wanted to go back to her room and pack her things, but Leon suddenly stopped her, saying, ""Where are you going? Hurry up and make dinner. Ollie and Eliza probably haven't eaten yet.""

""No, it's fine,"" Eliza said softly, trying to remind him. ""Leon, that's not appropriate.""

""No need. I'll cook today."" Victor was in a good mood and got up from the couch.

Eliza quickly grabbed his arm, then immediately pulled her hand back with a clear sense of boundaries. ""Don't trouble yourself. You guys just go on with what you were doing. I already ate before I came.""

Serena felt nothing but sarcasm inside. She'd known Victor for years. She could count on one hand how many times he'd stepped foot in the kitchen, let alone cooked.

She had always thought Victor simply didn't know how. But now it seemed he just didn't think Serena was worth the effort.

""All right, then I'll help you carry your suitcases to your room,"" Victor said. Since Eliza really didn't want to eat, he didn't insist. His eyes swept toward the bedrooms upstairs, and a trace of hesitation flickered in the depths of his gaze.

There were four bedrooms in the house. One belonged to Leon, one had been turned into a storage room, and the remaining two were his and Serena's.

A year ago, Victor had already suggested that he and Serena sleep in separate rooms.

# 3.Chapter 3 Letting Go

That was why there wasn't any room in this house for Eliza at all.

Just then, Leon suddenly waved his little hand. ""Dad, let Eliza have Mom's room. It's big and bright‚Äîperfect for Eliza and Ollie.""

Victor paused for a second.

Eliza immediately caught the subtle shift in his expression and rushed to speak before he could say anything, ""No, that's not okay. If there's really no space, I'll take Oliver and find somewhere else to stay. I'm so sorry for bothering you.""

""It's no bother,"" Leon said, suddenly pouting. He turned his head and looked at Serena with urgency and grievance, raising his voice. ""Say something. What, you lost your voice today?""

Serena looked into Leon's eyes, full of blame. ""If Eliza takes my room, then where am I supposed to sleep?"" she questioned.

Leon puffed out his cheeks, clearly indifferent, his face turning red as he shouted like it was the most obvious thing in the world, ""The storage room has a bed. Just sleep there.

""You should be glad you even have a place to stay. Why are you being so picky?""

Hearing that, Eliza looked troubled. She stepped forward slightly, her eyes full of sincerity and apology.

She looked at Leon as she spoke gently, ""Leon, I'm a guest. Your mom is the host. How could I take the host's room? I'm already thankful she's letting me stay here. Oliver and I aren't going to be picky.""

Eliza turned to look at Oliver, who had been quiet the whole time. ""Right, Oliver?""

Oliver gave a calm nod.

""Well, Ms. Stone, you really know your place,"" Serena replied evenly, going along with her. ""So you all can figure out another plan for the room.""

Serena had swallowed her pride for years. She wasn't going to back down anymore.

Hearing that, Leon was furious. ""You're such a wretch. I knew you didn't really want Eliza to stay. You're so annoying.""

He put his little fists on his hips. ""But don't even think about kicking Eliza out. I'll just sleep with Dad, and Eliza and Ollie can have my room.""

Victor's eyes lit up. ""That works. It's settled then.""

Leon happily pushed the suitcases toward the elevator, and Victor led Eliza and Oliver to Leon's room.

Once again, Serena was the extra one. She was used to it. She went back to her room and started packing.

Not long after, Eliza came in with a cup of hot coffee in her hands. ""Mrs. Powell, may I come in? Are you packing for something? Going out?""

Serena didn't respond. She couldn't exactly tell Eliza she was leaving.

Eliza said, ""Leon poured this coffee for you. He may be little, but he's got a lot of pride. He was too embarrassed to bring it in himself.""

Serena didn't believe for a second that Leon had poured that coffee for her.

If Eliza hadn't shown up, maybe Serena would've believed it. But the Leon now hated Serena too much to even get her a cup of coffee.

Serena said, ""Ms. Stone, you don't need to smooth things over between me and Leon. The four of you living happily ever after is better than anything else.""

Even though Eliza had played innocent ever since she walked in‚Äîand had even stepped in a few times to help correct Leon‚ÄîSerena didn't believe that was her true colors. Serena's instincts told her Eliza was far from simple.

Eliza bit her lip, looking guilty. ""Mrs. Powell, did I do something to make you misunderstand me?""

She walked over to Serena anxiously. Seeing Serena folding clothes, Eliza quickly reached out and grabbed her hand.

Eliza said, ""Mrs. Powell, if you don't want me to stay, just say it. I can leave. But please don't get the wrong idea about me. I never meant to sabotage your relationship with your family. I really didn't‚Äî""

Serena cut in coldly, ""Let go.""

""I'm begging you, please don't misunderstand me, okay? I'll leave, alright?""

""I said let go.""

Serena had no idea what Eliza was trying to do. Seeing her stubbornly clinging on, Serena yanked her wrist free.

Before Serena could say anything, Eliza, who had been standing just fine, suddenly fell. The hot coffee in her hand spilled onto Serena's skin, instantly turning a large area red.

""Ow!"" Eliza's sharp cry pierced the air.

""What happened?"" Leon and Victor rushed over the moment they heard the noise. The moment they saw the scene in front of them, their expressions suddenly changed.

Victor rushed forward, his eyes tinged red with panic. ""Ellie, are you okay? Are you hurt?""

Eliza raised her hand pitifully. Her delicate skin was now marked with a small red burn. ""Victor, it's my fault. I shouldn't have come today. I upset Mrs. Powell. Please don't blame her.""

Victor turned to glare at Serena, his eyes filled with anger. ""Why did you do this? Ellie's just here to stay for a couple days.

""It was already bad enough how you kept giving her a hard time, but now you actually laid hands on her?""

Instantly blamed for something she didn't do, Serena was shaking with rage, knowing full well she'd just been set up. But her mind went blank. She blurted out the truth, ""She fell on purpose.""

Serena had thought Victor still had some ability to tell right from wrong. But not only did he lack that now, his face darkened even more.

He yelled, ""Serena. How can you be so cruel? Why would Ellie fall on her own for no reason? You did it, just admit it. You've really let me down.""

He scooped Eliza into his arms and rushed to the living room to apply medicine to her burn.

Even Leon pointed at Serena's face and cursed her out, screaming, ""You're such a wretch. I hate you. You're evil and disgusting. You don't deserve to be my mom. Just die already. Stop ruining things between Dad and Eliza.""

Serena shoved him away, her breathing heavy. ""Leon Powell, you little brat, say that again.""

Leon lost his balance and fell to the floor, tears welling up in his eyes. ""You wretch, I don't love you anymore. I hate you."" With that, he took off running.

Serena's fingers trembled. It was the first time she had ever spoken harshly to Leon, but she didn't regret it. She took it as her last lesson to him as his mother.

Just then, a dull pain throbbed on the back of her hand. Serena lowered her eyes and looked at the large burn across it, then laughed.

Eliza had only gotten a few drops on her and Victor was already that worked up. But Serena was hurt far worse, and no one cared.

Serena's throat moved with a deep swallow as she walked alone to the bathroom to run cold water over her hand.

The water was colder than usual, and the twisted, jagged scar in her palm seemed even more noticeable now.

Outside, she heard Leon's cheerful voice. ""Yay. We're going out to eat. Daddy's the best. Ellie's the best too. I wish every day could be like this,"" he laughed.

""Victor, are you sure Mrs. Powell won't be upset we're not taking her?"" Eliza asked.

Victor said, ""She won't be. And even if she is, she'll get over it by the time we're back.""

Serena turned the faucet up to full blast, drowning out their voices from the living room.

After a long while, she suddenly shut off the water with a loud clack and walked straight into the bedroom, her steps firm and unwavering.

Serena thought, 'I'll get over it? No, Victor. You're never going to see me again. I'll let you guys be together.'

# 4.Chapter 4 Misunderstood

""Today was so much fun. Eliza, I want to go again tomorrow,"" Leon said excitedly, tugging Eliza's hand as they walked into the living room.

Eliza reached out to pat Leon's head, her smile bright. ""Of course, Leon. If there's something you want to do, I'll definitely take you. But everything I let you eat today was just the kind of stuff Oliver eats all the time. Nothing special.""

Leon pouted and started complaining, ""My mom never lets me eat those things. Eliza, you don't even know how jealous I am of the other kids. Their moms are way better than her.""

Serena had just come out of the bathroom and heard the entire conversation. She walked down from the second floor, and the moment she looked up, she saw the ketchup still smeared on the corner of Leon's mouth.

Serena asked sharply, ""If you knew I don't let you eat that stuff, why did you still eat it?""

Leon looked up at the sound of her voice. The moment he saw Serena, his face turned sour.

Eliza spoke up, sounding apologetic, ""I'm sorry, Mrs. Powell. I didn't know you don't usually let Leon eat that kind of stuff. But it's really no big deal once in a while. Oliver eats it too.""

Serena snorted, ""Fast food is junk‚Äîloaded with fat and salt. It causes weight gain. Leon has a sensitive stomach. What makes you think it's no big deal? Or do you just assume everyone's like you people?""

Eliza's expression stiffened slightly.

Leon shot back, ""I've never eaten fast food before. It's just this once because Eliza brought me along. If you want to blame someone, blame me. Don't take it out on her.""

Leon's automatic defense of Eliza made Serena feel bitterly ironic. After everything Serena had done to take care of him, all it took was one fast food meal from Eliza to win him over.

Eliza explained patiently, ""Mrs. Powell, I understand how you feel as a mom. I'm a mom too. It's normal that kids like fast food. It's not like they eat it all the time.

""Plus, Leon is fine right now. I just think maybe sometimes you don't need to be so strict with him.""

Serena sneered, ""Really? And if something did happen, would you take responsibility?""

""Eliza would never be as stingy as you. Ollie eats this stuff all the time and he's fine. You just can't stand seeing me happy."" With that, Leon wiped his tears angrily and ran upstairs.

Seeing Leon run upstairs, Victor lost his temper and snapped, ""Serena, was it really necessary to blow up over something so small?

""Ellie was just being kind. If you didn't keep telling Leon what he can and can't eat, he wouldn't crave junk food so much.""

They all acted like it was Serena's fault. She didn't bother arguing and turned to leave. She thought, 'Since Victor, as Leon's father, doesn't care, why should I go out of my way to cause trouble for myself?'

Back in her room, Serena packed up her things and thought, 'Just a little longer. Once I get through this, I won't have anything to do with this family ever again.'

\*\*\*\*\*

Early the next morning, just as Serena was waking up, she heard a knock at the door. Before she could respond, the door was already pushed open.

Eliza walked in with a smile, holding a glass of milk. ""Mrs. Powell, Victor took the kids out. He asked me to let you know you don't need to prepare any meals for us today.""

Serena didn't even glance at her. She turned and sat down at the vanity, calmly taking off the bracelet from her wrist.

""I'm not interested in any of that. You don't need to tell me. And Ms. Stone, didn't anyone ever teach you to knock and wait for permission before entering someone else's room?"" Serena remarked.

Eliza's fingers tightened slightly around the glass, her knuckles turning pale. ""I'm sorry, Mrs. Powell. I wasn't thinking. I just felt like maybe there's been a misunderstanding between us.

""When I had issues with my house, Victor invited me to stay here. I didn't think too much at the time. But don't worry. Once my place is fixed, I'll leave with Oliver right away.""

Serena could hear the provocation in Eliza's words. ""Eliza, there's no one else around right now. You don't need to keep pretending. Do you think that act of yours still works?"" Serena turned and looked her straight in the eye.

""Mrs. Powell, I'm not sure what you mean,"" Eliza said as she sat down on a stool across from her. She set the glass of milk on the table, rested her chin on her right hand, and put on a troubled expression.

She continued, ""I thought you were smart. When you saw me come back, I figured you'd know better and leave.

""I know the Powell family has a lot of money, and you want to stay a bit longer to get a bigger cut. But think about it‚Äîdo you really believe someone like Victor would give you anything?""

Now that Eliza had dropped the act, Serena smirked coldly. She had no interest in the Powell family's money. But now, she was genuinely curious about why Eliza had come back to the country.

Serena asked, ""Eliza, if you chose to leave Victor back then, why come back now? Is it because your ex-husband's broke?""

Eliza's face darkened. Her hand clenched slightly, but after a pause, she let out a breath. ""Serena, stop trying to get a read on me. It won't be long before Vic divorces you. You'd better start thinking about how you're going to live after that.""

As she spoke, the smile on her face grew wider. ""I've only spent a few days with Leon and he already adores me this much. There's no way he'll choose you.""

It felt like a sharp knife stabbed straight into Serena's heart. She thought, 'If even the son I gave birth to prefers another woman, then so be it. I don't want anything anymore.'

Sensing the shift in Serena's emotions, Eliza got an idea. She stood up, walked over, and snatched the emerald bracelet Serena had just put away.

The emerald bracelet was high-quality, clearly expensive, and easily worth millions of dollars. Eliza hadn't expected the Powell family to give Serena something this valuable.

""You're not allowed to touch that."" Serena reached out to take it back, but Eliza dodged her and stepped away.

Eliza turned the emerald bracelet over in her hands, clearly amused. ""So this bracelet's enough to make you lose control. No wonder you're clinging to the Powell family like your life depends on it. Let me help you out.""

Eliza's expression shifted instantly as she suddenly hurled the emerald bracelet to the floor. Even with carpet underfoot, the bracelet still snapped apart.

Serena's expression changed. She rushed over in a panic, picked up the broken emerald bracelet from the floor, and looked it over carefully. Only when she saw that it was still salvageable did she calm down.

With proper jewelry repair, it should be possible to restore it. When Serena returned it later, at least she'd have something to show for it.

Eliza stood there, looking down with open disdain and contempt in her eyes. ""You really are pathetic. Sorry. But since it's already broken, I'll throw it out for you.""

Caught off guard, Serena let Eliza snatch the bracelet away.

The emerald bracelet was only broken into two pieces‚Äîthere was still hope to get it repaired. But if Eliza damaged it further, there would be no way to fix it.

Serena's eyes turned cold as ice. She stepped in front of Eliza at the top of the stairs. ""Eliza, give me the bracelet.""

Eliza glanced toward the front door and heard the sound of Victor returning with the kids.

Just as the door opened, Eliza suddenly grabbed Serena's hand. Tears streamed down Eliza's face, and her voice trembled with sorrow as she said, ""Mrs. Powell, it's all my fault.""

# 5.Chapter 5 Framed

A flash of malice and calculation passed through Eliza's eyes. The next second, she suddenly threw herself backward. Her face was filled with shock and fear as she tumbled down the stairs.

""Ellie."" Victor rushed forward and cradled Eliza in his arms. ""Ellie, are you okay?""

Eliza weakly reached out and grabbed his sleeve. ""Vic, don't blame Mrs. Powell. It's my fault. I shouldn't have upset her.""

Serena walked down the stairs and saw Eliza putting on a show. She said, ""She broke my emerald bracelet and tried to run. I didn't push her. She fell on her own.""

Leon started shouting at Serena like crazy, ""You wretch. Why are you so mean?""

Victor's rage exploded. He stood up and slapped Serena across the face. The sound echoed through the villa. The burning pain spread quickly across her cheek, snapping her back to reality.

Serena's lips trembled slightly. Tears welled in her eyes but stubbornly refused to fall. ""I said I didn't push Eliza.""

Looking at her expression, Victor faltered for a moment. ""Seri, what's happening between us has nothing to do with Ellie. Why would you take it out on her?""

""I told you I didn't. She's the one who broke my emerald bracelet first,"" Serena said.

""Victor."" Eliza looked at him through teary eyes. ""Vic, don't blame Mrs. Powell anymore. It's all my fault. I accidentally broke her emerald bracelet. That's why she got so upset. Victor, I'm hurting all over.""

Only then did Victor snap out of it and remember Eliza had fallen down the stairs. He didn't have time to argue with Serena. He quickly carried Eliza out to take her to the hospital.

In just a few minutes, the huge villa was completely empty‚ÄîSerena was the only one left.

Her cheek was swollen and red. Not a single person cared about her injury. They had all rushed Eliza to the hospital to take care of her. To Serena, the whole thing felt like a joke.

\*\*\*\*\*

At the hospital, Eliza lay weakly on the bed. Victor held her hand with concern and said, ""Good thing the injuries aren't too serious. I really didn't expect Serena to go that far‚Äîactually pushing you down the stairs.""

Seeing that Victor had taken the bait, Eliza hid the satisfaction in her eyes and put on a gentle, understanding expression. ""Victor, this whole thing is really my fault. It has nothing to do with Mrs. Powell.""

Victor replied, ""Ellie, I know you just don't want me to fight with her, but what she did was way out of line. I think she really meant to get you killed.""",1,1752474676.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1lzf2yb,https://i.redd.it/eh1z2vjd9scf1.png,Your Employee in the Car? Screw Off! My Billionaire Best Friend Is My Groom Now,"I leaned against the wall, carefully cradling my six-month bump as I waited for my prenatal checkup.



Once the scheduled examination was done, I planned to visit my husband Aiden‚Äîmaybe we could head home together.



After all, the rain was coming down hard outside. The rideshare app showed nearly 200 people ahead of me in the queue, and my phone signal kept cutting out sporadically.



Aiden wasn't scheduled for specialist clinic duty today, but one of his team's doctor colleagues had called in sick last minute. So he'd been forced to cover a half-day shift.



The heavy smell of disinfectant in the hospital corridors mixed with the damp scent of the downpour outside, making me nauseous.



The waiting area was packed. Children crying, anxious inquiries, nurses trying to maintain order‚Äîall the sounds blended together into a headache-inducing chaos.



I found an empty spot on the bench outside the obstetrics office and had just settled down when I spotted Aiden's tall figure emerging from a consultation room.



He wore his crisp white coat, pressed to perfection, his face still bearing the exhaustion from last night's surgery.



But his gaze swept across the crowd with that familiar sharpness and... intensity. This was the Aiden I knew‚Äîcalm, efficient, completely intolerant of chaos or rule-breaking.



As one of the youngest deputy chief cardiologists at a top New York hospital, his professionalism and strict adherence to protocol were practically carved into his bones.



I'd always considered this a strength.



Just as I was about to call out to him, I saw a figure skillfully weaving through the queue, heading straight for Aiden's office.



That silhouette... was that Vera?



I frowned. Vera was an intern who'd joined the department just over a month ago. Young, pretty, always flashing that sweet smile.



My first impression of her at the hospital had been positive‚Äîa breath of youthful energy.



But here was the problem: she shouldn't be anywhere near Aiden.



Or more precisely, she shouldn't be appearing in such a... privileged way.



Because Aiden had a habitual ""rule""‚Äîto avoid unnecessary complications and distractions, all the interns and assistants he worked with were exclusively male.



This wasn't something he'd actively demanded, but after several young female doctors had tried to ""get close"" through various methods‚Äî""accidentally"" spilling water, messing up reports, asking for ""guidance"" until late at night‚ÄîAiden had had enough.



He'd requested that the training office only assign male interns to his team.



Over time, it became an unspoken understanding within the department.



Even the administrative assistants knew to simply leave documents on his desk‚Äîavoiding any accidental contact with Dr. Aiden.



So what was Vera doing here?



""Aiden!"" Vera's voice carried that deliberately soft sweetness. ""Sorry to bother you, but my stomach pain is really severe...""



Aiden turned slightly. I couldn't even catch the change in his expression before I saw him raise his hand to pull open the consultation room door, gesturing for Vera to enter.



Then, facing the patients and their families who'd been waiting outside for ages, he said flatly: ""Please wait. Handling an emergency.""



Complaints erupted immediately.



""Are you kidding me? We've been waiting all morning!""



""Emergency? That girl looked perfectly healthy just now.""



""Yeah, isn't Dr. Aiden supposed to be the most by-the-book guy here? Line-cutting?""



Aiden's expression didn't budge an inch, as if those voices simply didn't exist.



He was about to close the door when his gaze inadvertently swept across the crowd and landed on me in the corner.



For a split second, I saw surprise flash in Aiden's eyes. Then it shifted into something almost imperceptible... annoyance?



But he said nothing. With a sharp ""bang,"" he shut the consultation room door, blocking out everyone's stares.



Chapter 2



My heart plummeted. Ten minutes? Twenty minutes? The consultation room door remained firmly shut.



The complaints outside grew louder, nurses tried to calm people down, but it was no use.



An icy sensation spread through my limbs. Not from the air conditioning‚Äîbut from knowing that behind that closed door lay territory I, as his wife, rarely set foot in, yet another young woman had effortlessly claimed.



Even with Aiden himself breaking the rules.



Finally, the door opened. Vera emerged holding a payment slip, her cheeks flushed, eyes bright‚Äîshowing absolutely no signs of the ""severe abdominal pain"" she'd mentioned earlier.



She walked toward the payment counter with light steps.



As she passed by me, she even shot me a look that carried triumph, almost defiant in its smugness.



Aiden followed, his expression restored to its usual calm, as if he'd never broken any rules at all.



He looked at me, not giving me a chance to speak: ""Almost off duty.



Finished with your checkup? I still have a few patients‚Äîafter that I'll drive you home. Too much rain outside, rideshares are impossible.""



I said nothing.



The crushing disappointment and sense of betrayal left me heartbroken. I followed Aiden silently to his break room to wait.



Every minute of waiting felt endless.



The break room still carried the faint scent of jasmine perfume‚ÄîVera's fragrance from earlier.



I stared at the neatly arranged files on Aiden's desk and the no-smoking sign beside them, remembering that argument from a month ago.



I'd just finished throwing up from morning sickness and felt suddenly hungry.



When I went to see Aiden, I brought only the mildest lemon water‚ÄîI knew how sensitive he was to strong smells.



But when I took a sip in his office, Aiden said coldly: ""Tina, this is a hospital, not a coffee shop. That smell will linger for hours‚Äîit could affect my clinical judgment. Please don't eat or drink anything in here again.""



Just one sip of water. Aiden had used such harsh, cold phrasing as ""affecting judgment.""



And now, Vera, merely an ""intern,"" had not only broken Aiden's rule about working with female interns, but had also been privileged enough to skip the crowded clinic queue and enter his consultation room because of a ""stomach ache""?



Yet her lingering jasmine fragrance‚Äîwouldn't that affect his ""professional judgment""?



When Aiden returned after seeing his last patient, I was standing by the window, watching the storm outside. ""Let's go."" He grabbed his car keys. ""I parked in the basement garage, no need to get soaked.""



The underground garage felt somewhat damp from the storm's penetration. Aiden's black SUV sat in the spacious parking spot.



When I reached the car, Aiden didn't immediately unlock it, instead looking toward the passenger side.



I followed his gaze and saw the passenger door open.



Vera poked her head out, her face a picture of ""surprise"" and ""apology"": ""Tina? Oh my God‚ÄîI'm so sorry! Earlier, Aiden saw I couldn't get a ride and with this terrible rain, he offered to drop me home... I didn't mean to intrude. Aiden, maybe I should sit in the back?""



She pretended to unbuckle her seatbelt to get out, but Aiden simply unlocked the rear doors and said to me: ""Get in.""



Chapter 3



Then Aiden turned back to Vera, his tone noticeably softer, carrying a hint of reassurance he probably wasn't even aware of: ""It's fine, stay put. You're soaked out there.""



Vera sweetly said ""okay"" and settled back into her seat. Her face still wore that apologetic expression, but her eyes betrayed her current smugness.



I supported my bump and awkwardly maneuvered into the back seat. The car started up and smoothly pulled out of the garage. We drove into the storm.



The car shut out the wind and rain, but it couldn't shut out the silence inside. Aiden broke it first, his voice calm: ""Vera's apartment is pretty far. We'll drop her off first.""



I said nothing, and the last shred of hope in my heart completely vanished. From the hospital to our home was normally a ten-minute drive. But Vera's apartment was in the complete opposite direction‚Äîthis ""far"" was definitely not just a little out of the way.



I watched their silhouettes. Vera seemed a bit cold, arms wrapped around herself. Aiden immediately reached over to turn up the heat near the passenger seat.



Vera said something quietly. Aiden tilted his head slightly, actually smiling, and responded in low tones. I clenched my fists, my body trembling involuntarily. Aiden was completely ignoring me.



The warm air from the heater mixed with Vera's jasmine scent, wafting back toward me in waves. Pregnancy had made my sense of smell acute‚Äîin that moment, it made me nauseous.



Instinctively, I cracked the window open slightly. A blast of cold, rain-laden air immediately rushed in. ""Ah!"" Vera let out a shriek from the passenger seat, dramatically hunching her shoulders. ""So cold!""



Aiden glanced at me through the rearview mirror, his eyes showing displeasure: ""It's pouring. Close the window! Getting the car wet makes it smell worse.""



My heart felt like it was being crushed by a giant fist. Three days ago, just because I'd taken that sip of lemon water in his office, he hadn't spoken to me since. But now?



Vera could sit in his passenger seat wearing perfume, enjoying the heat he'd turned up for her. Just because she complained about being cold, Aiden immediately blamed me for opening the window.



Principles? Rules?



Apparently they only applied to me.



A wave of nausea surged from my stomach, the baby kicking hard‚Äîmaybe sensing my emotional turmoil.



I closed my eyes, took a deep breath of the cold air streaming through the window, forcing myself to stay calm. Then I expressionlessly rolled the window back up.



The car returned to its enclosed warmth. But Vera's mood hadn't immediately recovered. She began complaining softly: ""This weather is awful. I should have grabbed a jacket before leaving.""



""Are you hungry?"" Aiden suddenly asked, his voice surprisingly gentle. The car happened to be passing a brightly lit convenience store.



Vera hesitated: ""Well... a little. I always seem to get hungrier when I'm not feeling well...""



Aiden immediately put on his turn signal and smoothly pulled into the convenience store parking lot. Without looking at me, he unbuckled his seatbelt: ""Wait here.""



Rain hammered against Aiden's umbrella as he got out, instantly soaking half his pant legs. He didn't seem to care, heading straight into the store.



A few minutes later, he returned with dampness clinging to him and water droplets on his clothes. He handed Vera a hot cocoa and a paper bag containing a warm cinnamon roll.



""Eat it while it's hot,"" his voice was low and caring. ""Warm your stomach.""



Sweet, buttery, rich cinnamon scent immediately filled the small car interior. I watched Aiden's soaked sleeves and shoulders, watched the concern in his eyes as he handed Vera the food.



In that instant, I gave up completely. I thought of countless late nights when Aiden came home exhausted after surgery, how I'd tiptoe around, not daring to make a sound for fear of disturbing his rest, because he'd said he hated being bothered most of all.



I thought of all his prohibitions: the cleanliness of private spaces, the ban on eating in his office, the strict boundaries in personal relationships... I'd spent nine careful years maintaining all of Aiden's principles.



Turns out, every rule could be broken.
