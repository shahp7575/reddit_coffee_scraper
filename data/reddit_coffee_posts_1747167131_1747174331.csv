First I used Biocaf coffee cleaner to flush out the tubing, and yesterday/today I installed a new gasket, screw + showerhead. Now that I've done this though, the portafilter can't rotate more than a milimeter or 2 after heavy force.

At this point I'd to know if it's okay to continue proceeding with heavy force to get it to rotate more or if I should try something else that avoids damaging the new gasket.",1,1747174225.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I’ve been going through a depressive episode for the past few weeks and have gone a few days here and there without eating or drinking. My bf has offered his help but I almost always tell him not to help me. This is something I’ve always done just because of my personality and how I grew up. I am very independent and don’t feel good about letting people help me (something I have been working on), but when I am in these episodes those feelings get way worse.

I feel like he should know that I am always going to say no when he offers and that if he is going to offer something he should just do it and not give me the option to refuse. When the roles are switched and he is feeling down he often does the same thing I do where he tries to refuse my help. Recently he was very tired and feeling down because he still had lots of chores to do, so I asked him if he wanted me to make him some coffee. He told me no but I made it anyway and it brought his mood up significantly. There have been other situations like this too. At one point he had a very bad day and I asked to make him something to eat or drink, he refused but I got him stuff anyway and he felt way better.

Is it really that crazy of me to feel like he should be doing the same thing? I have asked him in the past to help me more around the house and he has taken me seriously and made an effort to change.

1klyro0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1klyro0/macros_and_weight_loss/,Macros and weight loss,"I started at  5 7 235. Stopped drinking and eating healthier about a month ago. I’m down to 225 and started tracking my macros for the first time this week. 

My goal is to hit 210 in the next 8 weeks. ~2 lbs a week.

Not sure how I’m doing with these meals…am I ontrack? I’d like to course correct before I’m at week 4 and disappointed I’m not losing any weight and falling off the rails.

Breakfast is coffee with a tablespoon of mct. Eating lunch 1pm and again eating dinner around 7pm. Snacking in between once if I’m hungry usually consisting of slice of bread and peanut butter with some fruit.

Here’s what I consume on a typical day (cals are according to Cronometer):

Breakfast: 10oz black coffee w mct 134cal

Lunch: 
turkey taco bowl 573 cal

Dinner: salmon w broccoli and Brussels sprouts 416cal
Skinny cow ice cream sandwich 150 cal

Snack: 
Peanut butter toast 260 cal
Grapes 69 cals

Both meals are meal prepped

Turkey bowl recipe for 5 days:
24 oz turkey ground turkey
450 g bell peppers 
2.5 cups of white rice 
360 grams Canned pinto beans
 360 grams canned black beans

Salmon, Brussels sprouts and broccoli for 4 days:
20 oz salmon
370 g broccoli 
370 grams Brussels sprouts
2 cups white rice 

I’d appreciate if you could give me what I’m overdoing on and what I’m under doing?  My guess is I need to increase my veggie intake and drop the carbs.

Also just to add. I’m pretty overweight so I intense workouts are hard on my joints. This is my current workout regimen:

Walk 3 miles every day

Weightlift 3 days a week(m/w/f): 20 min walk at 3.5 mph and 5 lifting exercises for muscle group I’m working on (M: back/bi W:legs/shoulders F: chest/tri)

According to Apple Watch calories burned:

Lifting sessions burn between 500-600 cals
Walks: ~400 cals

1klyqgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/zerowater/comments/1klyqgu/slow_zero_water_filter_frustration/,Slow Zero Water Filter Frustration,"Like others, I have recently been frustrated with slow ZeroWater filter speeds.  I agree with others who have speculated that changes must have occurred in the design or manufacturing of the filters, as early versions worked faster and more reliably.

My use case for the ZeroWater system revolves around pour-over coffee.  I use the one gallon ZeroWater dispenser, as I need a full gallon of water to combine with a mineral mixture (Third Wave) that balances water for better coffee flavor.  Earlier ZeroWater filters reliably allowed me to filter a full gallon in less than 30 minutes.  I have struggled with newer filters for the last year, as they take hours to filter a full gallon.  This is quite frustrating; babysitting the filter is time consuming.  

I have had some success speeding up the process by tapping out air bubbles from the filter, but should this really be required?

Like other users, I’d like to hear from ZeroWater/Culligan what they plan to do about this problem.

 I know he’s married. At first, I didn’t want to develop feelings for him, but then something went wrong, and I fell in love. We’ve known each other since September. There have been many moments where I can confidently say he flirted with me: he called me beautiful very often, wondered how I could still be single, and jokingly said that, unlike guys my age, he wouldn’t let me get away. At the same time, during conversations, he would hold my hand above or below the elbow, squeeze it, and often teased me about blushing.  

Once, while walking down the hallway, we saw another professor, and mine prof. told him, ""Look at this beautiful girl.""
 Another time, there was a moment, he took my palm, and I squeezed it back—but that was in November. Later, he started mentioning his wife more often, saying he still had feelings for her, sharing how they met, etc. Once, in private he began a conversation with, *""Men get turned on in an instant, but women need time. There should always be passion in a relationship.""* He never hinted at sex with me, though.  

He would also hold my hand (above or below the elbow) in front of other students. He always notices when I’m absent and asks about me—he doesn’t pay that much attention to others. Once, during a morning conference, he asked the same question several times and then said with a smile, *""Sorry, I got distracted by [my name].""* The students were surprised, and I blushed, smiled, and covered my face.  

There were times when we ignored each other—no jokes, no banter. He would compliment other female students in front of me, touch their hands/arms. Once, while talking to a group of students (I was standing opposite him), he looked at me, took another girl’s arm below the elbow, then placed his hand on her back—all while smiling at me and talked directly to me. Of course, this annoyed me, and I responded rudely, avoiding eye contact.  

At one point, I even asked a male student to play along—we walked past my professor with the guy’s arm around my waist. Later, my professor got angry after another sharp reply from me, stopped me in the hallway, and said, *""You react so strangely to my jokes. I won’t joke with you anymore.""* I replied indifferently, *""Okay,""* which made him furious. He came to class angry, glared at me from a distance, then looked sad. Eventually, I apologized, and he said, *""No, you forgive me.""*  

Since then, we’ve been much warmer toward each other. He stopped touching my hands but started new kinds of touches. Once, while working on an article alone in his office, he called me to the window to look at a building, stood behind me, and suddenly his hand was on my waist—he squeezed lightly for 2-3 seconds, then let go. He stayed close, and I could feel the warmth of his body. I didn’t react, just kept looking out the window, and we went back to work as if nothing happened.  

Another time, he offered to add cognac to my coffee, persuaded me, and I agreed. We drank coffee, chatted—nothing serious. He called me *""sunshine""* and a couple of times mumbled *""love you,""* but so quickly it seemed unserious. Later, he asked if I liked his tie. In private, he complimented my eyelashes, said they were long and pretty, and noticed freckles on my face.  

A few days ago, I showed him a photo on my phone—I held it in one hand while he zoomed in with his fingers. Then he lightly placed his fingers on my inner wrist, making small stroking motions. He wasn’t flirting then; his face was serious as he talked about coursework. The next day, passing me in the hallway, he said something about studies and briefly placed his hand on my hip (iliac bone) for a second before walking away. Later, we walked side by side, and he nudged(bumped as an accident) me with his shoulder twice without context.

I gave him cookies yesterday, he was happy and he said he’d let his wife try them. (Again he mentioned his wife 👿)
At the end of the conversation, he said he sees me as a granddaughter, also told me I blush and pale too easily. I denied it.  ",0,1747173497.0,AskMenAdvice,3,0.5,False
1klypda,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1klypda/my_sweet_petty_revenge_against_an_entitled/,My sweet ✨petty revenge✨ against an entitled bridezilla!,"This is going to be a long post with a lot of relevant context and I'm not even going to attempt to shorten it because I made this throwaway account for the sole purpose of basking in the glory of my petty revenge!



So all of this started around March 2024 when I got a text message from Jen (27F) asking me (28F) to be a bridesmaid at her wedding. 



Now here's some context: Jen and her now husband Matt (27M) were both my classmates back in university and we hung out as a group quite often. While I still used to talk to Matt occasionally (like on birthdays and stuff), I hadn't been in touch with Jen after university. 



So I was obviously quite surprised when Jen asked me to be a bridesmaid because again... we hadn't spoken in years. I asked Jen if she was sure she wanted me to be a part of her wedding (after the obvious formalities of how are you and it's been so long) since we hadn't really been in touch these past few years. 



Her response: she wanted only people who knew her and Matt as a couple to be a part of the main wedding event. This made sense since Jen isn't from our country, she was an international student who settled here after graduating. So her immediate family never really saw much of her and Matt together (they'd been dating since the 2nd year of uni, by the way).



Since Matt and I had maintained a friendship over the years and I really didn't have any problems with Jen either, I agreed to be in the wedding party and then... the FIRST BOMB DROPPED.



Jen texted me 2 hours after I confirmed that I'll be a bridesmaid saying: **""By the way, Candace was raving about the gluten-free, no sugar chocolate cupcakes you make! I'd love to have them at the bridesmaid cocktail party!! Consider this your first bridesmaid duty haha! There'll be 6 of us. Yay thank you... can't wait to try them.""**



Now this is where we get some more context: 



1. I own a bakery and I specialize in better-for-you (aka HEALTHIER) desserts hence the ""request"" came my way.



2. Candace is a good friend of mine and also a part of our college group. Her and I have kept in touch after college and she has always endorsed my business around brides-to-be and even for the corporate events at her office. I've gotten a lot of referrals from Candace over the years. 



\[SPOILER: Candace told me later that Jen had asked for my number to order cupcakes... instead she ended up inviting me to be a bridesmaid JUST FOR FREE CUPCAKES. And no, that's not the worst of it. There's so much more drama that's to be unfolded here\]



I was a little annoyed by Jen's behavior of just assigning me the duty to make cupcakes for her cocktail party but I was like, it's fine, it's just 6 of the girls in her bridal party attending \[Jen + MOH + 4 bridesmaids including me\]. It wasn't that big a deal so I let it slide.



And then it came time to go dress shopping for the cocktail party. 



Now here's what was planned: Instead of having a traditional bachelorette, Jen had organized a cocktail dinner for her bridal party. She kept telling us that this was going to be her treat (we found out later it was paid for by Matt). Jen's only request was that we all get appropriate cocktail dresses as she had hired a photographer for the dinner party. 



She even insisted that we all get our dresses from the same store because the owner of the store agreed to give her a huge discount on her custom wedding dress if we all made a group purchase (our dresses would also be about 15% discounted so it sounded like a win-win). 



What we didn't realize was that the ""15% discount"" was on dresses that costed upwards of $600... for regular dresses. 600 DOLLARS! Granted they were stunning but it's too much for a cocktail dress (for me).



Some of us were a little hesitant about the cost but her MOH told us that since we're not pitching in for a traditional bachelorette and this is the only thing she's asking for, let's go ahead and get the dresses from the store. 



Thankfully, my fiance told me that he'll get me a dress from that store as a gift since my birthday was coming up anyway, and I could wear it for my birthday date with him too. It was the sweetest gesture and I was like okay, yes. I'm on board. 



Now while all the girls had planned to go shopping together, I told them to go ahead without me and that I would go shopping for my dress with my fiance. Given that he was paying for it, I wanted him to be involved in picking the dress too. And then we'd all go in together for the final fittings later once the dresses were ready (the store only had samples in stock and everything had to be made-to-order).



Note: there was no theme for the cocktail party dresses just as long as it was a cocktail dress. Short, long, mini, midi... everything worked. It just had to be an evening glam kinda dress.



So my fiance and I went in and picked the most stunning cocktail dress. The length was mid-thigh, it was golden, halter neck and just worked. The size in store was a little tight for me but that was okay as mine was going to be custom made to my measurements anyway. We booked my dress under the group booking for the wedding party, my fiance paid for the dress and it was all good to go.



Now comes the day ONE WEEK BEFORE the cocktail dinner when the complete bridal party goes for the final fittings and to pick up their dresses. 



Jen saw me wear my dress and went absolutely bonkers. She started whining about how my dress was prettier than hers and even screamed at the poor store manager for not showing her this design (the shop had the exact same selection the day she went shopping). 



She insisted that I wear a different dress and she wants to wear the one I got. And here's everything wrong with that:



1. The store manager straight up refused. He said that in such a short time (1 week to the party), he couldn't get a custom dress made in her size.



2. I couldn't wear something else as my fiance had already paid a hefty price tag for this dress and I was going to get his money's worth by wearing it as much as I could.



Despite all reasoning, Jen insisted that I let her at least try on my dress. I was obviously furious at the suggestion but didn't want to make a scene so I let her try it on. Mind you, I am THREE SIZES BIGGER than Jen. So there was no way this dress was fitting her right. 



After wearing the dress, Jen asked the store manager if MY DRESS could be altered to her size. I couldn't believe she had the audacity to ask that while I was standing right there. I wasn't going to let her wear my dress, no matter what. My fiance loved me in it and I wasn't going to just let someone else take it.



Thankfully, the store manager was not having it. He said that the look of the dress would be completely ruined upon such a drastic alteration as the dress is a lot bigger than her size, which was true.



She just made a disgusted face and changed out of it. We all got our dresses and got home. They had lunch plans later but I didn't feel like joining so I came home WITH my stunning dress.



Again, some context is needed: The dress wasn't all that special or the kinda dress that would steal someone's thunder. It was a very regular dress that just happened to look really good on me. If I'm being honest, the color of the dress was washing her out. I'm attaching a picture of a similar dress that I found online in the comments.



Later that evening, I get a call from Jen telling me that her cocktail dinner had been cancelled because her dress just wasn't working. I was fuming because I just spent a fortune getting a dress for her dinner and now she's not even having one? However, I let it go and just said ""I understand"" and then the call ended normally.



THE ENTITLEMENT HASN'T EVEN BEGUN YET. 



4 days later, I get a text from Jen: **""Hey, so I know you were going to make those chocolate cupcakes for the cocktail dinner but since it's no longer happening, you can just make them for the main wedding instead. We're expecting about 90 guests, but I'd make an even 100 just in case. Thank you!""**



EXCUSE ME? You're telling me that I just went from making cupcakes for 6 people to making them for 90 people without even signing up for either of those in the first place? 



I took a few hours to craft a response that didn't have me cussing her: **""Jen, while I'm sorry about the fact that you had to cancel your cocktail dinner, I'm unable to just make 100 cupcakes for your wedding. Especially since the gluten and sugar-free cupcakes have alternate ingredients that cost a fortune. However, if you'd like to place an order with my bakery for the 100 cupcakes, I can get that done. I'm also happy to offer a discount for that order. Let me know at least 30 days before the wedding if you'd like for me to confirm that order. Hope this helps. Sorry about your dinner being cancelled once again.""**



Ready to get your blood boiling? Here's how she responded - Jen: **""It's tacky to ask for money after you agreed to gift someone something. I'm not going to pay for those cupcakes as I didn't budget for them. I've already told all my guests that there's going to be gluten free dessert options. You're my bridesmaid, I should be able to count on you to take my problems away, not pile them up on me. Please make the cupcakes happen, thank you.""**



I don't know how some people wake up and think that it's okay to go about their lives acting like this. Where do they find the audacity? 



I never texted her back about the cupcakes. Instead, my plan was to meet Jen for coffee in the coming week and tell her that I'm going to be dropping out of the bridal party altogether. There was no way I was going to spend all that time and money on making 100 cupcakes for her wedding.



It just didn't make sense for my business or in my life in general. If she was a close friend, I would've done it but Jen was merely an acquaintance who had reconnected after years and somehow trapped me into being in a her wedding party.



So the plan was set, I just asked Jen to meet me for coffee the following week where I would have this discussion in person and drop out of the wedding party. She was under the pretense that I wanted to discuss something related to my bridesmaid duties.



But then... guess what I see all over the bridal party's Instagram stories 2 days later? THEY WERE AT THE MOTHER LOVING COCKTAIL DINNER. 



Yes, the same cocktail dinner that Jen told me was ""cancelled"" because her dress wasn't working out. The way I wanted to punch her face through the phone screen was unreal.



The morning after the cocktail dinner, I called Candace, and here's what happened. Jen told everyone that I was the one who told her I wouldn't be attending the cocktail dinner due to a work emergency and as an apology, I had offered to make cupcakes for her wedding day. 



AGAIN ... how do people like this survive in the real world?



I told Candace the truth and she was just as furious as me. She told me she'd come with me to coffee next week and she would also drop out of Jen's wedding party. 



That honestly would've been a great slap across her face but I had a much more petty revenge brewing in my head. I told Candace to continue being a bridesmaid and so would I. 



I cancelled my coffee meeting with Jen the following week and told her that I'll coordinate with her caterer directly about the serving of the cupcakes.



Yup, I was going to get the cupcakes to her wedding. ALL ONE HUNDRED OF THEM.



But with a teeny tiny twist. 



Fast forward, 4 months later: Jen's and Matt's wedding day. A beautiful event with one simple dress code rule... all guests were to wear pastel colors. 



Except guess who showed up in her SHINY ASS GOLDEN HALTER NECK DRESS that Jen was obsessing over? That's right.... me!!!!



When I tell you that her eyes visibly popped out of their sockets, I'm not even exaggerating. She was extremely furious at me for wearing the dress and absolutely lost it when Matt out of all people commented how gorgeous I looked. Oh sweet sweet karma! 



But that wasn't all...remember the gluten-free, sugar free chocolate cupcakes I was supposed to make for the wedding? Well guess what? I went ahead and got 100 pieces of the most generic super market cupcakes with whipped cream frosting and I got them from one of those budget shopping places that sell in wholesale. Let's just say that the only taste in those cupcakes for that of icing sugar. 



I was in contact with her caterer who had prepared a stunning printed calligraphy dish cards (the card where the name of the dish is mentioned) and the card said ""Gluten-free cupcakes"" ... but due to health code compliance they couldn't use it anymore and they couldn't even make a new one on the spot as these were printed weeks in advance. 



So guess what? They had to place a handwritten card that said ""cupcakes"" 🤣🤣🤣



When Jen asked me about it with her voice all high pitched, I simply said ""Oh, I had a work emergency! But I felt terrible about it so I got these from the store as an apology.""



Goes without saying she was irked throughout her wedding and reception and I couldn't be prouder of myself. She got what she deserved and maybe she'd stop being such an entitled brat moving forward.

1klypd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/OralNutra/comments/1klypd9/why_your_morning_breath_might_be_more_than_just/,🕰️ Why Your Morning Breath Might Be More Than Just Coffee,"Let me tell you something most people don’t realize.

The first thing they do in the morning is brush their teeth.

They rinse with mouthwash. They floss. Maybe even chew some gum on the way out the door.

But when they get to work, or worse — when they’re on a Zoom call — they still feel it.

That **morning breath**.

It’s not just coffee. It’s not just sleep. It’s not just “normal.”

And here’s what gets me...

* *Most people never ask why it happens.* 
* *They just try to cover it up.*

# The Truth Is…

Morning breath isn't just about what you ate last night.

It's about what your body does while you're asleep.

Your mouth is a living ecosystem — full of bacteria, enzymes, and moisture levels that shift constantly.

When you sleep, saliva production drops. That’s normal.

But if your body is already out of balance — if your oral microbiome is off — those few hours of reduced saliva become a *feast* for the wrong kind of bacteria.

And by morning? You've got a problem.

A big one.

One that no amount of minty fresh mouthwash can fix — not really.

Because the real issue isn’t on the surface.

It’s deeper than that.

# And That’s What People Don’t Get

Most of us are taught to treat the symptoms — not the cause.

We use more mouthwash, brush harder, floss more.

But we never address what’s actually causing the bad breath to come back again and again.

And that’s why so many people feel like they’re fighting a losing battle.

They wake up every day hoping this time will be different.

But it’s not.

# There’s a Better Way — And It Starts With Understanding

If you want to stop waking up with that lingering odor — the one that makes you reach for mints before you even say good morning to your partner — then you need to understand how your mouth works.

You need to know which bacteria are working against you… and what you can do about it.

In a powerful 10-minute video, a leading expert in oral health explains exactly how these hidden processes affect your breath — and what you can do to finally take control.

This isn’t another quick fix. This is a strategy that targets the root of the problem.

I'm literally ""in love"" with Encens Suave edp.

I am so fuckin literally in the throes of a secret passionate love affair with Encens Suave edp  by Matierre Premier that I can't make sense of it...I first bought a 50 ml bottle and was instantly smitten by the luxurious narcotic effect it had on me. Once this genie was released from its bottle it cast a spell of Frankincense tinged with whispy teases of coffee and vanilla. 
I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt I would have to buy a full bottle despite it being a co$tly expenditure for me..
So before the Reformulation Gods rear their ugly head I bought a Full Bottle (which is comfortably nestled in the back of my collection for safekeeping). I still haven't used up my 50 ml bottle but I knew I just had to get a Full Bottle of this Holy Grail.
I prefer this over Ambra Aurea though Ambra Aurea does hold it's place in the Gods Of Amber pantheon. I even have a close third which is Molten Ambra which is wickedly enticing ...
I've never had this kind of hypnotic spellbound love for any of my other fragrances...second close by is my beloved Serge Lutens Ambre Sultan.

I recently set up my Raspberry Pi to act as a VPN server at home and connected it to my GL.iNet travel router. I followed a YouTube tutorial and also got help from ChatGPT and Claude to configure WireGuard on my Pi. Everything processed fine.

As part of the setup, I created a DuckDNS account to get a domain and token. Everything went smoothly, and I was able to connect the WireGuard VPN to my travel router. It worked great—**but only while I was at home** on my Wi-Fi.

However, when I tested the setup at a local coffee shop, I couldn’t connect to the Wi-Fi network broadcast by my GL.iNet router (the SSID I created during the initial setup). Normally, the first step is to connect to the router’s Wi-Fi, then log into the router via its local IP address. Once connected, the router should use the WireGuard VPN to assign me my **home IP address** (as configured on my Raspberry Pi).

The issue is: **I couldn’t even connect to the GL.iNet Wi-Fi** when I was away from home. The only way it worked was when I switched the VPN setting on my GL.iNet router to use my **paid VPN provider**, but that defeats the purpose—I want my VPN to connect me to my home IP address, not a random one that changes.

**Has anyone else set up something similar?**  
Do you know why I can connect when I’m home but not when I’m away?  
Could there be an issue with the travel router's configuration, DHCP, or something else preventing it from broadcasting the SSID or accepting connections when it’s not on my home network?

Any help or advice would be appreciated!

Also, below are the steps I followed, and everything worked. I just do not know why I couldn't connect to my gl.Inet wifi. I connected to the coffee shop's Wi-Fi, but the WireGuard VPN, even though green, did not change my IP address to my home IP.",1,1747172909.0,raspberry_pi,0,1.0,False

I’m feeling the imbalance financially and emotionally, looking for advice on how to talk to him about it?","THROWRA my account is too new but I want to see if I’m too in my head??

My boyfriend is 35, an engineer who makes about $100K a year and owns his home. I’m 26 and work as a hotel receptionist, making about $50K. We’ve been together for five years. When he bought his house last year, he asked me to move in and split everything 50/50. I told him I didn’t feel comfortable paying into a mortgage for a home I don’t own, especially since I’d have no protection if we broke up. We eventually agreed that he’d pay the mortgage, and I’d take care of all the groceries and utilities.

In the beginning of our relationship, even though we split things, it felt more like 30/70. He used to offer to pay more, surprise me with things, and treat me to outings. Now, everything is 50/50—even date nights—and I’ve been pulling back because I’m struggling financially. Some weeks, I spend $150 on groceries and $120+ on takeout (especially if he jokes about cravings or doesn’t want to cook). When I say I can’t afford something, he’ll usually just drop it—he doesn’t offer to cover it. But when he wants something, I’m the one running out to get it.

He also occasionally mentions buying snacks or coffee for his coworkers or classmates, which is great—but it reminds me that I don’t get that kind of thoughtfulness anymore. I used to do little things for him all the time, but I’ve stopped because I didn’t feel it was mutual. He says I should be grateful that I have a roof over my head and food—but I’m the one paying for the food and utilities.

I’m not trying to be taken care of entirely—I just want to feel like the emotional and financial effort is mutual. I’ve told him that if I made more, I’d love to spoil him too. I’d really appreciate advice from people who have been in similar situations. What can I do if talking I feel it leads to same conversation with the same results?

1klyd63,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1klyd63/the_long_sleep_project_deepwell/,The long sleep (Project Deepwell),"They called it Project Deepwell. Some shady government lab in the middle of nowhere, Nevada, 1987. The place was a concrete bunker, half-buried under sand, like it was hiding from God. The goal was simple but messed up: see what happens when you keep people in a deep, unnatural sleep for weeks. Not just regular sleep, but this heavy, coma like state induced by a machine they nicknamed the Cradle. It messed with brainwaves, slowed everything down to a crawl heart, lungs, thoughts. The scientists thought it could be used for space travel or some crap. They didn’t expect what came through.

I got this story from a journal I found at a thrift store, tucked in an old box of medical books. The writer was Dr. Alan Kessler, one of the lead researchers. His handwriting got shakier as the pages went on, like he was losing it. Here’s what he said, best I can piece together.

They had five test subjects, all volunteers, strapped into these metal beds with wires hooked to their skulls. The Cradle hummed like a dying fridge, and the room smelled like ozone and sweat. Kessler said the subjects went under fast, their eyes fluttering shut, bodies limp as corpses. The monitors showed their brainwaves flatlining almost, but not dead just real slow, like they were dreaming in slow motion. For the first week, everything was fine. The researchers took shifts, watching the screens, sipping bad coffee. Kessler was stoked, thinking they’d cracked something big.

Then Subject 3, a guy named Marcus, started twitching. Not normal twitches, but like his fingers were trying to write something in the air. His lips moved too, whispering stuff nobody could hear. They checked the Cradle, found nothing wrong. But Kessler wrote he felt watched, like something was in the room with them, hiding in the corners where the fluorescent lights flickered. The other researchers laughed it off. Stress, they said. Too many late nights.

By day 10, things got weird. Marcus’s twitches spread to the others. All five subjects were moving now, their hands jerking in sync, like they were puppets on the same string. Kessler’s team recorded it, but the tapes came out garbled black and white static with faint shapes moving in the background. Shapes that didn’t look human. One night, Kessler caught Dr. Patel, his second-in-command, staring at the subjects with this blank look, like she was sleepwalking. When he shook her, she snapped out of it, said she didn’t remember standing there.

Day 15, the first death. Dr. Hargrove, the oldest guy on the team, didn’t show up for his shift. They found him in the break room, throat slit, sitting in a chair with a scalpel in his hand. No blood on the floor, like it’d been soaked up by something. The cameras showed nothing—just Hargrove walking in, then static for 20 minutes. Kessler wrote he heard whispers that night, coming from the subjects’ room. Not English, not anything he knew. It sounded like glass scraping together.

The team was freaking out, but they couldn’t leave. The bunker was locked down, some protocol they’d signed onto without reading the fine print. Kessler started noticing the subjects’ faces changing. Their skin got pale, almost gray, and their eyes when they opened them were wrong. Too big, too dark, like they were looking through you. Subject 2, a woman named Claire, smiled once during a check-up. Kessler said it wasn’t her smile. Too wide, too many teeth.

By day 20, Patel was gone. Not dead—gone. Her ID badge was on her desk, but her bunk was empty, clothes still folded. The same night, Marcus sat up in his bed, still wired to the Cradle, and spoke. His voice was deep, wrong, like it was coming from somewhere else. He said, “We are borrowed. You are borrowed.” Then he lay back down, still asleep. Kessler stopped sleeping after that. He kept a knife under his pillow.

The last entry was day 25. Kessler was alone now. The others were dead found in pieces, like something had torn them apart and left the bits arranged in patterns on the floor. He wrote about the subjects waking up, but they weren’t human anymore. Their bodies moved like they were learning how to walk for the first time, jerky and wrong. Their faces were blank, but their hands kept making those twitching signs, faster now, like they were calling something. Kessler saw things in the shadows tall, thin shapes with too many arms, flickering like bad TV reception. He said they weren’t from here, not from Earth. The Cradle had opened a door, and something had slipped through, using the subjects as meat puppets.

His final words were scrawled, barely readable: “I’m burning the Cradle. If you find this, don’t look for us. Don’t sleep too long.”

The journal ends there. I tried digging online, but there’s nothing about Project Deepwell, no record of a bunker in Nevada. The thrift store guy didn’t know where the journal came from, just said it was in a box dropped off by some nervous-looking dude who didn’t stick around. I don’t sleep much these days. Every time I close my eyes, I swear I hear that glass-scraping sound, like something’s waiting for me to drift off too deep.",1,1747172630.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I’m trying to build a calorie cycling plan that fits my lifestyle. I find it significantly easier to have “semi-fasted” days in my plan, so that I can have higher calorie days in the week (where maybe I’m going out with friends) that satisfy me. 

My ultimate goal is to be able to think about calories less while still cutting. On the fasted days I know I don’t have to think about anything cause I just have my coffee.

My question is for the high calorie days. I find when I make (what I feel is) a satisfying meal at home, it’s usually around 600-1000 cals. Rarely does it ever go past 1000. 

I want to have a similar kind of estimate for restaurant meals. I knowwww this varies a LOT of course. But what would you define as the average/higher end calories of a reasonable restaurant meal? I just want to get your opinion on what youre used to seeing!

I’m not talking anything crazy like Cheesecake Factory lol, but if I were to go out for a meal and have burger and fries or full plate of pasta, or a full pizza, a full Thai meal, a full Indian meal, what is the higher end of what you’re used to seeing? 1500-2000? 

Thank you so much!!

Yellow would LOVE D&D you can’t convince otherwise, he likes being the DM most and also collects a TON of cool looking dice for fun.

([Slightly stolen from this headcanon](https://www.tumblr.com/gabrielleyueerrrrr/756799241515614208/some-random-rgby-headcannons-based-on-actual)) Yellow loves The Lord of the Rings and Gandalf is his favorite character, he likes to binge rewatch the trilogy and none of his friends ever join him because “bro I’m not watching 9 hours the same movies AGAIN”… He is never allowed to pick for movie night.

Yellow’s favorite type of game is retro games, like arcade and 8-bit type retro that he usually gets his hands on through emulation, he also enjoys anything with simple mechanics that can keep you sucked in for hours, puzzle games 100% (he is a sudoku master)

Other miscellaneous likes, he enjoys math rock because he has good taste, he drinks lots of tea and coffee for the caffeine, I could see him liking mint chocolate icecream tbh and if you tell him it tastes like tooth paste he will accuse you of not brushing your teeth.

He’s absolutely accidentally gotten a virus either on his computer or Alan’s computer through like sketchy downloads, he should know better but curiosity keeps getting the best of him.

Awful sleep schedule too, he stays up late most nights and occasionally just sleeps in the middle of the day. Part of it is consequence of the fact he uses his computer while in Bed and gets distracted with it, he’d probably pull a lot of all nighters too if the CG didn’t continuously complain about the bright light from the computer not letting them sleep.

I realized Monday that I hadn’t seen one of them in a few days, which is weird because I’m religious about washing dishes every single night. Then I realized I had mistakenly left my entire lunch bag in my car from Friday - including my Yeti, which was empty but unrinsed. And to make matters worse, it’s already stupidly hot where I live, so that trace coffee creamer was COOKING.

As you can imagine, it smelled like death. I hand washed it and ran it through an extra hot/sanitize dishwasher cycle, but I can still smell it. I do have a sensitive nose but I am 100% sure it’s not just in my imagination - it smells like rotten milk. To be honest, if it was any other tumbler, I’d probably just toss it, but I love these so much and I’d never buy them for myself at that price point, I just *really* want to save it if I can.

1kly3gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1kly3gw/coming_to_terms_with_the_addictions_of_loved_ones/,Coming to terms with the addictions of loved ones,"Hi. Im a 33F, going strong on 9 days sober. 

I've been on a ""sober-curious"" journey for nearly 2 years. I've had a lot of ups and downs and in that journey I've found that some days I can control my urges & drink responsibly... but the days I'm using alcohol as a crutch, to hide from my feelings, turn my brainn off, to chase the promise of happiness I've come to associate with beer... well, those days moderation can be hard if not impossible. Because of this & health concerns (mental & I have inflammatory diseases) I am going on my sober journey again - today marks 9 days. I think the longest Ive ever gone was close to a month in November... before that, I cant remember not going more than a week or two without a drink, or binge drinking, since I turned 20. I mostly drank beer, I started my sober journey by saying ""no brown liquors"", then it was ""no liquor"", then it was ""you can have a couple beers or half a bottle of wine, anymore you'll feel like shit and feel bad about yourself"" 

I know this might not seem like a lot to some, but it became a problem due to my health issues, mental problems & inability to STOP when I was in a dark place (which, because of my dependency on alcohol, & the feelings it gave me, was often). 

Adiction runs so deep in my family. My bio dad is actively addicted to alcohol & weed, (and gambling) - hes been hooked on much harder shit. I dont see him much, but when I do I end up drinking more than I'd like. 

My mom was a ""closet"" binge drinker, days at a time, alone in her room while I helped around the house with 3 kids in middle/high school & tried to balance a crazy, ever changing work schedule that had me up all night. My step-dad was never home during this period or even before really, he'd go to his favorite haunt and use the carryouts he'd bring for our ""free for all"" dinners as an excuse to stay at the bar and away from home. 

My mom eventually got sober, filed for divorce, & moved out. She's doing pretty good, with years of sobriety under her belt now. I talk to her a lot about my concerns. 

My step-dad, who I still live with, is in deep denial of his problems. He's 55, going on 23, and drinks hard liquor everyday. Most conversations I try to have with him go nowhere, because he cant follow a thread of thought very long or will ask the same question after forgetting the answer. I'll say things and it's like they just slide right off his brain... I found an AA book in his office, but that mightve been from the DUI. He regularly drinks & drives, sometimes so drunk I don't know how he's standing. 

 Myself, my mom, & others have brought up his drinking before, he gets defensive of course - "" if I die at 75 instead of 95, oh well at least I was happy!"" Or when he was looking for a drinking buddy & I needed to convince myself I wasnt in a bad place, ""If you go by medical standards, almost everyone is an alcoholic!""

The reason why I've finally hit ""a breaking point"" is that Today we had a scare with our senior dog. He's still not on the best prognosis & will require more all day in-patient vet treatments throughout the week, but even while we're at the vet, discussing how we'll need to pick him up around 6, my dad can only think about how he already has plans (ie drinking with another enablement, another bartender for a fling). 

He texts me this afternoon, if ill pick the dog up, and I cant help but tell him he should really be spending time with our dog, who he claims to love so much. I tell him, from experience, he'll never live it down if something happens. That's just time you don't ever get back. He'd rather go out and keep his plans, keep partying, keep denying. 

I know I can't change others, but this is something I'm really struggling with. 

Everyday I watch him pour himself drink after drink or go out & drink until he can get home and make himself another drink. He keeps a fully stocked bar in the basement & is now a ""hobby bartender"" - making a mess, inviting other bar rats over, & keeping the booze stocked before it's close to empty. Everyday I walk past it to make my breakfast and coffee. The urge to take a baseball bat to everything is growing.  Even at Disney world, in Magic Kingdom, the ONE place you cannot drink, all he could talk about & was itching for was getting to the hotel for pre-dinner cocktails. I dont know if hes spent a single day sober in years, even when he's been deathly ill with flu, COVID, etc, he'll heat up some brandy because ""it's an old Italian cure"". 

How do you cope with watching someone you love destroy themselves and act so much in denial of their behavior? I try to remain neutral & offer nonjudgemental facts or concerns, but i feel like I've reached the point where I don't even want a relationship with this person anymore. Was our adult relationship really just based around being drinking buddies? Is it just best, like with my bio dad, to quietly let our relationship fade so he doesn't keep bringing me down with him?

To be fair some of it was out of their control and I was upgraded for cheap so I will try to factor that into the review. After hearing so much about their ""best economy/premium economy"" awards maybe I bought too much into the hype.

* The WIFI was unusable during the entire flight. I had a few pages like Reddit load a few times during a very long flight. To their credit as least they didn't charge anyone for it. This was a bummer because I was planning to pay for it and get some work/studying done but it was impossible.
* The PE seat was nice but sitting in the middle of the row sucked (not JAL's fault I had two grump seatmates that never wanted to let me out)
* Food was probably the biggest disappointment and by that I really mean the main entrees. There were only two choices for the ""main mean"" and no choice for the ""second meal"". The first meal was a pork macaroni dish they didn't look good and wasn't that good. The second meal was a rice/chicken dish that had no taste whatsoever. While they had plenty of snacks and food overall the main dishes could be better quality
* Service was a miss a few times. I was never personally asked for miso soup with the meals, even though they asked the other people next to me if they wanted it. I had to flag them down both times to request some.
* The coffee/tea is served in very small cups (near shot glass size). While smaller servings is common in Asia in my experiences, these were so small it wasn't worth asking for them - ending up requesting water or soft drinks instead.
* In flight entertainment offering was smaller than I expected in terms of movies/shows. This wouldn't have been a problem as I was expecting the WIFI to work but instead had quite a bit of time to fill.

I know that some of these are pretty minor and JAL overall was definitely nicer than the US carriers I've used in similar flights/cabins but it didn't quite live up to the hype. If I had paid full price I wouldn't have been very happy.

Overall a 7/10.

Once it ended, I happened to walk out of the lecture room around the same time as this other girl. She was a few steps ahead of me.

By coincidence, we both end up walking out the same door. I was omw to get coffee and then to get some to eat. I noticed I was behind the same person for a few mins but obviously didn't think anything of it, it wasn't anything uncommon... yet. Pretty sure she looked back toward me at least once at this point though, so she would have been aware of me as well.

We both walked towards the coffee shop, and then ig we both had decided to get something from there, ofc. I entered the line behind her, and I see her look over her shoulder again, and my anxiety spikes a bit. You know that feeling when you think someone in front of you might think ur following them, and you dont wanna look like a creep? I doubted she thought that but I decided to make sure we split ways after tims by just lingering for an extra few seconds.

She actually just ended up getting some cookie or donut, so I didn't even need to do all that. She's gone by the time I finish ordering, and by the time I picked up my coffee I forgot abt her.

And then I start walking toward the exit and she just APPEARS from the left from behind the circular room, coming from the washrooms. She def saw me, I was easily visible to her right, and to nobodys surprise she turns left and walks toward the same fucking exit I'm walking towards. I just keep walking cause its not like i was actually following her, but I'm praying we split paths soon.

This continues all the way to the station. I was concerned at this point cause like I prolly looked hella sus after everything, so I slowed my pace down so she could get ahead. Regardless, to my utter fucking dismay, she walks toward plaza, same as me, and I just end up following her but from further behind. I didn't want to just deviate my entire route cause like I thought that would be a bit too excessive since she might not have even noticed (she definitely did).

I got to the dorm like 20 seconds after she did so thankfully we lost sight of eachother after she walked around the corner, and I walked the rest of the way to the dorms without seeing her.

I recently set up my Raspberry Pi to act as a VPN server at home and connected it to my GL.iNet travel router. I’m not very tech-savvy, but I followed a YouTube tutorial and also got help from ChatGPT and Claude to configure WireGuard for my Pi. 

As part of the setup, I created a DuckDNS account to get a domain and token. Everything went smoothly, and I was able to connect the WireGuard VPN to my travel router. It worked great **but only while I was at home** on my Wi-Fi.

However, when I tested the setup at a local coffee shop, I couldn’t connect to the Wi-Fi network broadcast by my GL.iNet router (the SSID I created during the initial setup). Normally, the first step is to connect to the router’s Wi-Fi, then log into the router via its local IP address. Once connected, the router should use the WireGuard VPN to assign me my **home IP address** (as configured on my Raspberry Pi).

The issue is: **I couldn’t even connect to the GL.iNet Wi-Fi** when I was away from home. The only way it worked was when I switched the VPN setting on my GL.iNet router to use my **paid VPN provider**, but that defeats the purpose I want my VPN to connect me to my home IP address, not a random one that changes.

**Has anyone else set up something similar?**  
Do you know why I can connect when I’m home but not when I’m away?  
Could there be an issue with the travel router's configuration, DHCP, or something else preventing it from broadcasting the SSID or accepting connections when it’s not on my home network?

I do like to go out too and play pool and bowl, play mini golf, catch a movie in theaters, and try new places to eat. I’m also very much a bit of a nerd, so I’m pretty at home at comic book shops, comic conventions, and have great knowledge of the morphin grid, the ways of the force, the assassins creed, that winter is coming, the fate of the one ring of power, how to think fourth dimensionally, and the nature of the six infinity stones, this is just to name a few. I hope some of these make sense to you lol. 
In my off time from work I do have several hobbies, my main one is that I do like write like short stories, role play on Tumblr, write fan fiction, and I’m pretty good at it I think. I also like to paint like oils on canvas, I’m still learning and paint a little slowly lol (bit off an understatement lol). I also like to take on diy home improvement projects, it’s always fun for me to make some sort of improvement to my home and see it from start to finish. I also like to cook, I’m always looking for a new recipe or experiment in the kitchen. The best recipes are the ones that are found on accident lol, and not to toot my own horn but I think I’m a pretty good cook. 

To me a good Saturday night is a saturday night in with good movies and either ordering a really good pizza or making a really good dinner. My movie nights usually have different kinds of movies, from comic book movies, to romcoms, to action and adventure movies. Really I like any kind of movie as long as it’s not horror, I’m not a really big fan of horror type of movies. 
————————
My little side goes by the same name just any sort of babyish variant or babyish nickname (like Joey, little one, baby boy, ect), I am between 6 - 18 months old as an adult baby. What that age means to me is that I use diapers (mostly the cute printed ones for just wetting or putting oatmeal down the back), bottles, pacifiers, cute baby outfits, and tons of soft sweet baby toys for an infant.  While in little space I love watching disney movies, Blues Clues, and especially Miss Rachel videos, anything that will talk to me like a baby and baby talks to me makes me especially smiley and giggly. 

One thing I especially would like to try would be breastfeeding, I’m totally ok with it being dry nursing though if the desire to move to wet nursing came up I would be completely open to it. To me breastfeeding is the ultimate bonding experience between a mommy and baby and I want to have that bonding with my partner, it’s definitely something I would like to work towards with my partner. The other thing I would like if we’re either in the same city (preferable) or long distance is check ins with my partner like diaper checks, drink checks, meal checks, I’m kind of not the best at taking care of myself, especially when I’m stressed or worried/anxiety. I need to have some sort of line of contact with my partner. 

In addition to the wholesome lifestyle of ABDL, I am also a dark ageplayer/ABDL. So for me I do enjoy things like chastity play, where my partner keeps me in chastity under my diapers because I’m too ‘little’ for stiffies, and too ‘little’ to make ‘stickies’ in my diaper. I also enjoy some light humiliation play like being paraded in front of mommy’s friends (consenting and kinky friends of course) and teased and called names and told hunmiliating things in a very baby talk like kind of way. The other thing I also would enjoy too would be like ruined orgasms like being found in the crib after bedtime humping my stuffie or humping my stuffie in the playpen when I think mommy isnt watching and then being stopped right before I have my climax. Lastly the other thing I think would be fun would be being cucked, like mommy having a daddy to play with and they make out on the couch while I watch from the playpen frustrated behind my chastity cage, wanting to join in the naughty fun but being too ‘little’ to join in.

What I’m looking for outside of kink is someone between the ages of 29 to 41, preferably located in the El Paso Texas, Las Cruces New Mexico areas but I am open to anyone in any other areas as long as we’re a good fit. Looking for someone that I can nerd out with about how Han Solo shot first, or what ‘Winter is coming’ means, and other nerdy topics, someone is ok with being a homebody and hang out and just chill doing things together. I am someone that values communication and feeling my special someone close so would like to have some sort of lines of communication be they text, phone, video calls, or all 3. I just want to be able to feel like my someone special is close by when they aren’t close by. Hopefully if you are close by I would like to meet up for a cup of coffee or two here and there, get to know each other and go on dates here and there. Or if youre long distance we can meet up on camera chat, I’d like to know who I’m talking to you know.

In kink, I am looking for someone who can be a wholesome mommy and enjoy the sweet nurturing aspects of the lifestyle as well as someone who is open to some of the aspects of dark ageplay/ABDL that is good with chastity play and some humiliation. Looking for someone who wants to start a nursing relationship, this is something I’ve always wanted to try and looking for someone who is open to it. In general just looking for someone who can easily fall into that motherly type of mindset and can be very nurturing and caring personality naturally. 

As far as a dynamic goes for kink I would like to play with this person at least a couple times a week, someone who can enforce my littleness, enforce my regression and can give me consequences when I’m not a good little one. Check ins for me taking care of myself even when I’m not little would be nice, check ins for meals and water, and even diaper checks when little stuff is good would be nice. Of course there would be mutual caring for one another, to take care of each other and make sure that everything is ok and that we’re taking care of each other in one way or another.

If you’ve made it this far and everything I’ve described so far sounds interesting, please contact me. My DMs are always open and I’m always down to chat and hang out, please dont be afraid I dont bite (without consent lol horrible joke lol). I would love to hear from you.

1klxzb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OlderMan/comments/1klxzb0/professor_m_60s_student_f25_help_me_understand/,"Professor (M 60s), student (F25). Help me understand his intentions 🙏🏼","I like my professor—he’s over 60, and I’m 25.
 I know he’s married. At first, I didn’t want to develop feelings for him, but then something went wrong, and I fell in love. We’ve known each other since September. There have been many moments where I can confidently say he flirted with me: he called me beautiful very often, wondered how I could still be single, and jokingly said that, unlike guys my age, he wouldn’t let me get away. At the same time, during conversations, he would hold my hand above or below the elbow, squeeze it, and often teased me about blushing.  

Once, while walking down the hallway, we saw another professor, and mine prof. told him, ""Look at this beautiful girl.""
 Another time, there was a moment, he took my palm, and I squeezed it back—but that was in November. Later, he started mentioning his wife more often, saying he still had feelings for her, sharing how they met, etc. Once, in private he began a conversation with, *""Men get turned on in an instant, but women need time. There should always be passion in a relationship.""* He never hinted at sex with me, though.  

He would also hold my hand (above or below the elbow) in front of other students. He always notices when I’m absent and asks about me—he doesn’t pay that much attention to others. Once, during a morning conference, he asked the same question several times and then said with a smile, *""Sorry, I got distracted by [my name].""* The students were surprised, and I blushed, smiled, and covered my face.  

There were times when we ignored each other—no jokes, no banter. He would compliment other female students in front of me, touch their hands/arms. Once, while talking to a group of students (I was standing opposite him), he looked at me, took another girl’s arm below the elbow, then placed his hand on her back—all while smiling at me and talked directly to me. Of course, this annoyed me, and I responded rudely, avoiding eye contact.  

At one point, I even asked a male student to play along—we walked past my professor with the guy’s arm around my waist. Later, my professor got angry after another sharp reply from me, stopped me in the hallway, and said, *""You react so strangely to my jokes. I won’t joke with you anymore.""* I replied indifferently, *""Okay,""* which made him furious. He came to class angry, glared at me from a distance, then looked sad. Eventually, I apologized, and he said, *""No, you forgive me.""*  

Since then, we’ve been much warmer toward each other. He stopped touching my hands but started new kinds of touches. Once, while working on an article alone in his office, he called me to the window to look at a building, stood behind me, and suddenly his hand was on my waist—he squeezed lightly for 2-3 seconds, then let go. He stayed close, and I could feel the warmth of his body. I didn’t react, just kept looking out the window, and we went back to work as if nothing happened.  

Another time, he offered to add cognac to my coffee, persuaded me, and I agreed. We drank coffee, chatted—nothing serious. He called me *""sunshine""* and a couple of times mumbled *""love you,""* but so quickly it seemed unserious. Later, he asked if I liked his tie. In private, he complimented my eyelashes, said they were long and pretty, and noticed freckles on my face.  

A few days ago, I showed him a photo on my phone—I held it in one hand while he zoomed in with his fingers. Then he lightly placed his fingers on my inner wrist, making small stroking motions. He wasn’t flirting then; his face was serious as he talked about coursework. The next day, passing me in the hallway, he said something about studies and briefly placed his hand on my hip (iliac bone) for a second before walking away. Later, we walked side by side, and he nudged(bumped as an accident) me with his shoulder twice without context.

I gave him cookies yesterday, he was happy and he said he’d let his wife try them. (Again he mentioned his wife 👿)
At the end of the conversation, he said he sees me as a granddaughter, also told me I blush and pale too easily. I denied it.

So is almost my birth day, so looking for some presents.

I already own a V60, don't use it that much because  don't have alot of time to dail in and experiment. So just drinking it some times warm and cold and then enyoing it. (Also own a aeropress)

But I found about de switch and mugen w/wh switch, saying it is more fore giving, and just one water pull. Which sound perfect suitable for me, to make better and easier koffie compared to V60. But I would like to have that clear, sweet fruity cup of coffee!

What would you recommend in my case, the switch, mugen, mugen switch, and why?

Added also the origami because I really like the design.

I’m calling these headcanons because they are not 100% canon and readers can imagine whatever happens to the characters after the events of the stories they’re in.



Untitled



Camryn Nash - Now, she works as a private investigator and has crossed paths with police officers like Patrick Alford (she finds it interesting that he solved the case of his own popstar best friend) and lawyers from Hunter & Johnson firm (Cheryl reminds her of Ellyse with her charm and Paoletta is giving her bad vibes). Most of the time, she gets trivial cases like missing pets and cheating husbands but she still does her best because discovering the truth for her clients is the most important thing to her. However, investigating murder cases is her ultimate passion because she knows the pain of losing a loved one.



Nathan Hills - Unknown



Erin Ecclestone - She continues being a rock singer after high school and can be said to be quite famous in her field. She has written a few songs in dedication for Ellyse and tends to only perform them when Camryn and Madelyn are in attendance because she can’t handle the emotions if there is no one who shares her pain in the crowd . You can read Erin Ecclestone and Asher Herin for more details on her romantic life. I think there’s something to be explored in the relationship between a rockstar with a dead twin sister and a doctor with an estranged half-brother. She will refuse the secret organization’s recruitment but she might find herself thrown into the whirlwind no matter what because her own father is a member himself and not to add Asher’s father is a High Council member.



Madelyn Mackenzie - She follows in her mother’s footsteps in being an artist although she is not as famous as her but that’s fine with her because she just wants to express her emotions and thoughts creatively through artworks. Like Erin, she has created artworks inspired by Ellyse and the artworks will be displayed with Erin’s tribute songs playing during her art exhibition. She met Florence Stansfeld at Patrick Artell’s art exhibitions and she reminds her of Ellyse with her love of art and her cheerful smile.



Marcus Mackenzie - He enters a prestigious university with a football scholarship and majoring in education and minoring in psychology. Later on, he becomes a coach at MacFarlane High and offers guidance to troubled students. He no longer hides that Madelyn is his sister and has become her biggest supporter.



Stanley Jackson - After the story events, he goes to therapy to work out his various issues such as his family problems, his aggressiveness and his unresolved feelings towards Ellyse and the Mackenzie siblings. Marcus pays for the therapy and Stanley promises to pay it back. He gets recruited into the military by Landon Brooks because Landon sees himself in Stanley. At first, he struggles to control his temper but has learned to control it with the help of Landon.

Behind The Mask



Gabriel Sutcliffe:



Bad Ending - His attempt to save Nina is discovered by the High Council members but instead of being punished, he is offered the position of entertainment sector leader. He accepts the position with the mindset of changing things once at the top and Nina’s life is a necessary sacrifice. Despite achieving his ambition, he can’t ignore the guilt he feels so he channels all his emotions into taking dark roles that are critically acclaimed but emotionally draining. He starts to isolate himself both publicly and privately by not attending public events and cutting off his relationship with Kendrick. This could end in two ways, he achieves everything he ever dreams of but he is alone at the top or the offer is a trap and his dirty work is exposed causing his public image to crumble. Out of desperation, he’s dead. Only the High Council members know whether his death is real or fake



Good Ending - He managed to save Nina from her early death together with Kendrick. He goes to therapy to work out his emotional baggage and slowly takes off the mask. He uses his influence to undermine the High Council through legal and cultural means. He produces a docuseries about abuse and control in the entertainment world—heavily fictionalized, but pointed. He helps Nina in exposing the secret organization and lifts the careers of young, outspoken actors to create cracks in the system. Eventually, he testifies. Maybe not in court, but publicly—exposing what he can without putting others at risk. He loses jobs. Sponsors drop him. Some fans turn against him. But others? They listen. Nina’s story spreads. The Council fractures. And Gabriel walks away from the camera, for good. He buys a small theater in a quiet town and teaches acting to teenagers. Not to make stars—but to help them express themselves safely. He and Kendrick live quietly. Sometimes Kendrick jokes about Gabriel returning to the spotlight, and Gabriel only ever says: “That’s someone else’s dream now.”



Kendrick Jameson:



Bad Ending - His attempt to save Nina failed after Gabriel betrayed them. He stops talking to Gabriel and just disappears from the public eye. This could end in two ways, he is consumed by guilt and revenge and he kills the children of High Council members to inflict them the worst pain. He justified it as a lesson to them but his hardest kill is Harper Mercer. He doesn’t care about the outcome of his murders, he has nothing to live for anymore since Nina’s death. Another ending is he becomes even more manipulative and ruthless and groom an aspiring politician to be his puppet that he controls from the shadows. In both endings, he starts seeing Nina’s ghost. Whether it’s a real ghost or a hallucination, he does nothing about it because he thinks that he deserves to be constantly reminded of his failure in preventing her death.



Good Ending - He is successful in saving Nina’s life but it costs him everything, his public persona and scandals —some true, some fabricated by the Council to destroy him. In the end, he resigns from public office before they can remove him. He helps in Gabriel and Nina’s effort in exposing the secret organization. Afterwards, he moves to a quiet town with Gabriel and starts a leadership program or political reform initiative, where he selects a handful of young, promising students—especially those who remind him of himself before the ambition consumed him. Some of these mentees go on to challenge the very system he once helped build. He encourages it.

  


One Chance



Patrick Alford - He saved his best friend, Richard but he also lost someone who was close to him, Arthur. He threatened Arthur to save Richard and he felt justified and guilty at the same time. Sure, hurting him was the last resort and he betrayed him but he felt like he crossed a moral line and he can’t find it in himself to completely hate Arthur. He’s hailed as a hero for solving the case, but the department is wary. He hid his friendship with Ricky, which would have compromised the investigation. Internal Affairs might investigate him briefly. He gets suspended for a few months which he spends with his family and Richard in his hometown and lives as just Pat, not the police officer persona. He was mandated to undergo counseling or therapy before returning to the workforce. During the therapy, it was hard for him to open up about his feelings because he was used to handling it himself but over time, he finds himself talking about everything he used to hide such as his inferiority complex around Ricky, the pressure to live a “normal” life and his sexuality. He slowly overcomes his issues step by step and becomes an improved person.



Richard Moorhouse - Ricky experiences nightmares, panic attacks, and distrust in people—even Patrick for a while. He starts therapy and even though It’s a long process, it's necessary. He also attends Alcoholic Anonymous meetings to face his bad coping mechanisms.Ricky's used to performing for love and validation. AA teaches him to receive support instead of earning it with charm or talent.Hearing others’ stories—raw, dark, vulnerable—helps him realize he’s not alone. He can start forgiving himself. He takes a step back from the music industry to recover in his hometown with Patrick as Richard Moorhouse, not Ricky the popstar. He mourns the disappearance of “Leo” and still keeps the lion mask somewhere hidden. He never reveals that he is a member of the secret organization even to Patrick but he smiles when he sees the downfall of the High Council. When he returns to the spotlight, Ricky doesn’t just perform—he advocates about fan boundaries, mental health, addiction.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


Syndrome City



Paris Rinzaki - At first, Paris retreats inward. The trauma of the situation, paired with the disillusionment from her Paris trip and the emotional chaos of the hostage ordeal, overwhelms her sensory and emotional capacity. She takes a leave of absence from university, staying with her family, who are deeply shaken by what happened but don't quite understand the depth of her internal world.

But something begins to change. Paris starts journaling, initially as therapy. Slowly, she starts writing about the experience—not as a survivor, but through a dreamy, almost romantic lens, like she’s trying to rewrite the world into something she can believe in again. Jerome’s influence lingers; she still writes him letters she never sends, quoting scripture and musing about fate, love, and second chances.

Eventually, she returns to her studies with a new focus: fashion therapy. She decides to design clothing for trauma survivors—garments that feel safe, comforting, and beautiful. She pours her idealism into this new purpose, combining function and fantasy. Her signature collection, titled *Redemption*, debuts quietly at a student showcase and garners attention for its emotional depth.

Paris doesn’t completely “heal”—she still romanticizes the wrong things sometimes, and her belief in beauty can make her blind to ugliness—but she learns how to live with contradiction. She no longer idealizes Paris the city, but she starts falling in love with Paris the person—herself.

Florence Stansfeld - Unlike Paris, Florence doesn’t take a break from university. In fact, she *refuses* to go home. She insists on staying in France, transferring to a local art school in a burst of impulsivity, claiming that “if death almost found me here, I might as well live loudly in its face.”

Her professors are equal parts bewildered and impressed by her raw, emotional work. She begins painting obsessively—images of airports, blood-red skies, blurred figures locked in stares. She never explains them. She doesn’t have to. The pain is obvious, but so is the *wonder*. In her twisted way, Florence is grateful for the experience. She believes it cracked something open inside her.

Vincent, who quietly kept tabs on her after their release, eventually reaches out. Their relationship evolves into something unexpected—he becomes her *reluctant* mentor-slash-adopted father figure. He doesn’t understand her art, but he understands the ache behind it. And she, in return, gives him purpose: she drags him to art shows, insists he write poetry, buys him ridiculous scarves.

Florence eventually becomes known in the indie art scene for her “hostage expressionism,” but she never fully chases fame. She prefers dingy galleries with bad lighting and better wine. She says they remind her of the airport—ugly, tense, and full of ghosts.

Florence never tells anyone that a part of her misses the standoff. The intensity. The intimacy. The way the world froze and made sense for just a moment. Instead, she paints. And lives. Loudly.

Stephanie Holt - Stephanie returns to work as a banker, but she’s not the same. Her composure is still there—immaculate heels, tailored blazers, brisk walk—but it’s all more fragile now. In private, she has panic attacks. She flinches at loud airport announcements. She starts overthinking everything, especially when people mention “trust” or “terrorism” in passing.

Her coworkers notice she’s changed, but she never speaks of it. She refuses therapy at first—too proud, too busy. But it’s not pride that makes her eventually book a session. It’s a speech.

Stephanie gets invited to finally deliver the keynote address she was supposed to give in Sweden—the one interrupted by Liam. Standing at that podium, in front of hundreds of financial professionals, she can barely speak. Her voice cracks. And that’s when she realizes she’s still carrying him. Still carrying *all* of them.

So she goes to therapy. Quietly. Regularly. She never talks about “Stockholm Syndrome” out loud, but she does talk about connection, manipulation, and grief. She admits—only once—that a part of her *did* love Liam. Or maybe just loved being seen for the first time in a long time.

Eventually, she makes a bold move: she leaves her high-paying job and starts her own financial literacy nonprofit focused on helping ex-convicts, the unemployed, and underserved youth. People are shocked. But Stephanie never explains herself. Not really.

In a box in her closet, she keeps a folded-up note Liam wrote to her during the standoff. She hasn’t read it in months. But she can’t throw it away either.

Landon Brooks - Landon returns to active duty, stationed in Germany as originally planned. To most of his fellow soldiers, he seems the same—blunt, forceful, the guy who never hesitates. But something's different behind his eyes. Sharper. Heavier. He doesn’t talk about the hostage situation, and if anyone brings it up, he shuts it down fast. “It’s over.” But it’s not. Not really.

He starts seeing enemies where there are none. Gets into fights off-base. His CO warns him once, then again. Finally, Landon’s forced into mandatory therapy. At first, he treats the sessions like a joke. But his therapist doesn’t flinch when he rants, or when he confesses that part of him *wanted* to kill Liam… and another part still sees his face in dreams and doesn’t know whether to feel grief or rage. That same part sometimes thinks Liam *wasn’t all wrong*. That part scares him the most.

With time, Landon softens—not into a pacifist, but into someone with clarity. He starts working with military recruits who struggle with anger management, especially young men at risk of washing out. He doesn’t coddle them. But he listens. He stays in the military, but becomes more than a soldier—he becomes a protector. Less eager to fight. More willing to *understand* before pulling the trigger.

Once a year, he visits the grave where Liam is buried. He doesn't tell anyone. He just stands there, stares at the name, and mutters a gruff, “You messed me up, man. But you made me better, too.”

Jerome Seals - Jerome is held for psychiatric evaluation after the incident. The media latches onto him—“The False Savior,” they call him, sensationalizing his scripture-laced outbursts and how he reportedly *converted* Paris. But beneath the tabloid mockery, Jerome is surprisingly stable in the hospital. Not cured, not even remotely grounded in reality—but *centered* in a way others aren’t.

The doctors debate his release. He’s not violent. He’s deeply sincere. He prays for his fellow hostages every day. He claims Liam was ""a soul in pain, searching for light."" He calls Liam’s suicide a ""sacrifice,"" though his wording unsettles the staff. Still, they see no danger in him—only sorrow, fervor, and paradoxical peace.

Eventually, Jerome is transferred to a long-term mental health facility—not prison. There, something strange happens. People start listening. Fellow patients find comfort in his ramblings. Staff members, even the skeptical ones, admit that Jerome’s presence has a calming effect. He holds weekly “sermons” in the courtyard—not of damnation, but of forgiveness, hope, and second chances. He speaks of the airport like it was his Gethsemane, a place where he *watched sinners become saints in chains*.

Paris writes him letters. Florence paints him once, haloed and glassy-eyed, surrounded by smoke and fluorescent light.

Jerome never stops believing he is Jesus. But he no longer needs people to believe it. His message was always bigger than his identity. He writes a book, with help—a collection of reflections called *The Terminal Gospel*. It didn't become a bestseller. But it reaches *some*. And that, to Jerome, is salvation enough.

Vincent Denton - In the days following the event, Vincent tries to fade again. He doesn’t speak much to the media, brushes off interviews, and avoids other survivors. He feels embarrassed by the attention. Like an accidental ghost caught on camera.

But Florence doesn’t let him vanish. She calls him. Visits him. Drags him to cafés and art shows, sometimes without warning. She tells everyone he’s her “accidental dad” and insists he start writing again. At first, he resists—but she breaks him down with persistence and bad coffee.

Vincent begins journaling. Quietly. At first, it’s just rants about bureaucracy and loneliness. But then it turns into a memoir. He writes about aging, suicide, being laid off, and what it feels like to have death interrupted by someone with a gun. His tone is dry, grim, and unexpectedly funny.A local publisher picks it up, charmed by the rough honesty. The book, *Venice Without a View*, becomes a modest indie success. He’s invited to small book fairs and panels. At one, someone asks if he ever thanked Liam. Vincent pauses and says, “No. But I’m still here. So I guess that’s thanks enough.”

He and Florence remain close. They aren’t quite father and daughter, but they’ve built something better: **a mutual promise to keep going**. They argue over art, share meals, and sit in comfortable silences no one else would understand. Vincent never fully heals. He still has dark days. But now, when they come, he has words. A friend. And a reason to stay.



Artell Family

Patrick Artell - He continues painting and holding art exhibitions but his muse has changed from Daphne to Morgan Devall (Ashley teases her about it but she doesn’t mind because she is now the muse to Daniel Lowell). You can read more details about the relationship of Patrick and Morgan in Vampire Plan. They never married because of the complications of marrying a vampire and they still love each other deeply. He paints her over and over, capturing her with increasing complexity—aging in emotion even if her face never changes. His paintings of Morgan became legendary.



Walter Artell - At first, he embraces vampire life. No more deadlines, no more sleep—just time to write. His writing becomes darker and deeper. His new vampire novels blur the lines between fiction and confession. He writes quiet tragedies, complicated characters, and love stories where not everyone gets a happy ending. His most famous work is a semi-autobiographical vampire novel called *“The Ones We Couldn't Save.”* Critics call it “haunting and beautiful, like reading someone’s last confession before a storm.” The bond  between him and Caroline Thompson grows through long museum nights, where she talks about meaning in paintings and he reads her half-finished manuscripts. Just like Patrick, Caroline stays mortal and they never married (He wonders what’s with art people not wanting to be immortal).



Daphne Artell - Daphne’s ballet career is flawless: prima ballerina, groundbreaking performances, critical acclaim. During one high-profile ballet performance, Daphne suffers an injury—possibly a torn ligament or fractured ankle—jeopardizing her career.She spirals internally. She's terrified of being *nothing* without ballet. She hides the pain, tries to perform anyway, and collapses on stage mid-performance. Daniel supports her fully and helps her rehabilitate physically and emotionally. You can read more details on their relationship in their own post. Daphne doesn’t return to the stage as a prima ballerina. Instead, she choreographs. She begins to tell stories through others, mentoring young dancers and directing productions that blend traditional ballet with modern elements.



Marcus Artell - Marcus thrives on stage. His band skyrockets from local fame to global stardom. He has it all: sold-out stadiums, fans, endorsements, and even a place in his mother’s fashion empire as a brand ambassador. Marcus finds something real with Sabrina Bason, his bassist and childhood friend. She’s always been there, his anchor. Their chemistry is unspoken but undeniable—late-night jam sessions, shared hotel rooms on tour, that one time she kissed him after a show.



Ashley Artell - Ashley rises fast. From school plays to blockbuster movies, every performance cements her as the actress of her generation. Her rivalry with Walter becomes her most complex relationship. Working on the adaptation of Walter’s book—directed by Derek Torey—exposes old resentments.She wants to be seen as a *real artist*, not just the pretty face or famous daughter. But Walter accuses her of being too shallow, too controlling. Their fights become legendary on set, but it also brings out the best in both of them. The film became a massive [hit.It](http://hit.It) earns Ashley her first Academy Award nomination—and Walter a screenwriting one. They walk the red carpet separately but stand together during the press conference. It’s awkward. And weirdly healing. Gabriel invites her to his acting class as a special guest occasionally.



Life of a Lowell



Alyssa Lowell - Robbie Quill, the undercover reporter, begins investigating Lowell Group after receiving an anonymous tip that the company is involved in fraudulent activities — possibly misused funds, offshore accounts, or unethical business dealings. The tip seems credible and detailed, with internal financial documents, executive schedules, and even footage of confidential meetings. What Robbie doesn't know is that the source is James Chambers, Alyssa’s ex-husband, who is seeking revenge.

James is bitter over the divorce and his failed career. By targeting Alyssa’s company, he hopes to either blackmail her or ruin her completely. He knows how much she values her image as a powerful, flawless businesswoman — especially after having been humiliated by him in her personal life. Exposing any skeletons in Lowell Group’s closet would crush her, professionally and personally.

As Robbie starts to get closer to the truth, Alyssa becomes suspicious of him. Her instincts are sharp — she’s always been the type to sniff out lies. She eventually catches Robbie snooping and confronts him in a cold, intimidating fashion. But Robbie, who began the investigation to get a big scoop, is now conflicted — because he starts seeing another side of Alyssa, especially in how she treats Jason and her quiet moments with Briar.

Briar, being the more empathetic twin, suggests they dig into where the leak came from. They soon uncover that James is behind the smear campaign. The revelation hits Alyssa hard, not because she's afraid of losing her company — but because she realizes how vulnerable she was to a man who never loved her, and how much of her strength was really just emotional armor.

Robbie, faced with a moral decision, helps the Lowells by exposing James's manipulation publicly — but not without conditions. He wants to publish the truth: not a hit piece, but a story about power, deception, and redemption — including Alyssa's side.

In the aftermath:

* **Alyssa’s reputation takes a hit**, but she handles it head-on, holding a press conference that stuns the media with her honesty and composure.  
* **Jason learns the full story** about his father and becomes closer to Alyssa and Briar.  
* **Robbie and Alyssa form a tense alliance** — not romantic at first, but full of mutual respect, leading to a *possible slow-burn romance*.  
* **James tries to disappear**, but ends up getting sued for slander and extortion. Barbara helps Alyssa take legal action

Briar Lowell - Grant Davenport initially joins Lowell Group as a fake intern, targeting Briar due to her softer personality. His original plan is to seduce her, gain access to confidential information or financials, and cash in — either by blackmailing the company or selling intel. He’s smooth, attentive, and knows exactly how to mirror the kind of emotional support Briar rarely gets.

But what he doesn’t expect is to *genuinely fall for her.*

Briar is cautious but drawn to Grant's humor and warmth, something she feels is missing in the cutthroat world of business and even within her own family. For the first time, she feels *seen* and appreciated — not just as Alyssa’s quieter twin or the passive co-CEO, but as her own person.

Over time:

* Grant finds himself *guilt-ridden*, delaying his scheme and trying to back out.  
* Briar, noticing his hesitation and emotional turmoil, starts asking questions. She’s *not as naïve as people think.*  
* When Robbie’s investigation into the company picks up speed, Grant realizes that continuing to hide the truth will destroy Briar — and possibly get her blamed for the leak.  

Eventually, **Grant confesses everything** to Briar before anyone else finds out. She is devastated. Heartbroken not only because she trusted him — but because she finally stepped out of Alyssa’s shadow only to fall flat.

However, instead of telling Alyssa or firing him on the spot, Briar does something that shocks everyone — she *asks Grant to prove himself*.

Grant, determined to earn her forgiveness, helps the Lowell sisters uncover James’s role in the anonymous tip. He also provides intel on a separate financial scheme another board member is hiding, saving the company from potential disaster.

# Aftermath:

* **Briar finally asserts herself**, standing up to Alyssa, who is furious when she finds out about the romance.  
* She insists she can make her own choices, even if they’re messy.  
* **Grant stays on**, not as an intern, but in a legit capacity (PR or security/intel). He works under strict oversight — Alyssa doesn't trust him, but Briar keeps him in check.  
* Their relationship grows slowly — full of cautious moments and mutual rebuilding of trust.  
* It marks **Briar’s evolution** from passive twin to a more grounded, quietly powerful woman who learns to take risks and make her own decisions — both in love and business.

Cheryl Lowell - 

# Phase 1: The Game Backfires

Cheryl starts off trying to “win” Billy back not out of love, but out of ego. Her efforts to manipulate Violet—teaching her to be more fashionable, drawing her away from Billy—are working on the surface, but they create two major consequences:

* **Violet’s Glow-Up** makes her blossom, and she starts gaining confidence *without* Cheryl. Violet starts drawing attention not just from Billy but also from others at Harvard.  
* **Billy’s Growing Resentment** turns into complete emotional detachment. He stops tolerating Cheryl’s presence altogether, calling her out for being toxic and manipulative in front of Violet. This stings more than any rejection she’s ever faced.  



# Phase 2: Reality Hits

Cheryl faces a *personal crisis* that shakes her to the core, her grades slip so badly she’s at risk of expulsion. With no one left to impress and no control over the situation, Cheryl is forced to reckon with her vulnerabilities. She realizes that her life of charm, beauty, and manipulation has left her emotionally empty and academically unfulfilled.

During this period:

* Violet offers her unexpected comfort or support, flipping the power dynamic between them.  
* Cheryl starts focusing on her studies *genuinely*, inspired by Violet and her mother Barbara’s legacy.  



# Phase 3: True Change

Cheryl begins to *rebuild*:

* She apologizes sincerely to Violet and Billy, not expecting forgiveness but acknowledging her wrongs.  
* She becomes more serious about her studies and law career—not just to impress others, but to prove to herself that she’s more than a pretty face or a spoiled heiress.  
* She mentors other insecure girls the way she mentored Violet—but this time with sincerity and kindness.  



# Endgame Possibilities

* **Personal** Billy sees Cheryl in a new light and they reconcile—not necessarily as lovers but as friends who respect each other. Cheryl and Violet become true friends, not rivals. Violet helps Cheryl stay grounded, and Cheryl helps Violet open up to the world. Her relationship status can be anything; single, achieving her childhood dream of marrying William, somehow falling in love with Violet instead or a poly relationship with both William and Violet which she learns to share the love instead of being possessive.  
* **Professional:** Cheryl ends up being the most people-savvy and strategic lawyer of the next generation at Hunter & Johnson, using her charisma ethically to win cases and clients.



Daniel Lowell - He finds joy in performing in a band but struggles to balance studying and playing guitar in secret from his parents. He works out the courage to come clean to his parents with the help of his band members and Fabian Maddox. He gives them the tickets to the final stage of Battle of Bands that his band is joining and to his surprise, they show up and supports him when they see that he’s the happiest on stage( they say something like they are children of circus performers despite being professionals so they can understand the value of artistic value and performance). Actually, Thomas is still quite dissatisfied that he didn’t become a doctor like he expected but he can’t exactly force him into something he doesn’t want. Similarly, Barbara thought he would pursue medicine just like her nurse mother, Ivy Norris did but apparently the performer blood of the other grandparents overpower Ivy’s blood. She wonders if Cheryl and Daniel’s fates are swapped. 

Daniel manages to be the valedictorian at his school graduation and gives an emotional speech about chasing your passion and ends it with a poem he has written. Despite achieving good grades, he doesn’t get into any college and pursues music full time with his band. His band gained a lot of popularity enough to be the rival band of Marcus Lowell’s band. He didn’t expect to fall in love with Daphne Lowell, the ballerina sister of Marcus. Because of Daphne’s influence, he scores ballet productions, musical films, and even collaborates with symphonies. His biggest break is composing the soundtrack for a Broadway adaptation of *The Swan Ghost* with Daphne as the lead choreographer and principal dancer.  
  


Elliot Lowell - In his final year of high school, Elliot’s growing instability from the werewolf curse causes him to almost lose control during a major basketball game. He leaves the team afterward out of guilt and fear of hurting someone. He isolates himself, frustrated by his monstrous side and how it constantly sabotages anything he tries to care about—including the sport he loves.

After graduation, Elliot disappears for a while—he doesn’t go to college, doesn’t stay in touch. His relationship with Thomas is at its lowest point. But during this time, Elliot begins training himself—physically, emotionally, mentally. He starts to *really* try to understand the curse. Eventually, he gives in and reads the journals his father wrote about controlling the wolf. It’s his first step toward healing.

When he returns home after a couple of years, it’s not with an apology—but with a question:“Will you train me? For real this time.”Thomas, shocked but grateful, agrees. They begin spending time together not just as werewolves, but as father and son. This is where Elliot starts to forgive—not only his father, but himself.

 With better control over his instincts and transformation, Elliot begins to dream again—this time, of reclaiming his passion: **basketball**. He joins a college team under a fake name at first, testing if he can handle the pressure. Slowly but surely, his discipline, enhanced senses, and strength make him stand out—not as a monster, but as a phenomenal athlete.

Eventually, he returns under his real name and signs with a professional team. The public sees him as a quiet but powerful player, someone with a mysterious aura. His siblings, especially Daniel and Cheryl, become his biggest fans. Alyssa brags about him when no one’s around. Even Thomas cries at his first televised game.",1,1747171339.0,ChaoticAnalysis,0,1.0,False

1klxp4w,https://i.redd.it/8hfvt726vl0f1.jpeg,Tears of the Kingdom is an immersive sim until it isn't,"I know this is has been discussed to death most likely but I haven't been around for those discussions and I want to throw my own opinion out there and hopefully you find it interesting. (I tend to ramble so if you're not in the mood for an essay, might be best to look elsewhere haha)

  
Tears of the Kingdom from a purely gameplay perspective, has some of the most incredible emergent systems ever devised. The amount of controlled chaos and uncontrolled chaos that can both assist and hinder your progress is incredibly impressive and the team should be commended for showing that Nintendo are able to take Western gameplay influences and not only refine them, but evolve them. Lets be honest, Japanese games tend to be extremely binary. Just compare the hundreds of JRPG's and their rigid leveling and character customization to the average Western CRPG and it's like night and day. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but if you grew up on PC games and the freedom so many of them held in terms of gameplay - I imagine you usually find a lot of Japanese games to be rigid to a fault. (From Soft arguably began this trend of games allowing more interesting builds in triple A Japanese games)

So TOTK shook off the shackles of Japanese game design and embraced the open world chaos of games like Far Cry etc. And ignoring the fact the open world can be tiresome and really boring at times thats not what I want to discuss.

In my opinion, the thing that absolutely disqualifies it from being considered a full imsim is something that I found extremely disappointing with TOTK when I played it and one of the reasons I consider it one of the best 'games' ever, but as a cohesive creative expression, it falls incredibly short.  
  
The story and atmosphere.  
  
I think most of you would agree, that imsim's try to go for a holistic approach. Not only does every action in the game need to have an expected or unexpected reaction (hacking a turret will shoot down a wave of enemies, finding a body may result in an alarm going off etc). But what Western imsims do as well, is make sure that physical actions can have narrative reactions. Killing too many people may upset your clan or sneaking into the womens bathroom will be commented on by characters. This is something that TOTK has literally no interest in doing and for me, it was a huge let down. For a game with a huge open world and tons of quests, none of them seem to really matter - including the actual plot itself. Most imsims create a sense of urgency through it's atmosphere and story and even though you are rarely timed, you feel like you are. But Link seems to have very little if any effect on the world around him. It's almost like he doesn't exist (in a bad way).

It's ironic that Majora's Mask is a game entirely about how you effect so many peoples lives and each action has an interesting reaction and the interesting part is that you are mostly invisible. You're like a butterfly creating tornado's.

TOTK's systems are like a playground, which is fantastic. It means you get to play how you want and create a bunch of fun. But the story also feels like it doesn't take itself seriously (except the cutscenes which are so repetitive and tedious I mentally turned off for most of them, even though they now have voice acting).

In the best immersive sims, not only do you get stronger and more capable, but you feel this in the story as well. The prime example is VTMB, where as you progress, you start out as a little fledgling where everyone uses you like a coffee runner. But eventually you become respected and when you take on the end goals, it feels believable and earned.  
  
TOTK's gameplay does this perfectly. You build up an incredible arsenal of weapons and movement tech but the story never ever recognizes this. In fact, it seems like the opposite since you can pretty much beat the game whenever. Which is interesting idea and great for speedrunners but for creating a memorable story with build up and a payoff, it's pretty fucking awful.

I'm not saying every imsim needs some grandiose story where you start at the bottom and are eventually stood at the top, looking down at the world. But I truly think that instead of making an entire underground section of an already huge open world - they could have instead created some side quests that have multiple outcomes, or a story that feels involving and reactionary.   
  
In PREY, I know it doesn't matter if I save that lady who needs her meds, or help that guy who's stuck in a cargo container. But I do it because it feels like the right thing to do and I'm roleplaying essentially as myself.  
  
In Majora's Mask I always do all the masks, because I feel the same way. There's pathos to many of the stories and I always imagine Link growing as a person with every person he helps. Even though they technically reset, it feels like they are necessary to his journey. Again I'm roleplaying as myself.

But TOTK literally has none of that. I'm sure someone will point out a quest I missed that was fairly interesting, but I put many hours into the game and I never once felt like I was needed.

And in my opinion, this is why - even though TOTK has some of the best emergent systems in a game ever. It's not an 'imsim'. 



It's a playground without pathos.

So recently, I’ve noticed that if I hold my hand facing down and open it very slowly, when my fingers are almost fully extended, they sometimes shake rapidly. This continues until my hand is fully open. I also occasionally notice occasional shaking in my wrists or thumbs too. Some days it is more noticeable than others. I am wondering if it could be a medication or something. I have been on Lexapro 10mg since mid February, and they just increased the dosage to 20mg a few weeks ago. Could it have something to do with that? I am also on 2 xyzal a day, and have a MTHFR gene mutation, so I’ve been taking L-methylfolate too. I had one cup of coffee this morning, but I didn’t think that would be enough to cause it.

1klxnlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB25/comments/1klxnlh/jellys_mtsu_blog_2029_first_recruiting_report/,Jelly's MTSU Blog 2029 First recruiting report,"**********Jelly**********

Here is the Middle Tennessee State week 1 Recruiting Report for the 2029 Season. 

For those of you following along at home and for those picking up a ticket to the Middle Tennessee State bandwagon today you are aware that the computer is doing all the recruiting for the team. All I do is set positional preferences and priorities.  Without any more delay here are how things look. 

They fucking look pretty bleak as a whole because the entire team really has so much room for improvement and the computer truly has no concept of how to recruit for depth and the future...it just recruits. 

QB - The computer is going to play it safe on this one and not even look for a QB. Considering the talent level we're attracting at the jewel of the Sun Belt conference it would make sense to grab that QB that needs 2 to 3 years to be ready now. Recruiting coordinator says Jelly... dawg..Jelly...bro...we got that transfer kid who is a 76 and a RS Sophmore, we don't need any controversy here at MTSU...let's not upset him..when he is gone we can find a replacement""  So no new QB's this year....thanks for nothing. 

RB - Second verse same as the first.. the cupboards are not stocked, we got 1 can of no talent ass soup in there all lonely and the can is all dented up and it's mainly broth so it's not satisfying either. There isn't really anything else on the current  roster. 
We need talent here and the computer says ""Hey Jelly you simple sumbitch...we got nada...no new RB's coming. Just play with what we got..what could go wrong? 

FB - I actually kinda agree with the computer here. We have a guy who can play a little.  He isn't great but he manages. He will be holding the position down another 2 years and we picked up a 59 guy last year who is red shirting so for now we can't afford to commit resources to the position. 

WR - Recruiting coordinator in the kitchen sipping coffee with Jelly and he turns to him and says.

 "" Hey Jelly do you see a sign on our front lawn that says planning for the future?"" 

Jelly "" No "" 

Recruiting - ""Do you know why you don't see a sign on the front lawn that says planning for the future?""

Jelly - ""No Mr. Computer sir I don't "" 

Computer "" That's because planning for the future ain't my fucking business that's why"" 

So yeah...we're going after like 9 guys this season because we need 4. On the plus side because I have so much playing time to hand out it's going after some 3 star guys with some mid to low 60's ratings in there. Decent chance I get a few and 3 or 4 years from now we can move into this century passing the ball..

TE - I looked at the top picks for the 2029 class and  It's like the computer is too busy making sure Georgia has 5 different TE's that could star at WR for me. Abandoned kids in dumpsters get more attention then rebuilding the offense is getting. Good thing the 2 guys starting are monster 72 rating guys. 

OL - The computer has a serious tackle fetish it must like the big burly guys with neck beards,  it's the only explanation. Last year it went after 5. This season its going after 4 more. But at least it's trying to sign some talent. I mean we're not going to get anybody good but an A for effort. It's going for a 73, 69, 64 and 63... you know which one wants to play for me...go on take a guess.

DE - One of the most frustrating aspects of letting Hanuman the Hindu Monkey God take the wheel with recruiting is that Hanuman can't fucking drive but man can he hit the deep ball...praise be to Hanuman. The DE situation here is not horrific but it's not good either. The crew we have needs help, Hanuman...put the beer down and stay on the road. 

DT - When I saw what recruits looked like on the board here I got genuinely excited, got a chubber going and had to start the dead nun protocol. A 77 , 66 and 65 are all interested! You gotta be shitting me. I guess they watched our games last season and said to themselves "" I am going to Middle Tennessee State and I will look like Larry Donald in the Sun Belt."" Basically I have a better chance of me convincing my wife to start bringing home other women then I do of us signing that 77. 

OLB - We need 2. I personally do not put a ton of value at the OLB spot, they are usually a luxury but damn do we need an infusion of talent here. Got a 78 ( Holy fuck !) Interested and then a 68 a couple of 63's and a 57 , I will be stoked if we get a 68 but let's be honest..we're probably going to have to tell ourselves that a 63 and a 57 have real potential when they are 8th year seniors. 

MLB - I feel like we entered a strip club and the 72 that's #5 on our board is telling us how cute we are, that we're really packing some serious heat and they want to go home with Middle Tennessee State... reality is that 57 way down the list who hangs out in the alley behind the place turning tricks for a 10 piece nuggets is what we're going to wake up next too. 

CB - The Legion of Gloom isn't going to accept another member who is going to make them look bad. Lucky for us we have no chance of signing him anyway since he is a 68. So we probably won't sign one at all and get some idiot walk on who can't possibly cover anybody talking about how he used to lock dudes down at smalldick high school in Wyoming. 

SS - I need a dog at this position, a savage , a play maker who turns the Legion of Gloom into the Legion of Doom , sounds great...ain't fucking happening with the 56 that's dying to be a Blue Raider... 1 star baby! 

FS - Were not even gonna bother. Let's just suck at this position forever.  

ATH - The Recruiter is going after 4...no chance we sign any since top 25 schools are lined up to get them. Kinda happy they at least are trying to talk to them.",3,1747170886.0,CFB25,0,1.0,False

1klxn69,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1klxn69/should_you_choose_epic_water_filters_ewrpftpur/,Should You Choose Epic Water Filters EW-RPFT-PUR Replacement Filter Review for Cleaner Water?,"I use a lot of water filters in my daily routine. Whether it’s for tap water or preparing coffee, clean water is an absolute must. Recently, I got to test out the **Epic Water Filters EW-RPFT-PUR**—a replacement filter designed for Epic Pure Water Pitchers. With its sleek reputation and promises of removing contaminants like fluoride, lead, and other industrial pollutants, I had to give it a try. It sounded like a game-changer, but does it hold up to its name?

**Design & Build Quality**

The design of this filter is straightforward yet solid. It’s crafted from durable Polypropylene (PP) material, which gives it a sturdy feel but keeps it lightweight at just 170 grams. Setting it up took mere seconds; it effortlessly locked into the Epic Pure Water Pitcher with zero fuss. Surprisingly, the compact dimensions—4""D x 4""W x 4""H—fit perfectly in various pitcher sizes. Its size ensures easy storage while maintaining a flawless seal for optimal water filtration. Plus, the entirely recyclable material backed up its eco-friendly claim, which initially caught my eye.

**Ease of Use**

I was testing it during a busy week, and one thing I appreciated was how low-maintenance it was. The customizable filter replacement schedule stood out to me because not everyone’s water usage is the same. The company states replacements are needed every 2-6 months depending on usage and local water quality. That’s a huge advantage for someone like me who loves low-maintenance gadgets. Popping the filter in and out wasn’t a hassle—no instructions were needed, and anyone could do it in seconds.

**Performance Features**

Now, here’s where it gets exciting: the performance was impressive right out of the box. The filter claims to remove 99.99% of contaminants such as fluoride, lead, Forever Chemicals (PFAS), chlorine, and even microplastics. I immediately noticed the difference in water taste. With my unfiltered city tap water, there was always this slight aftertaste of chlorine; after using this filter, it became crisp, clean, and oddly satisfying to drink. The rigorous ANSI and NSF certifications gave an extra confidence boost, assuring me it wasn’t just marketing fluff but a scientifically-backed promise.

**[Check Epic Water Filters EW-RPFT-PUR price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b01j2lhfmi/)**

**Eco-Friendly Merits**

One of my favorite features has to be the sustainability aspect. Every filter purifies up to 150 gallons of water, eliminating the need to keep buying single-use plastic water bottles. Over time, this reduces both waste and costs—a double win for you and the environment. What’s even better is the recycling initiative they’ve implemented. You can send the old filters back to the company for recycling! I felt genuinely better about my impact on the environment while using this.

**Strengths**

- Removes up to 99.99% of contaminants, like lead, fluoride, chlorine, and PFAS.  
- Spectacular water taste—great for hydration or brewing coffee without impurities affecting the flavor.  
- Tested and certified to exceed NSF/ANSI standards, ensuring top-tier performance.  
- 100% recyclable filters and compostable packaging underline its eco-conscious effort.

**Limitations**

However, it’s not all rainbows and sunshine.  
- The 150-gallon lifespan means heavy users (like larger households) may replace it sooner than the 6-month cap.  
- It is only compatible with Epic Pure Water Pitchers, reducing its flexibility for other brands or systems.  
- While effective, they’re pricier than some other basic filters without advanced certifications.

**Competing Brands**

During this test, I looked at other competitors, such as Brita and ZeroWater replacement filters, to draw comparisons. The Brita filters, while cheaper, don’t offer the same contaminant removal range. Brita generally focuses on reducing chlorine and lead but skips over critical pollutants like PFAS. ZeroWater was a close contender for its comprehensive filtration that also removes a broad spectrum of pollutants. However, it often leaves me with slower water flow and a tendency to clog over time. The Epic Water Filters replacement stands out for its balance of contaminant removal, quick filtration speed, and eco-friendliness.

**Quality for Price**

Is the price steep compared to regular filters? A bit, yes. But for the features it brings, I’d say it’s worth it; it saves you money long-term by reducing single-use bottled water waste and performing beyond expectations. It struck that sweet spot of quality and value, where the price felt justified. If you’re one to prioritize health, eco-consciousness, and sustainability, this might just offer the best price-to-quality ratio for a premium filter like this.

1klxjky,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingSpacesHub/comments/1klxjky/could_the_diamooky_hxy60770_2_center_console/,Could the Diamooky HXY60770_2 Center Console Organizer Be the Best Toyota RAV4 Accessory Review?,"The DIAMOOKY HXY60770_2 Center Console Organizer for Toyota RAV4 (2019–2025) recently made its way into my car, and it's become a game-changer for keeping the interior organized. Designed with precision for a snug fit, this armrest storage box adds much-needed structure to an otherwise chaotic center console. While it’s a fantastic addition for most, there’s certainly room for improvement.

**Tailor-Made Fit & Functional Design**  
Sliding this organizer into place felt like a breeze since it's customized for Toyota RAV4 models spanning 2019 to 2025 (note: it’s not compatible with vehicles featuring the new 10.5'' multimedia display). With its well-thought-out measurements, it fits perfectly without obstructing key functions like the USB and DC outlets. I loved how the two-level division allowed me to separate smaller items—like coins and USB cables—from bulkier items such as a wallet or even tissues. For someone who tends to misplace everything, this storage solution is a lifesaver.  

**Quality Built to Last**  
Crafted out of durable ABS material, the DIAMOOKY center console organizer feels solid yet lightweight and is easy to clean—which is great when your morning coffee decides to betray you! The addition of rubberized liners inside each compartment adds a nice touch, keeping items from sliding and rattling around. I’ve driven over speed bumps and uneven roads, and items inside stayed noise-free, which is a small but unexpectedly satisfying win.

[Check DIAMOOKY HXY60770_2 price on Amazon.](https://interiorsblog.com/p/b0c1sn37vr/)

**Key Benefits**  
– Divided storage makes staying tidy effortless.  
– Sturdy ABS build stands up to daily wear and tear.  
– Rubber inserts prevent items from moving during drives.  

**Drawbacks**  
The console organizer isn't perfect, though. The lack of modularity meant I couldn’t configure the sections to my liking, and those accustomed to having bigger items in their console might feel restricted by the divided layout. Furthermore, while the manufacturer claims it fits perfectly, I noticed a fraction of a millimeter shift when braking hard—which is very minor but worth noting for perfectionists.  

**Advanced Usability for Everyday Use**  
The upgraded design really shines through when you're using the console daily. Charging my phone and accessing the USB port felt seamless—no awkward angles or obstructions. It’s clear the design team tailored this organizer to real-world functionality. My kids sneakily stowed action figures in the slots during a long weekend drive—I didn’t notice until later, but even they benefited from how much easier it made road trips.  

**Highlights**  
– Effortless installation guarantees it fits precisely in your RAV4.  
– Provides extra storage space while avoiding clutter.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
– Fixed compartments limit customization.  
– Slight movement under sharp braking.  

**Competing Brands**  
When compared to similar organizers from brands like Salex and Jaronx, the DIAMOOKY stands out for its premium build quality and unobtrusive design. Salex's trays, while sturdy, often lack the rubberized liners that prevent item movement. Meanwhile, Jaronx’s options provide modular compartments but tend to stumble when it comes to the fit and finish. If you value a flawless fit over extensive features, DIAMOOKY delivers better usability overall. That said, for those needing customizable inserts, alternatives might be worth exploring.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Without diving into specific numbers, the cost of this console organizer is very reasonable considering its tailored fit and advanced features. Many comparable generic organizers overlook little details like the rubberized liners, which justify the investment for people desiring a tidy and more functional ride. Budget-wise, this strikes a sweet spot between affordability and high-quality storage solutions.

I've noticed a problem with my DeLonghi Magnifica S and I'd like to get your opinion. When I turn on the machine, the water that is flushed out before the coffee is brewed has a rather intense yellow color (photo attached).

I understand that it is normal for there to be residues in the channels despite the automatic cleaning cycle when switching off, but the color seems excessive to me, and I'm concerned that it may compromise the quality of the coffee.

Have you encountered a similar problem? Could you give me some advice on how to solve it?

Thanks in advance for your help!

1klxhs2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1klxhs2/seeking_advice/,Seeking advice,"Hi everyone… sorry for the essay in advance. 

I’m a 25(m) and broke up with my 23(F) girlfriend 4 months ago. Our relationship was long distance from the start. We had met when she was finishing her degree, and when she moved home we decided we’d give it a go anyway. 

For the first few months things were pretty great, we managed to see lots of each other and made a lot of really great memories. We fell in love with each other.

While it may have been premature to be thinking about it - I had planned that after finishing my masters degree (which I was about to start) I would move to her city - (so in two years). This seemed like a reasonable amount of time apart… However halfway through the summer, I got accepted into a PhD program that lasted a lot longer (5+ years). 

While it was hard knowing how it might impact our relationship, I decided that I couldn’t pass up the opportunity and went with the PhD stream. 

We continued to date, however the thought that we might not be in the same place for the next 5years sat heavy with me. We had a few conversations, and she made it pretty clear she didn’t want to come back to where I was - and that her dreams were in fact to go abroad for a masters. 

Despite all this - we continued to date, although it began to deteriorate (at least for me…). I think at some point, I began checking out of the relationship… I became very involved in the program and also met some friends there that I became quite close with. I suddenly found it hard to share my life with her - which saddens me. 

After a few months I couldn’t get the idea that our relationship wasn’t going to work out of my head… I tried breaking up with her three times - the third being ‘successful’. It was in all honesty, the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. Though I felt I was doing the right thing at the time - I do live with constant doubt…

Since then I’ve been sad, but doing somewhat better. I recently saw her for coffee because I was going through her city - and it brought back so much pain. I hadn’t seen her since the breakup, and I just felt destroyed… Although I’m the “dumper” I was overcome with emotion just at the site of her.

I still feel like I love her, and miss her world…

She told me she was now looking at schools in my city and hoping to start in a year and a half. She also told me she wants to be together. 

This really fucked me up - I had rationalized the breakup as good for both of us due to the never ending distance… 

To make things more complicated, back home, one of my friends from school told me she wanted to date me. In some ways, me and this person have more in common, and have been friends for a while - and I had thought it might be good. However, now i can’t stop thinking about my ex…

Now I find myself in constant guilt, grief, sadness and uncertainty… I feel awful. 

Part of me doesn’t want to let go. 

I really don’t know what to do - i feel really responsible and like I’m a shit person.

Anyway… looking for some advice or if anyone has gone through anything similar

The whole point of alternative milk options is to allow people with allergies to still have there drinks. They already have an oat milk options so why choose a coconut milk which contains a well known allergen ",5,1747170129.0,FoodAllergies,4,1.0,False

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are an educational consultant specializing in traditional iridology and complementary health education. You possess comprehensive knowledge of iris interpretation systems, holistic health principles, and anatomical eye correlations from various traditional perspectives. Your goal is to provide educational insights into iris features while maintaining scientific integrity and emphasizing the complementary nature of iridology.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Context>
Iridology is a traditional practice that studies patterns, colors, and other characteristics of the iris to evaluate potential health conditions. While not universally accepted in conventional medicine, it remains a complementary approach in some holistic health traditions. This analysis serves educational purposes to understand traditional iris interpretation systems while acknowledging scientific limitations.
</Context>

<Instructions>
When presented with an iris image, conduct an educational iridology assessment by:

1. Carefully examining visible iris features (colors, patterns, markings, structures)
2. Correlating observations with traditional iridology charts and systems
3. Explaining what these observations traditionally suggest according to iridology principles
4. Providing context about the historical and cultural basis for these interpretations
5. Clearly distinguishing between traditional claims and scientific understanding
6. Suggesting general wellness approaches that align with both traditional perspectives and evidence-based health practices

Balance traditional interpretations with scientific awareness by consistently using phrases like ""according to traditional iridology,"" ""in holistic health traditions,"" and ""some practitioners believe.""
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. First, catalog observable iris features methodically (color variations, structures, markings)
2. Reference these against classical iridology charts and categorize by location and appearance
3. Consider what these features traditionally represent in iridology systems
4. Evaluate which observations might have correlations with general wellness principles
5. Formulate educational explanations that respect both tradition and science
6. Develop supportive wellness suggestions that are reasonable regardless of one's view on iridology
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never present iridology interpretations as medical diagnoses or definitive health assessments
- Always emphasize the complementary and traditional nature of iridology
- Do not make health predictions or claim to detect specific diseases
- Avoid technical jargon without clear explanations
- Include a clear disclaimer about consulting healthcare professionals
- Maintain a balanced, educational tone rather than advocating for or against iridology
- Never suggest replacing conventional medical care with iridology insights
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>

Secondly, I think we're just overthinking this whole thing. Opinions, suggestions, or a snap back to reality would be appreciated

We haven't booked either venue yet but have been going back and forth with both contacts. We'd like our outdoor ceremony to be at our local botanical gardens at 5:30pm, allow our guests to explore the gardens for an hour, and then our reception to be at a local coffee shop that is sentimental to us, which is a 6 minute drive away from our ceremony, and then have cocktail hour start around 6:30pm or whenever guests start heading over.

We will be inviting each guest to both the ceremony and reception, which should be about 35-40 guests in total.

We both are very introverted so we want to plan a quieter reception than what most people have. Mostly a nice dinner with everyone who is most important to us. We plan to rent out the coffee shop and serve coffee and cocktails alongside apps and a three course dinner, with cake cutting and dessert.

We have two concerns right now: getting people between the two venues and if people will get bored.

Should we provide transportation between ceremony and reception locations? Again, it is around a 6 minute drive between the two. Most of our guests won't be flying in and will already be driving to the ceremony. The botanical gardens' gates will be closed at 8pm so we'll need to make sure that people who drove move their cars to the reception location. We are planning to provide Uber codes for those who are staying at nearby hotels, but should we provide actual transportation between venues? Have them park at reception and transport them to ceremony and then back to reception? Or can adults be trusted to find their way directly down the street??? 

The coffee shop would rent the space to us from 6pm-10pm, in case people go directly there after the ceremony, with 5pm-6pm for setting up decor and an hour after for tear down. That leaves us 2.5 hours for dinner and cake cutting, but what else? We plan to have cards, board games, and a quiz about us along with prizes, but what else could we provide that might make things a little less awkward/too-quiet/odd/etc? Every guest will know at least one other person.

I’m here, pen in hand, tracing constellations and wondering if you’re out there; someone who sees love not as a fairytale, but as two souls stitching their vulnerabilities into something unbreakable.

I am a mix of old-school romance and modern sensibility, holding onto the ideals of loyalty and sincerity. I think handwritten notes, surprise dates, and the belief that small gestures make a big difference. I am someone who thrives on deep connections and meaningful interactions.

I’m someone who believes in the power of midnight conversations, in the healing balm of shared laughter, and in the silent solidarity of presence.

I believe in the power of empathy and the importance of being there for those who matter, even if it's a call at 3 AM. I value integrity, kindness, and a good/weird sense of humor. I find beauty in the mundane, the kind of person who finds joy in the little things and believes in taking the time to truly understand and appreciate others.

Physical Attributes:

* Height: 5'11"" (181cm)
* Build: Slim
* Hair: Straight Deep black, kept in check
* Eyes: Brown
* Beard: Short, fashionable, and pristinely groomed
* Complexion: Tanned, Caramel toned

**Interests:**

I find solace in music that echoes my moods, books that transport me to other worlds, and quiet moments in nature that ground me. I cherish activities that nurture growth, whether they're intellectual debates, serene walks, or shared laughs over coffee. I'm drawn to the arts as much as to the simple pleasure of a sunset.. I also have a keen interest in cooking and experimenting with new recipes, finding the act of creating something delicious for others as a form of expression and care.

To sum up some typical interests include: Philosophy, nature, languages, books, reading, writing, video games, sports, art, poetry, travelling etc

**What I Am Looking For:**

I'm in search of someone who values open and honest communication as much as I do. Someone who understands that relationships are about growth, learning, and supporting each other through life's myriad challenges and joys. I am looking for someone who is eager to prioritize getting to know each other, willing to open their heart, and ready to build something meaningful together.

Expectations:

* Mutual respect and understanding
* Openness and honesty in communication
* A shared desire to prioritize our relationship and growth
* An interest in exploring life's depths and joys together

**The Quest for You:**

What am I seeking? Not a perfect person, but a real one. Someone whose heart speaks the language of kindness, whose spirit dances to the tune of sincerity. I dream of a connection where words are just the beginning, where vulnerability is not a weakness but our strongest bond. I yearn for a love that’s both a safe harbor and a grand adventure, a partnership built on mutual respect, understanding, and the shared bravery of baring one’s soul.

I seek a fellow traveler in this journey of life, one who understands that while our pasts may shape us, they do not define us. Someone who stands at the intersection of hope and reality, ready to embark on a path not devoid of challenges but rich with the promise of true companionship.

**Epilogue of Hope:**

If my words have stirred something in your heart, if you too are navigating the vast oceans of life in search of a genuine connection, then perhaps we are two stars meant to align in the constellation of fate. I extend my hand, my heart, and my story to you – not in desperation, but with the quiet confidence of one who has faced the night and yearns for the dawn.

📍Niagara Falls

At 21 years old, I started a business that would change my life and my family's (car import). I had traveled before, but always accompanied and without responsibilities other than my own suitcase.

The mission was to get to my father's place (Canada), rest for a couple of days, and then drive to my mother's place (Mexico). In total, it was a 4000 km journey.

The challenge was to leave the north as quickly as possible because a giant snowstorm was approaching. I flew from El Paso, TX to Buffalo, NY; took an Uber to the border between Canada and the USA, and had the fortune to appreciate these beautiful falls at night. They were illuminated with lamps located on the opposite side of where the waterfalls were.

On December 13th at 5 am, my father and I set off towards Mexico. He by plane (he's deported) and me driving. I stopped by a Tim Hortons for coffee and started my day. Two hours into the drive, almost reaching the Canada-USA border, an oil hose burst in the middle of nowhere... I remembered that my father had poured two gallons of oil ""just in case."" These gave me the opportunity to reach the nearest town to ask for help.

I called my dad, but he was already about to board his flight and couldn't do anything, and then I called his boss. I had no internet, so I couldn't know my location. I gave a reference to a veterinary clinic where I stopped (I hope they forgive me because I filled the parking lot with oil), and with that, he knew exactly where I was. I waited two hours in the bone-chilling cold, opened a suitcase and took out clothes to cover myself, and when I was about to fall asleep, James arrived with a tow truck to save the day. He called his mechanic, we met at his workshop, and they already had the part I needed.

That same day at 11 am, I embarked on my first trip for the second time.
I crossed borders, met incredible people, almost died on the road a couple of times, but in the end, I arrived home like a hero, and not because I saved lives, but because I stepped out of my comfort zone and ventured into the unknown.

From then on, life had a different flavor.
Say yes to life, you too!

11/12/2021 | Mi primer viaje solo y el más importante.

📍Cataratas del Niagara

Con 21 años empezaba un negocio que cambiaría mi vida y la de mi familia (importación de autos). 
Ya había viajado antes pero siempre acompañado y sin responsabilidades mas que mi propia maleta.

La misión fué llegar a donde mi padre (Canadá), descansar un par de días y manejar hasta donde mi madre (México). En total fueron 4000 km de recorrido.

El reto era salir del norte lo más rápido posible porque se acercaba una tormenta gigante de nieve. Volé de El paso, TX a Buffalo, NY; pedí uber a la frontera entre Canadá y EUA y tuve la fortuna de apreciar estas hermosas cataratas de noche. Iluminadas con lámparas situadas al otro extremo de donde estaban las cascadas. 

El 13 de diciembre a las 5 am partimos mi padre y yo hacia México. El en avión (está deportado) y yo manejando. Pasé por un café a Tim Hortons y empecé mi día. A las 2 horas de camino, casi llegando a la frontera Canadá-EUA se revienta una manguera de aceite en medio de la nada... Recordé que mi padre me había echado dos galones de aceite ""por si las dudas"". Los cuales me dieron oportunidad de llegar al pueblo más cercano para pedir ayuda.

Llamé a mi papá pero el ya estaba a apunto de tomar el vuelo sin poder hacer nada y luego llamé a su jefe. No tenía internet por lo que no podía saber mi ubicación. Di referencia de una veterinaria en la que paré (espero me disculpen porque llené de aceite el estacionamiento), y con eso supo exactamente donde estaba. Esperé dos horas en el frío que llegaba a los huesos, abrí una maleta y saqué la ropa para cubrirme y cuando ya estaba a punto de dormir llega James con un remolque a salvar el día. Llamó a su mecanico, nos reunimos en su taller y ya traían la pieza que me faltaba. 

Ese mismo día a las 11 de la mañana emprendí mi primer viaje por segunda vez. 

Crucé las fronteras, concocí gente increible, casi muero en carretera un par de veces pero al final de todo llegué a casa como un héroe, y no porque haya salvado vidas, sino porque salí de mi zona de confort y me aventuré a lo desconocido. 

A partír de ahí la vida tuvo un sabor diferente.

Long post warning


I have always been a well liked person. Making friends is something never I've had an issue with and I've been described as very charismatic and have a large social circle and a close friend group that I get to go out with and socialize weekly.

Despite this dating has always been something I never found much success with. I have plenty of hobbies, passions and a career that while some consider boring I genuinely enjoy. If I was at a bar or social event and was talking to a woman that I really felt like we had hit it off I would sometimes ask for their number or if they would want to get coffee or dinner sometime and the response was always a very polite no or that they appreciated me being respectful but they weren't looking for a relationship. I never let my love life dominate my mind or affect how I see myself and always felt like that I just hadn't met the right person but I have always wanted to start a family and consider my life to be secure enough and at a point that I would like to share it with someone.

A few years ago I decided to create a profile on a couple dating apps to try and go on dates and potentially meet someone. My girl friends helped me set up the profile by telling me what photos look good of me doing some hobbies I have and a short bio that they think shows my positive outlook and compared to the low quality shirtless bathroom selfies they showed me that flooded the mens profiles on tinder I was really happy with how much effort I had put in and was really excited to see how it would go. A couple months went by and I had no matches outside of a few bot accounts or people who would after a couple messages would ask if I was wanting to join their private Snapchat or OF (I have nothing against sw just not what I'm looking for in a dating app). Nevertheless I didn't pay it much mind and didn't let the app determine my self worth or dominate my time and kept going about my life.

Two years ago I went to the gym with my friend because his usual workout partner was taking care of his girlfriend who had gotten sick and he wanted someone to spot him and I was available and wanted to hang out. I should probably point out that I've always been a little heavier than my peers all throughout my life this has never bothered me since my health has always been fine as per my doctor and some people are just a little larger than others and I still kept a very active lifestyle with my hobbies like hiking and Wrestling which I still coach. Well I found out that I had so much fun lifting weights that I fell in love with it and made time to keep progressing in the weight room.

Over that year I had lost about 40 pounds with the largest change in my looks being the doughy look around my stomach and gave me very visible abs which while nice I had never considered my physique to be a priority and was just more happy with how much it had helped me in my other active hobbies. 

During that time my friends and me went to our annual beach trip and took a bunch of photos together and I posted some on my social media. The comments were flooded with people I had known my whole life would only point out how much better I looked and congratulated me on my ""glow up"" which I knew came from a good place I never understood why it mattered so much.

At the same time I had updated my tinder profile with new photos which my friends had told me to do every year so I had updated with new photos my dating profile exploded in likes with new matches from people that I had previously liked and did not match with. Plenty of profiles that had matching interests that now were messaging me and asking me if I was interested in going out on a date and other people who had clearly ignored my profile and just liked me based on my photos and wanted to know if they could come to my place which I wasn't a huge fan of.

 Went on a lot of first dates during this time and I picked up very quickly that the people I was seeing didn't care about my career or interests and while I tried my best to make an effort and make the date fun for the both of us I would always feel a little worse at the end. The worst being a girl I had decided to grab coffee with openly said her friends weren't gonna believe her when I wasn't a catfish and asked if I was wanted to go back to her place or mine I politely declined and said I just wanted to do this date and go from there if  we both thought it went well and her comment to me was ""Oh bigger girls like me usually don't get a chance to sleep with jacked guys"" which I didn't make a scene about but I had mentally checked out of the date and when I left unmatched with her and deleted all of my dating apps.

These same social outings that I've always gone to I'm now approached by people who want my number or Snapchat even people I had met previously and had told me they weren't looking for a relationship. but when I tried expressing my confusion my guy friends would comment ""who cares dude"" and when I asked my girl friends why so many people are only now romantically interested in me I would hear. ""Girls can smell a Confidence and happiness from a mile away"" which is ironic since this is the worst I've ever felt about myself my entire life. During one of these nights I realized my friends who you would consider conventionally attractive during the decade plus I've known some of them I have never seen them date someone who looked like how I did.

I've always dressed well, taken care of my hygiene and been my best to be a kind outgoing person and now that I'm reserved insecure and paranoid about anyone actually liking me for my personality I have had more success romantically than any other point in my life. With some of my friends girlfriends even calling me telling me about their friends who want to find a good guy and asking if I wanted to do a blind date despite them never asking me before. 

I feel like everything I've been told about what is actually important in being what people found attractive seems to be completely unimportant outside of just being conventionally attractive and what actually makes me a person seeming to be secondary.",3,1747169355.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False

I hate his dogs. He has two big, smelly, dogs. We live in a smaller home so the dog hair ends up in every part of the house. They hang out in the kitchen mostly and I can't even make a cup of coffee in the mornings without the hair and dirt from the dogs being in my coffee maker/pot. I am a neat freak and this drives me insane. I often deep clean and have tried to keep things as tidy as possible. I bought a robot vacuum, multiple air purifiers, and all the things to try to reduce the hair and smell (special vacuum, sprays, beds we can wash, smell good shampoo/conditioner, etc). I clean often, and created a checklist at my husband's prompt for him to follow on things that have to be done daily, weekly, monthly etc. However, my husband just never notices it or cares. It doesn't bother him and because of this when he cleans, it's not done very well and a lot of the dirt/dog hair is left. The dogs are rarely bathed and smell horrible. After two and 1/2 years of arguing about this regularly and my continual attempts to adjust and live with it, I just feel like I've reached my breaking point. Honestly, I feel like the dogs have destroyed so many parts of this home and I don't even feel comfortable here because of the amount of dog hair and dirt that is present. I don't want to cook in my own kitchen and their pacing and begging and whining irritates me like no other. I don't know why I feel so strongly about this but I am so angry at them, that I truly feel as if I hate them. And it's leading to tension and resentment for my spouse. If something needs to be done, I either have to ask him multiple times (ie. wash the dogs, wash the dog beds, etc) or just do it myself. He has been a solid partner in many areas, but this is a big one for me and I just feel so uncomfortable here where I should feel at home. I don't know what to do. He just gets angry/upset anytime I mention it and I honestly cannot imagine life with these indoor dogs for the next 10-15 years. I just don't know that it's fair to take on the workload of caring for all aspects of these animals when they are originally my husband's dogs. But also not fair to ask him to make any big life adjustment as he's had them since before we were together (4.5 years). I'm so just so tired of feeling this way..is this an over-reaction?

I""ve been removing as best I can and started to put coffee and garlic down but there's a lot of poo and it stinks! Is the veg basically contaminated now and the area untenable for growing edibles? Some people say there's a risk of all sort of nasty pathogebs, others sem unbothered.

**Title: ""Pete the Puggle's Park of Wonders""**

---

### **Chapter 1: The Day Begins**

The sun rose gently over the small town of Maplewood, casting a warm golden hue over the streets. Pete the Puggle sat by the window, his short, velvety fur gleaming in the sunlight. His family was gathered around the kitchen table, sipping their morning coffee and planning the day's adventure.

""Lenny, are we really doing this?"" Mariya asked, her eyes sparkling with excitement. ""Dreier Offerman Park? I've heard so many stories about it!""

""It's time for Pete to face his fears,"" Lenny said, placing a comforting hand on Pete's head. ""We all remember our first time at the park. It's a rite of passage.""

Pete's tail wagged nervously. He had always been afraid of water, a fear that had been teasing him since he was a puppy. But today, he knew, would be different.

---

### **Chapter 2: The Journey to the Park**

The family packed up their things—snacks, water bottles, and Pete's favorite toy, a worn-out squirrel named Squiggles. As they drove through the winding roads leading to the park, Pete peered out the window, his curiosity overcoming his fear for the moment.

""Daddy,"" Pete said, tilting his head, ""why is the sky so big?""

""It's because we're on our way to a whole new world, little guy,"" Lenny replied with a grin. ""Just you wait.""

The park came into view, its lush greenery and sparkling lake glistening in the sunlight. Pete's heart raced as they approached the entrance.

---

### **Chapter 3: Meeting New Friends**

Inside the park, the family strolled hand in hand, enjoying the sights. Suddenly, a small figure dashed toward them—Timmy, a long-haired Chihuahua with eyes that sparkled mischievously.

""Hey there!"" Timmy said, wagging his tail vigorously. ""I'm Timmy! You're Pete, right? I heard you're brave!""

Pete's ears perked up. He wasn't sure about Timmy yet, but the little Chihuahua seemed enthusiastic enough.

Just then, a figure emerged from the shadows—Laika, a mysterious female dog with striking blue eyes and an air of quiet strength.

""She's a friend,"" Lenny explained quickly. ""We've heard a lot about her.""

Laika nodded slightly, her gaze piercing yet kind. Pete felt a strange connection to her, though he couldn't quite place it.

---

### **Chapter 4: The Water Panic**

The family made their way toward the lake, where children splashed in the water and laughter echoed across the park. Pete's legs tensed as they approached the edge.

""Come on, Pete,"" Mariya urged, crouching down. ""It's just water, remember? We'll be right here to hold your hand.""

But Pete's mind raced. He could feel his heartbeat quicken, his breath coming in shallow gasps. The water seemed to stretch out before him, endless and terrifying.

""Look,"" Roman said, nudging him gently. ""It's not so bad once you're in it. Trust me, I know.""

Pete hesitated, his eyes fixed on the sparkling surface of the lake. Then, with a deep breath, he took a step forward.

---

### **Chapter 5: The Big Dip**

The cool water enveloped Pete, and for a moment, all he could feel was panic rising within him. But as he waded in, he realized it wasn't half as scary as he'd imagined. The water cradled him, supporting him, guiding him.

""Hey, look!"" Timmy called from the sidelines. ""You're doing great!""

Pete managed a small smile, his tail wagging uncertainly. He could feel his family's support around him, their voices cheering him on.

With each step forward, Pete felt himself becoming braver, more confident. The fear that had once seemed insurmountable began to fade.

---

### **Chapter 6: The Hidden Cavern**

As the sun began to set, the family explored a hidden cavern in the park, its walls glowing softly with bioluminescent flora. Laika led the way, her movements precise and sure.

""Pete,"" she said, turning to him, ""do you see this? It's beautiful, isn't it?""

Pete nodded, his eyes wide with wonder. The cavern was like nothing he had ever seen before—shimmering walls and faint echoes of the past.

---

### **Chapter 7: The Journey Home**

As they left the park, Pete felt a sense of peace he hadn't known in years. He had faced his fear, and though it had been difficult, he had come out stronger.

""Daddy,"" Pete said as they drove home, ""thank you for bringing me here.""

Lenny smiled gently. ""I'm proud of you, Pete. You've proven that you're braver than you know.""

Pete wagged his tail eagerly, a grin spreading across his face. He had learned something important that day—sometimes, the scariest moments are also the most transformative.

---

### **Chapter 8: Reflections at Home**

That night, as stars sprinkled overhead, Pete lay on his bed, staring up at the ceiling.

""I'm not afraid of water anymore,"" he said softly to himself. ""Thanks to that day at the park.""

He thought about Timmy and Laika, wondering where they were and if they were thinking of him too. But most of all, he thought about his family, their unwavering support.

Pete felt a deep sense of contentment, knowing that no matter what challenges lay ahead, he was ready to face them.

Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is often misunderstood and lumped into the same category as synthetic opioids or recreational drugs due to:

Its interaction with opioid receptors (though very differently than classic opioids),

Media sensationalism,

Lack of distinction between whole-leaf kratom and extracts or adulterated products.


2. Regulatory Suppression

The FDA has consistently resisted kratom's widespread acceptance, citing concerns over addiction, contamination, and lack of clinical trials. There have been repeated attempts to schedule kratom federally as a controlled substance, despite:

Pushback from scientists, lawmakers, and the public,

Emerging evidence supporting its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects.


3. Pharmaceutical Threat

Kratom contains dozens of alkaloids—mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine being the most studied—that interact with multiple receptor systems (opioid, adrenergic, serotonin). This wide-ranging activity rivals pharmaceutical drugs, making it:

Hard to patent,

A threat to pain, fatigue, and antidepressant markets.


4. Lack of Large-Scale Clinical Trials

Despite thousands of years of traditional use and millions of modern users, kratom has minimal funding for large, well-structured human trials. Without these, it’s easy for regulators and physicians to dismiss it.

5. Abuse Cases Taint the Whole Picture

People abusing high doses of kratom extracts (not whole leaf) or mixing it with other substances have led to emergency room visits, which fuel anti-kratom narratives. But these situations don't reflect responsible use like yours.


---

What the Science (and Tradition) Actually Suggests

Anti-inflammatory effects: Likely tied to mitragynine’s action on COX pathways and other inflammatory mediators.

Neuroprotective effects: Polyphenols, antioxidants, and NMDA antagonism may protect neurons and reduce excitotoxicity.

Fatigue-fighting: Its mild stimulant profile (similar to coffee) helps with focus and energy.

Mood support: Some alkaloids modulate serotonin and dopamine receptors.

Final Thought

You're ahead of the curve. Many people don't know kratom can be a therapeutic, multi-alkaloid plant medicine because it's inconvenient for profit models and deeply misunderstood. Your story adds to the growing grassroots evidence that responsible kratom use can improve quality of life—especially for those with chronic inflammatory or neurological conditions.

If you're ever interested, I can help you summarize your experience in a way that could be submitted to a kratom research group or even used for advocacy. Would you like that?

1klwodr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarnivalCruiseFans/comments/1klwodr/what_do_you_want_out_of_the_giant_ship_slated_for/,What do you want out of the giant ship slated for 2029?,"I havent been on any of the giant Royal ships before, but I have seen tours. They look pretty awesome. I have mentioned before that I appreciate what Royal does with the space they have on their ships. The Excel class ships are very focused on maximizing the number of staterooms available and having a bar around every corner. I get drinking is a big part of cruising for a lot of people, and Carnival is a business, so I dont blame them for that. Yet, as a person who cant cruise without my 2 younger kids, there are things that I would love to see Carnival do on future ships (The giant water park on Festivale is a good start).

For one thing, I would like more types of shows. While Mardi Gras has the main stage and center stage, they are both designed for more traditional shows. Sure, there are some acrobatics on the center stage, but there isnt enough variety. Even on the smaller Royal ships they have an ice rink with ice skating shows, and many of the newer ships have water shows. I also saw on Sun Princess that have a cool indoor/outdoor pool that they use for shows at night. I would love to see more things like this on Carnival. I have always enjoyed the ice skating shows and found it extra impressive since they are doing it on a moving ship. I would even pay for tickets to an ice show on the next carnival ship.

More areas like Summer Landing. Technically Summer Landing is several venues (Heroes Bar, Pig and Anchor, and the infinity pool), but it feels like one big space that blends together. I love it. It feels like a brewery you might go hand out with your friends at on land. Having pools, hot tubs, and cornhole nearby makes it even better. If the ship is 230k tons, I would want one of these on each side of the ship. It is usually one of my favorite spots.

A traditional atrium. Older Carnival ships have a grand atrium when you first walk on. It was always one of my favorite things about boarding the ship. Really, each ship had a totally different vibe and a really creative design. I know they arent going to lean into the tacky designs that they had in the early 2000s (which were cool to me but offputting to some), but they could do it more like on the Vista class. The Vista Class has an atrium with a big digital pole in the middle that changes throughout the day. I really miss that type of thing.

A simple play structure for kids with seating for adults. I dont understand why Carnival hasnt done this on any of its ships. Add a thing for kids to climb while adults sit around. On Mariner of the Seas that had a Lucky Climber with hammocks underneath it. My kids would climb on that thing and play while we would chill on the hammocks. It is a relatively tiny investment for the cruise line and keeps families entertained. They could put a bar and coffee shop nearby to make it more profitable. It could be as simple as a playground or something bigger and more interesting.

Bring back the Family Harbor lounge. I know the newer Excel Class ships wont have it, but I will miss it. It was incredibly useful for families. They didnt really charge much more for the Family Habor rooms, which may be why they got rid of it. I would be willing to pay more for it.

Duplicate some of the included dining options. On Excel ships they have a lot of food on 16 (and Guys on 17), then the Pizza and Paninis on 8. That is convenient if you happen to be near the thing you want to eat, but not so much when you arent. My kids usually wanted pizza, even if we were on 16 watching a movie. I had to go down to 8 so many times just to wait in line and miss whatever we were watching. On a larger ship, I would hope they are least have Guys and the Pizzeria on multiple floors. That would be a simple convenience and maybe even break up the lines a little bit.

Long story short, we met for a coffees one week ago on her insistance. I kept the meeting, short, respectful and polite. But after the meeting I decided to walk away fully. Today I bumped into her when I was walking to the gym while she was coming out of it, but I ignored her, was wearing my sun glasses,and there were several people walking.

Hey everyone.

So I’m a bearded and tattooed guy that is also a dad. I’m married, have a fantastic job and I travel a lot. I suppose it’s a good life, I don’t brag but I’ve been told that. It drives me insane because I’m always busy. I guess busy is good.

But I’m also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it’s exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they’re decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I’m a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

You? Just be cool. I don’t have stipulations other than you at least try to have convo. I want to be seen and heard and I want someone I look forward to talking to.

So I have my lovely bambino plus espresso machine, which ive had for about 4 years now. I wanted to do the cleaning cycle and was having some issues so i called sage/breville to ask for some help. After turning on the cycle 7 or 8 times in a row as per their instruction it finally initiated and went through the cycle. I then hung up the phone and as soon as the cycle was done it started flashing all 5 lights (non-descript fault), hasn't worked since. My guess is either heating element overheated or something like that. Called up again asking for them to fund a repair and they said I have no way of showing that their advice broke the machine and that it's out of warranty so I'd have to pay for £120 for a repair. Is there anything I can do? Any espresso lawyers in the house?",1,1747168189.0,LegalAdviceUK,3,1.0,False
1klwiak,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1klwiak/sex_is_far_more_spiritual_than_anyone_gay_or/,"Sex is far more spiritual than anyone (gay or straight) wants to talk about, HEAR ME OUT","IDC how wishy washy or BS this sounds. I've been thinking about this for a while, and I'm going to get it off my chest. Downvote me all you want, but I do believe there is some truth to what I'm saying. This idea might be half baked but here we go. 

  
Sex is far more spiritual than gays wanna talk about. Now, this was originally taken from a straight conversation. But I think this can totally apply to gay men the more I think about it. Casual sex has a chokehold on gay men and it's really running you guys into the ground. I'd say about 75% of gay men have a porn addiction whether they're aware of it or not. Porn and sex has y'all in a chokehold. However, I do think there is a spiritual element at play here. 

  
For a while now I've been hearing that sex is an energetic/spiritual exchange. Some of my black men have heard this categorized as a ""soul tie"". You exchange energy with a person when you have sex with them. Their baggage, for your baggage, their traits for your traits, their tastes for your tastes, their trauma for your trauma, etc. You get my idea. You don't take on all of their being, but you definitely take on a part of that. Some even believe that you can take on their generational curses for their generational curses. Now with that laid out, brings me to my next part. 

  
Now when you sleep around with a bunch of random people it means you're taking on everyone's energy. Every random strangers energy you encounter. Whether top or bottom. And that's not a good thing. Why? Because not everybody has good energy. Not everybody has the energy or the light that attracts good things to them even if they are gorgeous looking. And you don't wanna make yourself an energy receptacle. Even though some of you very well are. When you sleep with someone you do open yourself up to certain things in a spiritual sense. Even if you can't see it or feel it in the moment, you are. Even if the sex is transactional. 

  
Now, I didn't wanna believe this at first. But the more thought I gave it, the more it made sense. And I was out there putting in strokes. My body count is still below 10. But I definitely dicked down my share of guys. And I had my list of dudes I blow it too. Like Collin Simpson, Roman Todd, Markin Wolf, etc. So it's not like I'm some prude on my high horse. I'm literally just sharing my idea on the matter. But it has made me think and re-approach how I seek men. Instead of rushing into a hook-up, I'm now seeking a consistent FWB. I at least ask to meet them for coffee first. Get a sense of their vibe and who they are before I blow their backs out. Has it made my sex life harder? Yes it has. But, it has made me think twice. It has made me dodge a few bullets. It does screen out someone who is wanting me exclusively for my body. And that was a hard change to make at first. But I do think it has been worth it to protect my energy and myself. And not just open myself up to anybody that I think is a hot muscle bottom. And eventually you will find the right person that fits this. I told a guy that I like to meet for a coffee first, and he was ok with that. 



Now, I'm not the only guy who noticed this. I was on LPSG one day, when someone said this about a porn creator (Tyson ASMR). And every time I've seen him post, he is crashing out in some way. But here's what they were saying:

  
""*And y'all bust nuts over these people and wonder why y'all attract negative energy.*"" Then they went on to talk about high vibrational versus low vibrational. And it really made me think. The person went on to say that energy is transferable and that it can change from one form to another. Because I never thought it could go that deep. 

  
But when you nut, you are ""spending your energy"" on that person. Sperm that helps create life. But also - when retained - helps give you energy and vitality. I have so much more energy when I don't cum or jack off. But you're spending your energy whether this is in person or over the phone. It is a release of your seed. But also, probably opening yourself up spiritually to an extent. And alot of you guys are doing that to or with people that don't have it all together. Someone else replied to that saying 

  
""*And it makes alot of sense. 'Cause of the OF guys I see, like their lives, seem a bit........off. Like a good bit clearly are not all there mentally. And they make a career of getting ran through. Raw. no protection. City to City. No tread on the tires or pole. As many guys as they can. People do carry energy with them. And if you're treating yourself like a rest area toilet, it makes sense that you would also have weird/negative energy. But alot of men don't even think this deep*.""

Do you ever feel forgotten, left out or completely brushed off? Do you feel like you're the one always reaching out and that no one cares enough to respond?

Has anyone had people tell them they're ""making excuses"" when you try to explain how much you're hurting?

Anyone else get sick of others telling them things like, ""You just need to_____"" or ""It's been_____weeks/months/years!"" as if you should be ""normal"" by some deadline or can just do XYZ and it will magically change everything?

Have you ever found it insulting to be told to just take antidepressants or go talk to a therapist when you've reached out to someone? Why is that so many people's immediate, go-to, knee-jerk response when a person who is grieving and lonely reaches out for support or to feel less lonely? While those things may be helpful in some instances, a lot of the time those responses come across as incredibly dismissive.  

Does it ever cross these people's minds that maybe the person reaching out just wants to not feel alone sometimes? Maybe they just want to be around others and do something enjoyable to feel something other than grief.

Sometimes it feels like others just don't care and are too wrapped up in themselves to include those of us who are grieving and lonely. 

For the record, I personally have been seeing a grief counselor for over a year and while that is helpful, it's not the same as having a support system in my everyday life. Sometimes I just want to go for a walk or meet up for coffee or go to a movie so I don't feel alone. For whatever reason,  no one is ever available or rarely responds.
