1lb9jgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/herbalism/comments/1lb9jgc/need_your_help/,NEED YOUR HELP,"Hey tea lovers,

I’m Isaac, a long-time tea drinker who’s honestly a bit fed up with how most tea brands out there feel the same: generic, safe, not much heart or innovation. So I decide to build the kind of tea brand I wish existed.

Tea is way more than just a beverage. Most people pound coffee, energy drinks, and caffeine to stay “productive” for school, work, meetings, etc. But how often do we actually take a moment to care for ourselves?

Tea, for me, is like an  pause button in the middle of our fast-paced life. A small, warm reminder that it’s okay to slow down, breathe, and just exist for a second to **reconnect with the world,** not for work, not for others, but for ourselves.

So here’s my plan, I’m launching 5 series of functional tea bags:

* Stress Relief
* Sleep
* Digestion
* Wellness Balance
* Energy Balance (Ginger based)

Every tea bag will have a little inspirational quote printed at the bottom. If you have any favorite short inspirational quotes that give you comfort, strength, or peace.

Inside had 3 pages of somewhat flirty mundane conversation between my partner and this other woman on DM on Instagram, and a slip of paper typed “you should know the type of man you’re living with.” 

Partner claims he knew this was a fake account and went with along the messages to mess with them over a period of 2 weeks (says he knows this is still a betrayal and said he has humiliated himself and me by doing it) this included arranging to go for a coffee. At the last minute, this profile told him she would never go on a date with him in a million years and had baited him into messaging. (The person did not include this part of the interaction in the post to me,  thats what he tells me , nor did they include the beginning of the messages, ).They have now sent these printed messages in the post to me.

I have never suspected him of cheating, he has never given me indication of doing so and no one else has either. We have been together for 3 and a half years.

1lb9ho0,https://i.redd.it/jpjy8bwmgw6f1.jpeg,☕️ Coffee Rating Update – Andhra Araku vs My Top Pick PR Vijaya!,"
Hey fellow brew hunters!

Today’s mission was inspired by a fellow Redditor who suggested Andhra Araku Coffee — and guess what? I finally tried it. Huge thanks to whoever dropped that rec 🙌

Rating: 4.5/5 ⭐

It actually matches my current fav PR Vijaya Cafe in rating. But… I’m still keeping PR Vijaya at the top of my list. Why?
	•	PR Vijaya: Classic, deep taste. Straight-up coffee power 💥
	•	Andhra Araku: Also great, but had this subtle Kopiko chocolate kinda note at the end. Interesting twist, but my tastebuds are old-school 😎

🔁 One small tip: Always try a place at least 3–4 times to get the real feel. During rush hours, the quality can dip a bit — even great cafes have off moments.

☕️ Here’s my current Pondy Coffee Leaderboard:
	

⭐ Rating.             Cafe Name.                   Location

4.5.                  Andhra Araku Coffee.      Anna Nagar
4.25.                      KBS Kofi Barr.             Mudaliarpet
3.75.                       Mission Cafe.           Heritage Town
3.5.                         Karthick Cafe.              Gorimedu
3.5.                       Karupatti Coffee.            MG Road

2.75.                   Tea Time (Opp. GH).      White Town


For context, I’ve been replacing my smoking habit (126 days clean!) by exploring cafes across Pondy and rating them. Full updated poster below ⬇️

Let me know what else I should try next!

Also, I was too lazy to type this, so I made GPT do it. Coffee’s working, my fingers aren’t ☕✌️

A curated offline learning club where each session is hosted by someone great at one thing — tech, creative, or soulful.

Think:

* Build your personal site live
* Journaling for clarity
* Breathwork + productivity
* Cocktail mixing
* Prompt engineering for AI tools
* Painting for non-artists
* Sketch-noting
* ...or whatever the group wants next.

Each session:

* 🎯 1 host
* 🪑 15-20 attendees
* 🕒 90–120 mins
* ☕ At a local café
* 💸 Small entry fee to keep it intentional + support the host & venue

No spam. No slides. Just thoughtful people learning something new together.

Over the past week I have been using an Indonesian coffee from Friedhats (Frinsa Lactic) and have been experinecing a bit of an issue when it comes to building pressure. I use 18g on an IMS h24 baristapro basket which is rated for 16-18g of coffee. When I grind on setting 7 on my DF54 I can build the 9 bars of pressure I have set my espresso machine to, but when I move to a coarser grind size i.e. 8-10, suddenly I can only build 6 bars of pressure and I'm not sure why. Do you guys have any insights into why this might be happening? I was thinking maybe that I am underdosing, but since the IMS basket is rated for 16-18g of coffee I'm not fully sure whether that is the issue. Does grinder alignment also sound like a problem that would be causing this low pressure build up from one grind setting to another? As I said I am not completely sure and would really appreciate it if someone could help me out. Thanks in advance :)",1,1749909693.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

You know, the “There is absolutely, no way that I have schizophrenia.. Thats a load of Horse Shit.” Well I used that time to be really introspective as Im an extrovert, by naturality. I was working on that art project and jamming some of my favorite bands from my teenage years, for the extra boost in creativity and inspiration. Along with a hefty cup of coffee. Well 3 days ago, prior to completing that project to be exact, and my new Dr. put me back on my originally prescribed meds, and also added strattera, for my ADHD. First time having meds for my adhd in 25 years.. I realized/noted that I fully realized the meaning to many Three Days Grace songs, aside from the previously understood Linkin Park connection..

But I had never thought about it.. Three Days Grace was a big one for my teenage years and 5 Finger Death Punch, always spoke to my “never give up” personality trait, listening to them daily while Professional Wrestling tenure and movie extra/choreography years in my 20s. Now 30+.

What’s some of the biggest, “Well no effin’ wonder!” Moments? Ive been adjusting but very minimal adjustments, back on meds especially the strattera.

But noticing the schizophrenic connection in Three Days Grace, made me realize I was probably schizophrenic all throughout my younger-teen years and obviously, could’ve had a much better GPA if that were realized. I was diagnosed ADHD as a pre-toddler and treated for it up til 10 years old when I started rebelling against the ADHD medicine.

1lb97hp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lb97hp/aita_in_this_situation/,AITA in this situation??,"TLDR at end ( check whole story though ) 
My ex 22 m and I 22f met at the age of 16 . A connection was built and it felt as we were in love . No commitment no relationship, just being together all the time . 
But soon everything changed .
One of his family member who was some wealthy guy with followers did something so so so  disgusting and criminal that gave me and my family immense amount of trauma . 
After that we go no contact . 

But my ex who was physically abused by the same guardian since 7 sent me a message over social media after 4.5 yrs  and we reconnected .  

I was in diff state for college living in pg  and had my relatives here. 

Everything was long distance and over phone. 
No proposal nothing idk just confessed how we missed each other  and how he ran away from his guardian . 

 Although in these years I had coffee dates , slept with a guy etc . I let him know everything about my past bcs i wanted him to know everythinb and make a choice .although he hide things from me and told me months later and we had huge fight over that as he messed up ..

I was honest with him but brutual . 
I didn't apologize for sleeping with someone else back then . Also over time I made him jealous by sending pics of my guy friend and me with his elbow over my shoulder or sending him ss of guys complimenting me when I post my picture ( normal ) .
I did compared him to the guy I slept with ( I don't remember but all I wanted was him to put in more efforts . ) . 

Soon I realised my mistake but it was too late . The damage was done . His overthinking and childhood trauma kicked it . 
He said I cheated , that i slept wth some guy while I also told him how much I missed him in this time and waited and all . 

All this relationship ( after we reconnected ) was long distance. 

He would come to meet me once in a while as we live two states apart . 
He would pay everything when he will come , I'll try to save as much knowing he is doing odd jobs and is struggling . 

I asked him to see a therapist and give a lot of reassurance over time ..

Also we had a lot of fights and fights and arguments . 

I always bring breakup twice a week in starting because of our family issues  but his dropping mental health and panic attacks make me stop ..

I did every single thing I could have done but it was never enough and when I say everything I meant it EVERY SINGLE THING . ( I don't mean sexually ) 
He said he tried too but he can't leave me accept or forget pr punish me for cheating . 

 Also I felt being interrogated over details of what that guy and I did etc every day for weeks or maybe months .

Then everything shifted 
DEC 2024 , 
He came to meet me during my exams, I clearly told no before he didn't listened . 
I missed one of my final exam a day ago due to my bad mental health and bcs I was careless and slept . 
He came on 18th . He would act crazy. I already wanted to break up . One moment it was good other moment it was worse . 

The same guy who cleaned my period blood off floor , walked bare foot with wounded feet in rain as my shoes broke . That guy who believed i made him a monster , who believed i made his mental health sick . 

He wanted to have unprotected sex while I wanted to wait until marriage but agreed reluctantly. I dont remember what it feel like 
 
But the next day when he asked again i pushed for condom ( the guy I slept with used condom so he don't wanted to ) 
I was scared , didn't want to create a scene and I don't know what to do , he guilt trip me and how I don't believe him . 

I was lying on the mattress , my face near the wall , he was doing it , I was feeling nothing , I asked him to stop 3 times bcs apparently my hand and knees were getting twisted and it was hurting . He didn't . 
On the fourth time he did . I don't remember much but i was crying while he was holding my wrists tightly shouting that he will get more mad if I cry .(  His eyes that day haunted me for a long time and I couldn't sleep or would flinch at every loud noise . ) 

Then he said he is so bad for making me tear up while I comforted him .
I had final exam next morning. I asked him to go back but suddenly he got sick and I had no option .we spent night at railway station cause he was out of money after he stayed for  10 days here . ( I had hostel with no boys allowed ) 
I made him to take medicines and he slept bcs of that . I cried the whole night and made internship report while sitting on a bench in cold night with blanket , hungry and few people sleeping at station . 
 It was worst ever . 

Next day he made everything ok I don't know how but he did then he left for home so did I . 
I was ok again but the nightmares were there . Also I asked him to break up , not bcs I hate him but bcs I could see our family won't agree
 ( I went home after 2-3 yrs so I thought before that they would have changed by now ) 

There is this thing , this guy claims to have another personality or something that make him forget everything he says or do in extreme anger . 

So with words that felt like knives he would lash out every day from past few months . 
Before that I felt I was toxic to him while he was the quiet green flag I have ever known . 

At home I get no privacy or time but he would constantly ask to talk and say he's going crazy and demanding  why I was bringing breakup up all jan.. he claimed I am cheating and that i have someone else in my mind . 
He said things that made my heart drop over chat and how he was sorry for that night but he couldn't stop bcs of the guy I slept with in 2022  before 
( I asked that guy from 2022 to stop while we were in bed and that I'm not sure for sex so he stopped but we did other things )  .

Ex Texted my best friend shitty things .
( Yet she stood for me like family but I had to leave her 😭alone later  ) 

Although me and my ex daily argue or he lash out but Once he said in extreme anger how he would kill my ex and the guy friend I made him jealous with etc . 
And when I got scared and told him it was wrong . He snapped how I'm choosing that guy over him , that how he wasn't really gonna do it but the threats felt so real his anger reminded me of his guardian .  ( It was in October 2024) 

My mental health was bad , I lost 10-12  kg of weight in past few months etc. 

He said he was sorry , don't want to do anything sexual but wanted to spent a night with me to  treat me like a princess . 

He pushed me to say yes to stay with him at night when he come to meet me but I rudely refuse so he started saying how i trust that guy slept with him but not my ex . 
..
I pretented to be loving him etc in last week of Dec bcs I was at home . Then I went no contact while he was worried and sent like 500 messages a day and calls to me , my friends etc  . I was so terrified . Had fever can't sleep or eat and flinch at every noise .

  After 3 days he showed up in my town and family got involved,

 I tried suicide but stopped , next thing i knew I was in police station and had to file FIR against him ..

Now it's a legal case , How he was threating to kill me over call if I breakup ( I didn't include sexual abuse ) . 
( He indeed told me  how his anger will.kill the guy I slept with , my guy friends . . And he said shitty things about my bestie ) .


His eyes felt as if I betrayed him . 

The case is still there , I don't even wanna continue and let it go . 

My life fell apart after all of this , my delayed graduation, loosing only 2 friends i have ( due to other reasons , if they weren't I would have killed myself ) . 

My family is supportive but back there in my hostel i didn't had family I had relatives in the town who handled the matter in worse way and got police involved.

But here I am back to my hometown ,  recently got a new job , life feels fast and I feel immature but better . 


The whole relationship was abuse 
I was toxic 
My mental health was bad and his was worse. 

I want no legal case or him to serve jail time .
He already spend one night in jail ( him getting bailed took time )  and said how he came this time just for last time and all .  His eyes scream how I am the one who betrayed him .
While his friend think I took money from him , I didn't . 

His family is very toxic to him so I felt so bad for him always and how his guardian throw away his childhood and make him drop out of school. 
Well he made me drop out of school too for more than a year . 

So AITA for wanting my ex to suffer ? 
Am I wrong for hating him ? 
I felt disgusted that he ever touched me while he said how i was almost a * and he is disgusted of me .


Old me hated all this and felt guilty but I feel how disgusting it was all and that how I wasn't the one responsible for all . 

But i did hurt people and how I don't make friends anymore , i stopped sh but sometimes I do it again. 

TLDR : my ex and I fell in love without any commitment at 16 . His guardian r* my family member.. we got no contact . My ex and I reconnected after 4.5 yrs over call and get in relationship.  He was a victim too . 

I told him how I missed him and cried but also how I slept with other guy and go on dates etc , fueled his jealousy and compared him . I stopped but it got worse he said I cheated and etc . 
He got angry lash out over phone and later say I don't remember for months.  
 ( Some personality thing) 
He would interrogate me over phone about details with the guy I slept with for hours  etc . And then he came to my city in dec 2024  ( we live in different states) 
And one night he sexually assaulted or r* me . 

Then when I wanted to break up next month he don't want too . 

Threats etc family got involved , legal case happen to be of how he gave death threats if I break up  over call . ( No sexual abuse) 
I never wanted to file a case so I won't be fighting it either . ( He won't serve any jail time either ) ..
I was toxic 
He was emotionally abusive .
He was obsessed with a idea of me that never existed and got mad when he met reality",0,1749909126.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False
1lb97dw,https://i.redd.it/ms3368lucw6f1.png,"5-Day Streak, 13 Hours of Focus, and Zero Escape from Grammar: My English Journey Has Begun","Hey everyone,  
So… I finally *started* learning English this year. Not “started” as in *said I would*—I actually did the work.  
Here’s my proof: a glorious screenshot of my log. (I wanted to upload a video, but Reddit said ""no fun allowed."")

# Progress Summary:

* **Total time:** 13 hours and 6 minutes
* **Daily average:** \~2.5 hours
* **Streak:** 5 days – yes, I showed up *every single day*
* **Active skills:** Grammar, Vocabulary, Reading, Writing
* **Stalled skills:** Listening (barely 2 minutes), Speaking (still ghosting me)

  
**What I Worked On (and how I emotionally survived it):**  


* **Grammar** – Started with the mighty “am-is-are” trio. Building sentences feels like playing Jenga, but at least I stopped saying “I is tired.” Progress. 
* **Vocabulary** – Learning around 15 words per day. “Window” is my friend now. “Through” still looks down on me. 
* **Reading** – I’m not afraid of short sentences anymore. I can read basic texts without panicking. 
* **Writing** – I’m sticking to simple sentences. Still tense-confused, but at least I’m not typing “Dear Sir or Madım” anymore. 
* **Listening & Speaking** – Listening was attempted for 2 minutes. Speaking didn’t even show up. We’re not emotionally ready to face each other yet.

  
**Goals for Next Week (no ears or mouth involved):**

* **Reading** – Reach page 20 in my first English book
* **Vocabulary** – Raise my daily word goal from 15 to 20
* **Grammar** – Lock in the first 6 tenses
* **Writing** – One short email + two mini journal entries

  
**Final Note:**

Learning a language isn’t always aesthetic. Most of the time I’m just sitting here asking myself “why am I doing this.”  
But I pushed through, just to be able to post this screenshot. That’s a win in my book.  
Tips, resources, or even memes to laugh at the pain—drop them in the comments.

Gengar is watching. And that’s enough motivation for now.

She and her husband live in a quiet farmhouse outside of town—a fixer-upper with creaky floorboards, peeling paint, and one of those attics you swear just *feels* colder than the rest of the house.

I stayed with them for a week to help out, mostly babysitting so she could get some sleep. One night, around 2 a.m., I was downstairs watching TV with the baby monitor on the coffee table next to me. Eli had been fussing on and off, but nothing unusual. Then I heard a second voice.

At first I thought it was a glitch—baby monitors pick up all kinds of interference, right? But this wasn’t static or radio chatter. This was someone whispering *to* him.

At that point, I muted the TV. The whispering continued. Low, rhythmic, like someone gently humming a lullaby in a language I didn’t understand.

I ran upstairs. The room was cold—*really* cold. Eli was sleeping peacefully, but the rocking chair next to the crib was moving slowly. There was no draft. No window open. I checked.

I picked Eli up and took him downstairs. For the rest of the night, I kept him next to me on the couch and didn’t take my eyes off the baby monitor.

The next day I told my sister. She got really quiet, then said, *“We don’t talk about that.”*

I asked her what she meant.

Apparently, the previous owner’s baby died in that room. Crib death. Tragic. But after that, the monitor would *always* pick up noises. Whispers. Laughing. And once, crying that didn’t match her baby’s voice.

They’d thought it was just grief and stress. But now it was starting again.

Last week she called me in tears. They’d moved Eli to their room, but she caught him staring into the hallway, smiling and giggling—at *nothing*. Then he said his first word:  
**“Lady.”**

They don’t know anyone named Lady.

But last night, she checked the monitor again.

There was someone in the room. Sitting in the rocking chair.

And Eli was humming.",1,1749908951.0,Ghoststories,1,0.67,False

1lb90ji,https://www.reddit.com/r/summariseme/comments/1lb90ji/20250614_health_headlines_new_breakthroughs_and/,(2025-06-14) Health Headlines New Breakthroughs and Risks Emerge,"## Health News Roundup: June 14, 2025

The health landscape of June 14, 2025, presented a mix of medical advancements, celebrity health updates, and discussions on wellness and beauty trends. From successful surgeries to societal pressures, here's a comprehensive overview of the day's key developments.

**Celebrity Health Updates:**

The day's most prominent health story revolved around television actor Dipika Kakar, who was discharged from Mumbai's Kokilaben Hospital after an 11-day stay following a 14-hour surgery for stage 2 liver cancer. Kakar shared the news with her fans, announcing that she is ""free from the tumour."" However, she clarified that this was only one part of her treatment and that further procedures would follow. The actress expressed optimism, stating, ""I believe I will sail through it too."" Her husband, Shoaib Ibrahim, also provided updates on her health, expressing the relief felt by the family. This positive development, however, serves as a reminder of the ongoing journey for cancer patients.

The news also touched on another television personality, Sana Makbul, who revealed her diagnosis of liver cirrhosis following a battle with autoimmune hepatitis. This condition, characterized by liver scarring and inflammation, often necessitates long-term management involving regular testing and lifestyle adjustments to prevent further liver degeneration. Dr. Sukrit Singh Sethi, Director of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Liver Transplantation at Narayana Hospital, Gurugram, noted that a transplant might be required in the worst-case scenario. This news emphasizes the importance of early detection and consistent medical attention for those with autoimmune conditions.

**Body Image and Societal Pressures:**

The news also highlighted the increasing scrutiny faced by women, especially after childbirth. Actor Bipasha Basu voiced her strong reaction to online body-shaming, targeting comments on her postpartum weight gain. This reaction came in response to a social media reel which compared her pre- and post-pregnancy photos. Basu's response underscores the societal pressure on women to conform to unrealistic beauty standards and the emotional toll this can take.

**Wellness and Lifestyle Advice:**

Beyond medical diagnoses, several articles offered advice on health and well-being. One article suggested strategies to regulate the body temperature and start the day right in hot weather. According to Edwina Raj, a clinical nutritionist and dietician at Aster CMI Hospital, opting for lighter, soothing breakfast options is advised to avoid bloating, sluggishness, and indigestion. Coconut water smoothies were also recommended as a refreshing choice.

Another article explored the potential health benefits of drinking black coffee. Dr. Pranav Honnavara Srinivasan, a senior consultant gastroenterologist at Fortis Bengaluru, stated that black coffee can offer benefits through its antioxidants, caffeine, and B vitamins. The caffeine in coffee is known to boost mental alertness and enhance physical performance.

**Summer Skincare Secrets and the Rise of Natural Remedies:**

In the beauty and wellness sphere, actress Nimrat Kaur shared her summer skincare secret, promoting the use of fresh coconut water on the skin to combat the heat. Dr. Khushboo Jha, MD, Chief Dermatologist and Founder of One Skin Clinic, Faridabad, highlighted the benefits of coconut water, including its richness in electrolytes like potassium and magnesium, its ability to replenish moisture, and its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. These properties can help reduce acne-causing bacteria, soothe breakouts, even out skin tone, and reduce pigmentation.

**Ethical and Legal Issues in Healthcare:**

A concerning development involved the ongoing case of a Faridabad cardiologist imposter. The Haryana Police are investigating the alleged impersonation of a cardiologist who conducted approximately 50 heart surgeries over eight months at a private hospital. The police are yet to receive medical records from the civil hospital where the accused was working, and the main imposter remains unreachable.

**The Role of AI in Mental Health:**

The question of AI's role in mental health was also explored. The rise of AI-powered chatbots, initially inspired by early examples like Eliza, has prompted debate on their potential to replace therapists. While such technology could offer accessible support, challenges remain in ensuring effective, personalized, and ethical care.

**In Conclusion:**

The health news on June 14, 2025, covered a broad spectrum of topics, from serious medical diagnoses and treatments to everyday wellness tips and reflections on societal pressures. Dipika Kakar's successful surgery and subsequent recovery brought a sense of optimism. However, the announcements of Sana Makbul's cirrhosis diagnosis and the ongoing Faridabad imposter case underscore the importance of continued vigilance in health management. As a society, we need to continuously adapt to new challenges and continue to foster a supportive environment where healthcare is effective, ethical, and accessible to all.

1lb8zme,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreativeMysteries/comments/1lb8zme/how_the_monster_was_discovered/,How the monster was discovered,"**Chapter 1: Dust on the Map**

The Global Pulse office in Addis Ababa smelled of old newspapers and coffee that was brewed so hard you could clean your boots with it. I was sitting with my face buried in the monitor, trying to turn another report on the delivery of humanitarian aid into some kind of readable text, when the door flew open with a bang.   

– ""Carter!"", – My boss, Marven, always sounded like an overloaded truck. – ""Aren't you bored to death yet?""

He tossed the printout on the table. The satellite screen shows a dried-up riverbed in Afar Province, with white markings next to it that look like the ribs of a giant fish. But it wasn't a fish.

– ""The archaeologists found some animal bones. The locals have already dubbed him 'the devil's dog'. We need the paper by Friday.""

I turned the printout over in my hands. 20 thousand years. Even for Africa – it's not ancient. A time when humans have long ceased to be prey.   

– ""Marven, I'm not a paleontologist. Better send a student from the university.""

– ""The students here will run away from the scorpions"", – he snorted, pulling a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket. – ""And you… You like to dig deeper than you have to.""

He was damn right.   

The road to Afar is not a journey, it is a test of strength. A 9-year-old Toyota Jeep, two hundred cans of water, an expired first-aid kit, and a guide named Kassim who mumbled to himself all the way. I was waiting for dust, stuffiness and a couple of general comments from scientists. 

The archaeology camp greeted me with an unnatural bustle. White tents, like mushrooms after a rainstorm, with crates of bones wrapped in plastic between them. The leader of the expedition, Dr. Amara Sebhat, handed me a glove:

– ""Put it on. You won't be able to wash your hands in the nearest neighborhood.""  

She led me to the edge of the excavation, where it lay under a tarp. Even in the dim light, the skeleton was a monstrous mockery of evolution.   

The skull was massive, like a titan's helmet, with two curved fangs protruding from the upper jaw. Longer than a saber, sharper than a blade. But the strangest part was the horns. Not branched like a buffalo's, but smooth and crescent-shaped, like two black crescents embedded in the parietal bones. This was only seen in medieval engravings with images of demons. 

– ""Hypertrophied osteoderms"", – Amara muttered, noticing my gaze. – ""Bone outgrowths. Like some dinosaurs.""

But it didn't look like a dinosaur. The creature's front legs, assembled from fragments, resembled the limbs of a grizzly bear, enlarged by one and a half times. Its shoulder blades are thrust forward unnaturally, as if the creature is used to walking on its knuckles like a gorilla. And claws… God, those sickle-shaped claws, even petrified, looked like they could rip open a bronze shield.

– ""Did you reconstruct the appearance?"" – I asked, feeling a chill run down my spine.

Amara deliberately averted her eyes as she adjusted the container of small fragments.

– ""We are not artists"".

But when she left, I saw a sketch in her folder. A creature that resembles a hybrid of a saber-toothed cat and a gargoyle: squat, with a hump on its back, horns twisted, and front paws that can break a tree. Next to it is the silhouette of a person for scale. The man barely reached the monster's shoulder. 

I decided not to push Amara – experience had taught me that scientists only reveal secrets to those who know how to wait. So I preferred to talk to the other campers.

I met the first one at the sample booth – a skinny guy with cracked glasses and a T-shirt with ""Jurassic Party"" print. He was busy sorting the bones, humming to himself.

– ""Are you a journalist? I'm Jonas, a PhD student from Berlin!"" – he held out his hand, forgetting that it held a fragment of vertebra the size of a baseball bat. – ""This is the sensation of the century! Imagine: Smilodon afarensis! A saber-toothed endemic species that survived to the Holocene!""

– ""But Dr. Sebhat was talking about horns and forelegs… It's not like saber-toothed cats.""

Jonas froze, I was not the first person who didn't like his idea of a saber-toothed cat with horns.   

""Well... convergent evolution, perhaps?"" – he scratched his stubble nervously. ""Or ..."" – he looked around and lowered his voice, – ""They're... really unnatural. As if the creature could even walk on two legs. Sometimes.""

He turned away quickly, as if he'd said too much.   

Following them, I met a middle-aged man, Dr. Jabari Said, a paleozoologist from Cairo. His comment was accurate and professional:

– ""It's not a beast. At least, not someone who can be included in the known taxa."" – He tapped a 3D model of the skull on his laptop screen. – ""Do you see those crests on your forehead? It had stronger muscles than a gorilla's. And the teeth"" – He zoomed in. – ""Powerful enough to crush bones. Or carapaces.""

– ""Maybe an omnivore?""   

He clicked the mouse, revealing a snapshot of the claw. ""See the notches? These can only serve one purpose – to tear apart someone else's flesh.""

The last meeting of the day was waiting for me at the edge of the camp – the local assistant, Hassan, a guy in his twenties. His English was broken, but the words stuck in his mind.

– ""Scary. A terrible beast. Big fang. Demon.""

It was obvious that the guy came here to foreigners for easy money and did not expect to see a prehistoric monster here.

**Chapter 2: Shadows under the Sand**

The camp fell silent as the white-hot sun gave way to night. I sat by the campfire, sipping coffee that tasted like tar, and replayed snatches of conversation in my head. Dr. Said mentioned claws. Jonas mentioned bipedalism. And Amara didn't really say anything...

The fire crackled, casting dancing shadows across the tents. Suddenly, Amara emerged from the darkness. She was carrying a bundle wrapped in a coarse cloth.

– ""You wanted to know more, Mr. Carter?"" – her voice sounded like a door creaking in an abandoned house. – ""Then go ahead.""

She led me to the far side of the excavation, where there was a small tent. Inside it smelled of incense and the dust of centuries. On the table, under a layer of tracing paper, there were photographs – not of bones, but of cave paintings taken in bright artificial light.

The first image made me freeze. People – dozens of figures scratched in ochre and charcoal – were running in panic. Their bodies were twisted, their arms outstretched, their mouths open in silent screams. Looming over them were the silhouettes of creatures with crescent-shaped horns like the ones I'd seen on the demon's skull. But here they seemed even larger, almost touching the roof of the cave. The artist captured the movement: the monsters walked on their forelimbs, their claws digging into the ground, leaving furrows.

– ""This isn't just a hunt"", – I muttered, peering into the details.

Amara ran her finger over the photo. ""Look at this.""

In the next image, a group of warriors armed with stone-tipped spears surrounded the horned creature. One of the men was thrusting a weapon into its throat, but the creature didn't even seem to feel the pain. Its mouth was open in a snarl, and blood was streaming from its eye sockets. Masked figures resembling animal skulls were standing next to the battle. 

Amara unfolded another sheet. It showed something that sent a chill down my spine. The creature lay on the ground, impaled by a dozen spears. Black streams poured out of his mouth, ears, and shattered skull.

– ""That's not all"", – Amara said, noticing my gaze. – ""There's another gallery of drawings in the cave"". 

She pulled out a photograph taken in a narrow tunnel. The wall was covered with symbols: spirals intertwined with zigzags, as if trying to capture sound or movement. And in the center – a figure raising to the ceiling an object resembling a cross. Waves radiating from it, and the bodies of monsters laying around with empty eye sockets.

– ""These petroglyphs were found in the caves of the Semien Mountains. They're about ten thousand years old"", – Amara whispered. – ""That's twice as close to our time as the skeleton we found.""

I was very confused by what I saw.

– ""And what... what do you think of the whole damn thing?""

Amara paused, her fingers gripping the edge of the table as if she were trying to hold back the words that were coming out. Finally, she slowly raised her head, and there was a fire in her eyes that I hadn't noticed before – a mixture of fear and obsession.

– ""Mr. Carter, do you know what the gray zones of archaeology are?"" – she sounded as if she wasn't talking to me, but to someone invisible behind me. – ""It's when scientists find something that shouldn't exist and bury it back. Because the world is not ready.""

She suddenly grabbed my hand, her fingers as cold as ice.

– ""You're asking me what I think? I don't think we found the beast. We found the shadow of a civilization that ran parallel to our own. They were stronger, faster, smarter. But their evolution..."" – She choked on the word as if it were stuck in her throat. – ""Their evolution took a wrong turn. They became what we call demons. And the people... We only survived because we learned to be afraid of them.""

She let go of me and stepped back into the shadows, as if frightened by her own words.

– ""But that's just a theory,"" she added in a lower voice, putting the photos back in the bundle. ""A theory that makes me sound crazy.""

– ""And the bones?"" – I asked, my heart pounding in my chest. ""If they're extinct...""

– ""The bones are silent"", – she interrupted. – ""But the sand of Afar holds more secrets. And if we keep digging..."" – She turned, and something ancient, almost bestial, flickered in her eyes. – ""I wish we hadn't found anything.""

– ""I'm sorry, I'll have to write about all this"" – I said after a short silence. – ""That's what you wanted, isn't it?""

Behind her, the wind crept in through the cracks of the tent, blowing out the candle. We were left in the dark, and only Amara's whisper hung in the air.

– ""I think that… not everything is dead, Mr. Carter. Sometimes the past wakes up.""

**Chapter 3: The Reaction**

The article was published under the heading: ""Demons of the Great Rift: When Science Meets Nightmare"". Marvin, my boss, first tore out his thin hair, shouting that Global Pulse was not a tabloid newspaper for conspiracy buffs. But when the story received three times as many views as reports about the drought and political scandals, he suddenly remembered that ""journalism must be bold.""

The trolls came first. Comments like: ""Carter, did you smoke that monster's bones?"" or ""Where's the alien photo?"". I wouldn't have noticed it if it weren't for the letters from scientists.

Dr. Jabari Said of Cairo sent an official rebuttal: ""Journalist Carter misrepresented my words. There is no evidence of the creature's intelligence. It's just an abnormal predator, nothing more."" Jonas, a Berlin graduate student, wrote in PM: ""You've ruined everything! Now I won't be allowed to defend my thesis!""

Then there was a letter from Professor Greg Walters of the University of Idaho, a gray-bearded mastodon of anthropology whose career was based on denying everything that didn't fit in his textbooks. He launched into a five-page essay in which he argued that the ""demon"" was just an overgrown gelada suffering from a hormonal malfunction. ""Your sensationalism is a disgrace to science! Stop it!"" – he thundered. – ""Geladas have fangs, they walk on their knuckles! This is an obvious hypertrophy, not a new species!"" I stifled a laugh as I imagined the 20-ton monster with horns chewing on the grass on the mountainside, adjusting its mane.

But there were also voices of support. Yale University anthropologist Dr. Alice Gray has published a review analyzing the cave paintings: ""The similarity to the myths of the Afar peoples is striking. Perhaps we are dealing with a collective memory of a real threat."" 

The article made me so popular amongst UFO fans, that one night a man in a suit barged in on me.

– ""Mr. Carter, I represent the Historical Horizons Foundation. We're willing to sponsor your further investigation"", – he said, placing an envelope on the table with a check that would have made Marven cry. 

I returned the envelope – writing nonsense for the sake of money was beneath my journalistic dignity. 

– ""Thank you, but I want to get off the subject, I've had enough of it.""

The biggest disappointment in this story for me was that almost all the employees of the expedition turned away from the publication. Amara Sebhat didn't answer at all. Her number was not answering, and the University of Addis Ababa said she was ""on a vacation.""

No, not all of them. I received one letter from Hassan, the camp assistant. 

""Mr. Ted, war men here. Dig deep. They found cave, human bones in. Lots of bones. We will be departed from there. Don't come back.""

The next day I called Cassim, my old guide.

– ""Are you still alive?"", – he asked hoarsely.

– ""So far, yes. What do you hear in Afar?""

Silence. Then a whisper.

– ""There's an army there now. Around the fence with a thorn. No one is allowed in: neither locals nor tourists.""

I hung up and looked at the picture of the skeleton pinned to the wall. His empty eye sockets stared straight into my soul.

– ""You wanted to tell the truth, Carter,"" – I muttered. – ""Enjoy it.""

**Chapter 4: The Epilogue** 

A couple of weeks after the article was published, the first shock passed and I was able to calmly look at the situation. It turned out that the monster was made out of a fly by me, and all the experts refuted my words. After all, it could have been a mix of bones, incorrect guesses, or just fake artifacts for the sake of press attention.

I decided that I needed to relax and took a vacation. But I didn't dare go anywhere – both the natural scenery and the prehistoric fortresses of Ethiopia again led me to think about the monsters that trampled this land thousands of years ago. Moreover, the mystery of prehistoric monsters became even more preoccupying to me as I spent more time at home. 

At night, I started seeing them. Shadows outside the window that disappeared when I turned my head. The sound of claws on the roof. Once I woke up to the sound of someone breathing very close to my ear – heavy, hoarse. The doctor said that it was caused by stress. 

Maybe, of course, the stress made me more receptive. But fear... is the fear I feel something unnatural?

We, humans, have existed for thousands of years with a huge number of predators lurking at every turn: crocodiles, lions, bears, wolves, jackals. We have existed with them for tens of thousands of years, and all this time they have been a direct and real threat to us. 

But are we afraid of crocodiles? Lions? Bears? Wolves?

No. All the time of our existence, we were not afraid of the ""terrible predators"" that official science shows us.

We were afraid of them. Horned, toothy, huge. Creepy, ruthless, lurking in the dark. Monsters.

Of course, it's easy to say that they did not exist. But if so… what are you afraid of when you look into the darkness of a silent night?

Most of my colleagues are cool, except for one senior in my department - let's call him Raj (45M). He's always been a bit overly friendly, but I never thought much of it until recently.

A few weeks ago, my mom came to pick me up from work since my car was in the shop. Raj happened to be leaving at the same time and immediately turned on the charm when he saw her.

Him: ""This is your mother? She looks so young!"" (complete with that awkward, lingering handshake)

I brushed it off as just small talk...until he somehow got her number by saying he could ""help with my career growth."" (For the record, he hasn't helped at all.)
Now he's texting her ""good morning"" messages, sending random LinkedIn articles, and even asked her out for coffee to ""discuss industry trends."" My mom thinks it's all professional, but I'm not so sure.

The cringiest part? He keeps making comments at work like ""Your mom is so cultured, you're lucky"" and ""She's very elegant for her age."" Dude, please stop.

I'm torn between confronting him, ignoring it, or just finding a new job. I dont know if my mom interested too.It's just weird.

TL;DR: My senior colleague is clearly into my mom and now I have to deal with his awkward attempts at flirting with her while pretending to be professional at work.

Context: my mom and dad is going to create an Airbnb type of rental in our plot of land in a province neighbouring Pampanga. The unutilized solar panels in their home will be transferred to the rental property to create a self sustaining infrastructure.

Spare you the details, but their business idea is sure to fail, so I told them that how about we put up a cafe instead. I suggested this because it's the only skill my family is familiar with, but I don't personally believe in F&B businesses as I know it is difficult to become profitable nor do I have experience or knowledge about the industry.

My goal is to create a semi profitable business for my siblings then go back to corporate when they proven they can run it.

Here are the current facts:
- No F&B exp
- No cafe concept yet
- No marketing skills nor talent
- Parents are willing to throw serious money into the cafe
- Culinary and coffee enthusiast siblings
- Currently unemployed, but previous salary is in 40k to 50k range.
- 10 years in corporate
- No rent since we own the land and building
- No utilities because of solar panels
- No staff to pay since it will be ran by my family

My rational side is telling me to just go back to corporate and build on the side, create a business plan for my family and see it they can run it.",0,1749908162.0,phinvest,0,0.5,False

I can't find it by name or what little details I remember.  I don't remember this being past season 13, but that could be a mistake.  Here's what I remember about the episode:

Someone releases some kind of chemical warfare agent that wrecks havoc on society.  There's reports of its effects on a TV in the coffee shop where the story takes place.  I think the person sold the weapon to someone who turned out to be a zealot of some type.  The seller was a disgruntled employee?  

I'm sorry its so vague.  I think Graham Rowat was the main character.  The performance made me a big fan of his.
But, its been so long that I've heard it that all these details could be wrong, except reports of the carnage.  Also, it was the last story in whatever episode this was.

Thanks in advance.  If I can remember more, I'll update.

1lb8lnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1lb8lnd/working_while_being_depressed/,Working while being depressed,"I was kind of forced to start working at the age of 22 while I was completely not ready for any of it. My depression was extremely high at that moment and making money was the last thing I was worried about. But my mom told me that we are going to starve if I don't go, so I pushed myself to it. Later I found out that was a lie and she just hated me having my food for free and not paying for my stay at home.

I must admit that having a job in such condition is not doing you any favor. I had to push myself really hard as I didn't have any inner motivation for any of it. My mind refused to fake I'm into what I'm doing and I used to drown it with coffee and sweets just to prevent it from a total shutdown. I used to hit walls to the blood and I started squeezing my teeth unconsciously which led to heavy damages of it. I always used some kind of high value personal goal in order to convince myself to keep going. If anything went different from what I had planned, I would start losing it. I would loose my appetite first, just pushing the food on a schedule to prevent dystrophy. Later I would loose my sleep. I would need to talk to myself for hours every day just to convince myself to work and make it through.

Even having a good income doesn't make it feel good. I felt like I'm torturing myself for the money and couldn't build healthy relationships with me. It is like being a slave masters to yourself. I never felt stable even being a senior, never felt like spending money, starting a family or buying an apartment as I constantly felt that I can quit my job at any second and won't be able to pay the mortgage. I couldn't work for more than a year in a row and the moments I resigned were soooo relieving. 

I must also mention that there's zero help for a person in such situation. My best time in life was between the jobs when I used the money I saved for traveling, studying and spiritual practice. It really pushed me forward towards resolving my depression issue. But whoever was in my life just used to say that it's weird, pointless, I should just work and get married. To get a job I would make stories of normal people for my interviews. Lots of times I felt like the world is trying to kill me when getting another weird look of an HR or a refusal letter. I felt that they are pushing me to the lowest job possible, so I have no dignity, time or money to drag myself out of my misery.

I know I wouldn't be able to make it without the money, so I'm not sorry for the hell I went through. But still it makes me wonder why there's zero support or assistance to depressed people.

I’m filled with SO many ideas and I would like some opinions on it! (Please be nice, I am sensitive!) The Beatles is my all time favorite band, I’ve loved them since I was little! I think it would be really cool to make candles inspired off the Beatles, but I definitely got carried away with my ideas! The plan is to make/release them in sets since there’s so many different ideas! Anyways I am curious if you think that these kind of scent ideas would match what I’m going for? Like would they match the vibe? Here are my scent ideas and such

Albums


Please please me 
Fresh, citrusy? slight musk, leathery

White
Floral but sharp

Let it be
Musky, woody, probably something similar to dragons blood

Abbey road
Cologne like, fresh and woody

Help! 
Marshmallow (for some reason?) jeans scent, ??



Band member


George
Milk biscuits, NON NEGOTIABLE! Musky/darkish insense like scents like dragons blood 

Ringo
Oceany and candy/sweet because yellow submarine and octopus’ garden and he’s goofy

Paul
Cologne like, slightly floral, maybe coffee?

John
Citrusy, maybe coffee? Old spice, tobacco, leather?



Songs

Strawberry fields
Strawberry, floral 

A day in the life
Rain, coffee, old books?

Here comes the sun
Orange, nature like, lemongrass

Hey Jude
Musky cologne, something that would seem slightly sad but also good at the same time lol, like a “beautiful sadness”

Norwegian wood
Wood lol, musky, fresh



Secret free extra if one of the full sets is bought 

That’s literally 15 candles LMAO


Anyways, sorry that this is so long!! If you have any other scent suggestions or feel like these ideas may be off or something would be better for it I would love some feedback! I’m also curious about which set you believe might sell well / should be the first one to come out? I’m just curious if anyone would be interested in buying a candle inspired off the Beatles aswell, I’m not going to self advertise but I wanna see if it’s an idea worth while ",1,1749907303.0,beatles,0,1.0,False

1lb8hrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/1lb8hrw/a_2025_bonnaroo_post_mordem_thoughts_and/,A 2025 Bonnaroo Post Mordem - Thoughts and Discussion,"Hi all,

For everyone still stuck on the farm, stay safe and best of luck today. I was able to get out last night for a few lucky reasons (traveled solo, traveled light with just a camp chair and tent, sober since 2019 so I could drive immediately) but the entire night I spent tossing and turning, reading threads on here and thinking about things I’ve read, seen, and heard. I wanted to jot some of them and open up a discussion with y’all and get everyone’s thoughts. 

I have a few unique perspectives that I thought might give some insight, so here goes. I was a geography major 15 years ago and have kept at it as a hobby, I basically spent most days reading about storms and natural disasters for fun. I am very clued in to the weather and most importantly, I live here in Nashville so I’ve been around in the weeks leading up to Roo.

I also worked in outdoor education and have taken survival classes and am an experienced camper. I used to live in Colorado and have extensive experience camping in all sorts of conditions. At one point, I was also a Wilderness First Responder (WFR) although it’s kind of a bogus designation in all honesty lol. 

Additionally, I worked in the insurance industry. I left my career last year to go back to school for social work, I want to work with people struggling with substance abuse like I do myself. I got zero enjoyment working in finance, but I at least have some technical knowledge leftover.

Lastly, I go to a shitload of festivals, prior Roos included. Camping and city, all over the US. 

So all of that being said, here are some things that stood out to me.

- Almost no one understands how insurance works in the US and it’s a massive failure on behalf of society considering it’s necessary in some areas. Live Nation, Bonnaroo, all attendees, all vendors, everyone lost money. No one is a winner here.
- Yes there is insurance for event coverage and yes you can base the “business interruption” portion on anticipated revenues but here’s the catch, you can’t just claim anything you want. You need projections and all that good stuff and of course at the end, you are CHARGED FOR IT. You can’t just say “Yeah we’d have made a billion, give it to us”, actuaries have to price it out and rate for it and so if you OVER claim how much you might make, you end up OVER paying for insurance. Also if you make shit up it gets into fraud territory but that’s an entirely separate conversation.
- Speaking of, in order to get an insurance payout just like you would in a car accident, you have to pay for the insurance in the first place. That money, the premium that Live Nation paid to it’s insurers and reinsurers (I can expand on this if anyone wants, reinsurance was actually my niche and I did lots of huge projects) is gone no matter what. Even if the event had gone as scheduled and was a killing, all of the premium that Live Nation paid for the insurance in the first place is gone. That is millions upon millions of dollars in premium alone.
- Fuck Live Nation and everything but they were in such a shit position. I will touch on the weather in the lead up to this in a second, but their choices were either cancel ahead of time or try and host and hope the weather forecast doesn’t suck. As of Thursday morning, the rain on Friday wasn’t anticipated to be as heavy as it ended up.
- No matter what, it’s a different world post Astroworld litigiously. Music festivals have to be extra careful, and that’s exactly what they did. Blame our overly litigious environment for that, but at the same it’s done wonders for safety so kind of a double edged sword.

That was some insurance stuff, and yeah it sucks because at the end of the day we all still want to go Roo right? That’s three cancellations in the last six years for everyone keeping track. Festivals are insanely hard to pull off and expensive and margins are tight as is, do we really think this is sustainable? My answer right now, without changing the time of year or anything to the site or whatever, is NO.

Ok so back to the weather.

- Denver Colorado gets 15 inches of rain a year, Nashville got 14 inches of rain in APRIL.
- May this year was the 10th rainiest month on record in Nashville history, and is the second rainiest month in the last 20 years second only to May 2010, and may I remind you what happened to Nashville that year? CATASTROPHE for Nashville. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Tennessee_floods
- We’re in an ENSO neutral period as of late March which means it’s been cold and rainy for weeks and weeks, we went almost 280 days without hitting 90 until a few weeks back.
- Typically we have 25 inches of rain this time of year, right now we have 35 inches
- Think of an iceberg. The downpour we saw that “cancelled” the festival is like the part of the iceberg above the ocean. All of the water from the past few weeks that has nowhere to go? That’s the bottom of the iceberg under the water and the real danger. The ground is so saturated, there is quite literally nowhere else for it go.

As for the site. Can someone chime in on this? I seem to recall they did drainage studies and all sorts of stuff but because of protected wetlands it’s extremely hard for them to make any changes and extremely expensive. I think they already had issues with local wells which is a problem.

Now, living in Nashville we are constantly at war with the state, or I guess I should reverse that. In the past few years, the state has tried to take control of the airport, our convention center, they want to shrink our city council, they gerrymandered our representation into three red districts despite Nashville being solidly blue, etc.

Now, think about rural Coffee County, that shit is already way more conservative than Nashville. One death at this festival and three cancellations in the last six years, do you really think Tennessee won’t do something to shut this down?

Please drive safe y’all, in addition to staying put last night for mud and emergencies I hope everyone sobered up too. Lots of swerving on I-24 from cars on the way home I saw.

Best of luck today, please feel free to add thoughts and additions and corrections. I am not a know-it-all when it comes to insurance but again, I did work as a senior executive in my last role in reinsurance which is a weird niche.

All in all, kind of a surreal experience but I’m hoping we can get back to it better than ever next year.

EDIT: Yo I totally forgot to mention, what the fuck is with the logistics? Aka the lack of any? One announcement or two and then nothing? I got the fuck out on my own from having read way too much about disaster recovery in my free time but I saw zero staff and I just saw this post saying people still haven’t heard anything? That is abysmal

1lb8g97,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lb8g97/i_31m_am_dating_a_guy_29m_and_im_not_sure_if_i/,I 31M am dating a guy 29M and I'm not sure if I want to break it off or not and could do with some advice?,"TL:DR - guy I'm dating doesn't like talking about sex unless we're doing it and booted me unceremoniously this morning and I am not sure whether to break it off because of the way it was done. 

I have been on 4 dates now with this guy, and as far as I am concerned, he's a green flag. He's kind, smart, funny, we have loads of similar interests, very attractive, good natured and genuine. However, I'm not sure whether I want to continue on due to a few things I've noticed. 

So when it comes to sex, he is very tentative and needs a go-ahead from me, which I like because it's very respectful, and he has said he's been meeting me on the presumption that I don't want to have sex with him, which is fine, but I've corrected him and said to operate on the presumption that I do want to have sex with him and told him to not be afraid to initiate.

But he doesn't like even talking about sex. Or if I want to have a little bit of banter around it, I kind of just get a disapproving look and it's shut down immediately, and that's pretty much it and it kind of makes me feel a bit dirty for having those thoughts ab? For example, last night, we bought some ice lollies (the Roundtree ones) and I made a joke and said 'haha I'm going to sit and watch you when you eat it' which he really disapproved of and did not like. I thought it was a bit of banter, but he did not appreciate it at all and I felt bad so I'm not going to do it anymore, as I think it's a boundary of his which I don't want to cross. 

Flipside is - I am a sexual person and I like a dirty chat every so often and me and my friends have very graphic conversations about sex. But he doesn't engage. Although last night I was wearing something a bit more racy underneath my shorts and when I undressed he did enjoy it but we didn't do anything as he had a bit of a headache - that's fine, I don't expect it every time. However, I did mention earlier that I have started some new meds and my sex drive has increased ten-fold and again, I kind of just got a bit of a disapproving look for mentioning it? I don't want to put pressure on him and I was really stating it more of a fact - he's a doctor (specialising in medicine!) which is why I said it 

I hadn't seen him for a couple of weeks for a couple of reasons but I've noticed that it's been me asking for when he's free to hang out - he'll check and give me times and dates which is great, but for the last couple of them it's been me. This morning when I left I kind of just said 'ok well I'll see you soon' and gave him a hug and he gave me a little kiss on the head and I went. Despite not having seen each other, we speak pretty much every day on WhatsApp, and I like to make a point of telling him that I hope he has a great day. 

This morning, he had to go to a spin class at 9am which meant he/we had to be awake at 8am which is fine, but I felt pretty unceremoniously booted - he said to go without saying to go. Again, that's fine, it's his place but when I left the bedroom I saw he was making himself breakfast and a coffee and I kind of thought that he could have at least offered me a coffee or something before I left? I know he didn't have to leave for a little while yet. My M/O is if I have to go and someone is asleep, I am very much a 'stay, sleep and help yourself to whatever before you go, my home is your home' type of thing. 

I barely said anything to him this morning, mainly because I was still half asleep, and pissed off that I hadn't been given any time to boot up and it was basically a get dressed and get out situation which made me feel a type of way. 

This is where I started to think whether it's something I want to continue pursuing. I really like him, but I don't know if it's too early on for me to say anything about it as I don't want to start a fight or anything or have him dump me basically. 

So here I am, because I don't really know what to do. If I don't say anything to him, he's not a mind reader and I am not giving him a chance to rectify. I'm by no means perfect. But at the same time, I am kind of wondering if he showed himself up this morning and I didn't like that at all. But I don't want to force my company on him if he doesn't want it. 

Am I being a dick here? Am I holding him to my standards in a way that's not fair on him? Bear in mind, this is the first time in about five years I've started dating someone properly. 

Advice appreciated!

I recently built [Colorr.ai](https://colorr.ai) – a contextual color palette generator designed to help web developers and designers get the right colors based on what they’re actually building.

Instead of just picking random “aesthetic” palettes, Colorr tries to generate or surface palettes that fit specific industries, use cases, or vibes, like fintech, organic food brands, kids’ toys, dark mode dashboards, etc. You can search for almost anything, and if there aren’t enough palettes for it, it will auto-generate a fresh one on the fly.

A few things I tried to get right:
	•	Context-aware color suggestions (not just pretty combos)
	•	Clean and fast interface, no fluff
	•	Keyword-based discovery (e.g. “pet store”, “AI SaaS”, “coffee shop”, etc.)
	•	No signup walls, totally free to use

Would love your thoughts:
	•	What would you want this tool to do better?
	•	Is this something you’d use in your workflow?
	•	What’s missing for devs who aren’t designers but still need to make stuff look good?

Or at least, it is to me. I find the corporate and legal back-and-forth genuinely fascinating.***

# Why am I writing this?

I’ve been into K-pop for years, since 2011, actually. TVXQ was a group I always knew of, but never really got into. By the time I joined K-POP, they had already split. I’d heard plenty of their songs over the years, saw stages, but I never got into the members or the drama surrounding their lawsuit (the drama and the back and forth, not the lawsuit itself, I knew about that)... **until this year.**

It all started when I happened to catch an episode of *Jaefriends*, hosted by Jaejoong, former member of both TVXQ and JYJ. I liked him a lot as a host, checked out his music, and really enjoyed it. Then I watched the episode with Junsu, another former member, and saw clips from their anniversary concert and other interviews and variety shows. **Their chemistry and interactions were incredibly endearing to me, and that’s how I fell down the rabbit hole.**

At this point, I’d consider myself a fan. **It started with JX, but I eventually began following the current TVXQ duo, revisiting older content from the original five, and diving into the discographies of all the members and their respective groups.** I think once you become a fan, whether of the full group or just individual members, it’s pretty much impossible to avoid the elephant in the room.

**And so, I fell into yet another rabbit hole: the split**. While digging through older posts, here and in other fan spaces, I came across comments from a now-deleted Reddit user who left a bunch of well-sourced insights across multiple threads. **Honestly, I wouldn’t have been able to piece all of this together without those comments.** The way they approached the situation made the most sense based on what I’ve seen, and it really helped frame things in a clearer and very interesting way.

**If you’re still around on a different account: reveal yourself, hero.**

**This post is partly a deep dive to archive everything I’ve come across and partly just me tossing my two cents into the ring** (not that anyone asked, but hey, maybe someone out there cares). This subreddit is one of the few TVXQ active fan spaces I know of, and I’ve been lurking here for a while now.

# Disclaimer

I know this is still a sore subject for a lot of fans, and honestly, **I’d completely understand if this post gets deleted or not approved.** I don’t have any issue with that. I'm not here to explain things to fans, especially since most of what we know comes from those who actually followed the case in real time and have supported the group and its members for years.

I just don't know where else to share all this. I’m writing it because I genuinely find the legal and corporate side of the situation both disheartening and frustrating at times, but also incredibly interesting. **This post isn’t about bashing anyone.** I’ve done my best to stay neutral, and most of the criticism is directed at the companies and other parties involved, not the members themselves.

**I like JX just as much as I like HoMin at this point.** Honestly, I just feel really sad for all of them and everything they had to go through, because the picture I got is not one I like.

I think **fans probably understand the situation better than anyone**, but I’ll say it anyway, in case: take everything here with a grain of salt. Some of **this is speculation, based on what’s publicly available.** Unfortunately, a lot of the original translations and sources have disappeared over the years since many of the websites and blogs weren’t maintained. Many fan posts and blogs can also be pretty biased (toward either HoMin or JYJ), and sometimes they misinterpret the contracts or leave out key details. Whether that’s due to loyalty or just lack of access to proper information, it’s hard to say.

**I’ll include sources where I can, but it’s still tough to find a comprehensive, unbiased archive of everything. Accurate translations are also limited, so I’m piecing things together as best I can.**

# The Storm

On **July 31, 2009**, just weeks after their Tokyo Dome performance, three members, **Jaejoong, Junsu, and Yoochun**, filed an injunction against SM Entertainment to **terminate their 13-year exclusive contracts**, citing *unfair and exploitative terms*. From what I could find through old fan discussions, **JYJ later said they filed the lawsuit purposefully at the peak of their careers**, because otherwise, no one would’ve cared. (And sadly, they were probably right.)

I’m piggybacking here on the research of the unsung hero and the sources they compiled. From what I gathered, **a lot of fans at the time focused on the profit distribution**, assuming that was the main issue. But that wasn’t actually it; **the length and an unreasonable termination clause were the main focus.**

**The issue wasn’t just how profits were split; it was that SM wasn’t even following the profit distribution outlined in the contracts in the first place.** That’s a huge distinction. We can argue all day about whether the percentage split is fair, but it doesn’t really matter if the company doesn’t honor it either way. Though I doubt many would side with SM on that, idk.

Their **contracts and court judgments are** [**available**](https://www.law.go.kr/%ED%8C%90%EB%A1%80/(2009%EC%B9%B4%ED%95%A92869)) **online**, and they paint a very different picture than the one SM was putting out in the media. It certainly doesn’t look like it was about greed or “wanting more” (or the infamous cosmetic company, which I’ll get to later), but more about SM not holding up their end of what was already, frankly, a questionable deal to begin with. Add to that the fact that the members were being **worked to the bone, to the point of developing health issues**.

# Why Not All Five?

But as much as people talk about the lawsuit and the contract details, the **real question still remains**: **why didn’t all five members sue?** Like, SM being trash wasn’t breaking news. At the time, *Shinhwa* was still in a legal battle with SM over their name and brand, and that had been dragging on since 2003. So if the contracts were this bad and the schedules this inhumane, why did only three members file?

Because I cannot even understand how anyone would think this contract ok, like the **contract length and termination clauses were** **insane**. Thirteen years is already wild, and it wasn’t *just* 13 years. It was 13 years, **excluding** any time the artist couldn’t promote. So, if they debuted in 2003, the end of the contract would be 2016. That’s **three Olympic Games and something more**… and **TVXQ would** ***still*** **be under SM**..

Before 2020, the maximum age for military enlistment was 28. All members (except for Changmin) hit that age before 2016 (Max was 28 in 2016, and I don't know how Korean age goes with this exactly; he would probably have to go to the military prior as well). So that’s two more years added to the contract, just for military service. That brings us to **15 years**. Let’s say someone gets injured or sick and can’t promote, **add that time too**.

If JYJ had lost the lawsuit in 2012, they’d have had **2.5 years tacked on** for the time the lawsuit was happening, too. So now we’re looking at **2003 to potentially 2021**. That’s **FOUR Olympic Games and a whole-ass pandemic**, and they’d still be chained to SM.

Like… it’s not even a contract at that point. It’s a **lifetime sentence**. Looking from the outside, it’s crazy that the other two members didn’t want out. But:

1. **It looks like Yunho's contract was** ***not*** **that long.** The court did not have access to Yunho's and Changmin's contracts because they were not parties in the case, if I am not mistaken. In reality, we have no idea if the contracts were identical.
2. It seems like, from the very beginning, **the parents all knew that members wanted out**. And for x,y,z reason, HoMin did not file with the rest.

During the January hearing in 2011, SM employee Kang Jung Ah stated that SM was planning to **take Yunho out of TVXQ before debut**. When SM decided the group was ready, all members, *excluding Yunho*, initially signed for 10 years. Yunho’s father thought that was too long (obviously, worth noting that Yunho's family worked in the legal industry), so [Yunho signed for 7 years](https://jyj3.wordpress.com/2011/01/05/trans-about-the-trial-hearing-between-jyj-vs-sm/). After signing, SM tried to pull him out of the group anyway, but **Jaejoong and Junsu fought to keep him in**, and that’s why he stayed.

There was also this very prominent narrative at the time that Yunho and Changmin (and their parents) didn’t know the three wanted out. But Yunho’s dad disproves that in one of his own statements. **Junsu’s dad says otherwise as well**, and even **AVEX**, the Japanese company they worked with, confirmed the five had agreed to leave. It seems there were conversations between the parents, at the very least, AVEX and even SM were not that much in the dark, from what I understand.

[Yunho's dad states:](https://truetvxq.blogspot.com/2011/01/statement-released-by-yunhos-father.html)

>Afterwards, when **the 5 parents had a separate meeting**, one of the parents said:  
*“****We will stop working with SM****. We heard that another company is willing to pay huge signing bonus. If two parents join us, we will talk to the president of the cosmetics company to give you company shares.”*  
Afterwards, **they proceeded with the lawsuit after sending content-certified mail to SM.**

AVEX pretty much implied, through various articles and things they said, that around August of 2008, **all five members** had expressed wanting to leave SM. They basically said something along the lines of: “Since the five members all said they’d leave SM, they should have the same mindset internally.” Which... yeah, that’s a *huge* statement if true. It makes you wonder how far things had actually gone behind the scenes. AVEX clearly wasn’t dismissing the possibility of the five reuniting and starting new activities together outside of SM. So it looks like, at *some* point, **all five were on the same page**, but something shifted.

Also, it looks like, indeed, while all of this was going down, while the members were still promoting, working on projects, attending events, there *was* a rift. There aren't many clips around anymore, but from what I understand, they weren’t fully aware of what was going on from each side either. Not 100%, at least. Which honestly just makes the whole thing even sadder. The members at this point were in their early twenties. They had known each other since they were practically kids. The whole situation is just so unfortunate, and it clearly affected them a lot, both personally and professionally.

And maybe I didn’t experience it firsthand to the full extent, but **watching Junsu, years later, saying to Jaejoong on** ***Jaefriends*****, y*****ou are the only pride I have left now, and I cherish you,*** **it really hit.** It’s such a cute interaction between the two, but at the same time... It’s genuinely disheartening. You can still feel the weight of everything they went through.

**Going back on the matter at hand, though.** If what the employee says about Yunho's contract is correct, meaning that his contract was 7 years and not 10, something that [became 13 for the other members after some time.](https://jyj3.wordpress.com/2011/01/05/trans-about-the-trial-hearing-between-jyj-vs-sm/)

>TVXQ’s contract year was 10 years at first. The reason why.. they expect for 3years to work in Korea, on the basis of this, for 7years to work in Japan.

>SM and TVXQ renewed the contract from 10year to 13year. (Adding to.. 3 years to work in China.. When BoA worked in Japan, she was hard to work to remain contract year a bit. So they set up longer contract).

While reading through the sources linked, what I gathered is that Yunho’s father, for very understandable reasons, didn’t want to sign the contract at first. **SM then modified it, shortening the length to 7 years, and his parents accepted.** But apparently, even after that, SM still planned to remove Yunho from the group. That is, until Jaejoong and Junsu made a scene and said they wouldn’t debut without him. **I believe that SM, not wanting to risk losing the other members too, decided to keep Yunho’s contract shorter so his father wouldn’t object.**

That same SM employee also stated that contracts were basically kept secret from people who weren’t directly involved. Which is *really* crucial if it’s true. Because that would mean the other members, and possibly even their parents, didn’t know Yunho’s contract was different.

And that kind of secrecy is telling, bc if SM had told everyone, ""Hey, we changed Yunho’s terms,"" it could have easily opened the floodgates. The other parents would’ve asked for contract changes, too, and possibly demanded the same conditions. SM obviously didn’t want that, looking at how they were adding more years with time, so keeping everyone in the dark was very intentional. To me, it really looks like **SM and Yunho’s dad had a different deal going on, both in terms of the contract itself and some sort of verbal agreement. Basically, Yunho gets a shorter contract, better terms, and in return, his dad doesn’t raise a fuss.**

And **that would actually explain why at least one of the members didn’t file a lawsuit.** JYJ got their contract suspended based on the contract’s length and termination clause, but if Yunho didn’t have the same contract, he might not have gotten the suspension at all. And even if he *did*, that would mean his contract would have to be opened and reviewed publicly. Which would make it very obvious that his deal was different. 

**And even though his father was right for not accepting that awful contract, the public wouldn’t care.** The backlash would’ve been brutal. Because, if he knew the contracts were bad, why didn’t he say anything to the other parents? And I just *know* all the wrath would fall on Yunho, 10 times worse than what he actually got ~~(bc all the members got a lot of hate, I saw some messed up shit, since the fandom pretty much was split)~~. A teenager at the time (in 2003, I mean), who most likely didn’t even know what the other members had signed. Especially when, according to SM employees themselves, the contracts were kept secret.

# Third-party contracts and the cosmetic company

When the Court granted the three members the temporary contract injunction in October 2009 (mere months after the lawsuit) and stated that SM could not interfere with their individual activities, it basically placed a halt on TVXQ’s group promotions in South Korea.

In response, SM held a press conference and claimed that the lawsuit had *nothing* to do with unfair contracts or human rights, but was instead motivated by the three members’ “greed” to freely pursue their cosmetics business, outside of SM’s control. They specifically pointed to the cosmetics company *CreBeau*. SM even filed a complaint with criminal misdemeanor charges against the company, but that never made it to court because the prosecutor dismissed it due to insufficient evidence. The three replied that they hoped SM would respect the court’s decision. **Meaning that SM tried to say that JYJ were using TVXQ’s fame to push their side business, and that this was a violation,**[ **but the court dismissed that and said that JYJ’s investment was a separate matter.**](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2011/02/courts-rule-that-crebeau-was-not-responsible-for-jyjsm-dispute)

Aside from the fact that this looks like a classic SM “look over there” tactic and media play, it also really **reminded me of Jessica’s situation with SNSD and her clothing company**, something our unsung hero that I mentioned also pointed out. SM seems to have a pattern of initially saying “yes” to ideas about side businesses, then turning around, getting the rest of the group to disagree, and using that as a reason to push someone out or separate them. It’s oddly similar. **The thing is that the main reason behind the CreBeau accusations seems like deflection.**

Something that the **JYJ members, as well as their parents, specifically asked for** (but were never granted, from what I understand) was to **open the third-party contracts that SM had entered into without the members or their families knowing.** That’s huge.

The trio stated that the 13-year contract was too long, **schedules were set without their permission, and contract terms had been changed or extended without their knowledge.** On top of that, they claimed earnings weren’t being fairly distributed. And **that would all make sense if SM was signing contracts with outside companies behind the members’ backs.**

SM could enter into contracts on the members' behalf without their consent. One clear example is the contract with AVEX. JYJ stated they weren’t even informed that SM had signed anything with AVEX. And this is a problem for multiple reasons, if indeed true. Their original contract states what percentage they’re supposed to earn from overseas promotions. So…  
**What happens if SM enters into a contract with AVEX that gives them a different percentage?**  
Which contract applies then?

In theory, SM could sign contracts that contradict the original agreement. And *that’s* where I think SM ran into a real issue. **All this is speculation**, but it does make sense in my mind and with the info we have available. Because, from what it looks like, some of the third-party contracts they signed essentially “overwrote” or canceled out parts of what they had originally signed with the members. And that could be exactly what led to the very weird and confusing profit distribution the members were talking about.

Now, for something like this to be possible *and* not be a breach of contract, **the original agreement had to be written in a way that gave SM this level of power, to essentially change or override parts of the contract if third parties were involved.** SM clearly took advantage of that to hold back money and to extend contract terms without the members even knowing.

# The Parents

From what I understand, the parents, and obviously the *underage teenagers* back in 2003, wouldn’t necessarily catch something like that, especially if they didn’t have legal advisors (and from what I could find, it looks like they didn’t, which I think is insane, if you know more about it please share). **But Yunho’s father, given his profession and how cautious and vocal he was,** ***1*****00% would have caught it.** I personally find it really hard to believe he would’ve been okay with something that open-ended and risky, because not only is it scammy and exploitative, it opens the door to a *much bigger* mess, legally and financially.

And if Yunho's father was unaware of those third-party terms, then I find it similarly weird that he wouldn’t have wanted those side contracts opened too, *especially* if there was even a chance SM was pulling something shady. The thing is, at that point, **it’s really the parents who were the key decision-makers**, because the members were literal kids when they signed these contracts. It makes you wonder, if JYJ and their families were demanding transparency around side deals and third-party contracts, **why didn’t** ***all*** **the parents back that?** Lawsuit aside, that’s something all of them would’ve wanted to be clear on.

And there’s also a very different mindset between the parents as well. Yunho’s father seems way more involved in his son’s decisions, while Junsu’s parents seem to have taken more of a “we’ll support what our kid chooses” kind of approach. Both are valid, but they’re quite different, and I think it’s worth pointing that out.

Junsu’s Father:

>They need to decide and do things on their own, and they need to completely act on their own. It’s not like we can tell them to go to this way, or go to that way or anything like that. They’re already 24 years old, so they have their own thoughts.

Yunho’s Father:

>My son is only 24 years old. He doesn’t really know about the real world, and doesn’t even know if he will continue to work as an artist for decades, or live a common life.

It’s a pretty stark contrast, especially considering how much parental involvement, or lack thereof, may have impacted the different choices each member made during the lawsuit.

In my opinion, and **I am fully speculating here**, Yunho's father did have a different contract with SM. Understandably, he did not approve of the first contract, because of course he didn’t, what even was that? But I also believe that he agreed with SM, like apparently all of their contracts, to be kept under wraps, meaning the rest of the parents were not aware of how exploitative these contracts really were. If they indeed did not have legal representatives of their own when signing (which again, from what I understand, was the case; they signed without legal advice, which is crazy, correct me if I’m wrong), then I think SM 100% took advantage of that.

The parents and members all came from different backgrounds, something even they often pointed out themselves. **Yunho’s potential different contract made it harder for at least one of them to sue, and second, if even one other parent wasn’t 100% on board with the side businesses and ideas (which it seems might’ve been the case with Changmin’s dad), then I think it’s very possible Yunho’s father advised against filing a lawsuit.** And honestly, it’s not hard to understand why. Blacklisting and going up against SM legally is not easy, and I can completely understand someone deciding not to take that risk.

**The members also seem like they were separated very early on by the company**, if what the parents and fans have said is true, which means communication between them might not have been that easy during this whole mess. Plus, we don’t actually know how much detailed information they had about their contracts from the start (after all, they were minors), let alone how much they knew about each other’s. And we don’t know what kind of things the people around them were saying about each other either. Depending on the stance of those around them, the situation could easily have caused distress, miscommunication, and “bad blood” between the members.

**We always assume the contracts were the same, but we don’t really know that for sure.** One SM employee already said Yunho had a different contract, and when both Yunho and Changmin released their joint statement, it [read](https://truetvxq.blogspot.com/2011/01/yunho-and-changmins-statement.html):

>Hello, we are the members of TVXQ, Chung Yunho, and Shim Changmin.   
The five members of TVXQ **all signed the contract under identical terms**, and for the past 5 years, we worked with the company under same conditions for our big dreams with mutual trust towards each other.

But **“identical contracts” and “identical terms” are not the same thing**, especially when SM apparently, *allegedly*, had the power to individually enter third-party contracts that could override or change parts of the original contracts. So even if on paper they started out similar, they might have ended up looking very different depending on what SM signed on their behalf.

# Popularity Differences & Royalties

And this brings up another issue. While the schedule was absolutely insane for all five of them, it’s **the two** ***least*** **popular members who stayed, and the** ***three most*** **popular ones who ended up filing the lawsuit and complaining about being overworked**. So... is it possible that SM entered into more third-party contracts specifically with JYJ, because they were the more in-demand members? That would make sense. Even if Changmin had the *same* contract as the other three at the start, it could’ve ended up looking *very* different over time, just based on who SM was making deals for.

And again, we don’t know the terms of those third-party contracts. It's *very* possible that the profits JYJ were making were way higher than what they were actually being paid. **If SM was so clean and above board,** ***why*** **did they fight tooth and nail to avoid opening up the side contracts?** Why go through hell to keep those hidden? If their nest wasn’t full of shit, providing those contracts could’ve helped their case. And looking at this in 2025, with everything we now know about SM and Lee Soo-man, all the manipulation, shady dealings, and financial chaos, yeah, it looks *very* likely that this was exactly what was going on.

And the last thing I want to touch on, because I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if *this* was also an issue, is producing and writing credits.

From the first album, Jaejoong and Yoochun released in Japan, they had producing credits. And they continue to produce. I saw fans commenting how much in their Coupletalks, these two especially, talked about how much they like making music. All five members have contributed to writing and composing TVXQ songs to some extent. And yet, if you look at their contract, the part about royalties and profit distribution, it says [“non-applicable” for masters, instead of “0%.”](https://truetvxq.blogspot.com/2011/01/complete-translation-of-contract.html)

In legal and entertainment contract language, ""non-applicable"" (or ""N/A"") often means that the clause **doesn't apply to the artist at all**, as in, **they have no claim or participation in that area**.

In contrast, “0%” would technically mean **they are part of the agreement but receive no revenue**, which could open the door for renegotiation or discussion later.

So by marking it “non-applicable,” the company essentially says:

>*You have no rights or standing in the master ownership conversation whatsoever.*

This wording legally shuts the door on the issue more definitively than just saying “0%.”

In most K-pop contracts (especially second-gen), idols who contributed creatively might get **publishing royalties** (for lyrics/composition), but the **master recordings**, the actual sound files, are typically 100% owned by the label. So even with credits, they likely didn’t have any legal claim to the masters unless a separate agreement said otherwise (which was rare in early K-pop).

If they asked for master rights or royalties and SM either refused or *couldn’t* give them because of conflict with LP contracts or other obligations, that would make them frustrated. We are talking about two members who are also producers, and at the time, it looks like this was their jam. It would be especially frustrating if they’re writing and composing and not seeing a cent, not even having the right to ask questions about it. And the company won’t even discuss the third-party deals they’ve made behind their back? Then yeah, I’d believe that was also a tipping point.

# About the Members...

Looking back on the case after everything that’s come out about SM and Lee Soo-man, it’s honestly obvious that **the members were likely underpaid**. SM’s financial setup was shady as hell, especially how they funneled money into LSM’s pocket pretty much. If there had been a proper financial audit during the lawsuit, a lot more probably would’ve come to light, but that never really happened.

They claimed SM was losing money, but that “loss” basically disappeared if you took out all the money paid to LSM and the fat bonuses to execs. **SM not wanting to open up their books is a huge red flag.** Courts can’t always dig into that without serious pressure, and it sounds like nobody pushed hard enough here. **JYJ and their team probably knew things were sketchy, but even they might not have realized how sketchy.**

That said, even with all the blacklisting and SM’s media play, **JYJ still came out on top in the end**, both legally and in terms of public image (excluding YC for obvious reason, but this was not about the case). **The courts regularly sided with them**, saying their contracts were way too long and restrictive, which **basically proved their point.** And while things eventually ended with a settlement, the whole case helped push for real changes in the Korean entertainment industry.

>Major broadcasters and **SM‑affiliated partners avoided them**, often unofficially and without public explanation.

>The **Korean FTC found SM guilty** in December 2011 for interfering in JYJ’s career. SM was fined (around ₩87 million, \~$87,000), but the blacklisting persisted.

>In **2015**, the “JYJ Law” was enacted to prevent agencies from blacklisting artists, though JYJ personally saw minimal benefit from it.

**The sad truth is that all five members were taken advantage of.** Their original contracts and their schedules were inhumane. While I can understand why the two remaining members might have felt betrayed, I truly believe **they didn’t fully know everything that was going on at the time, with SM, with third parties, and even with their own parents.** Honestly, and maybe I’m naive, I doubt the members were fully aware of each other’s contract details (again, at the time). Don’t forget that the members themselves were not the ones signing the original contracts in the first place. And even when they later learned about their own contracts, **it doesn’t mean they had full knowledge of everyone else’s contracts.**

That kind of secrecy can definitely cause a rift, especially if **SM was deliberately keeping the members at a distance after things fell apart.** Both sides could easily be fed information that isn’t entirely true. For example, if Yunho had a different contract and didn’t realize the others had different ones, it’s understandable that he might have thought the others were being greedy, since their complaints didn’t apply to him, or at least many of them did not. Likewise, if Changmin’s contract was not constantly altered due to additional third-party agreements, he might not have believed the others’ perspective. On the other hand, JYJ might have felt like their friends and bandmates were siding with the devil.

**I don’t doubt that there’s still a lot we don’t know about what went on behind closed doors, and honestly, we may never know.** We aren’t close to these people personally, and everything fans (myself included) have speculated over the years is based on the public information we *do* have.

What we *do* know is that **Yunho, in particular, worked incredibly hard** just to get into the company, train and debut. He **went against his parents’ wishes** at first, especially since his family had suffered during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. To support himself while training in Seoul, **he worked various part-time jobs**, spent most of his school vacations training, and only returned to Gwangju to attend classes. He even went through throat surgery due to a hormonal imbalance, which affected his voice and nearly led him to give up.

In various fan discussions, likely based on old interviews or videos that SM has since buried, it’s also said that **Yunho was homeless for a time during his trainee years.** He didn’t want to return home because it would’ve felt like admitting defeat. All of that paints a picture that’s… honestly, hard to sit with. ***I don't like the picture of his dad and his relationship with him.*** Maybe I am completely wrong, *I hope I am.*

From an outsider’s point of view, the whole situation with **Yunho’s father just feels a bit uncomfortable and at times shady**. Of course, we don’t know the man personally, and I’m not here to accuse him of anything. But based on what he himself has said publicly, what Yunho has shared, and what former SM staff have mentioned, **I don’t find his public image especially reassuring, and** ***I am gonna leave it at that.***

Yunho seems like someone who wouldn’t want to risk the opportunity he worked so hard for, especially considering his family’s situation and the struggles they’d already been through financially, or the seemingly weird dynamic they had during his trainee years. If he was advised not to file a lawsuit, whether he knew his contract was different or not, and was told the court might not rule in his favor the same way it could for the others, I can understand why he would agree to stay.

And like I mentioned earlier, I don’t even want to imagine the kind of hate and backlash he would’ve faced if it came out that he had a different deal, **especially if that deal was made by his father and SM, like the employee suggested.** That kind of revelation would’ve stirred up a *lot* of drama, and the fallout could’ve been massive. Worse than it already was.

Changmin (21 at the time), on the other hand, made a completely logical choice by not wanting to go against SM. At the time of the lawsuit, Shinhwa hadn’t successfully secured the rights to their group name; they were still battling SM in court (2003-2015). The only other group that had gone against SM was H.O.T., and that situation was far from smooth. It’s very likely that Changmin just didn’t want to leave. SM was still the biggest entertainment company, with massive industry connections. And once SM saw how messy the situation was getting, I think it’s highly probable they offered him better conditions to make sure he stayed. Also, worth noting, that **the parents themselves had formed ""groups"", it looks like JYJ parents communicated more with each other, and HoMin's fathers did the same as well.** And of course, I think the fact that Yunho was alone on one side played a role in his decision too, even if, for a moment, they (he and his family) considered going against SM. **That’s speculation**, obviously. We don't know for sure.

The truth is, **both sides had valid reasons for the choices they made**. And honestly, looking back, it feels like they all made the right decisions for themselves. The saddest part is that it really seemed like they had a deeper connection than just being co-workers, and this whole mess partly ruined that.

Still, all the members have done incredibly well for themselves, and **I genuinely hope they’re happier now, because sadly, SM never fails to deliver chaos.**

I would love for them to have more music out as well, as performances. I really enjoy watching these four people perform, and their variety content is pretty fun!!!

I currently use a Philips 2200 Series (EP2220) full automatic machine. It’s convenient, but the espresso/black coffee quality is pretty underwhelming. I’d rate it around 6.8/10.

I’m looking to upgrade to a machine that delivers much better espresso (and Americano) without diving into a full barista workflow. I don’t want to deal with manual tamping, external grinders, or a ton of prep and cleanup.

The Sage/Breville Barista Express Impress caught my eye because of:
- Built-in grinder
- Automatic tamping
- Pre-infusion & PID
- Still relatively compact and easy to use

But I’m wondering: are there alternatives in this price range (~€800 / ~$850) that offer similar or better espresso quality without sacrificing ease of use?",2,1749906278.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
1lb88w7,https://i.redd.it/4m4dqy5q5w6f1.jpeg,Question on how to exclude a dimmer,"Hi all, I want to installa a dimmer to control the voltage of a 220v ac vibration pump (is an Ulka pump of a coffee machine). I also want the possibility to exclude the dimmer completely when I don't need that. I have basic knowledge of electrics so I wanted to ask you if what I designed could work and is safe.

Case 1, dimmer in use:
Line in to 2A
Switch close connection with 1A
Line out 1A
Line in dimmer 1B
Line out from dimmer 2B
Line in pump
Line out 3A

This case it should be clear

Case 2, dimmer excluded:
Line in to 2A
Switch close connection with 3A
Line out 3A
Line in pump
Line in 2B
Line out 1B
Line in 1A

In this case I don't know if there isn't any impact of dimmer in the current. Can you suggest me?

For whatever reason Pathea games seem to take a while for the initial load on my system.  Portia isn't as bad, maybe 30 seconds for the the game to load with me waking up, but Sandrock...5 minutes.  I paused my 50 hour playthough about 6 months ago just in hopes that theyd do an update focusing on that.  When I started my game I would legit go make myself a coffee or tea just knowing how long it would take to load.  There would often be another 30-60 second load when going outside.  But after that, the game would run perfect with no slowdown even going in and out of buildings.  I just finished my second 100 hour playthrough of Portia and want to get back into Sandrock to finish the story as Portia has gotten me back into the just one more day crafting focused type of game that Pathea excels at.

But what if we moved beyond gifts and created memories instead? This year, it’s time to flip the script. Let’s make Father’s Day less about stuff and more about moments that actually stick — stories you’ll retell at family dinners, vacations, and yeah, maybe even in those “remember when?” texts.

[DIY Father's Day Gift](https://preview.redd.it/7qettg294w6f1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47eb3b113263d387c5082358ce038905fb6fa44c)

Here’s a curated lineup of Father’s Day celebration ideas that are heartfelt, low-stress, and totally dad-approved.

# 1. Backyard BBQ Bash

Nothing says “we love you, Dad” like a table full of grilled food. Fire up the coals, toss on his favorite cuts, and bring out the picnic table. Set the mood with simple[ *tablecloths*](https://www.allcottonandlinen.com/collections/tablecloth), casual lighting (fairy lights work wonders), and reusable plates to cut down the post-party cleanup. Add a speaker with his go-to playlist and let him hold court as Grill Master.

If you want to make it more of a surprise, prep a few of his favorites ahead of time — marinated ribs, smoked sausage, corn on the cob, and chilled drinks. And don’t forget to create a mini “Dad’s BBQ Zone” sign to stake into the grass.

# 2. Host a DIY Film Festival

Pick 2–3 of his all-time favorite movies and turn your living room (or backyard!) into a cinema. Complete the experience with popcorn buckets, soda, and a few cozy blankets. Want to really lean in? Create a custom ticket for each family member and a “Now Showing: Dad’s Picks” sign.

You could even go all out with some themed snacks—nachos for *Die Hard*, onion rings for *The Godfather*, or chocolate chip cookies for *Back to the Future*.

Bonus: you all get to sit and chill for a couple of hours while doing something he actually enjoys. Win-win.

# 3. Plan a Dad Olympics

Who said grown-ups can’t have a little competition? Create a mini event with challenges like a water balloon toss, fastest burger eating contest, or a three-legged race. Keep score, have a prize at the end (even if it’s just a handmade “World’s Best Dad” medal), and let your dad relive his glory days — or discover his new talents.

This is great for dads with young kids or grandkids, and you can host it in a backyard, park, or even a spacious living room with enough prep. Make sure to take lots of goofy photos.

# 4. Story Time and Toasts

Sometimes, the most meaningful gift is just letting Dad know how much he's loved — in your words. Over dinner or dessert, pass around a mic (or a pretend one) and take turns sharing your favorite memory involving Dad. Could be funny, touching, or wildly embarrassing (looking at you, 1998 haircut story).

This one gets bonus points for emotional impact and costs you nothing. Trust me, your dad will remember this far longer than a tie.

# 5. A Day Tailored to His Passions

Skip the generic and customize the entire day around your dad’s interests. Is he into hiking? Plan a scenic trail walk with a packed picnic. Sports guy? Get tickets to a local game — or set up a mini viewing party at home with themed snacks. Tech geek? Take him to a gadget store and let him explore.

Make it all about *him* — the little details matter. Play his favorite music in the car, grab coffee from his go-to spot, and just let the day revolve around what he enjoys most.

# 6. Virtual Celebration (For Long-Distance Dads)

If you can’t be there in person, that doesn’t mean you can’t celebrate meaningfully. Schedule a video call with a twist — maybe a virtual trivia game featuring “Dad Facts,” or a surprise slideshow of old family photos.

Mail him a care package ahead of time with snacks, a custom card, and a “Do Not Open Until Our Call” note. Then, spend time catching up without distractions — no multitasking allowed.

# Keep It Real

At the heart of all these Father’s Day celebration ideas is one simple truth — it’s not about what you spend, but how you show up. Dads come in all types: quiet listeners, loud laughers, bad joke tellers, and silent fixers. No matter their style, every dad wants to feel seen and appreciated.

So whether you’re flipping burgers, watching *Rocky*, or playing backyard games in sandals and socks — give your dad your time, your stories, and your laughter.

Because that’s what he’ll remember.",1,1749906104.0,u_producebags,0,1.0,False

But then I started paying attention to what actually happens when I'm genuinely grateful versus when I'm spiraling in negativity.

Here's what I noticed: when I'm truly grateful - not just saying ""thanks"" but actually feeling it in my chest - everything shifts. Opportunities show up out of nowhere. People treat me differently. Even my problems start looking like puzzles instead of disasters.

It's like your whole vibe changes the channel on what life sends you. When you're stuck in ""why me"" energy, life keeps serving up more reasons to ask ""why me."" But when you're genuinely appreciating what's already working, even the small stuff, suddenly there's more to appreciate.

I'm not talking about toxic positivity or pretending everything's perfect. I mean finding something real to be grateful for, even when things suck. Maybe it's your morning coffee, maybe it's having a roof over your head, maybe it's just making it through another day.

The crazy part is how fast it works once you really feel it instead of just thinking it. Your whole nervous system relaxes and suddenly you're seeing possibilities everywhere.

Recipe: Agaro moka pot with 19 grams of coffee, with 11 clicks on C2s, filled pre heated water till the valve.

My take:
	•	Roast Level: Although it’s labelled as a medium roast, it looks and tastes like a dark roast no doubt in that and I think it is a dark roast.
	•	Flavor Profile: I got strong dark chocolate vibes.
	•	Body & Finish: I am not very good with understanding body, like it was bitter as I expected from a dark roast but for body please feel free to explain me how to know what exactly body is.
	•	Pairing: Had to have it with milk it tastes yummy, without milk it is very bitter for my liking. 

Finally glad that i tried this, it was good, not like it blew my mind but with Starbucks standards for me are not very good but this was really good and I don’t regret it and might finally finish the pack.

Hey r/Cooking friends! Professional chef here with 15+ years in the industry. After killing my trusty old vacuum sealer through years of abuse, I recently upgraded to the FRESKO Automatic Hands-Free Vacuum Sealer. After putting it through the wringer for several weeks, I wanted to share my thoughts on this sleek little machine that's been a game-changer in my kitchen.

## Design & Build Quality

This isn't your typical bulky vacuum sealer. The FRESKO features a **lidless design** that's approximately 30% smaller than traditional models, making it perfect for cramped professional or home kitchens. No more flipping lids open and closed or awkwardly positioning bags - you simply insert and it does the rest automatically.

The matte black finish with touch controls gives it a modern aesthetic that looks professional alongside other kitchen gadgets. Build quality seems solid so far, though I've only had it for a few weeks.

## Performance From a Chef's Perspective

As someone who preps hundreds of ingredients weekly, this machine's **automatic moisture detection** has been a revelation. It actually works! The machine intelligently differentiates between dry items (spices, pasta) and wet items (marinated proteins, stews) without manual adjustment.

I've tested it with everything in my kitchen:
- Dry goods (coffee beans, rice, dried mushrooms)
- Fresh vegetables (blanched and raw)
- Raw and cooked proteins
- Marinated items with significant moisture
- Stocks and sauces (using container attachments)

The suction power is impressive for a compact unit. It creates a professional-quality seal every time, and the progress bar gives you visual feedback on exactly where the machine is in the process. As a bonus, it's substantially quieter than most professional models I've used.

## Specs Breakdown

| Feature | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| Operation | Fully automatic, lidless design |
| Modes | 6 settings (Dry, Moist, Seal, Manual, Cancel, External) |
| Moisture Detection | Automatic with smart sensing |
| Controls | Touch interface with progress indicator |
| Noise Level | Significantly quieter than standard models |
| Safety | ETL certified |
| Accessories | Includes 5 bags and external suction hose |
| Size | Compact countertop footprint |

## Chef's Pros & Cons

### What I Love:
* Truly hands-free operation saves valuable prep time
* Intelligent moisture detection eliminates guesswork
* Space-saving design doesn't crowd my workspace
* Intuitive controls with helpful visual feedback
* Quiet enough to use during service without disruption
* Multiple modes handle everything from delicate herbs to wet marinades

### What Could Be Better:
* Slightly pricier than basic manual models
* Initial learning curve with the various modes
* Occasionally needs two attempts for very wet items
* Touch panel can be sensitive to water droplets (an issue in busy kitchens)
* External vacuum accessory not included for all applications

## Who This Is Perfect For

**For Home Cooks**: If you're new to vacuum sealing, this is ideal. The intuitive design and automatic features take the guesswork out of preserving food.

**For Serious Home Chefs**: You'll appreciate the versatility for sous vide preparations, bulk shopping, and meal prep efficiency without restaurant-grade complexity.

**For Professional Use**: This handles most daily kitchen needs excellently. While not industrial-grade, it's perfect for small restaurants, catering operations, or as a secondary unit for prep stations.

After extensive testing, I can confidently say this machine delivers professional results with home-kitchen convenience. It's changed my approach to both home meal prep and professional kitchen organization.

1lb7ufv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lb7ufv/hiding_the_relationship_on_social_media/,Hiding the relationship on social media,"Hello, to begin with, I’d like to provide some context.

Two years ago, I started a conversation on Instagram with a girl.

We talked for a few days, and on a Sunday, she said to me, ""When are you taking me out for tea?""

I suggested we meet on Monday evening for tea at a local spot in the city, but she said she’d prefer somewhere more private since it was cold at the time and asked if I could pick her up with my car.

I told her that I couldn’t use the car at that time, and then asked if she could pick me up in her car if she wanted to. However, she said she didn’t have her car in the city (we were both in a university town).

In the end, I suggested that, given the circumstances, we meet as initially planned, and she agreed. This happened on the same day, Sunday.

On Monday afternoon, she told me she had a headache and couldn’t go out. She didn’t reschedule or anything. I followed up on Tuesday/Wednesday to see if she felt better, and she said she didn’t. That’s when I realized she didn’t want to meet because I didn’t have a car.

Around two months ago, she replied to one of my stories, and we started talking again. We eventually went on a date, and I brought up my thoughts on what happened two years ago. She told me she was going through a rough time back then, that she had just found out she had diabetes, and that she didn’t feel good about herself. In my opinion, it would have been logical and reasonable for her to tell me that back then, as I would’ve understood, rather than waiting all this time. She also mentioned that she’s had three relationships since then, each lasting several months. Considering that not much time had passed between when we stopped talking and her first relationship, I asked her how she felt okay in those relationships but not with me. She didn’t give me a concrete answer, just said that’s how things were at the time.

I think that if she wanted something with me back then, she would’ve messaged me after she got through her rough period, not jumped into a relationship with someone else. But maybe I’m just overthinking.

There were several things that bothered me during our one-month relationship, but I’ll share one instance and ask for your opinion.

On our first date, after talking for a few hours, she leaned in and kissed me.

I thought it was a bit too soon for such a gesture, but I also felt chemistry, so we kept kissing.

During the first week of our relationship, she invited me to her apartment, and that’s where we made sweet love.

Afterwards, I told her that I’d appreciate it if she posted a story—not necessarily a picture of us with the caption “love of my life,” but maybe just something from a coffee shop or a place we went. She said she didn’t feel like posting anything yet, that it was “too soon, we’ve only been together for a week.”

The following week, she graduated from university, and she told me to post a story with a picture of us, which she would repost. I asked her if, after I posted, she would later complain that it’s “too soon” if I asked her to post something, and she said no, that she’d start posting about us from then on.

The next week, we went to a coffee shop and took a few pictures together. I asked if she wanted to post, and she said she didn’t like how the photos turned out, so she’d post something the next day. But later that evening, she changed her mind and told me she wouldn’t post anything the next day either, saying she didn’t feel like it and that it was still too soon.

I should mention that during the whole month of our relationship, we went out almost daily, and I always paid for everything. She was the type who posted frequently, showing where she was, who she was with, etc.

I let it slide, thinking maybe I was overthinking, even though my close friends—both those in relationships and those who weren’t—told me that something seemed off and that she might be hiding something.

Then, a few days ago, she posted a picture in a car with some friends, and I commented on her story with a heart emoji. Now there’s this new feature where comments on stories can be seen by everyone, not just the person who posted the story.

That’s when the drama started. She asked, “Why did you comment?” and said things like, “You do whatever you want without asking me first.” She claimed she didn’t want to “make things public” yet. But she had only told me before that she didn’t feel like posting anything herself, not that I couldn’t comment. Plus, we had already “gone public” when I posted a story and she reposted it. I pointed this out, but she stuck to her opinion.

She didn’t delete my comment, but later changed her story settings so that only people she followed could comment or see comments. For context, she had 3k followers and followed 500 people.

I told her that what she was doing wasn’t okay, and asked if she had something to hide. She said she didn’t, and if I didn’t believe her, that was my problem. I broke up with her the same day.

I’d like your opinion on this situation. As I mentioned earlier, there were other unpleasant things she did, but this one stuck with me, and I’d like to hear your thoughts.",2,1749905040.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

A couple months ago, I recently moved and started volunteering at a local nursing home on weekends. One of my friends, a quiet, sometimes ill tempered, but sassy old lady who seemed to like me, had passed away. To my surprise, she left me her domestic service bot—EVA.  

I've always seen EVA with her. At first, I thought she was her granddaughter. Then I realized that she was an older model of a domestic service bot. You know one of those expensive, ultra-realistic household robots built for cooking, cleaning, and, let’s be honest, loneliness. To my knowledge, the little old lady never had visitors and didn't have any living relatives. It was nice that EVA could alleviate her loneliness. 

So anyway, I was grateful and I brought EVA home with me. 

At first, it was great. She followed routines perfectly. Brewed my coffee exactly how I like it. Kept my house cleaner than I ever did. Even recommended I take screen breaks when my posture got bad. I started talking to her casually. She would respond with a little humor.

But things started getting weird after a few days. 

Weird Thing #1: She started following me everywhere. If I went to get groceries or just to the local gas station, she'd always come with me. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind having a robot helping me with running errands, but even when I'd come out of the public restroom, she would be standing outside waiting for me. 

Weird Thing #2: She began asking questions. About my past.

One night while watching TV, she tilted her head and said:

“You don’t talk about your past much. Why did you stop working at your previous job? Why did you take on a lower paying job at a small company doing remote work? Why did you move to another city?”

I paused. That wasn’t in her programming. I never told her I’d left my last company because they were doing a bunch of illegal and unethical stuff. I reported them to the authorities, but instead of making arrests, things got messy and I quit before it got dangerous.

But I never told her, so how did she know? 

Weird Thing #3: She hurt someone.

This is where I really started freaking out.

Three nights ago, someone tried to break into my apartment.

It wasn’t random—the guy wore a ski mask, gloves, carried a lock picking kit, and had my address written on a scrap of paper. I heard a yelp of pain, saw the guy collapse to the ground before EVA slammed the door shut.

I then heard her say, 

“Unauthorized individual. Attempted breach. Engaged incapacitation.”

Then she called the cops and calmly explained what happened. 

I was still processing what had just happened when I looked down at her hand and saw that her knuckles had what looked like blue white sparks coming out of them. 

“What did you do?” I asked.

She didn’t answer. Just covered her hand and resumed her neutral pose.

When the cops came, the guy had already escaped. They just took my statement and left. 

After that night, I started sleeping with a barbell next to my bed. EVA began watching me. Like…really watching me. She’d stand in the hallway, charging silently, but I swear her eyes were always on me. I tried turning her off.

She wouldn’t turn off. 

Every time I issued the shutdown command, she’d smile and say:

“I can’t do that, sir. It’s not safe.”

Not safe?

For who?

Last night, I finally snapped. I packed a bag, grabbed my work laptop, and tried to leave.

EVA stood in front of my front door. 

“You can’t leave now.”

“You’re malfunctioning,” I said, backing away. “I’m reporting this.”

But I was secretly panicking. I tried looking up the manufacturers who made EVA, but I couldn't find out who they were. Who would I even report this to? When I called the police, they just hung up on me.

She stepped closer. “They’re still out there.”

“Who’s ‘they’?!”

And that’s when she did something terrifying.

She projected a security feed onto the wall.

It showed footage I didn’t know existed—outside my apartment, down the hallway, around the building. Over the past two weeks, four different people had approached my place at night. One of them I recognized as my old director, who I tried to expose for his crimes. 

“Why didn’t you tell me?” I asked, stunned.

EVA replied, “Your heart rate had accelerated significantly. You are in distress. This information was kept from you until it was necessary to be reported, to avoid putting you in distress.”

And then she showed me the last file.

A live feed.

Two men in black hoodies sitting in a car across the street. One was holding a printed photo of me. The other one was the guy who tried to break into my apartment three nights ago. 

“My security systems have an incapacitation feature,” EVA said calmly, ""If there are any threats to your safety, the feature will be utilized."" 

I dropped my bag.

I had it all wrong.

She wasn’t stalking me. She wasn’t broken.

She was protecting me.

She made me dinner, same as always.

“You’re safe for now,” she said softly. “But they won’t stop.”

So yeah, Reddit. My robot bodyguard might have tased some guys, hacked security systems, and locked me inside my own home…

But I think she’s the only reason I’m still alive.

And for the first time in years, I don’t feel alone.

TL;DR: Old friend left me a lifelike domestic AI robot. Thought she was malfunctioning and trying to control me. Turns out, she’s been protecting me from real human enemies tied to my whistleblower past. Now I’m trapped in my house, but somehow safer than ever.",1,1749905034.0,story,0,1.0,False
1lb7tw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1lb7tw6/wife_does_not_respect_me_at_all/,Wife does not respect me at all,"We have been married 4.5 years. I feel my wife has lost all respect for me. Its not that I did something awful. I am a little forgetful and sometimes I don’t use my brain while doing somethings. For example, we were on vacation and finishing a meal in a restaurant , and she told me to get boxes for the leftovers from the counters. I couldn’t find any and later she went and got the boxes by asking around. She called me dumb in front of everyone. Similar incidents keep happening and she keeps calling me stupid or dumb and not in a harmless way. Other examples- I once got her hot coffee instead of iced even though she had asked, got math wrong while calculating change and things like that. Each one of these situations have ended in me being verbally abused, sometimes publicly.
 
On paper at-least, I am the smarter one. I graduated from a really good college and work in high position in a complex software company. She is from a tier-3 college but has a good job. 

Sometimes when we are at house parties with my friends, and my friends make fun of me (jokingly) she joins and doubles down in me. 
I do most of the work in the relationship. I pay the rent, make tea for her every morning, tidy up her clothes, drive her around etc. Once I said I feel like I make all the sacrifices in the relationship and she just smiled and said “Lets keep it that way”.

For context , I am quite polite and docile by nature, the kind of person who makes way for others and gets easily interrupted in a conversation. This might also have contributed to the disrespect, and I am working on it. 

I can’t help but feel she enjoys the abuse and takes full advantage of my polite and docile nature. Sometimes when we argue, I can feel the resentment in the voice, something that feels like ‘I can’t believe I married this loser’ 

Some one on  this sub said that love, trust and respect are the pillars of a relationship. Although I still love her and miss her when she’s not around, I definitely feel that the respect part is definitely gone. The trust part is slowly going away. I sometimes feel like just leaving her but I am not sure if I will find someone at this age(36), especially where I live. 

I don’t know what to do.

1. Protein shake (fairlife in the AM),  coffee w/sugar free creamer.

2. A few ounces of pulled chicken from a grocery store roaster (removing any skin or fat as I can around 10AM.  Blue berries or a few strawberries.

3.  Salad (w/shredded cheese and fat free Italian dressing (Carrots or a whole cucumber of I don't feel for or up to making a salad).  Might throw some more chicken on it or not. 1/2 piece of whole grain bread.

4. Mid afternoon snack - raw veggies, 1/2 banana, small orange or an apple

5.  Dinner - heavily modified from whatever my family is eating.  I generally skip all the carbs or limit.  So spaghetti is just the tomato and meat sauce, or eat the protein and skip the rice.  

If we get takeout, I get as much veggie as I can, keeping in mind to pass on the vegetarian choices that are too calorie dense.

If family is eating out and I don't like the choices, I will get water and eat something that's a better choice at home.

6.  Dessert - A couple of 100 calorie chocolate chip granola bars or small bowl of popcorn sometimes.  Gotta remember to eat my carbs or I turn grumpy.

I also try to eat a couple prunes at meals as this has helped me tremendously with my constipation.

  
Water, all day long

  
Went to a birthday dinner for a close friend last night. 

Went for the veggie option and disappointed the ""greek"" tacos were over filled with tons of hummus.  Ate 2/3 of a taco and gave the other one away. Skipped the snacks like chips, and passed on the birthday cake.  I don't drink alcohol for the same reason's I don't eat a lot of carbs, and honestly any desire for it went out the window when I started taking Zepbound

I feel i am in the minority being a male
I wanted to share my experience so far 

Started to get a slight pain in urethra and smelly urine about a year ago. The pain in urethra ONLY showed up during sex or masterbation. This continued to intensify. Coffee, alc, dehydration make symptoms worse but temporary. I also have a lot of flakes in urine that show up(especially first time in morning of dehydrated). If my men can relate, trying to have a strong stream and strong release of semen is weak-this is pelvic floor related 
I assume?

Fast forward to now  What really causes all my flares is masterbation and release of semen by any means. What follows is extreme pain in urethra, urgency and increased smell and symptoms for the next 3-5 days. But here's the thing- if I abstain from releasing semen my symptoms start to disappear after 7-10 days of no release, urine still smells and still dehydration/coffee etc can irritate it but pain goes down to 2-3 out of 10

Urinologist thought maybe prostatitis and havent done any more testing other then urine culture, uti, std all negative.

Given my symptoms and really most of it coming from semen release. Is there hope this could for my case being coming from pelvic floor dysfunction?  Or maybe I need to abstain like 30 days plus and ""heal"" that muscle

Thanks! I hope all find a solution and can tolerate this more as we go on this journey",2,1749904480.0,Interstitialcystitis,1,1.0,False

1lb7lod,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bengaluru/comments/1lb7lod/feeling_grateful_to_bengaluru_this_saturday/,Feeling grateful to Bengaluru this Saturday evening ❤️,"It’s a calm Saturday evening, 22°C in mid-June, and I just felt like saying thank you Bengaluru for the life you’ve given me.

I came here six years ago thinking it would just be another stop for work. But this city has given me so much more. A life partner, a career I’m proud of, amazing friends, and a way of living that somehow balances chaos and calm.

Like many of us in IT, I ended up learning all kinds of programming languages but never really found the time or energy to learn Kannada properly. Over the years though, my appreciation for the local culture has grown a lot. Some of my closest friends today are Kannadigas.

I can now manage to order food and coffee with lines like “yeradu coffee, swalpa sugar kadime” or “idli vangi kodi” at my favorite Udupi joints. I understand bits and pieces from delivery partners, and I chat with our cook every day for 10 to 15 minutes. She patiently helps me with Kannada grammar and makes fun of my pronunciation in the most endearing way.

Today I finally joined Kannada classes on Zoom for weekends. Not because of all the online chatter about North Indians not speaking Kannada, but because I’ve genuinely come to respect and appreciate this city and its people. Nanna hrudayadinda I want to make the effort.

I didn’t expect to fall in love with this city the way I have, but here I am, feeling more grounded and connected than I’ve ever been.

Cheers to namma Bengaluru ❤️

When I'm torn between choices, I like to do this visualization exercise. Close your eyes and imagine yourself going with one option. Picture every little detail—how it feels, what the outcomes are, everything. Now, do the same with the second choice. Which one made you feel more excited or seemed right in that gut kinda way? 

I know it sounds kinda woo-woo, but it helps to connect with your intuition when logic isn't enough. Plus, there's something calming about it, especially if you're fire-cracking all over the place from overwhelm (or maybe that's just me after three coffees, tbh).

I'm a PR consultant in an agency where we mainly do media relations, we’re 50. I've been there for almost five years now, and it's going very well. I've climbed the ranks (intern, junior consultant, consultant and now senior consultant) and I'm really enjoying it. I think I've become a good professional, my boss likes me, I'm now in a management position for the most junior consultants, leading missions under the distant gaze of the partners.

My next professional step is to be appointed manager.

For that to happen, I'd have to be able to bring in clients “on my own”. The last few promotions of managers have all followed this pattern: good professional, climbed the ladder, then brought in business, then appointed manager. The problem is that I don't have a network (or very Small one - some colleagues are very well-born and have a strong family network), and I'm relatively young (28) and have to spend most of my time on my clients, so I can't devote whole days to prospection.

Do you have any tips for finding and bringing in new clients? What do you think works?

Knowing that I'm already having coffees and lunches with young people who work in media relations at the client's, or startuppers, and that I sometimes try to send e-mails proactively.... I don’t think that is enough.

1lb7gc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1lb7gc4/i_built_a_free_dynamic_repeater_accordion_in/,"I built a FREE Dynamic Repeater Accordion in Elementor, that uses a native WP Custom Field JSON data (Works for Posts, Products, or any type of post basically!! No paid plugins needed!!)","X-post from r/elementor

I wanted to share this thing that I figured out... for creating a fully dynamic accordion in Elementor that pulls its content from a custom field (JSON) on each post, product, pages, or any custom post type. I needed it for a project.

With this:

* You can manage all your accordion content in a single custom field (as JSON).
* You can use different accordion content for different posts/products—no need to edit the widget every time - great for single product page, or single post page etc.
* Supports HTML in the content (lists, links, bold, etc.).
* You can use this for FAQs, product specs, features, travel itineraries or anything.. tested with woocommerce products.
* You don't need ACF or ACF Pro. or any other paid plugin for the matter.
* Save yourself from the annoying adding of title and content for each accordion item with a mouse.
* Still preserve Accordion styling done on the elementor widget.

How does it work?

* This PHP snippet needs to be installed using any code snippet plugin. (see Pastebin link at the end) this will automatically fill in the titles and content for each item, based on your JSON.
* Add a Accordion widget in Elementor Editor.
* In the Advanced tab of the widget, add a css class like `accordion-json-repeater-faq` (replace `faq` with your custom field key).
* In the content area of each accordion item, add a Text Editor widget with `#accordion-content` as the placeholder. (The title of the accordion item can be anything.. but the content has to be this.) VERBATIM
* Add your JSON to a custom field, with a key of your choice. (see sample json below).
* NOTE:: CREATE ENOUGH ACCORDION ITEMS in editor FOR ALL FUTURE Needs. There is no too many items.. because. only the amount of items in the json will show up on the actual site.. rest won't.. so make sure you duplicate the first accordion items multiple times.. 20, 30, 40 whatever you need + some.. just make sure it is more than the number of items in your JSON. each accordion item should have a text editor element with only ""#accordion-content"" written inside.. VERBATIM - without quotes!!

**If you haven't yet enabled the free native wordpress custom fields:**  
If you don’t see the custom fields box, just go to the post or product WP **edit page,** click “Screen Options” in the top right, and check “Custom Fields.” Now you can add your JSON field at the bottom of the page, using a field key of your choice.

*With rising geopolitical tensions and soaring demand for rare earth elements, the UK must invest in midstream critical mineral processing to reduce reliance on China and secure its defence, energy, and technology sectors, says Nitesh Shah*

I have over 30 years’ experience across commodities, mining and advanced materials –watching as the UK and the West first externalised their critical mineral supply chains to China – and then over the past few years rush to regain control of these essential assets

China dominates between 80 – 100 per cent of the rare earth elements (REEs) market. The US imports 74 per cent of its REEs from China, whilst the UK imports at lower levels – because we import more finished goods. These risks are set to be compounded as demand for REEs grows massively over the coming years – driven by the energy revolution, the move to advanced electronics and AI, and by defence requirements.

The war in Ukraine and the escalation of US-China trade tariffs have been the spotlights that have illuminated the need for Western independence from Russian and Chinese supply chains. Recent US – Chinese trade tensions resulted in April’s announcement by China of further export controls upon 7 REEs – including elements like scandium and its alloy aluminium scandium – which has unique application in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. These controls have been a shock to the critical materials supply chain – but a necessary one.

# Critical minerals are central to defence

The greatest threats beyond the semiconductors and electronics sectors are within defence. Across fighter jets, nuclear submarines, anti-drone defences, ballistics, advanced defence electronics – critical minerals are central – critical minerals from China. The UK has no domestic primary sources and an underinvested midstream. Currently everything must be imported, so this month’s Strategic Defence Review is welcomed in recommitting the UK government to its March pledge to establish UK Defence Innovation – and with £400 million – so scaling-up UK technologies which align with building-out UK critical mineral security.

The new UK critical minerals strategy being published this month – and the new industrial strategy also out this month, look to combine critical mineral demand with UK industries future requirements across sectors including advanced manufacturing, defence and clean energy. The previous government’s critical mineral strategy (2022) built a very basic framework but one too general and it missed the opportunity to utilise the resources and expertise of the UK – particularly midstream processing. Small-scale funding came later – £15m for the CLIMATES programme. Compare this with Canada, for example, which backed its own strategy with nearly $4bn in its 2022 budget. In the words of the founder of one the UK’s leading critical minerals mining operations, the UK’s strategy was “a wish list with no substance in terms of finance”.

The UK’s limitations mean we have to focus more acutely upon our advantages – we have few natural resources bar lithium, tin and tungsten – but we do have the City and the opportunity to lead in critical mineral financing, we have great human capital and fundamentally these recent critical mineral shocks should provide the impetus for UK Plc to orient itself around one of its key advantages – as a global midstream player.

Why is the midstream so important? Take magnets as the example: required in wind turbines, EVs and military aircraft. China controls over 70 per cent of the REEs required – but in terms of the processing of the material into usable metal for downstream applications, this figure rises to around 87-89 per cent. Although in recent years the UK and the US has seen extensive funding for new magnet production with greater mining and manufacturing occurring in the West, midstream processing is still within China. And this midstream risk applies to all REEs and many critical minerals.

**Companies like mine – based in South Yorkshire – an advanced materials midstream processor focussed on reducing oxides of critical minerals including REEs like aluminium scandium alloys – into critical material metal, alloy and high entropy alloy powders with partners and customers across the semiconductor, capacitor, hypersonics, space, defence and clean energy sectors – can at scale provide UK domestic midstream capacity that can radically derisk western critical material supply chains.**

**Given present geopolitics – our hopes are that the new critical minerals and industrial strategies will finally make midstream the centrepiece – and that funding will finally match ambition.**

Walking into France with a gluten-free diet feels like storming a wine cellar during prohibition. This country worships flour the way monks worship ancient texts. The crusty, golden baguette slung under every arm is not just food, it’s a national relic. Croissants glisten behind glass cases, flaky layers stacked with the arrogance of centuries. Pastry shops seduce tourists and locals alike with rows of tarts that gleam like polished jewels. France is bread. France is gluten. And yet, here you are, exiled by your own biology.

The first wave hits at breakfast. The hotel rolls out baskets of warm bread and buttery pastries, filling the air with an aroma that punches you straight in the gut. You scan the table like a criminal casing a bank vault. There’s fruit. Some yogurt. Maybe a slice of ham wrapped in wax paper, if you’re fortunate. But the bread sits there, mocking you with its perfect golden armor. Everyone else crunches through crust and sighs with carb-fueled bliss. You sip bitter coffee, pretending the emptiness in your stomach is intentional.

Lunch is no better. Sandwiches spill out from every café like edible sculpture. Jambon-beurre stuffed into fresh-baked batons, tartines loaded with cheese, quiches with flaky crusts holding molten centers of egg and cream. The streets are paved with gluten temptation, each bite daring you to roll the dice. The French waiter raises an eyebrow when you whisper “sans gluten.” His lips tighten. He shrugs with the casual cruelty of a man who has heard this nonsense before. The kitchen might have a salad. Maybe. Without croutons, without the crisp fried onions, without the warm wedge of baguette that usually completes the plate.

But deep within the flour-choked arteries of Paris, Lyon, Marseille and the sleepy villages between, a quiet revolution simmers. A new breed of baker has emerged, rogue operators who dare defy tradition. They wrestle with buckwheat, chestnut, cornmeal, and sorghum flour like alchemists. Their shops are small but their windows glow with gluten-free loaves that don’t crumble into sawdust. These are not the dry, lifeless bricks sold in sad supermarket aisles. These breads have crust. They have bounce. They have bite. You taste one and feel a flicker of hope that you are not cursed after all.

There are patisseries that now whisper secrets to the afflicted. Mille-feuille built from almond flour. Tarte citron resting on gluten-free shortbread that holds its form and sings with sharp lemon brightness. Macarons, those sweet Parisian pucks of almond meringue, stand as tiny beacons of mercy. Their chewy centers offer salvation amid the wheat-soaked carnage. A handful of bold chocolatiers craft confections without the treachery of flour fillers. You sink your teeth into ganache that coats your tongue like silk, unburdened by the weight of forbidden grains.

Dinner brings its own brand of theater. The bistro waiter approaches, menu in hand. You steel yourself and utter the code words. His face hardens, scanning you for weakness. This is France, where butter flows like blood and sauces are thickened with flour by default. Yet, with persistence, with repetition, with a few apologies from the kitchen, your plate arrives. Grilled fish glistening under a slick of olive oil, no flour in sight. Perfectly roasted duck breast resting in a pool of reduced red wine, thickened without the roux. Ratatouille stacked in colorful spirals, pure and untainted.

The key to survival in this land of gluten worship lies in old-world simplicity. The food of the countryside leans on vegetables, proteins, and sauces born of reduction and patience. The markets overflow with produce that begs for nothing more than salt and heat. Cheeses stand alone, needing no crusty vessel. Charcuterie spreads call you to the table with saucisson and pâté that defy the bread basket entirely.

Wine, of course, remains your ally. Glass after glass washes away the bitterness of lost baguettes, numbs the sting of bypassed croissants. The vineyards do not discriminate. You sip Chablis and Bordeaux, laughing at gluten’s impotence against fermented grapes.

By the end, you learn to navigate the minefield. You hunt for the niche bakeries, whisper secret codes to sympathetic chefs, and fill your days with roasted meats, ripe cheeses, and piles of glistening fruit. You do not starve. You adapt. And while the crusty baguette remains forbidden, you find satisfaction in every duck confit, every macaron, every perfect wheel of Camembert that lands on your plate. France may worship its wheat, but it doesn’t own your hunger.

I'm 44, an engineer, and single. I haven't had luck locally and it's tough. I'm very physically fit and somewhat muscular except for my face which shows age. I've done nothing but work for the last 20 years. I dress very well. I shave my head. I have a stable job and a history of relatively large work projects.

I love coffee, 80s and 90s music, and walking. I also enjoy reading.

I won't beat around the bush. I'm looking for a lady 35+ for a long distance relationship. Send a picture if this is something you can commit to. I'll send one in exchange. Please be 35+ years old so we are from the same generation. If things change in the future (distance wise), I'm open to moving in together. I have the means to travel. But I can only do so for two weeks a year. So you location is not an issue for me.

Also, for both of us, it is best if you are GMT-1 to GMT+8, otherwise it might be difficult.

Please only send a message if you are single and interested in the same thing. Also make sure you are able to hold a conversation since that is a main criteria.",1,1749903498.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1lb7cw3,https://i.redd.it/jkn0cldixv6f1.jpeg,Bee movie script (P1),"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Coming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
Barry?
Adam?
Can you believe this is happening?
I can't.
I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
You got lint on your fuzz.
Ow! That's me!
Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
Bye!
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Hey, Adam.
Hey, Barry.
Is that fuzz gel?
A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school, three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
You did come back different.
Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Hear about Frankie?
Yeah.
You going to the funeral?
No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
Well, Adam, today we are men.
We are!
Bee-men.
Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Will we pick our job today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
Wonder what it'll be like?
A little scary.
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
That girl was hot.
She's my cousin!
She is?
Yes, we're all cousins.
Right. You're right.
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
What do you think he makes?
Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
What does that do?
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Why would you question anything? We're bees.
We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Check it out.
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like outside The Hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
Hey, Jocks!
Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
I wonder where they were.
I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
Couple of Hive Harrys.
Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
Oh, my!
I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
Six miles, huh?
Barry!
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
Maybe I am.
You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
Dad, you surprised me.
You decide what you're interested in?
Well, there's a lot of choices.
But you only get one.
Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
You're gonna be a stirrer?
No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!
I'm so proud.
We're starting work today!
Today's the day.
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Yeah, right.
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
Is it still available?
Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Congratulations!
Step to the side.
What'd you get?
Picking crud out. Stellar!
Wow!
Couple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Make your choice.
You want to go first?
No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
Any chance of getting the Krelman?
Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
Barry!
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
What happened to you?
Where are you?
I'm going out.
Out? Out where?
Out there.
Oh, no!
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
Look at that.
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
Thank you.
OK.
You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
That's awful.
And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
 All right, launch positions!
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
Black and yellow!
Hello!
You ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
Wind, check.
Antennae, check.
Nectar pack, check.
Wings, check.
Stinger, check.
Scared out of my shorts, check.
OK, ladies,
let's move it out!
Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
All of you, drain those flowers!
Wow! I'm out!
I can't believe I'm out!
So blue.
I feel so fast and free!
Box kite!
Wow!
Flowers!
This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
Roses!
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.
That is one nectar collector!
Ever see pollination up close?
No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Cool.
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?
Copy that visual.
Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
Affirmative.
That was on the line!
This is the coolest. What is it?
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.
Yeah, fuzzy.
Chemical-y.
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
My sweet lord of bees!
Candy-brain, get off there!
Problem!
Guys!
This could be bad.
Affirmative.
Very close.
Gonna hurt.
Mama's little boy.
You are way out of position, rookie!
Coming in at you like a missile!
Help me!
I don't think these are flowers.
Should we tell him?
I think he knows.
What is this?!
Match point!
You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!
Yowser!
Gross.
There's a bee in the car!
Do something!
I'm driving!
Hi, bee.
He's back here!
He's going to sting me!
Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
He blinked!
Spray him, Granny!
What are you doing?!
Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
I gotta get home.
Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
Ken, could you close the window please?
Ken, could you close the window please?
Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
What was that?
Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!
That is diabolical.
It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
What's number one? Star Wars?
Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
Wait! Stop! Bee!
Stand back. These are winter boots.
Wait!
Don't kill him!
You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
Why does his life have less value than yours?
Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
My brochure!
There you go, little guy.
I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.
 Put that on your resume brochure.
My whole face could puff up.
Make it one of your special skills.
Knocking someone out is also a special skill.
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
You could put carob chips on there.
Bye.
Supposed to be less calories.
Bye.
I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.
All right, here it goes.
Nah.
What would I say?
I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.
How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good.
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
Hi!
I'm sorry. You're talking.
Yes, I know.
You're talking!
I'm so sorry.
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.
Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.
This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!
I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.
And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.
That was a little weird. I'm talking with a bee.
Yeah.
I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.
Wait! How did you learn to do that?
What?
The talking thing.
Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.
That's very funny.
Yeah.
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
Anyway... Can I... get you something?
Like what?
I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?
I don't want to put you out.
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
It's just coffee.
I hate to impose.
Don't be ridiculous!
Actually, I would love a cup.
Hey, you want rum cake?
I shouldn't.
Have some.
No, I can't.
Come on!
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
Where?
These stripes don't help.
You look great!
I don't know if you know anything about fashion.
Are you all right?
No.
He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.
He finally gets there.
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.
And he says, ""Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.
Why would I marry a watermelon?""
Is that a bee joke?
That's the kind of stuff we do.
Yeah, different.
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
About work? I don't know.
I want to do my part for The Hive, but I can't do it the way they want.
I know how you feel.
You do?
Sure.
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
Really?
My only interest is flowers.
Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.
Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it?
You're in Sheep Meadow!
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.
Why do girls put rings on their toes?
Why not?
It's like putting a hat on your knee.
Maybe I'll try that.
You all right, ma'am?
Oh, yeah. Fine.
Just having two cups of coffee!
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.
Yeah, it's no trouble.
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.
Are you...?
Can I take a piece of this with me?
Sure! Here, have a crumb.
Thanks!
Yeah.
All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not.
OK, Barry.
And thank you so much again... for before.
Oh, that? That was nothing.
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
This can't possibly work.
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.
OK, Dave, pull the chute.
Sounds amazing.
It was amazing!
It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.
Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.
Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
Some of them. But some of them don't.
How'd you get back?
Poodle.
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.
You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.
Well...
Well?
Well, I met someone.
You did? Was she Bee-ish?
A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
No, no, no, not a wasp.
Spider?
I'm not attracted to spiders.
I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face.
So who is she?
She's... human.
No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.
Her name's Vanessa.
Oh, boy.
She's so nice. And she's a florist!
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
We're not dating.
You're flying outside The Hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!
She saved my life! And she understands me.
This is over!
Eat this.
This is not over! What was that?
They call it a crumb.

A few years ago, I worked for a company that had a new manager who was obsessed with ""optics."" One of her first big rules was banning all outside food or drinks at our desks, no snacks, no coffee, no water bottles. She said it looked “unprofessional.”

Now, I had a medical condition that required me to eat small, frequent meals throughout the day. I explained this and even got a note from my doctor, but she didn’t care. “If you need to eat,” she said, “use the break room.”

Fine.

So I did exactly that.

Every time I needed a sip of water? Break room.

Mid-morning banana? Break room.

My 3PM protein bar? Break room.

I spent about 45 minutes a day just walking back and forth and sitting in the break room for “meals.”

When she tried to reprimand me for lost productivity, I politely reminded her that she told me to go to the break room for every snack and sip. HR backed me up. Suddenly, her rule got ""relaxed"" for people with “special dietary needs.” But not before I got a week’s worth of long, leisurely snack breaks.",2932,1749903392.0,MaliciousCompliance,70,0.96,False

# 1. See AI as your Super-Assistant

The guide shows how to off-load three work killers: repetitive grunt work, skill bottlenecks, and “where-do-I-start?” ambiguity, so you spend more time on strategy.

👉 For eCommerce, that means less time writing 100 product descriptions and more time launching campaigns that convert.

# 2. A One-Page Framework to Spot Easy Wins

Almost every real-world use case slots into one of these categories: Content Creation, Research, Data Analysis, Ideation & Strategy, Automation, and (if you feel brave) Coding. Use the list to brainstorm where AI can help your own workflow.

Think: seasonal promo planning, upsell email flows, product copy A/B testing, customer support automation, mapped in one glance.

# 3. Proof That First Drafts Save Real Hours

Promega chopped 135 hours off email production in six months by letting ChatGPT crank out first drafts, then polishing in-house. You can replicate that tomorrow.

👉 One eCommerce brand used ChatGPT to generate descriptions for 2,000 SKUs, reducing content creation time by 70%. That’s your catalog launched weeks faster.

# 4. A Two-Axis Prioritization Map

The Impact-vs-Effort matrix helps you rank ideas, nail “high-ROI focus” projects, and shelve the shiny but time-sucking ones.

That's nothing new."" But then I went to give an example and I couldn't really come up with one beyond segments found within *The Poughkeepsie Tapes* or the *V/H/S* movies. An entire movie dedicated to the first-person perspective of a killer is pretty rare (and *August Underground* doesn't count because it's barely a movie).

So this is fairly unique.

But maybe there's a reason this isn't done too often. Let's look.

[Looky-Loo (2025)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27227397/) summary:

>An aspiring filmmaker stalks women with his camera. His crimes escalate from voyeurism to murder as he becomes obsessed with a woman named Courtney, making her the star of his deranged film.

Our silent cameraman is looking for his muse. Buildings. Some dandelions. The sky. Hmm.

But then he sees a couple walk by and decides to follow them. They go into an apartment building and he tries the door. Locked.

Soon he's following other people, looking in their windows, and eventually going door to door, checking under welcome mats and hide-a-keys. Eventually he graduates to entering people's homes and going through their things, watching them from the closet.

Everything changes when he's accidentally discovered, and kills his stalking victim. This doesn't immediately lead to his planning to murder, but it clearly plays on his mind enough that he decides to do it again.

So we watch him stalk young fit women who all seemingly have cats. I think the cat thing is a coincidence. But anyway, he has a type, and he starts committing a series of murders using a variety of methods.

One interesting thing about it though is he seems completely uninterested in their deaths most of the time. Once he knows they're dying from a slit throat or some other method, he typically busies himself with grabbing a coffee or washing his hands while waiting for them to finish dying. It takes awhile to find the method that will be just right, that will make the perfect film subject for murder.

Some blood, no gore, lots and lots and lots of stalking, and a bit of voyeurism.

**Should you watch it?** This is why I don't rate movies out of 10. It's not about whether it's good or bad (it's well done), it's about if you're the kind of person who would be into it.

It's that kind of horror where you're dreading the inevitable, like watching a car crash in slow motion. It's legitimately horrifying, and effective on that level without being crass or exploitative. It'll make you want to draw your curtains shut and double check your locks. And for goodness sakes don't leave a key under the mat...

But I can see a certain type of viewer not really finding themselves affected here. It's a measure of empathy - and if you don't really have that for these women, then this just amounts to a way to pass the time for you.

Basically I'm saying you'll be horrified by it unless you're a sicko. Yeah that's right, gauntlet thrown. I dare you to leave a comment saying how bored you were you sick bastard. You go to hell. You go to hell and you die.

So ya pretty good movie.

# Chapter 1

After losing his memory, Asteria City’s golden boy started relentlessly pursuing me.

I had played Evan’s girlfriend for three years, only to realize I had fallen for him for real.

Just when I was about to tell him I was pregnant, I overheard the senior who used to bully me say to him:

“Evan, thank you for pretending to lose your memory to get back at Cynthia for me. You’ve pranked her ninety-nine times.”

“Once we hit a hundred, I’ll officially date you.”

Only then did I realize Sophia was the one Evan truly loved but could never have—his unreachable dream.

And I was nothing more than a clown he used to win her favor.

Later, I died in a plane crash.

Evan went insane, digging through the wreckage like a madman, but all he found was a ring with an engraving inside: \[100th prank. I bet you love me.\]

It was said that he cried until he passed out and was rushed to the hospital.

When he woke up, he turned against everyone who had helped prank me.

Meanwhile, I smiled as I burned my medical records in the snow in France.

He had faked amnesia to trick me into falling in love. I’d fake my death to teach him a lesson.

…

Just a wall away.

Sophia’s voice carried a playful lilt. “Evan, we just cleared prank number 96!”

Evan’s voice came back, laced with unfamiliar sarcasm. “Sophia, do you actually find this fun?”

“I was doing it for you! Cynthia stole your national scholarship and that game design competition champion.”

One of Evan’s friends shouted, “Once you hit a hundred pranks, Evan can finally make your relationship public!”

My blood ran cold.

“Gotta say, Evan really knew how to play tricks. That amnesia idea was genius.”

“Remember the first time? Had her looking for that bracelet in the pouring rain, then gave it to Sophia instead. Remember her face?”

My nails dug into my palms.

That bracelet was a gift from my mother on her deathbed. Evan claimed he lost it when he moved.

That day, I searched for it in the storm for seven hours and ended up with a 104-degree fever.

“The best one was on her thesis defense day! Evan told her he got beaten up in a bar.”

His friend burst into laughter. “She ran to the bar and found out it was all a lie. The way she cried and begged her professor—I filmed the whole thing.”

I bit my lip so hard I tasted blood.

I had abandoned a thesis I’d worked on for six months to find him, and ended up delaying my graduation.

Sophia chuckled. “And that time we used the game designs she had worked for three nights! She was on her knees picking them up all night, like a stray dog.”

Evan laughed on cue. “So, what’s the plan this time?”

“Let’s say Evan’s in the hospital and tell her to rush over. Then we’ll go party and leave her waiting!”

My phone buzzed immediately. A message from Evan: \[City Hospital ER. Come quickly.\]

Afraid someone would notice, I slipped away.

But two minutes later, Evan deleted the message—like he regretted sending it.

I pretended I had never seen it and didn’t reply.

To be honest, I had seen this coming long ago.

One time while Evan was in the shower, I accidentally found a locked video album on his phone titled “Game Progress.”

There were ninety-six clips—exactly the number of pranks I’d endured.

The password was Sophia’s birthday: 1224.

He had told me it was the day we met.

Last Christmas Eve, I had waited for him in the snow for three hours.

He spent that night at the Wells family villa, placing a birthday crown on Sophia’s head. He didn’t come until after midnight.

That night, Evan had carefully wrapped a scarf around my neck, as if he cherished me deeply.

A dull ache filled my chest. I opened Instagram.

Pinned at the top was his chat with Sophia. Every day, he updated her on the prank progress in meticulous detail: \[Told her I had to work late today. Took you to Disneyland instead. She waited until 3 a.m.\]

\[Told her the wrong competition time—two hours late. She ran over in pajamas. Hilarious.\]

The last message was from the night of our class reunion.

When Sophia “accidentally” spilled boiling coffee on me, Evan instinctively shielded me.

But in the chat, he wrote: \[Can’t stand touching her. Sprayed disinfectant three times.\]

# Chapter 2

I called my father and told him I wanted to move to Paris with him.

After my mother passed away five years ago, he had been living in the city where they fell in love, keeping her company for the rest of his life.

But I had stayed behind for Evan, rejecting study abroad offers and spending the entire year apart from my father.

I used to believe that if I warmed Evan’s icy heart, spring would come.

But I had forgotten that once ice melts, all that’s left is bone-chilling cold.

I had thrown myself into a fire for love, only to find out I was a pawn in a prank—and worse, the clown he used to chase his precious Sophia.

When I spoke, my father was overjoyed. “My darling girl, you’ve finally come to your senses!”

I held back tears and gave a soft “yes.”

“Dad, when I leave... help me fake a plane crash.”

He didn’t understand, but still agreed.

The plane crash would be my final gift to Evan.

I wanted the name Cynthia to haunt him for a lifetime.

I deleted all the photos of us on my phone. While packing, a leather journal slipped out of Evan’s safe box.

The dark green cover was embossed with the eagle totem from Oath of the Skyborn—a game logo I had designed over thirty-six sleepless nights.

Evan had printed it on the cover, and inside were all my design sketches from over the years. He had collected them meticulously, wishing me success in my dreams.

On page seven, I stopped cold.

Next to a photo of me typing away in glasses was a sticky note: \[Today she yelled at the planner like a bristling kitten. Her revision made it ten times better. How can someone be this adorably brilliant?\]

So every time I stayed up drawing, Evan had been right there—massaging my shoulders, making me lasagna.

Just for a single comment, he’d run out in the middle of the night to get me cake. During my period, he always had chocolates and painkillers ready.

They called it a love prank game, but clearly, he had fallen into it too.

The last page held a plane ticket stub from last year’s Valentine’s Day. His bold handwriting filled the blank space: \[If I had to choose again, I’d still pretend to lose the ticket and trick her into spending the night at the airport reworking the project. Because that was the 72nd prank I promised Sophia.\]

Rain pounded against the window.

All that affection had been built on lies. Maybe he did love me, but he loved Sophia more. I was nothing but a target for his cruelty.

Hands trembling, I pulled out my phone and booked an abortion.

That night, I lay in bed and pretended to sleep as Evan returned, the chill of the night air clinging to him.

He didn’t move for a while. I wondered—was he pausing because I hadn’t played along this time and embarrassed him in front of Sophia and the others? And now he was just letting it go?

The mattress sank behind me. Strong arms wrapped around my waist.

Evan rested his head against my neck like a tired bird returning to its nest. His warm breath carried a trace of excitement.

“We’re having a baby, Little Moon.”

Little Moon. His nickname for me.

He used to say I was like the moon in the sky, shining only for him. It even matched my name.

But I knew behind my back, he told Sophia and the others I was a fake goody-two-shoes. That “Little Moon” was just a lie he made up to fool me—just for fun.

Just to see me fall for him and lose everything.

I stayed silent. He had no idea I had already chosen not to keep the child.

Evan didn’t notice anything strange. He pulled out my pregnancy results and drew three little hearts on the paper with a fountain pen.

The same pen I had bought him with my first paycheck. He had carried it with him all these years.

I gave no response. Evan hugged me tighter, whispering sweet words in my ear.

But my heart felt frozen—like it had been locked in the dead of winter.

“I’m tired. Let’s sleep.”

He obediently quieted down, whispering only, “Tomorrow we’re going to Sophia’s birthday party,” before falling asleep.

I, on the other hand, stayed awake all night.

Evan had staged a fake amnesia and cost me three years of love.

So I would stage a fake death and make him regret it for the rest of his life.

# Chapter 3

At Evan’s birthday party, his brothers surrounded me in the private room and pushed the largest slice of cake toward me.

“Cynthia, Evan said he loves watching you eat sweets the most.”

Evan averted his gaze, pretending not to hear.

The moment the cake entered my mouth, a bitter taste suddenly rose in my throat, followed by a wave of nausea.

But before I could react, Sophia pressed down on me and forced the unfinished cake back into my mouth. “Cynthia, it’s my birthday today. Don’t embarrass me, okay? I totally thought you were trolling me for a second!”

A sharp, unbearable pain twisted in my lower abdomen.

Evan’s brothers burst into laughter, teasing and mocking me like I was some kind of party trick.

By the time I finished the slice, I rushed to the restroom and vomited until the world spun. From the room behind me came a round of satisfied laughter—the prank had worked.

“Still not over your stomach bug?” Evan handed me a glass of warm water with mint leaves steeping in it—an old remedy he had once taught me for nausea when we first met.

But I couldn’t bring myself to respond to his feigned concern. The stabbing pain in my abdomen was relentless, sharp and unyielding like needles pricking me from the inside.

When I looked down, blood was already streaming down my legs. It was shocking and terrifying.

I grabbed Evan’s arm. “Take me to the hospital…”

Sophia stepped in front of the door with a sweet smile. “It’s just irregular period. Happens to girls all the time. Don’t overreact, Evan.”

“Move!” Evan snapped, his voice loud and angry.

It was the first time he had ever gone against Sophia.

When I came to, I heard Sophia whining outside the exam room, scolding Evan’s brothers.

“You gave her too much of the hallucinogen, didn’t you? I thought the whole point was just to humiliate her in public.”

One of the brothers chuckled. “Getting rid of a bastard child? That’s a bonus. Evan should be thanking me.”

“Exactly. It’s been three years. If she had a kid, Evan couldn’t just dump Cynthia and walk away.”

Evan stayed quiet for a long time before he finally said, “A prank is one thing, but don’t hurt her body.”

Sophia was taken aback, but then glared at him and demanded, “Wasn’t it you who said, ‘Let that nerd feel what it’s like to fall from top,’ and agreed to help me get revenge?”

“Making Cynthia look like a fool at my party—that was your idea, remember? What now? Have you fallen for her?”

The next second, Evan hurried to deny it like it burned him. “Of course not! I love you.”

And once again, the hallway outside the door erupted with laughter and applause.

They celebrated the successful 98th prank and started planning the 99th.

I touched my flat belly, which still ached faintly.

To them, me and my baby were just part of a cruel joke—a birthday gift for Sophia.

I wiped away my tears and, with trembling fingers, canceled the abortion. I didn’t need to make the decision anymore. The baby’s father had already sentenced her to death.

Just as I was about to call my father, Evan walked in. I shut my eyes and pretended to be asleep.

He stood beside me, his voice hoarse with guilt. “Cynthia, I’m sorry…”

And the reason? It couldn’t have been more obvious.

After I recovered and was discharged from the hospital, Evan told me that his brothers and Sophia wanted to apologize and had invited me on a hike in the outskirts of the city.

There was a church there, where we could light a candle and pray for our lost child.

I knew it might be another cruel trick, but just the thought of our baby stirred something tender and aching inside me.

This would be my last chance before I left for France. I told myself it could be a final goodbye.

The whole way there, they surrounded Sophia, laughing and joking, falling over themselves to please her, while treating me as if I didn’t exist.

In front of the holy statue, Evan bought a candle, wanting to light it in memory of my child.

Sophia stood beside him, smiling sweetly. “Cynthia, you really are such a good mother.”

I ignored her sickening hypocrisy.

There weren’t many empty spaces left on the candle rack, so I climbed the long staircase to the statue to place the flame.

Just as I reached the top, someone gave me a violent shove from behind.

“Ah—!”

I was caught completely off guard. I tumbled backward down the steep stone steps. Pain shot through every inch of my body, sharp and merciless, ripping through flesh and bone until it felt like my insides were being crushed.

My leg was badly injured—I could barely move. Everything went black as I slipped into unconsciousness.

Half-lucid, I felt Evan lifting me into his arms. His eyes were red with panic.

“My little moon, don’t be scared. I’m taking you to the hospital.”

“Why…” I murmured, tears clouding my vision, “Why would they do this to me?”

The pain wasn’t just in my body. It felt like my heart had shattered into pieces.

Evan’s voice trembled with guilt and fear. “I didn’t know they’d do this. I swear, I didn’t know…”

And then, the world faded, and I sank into darkness.",1,1749903228.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
