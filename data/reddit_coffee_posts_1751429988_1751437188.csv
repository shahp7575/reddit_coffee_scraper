1lpokzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusFinance/comments/1lpokzz/serious_question_what_would_you_do_career_wise_in/,Serious question. What would you do career wise in my situation?,"32 years old. Have only ever worked hospitality. Waiting, cheffing, barista. No friends outside of work, have literally never had a girlfriend. I work and then smoke weed until I fall asleep, have been like this for over a decade now.

I’m open to studying as I have afternoons and nights free (start work at 4:30-5am). I don’t mind being on call 24/7 or people messaging me on my days off with work related queries. I have no life, so working during my off time is no hassle for me.

I’m not entirely stupid, but clearly no one gets to their 30s and still works an abusive, minimum wage job if you’re smart. Given that I’ve gotten to this point with no relationships outside of family and work, I’m looking for advice on what I could do that earns good money and I can throw myself into 100%.

I’ve worked back to back 18 hours shifts as a chef for over a week where I slept on broken down cardboard boxes in the storeroom and washed my uniform in the dishwasher, using deodorant as a shower as it wasn’t worth going home. I’m a hard worker. I just want to fill the void of not work… with work… but hospo just isn’t it. I can’t buy a house or enjoy nice things on this wage and I’m getting too old. 

I also would fucking love a job/career in air conditioning, where you can actually sit, have an actual break (I have never in my working history ever had a half hour break, we would try and eat when it was quiet by shoving food into our mouths as quickly as possible between customers/orders). It blows my mind seeing people in the city during working hours just out and about for a coffee. Fucking wild. 

I want that. I just don’t know how to get there",1,1751437166.0,AusFinance,1,1.0,False
1lpokzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/1lpokzb/help_blueberry_leaves_brown_spots/,"Help, blueberry leaves brown spots","Hi, so I'm pretty new to the entire blueberry thing (I got mine off of a friend a few months back in winter) and I can't find anything online on what I did wrong 😅 

I have a Reka blueberry in a pot inside, with rhododendron/blueberry soil from the beginning on. A week ago I also mixed in some coffee grounds because the leaves were/are really light with darker veins and according to what I found that means the soil Ph value was wrong. 
I water it roughly 3-4 times a week (the top layer of the soil is dry when I water it, but a few cm deeper is still moist), and it's never standing in direct sunlight. Temperature should vary between 25-35°C (which I know is a little too warm, but I don't have a cooler place in the apartment). 
Some of its leaves started turning brown and dying off and on most of the green leaves there's these tiny brown spots (see pictures) and I couldn't find anything online. Anyone know what that is and what to do about it?

Tldr: my blueberry plant has tiny brown spots and its leaves are dying, anyone know what that is? ",1,1751437164.0,gardening,0,1.0,False

1lpok4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1lpok4y/ive_got_a_stoop_kid_situation_going_on_except_its/,I’ve got a “Stoop Kid” situation going on. Except it’s a grown-ass suicidal man.,"There’s this guy who sits outside my apartment building, and every time I leave, he yells my name and tries to talk to me. Doesn’t matter if I’ve got headphones in, if I’m on the phone, or clearly keeping to myself walking my two dogs. He always comes up to me. And I’m a total introvert. Its a lot. 

The dude doesn’t even really live here. He started showing up at his aunt and uncle’s (one-bedroom apartment, by the way) back in January, but he’s been staying there ever since. He’s an alcoholic and constantly says crap like, “I’m drunk as hell. Where you going!?” In February, I watched paramedics drag out his blue, overdosed body after he tried to kill himself with prescription pills. Ever since then, he’s just been here. And it seems like he’s never going to leave. He sits outside all day, chain-smoking and drinking. He doesn’t drive. He only walks one block to 7-Eleven to re-up.

I gave him a folding chair since his broke, and a copy of my favorite book. I probably shouldn’t have done either of those things. He took it as an open invitation. I was just trying to be a kind. But it’s like living with a homeless person camped out front. He told me he idolizes Chester Bennington for killing himself, along with other rockstars who did the same. Says he’s not disabled, but proceeded to show me his bank account with disability checks he gets twice a month. (I repeatedly said, “Dude, you don’t have to show me your bank account,” and he shoved his phone screen in front of my face.) Then he started telling other neighbors he was getting coffee with me, and they texted me asking if I actually was. Obviously, I wasn’t. Lol.

It’s a pit of depression. And I know he’s got a shit-ton of problems. But like, please leave me alone. No offense. Every time I leave, it feels like I have to walk through a fog of someone else’s rock bottom. I get it. It’s just I want privacy at my own home and a little peace of mind. It’s really affecting my livelihood. I hate going outside now.

Literally every time I take my dogs out to pee, he yells my name and tries to start a conversation. I’ve tried being polite. I’ve tried ignoring him. He doesn’t take the hint. And now it’s seriously driving me crazy. I dread leaving my apartment. And I have to a lot for my 7-month-old pup, who’s still learning to pee in the grass. I just want to exist in my space without this constant emotional drain.

To make it worse, another neighbor guilt-tripped me for not talking to him, like I’m heartless for needing space. I’m not trying to be cruel. I just can’t carry this dude’s weight. I didn’t ask for it.

I don’t want to escalate things unless I absolutely have to. I just want him to stop. Any advice?

1lpoivd,https://www.reddit.com/r/hatemyjob/comments/1lpoivd/my_work_is_draining_me_out/,My work is draining me out.,"Being a janitor is not good. Even if it's a part time. You clean the masses people have made and it's so distubing when I have to grab garbages with my own hands. I wear gloves but, I bought it for myself. They didn't buy it for me.

It's not the job you can learn something worth and the amounts of dedication to it is not worth it neither. I had to report the issue about coffee machine's malfunction then, the boss kinda put the blame on me. I was so infuriated by his usual behavior. When something happens beyond my abilities, it has to do with my fault. 

Anyway, I hate my job and I hate myself how incapable person I am because this job is the only work I can do. I didn't want to be like this. This job is not what I wanted to do. It doesn't even pay me good.
I know it sounds whining but, I wasn't supposed to work longer like 4 years. I had other plans and it's gone.

 I have depression and it makes me really hard to wake up but I go to work everyday. I saw therapist months ago and I told her about this. She was surprised because when depression is severe, you gvie up everything. Work, eating, shower, waking up etc.  My life gets bad everyday and there's nothong I could do. 

I even get off work lately. I spend 30 and 40 munites more in there, sometimes it's + 1 hour. They just add more and more works then I waste more time to clean the masses. It feels like I'm shaming myself by going there everyday.",1,1751436936.0,hatemyjob,0,1.0,False

1lpohy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lpohy6/the_dark_prophecy_by_rick_riordan/,The Dark Prophecy by Rick Riordan:,"Gods, I hate my life  
  
  WHEN OUR DRAGON declared war on Indiana, I knew it was going to be a bad day.  
  
  We’d been traveling west for six weeks, and Festus had never shown such hostility toward a state. New Jersey he ignored. Pennsylvania he seemed to enjoy, despite our battle with the Cyclopes of Pittsburgh. Ohio he tolerated, even after our encounter with Potina, the Roman goddess of childhood drinks, who pursued us in the form of a giant red pitcher emblazoned with a smiley face.  
  
  Yet for some reason, Festus decided he did not like Indiana. He landed on the cupola of the Indiana Statehouse, flapped his metallic wings, and blew a cone of fire that incinerated the state flag right off the flagpole.  
  
  “Whoa, buddy!” Leo Valdez pulled the dragon’s reins. “We’ve talked about this. No blowtorching public monuments!”  
  
  Behind him on the dragon’s spine, Calypso gripped Festus’s scales for balance. “Could we please get to the ground? Gently this time?”  
  
  For a formerly immortal sorceress who once controlled air spirits, Calypso was not a fan of flying. Cold wind blew her chestnut hair into my face, making me blink and spit.  
  
  That’s right, dear reader.  
  
  I, the most important passenger, the youth who had once been the glorious god Apollo, was forced to sit in the back of the dragon. Oh, the indignities I had suffered since Zeus stripped me of my divine powers! It wasn’t enough that I was now a sixteen-year-old mortal with the ghastly alias Lester Papadopoulos. It wasn’t enough that I had to toil upon the earth doing (ugh) heroic quests until I could find a way back into my father’s good graces, or that I had a case of acne which simply would not respond to over-the-counter zit medicine. Despite my New York State junior driver’s license, Leo Valdez didn’t trust me to operate his aerial bronze steed!  
  
  Festus’s claws scrabbled for a hold on the green copper dome, which was much too small for a dragon his size. I had a flashback to the time I installed a life-size statue of the muse Calliope on my sun chariot and the extra weight of the hood ornament made me nosedive into China and create the Gobi Desert.  
  
  Leo glanced back, his face streaked with soot. “Apollo, you sense anything?”  
  
  “Why is it my job to sense things? Just because I used to be a god of prophecy—”  
  
  “You’re the one who’s been having visions,” Calypso reminded me. “You said your friend Meg would be here.”  
  
  Just hearing Meg’s name gave me a twinge of pain. “That doesn’t mean I can pinpoint her location with my mind! Zeus has revoked my access to GPS!”  
  
  “GPS?” Calypso asked.  
  
  “Godly positioning systems.”  
  
  “That’s not a real thing!”  
  
  “Guys, cool it.” Leo patted the dragon’s neck. “Apollo, just try, will you? Does this look like the city you dreamed about or not?”  
  
  I scanned the horizon.  
  
  Indiana was flat country—highways crisscrossing scrubby brown plains, shadows of winter clouds floating above urban sprawl. Around us rose a meager cluster of downtown high-rises—stacks of stone and glass like layered wedges of black and white licorice. (Not the yummy kind of licorice, either; the nasty variety that sits for eons in your stepmother’s candy bowl on the coffee table. And, no, Hera, why would I be talking about you?)  
  
  After falling to earth in New York City, I found Indianapolis desolate and uninspiring, as if one proper New York neighborhood—Midtown, perhaps—had been stretched out to encompass the entire area of Manhattan, then relieved of two-thirds of its population and vigorously power-washed.  
  
  I could think of no reason why an evil triumvirate of ancient Roman emperors would take interest in such a location. Nor could I imagine why Meg McCaffrey would be sent here to capture me. Yet my visions had been clear. I had seen this skyline. I had heard my old enemy Nero give orders to Meg: Go west. Capture Apollo before he can find the next Oracle. If you cannot bring him to me alive, kill him.  
  
  The truly sad thing about this? Meg was one of my better friends. She also happened to be my demigod master, thanks to Zeus’s twisted sense of humor. As long as I remained mortal, Meg could order me to do anything, even kill myself….No. Better not to think of such possibilities.  
  
  I shifted in my metal seat. After so many weeks of travel, I was tired and saddle sore. I wanted to find a safe place to rest. This was not such a city. Something about the landscape below made me as restless as Festus.  
  
  Alas, I was sure this was where we were meant to be. Despite the danger, if I had a chance of seeing Meg McCaffrey again, of prying her away from her villainous stepfather’s grasp, I had to try.  
  
  “This is the spot,” I said. “Before this dome collapses under us, I suggest we get to the ground.”  
  
  Calypso grumbled in ancient Minoan, “I already said that.”  
  
  “Well, excuse me, sorceress!” I replied in the same language. “Perhaps if you had helpful visions, I’d listen to you more often!”  
  
  Calypso called me a few names that reminded me how colorful the Minoan language had been before it went extinct.  
  
  “Hey, you two,” Leo said. “No ancient dialects. Spanish or English, please. Or Machine.”  
  
  Festus creaked in agreement.  
  
  “It’s okay, boy,” Leo said. “I’m sure they didn’t mean to exclude us. Now let’s fly down to street level, huh?”  
  
  Festus’s ruby eyes glowed. His metal teeth spun like drill bits. I imagined him thinking, Illinois is sounding pretty good right about now.  
  
  But he flapped his wings and leaped from the dome. We hurtled downward, landing in front of the statehouse with enough force to crack the sidewalk. My eyeballs jiggled like water balloons.  
  
  Festus whipped his head from side to side, steam curling from his nostrils.  
  
  I saw no immediate threats. Cars drove leisurely down West Washington Street. Pedestrians strolled by: a middle-aged woman in a flowery dress, a heavyset policeman carrying a paper coffee cup labeled CAFÉ PATACHOU, a clean-cut man in a blue seersucker suit.  
  
  The man in blue waved politely as he passed. “Morning.”  
  
  “’Sup, dude,” Leo called.  
  
  Calypso tilted her head. “Why was he so friendly? Does he not see that we’re sitting atop a fifty-ton metal dragon?”  
  
  Leo grinned. “It’s the Mist, babe—messes with mortal eyes. Makes monsters look like stray dogs. Makes swords look like umbrellas. Makes me look even more handsome than usual!”  
  
  Calypso jabbed her thumbs into Leo’s kidneys.  
  
  “Ow!” he complained.  
  
  “I know what the Mist is, Leonidas—”  
  
  “Hey, I told you never to call me that.”  
  
  “—but the Mist must be very strong here if it can hide a monster of Festus’s size at such close range. Apollo, don’t you find that a little odd?”  
  
  I studied the passing pedestrians.  
  
  True, I had seen places where the Mist was particularly heavy. At Troy, the sky above the battlefield had been so thick with gods you couldn’t turn your chariot without running into another deity, yet the Trojans and Greeks saw only hints of our presence. At Three Mile Island in 1979, the mortals somehow failed to realize that their partial nuclear meltdown was caused by an epic chainsaw fight between Ares and Hephaestus. (As I recall, Hephaestus had insulted Ares’s bell-bottom jeans.)  
  
  Still, I did not think heavy Mist was the problem here. Something about these locals bothered me. Their faces were too placid. Their dazed smiles reminded me of ancient Athenians just before the Dionysus Festival—everyone in a good mood, distracted, thinking about the drunken riots and debauchery to come.  
  
  “We should get out of the public e  
ye,” I suggested. “Perhaps—”  
  
  Festus stumbled, shaking like a wet dog. From inside his chest came a noise like a loose bicycle chain.  
  
  “Aw, not again,” Leo said. “Everybody off!”  
  
  Calypso and I quickly dismounted.  
  
  Leo ran in front of Festus and held out his arms in a classic dragon-wrangler’s stance. “Hey, buddy, it’s fine! I’m just going to switch you off for a while, okay? A little downtime to—”  
  
  Festus projectile-vomited a column of flames that engulfed Leo. Fortunately, Valdez was fireproof. His clothes were not. From what Leo had told me, he could generally prevent his outfits from burning up simply by concentrating. If he were caught by surprise, however, it didn’t always work.  
  
  When the flames dissipated, Leo stood before us wearing nothing but his asbestos boxer shorts, his magical tool belt, and a pair of smoking, partially melted sneakers.  
  
  “Dang it!” he complained. “Festus, it’s cold out here!”  
  
  The dragon stumbled. Leo lunged and flipped the lever behind the dragon’s left foreleg. Festus began to collapse. His wings, limbs, neck, and tail contracted into his body, his bronze plates overlapping and folding inward. In a matter of seconds, our robotic friend had been reduced to a large bronze suitcase.  
  
  That should have been physically impossible, of course, but like any decent god, demigod, or engineer, Leo Valdez refused to be stopped by the laws of physics.  
  
  He scowled at his new piece of luggage. “Man…I thought I fixed his gyro-capacitor. Guess we’re stuck here until I can find a machine shop.”  
  
  Calypso grimaced. Her pink ski jacket glistened with condensation from our flight through the clouds. “And if we find such a shop, how long will it take to repair Festus?”  
  
  Leo shrugged. “Twelve hours? Fifteen?” He pushed a button on the side of the suitcase. A handle popped up. “Also, if we see a men’s clothing store, that might be good.”  
  
  I imagined walking into a T.J. Maxx, Leo in boxer shorts and melted sneakers, rolling a bronze suitcase behind him. I did not relish the idea.  
  
  Then, from the direction of the sidewalk, a voice called, “Hello!”  
  
  The woman in the flowery dress had returned. At least she looked like the same woman. Either that or lots of ladies in Indianapolis wore purple-and-yellow honeysuckle-pattern dresses and had 1950s bouffant hairstyles.  
  
  She smiled vacantly. “Beautiful morning!”  
  
  It was in fact a miserable morning—cold and cloudy with a smell of impending snow—but I felt it would be rude to ignore her completely.  
  
  I gave her a little parade wave—the sort of gesture I used to give my worshippers when they came to grovel at my altar. To me, the message was clear enough: I see you, puny mortal; now run along. The gods are talking.  
  
  The woman did not take the hint. She strolled forward and planted herself in front of us. She wasn’t particularly large, but something about her proportions seemed off. Her shoulders were too wide for her head. Her chest and belly protruded in a lumpy mass, as if she’d stuffed a sack of mangos down the front of her dress. With her spindly arms and legs, she reminded me of some sort of giant beetle. If she ever tipped over, I doubted she could easily get back up.  
  
  “Oh, my!” She gripped her purse with both hands. “Aren’t you children cute!”  
  
  Her lipstick and eye shadow were both a violent shade of purple. I wondered if she was getting enough oxygen to her brain.  
  
  “Madam,” I said, “we are not children.” I could have added that I was over four thousand years old, and Calypso was even older, but I decided not to get into that. “Now, if you’ll excuse us, we have a suitcase to repair and my friend is in dire need of a pair of pants.”  
  
  I tried to step around her. She blocked my path.  
  
  “You can’t go yet, dear! We haven’t welcomed you to Indiana!” From her purse, she drew a smartphone. The screen glowed as if a call were already in progress.  
  
  “It’s him, all right,” she said into the phone. “Everybody, come on over. Apollo is here!”  
  
  My lungs shriveled in my chest.  
  
  In the old days, I would have expected to be recognized as soon as I arrived in a town. Of course the locals would rush to welcome me. They would sing and dance and throw flowers. They would immediately begin constructing a new temple.  
  
  But as Lester Papadopoulos, I did not warrant such treatment. I looked nothing like my former glorious self. The idea that the Indianans might recognize me despite my tangled hair, acne, and flab was both insulting and terrifying. What if they erected a statue of me in my present form—a giant golden Lester in the center of their city? The other gods would never let me hear the end of it!  
  
  “Madam,” I said, “I’m afraid you have mistaken me—”  
  
  “Don’t be modest!” The woman tossed her phone and purse aside. She grabbed my forearm with the strength of a weightlifter. “Our master will be delighted to have you in custody. And please call me Nanette.”  
  
  Calypso charged. Either she wished to defend me (unlikely), or she was not a fan of the name Nanette. She punched the woman in the face.  
  
  This by itself did not surprise me. Having lost her immortal powers, Calypso was in the process of trying to master other skills. So far, she’d failed at swords, polearms, shurikens, whips, and improvisational comedy. (I sympathized with her frustration.) Today, she’d decided to try fisticuffs.  
  
  What surprised me was the loud CRACK her fist made against Nanette’s face—the sound of finger bones breaking.  
  
  “Ow!” Calypso stumbled away, clutching her hand.  
  
  Nanette’s head slid backward. She released me to try to grab her own face, but it was too late. Her head toppled off her shoulders. It clanged against the pavement and rolled sideways, the eyes still blinking, the purple lips twitching. Its base was smooth stainless steel. Attached to it were ragged strips of duct tape stuck with hair and bobby pins.  
  
  “Holy Hephaestus!” Leo ran to Calypso’s side. “Lady, you broke my girlfriend’s hand with your face. What are you, an automaton?”  
  
  “No, dear,” said decapitated Nanette. Her muffled voice didn’t come from the stainless-steel head on the sidewalk. It emanated from somewhere inside her dress. Just above her collar, where her neck used to be, an outcropping of fine blond hair was tangled with bobby pins. “And I must say, hitting me wasn’t very polite.”  
  
  Belatedly, I realized the metal head had been a disguise. Just as satyrs covered their hooves with human shoes, this creature passed for mortal by pretending to have a human face. Its voice came from its gut area, which meant…  
  
  My knees trembled.  
  
  “A blemmyae,” I said.  
  
  Nanette chuckled. Her bulging midsection writhed under the honeysuckle cloth. She ripped open her blouse—something a polite Midwesterner would never think of doing—and revealed her true face.  
  
  Where a woman’s brassiere would have been, two enormous bulging eyes blinked at me. From her sternum protruded a large shiny nose. Across her abdomen curled a hideous mouth—glistening orange lips, teeth like a spread of blank white playing cards.  
  
  “Yes, dear,” the face said. “And I’m arresting you in the name of the Triumvirate!”  
  
  Up and down Washington Street, pleasant-looking pedestrians turned and began marching in our direction.  
  
  Headless guys and gals  
  
  Not loving the Midwest vibe  
  
  Oh, look—a cheese ghost  
  
  GEE, APOLLO, you may be thinking, why didn’t you simply pull out your bow and shoot her? Or charm her with a song from your combat ukulele?  
  
  True, I had both those items slung across my back along with my quiver. Sadly, even the best demigod weapons require something called maintenance. My children Kayla and Austin had explained this to me before I left Camp Half-Blood. I couldn’t just pull my bow and quiver out of thin air as I used to when I was a god. I could no longer wish my ukulele into my hands and expect it to be perfectly in tune.  
  
  My weapons and my musical instrument were carefully wrapped in blankets. Otherwis  
e flying through the wet winter skies would’ve warped the bow, ruined the arrows, and played Hades with the strings of my ukulele. To get them out now would require several minutes that I did not have.  
  
  Also, I doubted they would do me much good against blemmyae.  
  
  I hadn’t dealt with their kind since the time of Julius Caesar, and I would’ve been happy to go another two thousand years without seeing one.  
  
  How could a god of poetry and music be effective against a species whose ears were wedged under their armpits? Nor did the blemmyae fear or respect archery. They were sturdy melee fighters with thick skin. They were even resistant to most forms of disease, which meant they never called on me for medical help nor feared my plague arrows. Worst of all, they were humorless and unimaginative. They had no interest in the future, so they saw no use for Oracles or prophecies.  
  
  In short, you could not create a race less sympathetic to an attractive, multitalented god like me. (And believe me, Ares had tried. Those eighteenth-century Hessian mercenaries he cooked up? Ugh. George Washington and I had the worst time with them.)  
  
  “Leo,” I said, “activate the dragon.”  
  
  “I just put him into sleep cycle.”  
  
  “Hurry!”  
  
  Leo fumbled with the suitcase’s buttons. Nothing happened. “I told you, man. Even if Festus weren’t malfunctioning, he’s really hard to wake up once he’s asleep.”  
  
  Wonderful, I thought. Calypso hunched over her broken hand, muttering Minoan obscenities. Leo shivered in his underwear. And I…well, I was Lester. On top of all that, instead of facing our enemies with a large fire-breathing automaton, we would now have to face them with a barely portable piece of metal luggage.  
  
  I wheeled on the blemmyae. “BEGONE, foul Nanette!” I tried to muster my old godly wrath voice. “Lay hands upon my divine person again and you shall be DESTROYED!”  
  
  Back when I was a god, that threat would have been enough to make entire armies wet their camouflage pants. Nanette just blinked her cow-brown eyes.  
  
  “Don’t fuss, now,” she said. Her lips were grotesquely hypnotic, like watching a surgical incision being used as a puppet. “Besides, dearie, you’re not a god anymore.”  
  
  Why did people have to keep reminding me of that?  
  
  More locals converged on our position. Two police officers trotted down the steps of the statehouse. At the corner of Senate Avenue, a trio of sanitation workers abandoned their garbage truck and lumbered over wielding large metal trash cans. From the other direction, a half dozen men in business suits tromped across the capitol lawn.  
  
  Leo cursed. “Is everybody in this town a metalhead? And I don’t mean the good kind of metalhead.”  
  
  “Relax, sweetie,” Nanette said. “Surrender and we won’t have to hurt you much. That’s the emperor’s job!”  
  
  Despite her broken hand, Calypso apparently didn’t feel like surrendering. With a defiant yell she charged Nanette again, this time launching a karate kick toward the blemmyae’s giant nose.  
  
  “Don’t!” I blurted out, too late.  
  
  As I mentioned, blemmyae are sturdy beings. They’re difficult to hurt and even more difficult to kill. Calypso’s foot connected with its target, and her ankle bent with a nasty pop. She collapsed, gurgling in pain.  
  
  “Cal!” Leo ran to her side. “Back off, chest-face!”  
  
  “Language, dear,” Nanette chided. “Now I’m afraid I’ll have to stomp on you.”  
  
  She raised one patent leather pump, but Leo was faster. He summoned a globe of fire and threw it like a baseball, hitting Nanette right between her huge chest-level eyes. Flames washed over her, setting her eyebrows and flowery dress ablaze.  
  
  As Nanette screamed and stumbled, Leo yelled, “Apollo, help me!”  
  
  I realized I’d been standing there, frozen in shock—which would’ve been fine if I’d been watching the scene unfold from the safety of my throne on Mount Olympus. Alas, I was very much down here in the trenches with the lesser beings. I helped get Calypso to her feet (her one good foot, at least). We slung her arms over our shoulders (with lots of screaming from Calypso when I accidentally grabbed her broken hand) and began hobbling away.  
  
  Thirty feet across the lawn, Leo suddenly stopped. “I forgot Festus!”  
  
  “Leave him,” I snapped.  
  
  “What?”

We can’t manage him and Calypso! We’ll come back later. The blemmyae might just ignore him.”  
  
  “But if they figure out how to open him,” Leo fretted, “if they hurt him—”  
  
  “MARRRGGGGH!” Behind us, Nanette ripped off the shreds of her burning dress. From the waist down, shaggy blond fur covered her body, not unlike a satyr. Her eyebrows smoldered, but otherwise her face looked unhurt. She spat ashes from her mouth and glared in our direction. “That was not nice! GET THEM!”  
  
  The businessmen were almost on top of us, eliminating any hope that we could make it back to Festus without getting caught.  
  
  We chose the only heroic option available: we ran.  
  
  I hadn’t felt so encumbered since my three-legged death race with Meg McCaffrey back at Camp Half-Blood. Calypso tried to help, kicking along like a pogo stick between Leo and me, but whenever she jostled her broken foot or hand, she yelped and sagged against us.  
  
  “S-sorry, guys,” she muttered, her face beaded with sweat. “Guess I’m not meant to be a melee fighter.”  
  
  “Neither am I,” I admitted. “Perhaps Leo can hold them off while—”  
  
  “Hey, don’t look at me,” Leo grumbled. “I’m just a repair guy who can throw the occasional fireball. Our fighter is stuck back there in suitcase mode.”  
  
  “Hobble faster,” I suggested.  
  
  We reached the street alive only because the blemmyae moved so slowly. I suppose I would, too, if I were balancing a fake metal head on my, er, head, but even without their disguises, the blemmyae were not as swift as they were strong. Their terrible depth perception made them walk with exaggerated caution, as if the ground were a multilayered hologram. If only we could out-hobble them…  
  
  “Good morning!” A police officer appeared on our right, his firearm drawn. “Halt or I will shoot! Thank you!”  
  
  Leo pulled a stoppered glass bottle from his tool belt. He tossed it at the officer’s feet and green flames exploded around him. The officer dropped his gun. He began tearing off his burning uniform, revealing a chest-face with shaggy pectoral eyebrows and a belly beard in need of a shave.  
  
  “Phew,” Leo said. “I was hoping he was a blemmyae. That was my only vial of Greek fire, guys. And I can’t keep summoning fireballs unless I want to pass out, so—”  
  
  “We need to find cover,” said Calypso.  
  
  Sensible advice, but cover did not seem to be an Indiana concept. The streets were wide and straight, the landscape flat, the crowds sparse, the sight lines endless.  
  
  We turned onto South Capitol. I glanced over my shoulder and saw the mob of smiling fake-headed locals gaining on us. A construction worker stopped to rip the fender off a Ford pickup, then rejoined the parade, his new chrome club slung over his shoulder.  
  
  Meanwhile, the regular mortals—at least, those who did not seem interested in killing us at the moment—went about their business, making phone calls, waiting at traffic lights, sipping coffee in nearby cafés, completely ignoring us. At one corner, sitting on a milk crate, a heavily blanketed homeless man asked me for change. I resisted the urge to tell him that change was coming up fast behind us, carrying assorted weapons.  
  
  My heart pounded. My legs shook. I hated having a mortal body. I experienced so many bothersome things, like fear, cold, nausea, and the impulse to whimper Please don’t kill me! If only Calypso hadn’t broken her ankle we might have moved faster, but we couldn’t very well leave her behind. Not that I particularly liked Calypso, mind you, but I’d already convinced Leo to abandon his dragon. I didn’t want to push my luck.  
  
  “There!” said the sorceress. She pointed with her chin to what looked like a service alley behind a hotel.  
  
  I shuddered, remembering my first day in New York as Lester Papadopoulos. “What if it’s a dead end? The last time I found myself in a dead-end alley, things did not go well.”  
  
  “Let’s try,” Leo said. “We might be able to hide in there, or…I dunno.”  
  
  I dunno sounded like a sketchy plan B, but I had nothing better to offer.  
  
  Good news: the alley was not a dead end. I could clearly see an exit at the far end of the block. Bad news: the loading bays along the back of the hotel were locked, giving us nowhere to hide, and the opposite wall of the alley was lined with Dumpsters. Oh, Dumpsters! How I hated them!  
  
  Leo sighed. “I guess we could jump in—”  
  
  “No!” I snapped. “Never again!”  
  
  We struggled through the alley as fast as we could. I tried to calm my nerves by silently composing a sonnet about various ways a wrathful god could destroy Dumpsters. I became so engrossed I didn’t notice what was in front of us until Calypso gasped.  
  
  Leo halted. “What the—? Hijo.”  
  
  The apparition glowed with a faint ginger light. He wore a traditional chiton, sandals, and a sheathed sword, like a Greek warrior in the prime of life…except for the fact that he had been decapitated. Unlike the blemmyae, however, this person obviously had once been human. Ethereal blood trickled from his severed neck, splattering his luminous orange tunic.  
  
  “It’s a cheese-colored ghost,” Leo said.  
  
  The spirit raised one hand, beckoning us forward.  
  
  Not being born a mortal, I had no particular fear of the dead. You’ve seen one tormented soul, you’ve seen them all. But something about this ghost unsettled me. He stirred a distant memory, a feeling of guilt from thousands of years ago….  
  
  Behind us, the voices of the blemmyae grew louder. I heard them calling out “Morning!” and “Excuse me!” and “Lovely day!” to their fellow Indianans.  
  
  “What do we do?” Calypso asked.  
  
  “Follow the ghost,” I said.  
  
  “What?” Leo yelped.  
  
  “We follow the cheese-colored ghost. As you’re always saying: Vaya con queso.”  
  
  “That was a joke, ese.”  
  
  The orange spirit beckoned again, then floated toward the end of the alley.  
  
  Behind us, a man’s voice shouted, “There you are! Lovely weather, isn’t it?”  
  
  I turned in time to see a truck fender spiraling toward us.  
  
  “Down!” I tackled Calypso and Leo, provoking more screams of agony from the sorceress. The truck fender sailed over our heads and slammed into a Dumpster, sending up a festive explosion of garbage confetti.  
  
  We struggled to our feet. Calypso was shivering, no longer complaining about the pain. I was fairly sure she was going into shock.  
  
  Leo pulled a staple gun from his tool belt. “You guys go ahead. I’ll hold them off as long as I can.”  
  
  “What are you going to do?” I demanded. “Sort and collate them?”  
  
  “I’m going to throw things at them!” Leo snapped. “Unless you’ve got a better idea?”  
  
  “B-both of you stop,” Calypso stammered. “We d-don’t leave anyone behind. Now walk. Left, right, left, right.”  
  
  We emerged from the alley into a wide-open circular plaza. Oh, why couldn’t Indianans build a proper city with narrow, twisting streets, plenty of dark corners, and perhaps some conveniently placed bombproof bunkers?  
  
  In the middle of a ring-shaped drive stood a fountain surrounded by dormant flower beds. To the north rose the twin towers of another hotel. To the south loomed an older, grander building of redbrick and granite—perhaps a Victorian-era train station. On one side of the edifice, a clock tower soared roughly two hundred feet into the sky. Above the main entrance, under a marble archway, a colossal rose window gleamed in a frame of green copper, like a stained-glass version of the dartboard we used for our weekly game night on Mount Olympus.  
  
  That thought made me heartsick with nostalgia. I would’ve given anything to be back home for game night, even if it meant listening to Athena gloat about her Scrabble scores.  
  
  I scanned the plaza. Our ghostly guide seemed to have disappeared.  
  
  Why had he brought us here? Should we try the hotel? The train station?  
  
  Those questions became moot when the blemmyae surrounded us.  
  
  The mob burst out of the alley behind us. A  
police car swerved into the roundabout next to the train station. A bulldozer pulled into the hotel’s driveway, the operator waving and calling out cheerfully, “Hello! I’m going to bulldoze you!”  
  
  All exits from the plaza were quickly blocked.  
  
  A line of sweat freeze-dried against my neck. An annoying whine filled my ears, which I realized was my own subvocalized whimpering of Please don’t kill me, please don’t kill me.  
  
  I won’t die here, I promised myself. I’m much too important to bite it in Indiana.  
  
  But my trembling legs and chattering teeth seemed to disagree.  
  
  “Who has an idea?” I asked my compatriots. “Please, any brilliant idea.”  
  
  Calypso looked like her most brilliant idea at the moment was trying not to throw up. Leo hefted his staple gun, which didn’t seem to frighten the blemmyae.  
  
  From the midst of the mob, our old friend Nanette emerged, her chest-face grinning. Her patent leather pumps clashed terribly with her blond leg fur. “Gosh darn it, dears, you’ve made me a bit miffed.”  
  
  She grabbed the nearest street sign and single-handedly ripped it out of the ground. “Now, please hold still, won’t you? I’m just going to smash your heads with this.”  
  
  My last performance  
  
  Some old lady drops the mic  
  
  And kills everyone  
  
  I WAS ABOUT TO INITIATE Defense Plan Omega—falling to my knees and begging for mercy—when Leo saved me from that embarrassment.  
  
  “Bulldozer,” he whispered.  
  
  “Is that a code word?” I asked.  
  
  “No. I’m going to sneak over to the bulldozer. You two distract the metalheads.”  
  
  He shifted Calypso’s weight to me.  
  
  “Are you crazy?” she hissed.  
  
  Leo shot her an urgent look, like Trust me! Distract them!  
  
  Then he took a careful step sideways.  
  
  “Oh!” Nanette beamed. “Are you volunteering to die first, short demigod? You did hit me with fire, so that makes sense.”  
  
  Whatever Leo had in mind, I imagined his plan would fail if he began arguing with Nanette about his height. (Leo was a bit sensitive about being called short.) Fortunately, I have a natural talent for focusing everyone’s attention on me.  
  
  “I volunteer for death!” I shouted.  
  
  The entire mob turned to look at me. I silently cursed my choice of words. I should have volunteered for something easier, like baking a pie or post-execution clean-up duty.  
  
  I often speak without the benefit of forethought. Usually it works out. Sometimes it leads to improvisational masterpieces, like the Renaissance or the Beat movement. I had to hope this would be one of those times.  
  
  “But first,” I said, “hear my plea, O, merciful blemmyae!”  
  
  The policeman whom Leo had torched lowered his gun. A few green embers of Greek fire still smoldered in his belly beard. “What do you mean, hear my plea?”  
  
  “Well,” I said, “it’s customary to hear the last words of a dying man…or god or demigod or…what would you consider yourself, Calypso? A Titan? A demi-Titan?”  
  
  Calypso cleared her throat with a noise that sounded suspiciously like idiot. “What Apollo is trying to say, O, merciful blemmyae, is that etiquette demands you grant us a few last words before you kill us. I’m sure you wouldn’t want to be impolite.”  
  
  The blemmyae looked aghast. They lost their pleasant smiles and shook their mechanical heads. Nanette shuffled forward, her hands raised in a placating manner. “No, indeed! We are very polite.”  
  
  “Extremely polite,” the policeman agreed.  
  
  “Thank you,” said Nanette.  
  
  “You’re welcome,” said the policeman.  
  
  “Listen, then!” I cried. “Friends, frenemies, blemmyae…open your armpits and hear my sad tale!”  
  
  Leo shuffled back another step, his hands in the pockets of his tool belt. Another fifty-seven, fifty-eight steps, and he would arrive at the bulldozer. Fantastic.  
  
  “I am Apollo!” I began. “Formerly a god! I fell from Olympus, cast down by Zeus, unfairly blamed for starting a war with the giants!”  
  
  “I’m going to be sick,” Calypso muttered. “Let me sit down.”  
  
  “You’re breaking my rhythm.”  
  
  “You’re breaking my eardrums. Let me sit!”  
  
  I eased Calypso onto the fountain’s retaining wall.  
  
  Nanette raised her street sign. “Is that it? May I kill you now?”  
  
  “No, no!” I said. “I am just, ah, letting Calypso sit so…so she can act as my chorus. A good Greek performance always needs a chorus.”  
  
  Calypso’s hand looked like a crushed eggplant. Her ankle had swollen around the top of her sneaker. I didn’t see how she could stay conscious, much less act as a chorus, but she took a shaky breath and nodded. “Ready.”  
  
  “Lo!” I said. “I arrived at Camp Half-Blood as Lester Papadopoulos!”  
  
  “A pathetic mortal!” Calypso chorused. “Most worthless of teens!”  
  
  I glared at her, but I didn’t dare stop my performance again. “I overcame many challenges with my companion, Meg McCaffrey!”  
  
  “He means his master!” Calypso added. “A twelve-year-old girl! Behold her pathetic slave, Lester, most worthless of teens!”  
  
  The policeman huffed impatiently. “We know all this. The emperor told us.”  
  
  “Shh,” said Nanette. “Be polite.”  
  
  I put my hand over my heart. “We secured the Grove of Dodona, an ancient Oracle, and thwarted the plans of Nero! But alas, Meg McCaffrey fled from me. Her evil stepfather had poisoned her mind!”  
  
  “Poison!” Calypso cried. “Like the breath of Lester Papadopoulos, most worthless of teens!”  
  
  I resisted the urge to push Calypso into the flower bed.  
  
  Meanwhile, Leo was making his way toward the bulldozer under the guise of an interpretive dance routine, spinning and gasping and pantomiming my words. He looked like a hallucinating ballerina in boxer shorts, but the blemmyae politely got out of his way.  
  
  “Lo!” I shouted. “From the Oracle of Dodona we received a prophecy—a limerick most terrible!”  
  
  “Terrible!” Calypso chorused. “Like the skills of Lester, most worthless of teens.”  
  
  “Vary your adjectives,” I grumbled, then continued for my audience: “We traveled west in search of another Oracle, along the way fighting many fearsome foes! The Cyclopes we brought low!”  
  
  Leo jumped onto the running board of the bulldozer. He raised his staple gun dramatically, then stapled the bulldozer operator twice in the pectorals—right where his actual eyes would be. That could not have felt good—even for a tough species such as the blemmyae. The operator screamed and grabbed his chest. Leo kicked him out of the driver’s seat.  
  
  The police officer yelled, “Hey!”  
  
  “Wait!” I implored them. “Our friend is only giving you a dramatic interpretation of how we beat the Cyclopes. That’s totally allowed while telling a story!”  
  
  The crowd shifted uncertainly.  
  
  “These are very long last words,” Nanette complained. “When will I get to smash your head in?”  
  
  “Soon,” I promised. “Now, as I was saying…we traveled west!”  
  
  I hauled Calypso to her feet again with much whimpering on her part (and a little bit on mine).  
  
  “What are you doing?” she muttered.  
  
  “Work with me,” I said. “Lo, frenemies! Behold how we traveled!”  
  
  The two of us staggered toward the bulldozer. Leo’s hands flew over the controls. The engine roared to life.  
  
  “This isn’t a story!” the police officer protested. “They’re getting away!”  
  
  “No, not at all!” I pushed Calypso onto the bulldozer and climbed up after her. “You see, we traveled for many weeks like this….”  
  
  Leo started backing up. Beep. Beep. Beep. The bulldozer’s shovel began to rise.  
  
  “Imagine you are Camp Half-Blood,” I shouted to the crowd, “and we are traveling away from you.”  
  
  I realized my mistake. I had asked the blemmyae to imagine. Th  
ey simply weren’t capable of that.  
  
  “Stop them!” The police officer raised his gun. His first shot ricocheted off the dozer’s metal scoop.  
  
  “Listen, my friends!” I implored. “Open your armpits!”  
  
  But we had exhausted their politeness. A trash can sailed over our heads. A businessman picked up a decorative stone urn from the corner of the fountain and tossed it in our direction, annihilating the hotel’s front window.  
  
  “Faster!” I told Leo.  
  
  “Trying, man,” he muttered. “This thing wasn’t built for speed.”  
  
  The blemmyae closed in.  
  
  “Look out!” Calypso yelled.  
  
  Leo swerved just in time to deflect a wrought-iron bench off our dozer blade. Unfortunately, that opened us up to a different attack. Nanette threw her street sign like a harpoon. The metal pole pierced the bulldozer’s chassis in a burst of steam and grease, and our getaway ride shuddered to a halt.  
  
  “Great,” Calypso said. “Now what?”  
  
  This would have been an excellent time for my godly strength to return. I could have waded into battle, tossing my enemies aside like rag dolls. Instead, my bones seemed to liquefy and pool in my shoes. My hands shook so badly I doubted I could unwrap my bow even if I tried. Oh, that my glorious life should end this way—crushed by polite headless people in the American Midwest!  
  
  Nanette leaped onto the hood of our bulldozer, giving me a ghastly view straight up her nostrils. Leo tried to blast her with flames, but this time Nanette was prepared. She opened her mouth and swallowed the fireball, showing no sign of distress except for a small burp.  
  
  “Don’t feel too bad, dears,” she told us. “You never would have gained access to the blue cave. The emperor has it too well guarded! A shame you have to die, though. The naming celebration is in three days, and you and the girl were supposed to be the main attractions in his slave procession!”  
  
  I was too terrified to fully process her words. The girl…Did she mean Meg? Otherwise I heard only blue—die—slave, which at the moment seemed an accurate summary of my existence.  
  
  I knew it was hopeless, but I slipped my bow from my shoulder and began to unwrap it. Suddenly an arrow sprouted between Nanette’s eyes. She went cross-eyed trying to see it, then tumbled backward and crumbled to dust.  
  
  I stared at my blanketed weapon. I was a fast archer, yes. But I was fairly sure I hadn’t fired that shot.  
  
  A shrill whistle caught my attention. In the middle of the plaza, standing atop the fountain, a woman crouched in faded jeans and a silvery winter coat. A white birch bow gleamed in her hand. On her back, a quiver bristled with arrows. My heart leaped, thinking that my sister Artemis had come to help me at last! But no…this woman was at least sixty years old, her gray hair tied back in a bun. Artemis would never appear in such a form.  
  
  For reasons she had never shared with me, Artemis had an aversion to looking any older than, say, twenty. I’d told her countless times that beauty was ageless. All the Olympian fashion magazines will tell you that four thousand is the new one thousand, but she simply wouldn’t listen.  
  
  The gray-haired woman shouted, “Hit the pavement!”  
  
  All around the plaza, manhole-size circles appeared in the asphalt. Each one scissored open like the iris of a camera and turrets sprang up—mechanical crossbows swiveling and sweeping red targeting lasers in every direction.  
  
  The blemmyae didn’t try to take cover. Perhaps they didn’t understand. Perhaps they were waiting for the gray-haired woman to say please.

1lpogty,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lpogty/the_hidden_oracle_by_rick_riordan/,The Hidden Oracle by Rick Riordan:,"  MY NAME IS APOLLO. I used to be a god.  
  
  In my four thousand six hundred and twelve years, I have done many things. I inflicted a plague on the Greeks who besieged Troy. I blessed Babe Ruth with three home runs in game four of the 1926 World Series. I visited my wrath upon Britney Spears at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards.  
  
  But in all my immortal life, I never before crash-landed in a Dumpster.  
  
  I’m not even sure how it happened.  
  
  I simply woke up falling. Skyscrapers spiraled in and out of view. Flames streamed off my body. I tried to fly. I tried to change into a cloud or teleport across the world or do a hundred other things that should have been easy for me, but I just kept falling. I plunged into a narrow canyon between two buildings and BAM!  
  
  Is anything sadder than the sound of a god hitting a pile of garbage bags?  
  
  I lay groaning and aching in the open Dumpster. My nostrils burned with the stench of rancid bologna and used diapers. My ribs felt broken, though that shouldn’t have been possible.  
  
  My mind stewed in confusion, but one memory floated to the surface—the voice of my father, Zeus: YOUR FAULT. YOUR PUNISHMENT.  
  
  I realized what had happened to me. And I sobbed in despair.  
  
  Even for a god of poetry such as myself, it is difficult to describe how I felt. How could you—a mere mortal—possibly understand? Imagine being stripped of your clothes, then blasted with a fire hose in front of a laughing crowd. Imagine the ice-cold water filling your mouth and lungs, the pressure bruising your skin, turning your joints to putty. Imagine feeling helpless, ashamed, completely vulnerable—publicly and brutally stripped of everything that makes you you. My humiliation was worse than that.  
  
  YOUR FAULT, Zeus’s voice rang in my head.  
  
  “No!” I cried miserably. “No, it wasn’t! Please!”  
  
  Nobody answered. On either side of me, rusty fire escapes zigzagged up brick walls. Above, the winter sky was gray and unforgiving.  
  
  I tried to remember the details of my sentencing. Had my father told me how long this punishment would last? What was I supposed to do to regain his favor?  
  
  My memory was too fuzzy. I could barely recall what Zeus looked like, much less why he’d decided to toss me to earth. There’d been a war with the giants, I thought. The gods had been caught off guard, embarrassed, almost defeated.  
  
  The only thing I knew for certain: my punishment was unfair. Zeus needed someone to blame, so of course he’d picked the handsomest, most talented, most popular god in the pantheon: me.  
  
  I lay in the garbage, staring at the label inside the Dumpster lid: FOR PICK-UP, CALL 1-555-STENCHY.  
  
  Zeus will reconsider, I told myself. He’s just trying to scare me. Any moment, he will yank me back to Olympus and let me off with a warning.  
  
  “Yes…” My voice sounded hollow and desperate. “Yes, that’s it.”  
  
  I tried to move. I wanted to be on my feet when Zeus came to apologize. My ribs throbbed. My stomach clenched. I clawed the rim of the Dumpster and managed to drag myself over the side. I toppled out and landed on my shoulder, which made a cracking sound against the asphalt.  
  
  “Araggeeddeee,” I whimpered through the pain. “Stand up. Stand up.”  
  
  Getting to my feet was not easy. My head spun. I almost passed out from the effort. I stood in a dead-end alley. About fifty feet away, the only exit opened onto a street with grimy storefronts for a bail bondsman’s office and a pawnshop. I was somewhere on the west side of Manhattan, I guessed, or perhaps Crown Heights, in Brooklyn. Zeus must have been really angry with me.  
  
  I inspected my new body. I appeared to be a teenaged Caucasian male, clad in sneakers, blue jeans, and a green polo shirt. How utterly drab. I felt sick, weak, and so, so human.  
  
  I will never understand how you mortals tolerate it. You live your entire life trapped in a sack of meat, unable to enjoy simple pleasures like changing into a hummingbird or dissolving into pure light.  
  
  And now, heavens help me, I was one of you—just another meat sack.  
  
  I fumbled through my pants pockets, hoping I still had the keys to my sun chariot. No such luck. I found a cheap nylon wallet containing a hundred dollars in American currency—lunch money for my first day as a mortal, perhaps—along with a New York State junior driver’s license featuring a photo of a dorky, curly-haired teen who could not possibly be me, with the name Lester Papadopoulos. The cruelty of Zeus knew no bounds!  
  
  I peered into the Dumpster, hoping my bow, quiver, and lyre might have fallen to earth with me. I would have settled for my harmonica. There was nothing.  
  
  I took a deep breath. Cheer up, I told myself. I must have retained some of my godly abilities. Matters could be worse.  
  
  A raspy voice called, “Hey, Cade, take a look at this loser.”  
  
  Blocking the alley’s exit were two young men: one squat and platinum blond, the other tall and redheaded. Both wore oversize hoodies and baggy pants. Serpentine tattoo designs covered their necks. All they were missing were the words I’M A THUG printed in large letters across their foreheads.  
  
  The redhead zeroed in on the wallet in my hand. “Now, be nice, Mikey. This guy looks friendly enough.” He grinned and pulled a hunting knife from his belt. “In fact, I bet he wants to give us all his money.”  
  
  I blame my disorientation for what happened next.  
  
  I knew my immortality had been stripped away, but I still considered myself the mighty Apollo! One cannot change one’s way of thinking as easily as one might, say, turn into a snow leopard.  
  
  Also, on previous occasions when Zeus had punished me by making me mortal (yes, it had happened twice before), I had retained massive strength and at least some of my godly powers. I assumed the same would be true now.  
  
  I was not going to allow two young mortal ruffians to take Lester Papadopoulos’s wallet.  
  
  I stood up straight, hoping Cade and Mikey would be intimidated by my regal bearing and divine beauty. (Surely those qualities could not be taken from me, no matter what my driver’s license photo looked like.) I ignored the warm Dumpster juice trickling down my neck.  
  
  “I am Apollo,” I announced. “You mortals have three choices: offer me tribute, flee, or be destroyed.”  
  
  I wanted my words to echo through the alley, shake the towers of New York, and cause the skies to rain smoking ruin. None of that happened. On the word destroyed, my voice squeaked.  
  
  The redhead Cade grinned even wider. I thought how amusing it would be if I could make the snake tattoos around his neck come alive and strangle him to death.  
  
  “What do you think, Mikey?” he asked his friend. “Should we give this guy tribute?”  
  
  Mikey scowled. With his bristly blond hair, his cruel small eyes, and his thick frame, he reminded me of the monstrous sow that terrorized the village of Crommyon back in the good old days.  
  
  “Not feeling the tribute, Cade.” His voice sounded like he’d been eating lit cigarettes. “What were the other options?”  
  
  “Fleeing?” said Cade.  
  
  “Nah,” said Mikey.  
  
  “Being destroyed?”  
  
  Mikey snorted. “How about we destroy him instead?”  
  
  Cade flipped his knife and caught it by the handle. “I can live with that. After you.”  
  
  I slipped the wallet into my back pocket. I raised my fists. I did not like the idea of flattening mortals into flesh waffles, but I was sure I could do it. Even in my weakened state, I would be far stronger than any human.  
  
  “I warned you,” I said. “My powers are far beyond your comprehension.”  
  
  Mikey cracked his knuckles. “  
Uh-huh.”  
  
  He lumbered forward.  
  
  As soon as he was in range, I struck. I put all my wrath into that punch. It should have been enough to vaporize Mikey and leave a thug-shaped impression on the asphalt.  
  
  Instead he ducked, which I found quite annoying.  
  
  I stumbled forward. I have to say that when Prometheus fashioned you humans out of clay he did a shoddy job. Mortal legs are clumsy. I tried to compensate, drawing upon my boundless reserves of agility, but Mikey kicked me in the back. I fell on my divine face.  
  
  My nostrils inflated like air bags. My ears popped. The taste of copper filled my mouth. I rolled over, groaning, and found the two blurry thugs staring down at me.  
  
  “Mikey,” said Cade, “are you comprehending this guy’s power?”  
  
  “Nah,” said Mikey. “I’m not comprehending it.”  
  
  “Fools!” I croaked. “I will destroy you!”  
  
  “Yeah, sure.” Cade tossed away his knife. “But first I think we’ll stomp you.”  
  
  Cade raised his boot over my face, and the world went black.  
  
  A girl from nowhere  
  
  Completes my embarrassment  
  
  Stupid bananas  
  
  I HAD NOT BEEN STOMPED so badly since my guitar contest against Chuck Berry in 1957.  
  
  As Cade and Mikey kicked me, I curled into a ball, trying to protect my ribs and head. The pain was intolerable. I retched and shuddered. I blacked out and came to, my vision swimming with red splotches. When my attackers got tired of kicking me, they hit me over the head with a bag of garbage, which burst and covered me in coffee grounds and moldy fruit peels.  
  
  At last they stepped away, breathing heavily. Rough hands patted me down and took my wallet.  
  
  “Lookee here,” said Cade. “Some cash and an ID for…Lester Papadopoulos.”  
  
  Mikey laughed. “Lester? That’s even worse than Apollo.”  
  
  I touched my nose, which felt roughly the size and texture of a water-bed mattress. My fingers came away glistening red.  
  
  “Blood,” I muttered. “That’s not possible.”  
  
  “It’s very possible, Lester.” Cade crouched next to me. “And there might be more blood in your near future. You want to explain why you don’t have a credit card? Or a phone? I’d hate to think I did all that stomping for just a hundred bucks.”  
  
  I stared at the blood on my fingertips. I was a god. I did not have blood. Even when I’d been turned mortal before, golden ichor still ran through my veins. I had never before been so…converted. It must be a mistake. A trick. Something.  
  
  I tried to sit up.  
  
  My hand hit a banana peel and I fell again. My attackers howled in delight.  
  
  “I love this guy!” Mikey said.  
  
  “Yeah, but the boss told us he’d be loaded,” Cade complained.  
  
  “Boss…” I muttered. “Boss?”  
  
  “That’s right, Lester.” Cade flicked a finger against the side of my head. “‘Go to that alley,’ the boss told us. ‘Easy score.’ He said we should rough you up, take whatever you had. But this”—he waved the cash under my nose—“this isn’t much of a payday.”  
  
  Despite my predicament, I felt a surge of hopefulness. If these thugs had been sent here to find me, their “boss” must be a god. No mortal could have known I would fall to earth at this spot. Perhaps Cade and Mikey were not human either. Perhaps they were cleverly disguised monsters or spirits. At least that would explain why they had beaten me so easily.  
  
  “Who—who is your boss?” I struggled to my feet, coffee grounds dribbling from my shoulders. My dizziness made me feel as if I were flying too close to the fumes of primordial Chaos, but I refused to be humbled. “Did Zeus send you? Or perhaps Ares? I demand an audience!”  
  
  Mikey and Cade looked at each other as if to say, Can you believe this guy?  
  
  Cade picked up his knife. “You don’t take a hint, do you, Lester?”  
  
  Mikey pulled off his belt—a length of bike chain—and wrapped it around his fist.  
  
  I decided to sing them into submission. They may have resisted my fists, but no mortal could resist my golden voice. I was trying to decide between “You Send Me” and an original composition, “I’m Your Poetry God, Baby,” when a voice yelled, “HEY!”  
  
  The hooligans turned. Above us, on the second-story fire escape landing, stood a girl of about twelve. “Leave him alone,” she ordered.  
  
  My first thought was that Artemis had come to my aid. My sister often appeared as a twelve-year-old girl for reasons I’d never fully understood. But something told me this was not she.  
  
  The girl on the fire escape did not exactly inspire fear. She was small and pudgy, with dark hair chopped in a messy pageboy style and black cat-eye glasses with rhinestones glittering in the corners. Despite the cold, she wore no coat. Her outfit looked like it had been picked by a kindergartener—red sneakers, yellow tights, and a green tank dress. Perhaps she was on her way to a costume party dressed as a traffic light.  
  
  Still…there was something fierce in her expression. She had the same obstinate scowl my old girlfriend Cyrene used to get whenever she wrestled lions.  
  
  Mikey and Cade did not seem impressed.  
  
  “Get lost, kid,” Mikey told her.  
  
  The girl stamped her foot, causing the fire escape to shudder. “My alley. My rules!” Her bossy nasal voice made her sound like she was chiding a playmate in a game of make-believe. “Whatever that loser has is mine, including his money!”  
  
  “Why is everyone calling me a loser?” I asked weakly. The comment seemed unfair, even if I was beat-up and covered in garbage; but no one paid me any attention.  
  
  Cade glared at the girl. The red from his hair seemed to be seeping into his face. “You’ve got to be kidding me. Beat it, you brat!” He picked up a rotten apple and threw it.  
  
  The girl didn’t flinch. The fruit landed at her feet and rolled harmlessly to a stop.  
  
  “You want to play with food?” The girl wiped her nose. “Okay.”  
  
  I didn’t see her kick the apple, but it came flying back with deadly accuracy and hit Cade in the nose. He collapsed on his rump.  
  
  Mikey snarled. He marched toward the fire escape ladder, but a banana peel seemed to slither directly into his path. He slipped and fell hard. “OWWW!”  
  
  I backed away from the fallen thugs. I wondered if I should make a run for it, but I could barely hobble. I also did not want to be assaulted with old fruit.  
  
  The girl climbed over the railing. She dropped to the ground with surprising nimbleness and grabbed a sack of garbage from the Dumpster.  
  
  “Stop!” Cade did a sort of scuttling crab walk to get away from the girl. “Let’s talk about this!”  
  
  Mikey groaned and rolled onto his back.  
  
  The girl pouted. Her lips were chapped. She had wispy black fuzz at the corners of her mouth.  
  
  “I don’t like you guys,” she said. “You should go.”  
  
  “Yeah!” Cade said. “Sure! Just…”  
  
  He reached for the money scattered among the coffee grounds.  
  
  The girl swung her garbage bag. In mid arc the plastic exploded, disgorging an impossible number of rotten bananas. They knocked Cade flat. Mikey was plastered with so many peels he looked like he was being attacked by carnivorous starfish.  
  
  “Leave my alley,” the girl said. “Now.”  
  
  In the Dumpster, more trash bags burst like popcorn kernels, showering Cade and Mikey with radishes, potato peelings, and other compost material. Miraculously, none of it got on me. Despite their injuries, the two thugs scrambled to their feet and ran away, screaming.  
  
  I turned toward my pint-size savior. I was no stranger to dangerous women. My sister could rain down arrows of death. My stepmother, Hera, regularly drove mortals mad so that they would hack each other to pieces. But this garbage-wielding twelve-year-old made me nervous.  
  
  “Thank you,” I ventured.  
  
  The girl crossed her arms. On her middle fingers she wore matching gold rings with crescent signets. Her eyes glinted darkly like a crow’s. (I can make that comparison  
because I invented crows.)  
  
  “Don’t thank me,” she said. “You’re still in my alley.”  
  
  She walked a full circle around me, scrutinizing my appearance as if I were a prize cow. (I can also make that comparison, because I used to collect prize cows.)  
  
  “You’re the god Apollo?” She sounded less than awestruck. She also didn’t seem fazed by the idea of gods walking among mortals.  
  
  “You were listening, then?”  
  
  She nodded. “You don’t look like a god.”  
  
  “I’m not at my best,” I admitted. “My father, Zeus, has exiled me from Olympus. And who are you?”  
  
  She smelled faintly of apple pie, which was surprising, since she looked so grubby. Part of me wanted to find a fresh towel, clean her face, and give her money for a hot meal. Part of me wanted to fend her off with a chair in case she decided to bite me. She reminded me of the strays my sister was always adopting: dogs, panthers, homeless maidens, small dragons.  
  
  “Name is Meg,” she said.  
  
  “Short for Megara? Or Margaret?”  
  
  “Margaret. But don’t ever call me Margaret.”  
  
  “And are you a demigod, Meg?”  
  
  She pushed up her glasses. “Why would you think that?”  
  
  Again she didn’t seem surprised by the question. I sensed she had heard the term demigod before.  
  
  “Well,” I said, “you obviously have some power. You chased off those hooligans with rotten fruit. Perhaps you have banana-kinesis? Or you can control garbage? I once knew a Roman goddess, Cloacina, who presided over the city’s sewer system. Perhaps you’re related…?”  
  
  Meg pouted. I got the impression I might have said something wrong, though I couldn’t imagine what.  
  
  “I think I’ll just take your money,” Meg said. “Go on. Get out of here.”  
  
  “No, wait!” Desperation crept into my voice. “Please, I—I may need a bit of assistance.”  
  
  I felt ridiculous, of course. Me—the god of prophecy, plague, archery, healing, music, and several other things I couldn’t remember at the moment—asking a colorfully dressed street urchin for help. But I had no one else. If this child chose to take my money and kick me into the cruel winter streets, I didn’t think I could stop her.  
  
  “Say I believe you…” Meg’s voice took on a singsong tone, as if she were about to announce the rules of the game: I’ll be the princess, and you’ll be the scullery maid. “Say I decide to help. What then?”  
  
  Good question, I thought. “We…we are in Manhattan?”  
  
  “Mm-hmm.” She twirled and did a playful skip-kick. “Hell’s Kitchen.”  
  
  It seemed wrong for a child to say Hell’s Kitchen. Then again, it seemed wrong for a child to live in an alley and have garbage fights with thugs.  
  
  I considered walking to the Empire State Building. That was the modern gateway to Mount Olympus, but I doubted the guards would let me up to the secret six hundredth floor. Zeus would not make it so easy.

Perhaps I could find my old friend Chiron the centaur. He had a training camp on Long Island. He could offer me shelter and guidance. But that would be a dangerous journey. A defenseless god makes for a juicy target. Any monster along the way would cheerfully disembowel me. Jealous spirits and minor gods might also welcome the opportunity. Then there was Cade and Mikey’s mysterious “boss.” I had no idea who he was, or whether he had other, worse minions to send against me.  
  
  Even if I made it to Long Island, my new mortal eyes might not be able to find Chiron’s camp in its magically camouflaged valley. I needed a guide to get me there—someone experienced and close by….  
  
  “I have an idea.” I stood as straight as my injuries allowed. It wasn’t easy to look confident with a bloody nose and coffee grounds dripping off my clothes. “I know someone who might help. He lives on the Upper East Side. Take me to him, and I shall reward you.”  
  
  Meg made a sound between a sneeze and a laugh. “Reward me with what?” She danced around, plucking twenty-dollar bills from the trash. “I’m already taking all your money.”  
  
  “Hey!”  
  
  She tossed me my wallet, now empty except for Lester Papadopoulos’s junior driver’s license.  
  
  Meg sang, “I’ve got your money, I’ve got your money.”  
  
  I stifled a growl. “Listen, child, I won’t be mortal forever. Someday I will become a god again. Then I will reward those who helped me—and punish those who didn’t.”  
  
  She put her hands on her hips. “How do you know what will happen? Have you ever been mortal before?”  
  
  “Yes, actually. Twice! Both times, my punishment only lasted a few years at most!”  
  
  “Oh, yeah? And how did you get back to being all goddy or whatever?”  
  
  “Goddy is not a word,” I pointed out, though my poetic sensibilities were already thinking of ways I might use it. “Usually Zeus requires me to work as a slave for some important demigod. This fellow uptown I mentioned, for instance. He’d be perfect! I do whatever tasks my new master requires for a few years. As long as I behave, I am allowed back to Olympus. Right now I just have to recover my strength and figure out—”  
  
  “How do you know for sure which demigod?”  
  
  I blinked. “What?”  
  
  “Which demigod you’re supposed to serve, dummy.”  
  
  “I…uh. Well, it’s usually obvious. I just sort of run into them. That’s why I want to get to the Upper East Side. My new master will claim my service and—”  
  
  “I’m Meg McCaffrey!” Meg blew me a raspberry. “And I claim your service!”  
  
  Overhead, thunder rumbled in the gray sky. The sound echoed through the city canyons like divine laughter.  
  
  Whatever was left of my pride turned to ice water and trickled into my socks. “I walked right into that, didn’t I?”  
  
  “Yep!” Meg bounced up and down in her red sneakers. “We’re going to have fun!”  
  
  With great difficulty, I resisted the urge to weep. “Are you sure you’re not Artemis in disguise?”  
  
  “I’m that other thing,” Meg said, counting my money. “The thing you said before. A demigod.”  
  
  “How do you know?”  
  
  “Just do.” She gave me a smug smile. “And now I have a sidekick god named Lester!”  
  
  I raised my face to the heavens. “Please, Father, I get the point. Please, I can’t do this!”  
  
  Zeus did not answer. He was probably too busy recording my humiliation to share on Snapchat.  
  
  “Cheer up,” Meg told me. “Who’s that guy you wanted to see—the guy on the Upper East Side?”  
  
  “Another demigod,” I said. “He knows the way to a camp where I might find shelter, guidance, food—”  
  
  “Food?” Meg’s ears perked up almost as much as the points on her glasses. “Good food?”  
  
  “Well, normally I just eat ambrosia, but, yes, I suppose.”  
  
  “Then that’s my first order! We’re going to find this guy to take us to the camp place!”  
  
  I sighed miserably. It was going to be a very long servitude.  
  
  “As you wish,” I said. “Let’s find Percy Jackson.”  
  
  Used to be goddy  
  
  Now uptown feeling shoddy  
  
  Bah, haiku don’t rhyme  
  
  AS WE TRUDGED up Madison Avenue, my mind swirled with questions: Why hadn’t Zeus given me a winter coat? Why did Percy Jackson live so far uptown? Why did pedestrians keep staring at me?  
  
  I wondered if my divine radiance was starting to return. Perhaps the New Yorkers were awed by my obvious power and unearthly good looks.  
  
  Meg McCaffrey set me straight.  
  
  “You smell,” she said. “You look like you’ve just been mugged.”  
  
  “I have just been mugged. Also enslaved by a small child.”  
  
  “It’s not slavery.” She chewed off a piece of her thumb cuticle and spit it out. “It’s more like mutual cooperation.”  
  
  “Mutual in the sense that you give orders and I am forced to cooperate?”  
  
  “Yep.” She stopped in front of a storefront window. “See? You look gross.”  
  
  My reflection stared back at me, except it was not my reflection. It couldn’t be. The face was the same as on Lester Papadopoulos’s ID.  
  
  I looked about sixteen. My medium-length hair was dark and curly—a style I had rocked in Athenian times, and again in the 1970s. My eyes were blue. My face was pleasing enough in a dorkish way, but it was marred by a swollen eggplant-colored nose, which had dripped a gruesome mustache of blood down my upper lip. Even worse, my cheeks were covered with some sort of rash that looked suspiciously like…My heart climbed into my throat.

  Look, I didn't want to be a half-blood.  
  
  If you're reading this because you think you might be one, my advice is: close this book right now. Believe whatever lie your mom or dad told you about your birth, and try to lead a normal life.  
  
  Being a half-blood is dangerous. It's scary. Most of the time, it gets you killed in painful, nasty ways.  
  
  If you're a normal kid, reading this because you think it's fiction, great. Read on. I envy you for being able to believe that none of this ever happened.  
  
  But if you recognize yourself in these pages—if you feel something stirring inside—stop reading immediately. You might be one of us. And once you know that, it's only a matter of time before they sense it too, and they'll come for you.  
  
  Don't say I didn't warn you.  
  
  My name is Percy Jackson.  
  
  I'm twelve years old. Until a few months ago, I was a boarding student at YancyAcademy, a private school for troubled kids in upstate New York.  
  
  Am I a troubled kid?  
  
  Yeah. You could say that.  
  
  I could start at any point in my short miserable life to prove it, but things really started going bad last May, when our sixth-grade class took a field trip to Manhattan— twenty-eight mental-case kids and two teachers on a yellow school bus, heading to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to look at ancient Greek and Roman stuff.  
  
  I know—it sounds like torture. Most Yancy field trips were.  
  
  But Mr. Brunner, our Latin teacher, was leading this trip, so I had hopes.  
  
  Mr. Brunner was this middle-aged guy in a motorized wheelchair. He had thinning hair and a scruffy beard and a frayed tweed jacket, which always smelled like coffee. You wouldn't think he'd be cool, but he told stories and jokes and let us play games in class. He also had this awesome collection of Roman armor and weapons, so he was the only teacher whose class didn't put me to sleep.  
  
  I hoped the trip would be okay. At least, I hoped that for once I wouldn't get in trouble.  
  
  Boy, was I wrong.  
  
  See, bad things happen to me on field trips. Like at my fifth-grade school, when we went to the Saratoga battlefield, I had this accident with a Revolutionary War cannon. I wasn't aiming for the school bus, but of course I got expelled anyway. And before that, at my fourth-grade school, when we took a behind-the-scenes tour of the Marine World shark pool, I sort of hit the wrong lever on the catwalk and our class took an unplanned swim. And the time before that. . . Well, you get the idea.  
  
  This trip, I was determined to be good.  
  
  All the way into the city, I put up with Nancy Bobofit, the freckly, redheaded kleptomaniac girl, hitting my best friend Grover in the back of the head with chunks of peanut butter-and-ketchup sandwich.  
  
  Grover was an easy target. He was scrawny. He cried when he got frustrated. He must've been held back several grades, because he was the only sixth grader with acne and the start of a wispy beard on his chin. On top of all that, he was crippled. He had a note excusing him from PE for the rest of his life because he had some kind of muscular disease in his legs. He walked funny, like every step hurt him, but don't let that fool you. You should've seen him run when it was enchilada day in the cafeteria.  
  
  Anyway, Nancy Bobofit was throwing wads of sandwich that stuck in his curly brown hair, and she knew I couldn't do anything back to her because I was already on probation. The headmaster had threatened me with death by in-school suspension if anything bad, embarrassing, or even mildly entertaining happened on this trip.  
  
  ""I'm going to kill her,"" I mumbled.  
  
  Grover tried to calm me down. ""It's okay. I like peanut butter. ""  
  
  He dodged another piece of Nancy's lunch.  
  
  ""That's it. "" I started to get up, but Grover pulled me back to my seat.  
  
  ""You're already on probation,"" he reminded me. ""You know who'll get blamed if anything happens. ""  
  
  Looking back on it, I wish I'd decked Nancy Bobofit right then and there. In-school suspension would've been nothing compared to the mess I was about to get myself into.  
  
  Mr. Brunner led the museum tour.  
  
  He rode up front in his wheelchair, guiding us through the big echoey galleries, past marble statues and glass cases full of really old black-and-orange pottery.  
  
  It blew my mind that this stuff had survived for two thousand, three thousand years.  
  
  He gathered us around a thirteen-foot-tall stone column with a big sphinx on the top, and started telling us how it was a grave marker, a stele, for a girl about our age. He told us about the carvings on the sides. I was trying to listen to what he had to say, because it was kind of interesting, but everybody around me was talking, and every time I told them to shut up, the other teacher chaperone, Mrs. Dodds, would give me the evil eye.  
  
  Mrs. Dodds was this little math teacher from Georgia who always wore a black leather jacket, even though she was fifty years old. She looked mean enough to ride a Harley right into your locker. She had come to Yancy halfway through the year, when our last math teacher had a nervous breakdown.  
  
  From her first day, Mrs. Dodds loved Nancy Bobofit and figured I was devil spawn. She would point her crooked finger at me and say, ""Now, honey,"" real sweet, and I knew I was going to get after-school detention for a month.  
  
  One time, after she'd made me erase answers out of old math workbooks until midnight, I told Grover I didn't think Mrs. Dodds was human. He looked at me, real serious, and said, ""You're absolutely right. ""  
  
  Mr. Brunner kept talking about Greek funeral art.  
  
  Finally, Nancy Bobofit snickered something about the naked guy on the stele, and I turned around and said, ""Will you shut up?""  
  
  It came out louder than I meant it to.  
  
  The whole group laughed. Mr. Brunner stopped his story.  
  
  ""Mr. Jackson,"" he said, ""did you have a comment?""  
  
  My face was totally red. I said, ""No, sir. ""  
  
  Mr. Brunner pointed to one of the pictures on the stele. ""Perhaps you'll tell us what this picture represents?""  
  
  I looked at the carving, and felt a flush of relief, because I actually recognized it. ""That's Kronos eating his kids, right?""  
  
  ""Yes,"" Mr. Brunner said, obviously not satisfied. ""And he did this because . . . ""  
  
  ""Well. . . "" I racked my brain to remember. ""Kronos was the king god, and—""  
  
  ""God?"" Mr. Brunner asked.  
  
  ""Titan,"" I corrected myself. ""And . . . he didn't trust his kids, who were the gods. So, um, Kronos ate them, right? But his wife hid baby Zeus, and gave Kronos a rock to eat instead. And later, when Zeus grew up, he tricked his dad, Kronos, into barfing up his brothers and sisters—""  
  
  ""Eeew!"" said one of the girls behind me.  
  
  ""—and so there was this big fight between the gods and the Titans,"" I continued, ""and the gods won. ""  
  
  Some snickers from the group.  
  
  Behind me, Nancy Bobofit mumbled to a friend, ""Like we're going to use this in real life. Like it's going to say on our job applications, 'Please explain why Kronos ate his kids. '""  
  
  ""And why, Mr. Jackson,"" Brunner said, ""to paraphrase Miss Bobofit's excellent question, does this matter in real life?""  
  
  ""Busted,"" Grover muttered.  
  
  ""Shut up,"" Nancy hissed, her face even brighter red than her hair.  
  
  At least Nancy got packed, too. Mr. Brunner was the only one who ever caught her saying anything wrong. He had radar ears.  
  
  I thought about his question, and shrugged. ""I don't know, sir. ""  
  
  ""I see. "" Mr. Brunner looked disappointed. ""Well, half credit, Mr. Jackson. Zeus did indeed feed Kronos a mixture of mustard and wine, which made him disgorge his other five children, who, of course, bein  
g immortal gods, had been living and growing up completely undigested in the Titan's stomach. The gods defeated their father, sliced him to pieces with his own scythe, and scattered his remains in Tartarus, the darkest part of the Underworld. On that happy note, it's time for lunch. Mrs. Dodds, would you lead us back outside?""  
  
  The class drifted off, the girls holding their stomachs, the guys pushing each other around and acting like doofuses.  
  
  Grover and I were about to follow when Mr. Brunner said, ""Mr. Jackson. ""  
  
  I knew that was coming.  
  
  I told Grover to keep going. Then I turned toward Mr. Brunner. ""Sir?""  
  
  Mr. Brunner had this look that wouldn't let you go— intense brown eyes that could've been a thousand years old and had seen everything.  
  
  ""You must learn the answer to my question,"" Mr. Brunner told me.  
  
  ""About the Titans?""  
  
  ""About real life. And how your studies apply to it. ""  
  
  ""Oh. ""  
  
  ""What you learn from me,"" he said, ""is vitally important. I expect you to treat it as such. I will accept only the best from you, Percy Jackson. ""  
  
  I wanted to get angry, this guy pushed me so hard.  
  
  I mean, sure, it was kind of cool on tournament days, when he dressed up in a suit of Roman armor and shouted: ""What ho!'"" and challenged us, sword-point against chalk, to run to the board and name every Greek and Roman person who had ever lived, and their mother, and what god they worshipped. But Mr. Brunner expected me to be as good as everybody else, despite the fact that I have dyslexia and attention deficit disorder and I had never made above a C– in my life. No—he didn't expect me to be as good; he expected me to be better. And I just couldn't learn all those names and facts, much less spell them correctly.  
  
  I mumbled something about trying harder, while Mr. Brunner took one long sad look at the stele, like he'd been at this girl's funeral.  
  
  He told me to go outside and eat my lunch.  
  
  The class gathered on the front steps of the museum, where we could watch the foot traffic along Fifth Avenue.  
  
  Overhead, a huge storm was brewing, with clouds blacker than I'd ever seen over the city. I figured maybe it was global warming or something, because the weather all across New York state had been weird since Christmas. We'd had massive snow storms, flooding, wildfires from lightning strikes. I wouldn't have been surprised if this was a hurricane blowing in.  
  
  Nobody else seemed to notice. Some of the guys were pelting pigeons with Lunchables crackers. Nancy Bobofit was trying to pickpocket something from a lady's purse, and, of course, Mrs. Dodds wasn't seeing a thing.  
  
  Grover and I sat on the edge of the fountain, away from the others. We thought that maybe if we did that, everybody wouldn't know we were from that school—the school for loser freaks who couldn't make it elsewhere.  
  
  ""Detention?"" Grover asked.  
  
  ""Nah,"" I said. ""Not from Brunner. I just wish he'd lay off me sometimes. I mean—I'm not a genius. ""  
  
  Grover didn't say anything for a while. Then, when I thought he was going to give me some deep philosophical comment to make me feel better, he said, ""Can I have your apple?""  
  
  I didn't have much of an appetite, so I let him take it.  
  
  I watched the stream of cabs going down Fifth Avenue, and thought about my mom's apartment, only a little ways uptown from where we sat. I hadn't seen her since Christmas. I wanted so bad to jump in a taxi and head home. She'd hug me and be glad to see me, but she'd be disappointed, too. She'd send me right back to Yancy, remind me that I had to try harder, even if this was my sixth school in six years and I was probably going to be kicked out again. I wouldn't be able to stand that sad look she'd give me.  
 Mr. Brunner parked his wheelchair at the base of the handicapped ramp. He ate celery while he read a paperback novel. A red umbrella stuck up from the back of his chair, making it look like a motorized cafe table.  
  
  I was about to unwrap my sandwich when Nancy Bobofit appeared in front of me with her ugly friends—I guess shed gotten tired of stealing from the tourists—and dumped her half-eaten lunch in Grovers lap.  
  
  ""Oops. "" She grinned at me with her crooked teeth. Her freckles were orange, as if somebody had spray-painted her face with liquid Cheetos.  
  
  I tried to stay cool. The school counselor had told me a million times, ""Count to ten, get control of your temper. "" But I was so mad my mind went blank. A wave roared in my ears.  
  
  I dont remember touching her, but the next thing I knew, Nancy was sitting on her butt in the fountain, screaming, ""Percy pushed me!""  
  
  Mrs. Dodds materialized next to us.  
  
  Some of the kids were whispering: ""Did you see—""  
  
  ""—the water—""  
  
  ""—like it grabbed her—""  
  
  I didnt know what they were talking about. All I knew was that I was in trouble again.  
  
  As soon as Mrs. Dodds was sure poor little Nancy was okay, promising to get her a new shirt at the museum gift shop, etc. , etc. , Mrs. Dodds turned on me. There was a triumphant fire in her eyes, as if Id done something shed been waiting for all semester. ""Now, honey—""  
  
  ""I know,"" I grumbled. ""A month erasing workbooks. ""  
  
  That wasnt the right thing to say.  
  
  ""Come with me,"" Mrs. Dodds said.  
  
  ""Wait!"" Grover yelped. ""It was me. I pushed her. ""  
  
  I stared at him, stunned. I couldnt believe he was trying to cover for me. Mrs. Dodds scared Grover to death.  
  
  She glared at him so hard his whiskery chin trembled.  
  
  ""I dont think so, Mr. Underwood,"" she said.  
  
  ""But—""  
  
  ""You—will—stay—here. ""  
  
  Grover looked at me desperately.  
  
  ""Its okay, man,"" I told him. ""Thanks for trying. ""  
  
  ""Honey,"" Mrs. Dodds barked at me. ""Now. ""  
  
  Nancy Bobofit smirked.  
  
  I gave her my deluxe Ill-kill-you-later stare. Then I turned to face Mrs. Dodds, but she wasnt there. She was standing at the museum entrance, way at the top of the steps, gesturing impatiently at me to come on.  
  
  Howd she get there so fast?  
  
  I have moments like that a lot, when my brain falls asleep or something, and the next thing I know Ive missed something, as if a puzzle piece fell out of the universe and left me staring at the blank place behind it. The school counselor told me this was part of the ADHD, my brain misinterpreting things.  
  
  I wasnt so sure.  
  
  I went after Mrs. Dodds.  
  
  Halfway up the steps, I glanced back at Grover. He was looking pale, cutting his eyes between me and Mr. Brunner, like he wanted Mr. Brunner to notice what was going on, but Mr. Brunner was absorbed in his novel.  
  
  I looked back up. Mrs. Dodds had disappeared again. She was now inside the building, at the end of the entrance hall.  
  
  Okay, I thought. Shes going to make me buy a new shirt for Nancy at the gift shop.  
  
  But apparently that wasnt the plan.  
  
  I followed her deeper into the museum. When I finally caught up to her, we were back in the Greek and Roman section.  
  
  Except for us, the gallery was empty.  
  
  Mrs. Dodds stood with her arms crossed in front of a big marble frieze of the Greek gods. She was making this weird noise in her throat, like growling.  
  
  Even without the noise, I wouldve been nervous. Its weird being alone with a teacher, especially Mrs. Dodds. Something about the way she looked at the frieze, as if she wanted to pulverize it. . .  
  
  ""Youve been giving us problems, honey,"" she said.  
  
  I did the safe thing. I said, ""Yes, maam. ""  
  
  She tugged on the cuffs of her leather jacket. ""Did you really think you would get away with it?""  
  
  The look in her eyes was beyond mad. It was evil.  
  
  Shes a teacher, I thought nervously. Its not like shes going to hurt me.  
  
  I said, ""Ill—Ill try harder, maam. ""  
  
  Thunder shook the building.  
  
  ""We are not fools, Percy Jackson,"" Mrs. Dodds said. ""It was only a matter of time before we found you out. Confess, and you will suffer less pain. ""  
  
  I didnt know what she was talking about.  
  
  All I could think of was that the teachers mustve found the illegal stash of candy Id been selling out of my dorm room. Or maybe theyd realized I got my essay on Tom Sawyer from the Internet without ever reading the book and now they were going to take away my grade. Or worse, they were going to make me read the book.  
  
  ""Well?"" she demanded.  
  
  ""Maam, I dont. . . ""  
  
  ""Your time is up,"" she hissed.  
  
  Then the weirdest thing happened. Her eyes began to glow like barbecue coals. Her fingers stretched, turning into talons. Her jacket melted into large, leathery wings. She wasnt human. She was a shriveled hag with bat wings and claws and a mouth full of yellow fangs, and she was about to slice me to ribbons.  
  
  Then things got even stranger.  
  
  Mr. Brunner, whod been out in front of the museum a minute before, wheeled his chair into the doorway of the gallery, holding a pen in his hand.  
  
  ""What ho, Percy!"" he shouted, and tossed the pen through the air.  
  
  Mrs. Dodds lunged at me.  
  
  With a yelp, I dodged and felt talons slash the air next to my ear. I snatched the ballpoint pen out of the air, but when it hit my hand, it wasnt a pen anymore. It was a sword—Mr. Brunners bronze sword, which he always used on tournament day.  
  
  Mrs. Dodds spun toward me with a murderous look in her eyes.  
  
  My knees were jelly. My hands were shaking so bad I almost dropped the sword.  
  
  She snarled, ""Die, honey!""  
  
  And she flew straight at me.  
  
  Absolute terror ran through my body. I did the only thing that came naturally: I swung the sword.  
  
  The metal blade hit her shoulder and passed clean through her body as if she were made of water. Hisss!  
  
  Mrs. Dodds was a sand castle in a power fan. She exploded into yellow powder, vaporized on the spot, leaving nothing but the smell of sulfur and a dying screech and a chill of evil in the air, as if those two glowing red eyes were still watching me.  
  
  I was alone.  
  
  There was a ballpoint pen in my hand.  
  
  Mr. Brunner wasnt there. Nobody was there but me.  
  
  My hands were still trembling. My lunch mustve been contaminated with magic mushrooms or something.  
  
  Had I imagined the whole thing?  
  
  I went back outside.  
  
  It had started to rain.  
  
  Grover was sitting by the fountain, a museum map tented over his head. Nancy Bobofit was still standing there, soaked from her swim in the fountain, grumbling to her ugly friends. When she saw me, she said, ""I hope Mrs. Kerr whipped your butt. ""  
  
  I said, ""Who?""  
  
  ""Our teacher. Duh!""  
  
  I blinked. We had no teacher named Mrs. Kerr. I asked Nancy what she was talking about.  
  
  She just rolled her eyes and turned away.  
  
  I asked Grover where Mrs. Dodds was.  
  
  He said, ""Who?""  
  
  But he paused first, and he wouldnt look at me, so I thought he was messing with me.  
  
  ""Not funny, man,"" I told him. ""This is serious. ""  
  
  Thunder boomed overhead.  
  
  I saw Mr. Brunner sitting under his red umbrella, reading his book, as if hed never moved.  
  
  I went over to him.  
  
  He looked up, a little distracted. ""Ah, that would be my pen. Please bring your own writing utensil in the future, Mr. Jackson. ""  
  
  I handed Mr. Brunner his pen. I hadnt even realized I was still holding it.  
  
  ""Sir,"" I said, ""wheres Mrs. Dodds?""  
  
  He stared at me blankly. ""Who?""  
  
  ""The other chaperone. Mrs. Dodds. The pre-algebra teacher. ""<  
br />  
  He frowned and sat forward, looking mildly concerned. ""Percy, there is no Mrs. Dodds on this trip. As far as I know, there has never been a Mrs. Dodds at YancyAcademy. Are you feeling all right?""  
  
  2. THREE OLD LADIES KNIT THE SOCKS OF DEATH  
  
  I was used to the occasional weird experience, but usually they were over quickly. This twenty-four/seven hallucination was more than I could handle. For the rest of the school year, the entire campus seemed to be playing some kind of trick on me. The students acted as if they were completely and totally convinced that Mrs. Kerr—a perky blond woman whom Id never seen in my life until she got on our bus at the end of the field trip—had been our pre-algebra teacher since Christmas.  
  
  Every so often I would spring a Mrs. Dodds reference on somebody, just to see if I could trip them up, but they would stare at me like I was psycho.  
  
  It got so I almost believed them—Mrs. Dodds had never existed.  
  
  Almost.  
  
  But Grover couldnt fool me. When I mentioned the name Dodds to him, he would hesitate, then claim she didnt exist. But I knew he was lying.  
  
  Something was going on. Something had happened at the museum.  
  
  I didnt have much time to think about it during the days, but at night, visions of Mrs. Dodds with talons and leathery wings would wake me up in a cold sweat.  
  
  The freak weather continued, which didnt help my mood. One night, a thunderstorm blew out the windows in my dorm room. A few days later, the biggest tornado ever spotted in the HudsonValley touched down only fifty miles from YancyAcademy. One of the current events we studied in social studies class was the unusual number of small planes that had gone down in sudden squalls in the Atlantic that year.  
  
  I started feeling cranky and irritable most of the time. My grades slipped from Ds to Fs. I got into more fights with Nancy Bobofit and her friends. I was sent out into the hallway in almost every class.  
  
  Finally, when our English teacher, Mr. Nicoll, asked me for the millionth time why I was too lazy to study for spelling tests, I snapped. I called him an old sot. I wasnt even sure what it meant, but it sounded good.  
  
  The headmaster sent my mom a letter the following week, making it official: I would not be invited back next year to YancyAcademy.  
  
  Fine, I told myself. Just fine.  
  
  I was homesick.  
  
  I wanted to be with my mom in our little apartment on the Upper East Side, even if I had to go to public school and put up with my obnoxious stepfather and his stupid poker parties.  
  
  And yet. . . there were things Id miss at Yancy. The view of the woods out my dorm window, the Hudson River in the distance, the smell of pine trees. Id miss Grover, whod been a good friend, even if he was a little strange. I worried how hed survive next year without me.  
  
  Id miss Latin class, too—Mr. Brunners crazy tournament days and his faith that I could do well.  
  
  As exam week got closer, Latin was the only test I studied for. I hadnt forgotten what Mr. Brunner had told me about this subject being life-and-death for me. I wasnt sure why, but Id started to believe him.  
  
  The evening before my final, I got so frustrated I threw the Cambridge Guide to Greek Mythology across my dorm room. Words had started swimming off the page, circling my head, the letters doing one-eighties as if they were riding skateboards. There was no way I was going to remember the difference between Chiron and Charon, or Polydictes and Polydeuces. And conjugating those Latin verbs? Forget it.  
  
  I paced the room, feeling like ants were crawling around inside my shirt.  
  
  I remembered Mr. Brunners serious expression, his thousand-year-old eyes. I will accept only the best from you, Percy Jackson.

I found out why.,"Have you ever stared into something so wrong, so fundamentally alien, that your brain simply refused to process it? Like your mind hit an invisible wall and just—shut down.

What if there are rules to reality we’re not meant to question… rules that break you the moment you break them? And what if, one night, in a place forgotten by the rest of the world, someone did?

My name is Mason. And I should’ve never said yes to that job.

They called it Black Hollow Station—a cold, hollow echo of a name that matched the emptiness around it. Located deep in the wasteland, hundreds of miles from the nearest human settlement, it was a concrete wound buried in snow and silence. No roads. No towns. No signs of life. Just wind that howled like a mourning beast, and a sky that never blinked.

They say silence is peaceful. But not here. Here, silence felt...watchful. Like the Earth had exhaled and was waiting to see if you’d flinch.

I took the job out of desperation—pure and simple. My bank account was hanging by a thread, and when the listing appeared, it looked like salvation disguised as a job posting. ""Night Surveillance Operator – Remote Research Station – Six Months – High Pay."" Sounded harmless enough. Sit in front of monitors. Drink some coffee. Get paid.

The salary? Obscene. Double what I’d made in a year—plus room, board, and a guaranteed bonus. Too good, I realize now. Far, far too good.

That should’ve been my first warning. But I was broke, and broke people don’t ask enough questions.

When I arrived, I expected some sort of welcoming orientation. Maybe a tour. What I got instead was a silent man waiting in the snow.

He stood motionless outside the steel entrance—tall, bald, face like carved granite. His parka was bone white, stitched with a black insignia that looked like an eye inside a triangle. He didn’t smile. Didn’t shake my hand. Just said, in a voice so dry it might’ve flaked away in the cold, ""We’ll go over the rules first. That’s the most important part.""

He handed me a laminated card. The letters were bold and red, like warnings scrawled in blood:

* NEVER open the observation room door between 1:11 a.m. and 2:47 a.m.
* If the hallway lights flicker, DO NOT move. Hold your breath until they stop.
* At 3:03 a.m., check Camera 6. If the room is empty, you’re safe. If someone is standing there, DO NOT look away until they vanish.
* If you hear knocking in the ventilation shafts, ignore it. Do not speak back.
* At 4:44 a.m., go to the main generator room. Count the humming sounds. There should be five. Report any deviation.
* Never, under any circumstance, open the northern exit.

I let out a weak laugh, expecting him to crack a grin. ""Is this a joke?"" I asked.

He didn’t even blink. ""These are not suggestions, Mason. Break one, and you won’t survive the night.""

The way he said it—like someone repeating a fact he’d watched unfold too many times—strangled the laughter in my throat. Still, I told myself it had to be some kind of psychological experiment. This was a research facility, right? Maybe I was the experiment.

The first few nights passed without incident. The cameras fed me an endless loop of still, empty corridors. No movement. No noise. No surprises. Just the occasional gust of wind whining against the metal walls and the distant hum of generators churning through the dark.

I followed the rules. Out of habit more than fear. Sip coffee. Watch screens. Wait. Rinse. Repeat.

By night five, I’d almost convinced myself the whole thing was a test—some elaborate boredom endurance trial. And then came night six.

It was 1:12 a.m. I remember the time exactly, because that’s when the door handle to the observation room twitched.

Not creaked. Not wiggled. Twitch—like a muscle spasm in metal.

My blood turned to slush. Rule one. I was past the danger time.

I froze, cup halfway to my lips. The door handle rattled again. Just once more. Then silence.

No footsteps. No retreating echo. Just... nothing.

At 1:34 a.m., the hallway lights started flickering.

Rule two. I stopped breathing. My throat constricted as if invisible hands had clamped shut around it.

Ten seconds. Maybe less. But in that moment, time lost all meaning. My heartbeat pounded so hard I was sure the sound alone would get me killed.

When the flickering stopped, I gasped like I’d clawed my way out of a coffin. Still no movement on the cameras. Still no noise. But something had changed. The air felt...wrong. Like the station had noticed me.

And then the clock ticked to 3:03 a.m.

That’s when everything changed.

The monitor’s soft glow lit up the room as I turned to Camera 6, just like the rule commanded. It showed the same storage room I’d seen a dozen times before—white walls, metal shelves lined with labeled crates, and a flickering ceiling bulb that buzzed like an insect caught in glass.

At first, it was empty.

And then—he was there.

No movement. No sound. No transition.

Just a man, suddenly in the dead center of the room. Standing. Frozen. Facing the camera like he’d been waiting. Watching. Or worse—knowing.

His mouth hung wide open. But not like he was screaming—no sound came out. It was just open, like his jaw had disconnected and he’d forgotten how to fix it.

His eyes… my God, his eyes. They bulged like something behind them was trying to get out. No blinking. No twitch. Just raw, silent panic radiating from every inch of his face.

And he was staring. Right at me. Or through me. I couldn't tell which was worse.

My muscles locked. My skin crawled like ants were burrowing beneath it. My throat dried up, my sweat turned cold, and my heart thudded like a war drum in my ears. But I remembered the rule.

Do not look away.

So I stared. My eyes stung. My vision blurred. My spine screamed to turn away. But I didn’t. Couldn’t.

And then—he was gone. Not a step, not a fade. One frame he was there, the next—nothing. Like he'd been erased.

That was the moment it hit me: These weren’t rules. They were rituals. And breaking one wasn’t an accident—it was a death sentence.

I wanted to leave. I wanted to scream, to throw my badge on the floor and tell Ellis I was done. But that option didn’t exist.

The chopper only came once a month. I had three weeks left. Three long, cold, blood-curdling weeks.

And if I walked out before my contract ended? No paycheck. No transportation. No guarantee I’d even make it through the snow.

So I stayed.

And the next night, I followed the rules like they were holy scripture.

At exactly 4:44 a.m., I made my way to the generator room. Just like Rule 5 said.

The room smelled like burning ozone and old copper. The generators thrummed in the dark like sleeping beasts. I closed my eyes and listened to those hums.

One. Two. Three. Four.

Then… nothing.

My stomach turned to ice. The silence wasn’t quiet—it was active. It pressed against my eardrums like a held breath, waiting for me to flinch.

And then— A whisper.

""Help.""

Soft. Fragile. Like it had bled out through a slit in reality.

It came from behind the generator. I didn’t move. Didn’t speak.

""You’re not supposed to be here.""

This time, the voice was right next to my ear. Like it had bent time and space just to crawl beside me.

My body acted before my brain did. I bolted. Sprinted through the icy halls with adrenaline burning my veins. I slammed the control room door and locked it behind me, collapsing into the chair like I'd been shot.

My hands trembled violently. I could barely type. I sat there, paralyzed, until the sun bled pale light across the horizon.

Later that morning, Dr. Ellis strolled in like nothing had happened. Like I hadn’t just had a conversation with something not human in the dark.

I told him everything. The missing fifth hum. The whisper. The voice right beside me.

He didn’t blink. Just rubbed his jaw and said, flatly, ""You only heard four hums?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""And something whispered. Twice.""

He looked... disturbed. Not shocked. Not confused. Just disturbed—like someone who’d seen this pattern unfold before.

""That’s… concerning,"" he muttered. ""Did it touch you?""

The question nearly stopped my heart.

""No.""

He nodded slowly. ""Then you’re still okay. But if it talks to you again...""

He paused, then locked eyes with me.

""Do not answer it.""

I didn’t want to hear that. I didn’t want to know there could be a next time.

But quitting wasn’t an option. Not without losing everything. So I forced myself to stay.

In hindsight… That choice sealed my fate.

Two nights later, it happened.

I broke a rule.

Not on purpose. Not out of rebellion or carelessness.

It happened because something… changed the rules.

And from that moment on—

I was no longer a watcher.

I had become the watched.

The cameras started showing rooms that didn’t exist. Doors opened on their own. And at 1:11 a.m., something knocked.

From inside the observation room.

I didn’t mean to break the rule. But I did.

And what came out when I opened that door… wasn’t human.

The hallway lights flickered again.

Rule 2. That should’ve been my cue—freeze, hold my breath, become a statue and wait for it to pass.

And I did. At first.

But then, my radio hissed.

A burst of static snapped through the silence like lightning through still water.

“Mason… Mason, come to the observation room. Emergency. Come quick.”

It was Ellis.

Or, at least—it sounded like him.

Instinct took over.

I gasped, just once. A sharp inhale. A human reaction to panic.

The air burned as it filled my lungs. I hadn’t meant to breathe. I just did. And worse—I’d moved. My body had tensed, my hand twitching toward the radio before I remembered the rule.

I had broken it.

Everything went silent. So silent that even my heartbeat felt intrusive.

And then— The lights turned red.

Not dim. Not off. Red—like blood soaking through snow.

I hadn’t even known the facility could do that.

A high-pitched ringing bled through the hallway outside the control room—an unnatural tone, like glass grinding against teeth.

I turned to the monitors, already knowing I wouldn’t like what I saw.

Every hallway was black. Swallowed in shadow. Except one.

On that screen, something was crawling.

It didn’t walk. It didn’t even stagger. It crawled—rapid and erratic, like a centipede that had just been set on fire. Its limbs moved too fast, bending the wrong way, jittering like a corrupted video file.

And then it stopped.

Right outside my door.

I didn’t move. Didn’t blink. Didn’t even think.

I just sat there—paralyzed, praying to gods I’d stopped believing in.

Then the scratching began.

Slow. Methodical. Not random, but intentional. Like it was carving something.

Claw by claw, stroke by stroke.

I could feel it—etching madness into the metal. Marking me.

Morning came. Eventually. Though I didn’t remember the sun rising. It just… happened.

I cracked the door open, expecting claw marks, evidence—something.

But there was nothing.

The door was smooth. Stainless. Untouched.

As if the night had been nothing more than a hallucination. But I knew better.

Because something in me had cracked. A hairline fracture in the mind. A splinter in the soul.

My sanity hadn’t just bent—it had started to bleed.

I found Ellis in the lab, sipping coffee like it was just another day in hell. But I didn’t wait this time. I slammed my fist on the table.

“What the hell is this place?” I demanded. “What are we really researching?”

He looked older than he had the day before. Not just tired—withered. Like each night had stolen a year from his face.

He sighed. That kind of long, heavy sigh people give when they're about to dump a truth that shatters you.

“We’re not researching. Not anymore.”

He paused. Looked me dead in the eye.

“We’re containing.”

That word hung in the air like a curse.

“Containing what?” I asked.

He didn’t answer—not with words.

Instead, he slid a thick manila folder across the table. Inside were photographs—black and white, low-resolution, wrong.

Figures that defied anatomy. Blurred silhouettes with too many joints, no eyes, too many mouths. One looked like a shadow with bones. Another—like a pile of spines floating in smoke.

I didn’t realize I was shaking until I heard the photos rattle in my hands.

“We call them residuals,” Ellis said. “They’re not ghosts. Not aliens. We don’t know what they are.”

He gestured around at the facility.

“But this facility seems to attract them. Maybe it’s the cold. Maybe the isolation. Maybe something older than both. We built this place to keep them here. To keep the rules in place.”

I asked the question I already dreaded the answer to.

“And if the rules are broken?”

He didn’t hesitate.

“Then they get out… or get in.”

I didn’t sleep that day. Couldn’t. Even when I closed my eyes, I could see the thing scratching at the door. Could feel its presence—like its memory had seeped into the wiring.

That night was my last.

The last night at Black Hollow.

And the worst.

Because I was no longer just following the rules…

I was about to become part of them.

When the lights went out completely—no red, no flicker—just darkness... I realized something had changed.

The station wasn’t trying to keep them contained anymore.

It was trying to keep me in.

My last night at Black Hollow was the worst.

There’s no clever metaphor to dress it up. It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t bloody. It was… personal.

Because the thing I saw that night— was me.

At exactly 3:03 a.m., I turned to Camera 6, like I had every night before. My fingers trembled, hovering over the keyboard like they already knew something was waiting.

The feed buzzed softly, flickered, then sharpened.

It was the same room—the same white-walled storage unit with metal racks and that single, humming light overhead.

But this time…

There was someone inside.

Not a stranger. Not a shadow.

It was me.

Same uniform. Same posture. Same face.

But the eyes… Gone. Two black pits that swallowed the screen. Not just blank—hungry.

And the mouth. It stretched wide. Too wide. The grin was unnatural, full of teeth that didn’t belong to me. Long. Sharp. Smiling like it knew exactly what I feared.

Then, slowly, my reflection—my fake self—tilted its head. Like a curious dog trying to understand the noise of a dying animal.

And it raised one finger to its lips.

Shhh.

That was all. No movement. No sound.

Just silence and that horrific, knowing grin.

I stared. I couldn’t not. My breath caught in my throat, and I could feel tears starting behind my eyes—not from fear. From recognition.

Some part of me… knew.

Then, in a blink, it vanished.

I didn’t wait for protocol. Didn’t wait for Ellis. Didn’t wait to see what the rules would demand next.

I packed my bag with shaking hands, every zipper scream echoing through the metal halls like alarms. Then I walked to the helipad and sat down.

I didn’t move. Didn’t think. Just waited—like a body waiting for burial.

Eventually, the chopper emerged from the horizon—its blades slicing the sky like they were trying to escape it too.

The pilot landed but said nothing at first. He just looked at me. Then at the facility. Then back at me.

His face was grim. Like he’d done this before. Too many times.

Then he asked one question.

“You followed the rules?”

I nodded once.

He stared at me a moment longer. Then said:

“Then don’t talk about what you saw. Not to anyone. Ever.”

The flight back felt unreal.

Outside the window, the facility stretched endlessly—just blank whiteness swallowing the world. And Black Hollow shrank into the distance, disappearing into the nothing like a dream you’re glad to forget… but never really do.

I didn’t speak. And neither did the pilot.

Because there are no words for what we left behind. Only rules.

That was two years ago.

I tried to build a life again. A job. An apartment. People. Structure. Routine.

But some nights, I still wake up. Always at the same time.

3:03 a.m.

And when I do, I never look directly in the mirror right away.

Because once—just once—I did.

And I saw myself… blink.

But I hadn’t blinked.

That thing in the mirror— it blinked first.

Now I keep the lights on at night. I follow little rituals. I whisper rules under my breath before bed.

Just in case.

Because sometimes…

I wonder if I ever really left Black Hollow. Or if Black Hollow just… followed me.

Some places don’t want to be left behind. And some rules aren’t meant to be broken— because they’re the only thing keeping you from being replaced.",2,1751436143.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Cheryl Jenner was born again.

She was reborn on the same day her parents asked her to choose one of the heirs from the top three families in Southstead to marry, and thus, form an alliance with their family.

Without even a second thought, Cheryl shook her head and said, ""I'm not choosing any of the three.""

Cheryl's parents, Francis Jenner and Meredith Branson, were shocked. ""Why not?""

""Because…""

Cheryl felt a sharp pain in her chest.

Because she had married all three of them in her past life.

…

Everyone in the circle knew that the Kingsleys, the Thomsons, the Laurents, and the Jenners were the top four richest and most influential families in Southstead.

Cheryl was the only heiress among the other heirs of those families. Thus, the Kingsleys, the Thomsons, and the Laurents were very interested in having her as their daughter-in-law so that their families could form business alliances.

In Cheryl's past life, the first person she chose to marry was Leon Kingsley, the Kingsleys' heir. She had been over the moon when she made her choice, sure that she would live happily for the rest of her life.

However, after getting married, Leon wouldn't be home 364 days out of the 365 days each year. That caused Cheryl to become the laughingstock of the elite circle. More than that, Leon even lost his life protecting Giselle Brussel from a terrible car accident.

Cheryl was still very young when she became widowed. Thus, her family arranged for her to marry Zane Thomson, heir to the Thomson family, three years later.

However, Zane never thought much about his marriage to Cheryl.

He treated her like she was invisible. In the second year of their marriage, Zane was killed in an illegal car race to the death, for Giselle's sake, once again.

From then on, Cheryl earned the reputation of being an unlucky person who would bring death upon her husbands.

It wasn't until she turned 30 years old that she married Steve Laurent, the heir to the Laurent family.

This time, they treated each other civilly and lived a normal life until old age. However, just before Steve died of old age, he held Cheryl's hands and said his final wish.

""Cheryl, if there's an afterlife, or if we could go back in time… I wish to only be with Giselle Brussel.""

It was only then that Cheryl discovered all three of the heirs were in love with Giselle. So, every last wish from Leon, Zane, and Steve was that she not choose them again if there were a second chance at life.

Meanwhile, Giselle Brussel was only the daughter of the butler working at the Jenner mansion, Aaron Brussel. She didn't look outstandingly beautiful and had no talent in anything at all other than knowing how to act weak and helpless around others.

Cheryl didn't know how she couldn't even measure up to Giselle. She also didn't know why the three heirs were so in love with Giselle that they would willingly get married to Cheryl, one after another, just so that Giselle wouldn't end up being used as a scapegoat by their families.

Cheryl had spent her entire life witnessing just how devoted the three heirs were to Giselle, and that had made one thing very clear—she refused to play second fiddle to someone else's life.

If those people weren't interested in her, she would rather do without them at all.

So, in this life, she decided that she wasn't going with any of the three heirs. Instead, she told her parents about the fourth choice.

""If you want me to form a marriage alliance with someone, then the only person I'm willing to marry is Dylan Sterling of the Sterling family.""

Francis and Meredith were in utter disbelief when they heard the name rolling off Cheryl's tongue.

""Dylan Sterling? That bastard child of the Sterlings in Northdale? But why would you suddenly think of marrying him?""

That was because in her last life, Dylan had ended up number one on Forbes' list of richest billionaires in the world, and he was the greatest authority to have ever lived during his lifetime.

If the main objective of Cheryl's marriage was to ally with her husband's family, then, of course, she was going to go big and not go home. She would do what was most beneficial for her family.

Dylan Sterling was undoubtedly the safest choice of all.

As for love… Cheryl no longer harbored any hope for it.

So, no matter how her parents objected to her decision, she did her very best to try and convince them that she was making the right choice.

""The economy in Northdale has been rising aggressively, and Sterling Group, manned by the Sterling family, is the oldest, most established, and wealthiest company out there.

""Haven't you been thinking about expanding into Northdale, but weren't able to because you lacked the network and resources required there? Don't you think it would be a huge opportunity for the family if I were to marry him?

""Also, it's not like you haven't surveyed Dylan before. You said that he was very ambitious, aggressive, and had a keen eye for business. You also said that he would achieve great heights in the business world…""

Francis and Meredith gradually got persuaded by the points Cheryl made.

After debating about it for a while, they finally decided to respect their daughter's wishes and got in contact with the Sterling family, confirming the wedding alliance between both families.

""Cheryl, we've already discussed everything with the Sterlings and agreed to hold the wedding in two weeks.""

Cheryl felt as though a weight had been lifted off her shoulders when she heard what her parents said.

Since the timeline was quite tight, Francis and Meredith hurried off to make all the necessary wedding preparations. Meanwhile, Cheryl just sat down on the couch in a daze. Too many thoughts were swirling in her head, and her emotions were also all over the place.

A while later, the sound of footsteps could be heard coming from the door.

Leon, Zane, and Steve all barged into the living room, their gazes landing squarely on Cheryl.

""Cheryl! Who did you choose to marry?""

Cheryl was caught completely off-guard when the trio suddenly appeared before her and asked her the same question simultaneously, anxiously waiting for her answer.

The four of them had grown up together, so they could be considered childhood friends. They weren't often seen without one another.

The three older men used to take care of her and treat her like their younger sister, spoiling her rotten under their care. They would almost always fulfill her whims and wishes. If she were unhappy, they would spoil her with gifts. If she got teased at school, they would immediately stand up for her.

However, now that Cheryl had a clearer picture of everything, she realized that these were just evidence that they simply treated her like their younger little sister—nothing more, nothing less.

In her past life, they had also been extremely anxious to know her answer. Cheryl thought that it was because they were hopeful and wanted to be chosen.

But now, she finally understood that they were anxious because they didn't want to be the chosen one. That was the only reason for the troubled looks on their faces right now.

At this thought, she felt a surge of bitterness in her heart. It made her so uncomfortable that she could barely breathe.

After calming herself down for a bit, she collected herself and said in a hoarse voice, ""You'll find out in 15 days.""

The three young men were restless when they realized Cheryl wasn't going to give them a straight answer. They just needed to know at once.

However, before any of them could say a word, Cheryl's phone suddenly rang loudly in her hand.

""Ms. Jenner! Giselle got into an accident on the road and is terribly injured! She's at the emergency ward in the hospital now, but they say there aren't any empty wards to put her in. Can you please help us? Please, save my daughter!""

When Leon heard Aaron's voice on the phone, he immediately grabbed it from Cheryl and asked worriedly, ""Which hospital?""

There were a few seconds of silence from the other end of the line. Then, Aaron finally mumbled the hospital name.

Leon immediately hung up, excused himself, and left without another word.

""Cheryl, you don't have to bother yourself with the hospital. It's just a small matter. I'll go and handle things myself.""

Seeing this, Zane and Steve also went out after him without further thought.

""The hospital he mentioned is a subsidiary of my family's company. I'll go and talk to the hospital dean. Cheryl, just stay home and rest.""

""I know a few famous doctors and physicians as well. I'll go and contact them. You don't have to worry about a thing, Cheryl.""

They all said it as though they were doing this for Cheryl's sake, but she knew very well that those were just excuses to visit Giselle.

It was so obvious that they were in love with Giselle. Just why hadn't Cheryl realized a thing in her past life?

She let out a self-deprecating laugh when she saw how quickly those three left her behind.

She then turned around and went back to her bedroom, face grim, and started pulling out everything that was even remotely related to the trio.

By the time she was done, it was already dark out. She turned on her phone and immediately saw the Instagram story that Giselle had posted online.

""Just another day of being pampered by three young heirs.""

The accompanying photo was a selfie Giselle took in the hospital ward. She was drinking a bowl of chicken soup that Steve had brought for her. Leon's watch was on the bedside table. Finally, Zane's coat was draped over the chair next to her bed.

Cheryl double-tapped on the story, sending Giselle a like, and then stared at the three boxes before her.

In each box lay a gift that Samuel Kingsley, Alicia Addams, and Benjamin Laurent had given to her on her 18th birthday. Samuel was Leon's father, Alicia was Zane's mother, and Benjamin was Steve's grandfather.

Each gift was a precious family heirloom from each family.

Whichever gift Cheryl chose to keep would signify that she'd chosen to marry the heir from that family.

Since she had already made up her mind about which heir to marry, it was time for each of these families to know her decision.

She contacted the courier company and gave the three sealed boxes to the person who came to collect her parcels.

""Please send out these boxes to their respective addresses only after 15 days.""

Chapter 2

After sending out the parcels, Cheryl then threw everything else related to Leon, Zane, and Steve into the trash bin.

These items included jewelry sets, bags, and purses they'd bought for her, their video recordings, photos, and even their tailored suit designs that she had personally designed herself.

Everything that reminded Cheryl of them was thrown away. They were in the past now, and only deserved to be buried six feet under forever.

Cheryl wasn't going to make the same mistake again in this life.

She focused on preparing for the wedding, not even bothering about the rest of the world outside her bubble.

After busying herself for days and picking out her wedding gown and veil, Cheryl went back home and saw Leon, Zane, and Steve all huddling around Giselle on the couch.

Leon was busy fiddling with the thermostat, Zane was occupied with feeding Giselle some broth, and Steve was engaged in wrapping her up in a blanket so she wouldn't feel the cold. They all looked extremely concerned about her.

Cheryl couldn't help the flash of self-mockery that appeared in her eyes when she saw how preciously the trio were treating Giselle like a princess.

It was so obvious that they were in love with her. How could she not have picked up a clue in her past life?

Suddenly, Cheryl was awash with all sorts of emotions, with the wave of bitterness being the dominant one, making it hard for her to breathe again.

Giselle caught sight of Cheryl while she was still spacing out. She immediately jumped to her feet and looked both scared and respectful of her at the same time.

""Y-You're back, Ms. Jenner. I'll go and fetch you a glass of warm water at once and prepare dinner for you. Please wait for a while.""

She then turned to leave, but Leon quickly pulled her back onto the couch.

""Gigi hasn't fully recovered yet. It's not like you don't have other maids around the house. Cheryl, next time, let someone else handle small tasks like these.""

Zane and Steve also chimed in, ""Gigi badly hurt this time. Cheryl, you should just let her rest next time.""

""Yes. If you don't have enough maids at home, just tell us. We can always lend you some of our maids. Don't order Gigi around anymore.""

Cheryl had not even said a single word ever since coming home, and yet, she was already blamed for so many things.

She sighed softly, her eyes dimming slightly. ""I know that she's just my butler's daughter and not my maid. I have never forced her to do anything.

""Since you're all so concerned about her, why don't you bring her to your home so that you can take better care of her? You wouldn't have to worry about losing sight of her then, and she wouldn't have to be afraid.""

Giselle immediately widened her eyes and fell to the ground on her knees, begging, ""I'm sorry, Ms. Jenner! It's all my fault! I shouldn't have become so lazy after falling sick! Can you please not chase me or my dad away? I'll go and finish up the chores at once!""

She cried so hard that her face was a wet and snotty mess, as if she'd just been told that her favorite pet dog had died.

As soon as they saw the tears in Giselle's eyes, Leon, Zane, and Steve immediately grew grim. They hurriedly picked Giselle up from the ground and shielded her behind them. Then, they glared at Cheryl and spoke angrily to her.

""Gigi did nothing wrong! How could you just chase her away for nothing? Must you bully a young and defenseless little girl like this?""

""She's already so badly injured, and you seriously still want her to wait on you hand and foot? It's bad enough that you're not even concerned about her health—now you want to chase her out of the house too? Can't you show her some empathy?""

""Her injuries are getting worse because of you! If she forces herself to work even though she doesn't feel well next time, you'll drive her into despair! Are you finally going to be happy if something terrible happens to her?""

When Cheryl saw how much the trio was protecting Giselle, her face also hardened.

""I did absolutely nothing but mention that you're free to bring her home with you. And you call that bullying? So, I'm just a bossy, arrogant, and self-centered bitch in your eyes? Are you going to pin the blame on me every single time she feels unhappy? Is that it?""

The living room turned quiet at Cheryl's heated questions.

She felt helpless and at a loss for what to do when she saw the stunned looks on the trio's faces.

Not wanting to speak anymore, she just turned and went back to her bedroom.

Just as she'd managed to calm herself down, Giselle came knocking at her door with a cup of coffee. She wore a scared, sheepish look on her face.

""I'm sorry, Ms. Jenner. Don't get mad at those three anymore. They only said such things at that time because they were so concerned about me. It's my fault that you guys argued. If you must blame someone, then you should blame me.""

After her experience in her past life, Cheryl knew that Giselle was just pretending to make peace with her when she was trying to rile up the situation even further. So, Cheryl didn't respond to her.

""Put the coffee down and get out of my room.""

Giselle felt even more wronged when she heard Cheryl's icy tone. However, she didn't dare say anything else.

She then purposely spilled the coffee all over Cheryl's arm and pretended that it was an accident.

The hot coffee scalded the entirety of Cheryl's body, giving her first degree burns as blisters quickly surfaced on her skin.

Cheryl let out a low grunt and pushed Giselle away, who had grabbed some napkins and rushed forward to ""help"".

However, Giselle took advantage of the situation and fell backward, knocking her head against the table behind her. Blood began to pour from the wound at once.

Giselle started screaming in pain, her shrill voice piercing through the entire mansion.

Before Cheryl had even realized what had happened, Leon, Zane, and Steve had all kicked her room door open and barged right in.

They panicked when they saw Giselle out cold on the floor, her head dripping with blood.

Zane immediately roughly shoved Cheryl aside, who was in the way, while Leon rushed up to Giselle and picked her up from the floor. Steve quickly came up and pressed his hand against the wound on her head.

The three of them then ran out of the room with Giselle in their arms.

Nobody stayed to check on Cheryl, who had been shoved so hard that she hit her body against the glass display case. It shattered and rained showers of glass all over her body, leaving painful cuts everywhere on her skin.

Blood seeped through Cheryl's clothes. She was in so much pain that she curled into a ball on the ground, unable to stop herself from shaking.

As the trio's silhouettes gradually disappeared, Cheryl couldn't hold it back anymore as tears began streaming down her face.

Her heart ached so much that she couldn't even bear it anymore. She bit down harshly on her lips, determined not to let a single sob escape her.

There was only one thought left in her mind.

She wanted to break away from the world that the three of them lived. She never wanted to have anything to do with them ever again.

Chapter 3

Cheryl gritted her teeth and bore with the pain as she went to the hospital to get her wounds treated. She then took the prescription from the doctor and went to the in-house pharmacy to get her medication.

It was right then that she bumped into a few familiar silhouettes at the ward next door.

Leon, Zane, and Steve were waiting anxiously inside Giselle's ward, their eyes filled with pity.

""I told you guys earlier! Gigi's a poor, defenseless little thing. She'll only continue getting mistreated as long as she lives under the Jenners' roof. Once Cheryl's chosen her marriage alliance partner, we'll have to think of a way to get Giselle out, no matter what. I don't want to see her hurt ever again.""

""If our parents find out that the actual person we're in love with is Gigi, we must do everything in our power to ensure her safety. So, whoever Cheryl picks must agree to the marriage without protest. That's the only way our families will spare Gigi's life.""

Cheryl watched them, feeling a sharp pain pierce right through her heart.

So, this was the reason why they had all agreed to marry her in her past life, even though they obviously didn't love her.

They were willing to sacrifice their happiness to protect the one they truly loved.

But in doing that, they had completely ruined her life.

Cheryl lowered her head and laughed until tears trickled down her face.

However, they didn't have to worry about anything this time. None of them would need to sacrifice anything.

After collecting herself, Cheryl wiped away the tears in her eyes and turned to leave. But just then, her phone alarm clock rang.

The sudden noise startled the trio inside, and they immediately came out to have a look. They were surprised to see Cheryl outside.

""What are you doing here? Did you come to apologize to Gigi?""

""How long have you been here? How much of that did you hear?""

""Why do you have so many cuts on your body? What happened?""

As the trio fired questions at her, one after another, Cheryl made sure to answer each one.

""My cuts came about because you guys shoved me against the glass to save Giselle. I came to the hospital to get the wounds treated. I'm not here to apologize.

""She was the one who first dumped hot coffee over my body, and I pushed her away. As for meeting you guys here, it was nothing but a coincidence.""

After hearing what really happened, the trio was stunned for a long moment. The look in their eyes turned murky.

They recalled how they'd barged into Cheryl's room after hearing someone scream and the events that unfolded after. Zane, the impatient one, spoke up first.

""Gigi didn't mean to spill the coffee on you. It only happened because she was hurt, and she didn't have enough strength in her hands. Don't hold it against her.

""We only kind of lost our heads when we rushed in and saw blood all over the floor. We thought that her life was in danger. Sorry 'bout that.""

Leon also calmed down and said, ""We didn't mean to pin the blame on you earlier, either. We just felt sorry for Gigi and spoke up for her.""

""That's right. We all grew up together. You know that you're the most important person in our hearts. So, have you thought about who you'll pick as your marriage alliance partner?""

Steve spoke last, and after he was done, the three of them looked anxiously at Cheryl.

When Cheryl saw their reaction, she recalled what she'd heard from the trio's conversation earlier and couldn't help thinking that it was simply ridiculous.

""I have. I've made up my mind. The three of you—""

Before Cheryl could finish, the monitor in the ward started beeping loudly all of a sudden.

Leon, Zane, and Steve felt their hearts nearly leap up their throats. As if in a trance, they turned to look into the ward at the same time as doctors and nurses rushed in.

""The patient's kidney has been further damaged after the last injury. We never noticed that before and used the wrong medication on her, so now her kidneys are rapidly failing. Her life is in great danger!""

Leon's eyes reddened as soon as he heard the doctor's diagnosis.

""What the fuck are you people even doing? How could you use the wrong medication on her? Gigi's still very young! Can you even bear the consequences if her life is ruined because of you bunch of idiots who can't even do your jobs right?""

Zane then grabbed the main doctor by his coat collar and growled at him in pure fury, ""You have exactly half an hour to come up with a 100% foolproof plan to save her. If anything bad happens to Gigi, I swear to god, I will make you pay!""

Meanwhile, Steve kept calling people on his phone, one after another, like a madman on a quest.

""Dr. Keith Jameson! You're the top nephrologist in the country. I would like to ask you to save someone very important. Where are you now? I'll send my secretary to get you.""

The ward was practically on fire, with the doctors, nurses, and the trio getting frantic over Giselle's condition.

In no time at all, the hospital put together a team of top experts on nephrology and came out with the most effective, lowest-risk treatment option.

""The only way to save her now is a kidney transplant. However, it's going to take a while for us to find a suitable donor. The longer the patient has to wait, the more dangerous her condition will be.""

Chapter 4

As soon as the treatment option was devised, Leon, Zane, and Steve immediately went for a donor compatibility test.

The results were out very soon. As it turned out, Leon's kidney was a perfect match for Giselle.

When the doctor walked in with the consent form for the surgery, Leon immediately grabbed a pen and signed his name on the line before walking into the operating room.

Seconds ticked by, then minutes, then hours. Just as everyone was at the height of their anxiousness, a new problem presented itself.

A nurse ran out, her tone panicked and urgent.

""We have a shortage of blood in the hospital. The patient needs a lot of blood for transfusion right now.""

Zane and Steve, who had been waiting at the door, immediately rolled back their sleeves and said, ""We have the same blood type as Gigi. We can donate blood to her!""

""But the patient has already lost a lot of blood. Neither of you will be able to give enough blood. It's better if you can gather more people to help.""

""There's not enough time to find other people. Both of us are enough. Take as much blood as is needed as long as Gigi is saved!""

The nurse couldn't win over their arguments. So, she could only lead them into the blood transfusion center.

The red light outside the operating room kept flashing nonstop, blurring Cheryl's vision.

She had witnessed everything from the moment Giselle's health had acted up until the part where Zane and Steve went to donate blood on the spot for her. Her mind was currently drawing a blank.

In her past life, Cheryl hadn't been at the scene when both Leon and Zane lost their lives. She only found out what had happened to them afterward.

At the time, she had been deeply grief-stricken. She just couldn't understand why they would be so willing to give up their lives to save Giselle.

But now, after everything that had happened, Cheryl finally understood why.

It was simply because they were in love with Giselle. They were so deeply in love with her that they were willing to give up everything for her.

It didn't matter if it was their marriage or their own lives at stake—they had rushed in without hesitation as one event happened after another.

That was why Cheryl had never been able to beat Giselle at her game.

Luckily, in her second life, Cheryl had already made up her mind to give up on them. She refused to be stuck in their pitiful love quadrangle anymore.

The red light outside the operating room finally stopped flashing and went out. The doctor finally came out through the doors, wiping his sweat away.

""Are you family? The operation was a success, and the patient will wake up soon. However, the person who donated his kidney needs to stay in the ICU for a while longer. The two people in the transfusion room have also passed out after donating too much blood. Are you able to take care of all four of them?""

Cheryl shook her head. Her lips were dry and chapped as she said in a hoarse voice, ""I have no relations whatsoever to the four people involved. But I can inform their family members about this. They'll be here very soon.""

Right after that, Cheryl sent a text message to the Kingsleys, the Thomsons, the Laurents, and Aaron, informing them of the operation.

I could have written a novel about your eyes and volumes of work about our relationship. i could’ve wondered for years as to why you left. I could’ve beg every higher power to give us a second chance. I could’ve have pleaded with the universe for a response from you. Just to give you a chance to say sorry. 

The outcome remains the same. You abandoned me when I needed you the most and you felt no guilt or remorse about it. If you did, you would have reached out in the months since we last spoke. You would have made it right.

I know how much I meant to you. While I don’t yearn for you anymore, and while I no longer wish I could wake up to your scent wrapped around me. Or no longer fantasize about a quiet life we could have had together; you making coffee while I play piano in the morning, and the thousands of boring days we would spend together. I know now that it wasn’t what you wanted. Because I wasn’t what you wanted. They say when you know you know, and while I knew … you didn’t. And it’s no one’s fault, I just needed to accept it. 

And while I would have never treated you the way you did me, I’m no longer angry. In fact, I pity you. I feel sorry for you because you have to live with you. Even if you do remember me, which I doubt you do, you really don’t know me anymore. 

And this letter is not payback or punishment, it’s me pointing out the obvious. You built a cage around yourself. You’ll always chase the one thing you always lacked. So much so that you betrayed me to get it only for it to slip from your fingers after a few short months. 

Again, I could waste lifetimes trying to figure out your reasoning. I’m okay with meaning nothing to you because I no longer love a coward. Just because you meant everything to me, I am not entitled to your kindness. 

I knew the man I loved and I don’t know the one who left. But that’s good enough for me.

1lpnxlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/gayrelationships/comments/1lpnxlo/should_i_unblock_him/,Should I unblock him?,"It’s almost been 7 months since the breakup and 6 months since I blocked him (we were meant to meet for brunch and he bailed because I confronted him about something…so he got scared). For background: 

(Post from when it happened ⬇️)

He “tried” to cheat, I got angry and the focus is now on my reaction (not taking any accountability for his “attempt” at cheating)?

So my boyfriend (M, 30) and I (M, 25) have recently separated. A few weeks ago, he Snapchatted me while he was at work and they came through on a 3 sec timer. I asked him why and he said that his phone overheated/glitched so maybe it was that - when I challenged him on this, he told me that he would never lie to me again (will get to that) because he knows how much he hurt me. I sat up until close to 3am waiting for him to get home because he suggested we get food together. He got home, we didn’t get food, went to bed and he was all over me. Then he came clean…apparently earlier that morning (while I was on a zoom call with my therapist in the next room), he decided to take a photo of his ass to send to some straight guy he’s been pining over for years. He says that he didn’t send it, but I don’t believe him. We stayed up for hours arguing, crying and going through every emotion possible. 

The next day, he dropped me at my friends house for a party - on the drive there he was holding my hand, telling me he loved me and to message if I need a lift home. Later in the night, I said I thought I would stay with my friends…he said all was good and he was going to go and stay with his family. He then wouldn’t answer my calls or texts, when I got home, I found that he’d already packed a bag and laptop (so had organised it all before he even went to work). I was quite drunk (not an excuse), but I told him how selfish, inconsiderate and avoidant he is. When he eventually picked up, I roared at him on the phone and said I would come to him (which I know was bad). He was incredibly dismissive (and I’ve since found out that his sister was sitting next to him, recording and also telling him what to say).

I ordered myself some food to soak up the alcohol and amongst the chaos, forgot my keys. So I continued to try and call him and get let it - He eventually turned off his phone and ignored my calls + texts…so I sat on the pavement from 3am in the morning until about 8am when his family brought his set of keys over and let me in. He then proceeded to give me the run around for days (told me he was coming home, then he wasn’t, then after Christmas). So I broke up with him - every time we have discussed it, he has made it entirely about my reaction to the news and taken zero accountability for his actions. 

Previously, he’s lied about multiple things involving his ex - four months into our relationship I had to ask him to unfollow the ex’s alt twitter + ask him to stop sending nudes. He’s also lied about the ex contacting him and about an item he picked up for me when we were dating (but gave to the ex and lied about multiple times over the course of 14 months). 

He never deleted his dating profiles (only the apps) and we’ve had multiple discussions about sex/pornography. He outed me as trans to his friends at a wedding we went to (called me over to tell his friend what scar cream I used and show my scars - and when I asked for space afterwards because I was upset, he and his sister continued to follow me). 

Despite all of these things, I still blame myself. If I hadn’t of gotten angry, if I had’ve gone for a walk instead of trying to solve things then and there. Maybe I was being unrealistic or asking for too much? I thought by cooking, cleaning, washing all of his clothes, adjusting my schedule to come to his gigs and doing more things he liked it would fix things - clearly not.

I’ve spent the last week and a half beating on myself about how this relationship falling apart has been my fault and how much I just want him back. Because he can be incredibly kind, sweet, caring, thoughtful and loving - it was only when I lost my job about six months ago we started to fight more (he has said that my loss of employment/arguing with insurance agencies and Centrelink has caused him stress…and that’s part of why he did what he did). 

He came over a few weeks ago and we slept together, he told me he loves me and how he’s missed me. How some of his clothes still smell like me and how he’s jerked off to the thought of us - I have no idea what is going on, what is coming next and what to make of everything that is going on/has already happened. I don’t know how to move forward when I’m still in love with this man (as I understand the why behind his actions is largely linked to unhealed trauma). It breaks my heart, because he has hurt me so bad (but I know that’s only because he has a lot of unhealed hurt himself). 

I’ve also found out that he was using the app for a toy we bought together to sext other people… 

Most recently, he tried telling me how low he has been feeling and how he was contemplating suicide and ended up self harming. I’ve cut all contact, unfriended and unfollowed him on everything - we were meant to meet for coffee, but when I confronted him about some of his shitty behaviour, he came up with some bullshit excuse about how his parents needed help with their kitchen renovations because “there were bricks where there weren’t meant to be bricks”. Lol, okay avoidant. 

I feel absolutely horrible for cutting him off, I’m so saddened by the idea of never speaking to him again and am worried about the next time I see him out. I’m also really scared that he’s going to end up taking his life or seriously hurting himself - I don’t want him to not be on this earth anymore 😔

I was the first to get three strikes, so I tried to just stay optimistic about it and accept my fate. 

However, as the date approaches, I’ve become more and more concerned with how humiliating this would be. I’m still pretty new to the job and to the company, and I’m the youngest person in my office. I’m worried about the kind of attention I’d be getting from the higher ups and all of the serious, no none sense middle-aged supervisors (some of whom are my assigned mentors). 

I’ve been considering just talking to my boss to let her know that I refuse to participate, but I’m worried about starting conflict with her or the rest of the department. Basically, if I refuse to perform,  it would make me look bad to the department, but if I go along with it, then I’m humiliating myself in front of the people who have my career in their hands, people who I haven’t made any impression on yet.

 Here's my story nung ako ay Close-In Security ng isang Dating Mayamang Negosyante...
 (Please read)
 
Madalas Makasama ng aking Dating Mayamang Boss ang Isang Magandang Sexy Model Actress na  Pasikat pa lamang na nagpapainit sa mga Kalalakihan During her rise to fame from 2016 until before the pandemic. Madalas Bumisita sa Dalawang Luxury Condo Unit / Pent House si Sexy Model Actress (Makati or BGC)ng pagmamay-ari aking Dating Mayamang Boss .  She was a stunningly beautiful and sexy model and actress, with porcelain-like skin, and a particular favorite of my former boss.  (masasabi Kong sya ay Paboritong Bisita or iniimbitahan ni Boss)  
Halos Year 2017 na sya Bumibisita hanggang Bago at Patapos na ang Pandemic 🤤☕😉
 
Si Sexy Model Actress ay madalas Bumisita sa luxury condo unit in Makati and BGC (na pagmamay ari ng Aking Boss), and even luxury hotels like Okada and Solaire.  (Even though she had a boyfriend at the time), these visits were ostensibly for coffee and conversation(Kwentuhan lang daw at Kape☕💦😋 .Kapag Darating sya (Si Sexy ModeI Actress )I was often tasked with meeting her in the lobby, handing her key card to her PA, and escorting her to the elevator. (She usually had a gay companion who would remain in the lobby—likely her manager or handler.)
 
After her visits, and as she was leaving, I was often instructed by one of my former boss's assistants to delete copies of the CCTV footage or Indoor Cam from inside the luxury unit in BGC or Makati (dahil mainit na at Nakakahalata yung Misis ng aming Dating Boss). Before deleting the footage, I'd naturally watch it first(habang tumitigas ang Junjun ko, sometimes even saving clips to my phone (though my phone is broken now, recovery might be possible).  She was captivating to watch, even just sitting on the sofa sa Living Room Area(kahit kwentuhan lang sila ni Boss with Coffee and Wine🍾☕🤤  She often wore simple jeans (Maong na Kupas minsan and flowery Korean dresses, sometimes a black and pink combination na Bistida)
(Hindi ko na alam ang mg susunod na pangyayari kapag pumasok sila sa Master Bdr-1&2 sapagkat wala na or hindi na abot ang Indoor/Security Cam dun hanggang sa labas lang ng pintuan bago sila pumasok sa Mahiwangan Room or Master BDR-1&2)
 
Mahinhin at Maingat din si BeautifuI Sexy Actress minsan ayaw nya Nagpapahawak kung saan saan iniiwasan minsan ang kamay ni boss or naiilang lang siguro si Girl (Hanggang Hair at beywang minsan sa Tuhod ang nahahawakan ni Boss Base  sa napapanood ko sa Indoor Cam bago ko burahin ang Kopya or Footage ewan ko lang kapag pumasok na sila sa Master BDR-1 After Magbihis or magpalit na parang Sexy Outfit ni Girl ha .. wala na kasi nka install na Indoor Cam. dun sa Area na yun🤔🤤)

I estimate that some visits ni Beauty Sexy Actress Model kay Boss sa Loob ng Unit is lasted six hours or more, sometimes until morning.  When the assistant asked me to get her extra ""decent"" t-shirts, supposedly for changes,(ibig sabihin dun sya magpapalipas ng Gabi)(Minsan ako din ang Pumipick-up sa isang High-end Mall sa mga susuoting Sexy Outfit ni Girl naka box na agad kapag kukunin ko) I'd place them on the sofa of Luxury Unit ni Boss Bago dumating si Beautiful Sexy Model Actress.

 However, when I checked the box, they were often sexy nighties or lingerie, including expensive bras (size D-cup)(Sinisilip ko syempre yung mamahalin at Malalaking Sizes ng Bra including Nighties or Lingerie siguro yun at Body  Liquid Soap na nilalagay sa Bathub hehe), at pinapadispose or pinapatapon din kaagad ni Boss yung mga mamahaling Sexy Outfits pagkatapos bumisita ni Sexy Model Actress Ako nmn ay Inaamoy ko muna or minsan ay Tinatago ko sa aking Locker kasama yung mga Lotion.hehe (Amoy Mamahaling Parfume) (Sarap Amuyin ng Damit na pinaghubaran ni Ms.Beautiful Sexy Actress
 The food was sometimes slightly diminished, but the expensive alcohol and wine were untouched; she didn't drink (hindi talaga uniinom kahit anong klaseng alak si Sexy Actress Model).Bukod sa Napaka ganda at sexy ay Napaka bait (kahit may konting retoke or pinagawa sa katawan),Si Sexy Actress walang nirerequest na mamahaling Luxury Items Like Bags etc. kay Former Boss kapag sila ay nagkikita sa Unit (hindi sya katulad ng ibang girls na Maluho)
 
I remember that whenever our former wealthy boss learned of sexy photos posted by the actress on IG and FB, or if she had suggestive segments in her shows, he'd get angry. He'd immediately call her, and if she didn't answer, her handler would be contacted to have the pictures taken down.
(Si Boss ang nagbabawal din sakanya na magsuot ng Sexy damit at huwag litaw ang Cleavege)

 I believe this is why she broke up with her boyfriend at the time ( Nabalitaan kasi ni Former Boss na Nag Lilive in sila Sexy Actress at Kanyang BF)and why she stopped doing sexy roles and posting sexy content on social media for several years.  (kontralado ni boss nung mga panahon na yun pati yung Real Life BF ni Ate Girl)
 
Now, however, she's back to being sexy, Nagpapainit ulit sa mga Barako sa pamamagitan ng Social Media Post. Haha.
(Pero kung nandyan pa siguro si Boss at mayaman pa ay magagalit na namn panigurado yun at ipapabura nya)
 
I can say that she was one of our former wealthy boss's favorites (dahil napakabait nmn talaga), as she was the only one I saw visiting his luxury unit or penthouse sa BGC or Makati 
 (yung iba kasing mga Models na inuuwi or iniimbitahan ay hanggang sa mga Orinary Condo lang nya sa Pasay Malapit sa Resorts World at Mariot pero High-end din or minsan sa OKADA,SOLAIRE & Shangrila the fort) ni Boss .
 Sometimes, kaming mga security personnel would even escort her home to her village in Quezon City.(Hatid Sundo pa at Alam din naming mga Close-In Security na ang Dating Boss namin ang Nagpagawa ng Bahay ni Sexy Model Actress  sa isang Exclusive Village na yun sa QC kung saan namin sya madalas ihatid)(Hindi naman masyado High-End yung Village)
 
Clue:
 
  1.   Miss Beautiful Sexy Actress – Still appears on television, but now in action roles at bumalik ulit sa pagpapa sexy sa kanyang Social Media Post.

(Mahuhulaan ninyo sa pamamagitan ng mga Blurred na Kunwari ay Lumang Larawan na isesend ko thru PM )
 
  2.   My Former Wealthy Boss – Luge na sya ngayon maraming Utang sa Bangko

>Someone from another group asked me to post this here. I lost my Pokemon GO plus at home about a week ago. I always sleep with it next to me so that it spins the stops while I’m sleeping. I woke up about a week ago and it was gone. I thought it fell. I looked under the bed under the table in the bathroom. I looked everywhere. I couldn’t find it so this morning at work I had to go into my stockroom to grab some coffee. I heard a single click just a small click And when I look down there is my Pokémon GO you see me stand there for about 20 seconds just mind blown I have no idea where it came from or how it got there. This video is me recording the monitors of the security cameras at work. I have not doctored this footage at all

>Pokemon go plus. It spins pokestops and catches Pokemon for you! I live at a pokestop so I can turn it on and go to sleep and wake up with a bag full of items. I Love it.

>It never connected to my phone while it was gone.

>And for people thinking it fell from me somehow, which I just don’t think is possible, this thing had been gone for over a week. I’ve worn and washed these clothes several times in that time. And the device was working perfectly so it had no been washed, but anyway, wouldn’t I have heard that? Or wouldn’t you see SOME type of movement in the video? My leg blocks the screen for the tiniest split second and then it’s just there. It’s not and then it is.

>A lot of people thinking I doctored this. I want you to note the time on the video and the time I took the video on my phone. I have an even earlier video but I cuss on it. A LOT lol.

>I know not everyone is going to believe this. If it didn’t happen in my face I wouldn’t. But I promise this is evenly what happened. And there is no chance it was stuck in my close. I wore those pants the entire day before and that day. And the thing didn’t get washed, it’s in perfect working order. I lost it AT HOME over a week ago. There’s just no way it was in my clothes and I would know if it fell from me. But that’s not what happened.

>That’s what I’m saying. If it fell out of my clothes like people are suggesting, could it really have fallen, rolled a good foot away from me and landed perfect still in the split second my leg covers the screen?

>I can absolutely take a video further back showing the time stamps better.

>here is the first video I took of it when I was showing it to a coworker. You can see the time stamps better

>I promise it’s not for attention! I will gladly take a video of the whole screen at work to show this is absolutely raw footage. This 1,000% happened just the way you see it in the video.

>I didn’t take any offense! I know this is an absolutely INSANE video and story. It’s actually driving me crazy though and I would Love for there to be an explanation besides time jump haha. I liked my timeline.

>I don’t. It never connected to my phone while it was gone.

>Tomorrow I will take full footage of the minutes leading up to this. It will show I absolutely did not do this. I wish so bad there was another angle!!

I decided against it, reasoning that my apartment bathroom (in a building just around the corner from the coffee shop) would be cleaner and smell better.

When I entered the apartment, bladder full, I realized the light in the bathroom was on, meaning it was occupied by my roommate. I waited for a few seconds but then heard a rumbling mechanical noise coming from inside, meaning she was doing some task that would not be complete in the length of a normal bathroom trip.

My guess was machine-aided deep cleaning, potentially of the decades-old bathtub. She also could have been using her water flosser (her aged teeth are rotting and causing her pain that she frequently complains about.)

The last time she was in the bathroom when I urgently had to pee, I waited an indeterminable amount of time before knocking on the door. She opened it deliriously while still sitting on the toilet, totally nude, her wrinkled pink body and enlarged stomach visible through the crack in the door. 

I decided it was best not to risk getting another UTI. 

I considered peeing in the kitchen sink, but the thought of her leaving the bathroom and immediately seeing me balancing my ass in the basin where she rinses her fruit and cleans her dishes was too humiliating.

I walked back down the hall to my room, which I scanned for supplies. I eyed an empty 1.5L plastic water bottle, but the bottle-cap opening felt too small to aim my urethra at. I also had a 32oz water bottle with a wide mouth, and that felt more realistic, but I drank water out of it regularly and the thought of sterilizing it from the bacteria in my piss was not appealing. Finally, I laid eyes on a gallon sized ziploc bag. 

I dropped my corduroys and panties to the floor and crouched over the bag. I held it steady and begged my brain to accept the subpar conditions and release the stream of piss it was holding in. When it finally came out, the flow was largely controlled, with only one or two warm drops bouncing off the inside of the plastic bag and hitting my bare feet. The rest of the stream flowed calmly down to the bottom of the bag, which I then drained the extra air from and sealed. The bag was warm, and it fogged up while I wiped myself with a paper towel that I threw in my bedroom’s garbage can.

Wanting to deal with the bag before my roommate emerged from the bathroom, I headed briskly to the kitchen where I dumped the piss into the sink, washing it down with a stream of scalding water from the faucet. I then washed my hands, letting the runoff soap and water clean the inside of the bag. I folded it into a neat rectangle and shoved it into the small trash can in the corner of the room. She walked out of the bathroom an indeterminable amount of time later.",0,1751433412.0,redscarepod,6,0.5,False

So do I, but here is my beef. I’ve been adamantly trying to learn everything coffee for the past 2 years. Ive watched pretty much every James Hoffman video to date plus a thousand others. I make 2-3 coffee beverages a day between pour over/ espresso/ French press/ and sometimes just a good drip coffee. 

None of it makes practical sense. I’m a science guy currently yr 3 med school so extraction theory with time and contact factoring pressure and water temp with dissolving factors all make sense and so on, but practically in the day to day I have a hard time believing it all exists. There is much conflicting information about coffee brewing and everyone claims to know the absolute truth and it’s draining lol. Which roast has more caffeine dark or light?

One guy “light has much more caffeine because it starts to evaporate off in dark roast and with the density of light roast it has more caffeine” 

next guy “well but with the porous nature of dark roast there is actually more caffeine in the drink because it’s more accessible compared to the compact nature of light roast and not being able to adequately dissolve the caffeine. It’s all about accessibility not just pure content!”

And then the whole “with dark roast you also use more bean content because it’s a lighter weight so 18g of dark roast gas has more individual beans than 18g of light” so on and so forth.

All this to say 99% (arbitrary and scientifically inaccurate but you get my point) of people taking a placebo sugar pill think it cures their back pain but the thousands of people saying 40ppm is better water than 50ppm and the difference in clarity will change your life. 

I love coffee just as much as the next guy and love nerding out about the theory but sometimes I just think none of it really exists and we are creating a pseudoscience.

Now back to loving coffee and thinking all these millions of variables matter and arguing the smallest of details like whether you wash your filter makes a difference or not.",0,1751433399.0,pourover,19,0.33,False

I have an Fiorenzato all ground on the way in a week time. 

I was gonna buy Bambino Plus (I can get it for 375 new) then get Bianca or similar in a year time when I move house. But then saw a good deal on local fb marketplace for a Rocket Apartmento for low 1k. Was thinking should I jump the gun since it’s a good bargain.

However I also saw an ECM Synchronika for high 2k. 

Both are 6 years old. ECM owner said he’s done 3500 coffees since 2019 and the machine has been sitting in the garage for the past 2 years but have it serviced every year (he can provide receipt). 

Both seller looks legit - and yes, I’ll be sure to avoid scammers since it’s been going around. 

The question remains… the ECM has all the features I wanted in Bianca. I just don’t know if getting a secondhand is a good idea or wait next year good friday and hope for a good sale? I do have it in mind even with sales I think ECM still out of budget by 1.5-2k easy 😅😅

I might be able to negotiate the ECM to mid 2k. But if not, is it still worth the older machine while newer machine altho not as superb then have newer up to date features such as fast heating time/programmable schedule etc?

It started off with me and her being on facetime and I just got done working my 9-5 as well as exercising so I decided to chill by the lake. She asked if she can come chill with me, which I say is fine but to know I have work the following day and that it is a 45 minute drive. She insist that she does not care and comes anyway.



The day comes where she have to go and I'm getting ready for work and have to take care of my two dogs. She asks me if I can put gas in her car despite me telling her beforehand I have to go to work. I kindly told her I simply wouldn't be able to but that I can send her the address of a nearby gas station that I know is cheap. She gets an attitude and was obviously upset so I suggested to get some coffee from a nearby shop that is 2 minutes away but she said no.



I now notice that there is tension but I tried to overlook it since I tend to overthink. She ignores me for the rest of the day and sends me a voice message at work saying I am selfish and only think about myself.



She mentions that I didn't have enough time to put gas in her tank but I had enough time to get some coffee. I merely suggested it after I noticed her frustration with me saying I cant get gas. She tells me her tank is low last minute instead of telling me before she drove out to see me and instead dropped it on me very last minute.



Second, I pay for everything that we do and eat. during the 6 months we have been dating she never pays for anything besides ice-cream from McDonalds one time and a cheap candle. I have no issue with her not paying for stuff but at times when I buy her food or take her out she most of the time don't even say thank you to me and I guess became use to my kind gestures. ""I also just brought her some clothes a week prior to this conversation""



I don't expect her to always remember to say thank you while eating but now that she does it so often it sometimes make me feel like I'm being used and that's all she wants me for. With this being said as she was spending the night with me prior, I also brought us food and she got very expensive items off the menu and I still brought it. So with me just buying her food I also felt that it was unfair for me to then pay for her gas.



She have now told me that she feels like she gets the bread crumbs of my time when that just simply isn't true. I told her I see her almost once every week and despite working I still make the time and effort to see her and open my availability to her. She is now saying that I don't try hard enough and that I don't focus enough time towards her.



This is frustrating because I'm trying and she does not see that. I think since she always want to hang out with me since she isn't working is effecting our relationship. What should I do?",1,1751432416.0,AmItheAsshole,18,0.57,False

⸻

It was a humid Thursday morning in the Swamp. Bart Chargeoff, the Asset Recovery Amphibian Esq. (not a lawyer), was hopping with anticipation.

His briefcase, bulging with faded green-bar printouts and coffee-stained ledgers, had just been restocked with Grade-A Charged-Off Medical Debt, purchased for 2.9 cents on the dollar from a man named “Clint” behind a shuttered vape shop.

“This batch is hot,” Clint had whispered. “Fresh out of collections. No disputes. One even has a partial billing code.”

Bart’s eyes had gleamed like compound interest.

⸻

By 8:00 a.m., he was in his office (a semi-floating mailbox duct-taped to a stump), licking envelopes and prepping lawsuits. Misspelled names? No problem. Missing signatures? Artistic license.

As he tapped out his fifth robocall script—“This is a legally required attempt to collect a debt you may or may not owe…”—a fat yellow envelope slid under his door.

Bart paused.

No return address.
No certified mail label.
Just the faint scent of… integrity?

He tore it open.

Dear Recipient,
Through the generous support of donors, your unpaid medical debt has been purchased and forgiven. You no longer owe anything.

Sincerely,
Undue Medical Debt (formerly RIP)

⸻

The world tilted.

He reread it.
Then again.
And then once more, holding it up to the light like a forged affidavit.

“No. No no no,” Bart muttered. “I own this debt. It was mine. I named it. I had a nickname for that past-due ambulance ride—‘The Slowpayer Express.’”

He frantically checked his spreadsheet.
Redacted. Zeroed out. Annotated: “Resolved by Third Party.”

“Resolved?! By whom?! I didn’t authorize this mercy!”

He let out a guttural ribbit of despair, sending a family of moss beetles scattering.

⸻

Outside, Frank the Swamp Scammer leaned on a cattail and watched with quiet amusement.

“Tough day?” he asked.

Bart looked up, defeated.

“They burned the whole portfolio. Not even a counteroffer. Just… forgiveness.”

Frank shrugged. “I told you those guys were dangerous. Next thing you know, they’ll be wiping out payday loans and teaching consumers their rights.”

“This is… anti-litigation,” Bart whispered, clutching the letter. “This is… socialism in envelope form.”

From the shadows, Mr. Hippo snorted dismissively.

“Maybe try verifying debts next time, Bartholomew.”

Bart fainted.

⸻

The moral of the story?

Sometimes, the only thing more destructive than a debt collector… is a nonprofit with a mission and actual receipts.

1lpn93p,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeuroMage/comments/1lpn93p/guide_to_chronomancy_mastering_time_perception/,Guide to Chronomancy (Mastering Time Perception),"Chronomancy, the discipline of consciously influencing your perception of time (chronoception), is one of the most subtle yet profoundly impactful areas within Neuromancy. It's about disengaging from the external ticking clock and recognizing the mind's intrinsic power to shape how you experience duration.

We walk through a world seemingly governed by the relentless tick-tock of external clocks. Yet, what if the very essence of time, as we experience it, resides not out there, but profoundly within? Chronomancy, within the broader journey of Neuromancy, is the discipline of consciously engaging with this profound truth,  mastering your perception of time itself.

This journey is not about manipulating the hands of a clock in the external world. We are not seeking to travel through dimensions or halt the movement of stars. Such notions keep our focus misplaced, searching outside for what already exists within. Instead, this path invites you to uncover the magnificent power of your awareness to shape how duration unfolds for you, to stretch a fleeting moment into an eternity, or to compress long periods into a mere breath. 

This is a gentle guide to achieving **beginner-level Chronomancy and a profound shift in your subjective experience of time.**



# The Foundations of Time's Mastery: Understanding Your ""I Am"" in the Now



To genuinely engage with Chronomancy, we must first deeply embrace foundational truths about our being and reality:

* **The ""I Am"" of Time:** Recall that the name of God is ""I Am."" This ""I Am"" is not ""he is"" or ""she is"" or ""they are"" - it's an awareness, an awareness of being. Your awareness, your pure ""I Am"" presence, is the ultimate point of creation. Time, as you perceive it, flows from this awareness. When you are truly present, you are in the eternal now, the source of all manifestation.
* **Presence as the Canvas:** The only moment of true power is the present. Our minds often drift, reviewing past guilt or anticipating future anxieties. This scattered awareness dilutes our capacity to experience the richness of ""now."" To reshape time, you must first fully inhabit it.
* **Repentance (Change of Mind) from Time's Tyranny:** ""Repentance isn't about remorse or guilt; it's about a radical change in attitude and mind."" For Chronomancy, this means changing your attitude towards external, linear time. Forgive yourself for being bound by it. Embrace the freedom that comes from knowing your internal clock is primary.
* **Internal Rhythms as the True Clock:** Look within. Your body possesses its own profound rhythms: your heartbeat, your breath, the subtle flows of energy within you. These are your most authentic temporal markers. By becoming intimately aware of them, you begin to perceive time not as an abstract external force, but as an intimate, living process within your own being.
* **Perception is All:** Remember, ""what truly counts is our internal state - that's what we carry with us everywhere."" Time is not an objective constant outside of your perception; it is a profound creation of your internal state. What you choose to be aware of, how deeply you engage, and the quality of your internal state fundamentally reshape your temporal experience.



# Important Reflections Before You Begin:



* **Internal Transformation, Not External Control:** This is not about magically altering the world's clocks. It is about altering your *relationship* with and *experience* of time. This is a profound inner work, leading to inner freedom.
* **Embrace Disorientation:** As you begin to detach from the familiar external clock, you might experience moments of disorientation. This is a natural part of the mind adjusting to a new way of perceiving. Simply return to your breath, to your ""I Am"" presence.
* **Patience and Self-Forgiveness:** Progress in Chronomancy can be incredibly subtle. There won't always be dramatic external confirmations. Learn to forgive yourself for perceived ""failures"" and continue with unwavering faith in your inner capacity.
* **Maintain Practical Awareness:** While cultivating internal time, it's vital to maintain a practical awareness of objective time for your daily responsibilities. This practice is about empowerment, not disengagement from the world.



# Tuning Your Internal Chronometer

This itinerary offers a structured path. Approach each phase with diligence, self-compassion, and the understanding that ""all change occurs within.""



**Phase 1: Deepening Presence & Internal Rhythm Awareness** 

* **Purpose:** To anchor your awareness deeply in the present and cultivate acute sensitivity to your body's innate rhythms, setting the foundation for time's malleability.
* **Daily Invitation:**
   * **Void Meditation / Stillness (2 hours):** Continue this profound practice. Seek not emptiness, but a state where the external world's timeline dissolves, allowing your ""I Am"" to simply be.
   * **Conscious Breath Awareness (15 minutes):** Throughout your day, pause and bring your entire focus to the sensation of your breath. Feel its rhythm, its gentle inhale and exhale. Let it ground you firmly in the present moment.
   * **Heartbeat Resonance (10 minutes):** Dedicate moments to sit in quietude, directing your awareness inward to perceive your own heartbeat without external validation. Feel its consistent, internal pulse.
   * **Sensory Immersion Practice (15-30 minutes):** Choose a simple, mundane object. Spend time truly *seeing* it, *feeling* its texture, *perceiving* every nuanced detail. Immerse your consciousness in that singular experience.
* **Benchmark (End of Phase 1):** You experience sustained periods of profound mental stillness. Your presence in the ""now"" feels more natural, and you have a clear, consistent internal awareness of your heartbeat and breath, independent of conscious effort.

**Phase 2: Micro-Manipulation of Short Durations** 

* **Purpose:** To consciously and deliberately begin to stretch or compress very brief, defined segments of time (e.g., 1 to 5 minutes).
* **Daily Invitation (in addition to Phase 1 foundations):**
   * **""Now"" Expansion/Compression (30-60 minutes, daily):** Select a repeatable, short task (e.g., brewing coffee, a quick chore, reading a short passage).
      * **To ""Stretch"" Time:** Before starting, gently set the intention for this task to *feel* longer than it is. As you engage, pour all your attention into every detail, every sensation. Notice colors, sounds, textures, the micro-movements of your body. Let your ""I Am"" expand into every fraction of a second.
      * **To ""Compress"" Time:** Set the intention for the task to *feel* shorter. Broaden your awareness, allow details to recede slightly, focusing on the overall flow. Feel your ""I Am"" swiftly move through the moments.
      * After the task, note your subjective experience. Did 2 minutes feel like 3? Did 5 minutes dissolve into 2? This internal feedback is your guide.
   * **Sensory Pacing Experiment (15 minutes):** Play a piece of music or listen to ambient sound. Practice deliberately accelerating or decelerating your *internal perception* of its pace, without altering the external sound itself.
* **Benchmark (End of Phase 2):** You consistently (20-30% of attempts or more) experience a noticeable subjective alteration of short durations. A minute task, for example, genuinely feels longer or shorter than 60 seconds to your internal clock.

**Phase 3: Extending Manipulation & Calibrating Subjective Flow** 

* **Purpose:** To increase the span over which you can influence time perception and refine the precision and consistency of your internal shifts.
* **Daily Invitation (in addition to Phase 1 foundations):**
   * **Longer Duration Engagement (60-90 minutes):** Extend your mindful experiments to tasks or periods lasting 10 to 30 minutes. Focus on maintaining your intended perception throughout.
   * **Internal Pacing Fine-Tuning:** Begin to develop an acute internal ""feel"" for the rate at which you are stretching or compressing time. Can you sense how much you are altering your internal ""clock's"" speed?
   * **Environmental Harmony:** Observe how external cues (e.g., shifting light, specific sounds, varying activity) influence your subjective time. Practice maintaining your chosen temporal experience despite these cues, or even consciously leveraging them.
   * **Nuance Journaling:** Beyond simply ""longer"" or ""shorter,"" record the *quality* of the experience: ""dreamlike slowness,"" ""fluid acceleration,"" ""sharp clarity of extended moments.""
* **Benchmark (End of Phase 3):** You reliably (40-60% of attempts) create subjective time shifts for tasks lasting up to 20-30 minutes, with a greater sense of control over the degree of lengthening or shortening. Your perception of time begins to feel like a truly malleable aspect of your consciousness.

**Phase 4: Advanced Application & Integration**

* **Purpose:** To seamlessly integrate Chronomancy into your daily life, using it for profound personal benefit and understanding.
* **Daily Invitation (in addition to Phase 1 foundations):**
   * **Everyday Chronomancy (Ongoing):** Consciously apply your skills to various daily situations:
      * When waiting: Stretch the moment to fully observe and appreciate your surroundings.
      * During tedious tasks: Compress the perception of time to move through them with less internal friction.
      * During moments of joy: Stretch these moments to savor every detail, deepening your experience.
   * **Distraction Resilience:** Practice maintaining your desired time perception even amidst significant external distractions, strengthening your mental fortitude.
   * **Emotional State Connection:** Explore the powerful interplay between specific emotional states (e.g., deep ""flow"" states, intense curiosity) and their natural impact on time perception. Learn to consciously invoke and leverage these states.
* **Benchmark (End of Phase 4):** You consistently and deliberately alter your subjective perception of time in diverse daily situations. You achieve a high degree of subjective success in making durations feel longer or shorter as desired. Your experience of time becomes a fluid aspect of your conscious being, no longer a rigid external constant.



# What You Will Achieve

Upon the completion of all the phases, you will have achieved **beginner-level Chronomancy.** This means you will likely be able to:

* **Reliably reshape your subjective experience of short to medium durations,** making minutes feel like more or less time at will.
* **Utilize a deeper level of presence and sensory awareness** to actively influence how you perceive temporal flow.
* **Understand, through direct experience, that time is not merely an external measurement, but a profound internal construct** highly susceptible to your ""I Am"" awareness.

This foundational ability bestows a profound freedom, the freedom to savor, to endure, to optimize your every moment. It allows you to truly ""make time"" for what matters most, aligning with the truth that all transformation begins within. Commit to the practice, live in the now, and witness the fluidity of your own reality.

when I was 6 or 7 I went to a yard sale with my dad and picked up a coffee table book. It had pictures of a lady with a bad haircut who looked honestly kind of ugly, but it said she was a princess and I loved any and all princesses at the time so I took it home, along with a tangled-up slinky and a passle of beanie babies that smelled of mildew.

after dinner I showed my mom the treasures I got. she took one look at the book cover with the sad-looking woman and vehemently spit out “Diana! God I hate Diana.” then, “I’m so glad she died.”

here is where the memory gets murky. I asked her why she hated Diana so much. My mom said something like Charles had a girlfriend—his true love—and Diana got in the way of their relationship.

at least I think that’s what she said. in all my life since then I have never heard anyone else describe Diana as the interloper, nor voice such contempt for the people’s princess. sometimes even I think my mom got the names mixed up (we are not british and she was never in tune with the pop culture at any time). 

anyways, then my dad started talking about how the car accident was no accident and the dinner conversation moved on. But I still remember the venom in my mother’s voice. And “I’m so glad she died.”

I was never able to untangle the slinky, and the beanie babies would forever smell of mildew no matter how many times we put it in the washing machine.

1lpn2gk,https://i.redd.it/sxddepvo4eaf1.png,Husband loves to play dead? I made it happen | I hung up and went back to my booth.,"**Offering a full overview, some honest thoughts, and a gentle pointer to where the story resides online**

Three months after my husband went missing in a skiing accident, I saw him at a bar.

He had his arm slung around ""sis-bro"" Jamie's shoulder, laughing like he was free from a life sentence. “Thanks to you, dude,” he was saying, ""I was starting to forget what real freedom felt like.""

His bros were buying him shots, one after another, asking when he was going to surface.

He thought for a second, ""I'll give it another week, maybe. Let her sweat it out a bit, you know, drive her crazy before I show my face again.""

I was standing in the shadows, watching him bask in his 'freedom', and dialed my friend at the county records office.

1.

“I’m going to have Mark Harrison declared legally deceased,” I said, my voice tight.

“You're not going to keep looking?” my friend asked, hesitating.

I looked up at Mark, who was now whispering something to Jamie, and my eyes stung. “There’s no point.”

You can’t find someone who doesn’t want to be found.

I hung up and went back to my booth.

My bestie, Sarah, saw my face and shoved a drink into my hand. “Look, honey, Mark’s been gone for three months. The odds of him being alive are basically zero. You need to let go, move on.”

I stared at the colorful drink in my glass and downed it in one go.

The burn of the liquor made my eyes water, and I blinked back the tears, asking, “Do you think anyone would fake their own death to get away from their wife?”

She looked at me like I’d sprouted a second head. ""What kind of crazy talk is that? Only a real dirtbag would pull a stunt like that. He’d be better off actually dead!”

I wiped away the tears and grabbed my purse.

“You’re right, I need to let him go.”

I left and went home.

The house was silent. It’d been this way for three months. I hated the silence. I’d started leaving all the lights on, brewing a cup of his favorite tea and putting it on the coffee table, pretending he was still there.

I just didn't understand. If he didn't want to be married to me anymore, he could have just filed for divorce. Why fake a skiing accident and disappear?

I sat on the couch and picked up the two cartoonish figurines of us he'd given me.

“When I’m not here,"" he’d said, grinning, ""these little guys can keep you company.""

His words clashed with the annoyed tone I’d heard at the bar.

“Chloe was sweet and chill before we got married, but now she’s way too clingy. This fake-out will teach her a lesson and she’ll lay off.”

Jamie had poured him another shot. “Well, at least I never cling to you! We've been buds for years.”

“You’re the best, man,” he'd replied.

They called themselves “bros” but their legs were intertwined.

The thought made my stomach churn.

I chucked the figurines in the trash and grabbed my phone, sending a mass text:

Mark Harrison passed away in an accident three months ago. Memorial service next week.

Mark’s buddies started hammering me with texts, full of outrage.

“How can you have a funeral if you haven’t found his body?”

“Chloe, have you lost it? Mark's not dead!”

“If Mark comes back and sees his own memorial service he’s gonna lose it! Chloe, think this through, do you want to make Mark angry?”

I didn't reply to the first texts, only to the last:

“He’s dead. He’s beyond being angry now.”

I tossed my phone aside and started packing up Mark’s stuff.

For the past three months, I had been searching for him in the mountain town where he was “skiing,” and barely been home.

The bedroom was mostly as we'd left it.

I opened his closet and froze.

His clothes were gone, like half of them, and all that was left were the items he’d never wear at this time of year.

Tears started to fall.

I had spent three months looking for him, and he’d been sneaking back here to grab his crap whenever I wasn't around.

2.

I pulled up the security footage and fast-forwarded through the last month.

At the start of the month, Mark had walked in with his arm around Jamie, leaving two hours later with a ton of clothes.

Mid-month, he’d carried Jamie into the house, and Jamie hadn't left till the morning.

A couple of nights ago, they'd come home under the cover of darkness, leaving early yesterday morning.

I had been looking for him in the next state over when these things had happened.

I watched the screen as tears streamed down my face, not for Mark, but for myself.

How had I fallen for such a scum bag?

I had been losing sleep, worrying about him, while he and his ""bro"" were sleeping in my house, maybe even my bed.

I clenched my fist and willed myself not to start hyperventilating.

The phone rang.

I didn’t want to answer but it kept ringing.

I took a deep breath, got up and looked at the caller ID.

It was Mark's uncle, Ben Harrison. I quickly answered. “Uncle Ben, is everything okay?”

“Mark’s not dead.”

He sent a video.

It was Mark and Jamie doing a sake bomb, their eyes glued to one another.

My breath hitched, and my fingers trembled as I spoke. “I know he’s not dead.”

The man sounded surprised, but then laughed. “Then why are you planning a funeral?”

“Everyone kept saying he was dead. I wanted to believe it. So, he gets a funeral.”

Ben was silent for a second. “So you’re saying you’re widowed?”

“Yeah,” I replied.

Ben Harrison was Mark's uncle by adoption, and I barely knew him.

He was the first person to tell me straight up that Mark was alive. I felt like I owed him something for that.

“If you’re free next week, you can come to the service.”

“I will.”

Then another video came through.

Mark’s friends are showing him something on their phone and he throws his drink. Jamie puts her hand on his chest like she’s trying to calm him down.

The bar was too loud for me to hear, but I could see Mark's face soften. He even buried his face in Jamie’s shoulder.

He must have seen my mass text, and he got pissed. And, somehow, just a few words from Jamie had soothed him.

Whenever he got mad at me, he’d make me spend the night thinking about what I did wrong. Only then he would forgive me.

I closed my eyes, saved the videos, and set the phone down.

Right then, Jamie called.

I answered, and the loud music in the background nearly deafened me.

Jamie was shouting. “Chloe! Are you planning a memorial service for Mark? Are you crazy? Cancel that thing now! If he ever sees it when he comes back, you’ll be sorry!”

Before she finished, I hung up, grabbed a blanket, and crashed on the couch.

It was the first good sleep I’d had in three months.

The next morning, I went down to the courthouse to get Mark declared officially deceased.

Once I got the paperwork, I went to Jamie’s place.

Her front door was closed, and it took me several tries on the doorbell before I heard footsteps.

She was wearing a silk robe, leaning against the doorframe, and there was evidence of a good time all over her neck and collarbone.",5,1751431629.0,romancenovels,2,0.86,False

Been freelancing for a while now — editing, designing, and working on GTM strategies. Earlier this year, I moved from Mumbai to Bhopal. No particular reason, just wanted to challenge myself.

You can check out some of my work here:  
📌 [whynotdeepak.site](http://whynotdeepak.site/)  
📌 [Project: rebluesmedia.in](http://rebluesmedia.in/)

I’ve been handling everything solo — from content to strategy — and I love creating. Like really *creating*. I want to build something inevitable, but lately, I’ve been so tied up with client work (mostly from the US and India — IG management, edits, etc.) that I haven’t been able to focus much on strategy.

So here’s the deal:

If you’re as crazy as I am — someone who’s more obsessed with *creating* than just chasing money — let’s work together. I’ll *literally* pay you 2x what you’re earning right now if you’re good. I just need someone to help take the load off, and in return, I’ll teach you everything you see trending on reels and more.

# Looking for:

* **Video Editors**
* **Social Media Managers**
* **Graphic Designers**

# Requirements:

* A good PC/laptop ( mac or any rtx graphics based device with least 16gb ram)
* Availability to deliver in EST time zone (IST 5:00 PM – 4:00 AM) – not mandatory if you’re fast with deadlines
* **On-site in Bawadiya Kalan (Bhopal)** – I’ve got a cafe setup here. Coffee & snacks are on the house 😉

# Bonus:

Open to collaborations with agencies too — just share your proof of work.

Kitchen is basically in a straight line on the back wall and we plan to add an island

Current thoughts:

* Flooring: We're thinking wide-plank oak
* Walls: Benjamin Moore ""Swiss Coffee"" ?
* Cabinets: Maybe off white? Benjamin Moore Natural Cream?
* Backsplash: Soft gray-beige so everything isn't super white?
* Island: bottom maybe a wood, but don't want it to look like the floors
* Countertops: Materials needs to be kid and spill friendly; dont want it to look all-white with the cabinets
   * Maybe Rococo Viatera Quartz, Viatera Aura, or MSI Calacatta Valentin?

Our kitchen isn't this big, but maybe something like this?

Basically the title of the post is what’s going on and I’m(f22) fed up with the issues he has caused and is causing. My brother (18) has stolen liquor from our step dad three times now. Its not like he’s stealing Jack or Hennessy or regular every day booze. He’s stealing $300-$800 bottles of alcohol. Gifts from friends or family. Alcohol that he cannot replace because the person either passed, they don’t make that liquor anymore or it’s insanely expensive. No body drinks in my house besides me. My stepdad only drinks on extreme occasions. My mother? Never. My brother has drank more than $3k worth of alcohol. Even a bottle that my step dad’s deceased father gave him. We have done it all to help him. He doesn’t work, he dropped out of school, all he does is sit on his computer. He’s been like this since middle school and we have exhausted every possible option. He’s 6’6 and 300lbs. We’re all significantly smaller than him so physically taking him out the house and taking him to therapy, the doctors, school ANYTHING is impossible because he’s not scared to become physical. The last time I tried talking to him about what was going on he became angry and threw me across the room. I’m 5’4 120lbs. I don’t need to be man handled by him and get hurt and neither does anybody else. He had come to me last night for the first time to talk to me and open up about everything and I really thought that he was going to make a change and saw him and his struggles. I told him we all want what’s best for him and that our mom doesn’t care if he drinks or smokes he doesn’t need to hide it or steal all he has to do it JUST ASK. He’s previously stolen alcohol from me several times. “Don’t buy alcohol. Lock it up. Hide it” we have and did. My mom even put all of it in a duffle bag in her car. All but 3 bottles. I come home from work to her sitting on the floor of her room, sobbing her eyes out with the water filled bottle. Mind you like I said before HE CAME TO ME THE NIGHT BEFORE. I’m livid I’m fuming. My mom is scared her marriage will fall apart (step dad travels for work so he’s not home rn) he also tries to be slick about it. He put coffee, apple juice, grape juice, water in all the bottles he drank so we wouldn’t noticed. we give my brother the support he needs and always have. We give him, options, resources we don’t expect anything out of him besides him being happy. The only time he breaks down about how depressed he is when he catch him stealing alcohol. He says he’s depressed because no one’s home and wants my mom to quit her job. Because our dad doesn’t see him as often as he should. Because his friends have their own lives going and are becoming proper adults. Because this or that happened or because he was the youngest out of 5 yadda yadda. I’m not diminishing or invalidating his struggles when I say this, but…his excuses are horseshit. He has options, resources EVERY THING THAT COULD HELP HIM RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS FACE. Even offering to buy the booze for him so he doesn’t have to steal. Hes 18. Yes things weren’t always good growing up, but who’s life is perfect and happy 24/7? He wasn’t abused or neglected. He was the favorite kid out of 5. I’m not going to lie I am a functioning alcoholic. (Job related) No body in my home knows that about me because I keep my shit in line, I go to work run a store deal with bullshit and I go home or go to the bar and drink 5 days out of the week. Yet you don’t see me stealing ANYTHING from ANYBODY. It’s frustrating and I’m sick of it. I’m sick of my mom worrying about her marriage. My parents don’t deserve this and my mom feels as tho as she is a failure. Getting my father to help is impossible “whatever happens at your house happens” mindset and he’ll just blame my mom as if his absence didn’t effect my brother when he was growing up. Yeah I know he’s only 18, but this is an on going issue. He simply doesn’t give a shit and is ungrateful. My step dad could’ve called the police and gotten him out of there and I’m at that point right now. I don’t know what to do anymore and neither does my mom and we’re both sick to our stomach’s thinking about what will happen when my step dad comes home on Thursday. Sorry sorry I know it was a lot but I just needed to get it out there because I’m truly stunned. He has men figures around. We live in a beautiful home and a good life thanks to my step dad. I don’t want my mom to be so sad because my brother anymore. I’m scared she will really quit her career just so my brother can be doing the same shit just with her unemployed. It’s only been 3 times where he’s stolen from my step dad, but one time is enough and it’s HOW and WHAT he did. He comes home drunk every night even falling against the wall and put a huge hole in which my mom said she fell and tripped to cover his ass. Alcohol is meant to be appreciated and on a special occasion. It’s extremely frustrating and I hate seeing my mom like this and I truly have no sympathy or empathy for the kid anymore.

Then one day we log in and boom. There’s Jake. Shirtless. In a steaming hot tub. Sipping coffee. Like it’s totally normal.

We all assumed it was a one-off thing. Nope. It’s now his thing. Rain or shine, Monday to Friday, 9am, Jake is in his hot tub. Sometimes he even wears sunglasses like he’s in Miami Vice. Once he had a floating tray with a muffin on it.

Management? Silent. HR? MIA. We’re all just pretending this is normal now. Meanwhile I’m here in a hoodie freezing in my apartment like a peasant.

1lpmtcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianMasculinity/comments/1lpmtcm/weekly_post_8_the_cultural_impact_of_squid_game/,WEEKLY POST 8: The Cultural Impact of Squid Game on Asian Male Representation (Spoiler alert***),"Squid Game marked a beacon moment for the representation of Asian men in global media. Now that the series has wrapped, it’s worth reflecting on the lasting impact it’s had. For the first time on such a massive international stage, Asian men were shown as multifaceted- complex, masculine, and charismatic not sidelined, but as the heart of the story.

Positive representation can shape how entire groups are viewed. With an all-Asian cast, Squid game shift how entire groups are perceived. Despite  the cringeworthy VIP characters, the majority of the screen time went to fully developed Asian characters. Many of the lead actors were not only talented and compelling, but also conventionally attractive, they challenge western media narratives that have long marginalized Asian men.

What made *Squid Game* so powerful was the diversity of its character portrayals. Because the entire cast was Asian, the characters weren’t defined by race. They were allowed to simply be human. You had Min-Su, vulnerable and bullied; Hwang Jun-ho, the determined and competent detective; and Seong Gi-hun, a flawed but ultimately good natured man torn between desperation and responsibility. There were heroes and villains, selfless figures and morally ambiguous ones all played by Asian men. This kind of nuance is rare in global media because normally they are typed cast as one.

Seeing that this was written and produced in Korea and that it resonated around the world speaks volumes about its significances . It's similar to the global impact of *Slumdog Millionaire* for Indian representation or Priyanka Chopra’s crossover success in Hollywood and her high-profile relationship, both of which helped elevate Indian visibility in Western culture. These breakthroughs matters because they help shift cultural perceptions and expand what's possible.

Breaking into Hollywood isn’t easy for foreign films, especially when they push back against the usual narrative. But that’s where the money and attention are- and it takes a special kind of director to pull off what *Squid Game* managed to do

*Squid Game* wasn’t just a hit series,  it was a cultural turning point. It challenged outdated stereotypes, opened new doors, and moved the needle forward for how Asian men are seen, both on screen and in the broader cultural imagination.

Now if you are interested in just the short version of my essay on Shego then i would say she should have 35% chance of receiving a bad ending and 65% chance of getting a good ending. But if you are willing to read a long essay then you should know that my essay on Shego contains 4 main parts. The first part about her redeeming qualities. The second part is a list of all her major flaws. The third part is to present to you the multiple reasons for why she would be able to fix all of them. And the last part is where i will lay out external challenges, dark temptations & negative feelings that Shego has to overcome. So let's begin

1/ Having **The Showmanship Of An Acrobat** That Makes Her Do A Flashy Entry, **The Sportmanship Of A Martial Artist** That Makes Her Give Her Foe A Moment To Get Ready Before Shego Starts The Fight and Neither Sneeze At Her Foe Nor Pull Their Hair During A Fight  **& The Adrenaline Junkie's Enjoyment in Hand-to-Hand Fighting** That Makes Her Treat A Fight As A Game and Prolong A Thrilling Fight

(saying that she was gonna whip Kim in technical merit and artistic impression, doing a flashy entry by leaping high over her opponent's head and performing multiple flips during the leap or by jumping down from a tall platform and performing multiple flips during the descent,

https://i.redd.it/2m5c6vrgmwie1.gif

asking Kim to not get distracted and fully concentrate on fighting Shego, regarding sneezing in someone's face as a low blow due to the unhygienic nature of sneeze droplets, asking Kim to give Shego a time-out so that Shego can sneeze into her hands instead of at Kim, never pulling Kim's hair during a fight due to Shego having long hair herself and not wanting her hair to get pulled by her foe during a fight, calling Kim ""sister"" in Bad Boy as an acknowledgement of Kim as Shego's peer in terms of combat skills and in the ability to come up with a witty banter,

https://reddit.com/link/1lpmo7j/video/cqthlrh7tdaf1/player

saying 'Alright, I’m game, lets play' before projecting her glow at Warmonga, saying 'Oh look, Kimmie came out to play' seconds before starting her fight vs Kim, saying to Kim 'Sorry, no prize for second place' , her kick having created cracks on a wall and broken a table but never caused a bone fracture in Kim's body, choosing to fight Kim without using Shego's glow powers on a handful of occassions (the beginning of Oct 31st, of Bad Boy, of Rappin' Drakken, the end of Bad Boy, of Clothes Minded, etc...), having had 18 fights where Shego's hand or projected glow makes contact with Kim's body part but does not burn it due to Shego preferring a prolonged thrilling hand to hand fight against Kim over a quick boring win versus Kim by utilizing Shego's glow at its most destructive potential. To phrase it another way, Shego treats her fight with Kim like a game and wants to defeat Kim in not a short but a long game)

2) Having **Clear Lines To Her Villainy**

(being willing to buy cheap newspapers at a supermarket and thus not being a petty thief who steals whatever she can steal,

never having committed arson likely due to this criminal act being too unchallenging for her and thus not exciting enough for her to commit, not finding enjoyment in stealing from people who have zero capacity to fight back & thus provide zero challenge (an invalid, a baby),

having knocked out DNAmy, security guards, Dementor's henchmen, a flirty man & a doctor in Dimension Twist, and Kim's twin brothers, without causing any of them to have a fractured bone in their body or a burn on their skin and therefore not being a bloodthirsty killer that shows zero mercy toward common folks that stand in her way,

All of point 2 = 10% chance of success

3) **Loved Ones & Longstanding Partner Matter To Her** \+ No Longer Treating Kim & Ron As Foes But As Close Acquaintances

(Emotion Sickness episode revealing that Shego can love others, having been the glue that held her four brothers together, still caring about her brothers in some manner and did not get mad at herself or Drakken after having lost the power staff that held Team Go powers but was okay with her brothers getting their powers back, allowing Ron to be in the spaceship with her & telling Ron to hang on when she was going to maneuver the spaceship past large obstacles, finally caring about Drakken enough to want to rescue him from being imprisoned in an alien spaceship, genuinely wanting to assist him in his plan to stop an alien conquest, saving him from being stomped on by a giant alien robot, feeling proud & happy for him for getting the respect he yearns for, not pushing Drakken to get back to conquering the world with his plant powers after the world having been devastated by an alien invasion but choosing to be on the same stage with him where he receives applause from everyone for saving the world from an alien conquest, Kim admitting that she has alot in common with Shego and feeling that there is a sisterhood between her and the Shego that possesses no evil thoughts, Shego giving Kim a compliment about her new mission outfit, respecting Kim's choice of having Josh as her date, agreeing with Kim in their small talks that both Kim & her have a male partner that makes them mad in Emotion Sickness, that both of them struggle to find a parking space for their car in The Big Job, both like having their eyebrows waxed, both enjoy watching the movie Memopad, enjoy visiting the same art museum and roller skating,

https://reddit.com/link/1lpmo7j/video/tw7zcpjiudaf1/player

both knowing about each other's family, both having annoying brothers, both having a mistake prone male partner, both watching American Starmaker, both using a compact mirror to check their make-up, both painting their nails in their favorite colors, both having the same reaction when both hear the news of Team Go breaking bad or witness a Drakken's screw up or face the same kind of danger or fail at their respective objectives or talk about Ron losing his pant or get to see how many expensive stuffs Junior has at his disposal or see Drakken yell at Ron or see Ron unleash his telekinetic powers against Warhok or witness evil Ron reveal his latest invention, both sneezing at the same time, both suffering wild mood swings in Emotion Sickness, both do the same hand gestures, both use the same gears but in different colors, Kim holding Shego's shoulders down the same way Shego had held Kim's shoulders down, Shego adopting Kim's fighting stance and using Kim's steam burst trick against her, Shego using Kim's winner phrase ""Jinx, you owe a soda"" and Kim's guilt tripping puppy eye pout against her, Shego knowing about Wade, a few functions of the Kimmunicator, Kimmobile Interior, Kim's high school, class, classmates & teacher (Mister Barkin), Kim's favorite locations (coffee shop, clothing store - Club Banana, beauty salon, cinema, restaurant - Bueno Nacho, art museum, park), favorite dishes (Taco) and favorite shows (Pals), Kim's repayment of favour (electrocution for electrocution, fall from great height for fall from great height) and Kim's ideal type of boyfriend, Shego having left a bunch of her outfits & accessories at Kim's home (dating dress, teacher outfit, hairband, earrings, necklace, bracelet, waist belt, high-heels and possibly even underwear), Shego looking worried when a possessed Drakken points a sword at Kim, not able to resist Kim's guilt tripping puppy eye pout & agreeing to do Kim's clean-up duty so that Kim can celebrate her graduation with her friends & family, saying ""You had to be here"" to Drakken as a way of telling him to stay quiet and let the romantic moment of Kim and Ron hugging each other occur peacefully without the couple being disturbed by Drakken's loud voice)

[Even though Shego does not feel guilt for hurting a person's bodypart or self-esteem, she can still be made to feel guilt](https://preview.redd.it/n7vcivmht95f1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=209487cb236755660df003b2b43a11a276bafc31)

All of point 3 = 10% chance of success

4) The Realization Of **Herself Being In Need Of A Partner** and **Her Genuinely Wanting To Help Her Partner**

(Shego in Graduation was basically Kim in A Sitch In Time. Both girls came to realize that they need to have their partner. Without Ron, Kim would not succeed in her job of saving the world, and without Drakken, Shego would feel lonely and have much less fun in her life. And as much as Kim loves Ron for who he is, Shego accepts Drakken for who he is and eventually arrives at a point where she wants to help him out of her genuine care for his well-being — not out of her own selfish interests or out of her own contractual obligations to him)

5) Having Had **Happy Experience When She Was Turned Into A Good Version Of Herself** That Possesses None Of Her Personality Flaws

(In STG, Shego found out that without her flaws & criminal way, she could have a good social life)

All of point 5 = 10% chance of success

6) **Shego's Major Flaws**

\+ 20% **Mental Laziness** & Thus **Lacking An Ambitious Mentally Challenging Goal** and **Having Little to Zero Creativity**

(Not having an ambitious, mentally challenging goal and being satisfied with just being a mercenary who follows another person's orders are not bad things. However not having an ambitious, mentally challenging goal largely due to one's own mental laziness is a bad thing. Laziness is the second worst kind of flaw that a character can have. It's not as bad as the character having a huge ego that makes them unable to acknowledge their flaws but it still means that the character has never put in the efforts to address their flaws. They'd rather spend alot of their time doing recreational activities / exciting actions than concentrating on the funless, unenjoyable work of fixing their flaws or completing a task that requires a lot of mental effort & creativity, such as planning, or a great deal of attention to detail, such as conducting a thorough full body inspection on someone.

Another bad thing about mental laziness is that it makes the character mindlessly follow another person's irrational orders to the point of leaving incapacitated foes behind / tying them up / putting them in an elaborated death trap instead of forming her own independent rational thought about using her own glow powers to finish off the incapacitated foes right there and then. There have been at least 15 occasions when Shego could've shot her destructive glow against a Kim who was physically restrained / physically incapacitated / unconcious but Shego never did. Then there was an occasion when Shego did shoot her glow at a physically incapacitated Kim, but only to deflate her astronaut suit and prevent her from chasing after Shego, not to finish Kim off or even maim her. And this is not even metioning the one occassion when Shego could have poisoned Kim's drink but chose to only switch Kim's drinking cup with another drinking cup of different shape.(In STG, Shego found out that without her flaws & criminal way, she could have a good social life)All of point 5 = 10% chance of success6) Shego's Major Flaws+ 20% Mental Laziness & Thus Lacking An Ambitious Mentally Challenging Goal and Having Little to Zero Creativity(Not having an ambitious, mentally challenging goal and being satisfied with just being a mercenary who follows another person's orders are not bad things.

Also last but not least, Shego's mental laziness is what prevents her from doing something new and unpredictable in her fights against Kim (such as using a new weapon or a new gadget) and makes her stick to her old and predictable way of fighting her foes where she relies only on her glow powers and martial art skills and never has anything else to surprise her foe).Also last but not least, Shego's mental laziness is what prevents her from doing something new and unpredictable in her fights against Kim (such as using a new weapon or a new gadget) and makes her stick to her old and predictable way of fighting her foes where she relies only on her glow powers and martial art skills and never has anything else to surprise her foe)

\+ 20% **Bad Temper** & Thus **Lack of Self-Control** and **Proneness to Mental and Emotional Exhaustion**

(a 17 minutes long vid to show Shego's temper issue: [https://youtu.be/YnGy183pHJo](https://youtu.be/YnGy183pHJo) )

(This is a bad flaw for a lazy character to have. Once the lazy character decides that they will concentrate on doing something that is boring or hard for them, that would cost alot of their time & efforts, that would require alot of patience from them and then the character encounters difficulties, they would simply lose their cool, get impatient, start to make mistakes and then just simply quit to do a recreational activity that would help them cool off. Moreover, bad temper makes the character act on angry impulses without thinking ahead about the consequences of their violent actions or disrespectful words. However, the most severe consequence of the character's bad temper is how it sometimes causes the individual to stay angry and frustrated for too long, leading to their own mental and emotional exhaustion later on)

\+ 20% **Mocking Habit** Due To Taking Selfish Pleasure In Mocking Others & Having Zero Regard For Others' Ego and Feelings And Thus **Struggling To Have A Long Term Relationship**

(This flaw makes the character never pass up an opportunity to mock people. An obvious example of this is the nicknames that Shego used to call Kim such as Kimmie (meaning little kid), princess (meaning daddy girl), pumpkin (meaning pumpkin hairstyle). Another example of Shego not willing to let an opportunity to mock people slip by is the scene in The Mind Games episode where Shego laughs at Kim for being in Ron's body and then asks Ron in Kim's body to say something so that she could have a laugh at him. Then another example of Shego not willing to miss out on an opportunity to mock people is her having banter with Kim before and during their fights, which, in combination with Shego's enjoyment in hand-to-hand fighting, made their fights last longer than they should. Nevertheless, the most negative consequence of Shego's habitual mocking of others that it prevents her from having a fulfilling long-term relationship with another individual since the mocking habit reveals herself to be a selfish, unthoughtful individual who does what is fun for her and never thinks ahead about the consequences of her words & actions. But its ironic that when people mock her back or call her names, she would lose her cool)

If a normal character has all of Shego's flaws, they would suffer a 60% chance of failure. However since this is Shego who we are talking about, it's not impossible for her to fix all of her flaws and thus turn this 60% chance of failure into a 60% chance of success. In fact, it is established in the show that if Shego wholeheartedly put her mind to something, she can succeed at it (tyrant in ASIT, teacher in STG). Therefore, if Shego really put her mind to fixing all her major flaws then she can do it. And eventually, you would witness major changes within Shego as a character

(from having bad temper to keeping composure, from mocking others for one's own fun to being thoughtful of one's words, from following the plan of others to using her own creativity to think up a good plan, from working as another man's sidekick to wanting a suitable life partner to settle down with).

All of point 6 = 60% chance of success

7) **Kim** Doing Girly Stuffs With Shego And Acting As A Supportive Sister Figure To Shego

Kim shares interests in girly stuff with Shego, has an extensive knowledge on her and therefore a good understanding of her flaws. In addition to that, Kim also possesses a huge amount of experience in solving all kinds of problems, a vast array of skills (including social skills) & many good attributes (maturity, leadership, empathy, patience, humility, resourcefulness, etc...) that make her good at helping others. Therefore it makes sense that that KP would be the one to hang out with Shego on a regular basis, help her fit into society and eventually improve as a person.

All of point 7 = 20% chance of success

8) **Light-Hearted Nature Of KP** Universe

(Shego could have had the STD ending where she went to prison but after the show had been renewed for season 4, the writers decided to not give Shego such bad ending)

All of point 8 = 10% chance of success

9) **Go City** Being The Place That Shego Would Return To At Some Point

Its the only place where the inhabitants do not judge her by just her past crimes and would welcome her back as their protector due to them remembering the good things Shego had done in Go City (having made Go City a safer place for its inhabitants by putting Electronique, Aviarius and other villains in prison). Even the name Shego itself means the female member of Team Go. And the everyday outfit that Shego wears is a Team Go uniform but in the green color of her powers. And last but not least, the green color of Shego's powers is just one of the rainbow-colored comet's seven colors.

10) A Part Of Shego Is Still **A Teacher Of Minors**

(her having used words like ""lesson time"", ""field trip"", mentoring SSJ to become a better villain, being a grammar nazi that corrects SSJ's pronunciation mistake of saying ""porpoise"" instead of ""tortoise"", that corrects Drakken's grammartical mistakes during his gloating (fish or fishes, brillianter, englist) and being disapointed when he used the words ""so mind-bogglingly wowful"" instead of ""so mind-boggling and so wowful"", knowing about the geography & climate of Greenland and Iceland and thus not getting deceived by their names, telling Ron to follow the school bus rule of not talking to the driver when she is piloting a spaceship with him seated next to her, having a teaching degree to fall back on unlike Drakken who has no degree)

11) Becoming More Humble & Creative Due To The **Realization Of The Decreased Effectiveness Of Her Glow Powers**

It is inevitable that more and more people will have the equipments to deflect Shego's glow right back at her, just as Team Possible & Warmonga did. And this would force Shego to become more humble and more creative when she engages in combat against her foes, such as employing a variety of weapons and gadgets, as well as utilizing elements in her surroundings, rather than relying solely on her glow powers.

All of point 11 = 10% chance of success

12) Having A Goal Of **Helping Humanity Prepare Against A Potential Invasion By A Warlordian Army** Or Race

Shego sees no good point in eliminating the heroes who are part of the human race but would rather cooperate with them to face against a greater threat in the future. Furthermore, she is one of the few people whose powers can actually damage Warlodian technology so the heroes would not just let her sit out and do nothing for the entirety of their defensive war against the Warlodian invasion army but allow her to join their ranks to fight against the Warlodian conquest of earth.

All of point 12 = 10% chance of success

In conclusion, the total sum of Shego's success percentages is (10% + 10% + 10% + 20% + 10% + 60% + 20% + 10% + 10% + 10% + 10%) = 190%

**But what are the things that would hold her back from improving herself as a person?**

13) **Not Being Able To Deal With The Consequences/Repercussions Of Her Past Crimes**

Not pacifying her past victims who hold grudges against her and want to get back at her (for example Mr Barkin, rich folks whose valuable possessions got stolen by her, the people who got beat up by her)

Not pacifying Drakken's former henchmen who had received prison sentences for having worked with her and Drakken in the past but had not received a pardon like her and Drakken and had been left to rot in jail by her and Drakken until the former henchmen themselves broke out of jail or got released from it

Not returning the stolen wealth that is covering her luxurious lifestyle to the rightful owners of those wealth OR returning all the stolen wealth but not giving up on her luxurious lifestyle that can not be covered into the future by just her legit income

However this part does not take into account the possibility of her becoming wealthy in a legit way (earning a high income that can afford her a luxurious lifestyle) or her changing her lifestyle (no luxurious lifestyle)

All of point 13 = 10% chance of failure

14) Having Had **Bad Past Experiences In Being An Altruistic Person** & Having Found **Satisfaction In Being A Mercenary**

Shego shares alot of similarities with Kim (especially in being a brave & multi-talented individual) but lacks a cool temperament and did not have a good support network to keep her grounded and help her balance work & leisure. Instead, she had to comply with the strict rules set by an overbearing Hego, follow his lead and let him take all the credits for her work. And as a Team Go member, she was being too altruistic and ended up taking on too many responsibilities (Shego having been a hero protecting a city, a teacher dealing with a class of mischievious kids & a sister holding the unity in a parentless family of 5 vs KP being a hero saving the world, a cheerleader dealing with Bonnie & a sister in a family of 5 including parents). All these responsibilities were too much for Shego to handle, leading her to frequent frustration and anger, and leaving her without any free time for leisure and relationships, while she received no appreciation for her work from her brothers. And eventually all this led to Shego becoming mentally & emotionally drained, devoid of any motivation to be altruistic (or even despising altruism altogether for causing her to become mentally & emotionally depleted while receiving nothing good in return from her brothers) and thus wanting more freetime for recreational activities, for her job to be about doing exciting physical actions without much brainstorming, and, last but not least, good financial compensation for her work.

So later on, she became fascinated with mercenary work and found more enjoyment in mercenary work than in heroism and eventually chose to work for Drakken who gives her what she wants. And as a henchwoman, she was contractually obliged to only fix the mess that her employer makes but did not have to be a helpful friend that would spend alot of her time and efforts to help her employer overcome his flaws. Even Shego herself did not do anything to fix her own flaws. Ultimately, Shego was defined by her own flaws as much as Drakken is defined by his. ""Some people never really change"" - KP

All of point 14 = 20% chance of failure

15) Having Had **The Willingness To Commit Crimes That Pose Actual Physical Skill Challenges To Her And Thus Provide Her Excitement**

(doing crimes that look challenging and exciting, such as stealing heavily guarded valuable stuffs, kidnapping VIP, testing superweapons against KP & co, blowing up large things, etc... wanting people to know the crimes she has managed to pull off by allowing a camera capture her face in Tick-tick-tick, wanting her reputation as a criminal to reach an international level thus committing crimes in 11 countries and then having her face plastered on the wanted posters in those 11 countries, having taken pride in being evil and not wanted people to see her as a softie and thus getting mad at Drakken for saying that she was soft and calling Kim 'cupcake', which was Shego's way of saying to Kim that ""You are a softie. You get too emotional about my latest action of saving you without remembering who i am & all the previous things i have done to you"")

All of point 15 = 20% chance of failure

16) Being **The Perfect Antagonist For Kim**

Shego's backstory is a parallel to Kim's story throughout 4 seasons. Her backstory shows how she had been less fortunate & more flawed than Kim and is a partial explaination for why Shego became a more selfish & darker version of Kim. And being the more selfish & darker version of Kim makes Shego the perfect antagonist for Kim.

All of point 16 = 20% chance of failure

17) Unavoidable Feeling of **Envy Towards Kim**

Since Shego is the less fortunate, more flawed version of Kim (similar to how Drakken being a less fortunate, more flawed version of Ron), Shego is bound to be envious of Kim for her success in life (especially for her popularity & amazing support network). In contrast, Shego was never truly appreciated by her brothers when she was the most mentally hardworking member of Team Go and as a henchwoman, she could not succeed in helping Drakken overcome his flaws & take over the world. In the end, Shego's failures in her sidekick role & multiple responsibilities in her pre-sidekick life are a stark contrast to Kim's successes in her multiple responsibilities.

All of point 17 = 20% chance of failure

18) **Drakken's Downfall Would Lead To Shego's Downfall**

In a likely scenario where Drakken can not fit into society (55% chance) and suffers a bad ending where his reputation is damaged beyond repair, he would drag Shego down with him by revealing damaging infos about her to the authority and to her enemies (details about her past crimes, her personality flaw & other weaknesses, counter-measures against her glow, her still somewhat caring about her bros, her fear of electrocution, etc...)

All of point 18 = 10% chance of failure

In conclusion, the total sum of Shego's failure percentages (10% + 20% + 20% + 20% + 20% + 10%) = 100%

Calculation for Shego's ultimate fate:  
( 100% / (190% + 100%) ) = 35% unhappy | ( 190% / (190% + 100%) ) = 65% happy

**The writings for Shego's Post Graduation character growth story:**

From being a character with bad temper, mental laziness & mocking habit to being a character of composure, creativity & thoughtfulness in her words, Shego becoming the almost opposite of her would be unconceivable to us but it actually makes sense. The ability to control her temper, to think up a good plan on her own, to think about the impact/consequences of her words & actions before she says or acts are the things Shego has to learn at some point.

However this path of character growth isnt gonna be easy for Shego. She is not a quick learner that can fix all of her flaws in an instant and would likely suffer some consequences for not fully concentrating on fixing her flaws at the beginning. But eventually she would learn to keep her cool by devoting her free time to meditation instead of her usual recreational activities (reading magazine, filing her nail, indoor & outdoor tanning, etc...), learn to use her creativity in planning, cooking, and many other activities, learn to think before she says or acts and last but not least, seek a suitable life partner to settle down with instead of staying as a sidekick to another person.

However there are big questions about the kind of lifestyle Shego would choose to lead—whether it would be a luxurious lifestyle or a modest one, how Shego would fund that lifestyle, and whether Shego's envy toward Kim would lead her to want to ruin Kim's social life and reputation or to seek to improve her own.

**The writings for Shego's bad ending:**

**Bad Ending 1**

Losing Her Fighting Ability Due To Permanent Physical Injuries & Psychological Trauma

(Being a mercenary is a high risk high rewards job. But at some point, the risk will outweight the reward. And the risk Shego has to face is the Kim Possible who already demonstrated her ability to inflict an enormous amount of pain & minor injury onto Shego. So if Shego retains her flaws and continues on the path of crime but Kim no longer has the patience to try to change Shego, soon she would receive another superkick from Kim that would send her crashing into another electrical tower leaving her permanently injured and too traumatized to ever fight properly again. The ironic thing about this ending is that Shego's enjoyment in fighting eventually results in the loss of her fighting ability)

**Bad Ending 2**

Rich People Who Got Their Stuffs Stolen By Shego Putting A Bounty On Shego And Managing To End Her Life or Maim Her Body

(At some point, Shego would learn that there are certain people that you should not steal from - wealthy and well connected people who can make her life a living hell as a payback for her stealing from them)

**The writings for Shego's heel-face turn story:**

Going Back To Villainy For A Short Time And Then Receiving Humbling, Empathy-Inducing Experiences & Finally Focusing On Self-Improvement

(In a scenario where Shego retains all her flaws and continues on the path of crime but Kim still has the patience to try to change Shego, the strategy that Kim would employ against Shego is to ""keep Shego's head hot but allow it no time to cool off"". This means causing Shego to frequently feel a lengthy episode of anger and frustration. And in medical terminology, this is understood as ""subjecting Shego's brain regularly to a lengthy state of hyperstimulation"". And right after each lengthy state of hyperstimulation of her brain, Shego would suffer a period of mental & emotional exhaustion. As for how to make Shego mad, its not hard. Dodging, blocking and deflecting back her attack to frustrate her in a fight, mocking her back or reminding her of her past humiliating defeats to hurt her pride/self-esteem, foiling every criminal scheme she is involved in, ruining her looks (hair, make-up, outfit) that she spends a great deal of time to take care of, taking away her magazines, portable music player, TV & hot tub, disturbing the peace and quiet that she wants to have during a weekend or a vacation, doing the same bad things she had done to others to her so that she would be mad for being at the receiving end of those bad things but at the same time understand how her victims felt when they had been at the receiving end of those bad things she had done to them, forcing her to frequently face the things that make her mad so that she would finally see how flawed & irritable she is, how prone she is to mental & emotional exhaustion and then learn about humility. After all that, self-improvement would naturally become her main goal that she is fully committed to achieve. And from this point onwards, the writings for Shego's Post Graduation character growth story would be applied)",0,1751430256.0,KimPossible,9,0.5,False

1lpmmku,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeeshopowners/comments/1lpmmku/our_future_coffee_shop/,Our Future Coffee Shop . . .,"Hello coffeeshop owners of Reddit.  I’ve been reading here for some time, learning as much as I can.  I’m going to try to contribute, with a post on our coffeeshop plans.  It might be interesting, entertaining, horrifying to you in the know - any comments very welcome.

TL:DR buying a house to convert to commercial, to house my office and my daughter’s planned cafe.

My daughter wants to open a cafe.  Not exactly a “coffeeshop”; though it will start out as a coffeeshop, over time food will be added and become the main business - think a small cafe in France.  She’s worked in commercial kitchens since 16, from dishwasher to prep and line to running a kitchen.  However, her coffee experience is minimal, so she’ll be working in a coffeeshop for the next year or so. 

We noticed a sizeable area of our city that has very good demographics, very walkable, lots of restaurants and bars, but only two coffeeshops, one is a chain store and the other is inconspicuous.  It is weird because this city is  otherwise infested with coffeeshops.  

So we started looking for space there, either very inexpensive retail space or space already with a commercial kitchen.  Nope.  Nada.  Nuthin.  I see why there’s so few coffeeshops here.  How would you open one?  Convert a parking garage?  

Among the way, I started getting frustrated at how much rent I’m paying for my own office - I have a business unrelated to the cafe plans.  So  we also started looking for a commercial building to house both my office and her cafe, with parking for clients.  Nope.  Nada.  Nuthin.

Well, sometimes fruit falls from the tree and hits you on the head.  I noticed an old multistory house for sale in a promising spot in that desired area.  With one parking space. Found the lot was zoned commercial.  Brought in an architect, spent days studying building and city codes, figured out what it will take to convert to a commercial building; cafe below, office above.  

In the purchase process now.  Then it’ll take up to a year to do the work.  That’s a long time but there will be lots of sweat equity while tapping my business cashflow to fund both mortgage and construction costs.  Hoping for six months, preparing for twelve.  Then I will get to stop paying rent on my office and start collecting rent from my daughter’s cafe, and paying just the mortgage.   It’ll be a relief.

So the coffeeshop/cafe part of this story won’t start until next year.  

For what it’s worth, we’ve modeled out the cafe business in as much detail as we can right now.  Dayparts, customer traffic, purchase per customer, unit prices and gross margins, labor and related costs, costs for electricity and water, equipment maintenance and POS, business fees and insurance, etc etc.  

We’ve run grim scenarios that I think are realistic for the first several months when she’s still getting her feet under her.  If she only gets 5-6 customers an hour and they buy a coffee and half a pastry on average, my model says she can barely survive - working the shop alone every day and just managing to make her part of the building mortgage.  Hey, she’s young and used to working 10-14 hour days on the line; she’ll live.  As awareness and traffic grows, and she ramps up the food menu and staffs up, I think it will be a viable - not “lucrative” but decent - business.  

The office part is easy to figure out.  My current office rent, going up 3% a year, that’s what I’ll “make”.  All told, I think the building will 
just barely pay for itself over time.  I may be retired or semi-so and not needing that much of an office by the later years of the mortgage, but the cafe can take over the upper floor and I can move into a basement office or slip into drooling old age.  Or she can convert my office to her own apartment.  Who knows!

What else is interesting.  I already have the necessary espresso equipment x3, thanks to a hobby of restoring espresso machines and picking up equipment from closing shops.  We’re going to put in a full commercial kitchen, which actually may not be the costliest part of the work.  There is a tiny garage that will be converted to roastery - and overflow baking, laundry, etc.  My model says roasting inhouse will be very helpful financially, especially as she’ll have free labor installing, maintaining, and operating the roasting and packaging - that’ll be me.

Ok, knock wood everything goes through, and then I’ll be gutting the kitchen and installing HVAC while writing painful checks to contractors, while she gets experience as a barista and develops her menu, figures out food cost, and plans her social media presence.  

D’you think we should do a Youtube or Insta channel about getting this off the ground?  Or is that just going to be a distraction from the actual work.",0,1751430100.0,coffeeshopowners,2,0.33,False
