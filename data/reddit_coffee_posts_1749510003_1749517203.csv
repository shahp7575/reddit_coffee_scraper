Pride üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è history post.,"Hello everyone. I want to wish y'all a happy pride month. In memory of that I want to talk about LGBTQIA+ history and how police have always opposed progress. 

The riot at The Stonewall inn took place on June 28th 1969. There was an LGBTQIA+ bar called the Stonewall Inn. In the middle of the night a police raid took place where 9 cops arrested bartenders for operating without a liquor license. They charged patrons with solicitation of homosexual behavior. People were arrested for not wearing clothing that aligned with their assigned gender. 

In response to this people began to throw bottles and shotglasses at the police. And eventually barricaded the police inside and started lighting fires. The police called for backup to disperse the crowd. Over the next 5 days spontaneous demonstrations took place in response to the discrimination and harrasment they experienced at the hands of police. 1 year later the very first pride March took place in New York City. At least pride in the context that we currently know it as. 





The Gene Compton's Cafeteria Riots occured in The Tenderloin district of San Francisco in 1966. The tenderloin district was an area of San Francisco where clubs, burlesque shows, and sex work took place. The police would allow sex work and the sale of drugs to occur so they could get bribes. 

Because Gene Compton's was open late and the good was affordable. It was frequented by a lot of trans women and drag queens at Night. In the words of the screaming queens documentary, it was an LGBTQIA+ watering hole for socializing and gender expression. 

Allegedly, one night a police officer tried arresting a drag queen and was assaulting her. She responded by throwing a cup of hot coffee ‚òïÔ∏è in his face. The Cafeteria erupted into a riot. People began throwing sugar shakers and glasses at police and fighting them in response to the regular harrasment and abuse they experienced at the hands of San Francisco PD. You can learn more about the Gene Compton's Cafeteria riots in the documentary screaming queens, which I will link below. 


It's worth mentioning that there had already been years of activism that occured before Stonewall and The Gene Compton's Cafeteria riots.

After her rebirth, the first thing Isabella Claymore did was fall to her knees before her parents, her voice trembling with earnest conviction.

""Dad, Mom... regarding the arranged marriage with the Moretti family, I choose to marry Lucius Moretti.""

Her parents exchanged bewildered glances at their daughter's unexpected request.

""Isabella, honey,"" her mother said gently, ""aren't you in love with Ronan? Lucius is his uncle.""

Something flickered in Isabella's eyes‚Äîa shadow of pain that made her voice catch.

""It's precisely because I know the consequences of loving him that I can't afford to anymore.""

""Dad, Mom, I've never asked anything of you before. As the daughter who's enjoyed all the privileges of this family, I understand that an arranged marriage is my responsibility. But this... this is the one thing I‚Äôm asking for. Just this once‚Äîplease, I‚Äôm begging you.""

Seeing their daughter's forehead red from kowtowing, her parents sighed and helped her to her feet. ""If you‚Äôre really sure about this, we‚Äôll talk to the Morettis. The only thing is‚ÄîLucius is in a pretty powerful position. He might say no. You need to be ready for that.""

While comforting their daughter, the Claymores prepared generous gifts for their visit to the Moretti estate.

As the black sedan disappeared down the driveway, Isabella turned back toward the familiar living room, everything feeling surreal.

Suddenly, her phone buzzed.

\[Midnight Lounge. Come now.\]

It was from Ronan Moretti, along with the bar's address. Thinking this might be the perfect opportunity to clarify the change in marriage arrangements, Isabella headed over.

The moment she pushed open the private room door, a bucket of ice water came crashing down, soaking her completely.

The shock of the cold water penetrated her skin, making her shiver as cruel laughter erupted around her.

""Well, well, if it isn't the Claymore princess! Look at you, drenched like a drowned rat!""

""Serves her right! Always chasing after Ronan like some pathetic lapdog‚Äîthis is what desperate bitches get!""

Ronan approached with a cold expression, his eyes dark with contempt.

""Are you that desperate to marry me? The arrangement was barely discussed, and you're already pushing your parents to finalize wedding plans. Now everyone in Chicago knows about our supposed engagement. Happy now?""

Isabella realized he'd misunderstood everything.

She wiped the water from her face, pushing back her wet hair, and looked at him with unexpected calm.

""The Claymore-Moretti alliance was always inevitable. It makes no difference which family initiates the discussion. But don't worry‚Äîthis has nothing to do with you.""

Ronan froze for a moment, then let out a harsh laugh. ""Nothing to do with me? Don‚Äôt tell me you actually think you‚Äôre marrying someone else. Come on‚Äîwho the hell in the Moretti family would even want you?""

Before Isabella could respond, the door burst open.

Heyar Whitlow stumbled in, tears streaming down her face at the scene before her.

""Ronan‚Ä¶ I heard you‚Äôre getting married. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I should come, but‚Ä¶ I just wanted to say congratulations. I truly hope you and Miss Claymore will be happy together. Forever. Really.""

With that, she fled the room, her sobs echoing in the hallway.

""Heyar, wait!""

Ronan instantly panicked, brushing Isabella aside as he rushed after her.

Isabella crashed into the coffee table, her forehead splitting open. Blood trickled down her face in a gruesome stream.

As pain shot through her skull, she watched their retreating figures and memories from her past life came flooding back.

In her previous life, Isabella and Ronan had grown up together, childhood sweethearts with what seemed like an unbreakable bond.

When their parents mentioned the arranged marriage, Isabella remembered all of Ronan's tender care over the years and chose him without hesitation.

But after the engagement was announced, his attitude toward her began to shift‚Äîfrom anger to indifference, and finally to disgust.

Isabella couldn't understand why, but she married him anyway, believing things would improve after the wedding.

Even after their daughter was born, nothing changed. Then one day, she discovered thousands of photographs of Heyar hidden in his study.

That's when she realized the truth: he'd always loved the housekeeper's daughter, but their class differences made such a relationship impossible.

When Heyar married another man two years later, the marriage was troubled from the start. Ronan drowned his sorrows in alcohol, mourning for her happiness.

The day Heyar's husband died in a car accident was the happiest day of Ronan's life.

Isabella witnessed it all, her heart breaking piece by piece, but she forced herself to focus solely on raising their daughter.

Until the kidnapping.

Both their daughter and Heyar's son were taken. When the kidnappers forced Ronan to choose which child to save, he hesitated for only seconds before choosing the boy‚Äîwho wasn't even his blood relative.

The next moment, their daughter was pushed from the rooftop.

Isabella watched her child die and threw herself from the same building.

Now, given a second chance, she refused to torture herself again. She would cut all ties with Ronan Moretti.

Back in the private room, the crowd continued their cruel mockery.

""You can't force love, right? I mean, sure‚Äîhe might marry her, but what‚Äôs the point if he spends every night in someone else‚Äôs bed?""

""She chased his ass for years just to end up alone in a mansion, waiting on a man who‚Äôs never showing up. huh? Serves her right.""

A sudden buzz cut through the laughter‚ÄîIsabella‚Äôs phone was ringing.

A message from her parents appeared on the screen:

""Isabella! Lucius agreed! The wedding is in two weeks!""

Her usually composed parents had used three exclamation points, showing just how shocked and thrilled they were by Lucius Moretti's acceptance.

Isabella felt a wave of relief wash over her.

She stood up, steadied herself, and faced the room full of mockers with newfound determination in her eyes.

‚ÄúMy future has nothing to do with you‚Äîor with Ronan Moretti.""

""Tell him this: I'm getting married in two weeks. And he won't be the groom.""

Chapter 2

After leaving the bar, Isabella went to the hospital to treat her wound.

When she returned home, she gathered everything related to Ronan‚Äîphotos, letters, gifts‚Äîand packed them all away in boxes.

Her parents arrived just as she was sealing the last container.

""Isabella,"" her mother asked gently, ""have you truly let go of Ronan? You're really over him?""

Seeing their daughter nod without hesitation, both parents visibly relaxed.

""Glad to hear that,"" her father said with a smile. ""Lucius is busy overseas, but the Moretti family arranged a video call today to finalize everything.""

""Lucius is definitely more mature and put-together than Ronan‚Äîhonestly, he‚Äôs a much better fit for you. We never even considered him an option, thought someone like him would never go for this. So yeah, we were pretty shocked when he said yes without hesitation.""

Isabella's eyes filled with tears.

From the moment she'd made her decision, she'd known Lucius would say yes.

In her past life, the age difference and his cold, commanding presence had kept everyone at a distance‚Äîincluding Isabella. They rarely interacted outside of family gatherings.

All she'd known was that he was completely devoted to his work, having built a business empire from nothing, and had never married.

When he died by suicide at thirty-five, they found a stack of love letters while clearing out his belongings.

Each one was addressed ""To my Stella,"" and no one in the Moretti family knew who was stella.

Only Isabella knew. She was born on a night full of falling stars, and ‚ÄúStella‚Äù was the nickname her grandpa always used‚Äîjust his special name for her.

She'd never realized that the cold, unreachable man had loved her silently for an entire lifetime.

Now that fate had given her a second chance, she wanted to give them both an opportunity.

Lost in thought, she barely noticed her parents approaching with an elegant gift box.

""Sweetie, tomorrow's your birthday,"" her mother explained warmly. ""Lucius couldn't fly back in time, so he had his assistant retrieve this from his study. Do you like it?""

Inside lay a breathtakingly brilliant diamond ring.

Isabella recognized it immediately‚Äî""Stardust,"" the most expensive engagement ring sold at Sotheby's in the past fifty years.

She'd seen it once at an exhibition and never forgotten its beauty.

That Lucius would send such a priceless gift filled her heart with unexpected warmth.

In her past life, after their engagement, Ronan had never given her another gift.

She'd forgotten what it felt like to receive something precious from someone who cared.

The next evening, Isabella's birthday celebration began promptly at seven in Chicago's most luxurious hotel.

Guests offered their congratulations, and with the marriage arrangement finally settled, Isabella felt a weight lift from her shoulders. For the first time in months, she found herself genuinely smiling.

Then commotion erupted near the entrance, and every head turned toward the door.

Isabella followed their gaze and froze. Ronan had arrived‚Äîwith Heyar on his arm.

But that wasn't the most humiliating part. The worst was yet to come: a group of Ronan's friends marched through the crowd carrying an enormous placard.

In bold letters across the center, it read:

HYPOCRITE

For: Isabella Claymore

Guests pressed forward to gawk, whispering and pointing.

Isabella's face went pale.

Her hands clenched into fists as she stared at the troublemakers, her voice cutting through the noise like ice.

""What the hell is this?""

The group sneered at her, deliberately raising their voices for everyone to hear.

""Oh please, you tell us! Yesterday you swore Ronan wasn‚Äôt the groom, but the second he got home, his whole family was already knee-deep in wedding plans. Seriously, who plays hard to get like you do, Princess? This sign fits perfectly!""

""Please, we all knew she was faking it yesterday. She‚Äôs been chasing Ronan for years‚Äîgirl left her pride at the door a long time ago. And now she suddenly doesn‚Äôt want him? Yeah, right. Classic move. Like, who else is she gonna marry? He‚Äôs the only Moretti her age.""

Cruel laughter rippled through the ballroom.

Ronan's expression was stone-cold as he addressed her. ""Isabella, stop with these hypocritical games. Don't think this will get my attention. Once we‚Äôre married, you‚Äôll have the Moretti name‚Äîdon‚Äôt expect a damn thing more.""

She'd heard those exact words in her previous life.

And he'd kept his promise. Seven years of marriage, and the name was all she'd ever received.

The crowd buzzed with gossip as Isabella took a shaky breath and raised her voice.

""Ronan Moretti! I don't need your name. Listen carefully‚Äîyou are not my groom, and it's not with someone my age. It's with your‚Äî""

Before she could finish, chaos erupted.

Heyar suddenly clutched her face, red welts spreading across her skin as she collapsed into Ronan's arms.

""Ronan‚Ä¶ I‚ÄîI can‚Äôt breathe‚Ä¶ why are there so many hyacinths? You know I‚Äôm allergic‚Ä¶""

Hyacinths were Isabella's favorite flowers, and the ballroom was filled with elaborate arrangements.

Hearing Heyar's increasingly labored breathing, Ronan panicked, calling her name frantically before sweeping her into his arms.

As he rushed toward the exit, he shouted two commands:

To Isabella: ""When we‚Äôre married, there will be no hyacinths‚Äîever. Not in the house, not at events, not anywhere.""

To his friends: ""After I leave, destroy this entire party!""

""Got it, boss. Consider it done.""

The moment he disappeared, the group descended like vandals, grabbing chairs and wreaking havoc.

The birthday cake splattered across the marble floor, crystal glasses shattered against walls, and flowers were trampled into pulp as guests fled in terror.

""Stop! You have no right to destroy my birthday party! Stop!""

""You're marrying our boy Ronan, sweetheart! Wife obeys husband‚Äîwhatever he says goes! Ha ha ha!""

Isabella screamed until her voice gave out, but couldn't stop the rampage. Her protests only brought more cruel laughter.

Eventually, every guest had fled.

Her birthday party ended in ruins.

Chapter 3

For the next several days, Isabella locked herself in her room with red-rimmed eyes, refusing to see anyone.

When her parents learned what Ronan had done at the birthday party, they felt even more certain that not choosing him had been the right decision. They wanted to confront the Moretti family directly, but Isabella, who had barely stepped out of her room in days, stopped them.

With the wedding so close, she didn't want any more complications.

After calming her parents, she left the house carrying a design sketch.

She hadn't been hiding in her room obsessing over Ronan‚Äîhe meant nothing to her now. Instead, she'd been designing a wedding ring for Lucius, crafted by her own hand.

She knew how much ‚ÄúStardust‚Äù meant to him, and she wanted to give him something just as meaningful in return.

She gave the design to the family's jeweler, asking him to have a master craftsman create it personally.

But when the agreed deadline arrived, the ring never came.

When Isabella inquired, she learned that Ronan had visited the shop days earlier. He'd spotted the ring immediately, asked a few questions, then simply taken it.

His parting words: ""It's for me anyway. No need to call Isabella for pickup.""

The staff, knowing about the Claymore-Moretti engagement, hadn't intervened.

Isabella's heart sank like a stone.

She rushed to the Moretti estate to retrieve the ring, only to find Heyar sitting among piles of delivery boxes, cooing sweetly.

""Mr. Ronan, you secretly cleared out my shopping cart again! You're so sweet‚ÄîI'll never be able to repay you.""

""I do it because I want to. You don't need to repay anything. And I've told you before‚Äîstop calling me that. Use my name.""

Heyar blushed prettily as she whispered, ""Ronan.""

Watching their intimate exchange, Isabella didn't even blink as she strode through the door.

Hearing footsteps, Ronan looked up and frowned.

""What are you doing here?""

""The wedding ring you took. Give it back.""

Seeing Isabella's outstretched hand, Ronan raised an eyebrow.

""It's gone.""

Isabella's gaze sharpened, her voice hardening. ""What do you mean, gone?""

Before Ronan could make up an excuse, Heyar spoke up from the floor, her voice timid.

""Oh‚Ä¶ Miss Claymore, I just saw online that wedding rings are great for opening packages, so I used it for a few‚Ä¶ hundred. It‚Äôs a little scratched now. I mean‚Ä¶ if it still matters to you, you can have it back?""

She opened her palm, revealing the once-beautiful ring now marred with deep scratches.

Ronan had given her wedding ring‚Äîdesigned with love for another man‚Äîto Heyar as a glorified box cutter?

Rage ignited in Isabella's chest, spreading through her entire body.

Unable to control herself any longer, she stared at the two uncaring faces before her, her eyes blazing.

""‚ÄúRonan, what the hell gave you the right to take something that wasn‚Äôt yours? And you, Heyar‚Äîhow dare you treat it like garbage? Do either of you even understand what basic respect means?""

Seeing her break down over a simple ring ruined Ronan's good mood, irritation creeping into his voice.

""The wedding ring was meant for me anyway. What are you making such a fuss about?""

""Oh, and I've decided we'll just get the marriage certificate. No ceremony. So your ring design was pointless‚Äîdon't waste any more effort.""

His dismissive attitude made Isabella clench her fists as she declared once more:

""Ronan, that wedding ring was never meant for you!""

""If not me, then who? Isabella, enough. You‚Äôre taking this way too far!""

As he spoke, Ronan carelessly tossed the damaged ring aside and pulled Heyar toward the door.

""Don't waste time arguing with her. Heyar, didn't you say you wanted to learn to drive? Come on, I'll teach you.""

Watching them leave, Isabella felt waves of anger and helplessness crash over her. She wanted to chase after them, but first she had to find the ring.

It took thirty minutes of searching before she found it in a flower bed.

Carefully tucking it into her pocket, she left immediately. There wasn't time to create a new one‚Äîshe'd have to find someone to repair this one and hope it could be restored.

Just as she stepped outside the estate, she heard a strange noise.

Looking up, she saw a car barreling straight toward her. Isabella's eyes widened in shock.

The impact sent her flying ten meters, landing in a spreading pool of blood.

Heyar climbed out of the driver's seat, putting on a show of terror.

""Oh no, oh no! I didn‚Äôt mean to! I‚Äôm still new at driving‚ÄîI must‚Äôve hit the gas instead of the brake‚Ä¶ how stupid of me! This is awful‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs so much blood! Miss Claymore looks really bad‚Ä¶ Ronan, is she gonna be okay?""

Seeing the stone steps stained crimson, Ronan frowned but pulled Heyar into his arms, comforting her gently.

""She's fine. Isabella's always been dramatic‚Äîthis is just another performance. Just ignore her. She'll stop pretending when she gets tired of it. Don't be scared, Heyar. Don't cry.""

Through her haze of pain, hearing those words made Isabella feel cold to her very core. Tears she could no longer hold back began to fall.

Ronan... I thought that even if you didn't love me, after all our years of growing up together, you'd feel something. Anything.

But you'd rather comfort Heyar than care whether I live or die.

Why did I ever fall in love with you in my past life?

She tried to reach for her phone to call for help, but her strength gave out completely.

Endless darkness crashed over her, drowning her consciousness.

When she opened her eyes again, it was the next day.

Shortly after she awoke, a doctor entered with her chart, his voice stern.

""Why wasn't she brought in immediately after the accident? Making her lose all that blood before seeking medical attention‚Äîthat's completely irresponsible.""

Remembering the scene before she'd lost consciousness, Isabella moved her lips but could only manage a bitter smile. How could she explain that her childhood sweetheart had been too busy comforting another woman to save her life?

The doctor didn't press the issue, simply continuing, ""Where's your husband? He needs to handle the admission paperwork.""

Still groggy from anesthesia, Isabella answered without thinking.

""He's overseas.""

The moment the words left her mouth, the hospital room door swung open.

Ronan stood in the doorway, staring at her intently.

little blurbs about each from a completely amateur scent enjoyer

coffee break: it's 1992. a young woman wearing a tweed blazer with a gold brooch, gold hoops, and dark red lipstick is sitting next to you on the bus, reading a pulp sci fi novel with the smallest print you've ever seen. she pulls out a pack of gum, juicy fruit, and unwraps two pieces. you sit in silence, your thin headphones cutting into the top of your head. it's her stop. you shrink into your seat to let her off, and as she shuffles past you, you're stunned by a waft of powdery tonka bean and lavender. the sharp scent of her hair products lingers in the air as you hear the click of her black pumps down the aisle. you settle back in, take a sip of your lukewarm latte, and wonder if you should've asked her number. 

jazz club: a humid evening in the last dredges of summer. the haze sticks to you; or it passed right through you. you're on a sidewalk patio outside of your favorite bar, at the edge of downtown, sipping a manhattan on the rocks. sweat beads at your temples as you take a drag of your cigarillo, the sweetness lingering on your lips. then, the cold bittersweetness, and your hand almost slipping on the condensation of the glass. amber beer garden lights sway in the subtle breeze, and the bar door swings open, breaking the stillness. the sound of esoteric music, clanking glassware and laughter intensifies as quickly as it fades away, and your friend approaches you to bid you goodnight. a fast hug, and you can smell the bourbon on their breath as much as the vanilla from their perfume. you quip a farewell, and they laugh loudly, stumbling into the distance. 

paradise garden: you finally feel the last chill of spring leave the air as you step out of the coffee shop in late may. smoothie in hand, you decide to walk through the neighborhood and gawk at houses you could never afford. sweetness dances in the air as elaborate gardens sway in the breeze - hydrangeas, honeysuckles, poppies, rose varieties. sipping your tropical drink, your sandals slap against the warm pavement, and your lover brushes the hair behind your ear to kiss your cheek. a smile crinkles your eyes, and the cold metal of your bracelet tickles your wrist as you slide your free hand into their back pocket. leaves gossip overhead. windchimes tinkle. 

my deodorant: spearmint gum at the doctor's office. your cat's flea medicine still singing your nose as you light a stick of heady incense - the thick kind that crumbles in your fingers. lifting your arms to stretch towards the sun as you walk through a field full of sappy stemmed roughage in 90 degree weather, small barbs pulling at your socks. you smell yourself, your shampoo, the body wash you used that morning, the medicinal, woody mint, the clean thickness of your sweat. 

father figure: sitting between your parents in your tiny baptist church, your mother's fruity perfume mixes with your father's body wash. the hot scent of guilt is the most prominent as you restlessly bounce your leg, thinking about the girl you go to sunday school with. sometimes, you use your father's body wash for your morning shower. then you sit on the school bus, smelling your arms, wishing you could cut your hair shorter. tights with runs and scuffed mary janes. morning prayers, and the raunchy queer fanfiction you read when your parents go to sleep. the light in the window from the lamp you always leave on. smelling your mom's perfume while you play basketball in gym, your picture day clothes folded inside your backpack in the women's locker room. you don't change back into them after class. 

vert desir: what you imagine elves must smell like. sitting on a slippy rock by the creek, you feel moss squish between your fingers and try to imagine you're inside of the fantasy book you're reading. you end up taking a break from the passage and close your eyes, feeling warm sun break through the canopy. the creek nearby babbles excitedly, and the cool air brings the spongey smell of decomposition with it. you dip your pinky in the water; freezing! it suddenly makes you miss the beach. you daydream of warm sand and waves so loud that your thoughts just disappear. imaginary saltwater crisps up your hair, and you almost taste it as you lick your lips. you decide to scramble up the hill and head back home, dried mud caking your shoes and splashed up your legs. you take a hot shower with your tea tree body wash and cozy into clean sheets for a dreamless nap.

I want to know if I‚Äôm over-reacting and should continue being friends with X after he broke up with me.

Tl;dr: I started seeing someone at first not seriously. He agreed to give us a shot but now doesn‚Äôt feel the spark. He wants to keep everything the same just take the relationship part out of it. Looking back on our relationship though, I just feel weird and don‚Äôt know if I should stay friends.

This is going to be super long and kind of rambling. I want to be as objective as possible and give all of the relevant information. Some of the information might not be so relevant. My mind is just racing full of thoughts.

I (30nb) was dating my ex, X (29m) for 6 months. I have another partner, A (29f) that I‚Äôve been with for over a decade. A and I are polyamorous. X knew about all of this going in. They‚Äôre cool but they didn‚Äôt have any romantic chemistry so they‚Äôre just friendly with one another. We‚Äôve all hung out together on a number of occasions.

I know that I‚Äôm a very emotional person and can overreact to things. My emotions run so high that I form feelings and relationships very quickly, often too quickly. I know these things about myself and I try to speak to partners about it, not to excuse it but to try to establish boundaries. I don‚Äôt want to be clingy or suffocating so I want to know what my partner is comfortable with. For example, I‚Äôm very physically affectionate. I love cuddles and random forehead kisses. I just like to pamper my partner and be sweet with them. However if my partner doesn‚Äôt want me to straddle them and cuddle, I need to know that. I also know it‚Äôs not my partner‚Äôs responsibility to constantly restate and defend boundaries, so I check in to make sure everything is ok and we‚Äôre on the same page.

Going into this, X was not interested in a romantic relationship. His last was devoid of affection and he had gotten used to being independent and on his own. We talked for an hour the night before we met. Then Saturday the next day we met for drinks and then went back to his place. I spent the night and we spent the weekend having sex. There were no expectations.

We considered adding a third person to the bedroom. A joined us a few times but X and A didn‚Äôt have any chemistry so she stopped joining us. We talked about people on dating websites. I suggested we make a joint account so that we will be able to find people we both like that are interested in that. He wanted to keep our accounts separate, so we did.

One month in, I had expressed that I wanted a romantic relationship with him. We had a few conversations about it. He was reserved for the above mentioned reasons. Also he was unsure about entering a relationship with someone who was already in a relationship. I had brought the conversation up a lot and felt I was being pushy so I wrote him a letter apologizing and letting him know that I was content with the relationship we had. We got along well, had a lot of fun together, and we had great sex.

The next day, New Year‚Äôs Eve, was his birthday. A had other plans so I spent it with him. We went out, had drinks, and had a good time.

Fast forward two weeks. We‚Äôre at about the two-month mark. I had two dates in one day on a day I would have usually spent with X. This was the only time I saw anyone else during these 6 months. The next day I got to spend some time with X and he had me read a letter he wrote the previous day when we weren‚Äôt together.

In that letter, he further explained his reservations about being in a serious relationship with me. But in the end he really liked me and he wanted to try. At one point he said ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt want to lose a friend again.‚Äù

One thing that I‚Äôve noticed is that a lot of his friends that are attracted to men, even coworkers, are previous sexual partners. I‚Äôm not trying to slut-shame him. He can have sex with anyone he wants. That‚Äôs just not how I navigate my relationships. My friends and sexual partners stay separated. I especially don‚Äôt date or mess around with coworkers. This is all a side-note but it becomes relevant later.

We‚Äôre still hanging out nearly every weekend for the entirety of the weekend. I go with him on errands and we mostly just chill at his place. He would make fun of me for immediately undressing when we were at his place. I told him it‚Äôs because I do that when I‚Äôm at home. If I‚Äôm just going to be lounging around I‚Äôm doing it in my underwear. He also had his ex‚Äôs robe that I would use when I was at his place.

For Valentine‚Äôs Day, I wrote him a poem and A helped me paint on it a heart with his favorite colors. I sent him a draft of the poem earlier and in the margins I was writing my thoughts as I came up with the poem. My cropping was bad and he saw it. He told me it was the nicest thing anyone has ever done for him.

About three months in, he communicates with me that he doesn‚Äôt have enough time to spend with his friends since we‚Äôve been spending all of our weekends together. I respected his wish. I knew I was rushing it and wanted to give him more space.

Things were fairly good but about 4 months in, my coworker pointed out that it was weird I‚Äôve never met any of his friends and that his parents didn‚Äôt know he was seeing anyone. X had told me that he used to be a serial monogamist and introduced a lot of people to his parents. He just wanted to be more careful with introducing partners to them. I understand but I still think it‚Äôs weird they didn‚Äôt even know he was dating someone.

As for his friends, when we first started talking, he mentioned introducing me to them. However at the four month mark, I asked if his friends knew about me. He told me that some did and some didn‚Äôt. Whenever I would ask to meet them or talked to him about maybe having a bad movie night to ‚Äúfinally bring all his friends together‚Äù like he said he wanted to do, he would change the subject. I only met one of his friends that he was interested in having a threesome with. Well I only ever spoke to this person over the phone because there were just a lot of scheduling issues.

** side note: He told me he was upset with this friend, R, for calling his last ‚Äúfriend‚Äù a bitch, though in a playful way. They weren‚Äôt talking and X was waiting for an apology to even speak to R. When I was hanging out with X and talking to R on speaker phone, we went back through the messages. R wasn‚Äôt calling X‚Äôs friend a bitch. R was calling X a bitch. So all of that drama wasn‚Äôt even real. All X had to say for himself was that he was drunk when he read it. **

He also suggested having a threesome with one of my coworkers. It was really out of the blue because I only started recently hanging out with this girl and I told him before I don‚Äôt mess around with coworkers. She‚Äôs also 22. He could hit her up if he wants I just don‚Äôt want to be a part of it.

Otherwise, X was still active on his dating/hook-up apps. He was talking to another couple next state over. They haven‚Äôt met yet. I‚Äôve even been with him when people on dating apps send dick pics or nudes. It bothered me a little, because I wasn‚Äôt showing off A to him like that. I deleted my dating apps but he didn‚Äôt know about that.  I was just content with the partners I had at the time. I never expected him to only date me when I had a whole other partner. I just found it weird that he would show me these things.

Anyway, I remember the last time we had sex was May 3rd, that was the last time the two of us hung out before I got sick. We would always have rough sex. I would tell him I would like to have slower more sensual sex from time to time but he told me fucking me hard was too fun. Apparently I‚Äôve been the only person to take it so rough for so long from him and he felt the need to really do what he can i guess. Because of a condition I have, I don‚Äôt really have a gag reflex so he would have me lie down with my head hanging over the bed and go to town. I remember that night having to tap out a lot during to breathe. So the next day when I had a sore throat I thought it was just because of that. Turns out nope, COVID.

So I was out for a week. Then I went back to work and immediately had to go to the hospital because of a workplace incident. So I was screwed for most of May. X did bring me a care package when I was sick and visited me in the hospital. He was there for only an hour but it was pretty far away because I had to see a specialist. While he was there, he met my mom. They didn‚Äôt really speak while the doctor was there. After the doctor left my mom was talking to some relatives on the phone and X sat on my bed with me and we chatted/scrolled through Reddit together. I did what I usually do, random pecks to the cheek. Caressing his arm when he talks. He‚Äôs told me all of this is ok to him. He didn‚Äôt reciprocate and I figured it was just because my mom was there.

When he left my mom mentioned to me that he didn‚Äôt seem very interested in me. I talked to him and he seemed to get a little defensive. He said that it was just because my mom was there. I said my mom is just looking out for me and he said something along the lines of I should always be careful. I don‚Äôt remember exactly what it was but it just felt off. I asked if I had to be careful with him and he just said ‚Äúit‚Äôs good advice in general.‚Äù

I was already getting weird feelings of him pulling away but when I would ask him about it he would reassure me that things are fine. When I finally got out of the hospital, A and I went to pick up our cat from his place. He seemed really tired. At one point I tried to sit on his lap and cuddle like I often do. He just kinda sat there, didn‚Äôt even move his arms. He just appeared annoyed so I got off of him. A and I offered to go pick him up some food but he wanted to instead go out. A and I had just ate so we only got drinks. He paid for all of us, making a joke about ‚Äútaking care of his bitches.‚Äù The irony.

The following weekend, he went to a friends birthday party. At this point we have been dating each other for over 6 months and I wasn‚Äôt even considered to be invited. If I‚Äôm not invited I‚Äôm not gonna ask, but it kind of hurt. The next day we had a study date. I couldn‚Äôt drive so he picked me up from my apartment and we went to a coffee shop. When I first got in the car he hardly touched my lips when he kissed me hello. I assumed it was because I had lipstick on. Now I don‚Äôt know.

The date was nice. He wasn‚Äôt overly affectionate but he was showing me some. We made plans to start volunteering together. In a previous conversation we even talked about going on a trip together. We were only there a couple of hours. He asked if I was at a good stopping point and he drove me home. The ride home was about 30 minutes. We leaned our heads on each other during traffic. We had a pleasant conversation. I mentioned I would like to meet his friends and he just changed the subject.

So he parked in front of my apartment. When I was about to leave the car he asked if we can chat. He was smiling and took off his sunglasses. I just thought he wanted to talk some more. Then he told me he has no romantic feelings for me. He likes me as a person and he‚Äôs attracted to me but he couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúforce‚Äù himself to feel a certain way. He kept repeating that. He wanted to keep everything the same but take the relationship part out of it. He said I was obviously more invested than he was and it wasn‚Äôt fair to me. I was quiet for most of it but told him that I could tell. I was going to just leave but then he thanked me for listening and told me he understands if I need time. I was just trying really hard to not cry so I don‚Äôt really remember what I said. But I left.

He‚Äôs right, I invested a lot into this despite the fact he never treated me like a real partner. And knowing that nearly all of his friends are previous sexual partners. I just wonder how many of his friends were people in my shoes who tried to love him but he decided to keep at an arms-length but still have sex with. I don‚Äôt know if it even matters but I just feel so foolish. He said he didn‚Äôt want to lose a friend again. Is this what he did to them?

On the one hand, I had a good time with him and want to be his friend. On the other hand I wonder if he even respects me. I had A pick my stuff up from X‚Äôs house. I also returned the gifts I‚Äôve gotten from him over the last 6 months 1) 2 stuffed Pok√©mon for Valentine‚Äôs Day, 2) a souvenir shot glass for Christmas, 3) a hoodie that the thrift stores didn‚Äôt want to take during one of his errands. I have given him bouquets of flowers and other thoughtful gifts.

I told A to tell him I wanted nothing to do with him. A tells me he seemed confused and somewhat annoyed by my reaction. I was not there so I don‚Äôt really know what went on.

That night I got really drunk and texted him. I don‚Äôt remember what I said because while I was drunk I deleted everything I have of him. He was blocked at the time so I don‚Äôt know if he responded. A few days later I texted him, apologizing for whatever it was that I said. I just knew I was very emotional at the time. He just said ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, I understand.‚Äù Today I told him to delete any pictures of me, including SFW ones. I honestly didn‚Äôt know he had any of me. That was another thing I would ask to do a lot in the relationship, take pictures. Aside from one picture I had, everything else was sexual. I think the pictures he had were pictures he saved of me from my profile that he was using to gauge interest in potential thirds.

I don‚Äôt know. I feel like I wasn‚Äôt valued here and he doesn‚Äôt deserve to be my friend. But I also miss him. AITA",0,1749516618.0,AITAH,2,0.5,False

I (30nb) was dating my ex, X (29m) for 6 months. I have another partner, A (29f) that I‚Äôve been with for over a decade. A and I are polyamorous. X knew about all of this going in. They‚Äôre cool but they didn‚Äôt have any romantic chemistry so they‚Äôre just friendly with one another. We‚Äôve all hung out together on a number of occasions. 

I know that I‚Äôm a very emotional person and can overreact to things. My emotions run so high that I form feelings and relationships very quickly, often too quickly. I know these things about myself and I try to speak to partners about it, not to excuse it but to try to establish boundaries. I don‚Äôt want to be clingy or suffocating so I want to know what my partner is comfortable with. For example, I‚Äôm very physically affectionate. I love cuddles and random forehead kisses. I just like to pamper my partner and be sweet with them. However if my partner doesn‚Äôt want me to straddle them and cuddle, I need to know that. I also know it‚Äôs not my partner‚Äôs responsibility to constantly restate and defend boundaries, so I check in to make sure everything is ok and we‚Äôre on the same page. 

Going into this, X was not interested in a romantic relationship. His last was devoid of affection and he had gotten used to being independent and on his own. We talked for an hour the night before we met. Then Saturday the next day we met for drinks and then went back to his place. I spent the night and we spent the weekend having sex. There were no expectations. 

We considered adding a third person to the bedroom. A joined us a few times but X and A didn‚Äôt have any chemistry so she stopped joining us. We talked about people on dating websites. I suggested we make a joint account so that we will be able to find people we both like that are interested in that. He wanted to keep our accounts separate, so we did. 

One month in, I had expressed that I wanted a romantic relationship with him. We had a few conversations about it. He was reserved for the above mentioned reasons. Also he was unsure about entering a relationship with someone who was already in a relationship. I had brought the conversation up a lot and felt I was being pushy so I wrote him a letter apologizing and letting him know that I was content with the relationship we had. We got along well, had a lot of fun together, and we had great sex.

The next day, New Year‚Äôs Eve, was his birthday. A had other plans so I spent it with him. We went out, had drinks, and had a good time.  

Fast forward two weeks. We‚Äôre at about the two-month mark. I had two dates in one day on a day I would have usually spent with X. This was the only time I saw anyone else during these 6 months. The next day I got to spend some time with X and he had me read a letter he wrote the previous day when we weren‚Äôt together. 

In that letter, he further explained his reservations about being in a serious relationship with me. But in the end he really liked me and he wanted to try. At one point he said ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt want to lose a friend again.‚Äù

One thing that I‚Äôve noticed is that a lot of his friends that are attracted to men, even coworkers, are previous sexual partners. I‚Äôm not trying to slut-shame him. He can have sex with anyone he wants. That‚Äôs just not how I navigate my relationships. My friends and sexual partners stay separated. I especially don‚Äôt date or mess around with coworkers. This is all a side-note but it becomes relevant later. 

We‚Äôre still hanging out nearly every weekend for the entirety of the weekend. I go with him on errands and we mostly just chill at his place. He would make fun of me for immediately undressing when we were at his place. I told him it‚Äôs because I do that when I‚Äôm at home. If I‚Äôm just going to be lounging around I‚Äôm doing it in my underwear. He also had his ex‚Äôs robe that I would use when I was at his place. 

For Valentine‚Äôs Day, I wrote him a poem and A helped me paint on it a heart with his favorite colors. I sent him a draft of the poem earlier and in the margins I was writing my thoughts as I came up with the poem. My cropping was bad and he saw it. He told me it was the nicest thing anyone has ever done for him. 

About three months in, he communicates with me that he doesn‚Äôt have enough time to spend with his friends since we‚Äôve been spending all of our weekends together. I respected his wish. I knew I was rushing it and wanted to give him more space. 

Things were fairly good but about 4 months in, my coworker pointed out that it was weird I‚Äôve never met any of his friends and that his parents didn‚Äôt know he was seeing anyone. X had told me that he used to be a serial monogamist and introduced a lot of people to his parents. He just wanted to be more careful with introducing partners to them. I understand but I still think it‚Äôs weird they didn‚Äôt even know he was dating someone. 

As for his friends, when we first started talking, he mentioned introducing me to them. However at the four month mark, I asked if his friends knew about me. He told me that some did and some didn‚Äôt. Whenever I would ask to meet them or talked to him about maybe having a bad movie night to ‚Äúfinally bring all his friends together‚Äù like he said he wanted to do, he would change the subject. I only met one of his friends that he was interested in having a threesome with. Well I only ever spoke to this person over the phone because there were just a lot of scheduling issues. 

** side note: He told me he was upset with this friend, R, for calling his last ‚Äúfriend‚Äù a bitch, though in a playful way. They weren‚Äôt talking and X was waiting for an apology to even speak to R. When I was hanging out with X and talking to R on speaker phone, we went back through the messages. R wasn‚Äôt calling X‚Äôs friend a bitch. R was calling X a bitch. So all of that drama wasn‚Äôt even real. All X had to say for himself was that he was drunk when he read it. **

He also suggested having a threesome with one of my coworkers. It was really out of the blue because I only started recently hanging out with this girl and I told him before I don‚Äôt mess around with coworkers. She‚Äôs also 22. He could hit her up if he wants I just don‚Äôt want to be a part of it. 

Otherwise, X was still active on his dating/hook-up apps. He was talking to another couple next state over. They haven‚Äôt met yet. I‚Äôve even been with him when people on dating apps send dick pics or nudes. It bothered me a little, because I wasn‚Äôt showing off A to him like that. I deleted my dating apps but he didn‚Äôt know about that.  I was just content with the partners I had at the time. I never expected him to only date me when I had a whole other partner. I just found it weird that he would show me these things. 

Anyway, I remember the last time we had sex was May 3rd, that was the last time the two of us hung out before I got sick. We would always have rough sex. I would tell him I would like to have slower more sensual sex from time to time but he told me fucking me hard was too fun. Apparently I‚Äôve been the only person to take it so rough for so long from him and he felt the need to really do what he can i guess. Because of a condition I have, I don‚Äôt really have a gag reflex so he would have me lie down with my head hanging over the bed and go to town. I remember that night having to tap out a lot during to breathe. So the next day when I had a sore throat I thought it was just because of that. Turns out nope, COVID. 

So I was out for a week. Then I went back to work and immediately had to go to the hospital because of a workplace incident. So I was screwed for most of May. X did bring me a care package when I was sick and visited me in the hospital. He was there for only an hour but it was pretty far away because I had to see a specialist. While he was there, he met my mom. They didn‚Äôt really speak while the doctor was there. After the doctor left my mom was talking to some relatives on the phone and X sat on my bed with me and we chatted/scrolled through Reddit together. I did what I usually do, random pecks to the cheek. Caressing his arm when he talks. He‚Äôs told me all of this is ok to him. He didn‚Äôt reciprocate and I figured it was just because my mom was there. 

When he left my mom mentioned to me that he didn‚Äôt seem very interested in me. I talked to him and he seemed to get a little defensive. He said that it was just because my mom was there. I said my mom is just looking out for me and he said something along the lines of I should always be careful. I don‚Äôt remember exactly what it was but it just felt off. I asked if I had to be careful with him and he just said ‚Äúit‚Äôs good advice in general.‚Äù

I was already getting weird feelings of him pulling away but when I would ask him about it he would reassure me that things are fine. When I finally got out of the hospital, A and I went to pick up our cat from his place. He seemed really tired. At one point I tried to sit on his lap and cuddle like I often do. He just kinda sat there, didn‚Äôt even move his arms. He just appeared annoyed so I got off of him. A and I offered to go pick him up some food but he wanted to instead go out. A and I had just ate so we only got drinks. He paid for all of us, making a joke about ‚Äútaking care of his bitches.‚Äù The irony. 

The following weekend, he went to a friends birthday party. At this point we have been dating each other for over 6 months and I wasn‚Äôt even considered to be invited. If I‚Äôm not invited I‚Äôm not gonna ask, but it kind of hurt. The next day we had a study date. I couldn‚Äôt drive so he picked me up from my apartment and we went to a coffee shop. When I first got in the car he hardly touched my lips when he kissed me hello. I assumed it was because I had lipstick on. Now I don‚Äôt know. 

The date was nice. He wasn‚Äôt overly affectionate but he was showing me some. We made plans to start volunteering together. In a previous conversation we even talked about going on a trip together. We were only there a couple of hours. He asked if I was at a good stopping point and he drove me home. The ride home was about 30 minutes. We leaned our heads on each other during traffic. We had a pleasant conversation. I mentioned I would like to meet his friends and he just changed the subject. 

So he parked in front of my apartment. When I was about to leave the car he asked if we can chat. He was smiling and took off his sunglasses. I just thought he wanted to talk some more. Then he told me he has no romantic feelings for me. He likes me as a person and he‚Äôs attracted to me but he couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúforce‚Äù himself to feel a certain way. He kept repeating that. He wanted to keep everything the same but take the relationship part out of it. He said I was obviously more invested than he was and it wasn‚Äôt fair to me. I was quiet for most of it but told him that I could tell. I was going to just leave but then he thanked me for listening and told me he understands if I need time. I was just trying really hard to not cry so I don‚Äôt really remember what I said. But I left. 

He‚Äôs right, I invested a lot into this despite the fact he never treated me like a real partner. And knowing that nearly all of his friends are previous sexual partners. I just wonder how many of his friends were people in my shoes who tried to love him but he decided to keep at an arms-length but still have sex with. I don‚Äôt know if it even matters but I just feel so foolish. He said he didn‚Äôt want to lose a friend again. Is this what he did to them?

On the one hand, I had a good time with him and want to be his friend. On the other hand I wonder if he even respects me. I had A pick my stuff up from X‚Äôs house. I also returned the gifts I‚Äôve gotten from him over the last 6 months 1) 2 stuffed Pok√©mon for Valentine‚Äôs Day, 2) a souvenir shot glass for Christmas, 3) a hoodie that the thrift stores didn‚Äôt want to take during one of his errands. I have given him bouquets of flowers and other thoughtful gifts. 

I told A to tell him I wanted nothing to do with him. A tells me he seemed confused and somewhat annoyed by my reaction. I was not there so I don‚Äôt really know what went on. 

That night I got really drunk and texted him. I don‚Äôt remember what I said because while I was drunk I deleted everything I have of him. He was blocked at the time so I don‚Äôt know if he responded. A few days later I texted him, apologizing for whatever it was that I said. I just knew I was very emotional at the time. He just said ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, I understand.‚Äù Today I told him to delete any pictures of me, including SFW ones. I honestly didn‚Äôt know he had any of me. That was another thing I would ask to do a lot in the relationship, take pictures. Aside from one picture I had, everything else was sexual. I think the pictures he had were pictures he saved of me from my profile that he was using to gauge interest in potential thirds. 

I don‚Äôt know. I feel like I wasn‚Äôt valued here and he doesn‚Äôt deserve to be my friend. But I also miss him. AIO",1,1749516394.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

1l7lhmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Westchester/comments/1l7lhmp/moving_from_brooklyn/,Moving from Brooklyn,"Hi! I know there are tons of posts like this buuuuuut...
After 5 years in Brooklyn, we want to move to the burbs in about a year. We have 2 young kids and want more space, more greenery, slower pace of life, etc. I have been driving through much of Westchester and am struggling to decide which area is the best fit for our budget and ideal lifestyle. 

Budget: $1.5 million

Wants: 
*4 bedroom 3 bath house, ideally with some historic charm and/or in a historic ""quaint"" neighborhood. Open to cosmetic updates but want to avoid total renovation. 

*Walkability - desperately want sidewalks and ability to walk to at least a few things (coffee shop, park, library, grocery store, and/or train station). Fine with smaller lot. 

*Vibrant, charming downtown with restaurants, coffee shops, and some shopping 
*Family-friendly neighborhood - Want to be in an area where I see my neighbors, see people walking their dogs, kids riding their bikes, kids trick or treat on Halloween, etc. We do NOT want ""private,"" ""sleepy, ""quiet."" 

*Commute into NYC of 1 hour or less (husband has to go in ~3 days a week)
*Good schools so we have that option, but also open to sending our kids to Catholic school as a cheaper alternative to secular private school as one of us is Catholic

Where do you think we should land? The Cedar Knolls area of Bronxville seems to fit the bill. I know it's technically Yonkers but easily walkable into downtown Bronxville and Tuckahoe. Elementary school in that neighborhood is good, and high school is so far off for us that I'm not too worried about it being lower-rated. 

Other places we have considered:

*Rye, but maybe too expensive and too country club-y for us 

*Larchmont, but maybe too expensive 

*Mamaroneck, but downtown lacked some of the charm of other towns

*Rivertowns - Haven't visited yet. Think I'll love Tarrytown but concerned that larger retailers (e.g. Target) are 15+ min away. Maybe not that important?

*Connecticut - Greenwich seems too expensive and further out is too far of a commute. Stamford could maybe work. ",1,1749516284.0,Westchester,8,0.67,False

I am 26, he is 31. We are not married but have been together for 5+years and plan on getting married after I finish my degree (Yes, i know the importance of the protection of marriage, I just have a full ride at my university). 

I am a stay at home mom with a 1.5 year old and a baby due in November. Our rental agreement says we have to be out by October 2026. We would like to buy a home that we can pay off quickly so we can move onto a large acreage and start a farm. I am planning to homeschool the kids. He works and currently makes $75k/year at main job and our side job brings in about $10k-$20k, but he is moving up and should be over $100k main job, and $30k-$70k with our side job within the next 2-3 years. This prediction is based off of training/prep already in the works from higher ups and personal investment in higher value products for sale with high demand with better marketing. We do not have anyone to watch the kids for me to work, so staying home makes the most sense with toddlers at the time being. We already only buy clothes at thrift stores, avoid eating out more than twice a month, make coffee at home, ect. We have dogs to take care of as well, but we don't have any memberships or subscriptions. We are saving $300/week. We don't have car payments, just paying for fixes when something goes wrong with them (2007 jeep & 2015 impala paid off and in great condition, low gas milage, and he knows how to personally work on both).

Btw his retirement is pension with equity, so no worries there. I am also part time in college, which I have a full ride. Finishing my Elementary education bachelor's so I will have the option to work if it is financially the right move in the future. 

Give us advice. Where to invest this money, how to budget, ect. We are looking at buying a home for $180,000 at most for our starter home. Do we continue to save and throw it all on the down payment? Or should our money be invested somewhere else?",0,1749515932.0,FinancialPlanning,0,0.5,False

Now for the good stuff. I play on xbox and PlayStation. I enjoy singleplayer games, but I do enjoy goofing off with friends in co-op games like helldivers. I'm always down to game, but I will not play fortnite or CoD. Still doing a new playthrough of Mass Effect. Tali all the way. Too poor for cyberpunk.

More good stuff. I love food and cooking. I'm what the kids call a fatass. I don't think I have a favorite thing to make, but as for eating I do enjoy a nice bacon cheeseburger. I do make a mean bowl of fruity pebbles. And I have a tendency to make waffles with ice coffee.

I love music. Rock and metal. When I wanna get wild, I whip out the Macarena or Barbie girl.

I wish I had the ability to focus on reading. I miss it, but I blame phones for making my ability to concentrate not exist. But I do have books I want to read.

I'm down for swapping selfies and moving onto other platforms if things are cool.

Bonus points if you like dancing queen. Medical problems - cause I do. Or have an accent. I'm American and I don't have one. Also, so far posting on here my luck is nill. Some questionable people.

I woke up one morning at about 10 o‚Äôclock to the screaming of my brother not something that‚Äôs unusual as he has extreme anger issues, ADHD and OCD. He often screams at my mum and verbally abuses her which I am not a fan of and have had to step in most of the time. So I walked into the house ( I live in a pool room just outside the house) asked my mum wtf was going on and why was he speaking to her like that, she said that she asked him if he had handed in his resume to the coffee shop down the road and they had gotten in a screaming match because he refuses to work in any sort of hospitality and only wants a ‚Äúreal job‚Äù. Both my mum and I have told him multiple times you just need a job for the time being and then you can get whatever job you desire. We keep harassing him to get a job because he needs to start pulling his own weight as he‚Äôs just gotten his first car and will finish school soon, he‚Äôs also constantly asking for money from my mum and spending it on who knows what. So after my mum told me what was going on I went up to his room and and saw his door was shut so I knocked and instantly got told to fuck off, I asked him to get up print out his resume and I‚Äôll take it he told me to fuck off again. At this point I‚Äôm even more pissed off as I‚Äôm just tryna help him. After the 5th fuck off I went on about how he‚Äôs acting like a blood sucking leach taking money from my mum while treating her like shit and how he‚Äôs had life on easy mode for the last few years. Looking back now I feel bad for saying those things as he has problems but I have problems too and ive been working since I was 16 doing a school based apprenticeship so I‚Äôd work 3 days a week, school 3 days a week and any holidays off school I would work for 12 weeks doing 38-45 hour weeks after school finished I worked there full time for 3 years, I‚Äôve left that job now and I am studying youth work so I‚Äôm working hospitality for the time being. While this argument was happening I said he‚Äôs never had a job and he replied yes I have ( he worked when he was 15 doing 1 day per week only 5 hours a day) I said that‚Äôs not a real job and he kept going on about how I‚Äôm a bum at 21 working at a pub and saying I‚Äôve got nothing in my life. This kept going on and on but one thing led to another and he opened his door got in my face so I pushed him back just a tad and he launched at my throat with his hands so I pushed him back and he went flying into the wall he tried to get up but i quickly laid on top of him putting him I a rear choke hold telling him to calm down and I don‚Äôt want to hurt him he kept telling me to get off him but I was worried he was gonna get up and try and knock me in the jaw. I really didn‚Äôt want to hurt him as he is my brother and I love him but I had to do this to protect myself. He finally said he won‚Äôt do anything so I let him get up but he wasn‚Äôt done just yet. My father walked in and was like WTF was going and idk how it happened but they also got into a complication and my brother was yelling I will kill you over and over again, my dad also has anger issues and said throw the first punch and my brother did so my dad clipped him in the rib. I don‚Äôt really remember what happened after this because I was in a bit of a state and it happened so quickly.

I‚Äôm so over living here and this altercation made me realise how fucked up my family is and it‚Äôs mostly because of my dad who was extremely firm on us as kids. I have so much hatred towards my family even my mother who I see as (part 2) ",1,1749515862.0,venting,0,1.0,False

***Wednesday***

Sebastian Jack, AKA Two-Three, AKA Bass, was stretched out across the single bed, staring at his phone. It was six in the morning, but he‚Äôd only been able to grab a couple of hours‚Äô sleep after Echo-One had spent all afternoon and half the night interrogating him and tearing his life apart. Meanwhile, Comms and her old man did the same electronically. No one was any closer to answers, and having been just as frustrated as he was, Echo-One had sent him to sack out around three.

His screen was lit up with an open text to Cobrati, and his thumb hovered over the keyboard as he played around with what to actually say. He was a good enough field operative to know better than to put anything incriminating in a text, but likewise, he didn‚Äôt want to come across as flippant or dismissive.

Finally, he went with the basics.

*Hey I know you said we‚Äôd catch up after everything was sorted but I was wondering if I could interest you in an early cup of coffee before today got too intense?*

He double-checked his spelling and had to add an apostrophe so that it wouldn‚Äôt look like a half-assed marriage proposal‚Äîbut once he was happy with it, he sent it off.

Then he added another that said, *If its not too early*

Not everyone was an early riser.

The seconds turned into minutes, and he‚Äôd almost drifted off when his phone vibrated with a silent reply. *Where and when?*

Bass sat up and swung his feet off the bed, staring at the screen. What was the best way to do this? It would take him two seconds to do an internet search for somewhere nearby, and in truth, he had already flipped to a different app to do that very search when he paused. His lips twitched on one side as he began typing once more.

*These are your old stomping grounds and you know where I am. Where would you suggest?*

The three dots at the bottom of the screen sprang up straight away.

*Verve Coffee Roasters. Laurel Ave. Opens at 7.*

*C u there.* Bass had no idea where that was, but he was already on the move, tossing the phone onto the bed and whipping his shirt off on his way to the bathroom for the fastest shower and shave in human history.

\* \* \*

The first ping of an incoming message in the living room had Peta lifting her eyes from the work she had scattered across her kitchen table to where her phone was charging. She dismissed it as quickly as it had caught her attention. Curiosity wasn‚Äôt a weakness she indulged in once she was in the zone, so whoever it was could wait. Her gaze shifted to the gorgeous view she had from her Houston apartment. Some people meditated to remain calm. She used the view.

Truthfully, she‚Äôd been up for a while and was contemplating her next steps in hunting down whoever had sent the cutie from Team Portsmith into her crosshairs. It pissed her off that someone had set him up and it was only because she‚Äôd appreciated his *assets* that she‚Äôd questioned his involvement in the first place.

Having cleared her thoughts, she returned her attention to the copious amounts of notes she‚Äôd made overnight. Nuncio controlled everything electronic, so she‚Äôd learned a long time ago that anything she didn‚Äôt want him to know had to be done with a pen and paper. It was pretty much how all of them conducted private business, and lucky for her, she had centuries of practice doing it this way.

The second ping had her looking at the ceiling for patience. There wasn‚Äôt a third ping, but as the silence grew along with her expectation of one, she let out an annoyed huff.

‚ÄúIf it *is* you, Nunce‚Äô, I‚Äôm going to rip out your internal organs and hang you by them,‚Äù she finally promised, sliding off the kitchen stool to head for the charging port she had on the coffee table beside the sofa. The problem with ignoring her family completely was that they were all two steps away from making the visit in person.

She knew better than most that her threat to Nuncio was a bluff at best. He was Hellion Highborn, and her bloodline was demonic. Range vs Self. He would fuck her up nine ways from Sunday before she even knew he was in the room‚Ä¶

Bass‚Äô name on her home screen surprised her, almost as much as the message.

*Hey I know you said we‚Äôd catch up after everything was sorted but I was wondering if I could interest you in an early cup of coffee before today got too intense?* And then the second one: *If its not too early.*

*Damn, you‚Äôre adorable,* she thought to herself with a grin as she answered, *Where and when?*

The three dots kept disappearing and reappearing, almost as if he were arguing with himself. Eventually, *These are your old stomping grounds and you know where I am. Where would you suggest?* came through.

Oh, deferential treatment. He wasn‚Äôt pretending to know everything about LA. Or maybe he was smart enough to realise she‚Äôd soon catch him out if he tried. Either way ‚Ä¶ *Verve Coffee Roasters. Laurel Ave. Opens at 7.*

Their coffee had been a daily staple of her existence back when she‚Äôd been on the force, and it was the first place she‚Äôd checked out after returning. Sadly, the owners who knew her had since moved on, but the coffee was still good, and the staff were still friendly. It wasn‚Äôt necessarily close to where Bass was staying, but if he hustled, he should get there with a few minutes to spare.

His immediate response of *C u there* had her chuckling to herself. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see, Mister Jack,‚Äù she said as she meandered into her bedroom to find something to wear.

Forty-five minutes later, changed and dressed, Peta stepped out of the shadow that sat between a power pole and the solid brick wall of the Shell gas station behind the Majestic Car Wash off Laurel Ave. This permanent shadow, over ten feet tall, no matter what time of day, was another reason she loved this coffee house. She hated having to invoke the veil every time she popped out somewhere, but it was a necessary evil to separate what her father‚Äôs descendants did for a living from the Nascerdios.

*Hmmm‚Ä¶* Now that she was technically no longer an assassin, maybe she should think about rejoining the Nascerdios ranks.

Then, picturing herself receiving the reverent treatment Daniel did from his fellow police officers, she snorted and shook her head. *Nope, nope, nope.* She enjoyed obscurity too much, preferring people to be real with her when she walked in the door.

With that decision made, she stepped out around the shorter wall that protected a handful of cars from Laurel Ave and crossed over to the Verve. Forty-five minutes still gave Bass five to get there on time, and she wanted to be waiting for him when he did‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶which was why she nearly leapt out of her skin when the driver‚Äôs side door of a near-new Lexus RX350 opened in the spot closest to the front door and the man himself stepped out with a cowboy hat in his left hand.

Bass‚Äô grin when he realised he‚Äôd taken her by surprise was huge. ‚ÄúNice to see I can knock you off-balance, too, Peta,‚Äù he said, placing his hat and pinching the brim forward in a fluid motion that both acknowledged her presence and secured it firmly into place.

Peta was definitely a fan‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶right up until he casually leaned back against the car door and crossed his feet at the ankle.

That cockiness was a move far too many of her family had pulled over the years and worse, Peta knew damn well he didn‚Äôt own that car, or anything remotely like it. The high-gloss black paint with a hint of fleck through it made the car one of the luxury packages that, despite technically being an SUV, was the type you never saw outside the city. It was at least fifty grand, and Bass wasn‚Äôt a local. That made it either a company car or maybe a loaner from one of Stoll‚Äôs boyfriends.

If he‚Äôd brought the car out with the hopes of impressing her, that would be ‚Ä¶ disappointing.

Nevertheless, with a matching smile of her own, she walked over to him and allowed him to take hold of her elbows, leaning in to kiss her cheek, which in turn showed that he was without his earpiece and wristband. ‚ÄúHow did you get here so quickly?‚Äù Her eyes roamed over the new car. ‚ÄúAnd where did this come from?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Echo One‚Äôs. He said neither he nor Max could be spared, and without them driving me, I needed its advanced GPS if I was to have any prayer of getting here by seven.‚Äù With a wry grin, he hooked his thumb into his belt and tilted his head, adding, ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm a little past the whole *‚Äòneeding Dad to drive me to a date‚Äô* thing, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù

Peta arched an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou told your boss about this?‚Äù She would dissect the rest of his statement later, though she was pleased to see they were on the page about where this *could* go.

Bass placed his other hand on his chest. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on the clock twenty-four-seven. The only way I could get away would be to ask for the time off or lie about my reasons.‚Äù He then hitched one shoulder in a half-hearted shrug. ‚ÄúI went with the lesser of two evils, and the boss loaned me his car.‚Äù

Peta could appreciate that, and his honesty was refreshing. ‚ÄúAnd yet you‚Äôre leaning on it. Out of curiosity, how much does Echo One love his brand-new car?‚Äù

That had him bouncing off the door as if he‚Äôd been electrocuted. ‚ÄúShit,‚Äù he swore, turning to see if there were any marks to indicate he‚Äôd been so disrespectful to the ride.

That move right there had made up for the annoying swagger. She chuckled and slid her arm around his elbow. ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù she said, ignoring his slight startle at her boldness, having already spotted the front doors of the coffee house being unlocked and didn‚Äôt want to waste a moment standing around outside. ‚ÄúCoffee and breakfast await.‚Äù

With no one else around, they walked unimpeded across the parking lot, but as his hand reached out for the large, vertical door handle of the swinging door, he still couldn‚Äôt help but look back at the car with a frown of worry.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù she said, patting his forearm. ‚ÄúIf he gets out a magnifying glass, tell him I leaned on the car before you could stop me.‚Äù

Professional stoicism washed over his features, locking them into a stony expression. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt dodge blame, little lady, and I‚Äôm not about to start with the prettiest woman I‚Äôve seen in a long while.‚Äù

‚ÄúOoooh, nice play, cowboy,‚Äù she said, referencing both the hat and his Texan upbringing.

1l7laqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1l7laqp/i_feel_used_feel_like_i_didnt_get_a_job_because/,I feel used & feel like I didn‚Äôt get a job because of my appearance,"So I recently went for a job as a barista in a local coffee shop. They‚Äôre renowned for hosting pop ups with other local brands & hosting wellness events, such as Pilates in the local park. I had previous experience and knew it would be a good fit for me. 
After I applied, the owner reached out to me on WhatsApp, telling me I was exactly what they were looking for, when I could start & asking if I could come in during the weekend to assist with an event they were hosting. I agreed and went to my first (& last) shift there. 

From the get go, I could tell I was a bit different from the other girls already working there. It was a hot sunny day, and I was the only mid to plus size girl there. The other girls were noticeably tiny. I didn‚Äôt think much of it in the beginning. I was shown around then got stuck in. The place ended up being super busy & the owner asked me to stay on past our agreed time, to which I agreed and she thanked me many times over the shift for helping them on one of their busiest days, reassuring me that I was doing a wonderful job with the little training I had. 

There was another girl who was also new to the job working alongside me. I noticed that the girls already working there were asking her about what she does outside of work, her background etc. They barely asked what my name was. I stayed upbeat, made pleasant small talk & reassured the girls when they seemed overwhelmed that they were doing so well. 

It came to the end of the shift & the owner thanked me again for staying late & told me I done really well. 
I was delighted, despite feeling oddly left out. After I left, she said she would be in touch with the rota. 
I waited for days, until I messaged her saying that I was heading on vacation soon & I‚Äôd like an idea of when I‚Äôd be working again once I‚Äôm back. After waiting days, she finally got back to me. I was ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù but she now had ‚Äúno space on the rota to give me shifts‚Äù. I couldn‚Äôt understand what changed. I tried not to dwell on it too much, but it felt cruel to tell me I‚Äôd have a full time job waiting for me, reassuring me on the day of the shift that my new rota would be with me shortly, and now magically, nothing. 

The owner gave me excuse after excuse. I feel used & like I didn‚Äôt get the job because she doesn‚Äôt like how I look. I don‚Äôt exactly have a ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù or ‚Äúalt‚Äù appearance that doesn‚Äôt align with the brand, but I feel like she just didn‚Äôt give me the job based off the fact that I‚Äôm mid to plus size, and no one else there is. Like she can‚Äôt have a fat girl serving fucking matcha. 

It sounds self absorbed, but it genuinely felt that way. I asked her a couple times during the shift if I was doing okay and if I could do anything better & she reassured me plenty of times that I was doing well, so I knew it was performance based. It feels like she found me unattractive, so I don‚Äôt have a place there. 

I was good enough till I got there.

I‚Äôm considering having a coffee trailer at the wedding that serves lattes and specialty drinks. It‚Äôs from a local roaster that most of our guests already love.

Coffee is actually a big part of my story with my husband.

My mom and best friend suggested I DIY a coffee bar with syrups, creamers, etc. I know the downside to this is having someone to have to manage it all day.

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôd love your thoughts. I‚Äôm trying to decide between two options from this coffee trailer:

Option 1: $350 Base Rate + $150 Travel Fee
‚òï Guests pay $3.50 per drink
‚úÖ Includes 2 hours of service
‚ûï $100 per additional hour

Option 2: $350 Travel/Setup Fee Only
‚òï Guests pay normal prices (about $4‚Äì$6 per drink)
‚úÖ Includes 2 hours
‚ûï $50 per additional hour

We‚Äôre on a tight budget (250‚Äì300 guests), so we can probably only afford the travel/setup cost. That means guests would have to pay for their own coffee.

So here are my honest questions for you all:
* Would you be annoyed if you had to pay for coffee at a wedding?
* Would it make the couple look cheap, even if it‚Äôs excellent coffee and totally optional?
* Would you even want coffee at 2:30pm on a Monday wedding (Labor Day)?

I genuinely want to offer something fun and meaningful‚Äîbut don‚Äôt want to offend anyone either. Thanks so much for your honest input!

Also: we‚Äôll be serving Italian ice (catered) and have other drink options at the wedding (horchata, lemonade, hibiscus tea, Mexican Coca Cola etc). ",0,1749515332.0,Weddingsunder10k,26,0.27,False

during our 3rd call, i brought up, ""idk how old you are"" and eventually he mentioned that he's 41 even tho he knows he looks younger than his age, he said. 

we started getting to know each other, we have a lot in common (photography, music, etc.) but we don't live in the same city, the same time zones (5 hours away from each other).

he said how he'd come to my city and was committed to trying a MTL bagel (where i'm from). 

then he never did. after a month, he stopped texting me first. sometime during that time, he mentioned, ""i have a lot going on etc but i still like talking to you"" given his demanding job as he said.

another month goes by, I decided to fly to him and meet him. we had a great time walking around his city together and getting coffee. flirty/lingering exchanges. but not as warm as he was when we started talking. 
I asked him on text the next day if he was seeing anyone and he said nope.

two days later, he sent me a long ass text saying how he didn't mean anything by pulling back from me, he has a lot going on with his job and his country (he's in the US). he said he appreciates my qualities like how thoughtful i am and how my qualities mean a lot to him. he said ""i hope we can talk more soon"".

so i replied, and he calls me the next day. he tells me more vulnerable things like his family stories and his health conditions. he even asked, ""will this make you run away""

a week goes by, i ask how he's doing and he responds. 

2 weeks go by, i ask how he's doing again and he responds but then after i respond to him - he never replied. 

he still likes my stories whenever i post selfies.

These are the places I've decided to take her. Are they worth the hype? Should I replace any of these?

Kritikos - There are no Greek restaurants where we live. This seems like it'll be a great treat for us after a 7 hour drive

MOD coffee - We just really love going out to a local coffee spot

Sugar and Rye - Gotta get a trendy brunch in. Menu and drinks look fun

Katie's - We have an outdoor reservation. I feel like if I'm going to have a seafood dinner, I might as well get the freshest on the island 

Sunflower - Picked this out for an early morning coffee and bite

Miller's - Shrimp & Grits is also something I can't eat in our town. This seems to be the place to go for that and there are a lot of options for the gf

Grotto - Our other reservation. This would be our ""nice"" dinner. I know there are probably fancier spots, but we really love Italian and my girl's favorite dish is pasta alla vodka. This seems to be the place to go for that

Shykatz - This is probably the most replaceable option. This would be our meal after checking out. We just need something dog-friendly

We have a coffee machine with free coffee for employees, and my predecessor had been ordering fancy, expensive, artisanal beans for it. 

When I took over a couple months ago, I saw how much we were paying for beans and thought it was a massive waste, so I switched our order over to Costco, and with the money I saved was able to hire someone to come in and run an open weekly yoga flow session every Friday lunchtime!

I was very proud of this first decision, as I felt I had got a lot more value out of the fund for the whole team with one little change.

However, yesterday someone was looking around the area where the beans are stored, and caused a huge fuss around the office when they saw the bags saying 'Kirkland' on them. Since then, three! different people have come up to me and and berated me for ""not caring about the broader office culture"" and taking away their fancy coffee.

I'll admit, I don't really drink coffee, and I do love yoga. But the thing is, the old stock of artisanal beans ran out over a month ago, yet noone noticed until they accidentally saw the branding on the bags yesterday (beans get transfered to a clear plastic container for kitchen use). I feel like this proves I made the right choice, as the bean swap clearly wasn't all that noticeable, and 10-15 people are showing up for yoga each week.

1l7l0yz,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/1l7l0yz/need_help_narrowing_it_downfirst_bike/,Need Help Narrowing It Down‚Ä¶First Bike.,"I will be getting my first motorcycle in mid August and I‚Äôm currently in the process of narrowing it down. My choices are somewhat all over the place but I can shed some light on that. For as long as I can remember I‚Äôve always wanted an Indian or a Triumph motorcycle. Something has drawn me to these two brands which is why you‚Äôll see them dominate the majority of my list. For some context on the type of riding I‚Äôll be doing. I live in Chattanooga (recently relocated) and I‚Äôll be sticking to mostly backroads and will not be commuting to work. My riding will consist of getting out in the evenings for a cruise out to the mountains or the lake and some scenic areas around here. I do not plan to ride highways much other than the occasional hope on 27 to get to downtown which has a speed limit of 65. Of course once downtown I‚Äôll be doing some city riding but I don‚Äôt see that being too often. I‚Äôm around 5‚Äô8 / 5‚Äô9‚Äù and 180 pounds. I‚Äôve been wanting to get a bike for a long time but I promised my wife who never asks anything of me that I‚Äôd wait until our children are older before I get one. Our two boys are now 15 and 18. So there‚Äôs some backstory but happy to share more if needed. My bike choices are below along with some reasons I‚Äôve listed them. I still have plenty of time to get out to some dealerships to check them out in person and to sit on them. Please keep in mind I‚Äôve never owned a motorcycle so this will truly be my first bike. I‚Äôve rode a few vintage Vespas years ago with a buddy of mine in Atlanta who was an enthusiast and mechanic but never a motorcycle. The list is as follows in order of my preference. 

1) Indian Scout Bobber Sixty
2) Triumph Scrambler 400x
3) Honda Rebel 500
4) Triumph Speed 400

Adding a 5th one on for good measure.
5) Royal Enfield Intercepter 650

I want something that is low maintenance and that won‚Äôt need to be worked on a lot or have to visit the mechanic a ton. I know the Indian is a lot of bike for a beginner but I also recognize that it‚Äôs a low seat height and something that I can grow into. I know where I am at in life, I‚Äôm 39 years old, not looking to get out fast or get myself in trouble by any means. I‚Äôm looking for something that I can simply enjoy riding in the evening, checking out the sites, maybe a coffee run in the morning, or a few hour cruise on the weekends on some back roads. Would love to hear some opinions from some of you who are well versed in this area and have some insight that would help me further narrow this list down. I‚Äôve done a lot of reading and watching videos and I hear a lot of folks say buy a bike and sell it as you grow out of it but I‚Äôm looking to keep this for several years if not longer before I upgrade. I also saw today the Honda Shadow Phantom but didn‚Äôt add it to my list yet because I haven‚Äôt researched it enough. 

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts or any other recommendations you may have. ",1,1749514913.0,motorcycles,0,1.0,False

I'm pretty rambly and overthink so here we go

**Summary:** I have been on this program for \~3 years (fasting for 3-4, lifting for 2) but I am lost at my current stage, and wanting to assess if I can / how to get rid of the last 10-15lbs of fat and gain or at least keep my dense muscle (for now, maybe just keep until I drop the fat). Shooting for around Sept this year

30F, 5'4, SW `185-190lb` CW `145lb` GW \~`130lb` and currently 27.5% BF (per Renpho)

Edit: I am willing to post body comp pictures if someone needs to assess my current state better

**Key points:**

* IF
   * IF pretty regularly since late 2021, started slow and went hard for a while up to 20:4, slowed down and was more flexible after losing a lot of weight. Eventually plateaued and I kicked it back up to stricter 20:4 the last 1-1.5 yrs.  I have fully adapted to 18-24h fasts and have no issues with energy or hunger
   * I lift fasted, almost every single time, and then break my fast at 4PM right after my workout with greek yogurt, banana, and a little protein
   * I drink black coffee with creatine almost every morning (I know technically not a true clean fast)
   * Right now I'm basically doing OHMAD (1 1/2 meals a day) where I break my fast at 4pm with a ""half lunch"" (banana, yogurt, mini meal prep/whey) and then have dinner + dessert
* Calories / Ingestion
   * Since a few weeks, I am doing even stricter 20:4 and started calorie counting a few weeks ago using MacroFactor, as accurately as I can (not AI pic, using scanner and measurements kind of)
   * Daily macro goals: 1327 cal, 133p, 34f, 119c. Saturday up slightly to 1526 cal
   * I have been meal prepping for a few years, following a lot of recipes from and like [Stealth Health](https://stealthhealthcookbook.com/)
   * Since a few weeks, I have started pre-workout ([this](https://rvsci.com/collections/all/products/violence-pre-workout-powder-energy-power-focus-pump-gains-180-mg-caffeine) and [this](https://getrawnutrition.com/products/essential-pre?variant=51657771483454)) 30m before every workout. No issues and feel amazing
   * Maybe on average every other day, I take a scoop of iso whey right after the gym
   * I have gotten better on dessert but I like and want to be able to have it every or most days. I've been working on better options, like greek yogurt, protein powder, honey, freeze
   * I take vitamin B12 and D. Once in a while (maybe a Sat) I might have an Alani, but not if I have pre-workout
* Activity / Weights
   * Sedimentary desk job sit/stand desk, walk \~20 mins mid day and 90m break on my feet (gym + shower) around 3pm. Some days I get home and we walk, sometimes not because I get home and I'm too tired to do any activity with the free time I have. Steps are poor, minimum 3k some days up to 8k if we go to the beach or somewhere. We live a very boring life, no kids and such
   * For 2 years straight I've been doing efficient isolation exercise weight lifting for just under 60m M-F and sometimes Sat or Sun
   * Split: **Mon** `chest + (light) tris`, **Tues** `back + (L) bis + legs`, **Wed** `core + calisthenics`, **Thurs** `(H) legs + (H) bis`, **Fri** `shoulders + (H) tris`
   * I lift as heavy as I can (for dense muscle, not fluffy); examples: 15lb weighted chest dip, 22.5lb seated cable chest fly, bicep 21s, z/seated OHP, bench, squat, powerbombs, etc. Strong effective isolation for each muscle group

**Situation:**

I am at the point where I'm not sure what to do. I think I'm trying to do too many things at once for my comfort level and since I want to do this based on a lifestyle change, I want it to be sustainable. I know I probably have to sacrifice something and to not be picky

I like fruit and eat bananas frequently, then grapes and strawberries (and others). I love scrambled eggs, and meats but finding the energy to cook fresh every day is draining (why we like meal preps). I try to get low on fats but that creeps up fast and I try not to worry about carbs

I basically do OMAD on weekends because we love eating one comfortable meal at 3 and then be done for the day. I tried OMAD on weekdays but it's too much food at once for me, so I'm doing OHMAD (explained earlier). I try to be mindful of the weekend and not lose my week's progress

I know it's as simple as eat less, but without going crazy and putting a ton of time and effort into cooking and measuring, I am struggling with: staying at/under 1300 cals, meeting protein goals (133g or at least 100), keeping fat down (<34g0 and not going overboard on carbs (<119g), while being mindful of salt and sugar and being able to enjoy dessert. It's a lot, but I know weight loss isn't easy or everyone could do it. I've lost a huge chunk and I'm way healthier, but I'm really struggling for this last end

**Additional questions:**

1. Am I doing too many things at once? Should I not worry too much about macros and stay under 1300 calories to get the 10-15lb of fat gone? Will my muscle or progress suffer? (Hopefully shouldn't, which is the reason I went for dense muscle)
2. For 30F 5'4, Is 130lb a realistic and healthy goal weight while keeping or increasing muscle (nothing crazy like a body builder)? (I know muscle weighs more) or is that extremely difficult?
3. Should my macros be re-adjusted? Is my weekly split (1327, 1526 on Sat) too little? I have tried so many different calculators and averaging them + what macrofactor gave me, this is what I went with
4. Are there other factors that affect my weight/fat loss even in a deficit? I've heard there can be some but I don't fully understand, something about kickstarting my metabolism? I was probably eating around 1800-2k to maintain for 1-1.5 years (makes sense) before deciding to calorie count to figure out why I wasn't losing (eating too much obviously)
5. Do I simply have no choice but to be crazy about macros & put in a lot of work in order to lose this 10-15lb while maintaining/gaining muscle? I am fully willing to accept that, I really just don't know
6. Is there anything else you recommend I do or advice I should know?

Let me know if I left anything out, I tried to list everything important. Thank you for reading this huge wall and I appreciate any of your advice :) I'm honestly not sure how many responses if any I'll get for this, but if I get some I promise I'll get to them when I can",1,1749514877.0,leangains,0,1.0,False

1l7kyqk,https://i.redd.it/svqsfj9jtz5f1.jpeg,Looking for a new boutique frame/project that will be regularly ridden.,"Hi all, 

Looking to build a new project that will serve as my primary road bike, open to both rim and disc brakes. 

Recently ridden a friend‚Äôs ‚Äò22 Bianchi Optimo and it was pretty cool how different a ‚Äòmodern‚Äô feel is, and it has sort of pushed me over the edge to build something new. I‚Äôm not too interested in special edition S-Works/Cannondales, as it seems like there is really only 1 way to build them - flashy frame with carbon everything and maybe a pair of gumwalls. Visually and in terms of standing out in a crowd, it seems like whoever has the biggest wallet wins. 

That said, I‚Äôm into novel construction methods/materials. Frames I‚Äôve eyed are the rare BMC and SLT01 for a long time, Serotta Ottrotts, Affinity Anthem/Columbus XCR stainless frames, Santa Cruz Stigmata, the new Cinelli Nemo Tig Disc, and love the Battaglin Portofino - all very different. I‚Äôve eyed Standert‚Äôs new Kriessages but I cannot justify spending 2k euros on an alloy frame with fancy paint, and I am much more of a gran fondo rider nowawdays than playing who‚Äôs the fastest on the coffee ride with the stiffest frame. 

Pictured above is my late 80‚Äôs supercorsa with 1st gen eTap and custom bits, weighing sub 18lbs. I‚Äôd willing to put around the $2000 range for a frame if staying with rim brakes, (like an impec) as I could transfer over all my current components. 

However, I am also open to doing a full new disc brake build, say around the 4k range. I‚Äôve not had a carbon, titanium, or magnesium frame and would be open to those. Bigger clearance ~30c is definitely a plus, staying around sub 18 weight.

1l7kwz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1l7kwz9/husband_and_i_separating/,Husband and I separating,"My husband i were together for over a year before getting married.   It‚Äôs been six months since the wedding. We‚Äôre both South Asian, living in Canada. On the surface, we looked compatible, like two intellectual, emotionally intense people. But the truth is, I‚Äôve been unraveling from the inside out trying to make this work.

He lied about watching p0rn for two months of our relationship and gaslit me hard about it, even going so far to say he wasn‚Äôt watching it and instead drinking more coffee at work (he‚Äôd watch it in the single stall bathroom at his office). I found out he had been hiding it, and when I confronted him, he admitted he used to fantasize about women who had rejected him even while having seggs with me. That shattered me. I felt like a placeholder, a body for him to use while his mind wandered elsewhere. I gave him my body, my loyalty, my care and it still wasn‚Äôt enough.

Eventually he stopped, but only after enough emotional damage had been done to hollow me out. I kept forgiving. I kept trying to believe we could heal. He recently admitted he was only honest cause he wanted to break up with me. 

Before we got married, his mother told him he should abandon me in Canada and come back to India. She said he should marry someone younger because I‚Äôm his age and ‚Äúlook older than him.‚Äù He told me this as if it were a joke. He never stood up for me. He said marrying me was proof that he was standing up for me because if if he really cared about his mom‚Äôs opinion he would‚Äôve never married me. 

He also has weaponized our class differences (I grew up wealthier than him) so many times and used it against me. Calling me elitist and privileged even though I‚Äôve been working class for all of my 20s. 

She later fat-shamed me the day after our wedding and told me my anxiety wasn‚Äôt real, that I just needed to pray it away. Again, he defended her. Again, I was told to be the bigger person.

When his father died, I tried to be there for him. But instead of grieving with me, he demanded that his mother move into our one-bedroom apartment. I said no I was struggling too, and needed space. He told me to ‚Äúget the fuck out of his house‚Äù if I didn‚Äôt agree to contribute more financially so we could get a two-bedroom for her. At the time, only his name was on the lease. I‚Äôve since added myself. And now, he‚Äôs the one leaving.

He made fun of my work. Mocked my Instagram. Dismissed my anxiety. If I cried, I was manipulative. If I asked for reassurance, I was clingy. If I pulled away, I was abandoning him. Every boundary I tried to set was twisted into proof that I was difficult, unstable, or too much.

I started getting physically sick from the stress. Gut issues, panic attacks, insomnia. I stopped sleeping. I stopped feeling safe in my own body. I was constantly walking on eggshells around someone who claimed to love me.

We‚Äôve now agreed to a trial separation. He‚Äôs moving out this week. We said we‚Äôd ‚Äúsee how it goes,‚Äù but I already know.

I don‚Äôt hate him. But I hate what I became in this marriage. I feel grief. I feel relief. I feel like I‚Äôm finally telling the truth!

I have a beautiful little 7 week old boy. He is by all  health measures 'thriving' (bar some breast milk jaundice which is almost normal again)- He has been gaining alot of weight since birth and midwife wad thrilled. But because of this it seems like they brush off all other concerns.

At about 3 weeks old I noticed he would squeak when taking a sharp inhale after feeding and periodically when sleeping. I mentioned this to midwife and she said potentially just mild laryngomalacia (floppy voice box he will grow out of) and not to worry. 

Since then its progressively got worse, from about week 5- about an 30 mins to an hour after being put down to sleep he starts having these 'episodes' where he thrashes his head around for 2-3 seconds likes he's looking for air (when I put my hand on his chest he is not breathing in when he doing this). After a few seconds  he squeaks (starts taking in air) a few times and his body relaxes and he starts breathing nromally again. Again I mentioned this to the midwife and our doctor and they both said it's laryngomalacia and not to do worry- he's not distressed and he will grow out of it. To note he also has periods of bad wheezing, wet sounding breathing after feeding, frequent hiccups (like 5 xs a day), ongoing nasal congestion and randomly starts coughing on seemingly nothing.

The last week I have noticed he has been having what looks like silent reflux, he often makes a gagging sound and then swallows alot and drools heaps with bubbles. But he very rarely ever spits up. He seemed un disturbed when this happens so I thought maybe just excess saliva as every talks about reflux babies screaming alot.

Again mentioned this and his periodic squeaking and pauses in breathing to Dr during his immunisations and she said probably reflux and to tilt his bed at night but not to worry.

Now last night was hideous, it all combined together into a terrifying Orchestra. He had frequent gagging and choking sounds (and this time I could smell the sour reflux on his breath), then the head thrashing and struggling to breath and squeaking- I also noticed his nostrils flaring, but only for a few seconds at a time. He never changes colour thank god. This time it seems more distressing to him he was actually starting to scream afterwards. During one bad episode I ran to my partner in the other room who was alarmed at his state and immediately wanted to call plunket (first for him as he has previously thought I was probably being a bit of an anxious 1st time mum). And finally agreed this doesn't seem normal (he has two other kids). 

I'm at a loss as to what to do, I keep bringing it up to the appropriate health professionals and keep getting fobbed off. I just wanted to know his 02 levels are not dropping during these episodes and that he's not suffering, but I can't seem to get more than 'he's a new born he will grow out of it'. Are they right?

I really hope this is the case, and want to relax into it- but watching your child thrash around trying to breathe each night is absolutely horrifying- I'm at my wits end.

I have videos these episodes and have showen them to the health professionals. Its very hard to capture what it's like in when your there and they all just listen to it and seem unfazed. I wish I had been able to catch last night on video but it was just me with him and I was too foccussed of getting him upright and breathing normally. 

Ps. We have tried getting his his tongue tie cut, upright feeding, tilting the bed, burping, holding him upright for 30 minutes after each feed- all with not much change. I also am dairy free and each hardly any gluten. I don't drink coffee or alcahol.

Thanks for reading a very long post!

1l7kwmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1l7kwmb/husband_and_i_separating/,Husband and I separating,"My husband i were together for over a year before getting married.   It‚Äôs been six months since the wedding. We‚Äôre both South Asian, living in Canada. On the surface, we looked compatible, like two intellectual, emotionally intense people. But the truth is, I‚Äôve been unraveling from the inside out trying to make this work.

He lied about watching p0rn for two months of our relationship and gaslit me hard about it, even going so far to say he wasn‚Äôt watching it and instead drinking more coffee at work (he‚Äôd watch it in the single stall bathroom at his office). I found out he had been hiding it, and when I confronted him, he admitted he used to fantasize about women who had rejected him even while having seggs with me. That shattered me. I felt like a placeholder, a body for him to use while his mind wandered elsewhere. I gave him my body, my loyalty, my care and it still wasn‚Äôt enough.

Eventually he stopped, but only after enough emotional damage had been done to hollow me out. I kept forgiving. I kept trying to believe we could heal. He recently admitted he was only honest cause he wanted to break up with me. 

Before we got married, his mother told him he should abandon me in Canada and come back to Pakistan. She said he should marry someone younger because I‚Äôm his age and ‚Äúlook older than him.‚Äù He told me this as if it were a joke. He never stood up for me.

She later fat-shamed me the day after our wedding and told me my anxiety wasn‚Äôt real, that I just needed to pray it away. Again, he defended her. Again, I was told to be the bigger person.

When his father died, I tried to be there for him. But instead of grieving with me, he demanded that his mother move into our one-bedroom apartment. I said no I was struggling too, and needed space. He told me to ‚Äúget the fuck out of his house‚Äù if I didn‚Äôt agree to contribute more financially so we could get a two-bedroom for her. At the time, only his name was on the lease. I‚Äôve since added myself. And now, he‚Äôs the one leaving.

He made fun of my work. Mocked my Instagram. Dismissed my anxiety. If I cried, I was manipulative. If I asked for reassurance, I was clingy. If I pulled away, I was abandoning him. Every boundary I tried to set was twisted into proof that I was difficult, unstable, or too much.

I started getting physically sick from the stress. Gut issues, panic attacks, insomnia. I stopped sleeping. I stopped feeling safe in my own body. I was constantly walking on eggshells around someone who claimed to love me.

We‚Äôve now agreed to a trial separation. He‚Äôs moving out this week. We said we‚Äôd ‚Äúsee how it goes,‚Äù but I already know.

I don‚Äôt hate him. But I hate what I became in this marriage. I feel grief. I feel relief. I feel like I‚Äôm finally telling the truth!

* acclimated to a slightly more sunny position than it had at the nursery 
   * outdoor on south-facing balcony with full sun \~10h (sunrise+1h until \~5pm these days)
   * \[location: coastal southern California, hardiness Zone 10B\]
* watered deeply about every 5-7 days (except a panic-watering the second time)
   * checked moisture levels daily and found it often dry in the upper few inches after \~3 days but moist to wet in root ball for \~2-3 more days
* repotted to slightly larger pot to check root conditions and give it some new soil to feed on
   * the plant did not seem particularly root-bound
   * i did not loosen or cut roots
   * observed some fine roots exposed around the crown, maybe from erosion during watering - are these roots dead or should I try to re-bury them to restore them? have been trying to keep covered with soil and mulch, but i don't want to choke the living roots below that or stave them of air
   * i overfilled the pot bed and the crown is a bit higher than the rim, may re-pot to remove some of that soil and increase the mulch cover if doing so won't shock the plant too much
* DID NOT YET FEED IT, worried about burn or shock amidst location and pot changes
   * considered iron chelate foliar application but haven't done it because I read that's not safe for fruit consumption
   * have E.B. Stone - Citrus & Fruit Tree Food fertilizer (7-3-3) ready to apply if recommended, but curious of how long it will take and if i should use anything else first or instead
   * how old is this tree? 2-3 years? I've read that can factor in to how aggressively to feed it
* measured pH at \~7.5, and I see it should be \~5.5-6.5
   * could this explain the color?
   * how can i safely reduce pH - add 60 grams of espresso pucks (used, finely-ground coffee beans) spread above the mulch? 

What do you think is causing the yellowing?  
What do you suggest I do to fix that or otherwise improve my care routine?

Recently, at one of those events, she mentioned that she really wanted to rekindle our friendship and said something like, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make plans soon!‚Äù I thought she was sincere, so I followed up the next week and suggested we grab coffee nearby ‚Äî something casual and easy.

She replied that she was too busy with projects at home. No offer to reschedule, no alternate date or time ‚Äî just that. So I didn‚Äôt push again.

Here‚Äôs the added context:
Her husband (who is her high school sweetheart) is extremely controlling. It‚Äôs always been that way, but it‚Äôs gotten worse with time.

1l7kus8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l7kus8,Monday detailed review & pictures,"It's been a while since I've been to crumbl. It's about an hour drive away, and for the last month or so it just didn't feel quite worth it. This lineup looked solid though, so here we are! 

Raspberry lemonade cookie: This cookie wasn't bad, but I was expecting more of a sour flavor profile because a good raspberry lemonade (to me) is a perfect mix of sweet and sour. The base cookie was lemon, but the flavor was pretty weak. It could have passed as a basic sugar cookie. The raspberry part of the frosting swirl was a bit tart, which was my favorite part of the whole cookie. I could taste real raspberry in there. The lemon part of the frosting swirl was just ok. It had a hint of lemon, but again pretty weak. Not bad but I don't think I would get it again. 

French toast cookie: This cookie really tasted (and looked) like a deliciously thick slice of french toast. The edges were slightly crispy, and the middle was soft like a pancake. I removed about one third of the buttercrean dollop, and spread the rest thinly over the whole cookie. The buttercream tastes slightly salted, which is a nice contrast to the sweet cookie and syrup. All the elements together tasted like a sweet, cinnamon-y, maple-y, french toast love story. 

PB cup brownie ft. Reese's: So far, I've never met a crumbl brownie that I didn't enjoy. They're big, crispy on the outside, and rich and gooey in the middle. They always have a bold cocoa taste and melty chocolate chips. All of that was true in this brownie too, but unfortunately you can't really taste it... the only thing I could taste was the thick layer of peanut butter mousse. If you're a peanut butter lover, that's not necessarily a bad thing! The drizzle of chocolate was mostly just for show I believe because I could barely taste it, and the pieces of Reese's cups added some texture and more peanut butter flavor. To me, this brownie really just tasted like a peanut butter bomb. Do with that what you will. 

Dirt cake cookie: I always enjoy this cookie whenever it's on the menu. The base has a notable cocoa flavor, and the cookies and cream crumbs add crunch in every bite. It also gives the illusion of dirt, which is fun. The fudge frosting is thick and well balanced, like a rich chocolate pudding. There's more crunchy crumbs on top, and it's finished with a cute little gummy worm. Hard to go wrong with this one if you like chocolate. 

Churro cake: If you like cinnamon coffee cake, the churro cake would be right up your alley. It's definitely not my favorite crumbl cake, but it is good. The layers of cinnamon cake are soft and baked perfectly. The cinnamon buttercream is packed with a strong cinnamon flavor, and the streusel packed into the middle adds a contrasting crunch. It is very very sweet and the flavor is completely one-note, but there's nothing technically wrong with it. 

S'mores cookie: The thing that impressed me the most about this cookie is the strong taste of graham cracker. Many s'mores desserts are just focused on marshmallow and chocolate, and the importance of graham flavor is overlooked. The base is a graham cracker cookie, soft in the middle with lightly crisped edges. There's a slightly salty element going on, which compliments the flavor really nicely. The marshmallow in the middle is thick and stretchy, and there's chocolate chips and a light chocolate drizzle. There's also more graham cracker crumbs on top, tying it all together. I really like this cookie when it's warm, but in the past I've noticed after being in the fridge it tastes a bit weird. ",33,1749514412.0,CrumblCookies,6,0.98,False

I wonder why I‚Äôm still chained to this greasy purgatory, this diner that‚Äôs been my accidental home since I was sixteen. Truth is, I didn‚Äôt choose this life; it wrapped around me like a too-tight collar when I was just learning to breathe. The diner is both a prison and a comfort zone‚Äîa place so vacuumed of hope that even its bleak monotony feels familiar, almost reassuring. Every shift is a reminder of the meager paycheck, the relentless demands, and the predictable chaos that I both resent and rely on.  

I don‚Äôt exactly love it‚Äîhell, I despise the endless parade of spilled coffee and snide orders. But fleeing isn‚Äôt as simple as closing the door behind me. The thought of stepping into a world where every risk might blow up in my face terrifies me more than this miserable, inescapable routine. I‚Äôm the misguided architect of my own captivity: my bank account‚Äôs as skinny as the hope that my boss ever hands out a decent raise, and my resume is a collage of ‚Äúthis diner experience‚Äù that, despite its stench, proves I can survive. Besides, the diner‚Äôs eternal absurdity has woven itself into my soul. Every disgruntled customer, every whispered secret over a table, adds another little layer to who I am‚Äîa beautifully bitter, irreverent mess who‚Äôs learned to find dark humor in the daily grind.

Oh, and don‚Äôt get me wrong‚ÄîI do dream of a better life. I fantasize about a sun-washed mountain escape with a roaring waterfall where skinny-dipping at dawn is the most natural part of my routine. I imagine trading this fluorescent gloom for the warm embrace of nature, where every day begins with a sense of liberation instead of resignation. But the truth is, dreams are as slippery as the rain on these diner windows‚Äîtempting glimpses of freedom that always seem to vanish when I reach for them. For now, I trade my dreams for dollars, clinging to the hope that maybe one day I'll muster the strength to walk away, even if I'm terrified of leaving the only life I've ever known.",1,1749514228.0,u_Valuable-Possible824,0,1.0,False

- Took me too long to realise you could move the shipping bin and build an additional one! I always have one near my animals to dump all their products in

- 3x coffee kegs in a high access area so you have triple espresso chain constantly running as you refill the beans every time you walk past

- Marking kegs/crystalarium/tappers near the farmhouse so you can always see when your gems/wine/syrup are ready. Strawberry potplant is good for fairy rose honey farm on ginger island too!

- Another must is mini obelisk set by front door and the other in the south entrance of your farm with obelisks situated besides it. So you can access every area of the game instantly with a bonus shortcut to Cindersap forest. Once you have the return sceptre and horse flute, you rarely have to waste travel time!!

- Use the cheap cabin as a space for extra storage

- Fast turnover machines like fish smokers and furnaces go inside the house for easy maintenance

It's been so freeing now being broken up and having complete freedom over my own life. I can decide what I want to eat without someone complaining that ""I'll die from seed oils if I eat a Chipotle burrito."" Or saying that ""I should never enjoy my cooking because I can never cook anything right."" I can go out and study at coffee shops or go for full day hikes whenever I want. I can work out for as many hours as I want without someone getting pissed at me because they don't want me to look strong. I've started running in the mornings and I've been enjoying the hell out of it. I can make mistakes and learn without someone constantly calling me stupid. I can wear the clothes I want and try out new ones without a man telling me that everything looks bad on me or that I need to wear what he wants. I never have to clean up his messes again. I can sit down with a book and a glass of wine without him insulting the book or sneering that I will die because I'm drinking alcohol. I can use the computer that I built with my own hands that he tried to take away from me. I can decorate my room with the watercolor painting decor I took down because he didn't like any of it. I can work on my projects without someone telling me that they will go nowhere. I can enjoy the silence, the birds in woods and the river gently passing by, without someone insulting me for being quiet. I can value having empathy without someone calling me stupid for it. I don't ever again need to hate myself because I'm not a virgin. I don't need to ever have another man touch me when I say no. I don't ever need to force myself to act in the childish way he wanted me to. I don't ever need to constantly apologize for everything he saw as wrong with me. I don't ever need to feel like I'm always tight on my budget because I payed for everything and he consumed everything.

  
I can live my life however I want. I've since relearned how to love myself. The man I dated stole that away from me for too long. He broke me into someone who was constantly on edge breaking into tears afraid of every word that came out of his lips. I became isolated and lost all my friends, a shell of my former self. I stuck on to the relationship for too long because he forced his way into living in my own house and my family kept saying that he was the best man I could be with. Eventually I believed his own words of calling me ""stupid, immature, no one will love me, how could I make it this far in life, that I know no basic skills, that I didn't appreciate anything in life, that I wanted to be depressed, that I would be no one with nothing, that I was a used up woman, that I had nothing good to say."" And I would just keep apologizing to him because arguing back that I did love myself would make it so much worse. It was four years since I had last self harmed, but I had begun self harming at the end of this relationship and he would just laugh when he saw it. I was truly in so much pain and because I saw no way out of it, no way to get him out of my house before my planned move out date I held on. But one day I truly had enough and I started talking back. I broke up with him and told him that he needed to move out of there. It was difficult and he constantly tried to have control over me touching me when I said no or constantly bringing friends over to talk about how terrible I was while I was there. I left the house as much as I could leaving early in the morning and walking an hour back to the house during the night. I had to learn how to have a backbone and eventually I guess he realized he didn't have control over me so he moved out.

  
But now that I'm away from my last apartment and broken up I feel so free. I can be whoever I want, pick up all the hobbies I missed, and try new ones. I'm so glad I can love myself again. There's a few open meetups in my area the next few days I'm going to. I'm looking forward to finding friends again if I can. It just feels so good being able to live my life without fear. But one of the best things is that I never have to be in a romantic relationship again. I thought this man wouldn't be abusive, that he was someone that was too good to be true. But he only showed who he was half a year into the relationship. I'm sure there's plenty of great men out there but after this I'm just done with romantic relationships entirely. I'm so much happier by myself without someone dragging me down. And that brings so much relief to me that this will never happen to me again. I can be who I am and love myself for the rest of my life.",3,1749513835.0,emotionalabuse,0,1.0,False

1l7klxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SiliconValleyBayArea/comments/1l7klxl/north_oakland_coffee_house_sued_by_us_justice/,"North Oakland coffee house sued by U.S. Justice Department, amid discrimination claims","The recent lawsuit against Jerusalem Coffee Shop, stemming from discrimination claims brought forth by the U.S. Justice Department, serves as a poignant reminder of the complex interplay between local businesses, community relations, and broader economic implications in the Bay Area. As the region continues to evolve, incidents like these not only reflect the challenges of maintaining an inclusive environment but also underscore the potential repercussions for businesses and real estate in the local market.

From a business perspective, this lawsuit could have significant ramifications, particularly for small and mid-sized enterprises in the Bay Area, which is known for its entrepreneurial spirit and diverse demographic. Discrimination claims can tarnish a business's reputation, leading to decreased customer patronage and, subsequently, financial strain. In an increasingly competitive market, where consumers are more inclined to support businesses that align with their values, the fallout from such allegations can be dire. For owners of establishments in the Bay Area's vibrant food and beverage sector, this case serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of fostering an inclusive environment, both for ethical reasons and to safeguard their financial viability.

Moreover, the implications for economic development in the region are significant. The Bay Area is characterized by its diverse, multicultural population, which has historically been a cornerstone of its economic success. When businesses fail to reflect the community's diversity or engage in discriminatory practices, they risk alienating a large segment of their customer base. This can lead to a decline in local economic activity and hinder the potential for growth in neighborhoods that thrive on their entrepreneurial diversity. Investors may become wary of backing businesses that could be susceptible to legal challenges, prompting a reevaluation of risk in the local market.

In terms of real estate, the effects of such legal issues can extend beyond the immediate business environment. Neighborhoods with a reputation for inclusivity and community engagement tend to attract higher property values and stronger investment interest. Conversely, areas that face public scrutiny due to incidents like the Jerusalem Coffee Shop lawsuit may see hesitancy from potential investors and homebuyers. This can result in a stagnation of property values, impacting not just commercial real estate but also residential markets that rely on the vibrancy of local businesses to sustain their appeal.

Furthermore, this incident could spark a broader conversation about the role of businesses within their communities, prompting local governments and organizations to take a more proactive stance on promoting equality and inclusivity. As the Bay Area grapples with its identity amidst rapid change, businesses may need to adapt by implementing more robust diversity and inclusion initiatives, not just as a response to legal challenges but as a strategic approach to foster community relationships and enhance their market position.

Ultimately, the lawsuit against Jerusalem Coffee Shop illustrates a critical intersection between social responsibility, economic sustainability, and the dynamics of local real estate. For residents and investors alike, it emphasizes the importance of supporting businesses that contribute positively to the community. As the Bay Area continues to navigate its evolving landscape, fostering inclusivity and ensuring equitable business practices will be vital for maintaining the region's economic vitality and attractiveness as a place to live and invest. In this context, stakeholders must recognize that the health of local businesses and the vibrancy of the community are inextricably linked, making it imperative to champion fair practices that reflect the diverse fabric of the Bay Area.

1l7kkre,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkinitalian/comments/1l7kkre/how_to_say_its_enough_in_italian/,"How to say ""it's enough"" in Italian","**Discovering ""Basta"" in Italian: A Teacher's Tale**

Once, during an Italian lesson, a student exclaimed, ‚Äú*Basta!*‚Äù after struggling with verb conjugations. The class burst into laughter, and I realized how this little word is a lifesaver in Italian. 

**Why ""basta"" is your new best friend**

In Italian, *basta* means ""it's enough"" or ""stop."" This word is like a Swiss army knife‚Äîhandy in many situations. Whether you're politely declining more pasta or expressing frustration, *basta* has your back.

**Real-life scenarios**

Imagine you're at a gelato shop in Rome. The vendor keeps adding scoops, and you‚Äôre worried your cone might collapse. You simply say, ‚Äú*Basta cos√¨, grazie!*‚Äù and voil√†, problem solved. 

Or, picture this: your friend won‚Äôt stop talking about their latest Netflix binge. You‚Äôve heard enough, so you say, ‚Äú*Basta! Parliamo di qualcos'altro.*‚Äù It‚Äôs like hitting the pause button on a remote.

**Conjugating ""bastare""**

The verb *bastare* means ""to be enough."" It‚Äôs like the quiet kid in class‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt need much attention but gets the job done. Here‚Äôs a quick peek at how it changes with different subjects:

- **Io basto** - I am enough
- **Tu basti** - You are enough
- **Lui/Lei basta** - He/She is enough

**When to use ""basta""**

- **Quantity**: ‚Äú*Basta un caff√®*‚Äù (One coffee is enough).
- **Emotions**: ‚Äú*Non ne posso pi√π, basta!*‚Äù (I can‚Äôt take it anymore, that‚Äôs enough!).
- **Boundaries**: ‚Äú*Basta con le scuse!*‚Äù (Enough with the excuses!).

1l7kjq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1l7kjq4/i_think_i_grew_up_in_a_haunted_house/,I think I grew up in a haunted house,"**This is going to be long, so I‚Äôll try to write it in an organized way, because it could easily go off the rails. I‚Äôm going to tell you a story that lasted over ten years.**

The apartment I grew up in. Keep in mind this is from the point of view of a child between 0 and 12 years old, but I wasn‚Äôt the only one to experience paranormal things. Still, let‚Äôs be fair: I was a kid, so some of the things I‚Äôm going to tell you are definitely through a child‚Äôs eyes.

I think I should first explain what the apartment was like. I even made a little floor plan (https://postimg.cc/rdxbHNsb). The proportions aren‚Äôt exaggerated ‚Äî the apartment was MASSIVE. It was an old apartment from the 19th century, originally a hotel, and it hadn‚Äôt been renovated. Fun fact: one of the generals responsible for Napoleon‚Äôs defeat at Waterloo (Emmanuel de Grouchy) died in that building.

I shared a floor plan because it‚Äôs important to understand just how big it was ‚Äî but most of all, I have to talk about the **abandoned bathroom**, because it‚Äôs going to come up a lot. Basically, when my parents rented the apartment, *that* bathroom was supposed to be the main one, because the other one was all the way at the back of the laundry room ‚Äî super inconvenient. From my parents‚Äô bedroom to that bathroom, it was a solid two-minute walk ‚Äî not ideal when you really have to go, lmao.

Except‚Ä¶ during the move, my dad dropped a mirror that shattered on the floor. Now, I don‚Äôt believe in that kind of stuff, I‚Äôm not superstitious, and neither are my parents. But a week later, there was a massive plumbing issue and the bathroom was condemned. I‚Äôm only mentioning the mirror because it‚Äôs kind of funny ‚Äî I really don‚Äôt believe in that stuff, but it adds a little spooky twist to the story, lmao.

So those toilets became unusable, and for ten years, we really did do the whole damn hike to go pee, because those toilets were just not an option.

Now, you might say ‚Äúcool story, but who cares?‚Äù ‚Äî but no, **it‚Äôs actually really important**. That means this room was NEVER opened. It was off-limits for ten years ‚Äî not just unused, but completely off the table. I mean, why would anyone go into a useless room?

But actually, there was a reason. I don‚Äôt know ‚Äî we *could* have used it for storage or something, but nope, never. There was kind of a taboo rule in the house: **you don‚Äôt open that door**.

The truth is, that room was just seriously creepy. Like, genuinely. Nothing ever *happened* in there, but it had this mood, this atmosphere. You‚Äôd go in and it was like the sky suddenly fell on your head. The vibe was heavy and terrifying. It happened to me once or twice when we were playing hide-and-seek with friends ‚Äî I‚Äôd hide in there, and every single time I‚Äôd end up running out. It was just impossible to stay in that room for more than two minutes ‚Äî it was too oppressive.

And I wasn‚Äôt the only one who felt that. Even my parents felt the same, and if I ever dared to open the door, they‚Äôd yell at me to close it immediately.

So yeah, that‚Äôs the first and one of the most important points. I‚Äôm not going to claim anything as fact ‚Äî we still don‚Äôt know what was going on in that apartment ‚Äî but when we talk about it as a family, we kind of laugh and call that bathroom *""the ghost‚Äôs room.""* Because that room was just hell. Nothing ever happened there, and yet when I think of it, I still get chills of fear.

That was the bathroom ‚Äî now let‚Äôs move on to something more concrete‚Ä¶ and yeah, we‚Äôre staying in that room.

I lied when I said nothing ever happened ‚Äî one weird thing did, though I didn‚Äôt see it. This comes from my dad.

One day he was home alone and noticed the door to the bathroom was open. Weird. He closed it and went to watch TV.  
Thirty minutes later, the door was open again. Now he started freaking out, but thought maybe it was a draft, so he closed it again ‚Äî this time making sure it was properly shut.  
He left and‚Ä¶ yep, you guessed it ‚Äî the door opened again.

Okay, that‚Äôs kind of lame as a horror story, but it‚Äôs the creepiest thing that happened *with that door*. It never opened on its own otherwise. I know my dad got so freaked out that he just left the apartment, lmao. He was like ‚Äúnope, f\*\*k this, I‚Äôm out.‚Äù

Doors and windows opening by themselves was kind of a regular occurrence in that place, but this was the only time it happened in that particular room.

Personally, the weirdest thing I ever *saw* happened with my dad too ‚Äî and it involved a flying lighter.  
Yes, really.  
We were watching TV, there was a lighter on the coffee table, and suddenly, for absolutely no reason, we both saw it leap across the table in a huge arc. No earthquake, no bump ‚Äî nothing. The lighter just decided to jump. Why???

The creepiest event, though, is something no one saw, and no one could explain. We came back from vacation, and in my parents‚Äô bedroom, all their clothes were on the floor and the dresser drawers were wide open. At first they thought it was a break-in ‚Äî except *nothing* was stolen. Just open drawers and clothes scattered everywhere, for absolutely no reason.

And‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs pretty much it for the concrete stuff. The truth is, I don‚Äôt have any horror stories with faces or apparitions or whatever. It was all about the *atmosphere*. A very heavy, oppressive vibe in the house ‚Äî a feeling I‚Äôve never experienced anywhere else. Just the constant sensation of being watched, like something was breathing down your neck, or staring at you when your back was turned. Nothing tangible. Just‚Ä¶ a feeling. And if you‚Äôve ever lived in a weird house, you probably know exactly what I mean.

And we weren‚Äôt the only ones to feel that ‚Äî our cat did too, apparently. Sure, all cats stare at nothing sometimes, that‚Äôs normal ‚Äî but ours would do it with her tail all puffed up. You know how cats get when they‚Äôre scared or feel threatened? She did that constantly. To the point where we thought she was just crazy.  
But after we moved out? She **never did it again**. Not even once in the new apartment. Overnight, she became a totally normal cat.

There were periods where things felt more active, and I think the weirdest time was just before we moved out. Everything I‚Äôve mentioned got cranked up x1000. It was awful ‚Äî like whatever it was didn‚Äôt want us to leave.

Because honestly, *if* there was something in that apartment, I don‚Äôt think it was malicious. Like I said, we never had anything outright horrible happen. It just always felt like we weren‚Äôt alone.

That apartment stayed with me. Even now, fifteen years later, when I dream, it‚Äôs always set in that apartment. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever dreamed of living anywhere else. It really traumatized me as a kid ‚Äî I NEVER slept in my room before we moved. I‚Äôd either sleep in the living room with the TV on, or with my parents, because I was terrified. My bedroom was basically abandoned.

My brother was a teenager and had severe insomnia ‚Äî he was terrified too. One weird thing about his room: the curtains always moved. I don‚Äôt think I ever saw those curtains *not* moving in ten years

.

And now, I‚Äôm going to tell you the **creepiest** part, which ‚Äî honestly ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know if I believe. It really scares me when I think about it, but I also think maybe my family and I let our imaginations run wild.

Sadly, a friend of my parents died by suicide. She had depression, alcoholism, etc., and she hanged herself.  
In her bathroom.

The day *before* she died, we had a water leak in the laundry room. The water on the wall formed the shape of a hanging figure. It really, *really* looked like someone hanging.  
In the laundry room. Right next to the bathroom.

Needless to say, it was terrifying, and the coincidence is insane ‚Äî but personally, I‚Äôm skeptical. Still, I can‚Äôt talk about that apartment without mentioning this, because it was probably the creepiest thing I‚Äôve ever experienced.

Anyway, I think I‚Äôll stop here. It‚Äôs not well-structured, sorry ‚Äî it‚Äôs ten years of my life, and mostly more of a feeling of having lived in a haunted apartment than any actual proof. But I still think about that period in my life often.  
I don‚Äôt really know what to make of it. I‚Äôve never experienced anything like it again in any other place I‚Äôve lived. That apartment was‚Ä¶ special.  
I‚Äôm not even sure I believe in ghosts, but if we assume they *do* exist, then I can say without a single doubt:  
**that apartment was haunted.**

1l7kgw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1l7kgw8/losing_interest_and_passion_in_previous_hobbies/,Losing interest and passion in previous hobbies after working on CPTSD?,"Hey alls,

I was wondering if anyone else has had a loss of interests in things they used to like since they started working on their CPTSD? I've been treating my CPTSD with a therapist and watching videos and reading books about this topic for about 3 years now. I used to feel suicidal, had panic attacks, didn't find joy in anything. I slowly came out of all that. I don't feel suicidal, haven't had a panic attack in a while, I think I have really good self-regulation and co-regulation techniques (good friends, supportive mother). But there are many things that I used to have an interest in that...I just don't or can't get into anymore.

I used to like writing fantasy, watching anime, TV shows, listening to music, playing video games with friends, social dancing...none of that touches me anymore. In fact I'm scared to do some of that stuff. I have an abandonment trauma and it manifests as being scared / terrified of FEELING lonely and alone. These feelings don't have the most obvious triggers. So, sometimes I feel lonely and alone when I am actually alone and haven't connected with people in a day. But sometimes I'll have it when I'm around family, at a social event where I don't know many people, or coming home tired after a day's work and not having anyone to come home to.

Anyway, the thought of watching TV shows and movies by myself actually frightens a part of me now. It makes me feel even more lonely. I think part of it might be cause I really value shared experiences (not just watching a TV show, but talking about it with someone and seeing their reactions, etc.). But, since working on my CPTSD, there're very few shows I can actually just sit down by myself and watch. Watching by myself...makes me even more aware of my loneliness / aloneness.

I'm not sure about the writing bit. I used to be able to write for hours in a coffee shop by myself, even in my mid-twenties. I always had ideas for a new fantasy story. I feel there's a part of my, a little child, that still wants to write...but I just can't or don't want to. I have a theory of why this might be, but I might save that for another thread.

Anyway, just wondering if anyone else has experienced a loss of interest / hobbies? Is this part of CPTSD-Depression? The thing is, I've experienced depression before and, at least for me, this feels a little different. For example, my depression is normally accompanied by loss of libido, loss of appetite, being and feeling very hopeless and unworthy...and I don't necessarily have all those other feelings. I actually still eat pretty well, I still hit the gym (something I actually like doing now), most days I have a pretty positive view of myself: I think I'm a good guy, friend, son, and I think I'll make a good partner someday, I feel me and all my parts are worthy of love, etc., etc.

I actually just read this threat here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/rjvjft/i\_think\_allowing\_myself\_to\_be\_miserable\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/rjvjft/i_think_allowing_myself_to_be_miserable_and/)

And a part of me wonders if I just need to ALLOW myself to NOT feel interested in anything. If I need to allow myself to NOT feel pulled towards anything. Just...wallow in this feeling a bit. Just feel sad that I don't feel as interested in things that I once used to...rather than trying to figure out WHY, or finding NEW things to capture my interest.

It's the first meal I've had in a while that I thought was a good value. The service was professional and relaxed. The staff was diverse. I appreciated that when the specials were mentioned, they gave the prices. Many places don't do this, and asking how much something costs can feel awkward.

The room was very loud with all of the hard surfaces. That was the only downside to a lovely room with a rustic/industrial vibe.

We had three of the shareable plates, three cocktails, two pastas, two desserts, and a coffee for under $200, not including the tip. The portions were reasonable, so we didn't leave hungry or too stuffed.

For the shareable plates, we had the gnocchi, the octopus, and the focaccia. For me, the octopus was the standout. It was so tender and flavorful. The focaccia was delicious, and the oil served with it had a touch of heat. The gnocchi was OK.

For cocktails, my husband had two margaritas and I had a Greyhound. They were good and weren't too strong or too weak.

My husband had the lamb pasta, and it was delicious. I love lamb. I had the pistachio ravioli, and that was my only disappointment. I found it just OK, which was sad because it had everything in it that should have made it a standout for me. I love ramps, but it was just meh to me.

For desserts, my husband had the buckwheat tart, and I had the strawberries. The strawberries were delicious, not just berries and cream; the vanilla panna cotta added to the flavor. The coffee was HOT, which was just how I like it.

All of them wore casual modern urban clothing and kinda just hung out, very relaxed and slow living kinda thing. The comic should still be active and getting updates AFAIK.

The one comic I definitely remember reading that put me onto it was about the last giant left in the region. The first three panels of the first page in this mini arc described the giants as they massive and majestic beings, and how this one was possibly the last of his kind. Then the final line in the last panel was just a simple, ""We call him Sven,"" or some similarly simple name.

**Memory transcription subject: Lawrence Tillman**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: November 17, 2138.*

The debate about what to do about the yulpa had been going for almost three hours. I was tired and wanted nothing more than to go home.

My goal in coming to New Eden in the first place was to get away from the military and live in peace. I thought that a farm on a remote colony would be the trick for that, but I was finding myself increasingly pulled into contingency plans as the only resident pilot on New Eden.

To my left the door opened, and Tilly walked in. Notably she had a pair of coffee cups from Strange Brews across the street, one of which she handed to me before leaning against the wall next to me. I took a sip of the coffee, reveling in the bitter-sweet flavor.

""I still don't know how you drink that stuff"" Tilly whistled next to me. ""Give me a cup of chai any day.""

""You won't find any human pilot between here and Sol that doesn't live on coffee."" I chuckled. ""Thanks for watching the farm for me by the way.""

""No problem. You know I enjoy spending time with your cows. 14 is healing nicely by the way."" We both stared at the council as they continued their bickering. ""I'm glad you got back ok. When I heard that you got shot at I was worried.""

""You and me both."" I noticed the meeting starting to break up, with Betty walking over to us. I was still amazed that the middle-aged secretary was really one of the galaxy's most dangerous warriors, but it did me little good to question it.

""Thank you again for your piloting, Mister Tillman"" she started with a tone I knew meant there would be more. ""I'm afraid that everything is at an impasse until the files Brisby lifted can be gone through.""

""Sounds like I'm on call then"" I grumbled.

""Dust-off always is. I put forth the recommendation that the shuttle you flew be transferred to your farm, and it's been agreed to. The colony engineer will be out at your farm tomorrow with some Marston Mat and a fuel tank.""

""So much for a peaceful life...""

""Yeah, but think of how easy it will be to move cows with a shuttle, Lawrence."" Tilly whistled with mirth as she pantomimed a cow desperately trying to not be pushed into anything. ""And you'll be on-call, so you'll have to take the shuttle everywhere. Imagine how Jessica will feel when you pick her up in that instead of your Chevy crap-truck.""

""Ok, ok, enough laughing at my expense, Tilly. Like your Haul-Good is much better."" I pushed myself off the wall. ""Well, guess I'd better go home then. You know, maybe I WILL pick up Jessica in my new shuttle!""",6,1749512884.0,NatureofPredators,0,1.0,False

There are roaster reviews for around Berkeley, but I would like to go to a cafe where you can talk to the barista and discuss coffees and recipes. 

The last time I got an espresso in this area, the barista at the original Peet's in Walnut Square gave me some nice hints.  On the other hand, no one has ever reported good coffee or baristas at Peet's except in this original shop, and they aren't very innovative in their roasting any more. (True story: At another Peet's in the East Bay, i asked the barista about pre-infusion, and he said he'd never heard of that. You'd think...)

A few years ago, the blue bottle folks that showed up at Oakland Farmer's Markets used to be super-knowledgeable.  Now that blue bottle has been bought out, it's very hard to trust them. 

I googled ""best espresso in Berkeley"" and was flooded with crap non-objective stuff, no good reviews.  So, would really appreciate opinions from espresso enthusiasts.

You‚Äôve got to park it in your cheek. Let it sit there and slowly absorb rather than chewing constantly.

Also, wait about 15 minutes after chewing the gum before eating or drinking especially acidic beverages like coffee or soda. I read that it can mess up with nicotine absorption.

hey yall, i (20'ish) am seeking advice here since i have no clue what to do. back in 2021, i was told i had 21 cavities on my teeth. (i got a second opinion and they also concluded this.) i figured yeah, my teeth kinda hurt, makes sense. i was brushing twice a day, flossing occassionally (maybe two or three times a week), but not rinsing with an anticavity rinse, so i concluded 'this is my fault' and decided to take better care of them in the future. i cut sugary drinks and soda (for the most part. if i really want to drink it, i wait 30 minutes after finishing and brush since i know it can screw over my teeth).
so, exposition dump done. not the greatest at taking care of my teeth, but whatever. what's done is done. got them all filled. now i brush twice with an anticavity perscription toothpaste, floss everyday, and rinse every day with a flouride rinse. after getting these filled, 2 weeks after a filling fell out. went back and got it fixed. 2 months after that... another filling fell out. then 6 months, another fell out. and i think i have 4 other loose fillings because those teeth are painful to chew on.
i know i screwed over my teeth in the beginning, but am i doing something wrong now? is there anything i can do to further prevent this? they start coming loose when i eat harder food like veggiws and so i've avoided that for a few months but now it's happening even with soft foods. i feel like my teeth shouldn't be in such active decay now. the dentist just said my teeth are 'soft', but it seems kind of insane for all these fillings to just... fall out after they're all so new.
no clue what to do, and my dentist just says it's my fault they're coming out when i've been trying my best to take care of them. thanks in advance!!",1,1749512592.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

I have a history of a TIA (transient ischemic attack) about 11 years ago when I was 21, a genetic mutation (homozygous MTHFR c677t), recurrent miscarriages that resulted in scarring and infertility, placental abruption that resulted in massive blood loss and the need for transfusion about 14 years ago, and periods of unexplained tachycardia throughout my life. 

Recently, these tachycardic episodes have been worse. Today, I ended up in the ED because my resting heart rate was 120 sitting and would spike to 160-170 when I stood up. I was feeling short of breath, light headed, dizzy, and losing vision. Upon admittance I was tachycardic with a HR of 147 and hypertensive. When I was able to lie down and rest, my heart rate stabilized in the 90s and my blood pressure was normal. But, every time I stood up, my heart rate would jump up 30-50 BPM and my blood pressure would spike. 

All labs came back within normal limits per the NP. Since my HR and BP stabilized in supine position, he decided that the Adderall I've taken at the same dose for 2 years, and 3 sips of medium coffee I drink 3 days a week was the cause. Oh, and dehydration. Even though my labs did not indicate dehydration and I drink over 100 oz of water daily. 

My PCP refuses to hear my complaints. 
First she blamed me being fat as the cause of my symptoms. But I was fat for 2 years out of my entire life and have since lost the weight. My BMI has always been 20-22 outside of those 2 years when I gained weight, which was actually due in part to the symptoms I was already experiencing. Now, she says its because I've lost 90 lbs over 2 years and that's the reason I feel like shit. 

Basically, I'm miserable despite doing all of the things for my body that I'm supposed to do. Im desperate for relief from the constant pain and hindrance that these symptoms leave me in. 

I've brought up checking for autoimmune/hEDS/POTS but I'm brushed off. How do I get someone to listen to me? I can't even describe how debilitating this all is. I meet the criteria for EDS by a landslide and my symptoms scream dysautonomia. But no one will listen to me. ",0,1749512384.0,POTS,1,0.5,False

Prologue
 
I remember when I was a kid and how I read about stars.
 
I thought about all the different kinds of stars, and how they were all so similar but so different, and it was interesting to see how many stars there were in comparison to planets. What they were made of, how they came to be. There was one that I liked the most, though, and it was the biggest one; it was the Sun.
 
I loved the Sun, it‚Äôs what gives life to plants, energy to homes, and unfortunately burns someone when they stay outside for too long. Space is so misunderstood, and unknown and wide. And when I learned about stars, all I‚Äôve ever wanted to do was swim in the unknown surrounding the Sun.
 
I had an arsenal of unknown infinity in my bedroom, and I was overjoyed. There were NASA logos throughout my room, on my walls, on my dresser, and even on my comforter for my bed. As a 12-year-old boy, having a space bed set wasn‚Äôt the most popular thing, but I didn‚Äôt care about what other kids said. I mean, I‚Äôm sure there were boys in my grade that still had Spider-Man pajamas, so who was I to care.
 
If you were to take a look at me, I looked like a kid that liked everything and anything about science, anyway. And I‚Äôm sure if there were poster-child auditions for NASA, I would have gotten the role before stepping into the audition room. I had the nerdy glasses, the ones that fell down my nose, and I had to push them up about every minute.
 
On the weekends, I would help my mom cook dinner and sometimes we would bake together. Even though I was a very nerdy, science-y kid, I still wanted to take time to bake with my mom.
 
There was one day that I had an accident in the kitchen, one I haven‚Äôt forgotten, but one that I‚Äôve never taken seriously. It was a Saturday, because I remember my mom made her sourdough bread every Saturday, and waking up in my bed that morning, I smelled the distinct smell of the dough.
 
I remember getting out of bed, putting on my glasses, and walking out of my room clumsily into the hallway, which I thought was weird. I would usually consider myself a person who is pretty put together, I mean I‚Äôm not very haphazardly. So, when I saw my clumsy feet move step by step through blurred vision, I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what was happening, but I knew it wasn‚Äôt my ‚Äònormal‚Äô
 
Walking into the kitchen, I remember my mom having a slightly concerned look on her face, as if she knew my condition wasn‚Äôt normal for me.
 
‚ÄúSweetheart, are you ok? It looks like you‚Äôre walking around with the sun in your eyes. Are you feeling alright?‚Äù
 
My mom had a habit of making serious situations lighter by adding a bit of humor to them, which both my father and I admired about her, considering we couldn‚Äôt do that. Regardless, I still don‚Äôt understand why she made that joke, considering I have no idea what that meant.
 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm ok, I think.‚Äù I said groggily, ‚ÄúMaybe I just slept wrong. Do we have any medicine for headaches?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúYes, we should have something, I‚Äôll run and get it.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúThanks mom. I‚Äôm not sure why my head hurts so much.‚Äù
 
I swore she said something, but I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what she said though. It almost sounded like ‚Äúit‚Äôs the day.‚Äù
 
While my mother was leaving the kitchen, I heard the timer for the sourdough in the oven, it was done and needed some time to rest out of the oven. Since I was in the kitchen already, I started to get oven mitts on to take it out. I had done it a hundred times; how would this time be any different?
 
I remember the mitts being green with white spots, I think they were checkered. They were big oven mitts, I remember this because they would almost go to my elbows, and it seemed like I had a suit of armor with them on.
 
After putting on the gloves and opening the oven door, I grabbed the pot where the bread was being made and felt an odd sensation that shouldn‚Äôt have been there.
 
Heat.
 
I looked down at my hands and felt my hands against the searing pot.
 
As soon as I touched the pot, I felt no pain, but I heard a hum. A hum that seemed to last for an hour, which was much longer than the time I held onto it. It was an ominous, ghastly noise, it was like the reverberations from the hum sprouted death from its noise. If I had one way to describe it, I would say it was blinding.
 
‚ÄúBen, let go of the pot!‚Äù My mom screamed. I couldn‚Äôt let go; I was frozen.
 
‚ÄúMy hands aren‚Äôt moving, Mom! Help me!‚Äù
 
‚ÄúA little longer, Bennnnnnjamin‚Äù someone said to me, but I didn‚Äôt know who said it.
 
I remember the heat, and the pain, but I don‚Äôt know why I held on to that pot. I just remember as soon as I let go, as if I was permitted to do so, my hands were a mess of burnt, blackened skin, I lost my fingertips and all the skin on the surface of my hands.
 
The strangest part, almost as strange as my hands being glued to the pot itself, was the distinct mark I saw on my right hand, but not my left. But there was no symbol or part of the pot that would make that mark.
 
‚ÄúDo you like your new tattoo? Don‚Äôt worry, this one isn‚Äôt some boring temporary one.‚Äù The voice spoke again.
 
My mother looked wondrously at the mark, she took a couple seconds to look at it before coming to her senses, realizing my hands were scorched.
 
‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you let go? Your poor hands...‚Äù My mother was shocked.
 
‚ÄúI-I don‚Äôt know. I just couldn‚Äôt. It hurts so bad!‚Äù I said, horrified at myself.
 
I didn‚Äôt cry when I sat on the floor with my mother as she interrogated me. I just stared at the mark. I stared at it when it turned from a barely visible mark to a black symbol on my hand, as dark as night, and as barren as space.
 
‚ÄúCome up off the floor, let‚Äôs get you to the hospital.‚Äù Mom said.
 
I reluctantly did so, still holding my hands out in front of me.
 
As we were on our way to the hospital, the pain grew, and I couldn‚Äôt hold back tears. It was awful, the pain and the entire experience. It just didn‚Äôt make any sense.
 
‚ÄúHoney, why didn‚Äôt you put the gloves on?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúW-What?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúThe oven mitts, you didn‚Äôt put them on.‚Äù
 
Now I was terrified, I swore I put them on. I remember how they felt on my arms.
 
‚ÄúI thought I did, I remember putting them on!‚Äù
 
‚ÄúBen, the gloves were on the kitchen counter still.‚Äù
 
I didn‚Äôt understand. What was happening to me, and why me?
 
At that point, I remember sitting in the car looking at my hands, almost hypnotized by my lack of carefulness. I had so, so many questions.
 
But what was the hum echoing through my head and whose voice did I hear when I touched the pot?
 
 
Chapter 1
 
I woke up and smelled the Coors off my breath and in the cans on the floor. After wincing at the brilliant sunlight coming through my curtains, I metamorphosized from being groggy to my dreary, conscious state, knowing I needed to get my ass up.
 
I didn‚Äôt want to get up for my job, but it was a job, just not a NASA position. All I did was take pictures of space and send them to the company I worked for, which was a textbook company that included pictures of space and stars. It made me money, so I can‚Äôt complain.
 
I got up, put my almost broken glasses on my face, and got ready to edit pictures I took the night prior. This was my every morning routine, and usually it involved me getting a little bit of whiskey in my coffee. That was probably one of the only things in my day that I looked forward to. And that probably made me an alcoholic.
 
Luckily, I got to work on my own time, and that meant I didn‚Äôt have to deal with people annoying me off with questions I had no desire to answer. There is only one time, however, where I must endure a lot of stupid questions: the company dinner. It‚Äôs only once a year, but the last couple years or so I haven‚Äôt bothered to go, even though I have nothing better to do.
 
I confessed my frustration about this event constantly to two people, my friend and coworker Aaron, and my partner-in-crime, the printing service employee in my hometown, Gary. Poor Gary gets most of that, Aaron not so much.
 
Like last week at lunch, when I got the email on my phone and groaned. Both looked up in surprise, they didn‚Äôt know I was capable of such explicit negative emotion.
 
‚ÄúThe hell‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äù Gary teased. ‚ÄúYou get one of ‚Äòem fancy emails like last year?‚Äù I swear his voice is just a stereotypical Southern accent from any Southern movie ever.
 
‚ÄúYeah, I just got the email too. It‚Äôs that stupid dinner party again.‚Äù Aaron shrugged and crossed his arms. He had his own reasons for disliking the party.
 
‚ÄúWell damn, looks like you boys got a party to go to!‚Äù I told Gary to please lower his voice and enthusiasm for something he‚Äôll never have the money to attend.
 
Gary made a noise and trudged out the restaurant. Aaron sighed and shot me a look that called me out.
 
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to be a dick to him just because you don‚Äôt want to do something. What are you, a toddler?‚Äù
 
My occasional temper and hotheaded nature are usually quelled by Aaron‚Äôs calm, yet stern personality. It was a good balance between us.
 
‚ÄúI‚Äôll apologize to him later, I‚Äôm supposed to print off some pictures later that I took last night. Pretty sure his shift started soon anyway.‚Äù
 
He smiled a bit and then pat my shoulder. ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs go. I have to get some sleep in a bit so I can take more pictures tonight.‚Äù I always thought his sleep schedule was weird.
 
Aaron was experienced in the job, I would say more than me. His parents worked in a couple different companies and organizations that operated from NASA. They made Aaron go into this field. And even though he was good at it, he didn‚Äôt want to do it. He even got three different work opportunities from NASA, but he had declined all of them.
 
But Gary, on the other hand, wasn‚Äôt so lucky with his opportunities. He flunked out of college after barely passing high school, but he got the job he‚Äôs in now because it‚Äôs the family business. A couple days a week, I dropped by the printing office and had peculiar or admirable shots printed, just to keep for myself.
 
All three of us had a tradition to go to our favorite bar downtown every Friday night, not necessarily to socialize with people at the bar, but just to come by and catch up. We‚Äôve probably had this tradition for about a year or two, and I started inviting Gary recently.
 
I got to the bar first this time, and Aaron came through the doors a couple minutes after I did. He looked a bit different than usual, something seemed off, but I brushed it aside. He smiled at me and sat down.
 
Gary didn‚Äôt come by in the first ten minutes, which was a sign that he wasn‚Äôt coming at all. This was pretty normal recently, though.
 
Aaron and I talked about our own individual work and the struggles that came with it, we complained about his family and expressed guilt for mine.
 
Aside from my parents, I didn‚Äôt really know any of my family. Neither my mother or my father introduced me to anyone, and now that I mentioned it, they never really talked about them. For the last 9 years, it‚Äôs been harder and harder to talk to them about things, especially my family, since they both got sick when I went into high school.
 
‚ÄúRot.‚Äù The voice in my head demanded maliciously and broke me out of a stupor.
 
‚ÄúBen, you alright?‚Äù I felt beads of sweat drop from my face and the stare of my friend inviting me to speak. Being careful not to have Aaron notice, I pulled the glove onto my right hand tighter to my wrist.
 
‚ÄúYeah, sorry.‚Äù Being honest about that voice hasn‚Äôt been easy lately. ‚ÄúWhat were you saying about your parents?‚Äù I said, rubbing my head.
 
Aaron looked concerned, it seems like for more than one reason. ‚ÄúJust that they were being very prominent about this NASA operation they heard about. I forget the name of it, but they mentioned it being one of the most confidential tasks the administration has had.‚Äù Aaron said. I‚Äôve never heard him mention anything specific about any NASA information relayed from his parents, and it concerned me that he did this time.
 
‚ÄúSounds so interesting, right up your alley.‚Äù I said sarcastically. I tend to make jokes when I‚Äôm nervous, I think both Aaron and I do that.
 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a damn about it‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure why my parents are still so insistent on me following in their footsteps. I feel like Harry Osborn in Spider-Man. Specifically the one with Tobey.‚Äù He spoke.
 
I chuckled at the reference. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just what they think is best for you. I mean, they can see you are going on a good path, and you are talented with this sort of work.‚Äù
 
Aaron seemed frustrated, not at me, but the subject. ‚ÄúYeah well, they sucked at being parents, but they wanted to be the best work connections. I‚Äôve just had enough. They keep sucking me into all their work issues and projects, even though I‚Äôm fine with where I‚Äôm at. Honestly, I‚Äôve felt happier at this job more than ever these past couple of weeks.‚Äù
 
I felt bad, this wasn‚Äôt something I could relate to. I dismissed the subject, and realized how busy the bar was, which gave us the signal to leave and part ways.
 
Walking out of the bar, Aaron always goes right, and I go left. It‚Äôs always been like that. He went left with me, and it caught me off guard. He still seemed off. He had the same look on his face from when he got to the bar, and his shoulders seemed to stay by his neck, almost as if he was in a permanent shrug position. I may not be the best communicator, but I am very good at reading body language.
 
‚ÄúAre you ok?‚Äù
 
He looked at me with a fear I‚Äôve never seen in his eyes before. A fear I‚Äôve never seen from anyone.
 
‚ÄúThat project I mentioned, it‚Äôs hell on earth. I don‚Äôt give a shit if my parents want me to do it. I saw the file for it; I‚Äôve never heard anything like it. I wish I never opened that fucking folder.‚Äù
 
That fear set in those eyes of his started to creep into me.
 
‚ÄúWhat do you mean? What was in the file? You know you can talk to me, Aaron, I see how this is bothering you.‚Äù It really started to worry me, too. And I don‚Äôt get worried easily
 
‚ÄúBen, you don‚Äôt understand. No one in NASA wants to volunteer for this project, there isn‚Äôt one board member that wants to look further into it, the board wants it dismissed. It‚Äôs like I said, it‚Äôs one of the most confidential projects they have.‚Äù
 
From above me, I felt a presence that I hadn‚Äôt felt in some time, like something was watching me. It wasn‚Äôt a bird or anything flying above, but it felt like something I couldn‚Äôt see, or something that didn‚Äôt want me to see it. It made me feel uneasy, but the noise, the hum made me feel worse.
 
I began to shake a bit, but at this point I was too terrified to care. He looked more like a paranoid drug addict than his calm, collected self. I felt like I have seen this kind of thing before, but I couldn‚Äôt place it at the time.
 
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me we contacted something. Not something from out there.‚Äù I was terrified.
 
‚ÄúNo, they contacted us. All I can say is one thing, something I‚Äôve heard from my parents, they seemed deranged talking about it. They say whatever contacted us made its first notice years ago.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúWhat do you mean ‚Äòsomething?‚Äô‚Äù
 
‚ÄúNo one knows what it is, or what its name is.‚Äù Aaron whispered, tears beginning to form around his eyes. I had never seen any sort of strong emotion like this come from him.
 
He took a deep breath, and immediately shuddered, tears hitting the sidewalk a couple paces from the bar. He then reached into his work bag, which he brings with him everywhere, even to the bar each Friday.
 
‚ÄúTake it, I don‚Äôt want anything to do with it. That file has been the bane of my fucking existence.‚Äù He handed me a yellow file; it was so heavy I almost dropped it when he shoved it into my hands.
 
As Aaron gave me the file, the burn mark on my hand started to tingle, and then seemed to start to burn, as if someone put a hot iron on my hand. It was an excruciating, highly unsettling feeling, and I had never experienced this before. I thought Aaron would mention it, or ask what‚Äôs wrong, but he simply left, eager to get away from the file that tormented him.
 
As he was walking away, I noticed how quick his pace was. He walked in a quick, almost forced pace. It made my skin crawl to see how worried he was. But I didn‚Äôt know anxiety and fear made someone have limp feet, he was dragging them behind him. He walked as if he had Parkinson‚Äôs or something, like he couldn‚Äôt control his body.
 
‚ÄúI thank you for the invitation, Benjamin.‚Äù The voice said, it sounded as if whatever was speaking was smiling.
 
I looked down at the bulky, beige folder my friend, who now seemed like a stranger, gave to me. The file read, in bold, red lettering:
 
Ashbed.
 
Chapter 2
 
When I was a kid, my mom sang me a song and read me a story to me before I went to bed. She seemed to know all the words and tunes to my bedtime routine, which surprised me since she didn‚Äôt read or sing from any book. She just knew everything she was saying.
 
I never understood anything she said to me while singing, it wasn‚Äôt in English. But I didn‚Äôt care, I was a kid. Recently, though, I‚Äôve been thinking about the song, and how it sounded. As a child, I was delighted and excited to hear the song, I looked forward to it every night. Now, it doesn‚Äôt have the same comfort to give me. It only gives me
 
‚ÄúFear.‚Äù
 
My parents took videos of me as a child, they were old VHS home videos that lay buried in our attic, among many boxes no one has the motivation to go through. I remember seeing a couple when my parents got sick, going through those boxes gave me something to do when I was home from college.
 
One of the videos that I saw while I was on summer break terrified me so much, I never wanted to watch another home video from the attic again.
 
I‚Äôm pretty sure this video had a number on it, a fraction really. It read ‚Äú37/39,‚Äù which probably indicated that there were 39 total tapes that were made. Why 39? Not a clue.
 
When the film started, I knew from the background that the location of interest was the living room. The orange couch I pretended to be a spaceman on lay against the yellow paint of the walls.
 
I was yelling something in a much longer voice than I should‚Äôve been, I couldn‚Äôt even hear anything else in the video. Just a chant my mom used to say to me, and now I was saying it as I jumped up and down on the couch like it was my personal anti-gravity jump pad.
 
I did quiet down though. I almost went to a whisper.
 
‚ÄúHow do I not remember any of this‚Äù I spoke aloud, grateful no voice in my head answered me. He has a bad habit of finishing my sentences sometimes.
 
My life after receiving that file didn‚Äôt feel the same. I thought it was downhill anyway, but this seemed like I was trying to swim up a waterfall. It‚Äôs been about a week now, and I haven‚Äôt heard from Aaron since.
 
That feeling of being watched didn‚Äôt stop, but it didn‚Äôt necessarily get worse over time. There were sometimes that I hadn‚Äôt felt like someone was staring at me. I felt better when I went inside just about any building.
 
The other thing I noticed was that it got hotter, but it was October, and last week it was about twenty degrees cooler. I hated the heat, I always have.
 
To add to these issues, I have felt increasingly scared and paranoid at just about everything. Not only that, but I get physically angry and violent if I‚Äôm too overwhelmed, which isn‚Äôt normal for me. With my mood changing, I started to take my meds again, they helped me a bit with my anxiety.
 
But I had someone to visit today. Something told me I had to, it seemed like the only thing that might help me. I went down the street to my apartment in the small town I‚Äôve lived in all my life and arrived at the cemetery.
 
My dad‚Äôs grave was one of the brightest gravestones I had ever seen, and every time I go to visit him, it always shocks me. On some days, it‚Äôs so bright I feel the need to put sunglasses on to block the rays of the sun that bounce off it into my eyes.
 
Walking down the trail, I felt uneased to see my father‚Äôs name etched in the eternal stone of death, like I did last Saturday, and the Saturday before.
 
‚ÄúHey, dad. Sorry It‚Äôs been a bit; I‚Äôve been busy lately.‚Äù My voice came out shakingly.
 
I set the roses on his grave.
 
‚ÄúLife has been weird lately, pops.‚Äù I said, sitting down in front of the stone. ‚ÄúActually, it‚Äôs been fucked. I found that tape from the attic, and I keep thinking about mom. And damn near everything else in my life has been all over the place. Aaron hasn‚Äôt called me in a while, and I just can‚Äôt-‚Äù My tears started flowing.
 
The remnants of my tears landed on the gravestone, and sizzled when they landed. They kept coming, and the hissing continued. It went on for a minute or two, and then I stopped. Eyes still closed, I caught the scent of metal.
 
Blood was cooking onto the stone, it covered every inch of my body, and I had to wipe it off my eyes and face so I could see. The crimson liquid poured through my fingers, and I felt my heart stop.
 
Opening my eyes, I realized I was still in front of my father‚Äôs grave. But the stone wasn‚Äôt bright or intact anymore. It was split, and some parts had been charred. Its brilliant light was dimmed to a dark, shadowy form.
 
I looked to see if the other graves were still intact, but they were gone. So was the grass, the sky, and all the light. I sat, with my father‚Äôs grave, in the depths of space, unknowing of how I got there or if it was real.
 
‚ÄúHow the hell did I get here?‚Äù I was panicked, my heart practically throbbing in my chest, and my muscles as tense as the stone in front of me.
 
‚ÄúBenajaminnnnnn.‚Äù
 
I reeled around behind me, then to my sides. All around me, the voice spoke to me in an echoing, bellowing roar. The voice that had been in my head for so long was no surrounding me, from everywhere and anywhere I looked.
 
‚ÄúWhat do you want? Who are you?!‚Äù I screamed, just as fearful as I was angry.
 
The voice laughed at me, it sounded like a maniacal, mocking tone. He was toying with me, trying to make me break.
 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been in my head for years! What do you want from me?!‚Äù
 
The laughing stopped abruptly.
 
‚ÄúHow na√Øve you are, child. My voice has been the epicenter of your life, and you think it‚Äôs only been years.‚Äù The voice chuckled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been with you for much, much longer.‚Äù
 
In the distance of the desolate wastes of darkness, a faint, red star emerged. It blinked several times before glowing, shrouding my vision with luminous vermillion rays. As painful it was to look at, it was painful to feel it‚Äôs rays on my body.
 
‚ÄúThrough each fleeting moment of your life, I‚Äôve been right here, Benjamin. Allll your life, I was pleased to be the higher power influencing your every, insignificant move.‚Äù
 
The light grew closer, sweeping away the hair on my head. The smell of scorched hair and burning skin disgusted me. I couldn‚Äôt believe the immense power the star held. I felt like someone put me in a stove; the pain was incomprehensible.
 
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been RIGHT HERE, all this time! Can you believe it, I‚Äôm the angel on your shoulder!!‚Äù
 
My mouth erupted into a burning roar of fury and terror. My eyes wouldn‚Äôt let me look away from the sight in front of me. The bones of my hands started to become visible, not long before they burned away too.
 
‚ÄúGo back to hell, you fucking MONSTER!!‚Äù It was the only thing I could manage to shriek from my melting throat.
 
The star, as it became closer and closer, went from a red to a bright, demonic orange orb. It blasted the remnants of my limbs away, leaving me with a shell of my physical being.
 
A scream erupted from the hell around me. It was like a concussive blast, ripping away any faith of escape I had. It took my willpower and consumed it in one bite.
 
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get it, Benjamin! My job is not done; I can‚Äôt go home just yet!‚Äù The voice lashed its words against the rest of my body, making me plead for the release of death, for the rest of my being to crumble to dust and scatter amongst the stars. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be mine for as longggg as I want you to be!!‚Äù
 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have a HELL OF A TIME, BENJAMIN!!‚Äù
 
When I came to, the noise ended, and I felt the grass on my hands again. I was sobbing, and I reached to feel my body unharmed and back to normal. The illusion was gone, but I still felt blood on my head, and my hand.
 
While I was in space talking to what seemed to be the devil himself, I was punching my fathers‚Äô grave with my left hand. Several of my fingers were mangled, and bones protruded from them. What seemed to awake me from the illusion, however, wasn‚Äôt my broken fingers and hand, but the wound from my head.
 
I got another mark, and it was covered in blood. It wasn‚Äôt like the mark I had before on my hand, but it was just as horrifying. The shape was a triangle enveloped in a circle. I didn‚Äôt know what it meant, but it terrified me.
 
Before rushing to get to my car to go to the hospital, I heard one final comment from the voice.
 
‚ÄúNow, you‚Äôre mine. Welcome to my Hell.‚Äù
 
Chapter 3
 
Since my parents got sick and were bedridden, they couldn‚Äôt help me with getting my driver‚Äôs license. I had to work with the teacher at my school to help me get my hours in. I will say, they sucked at teaching me, but I got pretty good at it. But driving with broken hands was not at all a part of the driving experience. I doubt my parents could have helped with that too.
 
My car sped down streets, occasionally hitting a curb or two. My hand was on fire, giving me the highest sensation of pain I thought I could feel. Whatever this voice, this thing is, it can‚Äôt stop coming after me. And it can‚Äôt stop messing up my hands. What the hell is it, and what does it want with me?
 
Arriving at the hospital, I ran into the emergency wing, and they had me in a private accommodation room in no time. I had surgery as soon as the doctor could come in. Oddly enough, it was the same doctor who treated my burned hands when I was a kid, and when I got the first mark.
 
‚ÄúWell Ben, you got some awful fractures in your hand. You‚Äôre lucky that you can still use it.‚Äù The doctor mentioned solemnly. I forgot his name until I saw the shiny name tag dangling from his neck.
 
‚ÄúYeah, thanks Dr. Winchester.‚Äù I was too panicked and angry to be sarcastic. I‚Äôm just glad my hand and forehead are all bandaged up.
 
‚ÄúJust give it some time. I‚Äôll give you some medication for the pain and healing, but you won‚Äôt be able to use your left hand to its fullest extent for a while. Also, I can provide some ointment for the wound on your forehead, too.‚Äù Dr. Winchester said, a worried expression crossing his face.
 
I looked up at him, and I think he knew I was scared. ‚ÄúI appreciate it‚Äù
 
‚ÄúBen, what did you say happened to your hand?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúSome equipment of mine fell onto my hand‚Äù It was a lie, and I‚Äôd be damned to tell him the truth. He wouldn‚Äôt believe me, no one would.
 
‚ÄúI see. Well, just give me a call if you need anything.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúYep, will do.‚Äù
 
I walked out of the hospital, and I felt just as bad as when I ran in. Sure, physically I was good, but I was all sorts of messed up otherwise.
After getting home, the last thing I wanted to do was start working. I had looked into the deepest reaches of space somehow, and I still can‚Äôt get that voice out of my head. The burning scent of my body being torn to shreds won‚Äôt leave my nose, either.
 
I sat down at the counter, poured myself a drink, and emptied the glass as fast as I poured it. I did that again, and again, and again. I drank until the bottle was empty, and then I threw it on the ground.
 
Tears streamed down my face again, and I was back to being in the darkest parts of my soul. I walked slowly to my room, laid on the bed, and cried until I fell asleep.
 
I woke up several hours later to what sounded like a stampede in the dining room. My body lunged to sit up in my bed, listening to what could have made that sound.
 
I swore I locked the door to my place when I came back from the hospital.  Did someone break into my place? There is one, maybe two people that could have known where the spare key was located, in case of an emergency.
 
Getting up, the floorboards underneath me just barely creaking, I took a bat out of my open closet and headed to the dining room.
 
I wish I could hear any additional noise, but my heart moved to my ears, and I was so consumed by fear that I was shocked my legs were still moving, growing closer and closer to what could be the monster I encountered earlier that day.
 
Walking into the kitchen, my fear of death was replaced by a sense of confusion and shock.
 
Everything in my apartment was a mess. Drawers and doors were flung open and torn from their hinges, dishes and silverware lay on the floor broken and strewn around. Food from the fridge and cabinets were open and flung around the place like a Jackson Pollack painting. The lights flickered, making every inch of the apartment light up ever so slightly, before the light lost hope.
 
I was disturbed at the sight, and then I saw something that made me freeze, my gaze frozen on what horror I was looking at. It made my blood boil as if I was over a fire, and it convinced me God was not watching over me.
 
Among the mess of my apartment, Aaron was hunched over, looking as if he was eating something. His back was turned towards me, and the sounds of him eating was that of a wild dog finding an old carcass, finally finding a source of energy to keep living.
 
He was clawing at the floor, his hands a mess of ash and blood. It was as if he stuck his hands into a fire and clawed at the coals which created man‚Äôs first light. His appearance was soul crushing, his clothes matted and torn into shreds and burned on some ends. I could see his spine protruding from his back, and his ribs were just as visible.
 
He shook as he finished eating the last of the Campbell‚Äôs chunky soup that was in my pantry, letting the can hit the floor. I shuddered and gasped under my breath. As soon as I did so, he froze. He knew I was there.
 
Shaking and twitching, he slowly stood up from where he sat on my floor. The jerking movements he made reminded me of the last time I saw him, after the bar. A strong, overwhelming feeling of guilt pierced my heart, and as it did, he turned to look at me.
 
There were chunks of hair missing from his head, like someone ripped them out. Teeth were missing, some were barely holding onto his gums. Claw marks were all over his face, mostly by his eyes, which pierced into my soul, giving me a sick reminder of the monster that took me to Hell.
 
The black soulless eyes stared into mine, almost like it was looking at me to tell me that Aaron wasn‚Äôt home. And he wasn‚Äôt coming back.
 
‚ÄúB-Ben‚Äù Aaron croaked. His voice sounded like someone silenced it, like someone put a pillow over his face and expected him to talk. I whimpered at the sound of his voice.
 
‚ÄúAaron? Wh-What happened to you? We need to get you to the hospital, now!!‚Äù I said through tears.
 
He was silent for several seconds, still twitching and eyeing me. What happened next has forever been seared into my brain.
 
As Aaron opened his mouth, a voice erupted from it that wasn‚Äôt his. It gave me no indication that it was human, and it spoke in a voice so low I only heard it due to the silence that shook the entire apartment.
 
‚ÄúNo, Ben. I‚Äôm right where I want to be. We are right where we want to be.‚Äù The monster spoke.
 
Broken from my stupor of fear and regret, my hand tightened on the bat a bit as he started hobbling towards me.
 
‚ÄúAaron has told me so much about you, Ben. I had to ask him a few times, but he broke eventually.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúNo, not you. NOT YOU!‚Äù I screamed through my clenched teeth.
 
‚ÄúWhat the fuck did you do to him!?!‚Äù
 
‚ÄúMe? Did I do something to him?‚Äù The voice laughed at me, drawing closer with each step Aaron‚Äôs body took.
 
‚ÄúHe read the file, the one he gave you. It seems he just couldn‚Äôt handle it. It‚Äôs not my fault he‚Äôs pitiful and weak.‚Äù He was trying to make me break now, too.
 
‚ÄúJust leave me alone‚Ä¶ Please.‚Äù I pleaded with him, who was using my friends‚Äô body like a puppet.
 
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do that. Although, I can give you a message that your friend just told me.‚Äù
 
I gained no hope from that statement. Both Aaron and I stopped. And then it spoke again.
 
‚ÄúHe told me you look delicious.‚Äù
 
Aaron lunged at me, his black eyes still as empty and dark, yet they had a sense of derangement. His mouth open, hands up in claws ready to tear open my flesh, headed toward me faster than a person should be able to move.
 
I tripped and fell on my back, the bat still in my hands. His ravenous jaws sank onto the wood of the bat, ripping a tooth from his mouth. As he voraciously gnawed at the bat, splinters of wood falling onto my poorly guarded face, ashes started to collect on the bat. How is that even possible?
 
Gathering enough strength, I booted his light, yet ferocious body off me, and he hit the cabinets behind him, which crashed as his head received cuts from the already broken wood. It didn‚Äôt seem to bother him, and he didn‚Äôt mind the flowing blood from his temple.
 
Sitting up, he clawed the flesh on his head, making him bleed even more.
 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre waitinggggg for you, Bennnn.‚Äù The voice said mockingly.
 
Too scared to respond, I swung the bat at Aaron‚Äôs face, which made a hollow thud sound and a crack in his head.
 
‚ÄúCome to the party, everyone is happy to see you! All your friends, everyone you‚Äôve ever known! We know you‚Äôre not happy to be there, but we want you there so bad!!‚Äù
 
I didn‚Äôt know what he was talking about. My instincts didn‚Äôt tell me to stop and listen, it told me to bash Aaron‚Äôs brains in. I needed that voice to stop talking to me.
 
Hitting Aaron‚Äôs gaunt body over and over, I screamed at the top of my lungs as if I was a man going to war. Each hit broke a bone, his ribs, his legs, his forearms, all of it. I couldn‚Äôt stop, not even after I realized he stopped moving entirely.
 
He croaked one last time, sitting in the pool of his blood. I didn‚Äôt see it then, but it reminded me of a story I had heard in school. It was the story of a boy using wax to give himself freedom, not soon after falling from the sky.
 
Falling to my knees, dropping the bat from my right hand, I stared at my friend‚Äôs corpse. He looked dead now, but he already looked dead before he saw me.
 
Unexpectedly, I said a prayer to myself, and one to Aaron. I was never religious, but I hoped it fixed something in me that had broken as I killed my friend.
 
As someone grabbed my shoulder with an icy grip, laying softly on my bare skin, my sorrow dissipated.
 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just getting started.‚Äù
 
Looking up slowly, I saw that the figure that was speaking wasn‚Äôt human, and it wasn‚Äôt like anything I had ever seen. It was a black shroud, with stars dotted around its body, it looked like someone painted them on there.
 
The fingers of the being itself were long and slender, and there were sharp talons on the ends of them. While the hand lay on my shoulder, I felt like my flesh would succumb to the hopeless, desolate despair that was death. It rid me of any hope, yet again.
 
A bright, evil sun lay in the center of its chest, surrounded by stars. Beams of light and crescents stemmed from it, making it look more like a symbol than the biggest star. Its eyes were bleak, they were just two stars looking down on me. It had no face, just those eyes.
 
‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù I muttered, tears rolling down my face just like the hope leaving my spirit.
 
‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt your mom tell you? She told you my name over and over. Don‚Äôt you remember sitting by her side, while she was sick and suffering?‚Äù The empty face grew a smile.
 
It was true, she said a name many times, I hated when she said it. For a whole year, that‚Äôs the only word she ever said.
 
Realization hit me, and it must have been drawn on my face that I knew. The being leaned down, it‚Äôs face right in front of mine.
 
‚ÄúGo ahead and say it, Ben.‚Äù
 
Without thinking, I spoke and said the name that haunted me for years. When my parents were sick, when I was left to be my own person with them left in their beds, and the name that entered my dreams at night.
 
It was the name of the voice in my head since I got the mark on my hand, the name of the devil on my shoulder for years. It was pure evil, and a name I never said aloud.
 
‚ÄúUtu.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúBingo.‚Äù
 
As Utu disappeared before my eyes, I remember falling forward, hitting my head on a broken drawer on the floor, and passing out.

Toronto‚Äôs a big place, full of people who sometimes just skim the surface. I‚Äôm here because I want more than that. I want real conversations, moments that slow down time, and connections that go beyond the usual small talk.

If you‚Äôre in your late 20s or early 30s, and you‚Äôre someone who likes diving deep ‚Äî whether into ideas, emotions, or just life‚Äôs strange twists ‚Äî I‚Äôd really like to hear from you.

Maybe we start with a walk by the lake, a coffee somewhere cozy, or just exploring the city‚Äôs quieter spots (I spotted a momma deer and a baby deer a few weekends ago in the city). No pressure, no rush ‚Äî just two people seeing if there‚Äôs something real.

If that sounds like you, send me a message. Let‚Äôs figure out if there‚Äôs a spark.

I‚Äôm a 24F with schizoaffective bipolar type (essentially bipolar 1 + schizophrenia) as well as a history of anorexia.

After hospitalisation for a psychotic episode 2 years ago I was put on 600g for Seroquel, a mixture of immediate and modified release, morning and night. Before hand I had been on 300mg of XR for bipolar but was still having break through manic episodes. Since being on 600 I have only had minor hypomanic episodes and no psychotic episodes, so I know this dose works well for me.

I had been on abilify before hand which triggered a manic episode. I‚Äôve been advised other antipsychotics are the same or worse for weight gain.

In the past 6 months I have rapidly put on 30+kg, majority on my stomach. I am on metformin but have continued to gain weight. I went from 65kg to now 100kg. My diet is  mostly unprocessed, gluten & dairy free. I often only have 2 meals a day. Eg. today I had oats & coffee, and then avocado on toast. I am working on exercising more

I am starting to get desperate in regards to this weight gain and I‚Äôm not sure how much more things I can restrict from my diet. My dr has made it clear it is not my diet and is my metabolism being fucked from Seroquel but I still know diet makes an impact. Also I don‚Äôt get munchies from seroquel. Only side effect is weight gain. I am frightened I will end up with type 2 diabetes but I also don‚Äôt want to trigger my anorexia again

I run a non-profit that raises awareness about grief. I want to make an impactful radio ad and/or video ad that runs along this premise:

  
***Grief is often suffered in silence, but what does that silence sound like?***

And then there'd be recordings of dozens of different voices saying single line statements that sum up the type of grief they're experiencing. 

Here are some **examples**:

""I still grab a second cup when I'm making my morning coffee.""  
""Their toothbrush is still in the cup, like they might come back.""  
""My body is here, but I don't recognize it anymore.""  
""They were supposed to keep me safe, but they never knew what was happening.""  
""We built a life together, and now I live in the ruins of it.""  
""I still sleep with the door cracked open, just in case they come home.""

They don't have to be your personal statements - I can provide the verbiage or you can use your own creativity. I just need the statements to be impactful, indirect (no ""I lost my career because of an injury""), and clean recordings.

Burned and then blended.
That is how my exhaustion ended. 

The brew is so divine.
The temperature is just fine.
With milk and sugar mixed 
Will get everything fixed.

But who is there to say? 
That it's a healthy way.
To cope will all the stress.
That makes my life a mess.

Yet still I can't refuse.
And my caffeine abuse.
Continues endlessly.
As I drink eagerly.

I take a lengthy sip.

Hit with might and bliss.
I slip into the life abyss.

There was an instance where I didn‚Äôt sleep for around 3 days on adderall and coffee and i had rhis moment where my friend was talking to me and i completely disassociated and couldnt process what she was saying to me. Honestly ever sicne that i dont think ive been normal. After that experience i felt like i was stuck in my own head and it was such a scary experience i dont even jnow how to describe it. The closest thing i can self diagnose myself with is that i went through a disassociation episode but it lasted for a while and i think it still might be on going. When thsi first started i literally felt like i had NO control of my body. I couldnt respond to people the way i want to, and the best way to describe it is i was stuck in my own thoughts and when i spoke it wasnt really me speaking??? I dont know what happened im scared i fucked up my brain from the adderall and caffeine. I have been pretty depressed since and gained so much weight which is making me so self conscious. When i was disassociating i couldnt control my appetite and binged so hard for some reason. Ive found that a lot of my symptoms correlate with autistic burnout and regression but idk im not diagnosed but i would appreciate advice on how i could feel normal again.

1l7jpg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1l7jpg7/34m_seeking_the_fervent_curious_and_authentic/,"[34/M] - Seeking the fervent, curious, and authentic","Hello!

I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection and engagement with another person.

I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul. All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you?

I'm 34, male, and live in the US (Michigan).

*I strive to engage in genuine and thoughtful discussion.* I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire from and offer another. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. There's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests to what makes someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. Honestly striving to embrace and integrate the more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them, is an attractive ideal of mine. I want people who show up as their real, authentic, messy selves, with a gaze that's elevated towards something majestic.

*Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the material is essential for me.* I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive splendor. People who are genuinely weird and different are inherently interesting to me. I long for someone who can mirror me back, but sometimes a person with a wholly different perspective and axiom can see and mesh with you best. I peak with ideation and whimsy, desiring compatibility over a clone, and seek out others who do as well.

*Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.* I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. What does that mean? I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me, and I appreciate and admire many different types and expressions of it.* Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from chats to lengthy letters, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it as time goes on.

*More casual and practical hobbies of mine include incense, time pieces, archiving, organization, collecting, and coffee.* Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.

*I'm INTJ, Type 5, score very high in openness and conscientiousness, and am a Virgo.* I list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find most of these sorts of metrics and tests to be largely bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people and have since I was young. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? Are we capable of more in life from having met than never having crossed paths? Chat me up. Leave your hesitations and take the chance. Let me get to know you, from what within my ad resonated with you to what you're seeking, and a few basic details to initiate the start of a foundation. Dazzle me with your own signal, and let's see where the tides and winds take us.",1,1749511236.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve always been chunky, but things have been quite chaotic since our daughter was about 8 months old and I stopped breastfeeding. I‚Äôve been pretty depressed, gotten on birth control, stopped breastfeeding, and unfortunately, have gained 30 lbs since October. 

He has said something over the weekend that I‚Äôve put on weight and he‚Äôs noticed and I should really consider joining a gym. None of that is wrong, it just, hurt my feelings and makes me feel like I‚Äôm crawling in my own skin. I just feel really bad about myself now. I don‚Äôt want to sit around him, touch me, cuddle up, change in front of him, I just want to be left alone. Like, I just feel like he‚Äôs constantly staring at me.

He complains about the coffee I drink, while also bringing me a coffee yesterday morning. Talks about me gaining weight and then came home with 2 dozen donuts (that I didn‚Äôt eat). 

I started E2M last year and he picked at me because ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt healthy‚Äù and ‚ÄúI would succeed‚Äù. I have started drinking flavored waters (80 oz plain water and 40oz flavored) and he picks at that. I typically eat 1-2 meals a day based on the schedule- I‚Äôve never eaten breakfast. Like. I don‚Äôt just lay around on the couch all day and eat. I have 2 senior level management jobs (accounting) and kids that keep me busy 

My blood work is all normal, I haven‚Äôt changed my eating habits, I don‚Äôt smoke or drink alcohol, but I just don‚Äôt know how or why I‚Äôve put on weight so quickly when I‚Äôve been within the same 10 pounds for over a decade. Other than stress. 

On that note, how do I start other than the basics of less calories, more protein, no coffee, etc? How do I get out of this headspace of him making my skin crawl and feeling like he‚Äôs tempting me? I just don‚Äôt feel okay really.",78,1749510974.0,loseit,84,0.81,False

Im not trying to put on massive amounts of size, just trying to tone up a bit. I hit the gym 3 times a week, work an active job. So far I am consuming 

1 overnight oats and 2 hard boiled eggs for breakfast with black coffee.

1 banana and one apple as a snack during the day. 

For lunch and dinner I have the same. I'll usually have a protein shake at night as well.

2 Chicken Thigh bowls where the chicken is cooked in a spice rub, with roasted sweet potatoes, red kidney beans, carrots, broccoli and cauliflower.

My overnight oats have 40grams of rolled oats, 100ml of skim milk, 100g of plain 0 percent greek yogurt, 50 grams of frozen blueberries, 10g of chia seeds, 10 grams of wal nuts, one scoop of protein powder, and a splash of vanilla extract, cinnamon, salt and honey. 

Works out to around 415 cals with 44g of protein, 36 grams of carbs, and 12 grams of fat.

The chicken bowls each have around 735 calories, 61 grams of protein, 52 grams of carbs and 27 grams of fat.


This gives me a total of 
2025cals

178g of protein

141g of carbs

76gram of fat

i‚Äôm 20f and a few months ago i was having kind of a rough time. nothing super dramatic but just like emotionally kinda off. anyway i had this internship interview coming up and was out shopping for something to wear but everything i tried on looked weird or made me feel like a little kid pretending to be professional lol. so i‚Äôm in this store just staring at myself in the mirror and kinda spiraling tbh

then this girl (i think mid-late 20s?) saw me and was like ‚Äúneed help picking something?‚Äù and at first i thought she worked there but she didn‚Äôt. she was just waiting for someone and offered to help. i don‚Äôt know why but i said yes and she spent like 15-20 mins helping me look for stuff that actually looked good on me

she was super nice and funny and made me feel way more confident. we didn‚Äôt exchange contacts or anything tho, just first names i think?? idk it felt like one of those random wholesome moments that just‚Ä¶ happen

anyway, fast forward to like 2 weeks ago ‚Äî i saw her again randomly at a cafe near campus. we both recognized each other immediately and she was like ‚Äúhey! dress girl!‚Äù lol. we sat and talked for almost an hour and it was honestly so nice?? just really easy and she asked a lot of stuff about how the internship went (i got it btw!!)

now i‚Äôm stuck bc i keep thinking i want to ask her to hang out again but i‚Äôm scared it‚Äôll come off weird. like what if she was just being nice that day and doesn‚Äôt actually want to reconnect? or what if i‚Äôm overthinking the whole thing

idk should i message her and ask if she wants to grab coffee again or just leave it as a really sweet memory and not risk making it awkward?

I avoid the sun, wear SPF religiously, use tons of skincare every night, drink lots of water, work out, take vitamin D, eat Irish sea moss gel, have been taking collagen every night since I was 23, drink herbal teas like nettle, eat tons of antioxidants, zero carbs- haven‚Äôt touched bread in years, just those puffed rice ‚Äústyrofoam‚Äù crackers.

The problem is... this is my everything. So what about later? What happens when I‚Äôm old and wrinkled? I have so much confidence right now, I‚Äôm in uni, I chill, I enjoy life. But what‚Äôs the point if it‚Äôs all temporary? I see older women on the tram and honestly, it looks rough. I don‚Äôt want that fate. Please help.

I run a non-profit that raises awareness about grief. I want to make an impactful radio ad and/or video ad that runs along this premise:

  
**""Grief is often suffered in silence, but what does that silence sound like?""**

And then there'd be recordings of dozens of different voices saying single line statements that sum up the type of grief they're experiencing. 

Here are some examples:

""I still grab a second cup when I'm making my morning coffee.""  
""Their toothbrush is still in the cup, like they might come back.""  
""My body is here, but I don't recognize it anymore.""  
""They were supposed to keep me safe, but they never knew what was happening.""  
""We built a life together, and now I live in the ruins of it.""  
""I still sleep with the door cracked open, just in case they come home.""

They don't have to be your personal statements - I can provide the verbiage or you can use your own creativity. I just need voices that really capture emotion, and what better voices than those of poets, who weave feeling into even the simplest sentences.

The issue I‚Äôm having is that recently I‚Äôm working non stop and I catch him watching YouTube videos, working on stuff for his church, etc. or even taking like 2 to 3 coffee breaks and 2 to 3 bathroom trips at 10 minutes each plus a 20 minute lunch 

 I take a 25 minute lunch max bc there‚Äôs crap to do. 

It makes my blood boil bc I‚Äôm busting my ass while he has like 3 or max 4 calls a day, looks at an excel sheet and fakes all those breaks while spend time building stuff he enjoys bc owns the same equity as me.

1l7ja06,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l7ja06,Chase Sapphire Lounge Boston Food Round Up 6/9/2025,"Went to the Chase Sapphire Lounge at Logan Airport tonight before my plane left at 7pm. Showed up around 4:30 and had to wait about 30 minutes to get in. Line to get on the waitlist was long too but it moves quick.

Once you get the text confirming you can go in, check in goes fast and they checked my chase and priority pass card as well as my boarding pass.

Thought I‚Äôd add some pictures of all the food available to add another reference for this lounge location. Menu items you can order to your table were mostly burgers and sandwiches along with a sunbutter noodle vegan option and pozole. Drinks included bar options, coffee, tea, taps with sparkling water and cold brew plus a mini fridge with sprindrift, some electrolyte water cans, apple juice, coke, diet coke and sprite. 

My food stand outs tonight were the strawberry custard, smashed cucumber salad and the pesto shrimp pasta. The proscuitto sandwich and burgers were popular and they looked good but I‚Äôm pescatarian. Hope this helps other people who are at Logan a lot. ",12,1749510074.0,ChaseSapphire,7,1.0,False
