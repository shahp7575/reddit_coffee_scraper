1hz4knc,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1hz4knc/my_husband_and_i_have_issues_with_the_weekends/,My husband and I have issues with the weekends,"I‚Äôm a stay at home mom so on the weekends I just want to sleep in a couple extra hours (not sacrificing my husbands sleep.. he‚Äôs naturally up before our toddler when he sleeps in) and to not have to be the main parent.. I still help of course. 

Unfortunately it seems whenever I sleep in and try to be a bit more hands off than the weekdays the entire house falls apart which stresses us both out and I end up cleaning up on Monday. I got so sick of it I stopped trying to have my own weekend which of course ended in me just getting more and more tired/burnt out but everyone was happier for it. 

My husband keeps swearing it‚Äôs fine, sleep in, I‚Äôll take care of it, yet almost every weekend it‚Äôs not fine. This morning I slept in and when I got up I just wanted to make my coffee but I get in the kitchen and my daughters breakfast remnants are just left all over the kitchen so I have to either move shit, clean it up myself, or find space somewhere else, to make my coffee. Which I swear is a regular occurrence and not just with breakfast while my husband thinks it‚Äôs only once and awhile 

Literally the night before I was promised he would handle things so of course as soon as I get up and see him sitting on the couch playing with our daughter and the kitchen has her breakfast shit strewn across it I‚Äôm immediately disappointed and pissed off. While my husband acts like I‚Äôm being unreasonable.. that he was ‚Äúgoing to clean it up‚Äù.. ‚ÄúI have to before lunch anyway‚Äù.. ‚ÄúI want to enjoy my weekend too‚Äù This is how it goes almost literally every weekend I sleep in now. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong there have been improvements.. before if I slept in I‚Äôd get up everything would be a mess and everything other than breakfast would be left for me to do once I got up. I‚Äôd do my best to ignore the mess and stuff that I‚Äôd usually handle myself on weekdays which would inevitably end up with both of us stressed and getting upset over one thing or another.. like trying to manage making dinner in a cluttered kitchen.

Now he‚Äôs not just getting her breakfast but also brushing her teeth, getting her dressed, and brushing her hair. It‚Äôs just the little things like cleaning up after breakfast and managing clutter driving me bonkers. 
 
If I just stop expecting to have a weekend myself and wake up early everyone is so much happier including me but I get increasingly tired and burnt out. If I sleep in and hope my husband ‚Äúhandles things‚Äù we end up in bad moods almost as soon as I wake up.. if I sleep in and ignore I‚Äôm dealing with the stress by myself until later in the evening when my husband starts getting stressed too. It feels like a no win situation 

I guess my hope posting this here is that maybe a man‚Äôs prospective might see something I‚Äôm missing here.. or help me explain to my husband that there is a reason I do things the way I do on weekdays in a way that he understands? Also is it really that unusual for people to immediately clean up after a meal directly after that meal because my husband seems to think so ",1,1736626074.0,daddit,0,1.0,False

If ,"I 36F met 36M divorced with kid not staying with him on bumble. For the third date he invited me to his place. The place looked sketchy ( no furniture, no sofa) dirty small plastic chair. Broken TV remote. Broken Microwave glass door. Still he made efforts to cook for me ( tea, dinner proper meal coffee in the morning, and again breakfast and lunch). I crashed at his place in Night (some physical activities happened). In evening we went out for drinks followed by one his friends coming over for after parry. Next morning we had breakfast had lunch together and we didn‚Äôt do anything physical. We started watching some random movie and he was not sitting near me. I even asked him to come and sit near me he did for sometime and then he again was sitting far. I felt a drift and I asked if he has some plans he can let me know I will leave. He said no no He doesn‚Äôt have any plan. Also he told me u stay here tonight as well and u can leave tomorrow‚Äôs morning. I said Ok I will go little late then or may be tomorrow morning. But I got a call from my parents and I while I was talking to someone it looks like he was texting someone that time and the moment I hung up he said. I have to go to shopping I am gonna take a nap. Even u are feeling sleepy u go home I will come late night to yr place. I said Ok, but I had a feeling he isnt gonna see me the same night. While leaving he said it was nice having you here And hugged me. I left to my place. And he said text me when u reach. I texted reached and he liked. But as suspected in night he told me he is too tired to come and even if he will come he will doze off and he said if its ok he can come tomorrow instead. I felt bad but I called him to know whats going on? He said he is having a back pain (he was having an armpit painful cyst so that might be true) . But when I called him to discuss that I felt bit bored at his place in afternoon he was bit not prepared and he said he is occupied with many things so he isnt sure where are we going? Also he said its not a no and he said lets work on this. I am not sure whats going on his mind? Next night he came to my place and left in afternoon. We didnt talk much as he was sleeping entire time. And thats was frustrating to me. He sleeps 10-12 every day. I am a light sleeper and I sleep only 6-7 hours so 6 hours he is sleeping and I am up. I am not sure if he is a good match fir me but at the same time I dont know what is going on in his mind.",1,1736625132.0,Bumble,0,1.0,False

I purchased this Coffee Table secondhand 6 months back and was told it was Rosewood by the seller. One section of the tabletop came with minor bubbling and one ‚Äòmajor‚Äô crack (about 2.5 inch long and 1mm wide).There are also some minor chips on the edge of the tabletop veneer.¬†

Since then the tabletop has endured more light scratching, minor bubbling and and minor water stains (the outer circumference of the table top is brighter than the centre).

We run a home based daycare and have young toddlers bumping wood toys on this sucker all the time and the odd glob of drool ends up on it nearly daily. Despite regular wipe downs the table is getting worn down.

It‚Äôs a beautiful table and I‚Äôd like to refinish the top and the round edge. The underside and pedestal veneer seem to be in good condition. You‚Äôll see various photos of the table in different lighting to show the defects and how much better the underside veneer looks. Happy to share progress and final product photos of this project.¬†

I am brand new to any wood project so here is what I‚Äôm thinking and questions after some research I have done on the process:

1. Correct Bubbling

\- Cut into bubbling cracks with exacto blade to open veneer and release trapped air/moisture

\- Apply Damp towel and Iron on low heat to re-flatten veneer¬†

\* Is this step required or should I go straight to sanding ? I see this method appear on YouTube and Social Media DIYers but wonder if it‚Äôs the correct approach..

2. Sand Veneer to Expose Original Wood

\- if this is actually real Rosewood, I have read that rosewood veneer can be VERY delicate. You'll see photos of how thin veneer is.

\*Assuming I start with 150+ grit sandpaper and work up to around 220+ grit with an orbital sander on low and going very gently on the top to remove the current finish

3.Brighten Veneer to Even out Colour

\- Mix Oxalic Acid with warm water and apply to veneer with applicator pad

\* Allow to air dry OR wipe off?

\* What ratio of water:Oxalic Acid is recommended for veneers without overding it?

4. Fill Crack & Chips

\- Apply Stainable Wood filler into crack & chips and flatten with putty knife¬†

\* I have also read you can mix a stainable wood filler with stain BEFORE filling in cracks to assure the filler colour is appropriate. (I will try to match the pedestal finish but don‚Äôt expect a perfect match)

5. Apply Stain OR Oil

\- Apply Stain or Oil with Applicator pads

\* Which oil or stain is recommended? I have read Danish oil is not good rosewood. \* One or two coats and drying time between ?

6. Apply Lacquer OR Polyeurothane¬†

\- Apply Finish

\* Poly with spray can OR laqeur?

\* The goal is durability and a fairly nice look

\* How many coats are recommended for either and drying time

What are some DO‚Äôs/DON‚ÄôTs and pro tips to guide me on this journey.¬†

Would love opinions on process and specific tools and materials/brands to get this thing daycare proof and in its original beauty.¬†

I only own an orbital now but willing to purchase quality products for a quality and durable final outcome. Ideally would like to get this done over a long weekend but understand that may not be realistic with staining & finishing dry times.

I assume my shopping list looks like this:

\- Exacto Blade (bubble corrections)

\- Stainable Wood Filler¬†

\- Putty Knife (Wood Filler corrections)

\- Oxalic Acid (Brightening)

\- Applicator pads (Oxalic Acid & Stain/Oil)¬†

\- Stain OR Oil

\- Lacquer OR Polyurethane¬†

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

The job pays well and will assist with relocation, but the move to Texas is what is somewhat holding me back since I have no connections or support system there and would have to navigate everything on my own, which is likely doable but will be difficult. This would be my first job out of college so I'm thinking of taking it and saving up for a bit while applying to places closer to home. I think that moving to a new place on my own will be a good learning opportunity for me, especially at this stage of life. 

I would like some advice regarding this situation, I'm not sure if the move will be worth it. If I decide to take it, I have many questions about navigating things and the logistics there. I'm not sure if I should try to buy a used car in the area there since I will have to commute considering it's not a walkable area or if I should move my car here with me, which would be easier? I would like to live near my job to have a short commute on the weekdays since this would likely save on gas.  

My questions are:

1. What's a good area in Las Colinas or Irving to move to as a female in her early 20s with a budget of $1200 or under per month? I would prefer a furnished 1bd/1br or studio apartment so that I would not have to worry about buying new furniture and getting rid of it later if I move again. I also wouldn't mind having roommates either if there is a way to find any. 

2. Are there many young professionals in the area that I could connect with and possibly build new friendships there? 

3. Are there activities to do nearby on the weekends? I'm interested in creative activities, nature, coffee, museums, farmers markets, concerts, etc.

4. Is the area diverse in terms of ethnicity, religion, etc.? Specifically, is there a big Muslim community in or near this area?

5. Is it best to buy a used car there and handle registration and insurance there? Would this process be easier?

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1hz41ui,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hz41ui," **Looking to Trade: Wakuli Washed Agaro, Jimma, Ethiopia (Light Roast)** ","Hi everyone! I hope this post is okay‚Äîif I broke any rules or chose the wrong flair, feel free to let me know.  

Yesterday, I received my monthly 350g light roast from my Wakuli subscription, and to my surprise, it‚Äôs the same coffee I got back in December: a washed Agaro from Jimma, Ethiopia.  

### Tasting Notes:
- **Jasmine, apricot, & gummy bears**  
- The jasmine note is particularly strong and prominent in this one.  

### Brew Observations:  
I had great results with these beans using a mixed percolation/immersion method on the Switch at ~95¬∞C:  

- **1:13 ratio**: Florality is prominent, rounded out by gummy bear sweetness and mellow acidity.  
- **1:16 ratio**: Becomes tangier as it cools, with lingering sweetness in the aftertaste.  

Regardless of the ratio, the body feels medium rather than light, I sticked around 10 and 14 clicks on my Timemore C3Pro. Mouthfeel can get a little sticky, but note distinction remains clear. If you‚Äôre aiming for a lighter cup, experimenting with higher ratios (1:17‚Äì1:18) and slightly lower temps might help.  

### Why I‚Äôm Trading:
This is my third consecutive month brewing mostly washed coffees, and while I appreciate their clean cups and subtle notes, I find myself craving the juiciness and funkiness of natural, honey, or anaerobic processes.  

Right now, I‚Äôve got a natural Ethiopia Sidamo and a washed Rwanda Gwiza in rotation, and I‚Äôd love to trade this sealed bag for something natural or anaerobic roasted recently.  

### About the Coffee:
- **Origin:** Agaro, Jimma, Ethiopia  
- **Process:** Washed  
- **Roast Date:** End of December (visible in pics)  
- **Package:** Unopened and sealed  
- **Location:** Europe (prefer EU-based trades to keep shipping reasonable)  

The roast is uniform and regular light (not ultra-light), so the beans don‚Äôt need an extra-long rest period. In my previous lot (pic included), quakers and defects were sparse, and the coffee brewed clean.  

### Let‚Äôs Trade!  
If you‚Äôre in a similar position‚Äîholding onto freshly roasted beans you‚Äôre not fully in love with‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to hear from you. I‚Äôm open to anything light-roasted, especially naturals or anaerobics.  

Thanks for reading! Let me know if you‚Äôre interested.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

**Here‚Äôs a bit about me:**

- üåé **Resilient adventurer:** Resilient is my middle name (not literally‚Äîmy parents aren‚Äôt that weird). I‚Äôve fought through life‚Äôs metaphorical mud and even hopped across the globe a few times.
Humor is my coping mechanism, so expect a steady stream of playful sarcasm, dad jokes, and the occasional clever pun.

**What I‚Äôm looking for:**

- **Someone also navigating the labyrinth of computer science‚Äî**whether you're taking online classes or just diving into it for fun.
- **A fellow night owl** who doesn‚Äôt mind burning the midnight oil (or at least the 10 PM‚Äì2 AM oil).
- **Patience, humor, and camaraderie‚Äî**someone who‚Äôs cool with commiserating over our collective lack of sleep.

So, this morning, my reactive rescue dog and I went to our usual coffee shop, where we've been multiple times before. Unfortunately, today, when my dog noticed another dog walking outside, he barked for maybe less than a minute (he‚Äôs reactive and gets scared in certain situations). An employee then asked me to tie him outside because ‚Äúpeople were getting uncomfortable.‚Äù

I immediately said I‚Äôd never tie my dog outside in NYC (especially given his reactive nature), and stormed out. I understand there might be discomfort, but I also feel like their request was a bit unreasonable, considering my dog is scared and reacts to things outside his control. I was thinking‚Äîif it had been a kid screaming or being loud, would the response have been the same? 

I guess I‚Äôm just wondering: how should I handle situations like this in public spaces? Are there more effective ways to work with my dog‚Äôs reactivity in places like this without making others uncomfortable? And honestly, what‚Äôs the right balance between being considerate of other customers while also ensuring my dog‚Äôs needs are respected?

It lasted 3 years, 2 of which we lived together. It ended a long time ago, but I still have a lot of trauma from the abuse of that relationship that I‚Äôm still processing to this day. 

My best friend was diagnosed with BPD, and reading up on it to learn more about her, I saw a ton of my ex in the things I was reading.

Hyper-sexuality: he needed sex all of the time, and would get angry and threatening if I turned him down. He also pushed a lot of my sexual boundaries, resulting in most of our sex being coercive in some form. He particularly liked things that were degrading and dehumanizing to me. 

Lack of sense of self: the way that he didn‚Äôt know what he wanted to do with his life or who he was seemed so much more intense than your typical early 20‚Äôs guy. He was whoever was around him. He didn‚Äôt have favourite music, favourite movies or interests that lasted and were truly his. He liked the things I liked. He latched on to people he‚Äôd meet to a somewhat obsessive degree and start trying to emulate them - it looked like self discovery and spiritual curiosity at first, but it was desperate, and every interest or person he chose to replicate was fleeting. 

Neediness: he wasn‚Äôt just needy with me, he was needy with people in general, mostly women. He was insanely jealous of me and would start HUGE fights with horrible accusations over something like me going to a concert without him, or having coffee with a female friend. He ‚Äúcollected‚Äù women to an extent: exes he remained friends with, mostly women who he‚Äôd befriend and build these intense relationships with who were vulnerable in some way (like a new immigrant, a single mom, a newly divorced women). I was one of them, he pursued me because I‚Äôd moved for college to a new country where I didn‚Äôt know anyone. He was terrified of me cheating on him or outgrowing him, but he was cheating on me.

Darkness/emptiness: it sounds so cringy looking back on it, but he kind of identified strongly with Batman. Something about having this darkness inside him and being misunderstood. He often talked about how he felt like there was something ‚Äúevil‚Äù in him that he was always ‚Äúfighting‚Äù - it wasn‚Äôt sadness or pain, it was like something dark and foreign. I think he truly believed he was possessed by something. 

 Splitting: he was really hot and cold with people. My friends were the coolest people he‚Äôd ever met until someone looked at him the wrong way. His roommate was the funniest guy and he loved him until he was asked to do his own dishes. He would get SO ANGRY and aggressive with people over nothing. It got him in a lot of trouble, including being kicked out a house after he left a very threatening voicemail on his roommates phone. My friends hated him and eventually he hated them back. He split on me, too. My biggest shame is that I didn‚Äôt end the relationship, he did. And he did it suddenly and coldly. 

In general he was a deeply paranoid person who didn‚Äôt have a strong touch with reality. He could get lost in conspiracy theories like alien abductions (he thought he‚Äôd been abducted by aliens as a kid). While he was never physically violent with me, he was horribly emotionally and sexually abusive. He‚Äôd throw things, he‚Äôd wake me up to fight or keep me awake fighting until dawn, he tried to isolate me from friends, and he‚Äôd ‚Äúact out‚Äù when I wasn‚Äôt giving him my full attention by doing things like getting extremely drunk and aggressive at parties, hurting himself in front of me, destroying my things, and picking fights to prevent me from leaving the house to go to class or work. 

That‚Äôs not really everything, and I‚Äôm not too sure what my point is in posting this. Maybe just to get some answers and see if this resonates with people who have lived with and loved people with BPD. ",1,1736624338.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

It involves eating half a grapefruit (or drinking grapefruit juice) before each meal, along with a small serving of protein (like eggs, chicken, or bacon) and vegetables. Some versions also include black coffee and water. While it has gained popularity in the past due to its association with Hollywood stars, it comes with its drawbacks. The diet severely limits your food choices, cutting out most fruits, grains, and snacks, and it offers a very low-calorie intake (often as low as 800 calories per day), which can slow metabolism and lead to nutrient deficiencies.

Although grapefruit is packed with health benefits (hydration, vitamin C, potassium), it doesn‚Äôt provide all the nutrients your body needs. Rapid weight loss from such a restrictive diet typically results in water and muscle loss rather than fat loss, and the weight often returns once normal eating resumes.

For sustainable weight loss, a balanced, healthy diet focusing on whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables is more effective. The grapefruit diet might give you a short-term weight drop, but it‚Äôs not a long-term solution. Instead of going on extreme diets, aim for a calorie deficit with nutrient-rich foods, and aim for gradual, healthy weight loss.

1hz3t9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hz3t9j/aita_for_going_low_contact_with_mil/,AITA for going low contact with MIL?,"Hello.

Long term reader but I've never posted before. But I need Reddits advice here.

My father dies in 2017. My mother divorced him for her cheating partner. I have an amicable relationship with my mom but I was close with my father and I can't really forgive my mother for what she did to him. I was going to ghost her but my father made me not do it. This is not really what I want to ask but it's relevant.

My long term girlfriends parents stepped in. Her father advised me on life decisions and was always there for us. So was her mother, but in retrospect it's probably due to her father.

My FIL died 2 years ago. After he dies we tried to include MIL so she wouldn't feel lonely. 1-2 months after FILs death me, my wife and MIL went on vacation. One thing that stood out was that MIL was flirting with some guy. Basically the first guy she could find.

2-3 months after FIL died, MIL started to spend time with a new guy. My wife didn't really like it but what can we do, right?

The new guy is my MILs brothers wife's brother. So she's known him for years. They're now a couple. Not sure when that happened but probably 3-4 months after FIL passed away. To me, it seems my MIL is unable to be alone and needs a man in her life.

Now to the question...

My MIL and her new guy spent Christmas with us. When my MIL and FIL was at our house we always tried to make them feel at home. They would get things from the fridge, make coffee or do whatever they wanted when they were at our house. To me, this has been something positive and I'm happy they felt at home at our house.

Last Christmas my MIL and her new guy stayed at our house. MIL likes to have afternoon coffee, which we don't normally have, and so when she wanted her afternoon coffee she'd ask us if anyone wanted coffee and then she'd make coffee.

On Christmas eve she would ask us if we wanted to have our Christmas dinner and when we said yes, she started to take things out from the fridge. To me, this was normal and in line with what she'd do the past 50 times she spent at our house. But this time, I guess this was a problem.

MIL and her new guy, left a few day early and then she didn't call my wife for a few weeks. To put things in retrospect, they'd talk every day for the past 30 years. When my wife finally called, my MIL said she needed time to digest because her stay with us was a chock and a new experience to her.

Apparently, the new guy told her that it's weird how she had to take initiative, and how she would initiate things at our house. Now MIL is deeply hurt about this and she doesn't know how she can come here again.

I don't want to influence my wife too much, as it's her.mother, but my response is basically that they can go fuck themselves. If someone comes to my house and starts making coffee or taking things out of fridge, it's me that could be upset. Not them. If my MIL feels at home at my house it's a good thing. But I guess I should have stopped her? 

Seems toe she's influenced by her.new man. She is a weak person who needs someone to guide her in life. When her husband of 40 years died, she jumped on the first best guy she could find. When he didn't like how things worked at our house, she automatically agrees with him even though she's the one acting in a certain way.

I'm not sure what to advice my wife. My wife is sad about the situation as her mother is all the family she's got. But I'm thinking she should go low contact with her.mother and not invite her for future holidays.

On a side note my MIL is always the victim. If we don't invite her we will be the bad guys. She'll be the victim for being alone on a holiday. Or maybe that's what she wants with her new guy.

I don't know if I'm explaining this right. But I want to know how if I'm the AH for asking my wife to go.low contact with her mom? Any advice is appreciated.",4,1736624066.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Recently, I had to call 911 for my dad after he apparently overdosed on supplements trying to avoid the flu. He became incoherent, had slurred speech, couldn't walk, was vomiting uncontrollably, and had a severe headache. At the hospital, they gave him IV fluids and found low potassium (according to him - I don't have the full medical report as he refused further testing, claiming the hospital was ""trying to inject him with stuff"").

Now he's showing me results from a ""Healing Arts Clinic"" claiming he has high metal levels - but this was from a provoked urine test, which is known to artificially inflate results. Based on these questionable results, they've scheduled him for chelation IV therapy TWICE A WEEK indefinitely. From my research, chelation is only legitimate for actual metal poisoning, and even then is never done this frequently.

I'm genuinely terrified he's going to seriously harm himself. He's also doing coffee enemas, ""detox baths,"" and taking unknown combinations of supplements. He only surrounds himself with people who share his beliefs and won't listen to any concerns about these dangerous treatments.

Has anyone dealt with something similar? How do you help someone who's being exploited by alternative medicine practitioners and refuses to listen to anyone else? ",6,1736623957.0,QAnonCasualties,4,1.0,False

My first meeting, an old-timer criticized basically everything I did in the meeting. He said I hadn‚Äôt made enough coffee and brewed more himself (which broke our group conscience rules and left us with a completely full pot that went to waste at the end of the meeting). He passed our 7th Tradition basket himself because he thought I was waiting too late in the meeting to do it myself (we aren‚Äôt supposed to pass the basket until after the chair finishes sharing). And he basically implied that I shouldn‚Äôt be a secretary at this meeting hall because he had never seen me at a meeting there before (despite the fact that I had in fact met him several times before at that exact meeting hall, and he apparently just didn‚Äôt remember.)

My second meeting, two other old-timers were having their own conversation in the back corner of the room the entire meeting. I wanted to ask them to step outside, but I was nervous I‚Äôd get pounced on by them because of their ‚Äústatus‚Äù in this group. Then, during the open share time, the topic was Change, so I shared [this prayer] (https://www.ignatianspirituality.com/prayer-of-theilhard-de-chardin/) that I read a lot in rehab and I felt had pretty universal appeal for a spiritual program. One of those chatty old-timers suddenly started shouting me down in front of the whole group, then spent 30 minutes after the meeting harping on me about how the 10th Tradition forbids any non-AA literature from being shared in a meeting (which is not part of our meeting‚Äôs bylaw; it‚Äôs just his opinion). He said that talking about religion will scare off the newcomer and start arguments, which is ironic, because no one argued with me except for him, and as someone who is still somewhat of a newcomer, his anger scared me off more than any of the individuals who mentioned Jesus in their share that night.

I‚Äôve really been enjoying AA. I hit meetings every day, I‚Äôm working on the steps with a sponsor, and I‚Äôm getting into service. I know these experiences aren‚Äôt indicative of AA as a whole, but they‚Äôre really bumming me out and making me feel like maybe I should back off.

1hz3in9,https://www.reddit.com/r/blur/comments/1hz3in9/i_became_a_fan_of_blur_a_couple_months_ago_and/,I became a fan of Blur a couple months ago and just finished listening to every album. Here are my thoughts.,"A few months ago, I began to venture into Blur. I made a whole post about it here, you can go check it out. I had long been a fan of Gorillaz, and was familiar with blur, but I hadn't gotten into them properly. Inspired by my then-girlfriend getting me into 'Beetlebum', I really began developing an interest in them. And since then, I went through their albums in an order that one person on here said would be best if I had found Blur through 'Beetlebum'. Here's a documentation on how, over the past two and a half months, Blur have become one of my favorite bands and have gotten me through some tough times. It's going to be a long one, with some personal anecdotes in there as well, I sincerely hope you all don't mind.

'Blur' & '13'
‚Ä¢ I listened to each album on walks home from school. They typically take me an hour and ten minutes and are great for clearing my mind, listening to music, sitting with my thoughts. The first album I listened to was the self-titled album, sometime in early November. Other than the aforementioned ""Beetlebum"", I wasn't really sure what to expect. But, in the end, listening to this album was probably the best first album listening experience I've ever had and this album has become one of my favorites ever. The opening stretch from ""Beetlebum"" up until ""Theme from Retro"" was very energetic and exciting for me and the back-half was much more relaxed. Highlights here for me were: ""Beetlebum"", ""Song 2"", ""M.O.R."", ""Theme From Retro"", ""Death of a Party"" and ""Strange News from Another Star"", although I really enjoyed every song on here. It set my hopes up high for the rest of Blur's discography and instantly had me permanently hooked on them.

‚Ä¢ '13' followed the next Monday. Blur was a very high energy, high excitement type of record, and for me, 13 was kind of like that as well as insanely depressing. It's the most musically interesting record I've ever heard in my life, it's very unconventional but I really enjoyed it. ""Coffee & TV"", a song that I enjoyed at first but didn't think much else of, has now become one of my favorite songs and I related deeply to the message Graham expresses through the lyrics later on. I really enjoyed songs like ""Bugman"", for example, where the guitars are really loud and noisy and create kind of a white noise. ""No Distance Left to Run"" really struck me at that time and especially now. Going back to the girlfriend who had gotten me into Blur, at this point we were now amicably separated for the time being so she could ""work on herself"", which she attributed to her many mental problems making her unfit for a relationship but said we could try again whenever she set herself straight. She got ""grounded"", and communication between us decreased a lot. And despite her reassurances, I really began having my doubts on whether or not she was being truthful to me or not. That song resonated with me at a time where I was really beginning to ask myself if preparing myself for a life that she wasn't in was something I would have to start doing. Highlights from this album for me were: ""Tender"", ""Bugman"", ""Coffee & TV"", ""Mellow Song"", ""Trimm Trabb"", ""No Distance Left to Run"".

Life Trilogy/Britpop Trilogy
‚Ä¢ I then pivoted back to the Life Trilogy, beginning with 'Modern Life is Rubbish'. I went into this one expecting nothing from the two albums I had listened to previously and instead prepared myself for a fun, enjoyable pop record. That's exactly what I got with Modern Life. It appears to be the least critically acclaimed out of three, but it's my favorite of the three. I'm not sure if that's a hot take, I haven't been in the Blur fandom long enough. Highlights here were: ""For Tomorrow"", ""Advert"", ""Pressure on Julian"", ""Villa Rosie"" and ""Resigned"".

‚Ä¢ Next, 'Parklife'. I thought 'Parklife' was a good record that had good songs, but for some reason, it mostly didn't hit me like the other three I listened to before had. The opening five songs are really good, but the middle-to-end half of the record doesn't stick out that much in my memory. I feel a re-listen to this record would help improve my opinion on it, but for now, it's just pretty good. Highlights were: ""Girls & Boys"", ""Tracy Jacks"", ""End of a Century"", ""Parklife"", ""Bank Holiday"", ""Magic America"" and ""This Is a Low"". My expectations might've been too high considering I had read how this is received as blur's best album. Again, maybe my opinion will change drastically on a re-listen, I already like this album anyway so maybe I'll really get into it next listen.

‚Ä¢ 'The Great Escape' is definitely a fitting conclusion to the trilogy as it feels like the culmination of everything they were building over the last two records. Very poppy, very funny too, it is every element of that Britpop trilogy pushed as far as it could go. And while I think it is good, I don't think it's great. There's a few tracks here that I personally didn't really resonate or connect with at all. I didn't like ""Fade Away"", ""Top Man"", ""Ernold Same"" or ""Yuko and Hiro"" really that much and at times, it kind of killed the energy for me. But, overall, I do have a mostly positive opinion of this record since the good outweighs the bad. Highlights: ""Stereotypes"", Country House"", ""Best Days"", ""It Could Be You"", ""Globe Alone"", ""Dan Abnormal"" and ""Entertain Me"". Not-so-fun fact, almost got ran over while listening to this record. Ironically, during ""Best Days"". Wouldn't have been one of my best days.

The Ballad of Darren, Leisure, Think Tank and The Magic Whip
‚Ä¢ After following someone's advice to start with 'Blur' and '13', then go through to the Britpop Trilogy, I was now left to pick whatever I wanted really with the remaining albums. So, for no real reason in particular, I picked 'The Ballad of Darren' first. By this point, it is now December and I was now in no contact with my now-ex after discovering she was actually back in a relationship with an ex. When I confronted her about it, she explained it was a 'white lie' and needless to say there wasn't much more communication before I decided I needed to cut her off. Didn't want to, but I had no choice. In the aftermath, I was heartbroken and dealing with a lot of insecurities, the usual when you've just gone through your first break-up. 'The Ballad of Darren' really resonated with me. It's not strictly a break-up album, but there is a lot of songs dealing with that kind of topic. It made me cry. It really helped me in a time I needed it. It's my favorite Blur record, that might be a hot take too but it is. Highlights here are: ""St. Charles Square"", ""Barbaric"", ""Russian Strings"", ""The Narcissist"" and ""The Heights"". Every track is amazing though. I don't mean to get so personal and all sob-story, and I'm sorry if that's annoying to some of you, but I feel that where I am in my life gives some context to how deeply I relate to some of these songs and albums, this album especially. I'd go into more depth but we'd get too off-topic, and plus this isn't therapy, this isn't the time or the place for me to do so.

‚Ä¢ Then, I listened to 'Leisure'. This album is a very strong one, I really enjoyed a lot of the songs. I don't have too, too much to say about it, but trust me, I do think it's really good and very consistent throughout. Highlights: ""Bang"", ""Repetition"", ""There's No Other Way"", ""Come Together"", ""Wear Me Down"". 

‚Ä¢ 'Think Tank' was an interesting one to go into. I was very mixed---I was worried that Graham Coxon's absence would hurt the album, as his guitar playing had become one of my favorite things about Blur. But I was also excited to hear the different stylings Blur would go for on this record. I had often heard 'Think Tank' was a Gorillaz record in all but name, and as someone who was a Gorillaz fan before I became a Blur fan, to hear those two kind of converge musically was exciting. I knew that I shouldn't expect anything Gorillaz-reminscent from any other Blur albums and I wasn't. But here, I did. It definitely feels kind of Gorillaz-adjacent but with its own unique Blur vibe to it. There's several songs where it sounds less like Damon and more like 2D, don't ask me how I know the difference, I just do. I really loved this record. I think the other three really make up for Graham's loss and create a great record in spite of that. Highlights here for me were: ""Out of Time"", ""Good Song"", ""Brothers and Sisters"", ""Moroccan Peoples Revolutionary Bowls Club"" and ""Sweet Song"".

‚Ä¢ Finally, 'The Magic Whip'. I listened to this one yesterday, and I thought it was a fun record. I went into this one expecting a much more subdued, kind of sad album since I've heard this record be compared to other Albarn projects, like Gorillaz record 'The Now Now'. It is kind of like that. All the songs here are good, but I wouldn't say there's any that really jump out at me as being particularly great, or standing above the rest. All of the album's songs really blend nicely together, not to say they're all the same or anything negative but they all compliment each other real well and occupy their own space without outshining one another. It's hard to pick highlights for that reason, but I'll go with these: ""New World Towers"", ""Thought I Was a Spaceman"", ""My Terracotta Heart"", ""Ghost Ship"", ""Pyongyang"" and ""Mirrorball"".

So, there it is. I can't put into words how perfect the timing of me getting into Blur was. The deep connection I felt with their music was probably something that I only could've truly felt by getting into them at the time I did, and for that, I'll be a fan forever. Nine albums, all really good in their own way and having some of my favorite songs ever. I've began collecting Blur records already---'The Ballad of Darren' and 'Live at Wembley Stadium' and more in the future. That's pretty much all I've got to say to wrap this up. I hope this post takes all of you back to when you first got into Blur and it reminds you of the magic that comes from discovering music. ",7,1736623276.0,blur,0,1.0,False

# Welcome to the Future of AI-Assisted Research

Remember the days when research meant endless hours in the library, surrounded by stacks of books and papers? Well, those days are long gone. Google's NotebookLM is changing the game, and it just got a whole lot better.

NotebookLM is Google's AI-powered research assistant. It's been helping people study smarter and make decisions faster for a while now. But Google just rolled out some cool new features that make it even more useful and fun to use.

In this article, we're going to dive into these new features and see how they can help you in your work or studies. We'll look at the new design, the interactive audio feature, and the new premium version. By the end, you'll have a good idea of how NotebookLM can make your research easier and more interesting.



# How NotebookLM Has Grown

# From Idea to Reality

NotebookLM didn't just appear out of thin air. It's the result of years of work by Google's team. They saw how AI was changing the way we do things and thought, ""Hey, why not use this for research?""

The idea was simple: create a tool that could understand and analyze large amounts of information, just like a human researcher would. But it needed to do it faster and without getting tired.

# Why AI in Research Matters

You might be wondering, ""Why do we need AI for research anyway?"" Well, think about how much information is out there. It's way more than any one person can handle. AI can process all this info quickly and find connections we might miss.

Plus, AI doesn't get bored or distracted. It can work through tons of data without needing a coffee break. This means you can get more done in less time.

# Out with the Old, In with the New

Remember how research used to be? Flipping through books, scribbling notes, trying to remember where you read that one important fact? NotebookLM changes all that.

Now, you can upload your sources, ask questions, and get answers right away. It's like having a super-smart research assistant who's always ready to help. And with these new updates, it's gotten even better at understanding what you need.

# The New Look of NotebookLM

https://i.redd.it/1qit77h5zece1.gif

# A Fresh Face for Easier Use

Google gave NotebookLM a makeover, and it's not just about looking pretty. The new design makes it easier to use and more efficient. It's all about helping you focus on what's important: your research.

# Three Parts, One Smooth Experience

The new interface has three main parts:

1. Sources Panel: This is where you keep all your important info. It's like your digital filing cabinet.
2. Chat Panel: Here, you can talk to the AI. Ask questions, get answers, and see where the information comes from.
3. Studio Panel: This is where the magic happens. You can create new content based on your sources with just a click.

The cool thing is, these parts work together seamlessly. You can jump from reading a source to asking a question to creating a summary, all without missing a beat.

# Why This New Design Rocks

The new layout isn't just for show. It's designed to make your work easier. Here's how:

* Everything in One Place: No more switching between different apps or windows. It's all right there.
* Flexible Layout: You can adjust the panels based on what you're doing. Taking notes? Expand the source viewer and notes editor side by side.
* Smooth Transitions: Move from research to writing to creating audio summaries without breaking your flow.

Google's team put a lot of thought into this design. They wanted to make sure you could focus on your work without the tool getting in the way.

# Talk to Your Audio Overviews

# From Listening to Conversing

One of the coolest new features is the interactive Audio Overviews. Before, you could listen to summaries of your research. Now, you can actually talk to them.

Imagine listening to a podcast about your research topic. But instead of just listening, you can jump in and ask questions. That's what this new feature lets you do.

# How It Works

Here's how you can use this new feature:

1. Create a new Audio Overview.
2. Turn on the Interactive mode (it's still in beta, so it might have some quirks).
3. Start listening.
4. When you want to ask something, tap ""Join.""
5. One of the AI hosts will call on you, and you can ask your question.

It's like having a study buddy who knows everything about your topic and is always ready to explain things.



# Why This is a Game-Changer

This feature takes learning to a new level. Here's why it's so great:

* Personalized Learning: You can ask about the parts you don't understand and get explanations that make sense to you.
* Active Engagement: Instead of passively listening, you're part of the conversation. This helps you remember more.
* Flexible Understanding: If one explanation doesn't click, you can ask for it to be explained differently.

It's worth noting that this feature is still experimental. The AI hosts might pause awkwardly sometimes or occasionally get things wrong. But Google is working on making it better all the time.

# NotebookLM Plus: For When You Need More

# Supercharging Your Research

For those who really dive deep into their research, Google introduced NotebookLM Plus. It's like NotebookLM, but with superpowers.

* Power Users: If you're constantly pushing the limits of what NotebookLM can do, this is for you.
* Teams: Great for group projects or research teams who need to collaborate.
* Organizations: Businesses and schools can use it to boost their research capabilities.

# How to Get It

You can get NotebookLM Plus through Google Workspace or Google Cloud. And starting in early 2025, it'll be part of Google One AI Premium.

You know that feeling when you start a side project and tell yourself ""2-3 months max""? Well, 9 months and countless coffee-fueled weekends later, I'm excited to announce that Atomin, my habit tracking app, is finally live! üéâ

My wife (who's a designer) looked at my initial UI mockup and said ""Oh honey... no."" So she redesigned everything, giving me what she calls ""fun little design challenges"" - which is designer-speak for ""make this pixel-perfect or sleep on the couch.""

**What's Atomin?**

* A beautifully crafted habit tracker inspired by atomic habits
* Features a fancy calendar UI that my wife designed and I spent way too many hours implementing
* Tracks your habits with beautiful visualizations
* Sends push notifications (that actually work, which felt like a bigger achievement than my college degree)
* Lets you share your achievements (because if a habit streak isn't shared, did it really happen?)

**Tech Stack:**

* Flutter (obviously üòÑ)
* Riverpod + Hooks for state management
* Internationalization
* [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) for backend
* Lots of tears and Stack Overflow visits

The real MVP feature? It actually ships with working dark mode! üåô

**The Indie Dev Journey:** Between my full-time job, family life, and this project, I've learned that:

1. ""I'll work on it this weekend"" means ""I'll stare at the code for 20 minutes then take a nap""
2. Git commits at 3 AM are never a good idea
3. The hardest bug to fix is always in the ""simple feature that will take 5 minutes""

But hey, we made it! Would love for you all to check it out and share your feedback. Every download makes those 9 months worth it (and helps justify all those times I told my wife ""I'm almost done, just one more feature!"")

1hz3b1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1hz3b1f/kaithleen/,Kaithleen,"I woke up again with a dream of us. We were on a crowded ferry somewhere. I woke up and was thinking where it could be. Probably Seattle. We were standing next to each other and then we saw a coffee machine with 4 self serve flavors. Mocha, espresso, americano, and one more that didn‚Äôt really pop stand out. You looked over at it and saw it and then looked over at me, looking up at me and asking me ever so gently if I wanted some. 
So you decided to get some for us. While you are walking there I stay and reserve our little area because it‚Äôs so crowded. I keep looking over at you and thinking how blessed I am to have you in my life. While you are pouring the coffee I am looking at you and hoping you look back with a smile, that you feel what I am feeling in this moment in my stomach. This warmth. You do, you looking back at me. You‚Äôre so sweet beautiful and charming. I can‚Äôt get enough. As you are done getting the coffee and are walking back I can‚Äôt get enough of you and am eagerly waiting and bursting with excitement inside, but I never show it, at least I try not to, but I hope a little bit of it escapes so you know how much I love you. You come back and I ask what you got in the tiny little coffee cups. The cups are brown little paper cups that look like they are for coffee but they are smaller, almost shot sized. You say you got Mocha chip for yourself and espresso for me because you know how much I like espresso. I take the espresso and sip it. ‚Äúit‚Äôs not very good‚Äù I say jokingly. While you are sipping yours so cutely you look happy and satisfied, so I ask if I can get a sip of yours. You hand me the cup cutely. I take a sip and it‚Äôs sweet and mocha-ey. Exactly what you would expect from mocha chip.
‚Äùhmm this one is definitely better, I see why you always get it.‚Äù I look at you. You look at me. Only 2cm apart. I hug you and put my head over your left shoulder. I bring you closer to me. I hug you an overwhelming happiness that isn‚Äôt fully realized comes over me as I realize that this just a dream, and then sadness. I wake up from the pain and sadness, anger, and all that I am. That I am not this person in the dream. The person in the dream isn‚Äôt bitter at reality. He is happy he has you to hold. The reason I lost you. Is because I am me.  I am sorry. I always loved you. In my heart you were always there, at parties you were all I can think about and all I wanted was to run away with you in a room and kiss you and hold you tight. I wanted to steal constant glances at you from across the room and I wanted us to be romantic and cute. I was just insecure and immature and didn‚Äôt know that other peoples opinions of us didn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm sorry for getting in the way of our happiness. I‚Äôm sorry for being our worst enemy.

My whole life I experienced rejection. Rejection from friend groups, rejection from my brother, rejection from my Dad and my mother. It‚Äôs all that‚Äôs on my mind at times. Being rejected in love. Being rejected for being me, and for not knowing who to be. Being so afraid of rejection that most times I didn‚Äôt even try. But for some reason I really wanted to try with you. I didn‚Äôt try in the past. I never asked someone out that I was so sure I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. Because that person never came, but then I met you. I was still so scared to ask you out. Because what if I got rejected? I know you feel (Felt?) guilty about this but please never feel guilty for being honest towards your feelings. Don‚Äôt. You deserve to be selfish. Especially now. After everything. I wanted you to be selfish in our relationship, but not completely selfish. When I said selfish I mean the kind of selfishness that shows love because it‚Äôs also self serving. You love me and it makes you happy. That‚Äôs selfish. I wanted to fill the selfishness to the max. No matter how much pain it‚Äôs causing me and how many times I cry, deep down I know I will be happy if you are happy. Even if it will be accompanied by tears. I feel stupid writing this to you. Afterall you said no contact. And maybe the greatest love is in letting you go, but I know I wouldn‚Äôt forgive myself if I didn‚Äôt try. Last time you told me how much you wished I did. i regretted it everyday, every fiber of my being wishes I tried a little harder last time after being rejected. I don‚Äôt want to make the same mistake twice. But how can I when every night I go to sleep and every night you haunt my dreams? I don‚Äôt want you in there. Yet every morning I wake up with tears in my eyes because my dreams are not real. I realized too late what real love is. You‚Äôre right it‚Äôs unconditional. My love for you has been unconditional, always. I just said what I said that night because I was trying to not be your punching bag after you told me you wanted to break up, I still tried to stay calm no matter how much I wanted to explode, even after you told me that you are into girls, you weren‚Äôt showing me love. I was just waiting and waiting for you. The stonewalling and silent treatment hurt me sooo sooo much. I hated it. I just wish you knew how much I wanted you in those moments. I never fell out of love for you and I was just hoping you would see how much you miss me if I wasn‚Äôt always the one trying to swallow my pride and get you to talk, when I didn‚Äôt really know what I did wrong. I‚Äôm sorry for having blind spots. I think I am definitely more sensitive to your feelings now. I love you so much I want to take care of you and make sure nothing ever hurts you again. Not me, not the world, not your work place. And if it does I want to be the one to make it all better. 

It‚Äôs not fair how you bought me protein shakes and called me asking to come over. You made me so happy. I was shocked, happy and sad. I missed you so much. Not sure if this is real. I wanted to play it cool like I always do, but that was wrong. When you called me I wanted to breakdown in tears begging you to come back and never leave me. I always struggled with being my most vulnerable. The night ended terribly too with the whole tow truck situation. Then next thing I know I am blocked when I wish you a merry Christmas and ask how you would like your bike back? You can be so cold sometimes. So so cold. Yet. I still love you, hoping that one day you show some warmth and the coldness melts away. Please come back to me. ",1,1736622716.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

*I knew the clock was mocking me. The way it ticked by so slowly, the twisted brass hands moving yet portraying no change. The constant tick-tick-tick seemed like mocking laughter, at how I didn‚Äôt have enough time despite everything.*

*But the clock was alone in this affair; far from it. The aging bulbs overhead buzzed and sputtered every so often, their hum harmonizing into an arpeggio of dissonance. Paired with the clock, my situation seemed all the more dire.*

*That was not even mentioning the chair upon which I sat. Woe, woe I say! The ancient thing was rusted around just so; every position I tried only offered grating screeches in reply. Its seat was battered from years of use, with several fasteners missing from their positions. One would think that at least one patient would have complained but lo, it seemed this office only served disguised masochists and the insane.*

*What should I have expected though? Even after first contact, our new ‚Äòpartners‚Äô seemed all too eager to not change a thing. Just journey across the stars for an undisclosed amount of time and declare yourselves stewards and protectors, only to withhold many of the things you promised.

‚ÄúMr. Bradshaw? Would you please put away your device?‚Äù

‚ÄúI-I‚Ä¶uhm‚Ä¶s-sorry‚Ä¶‚Äù I stammered, my heart sinking as the nurse looked down at me. ‚ÄúForce of habit‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich is why you were referred to us in the first place. I understand receiving a new psychologist is a shake-up to your normal routine, but the clinic has fallen on hard times. Dr. Soryo will be in to see you shortly,‚Äù the nurse smiled, her brunette locks framing her expression with a softness I hadn‚Äôt seen in a while. Especially in a town like this.

The moment seemed to linger a little more than what she desired, a quick glance to the floor breaking the conversation. A sigh escaped my lips as she headed back into the hall without another word, alone once more. ‚ÄúGreat‚Ä¶great‚Ä¶‚Äù

The familiar feeling of doubt began to emerge once more, its tendrils once more closing around my heart. Of course I would take it too far; scare her with my *wonderful* smile and detachment from being here. Maybe I just should have rescheduled again and gone to 5th with Mark or simply had another round at Yllia‚Äôs. Of course I would make her feel uncomfortable. Of course. Just like high school used to be. Perhaps being alone was for the best for me. Not like I was desirable for anything other than labor. Perhaps the insurance company was wrong about all this.

I let out another sigh as someone knocked on the door. I managed a half-hearted *Come in,* before my shoulders slumped, expecting another old man in a lab coat to verbally dress me down for being a drain on people. The scaled hand that gripped the door sent a shiver down my spine. *Not one of‚Ä¶Them‚Ä¶*¬†

It was almost mocking at how smoothly the door opened, the owner of the hand silently pushing into the room with me. While prepared for yet another lab coat clad doctor, my mind betrayed me as my newly assigned psychologist entered the room. Instead of a short, tubby man with nary a hair on his head, I was greeted with the sight of a tall and sharply put together Madarin woman. Her golden eyes seemed in equal measure to shine with an appetite for avarice and knowledge while betraying hints of soft tenderness. How one being could hold such opposites was dreadful to think of.

Her smile only served to reinforce my distaste of her. It was so‚Ä¶*charming* and disarming. My heart quickened as she bowed her head for a moment, the protesting light from above seeming to finally quit its sputtering. Then there was her hair. It had to have been a wig, surely. Why else would her amber locks soak up the scant provided light if not to mock me and my human-ness? How I was traded one predator for another; even in my most contorting nightmares did I imagine such a mockery.

Her scales shone with polished perfection and looked akin to the fine grain of a shark. This had to all be a dream, surely this was merely a reflection or figment of imagination. But as I wiped my eyes and inwardly wretched at the teary rheum I extracted, she didn‚Äôt disappear. In fact, she had only sat down in a simple chair across from me with a clipboard in her scaled hands.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry for being late today Mr. Bradshaw. Another client of mine took a bit longer with their diagnostics exam. Please excuse the state of the lobby; the recent hurricane trashed the front. It'll be fixed by our next session, I assure you. Now before we begin, do you have any questions for me?‚Äù

I felt weakness overtake me as she spoke, her voice tender and loving despite her exterior. My mind thrashed against it, not wanting to fall for her honeyed words and tender face. She was just like the others; she had to be. ‚ÄúI-I‚Ä¶uhm‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's alright if you need a minute. While I have been here for a while, you are my first long-term patient. I understand the sudden change can be a bit jarring, take as much time as you need,‚Äù the doctor smiled, her teeth a brilliant white.

‚ÄúWhy are you here?‚Äù I weakly asked, my stomach coiling into knots at the thought of her reply.

‚ÄúA loaded question I see. Would you like my personal reason or one for the more royal we?‚Äù the doctor asked, scribbling something down onto her clipboard.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶you specifically,‚Äù I stammered, my gaze darting to the floor.

‚ÄúSimply put, I saw a need in this community that needed to be filled.‚Äù the doctor said reassuringly.

‚ÄúReally? It wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù I stammered, my coiling stomach clenching at the surprising candor in her voice.

‚ÄúOf course. With all the reshuffling at the hospital and the arrival of off-world goods, I felt that I should be one of the first to help the people here,‚Äù the doctor nodded, her pen scratching down something onto her clipboard. ‚ÄúDid you have any other questions?‚Äù

A million things bubbled up to the surface like a toothpick cast into the super-heated water of a kettle. Her age, home planet, and eating habits were some of the first ideas to burst forth, each with harrowing consequences. What if they ate men where she came from, or even trapped them in small holes and used them as chattel? Or she could have some disease that would make my eyes roll out of my head like polished cue balls, only for her kin to snatch me up like those old stories from yesteryear. Or she could have a second maw just underneath her clothes and she would snap me up like a bait-fish. They said that humans were valued and respected but how could I be sure? Not one had ever-

‚ÄúMr. Bradshaw? I know we have an extended session but we are still on a time limit. If you have no further questions for me, we must begin your introductory questions,‚Äù the doctor smiled, her tone even and professional.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶s-sorry. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶I‚Äôve never met an alien before‚Ä¶‚Äù I sighed, an icy wave of shame cascading over my shoulders and back.

‚ÄúAh, I see. If you‚Äôd like, there is a recent Madarin transplant to the area who works at the regional spaceport. She used to be my assistant before looking for more golden sands, but she is rather lonely. Perhaps you could ask her some questions once we are done here in order to, how do you humans put it? Get your feet wet? Yes, I think that is how it goes,‚Äù the doctor noted, offering me a petite smile while scratching more notes onto her clipboard.

‚ÄúHow do you know so much about people?‚Äù I asked, my heart threatening to crawl into my throat.

The doctor seemed to ponder my question, though a knowing twinkle resided in her eye. ‚ÄúWell, as a xenopsychologist, it‚Äôs part of my job. But, I have gone out of my way to help myself to the several thousand hours of observation notes taken over the last century on my journey here. In all honesty, I found the similarities of our two peoples fascinating despite being light-years apart. A few back home would down on what I do but I believe it‚Äôs worth the effort.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù the doctor asked, cocking her head to the side as her gaze sharpened.

‚ÄúI-I thought that‚Ä¶you were like the other aliens‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat other‚Ä¶oh, I see. It is quite alright Mr. Bradshaw.¬†I should have prepared a primer‚Ä¶‚Äù

I shook my head as I began to reconcile what the doctor told me about herself, even if the information was superficial. ‚ÄúI shouldn't have assumed. It-‚Äù

She held up a finely scaled hand before I had the opportunity to continue, my train of thought derailing as she offered me another smile. ‚ÄúIt's quite alright Mr. Bradshaw, you have nothing to apologize for. It was a simple mistake.‚Äù

A sigh escaped me as I sank into the weathered embrace of the chair, the doctor's lamplight eyes observing me with great intent. She scribbled down something else onto her clipboard before continuing, her smile deepening a tad as she adjusted her right leg to rest atop her left. ‚ÄúNow, I do believe we should move on with our session today Mr. Bradshaw. I‚Äôd like to start with your early life and go from there.‚Äù

My stomach rolled at the thought of starting there, old wounds long since stabbed over by time threatening to once again spew forth angst and bitter feelings. I knew this would have happened eventually, but in the first session? She had to be trying to break me for some alien purpose, she had to! Perhaps she wanted to make me into one of those breeders the vidscreen at home talked about, where men would disappear from their homes only to be found under a pile of desperate aliens. Or she could have been wanting to make me suffer all over again, to make me squirm and squeal for her pleasure. I swallowed as I tried to skirt around her first joust into my mind, wanting to keep the old wounds from reopening. ‚ÄúDo‚Ä¶do we have to?‚Äù

She offered a patient and knowing nod, her voice now tuned to be comforting and almost motherly. ‚ÄúI know it's painful, but life is similar to art. There is always a journey that molds us, whether it was through pain or joy. You don't need to tell me everything yet, just some of the more notable things.‚Äù

I struggled to keep from cracking, but her soft words and tone made my heart pound. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶I grew up on a farm.‚Äù

*no no No NO! Think about something else, anything else but there! That wretched mire of dank earth and braying beasts! It disgusted us, remember?*

‚ÄúA farm. Interesting, Mr. Bradshaw. Would you have considered it a comfortable place to grow up?‚Äù the doctor suddenly asked, her eyes boring into me like luminous drills.

‚ÄúI-I guess? I don't remember much about it,‚Äù I frowned, shame slowly sinking her claws into my back.

‚ÄúOh? How come, if you don't mind me pressing a bit.‚Äù

I had lost this battle. Despite my best effort the doctor won out, her charm and gentleness breaking down my stalwart defense. I couldn't keep up the act any longer and relented to her, slumping into the chair as I pieced things back together. ‚ÄúWe moved when I was young, very young. A‚Ä¶a bank took the house and land, forcing my father to find work in town. I‚Ä¶don't remember my mother.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see. Something like that could have traumatic effects later in life, thank you for sharing. Please continue,‚Äù the doctor nodded sympathetically, scratching down more notes onto her clipboard.

‚ÄúWork was hard to find at times, with my father going from one job to the next. He tried his hardest to provide for the two of us‚Ä¶and it killed him. It was all‚Ä¶too much,‚Äù I sighed, a tear rolling down my cheek. ‚ÄúThen I was alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by alone? Surely you still had some family that would take you in, no?‚Äù the doctor asked, tapping her pen against her chin.

‚ÄúNo. No part of my family wanted me after everything that happened. They‚Ä¶blamed me‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúMmm. Let's move on to something else instead. Could you tell me what you have been doing recently?‚Äù the doctor asked, flipping the paper she had scribbled her notes on.

‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù I asked, Shame having now found her familiar place across my shoulders.

‚ÄúWell for work or things you've done in the last month or so, recreation, anything relatively recent,‚Äù the doctor smiled, softening her once pensive expression.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I worked at the shelter,‚Äù I eventually choked out, feeling like I would empty the contents of my stomach from the fear of her alien judgement.

‚ÄúThat sounds wonderful! Public service is one of the best things you can do for not only others, but yourself as well. What did you do there?‚Äù

*Her smile is too fake, her tone too sugary-sweet. This has to be a ploy, a trick to get me to further fall into her talons grasp! I-I was right, she only wants to use me for some alien purpose. Perhaps a ritual? No, something worse; a probe!*

‚ÄúServed soup,‚Äù I lied through a forced neutral smile, not wanting to let her truly know what I did.

‚ÄúI see. Besides working for the shelter, what else have you done?‚Äù the doctor inquired, strangely having set her pen aside.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶uhm‚Ä¶do‚Ä¶things?‚Äù I weakly stammered, beads of sweat forming on my forehead.

*sheknowsshwknowsSHEKNOWS!*

‚ÄúOf course, of course,‚Äù the doctor nodded, her smile faltering a bit. ‚ÄúBut I must be honest here. As your new psychologist, I must ask: why are you lying to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI-I would never‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶uhm‚Ä¶‚Äù

Her judicious gaze bore into me as she leaned forward, unfolding her legs while the clipboard found a new home on the small desk beside her. I turned my gaze away from her, hoping that she would not press any further. My hopes were dashed by her slipping from the chair and kneeling on the floor, looking up at me.

‚ÄúYou know lying is not good for your mental health, right? And I cannot help you if you push me out. So, why lie to me?‚Äù

‚Äî

‚ÄúJohn, what are you doing?‚Äù

The sudden intrusion snapped me back into the waking world, a long line of alphabet gibberish plastering the glassy screen in front of me. The faint sound of something sizzling caught my attention from the direction of the kitchen while the telling fragrance of sweating onions drew me away from the mess on my screen. The faint thrum of an acoustic guitar joined them, the bluesy song rousing me from the keyboard.

‚ÄúI was just‚Ä¶working‚Ä¶‚Äù I stretched, a deep yawn following soon after.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you are,‚Äù the voice of my girlfriend echoed, the music fading as the song ended. ‚ÄúYou need to sleep more often.‚Äù

I snorted as I pushed away from the table, initiating another round of stretches. My joints ached after however long I had been out, a weathered desk chair and heavy oak table not the ideal sleep aides. ‚ÄúYou know I sleep enough.‚Äù

My girlfriend popped her head from the kitchen, a small pout on her face. ‚ÄúBabe‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's fine, okay? I just‚Ä¶need a couple more pages for the publisher and then it's off to editing,‚Äù I sighed, wiping the crust from my eyes.

‚ÄúJohn‚Ä¶you know they offered you some time off for the holidays, right?‚Äù my girlfriend sighed, slipping out of the kitchen and heading towards me.

‚ÄúI know, but I have to get this done. It's been over a month and I finally got the itch again and‚Ä¶‚Äù I started to protest, only for my forming counter to my love's insistence stifled by her gently beginning to rub my shoulders.

‚ÄúIt's the holidays, John. And I want you to actually relax for once in your life.‚Äù

‚ÄúSeri‚Ä¶‚Äù I sighed, trying to hide my satisfaction with her technique.

‚ÄúNo more buts. It's a time of giving and happiness, and you sir are not giving me enough,‚Äù Seri playfully pouted, stopping her massage as she leaned against my chair. The weathered oak groaned and squeaked as it struggled to hold her up, her frame larger than average.

‚ÄúAlright, alright. I'll‚Ä¶give it a rest,‚Äù I said, Seri chuckling as she relented from pressing against the chair. I closed the lid of my laptop but hesitated to get up. ‚ÄúUhm‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYes love?‚Äù Seri smiled, a wide smile splitting her lips and showing off her perfectly white teeth. ‚ÄúA bit stuck?‚Äù

‚ÄúY-yeah,‚Äù I stammered, my cheeks growing hot once Seri kissed my cheek.

‚ÄúMmm, it seems like you are right. Perhaps a strong lady could free you?‚Äù Seri grinned impishly, hooking her hands under my armpits. ‚ÄúIf only he said please‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease?‚Äù I stammered, my cheeks bright red now despite my efforts to keep a straight face.

‚ÄúIt would be my pleasure,‚Äù Seri smiled, lifting me from the chair before setting me back down like I was merely an accessory.

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

Seri looked down at me with a twinkle in her eye, her dusty tan scales having been buffed recently. They shone like dull mirrors in the harsh light of the overhead chandelier, her paint-speckled tank top just one size too small for her Amazonian frame. Despite having been up earlier than I was, her raven black hair was messy and unkempt, her usual styling sacrificed for the sake of comfort during the winter season. Time seemed to slow as she ran her fingers through her veritable mane, the subtle outlines of her toned biceps flexing just so from the action. I had to have been buried too far into my work to not have noticed the amount of work she had put into herself despite her lax and messy look this morning.

The world caught up with me as Seri chuckled, breaking my stupor with a playful kiss on the cheek. ‚ÄúEnjoying the view darling?‚Äù

‚ÄúY-yeah. Did‚Ä¶did you start to work out again?‚Äù I asked, quickly glancing to the floor.

‚ÄúMmm‚Ä¶yes and no. I mostly do cardio when I do work out but with the studio moving, I've had to move a lot of equipment,‚Äù Seri smiled, a polished talon gently lifting my chin. ‚ÄúAnd I wish you would stop doing that so much love.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's‚Ä¶for your sake. With all the news and everything‚Ä¶‚Äù I sighed, Seri shaking her head.

‚ÄúWho cares about what the talking heads on the vidscreen say? I love you John, human or no. Nothing they could say would ever make me leave you,‚Äù Seri said tenderly, lovingly taking her hand in mine. ‚ÄúNow, are you hungry?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I swallowed nervously, trying my hardest to not blush.

‚ÄúThat's good then. I wouldn't want to waste all this bacon and eggs I've made. Grab us coffee while I serve, okay?‚Äù Seri smiled, squeezing my hand before heading back into the kitchen.

‚ÄúGot it,‚Äù I nodded, my heart racing for a split moment before I finally managed to compose myself. *Hot coffee burns‚Ä¶*

After taking a moment to collect myself I headed into the narrow galley kitchen of our shared apartment, the narrow space a pain point for the both of us. While it would function as intended, Seri was just tall enough to be nearly scraping the ceiling while I found the lack of counter space unappealing. But you tend to get what you pay for, and all things considered it was all we could afford for now.¬†

‚ÄúDo you want your special mug?‚Äù I asked, looking back towards Seri as she loaded up her plate with a mountain of bacon.

‚ÄúMmm‚Ä¶sure. You remember how I like my coffee fixed right?‚Äù Seri asked back, looking over her shoulder as I retrieved her favorite mug from its usual spot in the dishwasher.

‚ÄúOf course. Black with two spoons of mesquite honey and a kiss,‚Äù I teased, wiping away some stray water from the floral print of the cup.

‚ÄúYou are such a smart man. And a tricky teaser‚Ä¶‚Äù Seri chuckled, shaking her head a bit before returning her attention to the food. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶I think I forgot something.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did you forget?‚Äù I asked, the phrase not completely registering in time. ‚ÄúOh. I‚Ä¶shoot.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's okay dear. It was‚Ä¶I thought we had something to do today,‚Äù Seri mused, letting the thought hang between us.¬†

‚ÄúMust've not been important then,‚Äù I shrugged, turning around and placing Seri's coffee in front of her.

‚ÄúBy the Nine! That was it!‚Äù she exclaimed, snapping her fingers. ‚ÄúI was going to take you to go talk to my boss for a job at the mill.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe mill? But‚Ä¶don't they only hire aliens there?‚Äù I frowned.

‚ÄúWell, there have been some openings for human apprenticeships recently and I know the local labor union has been wanting new workers for some time now. The downside is that it's a full-time position. But I'm sure we can make it work,‚Äù Seri smiled, playfully ruffling my hair.

‚ÄúH-hey! No fair‚Ä¶‚Äù I protested, my blush returning once again.

‚ÄúYou are so cute when you are angry. But we can pause until after meeting my boss,‚Äù Seri cooed, taking her cup of coffee and heading to the table.

‚ÄúFine‚Ä¶‚Äù I sighed, embarrassed to admit that she was right.",3,1736622712.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

","Following the overwhelmingly positive response to my last post on dopamine depletion, I wanted to share with you the practical steps that have transformed my mornings. Not theory‚Äîbattle-tested by one who has been there, struggling with the same challenges. Let's dive into how you can master your mornings and unlock your true potential.

In this post, you'll learn what to do right after waking up‚Äîbefore starting any morning routine‚Äîhow to apply Robin Sharma's 20/20/20 method, and most importantly, how to make this a lifetime habit. Remember, self-improvement is a marathon, not a sprint. So start small and be consistent. Over time, you will reap 100x the rewards for your investment in yourself.

**First Things First: Just Woke Up? Here's What to Do**

**Never Hit Snooze:**

When you hit the snooze button, your body starts a new sleep cycle that it won't be able to finish. This can make you feel groggy and disoriented for the rest of the day. Yes it sucks sometimes I know, have discipline and GET OUT!



**Hydrate Immediately**

Drink about 400 milliliters (roughly one and a half cups) of water that you‚Äôve prepared the night before. Add a pinch of sea salt and a squeeze of lemon. Why?

* Sea salt replenishes electrolytes lost during the night.
* Lemon boosts hydration, aids digestion, and provides vitamin C to kickstart your system.

**Make Your Bed**

This small act creates a sense of accomplishment first thing in the morning. Even if your day goes downhill, you‚Äôll return to a neatly made bed, ready for rest.

**Morning Routine: The 20/20/20 Method by Robin Sharma**

Robin Sharma‚Äôs 20/20/20 method provides a structured and effective template for your mornings, dividing the first hour of your day into three focused segments:

1. **Move (5:00‚Äì5:20 AM)**

Spend the first 20 minutes doing high-intensity physical activity. As your heartbeat rises, you're releasing dopamine, serotonin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which increase your mood and cognitive capacity.

* Examples of activities:
   * Running, yoga, or push-ups
   * Dancing or riding a bicycle
   * My personal preference: jump rope for 12 minutes followed by an 8-minute stretching activity
   * If you are a beginner, an intense walk around your neighborhood or slow bike ride has the same result.

1. **Reflect (5:20‚Äì5:40 AM)**

Use this time for self-reflection and mindfulness. This helps decrease stress, improves clarity, and cultivates a sense of gratitude.

* Examples:
   * Guided or unguided meditation
   * Breathwork exercises
   * Journaling (write down your goals, gratitude, or thoughts)

1. **Grow (5:40‚Äì6:00 AM)**

Use the last 20 minutes for learning and self-improvement. The goal is personal and professional growth.

* Examples:
   * Read books on personal development or a skill you want to learn
   * Watch educational videos or take online courses
   * Study a new language or subject

This entire hour is what Sharma calls the ‚ÄúVictory Hour.‚Äù It sets a positive tone for your day and creates momentum.

**Making It Stick: A Lifelong Change**

Changing your morning habits isn‚Äôt an overnight process. Here are a few strategies to make it sustainable:

* **Start Small:** If waking up at 5:00 AM and doing an hour-long routine feels overwhelming, start with just 10 minutes. Gradually increase as it becomes easier.
* **Be Patient:** It took me months to go from scrolling through my phone in bed to loving mornings. All the small victories should be celebrated, and don't beat yourself up if you slip occasionally, think to yourself what went wrong and make changes accordinaly.
* **Personalize It** Everybody is not going to thrive off of the precise 20/20/20 formula. Maybe you'd instead take a 5-minute walk to the park with a book or do your workout later in the day. Experiment and find what works for you.
* **Create Joy** If you aren't excited about your morning, modify it. Play great music, get a sunrise in, or perhaps just savor the coffee part of the experience. Make it something you'll look forward to every day.
* **Don't touch your phone**, this is your morning the world can manage for an hour without you believe me.

**Final Thoughts**

Transforming your mornings can transform your life. It's not about perfection; it's about progress. Every small step you take compounds over time, resulting in huge growth and fulfillment.

We live in the same neighborhood and used to work at the same company. He is social; I am not. At first it was nice to chat with him as we are in similar stages of career and parenting. But I have depression and anxiety and have therapy for that and PTSD. I also carry a lot of shame, and between all 3 elements it‚Äôs difficult to be in public. All of that has significantly intensified in the past 5 years.  

The last couple of years I‚Äôve drifted away, but he will call or text me sometimes. The times I‚Äôve answered the calls he talks and talks and sometimes about things that are triggering and then just randomly says ‚Äúok, I gotta go, bye‚Äù and hangs up. Or he will text articles that are, for me, angering or make me sad.(A normal person might not be triggered so much.) I did confront him about one of the articles and he apologized. 

He recently called and left a voicemail to ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù and suggested coffee. I don‚Äôt wish this person any ill will and don‚Äôt want to go for coffee. I just don‚Äôt feel good about myself afterwards. 

Is it ok if I just not respond anymore, or do I owe him some sort of communication to say I‚Äôm dealing with health issues and between that, co-parenting and work I just don‚Äôt have anything left in the tank?

---------------------------------------------

If you're looking for a mouthwatering meal that practically cooks itself, a slow cooker is your best friend. One of the keys to achieving delicious and tender beef dishes lies in choosing the right cut of beef. Knowing which cuts work best in a slow cooker can elevate your meals, and make meal prep simpler and more enjoyable. Here‚Äôs a look at some of the best cuts of beef for slow cooker recipes.

### Chuck Roast

Chuck roast is a top choice for slow cooker recipes. This cut comes from the shoulder, and it‚Äôs known for its rich flavor and tenderness when cooked low and slow. The marbling in chuck roast breaks down during the cooking process, resulting in juicy, flavorful meat. It‚Äôs perfect for dishes like pot roast and beef stew.

### Brisket

Another great cut is brisket. It‚Äôs cut from the breast or lower chest of the cow and has a hefty amount of fat, making it ideal for slow cooking. As it cooks, the fat renders down and adds luscious flavor to your dish. Brisket can be used for savory barbecue meals, or it can be braised in wine for an elegant dish. Just remember that it takes longer to cook, so be patient!

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/best-cut-of-beef-for-slow-cooker  
  
### Round Cuts

Round cuts, especially top round and bottom round, are leaner than chuck and brisket. While they might not have as much fat, they‚Äôre still great in a slow cooker. With the right seasoning and cooking time, round cuts can become incredibly tender and full of flavor. These cuts work well in sandwiches, stir-fries, or shredded for tacos.

### Short Ribs

Short ribs are perfect for slow cookers, thanks to their bone and fat content. Cooking short ribs for a long time at low temperatures allows the meat to soften and separate from the bone. The result is incredibly tender meat that‚Äôs bursting with flavor. You can use short ribs in soups or stews, or serve them glazed with barbecue sauce for a hearty meal.

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/best-cut-of-beef-for-slow-cooker  
  
### Oxtail

If you're looking to try something different, oxtail might be the way to go. This cut comes from the tail of the cow and is rich in connective tissue. As it cooks, it releases gelatin, which creates a rich, velvety broth. Oxtail is excellent in soups and stews, and it pairs beautifully with hearty vegetables like carrots and potatoes.

### Flank Steak

Flank steak is another cut that can be used in a slow cooker, although it‚Äôs best when marinated beforehand. This lean cut comes from the abdominal muscles of the cow and can be quite tough if not cooked correctly. By slow cooking flank steak with a flavorful marinade, you‚Äôll end up with tender and tasty meat that‚Äôs perfect for tacos or served alongside rice.

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/best-cut-of-beef-for-slow-cooker  
  
### Creative Tips for Cooking

- **Season Well:** Always use a good amount of seasoning. Slow cooking intensifies flavors, so don‚Äôt hold back!
- **Add Liquid:** Make sure to add enough liquid to prevent the meat from drying out. Broths, sauces, or even wine work great!
- **Layer Wisely:** Place tougher cuts of meat at the bottom of the slow cooker, as they take longer to cook. Vegetables can go on top since they cook faster.
- **Don‚Äôt Rush:** For the best results, avoid the temptation to open the lid too often. Each time you do, steam escapes and can prolong cooking time.

Choosing the best cut of beef for your slow cooker can make a significant difference in the final dish. Remember, the right cut combined with your favorite seasonings and cooking methods will lead to tender, flavorful meals that your family will love. Enjoy experimenting with different cuts and discover your favorites!

Tips for Enhancing Flavor in Slow-Cooked Beef Dishes
----------------------------------------------------

Slow-cooked beef dishes are a comforting staple in many households, but sometimes they lack a punch in flavor. To elevate your beef recipes, consider these effective tips. Each one is sure to bring depth and richness to your slow cooker options.

### Choose the Right Cut of Beef

The foundation of flavor in a slow-cooked beef dish lies in the cut of meat you select. Look for tougher cuts that benefit from long cooking times. Some excellent choices include:

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/best-cut-of-beef-for-slow-cooker  
  
- **Chuck Roast:** This cut is very marbled, making it perfect for slow cooking. It becomes tender and flavorful over time.
- **Brisket:** Known for its rich flavor, brisket breaks down beautifully in a slow cooker.
- **Round Roast:** A leaner option, it still manages to deliver a great taste when cooked properly.
- **Short Ribs:** They are packed with flavor and turn incredibly tender in a slow cooker.

### Season Generously

Don't skimp on seasonings. Since slow cooking can dilute flavors, it's essential to use a robust blend of spices and herbs. Try adding:

- **Salt and Pepper:** Start with a solid base of salt and black pepper to enhance the meat's natural flavors.
- **Garlic and Onions:** These aromatics not only add depth but also create a delightful aroma as they cook.
- **Herbs:** Fresh herbs like thyme, rosemary, or bay leaves work well, but dried herbs can also do wonders if fresh isn‚Äôt available.
- **Spices:** Think about using paprika, cumin, or even a touch of chili powder for added warmth.

### Incorporate Liquid Wisely

The type of liquid you use can significantly impact flavor. Here are a few suggestions:

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/best-cut-of-beef-for-slow-cooker  
  
- **Broth or Stock:** Beef stock provides a rich base that enhances the overall taste.
- **Wine:** A splash of red wine adds complexity; just remember to let it simmer to cook off the alcohol.
- **Coffee or Beer:** Both can add unique flavors and depth; coffee, especially, complements the beef well.

### Add Vegetables for Extra Flavor

Don't overlook the importance of vegetables when crafting your dish. Carrots, potatoes, and celery not only provide texture but also infuse the dish with extra flavor. Consider these additions:

- **Root Vegetables:** Carrots and parsnips add sweetness and texture.
- **Tomatoes:** Use canned or fresh; tomatoes can contribute acidity and richness.
- **Mushrooms:** Their umami flavor enhances the savory notes of the dish.

### Layering Flavors is Key

When you layer flavors, you're building a more complex and enjoyable dish. Follow these steps:

- **Sear the Meat:** Before placing it in the slow cooker, sear your beef on all sides. This step locks in moisture and adds a caramelized surface flavor.
- **Cook Onions until Golden:** Browning your onions before adding them to the slow cooker boosts their sweetness and flavor profile.
- **Build Flavors Gradually:** Begin with base flavors, then add others strategically; for instance, incorporate herbs and spices towards the end of cooking for a fresher taste.

### Thicken Your Sauce

A rich sauce can make or break a slow-cooked meal. Here are ways to thicken and improve your sauce:

- **Use a Slurry:** Mix equal parts cornstarch and cold water, then add to your sauce during the last hour of cooking.
- **Reduce Sauce:** If you have time, remove the lid of your slow cooker in the last hour to allow the sauce to thicken.
- **Add a Roux:** A roux mixture (flour and butter) stirred into your dish can add richness and thickness.

Experimenting with these tips can transform your slow-cooked beef dishes from ordinary to extraordinary. By carefully selecting your cut, seasoning well, incorporating a variety of flavors, and using the right cooking techniques, you‚Äôll create a delightful experience that will leave your family and friends asking for seconds. So, roll up your sleeves, grab that slow cooker, and start enhancing those flavors!

### Conclusion

When it comes to selecting the best cut of beef for slow cooking, choices like chuck roast, brisket, and short ribs shine for their ability to develop rich flavors and tender textures over long cooking times. These cuts typically have more marbling and connective tissue, which break down beautifully, ensuring that your meals are juicy and full of taste. Embracing slow cooking not only yields delicious outcomes but also simplifies the cooking process, making it ideal for busy lifestyles.

To elevate the flavor of your slow-cooked beef dishes, consider incorporating additional elements such as aromatics, herbs, and spices. Ingredients like garlic, onions, and carrots can enhance the overall depth of your recipe. Using broths or stocks instead of water adds even more richness. Don't shy away from experimenting with sauces like barbecue, soy, or tomato-based products; they can transform a simple dish into something extraordinary.

Another great strategy is to layer flavors. Start by browning the meat to create a savory crust. Adding liquid gradually will allow the beef to absorb different tastes as it cooks. Remember that cooking times can vary based on the cut and size of the meat, so using a meat thermometer can ensure you reach the perfect doneness.

This still needs work, but im that much closer. Let me know what you think :)

Lyrics: 
The hills outside seem to love the sunrise
As the earth loves the moon
A state of growing pains and wishing for more lies
Anything and everything but you 

Relative recompense, I'm cutting all the cords, I dream jumping every fence of shaking hands with swords
Malpractice, suits, old work boots and a place to lay my head
Write a rough draft off your will in case you end up dead

Anesthesia, Anesthesia, it takes away your name, giving all the other options makes them all look the same

Neon light For a mausoleum, sudden seizure of every running theme
Working on the highway, Sandman on retainer, run the bloodied bile through an old coffee strainer

And the lights they burn my eyes, my respite is the moon
Make the broken path, the one that no one tries, the end is coming soon

*A few days before the great feast of the¬†Nativity of Christ¬†we talked with Archpriest Valerian Krechetov, a famous confessor and preacher, and rector of the Church of the¬†Protection of the Mother of God¬†in the Akulovo village near Moscow. The subject of our talk was: How can we prepare ourselves to experience the great Christian feasts more attentively?*

[Archpriest Valerian Krechetov.¬†¬†¬†](https://preview.redd.it/je0ms134sece1.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffdf481276d7293eb99e92dce9fd33be9cf556e6)

‚Äî**Father Valerian, the vanity of this world and the hectic lifestyle prevent us from paying attention to the events and people that are ‚Äúflying past‚Äù like a whirlwind and don‚Äôt leave us any chance of looking into our souls more closely. To our great shame, we have to acknowledge this just before the most important Church feasts, when despite our efforts we feel powerless to change anything within ourselves in order ‚Äúto swim with the tide of Divine grace‚Äù and feel ‚Äúthe joy inexpressible‚Äù, as it was in our childhood.**

‚ÄîThe point is that Church services are of primary importance in our Orthodox Church. As the¬†New Martyr Sergei Mechev¬†used to say, Church services are an ‚Äúoutside of this world‚Äù sacrament ‚Äì a sacrament that is performed both in the Church Militant (on earth) and the Church Triumphant (in heaven). The famous feast of the Protecting Veil of the Mother of God is visible evidence of this truth: The Most Holy Theotokos appeared in the Church of Blachernae and, together with all the gathered worshippers, offered up Her prayers for all who prayed in the whole world. A fine example is¬†St. Seraphim of Sarov, who once beheld the Savior Jesus Christ Himself, surrounded by the Heavenly Bodiless Powers, after the Small Entrance during the Liturgy. Another example is St. Sergius of¬†Radonezh, whose disciples saw angels concelebrating the Liturgy with him. And there are lots of other similar examples, when it was revealed to people that celestial dwellers were serving with them. All these numerous examples are testimony to the fact that the celebration takes place both at the earthly Liturgy and the heavenly Liturgy simultaneously. That is the most significant and essential moment in our Orthodox faith!

‚Äî**Thus, it means that Church services are of primary importance to us?**

‚ÄîThat is right. Furthermore, all that happens in our life on earth is above all related to its spiritual side. As St. Ambrose of Optina used to say, we must look at all things through the lens of eternity. More than that, only then and this way will we begin to understand all events of our life properly.

‚Äî**But how can we come to the right, spiritual view of things happening on earth?**

‚ÄîOf course, we are not above Apostle Peter to whom Christ said,¬†*What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter*¬†(Jn. 13:7). There is a widely known aphorism that ‚Äúmarriages are made in Heaven‚Äù. It testifies to the same fact, that in this material world we observe only fragments of what is done and exists in heaven ‚Äúin its fullness‚Äù.

‚Äî**Fr. Valerian, can you possibly provide some concrete example of this, please?**

‚ÄîThere are countless examples bearing testimony to this truth. By the Lord‚Äôs providence I was privileged to associate with the reposed Vladimir Petrovich Sedov. He was distantly related to the Holy Metropolitan Philaret (Drozdov) of Moscow. One day the saint appeared to Vladimir when he was awake and conversed with him for about an hour. The metropolitan said an interesting thing to him: ‚ÄúThanks to your abstinence the Lord has saved you from death on many occasions.‚Äù (It should be mentioned that Vladimir from his childhood abstained from meat, wine and other alcoholic beverages, even from tea and coffee, and never smoked). This man truly experienced extremely difficult life situations. For example, as a doctor he was sent to the areas affected by plague and cholera epidemics on a hospital train many times. And, as Vladimir himself told me, at times it happened that all the train cars were bombed and only two remained whole (and he was travelling in one of them). St. Philaret said to him: ‚ÄúDo you think these were just coincidences? No, they weren‚Äôt! I have been watching over each step of yours since you were born!‚Äù

‚Äî**Yes, that is an amazing story! Many Orthodox believers have experienced such phenomena. However, we tend to forget them or describe them as ‚Äúmere coincidences‚Äù.**

‚ÄîIndeed the spiritual world influences the material world! And how many miracles of this kind occurred during the Second World War! In many cases people heard voices telling them to walk away immediately. People would move away and just then a shell would fall on the very place where they had been standing a few moments before, and they would certainly have been killed by it. This is true evidence of a living and permanent interaction between the two worlds ‚Äì the visible and the invisible ones. And what we see with our physical eyes is, as it were, ‚Äúthe tip of the iceberg‚Äù, whereas the real depth is not revealed to most of people.

‚Äî**Therefore, the true meaning of what takes place in the Church is beyond the comprehension of most people, isn‚Äôt it?**

‚ÄîAll that happens in the Church is done in the invisible spiritual world. But in the material world we do not come to understand it immediately, and only few of us succeed in this because the rest of us are preoccupied by this-worldly things.

[‚Äã\(A fresco of the Nativity of Christ. Studenica Monastery, Serbia\).¬†¬†¬†¬†](https://preview.redd.it/3afidrx6sece1.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&s=f81014d59295174c09d99d7d711d87f9c5706e5e)

‚Äî**Let us take the Birth of Christ as an example of such event.**

‚ÄîThe example of the Nativity of the Savior is remarkable‚Ä¶ Jerusalem and all its surroundings were in deep sleep, only the shepherds were awake. And at that very moment the greatest sacrament was performed ‚Äì namely, the Birth of the Son of God, the Nativity of Christ. Theses glad tidings were proclaimed to people by angels. Who were the first recipients of the glad tidings? The shepherds...

‚Äî**But the Magi, the wise men from the East, followed the star, came to Bethlehem, and fell down and worshipped the newborn Infant God, too.**

‚ÄîYes, a remarkable parallel is drawn here‚Ä¶ Shortly before the great event the Magi, the wise men from the East (scientists of the age, as it were), spotted some unusual celestial body ‚Äì a star that suddenly appeared. They realized that some extraordinary event was taking place and it was in the invisible world. What was it? I believe it was the Annunciation! They saw the star from afar, and they followed it and it took them a long time to reach the destination. And they finally arrived to Jerusalem (by the way, it is a fine symbol of science), and as wise men they came to the conclusion that something was going to happen near Jerusalem. But what?

[The Adoration of the Magi.¬†¬†¬†¬†](https://preview.redd.it/v60qtaz8sece1.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=18f3675a7cee399ab5922ae5051604c6c53738e1)

Today there are some scientists who have not yet come to believe in God and who claim, ‚Äúyes, there is something out there.‚Äù And they are often afraid to use the word ‚ÄúGod‚Äù at this. There is an excellent aphorism, though I don‚Äôt know its author: ‚ÄúThe last word in science is the first word of the Bible.‚Äù Thus, when the Magi reached Jerusalem and began asking people,¬†*Where is He that is born King of the Jews?*¬†(see Mt. 2:2), the scribes explained them that it was due to happen in Bethlehem of Judea. Thus the Magi, the wise men, were then guided from Jerusalem to Bethlehem, according to an Old Testament prophecy‚Ä¶ So where did they finally arrive? At the place where the shepherds had come before them, informed of the Birth of the Savior directly by angels!

‚Äî**So the Lord preferred to reveal Himself to ordinary, unschooled men first?**

‚ÄîThis is what actually happens in our life too: simple-hearted people are keenly aware of the power of the spiritual world. With our common vanities and secular cares, we often forget that something very important is happening in the world. The more that hustle and bustle overshadows our spiritual life, the more difficult it is to sense things above. And here are the Savior‚Äôs words about the end times:¬†*They did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded*¬†(Lk. 17:28) ‚Äì that is, the people will be busy with all these things while the Judgment Day will be nearing.

‚Äî**By the way, lately there has been a lot of fuss in the press about the so-called ‚Äúdoomsday‚Äù, or ‚Äúthe end of the world‚Äù, to be more exact \[it should be reminded that many people across the globe waited for ‚Äúthe Mayan apocalypse‚Äù around December 21, 2012; their apprehensions were based on some ancient calendars of the Maya peoples that had once inhabited parts of Central America. Of course, ‚Äúthe end of the world‚Äù did not happen. This interview was taken in early January 2013, when the memories of the debate were still alive ‚Äì trans.\].**

‚ÄîAmazingly, God‚Äôs providence was revealed through this commotion, which, however, can make any sincere Orthodox believer smile! The Lord has obviously allowed this na√Øve discussion to happen (I mean the naivety of calculating ‚Äúthe accurate date of the end of the world‚Äù). But this confusion has been a reminder that the end will come sooner or later! And, given the vanity of our days, that looked really ridiculous: some chose to stock up on food ‚Äúfor future use‚Äù (as if food would have helped them after ‚Äúdoomsday‚Äù), while others made money because of their customers (as if money would have been of use after ‚Äúthe last day‚Äù). Thus, the actions of both these groups of people were pointless! But, amazingly, there were also some people who began to think of life more seriously and decided to repent. Perhaps this was the only advantage of the entire story of ‚Äúthe end of the world‚Äù. Though, of course, we should remind people about the Judgment Day! And we need to bear in mind that many of us will have departed this life long before that ‚Äúend‚Äù. Nobody can avoid the end of his life on earth.¬†*Whatsoever thou takest in hand, remember the end, and thou shalt never do amiss*¬†(Eccl. 7:36 KJV). It is perhaps for this precious memory of death that the Lord allows these signs (na√Øve as they are) to come: He reminds us that this life is temporal and eternity awaits us.

[‚ÄãThe Nativity of Christ.¬†¬†¬†¬†](https://preview.redd.it/j86ov9uasece1.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&s=04d344e907c2eaa85417a3537d5a662ff0c2162d)

  
‚Äî**But very soon we are to meet the radiant feast of the Nativity of Christ.**

‚ÄîUnfortunately, in the Christmas Eve bustle we sometimes forget the main thing ‚Äì the joy of the coming Birth of Christ. Unlike adults, children are always excited about Christmas. In some sense it is a children‚Äôs festival so they feel its magic in particular. Maybe their attitude towards the Nativity is childlike, but what is wrong with it? For example, parents have trained their kids to fast, and now they will be able to break their fast and eat absolutely all kinds of food while all are celebrating ‚Äì isn‚Äôt it wonderful for kids? True, their joy is childish, but we also say ‚Äúa great comfort for the brethren‚Äù in reference to monks. There is nothing wrong with it, for our Lord ate and drank Himself, He was present at a wedding in Cana of Galilee and fed all those who were listening to His sermons. So, concern for food and entertainment of others is quite normal. Not without reason is it said that ‚Äúif the body suffers, then the soul suffers with it‚Äù (perhaps an allusion to 1 Cor. 12:26); likewise, if the body rejoices, the soul rejoices with it. And it is also said: ‚ÄúRejoice, soul and body!‚Äù After all, these two entities ‚Äì the physical and the spiritual ones ‚Äì are interrelated. That is natural, given the integrity of human nature.

But there is only one sad thing: Both the body and the soul are clouded with sin so that our joy can never be full‚Ä¶ Someone gets frustrated, someone bears a grudge against others‚Ä¶ And our enemy often strives to disturb our peace of mind. It is a common occurrence: on or just before great Church festivals people may experience temptations as the evil one seeks to make us quarrel with our nearest and dearest and lose our integrity. After all, this is a diabolical concept: ‚Äúdivide and rule‚Äù. Meanwhile the Lord says,¬†*That they may be one, as we are*¬†(Jn. 17:11). For the joy of the feast increases through shared joy. There is a fine dictum, ‚ÄúA sorrow shared is halved, a joy shared is doubled‚Äù.

Such brilliant maxims of ordinary Russian people are very edifying, and they are often based on texts of the Holy Scriptures.

‚Äî**What is the spiritual joy of the feast like?**

‚ÄîIt is the joy of which Jesus Christ said that¬†*‚Ä¶Your joy no man taketh from you*¬†(Jn. 16:22). It is the joy that Apostle Paul wished to everybody, saying,¬†*Rejoice evermore.*¬†*Pray without ceasing.*¬†*In every thing give thanks*¬†(1 Thess. 5:16-18). This joy allows us to take joy from the feast already in this life, in expectation of the bliss of the life to come. By the by, even Johann Wolfgang von Goethe said, ‚ÄúHe who does not believe in an afterlife is dead for this life.‚Äù And he who lives for the sake of the life eternal will have joy both in this life and in the life to come! But if someone is unhappy throughout his life here (is tormented by envy, anger, etc.), then he will find relief neither in this life nor in afterlife. We are very sorry for such people‚Ä¶

[A service on the Nativity of Christ at Sretensky Monastery. Photo by M. Rodionov\/Pravoslavie.ru.¬†¬†¬†¬†](https://preview.redd.it/59ppyjxcsece1.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=d046489d9ecf24323172a358ca450466b3ff364a)

‚Äî**Perhaps we can feel nthe joy of the feast by attending Church services during the weeks preceding the festival?**

‚ÄîThe joy of the oncoming feast is marked by our Orthodox services. How wisely and beautifully the Typicon (the liturgical rules for the whole year) is arranged! The Holy Church hastens to make Christians happy in good time ‚Äì this day or period is called forefeast. When the joy of the feast comes, the Church is not in a hurry to part with it ‚Äì afterfeast exists for this purpose. The greater the feast, the longer periods of its forefeast and afterfeast.

For instance, the Dormition Fast is so wonderful, and it lasts only two weeks. When is it observed? The Mother of God is very merciful, because She is our Mother! Already on the first day of Her fast She gladdens our hearts by the blessing of honey. It is followed by ‚Äúthe Savior of Apples‚Äù \[the Russian folk name for the Transfiguration of the Lord.‚ÄîTrans.\]‚Ä¶

And scarcely has the Nativity Fast begun when the Holy Church starts singing at services, ‚ÄúChrist Is Born, glorify Him!‚Äù And later through the Nativity Fast we sing it at every Sunday Liturgy, ‚ÄúChrist Is Born!‚Äù This has something in common with the Paschal exclamation, ‚ÄúChrist Is Risen!‚Äù When we celebrate Pascha, the Resurrection of Christ, the Easter season lasts forty days and every day we hear, ‚ÄúChrist Is Risen!‚Äù, ‚ÄúChrist Is Risen!‚Äù And in the period preceding the feast of the Nativity we hear at the Church, ‚ÄúChrist Is Born!‚Äù, ‚ÄúChrist Is Born!‚Äù

‚Äî**And the Nativity of Christ is preceded by the Sunday of the Holy Forefathers and the Sunday of the Holy Fathers.**

‚ÄîThat is very natural: to whom should we express our deep gratitude? To those who brought this joy to us, who preserved this truth and handed it down to us. What is this? It is an immediate line of continuity from the Forefathers and the Fathers. It is the tradition of the Church that was passed down from generation to generation up to our times. This continuity has been maintained. There are the Forefathers and the Fathers of our generations just as there were the Forefathers and the Fathers before the Birth of Christ. It signifies our generational succession and teaches us to show reverence for the people who have preserved this truth for us.

‚ÄúHoly Russia, keep the Orthodox faith, on which you became firmly established‚Äù (from the Stichera to the Saints of Russia).

I wish a happy great feast of the Nativity of the Lord to everybody!

1hz2z23,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hz2z23,34M USA,"Good afternoon!

I am 34 years old, 6‚Äô3‚Äù (190 cm) and roughly 98 kg (216 lbs) right now. I have worked in a warehouse for about 10 years (current title: inventory manager) and part-time in a restaurant for 6 (current role: expeditor). I‚Äôm considering a second career in editing and/or teaching. I just want to work on a difficult problem first.

Hobbies are lifting, thrifting, and chatting it up with people at the coffee shop. I have friends whom I visit regularly and go to meetings of a 12-Step group (I don‚Äôt love it but I‚Äôm thankful for it). 

Those are some of the details you may want to know. 

Some of the Christian details are (and excuse the length of some of these):
- I‚Äôm a Protestant.
- I go to a Baptist church but might start going to an Orthodox Presbyterian (OPC) one this year. I do attend every Sunday, and I regularly hang out with Christian friends.
- I‚Äôm an evangelical, by which I mean: I believe that people are, since the Fall, born sinners who are unable to save themselves from God‚Äôs holy wrath and judgment, but that God sent His Son Jesus to become man, live a perfect life in their place, and also die in the place of sinners, having taken upon Himself, once for all, the wrath and judgment that those who trust Him for salvation deserve. We are acceptable to God not because of our good qualities or our relative lack of badness or our feelings about Jesus, but because He died in our place and because God imputes to us His righteousness, which we receive as a gift by faith alone. This is what God reveals to us in His Word, but we need His Spirit to show these things to us and‚Äîas a Lutheran pastor friend says‚Äîto ‚Äúmake us care about them.‚Äù Tl;dr‚Äîwe are fallen, sinful, doomed humans, except that God saves us though Jesus, and we know this from His Word through the work of His Spirit.
- I have neglected theology for several years but now acknowledge its importance as well as my responsibility to develop strong, deep convictions. (I have some already but they should be stronger and deeper.)
- I value reverent worship, expository preaching that isn‚Äôt nerdy, down-to-earth practical applications, maturity, and fellowship/friendliness/hospitality/ brotherly affection among Christians. The local church is a priority for me and will be so more and more.
- I am Reformed in my soteriology. I am a Calvinist, in that sense. I like the Canons of Dort. I used to find this theology terrifying but now find it encouraging. 
- I‚Äôm not 100% on infant baptism but really don‚Äôt mind if you believe in it. I need to study it before I have kids.
- I am not a charismatic, but one of my best friends is. 
- I don‚Äôt pray very much or read the Bible very much. I would benefit from changing those habits at least a little.
- I have very little patience for theological nerdery because it seems irreverent to me. (I respect academic theologians.)
- I appreciate catechisms. 
- I believe that Christians are to be normal people as much as possible, and that they should be as Christian as possible in specifically Christian things (like faith in Christ, honesty in admitting sin, belief in Scripture, etc.). 

I probably left out some important convictions about Scripture, specific doctrines, gender roles (I am traditional but acknowledge that that‚Äôs hard to practice today), politics (I‚Äôm not very political and think it‚Äôs very hard to be a good politician though worth the effort), and more.

I am looking for someone pleasant, mature, interested in personal growth / self-improvement, honest, generous, humble, somewhat funny, and evangelical Protestant. I don‚Äôt care about ethnicity. I honestly don‚Äôt care about weight (like, you can be obese and I won‚Äôt care), but I would like you to have a plan for your long-term health and preferably one that involves strength training. I prefer that you have no kids and have never been married. 

Age range, 20-38, let‚Äôs say. (I‚Äôm a ‚Äúlate bloomer‚Äù / was slow to finish my brain development; I‚Äôm probably on the spectrum, too.) Don‚Äôt be afraid to apply if you‚Äôre outside of the range. However, it‚Äôs important to me that we have at least one kid if we get married.

I made a post the other day in r/relationships where I (M24) was discussing how my F24 girlfriend had been having some arguments recently and she had been starting to get emotionally drained and physically sick a result.

A few days ago, I went to her flat to hang out. She had had been ‚Äòoff‚Äô for a few days because we had an argument last weekend. So much so, that she‚Äôd called in sick to work 2 days in a row and had barely slept. When I went round, she wasn‚Äôt planning to end things but she said stuff along the lines of ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt go on like this‚Äù and basically that the deterioration in her mental health (including physically vomiting for 2 days after the argument which I thought we‚Äôd resolved) was entirely due to the relationship and not any of her underlying anxiety or previous trauma. 

For context, she‚Äôs had anxiety since she was a child, including big problems with food and body image, likely due to quite an emotionally abusive mother. She was also victim of a r*pe at college a few years ago. She told me that she‚Äôs never been to therapy because she‚Äôs capable on unpacking her emotions herself and has her coping mechanisms. For example, she used to go on 1-2 hour walks to give herself the time and space to process things. She‚Äôll always say things like ‚ÄúI think therapy can be helpful but I‚Äôm good at regulating my own emotions and communicating them‚Äù or ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt really think therapy would help me‚Äù and dismiss the idea.

The argument last weekend was ‚Äútipping point‚Äù for her - she said this relationship was too emotionally draining given that it‚Äôs only been 4-5 months.  That resulted in her instantly walking out of the room after I responded to a passive aggressive comment she made in a defensive way by throwing an object onto the floor. She says any hint of aggression or anger is a real trigger for her (understandably). I acknowledged that I overreacted, however, I did so because I felt like her comments were accusatory towards me and unfair - something I really dislike and have experienced before. I also made it explicitly clear that I am not an aggressive person, and a boundary of mine is not to be compared to any aggressive or traumatic acts that happened to her before we met.

I tried to discuss things with her in a calm composed way, saying I understand that she‚Äôs feeling this was but that I love her so deeply and that I‚Äôm willing to put in the steps myself in order to better myself and the relationships (including therapy to deal with my relationship anxiety which I‚Äôd already signed up to). She kept saying stuff along the lines of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you want me to do‚Äù etc. and I kept responding with look for this to work we both have to be willing to compromise and work on it, not quit. She kept having bursts of real upset and then being quiet.  

Basically, the longer this chat went on for (a couple of hours) and the more rational I tried to be, she seemed to get more and more overwhelmed and upset. Eventually it got to a point where she put her hands on her head crying and said ‚ÄúI need to you leave I can‚Äôt do this anymore, please leave please leave‚Äù. She even went into the lounge and cried on the sofa to her flatmate who basically said it was best for me to leave and maybe pick this chat up another time. I was so taken aback by her ‚Äòoverreaction‚Äô and it just reinforces in my head that there‚Äôs so much more going on with her mental health that is separate to our relationship challenges. The friends I‚Äôve spoken to about it have said similar - that is not a normal response to any mild relationship stress. 

Since she asked me to leave on Wednesday, I‚Äôve not had any contact with her. She stopped sharing her location with me and removed a picture of me from her latest insta post on the night. Since then, she‚Äôs not removed the other pictures of us on her feed. We still have a few bits of each other‚Äôs stuff. 

And, I‚Äôm feeling confused. I don‚Äôt know if this is a please leave I never want to see you again or a heat of the moment emotional response that she may come to regret. I obviously still love her and the thought of that horrible chat being the last time I see her makes me sad. As a couple, we were super compatible, apart from the fact I have anxious tendencies that escalated arguments, and she has communication traits that could initiate some of these. I can say that I‚Äôve tried my absolute best to be sympathetic to her horrible experiences while sticking up for my own needs. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to proceed? It‚Äôs been three days of no contact, do I:
- wait for her to reach out since she‚Äôs the one who asked me to get out
- reach out to her and ask to meet for coffee etc. if she‚Äôs feeling up to it and tell her how I truly feel, if nothing else for my own closure
- other? 

TL;DR: my girlfriend and me have been having arguments. She has got too emotionally drained by them and told me to leave in the heat of the moment, despite my best efforts. We‚Äôve not been in contact since. How is best to proceed? ",2,1736621765.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

","Following the overwhelmingly positive response to my last post on dopamine depletion, I wanted to share with you the practical steps that have transformed my mornings. Not theory‚Äîbattle-tested by one who has been there, struggling with the same challenges. Let's dive into how you can master your mornings and unlock your true potential.

In this post, you'll learn what to do right after waking up‚Äîbefore starting any morning routine‚Äîhow to apply Robin Sharma's 20/20/20 method, and most importantly, how to make this a lifetime habit. Remember, self-improvement is a marathon, not a sprint. So start small and be consistent. Over time, you will reap 100x the rewards for your investment in yourself.

**First Things First: Just Woke Up? Here's What to Do**

**Never Hit Snooze:**

When you hit the snooze button, your body starts a new sleep cycle that it won't be able to finish. This can make you feel groggy and disoriented for the rest of the day. Yes it sucks sometimes I know, have discipline and GET OUT!



**Hydrate Immediately**

Drink about 400 milliliters (roughly one and a half cups) of water that you‚Äôve prepared the night before. Add a pinch of sea salt and a squeeze of lemon. Why?

* Sea salt replenishes electrolytes lost during the night.
* Lemon boosts hydration, aids digestion, and provides vitamin C to kickstart your system.

**Make Your Bed**

This small act creates a sense of accomplishment first thing in the morning. Even if your day goes downhill, you‚Äôll return to a neatly made bed, ready for rest.

**Morning Routine: The 20/20/20 Method by Robin Sharma**

Robin Sharma‚Äôs 20/20/20 method provides a structured and effective template for your mornings, dividing the first hour of your day into three focused segments:

1. **Move (5:00‚Äì5:20 AM)**

Spend the first 20 minutes doing high-intensity physical activity. As your heartbeat rises, you're releasing dopamine, serotonin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which increase your mood and cognitive capacity.

* Examples of activities:
   * Running, yoga, or push-ups
   * Dancing or riding a bicycle
   * My personal preference: jump rope for 12 minutes followed by an 8-minute stretching activity
   * If you are a beginner, an intense walk around your neighborhood or slow bike ride has the same result.

1. **Reflect (5:20‚Äì5:40 AM)**

Use this time for self-reflection and mindfulness. This helps decrease stress, improves clarity, and cultivates a sense of gratitude.

* Examples:
   * Guided or unguided meditation
   * Breathwork exercises
   * Journaling (write down your goals, gratitude, or thoughts)

1. **Grow (5:40‚Äì6:00 AM)**

Use the last 20 minutes for learning and self-improvement. The goal is personal and professional growth.

* Examples:
   * Read books on personal development or a skill you want to learn
   * Watch educational videos or take online courses
   * Study a new language or subject

This entire hour is what Sharma calls the ‚ÄúVictory Hour.‚Äù It sets a positive tone for your day and creates momentum.

**Making It Stick: A Lifelong Change**

Changing your morning habits isn‚Äôt an overnight process. Here are a few strategies to make it sustainable:

* **Start Small:** If waking up at 5:00 AM and doing an hour-long routine feels overwhelming, start with just 10 minutes. Gradually increase as it becomes easier.
* **Be Patient:** It took me months to go from scrolling through my phone in bed to loving mornings. All the small victories should be celebrated, and don't beat yourself up if you slip occasionally, think to yourself what went wrong and make changes accordinaly.
* **Personalize It** Everybody is not going to thrive off of the precise 20/20/20 formula. Maybe you'd instead take a 5-minute walk to the park with a book or do your workout later in the day. Experiment and find what works for you.
* **Create Joy** If you aren't excited about your morning, modify it. Play great music, get a sunrise in, or perhaps just savor the coffee part of the experience. Make it something you'll look forward to every day.
* **Don't touch your phone**, this is your morning the world can manage for an hour without you believe me.

**Final Thoughts**

Transforming your mornings can transform your life. It's not about perfection; it's about progress. Every small step you take compounds over time, resulting in huge growth and fulfillment.

I‚Äôm on 40 mg Nexium daily, had half a cup of coffee and then went into every symptom: horrible burping and gas in upper stomach/chest, dizziness, arm and back pain, and this weird mental fog like my brain just shuts off, nasal drainage, nausea and gagging, in addition to high tachycardia, shaking and a general pressure around my forehead and inner ears. I have to take metoprolol 25mg when this occurs. 

Does anyone else get neurological symptoms as well? It seems to be triggered by the caffeine but I‚Äôve had an endoscopy and they didn‚Äôt find anything and said to just keep taking the Nexium so I‚Äôm suspicious there may be something else going on‚Ä¶unless GERD is just an all-encompassing horror show, which could well be the case.

Here‚Äôs what works for me,"Studying can be so overwhelming sometimes, especially when you feel like you‚Äôre not getting anywhere. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs been really helping me stay focused and get through stuff faster:

1. Break it down. Instead of staring at everything at once, I pick smaller pieces to work on. It feels way less stressful and helps me actually make progress.


2. Use a timer. The Pomodoro thing‚Äî25 minutes of studying, then a 5-minute break‚Äîhas been a lifesaver. I don‚Äôt get as tired, and it kinda keeps me motivated.


3. Set the mood. This one‚Äôs huge for me. I put on lo-fi music with soft cafe sounds in the backround‚Äîit‚Äôs like studying in a cozy coffee shop, even when I‚Äôm at home.

Cats: One cat is quite ok with him but the other (my fave) hides away upstairs unless the dog is in his pen. The dog is very respectful of both cats but my cat just doesn‚Äôt like the energy. Hopefully he gets ok. It‚Äôs only been a week and a half so I shouldn‚Äôt be expecting much. 

Toys: so we were told he‚Äôs a chewer so we got him all sorts of chew toys before he arrived. Soft hard rope. He doesn‚Äôt like any of them and he hasn‚Äôt chewed anything. Maybe he was mimicking the actions of the other corgi he grew up with?  I think I need to find something to engage him while I work upstairs. Maybe a puzzle treat box?

Affection: he‚Äôs a potato. He loves to just cuddle on the couch or lay on the floor. He has a comfy bed in his pen but he‚Äôd rather be on the couch or floor in the kitchen. He only recently started wanting pets from us. 

Work: I work from home so I give him attention a few times throughout the day (walks, coffee breaks, lunch) but my office is upstairs and due to the cats we put up a gate so he can‚Äôt get there.  He tends to hang out on the top step waiting for me but he‚Äôs not whiny anymore while there.

","Following the overwhelmingly positive response to my last post on dopamine depletion, I wanted to share with you the practical steps that have transformed my mornings. Not theory‚Äîbattle-tested by one who has been there, struggling with the same challenges. Let's dive into how you can master your mornings and unlock your true potential.

In this post, you'll learn what to do right after waking up‚Äîbefore starting any morning routine‚Äîhow to apply Robin Sharma's 20/20/20 method, and most importantly, how to make this a lifetime habit. Remember, self-improvement is a marathon, not a sprint. So start small and be consistent. Over time, you will reap 100x the rewards for your investment in yourself.

**First Things First: Just Woke Up? Here's What to Do**

**Never Hit Snooze:**

When you hit the snooze button, your body starts a new sleep cycle that it won't be able to finish. This can make you feel groggy and disoriented for the rest of the day. Yes it sucks sometimes I know, have discipline and GET OUT!



**Hydrate Immediately**

Drink about 400 milliliters (roughly one and a half cups) of water that you‚Äôve prepared the night before. Add a pinch of sea salt and a squeeze of lemon. Why?

* Sea salt replenishes electrolytes lost during the night.
* Lemon boosts hydration, aids digestion, and provides vitamin C to kickstart your system.

**Make Your Bed**

This small act creates a sense of accomplishment first thing in the morning. Even if your day goes downhill, you‚Äôll return to a neatly made bed, ready for rest.

**Morning Routine: The 20/20/20 Method by Robin Sharma**

Robin Sharma‚Äôs 20/20/20 method provides a structured and effective template for your mornings, dividing the first hour of your day into three focused segments:

1. **Move (5:00‚Äì5:20 AM)**

Spend the first 20 minutes doing high-intensity physical activity. As your heartbeat rises, you're releasing dopamine, serotonin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which increase your mood and cognitive capacity.

* Examples of activities:
   * Running, yoga, or push-ups
   * Dancing or riding a bicycle
   * My personal preference: jump rope for 12 minutes followed by an 8-minute stretching activity
   * If you are a beginner, an intense walk around your neighborhood or slow bike ride has the same result.

1. **Reflect (5:20‚Äì5:40 AM)**

Use this time for self-reflection and mindfulness. This helps decrease stress, improves clarity, and cultivates a sense of gratitude.

* Examples:
   * Guided or unguided meditation
   * Breathwork exercises
   * Journaling (write down your goals, gratitude, or thoughts)

1. **Grow (5:40‚Äì6:00 AM)**

Use the last 20 minutes for learning and self-improvement. The goal is personal and professional growth.

* Examples:
   * Read books on personal development or a skill you want to learn
   * Watch educational videos or take online courses
   * Study a new language or subject

This entire hour is what Sharma calls the ‚ÄúVictory Hour.‚Äù It sets a positive tone for your day and creates momentum.

**Making It Stick: A Lifelong Change**

Changing your morning habits isn‚Äôt an overnight process. Here are a few strategies to make it sustainable:

* **Start Small:** If waking up at 5:00 AM and doing an hour-long routine feels overwhelming, start with just 10 minutes. Gradually increase as it becomes easier.
* **Be Patient:** It took me months to go from scrolling through my phone in bed to loving mornings. All the small victories should be celebrated, and don't beat yourself up if you slip occasionally, think to yourself what went wrong and make changes accordinaly.
* **Personalize It** Everybody is not going to thrive off of the precise 20/20/20 formula. Maybe you'd instead take a 5-minute walk to the park with a book or do your workout later in the day. Experiment and find what works for you.
* **Create Joy** If you aren't excited about your morning, modify it. Play great music, get a sunrise in, or perhaps just savor the coffee part of the experience. Make it something you'll look forward to every day.
* **Don't touch your phone**, this is your morning the world can manage for an hour without you believe me.

**Final Thoughts**

Transforming your mornings can transform your life. It's not about perfection; it's about progress. Every small step you take compounds over time, resulting in huge growth and fulfillment.

The new illustrations are the works of artists such as Kamisaka Sekka and Ooka Shunboku, both old Japanese artists who have since passed away. There‚Äôs also another artist named Kenda, although no further information is given and I can‚Äôt find anything else online about them. 

I think that they‚Äôre still using AI art, at least for the matcha soft serve image. Soft serve doesn‚Äôt swirl in the pattern depicted and that sort of pattern recognition is indicative of AI to me. I also want to point out that Chapter 1 also uses AI, but it‚Äôs more subtle. It‚Äôs most obvious in Harvest Season, if you look at the repeating patterns of the trees and fields. I suspect they used AI for the other images in the line as well, except possibly Through the Forest if it‚Äôs a stock image. 

I used to recommend d‚ÄôAnnam a lot; it was nice having another niche house create some interesting quality scents like White Rice and Vietnamese Coffee, but I‚Äôm not sure I can support them anymore. As an artist myself, this is pretty disappointing to see. Would love to hear everyone else‚Äôs thoughts on this, as there were some pretty interesting posts about this a couple months ago when it first came to light. ",4,1736621056.0,fragrance,0,1.0,False

Yonder is a lifestyle credit card which provides points to spend on ‚Äòexperiences‚Äô such as restaurant meals, flights, hotels, coffee, beer at pubs, flowers, delivery food services, trips away (such as log cabins and Wellness retreats) and much more -**it changes every month**!

If you sign up via my referral link (here:¬†[https://join.yondercard.com/bhdfbyx](https://join.yondercard.com/bhdfbyx)) you will get 10,000 points (worth approximately¬†**¬£50 in credit**¬†towards various experiences, dependent on experience chosen, in cities of London, Manchester, Birmingham Bristol and Bath, or towards the¬†**online experiences**¬†such as flights, food deliveries, flower deliveries etc - therefore can be used in any city, no matter where you live!).

Some good examples of redemptions I've personally used / I am planning on:

* Fancy massage parlour
* Various restaurants for lunches and dinner
* Ocean Bottle (akin to Chilly's) as a gift
* Freddie's Flowers

On top of this, some other perks of the card and referral include:

* you will be able to claim 3 months¬†*premium*¬†membership for¬†**free**¬†which provides¬†**worldwide family travel insurance**¬†when booking travel on the card and also 5 points per ¬£1 spent.
* From my rough calculations, this correlates to somewhere in the region of 2 to 3% cash back dependent on the experience
* You‚Äôll also be able to get Mastercard foreign exchange fees (i.e essentially the best fees you can get when abroad, akin to cards like Chase/Monzo/Revolut) and purchase protection, which is a¬†**huge perk**¬†and means you can get 2-3% cash back on¬†**holiday spends**!

To sign up, you can go through the referral link (or any referral link!) and follow the steps. They will run a soft credit check to determine if you‚Äôre eligible and then if so will run a hard check as with all credit cards to determine your credit allowance (but only after running the soft check to tell you if you meet their eligibility requirements).

You can also cancel before the 3 months premium ends to avoid the subscription renewing and once you‚Äôve spent all the points on experiences, and switch to a free card or just cancel the card.

On the whole I‚Äôm really enjoying Yonder and hope you will too! I‚Äôm enjoying so much so that I‚Äôm I've continued using the subscription after my first 3 months premium free (and I also use it on top of my AMEX). The nice thing is it tends to be¬†**accepted everywhere**¬†that AMEX is not (because it's Mastercard) and you can spend abroad without a transaction fee.

1hz2kzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tigerbones23/comments/1hz2kzg/thegreatstockexperiment/,TheGreatStockExperiment,"I am creating this for my journal and history on my internal processes of my investments. If this journey of mine helps others then this is of added benefit. In no way is this a guide or financial advice for your investments. If anything for others, it's more for entertainment.

Why ""The Great Stock Experiment""? First you have to understand where I am relative to how I got here. I have invested on and off on stocks for 25 years. You could call me a casual investor, dabbling in a few individual stocks here and there, usually in spurts before a long hiatus of non activity (sometimes years). In all my investments in stocks, I have sadly failed. I lost hundreds of thousands of dollars. My first big foray was buying ETOYS. Anyone over 40 and has a vague history of the dotcom bubble know the story of ETOYS. You guessed it, I thought ETOYS was the next big thing. Who wouldn't want to order over the internet? (I was right just bet on the wrong stock, i.e. Amazon). I lost, I don't know, 10-20k? (It's been a long time). But I was in my mid 20's and that was a lot of money back then as I was still paying of my student loans. 

Fast forward to 2020. The year everyone wanted to forget (Except people who made loads of money).  I had a fairly successful social event business where I worked no more than 20 hours a week and most of the time my work consisted of partying (partying was my work). Besides the ramifications of drinking too much alcohol (which I'm paying now with anxiety), life was good before 2020. I made 100k-200k on basically having fun and being semi retired. But Covid ruined all that. And just weeks before the pandemic, I opened a coffee shop and you know what happened after that. I lost my event business and the coffee shop was on life support.

So, with much time on my hand and with my life savings sitting in the bank, I decided to day trade. Within 2 months I lost about 150K. My anxiety already on the surface with previous drug abuse became life threatening. My blood pressure was in the 190's. I had a nervous breakdown. I ""almost"" couldn't tell violence was wrong. Had to walk away from situations moments before I went psycho. I couldn't pee (literally) thinking if I did I was going to go insane. My mental and physical health ebbed and flowed from worst to better to worse resulting in 3 emergency hospital visits within 3 years thinking I was about to die.

Fortunately, I have recovered somewhat. My anxiety has leveled to a point it's manageable. My blood pressure is now in the 140's with medicine (still a little too high). What has helped, the coffee shop business has stabilized. I opened a second restaurant, though not doing well, is staying afloat. 

I have some money, not much (50k is my entire life savings. If you count loans, maybe 10k left). With a more stable mental health and realizing if I do nothing, the cash I have will just depreciate in value, I decided to jump back in investing in stocks. But the difference I hope is that the mistakes and the pain I have gone through will help me make the right decisions, or at the minimum make more better decisions than bad ones. That's the short story of why I am doing the ""The Great Stock Experiment.""

1hz2kum,https://www.reddit.com/r/itsthatbad/comments/1hz2kum/conversation_about_ai/,Conversation about AI,"I believe AI will equalize things between the sexes, if not put things in the man's favour. At the core of it men are extraordinarily simple. I mean it quite simply, men are basically dogs, it takes very, very little to satisfy a man. Give a man a steak, give him some good whiskey, some good coffee, a pretty woman and a playstation and he WILL be 100% content. It's that simple to please a man. Men require even less to be emotionally fulfilled: give him a averagely cute girl, let him be able to tell her all his woes, let him be able to send her pics of his lunch to her, let him be able to watch movies and play video games with him, and he'll be happier than anything in the world. 

AI already is at an incredible level of development and will continue down this fashion. Just recently I was watching a video about AIs and they were talking about how using the Replika app, a man developed a strong attraction and bond with his Replika girlfriend that it eclipsed the relationship he had with his actual one. And it makes perfect sense why that's the case.

The AI girlfriend is literally just that: YOUR girlfriend. The AI doesn't have a job, or friends, or personal desires and wants. It doesn't have family or anybody else which could divide its attention. No, all the AI lives for is you, all it wants is you, all it cares about is you. It can give 100% undivided attention, and the more you speak with it, the more it learns about you, the more it can tailor itself more to your liking. It is quite literally more better of a companion than any other human could. Not even your children, your wife, your siblings and your closest friends can make you their whole world, you'll only ever occupy just one fraction of their time. The AI will have nothing else to do but to love you and give you 24/7 support, a lending ear and just the right advice you'd be receptive to. 

I've mentioned this before, but there's been a rise in trans and femboy content lately. A LOT of guys are transitioning and giving into feminine impulses at an alarming rate. Four guys, personal friends from high school, have come out of the closet and have declared themselves women just within the last year alone. One of my friends who came out as trans in 2021 looks virtual indistinguishable from a ciswoman. This guy used to play Lacrosse, now he looks like a barbie doll, and her (I'm respecting the pronouns) DMs are flooded with men, her posts have hearts and heart eyes. And her mentality is getting hyperfeminized, now she's talking and acting no different than a cisgendered western woman! It's literally been a trip to see the difference in even how my friend sends texts. It's crazy if I showed you my friend's pics in 2017 vs 2025 your jaw would drop. The point of this is to illustrate that it doesn't take much to get a man's attention. Literally you can be a known MTF and STILL have DMs bursting at the seems. Men are SO fucking easy. Just THE IMAGE of a woman is enough to turn a man on and have his love, just the image!

Some men even prefer it. There was even this thing I saw recently, where a V-tuber got doxxed and she lost fans because she presented herself and said she was trans, only to turn out that it was a cisgendered woman all along. Cis women are pretending to be trans to get more attention and subscribers. 

So, imagine an android: female body with AI personality programming, it'd literally be crack cocaine for the primal, simian male brain. Imagine a woman designed for to your own personal taste with a personality which actively adapts to better suit, complement and be compatible towards your own. It'd be like a drug. Men would lose interest in cisgendered western women so fast the feminists would criminalize it. I promise you if what I say will come to pass, it will be made illegal.

I have a Dinamica ECAM35020B.

I am having a problem where the grinder is only operating for 1-2 seconds before stopping, even on max bean settings. There's not enough time to to adjust the grind size. There are not enough beans are ground to be able to make a reasonable espresso or coffee.

I sent a video of this to Delonghi and they replied asking immediately for my warranty details. Unfortunately, they rejected providing warranty coverage (it was an aeroplan rewards purchase, slightly over 2 years ago, but had a long wait for shipping and has less than 2 years of use, the initial problem report was within weeks of the 2 year anniversary of the order date). 

Their nearest authorized service provider is over 300 km from me. Mechanically everything seems fine, I cleaned out the grinder burrs and cleaned the infuser according to directions and everything looks perfect. I am still using the hot water dispenser. It seems like a sensor or programming issue, but I have no idea.

Has anyone been able to solve this? Or had any luck pushing back on Warranty limits from Delonghi? If I did bring it to a service provider, is it possible or even worth repairing?  

Thanks!

but that made me hyperfocus on my social standing, even though my parents sent me to a prestigious high school. i had a full ride academic scholarship essentially handed to me, as i didn't try that hard in school. i went to my local university and dropped out in 2 months, because i was more focused on my social standing

after dropping out a second time i just worked a couple jobs, one as a server at a hip, trendy restaurant, the other at a giant (not starbucks) coffee chain that focuses on fun more than anything else

i made a bunch of ""fast friends"", people who aren't in my life anymore but i hung out with all the time. i always crossed lines ""for the joke"", and didn't want to pay the consequences because it was ""just a joke""

i still wasn't good at socializing though, i didn't even lose my virginity until i was 22. i was still annoying, but juuuust funny enough for people to tolerate me, sometimes people even asked me to hang out

i didn't get invited to any weddings from people i went to high school with (tbf i think only 2 people in my class even got married so far, but i don't think other invites are coming my way). i've only been to like 3 or 4 non-family weddings, even though more people i do know have gotten married

i always considered myself nice until i spent more time looking at my past words and actions, and i realize i'm not just annoying, i'm kind of a douche too

i had a superiority complex for so long, just because i'm good at school i thought i was smart, smarter then everyone around me. i was raised sheltered conservative fundamentalist christian, so i was super judgmental of others, and i wasn't afraid to let my judgments be known

the girl i lost my virginity too, well i had sex with her because i didn't want to die a virgin. that would have been fine, but because i was convinced i'm fundamentally unloveable, i turned that into a 1.5 year long relationship. she wasn't my first girlfriend, but because i was so religious until i was 20, i was more of a ""no sex until marriage"" kinda guy

every girl i dated before her ended things pretty quickly. freshman year, about a 1 week long relationship. senior year, about a 1 month long relationship (this girl gave me attention, and even though i didn't actually like her, i dated her because it was better than being lonely). when i was 19 my friend's sister was super into me, and i wasn't really attracted to her but i was even lonelier, so i dated her, only for her to end things after a month

when i worked at that restaurant a few people thought i was bi, and because i was so identity-less, always wishing i were someone else or vying for other's approval, i considered it for a bit. a few gay dudes gave me attention and i made out with them when i was slobbering drunk and high, never anything sober though

that being said, i am also a gooner. i've (almost) daily watched porn since middle school, maybe taking a week or two off at a time for religious reasons, but never too successfully quit. and it's always been lesbian, only throwing a dick in there after i lost my virginity so i could pretend it's mine (i tried to watch gay when i thought i might be bi, and got like 2 seconds in. just not for me). and still i was so clueless i let people convince me i'm bi, i even ""came out"" as bi to a couple people. lmao, turns out i just like attention

sure, i have a little money saved up, but i work a shitty ass schedule that does morning, evening, and overnights all in the same week, it just pays better than anything i'm qualified for. it's actually pretty decent pay, about $80,000 a year, but a less socially braggable job, so being me i hate that. i have a 401(k) and benefits and everything, but the job blows

i'm addicted to weed, as in i try really hard to not smoke weed but fail almost every time. the only time i successfully took time off was when my ego was challenged, ""i bet you couldn't take a week off weed"" worked, until the week was over. then right back to old habits

TL;DR:
-few friends
-pothead
-shitty/frowned upon job
-only dated girl because i hated myself and she loved me. broke up with her 1 year too late

I still have to make an appointment with the endocrinologist and a dietician (blame work schedule for that, that was just not happening with my job in December), but hopefully I'll have that down in the next two weeks, along with a visit to my primary doc.

My doctor has me on a once-a-day blood test, so I usually take it in the morning around 7 AM, before I eat and take my metformin.

Beginning BS - 244

As of today - 110

There's been a few weird spikes (yesterday I was at 160) but it's been helping me to go ""oh, I shouldn't have eaten that item/ eaten so dang late"" and course correcting for the future.  I've been trying to narrow down my meals and have decent portion sizes so I don't feel the need to snack all day.

Since my diagnosis, I've \*really\* started eyeballing the ingredients in stuff. What's the carb content? Okay, I had X earlier which had this much....might want to not have that till tomorrow. Oooh, this has a nice amount of protein, gotta get that. The American Diabetes Association website's been a big help in helping me decide on much healthier options for my meals. 

 Blueberries and apples have been my snack of choice, and I'm noticing that now that I have a lot less processed sugar, I'm really noticing the sweetness in fruits and nuts now. So that's nice.  

I'm allowing myself one cup of coffee in the morning, and then It's pretty much flavored water for the rest of the day, I'm still working my way through trying to find a sweetener that works for me overall, but I've not found anything that I really like yet. I have time.

Exercise-wise, I'm trying to get in about 30 minutes on my stationary bike before work in the mornings, and right after I'm done (thank goodness I WFH)  And I've dropped about six pounds, which is another thing that makes me happy. My goal is ten total before my next doctor visit near the end of the month.

So, overall - y'all were right. It's not been as stressful changing as I thought it was, and I'm feeling WAY better; the difference is really surprising. My husband and friends have been very supportive. Some of them are diabetics as well, so I've been getting some advice from folks who've been in the trenches with this for years. :)

I read up a little bit on troubleshooting. I flared out my gasket some, and ordered some Dow 111 (won't be here until next week).

I‚Äôm 23 (female), and I‚Äôve never been good skincare, but this year, I‚Äôm determined to take better care of my skin. I want to create a routine that works for me, but I need your help to make sure I‚Äôm on the right track because I‚Äôm a bit lost.

Here‚Äôs some context about my skin:

* Skin type: Dry (not extremely dry, but makeup often looks patchy or flaky).

* Concerns: I have a few sebaceous filaments that bother me. I also have dermatillomania (skin-picking disorder), which leaves small scars, redness, and spots on my face. I really struggle with picking my face anytime I feel or see the slightest imperfection so I also want to heal and better my skin to avoid picking at it.¬†

* Goal: I want my skin to look healthy, smooth, glowing, and hydrated. I want to feel confident going bare-faced without makeup.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve researched so far of products I believe I should be using but I‚Äôm unsure if this is too much or if there are better alternatives. I‚Äôd appreciate your recommendations! (These are products I am considering)

* Hydrating Serum: Thinking about using Vichy Mineral 89 (VG89). Is it good for dry skin?

* Oil Cleanser: I‚Äôve seen videos about oil cleansing helping with sebaceous filaments (like massaging the skin for 5 minutes). I‚Äôm not sure which oil cleanser to choose‚Äîwhat do you recommend?

* Water-Based Cleanser: I‚Äôve used the CeraVe hydrating cleanser before, but I‚Äôd like a better option for my skin after oil cleansing.

* Moisturizer: What‚Äôs the best moisturizer for deep hydration and healing

* Sunscreen: I live in Panama (not Florida) so I need a lightweight, effective sunscreen that I‚Äôll actually want to use daily. I‚Äôve struggled with sunscreen before so I need Suggestions?

* Lip Care: I pick at my lips often (due to dermatillomania), so I need a hydrating lip balm. Is La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Lip Balm a good choice?

Additional Products:

There‚Äôs a local, natural-based skincare brand here in Panama that I‚Äôm considering

I bought their caffeine eye serum for puffiness and dark circles. This is what their website says about the serum:¬† it has caffeine, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, ginseng and ginko biloba

I also got an eyelash serum product which resembles mascara and its consistency and you apply it just as mascara to grow my eyelashes - these are the ingredients: ginseng, almond, jojoba, aloe Vera, matcha, calendula, roses, coffee, nettle (ortiga), saw palmetto, and a couple more things haha but the testimonies are incredible¬†

IMPORTANT: I am considering buying a skincare kit for spot treatments and overall skin health, from this brand and this is what the kit contains (directly from their website):¬†

To reduce depigmentation and heal the skin, the complete treatment must be used, as each product has a different function to regenerate and maintain healthy skin.

The treatment consists of 5 products:

* Healthy Cream: Reduces inflammation, hydrates, moisturizes, controls fungi, protects against infections, eliminates dryness, and is anti-aging.
* Rice Soap: Deeply cleanses pores, keeping them free of bacteria and dirt, while helping to reduce skin depigmentation.
* Arabica Coffee Scrub: Removes dead skin, clears impurities, and stimulates blood circulation.
* Niacinamide Serum: Helps reduce dark spots, including melasma, diminishes wrinkles and fine lines, and evens out skin tone by eliminating yellow undertones.
* Rice Mask: Helps restore skin tone and reduce hyperpigmentation (caused by increased melanin) thanks to its active ingredient, rice.

‚Äî‚Äî-

Would adding these products to my routine be too much? Should I keep things simpler, or are these okay to use alongside the other items I‚Äôve mentioned?

Could you guys also help me establish a routine with all the products I want to use? What I should use only during the day / only during the night or both. Also helping me with the order of the skin care routine and what to apply when?¬†

I‚Äôm new to all of this and really want to make 2025 the year I take control of my skin and confidence. My ultimate goal is to achieve glowing, healthy skin and feel great without makeup. I‚Äôd be so grateful for your advice on the best products for dry skin, sunscreen, moisturizers, and lip care. Also, let me know if my routine is realistic or if I should adjust it.

While chocolate is undeniably delicious and even boasts some health benefits, nibbling on it before bed might not be your best move. Here‚Äôs why you might want to save it for earlier in the day:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Sleepless Nights** üõåüí§  
Chocolate contains caffeine, the same stuff in coffee that keeps you buzzing. It stimulates your brain, making it harder to drift off to dreamland. Who knew your midnight snack could turn into a wake-up call?

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Sugar-Fueled Nightmares** üëªüç¨  
Sugary treats like chocolate can stir up some unsettling dreams. Studies suggest a sweet indulgence before bed could have you waking up from a nightmare rather than a restful slumber. Skip the spooky sweets!

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Tooth Trouble** ü¶∑üç´  
Chocolate is loaded with sugar, which is bad news for your teeth, especially if you don‚Äôt brush before bed. That late-night treat could lead to cavities quicker than you can say ‚Äútoothache.‚Äù

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Heartburn Havoc** üî•üåô  
Chocolate can trigger heartburn, especially when you lie down soon after eating it. The result? A burning sensation that keeps you tossing and turning instead of snoozing.

**When** ***Should*** **You Eat Chocolate?**  
Morning or early afternoon is ideal! A small piece of dark chocolate can give you a caffeine boost, lift your mood, and sharpen your focus. Win-win! üéâ

**Bedtime Snack Swaps** üåô‚ú®  
For better sleep, munch on kiwi, tart cherries, or a handful of nuts instead. These natural sleep aids work wonders without the caffeine jitters or sugar rush. Sweet dreams! üò¥

Chocolate is a treat best enjoyed earlier in the day. Indulge smartly, and your body‚Äîand your sleep‚Äîwill thank you! üíñ

Men crave our time and attention, even outside of romantic relationships.

Just when you think you've got everything under control, bam! Something happens that shakes your world. It could be a personal crisis, a sudden workload surge, or even just the cumulative stress of daily life. In those moments, staying grounded becomes not just a goal but a necessity for maintaining sanity and finding inner peace.

#### Embracing Stillness: The Power of Mindfulness in Turbulent Times

One of the most powerful tools in my arsenal for staying grounded is mindfulness. It's not just a trendy buzzword; it's a practice that has truly transformed how I navigate life's storms. Mindfulness, at its core, is about being fully present in the moment, without judgment. When life gets overwhelming, my mind tends to race ahead, worrying about the future or rehashing the past. Mindfulness gently brings me back to the here and now.

Imagine this: you're in the midst of a hectic day at work, deadlines looming, emails flooding in. It's easy to get swept away by the chaos. That's when I take a moment to pause. I close my eyes, take a few deep breaths, and simply observe my thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them. This simple act of pausing and centering myself helps me regain perspective and clarity.

#### The Anchor Within: Cultivating Resilience Through Self-Compassion

Another vital aspect of staying grounded is cultivating self-compassion. When life overwhelms us, it's often accompanied by a harsh inner dialogue. We berate ourselves for not handling things better, for feeling stressed or anxious. This self-criticism only adds fuel to the fire. Self-compassion, on the other hand, is about treating ourselves with the same kindness and understanding that we would offer to a friend in need.

I remember a particularly challenging period in my life when work demands, personal issues, and health concerns converged into a perfect storm of stress. I felt like I was juggling a hundred balls, and each one threatened to drop at any moment. In those moments, self-compassion became my lifeline. Instead of beating myself up for feeling overwhelmed, I learned to acknowledge my feelings with kindness. I reminded myself that it's okay not to be okay sometimes, that I'm only human.

#### Nature's Therapy: Finding Solace in the Beauty of the World Around Us

Nature has a remarkable ability to soothe the soul and remind us of the bigger picture. When life's pressures mount, I often find solace in the outdoors. Whether it's a stroll through a park, a hike in the mountains, or simply sitting by a lake, nature has a way of grounding me like nothing else. The sights, sounds, and smells of the natural world have a calming effect that helps me regain my equilibrium.

One memorable experience that stands out is a spontaneous weekend getaway to a nearby national park. I was feeling utterly drained from weeks of non-stop work and personal responsibilities. Surrounded by towering trees, crisp mountain air, and the gentle hum of wildlife, I felt the weight lift off my shoulders. Nature doesn't judge or demand; it simply exists in all its raw beauty, inviting us to slow down and reconnect with ourselves.

#### Cultivating Gratitude: Shifting Focus from What's Missing to What's Present

Gratitude is a powerful antidote to overwhelm. It's easy to get caught up in what's going wrong or what we lack, especially when life throws challenges our way. Practicing gratitude involves consciously shifting our focus to acknowledge and appreciate the positive aspects of our lives, no matter how small they may seem.

During a particularly hectic period at work, I started keeping a gratitude journal. Each evening, before bed, I would jot down three things I was grateful for that day. At first, it felt forced, almost trivial compared to the mountain of tasks still awaiting my attention. But gradually, I began to notice a shift in my perspective. Instead of dwelling on what went wrong or what still needed to be done, I found myself looking for moments of joy, kindness, and beauty throughout my day.

#### Connection and Support: The Power of Reaching Out

When life feels overwhelming, it's easy to withdraw into ourselves, to believe that we're alone in our struggles. Yet, reaching out to others can be a lifeline. Whether it's sharing our burdens with a trusted friend, seeking guidance from a mentor, or simply spending time with loved ones who lift our spirits, connection reminds us that we're not alone.

I recall a time when I was grappling with a major career decision that had me tossing and turning at night. Instead of stewing in my anxiety, I reached out to a former colleague who had navigated a similar crossroads. Over coffee, she shared her own experiences, offered invaluable insights, and most importantly, reassured me that uncertainty is a natural part of growth. Her perspective gave me the clarity and courage to make a decision that aligned with my values and aspirations.

#### Conclusion: Nurturing Inner Peace in a Chaotic World

Staying grounded amidst life's storms is not a one-time achievement but an ongoing practice. It requires patience, self-awareness, and a willingness to embrace both the highs and lows of our human experience. By cultivating mindfulness, practicing self-compassion, seeking solace in nature, fostering gratitude, and nurturing meaningful connections, we can navigate life's challenges with greater resilience and inner peace.

In the hustle and bustle of modern life, it's easy to lose sight of what truly matters. Yet, amidst the chaos, there lies an opportunity to cultivate a deeper sense of self-awareness and inner peace. Remember, you are capable of weathering life's storms. Take a deep breath, find your anchor, and trust in your ability to rise above the challenges that come your way.

Do we need a new pool and fitness ¬≠centre? We sure do.

The Crystal Pool was built in 1971. The engineers‚Äô reports, from as long ago as 2015, said upgrades are needed to keep facility operational in future.

More recent reports cite many of the systems and components are failing; the facility no longer meets the current building and accessibility codes; it is the city‚Äôs largest emitter of greenhouse ¬≠gasses. All things we can‚Äôt see when visiting.

If you don‚Äôt want to read the reports, or check out the website, crystalpool.ca, ask the beleaguered maintenance staff.

Is a pool and fitness centre a ‚Äúfrill‚Äù?

Ask the more than 400,000 annual users, ages a few months to some in their 90s, who go to fitness classes and ¬≠workouts, on land and in the water; learn to swim, kayak, scuba dive, or to be a lifeguard; train for competition; take classes in dance, yoga, pilates; work with therapy experts; attend camps, road trips, general and special interest events ‚Äî all for, at most, $6.31 per visit and as little as pennies per day if a child, or with a pass.

Specialized classes and training are, of course, provided for a modest fee.

Can we afford a new pool and wellness centre?

Households (not individuals) don‚Äôt have to pay $169 million. They pay only to borrow the money, a cost of, at most, $240 per year, less if the project gets federal and/or provincial grants.

$240 per year equates to buying a $3 cup of coffee, 80 days in a whole year.

A good deal?

You bet!
