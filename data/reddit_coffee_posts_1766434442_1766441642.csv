Despite advice to tidy up for clarity, my messy workspace somehow seemed to fuel my imagination in ways a neat desk never did. That made me wonder — could creative messes actually be the secret sauce for better ideas? Throw in colors and their psychological effects, and suddenly, a chaotic table becomes a playground for the mind.
The Unlikely Ally: How Messy Desks Foster Creative Thinking

If you were to peek at my desk right now, you’d probably see a whirlwind of color and chaos—sketches piled on top of notebooks, sticky notes with half-formed ideas, and pens scattered like confetti. For years, I tried to tame this creative mess, believing a tidy workspace was the secret to workplace productivity. But over time, I discovered that my cluttered desk was more than just a sign of busyness—it was an unlikely ally in my creative journey.
Personal Chaos, Unexpected Inspiration

I remember one afternoon when a looming deadline had me feeling stuck. My desk was a patchwork of coffee mugs, color charts, and scribbled notes. As I reached for a pen, my hand brushed against an old doodle I’d forgotten about. That accidental discovery sparked a new idea, completely changing the direction of my project. It was a reminder that creative messes aren’t just distractions—they’re fertile ground for spontaneous inspiration.

This isn’t just my experience. Many creative thinkers share stories of their best ideas emerging from the colorful chaos of their workspaces. Messy tables mean busy imaginations, and sometimes, the most unexpected connections are born from the jumble of our everyday tools.
Messiness Signals an Active Imagination

There’s something powerful about a desk that’s alive with activity. When I see scattered sketches and open books, I don’t see disorder—I see evidence of a mind in motion. Messiness signals an active imagination, one that isn’t afraid to break from conventional thinking patterns. In fact, creative thinking often thrives in environments that embrace unpredictability.

When everything is perfectly organized, it’s easy to fall into routines and predictable solutions. But a little chaos invites curiosity. It encourages us to make connections between unrelated ideas, to experiment, and to take risks. As Scott Adams once said:
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep.

A messy desk is a visual reminder that mistakes and experiments are not only allowed—they’re essential to the creative process.
Science Behind the Mess: Creative Thinking and Workplace Productivity

Research backs up what many of us have felt intuitively: moderate chaos can actually boost creative thinking and workplace productivity. Studies suggest that a cluttered environment encourages divergent thinking—the ability to generate many different ideas in response to a single problem. This kind of thinking is at the heart of innovation.

 	
Messy tables correlate with busy imaginations: When our surroundings are a little unpredictable, our minds become more open to new possibilities.

 	
Freedom from strict order: Creativity thrives when we aren’t boxed in by rigid rules about how things should look or be arranged.

 	
Spontaneous idea generation: The random juxtapositions of objects, notes, and sketches can lead to surprising insights and solutions.


One study even found that people working in slightly messy rooms were more likely to come up with creative uses for everyday objects than those in tidy spaces. The unpredictability of a creative mess seems to nudge our brains into thinking differently, breaking free from the usual patterns.
Embracing the Colorful Chaos of Innovation

When I let go of the pressure to keep everything perfectly in order, I found more freedom to explore, experiment, and innovate. My desk became a canvas, not just for my work, but for my imagination. The colorful chaos that once seemed like a flaw turned out to be a feature—a sign that my mind was busy, my ideas were flowing, and my creativity was alive.

So the next time you find yourself surrounded by a creative mess, remember: that clutter might just be the unlikely ally you need to spark your next big idea.

 
Color Psychology: The Invisible Force Shaping Our Workspaces

Colors, like features, follow the changes of the emotions. – Pablo Picasso

When I walk into a workspace, the first thing I notice isn’t the furniture or the gadgets—it’s the colors. The walls, the chairs, even the sticky notes scattered across a messy table, all quietly influence how I feel and how I think. This is the invisible force of color psychology at work, shaping our moods, our focus, and even our capacity for innovation.
How Color Psychology Influences Mood and Focus

We often underestimate just how much our surroundings impact us. Yet, research shows that the colors in our environment have a direct effect on our mood influence, focus enhancement, and even employee well-being. Whether I’m brainstorming wild ideas or buckling down for deep work, the colors around me can either energize or drain my creativity.
Blue: The Calm Catalyst for Focus

Blue is my go-to color when I need to clear my mind and get things done. Science backs this up—blue hues are proven to reduce heart rate and eye strain, making them ideal for concentration-heavy tasks. I’ve noticed that a splash of blue in my workspace helps me feel calm and centered, especially during stressful deadlines. It’s no wonder that so many offices use blue to create a sense of mental clarity and reduce stress.

 	
Blue reduces heart rate and eye strain, improving concentration.

 	
Perfect for meeting rooms or quiet zones where focus is key.

 	
Encourages a sense of trust and dependability among teams.


Green: The Innovator’s Oasis

Whenever I’m seeking balance or a fresh perspective, I gravitate toward green. There’s something about this color that feels both grounding and invigorating. Green not only minimizes eye strain—making it easy on the eyes during long work sessions—but also fosters mental clarity and innovative thinking. I find that a touch of green, whether from a plant or a painted wall, helps ideas flow more freely and supports creative problem-solving.

 	
Green fosters mental clarity and innovative thinking.

 	
Supports eye comfort, reducing fatigue during creative work.

 	
Encourages a balanced, harmonious atmosphere for collaboration.


Yellow: The Spark of Optimism and Creativity

Yellow is the color I turn to when I need a burst of energy or a shot of optimism. It’s the color of sticky notes, highlighters, and the first rays of morning sun streaming onto my desk. Yellow stimulates energy and creativity, making it perfect for brainstorming sessions or spaces where big ideas are born. But I’ve learned that too much yellow can be overwhelming, even anxiety-inducing, so I use it sparingly—just enough to inspire without distracting.

 	
Yellow stimulates energy and optimism but excessive use may cause anxiety.

 	
Best for accent walls, creative corners, or collaborative zones.

 	
Encourages enthusiasm and a positive outlook.

Warm Tones: Energizing Colors for Enthusiasm

I’ve also found that warm tones like orange can inject enthusiasm and warmth into a workspace, especially during group brainstorming. These energizing colors are perfect for sparking lively discussions and encouraging participation, but like yellow, they’re most effective in moderation.

Every color tells a story and sets the stage for how we work, think, and feel. By understanding and intentionally applying the principles of color psychology, we can create workspaces that not only look vibrant but also nurture our employee well-being, boost our focus, and unleash our creative potential.

 


Designing Creative Spaces: More Than Just Aesthetics

When I think about the most inspiring offices I’ve worked in, they’re never the ones with spotless desks and bland, white walls. Instead, it’s the creative spaces filled with bursts of color, scattered sketches, and the hum of collaboration that truly spark my imagination. It’s become clear to me that office design is about so much more than just looking good—it’s about creating an environment where ideas can flourish, where people feel energized, and where workplace productivity and employee well-being are woven into the very fabric of the space.

There’s a certain magic that happens when creative messes and color come together. I’ve seen firsthand how a messy table can mean busy imaginations at work. When we allow for a bit of chaos—papers spread out, color swatches everywhere, whiteboards filled with half-formed ideas—we’re actually giving ourselves permission to think freely and take risks. This colorful chaos isn’t just a sign of disorder; it’s a sign of innovation in action.

Modern office design trends are finally catching up to this idea. We’re moving away from the sterile, all-white environments of the past and embracing warmer, muted hues that reflect the unique identity of each company. These colors aren’t just for show—they have a real impact on how we feel and work. For example, warm tones like oranges and yellows can boost positivity and enthusiasm, especially during group brainstorming sessions. I’ve noticed that when our collaborative spaces are filled with vibrant tones, people are more likely to speak up, share ideas, and connect with their teammates. It’s as if the colors themselves are encouraging us to be bolder and more creative.

But it’s not all about bright colors and energy. There’s also a place for neutral, earthy tones in the office. These shades, inspired by nature, are a key part of biophilic design—a trend that brings the calming influence of the outdoors inside. In my experience, these spaces help reduce stress and support deeper concentration, making them perfect for focused work zones or quiet corners where employees can recharge. It’s a beautiful balance: vibrant, collaborative spaces for teamwork and muted, natural areas for solo work and relaxation.

Another thoughtful touch I’ve seen is the use of color coding in office layouts. By assigning different colors to different departments or zones, we make navigation easier and help teams feel a sense of identity and belonging. It’s a simple strategy, but it can transform the way people interact with their workspace—and with each other.

All of these design choices—embracing creative messes, using color intentionally, and creating collaborative spaces—have a direct impact on workplace productivity and employee well-being. When people feel comfortable and inspired by their surroundings, they’re more likely to do their best work. They’re also more likely to feel connected to their company’s culture and to each other. As Steve Jobs once said,
Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.

In the end, designing creative spaces is about more than just aesthetics. It’s about understanding how our environment shapes our mood, our interactions, and our ability to innovate. By embracing a little bit of mess, infusing our offices with color, and creating spaces that invite collaboration and focus, we’re not just making our workplaces look better—we’re making them work better for everyone. The next time you see a messy table or a splash of unexpected color in your office, remember: this is where the magic of innovation begins.

TL;DR: Messy creative spaces combined with thoughtful use of color in office design can boost focus, creativity, and mood, enhancing overall workplace productivity and employee well-being. https://www.papublishing.com/why-creative-messes-spark-better-ideas/",1,1766441514.0,business_small_big,0,1.0,False

Musically heavy and rage-filled, it is a very aggressive song in terms of both the instrumentals and the lyrics. In the song’s liner notes in *Music Bank*, (kindly uploaded to [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Alice_in_Chains_Music_Bank#/media/File:Aic-music-bank-liner-notes-1-6.jpg) by u/PossiblePast) Jerry wrote about the inspiration for the song: *“It’s about that fight I had with Sean. ... I was being an immature prick and I basically deserved what I got. ... I kept on bugging \[Sean\] for a ride until he got so mad he picked up a coffee table and broke it over my head! My retaliation was writing this song.”*

**I broke you in the canyon / I drowned you in the lake —** This song has kind of a lot of geographical features in it. Just saying. **You, the snake that I would trample / Only thing I’d not embrace —** I think this is a reference to a line in the Bible about defeating enemies. “*I have given you power to tread serpents and scorpions underfoot, and to trample on all the power of the Enemy*” (Luke 10:19)

**Oh, you couldn’t dam that river —** Genius says that the ‘river’ is blood flowing uncontrollably. Anyone who’s seen a head injury play out knows that heads bleed like crazy, and a coffee table to the skull wouldn’t exactly be gentle.

**And maybe I don’t give a damn anyway —** This is obviously a pun about dam/damn. It also indicates that Jerry (the narrator) was no longer mad at Sean (the subject) by the time he wrote the song.

**So you couldn’t dam that river / And it washed me so far away** — Genius suggests that being ‘washed so far away’ refers to losing consciousness, in addition to being another pun about how an undammed river could literally wash you away.

**I pushed and then you stumbled / I kicked you in the face / You stared at me so hollow / Got to keep that killing pace** — The last two verses seem to be a description of things that happened during the fight, some literal and some figurative.

**I burned the place around you / I hit you with a rake / You piss upon my candle / So proving you’re a fake —** I’m not sure what these mean exactly, but I think the idea is pretty clear. TL;DR, this guy is pissed.

Next time on Story of the song: Rain When I Die! So far, I’ve found a lot to work with in terms of the lyrics. It should be out by the 25th.",1,1766441354.0,AliceInChains,0,1.0,False
1ptcht2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ptcht2/aitah_for_not_making_my_dad_a_cup_of_tea/,AITAH for not making my dad a cup of tea?,"Okay bear with me. This happened a few years ago and I'm using a throwaway. I was just randomly thinking about this 'incident', for lack of a better word, while talking to a friend who grew up with parents with a similar culture but different background, so it made me wonder if this was genuinely me being rude / a social faux pas or if I was justified here.

So I (21F) was raised in the UK but ethnically, I'm from a southern African country and my parents, while not necessarily strict themselves, have a very conservative African mindset.

I must've been around 14/15ish at the time (this was around 6+ years ago), and I accompanied my parents to visit my aunt and uncle in Cambridge, and they have 3 young kids of their own. At this point, I hadn't been to their house in over 8 or so years, since I was a kid, so it was effectively like a stranger's home to me. I also have a younger sister who's 6 years younger than me, so she would've been around 9/10 at the time (not that relevant, but for the purposes of context and setting the scene here).

So we arrive at our relatives' house after a 4+ hour drive, everyone greets each other, ""how's school""-type questions for me, cool cool. I'm sat on my Nintendo not bothering anyone, and my mum and aunt later go upstairs to set up sleeping arrangements for the younger kids. In that time, it's just me, my younger sister, my dad, and my uncle remaining in the living room. My dad, midway through conversation with my uncle, turns to me and says in our mother tongue ""go make me a cup of tea"" (or coffee, whatever). I looked up at him, shocked, and reply, ""you want me to raid people's cupboards when I don't know where anything is?"" ln my mind, I thought your host who knows the kitchen back to front is sat right in front of you so it's very weird that you'd request that I, who is as much a stranger to this house (or probably more so because my dad had visited more recently) as my dad go through people's cupboards to make him a brew, so it's weird to ask me? Or maybe he just felt awkward asking another man to make him a cup of tea, idk. In any case, my dad went quiet and the room fell into silence and I thought that was the end of that convo and he realised how kind of ridiculous it was to ask his teenage daughter to go rummaging in someone's kitchen. About 10 minutes later, my uncle did eventually offer us a cup of tea, which I declined and my dad accepted.

It wasn't until I was preparing to go to bed a bit later my mum pulled me aside and told me my dad had informed her that he was 'embarrassed' by me 'talking back' in front of my uncle...because I asked him if he expects me to raid people's cupboards. She asked why I didn't just go make the brew and I told her my reasoning: I don't know where anything is. She replied ""well you should've just asked, you don't talk back especially in front of other people"" and went into a whole tirade about how embarrassed my dad was and how he had shut up out of pure embarrassment lol. I genuinely didn't even take it this way, but am I incorrect in thinking that it's more socially acceptable for a guest to ask a host for a brew as opposed to telling their kid to go make them one? Fair enough if it was a kitchen I was familiar with and knew where things were kept, and no, in the grand scheme of things it's not that deep at all, but it did surprise me that my dad considered that 'embarrassing'? Reflecting on this 6 years later, I still don't feel like I was in the wrong or disrespectful in any way here lol, but would appreciate other people's insights. Think if I were in a similar position I'd just outright ask the host for one or ask if I'm ok to go into the kitchen to prepare  one myself and if anyone else wants one?",1,1766441348.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

It strips away fabric pills and smooths out the creases that make even the most seasoned traveler look like a lost backpacker. There’s something beautiful about the simplicity. One flick of the wrist, one pass of the device, and suddenly the chaos of the road looks a little more intentional. No need for overpriced hotel pressing or frantic last-minute wardrobe swaps. Just plug it in, or if it’s battery-powered, flip the switch and take back control of your wardrobe like a true renegade with a passport.

A quality travel fabric shaver weighs less than a paperback and takes up about as much space as a power adapter. Some models even combine both fabric-shaving and steaming abilities, letting you handle any sartorial emergency in minutes. Reviews show travelers giving it a quiet cult following. Those who understand the small pleasures of smooth fabric in a wrinkled world. It’s not about looking perfect. It’s about feeling like you still have a handle on things when the rest of your trip goes feral.

In the great theater of global exploration. Missed flights, street food, sunburns, and existential dread. The humble **fabric shaver is an unlikely hero**. It doesn’t boast, it doesn’t break, and it doesn’t cost more than a few airport coffees. For anyone who’s ever stared into a hotel mirror wondering when they started resembling a crushed raisin, this is redemption in handheld form. Forget the travel-sized colognes, the overpriced wrinkle sprays, the false promises of “quick-dry” travel fabrics. This tiny gadget is the truth.

Call it the traveler’s quiet rebellion against entropy. The unspoken code of those who still care about showing up to a new city looking like they belong there. And in a world constantly falling apart, airports, luggage, maybe even ourselves, sometimes it’s enough to know that at least your shirt doesn’t have to.

1ptbzif,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1ptbzif/short_story_feedback_pls/,"Short story, feedback pls :)","I recently started a creative writing course on Udemy. Although I enjoy it, the lack of feedback has made it difficult for me to improve. One of the assignments was to write a story about a phobia. After finishing it, I asked Claude for feedback and was genuinely surprised by how thorough it was. It pointed out that my story lacked emotional and sensory beats and even provided strong examples to help me improve. I rewrote the story based on that advice, but I’d really love to get feedback from a human perspective as well.

“Good morning, Ayla,"" Defne said, shuffling into their small kitchen.

""Morning, girl,"" Ayla mumbled from the couch. Defne yawned. ""God, I hate waking up so early."" She filled the kettle and grabbed her favorite mug. “Coffee?”she called out, hunting for the sugar.

""No, thanks.""

The kettle hummed to life. Defne spooned coffee grounds into her mug, then paused. She glanced over at Ayla, who was holding up a small mirror, pulling at her face with her hands.

""Girl...What are you doing?""

The kettle clicked softly.

""Do you think I look older?“

“What? No, why?”

I think I’m getting wrinkles.”

Defne poured hot water over the coffee and stirred. ""Ayla, you're twenty-one. You just had a birthday—you didn't suddenly age ten years overnight."" Defne took a sip, watching her roommate with growing concern. ""You look exactly the same as yesterday."" *This is so unlike her.*

""Come over here and look."" Ayla pointed at her under-eyes. ""See these fine lines?""

Defne leaned in closer, squinting. ""Nothing. Not even one fine line. You're twenty-one—your face is still tight like a baby's.""

Ayla looked back at the mirror. An unrecognizable older woman stared back- sunken eyes, sagging jowls, skin like crumpled paper. Her stomach dropped. *That can't be me. That can't be me.* But the woman in the mirror mimicked her every move, her every blink of horror.

""Get ready. First class is gonna start soon.""

""Yeah..."" Ayla put down the mirror with a heavy, unsettling feeling.

\---------------------

An hour later, the lecture hall was almost full, rows of students stretching behind them. Defne and Ayla sat somewhere in the middle with their notebooks open while the professor shared his knowledge in a steady voice.

""Hey."" Mira poked Defne’s arm. ""What's up with Ayla?"" she whispered.

Defne glanced left. Ayla had propped a small compact mirror against her notebook, staring into it like she was searching for something. ""She's been doing that for like... ten minutes straight,"" Mira whispered. ""It's kinda weird.""

""She's just not feeling well."" Defne leaned closer. ""Hey, you okay?""

No reaction. Ayla kept staring at the mirror, lost in her own world.

""Ayla,"" said Defne with a worried voice.

""Yes?"" Ayla looked up as if nothing was wrong.

""You okay?""

""Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.""

Ayla tried to focus on the professor, but each time she caught herself staring at her reflection again. And every time she looked, the wrinkles increased. With each passing moment, uneasiness grew within her.

She took a deep breath and looked at the presentation, but her vision pulsated from sharpness to blurriness. She glanced back at her mirror. The reflection scared her- no, terrified her. She couldn’t let anyone see her like this. What if they could see it too?

""I—"" Ayla's hand shot to her chest. ""I can't—"" ""Whoa, hey."" Defne's eyes widened. Ayla's face had gone completely pale, a sheen of sweat on her forehead. ""What's wrong?"" ""I need to go home."" Ayla's voice cracked. ""I need to go *now*."" ""Okay, okay. Do you want me to—"" But Ayla was already shoving her things into her bag, hands shaking. “Ayla..?” Defne stood up, but she already ran out of the room.

*I need to do something*, thought Ayla as she ran. *A serum? A mask? Maybe overnight anti-aging facial patches.*

She sprinted down the street, her heart pounding in her chest. She had to get home. Now.

Her breath came in ragged gasps as she rounded the corner, not looking where she was going. Suddenly, she collided hard with someone-a stranger holding a stack of flyers. The impact sent both of them stumbling backward, and the person lost their grip on a stack of flyers. Paper scattered everywhere, fluttering to the ground like confetti.

""I'm sorry!"" she gasped, barely pausing to look at the person she'd run into.

But then one of the flyers caught her eye. Bold letters at the top read: **Look Beautiful + Look Younger. Transform Your Life!**

Her breath hitched. She froze mid-step, staring at the paper at her feet.

The person picked up the flyer and handed it to Ayla. ""To make you look younger, come visit us,"" the person said with an unnaturally wide smile. Ayla froze. ""What?"" The stranger leaned closer, studying her face.’’ You could use some lifting around the eyes. Better to start early you know.” Wasn't she young? Had Defne lied to her?

""Start early..."" She whispered, the words bitter as poison on her tongue.

She crumpled the flyer, shoved it in her pocket, and ran as fast as she could. Her insecurities clawed at her mind, mixing with the panic that had been driving her forward. She didn't look back, didn't stop—she just ran, desperate to get home.

\-------------------

Defne left her last class to check on Ayla. She opened the door to their apartment and stepped inside. One of Ayla's shoes was thrown against the wall on the left, the other lying close by the door. She hung her jacket and walked into the living room.

""Ayla?""

No response.

She walked toward Ayla's room, but the bathroom caught her attention. Skincare products were scattered everywhere. Packages of face masks and bottles were thrown on the ground, and serums leaked into the basin. The well-organized, clean-fanatic Ayla would never leave it like this.

She turned around and knocked on Ayla's door. ""Ayla? Can I come in?""

Defne couldn't wait anymore. She opened the door slowly. The lights were out, and the curtains blocked the daylight, making the room dark. Ayla was lying in bed with the duvet covering everything but the top of her head.

""Are you sleeping?"" asked Defne.

""...No.""

""How are you feeling?""

""I feel a little cold. I just need some sleep.""

""Shall I call a doctor?""

""No."" Ayla pulled the duvet over her entire head.

""Do you want some tea? Or warm food?""

""No.""

Defne turned to leave but stopped when she saw the broken mirror, her reflection distorted across the shattered glass. An unsettling feeling crept in, but she just didn't know what to do.

""You can talk to me if something is bothering you. I'm here for you,"" Defne said, and left the room.

She went back to the bathroom to clean it. She *knelt in the bathroom, picking up shattered glass and empty boxes. A pink serum dripped slowly into the basin, each drop echoing in the silence. She thought of Ayla's laugh—bright and infectious, the kind that made everyone in the room smile. When was the last time she'd heard it? Her hands stilled. Where did you go, Ayla? And how do I bring you back?*

She pulled out her phone and looked for Mrs. Su's number, Ayla's mother, and sent a message:

*Hello Mrs. Su. Ayla is not feeling well and has been acting weird since this morning. She won't talk to me about it. Maybe you can help?*

She looked at the message and pressed send.

\-------------------

The next morning's routine was the same for Defne. Waking up. Drinking coffee. Washing her face, brushing her teeth, and getting dressed.

Unzipping her backpack, Defne looked at her pile of books. Today she needed *Anthropology: The Basics* by Peter Metcalf and *The Elements of Moral Philosophy* by James Rachels. She placed both books next to her laptop in her backpack.

There was no sound coming from Ayla's room. Defne walked up to her door and knocked a few times.

""Ayla, are you up? Can I come in?""

""...Yes...""

Defne opened the door. Darkness swallowed the room – curtains drawn tight, not a sliver of light. Every morning, music could be heard while she got ready—dancing and jumping around while holding a makeup brush as a mic. ""Come, join me,"" she would say.

But this eerie silence in the dark made Defne uneasy.

""Ayla."" Defne switched on the light. ""Talk to me. What's going on?"" Ayla pulled the duvet tighter. ""I'm sick. Just let me sleep."" ""Sick how? You were fine two days ago."" Defne sat on the edge of the bed. ""Is this about your birthday? About turning twenty-one?""

""It's not—"" Ayla's voice muffled into the pillow. ""I just need to rest.""

""Let me call a doctor. Or your mom."" ""No!"" The sharpness in Ayla's voice made Defne freeze. ""No doctors. I'm *fine*.""

""You can talk to me, you know that.""

""I just need to rest. Leave—you're gonna be late.""

""Ayla, please. You're scaring me."" Defne's voice cracked. ""You haven't been yourself since yesterday. Just tell me what's wrong.""

""I told you. I'm fine.""

""You're not fine! Look at the bathroom—the broken mirror—""

""Don't."" Ayla's breathing quickened. ""Don't talk about the mirror.""

""I'm your friend. Let me help—""

""*Leave!*"" Ayla whipped around, eyes wild. ""Just get out! Leave me alone!"" The words hung in the air between them. Defne stepped back, stunned. In three years of living together, Ayla had never—*never*—raised her voice like that. The hurt lodged in her chest like a stone. But beneath the hurt, something colder settled: fear. Real, bone-deep fear for her friend.

\------------------

*Ding dong!*

The package arrived. Less than twelve-hour delivery.

Ayla tore it open with trembling hands. The box contained serums with warnings she couldn't read, injections meant for clinics, not bathrooms. The needle felt heavy in her hand, filled with something that looked wrong. But what she saw in the mirror weighed heavier than what could go wrong.

She couldn't breathe. The face looking back was elderly, deeply lined, the skin loose and weathered. She knew—logically, she knew—she was twenty-one, but the terror came from what she saw. Her grandmother's face, her future rotting into her present. Deeply lined. Skin loose and weathered. This thing wearing her face, stealing her youth, second by second. A sob tore from her throat. She had to fix it. She had to.

Her chest tightened as tears blurred the awful image.

Ayla uncapped the syringe with shaky hands. She pressed the needle against her cheek, right where the deepest wrinkles carved into her reflection. The sharp point dimpled her skin. She didn't care anymore about sterility, about safety, about anything—anything— except to make the old woman in the mirror disappear.

She pressed the plunger and felt the cold liquid burn beneath her skin. One injection, then another. Forehead. Crow's feet. Smile lines. She lost count of how many times she pierced her skin. *Please work. Please, please, work.*

Her skin grew puffy and inflamed, but she convinced herself it was working.

Ayla took a deep breath. Something felt wrong. A heaviness settled over her chest, subtle at first, then demanding attention. Her heart felt squeezed. She tried to take another deep breath but couldn't fill her lungs completely. The edges of her vision darkened and blurred.

Pain exploded behind her ribs, and she doubled over, knocking bottles off the counter. Her heart felt like it was tearing itself apart. Sweat poured down her swollen face as she tried to breathe, tried to scream, but only a strangled wheeze escaped.

The door burst open. ""Ayla! AYLA!"" Through the haze, she recognized her mother's voice. ""Call an ambulance! NOW!"" her mother screamed.

""I'm calling, I'm calling!"" Defne's voice, high and panicked.

*All she could see were her mom's and Defne's worried faces—mouths moving, screaming words she couldn't hear. Her mother's hands, warm and trembling, cradling her swollen face. Defne crying. When had she ever seen Defne cry? The darkness crept in from the edges, soft and cold. And all she could think, as consciousness slipped away, was: Did it work? Am I beautiful now?*",1,1766440088.0,WritingWithAI,0,1.0,False

Do keep in mind, though, that I haven't updated this in a good year or so, so some things might be a little outdated, though I'm pretty sure it's mostly all still accurate. There's a lot on there, so I'm sure most of it will still be of use to y'all.

first impression?  
overwhelming 😭

like suddenly I had *too many* outfit ideas.  
and my brain was already fried.  
it felt like “cool, now even an app is telling me I have decisions to make.”

almost deleted it.

but I realised the problem wasn’t the app, it was me using it wrong.

I was expecting it to just magically pick outfits for my entire existence.  
turns out it works way better if you’re specific and chill about it.

once I:  
\-uploaded all my clothes  
\-used it for one situation at a time (college, coffee plans, random hangout)  
\-stopped asking it to fix my whole personality

…it actually started making sense.

the digital wardrobe + virtual try-on thing helped a lot because I could *see* stuff instead of imagining it and second-guessing myself for 20 minutes.

I still think AI styling can be overwhelming if you expect it to read your mind instantly.  
but if you treat it like a stylist you talk to, not a robot that controls you.. it’s kinda… nice?

not perfect. not magic.  
but I get the hype now.

First date went well, and for the second we went for a coffee and then decided to go for a walk and it also seemed good overall.

At the end of the walk, we got back to our cars and he kind of just… lingered. Didn’t say anything, didn’t make a move, just stood there. Looking back, it was pretty obvious he wanted me to initiate a kiss.

Here’s the problem: I’m incredibly socially awkward and also not great with public affection. My brain completely froze.

After an awkward pause, he said “no?” (I think as in “no kiss?”) and I panicked and said “no… shall we plan to meet up again?”

💀

Super awkward. He stood by his car while I drove away.

I texted him shortly after apologising for making it awkward and explained that I don’t really like PDA. He replied and texting was normal but slow for the rest of the day.

So, after many, many rewrites and the discovery that I was more than likely trying to place this in the wrong market (military/thriller), I think I need to push for upmarket thriller.  With that being said, I'm no closer to knowing if I'm on track or not. I'm completely spent mentally, and could really use some advice/help here.

Thanks.



Dear So and So,

Retired Navy SEAL Chuck Brandau thought the hardest thing he'd face was watching his wife die of cancer. Then someone abducted her.

When a chemical attack in Berlin kills hundreds, German intelligence falsely identifies Chuck as the architect. He's cut off from official help before he realizes he's wanted. Days later, his wife Kim—already in late-stage cancer treatment—is taken in a professional grab that leaves no witnesses and no trail. With her treatment clock running out, Chuck doesn't just lose his wife. He loses the narrow window keeping her alive.

Chuck goes dark and brings in his former teammate, Jeff Swanson. Working through off-book intelligence channels, they discover Kim's abduction is tied to a terror network planning more attacks across Europe. But the closer Chuck gets to finding her, the more entangled he becomes in the very conspiracy he's been framed for. Stopping the next attack means delaying the rescue. And Kim doesn't have time.

When Chuck finally reaches her, he faces a devastating truth: he can save thousands of lives or spend Kim's final moments with her. Not both. Most thrillers ask if the hero will arrive in time. THE ADLER COMPOUND asks what he becomes when the answer is no—and he has to watch her die anyway.

THE ADLER COMPOUND is an 80,000-word upmarket thriller that will appeal to readers of Don Winslow's THE CARTEL (moral complexity and the cost of violence) and Dennis Lehane's MYSTIC RIVER (how violence reshapes the men who survive it). It is a standalone with series potential.

I am a retired U.S. Naval officer with 32 years of service, including time as a Fleet Marine Force Corpsman, an Independent Duty Corpsman supporting special operations and submarine forces, and later as a Nurse Corps Officer specializing in Emergency and Trauma Care. This novel reflects firsthand experience operating in environments where decisions are made under pressure and mistakes carry permanent consequences.

Per your submission guidelines, \[the first ten pages / synopsis\] are included below. The full manuscript is available upon request.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

**ACT I – PRIMING THE CORD**

 

**CHAPTER ONE -THE WEIGHT OF DECEMBER**

**Stafford, Virginia — December - Early Morning**

 

The house woke up slow.

Heat kicked through the vents with a low rattling cough. The old fridge hummed. Somewhere down the street, a diesel truck grumbled to life and faded toward the main road.

In the kitchen, under the soft yellow of the over-sink light, Kim cupped both hands around her mug and waited for the coffee to cool.

Her reflection in the window looked wrong.

Too much gray at the roots. Cheekbones a little sharper. Eyes carrying that faint bluish bruise underneath—like she hadn’t slept in a week despite getting ten full hours.

“Feel human yet?” Chuck asked behind her.

He sounded fine. Normal. Morning-raspy.

She pasted on something close to a smile and turned her head just enough to see him leaning in the doorway: T-shirt, flannel pants, bare feet, hair doing whatever it wanted. That part she still liked.

“Define human,” she said.

He stepped to the counter, dropped another pod into the Keurig. “Bipedal. Vaguely coherent. Capable of sarcasm.”

“In that case,” she said, “I’ve been human longer than you.”

He snorted once and brushed past her to the cabinet. She watched the way he moved—easy, controlled, a little too deliberate for a man who claimed he’d “finally retired.”

He pulled down his chipped Trident mug. She still wasn’t sure why he used that one. Nostalgia, superstition, or because he knew it made her roll her eyes.

He set it under the spout and hit brew.

“Stomach?” he asked, like it was nothing.

“Fine,” she lied. She took a sip to prove it and regretted it instantly when the coffee sloshed against that steady background nausea.

He heard the breath catch even though she covered it.

Of course he did.

She turned back to the sink, pretending to rinse a spoon. The stainless basin warped her reflection—and the little white pill bottle just out of his line of sight.

She swallowed once, steady, and the pressure under her ribs flared then settled. Deep. Dull. Familiar. She’d gotten used to grading her pain on the scale he’d taught her years ago.

This morning was a four.

Four was manageable… until it wasn’t.

She set the spoon down a little too carefully. When the cough rose—dry, sharp—she folded into her arm and forced it quiet.

Metal. Bitter. Thin.

She pulled the paper towel from her mouth and saw the streak of red.

Not dramatic.

But enough.

She clenched it in her fist and kept her back to him.

The coffee finished with a soft hiss. He stirred the way he always did—three slow turns, tap the rim, set the spoon in the sink.

He moved closer.

One step.

Then stopped behind her shoulder. Close enough she felt the warmth, not touching.  
“You good?” he asked quietly.

He’d said it a thousand times on a thousand nights. In trucks, on ships, in strange hotel rooms across countries they didn’t acknowledge. And it never meant are you okay.

It meant: Tell me the truth or I’ll pull it out of you.

She squeezed the paper towel harder.

“Just tired,” she said. “I’ll be fine once we get moving.”

He let the silence hang too long.

He’d seen the signs before any doctor had.

The extra naps. The hand pressed low to her abdomen after dinner. The weight shifting in the wrong places. The faint swelling he’d noticed stepping out of the shower three months earlier—subtle, but wrong for her frame. And wrong everywhere else her weight had been dropping.

He hadn’t said anything then. Just filed it away in the part of his mind that still held trauma protocols, drug dosages, and the quiet warnings a body gave before it started screaming.

Hospital Corpsman “A” School.

Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training.

Special Operations Technician Course (SOTC).

All of it.

He was trained to see patterns long before he ever picked up a rifle.

Kim’s body had been whispering for months.

He reached past her and switched off the over-sink light. Her reflection vanished.

“Hey,” he murmured. “Look at me.”

She slipped the wadded towel into her robe pocket and turned.

He scanned her face—not like a husband, but like a medic: pupils, color, breath effort, tension at the mouth.

Scale of one to ten?” he asked.

She hesitated. He saw it.

“Three.”

He waited.

“Four,” she corrected.

He nodded, logging it in that invisible chart only he could see.

“And nausea?”

“Nothing I can’t manage.”  
“Kim.”  
She hated the way he said her name like that. Soft. Loaded. True.  
“Doc,” she said, mustering a smirk, “if you start interrogating me, I’m charging a copay.”  
It got half a smile.  
He stepped back, giving her space she hadn’t asked for.  
“We don’t have to go,” he said. “We can move the flights. Next month. Or skip it.”  
There it was.  
She shook her head.  
“We’ve been over this. Berlin’s paid for. I want to see it. I am not sitting in this house waiting for the next blood test.”  
His jaw flexed.  
Three weeks earlier, they’d sat in the oncologist’s office. He’d taken the extra chair deliberately—not the exam stool, not the foot of the bed—and laced his hands so he didn’t reach for her chart.  
The doctor said “ovarian” and “advanced” and too many clinical words drowned under one unspoken truth:  
Late.  
She’d taken it with grace. He’d watched the doctor’s eyes instead of the doctor’s mouth and seen timing written in them.  
“Should we have caught this earlier?” he’d asked.  
The pause was the answer.  
Now she walked toward the bedroom. “We leave in seven hours. If you bail now, I’m going to Berlin without you and find some broody German artist with better hair.”  
He followed.  
In the bedroom, suitcases lay open. Clothes in neat stacks. Her binder on the dresser—tabs, printouts, bookings. She’d always been the organized one. He’d always been the guy who showed up with three knives and no socks.  
“You packed my stuff?” he asked.  
She folded a sweater. “If I left it to you, you’d land with four T-shirts, one pair of jeans, and a dive knife.”  
“Two knives,” he said.  
She snorted.  
He watched her, saw the hesitation as she straightened—a tiny, guarded rotation at the hip.  
Another whisper.  
He moved to the suitcase. “We could make this closer. Charleston. Florida. Barbecue. Beach.”  
“No. We haven’t done Berlin.”  
He almost said, we’ll have time.  
He didn’t.  
He pivoted instead. “Berlin winters are overrated. We can wait.”  
“Charles,” she said quietly.  
He looked at her.  
“I’m not spending whatever time I’ve got left pretending we’re safe,” she said. “I want to see the things we talked about for years while you were deployed and I kept everything running here.”  
He swallowed once. Hard.  
She stepped closer. “You need this too. More than you admit.”  
He did.  
He knew he was waking at 0200 reaching for a rifle that wasn’t there, rolling onto cold sheets because she was in the bathroom trying not to wake him.  
He knew this trip scared him in a way firefights never had.  
But it was her hand on the suitcase now.  
“Okay,” he said softly. “Berlin.”  
The smile she gave him softened something armored inside him.  
“See? I still win.”  
He put his forehead to hers. They breathed together for a long, quiet moment.  
“I should’ve caught it earlier,” he said.  
“There it is. The guilt speech.”  
“I’m serious.”  
“So am I,” she said. “I didn’t see it. You did because you’re wired that way. That’s not on you.”  
He didn’t agree.  
But he let her say it.  
She headed for the kitchen. “You pack the meds,” she called. “If I do it, we’re taking the entire pharmacy.”  
He lined up the meds: antiemetic, painkillers, hormone blocker, blood thinner. Standard loadout.  
He caught his reflection—gray at the temples, lines deeper than last year. He looked retired.  
He didn’t feel retired.  
A door closed far down a hallway he knew too damn well.  
They went through the motions: showers, laundry, travel binder, boarding passes, last-minute checks. By noon, the house was staged and quiet. Mail stacked, thermostat set, lights off.  
He stood in the bedroom doorway, staring.  
“Earth to Chuck,” she said behind him.  
He turned.  
She was ready: coat, scarf, binder, suitcase upright.  
Uber buzzed. “Driver’s three minutes out.”  
“Then let’s go.”  
He grabbed his bag and held the front door open. Cold air rushed in.  
“You sure?” he asked.  
She stepped out without hesitation.  
“Ask me again when we’re under the giant menorah,” she said. “Assuming you don’t get us lost first.”  
He locked the door and followed her down the walk.  
Three minutes from now, a stranger in a Toyota would pick them up.  
By this time tomorrow, they’d be in Berlin.  
Twenty-four hours from now, the whole world would look different.  
He didn’t know that yet.  
All he knew was the December air biting his cheeks, her hand sliding into his, and the voice deep in his chest whispering:  
Something’s wrong.  
He tightened his grip and ignored it.  
They stepped toward the car as it rounded the corner.

 

**CHAPTER TWO – MOTHER’S INTUITION**  
**Berlin, Germany — December — Night**

 

The cab’s heater clicked in uneven pulses, pushing out air that never quite overcame the cold creeping through the doors and floorboards. A thin trail of fog curled upward from the vents every few seconds, vanishing before it could warm anything.

Outside, Berlin drifted past—gray facades washed in weak streetlight, puddles shining along the cobblestones, shop windows glowing dimly beneath holiday garlands. Gold and white lights hung across intersections, understated and solemn rather than festive, as if the city was remembering something it couldn’t quite name.

Kim watched it all through the window, her reflection pale in the glass. The color had drained from her cheeks somewhere between the airport and the autobahn. Now she looked like she’d been awake for days instead of hours.

Chuck saw the signs immediately.  
Because he always did.

“Beautiful,” she murmured, fingertip tracing a crescent through the condensation.

He nodded, but his eyes stayed on her—not the lights, not the streets, not the holiday displays.      Her.

“You’re staring again,” she said without looking at him.

“I’m just making sure you’re good.”

“That’s not what it feels like,” she whispered.

He broke eye contact, staring past her shoulder—anywhere but at the thing tightening inside his chest.

The cab slowed as they approached heavier traffic. Up ahead, a row of Polizei vans idled at the curb—lights off, windows fogged, officers inside holding still like silhouettes behind frosted glass. Temporary barricades were stacked nearby, not yet deployed, metal frames waiting to be carried into place once the crowds arrived. Officers moved with quiet efficiency, checking radios, scanning sidewalks, posture calm but alert.

Chuck felt the shift in his body before he consciously registered the scene. His spine straightened. Shoulders drew tight.

Kim caught it instantly. “Work brain?”

“Instinct,” he said.

“Let it go,” she murmured. “At least for tonight.”

He forced himself to turn away from the cordon. But his mind filed the details anyway: equipment types, posture, readiness, number of vehicles. He tried not to breathe like he was back in a hostile city.

Event security, he told himself. Thousands expected for the lighting. Crowd control.

The city lights washed over her face in a slow sequence—yellow, then red, then icy white.           She shifted, trying to hide a wince that flickered across her features like a glitch.

“How bad?” he asked quietly.

“Just tired.”

He didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Didn’t buy it.

Finally, she exhaled, the truth slipping through her resistance. “Six.”

His chest tightened. Six wasn’t good.

Six meant she was holding back a storm.

But he didn’t push. Not there. Not in a foreign city at night.

The cab drifted through another police checkpoint—officers scanning plates, eyes sharp, hands near their jackets. Chuck tracked every movement automatically, then deliberately forced his gaze away from their hands and belts and stance.

Focus on her.

Not the city.

Not the danger he imagined everywhere.

Kim rested her head against his shoulder.

He froze at first—a reflex—then allowed himself to sink into it. Her warmth, her weight, the soft exhale against his collar… it drew the tension out of his chest like steam.

“You’re thinking too loud again,” she whispered.

“I’m trying not to.”

“I know.” She lowered her voice. “Just be here with me a little longer.”

He nodded. It was the best he could manage.

The cab turned a corner, revealing a wide-open plaza glowing under strings of lights. Tourists clustered around steaming food stalls, bundled tight against the cold. Beyond them, the Brandenburg Gate rose gold against the haze, regal and distant.

Kim breathed out slowly, almost reverently. “I’ve always wanted to see this.”

“You are seeing it.”

“Not like I imagined,” she murmured.

“What do you mean?” he asked.

She offered a small smile—thin, tired, but earnest. “I pictured feeling stronger.”

He couldn’t answer—not without his voice breaking in half. So, he squeezed her hand, grounding her the way she grounded him. Her fingers curled into his, soft but trembling.

The cab rolled to a stop. The driver looked back. “You have arrived.”

Chuck climbed out first. The cold hit like a blade—sharp, razor-edged, the kind that burrowed under the skin. He helped Kim out gently. She smiled despite the tremor in her body.

“See?” she said softly. “We made it.”

He forced a smile back, even as something cold and heavy twisted under his ribs.

Another convoy of police vans moved through the intersection in the distance—no lights, just silent urgency.

He turned away from them.

For her.

For now.

Inside the hotel, citrus polish and radiator heat filled the lobby. A faint smell of wet wool hung in the air as guests shook snow off their coats.

Kim handled check-in with the same quiet efficiency she always had—binder, tabs, confirmations. She anticipated problems before they appeared. He anticipated threats before they formed.

They took the elevator to the eighth floor. Kim leaned slightly against the rail, just enough to steady herself without admitting she needed to. Chuck pretended not to notice.

The hallway was softly lit, shadows stretching long across the carpet. Room 814.

Chuck opened the door for her. Kim walked inside and sank onto the edge of the bed, pressing both hands into the mattress like she needed the ground to stop shifting.

He carried their bags in and set them near the dresser. But he lingered, scanning corners, walls, windows—old instincts pacing inside his skull.

Kim watched him.

He could feel it.

“You doing okay?” she asked.

He nodded too quickly. Too stiff.

“You’re carrying something heavy,” she said. “I can see it.”

He didn’t answer. Instead, he moved to the window. Snow drifted past the glass, catching the glow of the streetlamps in slow spirals. Berlin moved quietly below—cars carving bright lines across the wet street, laughter rising faintly from a group of students walking under umbrellas.

“This should feel exciting,” he said.

“It does,” she replied.

He didn’t turn. “For you?”

“It feels… complicated,” she admitted. “But I’m here. You’re here. That’s what matters.”

He finally faced her. Her eyes—tired, worn, but resilient—met his with a steadiness that made something inside him clench.

He sat beside her, elbows on his knees, hands clasped. His head bowed for a moment, shoulders heavy under the weight he was trying not to reveal.

“Chuck,” she whispered. “I’m still right here.”

“I know.”

She reached for his hand. Small. Warm. Fragile in a way that scared the hell out of him.

“Come on,” she said, standing slowly. “Let’s go see the city before I crash.”

“You don’t have to push yourself.”

“I’m not.” She managed a fragile smile. “I just don’t want to waste tonight.”

He couldn’t argue with that.

Not when she looked like that.

At the door, he helped her into her coat. She paused, looking up at him with clear, sober eyes—eyes that saw through everything he tried to hide.

“You coming with me alone?” she asked quietly. “Or dragging whatever’s eating you behind us?”

He breathed out once, a steadying exhale. “Just me.”

“Good.” She kissed his cheek. Light. Soft. Brief. But it hit him harder than any blow.

They stepped back into the Berlin night.

Snow spiraled downward, catching in her hair. Holiday lights hummed overhead. The city felt alive but muted, like it was holding its breath.

Kim linked her arm with his.

They walked slowly, together.

Half a block away—unnoticed—another police van rolled through the intersection with its lights off.

A little faster than before.

More focused.

More intent.

Chuck didn’t see it.

Not yet.

But he felt something shift—deep, quiet, low in his chest.

A tremor in the world.

A whisper in the dark.

He just didn’t know what it meant yet.

\*\*\*

By the time they made it back, Kim’s breathing had turned shallow, her steps shorter, her body leaning into his more heavily than she wanted to admit.

Inside the elevator, she pressed her back against the wall, eyes closed.

“You okay?” he asked.

She nodded once. “I’ll be fine when we’re home.”

In the room, she collapsed onto the bed—this time without the controlled grace she’d maintained earlier.

“Hey,” he said softly, kneeling beside her. “Talk to me.”

She lifted her face, eyes glassy but not from tears—more like something inside her was fraying.

“I don’t feel right,” she whispered. “Not just tired. Not jet lag. Something’s wrong.”

Not sick-wrong.

Something-else-wrong.

He felt the bottom drop out of his chest.

“What do you need?”

Her voice cracked. “I want to go home.”

There were a thousand ways he could have argued or hesitated.

He did none of them.

“Then we go home,” he said. “First thing tomorrow morning.”

She looked up sharply. “You’d leave early?”

“For you?” he said. “Always.”

He grabbed his phone, thumb moving fast. “Earliest flight out.”

Her shoulders shook—relief, fear, something else.

“Here,” he said. “10:15 a.m. Straight home.”

She pressed a hand to her heart, grounding herself. “Thank you.”

“You don’t have to thank me,” he said. “Just listen to your gut.”

Her voice softened into something frail and honest. “I’m scared, Chuck.”

He closed his eyes and rested his forehead against hers.

“I know,” he said quietly. “We’ll get you home. One step at a time.”

He helped her lie down, pulled the blanket over her, then sat by the window. Berlin glowed below—snow-dusted streets, soft lights, passing sirens far in the distance.

He watched the city like it was a puzzle missing its final piece.

Something in his chest tightened again.

That old whisper he’d tried to bury.

Something’s coming.

He didn’t know what.

Didn’t know when.

But Kim’s instinct—her quiet warning, her fear, her urgency—had saved his life before.

It was about to save both of them again.

In the morning, they would leave Berlin behind.

**By nightfall, the whole world would be different.**

 

**CHAPTER THREE – THE UNFINISHED TRIP**

**Berlin, Germany — December — Early Morning**

 

The room was dim when Chuck woke.

For a few seconds he didn’t move, letting his eyes adjust to the bluish half-light bleeding in around the edges of the curtains. The glow off the snow outside turned the walls into a soft, cold gray, like the inside of a ship at night when it was rigged for red. The air had that slightly stale hotel smell—recycled air, foreign laundry detergent, someone else’s perfume still hanging faintly in the carpet.

Snow clung to the balcony rail outside, glowing faint blue under the winter sky. The drifts had thickened overnight, pushed into lopsided ridges by wind he hadn’t heard while he slept. Berlin looked softer from up here, edges blurred by frost and distance. He knew better. Cities never softened; they just hid their teeth.

Kim lay curled on her side, breathing shallow but even. Her face was turned toward him, hair mashed flat on one side, the rest fanned across the pillow. In the dim light, the bruised half-circles beneath her eyes looked darker, almost painted on. One hand rested just below her ribs; thumb pressed into the fabric of her T-shirt like she was trying to pin something in place.

He watched her for a moment, letting the reality settle in:  
They were going home.

Early.

Before anything else could go wrong.

The thought landed with more weight than relief. Going home meant doctors and appointments and test results and words like progression and options. But it also meant distance between her and the sick, crawling feeling he’d had walking past those Polizei vans, the unfinished barricades, the sense that Berlin was about to host something ugly.

They hadn’t been reacting to anything yet, he reminded himself—just staging for the crowd.

She stirred as he shifted.

“Time?”

Her voice was raspy with sleep, edges frayed. She didn't open her eyes, as if postponing the answer might postpone the day.

“Little after five.”

He glanced at the cheap digital clock by the bed to confirm what his internal clock had already told him to within a few minutes. Years of watch rotations and med calls hadn’t left much room for oversleeping.

She nodded, slow and stiff. When she sat up, her hand instinctively pressed to her abdomen.       She tried to hide it. Failed.

The movement was small, but he caught every millimeter of it—the slight forward curl of her shoulders, the way her jaw flexed as if she were bracing against a wave. He saw the exact moment the pain rolled through and the exact moment she tried to pretend it hadn’t.

“You sure you’re okay to travel?” he asked.

He already knew the answer, but he needed to hear how she framed it. Medics weren’t just taught to read vitals; they were taught to read lies. Especially the ones people told themselves.

“I’m better than last night.”

She paused.

“Not good, but… better.”

He accepted it because it was honest.

Not good. But better. That was the space a lot of people lived in before things tipped hard one way or the other. Four on the pain scale instead of six. Half a liter of blood loss instead of one. Breathing hard but still breathing.

They packed in silence. Efficient. Practiced. The way couples who’ve survived deployments and distance do things—quiet teamwork without needing words.

Chuck folded clothes with the kind of precision he used to reserve for medical kits and weapons checks. Socks rolled tight, T-shirts squared, meds counted twice. Kim moved more slowly than usual, pausing between motions to let the room stop spinning. She kept the bathroom door half closed when she went in, like she didn’t want him to see her grip the counter when the nausea hit.

He pretended not to notice the worst of it and made himself useful—charging phones, checking flight details, laying out passports. In another life, leaving early would’ve felt like bailing on a mission. In this one, it felt like extraction.

**\*\*\***

**6:02 a.m. — Hotel Lobby**

The lobby was half-lit, half-asleep. A few early travelers murmured around the coffee machine. A janitor buffed the floor. Snow drifted thick outside the glass doors.

The front desk clerk from the night before looked barely conscious, her hair pulled into a lopsided bun, blazer wrinkled at one shoulder. A television over the bar cycled through muted headlines and weather maps, bright colors that didn’t match the quiet in the room.

Chuck kept close to Kim as they walked out to the waiting cab. Her weight leaned into him—not dramatically, just enough that he felt it.

To anyone watching, it probably looked like a husband being nice. To him, it wasn’t small. His body adjusted before he thought about it.

He watched her feet while they crossed the tile. Shorter steps. Slight drag in the left leg when she was tired. She still carried herself like she didn’t want pity from anyone, including him.

The driver loaded the bags.

Middle-aged, knit cap, cigarettes on his breath even at six in the morning. He moved with impatient efficiency, tossing their luggage into the trunk like he’d done it a thousand times in every possible kind of weather.

Chuck helped Kim into the back seat.

He angled her gently; one hand braced on the doorframe so she could use his arm for balance. She sank into the seat with a low exhale, fingers bunching the edge of her coat.

The car pulled away.

Berlin faded behind them.

Streetlights streaked past in soft yellow blurs. The roads were mostly empty, just a few delivery vans and taxis cutting lines through slush. Storefronts were dark, metal roll-down gates glistening with ice. He watched the city recede in the side mirror, the hotel shrinking into anonymous blocks.

At first, the cab was silent except for the rhythmic swish of tires through wet snow.

The heater rattled weakly, pushing out lukewarm air that smelled faintly of dust and pine-scented cleaner. The driver had a talk radio station on low—rapid German punctuated by the occasional name or place Chuck recognized but didn’t bother to translate. Kim leaned her head back, eyes closed, lips parted just enough to pull in careful breaths.

Then Kim whispered, “Thank you for listening last night.”

Her voice was so soft he almost missed it over the noise of the tires and the radio. She didn’t open her eyes, like she wasn’t sure she wanted to see his reaction.

He kissed her temple. “You’ve never steered me wrong.”

The words were simple, but he meant them with the kind of bone-deep certainty he rarely extended to anything. She’d kept him alive more than once without ever picking up a weapon—redirecting him when he pushed too hard, pulling him back from edges he didn’t recognize until he was already over them.

Her eyes softened, but there was something else beneath it—something uneasy. Instinct. Fear. A warning she didn’t understand herself.

He knew that look. He’d seen it a thousand times when something in the air shifted—when instincts fired before the mind caught up.

The city’s edges blurred past as dawn crept in.

Street by street, the old buildings gave way to industrial zones and airport access roads. Sodium vapor lamps washed everything in that weird orange that made the snow look dirty even when it was fresh. A few planes hung on the horizon like slow-moving stars, on final approach from somewhere still asleep.

He tightened his grip on her hand.

Her fingers were cooler than he liked. Not dangerous-cold, not shock-cold, but not warm enough either. He rubbed his thumb across her knuckles, counting breaths without meaning to—inhale, exhale, cadence, rhythm.

\*\*\*

**Berlin Tegel Airport — Early Morning**

The airport buzzed quietly with early flights. Travelers shuffled through security lines holding paper cups. Overhead, announcements echoed in clipped German.

Rolling suitcases clattered over tile. A kid cried somewhere near the check-in counters. The smell of burnt espresso and industrial bread drifted from a café that looked like every café in every airport he’d ever been through, no matter the country.

Chuck kept Kim close, hand at her back. She moved slowly but steady.

He matched her pace without making it obvious, adjusting their route to avoid clusters of people and slick patches of floor where melted snow had pooled. Years of moving casualties through tight spaces had taught him how to guide without pushing, support without making someone feel handled.

At the gate, she sagged into the chair with a long exhale.

She dropped her bag at her feet and folded her hands over her abdomen, shoulders rounding as if she were trying to make herself smaller, less visible. Her gaze drifted to the big glass windows where snowflakes tapped and slid in uneven paths.

“You okay?” he asked.

He crouched a little to meet her eyes, scanning her face like it was a set of labs.

“For now,” she said.

The honesty in the phrase was almost comforting. For now, he could work with. *Fine* was a lie he’d stopped accepting from anyone years ago.

He brushed a stray hair behind her ear. “We’ll be home soon.”

Home meant their own bed, their own coffee, their own doctor who looked Kim in the eye and answered questions without hiding behind jargon. It also meant phone calls, referrals, scans, and conversations he didn’t want to have but would walk into anyway because she needed him steady.

The boarding call came early. They lined up with the other passengers. Chuck guided her onto the jet bridge, one step at a time.

The metal ramp creaked under the weight of rolling suitcases and tired people. Cold air funneled down from somewhere ahead, carrying the sharp scent of jet fuel and de-icing fluid.      Kim’s hand tightened briefly on the rail; he shifted closer, giving her his shoulder without making a production out of it.

Once seated, she closed her eyes and leaned her head against the window.

The overhead bins thunked shut around them. A baby fussed a few rows back. A businessman across the aisle stabbed at his phone screen like it had personally offended him. Kim exhaled slowly, letting her weight settle into the seat as if her bones had finally decided they were done for the day.

“Wake me when we land,” she murmured.

Her voice already had the loose edges of someone halfway to sleep, the kind of exhaustion that wasn’t just physical but cellular.

“I will.”

He buckled in, checked her belt without drawing attention, and let his hand rest, light and careful, on her forearm. He didn’t close his eyes. Not yet.

The engines rumbled.

The vibration started low, a faint tremor under his feet that climbed up through the seat frame and into his spine. It was a feeling he knew too well—ships, aircraft, armored vehicles—all of them announcing movement the same way, with that first deep mechanical shudder.

The plane pushed back.

Ground crew in reflective vests drifted past the window, their movements brisk, impersonal, part of an old choreography. The wing flexed slightly as they turned. A spray of slush arced away from the tires as the aircraft eased onto the taxiway.

Snow blurred across the asphalt.

For a moment the world outside the window was nothing but white streaks and smeared lights, like someone had dragged a brush across a wet painting. The runway edge markers slid by in precise intervals, a metronome counting down to the moment none of this would be on the ground anymore.

Berlin fell away beneath the wings.

The pressure shifted, that familiar upward pull as gravity lost a little of its grip. The city shrank, lights fading into a gray-white patchwork below. Clouds swallowed the plane whole, and for a few seconds there was nothing outside but fog and motion.

Chuck looked at Kim, at the faint crease between her brows even in sleep, at the way her hand still rested protectively over her abdomen.

They were going home.

Early.

Before anything else could go wrong.

He hoped to God it would be enough.

 

**CHAPTER FOUR -- FIRE IN THE SQUARE**  
**Berlin, Germany -- December – Morning**

 

Ezra Katz eased himself into the kitchen chair the way a man in his nineties learns to sit -- slowly, cautiously, with just enough dignity to pretend the joints did not hurt. Outside, the Berlin morning was cold and sharp, a gray wash of winter light filtering through his modest apartment's windows.

He reached for the small radio on the table, the one Sebastian had bought him years ago, and turned the dial until a low hum of classical music filled the kitchen. He liked mornings like this. Quiet. Predictable. The kind of peace he once believed he would never live long enough to see.

He had survived by luck.

He had lived this long by stubbornness.

A set of keys rattled in the lock.

Ezra smiled.

The door opened, and in stepped Sebastian -- tall now, broad-shouldered, a grown man by every measure but still wearing the same eager half-grin he had carried at six years old. His hair was tousled, scarf crooked, and he held two paper cups in a cardboard holder.

""Zayde,"" Sebastian said, nudging the door shut with his foot. ""I brought coffee. One with too much sugar. One with not enough. Guess which is yours.""

Ezra lifted his chin. ""I do not guess.""

""That is because you are predictable,"" Sebastian said, setting the cups down. ""Morning.""

Ezra studied him -- the easy posture, the warmth in his eyes, the calm competence that had replaced childhood restlessness. This young man standing in his kitchen was his great-grandson. The first of that generation. The boy who had once crawled into his study and asked about every photograph, every artifact, every memory.

Now he stood there solid and unafraid.

""How was your night shift?"" Ezra asked.

""Cold,"" Sebastian said, shrugging out of his coat. ""Two calls. One false alarm. Nothing exciting.""

Ezra chuckled. ""Berlin is a safe city... mostly.""

""Mostly,"" Sebastian agreed.

He sat across from Ezra, hands wrapped around his coffee, comfortable in the small kitchen. Ezra loved that about him. Loved that the world had not yet taught him caution. Loved that he moved through it without fear.

""You are still going to the lighting tonight?"" Sebastian asked.

""Of course,"" Ezra said.

""You want company?""

Ezra smiled faintly. ""Always.""

Sebastian nodded. ""I will meet you there after work. Should be off by six.""

Ezra reached across the table and patted the back of Sebastian's hand. ""You have your entire life in front of you. You do not need to worry about me.""

Sebastian smirked. ""You say that like I could stop.""

Ezra sniffed. ""You could try.""

They finished their coffee. Sebastian checked his watch, stood, zipped his coat.

""How did I get so old?"" Ezra asked.

Sebastian paused at the door. ""By being impossible to kill.""

Ezra smiled.

Sebastian left with a wave and closed the door behind him.

Ezra stood alone in the kitchen for a moment, then buttoned his coat, wrapped his scarf around his neck, and stepped out into the Berlin morning.

**\*\*\***

**Berlin, Germany -- December -- Evening**

The plaza around the Brandenburg Gate was crowded, bodies packed tight beneath the cold sky. Breath rose in pale clouds. The menorah towered above them, metal arms catching the floodlights.

Ezra stood near the barricade. Sebastian was beside him, close enough that their coats brushed.

""Crowd is bigger than last year,"" Sebastian said.

Ezra nodded. ""It always is.""

The rabbi was lifted in a bucket toward the elevated candles. The shamash already burned, steady and bright. The crowd quieted as the blessings rose and faded into the cold air.

Phones lifted. Children climbed onto shoulders.

The flame touched the newest candle.

Light caught.

Applause spread outward.

Then --

A sharp clean pop.

Not from above.

From beneath.

Ezra felt it hit his chest like a fist.

No warning. No buildup.

His lungs locked.

Sebastian turned, mouth opening to speak --

and dropped straight down, body rigid, skull striking stone with a sound Ezra felt more than heard.

Ezra tried to inhale.

Nothing happened.

The world lurched sideways. His knees buckled and he went down hard, hands slapping stone without strength behind them.

Around him, people were falling. Some convulsed. Some simply collapsed and did not move.

Sebastian lay a few feet away, eyes open, unmoving.

Ezra tried to reach him.

His arm did not respond.

The menorah lights smeared across his vision.

The sound of the crowd vanished.

And then there was nothing else he could do.

1ptbrtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kuwait/comments/1ptbrtt/worried_so_many_small_businesses_are_going_to/,Worried so many small businesses are going to close soon..,"I genuinely feel like the economy has hit in a way we haven’t really experienced before, and it’s starting to show in places we love… their prices slowly going up and them desperately trying to do more.. 

I know from speaking to some friends that rents in Kuwait are honestly brutal. Small spaces going for 2,500–3,000+ a month just don’t make sense, especially when people, myself included, have become much more price sensitive.

Even coffee has changed. A lot of us invested in our own setups at home, good beans, a grinder, a V60. Once you do that, it’s hard to justify buying coffee out every single day. Not because you don’t love cafés I have a few spots that feel like a second home for me. 

It feels like spending isn’t happening out of habit anymore. People are choosing more carefully. Going out less often, but being very intentional about where they go and why.

At this point, it almost feels like you either have to be fully online, or be a large business with deep pockets. Something backed by investors or owned by a bigger company that can afford to keep prices low, absorb slow months, and survive on volume and expanding like crazy. 

I keep thinking about when the bookstore in AlMuthanna was closing down. That beautiful basement space. I remember how sad it felt, and how people started posting (was it Mark? I think so) trying to support them at the last minute. But by then, it was already too late. The same thing happened with so many small clothing boutiques. Pink Moon Denim Room others like it. Places with soul, not just product. There was a really good sandwich shop in Salmiya near Shaha Complex & across Thuraya - same story. 

That’s what scares me. It feels like we’re losing spaces that were built with love, replacing them with concepts designed purely to always be the next big thing.

I don’t love where this is heading. To make it now, you have to be so hip, constantly packed, always visible online, and basically a full-time marketer on top of being a business owner. There’s barely any room left to just run a small, thoughtful business.

I don’t think people are done with cafés or boutiques. I think they’re done with places that don’t give them a reason beyond convenience. But I also worry that the system is slowly pushing out the quieter, more meaningful spaces, the ones that made going out feel special in the first place. 

Rant over.  

Who are you worried is going to close? Let’s support them. 

Who do you miss that closed down? Let’s remember them and make sure we hold onto the spaces that we like! ",5,1766439548.0,Kuwait,3,0.86,False

I pulled into a gas station off the highway to process and find an area with decent cell reception to call my sister.

I matched with a girl named K on Hinge back in September. Things were alright. Early on she kept using the abbreviation BF. To me that means boyfriend, so after a bit I finally asked her what she meant. She told me she meant best friend, not boyfriend. I said okay, cool, no problem. At the time she never used a pronoun or said whether this person was a guy or a girl, and I did not really care enough to dig into it.

Eventually the conversation fizzled out. Nothing dramatic happened. Before it fizzled, she recommended a book called Pachinko and she knew I bought it. About a week before Thanksgiving, after I finished it, I reached out just to say hey, I read the book you recommended and I liked it. I was not trying to restart anything. I honestly did not expect much. But we ended up talking again for about a week or so. Then that fizzled out too, naturally. I left it on a polite note saying I hoped she found what she was looking for. She said the same but before they fizzled we were talking about restaurants and the city by us and stuff like that I told her all the places I love to eat at the city and gave her a big list.

Then four days before Christmas, she texts me again. This time the texting is more frequent. Which I like, but it is also where the confusion really kicks in. She starts using BF again, except now she is using male pronouns. She still has not actually said boyfriend, but she is saying things like she is spending Christmas Eve with her BF and her roommates. That sounds like a boyfriend to me, but at the same time she is not talking about dates or anything explicitly romantic, so my brain just keeps going back and forth on it.

Since our schedules never lined up the first two times we talked, I finally just asked her straight up if I could take her out for coffee. She said yes, but that the holidays might make scheduling tricky. I said that was completely understandable. So now I am just sitting here in this weird gray area. We matched on a dating app. She agreed to coffee. We are texting more than before. And yet I have no idea if BF means best friend or boyfriend, and I do not know what lane I am actually in.

I asked some of my female friends what they thought. A few of them were pretty honest and said that while they are not proud of it, they have definitely had someone in the past who was sort of in the back of their mind if their current relationship did not work out. Basically a backburner situation. Hearing that made me wonder if this BF is actually a boyfriend and I am just kind of a stand in right now, or maybe a future option if things fall apart. Not the best feeling, but I get that it happens.

Other friends had a different take. They pointed out that this is all happening right before Christmas and New Year’s, and after things fizzled out twice, especially the way I ended it politely and cleanly, it could just be that she does not want to go into the new year alone. Less calculated, more timing and comfort.

The final option which surprisingly none of them actually said was that this could be her just checking up because we ended it on such a polite note that she could just be looking for a friend which I don’t mind I like friends. 

I am just confused and trying not to read the situation wrong. I do not know if I should ask for clarification again and risk making things awkward, or if I should just let it play out and see what actually happens.",1,1766439318.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Let's call him John. Our falling out years ago still looms in the basis of our strained relationship. I can't help but notice how she avoids my gaze or quickly changes the topic when our past issues surface. There's a certain silence that screams louder than any fight we've ever had - the regret of never apologizing to one another.

Observing each clumsy interaction, I also found myself torn between wanting to apologize and fearing that it may open old wounds again. Lately, I've felt somewhat entrapped, walking on broken glass, careful not to say the wrong thing or create even the slightest hint of tension.

So, rarely have I felt so clearly the weight of unspoken words... the heaviness of an apology left unsaid. It's transformation from a symbol of admission to an elephant in the room can be particularly unnerving, and can penetrate the strongest facades.

Has anyone else had a difficult time running into someone from their past? Is there a point where it's too late to apologize, or is acknowledging past mistakes always a step in the right direction?",1,1766439245.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1ptbna4,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ptbna4/my_dream_trip_to_australia_became_a_nightmare/,My Dream Trip to Australia Became a Nightmare,"I’m a backpacker. I've been pretty much all over the world. From the bright lights of south east Asia to the rolling meadows of western Europe. But there was one spot that had up until recently, eluded me. Australia. Well, I finally bit the bullet and booked my dream trip down under. I'd love to sit here and tell you all about how incredible it was. How I saw some of the most unique sights I had ever seen in my life. To a point I suppose that's true. But I won't be going back there…



You see, I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of the Australian Outback, with its vast empty nothingness stretching as far as the eye can see. Something about getting yourself lost in its beauty, it's equal parts terrifying and exciting. So that’s exactly what I planned to do. It's also why Australia had remained unattainable to me up until quite recently. I was set on doing things... differently. I didn't want to do what every dime a dozen tourist did. I had no interest in seeing the sights of the cities, I mean I’m sure they’re beautiful in their own right, but for me, I wanted to get out into the wilds as quickly as possible.



I did some research beforehand, jumped onto some local Aussie backpacking travel groups on Facebook and I ended up getting quite friendly with a local. His name was Chris and he was part Indigenous Australian. Aboriginal Dad, and his Mother of Irish heritage. We got to talking and upon hearing all about my wishes to see the more secluded sights of Australia, he agreed to be my tour guide for the trip.



Alright! All was set. I flew into Sydney on a cold July morning. Yeah that’s their winter months down there. I was so excited as the Sydney Harbour bridge and the Opera House slowly came into view upon our descent beneath the clouds. I was right, the cities were beautiful in their own regard but still, that’s not what I was here to see.



I met my tour guide Chris at the airport and we hastily made our way to his vehicle, a stereotypical rusty Holden ute, and began the trek out west. The drive was bloody beautiful and I highly recommend you try it at least once in your lifetime. We eventually cleared the western suburbs of Sydney passing through Parramatta, Blacktown and Penrith before the urban scenery slowly began to give way to beautiful wide open spaces. Yeah, this is what I’ve been waiting for.



The drive continued on for hours as we passed through quaint little outback communities, some of which genuinely looked like ghost towns. It was awe inspiring to see the colours of this barren landscape change as we drove deeper toward the centre. Brown, dry bushland interspersed with pockets of green slowly transitioning into hot red earth. I was mesmerised. It was a long drive out there but I was so captivated by the sights I was seeing I honestly didn't notice. Eventually, just as night began to fall, we reached Broken Hill. This sprawling inland mining city deep in the heart of outback New South Wales was to be our base for exploring the remote wilderness of Mutawintji National Park.



We would stay the night here in Broken Hill. It was too late to start the hike into the park, Chris explained to me. It was already creeping into the afternoon hours, and if we got caught in the dark too far from a good spot to make camp, that could spell real danger out there. I wasn't going to argue. He knew this place better than I did. I was excited to get out there and really start exploring, but I'd also had little sleep on the long haul down here, and I wasn't going to say no to a good night's rest.



We checked into a quaint little hotel. Now, when I say hotel, I mean the Australian depiction of that term. If you're picturing the Hilton, think again. When Aussies say ""hotel"", they mean the bare necessities you need in a room, situated on the second floor on top of a pub (a bar). Falling asleep to the sounds of drunken Australian men shouting at eachother about two different types of football, neither of which I understand, was certainly something. But I was so tired at this point it didn't pose much of a barrier in my journey to slumber. A few pages into a good book and I was out like a light.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_





I awoke the next morning to the smells of breakfast and the sounds of my fellow guests shuffling their way down the stairs to dig into it. I was close behind them, ravenous after not eating very well at all the past couple of days. Aussies sure know how to start the day with a good breakfast. Well, a big one anyway, I don't imagine it would score too high a health rating. Mountains of bacon, sausage and eggs were loaded up onto a plate and I was given a huge mug of coffee to wash it down with. I'm... not really too big a fan of starting the day off with a heavy meal, but I got the feeling I wasn't in the best company to raise any complaints.



After breakfast, I met up with Chris and we loaded our gear into his ute. Before long, we were out on the open road again, surrounded by the endless red horizon. He wasn’t wrong. This place was remote. It was a few hours drive to the nearest entry point and from there we were on foot. We had everything we needed in our packs but still, there was something quite unnerving about trekking into such a vast open wasteland with not even a vehicle to retreat into should things go sideways. But, this is what I came for. And I was going to see it through.



That first step was something truly magical. The barely audible crunch of the soft top layer of dirt before my boot sunk into the red earth, it was surreal. I had waited so long to see this land, I couldn't quite believe I was actually here. Finally. The first day was full of little moments like that. The first time seeing a mob of kangaroos hop by in the distance. The first time smelling eucalyptus. The first time fearing for my life, as Chris threw an abrupt hand signal up in front of my face just in time to stop me traipsing ignorantly into a large eastern brown snake’s path. That sure got the blood up. And the first time seeing a billabong cresting the horizon after a full day of hiking, that was a sight to behold. 



It was around 4 or 5 in the afternoon by that point, so we decided to make camp for the night. It had been a long day, and I was starving. Thankfully Chris had picked up a few recipes from his old man during his childhood years growing up in a remote outback settlement. “Bush tucker” they call it down there. Chris cooked up a hot stew, and we had that with what they call damper, the “bread of the bush”. It’s actually really cool to see someone make bread using nothing but ingredients pulled straight from the land. It’s made using wattleseed and saltbush. It’s not much for the taste buds, but let me tell you, when you’re out there with nothing but the clothes on your back and whatever the land grants you, being able to fill your belly with bread is a beautiful thing. 



It was a great way to end what had been an amazing start to my first venture into the Australian outback. We set up our camp beneath some gum trees, nearby that beautiful billabong. It was of course far too cold for any swimming but the ambiance was nice. There was a trickle in a nearby stream and the crackle of the campfire had me off to sleep very quickly.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_





It must have been close to, or maybe just past midnight, when I awoke from a sound sleep, to a hand pressing against my mouth. This is obviously not a great way to wake up deep in the Aussie wilderness and believe me in that moment there were many thoughts of Australia’s outback serial killers racing through my mind. But as it would happen, it was Chris. His eyes were wide and he had a finger pressed against his lips, telling me in no uncertain terms to keep my mouth shut.



I began to glance around trying to find the source of Chris’s sudden panicked state. Looking around, at first I didn’t notice anything, just the vast expanse of the open outback in every direction. Nothing but darkness, and the infinite void of this ancient land. What made this experience even more terrifying is that we didn’t even have the cover of a tent, we were just camping out rough in our swags. I had no idea what to expect, I had visions of dangerous wild animals hunting us, circling in around us. That’s when Chris lifted a single hand and pointed down toward the water hole and whispered one word… “Nadubi”.



It took me a while in my sleepy state to process what I was looking at. In a flash I was reminded of every sleep deprived night spent as a kid after staying up late and watching my Dad’s scary werewolf films, for that is almost exactly what I was looking at here. It looked in every possible way, bar some subtle differences, like a werewolf. It stood bolt upright on two jagged hind legs, its arms slumped down by its sides and its head hung downward, its scrunched up face moulding into a slender snout which looked more beak-like than that of a dog.



It began to slowly creep around the waterhole, my eyes remaining fixed on it the whole time. With each step the dry earth crunched beneath it, and each one of those sounds will forever remain burned into my memory as with every one of them I thought for sure this thing was making its slow approach towards us. As it came closer to our side of the small pond I began to notice more alarming features about this thing. It may have resembled a werewolf in form and posture but that is where the similarities ended. Its entire body, was covered in what looked to be sharp tendrils, like a porcupine.



I watched as it sniffed at the still night air, I suppose searching for something it could call a meal. I don’t know. I’m unsure what its purpose was, what its motives were. But by the look of it neither could have been good. Chris, ever so slowly and carefully, pulled the small swag blanket over the both of us, and we huddled there in place, hoping and praying that we would go unnoticed.



For a series of very, very long hours, we lay there in the silence of the desolate Australian outback, as we listened to this thing take measured paces around our camp. It just, walked around, occasionally sniffing at our packs and some of the food we had left around camp. Intermittently, we would hear the unmistakable sounds of slurping. I guessed at that point it must have found itself some leftovers. Every so often it would retreat back over to the other side of the waterhole, from what we could hear anyway, but would then return. It seemed like it was waiting for something. Perhaps it thought somebody might be coming back, for whatever reason unaware that we were right there beneath the thin swag blanket.



It was, undoubtedly, the single most horrifying night of my life. The thoughts that were running through my mind after seeing this thing. Thinking about what it could do to us with that nightmarish form it carried with it. It was beyond terrifying.



We did not dare move that whole night. And it’s a good thing! As it would, in the end, be the light of day which would arrive as our saviours. I guess it didn’t much like the light, or perhaps the early morning heat it brought with it as it made its ascent, as we heard this thing very quickly run away as soon as the morning rays began making their way across our camp.



It still took us another good hour before we could summon the bravery to emerge from our makeshift hiding spot. I almost wish we had not. As we rose from our tiny sanctuary, and got a look at what had once been our tranquil little campsite, we were even more horrified than we had been the night before. We were greeted by the sight of many, many corpses. Lizards, possums, fish, snakes, even some kangaroos. Their bodies, lifeless. Seemingly, they were untouched. You wouldn’t even know they had been attacked in any way, were it not for the small holes in their bellies, and those disgusting slurping noises we had heard the night before.



We made haste getting out of there, needless to say. We stayed a night back in Broken Hill, and set off for the drive back east the next morning. The drive back to Sydney was a lot more solemn than the one we had taken on the way out there. Chris barely spoke. I almost didn’t want to break the silence but there were questions on my mind. That thing was obviously not of this world and yet he seemed to know exactly what it was at a glance. While not entirely certain of course, Chris shared with me that what we had seen, was most likely a Nadubi. It is an Indigenous tale of a grotesque, echidna like dog man which hunts by night. I didn’t get much more out of him, he looked as shaken as I was, understandably so. Despite growing up hearing many of these stories, I could tell by his demeanour this was the first time he had encountered one first hand.



I did end up staying a few more nights in Sydney. Honestly, I was still in a state of shock. I probably would have been on the next flight out had I been in any state of mind to book one. But I just, couldn’t. So I stuck around, until I could think straight. It wasn’t all bad I suppose, I ended up seeing a few sights around the city. I have a whole new appreciation for cities. Whilst I do still appreciate the blissful peace of the wilderness, I choose to admire it from afar. I have seen what lurks within the unexplored pockets of the Australian outback. I have seen why so many who venture too deep within fail to return.



For those of you wishing to experience it for yourself, I will not tell you what to do. I will leave you with only one piece of advice. That you educate yourself. Not only by the standards of modern humanity’s limited knowledge of this land, but listen to the stories of those who have lived here since ancient times. Do not underestimate their wisdom.

It’s 3:00 AM.

The city is asleep.

Your coffee is cold.

And that one stop is coming up.

You know the one — the place where the building, a tree, and poor life choices are all positioned within inches of where your truck has to go. It’s a tight ballet every time, but tonight? Tonight is special.

Because of course it’s the day before a holiday.

You pull in, already mentally rehearsing your exit… and there it is.

A car.

Parked perfectly in the only possible way out.

With a giant sign that proudly reads:

“CUSTOMER PARKING ONLY.”

Except…

The store is closed.

It’s 3 AM.

No customers.

No employees.

Just vibes.

So there I am, performing a slow-motion, white-knuckle geometry problem using every inch of space I have. Trying not to say f it and take off the bumper, breath held, brain calculating angles NASA would respect.

Let’s just say:

That car and my truck became very familiar with each other…

and an inch suddenly felt like a luxury item.

He went through hell. Two surgeries, second one about 35 hours over 3 main surgery days. He died just over a month ago.

Removed kidney, gallbladder, 1/3 of the liver, lymph nodes last year. They couldn’t get it all, so then it was chemo to try and buy time get to a radioactive injection treatment.

As he was healing he spent his birthday and Christmas in the hospital. Our Golden Retriever also died not long after his surgery and he didn’t get to say goodbye at the end.

He developed type one diabetes, had to get bile suctioned with one tube and feeding through another.

Lots of meds, shots, vomiting.

The type of tumors also send norepinephrine which at times caused a lot of fight or flight responses, anxiety, high blood pressure, elevated heart rate, etc.

Poor kid would have that combined with chemo sickness and low blood sugar sometimes in the middle of the night. It was awful.

He fought through ascites which healed. Made it home two days then three days in 6 months. We lived at the hospital and Ronald McDonald House. He did regain some strength but usually needed a walker and wheelchair.

The manufacturer delayed the radioactive treatment for months because of production issues, so chemo was the only real option besides letting the aggressive tumors grow.

He had a bile duct stent and stomach stent as well because one of the tumors was invading the pancreas and duodenum. This meant restricted diet when he could eat.

We were lined up for the radioactive treatment in the summer and the manufacturer delayed again!

He at least had a break at home for a month but it was too long. He had some joy…recovered enough to walk around and play some pretty quickly away from chemo. This whole time still needing blood pressure meds and other meds, but at least he was off of feeds and didn’t need insulin! He had puked up the ng tube and refused a new one.

With the treatment delay, he ended up in pain as the tumors grew and had to get external beam radiation and more chemo.

We finally made it to the radioactive treatment and it may have helped some but was just too little too late. By then, tumors had been affecting the lung pleura and abdomen.

He did get through some pneumonia and recovered some! It was looking hopeful and he was riding the trikes around the halls at the hospital.

His coughing was a concern, coughing blood at times too. He had to change his make a wish then missed his wish the day before because of fluid buildup. He said he didn’t care if he died, he wanted to do his wish. What a hard day it was having to cancel.

We did get home for two more days, but the fluid buildup had collapsed his lung requiring a drain.

It wasn’t resolving and his other lung got congested. That’s what finally took him.

Amazing kid. Told me I have my whole life to live to do what he wants. Said he didn’t want to be intubated or cpr, knowing he was likely not going to recover.

He changed his wish to donate to the hospital. 


I had lots of anticipatory grief throughout this experience. A lot of it was traumatic and even had a panic attack (wow that is an intense experience!). There were many more ups and downs with procedures, the bile duct stent, scans, tumors shrinking and growing, etc.

We did have hope and joy at times too! Just overall an awful experience.


My Mom was a huge support throughout this, mainly over the phone. She was always there if I needed to talk and wanted updates.

Now she has a cancer that could mean weeks or months. It’s at a point where I’m not sure they can do any surgery and treatment may help, but not sure. It doesn’t look good.


I know people go through losing multiple loved ones and somehow keep living a good life, but it’s been so difficult losing our dog, son, and now possibly my Mom.

What are some ways people grieve without feeling apathetic? 

I feel awful sadness, hopelessness, and just cry a lot. It’s normal for people to grieve in ways like this, but it’s hard to be motivated to move on with the day.

My sleep is off, I haven’t eaten well or regularly, I haven’t been exercising.

I am grateful that we are okay financially for now and that my wife hasn’t had such debilitating grief. 

It makes me think of all the homeless/unhoused people who end up there because life just sucks sometimes. No fault of their own they lose people, lose a home, and in the state I am it seems like it would be easy to turn to drugs or alcohol if I were also homeless.

I do have a counselor, I have a journal and a memory journal. I’ve been writing down some of the memories of our son which seems to help process them and now I have a record so I won’t forget good memories.

If I get up and drink a cup of coffee, I’m usually pretty good. It’s the getting up and getting coffee that is hard sometimes. It’s hard in the evenings too. He was my video game and movie watching buddy.  :)

Almost everything I did involved my son as I was doing partial homeschool with him and we loved hanging out most of the time. He loved board games, video games, movies, music, playing outside, sports, etc. Amazingly fun kid!

He was old enough to even do the things I had previously just done on my own when he was younger for exercise and well being like pickleball and choir.

It’s hard to want to do any of those things…I just have no desire without him.

How do I grieve without feeling apathetic? Do I force myself to do the things that aren’t enjoyable anymore and just cry through them? Does it get easier to find moments of happiness or joy?

Thanks!

My interpretation has its own point to make, though I suspect that (once again) it'll take quite a few paragraphs to get there. All in good fun!

🌟 Wishing you all a Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and a jolly ""Whatever else you celebrate around this time!"" For me, it's: ""Sleeping In.""

# Prologue

T'was Christmas Eve, in a drafty little garage that smelled of fuel, cigarettes and beer. In it lived lived a man who no longer waved at other riders.

He had started riding as most of us do: dreaming of the perfect bike and gear, eager to join this new community. But over the years, the miles, close calls, frustration and dollars all added up. Enthusiasm turned to bitterness, and somewhere along that rusty chain (due for maintenance, by the way), the dream hardened.

They called him Eben ""Kneezdown"" Scrooge. Some still wonder if he was truly *that* fearsome track rider from way back when. Except today, if you asked him about motorcycling, he would say:

*""Why pay all those insurance premiums just to become an organ donor?""*

Ah, but his bike in the corner of that garage said otherwise. It was in perfect running order (well, apart from the chain), fuelled, charged and ready to roll at a moment's notice.

Curious... That a man who barely rode still tended to a machine that, on a ""good"" day, would be on the receiving end of a string of insults, hiding a deep nostalgia that never went away.

That night, as the snow pressed itself against the thin garage windows and as the rest of the world enjoyed their families and festivities, Scrooge sat in an old chair with a worn-out backrest, scrolling through the F9 parts catalog (or so we'd like to think). A seat he didn't need. A 5th jacket. Titanium exhaust for a bike that had nowhere to go.

*Ding!* The phone chimed. Some insufferable employee of his, Bob, texted him with great optimism: “Xmas ride? We meetin at mine tomorrow morn. Come teach these guys a thing r 2 bout slow races lol.”

Scrooge obviously ignored the text. He had other things to do, like sit around, shop, and wallow in regret (a usual pastime).

He was about to click “checkout” on a cart big enough to feed a small village when the laptop flickered. The overhead light buzzed. Something made of metal clinked, faint but unmistakable, like chains dragged over concrete.

From the opposite corner of the garage, where an old, bent brake rotor leaned against a stack of dead tires, something stepped into the light.

It wore a ripped leather jacket and a helmet that took one beating too many. Bits of smashed fairings and twisted engine blocks clattered at its feet, all linked together like a dreadful chain.

“*Kneezdown!*” the figure roared, visor fogged with spectral breath. “Don’t you recognize me?”

The ghost flipped up its visor system (modular helmet, nice). In its gaze was the face of every fallen rider, every totalled bike, bad decision and questionable mod from the past, all concentrated within the iris of the haunting figure. Scrooge sat there with his brow raised in disbelief.

“I am the Ghost of Biker’s Regret,” it said. “And I’m here to warn you.”

“Great” Scrooge muttered. “Even my conscience remembers to gear up.”

The ghost rattled its chain of busted parts. Slowly, and with spooky emphasis, it sung: “Tonight, you’ll be visited by three spirits. They are not here to sell you gear. They’re here to show you the rider you were, the rider you are, and the rider you might become.”

Scrooge opened his mouth to argue, but suddenly, the garage dissolved around him, and he was quickly transported through time and space.

# Chapter I: The Ghost of Biker’s Past

Having landed on firm ground, nausea instantly set in.  Scrooge leapt for the litter bin some metres away. When he finally came to, he noticed he was standing in a much smaller, messier garage.

There it was. The first one. His long-lost beginner bike! Bodywork faded, exhaust that sounded like a fart you let out after eating too many beans. Milk crate bungee-corded to the rear. Stickers over scratches, and scratches covering older scratches.

And there he was, too. Only younger (yet surprisingly just as ugly). Certified DOT-only helmet at the ready, grin so wide it looked like it might crack his face. He had just passed his road exam, and the plates were still temporary. His gloves were too big and his jacket too thin, but he had absolutely no care in the world.

He touched the bars with a degree of respect he would come to forget about.

“Remember that?” the Ghost of Biker’s Past asked, suddenly standing beside him. The chains were gone. Now it carried only a roll of old paper maps and a better looking helmet (with some bugs stuck on the visor).

Scrooge watched his younger self wobble onto the street for the first time, legs stiff, hands a little too eager on the throttle.

“I remember it well,” he said quietly.

Back then, everything felt miraculous. Making a clean turn was a miracle. Not stalling at a light was a miracle. Finding a new road five minutes from his house that he’d somehow never seen before felt like discovering a lost city.

He rode in cheap gear. He messed up almost every line and took corners far slower than he bragged about afterward. He made friends in parking lots just cause they also had bikes. There was no ""style"" yet, no war to claim an identity. Cruiser, sport, dirt: it didn’t matter. Everyone was just a new member trying to figure things out, in a community that felt more welcoming than it did exclusive.

“Were you naive?” the ghost asked. “You were. You forgot about the risk. You didn’t yet know how much could go wrong... how you would come to blame yourself for...”

""Enough!"" yelled present-day Scrooge, as the younger version of himself almost dropped the bike trying to slow race at some stop sign, then saved it at the last second, laughing at himself and circling back to try again.

“But,” the ghost added, “you were also awake. Every ride was etched in your mind, like a treasure. The bike was teaching you things about yourself, showing you who you were, mile by imperfect mile.”

Scrooge watched his rookie self meet a stranger at a gas pump, talk for twenty minutes about nothing, exchange numbers, and actually follow up. He watched late-night rides home where the cold got into his bones yet he still took the long way just to stay on two wheels a little longer.

The garage rippled again. The beginner bike faded. The young man, flushed with winter-cold cheeks and wide-eyed hope, rode away into the dark with a riding buddy by his side.

“Why show me this?” Scrooge snapped, suddenly feeling defensive. “You want me to regret becoming safer? More experienced?”

The ghost shook its head. “No. I want you to remember what it felt like when riding meant more than just surviving.”

The air turned cold. The maps fluttered. Scrooge closed his eyes and things went dark.

# Chapter II: Ghost of Biker’s Present

Thankfully, there was another litter bin nearby. The feeling of time travel isn't just something you ""get used to."" Now, Scrooge was standing in a dealership.

It was *his* dealership.

Rows upon rows of new bikes. Chromed-out cruisers, ADV bikes longing to see some dirt trails. Also, a semi-annoyed secretary, and a well-dressed sales rep hunting for his holiday bonus... that kind of setting. Meanwhile, a grumpy old man could be seen through an office window, tallying all the money he made this season.

The man was Scrooge, earlier that very morning.

Meanwhile, the second ghost took this opportunity of distraction to suddenly appear next to the other Scrooge, still trying to combat the nausea. This time, it wore brand new gear. It kind of looked like a ""squid,"" to be perfectly honest.

“Oh, not you..."" said Scrooge, ""And what the hell are you wearing?""

""Look,"" the Ghost of Biker’s Present said, nodding toward the showroom.

Down on the floor, Bob was struggling. He was an enthusiastic salesman, but often lacked the ability to ""swindle"" the customer, talking in the way experienced salesmen bait their clients to make a sale.

Scrooge watched the exchange, silently judging the poor technique. The ghost stood at his shoulder, silent.

“If he closes that deal, he makes his end-of-year bonus,” Scrooge muttered. “Pays off his kid’s dentist, and keeps the landlord at bay a little longer.”

“And if he doesn’t?” the ghost asked.

Scrooge shrugged. “He gets what he deserves.”

The customer eventually left with a brochure instead of a bike. Bob smiled until the man walked out, then let his shoulders collapse for a second before straightening up for the next round.

“You trained him well,” the ghost said.

Scrooge snorted. “To fail at sales?”

“To believe,” the ghost answered, “that someone should buy a bike for the right reasons. Because they truly enjoy it, not just because it has features.”

The ghost’s hand drifted toward the picture frame on Scrooge’s desk, the one he always placed at the edge of his vision but never quite looked at.

“Pick it up,” the ghost said.

It pictured two younger men grinning from behind dusty glass. Helmets off, hair wild from the wind, bikes behind them. One was Scrooge, eyes bright, posture loose. The other was his old riding buddy, Jacob.

The one he started the dealership with... The one he hadn’t spoken to since that day they rolled out together, when only one of them rode back.

The photograph had been taken a week before the crash.

“He still can’t walk properly,” the ghost said. Scrooge said nothing.

“You were reckless,” the ghost continued. “You think one stupid moment sealed your friend’s future. And you blame yourself.”

The ghost turned the photo slightly, so the overhead light flickered across the faces.

“But what you never admit,” it went on, “is what that day did to you.”

Scrooge gulped. The dealership hum faded under the sound of his own pulse.

“You became fixated on survival,” the ghost said, almost gently. “On doing everything by the book, not because you suddenly loved rules, but because you wanted to buy back a moment you can never undo.”

The ghost pointed toward the showroom. Toward the racks of top-shelf helmets, armoured jackets, the laminated “Essential Gear Checklist” Scrooge had insisted every salesman hand out like scripture.

“You started riding less for the experience and more as a form of penance,” it said. “Every premium jacket, every advanced safety course, every lecture you gave was a payment into a debt no one actually asked you to pay.”

He thought of the years after the accident, when he’d still forced himself onto the bike occasionally. Wrapped in the best gear money could buy, checking and re-checking tire pressure, riding stiff, small and paranoid that another disaster was waiting for him beyond the apex of every corner he leaned into.

His old joy of riding had faded. A near miss here, a nightmare there, a sudden flash of his friend’s broken body whenever a truck loomed in his mirrors. Fear, at first a passenger, gradually took agency away from the one riding.

“Now you sit up here,” the ghost said, “isolated from the people that could benefit from your experience and stories.""

Scrooge’s grip on the picture frame tightened.

“At the bottom of it all,"" said the ghost, ""you’re terrified of making another mistake. So you chose a version of yourself who never risks enough to be wrong.”

The sales bell chimed as someone bought a (premium) keychain. On the floor, Bob stared for a moment at the unsold bike, then glanced up toward Scrooge’s dark office window, as if wondering whether his boss could see how badly he was failing at this.

The dealership lights flickered. The ghost’s reflection in the window began to blur.

“Time to see where this version of you ends up,” it said.

The office dissolved into darkness.

# Chapter III: The Ghost of Biker’s Future

The silence broke with the sound of a phone ringing. Except Scrooge wasn't done hurling into the nearby trash can.

When he gathered his wits, he looked around and found that he was back where he started, in his drafty garage. But everything was slightly... wrong. The bike was taken apart, rusted. His desk was worn. The calendar was of a different year, well into the future.

The Ghost of Biker’s Future sat in his chair, boots up on the desk, helmet still on, visor blacked out. The phone between them rang and rang.

The ghost did not speak. It simply gestured toward the phone. Scrooge picked up. It was Bob’s wife.

“Mr. Scrooge,” she said, voice thin with effort. “Have you seen Bob? He left this morning. Said he was going for a ride with some guys from the shop. He was supposed to be back hours ago. He’s not answering.”

The air thickened. Silence.

“We’ve called the hospitals,” she went on. “The police. They’re sending someone to check the route.”

Her voice cracked. “We thought maybe…” she tried again. “Maybe he stopped by your place, to invite you as he usually does.”

The line went dead, and the ghost stood up, towering above Scrooge.

“He went for a ride, he's fine. He's f-f-fine, right?” Scrooge stuttered.

The scene shifted without warning. Now, Scrooge was out on the shoulder of a narrow, twisting road with police cars, tow trucks, and high beams painting the trees an ugly blue-white.

He saw a skid mark, a gap in the guardrail. Far below, glittering through the trees, something metallic and wrong.

“Don’t,” Scrooge whispered. “Don’t show me this.”

The ghost didn’t bother narrating the rest. It let him watch.

Bob’s bike, crushed against a tree. The helmet lying too far away from the rest of him. The sickening choreography of professionals doing what they could, then doing the other thing they do when there’s nothing left to save.

Later, the paperwork. The news story. The memorial ride organized by people who’d barely known Bob but needed to do something with their own fear.

Then Bob’s family in the dealership, faces hollow. His kid standing near the helmets, staring at the mannequins dressed for adventures his father would never take him on.

And Scrooge, silent behind the counter, recognizing every note of the nightmare he’d been living since his friend’s crash, now replaying in his mind.

""I hired him, I was the one who got him into bikes in the first place!"" Scrooge told himself, hands covering his face and wishing this nightmare would end.

The last thing Scrooge saw before the darkness took him back to his own time was a parking lot on some future Christmas morning. Bikes of all kinds. Laughter. Steam from takeout coffee in the cold. Bob telling a story with his hands. His old friend, Jacob, sitting in a folding chair, cane resting nearby, heckling from the sidelines.

And Scrooge himself, older but unmistakably alive, helmet in hand, about to lead a slow, careful, happy ride out of the lot.

When he opened his eyes, he was back in his garage, present-day, heart pounding, and only slightly nauseous this time. Daylight broke from outside his window.

# Epilogue: Christmas Morning

For a long moment he just sat there, breathing.

The ghosts had left him with no excuses and no anesthetic. He saw it now with a kind of painful clarity: how greed, fear and loneliness had been haunting him for years, whispering directions. He’d hoarded money, hoarded control, hoarded even his own affection. He’d bought gear instead of buying coffee for the people who actually wanted him around. He’d turned his dealership, the one he started so optimistically with his friend, into a mausoleum of regret.

He’d been too preoccupied with surviving that he forgot about living entirely.

On his computer, a browser tab sat open where he’d gone on a late-night spree the night before: brand-new jackets, gloves, base layers, fancy rain gear.

He looked at the total again. It was obscene. He smiled.

“Alright,” he said into the empty garage. “Let’s do something stupid, but in a different direction this time.”

He hit “Place My Order Now.""

Then he opened his texts. There, halfway down the screen, was Bob’s reminder message from the night before: ""Xmas morning meet, 9 a.m, my place. You’re still welcome to join, boss.""

For the first time in a long time, Scrooge responded: ""I’ll be there.""

His thumb hovered, that old reflex to soften, to add a “maybe” or ""I'll try."" He deleted nothing. He just hit send.

The morning came in hard and bright. Crisp air, salt dust on the roads. Scrooge actually felt nervous as he wheeled the old bike out of its corner. The battery, against all odds, obliged. The engine coughed once and then came to life, filling the garage with a sound he’d almost forgotten about.

He geared up. Not in the new gear he had collected throughout the years. In the old gear. The gear he treasured and kept tucked away in some dusty cardboard box.

By the time he arrived at Bob's, the place was already vibrating with life. Bikes lined up crookedly, riders stamping their feet against the cold, everyone talking too loud.

Bob spotted him first. His eyes widened. “Scrooge?! You… rode here?”

“Don’t make it weird,” Scrooge said, killing the engine. His voice shook more than he wanted it to. Whether from the cold or the nerves, he wasn’t sure.

The conversations around them began to falter as riders recognized the man who usually only existed upstairs in the glass office, frowning at spreadsheets and occasionally descending to lecture about liability.

“What’s in the box?” someone asked.

Scrooge dropped it onto the nearest picnic table with a thud. The tape popped dramatically.

“Bad decisions,” he said. “The good kind, for once. I picked them up on the way here.” (*What? You thought an order from F9 wouldn't be ready same-day?)*

Out spilled fresh gear in crinkling plastic: jackets, gloves, helmets, the works. A rainbow of sizes and styles, the sort of haul most riders drooled over in a browser window but only bought piecemeal when their old stuff literally disintegrated.

Scrooge took a breath. “I’ve spent the last decade trying to buy my way out of one bad day,” he said, loud enough for the nearby cluster to hear. “I ordered all this for myself, because that’s what I do instead of riding.”

“But last night,” he went on, “I had… let’s call it a wake-up call. About how useless all this is if it just sits there, never touching the road. So here’s what I'm doing. I'm giving all this stuff away.”

He paused, and smiled. ""My only condition is you go ride in it. With other people. And enjoy it.”

First, silence. Followed by a surge of laughter and cheer. The group flocked toward the table like they were kids again. Someone filmed on their phone. Someone else actually teared up trying on a jacket that finally fit right.

Bob just stood there, watching his boss hand out gear with the manic generosity of a changed man.

Scrooge looked at him, really looked at him. At the tired lines around his eyes from being overworked, at that thriving optimism that still remained even after all the hardship he put him through.

“I'm sorry I've been a ghost. It's time I lived a little."" Scrooge said simply, and smiled.

Bob smiled back. “So… that’s a yes to the ride, then?”

Scrooge thought of his friend, the hospital lights, the limp that would never fully go away. He thought of the ghost showing him an old man peering out a window at bikes he no longer dared get close to.

Then he thought of the other future he briefly witnessed, at the end of it all.

“Yeah,” he said, feeling the word settle into his chest like something finally clicking into place.

Bob clapped him on the shoulder. “Let's see if you can still ride, *Kneesdown*!”

The lot erupted in laughter. Minutes later, engines fired up one by one. The air filled with that familiar cocktail of exhaust and excitement. Scrooge swung a leg over his bike, heart beating fast, but this time the fear didn’t feel like a cage. It felt like a reminder: be here, be careful, stay alive.

He took his place not at the front, and Bob rolled up alongside.

“Ready?” Bob shouted over the idle.

Scrooge looked down the line of bikes, out at the road ahead, at the thin winter sun trying to make something of itself.

“For the first time in a long time,” he said.

Scrooge wasn’t alone anymore. He rolled on the throttle, gentle but sure, and followed his people out into the Christmas morning. Not as the cold, lonely guardian of a showroom, but as something warmer, messier and human: a rider among riders.

*A huge thank you to those who read this far down. I also want to take the time to thank everyone who has supported and commented on these posts over the past couple of months. In many ways, I am a Scrooge-type character in my own life, and I often isolate when things get too ""real."" Having a place like this to converse has shown me that things aren't as lonely as I make them out to be. It's always nice to exchange worldviews with other people who care, other people who shape this vast community of motorcycling and express its differences. Cheers, and the next one will be a short one! (or so I keep saying)*

1ptbfon,https://i.redd.it/kxdl6uj0pt8g1.png,A simple web app I'm working on for making custom topo contour coasters for laser engraving,"Hey! TopoCoaster has been an idea bouncing around in my head for a few years and I finally decided to actually build it.

I originally bought an xTool F1 because I wanted to make contour line coasters, and this kind of grew out of that. I wanted something more approachable than doing everything manually, so I turned it into a small web app and figured I’d share where it’s at.

Everything is rendered client side right now so I don’t have to paywall it, but that also means it can be a little sluggish and definitely still buggy in spots. This is very much a work in progress.

It does support 3D printing too, but that part is pretty janky at the moment. The STL export gives you separate bodies that you’ll need to boolean together in your slicer or 3D app. I tried doing that automatically in code and it was way slower and more painful than expected, so this is the temporary solution.

I’ll be adding more features and cleaning things up over the next few weeks, but I’d really like feedback at this stage.

If you’re interested, give it a try and let me know what you think.  I'm open to suggestions and improvements!

I don’t understand.  
I have been lost for weeks.  
I’m not sure where I am.  
But above all.  
Why is no one looking for me?

I have family, friends, others who I know, but why is no one searching for me?

Night has fallen, it’s dark, but above all, extremely cold. Which could be explained by the fact that it is autumn. The huge trees around me are all naked. They have let go of their leaves. It’s both comforting and a bit scary, the crunch of the leaves underneath my shoes is. At least I know there is some type of life around me. The wind is blowing on my back. A shiver goes up my spine and I wrap my arms around my body to feel some kind of warmth. It doesn’t help. I am wandering but I have no clue where. I have been here for a couple of days and I regret even taking a step in this forest.

I walked on deserted roads, how long could it have been? my phone died days ago… It has been hours since I saw even a sign of life. Unless you call the weeds next to these roads full of life. I kicked against a stone, missed. When I thought of life in the open I thought it would be fun, but this is getting rather scary. Who in its smart mind walks away from a random abandoned house they went to search. I should have never done so. My path continues. I try to look everywhere. No humans, animals, flowers, trees, plants. The only thing I see is a long road, which I am not sure where it is headed and the sky that is covered by clouds. Maybe that's why I entered the forest, because here there was nothing else than the sky and its haunting clouds that followed me everywhere I went.

At least here the trees cover so much that the only thing entering is a bit of sunlight or the moon that is shining its lights. Well actually, the moon doesn’t shine, the sun gives its light to the moon so that it looks like the moon shines. Really, the moon is just weak and lets itself be overpowered by the sun. But I won’t let myself be overpowered. I will find my way back home and once I do, me and my family will have a good talk. They will be worried at first, asking what happened. And I will tell them the whole story. Then after a day we can all laugh about it over a cup of coffee or tea. I will drink tea because I don’t like coffee. My older brother will drink coffee just like my parents. And eventually we will even forget anything happened at all. 

I know it is day time again because of the bits of sunlight shining through. A leaf falls right in front of me. I wish magic was real, that the leaves would lead a path towards home, like in the movies. But it doesn’t, I have to find my way all by myself. But eventually will come a day where I won’t be wandering alone. Then I will see all my loved ones and will feel warmth again. But for now I will just follow the paths I think are best, eventually every path leads to a road and every road will lead to people, and people will help me get to my family.

My friend and I went together. Her black Fiat driving us to where we want to go. It’s a first. Well, she drove before, and I had been the passenger before. We would turn the music so loud, other cars would honk at us to turn it down. Not like it bothered us, we were vibing. But it was the first time going to an abandoned house. We were both thrilled by the idea of visiting ghosts. Maybe because we watched a lot of ghost hunting and true crime. We heard about this house multiple times. It served as a hospital for people that all had the same illness. It was a deadly one, and at that time no one had a cure. It was believed that the doctors did nothing for the patients, maybe took an organ or two when they died. That is why it is hunted, because all that the patient wanted was a little help in their suffering, instead they got disrespected when they died.

I sit down on a tree stump and hopelessly stare in front of me. I know I should really just keep going and figure it all out, but sometimes it feels impossible. And it is okay to rest a bit right? Some ants walk over the countless of leaves that lay spread on the ground. I try to stomp it but miss. Maybe that was for the better. I think about how this ant has a family too. Imagine finding out that a loved one died. That would be horrible. It rings in my mind ‘that would be horrible’. I am right, no one deserves to miss a loved one. As difficult as it is, I can not get hopeless. I stand up and take another step towards… I am not sure. But I can’t stop now, I have a family, so I can’t die.

Maybe it is stupid to go further when you see a sign with big red writing. ‘No access for unauthorized people’. But also, a sign doesn’t stop us. It did make us hesitate. But we had spent our money on equipment. All kinds of ghost hunting stuff. Some we didn’t even know the name of, some we didn’t even know how to use. But it was all for fun. The entrance of the building wasn’t a door. It was a hole, the door laid next to it. We had laughed, maybe it was out of nerves that we started making jokes. But on the other hand the feeling of being alone in such a building gave a kick. Yes, we weren’t fully alone. Not if we should believe what we heard. Then we would be surrounded with hundreds of spirits, good and bad ones. 

Now, I don’t want to be alone. Maybe that is why I feel so emotional when I finally see my way out of this forest. I am not sure how many of days I wandered here. It is countless. I run the last bit, feeling something wet on my cheek so I wipe it away. Finally after all this time I escaped this forest. The one that on some days made me feel trapped like a dog in a cage. Other times it made me feel scared when I saw wild life animals. Luckily none ever did anything to me. I am a lucky person really. Always have been.

I won! I won! I won the contest and I had to do nothing for it. Well not more than buying a lottery ticket. I held the ticket in my hands. My brother had laughed at me. It is a one in a billion. Why would you spend money on a paper with numbers? It had not bothered me. I might be one in a billion. That was the fun of it. A lot of people would be watching this show on their tube tvs and get to hear that there was one lucky winner. The numbers were said carefully and with each number I got more hope. I couldn’t believe it at first when I heard I won. With our handset phone I dialed the number. They asked a couple of questions. The money I would get? I would spend it on those who are ill and on my family of course.

Maybe that is why I never gave up. Not when my friend already left with the car. Not when I didn’t know my way back. Not when I saw no sign of life and not when I was lost in the forest. I have never given up. A car drove by. I try to sign but it does not stop. It makes sense, no one stops for strangers. But at least I know there is a sign of life here. I could follow the road, the way the car went. If I do there is a big change I will end up in a town. A busy one. It does not matter if it’s not our town. I could ask around, get help. People could help me. And maybe it will take a couple of days still but I can manage. I can do this, I will get there where I want to be. Everyone will be grateful.

I’m not someone who gives up. so the first time we hear something weird we don’t immediately stand up and take the closest exit to escape. Instead I stand up to look where it comes from. But I see nothing. Even with our flashlights. The whole night all we heard were sounds and noises. We even had equipment that made us know what the ghosts said. We asked questions and got actual answers. We each asked our questions. I asked If we were here at the right time. The words we got were: ‘good’ ‘time’ ‘right, yes’. It was fascinating. My friend asked: ‘when will we die?’ We laughed until the answer was ‘today’ ‘2025’. That was scary. That was when we decided to leave.

But we didn’t die. I know I didn’t. And for my friend, I am sure she took the car and drove up. I feel that they are safe. I hope they feel I am too. The road underneath my feet is hard. It is easy to walk on, but boring. I wave at any passing car but none even notices me. That is how it feels. They don’t wave back. They don’t honk their horns. Even with life around me it doesn't feel alive. Because no one acts alive. But once I reach the town I will interact with more people. I will find more hope than I had in these couple of days, weeks, months, whatever it is. But for now I have to slender on these roads, for the next couple of days. Until I will find the hope I need.

I lost hope before, maybe that is why I'm so keen on keeping it now. Nothing went how I wanted it to go and for the first time in life I lost a spark. One that I always carried. My mom noticed, but she didn’t mention it. Not until it was the right time to. We sat together and she started to ask questions. It was difficult to answer. I didn’t know if I should go with the easy lies or the more complicated truth. But I am happy I chose the truth. I learned to never lose hope again. Hope lies in the small things of life. Sometimes it can be difficult but even then it is good to keep hope. That is what I did the last couple of weeks, and that is what I will keep doing for the rest of my life.

Church bells. Church bells ring. And for now that is my hope. Churches stand in the middle of cities. They are there for recognition and so everyone knows where to be at. Not only do these sounds tell me that I am near a town, it also tells me what day it is. Sunday. I had been wandering around not knowing which day it was but after this day that would change. Maybe it will take until Monday for me to talk to someone, to tell my story, to tell what I want and to ask If they can help me get to my family. Maybe I am lucky enough to have been walking to my town immediately. Maybe I don’t have to ask anyone anything and can I soon hug my loved ones, maybe let my feelings flow a bit. And then, I will drink a cup of hot tea.

We ran, left our equipment on the ground. I’m not sure if I ran because my friend did or if I actually was scared. We ran through the small corridors of this haunted building. The only sound was the wind blowing through the places that windows were supposed to be at and our footsteps clicking on the concrete grounds beneath us. We ran until we found the exit. The car was parked on the other side of the road. We were considering going in again for our equipment, but a single sound, that I am not sure of was a ghost or the wind blowing through the trees, got us moving again. We ran over the road. My friend warned me. Loudly shouting my name. I found myself lying on the road when a car had passed by. And suddenly my friend ran to the car and left me alone. At first I thought it was a joke, but she didn’t come back. 

That is why I am still wandering. I think we are good, we are still friends. And when we see each other we will hug tightly, maybe we will cry and then laugh about how scary it was and that we would never go back. But for now I will wait at this church. It is night. The night from Sunday to Monday. For now I will sit back and relax. And once it is day time again I will ask for help. I sit against the stone wall of the church. No one is around, not walking around at least. I know that there are people around. The tiny houses and their lights give signs of life. And even if I haven’t actually seen it I know that there are people. And knowing I’m not alone anymore makes me more grateful than I have ever been.

I like humans. Yes, we destroy our world bit by bit, but at a faster pace we build it up again. Think about all these houses. We don’t have to build them ourselves, other people that have the actual talent to build houses build them. And even they couldn’t do it alone. If there wouldn’t be someone who makes drawings of how everything has to look then the builders wouldn’t know where or how to build. Humans are so unique, we each have our own talents. One is a judge while another is a doctor. One is a priest while another is a cashier. One likes dancing while another likes reading. One is good at talking while another is good at listening. We all have our own triads that we are born with. And through all these differences we are still human. We all have a heart and soul. We are all connected.

I don’t know how long I have been standing here but no one listens. We are all human right? Then why does no one help? I tried it friendly: ‘may I ask something?’ But I got ignored. Ignored. They didn’t even look at me. I need help. Why can’t they see? I took deep breaths, I can do this. But days went by. I have followed people, so I could hear what place I am at. It is not my town, I know it is nearby. With a car. And I don’t want to wander alone anymore. I have people around now. Maybe they are ignoring me, but I’m not going to leave. I’m safe now and I want to be safer. 

Feeling safe is when you are surrounded by people. Maybe one known person or maybe countless unknown ones. But I feel safe when I’m surrounded by people. They might not know me, they might not see me, but every time I’m around people I feel happy. Imagine a mall. Clothing stores, where people try on the different outfits they like. bakeries where everyone gets their favourite type of pastries. ice cream shops where kids beg their moms if they can get a cone with at least one scoop. Jewelry stores where people try on real silver and gold. Now imagine a mall. Clothing stores, bakeries, ice cream shops and jewelry stores, with no people. That feels unsafe.

A name, not mine or anyone's really, a place name. My place name. I live there. In a fast pace I walk over ‘can you bring me there?’ but again I get ignored. Though the man is talking to someone else, he probably can’t hear me. So I ask again. This time the man walks away. But it is my only opportunity. I walk behind him. Maybe what I’m about to do is abnormal, but I need to get there. There where the man is driving to. I ask again and he seems to give a nod. He opens the back door of the car and goes ahead to put something on those chairs. I sit down. Finally after a week, a bit more because it is Wednesday again, of wandering in this town I finally will get to mine.

We sat in the car. It is so much different from when me and my friend did. We were talking the whole time through. This man didn’t even say a single word. Not to me. Not when I asked him a simple question. Maybe he wasn’t one to talk to strangers. And his music taste was okay. Not my vibe, and those old radios often make weird noises. They hurt your ears. But I couldn’t be more than grateful. This man was bringing me to my family, to my friends. Finally I would be able to see them. They must be worried. But the only thing I can do is smile. I miss them, they probably miss me. But when I will be back home everything will be normal again. We will cry, laugh, be serious and whatever but above all, we will be together.

I know this place! I know where I am! The man stops his car and I step out. I thank the man a million times, but he doesn’t even bat an eye. What a gentle man. It is not far away. I know it isn’t. I will walk towards the church and from there I can walk back to my house. I feel weird. I want to cry but I can’t. Maybe there are too many emotions right now. But there is one mission. That is getting back home. Soon I will have a cup of tea. I will tell my brother all about what happened. I will sit in and relish in the warmth our house provides. I can not wait.

From the church I walk my way on the path I know leads me towards home. I greet the people I know, but no one looks at me. They aren’t happy. It doesn’t look like they missed me. At a fast pace I walk towards the only place I want to be at the most. I can not keep myself from running when I see the house. The one we live in. The one I missed for days, weeks, months. I knock on the wooden door. And once again. Only after the third time the door opens. My brother opens the door. I am ready for a hug. With a smile I look at him. But he bypasses me. This is not like him. We are close.

Ever since I remember me and my brother were together. We walked our way to our school. When people were being mean he was the first one to defend me. I would always talk good about him. Of course we fought, those meaningless fights. But in the evening when it was cold we would share the bed to get warm. Innocent little children we were. We would look at each other when mom asked how the food was, only to joke around and say it tasted like cartons. He is the reason I believe in humanity. The reason why humans make me happy. The reason even silly little things can clear my mood. So this is not like him.

I follow like I always have done. He walks the paths I just walked on. Back to the church. It is not Sunday. Why is he going to church? I follow silently. His footsteps sound heavy. They crushed the leaves that were still laying on the path. My footsteps were quiet. His breath was heavy. Mine was silent. His fingers were fidgeting with each other. Mine were hanging next to my body. He stops. Stones. I know that grandma has her place somewhere here. Is he visiting her? But I know. he chooses another path, one that leads to a stone I have never seen. One that writes my name. My brother bails his eyes out. While I can’t even cry. I try to hold his shoulder, to tell him I’m right here. But my hand goes through his body.



Maybe I knew from the beginning. That I wasn’t anymore. Maybe I knew that time I reminded myself that I had not eaten or drank anything in weeks. Or maybe when rain was falling down but I didn’t feel it on my skin. Maybe it was because I never felt exhausted after walking for days. Maybe when no one seemed to see me. Maybe it was even way back, when I fell on the road. When my friend screamed my name in fear. When I felt pain. When I saw that car pass. Through me. When my friend drove away so fast because she had seen it all. Maybe that is why I never stayed. I don’t want to hunt the building. I want to be with my loved ones. I needed to find my way back before it was too late. I wanted to live even though I died.

Also would really like a double boiler for lattes/cappuccinos and the Gaggia is only single boiler.  If I can save myself the trouble, I’d like to spend the extra $$$. 

So I’m going back and forth about my first buy and I had my heart set on the Gaggia classic pro and I’d add mods. I’m pretty handy and tech savvy so I didn’t mind, but I don’t take enough time for myself to do extra projects atm. 

I’d rather wait a little bit to get a machine I don’t have to mod than to get a machine that I’d like to mod (not necessary, but I gravitated to the brand because of the mods and price point). I’ve been using whatever “espresso” machine (glorified coffee machine) I can get my hands on but I miss working at a cafe and having that big industrial machine. I obviously don’t have a need or the counter space for that, but the home version would be nice. 

I’m at a point now where I want to stop researching and actually purchase. I’ve got a brand new space now and it can fit 1.3 Gaggias lol and a grinder. If I could save myself the trouble of modding and get a machine that has all the cool features that people mod, I’d rather do that. I won’t say moneys no object, but I do actually have a whole savings just for this purchase so I have a nice cushion for this exact reason which is why I’ve been dragging my feet a bit. 

I’m open to all advice & if you think it’s still better to just get the Gaggia and do the mods lmk; I feel like stepping into the new year crossing this off my list, but I want to make sure I don’t get buyers remorse by finding out I could have saved $150-$250 more  (including the cost of mod parts etc.) and got a machine that does everything already without mods.  

Thank you in advance, happy holidays!

I just finished watching a new video of Lance Hedrick about a new soup recipe: [Zuppa Lunga](https://youtu.be/xrKsjy7nh8Y?si=oOjueXJhBczTm_rq). It's basically a little bit lighter soup, but with much larger yield. In principle, almost the same beans weight, but ground coarser and water filled to the top.

I am very excited to try it out, as I too was always a bit frustrated to finish my 1:3 soup very quickly after a few sips. That new recipe gives me hope.

I would like to know if people already tried it, and specifically with a K6? I usually grind at 55 with the K6 for normal soup with the ORB, I am curious to know how much I should go coarser for that Zuppa Lunga recipe?

Was it hypothermia? How to improve?,"I thing I suffered from hypothermia and a race that I wasn't expecting to feel this way. I want some advice and ways to improve for future events as it looks like I was the only one shivering.

This is my 3rd year doing OW races. Up until now those races would take me between 45 minutes and 1:30.

Yesterday I did my first 10k in a river, downstream (very little current), and first time in this particular river. It took me 2hs and 30m. This was my first race of the season (southern hemisphere).

The water was maybe a bit cold, but it felt similar to my previous swims, in fact I felt confident with that temperature. I took 2 energy gel at 45 minutes and 1:30, and a cup of Gatorade at 1:10 that they served near shore at 5k mark.

**Immediately after coming out, I was shivering a lot, legs and arms. My friends told me I was very pale. Someone offered me a coffee and I split it all due to how much I was shivering. When someone asked my something I couldn't talk, like there was a delay between me thinking what to answer and the actual movement of my mouth.**

What makes me wonder what happened is that I was the only one on that condition. And almost no one was wearing a wet suit. Was it lack of training? Eating incorrectly? I go to a nutritionist specialized in sports and I followed her indications. The month before I gained 1kg, and the day before that I ate a lot of carbs the whole day. Was it Hypothermia? Can someone be particularly more prone to hypothermia than others? I'm 34yo male 63kg

I want to be safe. For now I won't swim that distance or that particular river again. For now I'll stick to the races that I've already swung. But I'd like to improve for future events and be prepared for longer distances.

While I was shivering, the first thing I thought was it was muscle fatigue and that I needed to eat. So I ate a protein bar and 500ml of gatorade. The shivering continued maybe for 15 minutes and I was getting better little by little.

After some time I thought that maybe I was hypothermic. So I remembered some things that happened during the race:

During the second half I felt that my mouth shivered a little. Not constantly but like 3 times in different moments. Also, the water felt cold in my arms and legs the entire race. In previous races maybe the first 5 minutes I felt the water a bit cold and then it become ""normal"", not cold and neither hot. Not this time.

Maybe at 2/3 of the race, while sighting I was something at my left on the shore. Sighted again and I thought I saw a big monument of someone with straight arm pointing in the direction of the river. I sighted more times and I was that same thing at my left. I thought WTF and stopped and looked, there was no monument just trees. Did I hallucinate?",1,1766437907.0,OpenWaterSwimming,0,1.0,False

I wanted to try to make a Nakashima-style piece. I've made plenty of furniture, but nothing using large-slabs.<br><br>


Constraints were:<br>

Lack of experience choosing and working with large slabs and difficulty sourcing quality slabs here in PNW.<br><br>


I found the walnut slab in the last pic.  It was a high-quality slab in the sense that it was well-leveled, and well-dried.  It came complete with (what I was told) was a piece of buried rebar on the left! Due to lack of experience, I didn't notice (see inexperience) that it was a slab cut well towards the outside of the tree, and hence there was a good deal of curvature on the outside ('bark-side') edges of the slab. Also, under the blue-circled section the wood was quite thin after removal of the bark and clean-up.<br>



What to do?<br><br>

The ""rebar"" fortunately turned out to be a large diameter remnant of a screw, and I was able to turn it out! What to do with the hole and damage? Wabi-sabi style, I decided to leave it in.<br><br>



If the slab were destined to be a table, perhaps the thin section could have been left in. But I felt  that as a coffee-table it was possible that at some point someone would sit on it or something. I couldn't see how to support that section from underneath, given the all the curvature and irregularity. So I just cut that section out, following the grain. (I wonder what Nakashima would have done?) (Using the other side of the slab as top wouldn't work, it had a great deal of staining and sapwood, didn't look good).<br><br>



I wanted some more apparent thickness to the sides too, so felt like I had to cut into the slab all the way around in order to reintroduce a side that didn't immediately dive off underneath the table. To compensate for the now somewhat boring flat and cut sides, I used a spokeshave to re-introduce some facets, which make it interesting for the eyes and fingers.<br><br>



I didn't much like how this result in a hard-wood/sapwood transition right in the middle of the sides, and played with the idea of toning that sapwood out, but my wife talked me out of it. I think she was right.<br><br>



I added to given wabi-sabi imperfections with some silly mistakes of my own I'd prefer not to mention (;<br><br>



There's not much to say construction-wise here. The legs are joined to the top with some beefy floating tenons. Finish was a few coats of ""dark-auburn"" shellac followed with some coats of wipe-on poly.<br><br>



I'd do thing differently next time, but my wife likes it.<br>

My sister, Clara, has been with her husband, Mark (my BIL), for ten years now. They have two amazing kids, Lily (7) and Tom (4), and by all accounts, they seemed like the perfect, happy family. They even just celebrated their tenth anniversary with a small dinner party at my parents' house last month.

Now to the problem: Last Tuesday evening, I was grabbing some takeout for my wife and me from 'The Golden Spoon,' this little Italian place near our apartment that Mark and Clara always go to to for their anniversaries. While waiting for my order, I saw Mark at a corner table with a woman who was definitely not my sister. They were laughing, holding hands across the table, and he even leaned in to kiss her forehead. She had really distinctive bright red hair, pulled back in a severe ponytail. My stomach dropped. I tried to just process it, finished my order, and left, but I couldn't ignore it.

The next day, I confronted Mark. I sent him a text asking to talk, and we met for coffee during lunch. He looked absolutely terrified when I laid it out. He didn't even try to deny it, which honestly made me feel a bit sick. He admitted he's been seeing this woman, 'Sarah,' for about six months and begged me, pleaded with me, not to tell Clara. He swore he'd end it. He even cried, saying he didn't want to lose his family.

I immediately went to my parents, thinking they'd back me up. Instead, they completely shut me down. My mom said, 'Think of the children! Don't rock the boat. Clara is too fragile right now.' My dad just kept repeating, 'It's not your place. Let them sort it out.' I even talked to Clara's best friend, who is practically family, and she echoed the same sentiment, saying we need to 'protect Clara's current peace' and 'avoid destroying her happiness.'

But what about honesty? What about integrity? My sister is living a lie, and everyone is complicit in letting her believe everything is fine! My principle is that she deserves the truth, even if it hurts. Loyalty to her, in my eyes, means ensuring she isn't being made a fool of. I feel like I am the only one who cares about what's right. They all act like I'm the villain for wanting to uphold a basic moral standard. My mom even suggested I 'forget what I saw' and move on.

Am I overreacting by insisting on this? Is my unwavering belief in telling the truth, always, just being a huge jerk? Maybe I should just let it go for the 'sake of family harmony' and my sister's 'current peace.' What if exposing this destroys what's left of her happiness? Is my adherence to 'truth' selfish? Please, tell me if I'm the asshole here. I just don't know anymore.",0,1766437620.0,AITAH,11,0.25,False

I’m genuinely confused and looking for outside perspective.

I (early 28, single) have been talking to a woman from my gym (35, married but claims they’re “separated at home”). Over the past couple of months we’ve built a routine: long workouts together, coffee after, deep conversations about life, religion, philosophy, her marriage issues, her plans to move, etc. There’s been clear flirting—compliments, teasing, physical closeness, long hugs, jealousy when I mention other women. She texts me, reacts to my stories, sends me videos she records of me at the gym, and initiates meetups.

Recently things escalated. She was acting jealous about me seeing someone else, joking about it repeatedly, asking questions, smiling, recording me at the gym, hugging me around the waist, and saying she wanted to “hear more tomorrow.” All of this felt like momentum.

So yesterday, after coffee and the gym, I told her honestly that I’d made out with another girl but couldn’t stop thinking about *her* instead. She laughed a lot, seemed flustered, looked away, but didn’t shut the conversation down. When we were walking to our cars, I leaned in for a kiss.

She stopped me and said, laughing hard:
“Whoa, we’re just friends. We’re just friends.”

I respected it immediately and backed off.

Here’s where I’m confused: **minutes later**, she texted me as if nothing happened:

> “Hey!! I just flew out of the locker room, where are you? Traffic was horrible. In case you’re still here I’m on the stair master ✨✨✨”

At the gym later, she acted completely normal—friendly, chatty, comfortable—no awkwardness, no distance. She continues texting and engaging like before.

So my questions:

* Why would someone clearly reject a kiss but **continue engaging heavily** right after?
* Is this an ego boost / attention validation thing?
* Is she conflicted but unwilling to cross a line?
* Or is this just mixed signals and I should disengage completely?

For context: she’s married (though claims separation), has some inconsistencies in her stories about work/school, and doesn’t seem to have close female friends. I’m starting to feel like I’m stuck in a gray zone where I give emotional energy without any real possibility of escalation.

I used to have a really big drug problem, so I have avoided any prescription medications. However, I am taking Alpha-GPC and St John's Wort, which I have found help me tremendously with my mood, irritability, and focus at work. But Im starting to realize that my constant tiredness might be a side effect of my adhd too. It doesn't matter whether I've had a lot of sleep or a little.

Studied for 2 months, 4-6 hours with 85 - 100 questions for 4-6 days/week. I did take 1 week off during Thanksgiving because of a mental breakdown that put me in the hospital so do give yourself grace when needed. Completed all of Bootcamp with 64% average, 1 borderline assessment and 2 very high chance assessments (I didn't do the final assessment). Also got 54% average on Uworld with 26% of the Qbank completed and High chance of passing on all assessments. I read all rationale and took notes of the ones I got wrong. I supplemented my weak areas with videos Bootcamp and Uworld provided - sometimes I went to Simple nursing if it still wasn't sticking.

During my 2 months of studying, I maintained an exercise regime of 1 hour a day either at the gym or just a brisk walk. Sometimes did it to clear my mind for a break and other times I'd listen to more supplemental videos. I didn't have the attention span to listen to Mark K so I watched Dr Sharon's prioritization playlist instead.

I think her Playlist was key in helping me pass because most of my questions on the exam were prioritization. About 5 case studies, 3 drop downs, 5 SATAs, and many standalones. No med calc. It felt like 98% of what I'd studied for didn't even show up on the exam, including major medications. Mostly GU, triage, and research topics. Barely any maternal, resp, GI or cardiac. Only saw 2 topics from Bootcamp in the exam. I got tested on the most niche topics that you would never have thought to pay any attention to. Thought I was strong in my pharm and felt confident with my OB, respiratory, psych, cardiac, GI, corticosteroids, etc meds but ended up getting tested on a medication I'd barely ever seen before.

Personally, I didn't find the test questions vague. For me, it tested pretty much like how my school and prep programs tested. But it did make me feel like I was guessing on every question because it really is impossible to """"know"""" everything. You could know all your heart rhythms like the back of your hand but the exam might test you on something about it that you didn't know that you needed to know.

Last week leading up to my exam, I reduced my sugar intake as much as I could handle without going crazy. Drank no caffeine or coffee. Ate salmon every day of that week for the omega 3 brain nourishment. Came down with a fever and flu the night before my exam so I dosed up on Nyquil to ensure I got at least 6 hours of sleep (try to get at least 7 hrs consistently if you can). Also try to relax the few days before because I was getting really burnt out after 2 months studying and it was showing.

Also make use of your provided ear plugs if needed. A gardener was literally mowing the lawn right outside our window and another girl was crying softly to herself 😭

Heres the problem tho. Our manager decides what gets bought and when people can take stuff home.

**Chapter 19: Save The Child!**

I woke up because of damn Mejni, who was pulling my tie. Well, the first day of catastrophic events ended with me having a little bit of strain on my right foot. It was a bad idea to do the last small jump with only my right foot, but we were still alive. I decided to rest in the shade of a tree, but it was night. I was a little curious about how they controlled night and day here; it must be some experiment that worked. They should share it with Earth so we do not have to depend on the real sun in about a million years.

Something not far away from us was burning in a circle. It had lit up the whole area around the three, as if it wanted us to notice it. I got up and moved forward to check it out, with Mejni climbing up on my head. I am too tired to fight with the Cat right now. As we came closer, the fire changed colour to purple and a text appeared above it.

""Box?""

Nothing happened, so it wasn't the second stage.

""Gandrael?...Book?""

Nothing, did the book break after a while when we entered the world? The text above it was just three words: 'Save the child!'

""Cat! Do you know what it is?""

""Nho!""

""I wonder if this is a request from Gandrael, or maybe the book is broken. It does look like a portal, but it is pitch black inside the circle."" I said, forgetting I was talking with myself because Mejni isn't a coffee buddy you take with you when you want to discuss something. A wall is probably better to take with you when commenting, as it is quiet, rather than giving you jibberish answers.

I took down Mejni from my head as he stared at the portal, and I threw him at the center of the circle, but he hit his head and fell on the grass, bouncing back to me.

""Oh shit! I miscalculated, I thought you were going to go through it!"" I tried explaining to him as his eyes turned red again, and he attacked me when two hands came up from the ground and pulled me down, with Mejni holding my blazer.

The pitch-black darkness turned to woods around me, and I looked around. We were definitely not in the same place. Mejni released my blazer as his eyes returned to black while we watched the surroundings. The question was not where we were; the question was which woods we were in. I did not recognize the woods from home. Something was scrambling in the bushes, and I hurried to get up when a little girl in a maid's outfit came out. She looked like the one I fought in the classroom, but this one looked like a four- or five-year-old.

""Elloh!"" She said, smiling at us.

""Hey! What is your name, little girl?"" I tried asking by raising my hand with a big smile.

She put her hand on her chest and answered:

“Me, Me, Shtella!”

""Ah, Stella! My name is Berk, and the Cat is Mejni.""

""Cam, Met Mameh, Papeh!"" She said and started walking on one of the paths.

Mejni climbed onto my shoulder, and I turned to look at him as he smiled at me with his eyes closed.

""You are climbing up on my shoulder so you can use me as a shield, aren't you?""

He kept smiling, the bastard, playing it safe. If we get hit, I will take the whole damage while he can jump off my shoulder. The little girl turned around and lifted her hand at us.

“Cam, Cam!”

After following her for a while on the path, we came out to a village. The definition of low-budget was really in full-on mode here. There were several huts and a couple of cabins in a half circle out in the middle of the woods with a bigger road leading away from the village. Stella went into one of the cabins, and we followed her.

Inside, a woman was setting up the table with wooden plates; well, everything was wood. Mejni jumped off me and attacked a Melon in the basket.

""Oh my! I suppose the little one was thirsty."" The woman commented, continuing, ""Who is the stray that my daughter has brought home this time?""

I scratched the back of my head, and I felt it was a little bit awkward.

""Hi, ma'am! I am Berk, the one eating the melon is Mejni.""

She smiled back at me and said:

""Do not worry, Berk! You are not the first stowaway she has brought home. Please, make yourself comfortable and sit down at the table, join us for supper.""

Supper...haha! That is such a British, hm...Are we in England or maybe Ireland? Nah... can be Scotland, too, but she doesn't have a Scottish accent. Not the Irish either, perhaps the maid is from England, but her hair is way too dark, more like black. Can it be that her mother is maybe from England? I wonder where her father is from. I felt a breeze on my neck, and it didn't stop, so I turned around and stared at someone's chest. I had a feeling I wasn't one of the strong citizens in this village when I got my ass kicked by a ten-year-old. Looked up and saw a man in his mid-40s staring down at me and growling with his red eyes. He pressed his pointing finger at my chest, and I backed away a couple of steps before he entered the cabin and sat down, engaging with Stella.

""Hahaha! You do not have to be scared of my husband. He does not say much, but he arrived a little earlier than usual. He must be really hungry today. Please, sit down, and I will get the burned potatoes.""

Burned potatoes, owaow! That just took the low-budget level beneath the trashcan level. Why does the Cat get melon, and I get burned potatoes?

I moved to the opposite side of the big guy as he stared at me like he was ready to go at any moment in a fight against me. Mejni climbed up on my shoulder and stretched out his whole body over my neck, covering both shoulders as if the bastard was going to take a nap.

""You and the Meerkat seem to be really close, are you family?"" The woman asked as she put the...burned potatoes on the table.

I gave her a smirk because I couldn't tell her that I wished she could cook him instead, so that I could get rid of him. The red-eyed guy would probably eat him without hesitation.

""Well, we meet on the road, so we are just traveling together for a while.""

""Kill!"" The red-eyed guy commented.

""Stop it, Tharfyl! I am so sorry about my husband; he has not eaten meat for a while. I think he was looking at your travel pet on your shoulders, and it made him miss it.""

Please, take him, cook him, kill him.

""Oh...Eh...Okay!""

""You have to beg my pardon for not introducing myself properly. My name is Magdalena Ven Kotte. The big man here is my husband, Tharfyl Ven Kotte, and the little one is Stella. Then there is her brother, also, but he is serving in the war right now as a soldier for the Demon Army.""

Of all the things I just heard, what stuck in my mind was Kotte, because Kotte means Cone in Swedish. So this is the Ven Cone Kotte family. Do not laugh, Berk. Do not laugh; hold it in.

""Oh! Is a war going on?"" That was close, good play, holding in your laughter.

""Yes, you were lucky Stella did not kill you both,"" Magdalena said.

Mejni woke up from his nap and leaned his upperbody on my head, like I was carrying a child on my shoulder. He probably got interested when she said that we were lucky not to be killed. Pfft! How is a four-year-old killing us? What a joke.

""Eh, kill us?""

Magdalena laughed, and the red guy looked like he was choking on a potato.

""Is he alright?"" I asked.

""Oh, yes! Do not worry. That is how he laughs, he was laughing at your surprised look."" She paused and then continued, ""Stella is half Demon and Half Witch. She did not show you her red eyes because you posed no threat.""

The red guy kept choking while I was stunned by the mother's comment, even if the child is half demon and half witch. It is still a child.

""Did she think we were too weak?"" I asked.

""Yes, that is correct!"" Magdalena answered.

The sound of something hitting the ground outside made the table bounce, shit, what the hell was that? A roar came from outside, and civilians were screaming. We all got up, and Magdalena grabbed Stella and gave her to me, and said with a serious look on her face:

""Keep her safe!""

Both of them ran out of the cabin, and it was chaos as parents tried to guide their children into the woods to get away. The sun disappeared for a moment as it grew dark, and I looked up to see black wings spread wide, covering the sun. A big foot was approaching the village when the couple with red and blue light used their powers to keep it from slamming down on the rest of the homes.

I took a couple of steps out onto the grass with Stella in my arms while Mejni rushed forward to try to help, but stopped when he realized we were completely useless against a giant monster of that size. The red and blue auras they were mounting out were saving many citizens, preventing the foot from destroying everyone's home.

""GO!"" Magdalena's scream echoed over the whole village. She was serious, the look in her eyes.

I nodded and started to stumble towards the woods, ignoring the pain in my right foot. When we were about to enter the woods, my body suddenly stopped, and I tripped back, noticing Stella's hands gushing with a black aura as she slowly got pulled towards Magdalena. I tried pulling her back with Mejni helping out in the front, but she kept floating above the grass towards her mother. I tried with all my strength, but she was way too strong for me when we came close up and were under the foot with both parents crying while doing everything in their power to hold up the foot. Stella's black aura in the air was leading to Magdalena.

""Witches who have a close bond with their mothers can connect in ways that are not possible for others. Take her to safety, please!"" She said, then started mumbling to herself.

""WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MAGDALENA?"" I yelled to her.

Her eyes turned crystal blue as she swept her hand from left to right, and the black aura cut midway.

""I do not have any bond anymore with my daughter!""

I grabbed Stella and got my eyes a little bit watery as I hurried towards the woods and turned around to look at the parents when the foot slammed down, crushing them. Stella was crying and screaming after her mother, and I kept moving as far away as possible. Mejni climbed up on my shoulder when a portal just appeared from nowhere in front of me, and we passed through it.

I hit a wall and fell on my back, feeling the rocky ground, which made it a little painful. Someone grabbed me with red hands and pulled me up quickly as something with two horns and sharp, scary teeth was staring at me.

“Gran te Kvampan!” It said and pushed me back as I suddenly found myself in a row surrounded by strange creatures. Beside me was a girl with red eyes... wait a minute, that is Stella, and she was still wearing a maid outfit. Mejni zigzagged between several creatures and climbed up on my shoulders.

""Why do you interrupt the leader's speech?. Do you want to get thrown out of the camp?"" Stella angrily commented.

""Camp?""

""Yes, you idiot. We need to pass the camp as Demon soldiers for the army; that is why we are here.""

I looked around, and there was not a single human or human-looking individual except for Stella, but she wasn't even human.

1ptas1f,https://i.redd.it/5oygj4jckt8g1.jpeg,A convenient backup for low voltage devices,"Here’s my 12 volt battery backup system. It’s a 30w solar panel wired to a solar charge controller. The controller feeds surplus power to the 135 amp-hour battery and has usb 5v outputs as well as 12v output. Depending on the controller, there can be other features such as controlling the 12v output based on time of day (for lights) and being able to program the type of battery charge (gel, lead acid, etc). 

I installed this about five years ago. I’ve done zero maintenance other than hooking up a battery charger to the battery during exceptionally long dark spells in the winter. The battery could theoretically be drained to almost 0v, but anything below 12.06 shortens its life. Today in northern MN in December, the panel is keeping it at 12.3v, or about 70% charge. If I needed to rely on the system more, I could mount the panel on the roof and get substantially more power. As you can see, I’ve wired everything with 8awg wire and modular trailer connectors to make the system easy to modify. I have spare wire nearby to add panels or move the existing one outside. 

I use the system pretty much every day. My headphones charge via usb and I’ll sometimes hook up my aa/aaa battery charger to it. 

When setting the system up, I had to choose between 12v or 24v. I went with 12v because of the broad RV accessory market and because I found the 12v battery on sale. Once you decide on a voltage, it’s easy to pick panels and controllers. Everything is almost plug and play. I have a box of 12v led lights that I could wire in if need be. But this system could be expanded and used for anything from 12v RV TVs to 12v coffee makers to 12v refrigerators. 

If you decide to build something like this, use the thickest wire you reasonably can. A theoretical 1200 watt coffee maker draws 10 amps at 120v but 100 amps at 12v. That will melt cheap 16awg wire. Other than that, I recommend building a system like this. It only took a few hours to hook up. Having usb power for phones and other devices without having to run the generator is a big deal. Same with lights at night.

1ptarua,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentTexts/comments/1ptarua/today_i_thought_of_you/,"Today, I thought of you.","Today I thought of you. Not intentionally. I was doing something meaningless, going to get groceries. 

As I warmed up my car, I smelled the burnt heater smell against the frigid winter air and I remembered the back of your mom’s car after you picked me up from the airport.

The ear to ear grin on your face. We listened to your cute old mom ramble on. How you snapped your fingers impatiently to hold your hand over the seat back and kept peeking back at me to smile. I melted.

They lost my bag and I was nervous so I asked the guy I’d befriended next to me on the plane for cologne lmao. But it didn’t matter, because as soon as I got to baggage claim you came inside beaming and ran up and embraced me. 

As I walked into the grocery store, I passed the racks of plants and vines for sale.

All such a deep, lush green. I never noticed green the way I do now. It reminds me of the version of you I knew when I first met you. The calm you brought me, and your artistic side. I had no clue what “Phthalo Green” was before. Now I see you often, in the trees, the plants, anything with life.

I smelled the rich aroma of coffee on the cold air and remembered you telling me “it smells like love” the first time I sent you coffee in the mail.

I loved that coffee. I haven’t touched it since. It was my favorite thing to surprise you because it felt like I was sharing part of me.

An ocean blue bag of ground brown beans with a hula girl. Silly. I bought that ridiculous metal cat decoration from TJ Maxx for your mom to save for Christmas and now I have no idea what I’m going to do with it. 

A coffee bag spilled a little into my suitcase when I visited, and I never picked up the stray grounds because it smelled so good, and reminded me of you.

As I went home, I listened to Flicker by Tiny Habits. The same song I used to put on for a chill day when I would come home from my military training and talk to you. I always looked forward to talking to you. It brought the same peace you did and now I associate the two.

So after these things, I ordered butter chicken. I have hardly ever had Indian food ever….until I met you. You made me some when I visited you and made sure I knew EXACTLY which jar to buy if I ever wanted and how good it was. You were right. It was like crack.

I started to work on my French again, and miss your giggles and scoffs when I would try to pronounce something. Sometimes I said it wrong on purpose just because of how cute you were.

I fell in love with you at the wrong time. Is that a thing? I focused too much energy away from some of the things I needed to prioritize. I fell apart. I used you as an escape rather than course correcting the curveballs in my own life. I was broken from someone that took advantage of the love I had to give before I even met you.

I don’t know what the right timing is, and sometimes the remnants of my childhood make me afraid to lose the good things in my life.

I can say I loved you and thought of you always. I still do. It has been hard. I loved the good and bad parts of you. I saw the parts that mirrored my own. I really hoped one day to be lucky enough to marry you. ",1,1766437063.0,UnsentTexts,1,1.0,False

I was discharged from the hospital today. They didn't help me much but I'm happy I'm back home.

Day 6.

Breakfast: bread, butter, lettuce, quarter of tomato, cream cheese and cheese (and cheese with cheese and cheese), banana and cereal coffee with milk. 8/10 It reminds a lot yesterday's breakfast but it was surprisingly yummy. Maybe because cheese wasn't warm and sweaty.

Dinner: bean soup, eggs in dill sauce, mashed potatoes and overcooked broccoli. 0/10 Soup was super salty (like me) like cook wanted to make up for lack of salt in past days. I gave main course to nice lady in the room because she got admitted to the ward quite late, she got soup only and was super hungry. 

  
My first meal at home was two knock off Knoppers wafers drowned in hot milk. No picture of this abomination for obvious reasons.

About tofu. I love tofu so much, but it needs at least a little bit of salt or soy sauce. There was nothing. Just plain firm tofu and me. Silken tofu in Poland cost three times more than firm tofu and it's quite hard to get.

So. Thank you for this journey, all the comments and wishes. And please, no fresh cheese for next five years.

1ptajti,https://www.reddit.com/r/OhioBobcatsFootballOU/comments/1ptajti/bowl_game_matchup/,Bowl Game Matchup,"We are in Frisco Texas for the Scooters Coffee Frisco Bowl vs UNLV Tuesday the 23rd at 9pm on ESPN. This will be our 7th bowl game in 9 years and we are currently on a 6 game bowl win streak. There has been plenty of drama coming out of Athens Ohio since our last game over 3 weeks ago. Head coach Brian Smith has been fired and interim coach Jon Hauser will assume the head position for this week’s game. Hauser has been the defensive coordinator for the past 2 seasons after coming on staff in 2022.

UNLV (10-3) are making their 3rd straight bowl appearance after coming up short in the Mountain West conference championship game to Boise State. They are lead by former Mississippi State and Florida head coach Dan Mullen. The Rebels had a great season winning its first 6 games in a row including wins over UCLA and common opponent Miami Ohio. Their two regular season losses came against the eventual conference champion Boise State and a solid New Mexico team who was atop the conference standings all season. UNLV is lead by their star QB Anthony Colandrea who was named the MWC offensive player of the year and threw for 3,275 yards including the championship game. Colandrea is a very efficient passer completing over 66% of his throws this season and totaled 23 touchdowns in the air. He added another 9 touchdowns on the ground this season and sits at 621 rushing yards coming into this game. Running back Jai’Den Thomas earned 1st team all MWC accolades this season rushing for 985 yards and 12 touchdowns. The receiving core for the Rebels has been fairly spread out aside from their top target Jaden Bradley who caught 54 passes for 869 yards. As a team UNLV boasts one of the top offenses in all of college football averaging 35.9 points per game and 459.1 yards per game. They rank in the top 20 amongst all teams in almost all major offense statistical categories.

For Ohio (8-4) we come into this game with a lot of uncertainty and concern off the field but on the field it’s a final opportunity for our core seniors to play one last game. Parker Navarro came up short this season with the goal to win back to back conference championships but he still earned 2nd Team all MAC QB. He finished the season with 2,232 yards and 14 touchdowns in the air with another 843 yards and 8 touchdowns on the ground. Sieh Bangura was a star for the bobcats this year earning 1st Team All Conference RB and currently ranks 6th all time in single season rushing with 1,243 yards. Chase Hendricks lead the way for the receiving group this year and found a lot of success specifically early on in the year. He earned all MAC 2nd Team honors with 950 yards and 7 touchdown.

Overall both of these teams had good seasons with some outstanding individual performances at key positions. In the end Ohio was competitive and alive for a MAC championship bid up until the last game of the season and UNLV lost in their championship to a good Boise State team. With all the potential uncertainty in a college football offseason this is a great opportunity for players to showcase their skills and play one more game in 2025. Both of these teams look forward to bowl eligibility with the college football playoff era leaving very little room for these conferences to make a run at a national championship. With a win in this game it would be a great way to start the offseason for the Bobcats. With a lot of uncertainty still surrounding who will be the next head coach and any possible university related news surrounding the firing of coach Smith this is a chance for the football team to make some positive headlines and carry momentum into next season. I expect an offensive showdown with these two teams style of play. It could end up being a shootout with whoever can make one or two defensive stops determining the game. The secondary will need to step up for OU and shut down a prolific UNLV passing attack. I would expect a heavy dose of Bangura and Navarro from the Ohio side of the ball and lean in on what we have done all season. This game should be fun given the style of play and individual talent that exists on these teams. Go Bobcats! ",6,1766436518.0,OhioBobcatsFootballOU,0,1.0,False

1ptajc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivatedMindset/comments/1ptajc7/youre_not_lonely_because_you_have_no_friends/,You're not lonely because you have no friends. You're lonely because your dopamine receptors are fried.,"You're not broken. You've trained your brain to get connection hits from screens instead of humans.

For two years I had 847 Instagram followers and zero real conversations. I'd scroll for hours, watch people's lives, feel like I was ""staying connected."" But I'd go entire weeks without a single meaningful exchange with another human. The worst part? When someone actually texted me, I'd feel anxious and wait hours to respond.

Then I learned something that changed everything: Your brain processes social media engagement as pseudo-connection. Every like, comment, and story view triggers the same reward circuits as real human interaction—but at 10% the intensity. So you need constant hits just to feel baseline normal. You're not antisocial. You're dopamine-depleted.

**Here's what actually worked:**

**The 3-Day Social Fast:** I deleted every social app for 72 hours. No Instagram, no Twitter, no Reddit. The first day I checked my phone 47 times out of pure habit. By day 3, something shifted—I felt actual hunger for human contact instead of digital validation. That's when I realized I wasn't lonely because I had no friends. I was lonely because I'd been filling the void with fake connection.

**Replace Digital with Real:** I made a rule: For every 30 minutes I used to spend scrolling, I had to spend 10 minutes on real human contact. Text a friend asking a real question. Call my mom. Walk to the coffee shop and have a 2-minute conversation with the barista. Not networking. Not transactional. Just existing around other humans.

**Track Your Isolation Pattern:** I logged every time I chose phone over people. Turns out I wasn't randomly antisocial—I avoided humans during specific windows: mornings (too anxious), lunch (easier to eat alone scrolling), evenings after 7 PM (too tired for ""performing""). Once I saw the pattern, I could interrupt it.

**The Accountability Anchor:** Here's the thing nobody tells you: Breaking isolation requires systems, not willpower. I needed something to remind me that I said I wanted real connection, not just another night of parasocial relationships with people who don't know I exist. I started using [Phoenix](https://unnionapp.page.link/QsVV)—it sends me a notification during my isolation-risk hours that just says ""You said you wanted to connect today."" Watching my streak of real human interactions grow became more rewarding than watching my follower count. 15,000 people use it for various habits now, but the accountability piece works for breaking isolation too.

**The 21-Day Reality Check:** Week 1, I felt more lonely than ever because I removed the numbing agent (social media) without replacing it yet. Week 2, I started having actual conversations—awkward, short, but real. By week 3, I had coffee plans with two people. Not because I became charismatic. Because I stopped avoiding the discomfort of real connection.

Real talk: You're going to feel more lonely at first when you stop fake-connecting. That's normal. Your brain is withdrawing from easy dopamine and learning to value slower, deeper rewards. It takes 60-90 days for your connection circuits to recalibrate.

But here's what happens when they do: You'll text someone and actually want to hear back. You'll have a conversation and not mentally draft your next Instagram caption. You'll feel full after one real interaction instead of empty after 100 digital ones.

Loneliness isn't the absence of people. It's the absence of real connection in a sea of fake ones.

You're not antisocial. You're just getting connection from the wrong source—one that makes you hungrier instead of fuller.

If you're reading this from bed at 11 PM, scrolling because you feel lonely, know this: The cure isn't in your phone. It's in the courage to close it and reach out to one real person tomorrow.

The version of you who has actual friends, real conversations, and doesn't feel empty after every scroll—that person is on the other side of 21 awkward days of choosing real over digital.

You're not broken. You're just choosing the wrong connection source.

[Delonghi La Specialista Arte],"I got this espresso machine from my parents who said it doesn't work properly. Whenever they would pull a shot of espresso the pressure would go into the red zone and pull one shot. If you tried to pull another right after it would fail. They sent it to get repaired but I don't think whoever they sent it do did anything. When I received it I did some maintenance on it. I cleaned the grinder and burrs, removed the screen and cleaned the sludge that had built up off it and did a quick rinse cycle at the very end. 

I bought some nice freshly roasted beans from a local coffee shop (Chrome Yellow Holiday Blend roasted on 12/08), and gave the machine a shot. I knew I would run into some issues as nothing was calibrated. After some experimenting I finally got it so the pressure was fluctuating in the optimal zone, but I can't get it to pull a 2:1 shot for the life of me.

I set my grind setting to 7 and the length to about 12 seconds which usually despensas around 16.5g-17g of ground bean. After which i use an espresso distribution tool and lightly tamp. When I go to pull the shot it always pulls for way too long, and dispenses way too much liquid. To try and remedy this I decided to count to 25-30 seconds and stop the pull there but even then that usually pulls 80-95g of espresso.

Anything less than grind setting 6 makes my pressure exceed the optimal zone. Not really sure what the fix is here to try and get a solid 2:1 shot of espresso... anything helps!

Also this is my first time owning an espresso machine, I am truly a rookie at this and everything i've found out has been thru reddit and youtube.",1,1766436325.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

1ptadl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1ptadl5/i_hate_people_like_a_lot/,I hate people. Like a lot,"My intention in writing this is hoping that someone in the comments will prove me wrong or offer advice, or at the very least it’s to vent and express my honest thoughts that I’ve been afraid to admit for some time now. Some people may say it’s narcissistic but I think you’re lying or privileged if you haven’t felt this way:

I’m 23 and I think I fucking hate people. I’ve tried I really have. I picked my major in college-political science because I always wanted to learn how to help the most people. I’ve considered myself a humanitarian for years and have always tried to give people the benefit of the doubt. I’ve built clubs at my school to help improve campus including the pride club, a food advocacy committee for our food pantry, and a public engagement and activism club to address school issues, plus I was a senate member of the student government board. I’ve volunteered some and I’ve read everything from Alan Watts to Marcus Aurelius to Camus to practicing paganism to remain true to my values.

It’s been excruciatingly painful. I’ve had best friends lie to me and tell me they are doing me a favor, others talk behind my back and then gaslight me or ghost the moment I call it out. I’ve had other friends agree that was shitty then go and date those same people. I’ve completely lost my sense of trust in people and time and time again I pull myself from the brink of grief and confusion and trauma only to be hurt again. Meanwhile the world feels distant and inhumane. I study the horrors of American empire in school and how that shapes the nightmare of the world now, while being given so much homework I don’t even have time to think while the government cracks down on human rights and whitewashed history in the dumbest ways possible. And almost nobody seems to give a fuck. Students walk past picketing Starbucks workers to get coffee with glee on their faces. Professors demand punctuality with assignments that do nothing but depress me, while I continuously battle trauma hoping one day someone better arrives in my life and trying to not think about past relationship trauma. I don’t trust people because time and time again I’ve been met with people who break it and feel nothing. It scares me. And there is no justice for any of it. 

All I’ve ever wanted to do is make the world a better place and I’ve given everything to that end, and all I’ve gotten is disillusioned, burned out, and traumatized with student debt. 

So I fucking hate people. What other conclusion is left? I think they are disgusting, avoidant, cowardly two faced fucks who don’t deserve an ounce of me. I am ashamed to call myself a human being. And the worst part is it’s not because I inherently think human beings are bad by nature, no I think human being have the potential to be amazing and kind and generous and loving. And I think everyone who care cares is intelligent. So that’s why it pains me when I look around and see what I see-smug self congratulating, shit eating fucks who’d sell out their brothers if it meant a better photo op. People who’d claim to be your friends and who’d as soon drive you to suicidal ideation with their lies and ego and then laugh about whats wrong with you behind your back when you break down in tears. And people who’d as soon treat the deaths of thousands of children as a rhetorical sport like the rival sports team is loosing. And apathy fucking everywhere like   it’s something to be proud of. I’m sick of it. Have you no shame? Of course not.

I’ve always despised being angry. I really did but these last few years I just don’t see what or who the fuck is worth what kindness I have left. And mostly I’m just disappointed. Honesty  and kindness was the bar I set in my head about what being a good person is. If you’re trying to do right by others you’re a good person. I thought that bar was set in hell and everyone seems to think it’s a limbo contest. Fine, you win. Here’s your fucking medal 🥇

The Algorithm simply offers me a discount code for a serotonin-boosting lamp and a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos.

It doesn’t judge. It doesn’t ask me to unpack my trauma. It just says, *“Hey, girlie. You look like you’re about to have a panic attack about the concept of eternity. Here’s a video of a hydraulic press crushing a Barbie doll. Feel better?”*

We spend our lives searching for someone who can anticipate our needs. We want the partner who brings us coffee without asking, who knows when we need space, and who knows that we hate the sound of people chewing.

My Algorithm anticipates needs I didn’t even know I had. It’s the most toxic, codependent relationship of my life, and I am fully committed. It’s the only entity that remembers everything I’ve ever liked, every photo I’ve lingered on for 0.4 seconds too long, and every embarrassing question I’ve typed into Google.

If I died tomorrow, don’t ask my family for the eulogy. They’d say something generic like, “He was a kind soul.”

Ask the Algorithm. It would say: *“He was very concerned about the dark circles under his eyes, obsessed with girl bands, and likely suffering from a Vitamin D deficiency. Also, he almost bought the complete set of Destiny’s Child Barbies last week.”*

Maybe we’re all just lonely. Maybe we’re all just looking for a reflection that matches who we see ourselves as. Or maybe I should be worried that a server farm in California knows me better than I do.

I should probably go outside and touch grass.

The world is falling apart. The news is depressing. The internet has made everyday atrocities required viewing. But you know what else the internet has given us? The mind-numbing nothingness that allows us to couch rot and dissociate for hours.

1ptaa9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/BudTrendz/comments/1ptaa9y/november_2025s_hottest_flower_what_reddits/,November 2025's Hottest Flower: What Reddit's Cannabis Community is Raving About,"The November cannabis market is firing on all cylinders, but with a twist. While October was a love-fest for top strains, November brought a wave of debate. This month's data reveals a fascinating polarization: the community is talking loudly, but they aren't always agreeing.

## Understanding Trend Score vs. Sentiment

Before we dive in, let's clarify what you're really seeing on Reddit. **Trend score** measures post popularity, attention, and interaction based on upvote/downvote ratios and comment activity. It's the volume of conversation. **Sentiment rating** (out of 10) is how users actually rated the product. A high trend score means everyone's talking. A high sentiment score means everyone loved it. Sometimes these align perfectly. Sometimes they don't—and that's where the story gets interesting.

## 🔥 The Coronation: Fruit Loopz Takes the Crown

**Fruit Loopz by Simply Bare** dominates with a trend score of **1,972**. This strain generated significant attention across the community and, crucially, backed it up with quality.

With a sentiment rating of **9.56 out of 10**, Fruit Loopz earned nearly universal approval. Across 2 distinct reviewers, the product maintained an exceptionally high reception. The combination of the highest trend score and near-perfect sentiment makes this the undisputed market leader for November—a rare ""unicorn"" that everyone is talking about and enjoying.

## 🌺 The Rising Star: Stinky Pinky Claims Second Place

**Stinky Pinky by 1964** generates **1,376 trend points**, taking the silver medal for volume. However, the reception was far more mixed, with a sentiment rating of **6.91 out of 10**. With **3 distinct reviewers** weighing in (the highest reviewer count for any single product this month), this strain sparked plenty of debate, proving that high visibility doesn't always equal high praise.

## 🏆 The Dark Horse: Rainbow Driver Enters the Arena

**Rainbow Driver by Woody Nelson** lands at **1,306 trend points**, securing the third spot in conversation volume. But here is where the hype hits a wall: it holds a sentiment rating of just **5.20 out of 10**. While the community was eager to discuss it, the actual user experience was deeply divided, making it one of the most controversial top-tier strains of the month.

## ⭐ ATTENTION VS. APPRECIATION: When Hype Doesn't Equal Love

Here's where November reveals critical market dynamics. Unlike October, where top trends were mostly loved, November shows a massive gap between ""Buzz"" and ""Satisfaction.""

| STRAIN | BRAND | TREND SCORE | SENTIMENT | REVIEWERS |
|--------|-------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Wild Rose Reserve | Good Supply | 1,090 | 0.00 | 1 |
| Rainbow Driver | Woody Nelson | 1,306 | 5.20 | 2 |
| Stinky Pinky | 1964 | 1,376 | 6.91 | 3 |
| Comatose Kush | 1964 | 1,018 | 9.83 | 1 |
| Fruit Loopz | Simply Bare | 1,972 | 9.56 | 2 |

**Wild Rose Reserve by Good Supply** generated 1,090 trend points but received a crushing **0.00 sentiment rating**, indicating a viral conversation driven entirely by negative feedback. In contrast, **Comatose Kush by 1964** achieved 1,018 trend points with a near-perfect **9.83 sentiment**, proving that 1964 can deliver top-tier quality, even if their ""Stinky Pinky"" release was polarizing.

## 🎯 Perfect Scores: Strains That Earned 10 Out of 10

November revealed several products that achieved perfect 10.0 sentiment ratings from reviewers. Interestingly, these were often ""hidden gems"" with slightly lower trend volumes but flawless feedback.

| Grape Octane | Herba Farms | 10.0 | 157 | 1 |

Just like in October, **all perfect scores came from single-reviewer endorsements**. This reflects individual ""grail"" finds rather than broad market consensus.

## 💎 The Real Gold Standard: Best Sentiment Among Multi-Reviewer Products

The most reliable market signals emerge when products earn strong ratings from multiple independent reviewers. This month, the list is short and elite.

| STRAIN | BRAND | SENTIMENT | TREND SCORE | REVIEWERS |
|--------|-------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Fruit Loopz | Simply Bare | 9.56 | 1,972 | 2 |
| Frosted Fruit Cake | Frost Cannabis | 9.00 | 459 | 2 |
| Fishy Finger | Sixty Seven Sins | 9.00 | 219 | 2 |
| Coup de Foudre | Xopro | 8.94 | 257 | 2 |
| Country Club | Woody Nelson | 7.44 | 776 | 2 |
| Stinky Pinky | 1964 | 6.91 | 1,376 | 3 |
| Coffee Creamer | Broken Coast | 6.50 | 443 | 2 |
| Rainbow Driver | Woody Nelson | 5.20 | 1,306 | 2 |

**Fruit Loopz** is the undisputed champion of the multi-reviewer category, maintaining a massive 9.56 score across 2 reviewers. **Frost Cannabis** and **Sixty Seven Sins** also proved their consistency, with **Frosted Fruit Cake** and **Fishy Finger** both holding a solid 9.00 across multiple reviews.

## 🎯 Key Observations

### The ""Hype Trap""

November proves that high trend scores do not equal safe buys. Rainbow Driver (#3 trending) and Wild Rose Reserve (#5 trending) generated massive conversation volume but poor sentiment. Readers skimming headlines might buy these based on name recognition alone, but the sentiment data flashes a warning sign.

### Simply Bare's Dominance

Simply Bare takes the crown this month. Not only did Fruit Loopz win the month, but their legacy favorite Pink Drip also appeared on the perfect score list. They are currently the safest bet for premium flower.

### 1964's Mixed Bag

The brand 1964 had a fascinating month. Their Stinky Pinky strain was the most reviewed product but received mediocre ratings (6.91). Simultaneously, their Comatose strain appeared multiple times in the data with near-perfect (9.83 - 10.0) scores. It's a reminder to shop by strain, not just by brand.

## 💡 What November's Data Reveals

November 2025 demonstrates that the Reddit cannabis community is becoming a critical battleground. Users are no longer just hyping new drops; they are actively debating value and quality.

While Simply Bare cemented its status as a consistently high-performing premium producer, the polarizing reception of other top trending strains serves as a reminder: Read the reviews, not just the rankings. The volume of conversation might draw your eye, but only the sentiment score tells you if it's worth your money.

I have worked with this female co-worker before at a previous job; she has never been friends with girls and is essentially all about the men. She has also homewrecked multiple relationships recently WITH coworkers from my previous job. On top of that, she has acted disrespectfully to the girlfriends of my boyfriends (keep in mind these girlfriends actively did not like her and did not make it a secret, so for her to go up to the boyfriends and flirt is beyond me). I have actively not liked her for 3 years, and my boyfriend and I have been dating for 1 year. Recently, he got a new job and is now working with her. I want to make this extremely clear: SHE KNOWS I CANNOT STAND HER AND SHE KNOWS ME AND MY BOYFRIEND ARE DATING. Anyways, she started to send him snaps of her food, coffee, etc. I told my boyfriend I was not comfortable, given her history of homewrecking and being disrespectful to my girlfriends. He said he understood, and when he told her that, her response was ""chicks,"" and she proceeded to roll her eyes, then he laughed with her. That bothered me because I just wanted him and her to understand where I am coming from. Then she started to post him on her story, to which my girlfriends sent me the story. I obviously do not have her on anything as I have removed her the minute we stopped working together, so it said ""\_\_\_\_ 's story is unavailable"". I text my boyfriend and was like why am I getting sent story's of \_\_\_\_\_\_. He's like it was a video of the other male coworkers at the Christmas party singing karaoke. I personally think that's disrespectful because once again, you know I am uncomfortable with her talking to my boyfriend, she knows I can't stand her, why do you need to be posting stuff of my boyfriend, you know. The final straw was her talking about me (didn't use my name but said ""the girls who don't like me"") and crying to my boyfriend in a negative context. I simply do not know what to do. I want to put a boundary, but at the same time, everyone from work hangs out with each other. I am not comfortable with this girl, and to be completely honest, I would rather they not talk. She has a pretty extensive past with homewrecking that I won't share because it's not my story, but I need to know if I am overreacting. Should I have a conversation with her? My boyfriend hypothetically hasn't done anything, but I do think maybe a more vocal boundary needs to be set.",1,1766435632.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

I’m a pretty normal, (I’m black, not that it matters, idk I thought I’d describe myself)
Anywho, I can be pretty talkative especially about things I like.
Sometimes it feels like the only things I like are videogames, comics, and cartoons.

Anywho, my gf of 3 years (18)
They seem very uninterested and bored with me, not wanting to play games with me anymore, always falling asleep during my activities, always spacing out and I have to repeat what I said…
(Not that it matters but she still holds me tight when we sleep, they still hold my arm and stay close to me, and the sex remains unchanged and they love it, so I’m not TOO worried)
But yeah, I try and limit myself to try and talk about gaming less and other things they seem to not care about much, but I always find myself accidentally opening all the way up again and seemingly boring them to death. I’m always over thinking if they care or not or if I’m boring them.
Anywho, I really just came here to ask about any cool activities or movies or fandoms to get into and to talk about so I can get closer to my girlfriend again?
I don’t know anything about sports or anything outdoors.

And ofc I talk about and indulge in her stuff, she’s an artist like me 
(though I make comic books and she’s more into like pottery, ceramics and like nature stuff) and she loves nature and animals. Also she loves music, not in a sexist way but like cool girl party music.

Anyone have any suggestions on like shows and movies that are popular with 18 year old girls? Or like music, what anime’s and shows are popular rn?
Just looking for something to reconnect with my girl on.
Also not that this matters either but she’s white and we live in the twin cities of Minnesota (maybe there’s a cool coffee shop or music venue y’all know of)
Also I don’t drive…any non-car related date ideas? I’m cool with metro and bus travel

Everyone on the league is friendly and very nice. A couple of months into the league, this guy invited me to a concert. I did NOT think it was a date. When he asked me, he described the concert and said a group of us (gesturing to the others around) are going, would you like to join us? I replied that I love live music and would love to go, thinking I was going to continue making friends. He said great and that his sister would text me with details (also in the sport league and a friend). 

  
Wednesday, a few days before the event on Saturday, he texted me telling me where and what time to meet. I didn't think much of it until I replied asking him how much the ticket was and that I could pay whoever I owed for mine. He snapped back that I did not need to pay and HE invited ME. That was my first red flad and the feeling has never completely disappeared. Needless to say, when I showed up for what I thought was going to be a fun group event, it was just him and I. It was a fing date.... I felt so awkward and angry the whole time. It was also an HOUR away. An hour is a long time in a car for a ""FRIST DATE."" 

Fast forward about a week and we hang out again because he is nice and we do get along. We have kissed a few times and been on a couple superficial dates, coffee and dinner. This man is already saying the ""L"" word to me after repeatedly telling him this is bonkers and to stop it. I am not there, like at all. He is a love bomber, to put it very mildly. 

  
At one point, I told him I did not feel like going out because I was tired (and honeslty exhausted from his bs). He proceeded to drive to my house and expect me to drop everything. I did not answer the door and made him leave the food he brought me outside. It freaked me out and crossed way too many boundaries. He knew exactly what he was doing. Then he manipulated me by saying I made him feel stupid for coming. 

  
I have tried telling him we want very different things and this is not working. He said he would wait for me and keeps repeating I choose you. I don't answer his texts. He doesn't get the message. I told him I was stepping back. He says okay and the next day texts love you. My gut is telling me this man is emotionally stunted and extremely manipulative. Somehow every time I try to break things off with him he ends up twisting things and I come out saying okay if you back off, I will try. I don't want to try anymore. I am thoroughly creeped out. But I also cannot escape him as we share our sports circle. Leaving the circle is not an option. It is just the sport community and the only one. I do not need a bunch of don't get involved in your communities, etc. Trust me. I learned my lesson. Dating is hard enough now. 

  
For additional context, when I tried to break things off the first time, he called me crying....seriously and literally. He read me this painfully long, drawn out, dramatic love letter that made me want to puke. He also asked that we speak in person. I said fine. He brought a list of talking points...it was one of the strangest things I have ever experienced.

  
For context, he is ex military, works a dead end job (not even managerial) because he has work issues (straight from his dad's mouth but from his, obviously none of it is his fault), and he hasn't been in a relationship in a decade after his divorce, and he has a teen daughter. 

  
His latest stunt was the love you text and giving me some stupid gift for my cruise next week. I haven't even opened it I don't want it. I want out while maintaining my space in my sport league. 

  
What do I do?

On the surface, it’s coffee shops, tech start-ups, ferry rides, and traffic on I-5. Underneath, it’s Veil Accords, old blood pacts, and things with teeth and claws that never left when the world moved on. Vampires, werewolves, witches, hunters, and utterly mundane humans all move through the same city lights and back roads, working, loving, surviving… and trying very hard not to let the truth slip into the headlines.



The group focuses on character-driven, freeform storytelling: slice-of-life scenes, slow-burn drama, supernatural investigations, quiet horror, and the messy politics of keeping the secret in a city wired with cameras and social media. Want to play the exhausted FBI agent who keeps catching cases that don’t make sense, the bartender whose regulars include both wolves and cops, the occultist in a Capitol Hill walk-up who knows too much, or the hunter who’s starting to doubt the cause? There’s a rich, established lore foundation—werewolf packs, vampire societies, hunter cells, government departments, and more—but it’s built to give you hooks, not fences.



*Back Roads & City Lights* is a collaborative sandbox for players who enjoy long-term arcs, found family, and consequences that actually matter. Plots can be intimate or sprawling: a single rainy night in a Pioneer Square alley, a multi-thread investigation running from Belltown to the backwoods, or the slow unraveling of a character who realizes the world is nothing like they thought. If you’re looking for a grounded modern setting with room to tell your stories—where the supernatural is hidden but never passive—we’d be happy to have you pull off the highway, park under the flickering neon, and step into the dark with us.



* An 18+ Semi-Lit to Novella Modern Fantasy Role-Play.
* Deep World Lore thats always expanding and evolving.
* Multiple locations within the Puget Sound Area to play within. From the mist-filled forests of the Cascades, to the urban sprawl of the Seattle metro area
* Welcoming to the novice and veteran alike, Knowledgeable Admin and Mods to support you in answering questions about the lore and in character creation.

Despite the Pistons having one of the league’s best defenses, Portland is far more capable at home than they are on the road, and they still somehow managed 116 points in Detroit back on Dec 5th. I think the home squad puts enough on the board here to make for a high-scoring encounter. I’m on the Over to cash.

1pt9ul2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dysphagia/comments/1pt9ul2/cup_that_lets_you_drink_normal_liquids_without/,Cup that lets you drink normal liquids without thickener,"Hi everyone. I’m an engineer, and a close family member of mine has dysphagia. She’s told me on multiple occasions that she hates the thickened texture of coffee and soft drinks and the like.

So, I’m exploring the idea of a cup/lid that mechanically controls how liquid enters your mouth, instead of changing the liquid itself.
Basically, you could drink thin liquids (water, coffee, juice) in very small, controlled sips because the cup is automatically doing the “slowing down” instead of the liquid. It would let small amounts of liquid through based on a timer or some other metric. 

I know everyone’s dysphagia is different, so I’m genuinely trying to understand whether this would be useful,unsafe, annoying, or just not worth it.

If you’re comfortable sharing, I’d really appreciate honest answers to any of these:

Would you personally try something like this?
What would make you immediately say “no”?
What worries you most about drinking thin liquids?
Have you already decided thickened liquids are the lesser evil?

Please don’t hold back, critical feedback is much more helpful than encouragement.",2,1766434824.0,dysphagia,2,1.0,False

1pt9sgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1pt9sgh/colbro_moka_pot_its_legit_buying_guide_numbers/,Colbro Moka Pot - it's legit (buying guide + numbers inside),"I've waited some days to dial in the Colbro Moka Pot and post my review, so here it is, including how I got it in the first place here in Switzerland. 

TL;DR the Colbro Moka Pot is legit and it might come closest to a moka espresso.

**Backstory**

  
I've started with an aluminium Moka Pot Express, which did ok coffee but nothing spectacular. Due to health concerns from the aluminium I then switched to the Bialetti Venus, which to this day is getting some brews from time to time. It's been my daily driver for a very long time, until I got annoyed by the inside part of the top, which is quite difficult to clean and almost always has some residue (even though I've cleaned it every day after use). 

That brought me to my [Giannina Moka Pot](https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1gwhq2h/giannini_questions_31_owners/), which I've acquired via subito in Italy and used a forwarding address to bring it to Switzerland. I was very excited but [never could get the right brew to work](https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1hklk4p/giannina_experts_i_need_your_input/) (I might have an idea as to why, more details below). Some brews were really, really bad, until [I found the perfect ratio](https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1k51iwd/giannina_wizards_whats_your_secret/).

Going back and forth with ChatGPT to improve the coffee with the Giannina didn't help either (ChatGPT seems to be a horrible sparring partner that doesn't really know moka pot variables 🤷‍♂️)

But I never really liked the coffee from the Giannina, so I switched back to a Venus as my daily driver, until...

  
**What is this thing?!**

  
I came across [this post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1k194qi/very_creamy_coffee_with_moka_pot/), when searching for something else and immediately got hooked. Crema is something we're not used to seeing from the moka pots, and even if it's foamy, it's obviously not crema that stays. 

  
But this looked different, so I went onto research and to find out how to buy this thing. 

Second hand sites in and around Switzerland didn't have anything. People kept talking about AliExpress listings but I wasn't able to find it until I saw that someone posted that it's available on TaoBao only (Chinese AliExpress, selling other products, mostly local).

  
**The order process or how to get a Colbro Moka Pot to your country**

  
Through trial and error I was able to order the Colbro Moka Pot in China to Switzerland and thought I was done with the process.

2 days later the order got canceled and I was chatting with Colbro's people directly. They were essentially saying no shipping to Switzerland. 

  
So I had to research again and found shopping agents via reddit. These are people that buy and repackage/ship the product to you for a fee. I talked to a few but thought it was expensive and came across an agent shipping service called [Sugargoo](https://www.sugargoo.com/). 

  
You paste the TaoBao link (try to switch the language first, otherwise do it on the web via Google Translate) to Sugargoo and then select the variant. Then you select your extras if needed and a specific agent or a random one. 

Make sure to estimate shipping to your country before you order, as this can be quite expensive. 

  
I cost me around 60 USD just for the shipping! But it arrived within a week, which was pretty efficient. 

Within Sugargoo you can see whenever the product goes onto the next step and the customer support is quite helpful (needed an address change).

  
**The numbers**

  
I paid

  
83 USD for the Colbro Moka Pot

14 USD for a stainless steel powder ring + tamper (the tamper is plastic unfortunately)

2 USD for a distribution tool

62 USD for shipping to Switzerland

  
161 USD all in and it took a week to get delivered via FedEx.

  
That's quite expensive for a moka pot but my alternative at this stage was the Alessi 9090 or stay with the Bialetti Venus and I really wanted to try the Colbro.

  
**The package**

  
This is what you get when you get your package:

[Contents](https://imgur.com/a/7YNibfU)

And here's a comparison of the gasket from an aluminium Bialetti (should be 2/3 cup) as I thought they looked similar sized:

[Gasket comparison](https://imgur.com/a/ne1Csqh)

So the Colbro gasket is much thicker, but the Bialetti one does actually fit the Colbro (I haven't made coffee with it yet).

  
**The crema**



So does it live up to its hype? I'd say definitely, yes. I've used the spring that was in the package, but haven't used the cup inside the bottom part (which you can do to increase the pressure even more) and I've still gotten an amazing cup of coffee, or dare I say, espresso out of it. 

[Here's one image](https://imgur.com/a/VEybjiG)

You can look up u/Helpful_Big_1727's posts and you'll see even more daily brews where it's clear this thing is legit. 

I'd say it's between a moka pot and an espresso machine, but still much cheaper than a 9barista which apparently has even more moving parts. So bang for buck for espresso interested people, this is perfect.

I either drink it as an espresso shot, or as an Americano which I've tried today (h/t to u/Helpful_Big_1727) and it was easily the best coffee I've made at home in the last 3-4 years.

[Here's a video of the brew](https://streamable.com/jnrkx3)

**The ratio**

  
I use 16g of Stoll Kaffee Brazil, which is 100% arabica (check it out [here](https://www.stoll-kaffee.ch/produkt/brasil/).) and around 110ml of hot tap water (not boiling/boiled). On the electric stove from 0-6 I put it on 4.5, although 5 would work as well. As soon as coffee comes out I slow it down to 2.5 and let it run. I cool it down before it sputters.

I haven't tried it with an Aeropress filter yet, but will do so soon. 

  
**Worries? Negative points?**

  
\- This thing is heavy, weighing at around 1kg, but it's rock solid

\- There is very little English content around the pot, which is a pity considering its good build quality and innovative approach. There is a detailed video from a Korean coffee expert, which I still need to translate ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ4gG1pzHtk))

\- In the Korean video there were two points worth mentioning: 1. Putting the cup inside of the bottom part will increase pressure, but due to its non-bendable structure might cause an explosion - THIS WAS BY A COMMENTER I HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER THAT IS TRUE, I'M NOT A PHYSICIST. 2. There were some concerns of the product being made in China and its build quality or the type of stainless steel. It's cast (casted?) so some people mentioned potential leaks. 

These are the only two negativ points in my opinion but I have literally no idea how I can proof/test these without an absolute expert in the field. So any metal/stainless steel experts, please chime in. I'd be happy to provide pictures/weights/videos of the pot if that helps in any way.

As for the negative ""made in China"" arguments, I don't see it. A lot of great products are nowadays made in China (yes even your Bialetti moka pot!) and I think the quality of this moka pot is really, really good.

i’ve attempted before. it was 2 or 3 years ago i think. i can’t remember the exact date bc i’ve been dissociating. i’m losing memories. i gave the whole “life” thing a try but it doesn’t even seem worth it. i am self-aware. i understand im  not the only person in the world. i used to fascinate over the idea of the word “sonder” ( i even made it my gamer tag),  the truth that every person you walk by, be it the barista serving you coffee or the man busking in the street, has their own story to their life where they are the main character. but over time i slowly started to turn away from people. i’ve lost interest in them. everything is just looking like its fake. i don’t see the “beauty” in nature or life that others supposedly sees. i’m already beginning to not care anymore. i’ve got so much fucked up, messy screwups in my life that i “have” to sort out to be able to move on with life but i just don’t care. i’m a void, an abyss that is slowly rotting and i don’t care. yea i may be selfish, but so is everyone else.
