Yesterday, I went on a date with this guy. Handsome, funny, kind of perfect. He held the door for me, made me laugh till my sides hurt, and, I kid you not, the way he smiled? Total heart-melter.  

Here‚Äôs the kicker though: we‚Äôve been married for 2+ years. YEARS. But last night? It felt like I was meeting him for the first time all over again.  

There I was, sipping my coffee, trying to play it cool, but internally I was screaming, ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, who let you marry this snack?!‚Äù Every smile, every little thing he said‚Äîugh, I was melting.

Is this normal? Do I send him a cheesy love letter at this point or just awkwardly stare at him from across the room until he notices? I swear, marriage is wild. You think you know someone, and then BAM, you‚Äôre falling for them all over again.

Anyway, just wanted to share my little love spiral. If you need me, I‚Äôll be here daydreaming about him like a middle schooler with a crush.

1h3yhqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1h3yhqo/the_best_furniture_layouts_for_creating/,The Best Furniture Layouts for Creating Functional and Stylish Rooms,"Designing the perfect furniture layout can transform your house into a haven of style and functionality. From selecting the right pieces to arranging them for both aesthetics and practicality, the layout of your [house furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) plays a vital role in creating a home that is inviting and comfortable. Whether you're working with a small apartment or a spacious living room, here are some expert tips for crafting layouts that are both functional and stylish.

# 1. Start with a Focal Point

Every room needs a focal point to anchor the design. This could be a fireplace, a large window, or even a statement piece like a [round coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/coffee-tables-side-tables/round-coffee-tables). Arrange your seating around this focal point to create a sense of harmony and purpose. For example, pairing [natural furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) like rattan chairs or wooden sofas with a round coffee table can lend an organic, grounded feel to the space.

# 2. Prioritize Functionality

When planning your layout, consider how the room will be used. Is it for entertaining guests, family movie nights, or quiet reading sessions? Functional layouts depend on the flow of movement. For example:

* In a living room, leave clear pathways between the sofa, chairs, and coffee table.
* In a dining area, ensure enough space around the dining table for chairs to pull out comfortably.

Natural furniture such as wooden dining chairs or benches can add warmth and versatility to these functional spaces.

# 3. Incorporate Multi-Functional Pieces

In smaller rooms, multifunctional furniture is key. Ottomans with hidden storage, sofa beds, or nesting tables allow you to make the most of your space without sacrificing style. Pairing these with timeless, **house furniture** pieces like a modular sectional or extendable dining tables ensures flexibility for various needs.

# 4. Layer with Textures and Materials

Using a mix of materials and textures can elevate your furniture layout. Natural furniture, such as a solid wood dining table, pairs beautifully with softer elements like upholstered chairs. A **round coffee table** with a marble or wood top can be the perfect centerpiece, adding both visual interest and practicality.

# 5. Maximize Small Spaces

For compact rooms, focus on vertical and corner spaces. Utilize bookshelves, wall-mounted desks, and corner sofas to save floor space. Position furniture to create zones within the room, such as a cozy reading nook by the window or a dining area near the kitchen. **Natural furniture** like a light-toned wooden bookshelf can make a small space feel open and airy.

# 6. Balance Style and Comfort

While aesthetics are important, comfort should never be overlooked. Choose pieces that are as practical as they are stylish. For example:

* Opt for armchairs with plush cushions but sleek silhouettes.
* Use a **round coffee table** in the living room for a softer, approachable vibe, ideal for both conversation and functionality.

Balancing natural and modern elements creates a design that feels timeless and welcoming.

# 7. Create Conversation Areas

Furniture should encourage interaction. Arrange seating to face each other, ensuring everyone feels included. A **round coffee table** is perfect for centralizing the seating arrangement while providing easy access to drinks or d√©cor.

# 8. Let Natural Light Lead

Position your house furniture to maximize natural light. Avoid blocking windows with large furniture. Use mirrors and reflective surfaces to amplify light, and complement the space with natural furniture like wooden chairs or wicker accent pieces for a fresh, organic look.

# Final Thoughts

Creating functional and stylish furniture layouts requires careful planning and thoughtful choices. By incorporating elements like **natural furniture**, strategically placing a **round coffee table**, and considering the flow and purpose of each room, you can design a home that is both beautiful and practical. Transform your house furniture into a harmonious blend of form and function, and watch as your rooms come to life.",1,1733040132.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

1h3ygag,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1h3ygag/kandy_ella_train_tickets/,Kandy - Ella Train Tickets,"Hi all,

Mods - sorry if not allowed, just trying to help others and share up-to-date experience of booking this journey. This post details my experience of booking this journey so that others can avoid making the same mistake as I have made.  

My wife and I have booked some Second Class Reserves tickets through ""12go"" for the journey between Kandy and Ella. This has cost roughly ¬£40 (for two) and needed to be done about 32 days ahead of travel. 

The problem is, there is no guarantee that they will be able to get the tickets. We selected the non-flexible option through the website which means that we either get our chosen seat type or none at all and a refund. 

We are now 30 days ahead of travel. I woke up at 4:25am (UK Time - 10:00am SL Time) to see if I could get some of the same seat type through the official website ( https://seatreservation.railway.gov.lk/mtktwebslr/ ) at the crazy cheap rate they typically go on sale for (as a back up that we could give away if 12go pulled through). 

What everyone says about them seemingly selling out instantly is true. No tickets in our preferred category were available by about 4:32am (UK Time). I was on the website when they were added but before I could fill out my details, I was getting an error message. Shame, these were considerably cheaper and would have saved a lot of anxiety. 

My advice here is that you may have some more luck if you click on your train and then scroll straight down to your preferred ticket type BEFORE entering your details.. May work, may not, but worth a shot! 

If this fails, do not give up. Try the other stated 'tricks' like putting Badulla as your destination, not Ella (I'd probably recommend this anyway, may have more luck!). 

Check back regularly. More tickets became available at intervals, but was fairly random. Some Second Class Reserved were available at 6:30am and more at 7:15am (UK Time). Even after showing as none available or just first class, a quick refresh or tweak of the search yielded tickets in my experience. You just have to be patient. These tickets were, again, second class reserved, but at 6000-7000LKR each (about ¬£32-¬£38 for two). 

Having already spent similar through 12go, I opted not to book these as paying these inflated rates twice  seemed illogical. If 12go don't pull through, we will have to take a taxi (which a mate has told me was quite a pleasant experience when he did it, with lots of stops at viewpoints and waterfalls). 

I will report back here on 12Go's performance. I'm hoping as I could see tickets, so could they and they got us some (despite there being a lower profit margin for them). 

Moral of the story - back yourself and book at the offical website ( https://seatreservation.railway.gov.lk/mtktwebslr/ ). Set an alarm and be prepared to sit there for an hour of so (not hard to sit in bed with a coffee and occasionally go back and refresh). 

For the record, I also read online that tickets were now on sale from 7pm or midnight local Sri Lankan time.. I found that a very limited selection came up when I looked! 

Have read online that second class reserved is the way to go as it has opening windows. Have also read that if you have a first class reserved you can walk through the train to second class and do all of the out of door hanging for Instagram you like, before heading back (we aren't interested in this but appreciate some are for IG). 

Please feel free to comment in future with updates to keep future travellers informed!

In addition to that they provided decent coffee, a yoga platform overseeing the pine forest and even SUPs to enjoy the sundowner on the nearby lake.

The highlight for us was the bonfire/barbecue together with Momo (the owner) and her godmother at the ""Pine Peak"". As they only have 2 rooms I can't really recommend them enough, if you're searching for a oasis of peace. Can't wait to come back one day ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,1733039842.0,VietNam,1,1.0,False

The depression didn't end because money finally trickled down from the generous 'job creators'- the depression ended because the top tax rate was high and because of the WPA.  It paid well, it hired many, and it got a lot of work done around the country that needed done. 

This is the reason boomers growing up in the 40's and 50's still think you can go to college for 50 bucks and 6 hens.  The reason they think avocado toast and iced coffee are the reason people working full time can't afford to buy a home.  They got to benefit from investing in the middle and have actively fought to assure no one else ever will.   

I want to believe they're just oblivious and not actively nefarious because if so that's some genuine villainy towards their grandkids. 

The right has long made it clear they believe in investing in the top, the left tries to counter by trying to appeal to the bottom- but 'trickle up' is just as flawed as trickle down, because it goes from the bottom straight to the top.  The middle is where all the action happens.  They don't throw it all at debt collectors, nor do they stick it in an offshore account- they buy stuff.  They buy cars, they go out to eat, they go on vacation, the hire contractors, they upgrade their washers and dryers BEFORE the old ones break.  It's why the WPA worked so well and I would presume at least 70% of politicians are aware of this history so why are NONE of them even hinting of any interest in investing in the middle?

1h3ydr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1h3ydr5/how_to_choose_timeless_furniture_that_never_goes/,How to Choose Timeless Furniture That Never Goes Out of Style,"In a world of ever-changing trends, choosing timeless furniture ensures your home remains stylish and functional for years to come. Timeless pieces are not only a smart investment but also form the foundation of a versatile and sophisticated space. Here‚Äôs a guide to help you select furniture that stands the test of time while incorporating modern staples like a [black coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables), a cozy [2 seater sofa](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/munich-sofa-white), and elegant [bar stools Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/bar-stools).

# 1. Focus on Classic Designs

Timeless furniture often features clean lines, neutral colors, and minimalistic details. Look for pieces that exude simplicity and elegance, such as a **2 seater sofa** in a neutral hue. Whether in a compact apartment or a spacious living room, a sofa with classic proportions and comfortable upholstery becomes a forever favorite.

**Tip:** Avoid overly trendy colors or patterns that might feel dated in a few years. Opt for tones like beige, gray, or navy that blend seamlessly with evolving decor.

# 2. Invest in High-Quality Materials

Durability is key to furniture that lasts. Solid wood, genuine leather, and high-quality fabrics age gracefully, developing a patina that adds to their charm. For instance, a **black coffee table** crafted from sturdy materials like oak or marble combines functionality with timeless appeal.

**Pro Tip:** When shopping for furniture in Dubai, explore options that balance aesthetic value and durability. For example, browse reputable stores offering [dining chairs in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/dining-room-furniture/dining-chairs) made from solid wood or metal with refined upholstery.

# 3. Choose Versatile Pieces

Timeless furniture works well in various settings and styles. Items like a **black coffee table** can adapt to modern, industrial, or even bohemian decor themes, making it an ideal anchor for your living room. Similarly, **bar stools in Dubai** with a sleek, understated design can fit perfectly in both contemporary kitchens and classic bar setups.

**Versatility Hack:** Look for furniture with multipurpose functionality. A **2 seater sofa** can double as a guest bed or a cozy reading nook, making it a practical yet stylish addition.

# 4. Embrace Neutral and Monochrome Palettes

Neutral tones and monochrome color schemes ensure that your furniture stays relevant through changing design fads. A **black coffee table** adds a touch of bold sophistication while remaining neutral enough to pair with different colors and textures over time.

**Dining Room Style Tip:** Incorporate **dining chairs in Dubai** with soft, neutral tones to create a cohesive and inviting atmosphere that complements various dining tables and decor elements.

# 5. Add Timeless Accents

Small details can make a big difference in enhancing the longevity of your furniture. Opt for pieces with elegant accents such as tufted cushions, rolled arms, or tapered legs. These details ensure that your furniture never feels plain, even as your tastes evolve.

**Example:** Combine timeless furniture like a **2 seater sofa** with statement accessories, such as a plush throw or an intricately designed rug, to keep your living space fresh.

# 6. Pay Attention to Proportions

Furniture that‚Äôs appropriately scaled to your space will always look stylish. Avoid oversized or undersized items that disrupt the balance of the room. For example, **bar stools in Dubai** with sleek silhouettes are perfect for smaller kitchens or open-plan layouts, while **dining chairs in Dubai** with medium backs offer an ideal mix of comfort and visual appeal for dining areas.

# 7. Stick to Timeless Furniture Categories

Some furniture types never go out of style. Here are a few must-haves:

* **Black Coffee Table:** A chic centerpiece that grounds your living room.
* **2 Seater Sofa:** Perfect for compact spaces or adding extra seating.
* **Bar Stools in Dubai:** An essential for breakfast bars or entertainment areas.
* **Dining Chairs in Dubai:** Versatile and elegant, they elevate any dining experience.

# Conclusion: Invest in Longevity

Choosing timeless furniture is all about prioritizing quality, versatility, and classic aesthetics. Whether you‚Äôre selecting a **black coffee table** to anchor your living room, a cozy **2 seater sofa** for intimate evenings, or stylish **bar stools in Dubai** to complement your kitchen, timeless pieces ensure your home remains effortlessly chic through the years. Pair these with high-quality **dining chairs in Dubai** for a complete look that transcends trends.

Aragorn ""Aaron"" Bartkowski was a programmer working at Epic DungeoneeringTM, the world's largest fantasy video game company. Much to his surprise, he was selected to pick up the latest manuscript from reclusive author Larry C.C. Weis. Weis had been working on his newest book for over a decade and the good folk at Aaron's company had dibs on adapting it. Unfortunately, Weis was also a wizard and sent Aaron to the world that inspired his books. Aaron proceeded to find himself in a Slavic mythology themed world where he's believed to be Weis' main character, Garland of Nowhere. Equipped with the powers of a RPG protagonist, Aaron must accumulate experience and equipment while navigating a setting that seems worse off than Game of Thrones and Dark Souls put together.

LORDS OF DRAGON KEEP is a LitRPG progression fantasy isekai that takes the grim out of grimdark with biting humor as well as intelligent exploitation of the rules. It has excellent world-building, a great supporting cast, a bit of romance, and lots of laughs. Oh and there's a talking raven.

I'm pleased to share my latest book with y'all and thought you'd enjoy that, for the price of a cup of coffee, you can continue an author ruthlessly mocking dark fantasy. So toss a coin to your Witcher and pick up a copy.

But I was beginning to look like I'm 54. My face has endured months of years of untreated sun damage and photo aging. I have enlarged pores, dark skin patches and tan (especially on the forehead) and of course, large dark circles around my eyes which weren't even visible coz the rest of my face was beginning to get so dark. 

Last month I started with a regular skincare routine

Today I finally saw my dark circles and felt a bit relieved 

And in the process I discovered a genius technique that helped me improve my skincare process (not routine, just the process of applying products on the face)

My list of products looks like this:

- a face wash (Nivea Men All in 1 Charcoal Facewash, feels very cool, usually at least once every day)

- The Man Company Vit E and Shea Butter moisturizer (1-2 times per day) 

- Plum 50 SPF sunscreen (2% niacinamide) (at least once every day before leaving the house, I WFH and only go out for coffee and such)

- Minimalist 2% Granactive Retinoid (every 3 days at night)

So far I'd been using only cold water to wash my face throughout 

Today I used hot water before applying anything to open up my pores. 

And when I did the cleanser and washed it off with regular cold tap water, and looked in the mirror.

I was shocked by the glow.

Last month I was demotivated and bored. I picked up skincare so I wouldn't go bored while recovering from my back injury.

That's how I know I am on the right path. This feels like a victory!)

1h3y2rx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1h3y2rx/how_do_i_know_if_he_wants_to_make_me_his_gf/,How do I know if he wants to make me his gf?,"I F(24) have been seeing this guy M(20) for about a month now. I‚Äôm a bit tired of diddling around with people who have no serious intent, so looking for some insight. Our first date we went out to dinner and then smoked a joint looking out at the city view; laughed and talked for hours. That went super well, but he dropped the bomb that he lives a couple states away (6 hour drive). Because of how well the date went (I truly RARELY have liked anyone so much after 1 initial meeting) I was a little bummed, but offered FaceTime to keep in touch. After he went back to his state, he has asked for FaceTime regularly and I do force myself some nights even when I‚Äôm exhausted after work because I want to reciprocate the effort. 2nd date he snuck away from the hotel that his college football team was staying at (they were traveling to play out of state) to see me. Based on our FaceTime convos, he‚Äôs really into cologne and perfumes (just scents in general) so I had the corny idea to go to a store and smell shit together and let him pick one for me he liked. Then we rolled up to a late night coffee shop and come to find out he had little papers of all his scents sprayed on them for me to smell and rank so we sat there doing that and comparing our faves and least faves. Super cute and we were out until he absolutely had to be back before coaches found out he was gone. 3rd date he came back to my state (his family lives here) for thanksgiving and we went and saw a movie then talked in his truck for hours. Just got back from our 4th date and we went and got sushi then talked in his truck again for more hours. Then we drove somewhere scenic, the making out got pretty heavy, and we moved to the back. Clothes came off and I had to stop him and say ‚Äúwe need to put our clothes back on‚Äù which he was fine about. He didn‚Äôt really ask any questions and I didn‚Äôt want him to feel rejected so I pretty much just said ‚Äúthat would ruin it‚Äù in a joking tone and when he was like ‚Äú?‚Äù I said I don‚Äôt sleep with people I‚Äôm not committed to (aka official with) and he said he respected that but then got pretty quiet and we were just bumping to music but he seemed fine. I asked him if he wanted sex to clarify his intentions and he basically said it would be nice but that‚Äôs not all he wanted. Ok. Cool, but I‚Äôve heard that one a thousand times. Eventually I‚Äôd like an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious about you/this‚Äù or any sort of further clarification on the progression of our relationship. I think the rejection probably took a small blow to his ego because he‚Äôs an attractive guy and most likely isn‚Äôt denied sex often. We got water at a gas station then he asked me ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs next‚Äô and I said it was time for me to go home pretty much but he didn‚Äôt seem to want to end the date (this happens often with him). We ended on a good note it wasn‚Äôt super awkward at all and honestly super proud of myself for not having sex w him because that was hard and it truly DOES ruin it for me if I‚Äôm not a thousand percent sure the other person involved is serious and committed to me. Our main points of conflict are religion and wanting kids - I need to be VERY sure about bringing kids into the world and he wants them no questions asked. He‚Äôs also heavily Christian but so many of our discussions have been about religion and if our values allign. I‚Äôd say we generally agree on a lot of religious values and beliefs, I just don‚Äôt label myself Christian. So. I don‚Äôt know. Based on our interactions - is this worth pursuing? Is he going to take me seriously or is this some elaborate scheme for sex because he enjoys the challenge? He APPEARS to be very into me since he is always asking to FaceTime, doesn‚Äôt want time with me to end, and dates have all gone really well. I‚Äôve been burned pretty hard before, so I am just trying to learn my lesson from the older/wiser and get clarity before I fall too hard to see any red flags. ",1,1733038366.0,dating,2,1.0,False

Today, I opened [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/oakland/comments/1h2yp35/best_ethiopian_in_oakland/) post and saw someone recommend Desta which is up by Adams Point. I actually remembered this place, because my wife and I walked past it on the second day of its soft opening almost 2 years ago. We said we'd come back to check it out eventually. After seeing that post, I was inspired to finally take us there!

Well long-story short, my wife and I just went today and it was absolutely incredible. The food just absolutely filled our soul. And part of that might be because the owner (?) was so sweet to us. It felt like we were visiting her home and being served lunch. 

My favorite part: A man from the neighborhood stopped by just to chat. The owner then showed us this tradition where you roast green coffee and carry the pan over to the guests to share the aroma. She even offered to pour us a cup even though she was making it for the friend who stopped by! As I'm typing this post, I tried to look for specifics and actually found there's a whole wikipedia article about this ceremony: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_ceremony_of_Ethiopia_and_Eritrea

We just felt so warm and fuzzy from that whole interaction. I can't imagine having that experience anywhere else. I love Oakland man. Felt like we found the true meaning of Thanksgiving today.",32,1733038099.0,oakland,2,0.98,False

1h3xyf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/RSbookclub/comments/1h3xyf9/by_grand_central_station_i_sat_down_and_wept/,By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept - Elizabeth Smart,"O the water of love that floods everything over, so that there is nothing the eye sees that is not covered in. There is no angle the world can assume which the love in my eye cannot make into a symbol of love. Even the precise geometry of his hand, when I gaze at it, dissolves me into water and I flow away in a flood of love.

Everything flows like the Mississippi over a devastated earth, which drinks unsurfeited, and augments the liquid with waterfalls of gratitude; which raises a sound of praise to deafen all doubters forever; to burst their shamed eardrums with the roar of proof, louder than bombs or screams or the inside ticking of remorse. Not all the poisonous tides of the blood I have spilt can influence these tidals of love.

But how can I go through the necessary daily motions, when such an intense fusion turns the world to water?

The overflow drenches all my implements of trivial intercourse. I stare incomprehension at the simplest question from a stranger, standing as if bewitched, half-smiling, like an idiot, feeling this fiery fluid spill out of my eyes.

I am possessed by love and have no options. When the Ford rattles up to the door, five minutes (five years) late, and he walks across the lawn under the pepper-trees, I stand behind the gauze curtains, unable to move to meet him, or to speak, as I turn to liquid to invade his every orifice when he opens the door. More single-purposed than the new bird, all mouth with his one want, I close my eyes and tremble, anticipating the heaven of actual touch.

When we lie near the swimming pool in the sun, he comes through the bamboo bushes like land emerging from chaos. But I am the land, and he is the face upon the waters. He is the moon upon the tides, the dew, the rain, all seeds and all the honey of love. My bones are crushed like the bamboo-trees. I am the earth the plants grow through. But when they sprout I also will be a god.

And there is so much for me, I am suddenly so rich, and I have done nothing to deserve it, to be so overloaded. All after such a desert. All after I had learnt to say, I am nothing, and I deserve nothing.

The thick pines drop globular cones; the dishevelled palms, with their pantaloons falling down their trunks say,

It has happened, the miracle has arrived, everything begins today, everything you touch is born; the new moon attended by two enormous stars; the sunny day fading with a glow to exhilaration; all the paraphernalia of existence, all my sad companions of these last twenty years, the pots and pans in Mrs Wurtle‚Äôs kitchen, ribbons of streets, wilted geraniums, thin children‚Äôs legs, all the world solicits me with joy, leaps at me electrically, claiming its birth at last.

* * *

When we tear ourselves out of the night and come into the kitchen, Mrs Wurtle says, ‚ÄòRomance, eh?‚Äô, but she smiles, she turns away her head, and when we kiss behind her back as we help her dry the dishes, she says, ‚ÄòOh, you two love-birds, go on out again!‚Äô

What is going to happen? Nothing. For everything has happened. All time is now, and time can do no better. Nothing can ever be more now than now, and before this nothing was. There are no minor facts in life, there is only the one tremendous one.

We can include the world in our love, and no irritations can disrupt it, not even envy.

Mr Wurtle, sitting on the sofa late at night, says, with a legal air, ‚ÄòThen I have it from you there is such a thing as Love?‚Äô I lean upon the cushion, faint from this few hours‚Äô separation, but I sigh, ‚ÄòYes, oh, yes,‚Äô and then, as if he were describing other worlds, diminutive, so petty I smother them in pity, he describes his intrigues, he bandies the Word that Was in the Beginning.

But the noise of my inside seas, the dazzle of this cataclysmic birth of love in me, cannot hear clearly what he says. To make a response is like rousing a heavy sleeper who longs to remain asleep. I smile, but I am in a trance, there is no reality but love.

I cannot hear beneath his subtle words the beginning of the world‚Äôs antagonism: the hatred of the mediocre for all miracles. All I want is for everyone to go away and leave me a thousand lives in which to muse, only to muse, on this state of completion.

I was taunted so long. The meaning fluttered above my head, always out of reach. Now it has come to rest in me. It has pierced the very centre of the circle. I love, love, love ‚Äì , but he is also all things: the night, the resilient mornings, the tall poinsettias and hydrangeas, the lemon trees, the residential palms, the fruit and vegetables in gorgeous rows, the birds in the pepper-tree, the sun on the swimming pool.

There is no room for pity, of anything. In a bleeding heart I should find only exhilaration in the richness of the red.

Once I skulked wistfully through dim streets, aching after this unknown, hoping to pass by unnoticed in my drab dress and lopsided shoes with high heels, hoping, thus surreptitiously, to come upon it. But I was afraid, I was timid, and I did not believe, I hoped. I thought it would be like a bird in the hand, not a wild sea that treated me like flotsam.

But I have become a part of the earth: I am one of its waves flooding and leaping. I am the same tune now as the trees, hummingbirds, sky, fruits, vegetables in rows. I am all or any of these. I can metamorphose at will.

Do you need some joy or love? Are you sodden leaves in some forsaken yard? Are you deserted or cold or starved or paralysed or blind? Handfuls and handfuls for you, and to spare!

Make them up into bedsocks, teacosies, cushions against the cold, for their electricity is perpetual warmth, and can contaminate everything, and build at one touch a new and adorable world.

This is Today. This is where all roads strove to lead, all feet to attain. What are the world‚Äôs problems and sorrows and errors? I am as at sea, and as ignorant and mystified, as the first day I ever saw algebra.

There are no problems, no sorrows or errors: they join in the urging song that everything sings. This is the state of the angels, that spend their hours only singing the praises of the Lord. Just to lie savouring is enough life. Is enough.

Even in transient coffee-shops and hotels, or the gloom of taverns, the crooning of Bing Crosby out of a jukebox, and the bar-tender clanking glasses, achieve a perfect identity, a high round note of their own flavour, that makes me tearful with the gratitude of reception.

And merely his hand under those shabby tables, or guiding me across the stubble of the fields, makes my happiness as inexhaustible as the ocean, and as warm and comfortable as the womb.

When I saw a horde of cats gathering at a railway terminus to feed on a fish-head thrown near the tracks, I felt, It is the lavishness of my feelings that feeds even the waifs and strays. There are not too many bereaved or wounded but I can comfort them, and those 5,000,000 who never stop dragging their feet and bundles and babies with bloated bellies across Europe, are not too many or too benighted for me to say, Here‚Äôs a world of hope, I can spare a whole world for each and every one, like a rich lady dispensing bags of candy at a poor children‚Äôs Christmas feast.

I can compress the whole Mojave Desert into one word of inspiration, or call all America to obey my whim, like the waiter standing to take my order. I am delirious with power and invulnerability.

Take away what is supposed to be enviable: the silver brushes with my name, the long gown, the car, the hundred suitors, poise in a restaurant ‚Äì I am still richer than the greediest heart could conceive, able to pour my overflowing benevolence over even the tight-mouthed look. Take everything I have, or could have, or anything the world could offer, I am still empress of a new-found land, that neither Columbus nor Cortez could have equalled, even in their instigating dream.

Girl 1 - in person says she‚Äôd love to meet up over boardgames a common interest and when I followed up via text twice left me on read. She mentioned being in limbo with her ex so likely not being single. In my perspective that was totally fine and I would have adjusted

Girl 2 - adds me to her close friends list on Instagram, we have a few minor exchanges over the past few months. She tells me to let her know when I go out again. I do but she‚Äôs not free so I ask her to meet up for coffee since I think she‚Äôs cool and would want to get to know her. She asks what i‚Äôm looking for and I respond with possibly friends since I guess you could say I tried looking for romance with her friend. Her response was simply a hahaha.

‚ú® Embrace Gratitude:Start the day with a heart full of thanks. Every sunrise is a reminder that we are given another chance to grow, love, and live.



‚ú® Prioritize Peace: Life can be loud, but peace is found in the quiet moments‚Äîwhether it's a walk in nature, a sip of coffee, or time spent with loved ones. Seek and protect these moments.



‚ú® Choose Kindness:Your small acts of kindness today might be the light someone else needs. A smile, a kind word, or a helping hand can ripple farther than you imagine.



‚ú® Stay Present:Worries about the past or future can steal your joy. Be here, now. Savor the beauty of this moment‚Äîit‚Äôs a gift we often overlook.



‚ú®Keep Growing: No matter where you are in life, there‚Äôs room to learn and evolve. Mistakes don‚Äôt define you; your ability to rise from them does.



This Sunday, take a deep breath. Let go of what doesn‚Äôt serve you. Focus on the things that fill your soul. Let this day be a gentle reminder of all the beauty and potential that life holds.

Later we got some food and she was more open at this point and sat next to me between her friend. I had just told a joke and got up to get water and when I came back they were talking in a lower tone and her friend was like ""I love her, she's great"" and my friend saying ""I know"", and then they stopped talking as I sat back down. And when they dropped me off the friend let us be alone to talk.

(Tiny white worms) ,"I was sick for the past 5 days - with a bad cold and fever. So yea 3 days back I had some coffee in a Borosil coffee flask - once I was done - I opened it up - slightly rinsed it without any scrubbing or soap and filled it with water (so that it would be easier to wash later instead of letting it dry - thought I would wash it later that day when I felt better - Coz I was absolutely miserable)

Now today - 3 days later , now that I absolutely forgot about the flask and the cap - I found maggots (Tiny white worms) on the lid alone (it had a slight amount of water) - especially in the place where the elastic of the lid stays and the grooves where the lid secures with the flask 

I was absolutely disgusted by it's sight - is there any way to disinfect it - removing the eggs as well - or the only way is to dispose it? 

I'm a student and I can't really afford another flask at the moment TT - - would throwing the lid in boiling water disinfect it after giving it a general rinse? ",1,1733035699.0,CleaningTips,0,1.0,False

1h3xcxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1h3xcxf/need_advice/,Need advice,"So I matched with this girl on Bumble about a month ago and we had our first date few days ago. I suggested a place but she suggested another place closer to her home. We agreed to meet up at her suggested cafe since its convenient for her. As for me it took me 1 hour to travel to the cafe but i didnt mind. She's older to me and is also a doctor.

Initially, the date was postponed last minute as she had some ermegency to attend to and offered to postpone it to the next day. Before the postponement, she told me that she would get back to me by 12 pm on the specific time to meet since she's a doctor and is always on call. I said sure no worries and waited for her confirmation. Hours went by (around 4 pm already)  and i didnt get any text to confirm her time. Thats when i texted her asking if the date is still on for the day. CoupIe of minutes later, she says she has a family ermegency to attend to and suggested that we meet the next day. I agreed and jokingly said ""Sure if coffee is on you haha!"" 

During the date, everything was great. She even insisted that she paid the bill when I suggested that we go Dutch. She said it's her fault for postponing the date and she settled the bill fully. I thanked her and a couple of days later, I planned the second date at some fancy place stating clearly that the next date will be on me. 

It's been 5 days and I'm being ghosted. This feeling sucks. Before the date she usually replies/texts in a timely manner even if busy. She is online on her socials but not replying to me. 

The first text after the date was me asking her number as I completely forgot to ask since we were having a good conversation. I received no reply. 2 days later, I suggested the second date and didn't receive a response. Finally, a couple of days later I triple texted and asked if everything was okay? 

She replied after an hour and i received a very cold response. She said she is busy preparing for a birthday party. She ignored my request for her number. She didn't respond to my second date question. 

Where do I stand here? Should I text her again asking if she is interested in me or no? I feel ghosting is disrespectful and mean. Just be frank if you don't see me as a potential partner. Or is the problem me? 

Need advice.

Friend group is planning a west coast trip in July 2025. We want to spend one week in LA. Two married couples, two single people. We‚Äôve all heard about how LA is a world class city and want to see the best it has to offer. 

We will all be adequately budgeted for it, so parking fees, ubers, tickets, restaurant costs etc wont be an issue, we can do anything within reason. 

One thing we all agreed we really want to avoid is wasting time and money on ‚Äúgimmicky‚Äù experiences. Zero interest in stuff like ‚Äúeating baked potatoes while watching people tap dance‚Äù, or magic shows, or bars where the bartender improvises a drink for you, etc. We want good genuine experiences. We‚Äôre also trying to avoid anything thats really focused around the LGBT community because theres enough of that where we are from and it‚Äôs not our focus. That being said, we aren‚Äôt shy at all about ‚Äúedgier‚Äù places and we‚Äôre actually seeking out anything thats exclusive or can WOW us. If it‚Äôs something where the best of it is found LA, we want that. 

Group interests: Nature/outdoor recreation (beaches, forests, mountains), car culture, museums/landmarks, great food+bars, coffee, live music/raves/festivals. We‚Äôre all really into history, art, and sports. We‚Äôre very active. 

Any suggestions much appreciated. We are running into choice paralysis trying to do research on google and youtube and cant really tell what is worth it or not.

It is a struggle to find a good (let alone excellent) clean cup in Indian market even after lot of reaserch. Most coffee are very low to mid for delicate filter brewing.

Was casually browsing through Rosette Coffee's website, saw some of their offerings which caught my interest. It was a bit expensive but ordered anyway in hope of a good cup. I ordered Ratnagiri Koji Naturals, Ratnagiri Inoculated Washed and Krishnagiri Yellow Honey. All had claims of high SCA rating (86+).

Oh boy I was surprised ! This is gourmet !

1. **Ratnagiri Koji Naturals -** Fermented, sweet fruit flavours, but in a pleasant way. Light acidity balances the taste and makes you wanting more.
2. **Ratnagiri Inoculated Washed -** Starts with floral (rose petals?), light acidity, balanced sweetness and finishes with slight nuttyness. What a complex yet clean cup !

Yet to try the Krishnagiri Yellow Honey but I have high hopes for it as well.

Ordered a lamp, my contractor was too slow on placing orders on lots of my stuff during a rebuild after a fire. 3 lights I wanted were never received or so he thought. After the 3rd one didn't come, I figured I'd just order it and have them reimburse me for it. Got the ok and ordered one, then a day later I was told that my new bathroom fixture came in and it's laying in the floor in the bathroom. I go check and see that it's actually the kit hem light I was told that was lost or something. 

So I ask the AE seller to just cancel if they didn't ship yet. Explaining I don't need it now  2 days later I get a message from the seller saying it's too late it was shipped  when I checked tracking it showed that the item was dropped off 2 days after I sent my nessage. They just quickly and recklessly shipped it out and waited to reply till after it was too late. 

Then 2 months later I get it with gouges in the frame from poor packing of the ballast box plus the cover piece was falling off due to it not cut correctly at the factory. 

AE wants pictures of the damage and denied my return refund. So I appeal and while I'm shooting video of it I notice that the wires that suspend it are not exiting the frame correctly. 

4 wires hold it and 2 of them come from the top of the frame as it should be but the opposite ends have the wires coming out on the bottom of the frame! 

It looks like AE sellers are getting factory rejects and selling them, that's the 2nd time I got something with manufacturing errors in 2 weeks. This lamp is a spiralling twisted led light that should look really cool but it's all fucked up from shipping and assembled wrong making it unusable. 

To fix it would require removing the wires and drinking a hole in top in 2 spots, rerouting the wires and holding them black on. It would then have scratches dings and 2 visible holes on the bottom of the frames. If this was a $30 light I wouldn't care but this wAs a $120+ purchase and I would expect much better for the price. 

First request was denied (as all $100+ are) then I reopened and was again denied! So I appealed and discovered the wire issues as well as a best up light. 

There's no way I should be stuck with this piece of shit and yet AE is going along with another dishonest seller who ignores my cancellation request. I almost had it returned to sender when it was delivered but I wanted to make sure I got a refund for it so  I opened the dispute once I saw the condition. 

It's little things like this that you won't notice till you're actually ready to hang it but I noticed it right away and couldn't figure out how the hell they expected it to be hung as it's wired now. I suspect the seller knows this issue when they bought them for next to nothing. 

I've really had a ton of problems lately and I think it's time to call it quits and stop buying from AE  they support these liars and thieves way too much. By buying here I'm only helping them to succeed in burning everyone on purpose.

I have proof that AE knows when bad sellers pull their tricks. I know because when I got a package that was way too small to have what I bought in it, I opened it in front of my camera and recorded it. 1 item was from another seller and that was there. I opened the dispute for missing items and AE denied it up and down over and over.

It made me wonder why they were so adamant and I looked inside the envelope (I laughingly read someone say that inside that package you'll find a picture of your other items or something) when I dug it out if the trash a did find 3 tiny packages that I had no idea were even in it. They of course were not a full sized sink and 2 faucets, I honestly don't even know what they were, a tiny strap or something. 

But that made me realize why AE was acting as they were. They knew how the scam worked, they knew I should have said incorrect items, I didn't even realize there was anything else in the package but for some reason AE knew. 

So why is AE allowing assholes to do this all in hopes that most people won't send the stuff back in time. There's hundreds of buyers who got scammed  I was not even able to access their stores home screen to do more investigating. I dis see a bunch of buyers who had similar reviews posted before I was blocked. 

So don't believe AE when they say they're looking out for you, they do nothing yo scammers who waste your time and make you struggle with AEs fixed refund bullshit! 

Right when I almost started to trust AE I find out they're right in the middle of it all. They knew I got something but because the weight was so slight they couldn't prove that I did get anything. After 6 times of disputing I finally got my refund.

If I'm screwed on this lamp I'm done 

Oh my unsent and canceled by sellers furniture count is up to 25 orders now in the last 4 months. I got 1 out of 26 orders, a coffee table but every chair, sofa, TV stand hasgone unshipped. 

I ordered a chair through Walmart for the same or less than priced here and it came next day! 1st order, shipped in 1 day! Why do people fight against this scam site when there's honest and fast sellers on Walmart selling the same shit and it's packaged perfectly and costs the exact same as here? 

That want my first Walmart com purchase and for sure isn't my last either. I'm clearing my cart right now and ready to get a laugh when I see what my game play cashes out to be. 

My share of $500k will be exactly $2.50 or less even though a have 187 stars and x17 multiplier and 13x coupons but have not seen anything on how to claim winnings at all. Same with the new games rules and tips page not present 

Just visited the game site and I had 850 stars 13 coupons and I was at 48850 ""points?"" Right at the $5 credit. I signed in yesterday and it wouldn't let me do anything with that total and today it says it's all over and I got a 70 cent credit? 
.what happened to my 17x $5 credit is was so near? Fucking scammed again. I guess it makes little difference since
If I used any credit the seller would just use that opportunity to ship a broken item knowing g that my return would cost me all my credits like last time I had $40 and got nothing for it.

when I was young my mom would just demand I give things having to do with my hobbies (music/art) to my sibling.

during things like Christmas or whatever she would give gifts that were for me (from other people) to any random little girl she was familiar with so that their families would like her.

if I use any type of makeup or skincare or perfume near her, she‚Äôll stare at it unless I offer to let her use it too. sometimes she‚Äôll flat out just ask incredulously why I didn‚Äôt buy her one. sometimes she‚Äôll ‚Äúborrow‚Äùthings and never give it back and when I do ask for it back her energy immeadietly switches to being very angry and irritated for no reason. 

in my case the narcissists aren‚Äôt just parents but also siblings. for the whole family, they‚Äôve always been very fixated on whatever food I was eating. if I got anything for myself at the store, it would times get stolen. even foods no one would want like a fruit cup. I‚Äôve never touched anyone else‚Äôs things, and they don‚Äôt do this to each other. it‚Äôs just me. it‚Äôs funny because if I were to get something and say it‚Äôs for everyone, they wouldn‚Äôt touch it, but if they can sense something is for me specifically they‚Äôll be obsessed with trying to find it and get to it.

A family member and I were in Lithopolis on 11/29/2024 at around 6 PM and had to about two hours to spend while waiting on someone. We found a coffee shop open late, ""Das KaffeeHaus Von Frau Burkhart."" As we approached, a man was standing outside the coffee shop (in 28 degree weather) excitedly trying to get my attention (at this point I was a passenger and we were just circling the block to find a parking space so I guess he was trying to flag down every car driving through town). He pointed to a sheet or poster he was holding and then he pointed across the street, where a restaurant, El Pedregal, is located; there may have been other businesses near it.

When we parked he hovered around our car and pretended to look at the windows of a Remax office while we sat in the car, and then some other people arrived and he said something at length to them, they said ""thank you,"" and he followed them inside the bar before leaving a minute later. At this point we finally went in the coffee shop, just as he crossed the street; when he saw us entering the coffee shop, he said something that sounded like loud anger or frustration that we'd gone in there.

I was very curious if there was some sort of story behind this; was he trying to poach customers from the other businesses? Do the businesses in town have some kind of grudge? If this was an attempt to drum up business, it definitely struck me as bizarre and rather creepy, and very nearly caused us to just avoid stopping in town at all.

You may want to get a hot beverage - it‚Äôs LONG.

I have been with my partner for 10 years. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs a narc, but he has some pretty toxic tendencies.  

Anyway, we used to live together 1/2 the time and then an epic blow out happened in  February and I stopped going there.  He said some very hurtful things and even asked for my best friend‚Äôs phone number because he thought they ‚Äúmight hit it off‚Äù.  

I also started looking to move on and possibly even move out of state.  I should add I am a recent ‚Äúempty nester‚Äù, my sons aged 21 and 23 live on their own and my empty house all of a sudden got very quiet and very lonely.  

As time went on, the pain of my loneliness became stronger than the pain of our fight and we started reengaging but not living together.  Kind of a FWB situation.  

I don‚Äôt want a FWB situation and last night I asked about moving back in and getting back to how we were before the February sh*tsh*w.  He was less than enthusiastic and I was hurt.  I asked how we might move in that direction but he said he was too tired to talk about it.  I asked when might be a better time - he didn‚Äôt know.  

He went to sleep at about 8:30 PM and I stayed up until close to Midnight.   This morning he tried to wake me up with some  ‚Äúfrisky activity‚Äù.  I told him I was tired, had been up late, and asked if he would go make me a cup of coffee.  A few sips of coffee and I‚Äôd be ‚Äúin the mood‚Äù.  He didn‚Äôt want to - too far to walk downstairs.  I asked if he‚Äôd get me a Diet Pepsi then - much less effort.  Nope.  Too hard for him.

So I went downstairs to make my own coffee.  Then I decided my feelings were hurt that he couldn‚Äôt be bothered to do something so minor for me.  

I went back upstairs, said my feelings were hurt and I was leaving.  Honestly:  I wanted him to apologize and go make the coffee, I didn‚Äôt want to leave.  

He got very upset, told me to get out and that he refuses to be manipulated.  Was I being manipulative?  Yes, I see that now.  I was ‚Äútesting‚Äù him and he failed.  I failed too.  

Why this ridiculous novel??  Because I don‚Äôt know what to do now.  I already apologized, I owned the manipulation and asked if I could bring us both a cup of coffee and we could try again.  Nope. He refused.  

So I left. I am sad and lonely and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm the problem or he is.  What would you do?  What do you see that I don‚Äôt?

I like to imagine a weekly bus ride for Peepaw where he munches on beef jerky, sips whiskey-laced coffee from a single-use cup, and happily listens to his own podcast with his earbuds in as the bus loops around Manhattan just to get away from La Casa de Chaos.
* [**November 2023 = 10 posts**](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/188frt5/november_2023_hilarias_ig_recap_10_posts_or_how/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) including a pic of Alec and Hilz at the Glamour Woman of the Year Awards. She‚Äôs been rocking the emaciated look for a hot minute.

[How is Alec's pained look every time she speaks going to come across on TLC?](https://preview.redd.it/0ajej5tmc64e1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8c4cf25f0450d0175fcab6b93bee3f1af3586a6)

**November Roundup**

* Hillary started by posting four stories about her cute kids in their Halloween costumes and not a peep about the [catastrophic flooding in Spain](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1gj2qs5/is_she_stepping_away_from_spain/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Since this was most likely caused by climate change, you‚Äôd think that Alec would post about it, but he was in election mode and posted a four-minute video about the importance of voting and democracy and doing one‚Äôs civic duty with a mashmillion family pictures in the background ‚Äì do these people have more pictures of themselves than most?

[For a wannabe auteur, Alec never gives a rip about the background of his goofy videos.](https://preview.redd.it/l9pfoydsc64e1.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa697dd0698964f845ca2d26ae9a6a40a11e4fd0)

* Quincy Jones died and of course it was an opportunity for Alec to make a rushed post followed by a more elaborate one on a different day gushing about how close they were. After writing so much he apparently had nothing left in his tank and reposted US Weekly‚Äôs story about Hillary‚Äôs purse without a caption.
* Hillary was very excited about her little Us Weekly story about her fortune cookie looking purse, so she made a story *and* a grid post about it. ¬øC√≥mo se dice ‚Äúmilking it‚Äù en ingl√©s? She threw in some pictures of her kids and their ~~hostages~~ pets for funsies.
*  On November 5^(th), Hillary made a typical influencer ‚Äúgo vote‚Äù post with a red heart (with a cameo from one of her new bewbs) and people pushed back bc they thought it was a coded partisan message, so she quickly made it an anemic heart. Aled reposted the image and avoided any hearts in any colors.

[But she‚Äôs a witch? Get one narrative right, Hilz, just one is all we ask.](https://preview.redd.it/2h24tfrzc64e1.png?width=686&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b27915dfd834f94053801dd0fc8205e27ba9385)

* What really got people up in arms was the Spanish Caravaca cross Hillary was wearing. This particular version of the cross is supposed to ward off evil and bring good fortune as well as impart a sense of tranquility. Best of luck with that, Hilz.
* Alec posted a black square on his grid post-election and Hillary was bopping around town happy as a clam with her ridiculously large implants leading the way. I appreciate how the [Daily Mail headline used ‚Äúsurprisingly perky cleavage‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1glepjh/tetas_wednesday/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) but then the story snuck in ‚Äúsuspiciously perky cleavage‚Äù and compared a picture of her from 2021 and now, noting *‚Äúher ample assets have become unusually rounded at the top‚Äù* ‚Äì really no need for so much mystery. The woman got bigger implants and wants them to be admired.

[I laughed out loud at this comment from u\/purplefuzz22: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm honestly surprised that her balloon boobs aren‚Äôt just floating her down the street. Like think of the house from ‚ÄúUP‚Äù but only 2 balloons and her floating down the street like she is resurrecting.‚Äù](https://preview.redd.it/doqo5y65d64e1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa6b6bb68f05b71e9a94c928acf5c98d56940f7d)



* She covered up a bit for a [pap stroll](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1gmo9n1/ugh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) with Alec and their youngest.

[Please remember these single use cups as you keep reading.](https://preview.redd.it/1vuu9dgad64e1.png?width=544&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8414e55174cd18cfe4fa79037f9518101c9c2b6)

* Alec posted about taking the train to Pennsylvania to attend Monster Con and I hope the people who paid $135 to take with him felt they got their money‚Äôs worth! ¬†

[There are not enough red bracelets to fix his negative energy. ](https://preview.redd.it/da5gkmopd64e1.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=2877c58a226e79f1e600bc2825147a80f68ddcf2)

* Alec posted a video of little Ilaria sliding headfirst down a slide set to Cyndi Lauper‚Äôs ‚ÄúGirls Just Wanna Have Fun‚Äù and he rilly, rilly should have stopped there. But no. In typical PeePaw fashion he messed up and proceeded to make it worse with the next post.¬†
* On US Veteran‚Äôs Day (November 11^(th)), Alec could have posted a picture of his late father ‚Äì a proud Marine. Or he could have shouted out actors who have served their country like Morgan Freeman, Sydney Poitier, or Chuck Norris. Instead, Alec chose an [image of actor Kevin Bacon from a 2009 HBO movie called ‚ÄúTaking Chance.‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1gps9db/is_kevin_bacon_a_veteran_included_a_sample_of_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Bacon never served in the military and people in Alec‚Äôs comments called him out for using this image. The logical thing would have been to apologize along the lines of ‚ÄúI saw the image and didn‚Äôt realize it was from a movie, my apologies, here‚Äôs an image of a real vet.‚Äù Sigh, if only. What Sir Rage-a-Lot chose instead was to add to a ‚ÄúPS‚Äù to his caption complaining about ‚Äúthe haters.‚Äù

[The comments doing the Lord's work. ](https://preview.redd.it/ret3ow9xd64e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=96f1cddae8ea507d981862546c2cac78d14df8dd)

* That evening, [Hillary and Alec took their kids to the premiere of Spellbound](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1gph4bf/alec_baldwin_and_wife_hilaria_bring_six_of_their/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), an animated musical movie. In every published picture, Hillary is carrying one of the younger three. You know those people with multiple piercings (or bright blue hair, or many tattoos, etc.) who can‚Äôt resist saying ‚Äúwell, I‚Äôm just weird, look at all my piercings/tattoos/blue hair?‚Äù That is Hillary ‚Äì being a mother of 7 is her whole personality that she must broadcast that no matter what.

[I am BITTER that the awesome Javier Bardem was pictured with them, but I hope he had a giggle when he told Penelope about it.](https://preview.redd.it/j596q614e64e1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=9413aec95251e976b3bcc2720982f7cd8e46b0bc)

* While on the red carpet, [Alec was asked how the reality show](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1gphcwa/alec_baldwin_already_not_liking_his_new_reality/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) is going and he responded *‚Äúit‚Äôs coming out in January, I think.‚Äù* The follow up was: *‚Äúhow was it being on camera with no lines?‚Äù* (did Hillary write this question?). A little voice, maybe Rafael, chimed in *‚Äúwe haven‚Äôt done it in a while‚Äù* while Alec responded *‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt very fond of it, actually. Tell me what to do.‚Äù*
* Outside the venue he did [some weird bit trying to get a sweet Irish tourist to respond to some question about Lorne Green](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1gpq3nz/oh_boy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and I sincerely wish her NYC celebrity moment wasn‚Äôt with this dunderhead.
* According to online magazine Westside Current, ‚Äú[Alec Baldwin and his company El Dorado Pictures want a judge to re-impose a stay on a civil suit](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1gqid6v/alec_baldwin_seeks_renewed_stay_of_rust_crew/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) filed by a ""Rust"" crew member.‚Äù Basically Serge Svetnoy (crew member and Halyna‚Äôs friend) filed a civil suit that was stayed/paused while Alec was on trial at Alec‚Äôs lawyers‚Äô request. Now that the trial has been dismissed, Svetnoy wants to continue but Alec‚Äôs team wants another stay because the prosecutor is appealing the dismissal. My takeaway is that Alec is still paying his slimy layers BIG money to keep dodging justice.
* Hillary posted [a story of Edu and Marilu and a little Christmas tree](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1gqvjwj/theres_so_much_to_unpack_w_this_pic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), but most people‚Äôs eyes were drawn to the many, many pictures covering the walls.

[Per u\/RazzmatazzBig2187 ‚ÄúWho has a wall full of family faces on the kid‚Äôs bedroom walls ?!? What about a Paw Patrol poster or some other kid characters?!?‚Äù](https://preview.redd.it/gthm983ae64e1.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=a49d9245a17c90fdd1719efc1d9fe2a74a6de1ec)

* Maybe it‚Äôs bc we all now have advanced degrees in ‚ÄúHilaria‚Äù Baldwin vacuity, but you can really tell when she thinks she‚Äôs doing something spicy (cue flamenco guitars); like when she makes a grid post a story (because she wants the most views possible). Case in point: [allegedly one of the older kids sent her a text and Hillary responded thusly](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1grw3oq/what_woman_that_actually_birthed_kids_says_this/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button):

[The grid caption from Hillary is ‚ÄúSaving this here so it‚Äôs at your fingertips if you ever need to use it üéâ. Works in our home! pregnancy is hard work‚Äîthey should make good use out of the limbs we made ü§£.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/wndm7p8ke64e1.png?width=493&format=png&auto=webp&s=6579895706a75218363e0a247b3837f9642686f2)

* People magazine ran a story on this, I kid you not. Also, if this is real, I love that‚Äôs it‚Äôs ‚Äúmom‚Äù and if it‚Äôs fake/staged I love that she forgot to make it ‚Äúmami.‚Äù
* Maybe this was premeditated but the same day Hilz was posting this silly (probably made-up) exchange, she and Alec attended the premiere of Elton John‚Äôs Broadway musical ‚ÄúTammy Faye.‚Äù Where to begin? Alec‚Äôs grease-stained shirt? Hillary‚Äôs horrendous Bratz outfit (but it‚Äôs size 00 you fat boollies)? The gigantic implants? The tiny skirt? The fact that the reliably confusing Daily Mail described her look as *‚Äúa light face of makeup that accentuated her features ‚Äî her big, brown eyes and full pout‚Äù?*¬†

[I tore my ACL running to the comments here when I saw this.](https://preview.redd.it/ldxao5moe64e1.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c5740b7f367a9462fa9aef51e01427dc49643dd)

¬†

* I mean, why ask why at this point, but why is Hillary wearing a power suit for a kid‚Äôs movie and then a leftover Halloween Spirit sexy schoolgirl costume to a Broadway show?

[¬øPor qu√©?](https://preview.redd.it/jw3eth5se64e1.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=742218c04657b604fbe4c0ab37d3db3f782f3ade)

¬†

* ¬†Hillary started Saturday with a very cute picture story of Ilaria in sunnies and a faux fur-lined little jacket, but Alec had his own plans: he appeared on SNL as Robert Kennedy Jr. Bad move ‚Äì Kennedy has a medical condition called spasmodic dysphonia which is why his voice sounds strained and shaky and Alec was basically making fun of it. Beyond that it was a poor impression (*and* he flubbed his lines) so now we‚Äôre automatically comparing Alec‚Äôs previous successful impressions to this sloppy one. However, this is small potatoes considering what happened next
* During the famous SNL outro where all the actors are on stage, Alec was front and center with his fly completely open. Seriously, WHO is doing his PR? If he had posted a brief self-deprecating ‚Äúoops‚Äù video or picture on Sunday, it would have gone a loooong way at mitigating the bad press this generated.

[Why do the bulging pockets make this worse? ](https://preview.redd.it/8vadhggze64e1.png?width=998&format=png&auto=webp&s=a223387cdfbae98f8044b0700ec5a206437df4c5)



* ¬†Hillary then got busy posting a short video (probably taken by a nanny) of [one of the older boys skipping up some steps in the subway](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1gup9g3/yawn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) with the caption ‚ÄúNYC kid.‚Äù 

[No Hillary, he and his siblings are ‚Äútiny, bewildered satellites‚Äù to borrow the wise words of pepino u\/AffectionatePoet4586.](https://preview.redd.it/4gzrsjw6f64e1.png?width=295&format=png&auto=webp&s=3eed4eb35c9f6f47ce514b735875e81986f73ec0)



* ¬†After Alec embarrassed himself on national television, ‚ÄúRust‚Äù was premiering at the Camerimage Film Festival in Poland. The Hollywood Reporter (11/16/24) asked the festival‚Äôs assistant director *‚ÄúCan you tell us about the decision to premiere Rust? It has generated a mixed response among international cinematographers.‚Äù* ¬†He responded:
   * *Yes, I know it has become divisive. Some felt we were doing it for promotional reasons and that it was inappropriate to screen a film that resulted in a death. But for us, the motivation was very simple. Halyna had a strong connection to this festival. She attended several times. And we were contacted by her friends, who told us that before shooting even began on Rust, she told them that the film was very important to her and it was her dream to screen it at Camerimage. So the screening is only about that: fulfilling her wish of showing her film at the festival. Halyna‚Äôs mother, who is Ukrainian, is going to attend the screening if she‚Äôs able to leave her country, but it‚Äôs not easy right now because of the war. Some have suggested we are holding this screening simply to generate attention for the festival, but we don‚Äôt need that kind of attention. We didn‚Äôt invite Alec Baldwin, and we never considered doing so. That would be too distracting. What this is about is honoring Halyna‚Äôs dreams for her work.*
* Actually, Halyna‚Äôs mother, [Olga Solovey, did not attend](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1gvaw4l/halyna_hutchins_mother_to_skip_rust_camerimage/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) stating that: *‚ÄúAlec Baldwin continues to increase my pain with his refusal to apologize to me and his refusal to take responsibility for her death. Instead, he seeks to unjustly profit from his killing of my daughter. That is the reason why I refuse to attend the festival for the promotion of Rust, especially now when there is still no justice for my daughter‚Äù* (The Hollywood Reporter, 11/19/24).
* The same day Rust premiered Alec took a leisurely solo pap walk. Look. I know Alec and Hilz can and should live their lives and walk around their neighborhood doing fuck all but was it really necessary to show his face on the very day Rust was being screened? ¬†At least the pap gave us an image that captured his inner ugliness seeping out.

[He couldn't have run this errand the day after the premiere? ](https://preview.redd.it/9ch8xloef64e1.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=53232510cd2e9ea017728522375e5dd7548c8eb0)

¬†

* The day after Rust screened Alec posted about his great love: Alec Baldwin, Serious Actor. TV show ‚ÄúLiving the Creative Life‚Äù profiled him, and he clearly wanted to remind people that he is A Big Deal. He also reposted a picture he posted on his grid in June that is the definition of chaos: [Hillary fake emoting/sleeping](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1gwv7mt/give_u_uno_chance_2_guess_who_posted_this_hint/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) while showcasing her horrid eyebrows/eyelashes, bits of fried hair, and painfully stretched neck while holding sad baby Ila with clutter in the background

* Of course he posted a portrait of JFK on the [61^(st) anniversary of his assassination](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1gxlzpp/i_knew_hed_post_about_this/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) with music from ‚ÄúThe Last Samurai.‚Äù Alec really does fancy¬† himself a Kennedy which is equal parts laughable and understandable.
* [The Daily Mail gave us a really solid headline and story](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1gxv70r/alec_baldwin_brazenly_using_family_2_resurrect/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) about how Alec is trying to monetize his family with a cheesy reality show but has never deigned to apologize to Halyna Hutchins‚Äô parents and sister. Great pick, TLC.

[A travesty.](https://preview.redd.it/tfwjj2c2g64e1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=4db984ec2b5b3cc84bc4aeb7f93897fd05f19451)

* On November 25th [Alec spoke at the Torino Film Festival](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1gzoyfp/heres_the_entire_hollywood_reporter_article/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) as he received a lifetime achievement award and basically confirmed that he is entitled, self-absorbed, and a misogynist to boot. Please note, the film they screened to illustrate his achievements as an actor was made in 1990, which was, y‚Äôknow, 34 YEARS AGO.
* His speech included the following fuckery:
   * *‚ÄúYou know what‚Äôs going on from the news, but information in America is driven by money. It‚Äôs a business, that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a void in information on the biggest issues in the world.* ***Americans know little or nothing*** *‚Äî on climate change, on Ukraine. That void is filled in part by the film industry, by documentaries and narrative films.‚Äù* **Kudos to** u/_TalkingIsHard_ **who noted** ***‚ÄúNothing says worldly like believing your wife is from Spain because she used a terrible fake accent.‚Äù***
   * *‚ÄúThere are many challenges to face: the environment,* ***the problem of plastic,*** *of permafrost: There are plastic molecules in every corner of the planet. These are the real problems to solve.‚Äù* u/_portia_ **encapsulated the issue perfectly:** ***‚ÄúThe problem is plastic... you hypocrite, you who have a plastic-topped disposable fucking coffee cup every day! And how many plastic diapers have you contributed to the landfill, asshole?! And of course, the plastic in your wife's tits that you paid for, you gonna recycle those things? This pendejo!‚Äù***
   * When asked about the importance of women directing films he replied, *‚ÄúIn the cinema of the ‚Äô80s and ‚Äô90s, out of 100 directors there were 98 men and two women,‚Äù he replies. ‚ÄúNow, it‚Äôs not like that, and that‚Äôs a good thing. Of course,* ***for some films you need an energetic director who moves the camera continuously and maybe a male director is better****: But for a comedy or a drama with a lot of talk, what‚Äôs the difference between a male director and a female director? In fact, there‚Äôs more introspective capacity in a female director.‚Äù* This man has four daughters and a granddaughter and believes women have the capacity to be introspective but not energetic. Ho. Lee. Shit.
   * He continued, *‚ÄúI recommend a film and a book. The book is called Black Box, written by a Japanese journalist who was raped and wrote about it in her book, which reveals the sexism in Japanese society. Then, she made a film from that book, Black Box Diaries.‚Äù* This **energetic and introspective director is named Shiori It≈ç,** but we wouldn‚Äôt know that from listening to Alec bloviate.
* ¬†As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, this dumbass [made it worse by talking with Variety](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1gztwxo/oh_fck_off/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) after the press conference and saying, in part:
   * **It‚Äôs all about his wife (anything to avoid saying her ridiculous name):** *‚ÄúThis is obviously the most difficult thing I‚Äôve ever dealt with in my life. Beyond the victims themselves, the thing that most pains me is what it did to my wife.* ***My wife has been very, very traumatized from this****. There has been a lot of pain. When you are married to somebody and everything was going fairly well and we had seven kids ‚Ä¶ and the floor falls out. It‚Äôs very frightening and very disturbing. And we are trying to get the wind in our sails, to get away from this stuff.‚Äù*
   * **Ah, Alec is a selfless victim ‚Äì how did we not see this?** ‚Äú*In order to finish the film ‚Äî and this is the only thing I can say about it because I have another pending \[civil\] case ‚Äî we traveled to Montana. All my doctors told me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go‚Äù ‚Äî mental health practitioners, cardiologists. I mean,* ***I was very sick afterwards for a while, physically drained and ill. But I went****‚Äù*
   * **Cancel culture is the problem:** *‚ÄúYou know, in the cancel culture you get worried about doing something wrong‚Ä¶****You are always mindful whatever you do in the United States these days, because you are going to get into trouble****.‚Äù*
* ¬†Like (very slow and malfunctioning) clockwork, Hillary or one of the kids gets ‚Äúinjured‚Äù whenever Alec is out of town. This time she put on an emotional support walking boot cast to have her [paid moment with her paid pap](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1gzrn0x/old_pepinos_remember_when_she_wasnt_getting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), Elder Ordo√±ez, who recorded her walking, and said *‚Äúgracias, Hilaria‚Äù* as she walked by, and hilarity ensued in his comments:
   * *Lmao. You could have just spoken English to her. She isn‚Äôt really Spanish.*
   * *How much notice does she give when she calls you?*
   * *Hillary\**
   * *Is she the one with 9 kids?*
   * *Why would anyone be jealous of her? She's married to an angry alcoholic killer, and she pretended to be Spanish for a decade and has 48 kids she can't properly care for. Yea we're jealous üôÑüôÑüôÑ*
   * *She goes through a dozen single use coffee cups a day. That‚Äôs odd for a self-proclaimed environmentalist. But what do I know? Maybe that‚Äôs how they practice environmentalism in Ethpa√±a.*

* The brilliant final word for this catastrophic month is from u/Alternative-Bird-589 who astutely observed that Hillary is ***‚Äúa prop for \[Alec\] as much as those kids are. He doesn‚Äôt care what the reality is, he likes to talk about ‚Äúhis wife‚Äù, the prop to whom he gives all these magical qualities she doesn‚Äôt possess.‚Äù***",13,1733034052.0,HilariaBaldwin,4,0.89,False

1h3wz0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1h3wz0w/does_anyone_else_experience_joint_pain_and/,Does anyone else experience joint pain and general malaise after ending your fast?,"I‚Äôm trying ADF, but I feel like it may not be for me. The fasting 36 hours isn‚Äôt even the problem. I feel fine *during* the fast. Once I start eating, I feel tired and weird. Just lacking energy and my joints hurt to the core. I‚Äôm 33F so I don‚Äôt really think this is age related but it may be helpful info. 

Based on what I‚Äôm eating on a typical day, does this seem related to how I‚Äôm nourishing myself? Take today as an example of my feeding day after a 36 hour fast: 

Breakfast
-3 eggs, scrambled with a pinch of shredded cheddar cheese

Snacks
-Premier vanilla protein milk (30g protein). 

-2 handfuls of assorted nuts (macadamia, hazelnuts, pecans).

-1 guava 

Lunch
-Mixed veggies (steamed broccoli/carrots/cabbage) 

-Cup of white rice 

-Chicken and steak teriyaki

Other-
cold brew coffee with vanilla creamer

The snacks and breakfast are generally the same each day, and the coffee. The only thing that varies is lunch. I try to make a protein with veggies. I typically have one fruit like a banana. I‚Äôm not counting calories or macros right now. Im bummed that ADF may be too hard for me, but I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone can see where I‚Äôm going wrong with my eating habits. 

Im willing to go back to doing 18:6 or 19:5 if it means staying healthy. I don‚Äôt want to lose muscle mass or hair, and especially my period. And i feel awful with the joint pain which makes me believe I‚Äôm deficient in something with my meals. ",3,1733033823.0,fasting,3,1.0,False
