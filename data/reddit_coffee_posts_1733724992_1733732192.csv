1ha4x54,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusinessEnglishPro/comments/1ha4x54/making_small_talk_at_work/,Making small talk at work,"When you’ve worked with someone for a while, making small talk can feel easier, but it’s still important to be mindful of cultural differences and individual preferences. 



Here's how to approach small talk with people you already know, while keeping cultural awareness in mind:



**Start with Shared Experiences** 

If you already know someone, you can mention a recent project, a mutual hobby, or something work-related. 

You can say something like:

* ""Hey, how’s the new project going? I know you were excited about it when we chatted last week.""
* ""Did you end up seeing that show you mentioned yesterday?""



**Adjust Based on Personality** 

If your colleague or client is more reserved or introverted, don’t ask very personal questions. Stick to neutral topics like work progress, weekend plans, or their opinions on non-controversial topics. 

Example for a reserved person:

* ""I heard there’s a new café nearby. Have you had a chance to check it out?""



For more outgoing colleagues, you can be a bit more relaxed and even add humor.  

Example for an outgoing person:

* ""I saw you posting photos from your trip over the weekend! Did you survive the adventure?""



**Be sensitive of cultural differences** 

Some topics might be off-limits depending on the culture. 

* In many indirect and reserved cultures, work-related small talk is common and seen as professional, while personal questions (family, relationships) can feel intrusive.
* In more direct or open cultures, people might be more open to sharing personal stories, but always take cues from the other person’s reactions.

See some examples:

* **For a Western colleague/client:** ""How’s your family doing? Any fun weekend plans?""
* **For an East Asian colleague/client:** ""How’s the workload lately? Hope you’re not too swamped!""

1ha4wwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/mongolia/comments/1ha4wwt/question_for_mongolian_men_only_should_i_reach/,Question for Mongolian Men Only: Should I Reach Out to Him Again?,"Hi everyone, I have a question specifically for Mongolian men, and I’d really appreciate your honest advice.

So, I’ve had a crush on this guy since 2018. Back then, I finally mustered the courage to ask him out for coffee before going abroad to study. He said he wanted to meet me too, but he told me he was in the military (""дүйцүүлэх алба""), which I didn’t know about at the time. Because of that, we couldn’t meet. I was a bit skeptical since I didn’t know people could use their phones while in the military, but my guy friend explained that it’s a thing. Anyway, I left to study abroad and didn’t follow up.

Fast forward to now—I’m back and I’d really like to meet him again. But I’m not sure if it’s a good idea to reach out after so long.

Here are my questions:

1. Should I hit him up again after all this time?
2. What would you think if a girl you hadn’t heard from in three years suddenly texted you to meet up?

Bonus question: When I asked my guy friend about this, he joked that if a girl asked him out, he’d instantly assume she wanted to ""suck his D."" I know he’s being sarcastic, but do guys actually think like that when a girl makes the first move? 😅

I’d love to hear your thoughts! Thank you in advance for your advice.",4,1733731258.0,mongolia,3,1.0,False

We're arriving in Puerto Natales the day before our trek and are doing the W over 4 nights, staying in pre-set tents at the refugios. I had a few logistical questions I was hoping for help with:

1. Luggage storage in Puerto Natales: Since I’ll be staying at an Airbnb, I won’t have access to hostel storage. Are there any places in town (e.g., storage services, or businesses that offer this) where I can safely store luggage while hiking?
2. Food at the Refugios: When I was booking, the dinner/half/full board options were already sold out. I’ve heard it’s often possible to buy dinner directly at the restaurants. Is this always the case? If the restaurant is full, is there any backup option (e.g., lighter meals, ramen)?
3. Grocery stores in Puerto Natales: We do a decent amount of backpacking in the states and are accustom to bringing breakfast/lunch for the trail (e.g. instant coffee, instant oats & apples, peanut butter, tortillas for simple lunch). I assume this is available, but want to confirm

Food is the only area we haven't fully covered, so would appreciate any general advice or other tips on keeping costs down

1ha4vcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/biggboss/comments/1ha4vcg/my_opinion_about_contestants_up_till_now/,My opinion about contestants up till now ,"Karan

Initially, Karan was one of my favorites for his sarcastic comments and laid-back attitude. He seemed like a fun, chill guy to watch. However, he spent most of the season playing the victim card, often unnecessarily picking fights and coming across as toxic at times. After the last WKV episode, where he was praised, he’s become overly confident and seems to thrive on validation. This sudden shift in behavior makes him hard to connect with now.

Vivian

Vivian comes across as a mature and composed individual but is extremely self-centered, especially when it comes to things like his work or even his coffee. While he avoids unnecessary conflicts and seems like a decent person, his lack of engagement and low involvement in house drama make him a less impactful contestant for Big Boss.

Avinash

Avinash has a dual personality: an aggressive side and a funny, entertaining side. Personally, I prefer the funny side, but there’s a noticeable lack of balance. His aggression can overshadow his humor, and I wish he would lean more into the lighter side of his personality.

Rajat

While Rajat’s gameplay has been decent, his criminal background makes it difficult for me to support him. This overshadows any positive impressions he might make in the house.

Shilpa Kaki

Shilpa remains an enigma for me. At times, she seems completely lost, and at others, she appears too clever for her own good. It’s hard to pinpoint her real strategy or intentions in the game.

Chum

Jhum has been largely non-existent in the house except for the “chumveer ship,” which feels directionless. Early on, Karan seemed interested in creating a love angle with her, likely for gameplay purposes, but now that he’s become one of the most talked-about contestants, his interest seems to have waned. On the other hand, Jhum occasionally appears to want that angle to work.

Eisha

I have a love-hate relationship with Isha. At times, she’s extremely irritating, but I also enjoy her “evil Eisha” persona. 


 
Chahat Pandey 

She used to be my guilty pleasure, but now I find her more frustrating. Still, the “Bhajanti Pandya” tag suits her perfectly.

Digvijay

I really don’t understand him.Time God” phase, it was clear he was heavily influenced by Karan. The idea of punishing housemates for not performing tasks wasn’t even his own—it came from Karan. Fans call him a mastermind, but I’ve yet to see that side of him. He also gets easily instigated, which undermines his game",0,1733731069.0,biggboss,2,0.5,False

The other person uses an iPhone 13 mini and experiences no heating or lag issues, but my phone could be used as a fusion reactor. Ok in real terms though it gets as hot as a cup of freshly poured coffee, so still relatively hot. When I call on other apps like WhatsApp for video calls, it doesn’t seem to overheat or have issues. I’ve had this phone for about 8ish months now and I never seemed to have any other problems with it, and I’ve noticed that the issues started arising after iOS 18 came along.

Since integ to formal review, consistent ako nasa high rankings, upper top 100 ako palagi. Before magstart ang exam, wala akong kaba na nararamdaman. Sure pass na ang mindset ko and for formality nalang ang boards sakin. Day 1 to Day 2, kabado ako pero feeling ko pasado pa rin. Pagkatapos ng Day 2, medyo nakahinga na ko ng maluwag kasi Day 3 is my strongest day. Maraming nahihirapan sa FAR and AFAR pero ito lagi highest ko sa PB, never bumaba ng 60+ scores ko dito.

Kahit na confident ako sa Day 3, ayoko magpachill nalang. Naisip ko na last day na rin to review eh, sulitin ko na. Nilaan ko talaga na late ko babalikan yung SME para fresh pa sakin, kaso 9pm palang inaantok agad ako. Naisipan kong magkape and pwede ako magtimpla ng 3-in-1 or purong kape pero ewan ko ba, naisipan ko itry yung Lucky Day. Tbh, di ko alam ang background ng kape na to, nasa isip ko ay normal na kape lang, harmless kumbaga. Uminom ako and so far, okay naman sya. Natapos ako magreview ng 11pm and matutulog na sana. Humiga ako sa kama, naeexcite sa exam hanggang sa alas tres na pala at di pa ko nakakatulog. Medyo nag aalala na ko, triny ko best ko para makatulog pero umabot na ng 5am at gising pa ko. Nagstart na ko mag asikaso hanggang nakarating ako sa testing site ng walang tulog.

Nasa room na ko, gising na gising. Okay lang to, di ba? Pabor nga na gising na gising ako e. Akala ko okay na not until nagstart na ko magsagot ng FAR. 30mins palang ako nagsasagot pero parang nagshutdown utak ko. 2 sentences na pagbabasa, di ko sya magets. Pag long paragraph, kada nasa kalagitnaan na ko ay makakalimutan ko ano yung mga binasa ko at magfrom the start na naman. Kinurot, hinampas, at pinitik ko na tenga ko dahil kailangan ko magising at makapagfocus. Sobrang lutang ko to the point na may mga tanong sa papel ko na may bilog na ang sagot pero di ko maalalang sinolve ko and nung nirecompute ko, mali yung mga nakabilog. Gusto ko nang umiyak, 10 months of review na baka masayang lang. Swerte ko at nagkick yung adrenaline ko noong nagsabi yung proctor ng ""1 hour left"" kaso 30 items pa wala akong sagot. Aware naman tayo lahat gano katime consuming ang FAR. Swerte ko na kada sagot ko ay nakukuha ko agad. 10 mins nalang at may walo pa kong walang sagot pero nagstart na ko magshade. Natapos ako magshade at 2 mins nalang so nagshot gun na ko. Di rin ako confident sa mga una kong sagot kasi lutang ako nung sinosolve ko yon. Nakatulog ako nung lunch kaya okay naman ako sa AFAR pero sa FAR medyo delikado talaga.

Hindi ko matanggap mangyari sakin if magcocondi ako sa strongest sub ko dahil sa kape. 10 months of excellence na masisira ng lucky day. So ironic na ang worst day of my CPA Journey ay dahil sa kape na named Lucky Day. ",8,1733730454.0,AccountingPH,5,0.9,False

At the time, I was too creeped out by parts of the game to really play it, but now, I want to try and properly explore it.

Platform: Mobile. Maybe it was on IOS as well, but I played it on an Android, which was all I had back then.

Genre: First Person Sandbox Survival

Estimated Year of Release: 2016 to 2019. Can't have been later than 2019. It could have released a year or two before 2016, but I think it was still somewhat being updated at the time I played it, which I estimate was 2017. It was kind of your typical ""early access"" knockoff mobile survival game from that era.

Graphics/Art Style: Look at Ocean Is Home: Survival Island (not Island Life) by Birdy Dog Studio (particularly versions from I think before 2019). It was literally that, in terms of graphics, gameplay, mechanics, sound effects and assets, everything, except for its map and setting, which was in a large but contained space sealed off by the walls from Maze Runner, complete with gates that only open at certain times of day. The ""maze"" parts themselves though kinda sucked. It was a bunch of cubes of differing size (some floating I think) in large corridors probably intended for some sort of ""parkour."" However, there were some locked doors which required keycards to open, which led to enclosed, poorly lit areas with zombies in them. This was the part I mentioned that creeped me out.

Notable Characters: There were no actual characters in the game to my knowledge, or even NPCs, but just like Ocean Is Home, it had rabbits, deer, foxes, boars, and maybe bears that you could hunt for materials such as meat, fat, and cloth. And once you explore those certain areas, zombies, which seemed to have a chance of dropping a pistol and/or ammo.

Notable Gameplay Mechanics: Again, look at Ocean Is Home: Survival Island. But for the sake of clarity, I'll explain here: You could hit trees and break rocks to get materials such as wood, stone, metal, and such, (and like I said before, hunt animals) to make tools/weapons and building parts such as foundations, walls, ceilings, stairs, and so forth. Also exactly like Ocean Is Home was its hunger, thirst, and energy stats/mechanics. Hunger and thirst work as you'd expect; eat canned food or meat from animals; drink bottles of water you find in some kind of supply crates in the map. The interesting (and really I mean annoying) one is the energy mechanic. You start out with full (100) energy, and it would slowly deplete as you play. It could be refilled by ""sleeping"" and not playing game for a while, or using coffee. If you run out of energy, you're forced to either quit the game until it refills, or spend real money to refill your energy/buy coffee.

Other Details: While I cannot for the life of me remember the name of the game, or find it on my own, my memories of it are very clear. Show me a screenshot or something and I can say for certain whether or not that is it. And as I've said several times already: if you need to get an idea of what it's like; just look at Ocean Is Home: Survival Island. It's basically exactly that game, same engine, assets/models and all, just in a different setting/map.",1,1733730416.0,tipofmyjoystick,0,1.0,False

1ha4ojb,https://www.reddit.com/r/complainaboutanything/comments/1ha4ojb/someone_is_so_annoying/,Someone is so annoying,"I just want to complain about this guy who I met at a recreational gym class. I am a 40 year old woman and he is a 57 divorced guy who has 3 adult children, in our group there is another woman who is 62. The three of us met at a gym class, and last month we started doing weekly hikes together. I'm always looking for people to exercise with so I was quite happy to be friends with them at first. We started a group chat to schedule our weekly hikes and he is overly passionate to the point where I feel so annoyed. (Disclaimer: He is a nice person so I have chosen not to say anything to him and I do not think he is trying to date me, he just has low self confidence and no friends, but at the same time he is getting too personal it feels really uncomfortable.) He often texts the group chat when he is waking up telling us he woke up, and telling us how he slept and asks us how he slept, when he goes to sleep he texts us that he is going to bed, when we are busy and we don't reply to his texts he texts us if we still asleep and if I still don't reply he facetimes me.

What really got me annoyed is that he loves to make jokes regarding race. At first I got kinda mad and I really wanted to tell him off (I'm not afraid to tell him off but this guy is truly clueless and I really truly do not think he understands at all, even if I explained to him it would be a waste of my effort). I am asian (born and raised in the US) and so is the other woman and this guy is white. The other day we went on a hike after class (just him and me) and he thought he was really funny telling me that it's ok to use the n word if you are friends with black people. I said no it is not, he thought he was so funny and said no its ok blah blah blah. I said no it's not ok at all and then explain. He didn't listen to me at all or understand. Then we were walking around the area and there was a property that says no trespassing, private property. Then he proceeds to walk in and says let me show you the ""american way"" you are Asian (he meant it as in Asians are usually more polite and reserved). At that moment I was so annoyed with what he said with the n word I wasn't really thinking and when I got home I felt quite annoyed with that comment. What does that mean, so Asians born in the US, and have lived their entire lives in the US are not American?

Everytime we hang out he constantly asks us about Asian culture, and Asian countries, to the point it's actually really offensive. Not because I don't like my heritage but for example we went to an Asian restaurant that did not have any Asian decor, just regular decor, and he asked us what is the meaning behind this decor was as Asians love to have things with symbolic meaning behind them. I told him it has no meaning, he asks the other Asian woman in our group, she replies the same. The next time me, him and another Asian woman from our gym class go to that restaurant he asks again. But it'll be nonstop, so if we go on a hike, from driving there, to the hike to lunch, to driving back, to getting coffee, he'll constantly ask us about the communist government or whatever but none of us have ever lived there before.

He'll ask me about something about China and after I respond to him, he'll tease me for it, at first I was like whatever, then the next day he'll tease me again and then a third time another day. It's exhausting and annoying. He really truly thinks he's so hilarious and somehow thinks that I enjoy his jokes when I actually think it's racist and offensive, but when I calm down I really don't think he understands at all, he just thinks he's being funny and that he's making jokes and having fun with everyone.

I got so annoyed of him I wanted to call him out but the gym class is ending this week and because he has self esteem issues and the other older woman seems to be having fun with him I didn't want to say anything. It's just has gotten so annoying, he also is very into Christianity and loves to text us how much he loves us. Since class is ending he also asked me multiple times to visit him near where he lives which is 2 1/2 hours away to have ice cream with him. ( I mentioned before that I liked that ice cream shop). NO WAY. Why would I drive 2 1/2 hours just to have ice cream with him just the two of us? And he would text the group chat that he loves us in such a sentimental, it's just makes me so uncomfortable cause we just met at the gym the last few months and just started hanging out a few weeks ago, we are not BFF's. It's just started to feel so uncomfortable and he is annoying me so much. I just wrote this to get this off my chest, I don't like being mean to people, especially when I don't think he had any ill intentions but it's just gotten so annoying that it feels like he's being in my personal space. Btw, his ex wife and his ex gf's were all Asians, which also makes me feel weird, especially b/c if you were married to someone that's not white before wouldn't you be more conscious about racial topics?

1ha4o22,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1ha4o22/how_to_mix_and_match_furniture_styles_for_a/,How to Mix and Match Furniture Styles for a Cohesive Look,"Creating a home that reflects your personality often means blending different [furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) styles. Whether you're drawn to the timeless charm of [natural furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) or the sleek sophistication of [modern furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture), combining styles can feel like an art. With the right approach, you can design a home that feels harmonious and intentional, even when your [house furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) comes from a mix of aesthetics.

Here’s how to mix and match furniture styles like a pro while achieving a cohesive look.

**1. Start with a Consistent Color Palette**

A cohesive color palette is the foundation for seamlessly blending different furniture styles. Choose 2-3 main colors and 1-2 accent colors that complement each other. For example, a room featuring natural furniture in warm wood tones can be beautifully paired with modern furniture in neutral shades like gray or white.

Pro Tip: Use accessories like rugs, throw pillows, or wall art to tie the colors together.

**2. Balance Proportions and Scale**

When mixing furniture styles, consider the scale and proportions of your pieces. A large, overstuffed sofa pairs well with a streamlined modern coffee table, creating visual balance. Avoid placing oversized house furniture next to dainty pieces without incorporating a unifying element, like a rug or lighting fixture, to bridge the gap.

**3. Unify Through Materials**

Integrating similar materials is an excellent way to create harmony between diverse furniture styles. For instance, pairing natural furniture made of rattan or reclaimed wood with modern furniture featuring glass or metal accents creates an interesting yet cohesive mix.

Pro Tip: Use textiles like linen curtains or woven throws to soften transitions between different styles.

**4. Highlight a Statement Piece**

Choose one standout piece to anchor the room, such as a bold modern sofa or a vintage wooden dining table. This piece becomes the focal point, allowing the rest of the furniture to support it. By giving your statement piece center stage, you can mix supporting styles without overwhelming the space.

**5. Incorporate Repetition**

Repetition is a design principle that brings order to a space. Repeat certain shapes, materials, or colors throughout the room. For instance, if you’re using natural furniture, repeat its wood tone in other areas, such as in picture frames or shelves. This repetition creates continuity, even when different styles are in play.

**6. Use Neutral Furniture as a Bridge**

Neutral-toned house furniture can act as a bridge between bold or contrasting styles. A neutral couch, for example, works well with both an eclectic accent chair and a modern coffee table. This technique ensures a smooth visual transition and prevents the room from looking disjointed.

**7. Play with Textures**

A mix of textures can elevate your design and make it more dynamic. Combine the smooth finish of modern furniture with the organic feel of natural furniture. For example, a glass-top dining table can be paired with wicker chairs to add depth and interest.

**8. Focus on Functionality**

When blending styles, remember that your furniture should serve your lifestyle. A room full of mismatched styles may look impressive, but if it doesn’t meet your needs, it won’t be functional. Choose pieces that balance aesthetics with practicality for a space that works and feels cohesive.

**9. Add a Unifying Decor Theme**

Decor can tie everything together, no matter how varied your furniture styles are. Incorporate a consistent theme, such as nature-inspired decor for a room with natural furniture, or metallic accents for a space with modern furniture. This subtle touch can bring harmony to the mix.

**10. Trust Your Instincts**

Finally, trust your instincts. Mixing and matching styles is about creating a space that feels like home to you. Don’t be afraid to take risks and experiment. With a little planning and creativity, you can bring together pieces from different eras and aesthetics into a cohesive and stunning design.

**Final Thoughts**

Blending furniture styles allows you to craft a home that feels unique and personal. By focusing on color, balance, materials, and textures, you can mix natural furniture, modern furniture, and other house furniture styles to create a cohesive look that reflects your taste. Remember, the key is to find harmony in contrast and let your creativity shine!

1ha4nev,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeginnerWoodWorking/comments/1ha4nev/advice_filling_and_sealing_live_edge_slab/,Advice filling and sealing live edge slab,"Hi everyone,

I’m working on a project to turn a beautiful live-edge slab into an outdoor bench seat and could use some advice. The wood has a few knots and cracks that need filling, and I’m considering different options:

* **Epoxy resin**
* **Wood filler**
* **CA glue combined with sawdust or coffee grounds** 

I haven't decided on a finish yet and after initial research it seems matching the two will be important so I wanted to have a good plan before I start. My goals for a finish are to just highlight the natural beauty of the wood, I don't want to change its colour, we have existing light wood furniture and floorboards i'm trying to maintain some consistency with. 

My main concerns are:

1. **Epoxy and UV Exposure**: I’ve read that epoxy can degrade or yellow under sunlight. Are there specific UV-resistant epoxies you’d recommend for outdoor use, or should I steer clear?

2. **Finish Compatibility**: Will wood filler or CA glue blends accept finishes well, or will they stand out too much once sealed?

3. **Annual Maintenance**: I don’t mind reapplying an finish yearly, so durability isn’t as critical as UV protection and appearance.

Its likely to be covered with cushions when in use over summer, and possibly some form of cover in the winter. I'm located in Western Australia so we get a lot of sunny days.

I’d love to hear your recommendations or tips from anyone who’s worked on similar outdoor projects. Thanks in advance!

I’m saving coffee by using 2 teaspoons I get the same level of flavor I would get from a single serving keurig cup.  My coffee also lasts longer because I can get a second flavorful cup from those same 2 teaspoons of coffee.  Then those used grounds can go into my plant pots to enrich the soil.

# What is ""The Wing Girl Method – The Approach Blueprint""?

In the world of dating advice, there’s a sea of products claiming to transform your approach game. But let’s talk about *""The Wing Girl Method – The Approach Blueprint""*. This isn’t just another generic guide—it’s a practical, step-by-step program designed to make approaching women less awkward, less intimidating, and (most importantly) more successful. The core of the program? A magical ""code phrase"" that combines words, tonality, and body language to capture attention and spark attraction.

# Why Should You Care?

Approaching women can be nerve-wracking. What do you say? How do you avoid looking creepy? And what if she rejects you? That’s where *The Approach Blueprint* steps in. It promises to teach you not just what to say, but how to say it, making your interactions feel smooth and natural. The real kicker? It’s loaded with actionable tips like the “OSA Formula,” which guarantees you’ll always have a reason to strike up a conversation—even if you’re the shyest guy in the room.

# Who is This For?

Whether you’re a dating rookie or a seasoned pro looking to up your game, this program is for you. It’s especially great for guys who feel paralyzed by fear of rejection or struggle to read the subtle signs women give when they’re interested. With tools to decode body language and green-light signals, *The Wing Girl Method* makes it clear when to approach and when to step back.

# When and Where Should You Use It?

*The Approach Blueprint* isn’t tied to one type of environment. The skills you’ll learn can be applied anywhere—coffee shops, networking events, even casual strolls in the park. The program emphasizes being ready at any moment to spark a conversation naturally. It also breaks down situational tactics, so you’ll know how to calibrate your approach based on her energy and environment.

# How Does It Work?

Here’s the magic sauce: The “code phrase” and “OSA Formula.” These tools guide you through starting a conversation, keeping it engaging, and gauging her interest—all without awkwardness. The program also includes clever conversation openers, like excuses to “accidentally” start a chat, and tips for transitioning from casual talk to playful flirting. Plus, the “Approach Ladder” concept teaches you to build confidence gradually, so every step feels manageable.

# What’s So Special About It?

Unlike other cookie-cutter dating guides, this one is created by a woman—so you’re getting advice straight from the source. It’s packed with insights most men overlook, like how to avoid the dreaded “icky feeling” women get when approached poorly. You’ll also learn to recognize subtle signs of disinterest, saving yourself from unnecessary rejection. And if rejection happens? There’s even a strategy to flip the script and come out on top.

# Final Thoughts

*The Wing Girl Method – The Approach Blueprint* is more than just a course; it’s a confidence booster. It demystifies the art of approaching women and offers practical tools to make every interaction feel effortless. So, if you’ve ever struggled to bridge the gap between interest and connection, this program might just be your golden ticket.

Are you ready to decode the secrets of attraction? This blueprint has everything you need to approach women with confidence—and maybe even a little swagger. Give it a shot!",1,1733729913.0,NaomiStudying,1,1.0,False
1ha4lkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ha4lkf/some_people_want_me_to_go_to_the_er_do_i_need_to/,Some people want me to go to the ER - do I need to?,"Symptoms:

* mild to moderate chest pain and discomfort (mostly tightness)
* burns to breathe deeply or to walk/move a lot (like more than 10-15 mins or so)
* feels mostly normal to breathe normally
* cough that feels like it's stabbing my throat and chest; became chunky
* feeling boiling hot and freezing
* no appetite and a little nauseous (comes and goes)
* throat pain
* headache
* skin hurts when something touches it.
* extreme tiredness but can't sleep
* get winded after talking on the phone for more than an hour (my fam was trying to keep me company)

In short, i feel really awful. **But here are the pros:** I can drink water, my lips are bright pink/red, i do NOT feel short of breath. My breathing sure is uncomfy, but i feel like i get enough air (except when coughing of course). My cough is not a lot but I am coughing a decent bit. No wheezing that lasts beyond a cough/phlegm clear. LIke it feels rattly but then i cough/clear my throat, have a chunky cough sesh and it's cleared.

Things that have helped a little (still feel like shit ofc): caffeine (weird amount of improvement after a coffee and after a cola), tylenol seems to be helping decently evem tho i still feel like ass.

**Important background:** Im the idiot who posted [here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gkk9w0/i_woke_up_choking_on_my_stomach_acid_and_then_it/)about 1 month or so ago saying that I choked on my stomach acid. I've been in the process of getting it under control since then, but it's been a slow road, so i thought it was my reflux due to the burn, albeit the burn was quite a bit higher and chestier than usual. When i got these new symptoms, the sickness i feel now, i immediately began pantoprazole 20mg and have been on it for about 36 hours. upper stomach pain has improved, chest/thrroat/deep in the throat burn have not. Also, i am a foreign university student living fully alone for the first time so im a little nervous about feeling so sick and dont want to overreact or underreact.

My friends are split as are my parents. Some think i just have a bad cough and others think i need to go to the ER to rule out pneumonia. I don't know how I feel. Im just scared and alone, but i really just want to be under my covers in my bed and not move tbh. that's all i can think about/want. Also, last week i was in a waiting room where a girl non-stop coughed withouut covering her mouth, and my professor came in with the worst cough i've ever heard, (In a surgical mask though, only remvoed to drink water) so i feel llike i just have th emisfortune of getting one of these things.

My instincts are to:

* continue to try to handle it alone at home as long as by a day or two from now i've had some slight maintained improvement (it's mostly been getting worse slowly)
* take tylenol or switch to advil and drink water, eat small meals as i can
* i already contacted my school health department, so hopefully i can do a virtual consult
* call the public health triage line of my country if i feel much worse, but not in danger, to ask where to go (i.e. hospital, after hour appointment, virtual consult, etc.)
* drop everything and go to the hospital immediately (i live 5 minutes walking to er) if i
   * wheeze and it doesn't improve after a few minutes
   * feel like i can't get enough air
   * get a very severe headache
   * begin vomiting or having diarrhea that is severe
   * get chest pain that isn't getting better/fluxuating
   * have a sense of doom that is not normal anxiety

I'm worried though, that I'm already gambling a bit. like that i shouldn't be fucking around with burning deep breaths or a stabbing cough. also i have a really painful thing in my ear. it's like a scab that feels like the one time i had an abscess and it sucks but not sure if that's related.

Like, do i die tonight if i wait to see how i feel in the afternoon (ill force myself to sleep in) and what the health center says? Or do i ruin my chances of recovery if im an idiot and have pneumonia?

Feeling stupid and a bit scared - any guidance would be amazing.

1ha4jxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1ha4jxz/complaining_about_a_friendgym_classmate/,Complaining about a friend/gym classmate,"I just want to complain about this guy who I met at a recreational gym class. I am a 40 year old woman and he is a 57 divorced guy who has 3 adult children, in our group there is another woman who is 62. The three of us met at a gym class, and last month we started doing weekly hikes together. I'm always looking for people to exercise with so I was quite happy to be friends with them at first. We started a group chat to schedule our weekly hikes and he is overly passionate to the point where I feel so annoyed. (Disclaimer: He is a nice person so I have chosen not to say anything to him and I do not think he is trying to date me, he just has low self confidence and no friends, but at the same time he is getting too personal it feels really uncomfortable.) He often texts the group chat when he is waking up telling us he woke up, and telling us how he slept and asks us how he slept, when he goes to sleep he texts us that he is going to bed, when we are busy and we don't reply to his texts he texts us if we still asleep and if I still don't reply he facetimes me.

What really got me annoyed is that he loves to make jokes regarding race. At first I got kinda mad and I really wanted to tell him off (I'm not afraid to tell him off but this guy is truly clueless and I really truly do not think he understands at all, even if I explained to him it would be a waste of my effort). I am asian (born and raised in the US) and so is the other woman and this guy is white. The other day we went on a hike after class (just him and me) and he thought he was really funny telling me that it's ok to use the n word if you are friends with black people. I said no it is not, he thought he was so funny and said no its ok blah blah blah. I said no it's not ok at all and then explain. He didn't listen to me at all or understand. Then we were walking around the area and there was a property that says no trespassing, private property. Then he proceeds to walk in and says let me show you the ""american way"" you are Asian (he meant it as in Asians are usually more polite and reserved). At that moment I was so annoyed with what he said with the n word I wasn't really thinking and when I got home I felt quite annoyed with that comment. What does that mean, so Asians born in the US, and have lived their entire lives in the US are not American?

Everytime we hang out he constantly asks us about Asian culture, and Asian countries, to the point it's actually really offensive. Not because I don't like my heritage but for example we went to an Asian restaurant that did not have any Asian decor, just regular decor, and he asked us what is the meaning behind this decor was as Asians love to have things with symbolic meaning behind them. I told him it has no meaning, he asks the other Asian woman in our group, she replies the same. The next time me, him and another Asian woman from our gym class go to that restaurant he asks again. But it'll be nonstop, so if we go on a hike, from driving there, to the hike to lunch, to driving back, to getting coffee, he'll constantly ask us about the communist government or whatever but none of us have ever lived there before.

He'll ask me about something about China and after I respond to him, he'll tease me for it, at first I was like whatever, then the next day he'll tease me again and then a third time another day. It's exhausting and annoying. He really truly thinks he's so hilarious and somehow thinks that I enjoy his jokes when I actually think it's racist and offensive, but when I calm down I really don't think he understands at all, he just thinks he's being funny and that he's making jokes and having fun with everyone.

I got so annoyed of him I wanted to call him out but the gym class is ending this week and because he has self esteem issues and the other older woman seems to be having fun with him I didn't want to say anything. It's just has gotten so annoying, he also is very into Christianity and loves to text us how much he loves us. Since class is ending he also asked me multiple times to visit him near where he lives which is 2 1/2 hours away to have ice cream with him. ( I mentioned before that I liked that ice cream shop). NO WAY. Why would I drive 2 1/2 hours just to have ice cream with him just the two of us? And he would text the group chat that he loves us in such a sentimental, it's just makes me so uncomfortable cause we just met at the gym the last few months and just started hanging out a few weeks ago, we are not BFF's. It's just started to feel so uncomfortable and he is annoying me so much. I just wrote this to get this off my chest, I don't like being mean to people, especially when I don't think he had any ill intentions but it's just gotten so annoying that it feels like he's being in my personal space. Btw, his ex wife and his ex gf's were all Asians, which also makes me feel weird, especially b/c if you were married to someone that's not white before wouldn't you be more conscious about racial topics?

We started our jobs at the same time and would always eat lunch together and hang out after our shifts (like grabbing food, going to coffee shops and a pumpkin patch together). I started to develop feelings, but didn’t want to be unprofessional so never said anything to him.

A few years later, I was planning to leave the job to finish school. After word got around, he pulled me aside and said he wanted to take me out to dinner as a farewell. During dinner, we chatted like old times and made me miss spending time together. I really appreciated him taking me out so I wrote him a “thankful to have you in my life” card and left it on his car windshield on my last day when he was working. He texted me that night thanking me for the card and said that he’ll miss me a lot and always here for me no matter what. 

Now to this summer, I was visiting his hometown (which he moved back to this year) for vacation so I hit him up to see if he was interested in meeting up and catching up after all this time. He said he’d love to and we ended up getting dinner and him showing me around his hometown (like going to a famous lookout in the city) and him treating me to ice cream after. We chatted all night and he even asked if I was seeing anyone (which I’m not). He made some comments like “I’m surprised no one has snatched you up” and when I asked him back he said he’s “single as a Pringle”. After that night, we texted back and forth for a few weeks, even when we went on trips and shared pictures, but then the conversation ended and haven’t spoken since August.

Over the years, I’ve dated but in the back of my mind he’s always been “the one that got away”. Even after all this time, I never stopped liking him. We’re both single, and I want to text him or at least wish him a happy birthday which is coming up, but don’t want to come off needy.

Do you think he has (or had) a crush on me? Does him asking if I’m seeing anyone hint that he’s interested? Or just a normal curious question to ask someone? Even though we’re long distance now, is it worth telling him how I feel or were all those gestures just a guy being friendly/nice to a girl?

1ha4cjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1ha4cjr/how_to_stop_being_lazy_on_sundays/,How to stop being lazy on sundays?,"Hello,

So, I have a major problem with sundays.

Through the week I am quite disciplined, I do workout, meditate, read, do house work, learning to trade, learning french or electrical work - from 7 am to 8 pm I am on my legs. I eat healthy and sleep well, I also control my coffeine and nicotine intake.

But, I am scared of sundays. Oh, boy, sundays. When sunday comes, I am for maybe two to three hours motivated to do something then it stops. 

And this happens: I lay in my bed ALL day, doomscrolling, smoking a pack, drinking five cups of coffee, doing no house chores, no workout, no meditating, eating unhealthy. 

I take a stress reliefing pill just to take the edge off, of the anxiety of not doing anything.

After sunday, I loose all interest in going to work next day, might even call in sick, I become selfish. 

I hate sundays so much.

It takes three to four days till I get the dopamine back, and I feel ""normal"" again.

I want to become successful so bad, but my sunday routine pulls me back everytime. 

I am just someone with a phone addiction, and would that solve my problem?

Thank you",1,1733728763.0,getdisciplined,3,1.0,False

","I think I’ve cracked the code to getting more done and actually feeling good while doing it

Instead of my brain, I’ve started using my gut to control my mornings, and it’s completely changed how productive I am.

Here’s the deal: at night, I think back on how my meals felt—bloated, sluggish, or fine. If my gut was off, I prep for the next morning with something simple and light: lemon water,, or anything that keeps me clear-headed. No coffee on an empty stomach, no heavy breakfasts that leave me dragging.

When my gut’s happy, my brain’s sharp. It’s like a reset button before I tackle the hardest task of the day. No distractions, no excuses—just full focus.

It helps me be productive throughout the day.

Hey everyone, I’ve been into espresso for about a year now. Started with and still use a Sage Barista Express (Breville for the Americans here). Like a lot of you, I’ve wasted my fair share of beans trying to dial things in and figure out what adjustments worked best.

At some point, I wanted a better way to track my shots, but nothing I tried really worked for me. Pen and paper felt like I was missing out on some cool data analysis, and the apps I found either had too many features I didn’t need or didn’t do enough. So, I decided to just make my own thing.

It’s super simple: a web app designed for your phone that saves your shot data locally, no accounts, no sign-ups, just a way to keep track and (hopefully) improve over time. You can select a previous shot as a template and tweak the inputs while having the reference values in sight.

If that sounds useful, here’s the link: [betterbrew.me](https://betterbrew.me). And if not, no worries, I’d love to hear how you all are keeping track of your shots.

**What is the vision and why do I want to aggregate espresso data?**

If users decide to share their espresso logs, and there are enough of them, the app could make a pretty good suggestion for the best shot recipe based on a coffee-machine combination.

Would love to hear what you think!

**PS:** If you open the link in Safari on iOS and select “Save to Home Screen”, it’ll look more like an app.",2,1733727919.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

1ha45dk,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouTubeCreators/comments/1ha45dk/turn_your_everyday_moments_into_viral_youtube/,Turn Your Everyday Moments into Viral YouTube Content,"In the era of social media, turning ordinary moments into extraordinary content has become an art. Vloggers have mastered the craft of transforming daily routines into engaging YouTube videos that rack up thousands (or even millions) of views. But how do they do it? The secret lies in storytelling, relatability, and creativity. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how you can turn your everyday life into viral YouTube content.

# 1. Find the Magic in the Mundane

The beauty of vlogging is that *anything* can be content. From cooking a meal to visiting a local market, simple activities can become viral hits if framed correctly. The key is to focus on relatability. Ask yourself, “What moments from my day would others find interesting, funny, or helpful?” Your unique perspective on everyday life is what makes it stand out.

**Pro Tip:** Highlight the emotions behind the experience. If you’re sharing a cooking vlog, show the excitement of discovering a new recipe or the struggle of a kitchen mishap, this human element resonates with viewers.

# 2. Master the Art of Storytelling

Every viral vlog has a storyline. Instead of recording random clips, build a narrative with a beginning, middle, and end. Start with a hook (like an interesting question, challenge, or teaser), move on to the main event, and end with a reflection or lesson. This structure keeps viewers engaged from start to finish.

**Example:** Instead of ""I went shopping today,"" turn it into ""I challenged myself to buy groceries for under $10 – Here’s what happened!"" This approach adds intrigue and curiosity, encouraging viewers to watch the whole video.

# 3. Make Use of Strong Visuals and Editing

Visual appeal is crucial. Use cinematic shots, close-ups, time-lapses, and smooth transitions to make your vlog look polished. Even the simplest daily activities, like brewing coffee or walking through a park, can feel cinematic with the right camera angles and editing techniques.

**Editing Tips:**

* Add music that complements the mood.
* Use jump cuts to maintain fast pacing.
* Include text overlays, captions, and emojis to add personality.

If you’re unsure how to improve your editing skills, there are plenty of free video editing tools like CapCut, iMovie, or DaVinci Resolve that can help you get started.

# 4. Be Authentic and Show Your Personality

People watch vlogs not just for the content but for *you*. Viewers connect with creators who are genuine, relatable, and unfiltered. Share your thoughts, opinions, and small moments of vulnerability. This human touch builds trust and loyalty among viewers.

**Remember:** Perfection isn’t necessary. Showing raw, unpolished moments (like forgetting your lines or making a mistake) often makes the vlog feel more authentic and enjoyable.

# 5. Capitalize on Trends and Challenges

Look out for current YouTube trends or viral challenges that you can incorporate into your daily life. If you see a “24-hour challenge” or a trending food recipe, try your own twist on it. The more timely your content, the better its chances of going viral.

**Pro Tip:** Don’t just copy trends, personalize them. Add your unique spin, perspective, or humor. If the trend is ""10-minute morning routine,"" you could do ""10-minute morning routine for night owls"" to stand out.

# 6. Use Catchy Thumbnails and Descriptive Titles

Your video title and thumbnail are the first things viewers see. Use clear, descriptive titles that tell viewers exactly what they’ll get from the video. Combine curiosity with clarity, but avoid clickbait.

**Example:** Instead of ""My Crazy Day,"" try ""I Tried to Live Like a Minimalist for 24 Hours – Here’s What Happened."" The second title is clear, compelling, and likely to attract clicks.

For the thumbnail, show your face with an expressive reaction, highlight the main element of the story, and use bold, readable text overlays.

# 7. Add a Call-to-Action (CTA) and Interact with Viewers

Ask your viewers to like, comment, and subscribe. But instead of using a generic CTA, make it fun and specific. For instance, if you’re vlogging about a cooking challenge, say, “Comment below if you think I nailed this recipe or if I should stick to instant noodles!” This type of CTA encourages more interaction and builds a community around your content.

# 8. Consistency is the Real Secret to Virality

Going viral isn't always about luck. It’s about being *consistently visible*. Post regularly, stick to a niche, and engage with your audience in the comments. The YouTube algorithm loves consistent creators, and each new video increases your chances of a viral hit.

If you’re struggling to come up with YouTube content ideas, check out our guide on [**How to Find YouTube Video Ideas that Go Viral**](https://www.utubepublisher.in/2024/11/how-to-find-youtube-video-ideas-that-go.html). It’s packed with practical strategies to keep your creative juices flowing.

Turning everyday moments into viral YouTube content isn’t magic, it’s a mix of creativity, storytelling, and authenticity. By following these steps, you can turn your daily routine into captivating videos that build a loyal following. So, grab your camera, hit record, and show the world how extraordinary everyday life can be.",2,1733727901.0,YouTubeCreators,1,1.0,False
1ha45db,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ha45db,I decided that now was the time to get my grubby little grabbies on the Nest perfume oils I’ve been eyeing 😂 + GWP stack ✨,"I finally got the travel roller oils of Nest’s Balinese Coconut and Madagascar Vanilla. I’ve been savoring my little vial of Nest Balinese Coconut but I decided I’m tired of savoring 😭😂. I’ve also been savoring my tiny roller oil of Madagascar Vanilla and have been using it heavily lately so I decided to get the travel size of that one too! ✨

Although my vanilla Tree Hut body butter goes on sale for 20% on the 15th, I decided to try the new Ulta Whipped Body Butters instead! I’m super excited to try the Vanilla Velour scent because the notes sound sooooo good ✨. 

The surprise sample pack was a fun surprise, so hopefully I get some interesting foil packets from that one! I was also in luck that four GWPs stacked with each other! I’m running low on my Tree Hut Rainbow Sherbet body scrub (1 use left 😭) and my Tree Hut Coffee body scrub is on its way out (4 uses left), so I’m excited to try the Sol De Janeiro one! I’ve also been wanting to try the Dionis hand creams, but tell myself no every time I go to buy one since I have a few hand creams already. Now (if the GWP comes as it’s advertised) I’ll get a free one mwah ha ha ha 😂. I was also happy that the 23 piece beauty bag I wanted was still there! 

I added a little screen shot of my total + coupon + points spend, and although I didn’t have a lot of points, I was happy to spend them all ✨! I’ll be getting 121 points for this order which is perfect. I’ll spend those when I use my $10 off coupon and go smoothly into my no-buy year with all of my points spent ✨.

1ha3wk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Greyhounds/comments/1ha3wk8/help_with_walking_a_year_in_ive_tried_everything/,"Help with walking: A year in, I've tried everything","I'm a year in with my beautiful girl, who is 7. Sorry for the novel. 

I'll preface this with - my girl loves to walk, and I love walking her (when things are going well). The sound of a leash and she's running for the door. I could count on one hand the times in the last year she's not been bothered about going and that's usually vet-related, big travel days or absolute torrential rain. 

We started off small, as advised - a few minutes here and there, building up slowly around our suburban community (we have loads of parks in our backyard too). She was often rearing to go and never showed any nervousness or anxiety. Months in it felt like 30 minutes wasn't touching the sides (she'd be restless when we got home) so now we typically do 45 minutes to an hour, morning and night, sometimes longer on weekends. She also does a pack walk one day a week which is typically a couple hours with a walker, and occasionally this wears her out so much she goes back to bed after dinner and doesn't move (so to my mind, there are cues when she's not interested in walking). Her walker has never reported any issues and neither has a friend who occasionally walks her. 

But for me, she has been freezing on our walks the whole year and nine times out of 10 it's at the point when we're circling back home and she's smart enough to realise it, OR I'm taking her in a direction she doesn't want to go, which might include very early on in the walk, half-way through after she's lead the way for a bit, or at the end - this extends to things like: refuses to budge so I can get near a bin to dispose of a baggie; letting me side-step a metre to pick up her poop; getting out of other people's way if for whatever reason we're in an awkward spot. For example, recently a woman who was afraid of dogs asked me if I could move my grey further away from her car so she could get in, and my sweet angel dug her heels in and would not move without me pulling, which felt awful. It's for this reason I can't take her, for example, two minutes down the road to the corner store or the cafe to get a coffee, because I'm pretty sure she won't just 'follow' easily. Which is a shame for her, because it means she misses out when I know she's always up for an adventure - but I can't face taking her for a 'quick walk' because it ends up in a bit of a stand-off when we're faced with direction choices. 

I have read all the commentary about greys typically being frightened in these scenarios, I've read loads of advice on this forum, Googled, read Greyhound for Dummies and I've also watched training videos and sought the advice of a trainer. Nothing, really, has provided a long term, or even a mid term, fix. 

My gut instinct is that she's latching onto a smell or wants to investigate something, rather than being frightened. There are times she IS frightened - she hates other dogs, the vets, and any type of business or unfamiliar indoor setting like a pub, pet store or hardware store. I recognise this and I don't make her go in these places if she doesn't want to (with the exception of the vet, heh). 

10/10 she will get moving again if I relent and we walk the direction she wants to walk and 10/10 that's in the opposite direction to one that will get us back home. Again, I know it's HER walk, but there have to be limits to these things because unfortunately I can't be out for 90 minutes twice a day. (Another example - she often wants to investigate the grounds of a nearby resthome, but dogs aren't allowed past the driveway. I have to avoid taking her that direction now because it's difficult to lead her away from the gate.)  

The walks are typically looking like: 20 to 30 minutes or maybe even longer of her wandering happily away from home, sniffing all the things, not being bothered by anything, and then me trying to divert us down another road or pathway or whatever so we can start heading back home and her digging in. That results in me spending the next half hour or even longer trying to get us back home. 

I'm now thinking I need to drastically shorten the walks to avoid scenarios where I'm getting frustrated because we're far from home and she's not budging - but that would obviously also be a shame for her. 

These are the things I've tried, typically over extended periods like weeks or months

Coaxing with treats (made the freezing more frequent, I think. She's too smart.)  
Not taking any treats at all   
Ignoring her until she starts walking (pretty good success, but I can be standing for awhile)  
Showering her with praise, cuddles and pats (never works)   
Mixing up the walk and doing different ones every day (sort of works)   
Trying the same walk every day (she gets bored)   
Emergency u-turns. (Will only work maybe once, then she realises what I'm doing and refuses to budge.)  
Sticking expressly to the park behind us, in case she's overwhelmed by traffic noises.   
Letting her totally dictate the walk and seeing where we end up. (This works fine when I have all the time in the world, any sign of curtailment from me, it's over rover.)   
Setting the tone from the beginning and me picking which way we go. (Frustration on her end.)   
Immediately taking her back home if she refuses to budge on our first 'choice' of direction. (This worked a few times but ultimately I feel guilty and she gets restless.)   
Letting her run around an enclosed park lead free so she can burn off some energy first. (Never works.)  
Shortening the walks. (See comment about restlessness.)   
Lengthening the walks.   
Being loud and clear when it comes to crossroads and she's straining to go one way (I would say ""No"", loud and clear, and this actually worked for an extended period but has now stopped).    
Letting her sniff lots v putting her on a short lead and making it a brisque walk (trainer's advice and surprisingly worked well, however if I do this halfway through the walk and not at the beginning, she digs her heels in).  
Surprising her with a sudden quick pull and a trot (might work for a minute or two, then she'll stop again.)   
Using a harness instead of a lead (made things worse)   
Bringing water with us in case she's thirsty (she won't drink it)  
Distracting with - oh hey, look at this smelly flower, oh look, another doggo (never works)  
Putting her in the car and going somewhere out of neighbourhood, (sometimes works really well, sometimes doesn't).

None of these things have really solved things. At times she will go weeks without an issue but more recently after a really good period of her understanding 'no' and largely being guided by me with no problems at all, (and me thinking, by golly I've cracked it) we are now back to walks that are starting to spill into the 90 minute mark because it's so hard to get her home. I'm unsure what's changed. 

I check her pads on basically a daily basis and I do check them mid walk, just in case. She's recently had bloods, x rays, tests for other things and on appearances, at least to the vet, she seems healthy and not in pain. She doesn't limp, she by and large has more energy than most other greyhounds I've met. 

Is this something that might relax with time, or do I need to totally start from scratch again, beginning with a 10 minute walk and slowly building up?

Or something else altogether?

I 18[ftm] grew up with both my bio parents, both of them were physically and emotionally abusive from the beginning but everything got a whole lot worse when I was 9 and they got divorced. I stayed with my bio mom until I was 14, she was an alcoholic and bipolar (diagnosed) but refused to take her meds and was very physically and emotionally abusive for that whole period of time but I didn't realize any of it was wrong. 

I moved in with my bio dad the day after the first covid lock down started in my country. For the first year or so everything seemed great, looking back there was definitely emotional abuse going on but it was so much better than with my bio mom that I didn't notice, but over the next two years things progressively got worse. He beat me up on multiple occasions so badly that my eyes and mouth were swollen shut and my face was bruised black. He turned off my internet access so I wouldn't be able to tell anyone what was going on. He would put his money and Toiletries and stuff in my room just to accuse me of stealing. 

When i was 17 and 2 months away from graduating high-school I ran away and was essentially adopted by a friend's family, they are everything to me and treat me like I've always wanted to be treated. 

I've been with them a little over a year.

Now onto the story: recently my bio dad had been messaging me, asking if we can meet for coffee and such. I agree only because there's a trust fund for me (my inheritance from my great grandfather) that I need the contact info for. He kinda dodged the question but I'll get it eventually.  But anyway I say him and he cried and hugged me and seemed genuinely upset (I've only seen him cry like twice in my life) he got as coffee and we sat and talked and it was actually good, he asked if I needed anything, I said roll on and body spray (I was running low and I figured it's easy and cheap) he noticed my glasses were broken and got me knew ones, hot me a whole bunch of Toiletries: shampoo, conditioner, leave I 
Conditioner, toothpaste, body wash, a new loofah, Gucci fragrance (that's the craziest part to me) and new shoes, he also had me go shopping and pick clothes out for him to buy me. I feel like he's trying to buy My love back, I don't mind it, I'll take the stuff, but I think he's hoping things will just go back to normal and that's never going to happen, I'm open to having some sort of relationship with him but he will never be my dad again.

(I will also run syncthing to keep my emacs updated across all devices.) That's all, intention is to limit potential for distraction. So nothing else I want to be able to do with this setup: just write and edit stories without latency (as best as current tech allows) on a decent sized e-ink screen.

(I've got enough other devices to read, web browse, other work, etc. I do not need any tablet with stylus because I am gonna use Nuwa pen on paper before throwing it/tagging in emacs. Always do better writing first drafts on paper.)

So system is:

Dasung 40 Hz Paperlike 13"" BW  
Vilros 15"" USB Keyboard with Touchpad  
Raspberry Pi device  
Battery Pack for travel

Has anyone done something like this for only writing or coding? (My use case is writing fiction.) Do you have any advice?

One thing I am unsure about is which Raspberry Pi to select, and which Raspberry OS.

I also understand that the Dasung has no battery. At home I can just plug in, but when going to a coffee shop or something, would need some kind of power bank I guess? I do not know which battery device to look for.

Case/carry recommendations for system would also be appreciated.

Stand for screen needed?

I am headed to this place in Atlanta called Microcenter later this week to ask their guidance on this, and to buy the Pi/case/battery pack, maybe other accessories.

I would really appreciate it if someone with a similar setup would be able to give me some advice so I have a better idea of context before talking to them, making the purchases.

I am very average tech savvy. I did some of the emacs install myself, but ultimately had to get some help setting up and customizing the program to my purpose. (And now that it's working, it's really awesome software. Love it more than the Scrivener I used to use, because I can index as much material as my heart can write into one system.)

I do not mind forking out the bucks for a nice setup/accessories because I'm gonna use this thing like hell for the next 5 years probably.

Thanks for your time. Hope this post adds some value.",1,1733726527.0,eink,0,1.0,False

Aponte Village is a community-driven coffee project nestled in the Juanambuú Canyon at 2100m. Managed by the Inga indigenous community, the land is communal and governed by traditional elders who preserve ancestral laws.

But what’s the real difference?

If you're a founder or investor—or just curious—it’s vital to understand these distinctions. Here's the breakdown.

# PE vs. VC: The Big Picture

# Investment Focus

* **VC** is all about startups and early-stage companies. Think tech disruptors, medical breakthroughs, or anything innovative with huge growth potential.
* **PE**? It’s for mature, established businesses—those that might need a shake-up, like restructuring or operational overhauls.

**Example**: VC funds might bet on a startup creating AI-driven solar panels. PE funds? They’ll likely buy a factory that already makes solar panels and figure out how to double its profits.

# Ownership Stakes

* **VCs** go for **minority stakes** (less than 50%). Founders stay in control. It’s about nurturing vision and growth.
* **PE firms**? They want **majority stakes** (sometimes 100%). With control comes power—over strategy, operations, and everything else.

# Risk vs. Reward

* **VC**: Higher risk, higher potential reward. Startups fail—often. But the ones that succeed? They can deliver **10x, even 100x returns**.
* **PE**: Lower risk because they invest in proven businesses. Returns are typically in the **15–20% annual range**.

**Stat**: Historical VC fund returns average 20–30% annually for winners, while PE funds settle around 15–20%.

# The Money Involved

* **VC deal sizes**: Anywhere from **$1M to $100M**, depending on how early the company is.
* **PE deals**: Start in the **tens of millions** and go into **billions** for the big players.

# How They Operate

# VC Firms

* Focus on growth: marketing, product development, hiring top talent.
* Common industries: **tech, healthcare, and clean energy**.
* Strategy: Write a check, offer advice, and hope the company skyrockets.

# PE Firms

* Heavy on data: deep dives into financials and operational inefficiencies.
* Common industries: **manufacturing, retail, services**.
* Strategy: Use leverage (borrowed money) to buy companies, make them better, sell them for a profit.

# Cultural Vibes

* **VC**: Jeans, hoodies, and casual coffee chats.
* **PE**: Suits, ties, and formal boardrooms.

Yes, the clichés are true. 

But it reflects how they approach their worlds—one thrives on innovation, the other on stability.

# Which One’s For You?

If you’re starting out with a wild idea? **VC is your crowd**.

If you’re running a steady business and need a boost—or an exit? **PE’s your play**.

# Recap: PE vs. VC

|**Feature**|**Venture Capital (VC)**|**Private Equity (PE)**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Focus**|Early-stage companies|Mature businesses|
|**Risk**|High|Moderate|
|**Ownership**|Minority|Majority or full control|
|**Average Returns**|20–30% annually (top funds)|15–20% annually|

I hate myself so much, every time he ignored me I thought he was just busy or stressed and gave him space/waited, it was constantly like this, every month or few months or year I would live off 1 or 2 messages thinking he liked me when it was obvious he didn't. I always thought I'd experience live at a young age with someone who would be my best friend and we'd hold hands and go on walks and talk. I used to be a better person. I can't live with the fact that it's gone and I'll never experience that in my life. It was my own fault which if I had lived independently I would have gotten to experience that. But I ruined my career too for the same reason, studying extra years in school, studying longer and not achieving anything more because I didn't work hard enough, isolating myself most of the time. Because I didn't work hard enough I couldn't get the job and career that was my dream and am working in a different job. Seeing myself get older feels unbearable.

🔵 We have seen that how Vivian was favoured , asking opinions of him on almost all the things his coffee..etc.

🔵 KVM was going good for 2 weeks . People started adoring him .
🔵 Then BB started taunting him . He got trolled by host , even for his personal matters and gave him wrong feedback.
🔵 Still he was providing content and had screentime of almost 15-20 min of the ep .(Min)
🔵 While real LAADLA was doing nothing.
🔵 BB played move on KV as he has lot of potential. 
🔵 So unhone uske friend bulake real feedback dilwaya jise SM par Spoon-feeding bola gya . 
🔵 Usme bhi BB ka agenda ye tha Wo unke hisab se chale.
🔵 Isiliye itne hfto se wo KV ko bol rhe hain shilpa se door rho. From Game POV shilpa itna harm nhi kregi jitni Shrutika.
🔵 Aur agar krti bhi hai to KV ko sympathy mil rhi hai ( ye point to dena pdega avinash ko) Lekin shrutika bahut bada harm kr skti... Uska to ye BB wale baar patchup krwadete KV group se.
🔵 Let's come on this WKV . Avinash Vivian par koi question nhi hua , kyun? . Eisha se KV k character par baat krne par question nhi hua kyun . Rajat ko bass halka fulka warning dediya.
🔵 Aur ye WKV KV ki tareef se jyda dusre contestant k liye Wakeup call tha.
🔵 Aur haan TimeGod task kaise design hue hain wo bhi dekhna 
🔵 Inn sab points k baat bhi agr aapko KV laadla lgta hai to apko pranaam 🙏🏼

“Ah, Libertyville, Illinois. The place where the only thing more common than white picket fences are the number of people still convinced they’re living in a “charming small town” even though it’s been swallowed whole by suburban sprawl. You know you’re in Libertyville when the most exciting thing to do on a Saturday night is debate which artisanal coffee shop is the most “authentic.”

The town’s so “historic” that half of it is probably just what suburban developers consider a “vintage” look for the latest strip mall. Libertyville’s downtown might give you the illusion that it’s quaint and picturesque—until you realize that it’s basically an Instagram filter on a CVS parking lot. The only thing that’s ever truly wild in Libertyville is how fast the speed bumps come at you while trying to get out of town.

And let’s talk about the lake. Oh, the “lakefront” area. Sure, it's nice if you want to pretend you're in a coastal paradise—until you realize it's just a small pond surrounded by middle-aged men in khakis trying to convince you they’re “outdoor enthusiasts.”

If you need proof that Libertyville is the land of the bland, just look at the local cuisine. There’s an overwhelming abundance of places to eat that all serve the same 10 items with slightly different names. You'll get more excitement from the color of your food than its flavor.

But hey, don’t worry. If you’re ever feeling like you need some real culture, just head to the local high school’s “award-winning” marching band concert, where the only thing louder than the music is the collective sigh of every parent praying for their child to get into an Ivy League school while they endure the melodrama of a football game.
