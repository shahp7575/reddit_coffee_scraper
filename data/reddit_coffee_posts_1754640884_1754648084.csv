The most memorable dishes were the beef tartare, truffle somen, and akami nigiri. I really enjoyed everything, but I do wish there was more nigiri. 

The desserts were great. I loved the Warabi mochi with brown sugar syrup. It was perfectly soft and sweet. The coffee panna cotta surprised me - the coffee flavor was actually noticeable and strong although the color was quite pale. It paired well with the mixed berries. 

The service was phenomenal; very attentive. The chefs were friendly, talkative, funny, and open to sharing details about what goes into their whole process. After the dinner service ended, they stayed back to talk about their experience and how they source their ingredients, they asked us how we had come across Maru and where we were from. 

We all got to pick and keep our chopsticks, which they neatly wrapped up for us. At the end when they were handing out the printed menu, I asked if I could get everyone‚Äôs signature on the menu, but the chefs and staff actually prepared a beautiful signed card for us congratulating us on our anniversary! The complimentary glass of yuzu wine was also a gift for our anniversary. It was absolutely delicious - like an upgraded limoncello.

We all do this: see an incredible restaurant or hidden spot in a reel, save it with good intentions, then completely forget about it when we're actually in that city. I went to Japan last year with 300+ saved reels and couldn't act on a single one because finding what was near me was impossible.

After getting frustrated enough, I ended up building something for myself - basically an app that turns those saved reels into an actual map you can use. You just share any reel to it and it pins the location automatically. When you're walking around a new city, you can instantly see what spots you've saved nearby.

I've been using it for months now and it's completely changed how I travel. Instead of that sinking feeling of ""I know I saved something good around here..."" I actually visit the places I got excited about.

The app is completely free (not commercial, just something I made for hardcore travelers like us). Fair warning though - I'll probably have to stop onboarding new users eventually if server costs get too crazy, so mentioning it now while it's still open.

Not trying to promote anything here - I genuinely think this saved folder problem affects all of us and wanted to share what's worked for me.

1mkra9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/psytrance/comments/1mkra9o/my_festival_summer_review/,My Festival Summer Review,"# Hai in den Mai (01 ‚Äì 04 May 2025, Germany)

Like every year, I kicked off the season with the Hai in den Mai Festival in Germany. Many regulars will agree when I say: this place has something magical. I often call it a *‚Äúmini Ozora‚Äù* because the atmosphere and forest setting remind me so much of the famous Ozora Festival.

I had amazing days there with my friends, but‚Äîtrue to tradition‚Äîthe weather was harsh. This year, nighttime temperatures dropped to just 2¬∞C, and still, some barefoot warriors roamed around unfazed.

**Music:**  
For progressive psytrance lovers, Hai in den Mai is unbeatable. I‚Äôve yet to hear better progressive sets at any other festival. The Backyard Stage is also worth mentioning‚Äîserving up Alternative Techno and Psytech on a crystal-clear, powerful sound system. Honestly, Hai in den Mai *sounds* different from other psytrance festivals‚Äîthere‚Äôs a certain punch and clarity.  
Besides these, there‚Äôs also a Club Stage with Techno and Drum & Bass, and a Hightech/Forest Stage. But that‚Äôs not really my cup of tea, so I rarely go there.

**Area:**  
The festival takes place in a small but dense forest, giving it an intimate, atmospheric vibe. You can see and feel the love that went into creating the space. It‚Äôs cozy, colorful, and alive‚Äîjust like Ozora, only smaller.

**Food:**  
Fully vegetarian and vegan, with fair German prices. I didn‚Äôt have a single bad meal there, though as someone who prefers a protein-rich diet, I did miss more high-protein options.

**Camping:**  
This year, camping was a letdown. I bought a car camping ticket so I could park next to my friends in the tent area and use my car as a base. Unfortunately, they oversold the tickets, and the car camping area was already full when I arrived. We had to split up‚Äîmy friends in the regular camping area, me in the day-parking zone. Forty euros wasted. I contacted the organizers but never got a reply‚Äînot even a simple ‚Äúsorry.‚Äù A coupon for next year would have been a nice gesture.

**Conclusion:**  
Hai in den Mai, I love you, but I‚Äôll only come back if the weather is dry. Traveling such a long distance for a rainy, muddy weekend just isn‚Äôt worth it.

# Spiritbase Festival (12 ‚Äì 15 June 2025, Czech Republic)

Spiritbase is a little hidden gem‚Äîa tiny lakeside festival with maybe 500 people in total. It‚Äôs by far the most relaxed festival I‚Äôve attended. Everything is close by: the campsite is just a five-minute walk from the stage, and the stage itself is right on the lake, making dancing at sunset absolutely magical.

The workshops here are surprisingly good for such a small gathering, and the whole vibe is easygoing and intimate.

**Music:**  
They play a broad spectrum, but mostly Progressive and Full-On. The sound system is great‚Äîno complaints, but also no standout highlights for me.

**Food:**  
Decent, though nothing too fancy. If you go, definitely grab a pizza‚Äîthey‚Äôre the highlight.

**Camping:**  
Simply the best out of all festivals I‚Äôve been to‚Äîclean toilets, great showers.

**Overall:**  
I always enjoy coming here. The people are friendly, the atmosphere is unique, and Spiritbase really has its own special charm.

# Boom Festival (17 ‚Äì 24 July 2025, Portugal)

This was my first Boom‚Äîand I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Boomland is a special place, and I now fully understand why people keep coming back. Boom delivers more than just music‚Äîit delivers a feeling, an atmosphere that‚Äôs hard to put into words.

It has the best crowd of any festival I‚Äôve been to: friendly, open, and connected. It felt more like a spiritual gathering than a music event. The workshops were outstanding‚Äîsome of the best I‚Äôve ever attended. Everything seemed designed to foster connection.

I laughed like I hadn‚Äôt laughed in years, I cried because I missed someone special who couldn‚Äôt be there with me, and I felt more connected than ever before. It was a dream I didn‚Äôt want to wake up from.

**Music:**  
I have to admit‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt come for the music this time. The lineup was good but not mind-blowing. The Alchemy Circle was far too overcrowded, and even in the front, it felt packed. The Dance Temple floor wasn‚Äôt my favorite to dance on, but that‚Äôs probably because I kept comparing it to Ozora‚Äôs stages. I loved the Gardens‚Äîjust lying in a hammock there was pure bliss.

**Food:**  
Delicious and made with love. The volunteers were clearly enjoying themselves, and you could feel that energy. The only downside was the queues‚Äîsometimes I chose food stalls just because the lines were shorter. Waiting 20 minutes for an iced coffee is about 15 minutes too long for me.

**Workshops & Art:**  
For me, these were the true highlights of Boom.

**Overall:**  
Boom was more than great‚Äîit lit special feelings in me, and I‚Äôm deeply thankful for the experience. I‚Äôll definitely return. My only personal gripe is that it feels too short for such a big festival‚Äîbut that‚Äôs just me comparing it to Ozora, and as they say, comparison is the thief of joy.

# Ozora Festival (25 July ‚Äì 05 August 2025, Hungary)

I love Ozora, and that‚Äôs why I return every year. Compared to Boom, Ozora is a pure music festival‚Äîand they improve it every year.

This year was special because I came straight from Boom, took a few chill days at home, and arrived on Monday just in time for the Opening Ceremony. I thought I‚Äôd mostly be there for the music, but it turned out to be much more.

My psychedelic tolerance was high after Boom, so I kept it light‚Äîjust some weed and a beer or two each day. I came alone this year (my friends had enough after Boom), and surprisingly, it turned out to be my best Ozora yet. I met amazing new people, danced for seven days straight, and enjoyed every moment.

**Music:**  
A solid 11/10 this year. The lineup was incredible. Highlights included Shpongle/Hallucinogen followed by Ace Ventura‚Äîpeople went absolutely crazy, me included. The stages at Ozora are the best dancefloors in the world.  
Some of my other favorites:

* Tuesday: Younger Brother at the Dragon‚Äôs Nest
* Wednesday: HypnOgeo on the Main Stage
* Saturday: Symbolico and Basher Toe at the Dome

Pumpui felt a bit weaker than in past years, but I liked the improvements to the stage.

**Food:**  
Prices have gone up (8‚Äì10‚Ç¨ per plate), but portions are generous. The queues have improved dramatically‚Äîno more long waits, which was fantastic.

**Toilets:**  
Much improved compared to previous years. In one week, I only encountered a single ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go in there‚Äù situation, even at the Main Stage.

**Crowd:**  
Friendly and perfectly balanced‚Äînot overcrowded like last year, yet still buzzing with energy.

**Overall:**  
I‚Äôll gladly return next year. Ozora remains my personal favorite festival‚Äîit‚Äôs pure magic.

# Boom + Ozora Back-to-Back

How did it feel doing both in a row?  
In one word: amazing.

If you ask me how my holiday was, I‚Äôll tell you‚ÄîI lived at my fullest. I cried, I laughed, I loved, and I danced. I was 100% present. I‚Äôm incredibly thankful for everything that happened in those 2.5 weeks.

I‚Äôd do it again‚Äîbut you have to party smart, or you‚Äôll burn out before the end.

 __Seeking honest feedback on an app idea__

Hey everyone,
I'm a developer and I've been kicking around an idea for a tool to solve some of my own career frustrations. I'm trying to figure out if this is a ""just me"" problem or something others would find genuinely useful before I go and build it.

**The core idea**: An AI-powered career copilot for developers.
Instead of just helping you write code, it would help you build your entire career. Here's the MVP concept:

 * Deep Profile Analysis: You upload your resume and connect your GitHub/LeetCode. The AI doesn't just read it; it analyzes it. It gives you real feedback like: ""Your GitHub has a lot of forked tutorial repos. To stand out, try adding these features to Project X, or contribute to this specific open-source issue that matches your skillset.""
 * Personalized Learning Roadmap: Based on your profile and goals (e.g., ""I want to become a Senior Data Scientist""), it builds an interactive, Duolingo-style roadmap. It identifies your knowledge gaps and gives you a clear path with curated resources for each step, followed by AI-powered quizzes to check your understanding.
 * Realistic Mock Interviews: Two key modes:
   * DSA: The AI acts as an interviewer, asking you relevant questions based on your target role/YOE, and probes you on complexity and optimizations.
   * System Design: The AI gives you a prompt (e.g., ""Design TinyURL""), provides a collaborative whiteboard, and asks clarifying questions just like a real interviewer would.

My Questions for You:
 * Is this actually useful? Or is it just another shiny AI tool that you'd never use?
 * What's the most compelling feature here? The roadmap, the GitHub analysis, the mock interviews? What's missing?
 * The Big Question: Would you pay for this? I'd have to cover AI API costs, servers, etc. I'm thinking of a small monthly subscription (like the price of a couple of coffees). Is that something you'd consider if it genuinely helped you level up or land a better job?
I'm trying to validate this before I build an MVP. I'd appreciate any brutally honest feedback you have.
Thanks!

TL;DR: I'm thinking of building an AI career coach that analyzes your resume/GitHub, creates a personalized learning roadmap, and runs realistic mock interviews.
Fetches the best job links (future version). Would you use it? Would you pay a small monthly fee for it?",1,1754647805.0,SideProject,0,1.0,False

She stood near the stadium entrance, wearing a bright yellow jersey and a smile that could make you forget the scoreline. I don‚Äôt even remember who scored for Kenya‚Äî all I remember is how she waved at me as if we‚Äôd known each other forever.

33M, I lost my job in August last year because I was pushed out by a new manager who had it in for me and tried to force me into a performance improvement plan (PIP) which I never got and rather than face it I chose to resign because I felt it was delaying the inevitable. 

I was placed on gardening leave immediately, paid through the end of last year. All of that money (and then some) went to taxes. I lost my visa status, so I had to leave the country, packed up my house, ended my lease, and my furniture is in storage, which I pay for monthly. 

I haven‚Äôt earned anything since last August and am running through savings. Soon, I‚Äôll have to dip into investments. I fear I may have to empty my stored belongings if this continues (not sell, but literally dump). I‚Äôm fortunate to have a privileged background, so I‚Äôm not homeless, but I live with my parents in another country where I know no one and have effectively been isolated since the start of the year, aside from a few trips to see friends in other parts of the world. While other people are getting married, having kids, traveling and enjoying life, I‚Äôm sitting and rotting away. A year ago I was in the greatest financial position of my life and now a sizable portion of that is gone. 

I‚Äôve applied for 2200+ jobs in 12 months across countries. A few interviews, but roles were canceled, filled internally, or I was ghosted. Only one outright rejection last week after wasting two months, they rejected me once they saw my last salary was too high, despite my willingness to accept a pay cut. I can‚Äôt get hired anywhere. I have a bachelor‚Äôs and master‚Äôs degree, leadership experience, technical skills, and multi-industry expertise. My network isn‚Äôt helping because there are no open roles. The market is stagnant.

In the last 8 months, I‚Äôve missed friends‚Äô life events ‚Äî birthdays, baby showers, holiday plans, and I‚Äôm on track to miss a friend‚Äôs wedding who I‚Äôve known for almost 20 years because it‚Äôs halfway across the world and it would be a huge financial and time commitment. If I was employed, I would have definitely attended. I‚Äôm trying to save money because I don‚Äôt know how long this will last. I haven‚Äôt bought anything substantial in a year. I‚Äôve given up hobbies and mostly just read, play video games, and get drunk every two weeks. I have a family holiday coming up next week and I wanted to buy a camera but it kills me that I shouldn‚Äôt buy it to stay financially responsible. 

Lately, I break down randomly at night. My sleep suffers, and I have no appetite. Today, aside from coffee, I‚Äôve eaten nothing and stayed in bed all day. It‚Äôs depressing. I‚Äôm so fed up with life. My thoughts grow darker and hopeless every day.

# A New Front Door for Your Business

People are starting to use AI chatbots for everything, including finding local businesses. Instead of typing a search into a browser, they are asking a chatbot to recommend a good plumber, a cozy coffee shop, or a reliable mechanic. This shift means that if your business is not visible to these AI systems, you are missing out on a growing stream of potential customers. Getting your business suggested by an AI is the new word-of-mouth, and it is time to make sure your business is part of the conversation.

Think of it as a new kind of optimization. For years, we have focused on making our websites friendly for search engines. Now, we need to apply a similar mindset to making our businesses friendly for AI. The principles are related but have their own unique twists. It is about building a digital presence so strong and clear that an AI, when asked, points customers directly to your door. This guide will walk you through the steps to make that happen.

# How AI Models Learn About Your Business

# The AI's Knowledge Base

AI models like ChatGPT do not browse the internet in real time when you ask a question. Instead, they rely on a massive library of information they were trained on. This training data includes a huge portion of the public internet, captured at a specific point in time. This means the AI‚Äôs knowledge about your business comes from the digital footprint you have already created.

If your online information is sparse, inconsistent, or buried in a poorly designed website, the AI will have a hard time understanding what you do and why you are a good choice. It builds its understanding by connecting dots from various places. The more clear and consistent those dots are, the more confident the AI becomes in recommending you.

# Primary Sources for Business Information

AI systems pull from a wide variety of online sources to build a profile of your business. They are looking for patterns and corroborating details across multiple platforms. The most common sources include:

* **Online Business Directories:**¬†Platforms like Google Business Profile, Yelp, Bing Places for Business, and industry-specific directories are gold mines of structured information.
* **Your Company Website:**¬†The AI reads your ""About Us"" page, service descriptions, contact information, and blog posts to understand your offerings and expertise.
* **Customer Review Platforms:**¬†Sites like Trustpilot, G2, and the review sections of directories provide the AI with social proof and sentiment analysis about your quality of service.
* **News Articles and Press Releases:**¬†Mentions in local news, industry publications, or official press releases signal authority and relevance.
* **Social Media Profiles:**¬†Your business profiles on platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram offer additional context about your brand‚Äôs personality and engagement.
* **Forums and Q&A Sites:**¬†Discussions on Reddit or answers on Quora where your business is mentioned can also contribute to the AI‚Äôs understanding, especially for niche industries.

# Why Consistency Is Your Greatest Asset

Imagine you have two different addresses listed online, or your phone number is incorrect on a major directory. For a human, this might be a minor inconvenience. For an AI, it is a major red flag. Inconsistencies create uncertainty, and an AI is programmed to provide confident, reliable answers.

When an AI sees conflicting Name, Address, and Phone number (NAP) details, it lowers its trust score for your business. It cannot be sure which information is correct, so it will likely recommend a competitor with a more consistent and trustworthy digital presence. A thorough audit of your online presence to correct these discrepancies is the first and most critical step.

# Building a Rock-Solid Digital Foundation

# Dominate Your Online Directory Listings

Your profiles on business directories are the bedrock of your AI visibility strategy. These platforms provide structured, easy-to-digest information that AIs love. Getting these right is not optional.

**Google Business Profile (GBP):**¬†This is the most significant directory. A well-optimized GBP can heavily influence both traditional search and AI recommendations.

1. **Claim and Verify Your Profile:**¬†If you have not already, claim your business listing and complete the verification process.
2. **Complete Every Section:**¬†Do not skip any fields. Fill out your business name, address, phone number, website, and hours of operation with perfect accuracy.
3. **Choose the Right Categories:**¬†Select the primary and secondary categories that best describe your business. Be specific. Instead of ""Restaurant,"" choose ""Italian Restaurant.""
4. **Write a Detailed Description:**¬†Use the description field to explain what your business does, who you serve, and what makes you unique. Use natural language, not just a list of keywords.
5. **Upload High-Quality Photos:**¬†Add pictures of your storefront, products, team, and happy customers. This adds a layer of authenticity.

**Other Key Directories:**¬†Do not stop at Google. Create or update your profiles on Yelp, Bing Places, Apple Maps, and any directories specific to your industry, like TripAdvisor for travel or Houzz for home improvement. Keep the information identical across all platforms.

# Design a Website That Speaks to AI

Your website is your digital headquarters. It should be a rich source of truth for both human visitors and AI crawlers.

**Use Clear, Descriptive Language:**¬†Avoid overly clever marketing jargon. Describe your products and services in straightforward terms. If you are a bakery, use words like ""freshly baked bread,"" ""custom cakes,"" and ""sourdough starter,"" not just ""artisanal baked goods."" The AI needs concrete terms to categorize your business correctly.

**Structure Your Site Logically:**¬†A clean site structure helps AIs find what they need. Make sure you have these essential pages:

* **Homepage:**¬†A clear overview of who you are and what you do.
* **About Us:**¬†A detailed story about your business, its mission, and the people behind it. This builds trust.
* **Services/Products:**¬†Dedicated pages for each of your main offerings. Describe them in detail.
* **Contact Us:**¬†Your full NAP information, an embedded map, and a contact form. Make this page easy to find.

**Implement Schema Markup:**¬†Schema markup is a type of code you add to your website to help search engines and AIs understand your content better. It is like adding little labels to your information. For example, you can label your address as an ""address,"" your phone number as a ""phone number,"" and your business hours as ""opening hours."" This removes any ambiguity and makes your data much easier for machines to process.

# Creating Content That Captures AI Attention

# Become the Answer to Customer Questions

AI models are designed to answer questions. The best way to get recommended is to be the source of the best answers. This means shifting your content strategy from just selling to also educating and informing.

**Develop a Robust FAQ Page:**¬†Brainstorm every possible question a customer might have about your business, your services, or your industry. Create a comprehensive FAQ page with clear, concise answers. Think about questions like:

* What areas do you serve?
* What are your payment options?
* How does your process work?
* What makes your product different from competitors?

**Write Authoritative Blog Posts:**¬†A blog is a powerful tool for demonstrating your expertise. Write articles that solve problems for your target audience. A roofing company could write about ""How to Spot a Roof Leak Early."" A financial advisor could write about ""Common Mistakes to Avoid in Your 30s."" This type of content positions you as an expert, a quality that AIs are trained to recognize and reward.

# Emphasize Your Local Connection

For brick-and-mortar businesses, proving your local relevance is key. You need to create strong connections between your business and its physical location in your online content.

**Incorporate Local Keywords Naturally:**¬†Mention your city, neighborhood, and nearby landmarks in your website copy and blog posts. For example, a coffee shop in Brooklyn could write a blog post about ""The Best Parks Near Williamsburg to Enjoy a Cold Brew.""

**Showcase Community Involvement:**¬†If you sponsor a local sports team, participate in a community event, or partner with another local business, write about it. This creates a rich web of local connections that signals to an AI that you are an active and integrated part of the community, making you a great local recommendation.

# Build Authority with Mentions and Backlinks

An AI determines your business's authority in part by seeing who else is talking about you. Mentions from other reputable websites act as votes of confidence.

**Seek Out Local Press:**¬†Reach out to local bloggers, news outlets, or community newsletters. Offer to be a source for a story or share an interesting update about your business, like an anniversary or a new service launch. A feature in a local publication is a powerful authority signal.

**Collaborate with Non-Competing Businesses:**¬†Partner with other local businesses for a joint promotion or event. When you both write about it on your websites and link to each other, you are building a stronger local network that benefits both of you in the eyes of an AI.

**Get Listed in ""Best Of"" Roundups:**¬†Many local blogs and publications create lists of the ""Best Pizza in Town"" or ""Top 10 Boutiques."" Find these lists and see if you can get your business included. These are highly valuable endorsements.

# Advanced Tactics for Long-Term Success

# Leverage the Power of Public Relations

A strategic approach to public relations can create high-authority data points about your business. Unlike a blog post you write yourself, a news article written by a journalist is seen as a more objective and therefore more trustworthy source.

**Distribute Press Releases for Milestones:**¬†When your business does something newsworthy, write and distribute a press release. This could be for a grand opening, a major new hire, a charitable donation, or the launch of a new product. These releases are often picked up by online news aggregators, spreading authoritative information about your company.

**Position Yourself as an Expert Source:**¬†Offer your expertise to journalists and writers in your field. You can use services that connect reporters with sources. Being quoted in an article not only provides a valuable backlink but also establishes you as a thought leader, which AIs are designed to recognize.

# Maintain and Refresh Your Digital Identity

Optimizing your business for AI is not a set-it-and-forget-it task. The digital world is constantly changing, and your business information needs to be kept up to date.

**Conduct Regular Audits:**¬†At least twice a year, perform a thorough audit of your business‚Äôs online presence. Search for your company name and check all the top results for accuracy. Use a spreadsheet to track your listings across different directories and make sure every detail is consistent.

**Keep Your Content Current:**¬†Do not let your website get stale. Regularly add new blog posts, update your service descriptions, and post fresh photos. If your hours change for a holiday, update them everywhere online. This constant activity signals to AIs that your business is active and relevant.

# Monitor Your AI Reputation

You need to know what the AIs are saying about you. Periodically check in and see how your efforts are paying off.

**Ask for Recommendations:**¬†Go to different AI chatbots and ask them for recommendations in your business category and location. Phrase your questions in different ways, just like a real customer would. For example:

* ""Can you recommend a good Italian restaurant in downtown Austin?""
* ""Who is the most reliable plumber in the San Fernando Valley?""
* ""I'm looking for a boutique hotel for a weekend trip to Savannah.""

**Analyze the Results:**¬†When the AI gives you an answer, study it. Are you on the list? If so, what positive things is it saying? If not, who is being recommended instead? Look at the online presence of the businesses that are being suggested. They are your blueprint for what the AI is currently rewarding. Use this information to find gaps in your own strategy and refine your approach. This is an ongoing feedback loop that will keep you ahead of the curve.

I recently ordered a df83 gen 2 (I got a pretty good deal, 300 euros for it).
I'm not sure what to do with my old grinders.
I previously used a mignon classico for espresso and my old Graef cm702 for filter coffee.

We make mostly espresso, sometimes filter.

I see three setups :
- DF-83 only (it doesn't seem too difficult to switch between grinding levels)

-DF-83 with mignon + filter burrs for filter coffee 

-DF-83 + CM for filter coffee 

What do you think I should do ?

1mkr4d1,https://www.reddit.com/r/badreviewer/comments/1mkr4d1/innoview_59_portable_perfection/,InnoView: $59 Portable Perfection?,"I needed a second monitor for my cramped apartment workspace, and the [InnoView Portable Monitor](https://amzn.to/4mCHRGl) at $59 seemed like a gamble worth taking.  I primarily use it for light productivity tasks and occasional movie watching, not demanding graphic design or video editing.  I tested it over two weeks, connecting it to both my laptop and desktop PC.

## Display Quality

The 15.6-inch screen isn't going to win any awards, but for the price, it's surprisingly decent.  Colors aren't incredibly vibrant, and viewing angles are somewhat limited; you'll notice some color shifting if you're not looking directly at it.  However, the resolution is acceptable for everyday use, and text is sharp enough for comfortable reading.  For casual use and productivity tasks, the display is perfectly adequate.  I wouldn't recommend this monitor for professional color-critical work, though.

## Connectivity & Setup

Setting up the InnoView was a breeze.  It boasts both HDMI and USB-C ports, making it compatible with a wide range of devices.  I experienced no issues connecting it to either my laptop or desktop. The single USB-C port is also used for power, which means you only need one cable for both video and power in some cases, simplifying the setup considerably.  The minimalist design is also a big plus‚Äîno confusing buttons or settings to navigate.

## Portability & Build

The monitor's lightweight design and slim profile make it incredibly portable.  I easily slipped it into my laptop bag and carried it to coffee shops for work.  The build quality feels a little plasticky, but it's sturdy enough for everyday use and held up well to my travel testing.  However, I wouldn't recommend tossing it carelessly into a bag; some better protection might be needed for prolonged travel.

## Brightness & Viewing Angles

Brightness levels are sufficient for indoor use, though it might struggle in very bright environments.  The screen's matte finish helps reduce glare, which is a nice touch. As mentioned previously, viewing angles are average; you will experience a slight loss of color accuracy and contrast if you view it from an angle.

## Value for Money

At $59, the InnoView Portable Monitor offers remarkable value.  Most rivals in this price range either lack essential features like USB-C connectivity or suffer from significantly lower image quality.  While it doesn't match the performance of higher-end portable monitors, it provides a functional and portable display for casual use, light productivity, or secondary screen needs.  Consider this an excellent budget-friendly option.

## Response Time & Flicker

The response time is adequate for general use and productivity tasks. I experienced no significant ghosting or lag during my testing.  I did not notice any noticeable screen flicker either.  However, it's not suited for fast-paced gaming or video editing that demands low response times.

## Stand & Ergonomics

The InnoView comes with a built-in stand that allows for slight tilt adjustments.  While it's not the most ergonomic setup, it's adequate for basic use.  The lack of height adjustment is a minor drawback.  Consider purchasing a third-party stand for better ergonomics, though.

**Pros:**

* Excellent price-to-performance ratio.
* Easy setup and connectivity (HDMI and USB-C).
* Surprisingly decent display quality for the price.
* Lightweight and portable.
* Simple design.

**Cons:**

* Viewing angles could be better.
* Limited brightness and build quality.
* No height adjustment on the stand.

**Value Proposition & Price Analysis:**

At $59, the InnoView is a steal.  Compared to most rivals in the sub-$100 portable monitor market, it offers a superior combination of features, connectivity options, and acceptable image quality.  This makes it a value leader in its price bracket.  While it‚Äôs not the best portable monitor overall, it completely satisfies its intended purpose for casual and light productivity users and offers excellent value for the money.

**Final Verdict & Recommendation:**

The InnoView Portable Monitor is a surprising winner at this price point. It's not perfect, but it delivers on its promise of affordability and portability without compromising too much on quality. I highly recommend this monitor to students, casual users, and anyone who needs a budget-friendly secondary screen for productivity or media consumption.

1mkqy4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1mkqy4u/would_variable_uk_business_property_rates_work/,Would variable UK Business Property Rates work?,"Curious. Was listening to a podcast from a small business owner who is crippled by property rates on their high street shop. Meanwhile, rates are barely a blip for the multi-national chain fast food place a few doors down. 

Would variable business rates, based on the scale of the business occupying the property be a viable means of firstly, collecting higher tax revenue, and secondly, giving smaller businesses a fighting chance to compete on the UK's commonly dying out high street? 

IE, McDonalds pays significantly higher, say 5-10 times, business rates that an independant pays, because bigger businesses already established should be fit to shoulder that cost. Why wouldn't it work as a net benefit for all?

Qualifying factors could be;

* Is the parent company name (IE, so it can't be tied to a single franchise) stock exchange listed anywhere globally? You pay top rates at 10x lowest rate. 
* Does the parent company have greater than 500 locations nationwide? You pay 2nd highest. 
* Does the Parent company have 250+ UK wide locations? You pay 3rd highest. 
* Scaling down to sub 10, and finally independant. 

If it upsets say Starbucks, as an example, and they close a location. Fine? The UK population will still have a demand for coffee, and if it frees up a retail unit for a smaller independent in a city centre location, then surely that's better for local wealth creation than another 0.001% added to the balance sheet of a multinational megacorp with tens of thousands of other global locations? And stops whatever tax / financial fuckery a multinational chain does to avoid tax anyway.

1mkqxp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mkqxp1/i_got_blindly_accused_of_stealing/,I got blindly accused of stealing.,"I don't even know how to start this. It will be a long post and I'm sorry for that.

Recently my husband and I got back from his sister's house. Since my husband is moving to my country, we took some of his belongings and his late father's belongings too. We stayed there for a few months. 

For some background, I come from a poorer country. I grew up very poor. We didn't have a lot at home. My parents had to make many sacrifices for me. 

However, everything I have accomplished was with honest, hard work. I worked abroad at the age of 18 to help my family and to get myself ready for graduation so they don't have to spend a lot of money on my dress and accessories. I worked long night shifts to pay for college even when my late grandpa helped with my tuition sometimes. I worked overtime and even weeks with no break in-between. For my master's degree, I also worked and paid for my tuition there too while studying. When I was younger, there would be temptations all around me to make ""dirty"" money. But I never gave into that. I was never raised that way. In school, I had good grades that landed me scholarships. When I graduated from high school, I had a good final grade and my high school gave me a final scholarship too. A small amount of money. All I wanted then was to do well in school, to get educated, to work hard, to make a career for myself and to make my parents proud of me. In my family, we pride ourselves on our hard working and honesty. 

 When my father (rest in peace) got sick, my teenage years were spent in hospitals, at pharmacies, helping him get groceries, etc while my mom worked her a$$ off to support us. I'd give 50% of my paychecks to them to afford medication, pay bills, put food on the table. The first time I actually went to a caf√©, was when I was 18 working abroad. I sat at the caf√© corner, with a bottle of coke and a cup of coffee and I felt like a normal human being. I cried that day.

When my father died when I was 22, my mom and I paid for the funeral, but I had to do most documentation, I had to go through hell and back alone while juggling work, social life (which at that point I barely had), university, home, helping my mom get through it all. Never, even at my lowest, would I ever think of stealing or committing any foul deed.

But. My parents raised me right. They raised me to obey rules and understand consequences, to be honest, to use my head and do the right thing, to never steal, to always ask before taking anything. 

And I did. When we were there, I'd always ask if I can take anything. Even food. I would always ask. 

Everything I have taken with me was either things my husband bought me, things from free pantries/charities or things that were given to me when nobody wanted them. I was never there to take other people's belongings because I know that they've paid for them and worked for them. Despite some presumptions I'd hear about me from some of my husband's family. Things like I'm with him for a green card or money. I have my master's degree, I speak multiple languages, I have a lot of experience under my belt. If I wanted money, I can make it myself. I have a home. I am with my husband because he stayed with me through thick and thin. He loved me and still loves me as much as I love him too. We have a great relationship and communication. Many times when I'd ask to see something, out of curiosity or to see if I can fix something like a pair of sandals that were uncomfortable for my SIL, I'd be looked at like I'm there to steal their food, or items. 

So what happened is that instead of asking me like a human being if we had accidentally taken my mom-in-law's wedding band while packing, my husband and I got blocked off of every social media and in a text message aimed to me was ""Why did she take mom's ring?"" from my SIL

I love my mom in law, I helped take care of her. She's going through a mental issue and sometimes I'd talk to her about her late husband whom she wholeheartedly loved. Just to reminisce about the times she was happier.

While I was there I'd help as much as possible. Looking after my nephews, cook, clean, help with errands. I had bought my mom in law and everyone jewelry and gifts from abroad too. 

I never took anything without permission. Again, I was raised to always ask. My husband took his dad's wedding bands but he is my SILs brother. She knew about that. This is between them. 

I ask myself, why? Why reach out like that? Why directly assume it was me? After everything I've done for everyone, why assume such a horrible thing about me? Why couldn't she ask me if we took anything that we didn't ask for like I'm a human being?  Why did she made me trust her and believe she likes me and that we're friends and then spit in my face, and in my parents' faces, and my country like that? Why couldn't we just hold a normal conversation and clear things out instead of throwing such an accusation?

Is it because I'm from a poorer country? Is it the crap she may have heard from the same people who blindly before even meeting me has presumptions about me? Why would I throw sand in my MILs eyes like that and take something so valuable to her when I love her so much? What kind of a monster did she think I was? 

My husband defended me. He always has. I feel so bad that he'd be treated this way from his own flesh and blood he truly loved.

I don't know how to feel. I feel betrayed, hurt, disappointed. I feel like all my good deeds have gone unnoticed all because of an assumption. All the times I was there for them and done so much and she'd make mee feel comfortable, liked accepted for who I am and all of a sudden, without even reaching out and asking, she'd just spit in my face. All because of an assumption. I really feel hurt and sickened. I feel so much yet nothing at all. I don't know how to process this. 

My mom and dad made sure I have good morals, to empathize, and such an offense not only hurts me, but also the people who created me and made so many sacrifices and compromises to put me in the right way and teach me to do the right thing.

1mkqwke,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/1mkqwke/just_launched_my_indie_puzzle_game_triple_airport/,Just launched my indie puzzle game ‚Äî Triple Airport. Would love your feedback!,"Hi everyone,

After countless late nights and way too much coffee, I‚Äôve finally launched my small side project.  
It‚Äôs called **Triple Airport**, a casual puzzle game where you merge three planes of the same level to upgrade them into a higher-level plane.  
It features a clean design and an addictive gameplay loop that keeps you coming back for ‚Äújust one more try.‚Äù

**Why I made it**  
I enjoy merge-style games, but I wanted something with more variety in its elements so players can strategize while still being able to enjoy quick, satisfying play sessions.  
So I handled everything myself ‚Äî from planning and design to background music, sound effects, and development ‚Äî focusing on a fast-paced flow, a relaxing atmosphere, and a smooth, minimal UI.

**What you can do in Triple Airport**

* Merge three planes of the same level to upgrade into a higher-level plane
* Grow trees and improve the environment around your airport
* Go for a high score and see how long you can last with strategic moves

**Play here**

* iOS: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/triple-airport/id6745180149](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/triple-airport/id6745180149)

If you try it out, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate your feedback ‚Äî especially on the difficulty balance and overall fun factor.

Thanks for reading, and I hope it brings you a few minutes of enjoyment!

Hey everyone,
I'm a developer and I've been kicking around an idea for a tool to solve some of my own career frustrations. I'm trying to figure out if this is a ""just me"" problem or something others would find genuinely useful before I go and build it.

**The core idea**: An AI-powered career copilot for developers.
Instead of just helping you write code, it would help you build your entire career. Here's the MVP concept:

 * Deep Profile Analysis: You upload your resume and connect your GitHub/LeetCode. The AI doesn't just read it; it analyzes it. It gives you real feedback like: ""Your GitHub has a lot of forked tutorial repos. To stand out, try adding these features to Project X, or contribute to this specific open-source issue that matches your skillset.""
 * Personalized Learning Roadmap: Based on your profile and goals (e.g., ""I want to become a Senior Data Scientist""), it builds an interactive, Duolingo-style roadmap. It identifies your knowledge gaps and gives you a clear path with curated resources for each step, followed by AI-powered quizzes to check your understanding.
 * Realistic Mock Interviews: Two key modes:
   * DSA: The AI acts as an interviewer, asking you relevant questions based on your target role/YOE, and probes you on complexity and optimizations.
   * System Design: The AI gives you a prompt (e.g., ""Design TinyURL""), provides a collaborative whiteboard, and asks clarifying questions just like a real interviewer would.

My Questions for You:
 * Is this actually useful? Or is it just another shiny AI tool that you'd never use?
 * What's the most compelling feature here? The roadmap, the GitHub analysis, the mock interviews? What's missing?
 * The Big Question: Would you pay for this? I'd have to cover AI API costs, servers, etc. I'm thinking of a small monthly subscription (like the price of a couple of coffees). Is that something you'd consider if it genuinely helped you level up or land a better job?
I'm trying to validate this before I build an MVP. I'd appreciate any brutally honest feedback you have.
Thanks!

TL;DR: I'm thinking of building an AI career coach that analyzes your resume/GitHub, creates a personalized learning roadmap, and runs realistic mock interviews.
Fetches the best job links (future version). Would you use it? Would you pay a small monthly fee for it?",0,1754646402.0,learnprogramming,5,0.2,False

Some atrocities of my reporting officer where I quit recently:

-Nobody is allowed to have independent thoughts. We are all there to just implement what he says. No scope for discussion. 

-Every/Any work completed will be claimed as under his Godly supervision. Actual contributors ignored always. 

-Boss intimidates everyone saying he is close to the management. Always tells everyone ‚ÄúCan get you kicked in 2 mins. ‚Äú

-Boss always tells in open meetings that he is completely aware of what everyone is speaking about him and what everyone is doing. 

-Go through internet logs and intimidate staff who use bank/irctc websites. 

-Always has a bunch of ‚Äúyes men‚Äù around who clap for everything he does. Our office groups are full of praise for this person‚Äôs ‚Äúaccomplishments ‚Äú. 

-Loyalty measured through silence not contributions. 

-Call for special food during meetings eat in-front of everyone while making sounds. Call for special tea/coffee during meetings and drink in front of everyone while feeling his privilege. 
 
-Hikes given only to those who praise and remain silent. 

-HR department for namesake -  just to give warnings to those who oppose. 

-His birthday will be cringe. His minions always on a mission to collect money which should beat last year collection. Never seen a  boss who accepts gifts from people reporting to him as a right.

1mkqtbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPylori/comments/1mkqtbx/one_year_of_hypothyroidism_and_helicobacter/,One year of hypothyroidism and helicobacter,"Last August I was informed I had hypothyroidism, this was after a really bad month with drastically worsening digestive symptoms. I will spare a lot of the details on my hypothyroidism journey as I‚Äôm just trying to share details of how (& if) it relates to my problems with helicobacter. 

I was put on levothyroxine which I‚Äôll likely be taking for life now, first two days I was on 100 but the second day I thought I was going to die I had unceasing rolling panic attacks for 24 hours I could not get my heart rate down nor stable. I had this cold sensation in my upper chest and thought I was legitimately having a heart attack (very experienced with panic attacks and what they feel like for me). Following this, I reduced my Levo to 50 which is what I‚Äôve been on for this whole year since (stable and normal thyroid levels now, thankfully). But, I continued to have discomfort in my left collarbone area every other day during that time. It took me a few weeks to link it to eating and noticing it more after meals. 

Over winter I met with my GP and tried to restrict my diet as recommended to reduce these symptoms. It was talked about simply as acid reflux. A result of my rather extreme thyroid levels pre-medication. Helicobacter had not been mentioned at this point. By January I had stopped my morning coffee, no alcohol (I drank rarely by this time anyway), cut as much acidic and fatty food as I could but still would get this same collarbone burning discomfort. Most of the time I wouldn‚Äôt call it ‚Äòpain‚Äô pain, it wasn‚Äôt brutal - I‚Äôve had gastritis in the past at the start of the pandemic whilst I was a healthcare worker and extremely stressed - but it ranged from annoying discomfort 3/10 to some days it would become strong unpleasant 7/10. I was prescribed omeprazole in December I believe, for a fortnight, and then again in January/February I took it for a month. Briefly beneficial but within days to a week or so my symptoms returned. 

I was first tested for helicobacter in March, results were positive. I was tested because these symptoms wouldn‚Äôt go away even with my diet being good, I‚Äôm a routine exerciser, and generally a healthy and active 30 y/o, with my thyroid levels stable for months now. Symptoms were mainly the collarbone pain but I also am always quite burpy, was feeling bloated a lot, still struggling with routine bowel movements. I began 3 different antibiotics for a week alongside omeprazole. Felt like my stomach had been nuked. I was already sick of omeprazole, that feeling of food just sitting there in your stomach not digesting. I continued my diet of morning oats & yogurt, lentil and bone broth soups for lunch, and some low acid & low fat dinner. 

That was four months ago. It took some weeks to get over the antibiotics I think. Things seemed to be getting better so I continued what I was doing. Every so often I would try to introduce something into my diet, namely I had four tablespoons worth of my partners coffee I make her because god I miss coffee. This went well for a week before my collarbone discomfort came back so I stopped the watered-down coffee. Since around late June or early July I noticed my symptoms were fairly back to their frustrating norm. I then twigged I didn‚Äôt get retested for helicobacter to see if it went away. I guess because things got better I assumed it worked and focussed on my diet, etc. So, last week I tested for helicobacter (stool test) and have tested negative. Which is surprising to me. 

I was briefly on omeprazole in July as I‚Äôd developed a new discomfort swallowing in one spot in my throat, initially freaked out I had cancer but the GP thinks it is another silent reflux symptom, after a few weeks that seems to have gone away. I started the omeprazole a day or two before asking about a helicobacter retest, when I was reminded to be off omeprazole for a fortnight for this test. So, I took omeprazole for 4 days before stopping for a fortnight. My collarbone discomfort did (& has continued to) mostly go away since then, as it has before on omeprazole. Been back on omeprazole for a few days since my stool test. 

The reason I‚Äôm writing this is to make sense of my current situation: negative test for helicobacter at present, four months after being tested positive and having antibiotic treatment, symptoms had returned until recent weeks where I have been on omeprazole again, but omeprazole is not a longterm fix. I really have suffered on omeprazole, over winter my mood was sour, I felt like shit. I hope to not be on it for too long again, I have a month prescription and hope that‚Äôs the end of it. 

And the reason I am speaking about this with my hypothyroidism is because the collarbone discomfort came up like a few days after starting levothyroxine, it was not a symptom I had before. So, in my head, there seems a link there or it is just incredibly freak timing that my thyroid packed up and my helicobacter infection showed up at the same time. 

From reading people‚Äôs experiences on this sub (first time lurker, I have a history of foul health anxiety and didn‚Äôt want to freak myself out before) it seems it can take some months for things to get better after helicobacter. I guess I am still on that path. This has been a psychologically horrible year filled with so much uncertainty, and physically, it‚Äôs been scary and a lot to process (namely because of the hypothyroidism but helicobacter no doubt had its fun with me too). 

I‚Äôd really appreciate anyone‚Äôs thoughts, reflections, experiences, or advice from what I‚Äôve said. Apologies if this reads a bit messy, I haven‚Äôt done anything like this before. Thank you. ",2,1754646063.0,HPylori,1,1.0,False

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

So, let me ask you this: Do you ever find yourself scrolling through forums or social media, seeing people raking in cash from their AI skills, and think, ‚ÄúWhat the heck am I doing wrong?‚Äù ü§î If you're nodding your head, you‚Äôre definitely not alone. But what if I told you that there are **5 content income streams** that you might be totally sleeping on? üí∏ Yeah, I see you perk up over there!

A little backstory on why I‚Äôm passionate about this‚ÄîI've been developing my skills in AI for ages, but it wasn‚Äôt until I connected a few dots that I realized I could actually profit from my hobby. So, grab your favorite beverage, and let‚Äôs jump in! Here‚Äôs my no-nonsense guide to some seriously underestimated ways to turn your passion into real cash. 

1. **AI-Generated eBooks** üìö  
   Why spend months writing when AI can crank out content for you? Pick a niche you're passionate about, let AI help you draft chapters, and voil√†‚Äîthere‚Äôs your eBook! Platforms like Kindle Direct Publishing can have you making sales while you sleep!

2. **Social Media Content Creation** üì±  
   Ever tried generating snappy posts or memes using AI? You would be surprised how many small businesses need help with their online presence. Offer a service to create engaging AI-generated content for their channels, and who knows? You might just build a steady client base.

3. **Online Courses & Tutorials** üéì  
   With a little creativity and your AI knowledge, why not design an online course? Platforms like Udemy or Teachable make it super easy to get your content out there. Plus, you can use AI to handle assignments or create quizzes‚Äîtalk about working smarter!

4. **Subscription Newsletters** ‚úâÔ∏è  
   Are you already churning out AI insights or tips? Why not package that wisdom into a paid subscription newsletter? Services like Substack make it easy for you to monetize your expertise, and the best part? You can automate a lot of the content using AI.

5. **Affiliate Marketing with AI Tools** ü§ù  
   If you‚Äôre using AI tools (and let's be honest, we all are), why not share that love? You can find affiliate programs with companies offering AI tools you would recommend anyway. Get paid whenever someone takes your advice‚Äîit‚Äôs like earning extra cash for recommending your favorite coffee!

I have to say, I‚Äôve personally dabbled in a couple of these and the results have been eye-opening. ü§© Just keep in mind, it‚Äôs not all rainbows and butterflies. **Starting out means a lot of trial and error**, and you may need to hustle a bit. But isn‚Äôt that part of the fun?

So, if you‚Äôre out there feeling like you‚Äôre just floating in the AI sea, remember these income streams. They could be the lifeboat you didn't even know you needed to shore up your finances. Why not seize the opportunity before everyone else catches on? For real, why not? üòÑ

Each of these ideas can be molded to fit your unique style, so let your imagination run wild! And I‚Äôm super curious‚Äîsince we‚Äôre all friends here, what AI gigs have you tried? Anything you‚Äôd add to this list from your own experience?",1,1754645781.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

It's kinda embarrasing to admit, but I sttill have this quigky little habit of talking to my childhod teddy bear at night. Yeah, it's as weird as it sounds. Most nihgts, before I drift off, I kinda give my bear a mini recap of the day. Nothnig too deep or profound‚Äîjust the usual stuff, like how my coffee tasted way better todday or how my latest Netflix binge has totally hooked me.

It makes me wonder, thouggh... is this just nostalgia whispering back, or maybe a comforting routine like slipping into a pair of cozy soks? It's odd, but I guess there's something to be said for a bit of childlike comfort in such a wild world. Maybe we all, in our own ways, hold onto threads that connect us to who we were.

So, to you, fellow midnight musers or those with their own quirky comforts, I wonder what little rituals keep you grounded. Do you ever find yourself pondering just how tyese small moments tie us back to a simpler time? Talk about an existential sidetrack, huh? ü§î

We booked a nice airbnb. The host greeted us and was very friendly to us all, spent some time chatting upon check in. Odd messages here and there were sent regarding house specific things as well he sent photos and videos of his incredible new build next door (very wealthy). This was all interesting and he seemed lovely. Great host. Anyway, after check out I left a review as you do and mentioned the couches not comfortable to which he text me days later and said he was sorry we were uncomfortable. I said nothing much to worry about. He said also that he happened to think I‚Äôd be great to work for him and would I like to meet for coffee to ‚Äòsit down and talk real-estate‚Äô - I don‚Äôt work in real estate and told him this. I politely declined to which he then said he has other opportunities within my field of work. I was polite and grateful but said unless specific to my needs to keep me posted but left it there. Nothing more. He said that‚Äôs a shame as he thinks I‚Äôd be incredible. Whatever though, nice but I‚Äôm onto this sort of charm from guys especially wealthy ones trying to impress. All was left at that. Anyway in order to not be weird I thought best to just leave the messages on my phone as if it ever came about that I deleted messages or tried to hide it that would look weird. My husband had to borrow my phone just yesterday for which I happily gave it to him. I never hide my phone and wouldn‚Äôt care what he needed there. He saw the messages and freaked out. Got incredibly upset and was very disappointed in me. Couldn‚Äôt believe what I‚Äôd done and how I didn‚Äôt tell him about the messages. I didn‚Äôt tell him because he can be very jealous and overreact at anything to do with another man. I thought best to not cause any arguments or drama for something that was brushed aside and not really an issue for me as I‚Äôm well aware of what‚Äôs going on. Anyway, he blew up. Swore at me multiple times, told me to leave our home then that I couldn‚Äôt leave or that would be the end of us (even though he had told me to leave just before this) etc. one hell of a day. Emotionally exhausting. He still cannot believe for any reason why I don‚Äôt tell him and thinks I‚Äôve betrayed his trust. Even though I explained everything and showed him the messages. Plus, as mentioned left them there available in the first place. Other side note. He has in the past been unfaithful via messaging with someone which I didn‚Äôt act to even this extent about and we had moved on from this. I have no history of this nature.

My name is Tina.

My main job is working as a print model for a modeling agency. During slow seasons, I pick up promotional gigs at newly opened office buildings or real estate showcases around New York City.

Thanks to these jobs, I've gradually gotten to know quite a few celebrities, directors, and socialites.

Clark was a talent scout I met during my modeling career. He was always hanging around the various indoor studios.

Over time, we became casual acquaintances who'd nod at each other whenever we crossed paths. After one commercial shoot ended, he approached me and asked if I'd ever considered breaking into Hollywood.

I glanced him over casually. Light-colored suit, white dress pants, cufflinks fastened tight, but the top button by his collar hung open carelessly. The guy was a walking contradiction.

""Talent scout?"" I leaned against the wardrobe, fishing out my keys to grab my clothes, asking offhandedly.

Honestly, I wasn't interested in his offer. I'd been in this business too long and was way past the age of daydreaming.

Rather than hoping to storm Hollywood and make it big, I was more realistic these days. I'd rather have a few steady advertising clients. At least that way my monthly income would be more reliable.

""Yeah, I'm a talent scout, and I've been watching you for a while. I think it's a waste for you to just do print modeling. Your ability to work with cameras and your natural screen presence - you were born for the big screen. Trust me, I can definitely...""

Clark followed me closely, staying right on my heels as he tried to convince me.

""You can definitely what? Turn me into Hollywood's next big thing?""

I turned back to look at Clark with amusement. While he stood there stunned, I walked straight into the bathroom shower.

As the water started running, I briefly escaped Clark's sales pitch.

Standing under the showerhead, working shampoo into a lather with both hands, I couldn't help but want to laugh.

Hollywood? Please. Been there, done that. I'm the one who got out of Hollywood.

When I leisurely came out of the bathroom, I used a towel to dry the water droplets from the ends of my hair.

Steam swirled around me. Through the wooden door, I glanced around - it was quiet outside, suggesting Clark had probably left.

After getting ready, the moment I stepped out of the bathroom with my canvas bag, I still couldn't help but smile slightly.

Another guy with no patience.

The more I thought about getting rid of the pest, the happier I became. I hummed a little tune as I prepared to leave the studio.

My happiness lasted all of five minutes before I saw Clark standing at the studio entrance, constantly peering inside.

Persistent jerk, I cursed silently.

Instinct made me pause mid-step, but it was too late - he'd spotted me.

He waved frantically at me through the wooden fence.

The security guard at the entrance kept looking back and forth between us with suspicion.

Thank God I'd been coming here to shoot for years, otherwise I probably would've been tossed out as some kind of security threat.

The moment I walked out the main entrance, the guard even poked his head out the window to look at me.

""You okay, miss? Need any help?""

From the guard's posture, if I'd said even one word about needing assistance, he would've charged out of his booth with his security baton to chase away that annoying guy.

I hesitated for a moment, but seeing Clark standing obediently by the fence, looking at me with puppy dog eyes like a golden retriever, I softened.

I said something I didn't really mean.

""No, it's fine. We know each other.""

# Chapter 2 Whatever I Want

The security guard wisely retreated back into his booth. Clark, perhaps feeling encouraged by how I'd just handled the situation, looked at me with twinkling eyes. He studied my expression and then boldly stepped closer, launching back into his usual pitch.

""Just think about it. I've been in this business for years - my eye for talent never fails. You were born for Hollywood.""

I was trying to call a ride on my app. Today's shoot had run later than usual, and if I had to walk the mile to the subway station and then transfer downtown for my next job, I'd definitely be late. Uber was expensive, but keeping a stable side gig with good commission was worth it.

The app kept showing no available drivers. I started checking my watch obsessively. Clark was good at reading people - he figured out my predicament and somehow produced car keys from thin air, dangling them in front of me like a magician.

His voice was full of temptation.

""You can think over my offer during the ride. I'll be your free chauffeur.""

I shamelessly gave in, lifting my chin and letting him play gentleman by opening my car door.

He smoothly opened the passenger door, and as I bent down to get in, he closed it with a mischievous comment.

""Beautiful lady, your carriage awaits.""

Clark's laughter was barely audible, carried away on the wind in an instant.

But I still heard it. My earlobes turned red uncontrollably.

""Smooth talker,"" I cursed silently, afraid he'd notice my reaction. I settled into my seat calmly, pretending I hadn't heard anything. Only I knew how fast my heart was racing.

Seeing that I wasn't reacting, Clark didn't tease me further. He quickly got into the driver's seat and started swiping through the car's navigation system, checking current traffic conditions.

""Tell me where you're headed and I'll set the GPS.""

Clark was fastening his seatbelt as he asked for my destination.

""Paris Tower, that new office building in downtown Manhattan.""

I casually flipped down the sun visor and opened the mirror, pulling out some makeup from my bag.

I'd washed off the dramatic smoky eye makeup in the shower earlier but hadn't had time to redo it in the dressing room. I'd planned to quickly touch up during my subway wait, but now that I was in a private car, I could take my time perfecting my look.

Promotional modeling required lighter makeup - not too heavy, but enough to look good and make customers feel comfortable and confident in my professionalism.

After quickly applying foundation, I used some neutral eyeshadow with a few simple strokes, then started digging through my canvas bag for lipstick.

Out of habit, I always carried two different shades - a classic red for photo shoots and a nude for everyday looks when I just needed a subtle touch.

But today, after searching for ages, I couldn't find either one.

""Damn, someone must have swiped my lipsticks. Didn't even leave me one.""

I couldn't help cursing.

Models sometimes got familiar enough to share makeup, but taking stuff without asking? That was a first for me.

I looked at myself in the mirror. I could get by without lipstick, but I'd look a bit washed out.

I'd been running between two jobs constantly lately, working weekends to make ends meet.

I looked tired and worn out, and without lipstick to help cover that up, I'd probably lose some points on my professional image with clients.

""If you need lipstick, I've got some.""

Clark kept one hand on the wheel, eyes on the road, and used his free hand to quickly open the glove compartment in front of me.

I was stunned.

Inside was an entire arsenal of makeup, neatly organized - lipsticks, eyeshadow palettes, blush, contouring products, and foundation.

On the side was even a makeup brush holder tied with plastic string, containing brushes of all sizes, each carefully wrapped in plastic film to keep them dust-free.

Honestly, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed this was a guy's car.

If I had a car, I don't think I'd have a setup this complete.

""Okay, now I'm starting to believe you really are a professional talent scout.""

""So, have you given any more thought to my suggestion?""

The guy immediately seized the moment to follow up, not letting my compliment make him complacent.

""Uh, Hollywood's a no-go. But if you have any music video work, you can call me.""

""Should I be grateful that even though you rejected my offer, you at least gave me a nice-guy card?""

""You can think of it that way. Don't bother with the parking garage - just drop me at the lobby entrance.""

I spotted the familiar building and directed Clark to pull up to the office tower's entrance. Before getting out, I did one final makeup check, and once satisfied, stepped out to start my second job of the day.

In those few seconds of closing the car door, I flashed him a bright smile.

""Consider it payment for the ride.""

With that, I shut the door and walked into the lobby without looking back.

# Chapter 3 High Stakes, High Rewards

The moment I stepped into the lobby, I could see my coworkers huddled together in small groups, whispering among themselves.

I quietly walked up behind Karen and gave her shoulder a light tap.

She jumped, her back going rigid, but quickly realized it was me and her whole body relaxed.

""What's going on? We're almost at start time and everyone's still standing around talking.""

""The supervisor mentioned there's a Maybach parked in the underground garage. Everyone's trying to figure out which company's CEO is here checking out office space. If someone lands this deal, the commission's going to be huge.""

I nodded knowingly. The Melville Building was right in the heart of downtown, and every square foot of office space here was prime real estate ‚Äì even the corner cubicles cost a fortune, let alone if someone managed to lease out an entire floor.

For any salesperson here, a deal like that would cover their quota for the next six months, easy.

I couldn't help feeling a little excited myself.

After all, nobody's going to complain about having more money in their pocket.

Thank God I'd taken the time to touch up my makeup in Clark's car this morning. I felt pretty grateful for that right now.

I also said a little prayer, hoping today would be my lucky day.

As the grandfather clock in the lobby chimed, everyone instantly snapped to attention.

Time to get to work.

Our part-time real estate gig ran from 1 PM to 5 PM.

We weren't allowed to leave our stations during those hours, and they'd do random appearance checks throughout the day.

The pay was pretty decent though ‚Äì $30 an hour, so $150 a day. Not enough to live luxuriously, but definitely enough to maintain a respectable lifestyle.

If you actually closed a deal that month, commissions started at around $10,000 based on current market rates.

That kind of money was enough to turn everyone here into a pack of wolves hunting for prey.

Karen was no exception. She put on her brightest smile for the random clients trickling in, but I caught her eyes darting toward the entrance every few seconds, ready to sprint toward today's biggest potential client the moment they appeared.

I smirked and started putting on my own customer service smile.

As for landing the big deal, I wasn't going to stress about it. Sure, the money would be amazing, but the risks came with it too.

People who scored deals like that usually got torn apart by their coworkers ‚Äì targeted, excluded, bullied until they quit within a month. And even if you stuck it out, the commission wouldn't hit your account for another three months.

Compared to that mythical $50,000, I'd rather have my steady part-time income each month.

It gave me plenty of free time in the evenings, so I didn't have to spend every waking moment in photography studios or attend networking events I absolutely hated just to land a couple of high-paying modeling gigs.

So I deliberately stayed away from the main entrance, focusing on clients who clearly knew what they were looking for.

All morning, I didn't close a single deal, but I did pick up a few potential leads.

Whether they'd actually become real clients was up to God at this point.

By three or four in the afternoon, I was practically dizzy with hunger. I'd rushed over here at lunch without stopping at the convenience store for even a sandwich, and now my stomach was growling.

I was thinking about hitting up the coffee shop nearby after work to grab something to eat ‚Äì I had to go to the hospital tonight and couldn't afford to be running on empty.

That's when I noticed the lobby had gone completely quiet.

The person everyone had been waiting for all afternoon had finally arrived.

The fact that he was followed by both the president and vice president of the Melville Building made his identity crystal clear to everyone.

Oliver Melville.

The actual owner of this entire building.

# Chapter 4¬†¬†Why is he?

I stood in the corner watching the man surrounded by crowds in the distance. My feelings were all mixed up.

So he's with the Melville Family.

How many years has it been since we saw each other?

I tried to make myself smaller, hoping to disappear into the crowd.

He probably wouldn't recognize me anyway. Our last meeting was seven or eight years ago, and I'm completely different now from who I was then.

Thinking about this, I felt relieved and kind of laughed at myself for freaking out earlier.

I calmed down and decided to just stay in the background. As long as I kept quiet, Oliver wouldn't notice some random employee like me.

But surprises always come when you don't expect them.

I kept thinking: go away, go away, go away.

But Oliver ignored what I wanted and walked straight toward me.

Fuck.

I could feel everyone looking at me now. I knew I was screwed.

""Does this guy still recognize me?""

I kept thinking about what I should say to him first.

But I never expected this.

His first words were:

""Ms. Tina? Sorry to bother you, but can you show my friend around the 7th floor later? If we close the deal, you get the commission.""

I had no idea what to say.

Was he really giving me the big deal everyone wanted today?

I didn't want this. Just those two sentences made me feel like everyone was watching me.

I had to get rid of this deal.

I decided and looked up at Oliver.

""Mr. Melville, I'm honored you picked me, but I don't have much experience. There are definitely people here who could do this better than me. Should I find someone more suitable?""

The whole lobby went quiet.

Nobody thought I'd give up a commission this big.

Oliver didn't think so either.

His throat moved and he let out a low laugh.

I broke out in a cold sweat.

That was his thing - it meant he found something interesting.

Damn, why do I still remember his habits after all these years?

""Whatever, I've decided you're doing this deal. You close it, you get 1.25 times the commission. You don't close it, you write your resignation letter and I'll approve it. I'm the head of Melville Group, and I hate it when people try to back out.""

Oliver wouldn't let me go.

That bastard.

I cursed him in my head.

Since he wanted to mess with me, I might as well go all out.

""Since Mr. Melville thinks so highly of me, I have a small request too. If you agree, I'll take this deal right away.""

""Tell me.""

""If I close this deal, the 125% commission needs to be in my account within a week. And I'll submit my resignation letter at the same time - I hope you'll approve it the day the commission comes through.""

He made a weird laugh, and everyone looked at me like I was crazy.

I was probably the first person brave enough to challenge Mr. Melville like this.

Only I knew my palms were completely wet.

But since I couldn't avoid this, I might as well take the deal, make some good money, and get as far away from this crazy person as possible.

But would he agree?

I wasn't sure, but I had to gamble.

# Best Gainesville Mug 2025: Find Your Perfect Souvenir

In 2025, the market offers a wide array of options, from classic designs to modern interpretations, making the search for the perfect souvenir both exciting and possibly overwhelming. This review aims to guide you through the best choices, highlighting key features, benefits, and ideal user profiles to help you find the Gainesville mug that best suits your needs and preferences.

## Key Features Analysis

The value of a Gainesville mug lies not just in its aesthetic appeal,but also in its functionality,durability,and the story it tells. Here's a look at some of the key features that distinguish the best Gainesville mugs of 2025.

**Material and Construction:** A high-quality Gainesville mug should be crafted from durable materials that can withstand daily use. Most of the top-rated mugs are made from ceramic or stoneware due to their excellent heat retention and resistance to chipping.

The thickness of the material is also vital; thicker mugs tend to be more durable and better at maintaining the temperature of your beverage.**Design and Graphics:** The design is,of course,a primary factor in choosing a Gainesville mug. The graphics should be clear, vibrant, and resistant to fading or peeling over time. Popular designs frequently enough feature iconic Gainesville landmarks, such as the University of Florida's Century tower, Ben Hill Griffin stadium, or depictions of local wildlife like alligators. Sublimation printing is a common method for applying thes graphics, ensuring they are deeply embedded into the mug's surface for longevity. Some mugs also feature hand-painted designs or embossed details for a more artisanal touch.

**Size and Capacity:** Gainesville mugs come in a variety of sizes to accommodate different preferences. Standard sizes range from 11 to 15 ounces, which are ideal for a regular cup of coffee or tea. Larger mugs with capacities of 20 ounces or more are available for those who prefer a larger serving. The ideal size will depend on your personal drinking habits and the type of beverages you typically consume. Consider the mug's height and diameter, as these factors can effect its stability and ease of handling.

**Handle Design:** A comfortable handle is crucial for a pleasant drinking experience. The handle should be ergonomically designed to fit comfortably in your hand, providing a secure grip without feeling too bulky or awkward. Common handle designs include C-shaped handles, D-shaped handles, and full-loop handles. The material and construction of the handle are equally important; it should be securely attached to the mug and made from a material that doesn't get too hot to handle.

**dishwasher and Microwave Safety:** For convenience, the best Gainesville mugs are both dishwasher and microwave safe. This makes them easy to clean and allows you to quickly reheat your beverages without transferring them to another container.

**Can I customize a Gainesville mug with my own design?**
yes, many companies offer customization services for mugs, allowing you to add your own photos, logos, or text. This can be a great way to create a unique and personalized Gainesville mug for yourself or as a gift. Look for companies that offer high-quality printing and durable finishes.

**Where can I purchase a Gainesville mug?**
Gainesville mugs are widely available at local gift shops, bookstores (especially those affiliated with the University of Florida), and online retailers like Etsy and Amazon. You can also find them at university events and alumni gatherings. Consider supporting local businesses and artisans to find unique and high-quality options.

At ABS Boston, we believe that everyone is entitled to feel good about their smile. Whether you are trying to fix minor imperfections, have teeth missing, or want to enhance the beautiful smile you have, cosmetic dentistry provides options for you to do a whole variety of things, depending on your needs. From professional teeth whitening to complex smile makeovers, we are here to assist you in creating the smile you've always dreamed of.

In this guide, we will break down some of the most commonly used cosmetic dentistry treatments provided by ABS Boston so that you have a mental catalogue of options available to you to change your smile.

**Why Choose Cosmetic Dentistry?**¬†

Cosmetic dentistry is more than just the way that your teeth look: they instill a level of confidence that can influence the way you express yourself and can even improve your oral health, as there are many treatments that address visual issues and functionality, such as alignment, bite, and wear.¬†

When you choose ABS Boston, you are choosing a dental office that cares about you as a person, and we will create a level of precision, care, and artistry for your smile. ABS Boston loves to incorporate technology with a patient-first approach to ensure that we can help you get natural-looking results that will last for years.¬†

**Popular Cosmetic Dentistry Options at ABS Boston**

At ABS Boston, we have whitening treatments that give you a lot better result than commercial bleaching kits! We can whiten your teeth several shades in just one appointment, making you look younger and fresher.

**1. Professional Teeth Whitening**

Over time, drinks and certain foods like coffee, tea, wine, and other foods can stain our

¬†teeth causing our bright smiles to look dull. At ABS Boston, we have professional¬†

whitening services that are much more impactful than the ones you can find at a grocery store.¬†

**2. Porcelain Veneers**

They are very versatile and can fix anything from a small chip or gap to an undesirable color or anterior alignment. They are a great long-term solution for a full smile makeover with no need for extensive tooth preparation.

**3. Dental Bonding**

Dental bonding may be an option if you're looking for an inexpensive way to fix smaller defects. Using a tooth-colored composite resin, our dentists do repairs, reshape a tooth, or close small gaps in just one appointment.

**4. Invisalign Clear Aligners**

Invisalign can be the best option for patients who are looking to achieve straighter teeth without the hassle of traditional brackets and wires. You will get fitted for a series of clear, removable aligners that will gradually shift your teeth from misalignment into position while still allowing you to eat, brush, and floss normally.

  
**5. Dental Implants**¬†

Missing teeth can have an effect on how your smile looks and also on your oral health. Dental implants are a great way to provide a permanent, natural-looking replacement that works just like your natural teeth. With our implants at ABS Boston, we personalize our implant treatments to give you the best outcome possible and obtain long-term success.¬†

# Beyond Cosmetic Dentistry - Full Care of the Mouth

https://preview.redd.it/7791d13fjrhf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9bd3cbbfc487ea6f69f3a6ab81e492d700bc144

We want to focus on dental treatments for aesthetics, but the health of your mouth is equally important. For example, you might need procedures like Wisdom Tooth Extraction West Roxbury for overcrowding or discomfort, both of which can affect your health and the look of your smile

At ABS Boston, we blend preventive and restorative dentistry with cosmetic care - meaning before we elevate your smile, we are making sure your mouth is healthy. For one reason, we don't want your amazing new cosmetic dental work to suffer from issues like wisdom tooth removal, cavities, or gum disease. Your cosmetic dental work must be lasting and health-free.



# Wisdom Tooth Removal West Roxbury ‚Äì An Important Aspect of a Healthy Smile

Inability to fit into a mouth can cause issues, including impaction, infection, improper alignment, and/or soreness.

ABS in West Roxbury provides patients with a safe, comfortable environment for wisdom tooth removal. Conducting a removal of wisdom teeth, we can:

* Avoid overcrowding, which may ruin orthodontic treatment in adults who have future dental care (ortho, implant, veneers, etc.) recommended.

* Reduced potential for gum inflammation and infection

* Elimination of discomfort or pain as a result of impacted and/or erupting teeth

Prevent teeth from shifting towards each other, which will cause significant impact for some inconveniences for patients over time.

Many patients are pleasantly surprised to learn that wisdom tooth removal can have an effect on the overall appearance of their smile, making removal a vital part of their overall dental plan.

# The ABS Boston Difference

What makes ABS Boston different is that we will exhibit the utmost attention to detail and sophistication in both artistic and scientific elements.¬†

Each smile we create around a patient is customized and takes into account the whole person, not just the mouth. Our teams are equipped with advanced imaging and technology that will ensure we plan our procedures precisely, leading to predictable, natural outcomes.

Once you enter our practice, you will immediately understand the patient-centered environment we have created. We take the time to speak to our patients and provide options, and take the time to provide answers to any questions.

**Your Smile Makeover Experience ‚Äì Step by Step**

**Consultation** ‚Äì We will begin with an extensive conversation regarding your goals and concerns. Digital scans and photographs will enable us to assess your starting smile.

**Preparation** ‚Äì Most veneers or bonding treatments will require minimum tooth preparation so we can design a solution based upon your existing natural teeth.

**Procedure** ‚Äì Once treatment is determined, we methodically complete your treatment using the latest techniques.

**Follow-Up Care** ‚Äì We will provide guidance on taking care of your new smile, including oral hygiene principles and regular checkups.

**Maintaining Your New Smile**

Once your cosmetic treatments are complete, it‚Äôs essential to protect your investment. Here are a few tips:

* Brush twice daily with a fluoride toothpaste

* Floss regularly to prevent plaque buildup

* Schedule routine cleanings and checkups with ABS Boston

**Thoughts**

Your smile is one of your most powerful features‚Äîit can light up a room, convey confidence, and reflect your personality. With the wide range of cosmetic dentistry options available at ABS Boston, there‚Äôs no reason to settle for a smile you don‚Äôt love.

Whether you‚Äôre considering professional whitening, porcelain veneers, Invisalign, or a more comprehensive makeover, our team is ready to help.

First my mom got incurable leukemia, and then as we're grappling with that, my dad fell. Gravity. Not just a good idea, it's the law. I'm an ER Nurse in my day job, so I've unfortunately seen how many final episodes for people my dad's age start with ""and then they fell and broke their hip"".

My dad was the crew chief for Looking Glass when it was brand new. One of, if not THE first. And I've heard his stories all my life, but I decided to sit down with him and *really* go over what I knew and what I didn't. There are things he still won't tell me- besides being on Looking Glass, I suspect he was doing some RIVET JOINT shenanigans and other stuff, and I know he was on the ground in Vietnam briefly doing things he has never told me about. He's just that way- he wouldn't tell me what the ground stations for Looking Glass were until I showed him they'd been declassified in 1969, for instance. Always took it very seriously.

But I decided to write about what he *did* tell me, in a version of history where the skills he had were needed. I wanted to honor the service of my dad and all the SAC airmen who stood alert during the Cold War, who stood guard against the worst case scenario. I would like to eventually publish this, but before I did that, I wanted to share it here first. It's raw- it didn't even exist 36 hours ago- but I wanted to get it down and out into the ether before I lost my chance to be able to do it for the person who matters the most for it.

It won't all fit in one post, so I'll append the rest as a comment below.

Thanks, y'all. 

# Chapter 1: Alert

The Nebraska wind cut across the flight line at Offutt Air Force Base like a blade, carrying the smell of jet fuel and the promise of winter. Airman Marlin Dwyer pulled his field jacket tighter as he walked the perimeter of his KC-135, clipboard in hand, checking off items that had become as familiar as breathing in the three months since he'd arrived at what the enlisted men called Awful Airplane Patch.

*Left main landing gear, tire pressure good. Hydraulic lines, no leaks. Wing flaps, secure.*

The tanker sat heavy on the tarmac, her silver skin dulled by the overcast morning. She wasn't much to look at‚Äînone of the sleek menace of the B-52s or the graceful lines of the fighters‚Äîbut she was his responsibility. Every rivet, every system, every gallon of fuel that would keep America's nuclear deterrent in the air.

Marlin paused at the nose gear, glancing east toward the horizon where Interstate 80 disappeared into the distance. Sixty miles down that road sat Atlantic, Iowa, population 7,432, where his mother would be getting ready for church and his father would be checking on the cattle. Close enough to drive home for Sunday dinner, if the Air Force would let him. Close enough that this posting felt less like an adventure and more like he'd never really left home at all.

He'd wanted California. Maybe Hawaii. Hell, even Alaska would have been something different. Everyone else in his tech school class got sent to B-52s. Every damn one of them. Instead, the Strategic Air Command had deposited him in Omaha, right back in the cornfields, trading one flat horizon for another. The only difference was the aircraft scattered across the base's vast expanse like sleeping giants, and the knowledge that at any moment, the world might end.

His father hadn't said much when Marlin told him about the assignment. Just nodded that slow nod he'd always had, the one that said he understood things without needing them explained. Lowell Dwyer had driven a bulldozer on Tarawa while Japanese artillery walked fire across the coral. He'd helped carve Iwo Jima into an airstrip while Marines died in the surf. He understood about runways and aircraft and the weight of keeping them operational. He just didn't talk about it.

*Maybe that's what this is,* Marlin thought, finishing his inspection. *Learning to carry weight without talking about it.*

The 34th Air Refueling Squadron was still finding its identity, still figuring out its place in SAC's grand design. They weren't the glamorous fighter jocks or the apocalypse riders in the B-52s. They were the gas station attendants of nuclear war, keeping the bombers fed and in the air. It wasn't glorious work, but it was necessary work, and Marlin was beginning to understand that in the Air Force, necessary mattered more than glorious.

He was walking back toward the crew shack when the klaxon cut through the morning air‚Äîthat rising, falling wail that every man on base knew in his bones. Marlin's clipboard clattered to the tarmac as it echoed across Offutt, bouncing off hangars and dispersal areas, cutting through the morning routine like an ax through kindling.

Suddenly the flight line erupted into controlled chaos. Marlin ran, his boots pounding concrete as he joined the stream of airmen racing toward the alert aircraft. Behind him, he could hear the rumble of pickup trucks starting, the shout of crew chiefs calling to their teams.

His truck was where he'd left it, keys in the ignition‚Äîa pickup truck that would carry his whole crew to their aircraft. The engine turned over on the first try, and as the other airmen piled into the bed and claimed shotgun, he gunned it toward the alert pad where eight aircraft sat in a perfect line, each one fueled and ready for immediate departure. His tanker‚Äîtail number 61-0262‚Äîsat third from the left, as familiar to him now as his own face in the mirror.

Marlin killed the engine and hit the ground running as his crew scattered to their positions‚Äîboom operator, pilot, and co-pilot heading for the ladder by the front landing gear while he moved to his ground duties. The aircraft loomed above him, thirty thousand gallons of jet fuel wrapped in aluminum skin, waiting for him to bring her to life. His hands moved automatically, muscle memory taking over where conscious thought might have slowed him down.

Pitot tube covers first‚Äîthe small fabric sleeves that protected the aircraft's speed sensors. He yanked them free and tossed them aside, not caring where they landed. Engine inlet covers next, the large red streamers that kept debris out of the J57 turbojets. Four covers, four engines, each one pulled free and thrown clear.

The wheel chocks came next‚Äîheavy rubber wedges that kept the aircraft from rolling. He'd leave those until the engines were running; the bird would jump them if someone in the cockpit got heavy on the throttles before he could pull them clear.

His headset cable snaked from the aircraft's belly, and he plugged it in with practiced efficiency. The familiar crackle of intercom filled his ears, followed by Major Dozette's voice from the cockpit.

""Ground, this is Aircraft Commander. Ready for engine start.""

""Roger, AC. Ground crew ready. Starting sequence.""

Marlin positioned himself where he could see all four engines, his eyes scanning for the telltale signs of trouble. ""Starting number one!""

The first J57 began its whining spin-up, compressor blades catching air and building momentum. Marlin watched the exhaust, waiting for the moment when fuel met fire.

""Rotation on one!""

The engine caught with a throaty roar, exhaust gas temperature climbing as the turbine found its rhythm. The smell of burning jet fuel washed over him, a scent that meant power and purpose and barely controlled violence.

""Light off on one! Starting number two!""

The sequence repeated‚Äîspin-up, rotation, ignition. Four times Marlin called the starts, four times he watched tons of metal and machinery come alive under his guidance. When all four engines were idling, their combined roar making conversation impossible without the headset, he pulled the wheel chocks.

""Chocks clear, ready to taxi,"" he called.

""Roger, chocks clear,"" Dozette acknowledged. ""Crew Chief, disconnect and board.""

""Roger, disconnecting."" Marlin unplugged the headset cable, coiled it quickly, and ran to the crew entrance ladder, pulling it up behind him and securing the hatch just as 61-0262 lurched into motion. Through the small porthole, he could see the seven other alert birds beginning to taxi as well. They moved in sequence toward the end of Runway 14R, a procession of barely contained destruction that he was now part of.

Inside the aircraft, the noise was different‚Äîthe deep thrum of engines transmitted through the airframe, the whistle of air conditioning, the electronic hum of radios and navigation equipment. This was what they trained for, what every drill and inspection and endless repetition prepared them for‚Äîthe moment when SAC's sleeping giants woke up and prepared to carry nuclear fire to the ends of the earth.

At the runway threshold, the eight aircraft formed up in a staggered line. From his position inside the aircraft, Marlin could feel the engines spooling up, the vibration building through the floor plates. The tower would give them clearance, and then‚Äî

""Thirty-second intervals,"" he muttered to himself, remembering the briefings. Eight aircraft, each one launching into the wake turbulence of the one before it. The first bird would bank right after takeoff, the second left, the third right again‚Äîanything to avoid flying through the roiling air left behind by three hundred-thousand pounds of aircraft and fuel.

The lead tanker released its brakes and began its roll. Even from inside his own aircraft, Marlin could feel the thunder through the airframe. He felt his own aircraft lurch forward as they began their takeoff roll, thirty seconds behind the bird ahead of them.

Thirty seconds. Barely enough time for the wake to settle before the next aircraft hit it. Marlin had heard the stories from crews who'd flown these mass launches‚Äîthe way the aircraft bucked and fought in the disturbed air, the sickening drops and sudden climbs as invisible turbulence tried to tear the wings off. ""Makes you pucker hard,"" one old-timer had told him. ""Doable because you have to, but it ain't fun.""

And now he was living it. 61-0262 accelerated down the runway, chasing the ghosts of the aircraft ahead of it. They lifted off, and seconds later the landing gear retracted with a solid *thunk*. The tanker climbed into the gray Nebraska sky, banking right to minimize the wake turbulence‚Äîbut not avoid it. The aircraft shuddered and bucked as they still hit the roiling air, and Marlin gripped his seat, understanding exactly what that old-timer had meant.

The other aircraft in the formation climbed ahead of and behind them, each one disappearing into the overcast until only the steady rumble of their own engines remained. Eight tankers, airborne and ready to keep America's nuclear deterrent in the air wherever it needed to go. Marlin settled back in his seat and realized he'd been holding his breath.

The all-clear came fifteen minutes later, crackling over the aircraft radio with anticlimactic simplicity.

""Alert exercise terminated. All aircraft RTB. Repeat, alert exercise terminated.""

Return to base. Just another drill. Another test of SAC's readiness, another reminder that the next time might not be practice. As they turned toward home, Marlin looked out the small porthole at the Nebraska farmland below, thinking about what they'd just practiced.

After landing and post-flight, Marlin climbed back into the pickup truck with his crew and drove slowly back toward the crew shack. The adrenaline was wearing off now, leaving behind the familiar routine of securing the aircraft and preparing for the next alert cycle.

He thought about his father, working the farm with that same quiet competence, carrying the weight of memories he'd never shared. Maybe this was what his dad had learned on those Pacific islands‚Äîthat readiness was its own kind of burden, that the ability to do terrible things when necessary was both a gift and a curse.

The post-flight inspection was routine, methodical. Engine temps normal, no discrepancies to write up. Marlin signed off the forms and headed for the crew truck. The wind picked up, carrying the scent of approaching weather.

Tomorrow there'd be another alert, another scramble, another test of readiness.

Always waiting.

Marlin parked the truck and walked back toward his abandoned clipboard, still lying where he'd dropped it when the klaxon sounded. The routine inspection could wait. Right now, he needed coffee and a few minutes to let his heart rate return to normal.

But first, he looked east again, toward the horizon that led home. Sixty miles didn't seem like much distance anymore. It seemed like exactly the right amount‚Äîclose enough to remember where he came from, far enough to become whoever SAC needed him to be.

The next time the klaxon sounded, it might not be a drill.

# Chapter 2: Desert Anvil

The KC-135 climbed through ten thousand feet, leaving the flat geometry of Nebraska behind for the rumpled brown canvas of the American West. Marlin pressed his face to the small porthole, watching the landscape transform from the orderly squares of corn and wheat to something that looked like God had crumpled up the earth and thrown it down in disgust.

He'd flown plenty of missions before‚Äîup to Maine, across to Canada, even as far as Greenland‚Äîbut he'd always been just cargo, locked inside the aircraft while it sat on foreign tarmac. Seeing glaciers and mountains from 35,000 feet was impressive, sure, but it wasn't the same as actually walking on different ground, breathing different air. This TDY to Nellis was different. Seven days in the Nevada desert, supporting B-52 training missions. Seven days away from the Awful Airplane Patch.

""Check this out,"" called First Lieutenant Morrison from the co-pilot's seat, waving a week-old copy of Stars and Stripes while Dozette handled the controls. ""They're calling that wall in Berlin an 'Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart.' Can you believe that?""

Major Dozette didn't look up from the instruments. ""That's why we're out here practicing, gentlemen.""

Marlin nodded, though nobody was looking at him. The Berlin thing felt far away, like something happening on another planet. But he supposed that was the point of SAC‚Äîmaking sure the Soviets knew that Nebraska farm boys with nuclear weapons were only eight hours away from anywhere on earth.

""You ever think about trying for loadmaster?"" Airman Bobby Kowalski asked from across the cabin. The boom operator was younger than Marlin, maybe nineteen, with the kind of pale skin that was going to suffer in the Nevada sun. ""Get to see Europe for real, not just through a porthole.""

""Sometimes,"" Marlin admitted. The C-141s were new, and the loadmasters got to travel everywhere‚ÄîGermany, France, places that actually had history older than a hundred years. ""Getting kinda tired of corn and soybeans.""

""Hell, I get tired of corn and soybeans, and I'm from Detroit,"" Kowalski grinned. ""At least you got an excuse.""

The aircraft banked slightly, and Marlin felt his ears pop as they began their descent. Through the porthole, he could see the first hints of the desert‚Äîred rock formations jutting up like broken teeth, dry lake beds that looked like scars in the earth. It was beautiful and alien, nothing like the gentle roll of Iowa farmland.

""Nellis approach, Tanker Two-Seven-Three, requesting vector for landing,"" Major Dozette's voice crackled over the intercom.

""Roger, Two-Seven-Three, turn left heading two-seven-zero, descend and maintain eight thousand...""

Marlin felt the familiar flutter in his stomach as they descended, but this time it wasn't nerves‚Äîit was anticipation. For the first time since joining the Air Force, he was going somewhere that wasn't home.

\--------

The heat hit like opening an oven door.

Marlin had thought he knew what hot meant‚ÄîAugust afternoons in the Iowa cornfields, when the humidity made the air thick enough to swim through. But this was different. This was heat with teeth, dry and vicious, that seemed to suck the moisture from his lungs with every breath.

The crew chief from Nellis, a leathery staff sergeant named Rodriguez, grinned at their obvious discomfort. ""Welcome to hell, boys. It's only gonna get worse.""

The flight line at Nellis sprawled under the desert sun like a mirage made real. B-52s sat in neat rows, their white paint gleaming, while sleek fighters‚ÄîF-100s and the needle-sharp F-104s that looked like gleaming daggers‚Äîdotted the tarmac between them. The F-104s' wings were so thin and sharp that crew chiefs handled them like razors, Marlin noticed, keeping their hands well clear of the leading edges.

But it was the sound that got to him. Offutt was loud, sure, but this was different‚Äîthe constant, high-pitched scream of fighters taking off and landing, the deeper rumble of bombers, all of it bouncing off the mountains that ringed the valley like the walls of an amphitheater.

""Your bird's in spot thirty-seven,"" Rodriguez said, pointing across the shimmering tarmac. ""Water truck'll be by every morning at oh-six-hundred. You're gonna need it.""

Marlin spent the next hour performing his post-flight inspection, sweating through his fatigues despite the early hour. The heat radiated up through the soles of his boots, and by the time he checked the demineralized water tank for the engine injection system, his shirt was soaked. In this heat, water injection wasn't optional‚Äîit was survival.

That night, lying in the visiting airmen's quarters with the air conditioning rattling like a dying animal, he thought about the loadmaster idea. Bobby was right‚Äîthere were places in the world that weren't flat and endless, places where the horizon didn't stretch on forever like a promise that was never quite kept.

Six more days in the desert.

\-------

By day four, Marlin had developed a routine. Up at 0500, before the heat became unbearable. Pre-flight in the relative cool of dawn, then into the air-conditioned sanctuary of the aircraft for the mission. They'd been supporting different B-52 training sorties‚Äîlow-level navigation runs, simulated bombing missions over the ranges, high-altitude endurance flights that tested both man and machine.

The work was good. Different. He was learning things about his trade that the familiar routines of Offutt had never taught him. How fuel systems behaved differently in extreme heat. How desert dust got into everything, requiring constant vigilance. How the thin air at altitude made the engines work harder, drink more fuel.

""Supposed to hit one-fifteen today,"" Bobby said on the morning of day six, checking the weather report. The boom operator had acquired a sunburn that made him look like a lobster in a flight suit. ""Radio says it might be a record.""

Major Dozette looked up from his coffee. ""Might want to top off that water tank again, Dwyer. We're heavy today‚Äîlotta thirsty BUFFs out there.""

Marlin nodded, already dreading the walk across the superheated tarmac. The B-52s were doing an extended navigation exercise today, flying all the way to Colorado and back. The tanker would meet them over the mountains, gas them up, and escort them home. A long day in a hot airplane.

But first, they had to get off the ground.

\-------

The official temperature was 110 degrees, but Marlin could feel the heat radiating off the black tarmac like waves. His thermometer read 125 in the shade of the wing, and there wasn't much shade to be found.

The KC-135 sat heavy on the runway, loaded with 30,000 gallons of jet fuel and sweating in the desert sun. Marlin had performed the most thorough pre-flight inspection of his career, checking and double-checking every system. In this heat, there was no margin for error.

""Ground crew ready,"" he reported into his headset, strapping himself into what the crew called the IG seat‚Äîofficially the Inspector General's seat, where visiting brass sat during check rides, but today serving as his perch behind the throttles. Through the windscreen, he could see the heat shimmer rising from the runway like smoke.

""Nellis Tower, Tanker Two-Seven-Three, ready for takeoff,"" Dozette radioed.

""Two-Seven-Three, cleared for takeoff. Wind calm, altimeter two-nine-eight-seven.""

They taxied onto the runway, the aircraft feeling sluggish and heavy. Marlin could see the pilots going through their final checks, both men sweating despite the air conditioning.

""Water injection armed,"" the co-pilot reported.

""Roger. Here we go.""

Dozette pushed the throttles forward, and the four J57s began their climb to takeoff power. The aircraft started rolling, slowly at first, then picking up speed as physics and engineering fought against the desert heat.

""V-one,"" the co-pilot called. Decision speed. Past the point of no return.

""Water injection,"" Dozette ordered.

Lieutenant Morrison flipped the switch.

Marlin watched the Engine Pressure Ratio gauges. They were supposed to jump as the water injection kicked in, adding mass and thrust to the struggling engines. He watched the four needles, waiting for the telltale spike that would mean the system was working.

The needles didn't move.

He saw the pilots exchange a look‚Äîa split second of communication that said everything and nothing. They were already past V-1, already committed to flight. The runway was disappearing beneath them at 120 knots and climbing, and the engines were giving them everything they had.

It just might not be enough.

""V-R,"" Morrison called. Rotation speed.

Dozette pulled back on the yoke, and the nose creeped up, but the aircraft felt wrong‚Äîheavy, reluctant, like it was being dragged through molasses. Marlin felt his stomach drop as he realized they weren't really doing anything so much as falling forward with style.

The runway distance markers flashed by in his peripheral vision. 4,000 feet remaining. 3,000. The aircraft was accelerating, but not fast enough, not nearly fast enough for the weight they were carrying.

""Uhhh, Major?"" Morrison's voice was tight, strained. His eyes were fixed on the diminishing runway ahead.

2,000 feet remaining.

Marlin wanted to say something, anything, but his training held. The crew chief didn't speak unless spoken to, especially not when the pilots were fighting for their lives. He gripped the armrests of his seat and watched the altimeter, willing it to show something other than field elevation.

1,000 feet remaining.

""Come on, *come on*,"" Dozette muttered under his breath, pulling back on the yoke with careful precision, balancing it as if on a knife edge.

500 feet.

The wheels lifted off just as they crossed the runway threshold, but they weren't really *flying*‚Äîthey were making a controlled fall forward, an incalculably close distance from the desert floor. The aircraft wallowed in the superheated air. Through the windscreen, Marlin could see sagebrush and rock rushing by just feet below.

The stall warning horn gave a brief, heart-stopping chirp.

Nobody spoke. Nobody breathed. The only sounds were the laboring engines and the whistle of air over the wings.

They had cleared the overrun by what Marlin could have sworn was inches‚Äîclose enough that he thought he could see individual rocks and the shadow of their aircraft racing across the desert floor. The KC-135 hung in the air like it was suspended by hope and stubbornness, refusing to climb but somehow refusing to fall.

Thirty thousand gallons of jet fuel, Marlin thought with crystalline clarity. If they hit now, there wouldn't be enough left of any of them to identify. Just a smoking crater and maybe some scattered metal.

Then, like a gift from whatever god watched over airmen, they hit a pocket of cooler air. The wings bit into the thinner atmosphere, and the KC-135 finally, blessedly, began to climb.

For a long moment, nobody moved. Then Marlin heard it‚Äîthree long, shaky exhales as the crew released breaths they hadn't realized they'd been holding. Major Dozette's shoulders dropped maybe half an inch, the only sign he'd give that he'd just wrestled death to a draw.

He straightened in his seat, rolled his shoulders once, and then his eyes went wide as he suddenly remembered he had a crew to look after.

""Jesus fucking Christ,"" he said, though his voice was somehow as steady as granite. ""Marlin, go check on Kowalski.""

Marlin unbuckled and made his way aft on unsteady legs. He found Bobby in the boom compartment, sitting very still in his operator's seat, staring down at the desert through the observation window.

""You okay?"" Marlin asked.

Bobby looked up at him with the expression of a man who'd just watched his own death flash before his eyes. ""Marlin,"" he said, very evenly, ""do we have any extra flight suits?""

For a moment, Marlin didn't understand. Then he saw the dark stain on Bobby's seat and realized that the boom operator had just experienced the takeoff from the worst possible position‚Äîlying on his belly, watching the ground rush up at them through the boom sight.

""I'll see what I can find,"" Marlin said, trying not to smile.

As they climbed toward their rendezvous with the B-52s, Marlin looked back at the shrinking speck of Nellis AFB and realized he'd learned something important. The world didn't need to end for a mission to turn deadly. Sometimes, the sky itself was enemy enough.

But they'd made it.

That had to count for something.

# Chapter 3: Front Lines

The briefing room at Offutt smelled of coffee and cigarettes, fluorescent lights humming overhead like angry insects. Newly minted Airman First Class Marlin Dwyer sat in the back row with the other enlisted men, watching Major Dozette point at a map of Europe with a wooden pointer that had seen better days.

""Gentlemen, the 34th has been selected for a ninety-day rotation to Torrej√≥n Air Base, Madrid,"" Dozette announced. ""We'll be providing refueling support for Operation Chrome Dome.""

Chrome Dome. Marlin knew the mission‚ÄîStrategic Air Command's continuous airborne alert. Nuclear-armed B-52s stayed in the air twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, orbiting at the edge of Soviet airspace. Always airborne, always ready. If the Soviets launched a surprise attack and wiped out America's land-based missiles and bombers, the Chrome Dome birds would still be up there, ready to turn the Soviet Union into radioactive glass.

""Each B-52 carries enough firepower to level half of European Russia,"" Dozette continued. ""Our job is to keep them fed and in the air. Questions?""

The room was silent.

""Outstanding. We deploy in three weeks.""

Marlin stared at the map, trying to process what this meant. Spain. Europe. He'd never been farther from home than Nevada, and now they were sending him across an ocean to help keep the world from ending. He thought about his father building runways on Pacific islands while the war raged around him. Maybe this was his generation's version of going ""over there.""

Three weeks later, he climbed down from the KC-135 at Torrej√≥n and discovered that ""over there"" smelled like diesel fuel, dust, and something indefinably ancient‚Äîlike stone that had been baking in the sun for a thousand years.

\------

The bus ride to their quarters took them past the Spanish side of the base, and Marlin pressed his face to the window like a tourist. Even here, the architecture was nothing like Nebraska or Iowa‚Äîlow buildings with tile roofs, different paint colors, signs in a language he couldn't read. It was his first real glimpse that he wasn't in Kansas anymore.

Then he saw the portrait.

It was massive, maybe three stories tall, mounted on the side of a government building. Generalissimo Francisco Franco stared down at the street with the kind of expression that suggested he knew where you lived and what you'd had for breakfast. Below the portrait, gray-uniformed guards with submachine guns lounged in whatever shade they could find.

""Jesus,"" Kowalski muttered. ""My old man fought guys like this in Italy.""

""Different war,"" said Lieutenant Morrison from the front of the bus. ""Right now, he's keeping the Soviets out of the Mediterranean. Politics makes strange bedfellows.""

Marlin nodded, but something about it felt wrong. His father had never talked much about the war, but Marlin had seen enough newsreels to know what fascists looked like. Now here he was, helping to defend one.

But that was above his pay grade. His job was aircraft, not politics.

\-------

Two weeks into the deployment, Marlin's primary knowledge of Spanish culture consisted of a detailed mental map of every latrine within a quarter-mile of his quarters.

He'd had big plans for Spain‚Äîseafood, sangria, and se√±oritas. Instead, the Torrej√≥n Trots had declared war on every American digestive system on the base. Some combination of the local water, the local food, and the local bacteria had turned his romantic notions of European adventure into an intimate familiarity with Spanish plumbing, which he'd discovered was not designed for the kind of punishment a squadron of sick airmen could dish out.

The smell around the barracks reminded him of the pig farms near Jesup, Iowa, where he'd lived during elementary school‚Äîthat same sour, organic stench that seemed to cling to everything. Even the flight crews weren't immune; Major Dozette and Lieutenant Morrison had taken to trading off pilot duties mid-flight just so one of them could race to the KC-135's tiny lavatory. Professional aviators reduced to playing musical chairs with aircraft controls because of Spanish bacteria.

He sat in the day room, listlessly playing cards with three other victims of the Great Intestinal War, when Bobby Kowalski burst out of the latrine like he'd just conquered Rome.

""I JUST TOOK A HARD SHIT!"" Bobby shouted, throwing both fists in the air. ""YEAH!""

The room erupted in genuine, heartfelt cheers. Airmen who hadn't spoken to each other in days suddenly became best friends, slapping Bobby on the back and shaking his hand like he'd just won the Medal of Honor. Someone started a slow clap. Another airman wiped away what might have been a tear.

It was absurd. It was pathetic. It was the most beautiful moment of solidarity Marlin had ever witnessed.

""Ladies and gentlemen,"" announced Staff Sergeant Rodriguez from the corner, raising his coffee cup in salute, ""we have achieved victory.""

Marlin laughed until his stomach hurt, which was a different kind of stomach pain than he'd grown accustomed to, and therefore a welcome change.

\---------

That evening, he stood on the flight line performing his pre-flight inspection as the Spanish sun painted the sky the color of old blood. In the distance, he could see a B-52 lumbering into the air, its eight engines leaving contrails like chalk marks against the dying light.

Somewhere in that aircraft's bomb bay were hydrogen bombs‚Äîweapons that made the ones dropped on Japan look like firecrackers. Each bomber carried enough firepower to level a dozen cities, and his tanker was responsible for keeping them airborne. The weight of that responsibility felt heavier than the Nevada heat, more oppressive than the Nebraska wind.

The near-disaster at Nellis had been about his own mortality. This was about everyone's.

He finished his inspection and walked back toward the crew quarters, passing the Spanish side of the base where F-86 Sabres sat in neat rows. The Spanish pilots had a different attitude than the Americans‚Äîmore swagger, less regulation. He'd watched them perform low-level fly-bys that would have gotten an American pilot court-martialed, their Sabres screaming past the control tower at what couldn't have been more than fifty feet.

Different war, different rules, he supposed.

\---------

The klaxon woke him from a dead sleep at 0347 hours.

Marlin rolled out of his bunk and into his boots, muscle memory taking over before his brain fully engaged. Around him, the barracks exploded into controlled chaos as twenty airmen transformed from sleeping civilians into SAC crew members in under ninety seconds.

He ran across the tarmac toward his KC-135, the Spanish night air cool against his face. Above him, stars wheeled in unfamiliar patterns against a foreign sky, but the sound of aircraft engines spinning up was universal.

""Engine start checklist!"" Major Dozette's voice crackled over the intercom as Marlin plugged in his headset.

""Ground crew ready!"" Marlin called back, positioning himself where he could see all four J57s.

The engines came alive one by one, their familiar roar drowning out the sound of other aircraft starting up around the base. Through the pre-dawn darkness, Marlin could see the navigation lights of B-52s and other tankers beginning to move.

""Torrej√≥n Tower, Tanker Four-Seven-Two, ready to taxi.""

""Roger, Four-Seven-Two, taxi to runway zero-nine, hold short.""

They began rolling toward the runway, part of a procession of American aircraft responding to whatever crisis or drill had triggered the alert. Marlin settled into his jump seat, watching the pilots work through their pre-takeoff checklist with the efficiency of men who'd done this a thousand times.

That's when he heard the first Spanish F-86 light off.

Then another. Then a dozen.

""What the hell?"" Morrison muttered, looking out his side window.

Marlin craned his neck to see what was happening and felt his blood pressure spike. The Spanish Sabres weren't following the orderly taxi procedures that governed American aircraft movement. They were cutting across grass, bouncing over ditches, racing each other to reach the runway first.

""Jesus Christ,"" Dozette said, yanking the yoke hard left as an F-86 screamed past their nose, missing their wingtip by maybe ten feet. ""These crazy bastards are treating it like a goddamn race!""

The radio exploded with American voices:

""Watch it, watch it!""

""Where the hell did he come from?""

""Tower, we've got Sabres cutting in front of‚Äî""

One Spanish fighter actually left the taxiway entirely, bouncing across the grass median between parallel taxiways to cut in front of a B-52. Marlin watched in horror as the Sabre's landing gear compressed and extended with each bump, the pilot apparently unconcerned that his aircraft was designed for concrete, not cross-country racing.

""First come, first served,"" Dozette muttered grimly, fighting to maintain position as another F-86 squeezed between them and the aircraft ahead. ""That's their runway rule. First to the line gets to take off first.""

""Are they insane?"" Morrison asked.

Before Dozette could answer, the radio crackled with the magic words: ""Exercise, exercise, exercise. All aircraft return to parking. Repeat, exercise terminated.""

The relief in Marlin's chest was so profound he actually felt lightheaded. Around them, the Spanish pilots were already climbing out of their cockpits, laughing and gesturing at each other like they'd just finished a particularly enjoyable soccer match.

""Well,"" Dozette said, shutting down the engines, ""I guess that's one way to keep your pilots sharp.""

Marlin unplugged his headset and walked back toward the crew quarters, his hands still shaking slightly from the adrenaline. He'd learned something important tonight: sometimes the greatest threat wasn't the enemy you were preparing for, but the chaos you couldn't control right next to you.

He looked back at the Spanish pilots, still celebrating their impromptu race, and realized he wasn't the same airman who'd left Nebraska three months ago. He'd become something harder, more experienced.¬†

I plan to get a Philips Baristina espresso machine, mostly for its small size and price.  
I'm planning to use it near my desk, hence in a location far from a sink.

I'm wondering if it's okay not to clean the parts where the grounded coffee goes with a sink every time, or if that would cause issues with the machine / coffee quality.

Does anyone have experience with this or any tips on how to maintain the machine properly without easy access to a sink? Is only pushing the grounded coffee in a bin enough ?

The Detroit Tigers (66-50) and Los Angeles Angels (55-60) collide at Comerica Park on Friday, August 8, 2025, in a matchup that‚Äôs as lopsided on paper as a crumpled $20 bill in a poker game. Let‚Äôs break this down with the statistical rigor of a spreadsheet and the humor of a ballpark hotdog vendor who‚Äôs seen it all.

---

### Odds & Implied Probabilities: Tigers Bet on Brute Force

The Tigers are the prohibitive favorites here, with moneyline odds hovering around **-400** (decimal: 1.29). Using our trusty formula, this implies a **77% chance of victory**‚Äîabout the same odds of a fire alarm going off during a game of Jenga. Conversely, the Angels (+380) have a **26% implied probability**, which is roughly the chance of me correctly spelling ‚Äúspaghetti‚Äù after three cups of coffee.

The spread reflects this disparity: Detroit is favored by **1.5 runs**, a line so small it‚Äôs almost an insult to the Tigers‚Äô offensive firepower. Take the Tigers here, or invest in a lifetime supply of celebratory beer.

---

### Statistical Dominance: Tigers Swing for the Fences

Detroit‚Äôs offense is a demolition crew in cleats. They lead the majors in **home runs (218)** and **slugging percentage (.442)**, which is like a wrecking ball dressed as a baseball player. Riley Greene (26 HRs) and Gleyber Torres (team-leading .302 BA) are the wrecking crew‚Äôs foremen, while Spencer Torkelson waits in the wings like a backup excavator.

The Angels, meanwhile, are hosting a pitching crisis. Their staff sports a **5.72 ERA (26th in MLB)** and a **1.45 WHIP (3rd worst)**, which is statistically equivalent to a sieve trying to hold water at the bottom of a lake. Starter Kyle Hendricks, a usually reliable arm, will face a Tigers lineup that‚Äôs hit **59 over/under totals at home this season**‚Äîso bring an umbrella, or better yet, a ticket for the Tigers.

I wanted to share something that‚Äôs been happening to me and I really hope no one judges. I just want to understand if this is normal and what I should do.

I recently started taking 20/40mg bisglycinate iron at night, around 3-4 AM, because it‚Äôs the only time that doesn‚Äôt interfere with my coffee, dairy, or daily running routine (I run 4x week at 8 AM after coffee). I‚Äôve taken this supplement many times before at other times of day, but it always gave me awful, smelly gas that made me think I wasn‚Äôt digesting it properly. Now that I take it at night in the early morning hours, I don‚Äôt get those side effects.

However, shortly after introducing the iron at this time, my weight suddenly spiked in just a few days. I haven‚Äôt made any changes to my diet or lifestyle at all. When I saw the initial increase, I got scared and restricted my food a bit, but the weight kept going up, and the bloated feeling is ruining my life.

My ferritin is 19 (my highest ever), but I‚Äôve always struggled with extreme fatigue, lack of concentration, and depression. Reading through your threads, I‚Äôve started to realize that maybe many of these issues I‚Äôve had all my life could be related to iron deficiency.

I‚Äôm wondering if taking the iron at this unusual time is somehow affecting my metabolism or causing me to retain more water by morning, which might explain the weight spike.

I haven‚Äôt increased my food intake (in fact, I‚Äôve slightly reduced it) but my eating disorder and body dysmorphia are starting to creep back in because of this :(

Please, no judgment. I just need to know if this is normal, if it will last, or if there‚Äôs anything I can do. I feel so powerless and anxious.

Thanks so much for reading.",2,1754643742.0,Anemic,2,1.0,False

1mkq6pc,https://i.redd.it/w1dtkv8yfrhf1.jpeg,This InDesign Book Template Can Redefine Your Next Project,"A reader‚Äôs first impression is visual. Long before they read a single word, the layout of your book communicates a level of quality and professionalism. This is why selecting the right [Adobe InDesign book template](https://weandthecolor.com/download-professional-adobe-indesign-book-template-modern-authors-creators/205076) is a critical decision for any author, photographer, or brand. It is the vessel that carries your story. A truly exceptional template provides more than a layout; it offers a seamless and powerful visual experience. This specific design, created by an industry professional, sets a new benchmark for accessible, high-end book production.

# Anatomy of a Flawless Design

This is not just another template. It is a complete, 52-page design system. Graphic designer and Adobe Stock contributor Tom Sarraipo developed this resource with meticulous care. It is available in both A4 and US Letter formats, making it globally applicable. The design itself is a study in modern minimalism. It feels clean, organized, and intentional. This ensures that your text and images are presented with clarity and impact.

# The Grid as a Foundation

The template is built on a strong, invisible grid. This structure brings a sense of order to every page. Consequently, text blocks align perfectly. Images sit in balanced compositions. The grid guides the reader's eye effortlessly through the content. It is the secret to a professional and cohesive look.

# Typography that Breathes

Font selection is paramount for readability. This layout uses a modern, sans-serif typeface that is crisp and elegant. Furthermore, the template makes excellent use of white space. This negative space is not empty; it is an active design element. It prevents pages from feeling cluttered. It gives your words room to be absorbed and appreciated.

# InDesign: The Professional's Choice for Book Layout

Why is Adobe InDesign the essential tool for this kind of work? Simple word processors cannot handle the complexities of professional book layout. InDesign is purpose-built for publication design. It offers unparalleled control over every single element on the page.

Master Pages, for example, allow you to apply consistent elements like headers or page numbers across dozens of pages instantly. Character and Paragraph Styles let you define the look of your text once. You can then apply it consistently throughout your document with a single click. This functionality is crucial for efficiency and maintaining a polished, uniform aesthetic. Using a premium **Adobe InDesign book template** leverages these powerful features from the very start.

# Making the Template Your Own

This template is designed for deep customization. Every element is a placeholder, waiting for your unique vision. The process is intuitive. You can drag and drop your own photography into the designated frames. You can paste your manuscript text, and it will adopt the template's professional formatting.

Think beyond a simple replacement. How can this structure serve your specific project? For a novel, the clean text columns provide a classic reading experience. For a photography portfolio, the full-bleed image spreads offer maximum impact. For a corporate brand book, the organized layout communicates clarity and authority. This adaptability is the hallmark of a superior design tool.

# From Digital File to Physical Masterpiece

Ultimately, this template closes the gap between your creative idea and a tangible, beautiful object. It empowers creators who may not be professional designers to produce work that meets industry standards. The clean, sophisticated aesthetic ensures your book will look credible and compelling on any shelf or coffee table. It provides the structural integrity your content needs, allowing your story and your images to capture the reader's full attention. This is how you present your work with the confidence it deserves.

I am studying for a paper and was hoping I could get a place to sit and revise comfortably while I wait for the train. What are my options?

1. Stay around the airport. Leave by 1330 for the railway stn via the airport express line. If around the airport, choose one option below. 

A. The lounge at Arrivals. Doable, but worried about where to keep my 2x large suitcases. Never used a lounge at an arrivals terminal with luggage in tow. 

B. I know there are options outside, but are they all tiny places to grab a quick meal / coffee or would I get a decent place to sit down like a regular cafe? 

C. Deposit luggage at the left luggage counter in metro station. Then head to options at ser 1B? Won't be allowed back in, so lounge is out. 

OR 

2. Head to railway station after collecting luggage and sit at the new premium lounge till the train departure time? My cards don't allow me a free entry. Is it worth paying for approx 6-7 hrs.

Currently I have just under 4000 subscribers. At the start in 2021, I used a website to boost subscribers so it hasn't been 100% ""organic"" and some of the views were out of my own pocket.

I've recently been seriously thinking about closing up my channel / taking a break (undecided but more likely to take a break). If I'm being transparent, I used to say it's not about the money but does definitely come down to it. I earn enough in a month to probably get me a coffee from the local cafe but youtube has a minimum payout threshold you have to wait to hit (which for me takes months). For the amount of effort I put in (two videos a week 10 mins + and daily shorts) I don't think I'm seeing a return. 

One thing that I don't understand is that I personally feel I'm creating content which is very similar to many others and these others are getting 100k views in 1 week. Not to be sexist but it seems if you're a pretty female, you are destined to be successful in asmr land. 

Do you guys have a strategy that works for you that boosts CTR and attracts viewers? I've recently messed around with thumbnails (too much!) and got to a place I feel confident it will boost clicks but I'm still getting the same results.

- Do you need text in thumbnails? 
- Are titles/descriptions/tags important? 
- Is there anything else that helps you drive views? ",3,1754643489.0,asmr,8,1.0,False

Let‚Äôs be real for a sec.

This might run long. It might wander a bit. That is okay. If you‚Äôre the kind of person who feels too much, who thinks too hard at 2:27 a.m., who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly wants something raw and unfiltered maybe this isn‚Äôt just a post. Maybe it is a tiny nudge from the universe. A crack in the chaos. A weird little sign you needed and did not know you needed.

I do not think people stumble into our lives by accident. Some test our patience. Some derail us. Some feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways. They arrive and your soul exhales like it has been holding its breath for years. Quietly, something inside whispers, this is what I have been missing.

A bit about me. I am 26. I am a doctor. I am from India. I will not diagnose you unless you sneeze like it is a suspicious side quest and my reflex kicks in.

But I am more than a white coat. I am a loud, proud nerd. Not the Pinterest kind. The type who quotes Marvel lines in conversation. The type still mad about how Interstellar messed with time. The type who loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird sci-fi plot holes.

I fall hard for characters who do not exist. I spiral into thoughts about time, memory, consciousness the casual stuff. Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I am the main character in a noir, solving a case equal parts medicine and existential meltdown. Other times I vanish down rabbit holes about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper, bro ‚Äî we are not done yet.

Languages: English, Hindi, Urdu, a bit of Arabic, and I am learning Klingon. Curiosity and chaos run the show up here.

There is a voice in my head. It is not always kind. It is not gentle. But it keeps me going. It says: think harder. Do not settle. Fix what is broken. Show up even when everyone else bails.

It does not care about grades or gold medals. It cares about truth, about purpose. About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world. Why grief hijacks the brain. How trauma gets buried in bones. What we are really chasing under all the noise.

I am not wired for surface-level anything. I need depth. I need meaning. I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.

Right now, what I want is messy and honest.

I want someone real. Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual, hey, like they did not just leave your head spinning. Not someone who opens with, wyd, and ends it with lol. Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations. The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

I want someone who can say, I am not okay today, can we just exist side by side, without feeling like a burden. Someone who hears a lyric and feels it in their ribs. Someone who smells something random and time-travels to a memory they cannot explain. Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes and then goes quiet thinking about stars and why love feels like both a war and a poem.

You do not have to be perfect. Just be human. Just be honest. Just be there.

And right now, I am also asking for a study buddy.

Not one pomodoro and ghost. Not the flakey, let us meet once and vanish kind. I mean consistent. Actually showing up, even virtually.

You do not have to be in medicine. Law, architecture, psychology, astrophysics, studying life any of it counts. Healing counts too.

Imagine this: Midnight hustle. Lo-fi beats or soft rain in the background. Steaming mugs of chai or coffee. Occasional breaks where we drop the dumbest meme or the deepest truth. We keep each other on track. We say, You got this. I am here. We share the random quote that hits too hard. We end the night with a trivia question or a challenge that makes us laugh until our faces hurt.

We show up. We hold space. We get stronger. Together.

Outside study time, let us build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and psychoanalyze characters like we are their therapists. Swap playlists like we are trading pieces of our souls. Talk about mythologies, multiverses, dreams. Argue whether a villain had a point. Speak in bad accents because life is short. Send voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels too much. Make inside jokes nobody else would get. Make a chaotic, cozy digital home of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos.

Confessions, quick and honest: I have imagined being an X-Men way more than I should. Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting. I have been broken, really broken. But I never stopped showing up. I have walked alone more times than I like. I still hope. I do not want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.

If you are:

A little cracked but still trying

Empathetic but forged by experience

Smart but soft in the ways that matter

Funny but carrying quiet storms

Brilliant in your messy, imperfect chaos


Then maybe this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

If any part of this warmed your chest or made you think, same, send a meme, a lyric, a quote, or a thought. If you want to start practical, let us begin with a study session. I prefer late nights IST, but I am flexible. Tell me your timezone and what helps you study pomodoro, 50/10 focus, or a soft ambient timer.

If you want to slide into DMs first, say hi and tell me one unexpected thing about yourself. I will match honesty for honesty.

Still trying. Still here.

Let‚Äôs be real for a sec.

This might run long. It might wander a bit. That is okay. If you‚Äôre the kind of person who feels too much, who thinks too hard at 2:27 a.m., who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly wants something raw and unfiltered maybe this isn‚Äôt just a post. Maybe it is a tiny nudge from the universe. A crack in the chaos. A weird little sign you needed and did not know you needed.

I do not think people stumble into our lives by accident. Some test our patience. Some derail us. Some feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways. They arrive and your soul exhales like it has been holding its breath for years. Quietly, something inside whispers, this is what I have been missing.

A bit about me. I am 26. I am a doctor. I am from India. I will not diagnose you unless you sneeze like it is a suspicious side quest and my reflex kicks in.

But I am more than a white coat. I am a loud, proud nerd. Not the Pinterest kind. The type who quotes Marvel lines in conversation. The type still mad about how Interstellar messed with time. The type who loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird sci-fi plot holes.

I fall hard for characters who do not exist. I spiral into thoughts about time, memory, consciousness the casual stuff. Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I am the main character in a noir, solving a case equal parts medicine and existential meltdown. Other times I vanish down rabbit holes about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper, bro ‚Äî we are not done yet.

Languages: English, Hindi, Urdu, a bit of Arabic, and I am learning Klingon. Curiosity and chaos run the show up here.

There is a voice in my head. It is not always kind. It is not gentle. But it keeps me going. It says: think harder. Do not settle. Fix what is broken. Show up even when everyone else bails.

It does not care about grades or gold medals. It cares about truth, about purpose. About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world. Why grief hijacks the brain. How trauma gets buried in bones. What we are really chasing under all the noise.

I am not wired for surface-level anything. I need depth. I need meaning. I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.

Right now, what I want is messy and honest.

I want someone real. Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual, hey, like they did not just leave your head spinning. Not someone who opens with, wyd, and ends it with lol. Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations. The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

I want someone who can say, I am not okay today, can we just exist side by side, without feeling like a burden. Someone who hears a lyric and feels it in their ribs. Someone who smells something random and time-travels to a memory they cannot explain. Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes and then goes quiet thinking about stars and why love feels like both a war and a poem.

You do not have to be perfect. Just be human. Just be honest. Just be there.

And right now, I am also asking for a study buddy.

The product provides a bulk source of this natural sweetener, offering both convenience and potential cost savings.

In 2025, with increasing consumer awareness of lasting and ethical sourcing, selecting a quality 5-gallon bucket of honey requires careful evaluation. This review examines the best options available, helping you make an informed decision for your sweet needs.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of honey is persistent by various factors, from its floral source to its processing methods. A quality 5-gallon bucket delivers consistent performance across these key aspects.

**floral Source and Origin:** The floral source substantially impacts the honey's flavor, color, and aroma. Single-varietal honeys, such as clover, wildflower, or orange blossom, offer distinct characteristics.Understanding the specific floral source helps consumers choose a honey that aligns with their taste preferences. A reputable supplier will clearly state the honey's origin and floral source, ensuring openness and traceability.

**Purity and Composition:** High-quality honey should be free from additives, such as corn syrup or artificial sweeteners. Look for honey that is certified by reputable organizations, guaranteeing its purity and compliance with quality standards. The honey's composition, including its moisture content, sugar profile, and enzyme activity, also serves as an indicator of its overall quality. Lower moisture content generally results in a thicker consistency and longer shelf life.

**Processing Methods:** The method used to extract and process the honey greatly influences its final quality. Raw honey, which is minimally processed and unheated, retains its natural enzymes, pollen, and antioxidants. honey that has been excessively heated or filtered may lose some of its beneficial properties. Look for honey that has been lightly filtered to remove impurities while preserving its natural goodness.

**Packaging and Storage:** The packaging of a 5-gallon bucket of honey should be food-grade and airtight to prevent contamination and maintain freshness. The bucket should be easy to handle and pour from, minimizing spills and waste. Proper storage of the honey, away from direct sunlight and heat, is essential to preserve its flavor and quality over time.

**Consistency and Texture:** A good quality honey should have a smooth, consistent texture, free from excessive crystallization or granulation.While crystallization is a natural process, it can be minimized by choosing honey with a lower glucose content or by gently warming the honey to dissolve the crystals. The honey's viscosity should also be appropriate for its intended use,whether for pouring,spreading,or mixing into beverages.

## Core Benefits

A 5-gallon bucket of honey offers various benefits beyond just a sweet taste. Bulk purchasing provides convenience and economic advantages.**Cost Savings:** Purchasing honey in bulk offers significant cost savings compared to buying smaller jars.The price per pound is generally much lower when buying in larger quantities, making it a more economical option for frequent honey users, such as bakeries, restaurants, or large families. The upfront investment is higher, but the long-term savings can be substantial.

**Convenience and Availability:** having a 5-gallon bucket of honey on hand ensures that you always have a readily available supply of this natural sweetener and health food. This is particularly beneficial for businesses that rely on honey as a key ingredient in their products. It eliminates the need for frequent trips to the store to replenish smaller jars, saving time and effort.**Versatility and Usage:** Honey is an incredibly versatile ingredient that can be used in a wide variety of culinary applications. it can be used as a natural sweetener in beverages, baked goods, and sauces. It can also be used as a topping for pancakes, waffles, and yogurt. Beyond culinary uses, honey has various health benefits and can be used as a natural remedy for coughs, sore throats, and minor wounds.

**Reduced Packaging Waste:** Buying honey in bulk reduces the amount of packaging waste generated compared to buying multiple smaller jars. This makes it a more environmentally amiable option for consumers who are concerned about sustainability. A single 5-gallon bucket replaces numerous smaller containers, minimizing the environmental impact of packaging disposal.

## FAQs Section

Purchasing such a large quantity of honey naturally brings up questions. Knowing the answers upfront ensures a smooth transaction.

**What is the shelf life of a 5-gallon bucket of honey?**
Honey has an incredibly long shelf life due to its low moisture content and natural antibacterial properties. When stored properly, in a cool, dark place, a 5-gallon bucket of honey can last for several years without spoiling. Crystallization may occur over time,but this does not affect the honey's safety or edibility. Simply warm the honey gently to dissolve the crystals and restore its original consistency.

**How should I store a 5-gallon bucket of honey?**
The best way to store a 5-gallon bucket of honey is in a cool, dark, and dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat. Avoid storing the honey near strong-smelling substances, as it can absorb odors. Ensure that the lid is tightly sealed to prevent moisture absorption and contamination. A pantry or basement is an ideal storage location.

**What if the honey crystallizes?**
Crystallization is a natural process that occurs in honey over time, especially at lower temperatures. It does not indicate that the honey has gone bad. To dissolve the crystals, gently warm the bucket of honey in a warm water bath. Avoid overheating the honey, as this can damage its enzymes and beneficial properties. Stir the honey occasionally while it is warming to ensure even distribution of heat.

**Is all honey in 5-gallon buckets raw?**
No, not all honey sold in 5-gallon buckets is raw. Processing methods vary. Check product descriptions carefully to understand how it was handled.

I F(32) have been with my boyfriend M(35) for nearly 6 years and we have 2 kids ages 1 and 3. The relationship has changed in the wake of having the kids, I have been the stay at home parent as we don‚Äôt have any child care options and he has been the working parent. Today, I asked if he had got his coffee from our coffee machine but he was in the next room and said he couldn‚Äôt hear me. I then asked again in a playful, funny accent. He repeated all I can hear is ‚Äòblah blah blah‚Äô while mocking the accent I had done. I said to him that was a bit mean of him, which then escalated things to him accusing me of ‚Äòkicking off at him‚Äô and at this point the communication broke down to him being angry and telling me I was ruining his day, jumping down his throat for no reason, that I was over reacting and changing the way he said it to sound disrespectful when in fact he was in a good mood. Maybe he‚Äôs right. Maybe I have made an argument out of thin air. I don‚Äôt know anymore as this is not an isolated incident more of a highlight on a problem. I don‚Äôt know who to speak to and feel on edge for our next conversation. He will swear and shout at me  in front of the kids which I have told him is non-negotiable in terms of what I will accept. He has always apologised for it but I am reaching the end of my rope.

Since being the stay at home parent I have no financial independence and can‚Äôt afford to pay to speak to a therapist or anything.

I recently had this kinda spontaneous chat with a ranom guy while waiting for coffee, and it really made me thhink. It's strange how a small interaction can stick with you, ya know? We were both just standing there, awkwardly tryng not to stare at the bafista's vibrant green hair (which, tbh, I thought looked pretty cool but definitely not something I cpuld pull off). Anyway, he just casually mentioned how he finds tese everyday moments beautiful in their simplicity.

Honestly, I've never thought about it like that before. It was refreshing hearing someone appreciate mundane details like the way light fillters through a window or the sound of coffee beans grrinding. I guess I always thought life was kinda made up of big, significant events, but maybe there's magic in the tiny, overlooked moments too.

As I walked away with my latte, I couuldn't help but feel a little more connected to the world around me. So, I just wanted to share this little epiphany to remind you‚Äîor wohever you are‚Äîto pause and appreciate the small things.

I work part time to be at home with my dc3.

I have 1 lady help me do the admin.

i suppose what I mean, is using half of what I earn from the company on holidays, the other half saving towards being mortgage free.

reflecting, the most wise decision would be to put the majority on paying of the mortgage fast.

I live down south, on the outskirts of NW London/Hertfordshire. So it isn‚Äôt cheap.

It all depends on what your want for your life really, and also if that money is just short term or more stable thing.

How old is the child? You might be spending ¬£2-4k a month on childcare.

Where do you like? You might be spending ¬£4-5k on a mortgage for a nice flat.

etc etc.

I think it would probably be a mix of putting ¬£20k a year into your ISA for the future, a big mortgage, school fees / nursery and then some nice holidays on top. That would consume most of it - and create a nice standard of living and longer term security for you both.

Child is 3.  
Dad helps a lot, on weekends. Pays 1100 monthly. In nursery 4 half days.

I would probably stay in the same area so dc can be close to their dad.

having a mortgage as a single person scares me. As I‚Äôm not employed and have a company. Anything can change. So I am trying to make the best financial decision at this stage in life whilst I can.

I'm not sure about any of it. If she's earning in excess of ¬£250k a year, why is she still paying off a mortgage? Unless the property is over ¬£1m

I don‚Äôt have a mortgage currently.

i bought a flat at a percentage on shared ownership. So there is no mortgage  
I pay a small rental amount monthly.

I am looking to save the income in the LTD company and buy a house outright.

Max out your pension contributions, set up a SIPP for your child, stocks and shares ISAs, invest in a good financial advisor and get a long term plan. If you run your own company look at maximising income through dividends etc just to say just because a business is doing well now and you‚Äôre earning that now - look at the single points of failure within your business, make sure you‚Äôre backed up.

I wouldn't fall into the trap of 'spending half of the money on holidays and experiences' as you're currently vulnerable if you can't continue to work as you are - if you become ill, or your DC does, your income could reduce significantly.

Also, could anything happen to your company? Change of market circumstances etc threatening it's stability? Or it might go the other way and if you could sell it for several million, you could invest the money so you're set for life and never¬†*have*¬†to work again - of course you could do bits and pieces that interest you, but be financially independent.

Your housing is stable and easily affordable so if it was me, I would stay in the flat for a few years, run my company, spend some of the money (10-20%?) on a nice lifestyle but also save so I can buy my forever home in a few years when I know what I want. Either sell the flat or rent it out. Also make sure pension is sorted, savings for DC and make sure you're making good decisions re income, tax, savings/investments etc.

Keep the financial flow chart in mind as a 'to do list' of what to consider.

So on that salary you'd take home ¬£144,000 (¬£12k a month) but likely you'd be putting a fair percentage in your pension so you'd probably be on about 10k or 11k a month.

If you're a single parent with no family support you'd need a full time nanny to facilitate those hours, because 250k a year jobs don't typically allow you to leave early for school or nursery pickup.

Where I am full time nannies are 5k a month üò≥ so you'd be left with 5-6k a month, or around ¬£60-70k to spend a year.

Hardly enough to become mortgage free or blow on experiences - also how would you do that working long hours?

Sorry, just thought I'd inject some misery/realism into this thread üòÇ

üòÇ I have a team that do the work for me. So I just do 2-3 hours in the evening and a few in the morning , to just watch over it like a hawk

i would never get a nanny as I‚Äôll never get this time back. My dc goes to nursery 3-4 hours 4 days a week.

1mkpqvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingthruit/comments/1mkpqvd/figures_of_speech_ai_response/,Figures of Speech AI Response,"For the sheer fun of it, I went to Chat GPT with a creative writing assignment. For Figures of Speech prompts, I gave a free parameters, including the word length of 500-1000 words and the prompts for a few of the Fifty mentioned in the series.

I gave the AI creative license and let's just say, they're a long way off from replacing the better writers and I think it just makes it easier to do those lower level tasks and let's leave the creators a slightly higher level of skill to create actual tangible and engaging writing.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response‚Äîor lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly‚Äîthe Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

**Response to Prompt 31: Epanalepsis**

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded exploration. As I embarked on this freewriting journey, the repetition of the existential inquiry became the rhythm of my introspection.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

As the story unfolded, I traced the journey of the dove's symbolism, following its subtle influence on characters and events. The once quaint town underwent a transformative metamorphosis, and the symbolism of the dove became a thread that wove through the narrative, connecting disparate lives in unexpected ways.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me‚Äîan eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The words echoed in my mind, a relentless epizeuxis that fueled the protagonist's journey against insurmountable odds. In the dystopian world I crafted, where hope was a rare commodity, the power of repetition became a beacon of resilience.

For a thousand words, I immersed myself in the protagonist's struggle, exploring the emotional depth of the epizeuxis as a mantra against despair. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry, a whispered promise that carried the weight of a shattered world on its shoulders.

As the narrative unfolded, the epizeuxis became a driving force, propelling the protagonist through a landscape of desolation and uncertainty. The repetition served as a reminder that, in the face of adversity, the strength to persist often lies in the relentless echo of one's own determination.

**Response to Prompt 50: Acrostic**

As the final rays of the setting sun painted the sky in hues of orange and pink, I found myself at the edge of the cliff overlooking the vast expanse of the ocean. The salty breeze carried whispers of a story, and with every breath, I embraced the challenge of crafting an acrostic that encapsulated the essence of my journey.

For a thousand words, I embarked on a reflective exploration, utilizing the initial letters of key words to weave a tapestry of emotions, experiences, and revelations. Each line unfolded with intention, revealing a hidden

**Response to Prompt 3: Hyperbole**

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers. ""This is it, the end of our mundane lives!"" proclaimed Mrs. Thompson, the town's eternal pessimist, as she clutched her cat, Captain Whiskers, with an air of impending catastrophe.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

**Response to Prompt 6: Assonance**

Amidst the rolling hills of Harmony Valley, where the soft hum of nature's symphony echoed through the meadows, a mysterious traveler arrived, bringing with them a melody that resonated with the delicate assonance of a forgotten tune. The townsfolk, captivated by the harmonious vibrations, felt an inexplicable connection to the stranger.

As I explored the narrative, the assonance became a musical thread weaving through the story, emphasizing the emotional cadence of the characters' experiences. The traveler's words, laced with vowel-rich verses, carried the echoes of a distant melody, leaving an indelible impression on the hearts of those who listened.

Through the lens of assonance, I delved into the subtle interplay of sounds that defined the atmosphere of Harmony Valley. The lyrical quality of the narrative mirrored the town's collective journey, where the resonance of shared moments and emotions harmonized with the traveler's enigmatic presence.

**Response to Prompt 7: Onomatopoeia**

In the bustling city of Metropolis, where the rhythm of urban life played out in a cacophony of sounds, a peculiar street performer emerged. Armed with an array of unconventional instruments, he orchestrated a symphony of onomatopoeic brilliance that echoed through the crowded streets.

The narrative unfolded with the vibrant expressions of onomatopoeia, capturing the essence of the city's sonic landscape. The performer's drumming evoked the rhythmic tap-tap of raindrops, while his wind instruments mimicked the whoosh of passing cars. The city, typically drowned in noise, became a canvas for this auditory artist.

As I delved into the story, the onomatopoeic symphony became a language of its own. The characters communicated through the vibrant echoes of everyday sounds, fostering a unique connection between the performer and the people of Metropolis. The narrative danced to the beat of onomatopoeic creativity, transforming the mundane into a dynamic celebration of city life.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed‚Äîa pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden. The juxtaposition of these contrasting elements created a visual paradox that fascinated both residents and visitors alike.

As the narrative unfolded, the stark contrast between the city's cutting-edge architecture and the serene beauty of the Zen Garden became a metaphor for the characters' internal conflicts. The bustling metropolis symbolized progress and innovation, while the tranquil garden embodied the need for balance and introspection.

Through the lens of juxtaposition, I explored the dichotomy within the characters as they navigated the relentless pace of Silicon Haven. The Zen Garden became a refuge, a place where the cacophony of technology met the soothing whispers of nature. The juxtaposition served as a visual metaphor for the characters' quest to find equilibrium in a world defined by extremes.

**Response to Prompt 22: Metonymy**

In the political arena of Capital City, where decisions echoed through the corridors of power, a single phrase dominated conversations‚Äîthe ""Iron Throne Statement."" This metonymic expression encapsulated not just a policy decision but the entire narrative of political maneuvering that unfolded within the city's hallowed halls.

The story unfolded with the metonymy acting as a symbolic gateway into the complexities of governance. The Iron Throne Statement, while seemingly straightforward, carried the weight of a thousand debates, negotiations, and betrayals. Its impact rippled through the lives of citizens, shaping their destinies in ways they could scarcely fathom.

Through the lens of metonymy, I delved into the layers of meaning hidden within this political shorthand. The characters grappled not only with the literal implications of the Iron Throne Statement but also with the overarching themes of power, ambition, and the sacrifices demanded by political gamesmanship.

**Response to Prompt 24: Understatement**

In the picturesque town of Serenity Springs, where the days flowed like a lazy river and the nights were adorned with a blanket of stars, an unexpected event transpired‚Äîa subtle disruption that the locals described as ""just a minor hiccup."" Little did they know that this understatement concealed the unraveling of a cosmic anomaly.

The narrative unfolded with the charm of understatement, as the townsfolk continued their routines, blissfully unaware of the cosmic storm brewing beneath the surface. The serene descriptions of everyday life served as a stark contrast to the impending upheaval that threatened to reshape the very fabric of Serenity Springs.

Through the lens of understatement, I explored the characters' nonchalant reactions to the unfolding events. The once quiet river became a conduit for interdimensional travel, and the night sky, adorned with stars, transformed into a celestial canvas of possibilities. The charm of Serenity Springs became a poignant backdrop to the understated drama that unfolded, emphasizing the profound impact hidden within the simplicity of daily life.

**Response to Prompt 25: Clich√©**

In the small town of Nostalgia Haven, where memories lingered like whispers in the wind, a peculiar phenomenon occurred‚Äîthe resurgence of clich√©s. As the narrative unfolded, the once-endearing phrases like ""time heals all wounds"" and ""love conquers all"" took on a literal dimension, shaping the lives of the townsfolk in unexpected ways.

The story immersed itself in the world of clich√©s, where the seemingly predictable phrases became living entities with the power to alter reality. As characters grappled with the clich√©s that defined their lives, they discovered that beneath the familiarity lay profound truths and unexpected consequences.

Through the lens of clich√©, I explored the characters' journey to navigate the clich√©d landscapes of their existence. The town, once steeped in predictable routines, became a stage for the extraordinary. As clich√©s transformed into tangible forces, the residents of Nostalgia Haven embarked on a quest to unravel the mysteries hidden within the clich√©d fabric of their reality.

**Response to Prompt 31: Epanalepsis**

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded introspection. As I embarked on the freewriting journey, the repetition of this existential inquiry became a rhythmic pulse, guiding the exploration of diverse

perspectives on life's purpose.

For a multitude of words, the epanalepsis led me through a kaleidoscope of reflections. From the philosophical musings of scholars to the simple yet profound revelations of everyday individuals, each recurrence of the question served as a gateway into the vast tapestry of human contemplation.

Through the epanalepsis, I navigated the labyrinth of existential ponderings, unveiling the unique responses that individuals had forged in their quests for meaning. The relentless repetition became a literary heartbeat, mirroring the universal rhythm of humanity's collective pursuit of purpose and significance.

The narrative wove through the lives of characters, each grappling with the epanaleptic inquiry in their unique ways. Whether seeking solace in the grandeur of the cosmos or finding meaning in the simplicity of a shared moment, the epanalepsis remained a constant companion, echoing the perennial quest for understanding.

**Response to Prompt 36: Anadiplosis**

In the futuristic city of Quantum Heights, where technology intertwined with daily life like a seamless dance, a viral message spread‚Äîa mantra that echoed through the cybernetic veins of the metropolis. ""Create the code, the code creates reality. Reality shapes destiny, and destiny is but the code.""

The story unfolded with the rhythmic cadence of anadiplosis, each line flowing into the next, creating a recursive loop of ideas. The mantra became the heartbeat of Quantum Heights, influencing the lives of its denizens as they navigated the intricate balance between the virtual and the tangible.

Through the lens of anadiplosis, I delved into the interconnectedness of code, reality, and destiny. The lines blurred as characters harnessed the power of programming to shape their fates. Quantum Heights, once a mere city, transformed into a living algorithm, where the repetition of the mantra echoed in every pulsating byte.

**Response to Prompt 38: Asyndeton**

In the dystopian city of Emberfall, where the remnants of a fallen civilization lay entwined with the shadows of despair, a lone figure emerged‚Äîa rebel determined to dismantle the oppressive regime. The narrative unfolded with the rapid pace of asyndeton, omitting conjunctions to mirror the urgency of the protagonist's quest.

Through a cascade of words, the asyndeton propelled the reader through the city's decaying alleyways and towering citadels, each sentence building upon the last. The disjointed rhythm captured the relentless momentum of the rebel's journey, emphasizing the magnitude of the challenges faced in their struggle for freedom.

As the narrative unfurled, the absence of conjunctions served as a narrative device, intensifying the sense of urgency and desperation that permeated Emberfall. The rebel's asyndetic odyssey unfolded against a backdrop of shattered hopes and whispered rebellions, culminating in a crescendo of defiance against the oppressive regime.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The mantra echoed in the desolate wasteland of Endless Sands, a barren landscape where hope was as scarce as water. Through the repetition of epizeuxis, the protagonist's internal resolve became a resounding anthem, a defiant roar against the relentless challenges of survival.

For a multitude of words, the relentless repetition of ""never"" served as a lifeline, propelling the protagonist through the harshest of environments. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry against the oppressive silence of Endless Sands, a declaration that reverberated across the vast expanse.

Through the lens of epizeuxis, I delved into the depths of the character's determination. The harsh environment became a character in itself, challenging the protagonist to defy the odds with unwavering persistence. The echoes of ""never"" transformed into a symbol of resilience, a beacon of hope that cut through the desolation of Endless Sands.

**Response to Prompt 50: Acrostic**

Amidst the starlit expanse of Cosmos Haven, where galaxies danced in celestial choreography, a cryptic prophecy emerged‚Äîa message written in the stars. As the narrative unfolded, I embarked on a cosmic journey guided by the acrostic hidden within the constellations.

For a cascade of words, the initial letters of key phrases illuminated the path of destiny for the characters. Each sentence unfolded with intention, revealing a hidden message that transcended the boundaries of time and space. The acrostic became a celestial guide, leading the protagonists through the intricate tapestry of their interconnected fates.

Through the lens of acrostic, I explored the cosmic forces that shaped the destinies of Cosmos Haven's inhabitants. The celestial bodies became storytellers, each constellation contributing a verse to the epic narrative written across the cosmos. As the characters deciphered the acrostic, they unraveled the mysteries of their existence, connecting the dots between the stars and their own profound journeys.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

**(NETFLIX ""BUM-BUM"" LOGO)**



# COLD OPEN



**SCENE 1 INT. BOJACK'S APARTMENT - DAY**

BoJack sits alone in his apartment, staring at a small television. A news report is on. He is wearing a worn and faded black sweater and grey hoodie. The reporter, a well-groomed otter, stands outside a movie premiere.

**REPORTER:** We're here at the Hollywood premiere of the new Superhero movie, and the buzz is incredible! We're hearing about shocking twists, a surprise cameos, and even a post-credits scene that changes everything! No spoilers here, folks, but suffice to say, the ending will blow your mind! Here is what we know so far...

BoJack looks at the screen with an annoyed, resigned expression. He mutes the TV, takes a sip of his tea, and then looks at a macaroni sculpture of himself on the table.

**BOJACK:** (To himself) Goddammit.

The scene cuts to black.



# (Intro Animation)

The credits roll in a traditional animated sequence, mirroring the show's original style. The sequence begins with a close-up of **BoJack**, waking up in his prison bunk. The camera stays in a front and center shot, following him from behind as he walks down a long hallway toward the mailroom. Prisoners and guards move in the background, a silent, monotonous rhythm of prison life.

Now in the Mailroom. The scene transitions to BoJack's hands flipping through his mail. He first looks at a stack of photos:

* a shot of **Princess Carolyn**, **Judah**, and a now 7 year old **Ruthie** smiling brightly;
* a snapshot of **Diane** and her husband **Guy** in their new home in Texas;
* and then a glossy poster for a new show titled **""TV DAD: SEASON 7, COMING SOON.""**
* The next item is a well-worn copy of **""Ivy Tran: Food Court Detective.""**

And finally, he finds a few colorful, scribbled children's drawings, possibly from Ruthie? He looks at them with a small, wistful smile, admiring the naive charm of a sloppy superhero, a scribbled horse figure on a TV, and a stick figure with a yellow beanie hat. Yellow beanie? That kind of looks like...? He flips the drawing over to read the childish handwriting on the back: **""FOR BOJACK, FROM TODD.""** BoJack lets out a single, exasperated eye-roll.

The scene then focuses on a key moment: BoJack reading his release letter. The camera maintains the front-facing shot, as the jail's heavy metal gates clang open and BoJack walks out. A cab pulls up, he gets in, and the camera follows the cab as it arrives at a new, much smaller apartment. He gets out, walks into the empty apartment, and explores it very briefly, still in the front-facing shot. He falls into his bed, a tired sigh escaping him, and then he covers his eyes from a bright ceiling light. The camera pans up to the ceiling light and then pans to a television, where a news report is playing of police helicopters on the news. The music is a mournful, reflective saxophone solo.



# ACT 1: The Team Is Back



**SCENE 2 INT. BOJACK'S APARTMENT - MORNING (2025)**

The year is 2025. The morning sun, filtered through the slightly grimy window of a two-bedroom apartment in downtown Hollywoob, casts long, dusty shadows across the living room. **BoJack Horseman**, now 61, is meticulously arranging a stack of old TV Guide magazines on his coffee table, a small act of control in a life he‚Äôs trying to keep meticulously controlled.

He is wearing his new black sweater and grey hoodie. A half-finished cup of coffee sits nearby, and an ashtray holds a single, freshly extinguished cigarette. He's been out of prison for approximately three-and-a-half years now, sober, clean, and trying. Really trying. He‚Äôd traded the sprawling, melancholic grandeur of his Hollywood Hills mansion for this more modest, yet still surprisingly spacious, apartment near the Sunset Strip. The payout from ""Around"" (the rebranded Horsin' Around) had been hefty, enough to ensure a comfortable, if not extravagant, existence ‚Äì though he was more mindful of his finances now.

His star on the Strip, just a few blocks away, still occasionally graffiti'd with the word ""Neigh,"" a mild, recurring PTSD trigger that he mostly managed to breathe through. For the most part, the world had forgotten, or at least forgiven, BoJack Horseman. He was no longer the scandalous headline, just a horse who sometimes does voice-over gigs for animated films and the occasional Reese's commercials.

(SOUND of light, ambient morning city noise. BoJack's voice is slightly tight as he speaks into his phone, on speaker.)

**BOJACK:** (Into phone, slightly strained) And then she said, ""BoJack, is this a projection of your own deep-seated fear of commitment?"" And I just... I froze, Dr. Indira. I didn't know how to ""validate her feelings"" about my emotional unavailability without ""gaslighting"" her own perfectly legitimate ""lived experience.""

We hear the calm, professional voice of **DR. INDIRA**.

**DR. INDIRA (O.S.):** BoJack, we've discussed how applying therapy concepts directly to every interaction can sometimes lead to an over-intellectualization of genuine emotion. Perhaps you just felt... cornered?

**BOJACK:** Cornered? No, no, it was a perfectly legitimate use of the framework. I was attempting to, you know, ""hold space"" for her accusation. She just wasn't, uh, ""meeting me where she was at."" You know, ""active listening.""

He sighs, takes a drag from a fresh cigarette, flicking ash into an empty Reese's wrapper. A knock on the door.

(SOUND of a polite, rhythmic knocking)

**BOJACK:** (To Dr. Indira) Look, my ride's here. We can dissect my ""attachment style"" with the barista later. Gotta go. I need to practice ""radical acceptance"" of this interruption.

He hangs up without waiting for a reply. He grabs a fresh box of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups from a seemingly endless stack in his pantry. He opens the door. **TODD CHAVEZ**, now 34 (beaming), stands there with his backpack on his back. He is wearing a bright yellow beanie cap on his head, a faded red hoodie with a zipper down the front (worn open), and a plain white V-neck t-shirt underneath. On the bottom, he has on dark grey joggers with cinched cuffs at the ankles, and his feet are in a pair of dark blue sandals worn over white socks. His backpack is covered in buttons, with a ""I ‚ù§Ô∏è CONSENT"" patch in Maude's handwriting. He radiated stable, happy energy.

**TODD:** BoJack! Hey! I‚Äôm here!

**BOJACK:** (Exasperated) I know. I‚Äôm not wearing a watch, but I could set one by your arrival. What‚Äôs all this for?

Todd is holding a small, brown paper bag.

**TODD:** Oh, this is for you! It‚Äôs a celebratory macaroni sculpture! It‚Äôs us! On a couch! Maude did it! She‚Äôs really getting good at the faces. (He points to a misshapen macaroni figure) I think that‚Äôs you!

**BOJACK:** (Sighs, but takes it) Okay. Thanks, Todd. I‚Äôll put it next to the other one. So, you ready for the movie? The new Superman reboot? I haven‚Äôt been to a real movie theater since I was in my own personal lockdown. But I figure, if anyone can get me out of the house, it's an alien with a jerry curl who wears his shorts on the outside.

**TODD:** Yeah, I know! It‚Äôs gonna be great! Maude had to finish a big order for ‚ÄúGoofball Goods,‚Äù so I‚Äôm picking up some supplies for her. We got some time to kill before the show, so I figured we could hang out until then. Also, BoJack, why DOES he wear his shorts on the outside? (Gasps) Is THAT where he gets his powers? Should WE be wearing our undies on the outside too?? (Todd reaches for his pants)

**BOJACK:** Stop! (A beat, then a deep sigh) Okay, Todd. First of all, it's a movie. Second... he gets his power from the sun. Seriously, have you NOT seen *Superman: The Movie*? He is a symbol of hope. An American icon! He's the ultimate ""Good Guy.""

**TODD:** Yeah, but in the old movies I saw, he kept punching things into dust. I actually thought he was the villain, he was wearing all black and smashing things.

**BOJACK:** (Stares at him) That's because the ""Old Movie"" you're talking about came out ten years ago. When everything was a gritty reboot. No, this time it's James Gunn. It's basically going to be a feel good cartoon. Which is **EXACTLY** what **we** need right now.

**TODD:** Oh. Who directed the other one? Quinten Teranchelino? Those were dark.

**BOJACK:** (Stares at him, then a small smile) No, that was Zack Snyder. Don't feel bad. You‚Äôre just young and stupid, Todd. That‚Äôs not a crime. Anyway, I met James Gunn once. He offered me a part, you know.

**TODD:** A part in a movie by James Gunn?! Why didn‚Äôt you take it?!

**BOJACK:** (A smirk) Because it was for some dumb-sounding 70's style sci-fi porno. The role was for some alien guy called‚Ä¶ ""Star-Lord."" In '*Protectors of the Universe'*, or something like that. I was a little drunk when they read the pitch to me. Of course, I found out later that Chris Pratt nabbed the role. Funny, I never took him for the type. I haven't seen it.



# ACT 2: The Rising Action



**SCENE 3 EXT. HOLLYWOOB STREETS - DAY**

Todd's Subaru Impala weaves through the bustling streets of downtown Hollywoob, though for much of the journey, BoJack and Todd are on foot, navigating the urban landscape. The air is thick with the scent of street food and exhaust fumes.

(MUSIC: ""The Boys Are Back in Town"" by Thin Lizzy.)

The music is a great contrast to the mundane, everyday life of BoJack and Todd. We see a montage of them driving past Hollywood landmarks, a series of quick cuts that shows their journey and the world they are now living in.

**SHOT 1:** They drive past a giant billboard for a celebrity gossip podcast. The hosts are yelling, ‚ÄúCan you believe what happened to Superman?!‚Äù BoJack quickly covers his ears, and Todd swerves a little bit, his face in a panic. **SHOT 2:** They drive past a group of protesters outside a movie theater, holding signs with spoilers on them. Todd honks, and BoJack shields his eyes with a magazine. A small child on a scooter is holding a sign with a spoiler. **SHOT 3:** A close-up of a radio dial in the van. BoJack quickly turns the radio off as a news anchor begins to say, ‚ÄúAnd now, for your daily recap of the Superman movie‚Ä¶‚Äù **SHOT 4:** The van drives past a man on a bicycle with an open bag of popcorn. BoJack shouts, ""I'm not going to miss it, I'm not!"" The man looks confused, and then a bird person swoops down and takes some of his popcorn.

(The montage ends, and we pick up with them on foot, navigating the urban landscape.)

Their first ""side adventure"" began almost immediately. As they navigated, they spotted a rogue billboard truck stuck in traffic, its digital screen flashing through various movie ads. BoJack and Todd instinctively ducked behind a hot dog stand, peering over the counter.

**BOJACK:** (Whispering, his eyes wide with panic) Is that... is that the S logo? They're going to spoil the entire movie!

**TODD:** Stay low, BoJack! Stay low! It's a trap! They're trying to get us!

The truck slowly rolled past, revealing a massive, high-definition image of Superman, mid-flight, with a giant, glowing caption: **""HE FLIES! HE FIGHTS! HE... FINDS A NEW BEST FRIEND!""**

BoJack groaned.

**BOJACK:** A new best friend? That's it? That's the big reveal? I wasted a whole morning avoiding that?

**TODD:** It's not a spoiler if it's vague, BoJack! It could be anyone! A squirrel! A particularly friendly lamp! (His own shoulders slump slightly.) Sometimes, BoJack, the biggest spoilers aren't the ones you hear, but the ones you imagine. Or the ones you put on yourself.

BoJack just grunted, not quite getting it.

The ""Todd Chronicles"" continued. As they walked, Todd spotted a group of street performers dressed as various superheroes, including a very enthusiastic, but slightly off-key, Superduperman.

**TODD:** BoJack! Look! They're doing a flash mob tribute! We have to join! It'll be a great distraction!

**BOJACK:** (Resisting) Todd, no! They'll sing the plot! They always sing the plot! It's a musical number waiting to spoil my entire afternoon!

But Todd, ever the optimist, was already attempting to mimic his best Superduperman flying pose, arms outstretched, much to the confusion of the actual performers. BoJack, mortified, tried to drag him away, inadvertently tripping over a discarded scooter and landing in a pile of discarded flyers for a new vegan smoothie bar.

**BOJACK:** (Muttering from the ground) My ""emotional regulation"" is at a critical low, Todd.

**TODD:** See, BoJack? We're blending in! No one suspects a thing!



# ACT 3: The Climax and Resolution



**SCENE 3 EXT. MOVIE PREMIERE - DAY**

As they finally approached the cinema, a massive crowd had gathered. A giant, inflatable Superman blimp was being inflated for a promotional stunt, but something was wrong. It was wobbling, sagging, and slowly deflating, its once-heroic form turning into a sad, rubbery blob. The crowd was pointing, laughing, and, worst of all, shouting.

(SOUND of crowd murmurs, distant paparazzi flashes, movie trailer audio (brief, heroic fanfare), followed by the sound of a loud, ripping fabric, then a slow, mournful whoosh of air escaping. Crowd gasps and murmurs rise.)

**VOICE 1 (O.S.):** Oh my god, the blimp's going down! It's just like the scene in the movie!

BoJack froze, his eyes wide with horror, connecting the deflating blimp to the movie's plot.

**BOJACK:** (Whispering to Todd, eyes wide) Oh my god. Oh my god, it's a sign! Does he die in the movie!? They end him! The franchise collapses! Oh, this is it, this is the end, everything's a failure! I can't do it, Todd. It's too much stress for me. We should have gone to watch The Room instead. No one ever spoils The Room.

Todd, seeing BoJack's distress, quickly tried to shield him, but it was too late. The day was a bust.

As if on cue, a shadow passed over them. They looked up. Slowly, majestically, a giant blimp shaped like a grinning hot dog began to deflate, sinking gracefully towards the Hollywood sign, its cheerful cartoon face wrinkling into a worried frown as it lost air.

**TODD:** Huh. That's new.

**BOJACK:** Is that... advertising for a sad hot dog stand? Because it's effective.

**TODD:** Two defalting blimps in one day? What is it with blimps in this town? (Todd asks genuinely confused)

They watched, mesmerized, as the blimp settled gently onto the hillside, like a tired sausage taking a nap. It was the kind of surreal, nonsensical event that could only happen in Hollywoob.

Just as BoJack was about to suggest another wildly inefficient way to pass the time, his phone vibrated. A call from **Princess Carolyn**. He rarely got calls from PC outside of official business. His stomach did a little flip.

**SCENE 4 EXT. HOLLYWOOB STREETS - CONTINUOUS**

BoJack answers his phone, Princess Carolyn's voice a familiar whirlwind of controlled panic on the other end. PC is 51, likely in her green dress, yellow sweater, and red shoes.

(SOUND of Princess Carolyn's phone ringing (upbeat, slightly frantic ringtone))

**BOJACK:** (Into phone, trying to sound nonchalant) Hey, PC.

**PRINCESS CAROLYN (O.S.):** BoJack! Thank god you picked up! Look, I know this is last minute, but I have an emergency! The voice actor for 'Old Man Whiskers' ‚Äì you know, that new animated series about the grumpy old Beaver? ‚Äì he just had an allergic reaction to a particularly pungent pinecone. Irony! Anyway, we need someone to step in for the last few lines. You're the only one I can think of who can nail that weary old beaver cadence. Can you be at the studio in forty-five minutes?

BoJack‚Äôs mind raced. An emergency recording session. That meant‚Ä¶ missing the movie. His perfect, spoiler-free ""Superduperman"" experience.

**BOJACK:** PC, I‚Ä¶ I have plans. Very important, spoiler-sensitive plans. My ""emotional regulation"" is already at an all-time low. My ""window of tolerance"" has been breached like a bad dam, and you're asking me to patch it with... beaver grunts?

**PRINCESS CAROLYN (O.S.):** BoJack, this is a crisis! It's a six-figure deal on the line! This is work! Real work! Not shilling for sugary snacks! Oh, and speaking of big deals, Diane's publicist called earlier. Her new book, *Everywhere All At Once*, is getting a massive tour. Sounds like her first major West Coast stop is going to be right here in Hollywoob next month.

BoJack winced at the ""sugary snacks"" jab, but the mention of Diane caught his ear. His hand, which was resting on the phone, tightened just a bit before he quickly refocused on his immediate dilemma.

**BOJACK:** (A new glint in his eye, a mischievous shift in tone) Tell you what, PC. I'll do it. I'll give you the most existentially dreadful rodent they've ever heard. But I have one condition. After the session, I get a private screening of 'Superman.' In one of your VIP theaters. With no one else in it. No phones. No spoilers. Just me, Todd, and the Caped Man. I need to experience that movie in pure, unadulterated, spoiler-free bliss. My ""nervous system"" needs this.

A pause on the other end. We can hear PC turn to Judah off-screen. **Judah**, dressed the same but without his jacket, with a sweater tied around his neck like a dad style, calmly brings her a file.

**PRINCESS CAROLYN (O.S.):** (Through gritted teeth) BoJack, that's‚Ä¶ ridiculous. An entire theater? It's expensive. And frankly, after that blimp incident, they're on high alert. Apparently, some wild kid was seen tampering with the inflation valves. Little menace! No more private screenings for anyone! They haven't given people that much free space since the pandemic. Its a miracle we were able to pull the wedding off, without everyone accusing us of hosting a ""Super Spreader"".

**BOJACK:** (Pressing his advantage) Take it or leave it, PC. Old Man Whiskers sounds like he needs a drink, and so do I. But I'm not having one. So I need something! I need to watch a goddamned movie.

Another pause.

**PRINCESS CAROLYN (O.S.):** (A defeated, yet ultimately determined sigh) Fine. But you owe me. Big time! See you in forty.

BoJack hung up, a strange mix of triumph and dread swirling within him. He turned to Todd, who was now attempting to communicate with the deflated hot dog blimp using interpretive dance.

**BOJACK:** Good news, Todd. We're getting a private screening of Superman.

Todd froze mid-pirouette.

**TODD:** Really?! How?!

**BOJACK:** Bad news, we have to go record some voice-over first. For Princess Carolyn. About a weary old badger.

Todd's face fell for a moment.

**TODD:** Oh. But‚Ä¶ private screening! (His enthusiasm quickly returned, his face lighting up.) That's awesome! We're like‚Ä¶ VIPs! Very Important‚Ä¶ People‚Ä¶ who watch movies‚Ä¶ privately! Woohoo!

BoJack just sighed, a plume of cigarette smoke curling into the clear Los Angeles sky. He hailed a cab. The day was far from over. And the weight of not knowing what was coming next, both in the movie and in his own life, was surprisingly‚Ä¶ heavy.

(SOUND of a contented, but weary, sigh from BoJack.)  
  
  
**OUTRO MUSIC**

Back in the 90's, I was in a Very Famous T\~ V\~ show!

I'm BoJack, the Horse\~ ""BoJack!"" BoJack the Horse, Don't act like Youuuu Don't Know. And I'm trying, to Hold on To My Past... Its been so long, I don't think I'm gonna Last...

I guess I'm just trying to make you understand... That I'm more Horse, than a man...

Or I'm more Man, than a Horse... Bo-Jack!



**EXT. ABANDONED LOT - NIGHT**

**Mr. Peanutbutter**, now 56, is at a hastily arranged press conference, standing proudly next to the now mostly deflated, but still recognizable, Superduperman blimp. He's wearing a cheap shiny cape over his business suit, slightly askew.

(SOUND of flashing cameras, crowd murmurs, Mr. Peanutbutter's enthusiastic voice.)

**MR. PEANUTBUTTER:** Yes, folks, a tragic day for aerial heroism, but a glorious day for... resilience! The culprit behind this blimp-based brouhaha is still at large, but I, Mr. Peanutbutter, vow to find them! And when I do, I will offer them a lifetime supply of my new 'Superduperman-Approved, Gluten-Free, Anti-Spoiler Dog Biscuits'! Because even villains deserve a healthy snack! What could possibly go wrong?!

A reporter raises a hand.

**REPORTER (O.S.):** Mr. Peanutbutter, is it true the blimp was deflated by a small shadowy figure with claws and teeth, are they specifically targeting blimps, are blimps no longer safe in Los Angeles?

Mr. Peanutbutter laughs heartily, his eyes wide and innocent.

**MR. PEANUTBUTTER:** A shadowy figure with claws and teeth? That's ridiculous! Sounds like a character from a very niche animated show! No, no, this was clearly the work of... The Flying Inflatable Deflators League! And I, Mr. Peanutbutter, will stop them! For truth! For justice! And for delicious, spoiler-free dog treats!

He winks at the camera, completely missing the point, as the blimp behind him lets out a final, sad hiss of air.

(SOUND of a final, sad hiss of air from the blimp.)

The 2025 market offers a range of coffee pot and grinder combos that aim to deliver this convenience. For coffee enthusiasts who value both fresh flavor and ease of use, thes all-in-one machines can be a game-changer, eliminating the need for separate appliances and streamlining the coffee-making process.

They promise to bring cafe-quality coffee into your home with minimal effort. let's explore the top models and determine wich offers the best value and performance.

[[Explore Top Rated coffee pot and grinder combo on Amazon.]](https://site.properlygeek.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=coffee pot and grinder combo)

## Key Features analysis

The models in our review showcase a variety of features designed to improve the coffee-making experience. From grind settings to brewing options, these details set the top contenders apart.

**integrated Burr Grinder:** This is the heart of any coffee pot and grinder combo.Burr grinders, unlike blade grinders, produce a consistent grind size, which is crucial for proper extraction and optimal flavor. Look for models with adjustable grind settings, allowing you to fine-tune the grind to match your preferred brewing method and coffee beans.

The best machines use conical or flat burrs made of hardened steel or ceramic. Steel burrs tend to be more durable, while ceramic burrs produce less heat during grinding, preserving the delicate aromas of the coffee. The capacity of the bean hopper is another important consideration. A larger hopper means you won't need to refill it as frequently enough, but it also exposes the beans to air for longer, perhaps affecting freshness.

**Programmable Timer and Automatic Brewing:** convenience is a major selling point of these combos. A programmable timer allows you to set the machine to grind and brew your coffee at a specific time, so you can wake up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee every morning.

Automatic brewing ensures that the entire process ‚Äì grinding, tamping (in some models), and brewing ‚Äì happens automatically. Look for machines with intuitive controls and a clear display for easy programming. Some models also offer features like automatic shut-off for safety and energy efficiency.

**Water Reservoir Capacity and Filtration:** The capacity of the water reservoir determines how many cups of coffee you can brew at once. Consider your household's coffee consumption when choosing a model, with larger reservoirs suitable for families or those who entertain frequently.

Water filtration is also important, as it removes impurities and improves the taste of your coffee. Many models come with built-in charcoal water filters that shoudl be replaced regularly. Some also feature water level indicators, allowing you to easily see how much water is in the reservoir.

**Brew Strength Control:** Many coffee lovers have a preferred brew strength, and the models that offer brew strength controls allow users to taylor their coffee to individual palates. Users can generally choose options like mild,medium or strong,giving more versatility over the coffee making process.

This is frequently enough achieved by adjusting the amount of water used per gram of coffee grounds, allowing for a richer, bolder flavor. Coupled with a good grind setting, brewing settings allow you to achieve levels of quality and convenience not regularly available on standalone pot and grinder combos.

**Carafe Type and material:** The carafe keeps the coffee hot after brewing. The material of the carafe, whether it's glass or thermal stainless steel, substantially impacts heat retention. Glass carafes typically sit on a warming plate, which can lead to burnt coffee if left on for too long. Thermal stainless steel carafes, on the other hand, are vacuum-insulated and keep coffee hot for hours without a warming plate.

The carafe should also have a drip-free spout for easy pouring and cleanup. Consider the size and shape of the carafe as well, ensuring it's easy to handle and fits comfortably on your countertop. many thermal carafes are designed with narrow mouths to minimize heat loss.

## Core Benefits

These coffee pot and grinder combos offer a range of benefits for coffee lovers looking for convenience and quality.

**Freshly Ground Coffee, Automatically:** One of the biggest benefits is the ability to enjoy freshly ground coffee without the need for separate appliances. The integrated grinder ensures that your coffee is ground right before brewing, maximizing flavor and aroma.

The automation of the grinding and brewing process saves time and effort,especially in the morning when you're in a rush. Simply add beans and water, set the timer (if desired), and let the machine do the rest. The result is a delicious cup of coffee made with minimal fuss.

**Consistent Grind Quality:** burr grinders provide consistent grind size, which is essential for even extraction and optimal flavor. Different grind sizes are suitable for different brewing methods, so having adjustable grind settings allows you to experiment and find the perfect grind for your preferences.

A consistent grind ensures that all the coffee grounds are exposed to the same amount of water during brewing, preventing under-extraction (sour taste) or over-extraction (bitter taste).This leads to a smoother, more balanced cup of coffee.

**Space Saving Design:** By combining the grinder and coffee maker into one appliance, these combos save valuable counter space. This is particularly beneficial for those with smaller kitchens.

A single appliance also means fewer cords and less visual clutter. the integrated design creates a cleaner, more organized coffee station. The models are carefully designed to fit seamlessly into the modern kitchen.

**Customizable Brewing Options:** Programmable timers and brew strength settings allow you to tailor your coffee to your exact preferences. Wake up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee with the perfect strength to start your day.

These options empower users to experiment and create the perfect cup of coffee. With the capacity to adjust every brewing element, this functionality creates an improved level of control. This control is generally impossible with traditional pre-ground coffee brewing.

## FAQs Section

Consumers considering these products often have similar questions about compatibility, maintenance, and performance. Below is a detailed rundown.

**How frequently enough do I need to clean the grinder?**
The frequency of cleaning depends on your usage. For best results, the grinder should be cleaned once a week if you brew daily. This prevents the buildup of coffee oils that can affect the taste of your coffee and the performance of the grinder.

Simple cleaning can be done with a brush, while a deeper clean should be performed monthly, using dedicated grinder cleaner tablets or rice. make sure to consult your user manual for specific instructions. Regular cleaning will ensure the grinder continues to function properly and produce consistent results.

**What type of coffee beans work best with these machines?**
Most coffee pot and grinder combos are designed to work with whole bean coffee. avoid using pre-ground coffee, as it can clog the grinder. Medium roast beans generally work well, but you can experiment with different roasts to find your preference.

Oily or flavored beans may require more frequent cleaning of the grinder, as they can leave a residue. Always check your user manual for recommended bean types. Certain models, depending on the age and manufacturer, may operate in a highly specific way regarding bean type.

**How do I descale the coffee maker?**
Descaling is necessary to remove mineral buildup from the water reservoir and heating elements. The frequency of descaling depends on the hardness of your water. Typically, you should descale your coffee maker every 1-3 months.

You can use a commercial descaling solution or a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and water. Follow the instructions in your user manual, which usually involves running the descaling solution through the brewing cycle and then rinsing with clean water. Descaling helps maintain the performance and longevity of your coffee maker. As with bean-type compatibility, manuals should be consulted for highly specific operation.

**How Long Does A Combination Coffee Maker last?**
With proper care, a combination coffee maker should work effectively for an average of 3-5 years. This lifespan can be extended through regular cleaning, descaling, and appropriate use of the grinder.

High-Quality models with durable components may outlast standard models. Purchasing an additional warranty or service plan may also be a good idea depending on your budget and purchasing strategy.

1mkpnvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyderabad/comments/1mkpnvl/fellow_hyderabadis_do_you_also_get_stuck_choosing/,Fellow Hyderabadis - Do you also get stuck choosing what to order on Swiggy/Zomato?,"**Quick question for everyone:** How long do you usually spend browsing through Swiggy/Zomato before actually ordering something?

I'm asking because I'm working on an idea to solve this exact problem and want to know if other people in Hyderabad face this too.

# The Problem I'm Trying to Solve

You know that feeling when you open Swiggy, see 50+ restaurants in areas like Gachibowli or Banjara Hills, each with massive menus, and somehow you still can't decide what you want? You scroll through Paradise, Mehfil, Cafe Bahar, Shah Ghouse... and 20 minutes later you're still staring at your phone.

# My Solution: A ""Tinder for Food"" App

Here's what I'm building:

* **Simple swiping:** See one dish at a time with a great photo
* **Swipe left:** Not interested
* **Swipe right:** Want this!
* **Algorithm learns:** Gets smarter about your taste (loves biryani? prefers Irani chai over filter coffee?)
* **Quick ordering:** Either instant checkout or build a cart

Think about it - instead of browsing through Paradise's 47 biryani variations, you just see ""Hyderabadi Mutton Dum Biryani"" with a beautiful photo. Swipe right if you want it, left if you don't.

# Why Hyderabad First?

Starting with Hyderabad because:

* High food delivery usage (especially in IT areas)
* Great food culture but also decision paralysis
* Mix of traditional spots (Charminar area) and modern restaurants (Hitec City)
* Perfect test market for the concept

# What I Need From You

**Honest feedback:**

* Do you actually face this ""decision fatigue"" problem?
* Would you try an app like this?
* What areas would you want covered first? (Gachibowli, Kondapur, Banjara Hills, etc.)
* Any Hyderabad-specific food ordering habits I should know about?

**Quick poll in comments:**

* How often do you spend 10+ minutes just deciding what to order?
* What's your go-to when you can't decide? (Always order the same thing? Close the app? Ask family?)

# Restaurant Folks

If you run a restaurant in Hyderabad - would you be interested in an AI tool that takes your dish photo and automatically creates the menu description? Trying to make it easier for restaurants too.

Really appreciate any thoughts! Planning to start with a small pilot in one area if there's enough interest.

**TL;DR:** Building Tinder-style food app to solve menu decision paralysis. Does this problem exist for you Hyderabadis or am I overthinking it?",2,1754641509.0,hyderabad,1,1.0,False

\[32 M\] Visiting San Francisco (Bay Area) Again - Curious about Nudism & Chill Hangs  
  
Hello. I am a 32-year-old guy heading to San Francisco next week for work, and I'm hoping to explore nudism a bit while I'm there. I will be in town starting this coming Monday (August 5 in the morning) and through the weekend. My company has just opened an office, so trips will be pretty frequent.

I grew up in a pretty conservative home, and honestly, I think this could be a great step for body confidence and a way to genuinely relax and feel more comfortable in my own skin.

By day, I'm a software engineer, but outside of that, I'm usually lost in a book or out exploring.

I'm open to any¬†low-key nudist events¬†that might be happening next week. But honestly, I'd also really appreciate connecting with someone¬†like-minded¬†for a casual coffee, or even just a chill hang-out at my hotel if it feels right. Just looking for comfortable, easygoing connections.

If you're in the SF area and this sounds like something you'd be open to, feel free to send me a message.",2,1754641503.0,NudistMeetup,1,0.67,False

* Don‚Äôt attract attention.
* Don‚Äôt use magic in front of humans (see rule #1).
* And above all else, avoid letters sealed with black wax‚Äîespecially those bearing the thorny crest of Blackthorn Keep.

She‚Äôd been doing fine. Great, actually.

Until today.

Mo took a slow breath, inhaling the mingled scents of aged paper, freshly ground beans, and the hint of cinnamon from today‚Äôs special. This cozy bookstore caf√© was her sanctuary, where Edison bulbs cast honey-gold light over worn armchairs and shelves bent under the weight of a thousand worlds. Here, the only magic came from stories, not bloodlines.

She ran her fingers across a worn counter, her gaze drifting over the familiar spines that lined every wall. She chose this place after a long deliberation and intense search, tucked away from the world. A place where she was just Mo‚Äîthe friendly barista who gave great book recommendations and knew how to craft the perfect latte art.

Returning from her reverie, Mo froze. The cup of latte she‚Äôd been preparing hovered a centimeter above the counter, spinning lazily counter-clockwise, foam swirling into intricate patterns no barista course had taught her. The cinnamon sprinkles arranged themselves into what looked suspiciously like ancient runes.

‚ÄúDamn it,‚Äù she hissed, fingers clenching as she forced the cup down with a soft clink. ‚ÄúGet it together, Mo.‚Äù

Clinking softly, the cup dropped back on the saucer and stopped shifting. It was a tiny piece of magic, but even that wasn‚Äôt wise in a life she wanted to keep as ordinary as possible. Of course, books fluttering closed on their own or dishes floating for a second. Those tricks were easy to dismiss as imagination or coincidence.

Mo knew she shouldn‚Äôt do that. She craved normalcy. But these little sparks of power were the only nod to a past she kept buried.

Late-afternoon sunlight streamed through dusty windows, illuminating dust motes that danced in the warm air. Mo restocked the shelves with the latest arrivals, brushing her fingertips across the colorful spines. A young girl tugged at her sleeve, eyes wide with excitement.

‚ÄúExcuse me, do you have any books about dragons?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbsolutely,‚Äù Mo replied, guiding the girl to a shelf packed with fantasy novels. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find plenty of adventures here. If you want to test them first, you can sit in those cozy armchairs over there.‚Äù

Soon, the girl‚Äôs laughter rang like a bell as she flipped through the pages, enthralled by fire-breathing beasts and brave heroes. Mo couldn‚Äôt help but smile, seeing a child who had never experienced an encounter with a real dragon. In moments like this, she felt at peace‚Äîno mention of her odd last name or reminders of the inheritance that loomed in the background.

A gray-haired guy with a kind smile was waiting when she returned to the counter. Mo frothed the milk and poured it into a cup, shaping a perfect leaf on the surface. The man reached for his latte and gave her an appreciative nod.

‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs just perfect,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like it was 3D-printed! Or...‚Äù he paused dramatically. ‚ÄúMade with magic!‚Äù

‚ÄúHa-ha! Just my trained hands here,‚Äù answered Mo with a smile, showing her open palms.

The ease of these interactions. Absence of manipulative tactics. Ordinary chatter, friendly faces, no family secrets. Mo loved all of that.

Soon after the man left, the brass bell above the door fell silent mid-chime. A sudden chill slithered across the floorboards, turning the cozy warmth brittle. Mo‚Äôs spine went rigid before she even turned. The espresso machine sputtered and died. Every light dimmed as if something were drinking the electricity.

Perched on the window sill was a raven, its feathers so black they seemed to swallow the afternoon sunlight. Its eyes‚Äîtoo knowing, too ancient‚Äîfixed on Mo with unmistakable recognition. The dishcloth slipped from her fingers as memories she‚Äôd spent years burying clawed their way to the surface.

The raven hopped onto a table, silent and still, a cold presence in a place meant for warmth and laughter. A place that Mo chose explicitly for its mundanity. Mo willed it to leave, but instead, the raven tilted his head and dropped a letter onto the tabletop. The envelope didn‚Äôt have a name or a return address on it. Instead, it was sealed with black wax.

Mo‚Äôs stomach churned.

She recognized the crest pressed into that seal: a twisted, thorny emblem from a place she made so many efforts to forget. Taking a tremulous breath, Mo approached, snatching the letter before any of her customers noticed. Even if it was hard to hope that no one wouldn‚Äôt be surprised by a large black bird sitting on the table indoors.

‚ÄúPlease go,‚Äù she whispered, heart hammering in her chest. ‚ÄúYou are starting to attract attention.‚Äù

The raven only cocked his head, black eyes reflecting the warm golden light of the caf√©. Then he spoke in a rasping croak that sent a tremor up her spine: ‚ÄúAlright, alright. I‚Äôm out of here‚Äîhappy now?‚Äù

Before Mo could reply, the bird fluttered his wings and vanished through the open door. She stared after him, the echo of that ragged voice lodging in her mind.

Pressing the letter against her apron, Mo fought the urge to tear it up on the spot. But she knew better than to destroy the message. Surprisingly, no one else in the caf√© seemed to notice anything unusual. It was as if the door had never opened, and the raven had never let itself inside.

Mo went back to the counter. Nothing changed in the space around her. But now, she could see all the books that had been returned to the wrong places by the customers. All the cracks of the ancient counter. All the spots on the tables that she could never fully clean up.

With forced composure, Mo slipped the envelope into a drawer beneath the register. She wasn‚Äôt going to open it. Not yet. Not ever, if she could help it. But her heart refused to slow, and a faint hum of dread settled over her day.

Mo locked up the caf√© that evening. Flipping the sign on the door to¬†*Closed*, she prepared herself for the last chores of the late shift. She still had to prepare the place for the morning.

The hush that fell over the store was usually her favorite part of the day, a time when the only sounds were the soft settling of books and the faint whir of cooling coffee machines. Tonight, though, the silence pressed on her like a weight. She glanced toward the drawer where the letter lay hidden. It felt like the letter pulsed with power she couldn‚Äôt ignore.

Shaking off her nerves, Mo finished wiping down the tables. A flicker at the window snagged her attention. She turned, heart stuttering. Outside, a raven perched on the streetlamp, illuminated by the dim glow. He stared straight into the bookstore, straight at her.

Her throat tightened. ‚ÄúNot tonight,‚Äù she muttered. ‚ÄúPlease, not tonight.‚Äù

But the raven didn‚Äôt leave until she shut off the lights. And even then, he lingered for a few minutes as if making sure that he wasn‚Äôt getting an answer any time soon.

By the next afternoon, Mo had almost convinced herself it was all a bad dream. She greeted regulars with a cheery smile and recommended titles to curious newcomers. But tension coiled beneath her friendly demeanor.

‚ÄúHey, Mo,‚Äù a voice called from across the room, breaking the spell of her little moment. It was Mrs. Harlow, a regular who always came in for her afternoon tea and a chat. ‚ÄúI never paid attention to your last name. But, you know, I‚Äôve been reading the schedule of the restroom cleaning shifts‚Ä¶ hm‚Ä¶ in the restroom. And saw it near your name. Nightshade? That‚Äôs a peculiar last name, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

Mo forced a laugh.

‚ÄúMy parents are goths‚Äîsuper into spooky stuff,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt yet heard my full first name. It‚Äôs all, uh, part of the family brand.‚Äù

Mrs. Harlow chuckled, picked up a book, and returned to her table, seemingly satisfied. Mo exhaled, grateful the conversation hadn‚Äôt gone further. Sharing too much of her family‚Äôs history was never a safe thing.

She returned to organizing the shelves, smoothing out the covers. Then, out of the corner of her eye, she saw him again: the raven.

He was perched on a ledge just outside the window. At least the raven wasn‚Äôt trying to sneak in anymore. But something had to be done about it. And done soon.

Mo tried to focus on the caf√© chatter, the hiss of the espresso machine, anything to distract herself. But every glance at the window revealed the same glossy black wings and those eerie, unblinking eyes.

Refusing to give in to panic, Mo summoned a tiny flicker of magic to steady the pile of books in her arms. They floated gently from her hands onto the shelf. She never allowed herself to do this, afraid of rumors and misunderstandings. Still, it centered her and gave her a small opportunity to do something that was second nature to her.

The sensation was so good that Mo almost took solace in its neatness. Both the magical action and the result. Until the raven fluttered his wings in what looked like a mocking response.

He saw.

Another shift ended, and Mo found herself alone. The lights dimmed, and the doors locked. She pulled open the drawer beneath the counter. The letter, sealed with black wax, looked at her ominously. Of course, it didn‚Äôt literally¬†*look*¬†at Mo. But she felt its pointed attention.

After a moment‚Äôs hesitation, Mo set it on the countertop, staring at the elaborate crest pressed into the seal.

*Blackthorn Keep.*

It was a name that brought a storm of memories‚Äîher parents, old halls echoing with spells, the claustrophobic weight of a legacy she never asked for. The darkness.

Her throat constricted. And when she took it in her hands, the letter felt heavier than paper should be.

‚ÄúJust burn it,‚Äù she whispered to herself. ‚ÄúNo more nightmares, no more ravens.‚Äù

Yet her feet didn‚Äôt move. She didn‚Äôt go to pick up a pan or a pot in which she could safely destroy this envelope. She wrestled with indecision, the hush of the store closing in around her. Finally, Mo snatched the letter and headed into the kitchen. But as soon as she struck a match, the door at the back of the caf√© flew open, hitting the wall with a dull thud.

Mo spun around to find the raven standing in the doorway‚Äîlooming even larger than before, his feathers so black that it felt like they had absorbed the dim light. One moment, he stood there; the next, he beat his wings and vanished, leaving only a swirl of cold air and the feeling that something ancient was watching.

The letter slipped from Mo‚Äôs fingers, landing on the floor before she could put it to flames. She gasped, heart thudding, and picked it up again. Magic tingled at her fingertips, an unwanted reminder of her true identity.

This time, she took the letter home. The whole night, it lay on her small kitchen table, and Mo almost sensed whispers crawling into her dreams. She wasn‚Äôt even sure if it were really dreams or something else. But when the first light of the new day crept from behind the curtain, Mo felt like she hadn‚Äôt slept even a minute.

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

Early the next morning, Mo stood‚Äîher hands on her hips‚Äîin the entrance hall of her apartment. From this spot, she could see the letter still waiting for her on the kitchen table. She hoped it wouldn‚Äôt be there. A girl could dream, right? But, of course, it didn‚Äôt move even a millimeter.

‚ÄúA quick peek,‚Äù she muttered. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll decide.‚Äù

She took a few decisive steps, approached the table, and broke the seal with one quick motion. The letter‚Äôs script was ornate, almost archaic. Proper. At the top, it bore the crest of the High Council, along with an urgent summons:

*By order of the High Council, Morgana Nightshade is summoned to Blackthorn Keep. Your parents have gone missing. As the statutory waiting time has elapsed, your inheritance has to be claimed. Your presence is required immediately.*

Mo‚Äôs blood turned to ice.¬†*Missing?*¬†That couldn‚Äôt be right. They might have been distant and wrapped up in their own affairs. They left all the time for their weird projects and escapades. But her parents never just vanished.

Anger welled in her‚Äîwas this some twisted ploy to lure her back?

However‚Ä¶ Her father, who‚Äôd grown increasingly paranoid in those last months before she left. What if their disappearance wasn‚Äôt voluntary? She left the Keep on purpose. But she still cared about the connection she had to her parents. Especially her mother.

Slamming the letter on the table, she paced the tiny apartment. Mo wanted her quiet life, her bookstore caf√©, her beloved, mundane routine. She wasn‚Äôt the wandering heir to a dangerous legacy; she was just Mo, the barista who recommended great reads.

Yet the words on the page refused to fade. She thought of that unnatural raven. Of course, she knew him. She had known him well since her earliest childhood. Mo recognized him at first sight.

And the creeping shadows in her apartment, and the faint hum of magic in her veins that had felt so alive since the letter arrived. In the pit of her stomach, she knew that ignoring the summons wouldn‚Äôt make them go away.

A soft ping from the bell at the register drew her attention. Mrs. Chen stood there, holding a worn paperback.

‚ÄúThis one again?‚Äù Mo smiled, recognizing the third book in a fantasy series about a reluctant chosen one. ‚ÄúI thought you finished it last week.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy granddaughter loved it so much, I‚Äôm getting her her own copy.‚Äù Mrs. Chen‚Äôs eyes crinkled. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just like the hero‚Äîsays she doesn‚Äôt want to be special, but...‚Äù She shrugged knowingly.

Mo‚Äôs smile faltered. The words struck something buried deep, a memory of her mother‚Äôs voice: ‚ÄúSometimes, Mo, we run from what we‚Äôre meant to be. But destiny... it has a way of finding us. The trick is to choose your path before it chooses for you.‚Äù

She shook off the memory, wrapping the book with practiced efficiency. But the echo lingered, like the scent of midnight roses her mother used to grow in their conservatory‚Äîbeautiful, deadly, and impossible to ignore.

Despite everything that was happening in her life, despite the ominous news about her parents, Mo went through the motions‚Äîserving customers at the caf√©, chatting about novels, and restocking shelves. But she caught herself flinching at every slight movement of shadow. More than once, she saw a flicker of black outside the windows. Whether it was the same raven or her rattled imagination, she couldn‚Äôt say.

Mr. Thompson, another regular, known for his mystery-novel obsessions, noticed her mood. ‚ÄúYou all right, Mo? You seem a bit on edge today. Do you need any help?‚Äù

Mo mustered a tight smile. ‚ÄúJust didn‚Äôt sleep well, Mr. T. Everything‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

He nodded sympathetically. ‚ÄúWell, take care of yourself, kiddo. Sleep is important. When you don‚Äôt sleep, you start to see all sorts of strange things!‚Äù

Eh‚Ä¶ What did¬†*he*¬†know about strange things? And it wasn‚Äôt like Mo didn‚Äôt try to sleep. But the pull of the letter buzzed at the back of her mind like a persistent wasp. Each hour that passed felt heavier, as if time itself was thickening around her. She could almost feel the whole weight of Blackthorn Keep pressing on her, calling her name with a voice that echoed through centuries of her family‚Äôs lineage.

That evening, she stood alone in her apartment, watching shadows gather in the corners. Mo couldn‚Äôt force herself to step into the kitchen and hadn‚Äôt even grabbed anything to eat yet. The letter lay on her kitchen table. Of course, where would it go from there?

A small, half-packed suitcase sat by the door‚Äîa grudging admission that she might have to leave.

Slowly, she stretched her hand and turned on the light. It was as if the decision would have been easier if it hadn‚Äôt been made in darkness.

Darkness. That was it. That was what the decision was about.

Mo turned the letter over and over in her hands. Memories of the Keep overwhelmed her: the echo of ancient halls, cryptic incantations scrawled on stone walls, her parents‚Äô aloof silhouettes gliding through corridors. Insane parties and affairs. Control and manipulation. She‚Äôd left that world because it had felt oppressive, stifling.

Yet now, it reached for her again.

Mo clenched her jaw. She struck a match and brought it to the letter. The paper didn‚Äôt burn‚Äîit dissolved, black wax melting upward against gravity, the letter crumbling into motes that hung suspended in the air. In their place, silence spread like spilled ink, so complete Mo could hear her own heartbeat echoing off the walls. For three breaths, she dared to hope.

Then came the humming‚Äîa sound that vibrated in her molars before reaching her ears, like thunder trapped inside her skull. The potted fern by the window withered. Her phone died with a plaintive beep. The shadows peeled themselves from every corner, slithering across the ceiling and walls to converge in her living room‚Äînot darkness, but absence, a hungry void that bent the light around it.

A portal. The air crackled with ozone and possibility, that unmistakable metallic tang of raw magic that brought back memories of sneaking into her father‚Äôs study, of whispered incantations under moonless skies.

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù thought Mo. ‚ÄúThey know me too well. They knew how to trigger it.‚Äù

Mo‚Äôs breath came in rapid gulps as she crept toward the roiling darkness. The half-packed suitcase sat next to her feet; she grabbed it on instinct. There was no point in taking much‚Äîwhat use were clothes and toiletries in a place where spells reigned?

‚ÄúThis is a terrible idea,‚Äù she whispered. The swirling portal seemed to pulse in agreement, a silent heartbeat in the gloom.

Mo squeezed the handle of her suitcase. She heard a distant croak in the stillness‚Äîlike the raven was mocking her from without. Her throat tightened, and for an instant, she considered running. But where would she go? The Keep wouldn‚Äôt let her slip away, not if it had truly begun to seek for Mo‚Ä¶rgana. If it had started to attune itself to her.

Mo stood at the edge of normalcy, her carefully constructed life behind her, the shadows of her birthright ahead. The half-packed suitcase held pitifully little‚Äîa worn paperback, her favorite coffee mug, the ordinary talismans of a life she‚Äôd chosen. None of it belonged to where she was going.

‚ÄúJust one look,‚Äù she promised herself. ‚ÄúJust to make sure they‚Äôre really gone.‚Äù

Summoning every ounce of nerve she had left, Mo extended her hand. The portal‚Äôs surface felt cool and fluid, neither liquid nor gas, but something ancient that predated such distinctions. It swallowed her fingers, recognizing her blood, her magic‚Äîthe heritage she couldn‚Äôt escape. The darkness tugged at her with the familiarity of family, urging her to surrender.

She clutched the suitcase until her knuckles ached.

‚ÄúDamn it,‚Äù she muttered, closing her eyes. ‚ÄúDamn it all.‚Äù

Heart hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird, she stepped through.

The apartment vanished in a rush of disorienting cold. In its place came suffocating shadows and the faint echo of distant bells tolling. Mo was caught between worlds for one breathless instant, her body weightless, her mind spinning. A single thought thundered through her:

*I was right‚Äîthis is a terrible idea.*",2,1754641379.0,redditserials,2,1.0,False

1mkpk5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1mkpk5q/non_fiction_the_day_i_accidentally_met_my/,[Non Fiction] The day I accidentally met my childhood hero,"When I was a kid, I was obsessed with a certain TV show. I never missed a single episode, and I had posters all over my room. The main actor was my absolute hero ,  someone I thought I‚Äôd never get the chance to meet.

Fast forward about 15 years, and I‚Äôm waiting in line at a small coffee shop on a random Tuesday morning. A man walks in wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses, but I recognized his voice instantly when he ordered. My heart started racing because it was *him*.

I froze for a moment, not sure if I should say anything. In the end, I just smiled and told him how much his work meant to me growing up. He was surprisingly kind and even took a couple of minutes to chat before leaving with his coffee.

It was such a small moment, but it made my whole week. Funny how life throws these unexpected little gifts our way.",2,1754641099.0,story,0,1.0,False
1mkpjo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/storyandstyle/comments/1mkpjo0/she_waited_at_the_train_station_for_3_years_and/,She waited at the train station for 3 years ‚Äî and never knew why I stopped coming,"We met at a train station. I was late. She was early. I spilled coffee on her sketchpad, and she just laughed. That‚Äôs how it started ‚Äî every day after that, we met at the same bench before our trains went in opposite directions. Different lives, 20 minutes of overlap. Somehow, it became everything.

We never called it dating, but we stopped seeing anyone else. We didn‚Äôt need to. Those 20 minutes each morning became our little world. She brought me breakfast when I overslept. I brought her flowers on Tuesdays, because she once said Tuesdays felt like forgotten days. She hated goodbyes, so we never said them. Just ‚Äúsee you tomorrow.‚Äù

One day, I told her I loved her. She looked at me like she already knew, like she had been waiting for me to say it out loud. She whispered, ‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù That was the last day I saw her.

I was hit by a drunk driver that night. I was in a coma for nearly a year. When I woke up, my memory was patchy. Her name, her laugh ‚Äî gone. Doctors said it was normal. I didn‚Äôt feel normal.

It took me another year to remember her.

By the time I made it back to the station, she wasn‚Äôt there. I waited for a week. Then I found the older woman who sold flowers nearby. She remembered us. Said the girl with the sketchpad came every day at 8:20 for three years. Just in case.

And then, one day, she stopped coming too.

I never found her again.

Some days I tell myself she moved on. Other days I imagine her waiting just one more day. I carry a flower in my bag every Tuesday. Still hate goodbyes.

Just thought someone should hear our story, even if she never will.",3,1754641042.0,storyandstyle,0,1.0,False

- MORE TRAITOR & EVIL CHARACTER AUS!!

- MORE HOLOGRAM &/OR BAD ENDING UZI AUS

- More ‚Äúwhat if Doll was a ghost like in the end credits‚Äù AUS

- More time-travel AUS

- More coffee / flower shop AUS (imagine one with J x Tessa)

- Fantasy AUS

- What if Tessa stayed in her room like Cyn told her too?

- What if (Tessa, Mitchell, Yeva, Doll‚Äôs father, Rebecca) a previously dead character survived?
