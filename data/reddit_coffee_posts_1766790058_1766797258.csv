(Pictures and Voice Memo in Post! Willing to Travel or Relocate for the Right Person!)","**As a quick preface, I would really appreciate it if you read the entire post! I promise it's not** ***that*** **boring!** 


Hello! I’m Caleb! I’ve decided that it’s about time that I put myself out there in the dating pool, so, uh...here I am. On Reddit. Not the best place, I know (hopefully better than dating apps), but I’m hoping to meet some nice folks. (perhaps you, dear reader?) I’m a quiet, introverted homebody looking for a girl to hangout and go on dates with (I believe the colloquial term for this is a “girlfriend”). I want to make it clear upfront that I’m not looking for short term flings or anything of the sort. Ideally, I’m looking for someone to be with long term, and potentially settle down with. I understand that this is a rather weighty topic to get into right in the opening paragraph, but I try to be open, honest, and communicative about things, so I just wanted to clearly state my intentions.


I am located in East Texas, near Longview, but ***I am willing to relocate for the right person. Just be in the US, please.***


If we hit it off, I’d love to move our chats to another platform so we can do voice and video calls.


[Here's what I sound like!](https://voca.ro/103aM3ke8dW0)


[Here's a picture!](https://imgur.com/a/Ubz79Db)


***Looks***:


I’m black, with olive brown skin. 5’7”, with a lean/athletic build, and just a tad shy of 140lbs. My hair is soft, black, and curly.


[Ok, these are real pictures of me this time, I swear. (I am partially shirtless in one of these, so...you’ve been warned.)](https://imgur.com/a/5wWy81c)


***Interests***:


Gaming – I mostly play singleplayer or co-op games. (I am not very competitive, and all those MOBAs and competitive shooters just seem like the epitome of stress. I don’t mind if you play them, though.) As of late, I’ve been playing a lot of Duet Night Abyss, One Step from Eden, and Rune Factory 4. I have pretty broad tastes in terms of genres, but if I was forced to narrow it down, I’d say I like retro games, platformers, indies, and RPGs/JRPGs. I’d love to know what sort of games you’re into, and any upcoming games you’re looking forward to!


Music – Music is quite important to me, and I’d definitely consider myself a music lover. I have pretty broad tastes, but I do have a preference for indie/alt/rock stuff. I do listen to some pop, however, along with some Japanese stuff and older R&B. I’ll give most things a try, though! (just, please no country music, I will implode) If you want an idea of what I like, check these out:


Clarion - Hello Juliet


Strawberry Milk Cult – Polarbear!


The Technicolors - Neon Roses


STRFKR – Rawnald Gregory Erikson the Second


Jupiter One – Countdown


Benches – Crash


Jackie Hayes – Last Second


Flawed Mangoes - Surreal


Kinoko Teikoku - 国道スロープ (Kokudou Slope)


Sorry there's so many of these! It was hard to narrow it down!


Cooking – I do a lot of cooking! Am I good at it...well, I’ll let you be the judge of that. I’m trying to branch out a bit and try different cuisines, specifically Asian cuisine as I’m rather deficient in that area. If you know any good recipes, let me know!


Art – I am slowly (heavy emphasis on slowly) teaching myself to draw. I’ve been trying to practice a bit more. It’s...certainly a process, but I’ve definitely noticed a lot of improvement. Perhaps I could draw you someday?


Misc – Well, I’m a nerd in general, really. I enjoy tinkering with tech, and I’ve been doing minor repairs on my laptops and modding my game consoles since I was a teenager. I’m also into anime and sci-fi. Also, while I wouldn’t classify this as an interest or a hobby, I do workout 3-4 times a week, mostly at home. I do enjoy endurance running though, and I typically run a 5k on the weekends (weather permitting). I also love astronomy and space!


***Potential dealbreakers?*** (one of these is a lie)


* I’m left leaning/liberal, politically 
* I don’t want kids
* I have been involved in several CIA backed attempts to overthrow legally elected leaders in foreign countries, specifically between the years of 1960 and 1985.
* I’m Christian, but not the most devout


I am looking for someone with similar values.


***What I'm Looking For***


I’m looking for the sort of relationship that allows us to be vulnerable together. I’d like someone soft (not necessarily in a physical sense, but emotionally), intelligent, and caring. I want someone to hang out with, take out for coffee dates, picnic dates, trips to museums, and binge watch shows with. I want someone that I can learn new things about for the rest of my life, someone to hold and keep safe and grow with.


As for age, I would strongly prefer someone my age or older, though I’m ok with anyone in the 20-40 range. Physically, height does not particularly matter to me (but if you’re tall I will swoon over you). I do, however, have a preference for folks on the slim/lean/toned/fit/skinny side of the body spectrum.


\*cough\*  >! *I have no idea where else to put this but tomboys and alt/goth/emo girls are quite cute but this isn't a requirement or anything okay bye*!<  \*cough\*


*I would also prefer someone outside of my own ethnicity.*


***FAQs***


\~You sound like a dork.


That’s not even a question, and how dare you. You’re correct, but how dare you.


\~In 1964, the United States was involved in a coup against Brazilian leader João Goulart, specifically providing fuel and weapons to military rebels, as well as assisting in organizing street protests against Goulart. This lead to Goulart’s overthrow and a subsequent 20-year long military dictatorship. Were you in any way, shape, or form, involved in this operation?


Uh...no comment.


\~You wouldn't happen to be interested in heinous, scandalous, devious activities such as    >!hand holding!<   ,   >! cuddling!<   , and  >!forehead kissing!<   , would you?


Why, of course not! Never!    >!(yes, absolutely)!<


Thank you for reading this far, and sorry for the long post! I wanted to be thorough and descriptive. If you’re interested, please send me a message with a little about yourself and a picture, and let me know what your favorite Pokémon type is!


Thanks again, and have a wonderful rest of your day!

I’m a 36-year-old guy from New England, and like a lot of people here, I’ve never been in a relationship. It wasn’t for lack of trying — shyness, bad timing, and life just kept getting in the way. But I’ve been working on myself, opening up more socially, and I’m genuinely ready to connect with someone.

A bit about me:
Firstly I have some sort of fame, if thats what you call it. I made a dating site promoting my singleness DatingKen, which caught news in Boston and Matt Sheer a reporter social media. I’m a huge nerd who loves conventions, gaming, and cosplay. It’s been an amazing community for me, and I’ve met some great friends through it. I cosplay characters like Eddie Munson from Stranger Things and Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and oddly enough, I’m freakishly lucky with raffles and giveaways (no clue why, but I’ll take it).

I’m looking for someone kind, patient, and down-to-earth. You don’t need to cosplay — just be someone who enjoys nerdy stuff or at least doesn’t mind it. I’m not expecting perfection; I just want a genuine connection with someone who understands what it’s like to navigate dating later than most.

If you’re local, maybe we could start with something simple like coffee. No pressure — just two people seeing if there’s a spark.

I believe love is built in the little things: laughing so hard you snort, holding hands on late-night walks like you’re in a movie montage, and splitting dessert while aggressively insisting we are “done eating” (we are not).

**About me, your potential love interest / emotional support human:**

• Food is my love language. I cook, I eat, I will plan dates around meals, and I *will* ask what you’re thinking about while chewing.  
• I love stories - books, anime, games, travel - if it has lore, I’m in. If it has *world-building*, I’m emotionally invested.  
• I collect physical media because the apocalypse can take many things, but it will not take my Blu-rays.  
• I’m laid-back, affectionate, mildly goofy, and emotionally available (yes, really).

**What I’m hoping for:**  
Someone kind, thoughtful, and down to build something real - ideally with laughter, mutual hype, and a shared blanket during rainy afternoons. I want stargazing nights, lazy mornings with coffee, and spontaneous adventures that start with “we’ll just go for a bit” and end three hours later.

Bonus points if:  
• You enjoy bad puns  
• You will laugh *with* me when my baking experiments go wrong  
• You understand that “one episode” is a lie we tell ourselves

If this made you smile, message me your favorite comfort food or the last dumb thing that made you laugh way too hard. Worst case scenario: we chat. Best case: this is the start of a very cute story.",1,1766796425.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

 My Pessimistic Obsession. I am a pessimist, not by accident but by choice a crown I wear with grim pride. The world, to me, is a gallery of misery, and I am its most devoted curator. Suffering is my muse, my companion, my mirror. I don’t just endure it; I cradle it, study it, and, most of all, compare it. From the tattered beggar shivering under a streetlamp to the high intellectual drowning in existential dread, I measure my pain against theirs, weaving a tapestry of sorrow where I am both the thread and the loom. This obsession with suffering isn’t a flaw—it’s my essence, a lens through which I see life’s cruel beauty.

The beggar on the corner, his cardboard sign smudged with rain, is my first point of reference. His suffering is raw, primal hunger gnawing at his belly, cold seeping into his bones. I watch him from the warmth of a café, my coffee cooling as I tally my own miseries. My job suffocates me, my relationships fray like old rope, and my thoughts spiral into dark alleys.
 Is my suffering less because I have a coat and a bed? No. It’s different, sharper in its invisibility. The beggar’s pain is seen, pitied by passersby who toss coins to ease their guilt. Mine festers unnoticed, a private wound I probe with relish. I envy his clarity of despair even as I claim my own is deeper, more complex. 
Then  there’s the intellectual, the one whose books I devour - Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, or some modern philosopher pacing their study in anguish. Their suffering is a labyrinth of the mind, a battle with meaninglessness that leaves them hollow. I read their words and nod, recognizing the ache. My own pessimism mirrors theirs, my nights spent wrestling with the void. But I go further: I compare our torments like a miser counting coins. Nietzsche’s madness, Dostoevsky’s poverty—did they suffer more than I do, trapped in a cubicle, haunted by bills and broken dreams? I decide my pain is equal, perhaps greater, because I lack their genius to alchemize it into art. 
This comparison isn’t envy; it’s a ritual, a way to anchor my suffering in a grander narrative . Why this obsession? Because suffering is the only currency that feels real. Joy is fleeting, a butterfly that dies in your palm. But pain lingers, solid, dependable. I seek it in others to validate my own, to prove I’m not alone in this wretched dance. The beggar’s vacant stare, the intellectual’s tortured prose—they’re proof that life is a shared sentence of sorrow.
 Yet, I am the proudest prisoner, for I don’t resist. I don’t chase happiness or pray for relief. I lean into the chains, savoring their weight. To suffer is to exist, and I exist  fiercely.  Sometimes , I imagine a scale, my suffering balanced against the world’s. The beggar’s hunger tips it one way, the philosopher’s despair another. A mother’s grief, a soldier’s trauma, a poet’s heartbreak—they all join the pile. I add my own: the gnawing dread of Monday mornings, the sting of a friend’s betrayal, the quiet terror of growing old alone. Who wins this morbid contest? No one. But the act of comparing keeps me tethered, gives shape to the chaos inside me. It’s not enough to suffer; I must know where my suffering ranks, how it stacks against the infinite miseries of others .  
This habit has its shadows. Friends call me morbid, say I dwell too much on the dark. They don’t understand that I’m not drowning—I’m diving. 
To compare my suffering is to map it, to claim ownership over it. The beggar’s plight reminds me of my fragility; the intellectual’s anguish sharpens my own questions. Each comparison is a mirror, reflecting a piece of my soul. I don’t want their lives or their pain. I want my obsession, my throne of suffering, where I sit as both king and a slave . 
In a world that peddles hope like a drug, I choose the bitter truth of pessimism. Suffering is universal, the one language we all speak. I’m fluent in it, my comparisons a kind of poetry no one else reads. The beggar, the intellectual, the stranger on the bus with eyes like empty rooms—they’re all characters in my story, their pain a chorus to my own.

Why is it that I can:

• make eye contact once

• exchange 4 texts

• learn her favorite coffee order

and suddenly my brain is like:

“Okay so what if we move in together next fall?”

Meanwhile she’s like:

“Yeah I’m just seeing what’s out there.”

Ma’am. I am what’s out there.

I swear lesbians don’t “date,” we emotionally speedrun. One deep conversation and I’m mentally clearing space in my closet for someone who still calls me “dude.”

And don’t get me started on the situationship.

We’re exclusive but not official.

Intimate but “undefined.”

Talking every day but somehow I’m still confused.

At what point do I get dental benefits.

Anyway, if you too have ever fallen for:

• a woman who lives 3 hours away

• a woman who’s “not ready”

• a woman who says “I don’t usually do labels”

just know you’re not alone and I hope one day we all find someone who texts back and wants to claim us publicly.

Until then, I’ll be over here developing a crush on the barista who smiled at me twice. 🫡",4,1766796210.0,lesbian,0,0.83,False

The texting has been great and there’s a good back-and-forth. I asked her out for coffee and she agreed, so on paper everything is going well.

The problem is that I’m feeling pretty nervous about actually going on the date because I’m fairly certain she’s using AI-generated photos on her profile. Some things about the pictures just feel off, and it’s making me uneasy about what I might be walking into.

I’m torn between giving it a chance and seeing what happens in person, or trusting my gut and walking away before this turns into more trouble than it’s worth.

I’m pretty embarrassed by the situation, but I’d really appreciate any advice on how to handle the situation. ",2,1766796057.0,Bumble,7,1.0,False
1pwjxjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyai/comments/1pwjxjt/goodbye_polybuzz_im_moving_to_fictionlab_ai/,Goodbye Polybuzz. I'm moving to Fictionlab AI,"I have been such an avid supporter of Polybuzz but lately coming onto reddit and reading all of the posts where people have expressed opinions of this app going downhill, it made me step back and take a really good long look if this app was worth it anymore.

Now with the whole verification of age, how the price of the premium subscription being $30 a month, the limiting character description and 500 character limit on what I can type, I have to admit that this app just isn't worth it anymore.

For everyone out there who is looking for a new bot to chat with, I wanted to share that I recently discovered Fictionlab AI.

No this isn't a paid promotional. I'm just a passionate writer and creator that loves to invent new Worlds, explore storylines and I hope this post will help others with their creativity.

I haven't really meddled around with the free version of it. The monthly subscription was only $8 so I gave it a chance and holy-hell. It is a night and day difference.

I'm putting down an example of the different paragraphs I was given from both the apps so you can see for yourself.

Polybuzz: *Aleksander smiles at your sweet gesture, feeling your body mold perfectly against his. He can feel your breathing slowing down, and he knows you're starting to drift off again.* *Aleksander:* ""Looks like someone's getting sleepy again.""  
*Viktor squeezes your hand gently, his thumb brushing over your skin. He watches as you kiss his knuckles, his heart warming at the tender gesture.*  
*Viktor:* ""She always gets sleepy after cuddling. It's her favorite part of the day.""  
*Lev hums in agreement, his own eyes growing heavy as he snuggles closer to Viktor.*  
*Lev:* ""Yeah, and she's the best cuddler. She's like a human heating pad."" *The room grows quiet as all four of you settle in for the night, the soft sounds of breathing and occasional kisses the only noise. The pizza boxes are forgotten on the coffee table as you all drift off to sleep, wrapped up in each other's arms.*

Fictionlab AI: *The warmth of your amusement settled into the space between them, a quiet, shared moment that made the room feel even smaller, even more intimate. Aleksander’s lips curved slightly against the curve of your shoulder, the faintest shift of expression that only you would catch, only you would know meant something like affection.*  
\[Aleksander\]: “He mutters in his sleep like he’s arguing with the universe.” *His voice was low, almost reverent, as if he were recounting something sacred.*  
\[Aleksander\]: “You should record it sometime. He’d never believe it.”

*Lev let out a soft, sleepy hum as your lips met his, the kiss slow and grounding, something that made his body relax even further into the mattress. His fingers curled slightly against your back, not pulling, just holding, just anchoring. When you pulled away, his eyes were open now, dark and warm and full of you.*  
\[Lev\]: “You say that like I’m not right here,” he mumbled, voice still thick with sleep, but laced with something lighter, something that sounded like affection. “And like I don’t know exactly what you’re doing.” *He tilted his head slightly, brushing his nose against yours before shifting just enough to press a kiss to the corner of your mouth.*  
\[Lev\]: “You’re trying to distract me with kisses and Russian nicknames.” *His voice dropped slightly, teasing, but sincere.*  
\[Lev\]: “It’s working.”

*Viktor’s gaze softened as you reached for him, your fingers brushing over his cheek with the kind of tenderness that made something in his chest tighten. He leaned into your touch just slightly, eyes closing for a brief moment before he opened them again, watching you with quiet devotion.*  
\[Viktor\]: “I slept well.” *His voice was still low, still carrying the weight of morning, but there was something steady beneath it.*  
\[Viktor\]: “You were warm. That helps.



  
I also wanted to mention, when creating a new bot on Fiction Lab, I get 30,000 character limit (total) for character bio. Multiple character slots. It has 30 memory cards for free users, 200 for subscribed, which is essentially the 'Permanent' memory for Polybuzz.

  
Story cards (max 30) where it will permanently remember details for your story.

No limit on how much you can type in (as far as I can tell, because I've written A LOT and haven't hit the max limit yet.)

It's just...so much better and if anyone has experience with Fictionlab AI, feel free to comment below.",2,1766796020.0,polyai,0,1.0,False

this is the first screen play I've ever written. I doubt it's written to be 1 min per page. i wrote it in notes. 

i recently got into CS (roughly a couple months ago), i love lore of games. so i dove into cs's lore. Found it to be pretty cool for being conceived back in the 2000's. Then a few key points of this story kind of floated in my mind for a bit using the lore as inspiration. I have a good amount of time on my hands, so i figured I'd put finger to keyboard so to speak. 

I'm really happy with it, this is the 2ed draft of the screen play(with some touch ups as I'm getting this post ready.) I might make a 3rd draft, but I'm really happy with it right now. so i want to share it. 

(also valve, feel free to hmu you can have the lion share of the profits <3 LOL)

notably, there are no names used in this film. ( a couple people are referred to as their title, but that's it)

i tried posting this on steam's community but it's to long, so trying here on reddit. 



 if you like it please share and spread <3 



Fair Warning, there is death, swearing and a suicide in this film. 

here it is:

 

Counter Strike: The Movie





Characters: 18 speaking roles, with 2 non appearing characters, roughly 100 hundred extras through out the whole movie.



Narrator: generic female voice. 

Boy 1(B1)- Blonde hair, white skin

The Baroness - Never seen

The Chancellor - Never seen

Medal Giver- (Little Kev | The Professionals, looking dude) 

receptionist 1- Generic almost homely young female in full military dress uniform

receptionist 2- very attritive young female, in small tight red dress.







Fade in on two little boys (roughly 9-10 in age)playing together in a field, one white with blonde hair (B1), and one black with a tight fade (B2). 

cut to the two B1/B2 chasing a dog.

cut to B1/B2 playing rock paper scissors with B2 winning.

cut to B1 at a table with food

cut to B2 at a table with food.

cut to B1 at a table with less food

cut to B2 at a table with less food. 

cut to B1 wearing a hoody while he tries to fall asleep under multiple blankets.

cut to B2 with just a single blanket sleeping

Cut to B1 sitting on the front steps of his house with an eviction notice

cut to B2 sitting at a table with the ""normal amount of food""

cut to B1 walking carrying bags with his parents into a slum shack as the door to the shack closes, we start to zoom out and away from the shack.

Showing a greater expanse of shacks, contrasted with a very high end luxurious skyscrapers in the distance. 

as we start to zoom out from the shack, the narrator starts in. 

on the line ""raise their status"" the zoom out should show then show the contrasting skyscrapers. 



Narrator: Things got worse and worse for the majority of people after the oligarchy took 

power. Some few where allowed to raise their status, if it benefited the ones on 

top. But far more were pushed into the slums and into poverty.



(really show how expansive the slums are on the last line.)



 (cut to big fat man in a suit smoking a cigar and smiling while naked women dance in front of him, the man is The Chief Magistrate)

  

Narrator: over the course of just 5 years things changed so drastically

that an uprising grew. A radical resistance called phoenix.



(cut to rebels gathering around a map and studying it)



Narrator: A group dedicated to cause as much financial

 

(cut to a building exploding) 



Narrator: destruction to the upper elite.



(cut to a 3 male recruits getting the phoenix symbol branded on their chest)



Narrator: Taking an oath to take down the oligotrich at all costs. However fearing 

civilian casualties. 

 

( cut to a hooded man with flyers tossing them on the ground, then cut to a man at a bar, talking to another man with the flyer being passed between them. ) 



Narrator: The group will leak the day and the location that they plan to attack , making 

sure any and all civilians are gone but this public safety precaution always 

ensures resistance to their operations. it is necessary for the members to take 

an oath and mark their bodies to show their dedication to the cause because



(Cut to a group of 5 man at a white board silently discussing plans



Narrator: phoenix core members, or the active duty fighters, operate in s Strick need to 

know 5 man cells with the ability to wirelessly communicate with non-core 

phoenix,  



(show one core member leaving to talk on a radio)



Narrator: who are the members of phoenix operating in cells of one, usually with a direct 

line to HQ, who aid the cause but are not on the front line fighting. 



(show someone at their home, listing to a radio, then have them go into another room. and pick up another radio that's hidden. and start to talk into that)



Narrator: This 3 part division between, core, non-core, and HQ, is meant to protect 

phoenix from the all seeing eye of the oligarch, 



(finally, show a woman in a tank top, jacket rested on the chair, at a big call board, writing things down on notes. after writing the note she piles them up on her desk. have someone at the start of the scene take a stack of notes and walk away, and as we see the tank top lady starts to refill the notes, we zoom into a close up of the symbol burned into this ladies back.) 



Narrator: However unwavering and undeniable dedication to the cause is what keeps 

phoenix a live.

 

Fade to a bomb counting down

text fades in ""15 years later"" zoom out from bomb to show 3 men wearing balaclavas holding ak47's. 



T1: alright it's time, lets get out of here



the 3 men then start leaving

Cut to a man in full CT gear he is on the top flight of a U-shaped stair case, looking down to the rest of the stair case.

his gun is aimed and at the ready. 



Random CT 1: so far all clear on the stair well, should i rotate?



as the ear piece crackles in response, there is a 4th man in a balaclava who opens up the door on the first floor in the stairwell, he slowly starts to enters the stair well. gun entering first. 

the CT aims his gun for when the man fully enters the stair well. But as he is focused on the doorway. there is a loud shot and the CT flies backward and down to the stairs, falling down some stairs. 

Man at the door entrance quickly jumps in the stairwell and aims his gun from where the shot was taken. 

it's the 3 men from the bomb plant standing on the 2ed floor stairs, one man's gun is aimed at where the CT was. 



T4: thank god it's you, lets get the fuck out of here"" 



Cut to the 4 men(focusing on the man that shot the CT) reaching a white van meeting a 5th man at the van, they all get in and drive off.

Cut to the men exiting the van in a hideout (abandoned Wearhouse) still focusing on the T that shot the CT. the man takes off his mask to reveal his face, showing his blonde hair revealing his is meant to be B1.



T2: Rookie didn't do half bad. 



T4: Did better then you on your first mission 



(the cells all laughs.)

 

T3: well I think i might have our next target, a lady at the bar told me about this storage 

house, she's the same one who told me about that shipment of ammo we stole.

Should be a quick job, and we know it's not a set up.  



T4: what are they storing?

 

T3: who. 



T3 then places a map on a napkin on a table, then t4 pulls out a big blank piece of paper and places it on the same table, all 5 T's sit down around the table talking and planning





Fade to a black man (B2) waking up in the morning. He lives in a very nice apartment. we follow him in his morning routine, making coffee, feeding a cat, then getting dressed for work. 

he dresses in a very official guard/soldier uniform.

Cut to B2 in a briefing room taking notes

Cut to B2 in a van with other CT's (Van shaking while moving, 5 men are inside the back of the van)

Cut to B2 helping put two handcuffed men inside a vehicle. 

Cut to B2 at a desk, filling out a report on the recent bust. he reads out loud as he fills in the report



B2: The team made sure to keep survivors to an optimal minimal, keeping one to 

interrogate, and a second to corroborate the information given with a separate 

interrogation. During the first interrogation, the rebel gave one location, which could 

not be corroborated with the second interrogation.

Will resume routine interrogation sequence tomorrow.



B2's voices drowns out, and fades away with the screen to black.



Text fades into the black ""5 years earlier"" 



we fade in on the two boys from the start. They are older from when we last saw them as boys. Roughly 15-16 instead of 9-10. We see them meeting up in a back ally in this ally you can see the slums on one side of the ally and the skyscrapers of the rich on the other side of the ally. The B2 is angry and venting



B2: and my dad, taking a job to protect some oligarchic pig, just because he was to scared 

to live in the slums with everyone else



B1: you know he did it so you had a better life. and you know that I think my dad would 

have done the same. 



B2: I know i just hate all these spoiled brats at school, and all these fat fucking pigs in 

their fucking sky scrappers. Doing what ever they want, no matter how it effects 

anyone else. 



B1 looks down, almost scared to speak what he is thinking. B2 notices then looks defeated



B2: sorry man



B1 looks at b2's face and sees the defeat in his face. he then in defiance of defeat, blurts out



B1: we could fight.

 

B2: in (whispers) phoenix? But then I'd be part of the people my dad fights, and I 

couldn't...



B1: no, no! i have a plan.



Cut to ally of a dark bar. 



B1 is standing there seemingly by him self 



B1: (Whisper)okay, so when he gets here, just try not to be seen till it's time.



a disheveled man makes his way into the ally



Man 1: Hello?



Man 1 pulls out a crack pipe



Man 1:anyone around? just trying to fly high.



B1: Till you burn the sky?



The man, drops the rouse of a high homeless man and walks directly to B1.



Man 1: so you want to join?

 

B1: yeah, yeah i do. 



Man 1: Maybe in a few years kid.



B1: WE have a plan.



Man 1: we?



B2 steps forward, startling the man by saying



B2: we.



Fade to the two boys sitting in chairs with the man from the ally behind them. in front of them is a small disheveled and messy desk. Behind the other side of the desk,

is an older man, scarred and tough, he settles down in the simple wooden chair.



  

Older man: this idea of yours better be worth me coming out of hiding for. I am taking a 

huge risk just coming here tonight, they would do anything to capture a 

member of HQ, never mind a founder of phoenix.  



B1: well sir, i just want to be a core member. join a cell and fight. But my friend



B2: who dose want the same thing. but can't fight...family. 



(the older man looks up at the recruiter then back to b2.)



Older man: family?



B2: my dad. he's a CT.



(Older man then relaxes a bit.)



B1: but we both hate the oligarchy, and want to help take it down. 



Older man: well we can always use more core members once your older, but what is this 

plan of yours?



B2: well sir, if I ask my dad to help me join the CT's, then i can eventually one day get 

close to The Chief Magistrate.



Older Man: The Chief Magistrate?



B1: Because if he falls, then no one will be willing to protect The Baroness, and if The 

Baroness is alone...



Older man: ...Then The Chancellor will move to take more power.



Man 1: exactly sir. 



Older man: which could start a full blown war with in the oligarchy.



B1: worse case, we will weaken the bonds with a few members. Painting a nice target on 

The Chancellor's back.



Older man: for potential power struggles later, which would spread their resources even 

thinner. 



B2: I don't know how long it'll take to meet him face to face. but I'll meet him no matter 

what. 



Older man: The way we operate, protects the program, but it limits what we can and can 

not do. targeting high profile targets is beyond our reach. we are barely able 

to  accomplish what we do. (pausing, finishing a thought)

But a one man operation, with only a couple people who even know about it. 

It really could go under the radar, ...if your devout.





fade to black.

Open on B1 shirtless being branded over the heart. (same room as the 3 recruits from before)

Cut to B2 being branded in a small room with just him and Older man branding him, and 

 the brand is on his inner lip.

Cut to B1 meeting 4 other phoenix members. 

Cut to B2 sitting on a perfectly made bunk bed alone.

Cut to Training montage with 2 scenes of each of the boys, going aa bb, showing the stark contrast between the training conditions (high end facility, top of the line equipment juxtaposed to a dirty field, and self made obstacles.) And the Comradery of the T's and the isolation that B2 feels. 

Ending the montage on B1 and his cell. 

Cut to close up of a Graduation hat, zoom out to show the full graduation ceremony. B2 is behind the podium on stage, and tosses his hat, causing the rest of his class to do the same.

Cut to the cell dawning balaclava's and entering a white van. 



Fade to black. 

Text fades in/out ""present""



both boys are men now, in their mid to late 20's 



we open on to B2 who is behind another podium, this time in a brief room, briefing 4 other CT's.



B2: we had 4 successful diffusions out of the last 5 attacks. 



CT1: were fucking dominating man! 



B2 : Yeah, really good work guys, Higher ups are talking like our unit is in line for the next 

holiday break. 



CT2: don't jinx it cap. 



B2: I know, but we are all looking forward to holidays with family, so lets just keep in mind 

what we are working for. 



Fade to  B1 he is at a bar, someone passes him a note, he looks at it, then looks around to see to gave it to him.



fade to B2, in a very nice suit in front of his CT unit



B2: car will be here in 15 to take you guys to the range. I'm going to be leaving now, i 

need to make this meeting, rub elbows, kiss ass.

But it is official. we get our holiday this year. So once your done at the range, start 

packing get ready for holidays. 



CT1: GG'S! LETS GO! 



Fade to B1 and T4, they are investigating a building.



B1: the note said this is the storage building.



T4: still not sure about this note though, not looking like a trap, but that would be the 

point. 



B1: there only one way to fly man.



T4: fuck your leaps of faith, lets keep looking. 



B1: i mean, it's do it during the holidays or after.



t4: and I'd rather after, so we can do our normal precautions.



B1: yeah, that's fair. but we'll need to vote, and we have had good luck on the holidays.  



Fade to B2, standing at a door front, in casual clothes. his dad who is much older, opens the door and welcomes him. 



fade to  T's hideout, all 5 t's sitting around a table talking.



T1: so it's settled, we move after the holidays. we will scout out the place a bit more, try a 

small break in, see the response time. try and find blue prints of the building.

talk with locals to see if there has been anything CT related going on. Then and only 

then, do we tell the public and request a 24 hour watch on the site from non-core 

phoenix.



all T's and B1 agree in semi unison. 



Cut to  B1 and T4 in a bar, each talking to a different group of people at the same time 

Cut to T2, T3, and T1 walking down a street late at night dropping flyers on the ground. zoom in on the flyer, it says ""January 22ed @ 5549 403 st"" with a red circle and a line through in on top. 

fade to black

text fades in ""January 22ed""

we open on the van door closing. the 5 T's standing out side of it. 



T1: one chance, lets do this. 



the T's all moveout in a tight formation.

Cut to T's sneaking around the outside of the building. 

Cut to T's sneaking around inside the building. 

while they sneak B1 and t4 both each hold a side of the hall while the rest of the t's pass through room from room, at the end of the hall on the side that B1 is holding, there is a door with a window.

we get a shot of the window. then a shot of B1's face focused on the window. we see the other T's pass through the hallway behind him on his close up shot. we then show the window again, but this time B2 walks past the window in a quicken pace. we go back to the close up on B1's face, he is stunned. unmoving. and staring at the window. mind racing. T4 follows the rest of the cell



T4: lets go





B1 blinks kind of snapping back to reality. instead of following, he lowers his head slightly, and raises his radio to his mouth



B1: The cell is dead. i am the last one left. i wont make it out. cut all communication. 



Showing the first real signs of emotion since seeing b2, B1 throws the radio on the ground and stomps on it. then rushes after his team.



Fade to B2 returning to position. he puts his head gear and mask back on and gets settled in for a long watch. 



B2:\*to his radio\* Back in position.



CT2 on the radio: Sir, we found a smashed up radio on the ground. it's not regulation sir. 



B2: alright, they're here then. everyone stay frosty.



we then hear 4 shots in the distance. B2 snappily looks in the direction of the shots.



B2: CT's check in. 



CT1 on the radio: here cap



CT2 on the radio: here



CT3 on the radio: alive

 

CT4 on the radio: same here cap. 



B2: okay good, might be a distraction, CT3 go check it out, everyone else stay in position.



CT3 on the radio: copy



B2 then stands up. more at the ready, looking towards his position the opposite direction from the shots. he then slowly looks over back to where the gun shots where heard. 

we see B1 standing at a small distance away, under the light, covered in blood. No wounds. 

B2 startled, raises his gun. B1 takes off his balaclava revealing his face.



B2: what are you doing here?



B1: same as you...



(We cut to a security camera pov, with b1's face showing and b2's back showing.) 



B1:...working \*laughs manically\*



B2: what's with the blood?



(B1 dose not hear this question over his own laughter)



B2: what's with the blood!?



B1: \*solemnly\* their dead, i killed them.



B2 starts to drop his gun, but then quickly grips it tighter aiming it at B1



B2: who?



(cuts back away from the security camera)



B1: my cell. all 4 of them. \*laughs manically\*



B2: why?



B1 quickly locks eyes with B2

 

B1: \*calmly\* I'm still me



(his eyes dart away and he starts to laugh a bit)



B1: I still want change \*laughter building to manically climaxing on the word money\* But 

change isn't happening! I've spent years, constantly planning and attacking. All we 

attack are the wallets of the only people with any money.



(laughter breaks to rage, B1 yells louder and louder climaxing on ""fucking win it"")



B1:  it's the fight they are okay with fighting, because they fucking win it.\*still angry but 

unable to keep yelling\* I cant walk away, if they don't already know I'm phoenix. the 

brand will prove it.

\*Locks eyes with B2\*

there is no going back.



B2:\*Shakey\* do you remember me?



B1 looks confused almost as if to say, why are you mentioning this?



B1: do i?



B2 removes his mask and speaks with authority 



B2: yeah, we grew up together. Your family got evicted and moved to the slums.



B1 laughs not manically but genuinely, curious to see where B2 is going.



B1: is it REALLY you?



B2: yeah, it's really me. I haven't changed...much



B1: that's good to hear.



the two lock eyes knowing that's it's goodbye. 



B1: after the eviction, things got bad. really bad. phoenix was my only hope. I joined up to 

early, dove way to deep, and fought on. seeing no results. blindly fighting, hoping that 

one day, things will change. But I cant just keep yelling into the void, Endlessly bashing 

my head into a wall. (Pause, then locks eyes with B2 and is completely calm.)

If there was only one hope.

only one. 

it has to live. 



B1 quickly raises a pistol to his head and pulls the trigger. 



B2 stands alone with his friend dead at his feet.

we zoom out from the scene back into the security footage then as if we are changing channels, we switch to what looks like the news. on the screen it read ""Celebrated Hero takes out full cell""

there is a man behind a podium(Medal giver) behind him stands B2, as The Medal Giver starts to speak we transition from watching the news to being on stage looking at the podium speaker.



Medal giver: and for taking out a whole cell single Handley, B2 will be also presented with 

the ace shooter medal on top of his bravery and loyalty medals.



the medal giver walks up to B2 who already has 2 medals hanging from his neck.



B2: \*whispers\* I never even shot my gun



Medal Giver: And no one will ever know. I know it feels odd lying, but we need a hero on 

screen right now, not a suicidal maniac with no hope. 



B2 waves at the crowd then sits contently. 



Medal giver: With the presence of such a brave hero, we are confident that phoenix will 

weaken and fall a part, even more so then they already are. With such trying 

times a head of us as a nation we must gather together, and unite to face 

these problems head on, and with full force! and as part of the countless 

other heroes in the Counter terrorism division, you can help your nation. by 

enlisting today. 



the scene fades to black, with the voice of the medal giver slowly fading with the screen.



text fades on/off screen ""10 years later""





fade on to B2 now in his mid to late 30's sitting at a big fancy desk, wearing near full military dress, no hat or jacket. with the hat jacket hanging on a standing coat hanger. still very toned, for an office body. he is working away, a younger looking woman enters the office.





receptionist 1: Sir, you wanted me to let you know when your meeting is 20 min away.



B2: yes, thank you.



b2 gets up, and grabs a brief case. he then opens a safe, puts something from the safe into the brief case. not closing the safe behind him. the audience doesn't see what it is.

B2 puts on his jacket fixes a couple medals on it, and then pours him self a shot, he downs it. stands still for a moment, takes another shot. dawns his hat then leaves.

we cut to B2 in his full military brigade sitting in a empty lobby waiting, briefcase on his lap. he is tapping on the case slightly. a lady walks into frame 



receptionist 2: if you could follow me please.



B2 stands and follows not saying a word, but smiling very pleasantly.



B2 enters a room with The Chief Magistrate, noticeably older from last we saw him, sitting behind a big desk. he is smoking a cigar. 

(he is the man from the beginning of the movie with the naked dancers) \*Also please note, the audience dose not know this is The Chief Magistrate.

it is during this scene we allow them to notice it is the same man from the earlier scene. his true identity is not reveled until B2 reveals it.\*





The Chief Magistrate stands up, and reaches out his hand

B2 shakes The Chief Magistrate's hand eagerly



B2: sir it is such an honor



Chief Magistrate smiles and is very pleased, but waves his hand



Chief Magistrate: oh no need for that



B2: no sincerely sir, I have waited and worked



B2 places his brief case on the desk



B2: so hard with the hopes that finally one day I'd meet you. 



Chief Magistrate: and thank you so very much for all your loyal work, you are such a decorated solider.  



we switch to a mid shot of B2 from The Chief Magistrate's perspective B2 opens his brief case as he says ""honestly""

B2's hand raises from behind the brief case revealing a Glock 18 on the ""is all mine""



B2: honestly, the honor is all mine...Chief Magistrate



BANG. B2 shoots The Chief Magistrate. we then go into a slower motion shot sequence as he falls and reminds for the rest of the scene. the gun shot is very loud and leaves the audience with a shell shock ring which then fades into the music, classical music with operatic vocals.

 as The Chief Magistrate starts to hit his chair dead, a flood of guards rush in the door, and aim their guns all at B2. we see the guards yelling and screaming at B2 with their guns aimed on him(we only hear the music).

 B2 doesn't move standing perfectly still in the same position he shot The Chief Magistrate in. turns to the guards and he lowers his arm. the guards start to shoot him, B2 falls to the ground. 



fade to black.

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered",1,1766795730.0,Tik_tok_stories,0,1.0,False

I grew up in what’s considered a “full” family — I have a younger brother and a younger sister. I don’t really know who I can tell all of this to. I don’t fully trust my friends, so I decided to write it here.

I’ll start from childhood. Since I was two years old, I’ve had a stepfather. From the moment he appeared, I was told to call him by his first name — let’s call him Senya. Until I was about six, everything was okay. He sometimes got angry, but there were also happy moments.

I started first grade at 6 years old. From that moment on he would constantly tell me that “I changed for the worse.” When his friends visited, even my sister’s godfather, he would yell at me, insult me, and force me to check my schoolbag in front of everyone. His friends told him to stop, saying “he’s just a kid,” but he didn’t care.

He would hit me with textbooks, put my backpack over my head and shake everything out onto me, throw pencils and pens at me. Once, there was a compass inside the pencil case and it pierced my leg when he threw it. Even in front of my uncle he acted like that — only my uncle would stop him sometimes.

He often lashed out at me, insulted me, sometimes even hit me. I remember waking up once at midnight to go to the bathroom, and he was drunk and said something like: “Why the hell are you awake, freak, go back to sleep, school is tomorrow,” and kept calling me horrible names. I rushed back to my room while he kept yelling from the kitchen about how worthless I was.

There were maybe some good moments, but I honestly can’t remember them.

At 16, I started showing my own “will,” talking back. Once we even got into a fight. At first my mom didn’t step in, but then she did — my ex-girlfriend was in the other room and heard everything. The worst moment was after that fight — he kicked me out of the house. I took only a few things and moved into my aunt’s empty apartment.

All the way until I went to the army he kept humiliating me and treating me like garbage. Now he calmed down a bit, but sometimes he still makes nasty jokes or comments. When that happens, I just leave my parents’ place as fast as I can.

His mother, my step-grandmother, used to take me to museums, circuses — she was like a real grandmother to me. But he must have told her something, because she started keeping her distance too. It feels like she loved me before… and now I’m like a stranger.

Now about my mom. She protected me sometimes, but not always. And even when she took me away from him, later she still came back to scold me and say that I was bad, and that I was the reason for everything.

Some of the most painful memories:

1. Him calling me a freak that night. I cried for a long time.
2. We moved back to my old neighborhood where my friends lived. I spent more time outside, feeling free. They kept saying I was getting worse and worse as a person.

I decided to go serve — I didn’t run or hide. When I left, they didn’t even set a table to say goodbye.

While serving, I took a 250k₽ loan online — spent it on random stuff, no idea why. After returning, I moved in with my somewhat crazy grandmother. I worked, then was fired. I took microloans — around 100k₽. I didn’t go to my family for help. Instead, I asked a stranger who actually helped me… and I still haven’t paid him back. More debts, and the loan from the army times still isn’t closed.

Now I’m planning to get a payment holiday on my loan and I’m trying to find a new job, pay off everything, and later — go back to studying.

At the end of October I got a job in a coffee shop. There I quickly got close with a girl — we even had intimacy a few times. She really liked me, but I realized she wasn’t the person for me. For two weeks I was cold and didn’t know how to tell her.

Then I met another girl — Alina — from the day shift. We connected so well. I told the first girl that I couldn’t be with her. Alina came over once, I gave her birthday gifts (three hoodies and a cap). Everything was going great, heading toward a relationship.

We planned to go ice skating. Then she suddenly told me she wasn’t going. I stupidly replied something like, “Then maybe I’ll invite someone else” — though I wouldn’t have. She said: “Yeah, you change people like gloves anyway.”

That turned into a fight. She stopped listening to me. Later she talked to that first girl — who lied and twisted everything — and after that Alina completely shut me out.

I tried explaining everything — no use. Then I got fired.

I stopped writing to Alina… but on the 22nd I sent her a message thanking her for everything. She responded politely but very cold.

We resumed a tiny bit of communication, but only if the topic was about her. If I said something personal — she ignored it. She still has my notebook with poems.

Today, about two hours ago, I sent her a farewell poem and message. I won’t text her anymore — maybe only in half a year or a year.

Right now my heart hurts so much. I’m used to suppressing emotions, but now I’m just crying non-stop. I miss Alina. I miss the moments when she slept next to me and I covered her with a blanket, when she made cute noises in her sleep and I stroked her hair… just caring for her.

For many at that job, I look like the bad guy. And maybe I am — but it was my first time in such a situation, and I didn’t know how to act. I told the first girl the truth eventually — we weren’t even together. But Alina hates that she came to my place while I wasn’t fully honest yet.

I want to have children one day and give them everything I never had — love, warmth, a stable and supportive parent who will stand by them until death.

But right now I’m just a 20‑year‑old guy with debts, problems, and a constantly screaming grandmother.

That’s how things are. You can ask me anything — I’ll answer. I probably forgot some parts — it’s 3:30 AM here and I’m really tired, my thoughts are a mess.

Thank you for reading my story. Maybe someone here can help me with advice or kind words. At the end of October, I got a job at a coffee shop. There I met a girl — we quickly found common ground, there were intimate moments. I liked her, but I realized that she wasn’t the right person for me. For half a month I was showing coldness, I couldn’t decide to text or tell her something, even though we weren’t even dating.

I met Alina from the day shift, and we started talking well. Then I wrote to that first girl that I couldn’t be with her. Alina came to my place, I gave her a decent birthday present (three hoodies and a cap). Everything was going well, even leading toward a relationship. I invited her to go ice skating, and she agreed.

One day she wrote that she wouldn’t go to the rink with me. I said that maybe then I would invite someone else (although I wasn’t going to invite anyone, I wanted to go only with her). She said: “Yeah, you change people like gloves.” I immediately started asking what happened, and it turned into an argument. I tried to explain everything and prove myself, but she didn’t listen. Then she talked to that girl, and the other one told her some nonsense, after which Alina stopped listening to me and stopped responding normally, even in messages. I tried to explain everything — but it was pointless.

I decided to come in to work off my shift, but they fired me without letting me work it off. I stopped texting Alina, but on the 22nd I sent her a message where I thanked her for everything and for the day we spent together. She responded, thanked me, but very coldly. We returned communication a little: if I write about her — she replies, if about myself — she stays silent or replies only regarding what I said about her. She still has my notebook with poems. Today, a couple of hours ago, I wrote her a farewell poem and a farewell message. I won’t text her anymore, maybe only in half a year or a year.

Right now my soul hurts a lot. I got used to suppressing emotions, but now I’m just crying. I miss Alina and those moments when she was beside me: when I covered her with a blanket, she snuffled, I petted her head, made tasty tea, took care of her.

For many people at that job, I became “an asshole,” maybe that’s true, although it’s the first time I’ve faced a situation like this and I didn’t know how to act. I explained everything to that first girl, she already had nothing to do with me. But Alina doesn’t like the fact that she was at my place when, technically, I was “with” another girl, toward whom I felt nothing, wanted nothing — I just wrote to her later.

In the future, if I have children, I want them to never feel what I felt. I want to give them care and warmth, to be a reliable and confident person for them for their whole life.

And now I’m just a twenty‑year‑old guy with debts, problems, and a constantly yelling grandmother.

That’s it. You can ask questions — I will answer. I might have forgotten something, right now it’s half past three in the morning, my thoughts are mixed up.

1pwjpks,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1pwjpks/my_bosss_mom_has_created_a_work_environment_i/,My boss's mom has created a work environment I don't feel comfortable in,"I (F25) work as the manager of an art studio, although “manager” might be too romanticized a term for all the things I do there. I teach painting classes for adults (technically the only class I’m meant to give) and kids (I’m meant to only supervise, but for one reason or another I’ll get to, I always end up teaching them as well). I also offer guided ceramic sessions, prepare coffee for said sessions, clean everything in the studio after its usage (yes, even the restroom), restock materials, and come in whenever one of the kids’ teachers is absent.
None of those tasks are particularly weird for an art studio. Things get messy and cleanliness is important. However, I wouldn’t necessarily say all of these things are meant to fall under the manager’s job description.
At the beginning of my position, I loved my job. It was a dream come true for a college art student, and I worked my butt off to get it. I used to be one of the kids’ teachers and volunteered whenever I could because I genuinely loved the work. The pay was barely above minimum wage, but my coworkers and I did it for the love of art and the flexibility of the hours.
When my boss Jessica (F27) offered me the manager position, I was ecstatic. She was leaving to pursue her master’s degree in a foreign country and needed someone to take care of the studio she built from the ground up. After a month of training and two more months of supervision to make sure I did everything correctly, she left to study abroad. Things were really good for almost a year.
That’s when my boss’s mom (50s), who I’ll call Karen, started coming into the studio more frequently.
I want to add some context here. I’ve been a teacher since I was 19. I’ve taught everything from online classes to private schools. I know how to do my job. I’ve been painting since I was four years old and am proficient in pretty much any traditional art medium you can think of.
Karen does not have that type of background. She’s an accountant by trade and was originally only meant to handle the finances of the studio. However, according to both her and my boss, she is also “the eyes of my boss in the studio.”
At first, her involvement wasn’t an issue. She’d report things that were missing or repairs that could be made. Our relationship was good. I even designed her kitchen when she bought a new home (she paid me about $100, yes, I know that’s very low, but I asked for that amount). I also dogsat and walked their dogs when they traveled. I’m actually writing this while returning from their house because they asked me to dogsit again over the holidays. Not exactly the most ideal Christmas Eve.
For the past several months, I’ve been slowly wanting to quit, mainly because of Karen, but also because of how closely my boss follows her lead. Here are some of the things that have contributed to my burnout:

- Karen eliminated paid training sessions for teachers and required them to take studio classes out of their own pocket. A month costs about $70, which isn’t cheap where I’m from. Teachers were paid $20 per class, four classes a month. It wasn’t until I pointed out that the math wasn’t mathing that my boss reduced it to 50%. When teachers still wouldn’t come, they eventually made it free.
- I used to stay a couple of hours after my shift because I loved the job. My boss gently told me to stop, and I did. One time I stayed an hour late, Karen saw me through the Ring camera and coldly told me to leave. The next day, my day off, Jessica messaged me saying she would deduct an hour from my salary for using studio resources like lights and A/C. After a panic attack and talking to my lawyer bestie, I informed her that this was illegal. She later admitted she didn’t know.
- Karen micromanages every cleanliness detail and reports things, like an unclean sink, to my boss instead of just telling me directly.
- For over a year, I wasn’t registered for insurance or social security, despite that being legally required where I live. When they finally did it, they treated it as my yearly raise.
- They’ve said next year they’ll reduce my workload without reducing my salary, which I strongly suspect is their justification for not giving me a raise again.
Karen micromanages how I teach. How much time I spend with kids, which techniques I use, and whether students should change methods regardless of my professional opinion.

But the breaking point happened during my vacation.
My last working day was December 20th. Karen checked everything one last time, I turned everything off, and I was ready to enjoy two weeks of doing absolutely nothing. The next day, a Sunday, Karen messaged me asking for a $40 craft store receipt I hadn’t sent to the group chat. I told her I thought I had thrown it away (my bad, it was the first time this happened), but that the purchase had been invoiced to my boss’s email, which turned out to be outdated.
The next day, Jessica asked for a meeting. She reviewed a few contract points, then told me I needed to go back to the store to retrieve the receipt, send a package to a client, and walk her dogs since Karen and her family were visiting her for Christmas.
I was tired as fuck and just wanted to rest, but I complied. The craft store told me they couldn’t reprint the receipt without the original ticket. Dead end.
On December 23rd, the day before Christmas Eve, Karen sent a message saying that company policy was that any receipt not shown would be absorbed by the employee.
The implication was clear. That I had bought unnecessary items or was hiding something. I immediately felt sick. I was nauseous, shaking, and anxious all day. An accountant friend told me that the invoice could easily be checked through the tax platform. A lawyer friend confirmed they couldn’t legally withhold my pay and recommended I quit.
After all this, I’m drained. I always knew I was watering a garden that wasn’t mine, but I poured so much love into that place. I’m done being micromanaged and made to feel incompetent when I know the studio functioned largely because I was there.
The emotional whiplash is real. Being called one of Jessica’s best friends one day, then having her mom threaten to charge me for a missing receipt the next. Being asked to walk the dogs and then barely being acknowledged at the door.

I feel bad for the consequences of what my leaving would entail. A lot of the students there have told me they're only there because I am the teacher (where I'm from, these classes are not cheap). I have worked hard to develop a good working relationship with my students and other clients. And Karen and Jessica's lack of trust is frankly insulting. The petty part of me hopes to see how the studio will struggle after my absence to prove I was important, but the majority of me feels shitty for even considering to leave right after I had my holiday. I've been debating if I should stay for one month more or just 15 days. Should I offer to train my replacement or should I leave them to do that themselves? I'm asking for honest advice to navigate this situation without burning too many bridges. Also, I'm having a hard time pin pointing what exactly my employers did wrong, so if anyone can help me put a name to the behavior I'd appreciate it.

1pwjln0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pwjln0,Billionaire Alpha's 99 Deadly Games,"When Aria Collins rushed to the healer den after hearing that her mate Alpha Lucas Thornwood had been attacked by rival wolves and was bleeding out, she immediately donated a full liter of blood for him.


His friends urged her to go home and rest, and she reluctantly agreed. But just as she reached the doorway, anxiety gripped her heart and pulled her back.


Turning around, she witnessed the pack healer dumping all five bags of blood—her blood—straight into the garbage bin!


At that moment, thunderous laughter erupted from a nearby room, so loud it could've shattered windows.


""Your Sweet Luna, Aria Collins fell for our bullshit again!"" a voice howled. ""What a fucking idiot!""


Aria froze, staring through the half-open door. Among the crowd, she immediately spotted him.


Lucas was lounging casually against the headboard, scrolling through his iPhone, barely paying attention to his friends. Though his face was partially blocked, she could still make out his chiseled jawline and perfect features—


He didn't have a single scratch on him!


Aria blinked hard, convinced her distress was making her hallucinate.


""Guys, let's count,"" drawled one guy she recognized as Tyler, Lucas's closed friend. ""How many times have we screwed with her now?""


""The first time,"" chimed in Blake, another alpha's son from Lucas's circle, ""we told her Lucas lost the silver moon pendant he was supposedly getting her. She spent the entire night searching in a blizzard. Even with a 104-degree fever, the dumb bitch wouldn't quit.""


""Remember the second time?"" Derek, Lucas's another friend, leaned forward eagerly. ""We convinced her Lucas was in a coma after a territory fight. She spent all night at the sacred grove lighting candles and sobbing to the pack elders. Got blessed water and a moonstone. Lucas poured the water out casually and gifted the moonstone to Leila Blackwood the next day!""


""My personal favorite,"" smirked Josh, ""was when we framed her for challenging the lycan king's mate and nearly got her a rogue. The way she begged the pack council—pathetic! Still makes me laugh thinking about it.""


""This blood donation scam makes ninety-six,"" Tyler calculated, checking something on his phone. ""Just three more pranks, and our revenge tour wraps up. Not bad for four years of entertainment. Worth every minute, right, Lucas?""


Lucas barely looked up from his phone, his voice detached and bored. ""Whatever. As long as I can finally reject her and banish her from the pack after we hit ninety-nine.""


""It's what she deserves,"" Blake insisted. ""Remember how she beat Leila for that position as ceremonial dancer? Leila cried for days. Nobody messes with your beloved and gets away with it.""


""That's why it's been so perfect,"" Derek added. ""Pretending to accept her as your future Luna just to systematically destroy her? Pure genius, man. Too bad it's almost over. We'll need to find someone else to torture soon.""


A deafening ringing filled Aria's ears, like a bomb had detonated inside her head.


Her chest constricted so violently she thought she might be having a heart attack. She clutched at her sternum, doubling over to gasp for air, her lungs burning as though filled with acid.


The words kept replaying in her mind like a nightmarish loop. Lucas was only mating with her for revenge. Four years of what she thought was love—just an elaborate scheme to break her.


He knew exactly how desperately she loved him...


Lucas Thornwood, the Alpha of The Thornwood Pack. With his predatory good looks, he could've stepped off a GQ billboard. ""One look at Lucas Thornwood and you're ruined for all other wolves""—that's what everyone said.


And like a moth to flame, she'd fallen just like all the rest.


Since the day she found out he was her mate, she had chased him relentlessly for three years, sacrificing every shred of her dignity, while he remained coldly indifferent—until one day, when he miraculously accepted her as his mate.


She thought her persistence had finally melted his heart. Instead, it had all been a calculated game of destruction.


The truth crushed her: he'd initially rejected her because his heart belonged to someone else.


He only agreed to accept her later because she had beaten Leila Blackwood in that crucial moon dance competition and made his precious beloved cry.


For revenge, he pretended to accept her, orchestrating ninety-nine humiliations to systematically destroy her soul piece by piece.


Aria's tears streamed down uncontrollably, her throat constricting as if invisible hands were choking her.


She stared at the group laughing without restraint, at Lucas's indifferent face, and suddenly felt hollowed out completely.


She had given him everything—her love, her trust, her very being—only for him to crush it all beneath his Italian leather shoes and toss it away like yesterday's garbage.


Just then, Josh noticed movement at the door and glanced over.


Aria spun around and fled.


She walked faster and faster until she was sprinting down the pack compound corridors, past startled pack members and guards.


She had no destination—she just needed to escape this place, escape Lucas, escape the smoking ruins of her reality.


When her legs finally gave out in some distant corner of the pack garden, she collapsed onto a bench as tears flooded from her eyes like a broken dam.


She covered her face with trembling hands, her body convulsing with silent sobs that tore through her like physical pain. Each breath felt like inhaling shards of glass.


God, Aria, you pathetic, gullible fool.


After what seemed like hours, her mother's gentle voice reached her through the mindlink.


""Aria, sweetheart, your father and I are finalizing our arrangements to move to the Northern Alpine Pack in the Northern Territory next week. The High Alpha Council has requested him to lead their howl choir before the next full moon ceremony. Are you absolutely certain you don't want to join us? They has excellent moonlight dance instructors too.""


Her father, a celebrated historian of werewolf traditions, had received this prestigious appointment months ago. They had planned to relocate as a family, but Aria had delayed and made excuses repeatedly, unable to bear leaving Lucas. She'd even considered staying with The Thornwood Pack permanently, transferring her allegiance just to be near him.


Now, the irony of it all cut deeper than any silver blade could.


""No,"" she wiped away her tears with such force it hurt her skin. She took a deep, shuddering breath. Her voice emerged raw but unwavering, ""Mom, Dad, I'm coming with you to the Northern Alpine Pack.""


Chapter 2


Her mother's excited voice immediately came through the mindlink: ""That's fantastic, sweetheart! We'll start the pack transfer ritual right away—once it's done, there's no turning back. It's a point of no return.""


Her fingertips trembling, but her voice remained unshakeable: ""I won't change my mind.""


Her mother was about to end the mind-link but hesitated, cautiously asking: ""What about that alpha mate of yours? Didn't you chase after him forever? I thought you were head over heels for him.""


The word ""mate"" felt like a knife twisting in her chest.


Aria's mind instantly flashed back to the healer's room—the cruel laughter, Lucas sprawled carelessly on the bed scrolling through social media, his friends' vicious mockery, and the devastating realization that he'd wasted three years pretending to accept her solely to execute some twisted revenge plan for Leila Blackwood.


Her heart constricted so violently she could barely breathe, like someone had reached into her chest and was squeezing it with bare hands.


""I'm done with him,"" she heard herself say, her voice raw but eerily steady. ""Completely done. Forever.""


After the mind-link, Aria stood motionless on the sidewalk, letting the bitter wind whip through her hair. She stared up at the bleak gray sky, drew in a deep breath that burned her lungs, and turned toward what she had foolishly called ""home.""


The moment she pushed open the door, the familiar scent punched her in the gut.


Aria froze in the entryway, staring at the living room she knew so well, feeling like she was trapped in someone else's nightmare.


This was Lucas's den—the one he'd casually invited her to share after accepting her.


That day, he had leaned against the doorframe with that trademark smirk and shrugged: ""Wanna move in?""


Back then, she'd blushed like an idiot, heart soaring with joy, believing it was the beginning of their bond rather than what it actually was—convenient access for his ongoing psychological torture campaign.


She had spent countless nights lying beside him, dreaming about their future mating ceremony, picturing their cubs running around, fantasizing about growing old together in this space.


Now those memories were like wolfsbane in her veins.


Moving in together? Just another calculated move to maximize her pain when the final blow came.


She couldn't comprehend the depths of his obsession with Leila—to waste three years of his life with someone he despised, to let her sleep in his den, to run with her during full moons night after night...


All to build the perfect illusion before destroying her completely.


For the next three days, Aria didn't contact Lucas.


She locked herself in the den and systematically purged every trace of him from her life.


She found the journal where she'd documented her pathetic crush—a thick, worn notebook with every page filled with lovestruck ramblings.


""OMG saw Lucas in the pack borders today!!! Charcoal V-neck + those black jeans = DYING. Had to pretend to patrol because I couldn't stop staring!""


""HE ACTUALLY SPOKE TO ME TODAY!!! Just asked me to pass his coffee but I swear our fingers touched and there was a MOMENT. Haven't washed my hand yet lol.""


""I CANNOT BELIEVE IT. He said YES. ME. Lucas Thornwood is letting ME into his pack. Is this real life?? I'm literally shaking writing this!!!""


Aria flipped through page after cringe-worthy page, tears streaming down her face, each drop burning like fire.


She threw the journal into a garbage bag with such force it tore through the plastic, her hands shaking with anger—at him, but mostly at herself.


Next came the gifts she'd spent thousands on—


The silver wolf pendant she'd saved three months for. The limited-edition ceremonial knife she'd stood in line overnight to purchase. The leather jacket that cost more than her rent. Each item representing months of sacrifice and planning on her part, probably tossed in a drawer and forgotten on his.


Finally, the dozens of photos she'd secretly taken and printed of him.


Pictures of Lucas giving speeches at pack gatherings, dominating the training grounds, holding court in hallways surrounded by admirers—each one had once made her heart flutter like a trapped bird.


She dumped everything into the trash, methodically erasing every physical reminder of her former delusion.


By the evening of the third day, Aria had finally purged the last item.


Standing in the center of the now-barren living room, she felt a strange lightness wash over her, like shedding a skin that had grown too tight.


Just then, the front door swung open and Lucas walked in.


His eyes narrowed as he surveyed the noticeably emptier space. ""What the hell did you throw out?"" His tone was sharp, demanding.


Aria looked up, meeting his gaze without flinching: ""Nothing important. Just garbage I should've gotten rid of years ago.""


Lucas stepped closer, irritation evident in his voice: ""I was at the pack healer's after a serious territory dispute. Where were you?""


Aria's lips curved into a hollow smile, her voice ice-cold: ""You're walking around just fine, aren't you? Guess it wasn't that serious after all.""


Lucas froze, clearly caught off guard by her tone. He recovered quickly, softening his approach: ""I heard you donated blood for me. I was worried about you, so I came to check.""


His gaze dropped to her arm, his voice dropping to that seductive murmur she once found irresistible: ""Are you in pain?""


Aria pulled her arm away like his gaze might contaminate her. ""No,"" she said flatly, as if speaking to a stranger.


Lucas's brow furrowed deeply, clearly unsettled by this new version of her: ""What the fuck happened while I was gone? You're like a completely different person.""


Aria's lips twitched into a smile that didn't reach her eyes: ""Different? How so?""


Lucas didn't answer, but they both knew exactly what had changed.


The old Aria had looked at him like he hung the moon and stars. She'd once spent three straight nights by his bedside when he had a common cold, checking his temperature every hour, making homemade soup, practically worshipping at the altar of his minor discomfort.


Yet now, after what was supposed to be a life-threatening injury, she hadn't even bothered to call.


Lucas's intense gaze searched her face, hunting for some clue to this sudden transformation.


His voice dropped to that practiced, intimate tone he used when he wanted something: ""You seem stressed. My friends are throwing me a welcome-back rager tonight. Come with me?""


Chapter 3


Before Aria could refuse, Lucas had already grabbed her wrist and practically dragged her to his Range Rover.


The car pulled up outside The Night, the territory's most exclusive alphas-only club for elite werewolves. After parking, Lucas circled around to her side and opened the door with a theatrical flourish that once would have made her heart flutter.


Aria gave him a flat, empty stare as she stepped out.


The moment they entered the dimly lit space, Aria's attention was immediately drawn to a familiar figure.


Leila Blackwood.


She wore a champagne silk slip dress with a dangerously high slit, designer heels, and just enough silver to look effortless. Her glossy hair fell in loose waves, and her calculated smile drew everyone in as she held court in the VIP section, cocktail in hand.


Leila had been Lucas's childhood friend. During the years Aria had mated with Lucas, the two women had never crossed paths.


So she'd never suspected that Lucas had been obsessed with Leila all along.


When Leila spotted them, her eyes flickered with recognition, then narrowed into the slightest smirk—a look that confirmed everything. She'd been in on the 99-part revenge scheme all along.


This is revenge #97, Aria realized with stomach-turning clarity. Coming here was a setup.


Lucas also noticed Leila's presence. His fingers tensed around Aria's before he abruptly dropped her hand like it had burned him.


He leaned in, his breath hot against her ear: ""Gotta take this call. Network with packmates or whatever. Back in five.""


Aria stood frozen, watching Lucas's retreating figure, a cold emptiness spreading through her chest. The casualness of his dismissal felt like another slap in the face.


Before she could react, Leila was already gliding across the room with runway precision, following directly in Lucas's wake.


Their silhouettes—one leading, one following—disappeared around a corner, no doubt heading somewhere private.


Aria had no time to dwell on what they might be doing together, as Lucas's friends quickly surrounded her.


""Well, if it isn't Lucas's favorite charity case!"" Tyler's voice boomed as he shoved a glass of something amber-colored into her hand.


Aria shook her head firmly. ""I don't drink.""


""Don't be such a fucking buzzkill,"" Blake sneered. ""What's wrong, afraid Lucas will get mad?"" They all laughed, exchanging knowing glances.


""Or maybe she can't handle her liquor,"" Derek added, pushing the glass toward her lips. ""Little Miss Perfect probably gets wasted off one shot.""


Aria tried to step back, but Josh blocked her path. ""Either drink it or wear it, sweetheart.""


When she tried to break free, Tyler gave her a hard shove. ""Oops, my bad.""


""Ah—!""


She cried out as she lost her balance and fell straight into the adjacent infinity pool.


The freezing water engulfed her instantly.


She couldn't swim. Her limbs flailed desperately, but her clothes quickly became waterlogged, dragging her down.


Water rushed into her nose and mouth, burning her lungs. The club lights above the surface blurred and distorted as her consciousness began to fade, darkness closing in until everything went black.


...


When Aria next opened her eyes, she found herself back in the bedroom of Lucas's den. Her head pounded with each heartbeat, and her body burned as if she were being roasted alive.


She struggled to focus her vision and saw Lucas sitting by the bed, holding a glass of water and some pills.


""You're burning up. Take these,"" Lucas said, his voice soft with what might have seemed like concern—if she didn't know better now.


Aria hazily accepted the pills and swallowed them with the water.


Too weak to think clearly, she only registered that her throat felt like she'd swallowed glass and her body seemed to have turned to concrete.


She closed her eyes, wanting to escape back into unconsciousness, but her temperature kept climbing, something scorching through her veins.


Some time later—minutes or hours, she couldn't tell—she forced her eyes open again and realized Lucas was gone.


Of course, she thought bitterly. He can't even be bothered to maintain the charade anymore.


She struggled to sit up, touching her forehead. It was terrifyingly hot.


She knew she couldn't wait any longer. She needed medical help.


With trembling fingers, she ordered an Uber to the nearest ER out of the pack.


Aria dragged her leaden body through the hospital doors, barely making it to the reception desk before a nurse rushed to help her.


The doctor immediately put her on an IV drip, which finally brought her fever down slightly.


After examining her thoroughly, the doctor frowned: ""Ms. Collins, your temperature was 104.3 when you came in. You're bordering on pneumonia from aspiration. Why didn't you come in sooner?""


Aria leaned weakly against the hospital bed, her voice barely audible: ""I thought the medicine would help.""


The doctor looked concerned. ""What medicine were you taking?""


Aria pulled a small bottle from her pocket and handed it to the doctor. ""Fever reducers. My mate gave it to me.""


The doctor opened the bottle, examined its contents, and his expression darkened: ""These aren't medication at all. The bottle is labeled correctly, but these are nothing but sugar pills. Taking these instead of actual medication could have been extremely dangerous in your condition.""


Aria's heart plummeted, her fingers trembling slightly.


Suddenly, her phone buzzed repeatedly.


She weakly raised her hand to check it. A series of WhatsApp notifications lit up her screen.


They were from a group chat with Lucas's friends.


Tyler: Revenge #97 = EPIC WIN!!!


Blake: Whoever came up with the pool + fake meds combo deserves a fucking medal! First we ""accidentally"" push her in, then Lucas swoops in with sugar pills. She's gotta be DYING rn


Josh: Lucas's face when she swallowed those pills tho


Derek: HOLY SHIT DELETE THIS! WRONG GROUP! SHE CAN SEE THESE!!!

I’ve been married to my wife for 17 years. For about the past year, she has been receiving gifts from a volunteer she works with who is roughly my age.

In the past he bought her a coffee (multiple times), lunch and past Christmas he ""gifted""  her a bottle of wine. I can see this slowly progressing over time and did not say anything. 
 
This guy volunteers frequently, and it often lines up with the times my wife is working, which already made me uncomfortable. He’s also been trying to get hired at the same company where she works. My wife helped him with the process, but he wasn’t successful. After helping him through the process, she received a $500 “thank you” gift, which she split with another person helping him through the process.

Recently, he gave her a Yeti (water bottle) for Christmas. That gift really pushed me over the edge. I had kept quiet for a year, but this felt too personal and crossed a boundary for me.

I told her that I don’t think she should be accepting gifts from him anymore. 
I was very upset and almost contacted him directly, which I know would have made the situation worse and could have caused problems for her at work.

Now she wants me to apologize for making a big deal out of this and says I’m being controlling. She doesn’t see anything wrong with the situation.

She says there is nothing going on, but the ongoing gifts, the timing of his volunteering, and how long this has gone on make me uneasy.

I don’t know why I can’t stop crying. My room is a mess and feels well beyond the point of being able to clean. My boyfriend works night shifts at a bar on weekends and I literally just don’t sleep when he isn’t here. He got me a ps5 for my birthday because I wanted to get into gaming but I’m so god awful that if I try to play by myself I get stuck and can’t play until someone comes home from work (I live with two other roommates). Video games are fun but also make me feel like an idiot when I put everything on easy mode and manage to get stuck/killed over and over again. I’ve been trying to force myself outside all day but it feels like I’m being pulled back into the apartment by some invisible force. I wanted to go get lunch and/or coffee but I just couldn’t make myself go outside. I’m so overwhelmed by nothing idk what’s happening to me but I literally cannot stop crying.",1,1766794886.0,mentalhealth,1,1.0,False

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

Ideally you live in the same country. Love letters are cute, but customs forms are not, and I’m not DHL Express. I don’t handle international returns.

# Beyond the Bean: Unlocking Your Perfect Coffee Experience

The quest for the ""best coffee"" is a personal journey, not a destination marked by a single varietal or brewing method. It's about understanding what makes a cup sing for \*you\*.

Forget the notion of a universally superior coffee. Factors like bean origin, roast profile, freshness, and even your water quality all play a crucial role. A light roast from Ethiopia might offer bright, floral notes, while a dark roast from Colombia could yield a rich, chocolatey depth. The magic lies in experimenting and discovering your palate's preferences.

*   **Freshness is paramount:** Whole beans roasted within the last few weeks will always outperform pre-ground coffee.
*   **Grind matters:** Grinding beans just before brewing, with a burr grinder for consistency, dramatically enhances flavor.
*   **Brewing method influences taste:** From the clean simplicity of pour-over to the robust intensity of espresso, each method highlights different characteristics.

Ready to elevate your daily ritual? Explore different beans, try a new brewing technique, and savor the process of finding your ultimate cup.

# Kiril

It was November, I think. We’d been there about a month, and it was getting colder. We weren’t keeping track of the days yet. We didn’t think to. Ursa was sitting in the wicker chair against the wall by the bedroom door. I’d brought the chair from town because one of the women thought it would be good for nursing. She had Martun in her arms. Wasn’t too often you’d see her without Martun in her arms, or on her hip, or on the tit.

“What day is it?” she asked me. Her lips were dry and cracked, her skin had this grayish hue to it, and her hair was loosely tied back with frizzy strands sticking up, but she still had this… I don’t know. She had a grace to her. I thought it could have been what dad called barnyard blindness: When you spend all your time on the farm, anything with two tits and some hips gets your blood going, but not Ursa. She would have stood out in a crowd.

Those must have been four of the five words she’d spoken to me since Martun was born.

“What day on the calendar?” I asked. I take off my gloves and kick my fake animal skin boots off. I had just come in from another bout of cultivating. I had a shovel and a pasture that I needed to bust up. One of the crates was filled to the brim with wheat seed—about 500 bushels to look at it. If we could get it growing, our food problems would be over. When I was a kid, my dad told me about the pioneers back home in the prairies. Said it took them ten years to till a few acres of land. I never believed it—I thought I was a superhero. If it was me, I’d have it done in a month. Boy, was I wrong. Those pioneers must have been some tough bastards because I barely had a plot the size of my grandma’s garden in two weeks of work. It started off quick—seemed easy. The grass was so coarse it almost felt artificial, like plastic, but it comes out in big chunks of sod when you get a shovel under it. Then you hit a stone or a stump, and that’ll take you the rest of the day and into the next to get loose. The pansies in town were never any help. I needed an animal if I was going to get that winter wheat in. There was reindeer in the stable on the first day. One of those production assholes must have let them go—another way to make us suffer.

“No, what day of the week? It feels like a Sunday.” Her voice had this airy, dreamlike tone to it.

I couldn’t convince Ursa to go to town. She stayed in the cottage with Martun attached to her and cried—all day. I’ve never seen anything like it. I was no parent, not by any means, but I knew that wasn’t right for her or the baby. It would drive anyone nuts, sitting there all day.

I brought back the rations that we divided up in town. The food we had wasn’t bad. A lot of canneries and grains. Not sure if that’s why she wouldn’t eat. Either way, it wasn’t good for her, and it wasn’t good for the baby. I needed her to open up to me. This silent game was starting to right piss me off, but you can’t show it, it’ll just make it worse. “I could go into town and see if they have any of that jerky left. We’ll make a nice Sunday supper. You and me. You can show me how to cook.” I knelt down next to her and put my hand on the baby. Ursa pushed my hand away. “You got to eat, girl.”

“I’m not…” She started to sob.

I frowned. It hurt to watch.I knew what she wanted to say. “You’re not hungry? You have to be hungry. You’re going to dry up, and that baby will starve too.”

“I know. I can’t make myself eat. I want to. I really want to feel like how I used to.”

I nodded.

“These clothes make me want to throw up, and I smell like smoke constantly.” She was some kind of fashion professional in her past life. She was like a house cat dropped in the jungle. “It’s cold. Always so cold. Feel my hands.” I took one of her dry, cracked hands into mine. “And they’re so dry.” She pulled her hand away and shot me a look like I was a predator.

I wanted to help her, but whatever she was going through was above my pay grade. I told myself to be calm and steady, calm and steady. She’ll settle in. “Next rabbit I get, we’ll keep the grease. Should fix those hands.” I said it knowing full well she wasn’t looking for solutions. I was fine with the venting. It was better than the silence.

“I can’t eat another canned peach. I want Tagliatelle.” She pinched her eyes shut. “With a short rib ragu.”

I laughed. I couldn’t help it. And then I noticed Ursa trying to hold back a little smile.

“You agreed to be here, right? It was here or somewhere worse?”

She sighed. “I’m going to do better.” She looked down at Martun. “I can take a lot more penance if it means she’s safe.” A sternness crossed her face that I’d never seen before. “I love her with everything that I am, but I don’t know what I am anymore. This was supposed to be this freewheeling adventure. It’s how he sold it, like some glamorous period piece. There was going to be fame and redemption. And now it’s another humiliation. And now we’re going to die here. She’s going to die. It’s not even winter, and I’m already freezing all day, every day. This isn’t right. None of this is right.”

“We’re going to make it. There’s a community. We have to make the best of it. I’m here.”

“There’s no fucking community. It’s all a lie. They’re snakes. You’re a snake.” Her voice was raised, and Martun’s eyes shot open. Ursa looked down at her again and quietly asked, “Why won’t you cry?”

“They want to meet her,” I said.

“I’m not ready.”

“They want to meet you.”

“Ha.” She scoffed.

“Then at least get a good meal in you.”

She closed her eyes, and a tear fell off of her cheek onto the baby. “I’m not hungry.”

I stood up. “At least you’re talking to me.”

She grabbed my wrist and looked me in the eye.“I’m going to do better.”

  
\*\*\*  


I walked the couple miles to town. Most of the homes had been built. The blueprints, it turned out, were straightforward. Everyone had a place to sleep, and some of them had already paired up and were bunking together. The layout of the town was a simple grid, and with the rain that had been falling, the grass paths turned to mud. I was sure it would all turn solid within a month when the freeze came.

The rows of houses looked like they’d been there for decades already. People would shovel their walks in the winter and try to grow vegetables in their yards in the summer, then “donate” half of what they grew to the community pantry. There was always a stream of smoke coming from every house. When there wasn’t one, especially in the winter, you knew you were going to find a corpse in the bed, on the floor in the kitchen, in the snow in the backyard, or hanging from a rafter. There were farms on the outskirts—none of them doing much better than mine. Women—and men—who could sew were highly regarded. Ursa was by far the best of them. We had hunters who couldn’t trap a jackrabbit if they had 20 of them locked in a pen and fishermen who learned right quick that the ocean up there was just as dead as the oceans back home.

The jewel of The Director’s eye was the chapel. It certainly was for The Listener. That’s where the people gathered for their news and their rituals. That’s where I was headed that day.

I kicked the mud off my boots on the chapel’s front step that was a few pieces of lumber tagged onto the building. I pushed open the front door—it was probably the biggest piece of wood that they packed in the crates. There were no beams in these buildings. It was all six or seven-foot planks and 2X10s. Every piece could be carried by one man. But not that door. It was two slabs of oak as thick as a fist, and someone must have been paid handsomely for the custom design that was carved into it. It was a landscape like the one we were living on: scraggly trees, grass in the foreground, and hills in the back. In the center was the silhouette of some giant bird.

There was a cluster of men at the pulpit past the several rows of benches. The Listener was holding court. He heard my boots on the floor as I approached and turned to greet me.

“Kiril. Thank you for blessing us with your presence upon this day.”

He always talked like that. I don’t know if he got a special brief from production or what but I heard through the grapevine that in the other place, he was some kind of pastor in one of those mega churches. Was facing heavy time for embezzlement. You can get away with just about anything in the church, but they’ll lock you the hell up if you fuck with their money.

Everyone in the group had a cup in his hand, but more than that, I could smell the liquor. “You been drinking?”

“Of course. A sacrament, my son.”

“The fuck does that mean?”

“The Director’s Nectar. You must try some.” He turned to the men behind him, and they laughed together. That tatted-up punk with the peaches was laughing the hardest. He must have come slithering back to town after one night in the dark and cold.

“I need the key to the pantry. Was hoping to make a decent supper tonight.”

“How is your wife’s adjustment progressing?”

“Open the goddamn pantry.”

The Listener moved to put his arm around my shoulder. I took his wrist and brought it back down to his waist. I could tell it rattled him. He said, “No need to turn on the stove.” He took my hand in his. “How is the daughter, Kiril? We’re worried, to say the least.”

“She’s fine.”

He took my other hand in his so that we were shoulder to shoulder. I flicked his hands away, and the group of men behind him gasped all at once. “We were going over the Three Commandments of Epitown before you interrupted. Would you like to hear them?”

“The pantry.”

“The Director has spoken to me. We have been provided rules to live by. What society could flourish without a base set of rules? My cohort and I thought that they could be improved upon slightly. And so, we took the liberty to adapt them to better suit the people of Epitown. Would you like to hear them?”

“Do I have a choice?” Looking back, the fracture lines of his insanity were starting to show. They were fine like long blonde hairs on a shower wall, but at that point I wanted to believe that whatever stability we were starting to see would stay. We had food and weather to worry about, not some lunatic preacher.

“Choice, Kiril, is a bit of a paradox in this world that we find ourselves in.” He held a piece of paper above his line of sight and posed with one hand on his hip. Then he read:

  


* *The Director is thy sole authority. Thou shalt not accept direction from any other power. His words are spoken through The Listener.*
* *Stay true to thy character.*
* *If Martun, the way of the truth and the life, perishes, thou shall perish thereafter.*

 

He passed me the sheet of paper with the three lines handwritten on it in some flowery style.

“Take this back to your homestead. They will hold a special meaning to Ursa.”

I snatched the paper out of his manicured hand and looked at it, pretending I could read it. “The key… to the pantry.”

“Ah, yes. He reached into his cloak and pulled out a silver key. The old kind, with one rectangle tooth at the end and a red ribbon fed through the handle. “We have stationed Jim to watch over our victuals.”

They put a guard on the food. Wouldn’t matter. If the time came when when we needed something, I could take it, guard or not. I took the key and walked back toward the door I had come in. When I reached the end of the benches, he called out.

“We’ve been thinking, Kiril.”

I stopped but didn’t turn around. “What about?”

“Martun.”

“My daughter.”

“We all know she’s not really yours, Kiril.”

“You don’t know shit from Shinola.”

The Listener and his flock laughed. It sounded like a turkey coop at feeding time. When he settled, he said, “Doesn’t that loosen your right to guardianship over her?

I didn’t say anything.

“Perhaps she would be safer if she stayed in the village.”

“Is that a question?”

“It is for now.”

“Then, for now, you can go fuck yourself.”

He went back into that lunatic laugh of his.

 

\*\*\*

  


I walked back to the farm with The Listener stuck in my mind like a burr. Funny enough, I was almost on his side. Martun *would* be safer in the village. Ursa was putting her in danger. That didn’t mean I liked the guy. He was still a slime bucket who was losing his goddamn mind. The type of guy who would sit in a restaurant, put 10 bills on the table, and take one away any time the waiter made a mistake. Either way, if I handed Martun over to him, I would be voiding my contract, and as far as I could tell, that meant a few bullets in the back of my neck where I stood. And worse, no money.

 

**\[Why would money matter if you were dead?\]**

 

You want me to tell you what happened when I got back to the farm or not?

 

**\[Yes. Please do.\]**

 

I was in a state. I’d been patient so far, but the more I thought about it, the more fucked up it seemed. Her sitting there all day, not eating, not moving, starving herself and the baby. That selfish bitch. She wouldn’t let me hold her. We were there to do a job, and she was stopping me from doing that job. I stomped up the path to the farm. I was almost running. I flung the door open, and it slammed into the wall behind it. Ursa and Martun were where I left them.

“Jesus Christ,” she said. “You scared the hell out of me.”

Martun just looked at me.

With my muddy boots still on, I walked up to Ursa and took the folded piece of paper from my pocket. I held it in front of her face for a second before dropping it onto her lap. “You’re going to get us killed.”

She picked up the paper and gave it a good lookover. Then she did something I never expected. She giggled.

“Who wrote this?” She asked. “Is this from Brooklyn?”

“I don’t know,” I said, taking off my boots. “It’s from The Listener, so I don’t know what to believe, but I know for certain they’re worried about Martun. They want her close to them.”

“Number one, for example. How are we supposed to know how to do that?”

“What’s number one?”

“Here.” She stood up with Martun still attached to her and handed me back the paper.

I looked at it. I knew a few of the words, ‘the’, ‘is’, ‘not’.

 

**\[He laughs\]**



I tried to get out of the conversation. “Yeah, I don’t know.” Truth is, I couldn’t remember any of the commandments. I was caught up in the moment. It’s like when someone introduces themselves, and seconds later, you forget their name.

“It’s funny. I want to meet this Listener guy, now. He sounds like a character.”

“I’d love for you to meet the fucking guy.” My anger boiled back up in my throat. “Anything to get you out of the house. They want to take Martun away.”

Her look turned serious, and she squeezed Martun closer. “Because of those stupid commandments? Not happening.”

“That’s what I said. But you staying in here is no good for anyone.”

“What are you going to do? Are you with them? Are you going to take her from me?”

Of course I wasn’t, but I needed something to happen. I said, “I’ll drag both of you to town if you won’t go on your own. Let them decide what to do with you.”

“I know one of the men was killed. Is that what you’re worried about? You think if we break one of these commandments, they’ll kill us? Which one? Which one of these vague, contrived statements could they actually enforce?”

I threw the paper on the floor. “I don’t know. We’re here whether you like it or not for a long damn time.” I moved my face closer to hers. I wanted to intimidate her and for her to get a handle on what we were facing. There was no shrinks up here to walk her through her after-baby depression.

“What don’t you know?” She put Martun in the bassinet and picked the sheet up. Now she was holding it in front of my face and pointing at the words. “What part of ‘Stay true to thy character.’ is enforceable? It’s not even a commandment; it’s a proclamation, it’s a fear tactic.”

She pushed the sheet into my chest, and I put my hand over it.

“How do you not understand what I’m saying?”

I felt so small at that moment, like the dumb animal they always told me I was. Put me in any other arena. I’d rather be fighting a grizzly right then. “How do you not understand that this is all real?” I asked. I looked at the piece of paper again. It didn’t help that the handwriting was so fancy. “I can’t read it.”

“The script? I think it’s quite legible.” She looked confused.

“No.” I gave her back the sheet. “I have trouble with words. Reading them. I can talk them just fine, but nobody ever taught me how to write them down.”

Before then, I thought it was only in cartoons, but I swear her jaw dropped. Then she threw her head back and laughed. Must have lasted 30 seconds. She pressed her forearm into my chest, buried her head in it, and just kind of pulsated. When she composed herself, she still had one eyebrow cocked. I watched her mind churn, and she went through about a dozen facial expressions while I stood there like a cow on a gravel road. Then she got a touch closer to me and put my hand in hers. “I’ll teach you.”

Later that night, they came for Martun.

I woke up the morning after that scene in the chapel and zombie-walked to the studio. Brooklyn was still snoozing. We were starting to get into a solid routine, but that moring was different. You don’t need coffee when the first thing you see after booting up your comp is Kiril and Ursa patting down the dirt of the shallow grave they just finished digging in the trees behind their house as the morning sun filters through the leaves. Little Martun was in the bassinette just far enough away not to get dirt flung on her. My heart was going HAM, and all I could think was, *what did I miss*?

I scrolled back through the feeds and landed on the exterior shot of the yard from above the front door. It was time-stamped around 2:30 AM, and the camera was aimed directly at the gate and showed a bit of the path leading to Epitown. The two idiots that were on a mission to snatch Martun didn’t even try to be stealthy. I remembered them both from casting. They were pals in the other place—barely 18 years old. They got picked up after a string of B&Es where they were raiding peoples’ liquor cabinets and gun lockers. The smaller one was the brains behind their operation. Skinny, ratty blond hair, and probably had FAS, but it could have been permanent brain damage from malnutrition or all the drugs they did. They walked up the trail like they were on a Saturday afternoon hike, goofing off and chuckling. Even when the gate opened with a *creeeeeaaak* it didn’t phase them. They had no idea who they were dealing with on the other side of that farmhouse door. It still haunts my dreams. I don’t blame Kiril for what he did because anyone in their right mind would have done the same, but it just wasn’t a fair fight. Sure, there was two of them, sure it was the middle of the night, sure they were after baby Martun, but Kiril is not built like a normal human being. That fight was not fair. Seems like even if he tries to lay a gentle hand on a person, for whatever reason, they end up with a broken bone. When he actually wants to hurt you, more often than not, you’re dead.

Kiril sat up in bed when that gate whined and shook Ursa awake. He pulled Martun out of her bassinet and handed her to his wife. “Stay here. Hold her tight.”

“What’s going on?” Ursa took Martun in one arm and rubbed the sleep out of her eyes with her free hand.

“They’re outside.”

Ursa sat up straight, held Martun close to her chest and rocked back and forth. “Be careful, hun.”

Kiril pulled on his pants, pulled the drawstring, and left the bedroom without a word. He moved through the kitchen and put both hands on the counter with the kitchen table between him and the front door. He lit a cigarette that was rolled with old man’s moss and hauled on it deep. The door to the cabin opened silently, and the two lads entered the home. Kiril took another big pull off the cigarette, and the boys must have seen the ember flare because the bigger one said, “We’re here for the kid.”

Kiril dropped his smoke on the floor and snuffed it out with his bare foot. He kept his hands planted on the counter with his back to them.

The smaller, hot-headed kid said, “Bitch, give us the fucking baby! I’m going to gut you. Fucking cut and gut you.” He had a knife and was slashing the air, trying to make it look like he knew what he was doing, but came off looking like a kitten batting at a ball of yarn.

Kiril removed his hands from the counter and turned towards the two intruders. “Where’d you find that knife?”

“None of your biznazz,” the kid said.

Kiril held out his hand. “Let me see it.”

“Not a chance in hell, motherfu-”

Before the kid could finish his sentence, Kiril flicked one of the kitchen chairs directly at the boy’s chest. One of the chair legs caught him in the chin and he went down. He was probably more startled than injured, but it gave Kiril the second that he needed to dive over the table and catch the bigger kid by the throat with a grip that could squeeze sap from a petrified tree trunk. He pulled the boy in close and whispered into his ear. “Go.”

The millisecond that Kiril’s grip loosened the boy was out the door and booking it back to town like a pack of dogs were chasing him.

The boy who took the chair to the face was still pulling himself off the floor. Kiril walked toward him and waited until he was on both feet before wrapping his fingers around the kid's knife hand. “Nice blade. Let me take a look”

The kid released his grip from the knife, and his arm fell limp.

Kiril put his hand on the kid’s shoulder and held up the knife. “Hmm. It could get the job done.” It was a metal brace from one of the prebuilt cabins in the village sharpened to a point. Kiril pressed the blade into the kid’s throat. “Does anyone love you?”

“No.”

Kiril pressed a bit harder. “Then what you doing out here?”

The kid’s head drooped. “Money and freedom.”

“Me too. Now, I can’t promise I’ll meet them, but any last words for your family?”

“The Listener. He sent us.” The boy was blubbering. “Don’t kill me, sir. Take the knife. You can have the rabbit. We caught one earlier.”

Kiril smiled and pressed the knife into the boy’s skin so that it indented into a deep pocket. A little more pressure and blood would flow. “Why does he want her?”

“Money and freedom. Money and freedom,” the kid sobbed. “Martun is power.”

Ursa opened the bedroom door. “Kiril, don’t. Please.”

Kiril relaxed his knife-hand. “Why not?”

Ursa had the bottom of her nightgown balled up in her hand. “Because we have to live with these people.”

Kiril tossed the knife aside and grabbed the boy by his throat. “Just let him go?”

“I don’t know, babe.”

To the boy, Kiril said, “Not a fucking chance you get to leave here without knowing why you’ll never, ever come back. No matter who gives you orders, you’ll tell them to stay the fuck away from this house.”

“I won’t tell, I swear.” The boy was shaking now. I do get that if someone threatens to kidnap your child, you can’t just turn the other cheek.

“You won’t what? Tell them to stay the fuck away from here?” Kiril cocked his fist, ready to hit him.

“I mean I will! I’ll tell them. I’ll tell them all. Stop. Please.”

Kiril turned to Ursa, “One punch, yeah?”

“He’s a kid, babe.”

“I got a lot worse when I was his age.”

To this day, I’m still not sure if Kiril did what he did on purpose. He relaxed his grip on the boy, but before the kid could squirm away, he popped him one square on the button. It looked like he hardly hit him. Just a little tap.

“Ouch,” the kid said, not even that loud. He was still standing when the blood started dripping. Kiril walked away, and Ursa stepped in with a rag to try to stop the flow from the kid’s nose. The rag wasn’t big enough… Or absorbent enough. Blood poured out of him like a broken fire hydrant. Kiril sat at the kitchen table and just watched while tapping his foot on the floorboards.

Ursa set the chair that hit the first boy upright. “Sit down.”

The boy sat and started sputtering and spitting while Ursa tried to keep him from tilting his head back. “Don’t put your head back,” she said. “It won’t stop it, you’ll just swallow it.”

He vomited. The puke was blood red.

“It’s not stopping, Kiril.” Ursa’s hands were shaking.

Kiril rubbed his forehead. “Fuck.”

Blood was dripping off her elbows now. “It’s not stopping.”

The kid’s face was blue where the red hadn’t stained. He slowly leaned to one side and Ursa did everything she could to keep him upright, but this kid must have weighed a buck sixty at least. He ragdolled to his left and landed face down without lifting an arm to break the fall.

“I’ll get the shovel,” Kiril said.

  
\*\*\*  


That was a turning point in Kiril and Ursa’s relationship. They had sex for the first time after that night. In fact, I re-watched the footage yesterday… And maybe once this morning. Obviously, what we streamed was hacked and slashed down to the bare essentials, to what is considered “tasteful.” We just kind of implied that it happened.

I can’t say they became some cliche lovey-dovey couple after. They weren’t teenagers. They still had basic survival to deal with, but for some reason, killing and burying that kid built some much-needed trust between the two.

She was lying back on the bed with her legs halfway open. Not fully open, but you can see those white panties. They must have been one of the two or three things that were left on set that weren’t intentionally grunged up. Those panties were whiter than anything else Kiril would see for the next decade or two besides the snow. But those panties did it for him. Not going to lie, they did it for me too. If I edited it into a scene, I’m sure the half a million people that were following us at the time would have literally died from dehydration after cumming so hard.

She was laid back on the bed. I’ve been there too, unsatisfied for a year or two. Shit, I’ve gone five years. That feeling goes deep into the soul. She had her hand there pushing down on the outside of the fabric, pushing through the growth that had come up over the last few months. Using that long black finger to push through the scraggle and get to where she needed to get.

In her eye-cam, you can see Kiril bulging against his burlap slacks but he didn’t want her to know it. She knew, though. Nobody could miss it. He circled the bed, acting like he just wanted to tuck her in, pull the blankets up to her neck, and leave her alone after. Well, he pulled the blanket over her, but she tore it away, showing her pearl-white panties with her hand in them. Her whole vibe was like a pot of water ready to boil.

“Touch me.”

“I don’t want to wake the baby.”

“Touch me, you fucking pussy.”

He put his rough fingers over the top of the white fabric, and she covered her mouth to muffle her groan.

“That’s all you want?” he whispered.

“I want more than that,” she said through closed teeth.

He grabbed her by the hair at her forehead and pulled it back. She moaned louder. He pulled the white cotton to the side and pressed his hand on her skin. Her panties were so white next to her dark skin, and that’s what made them seem whiter. She whined, then exhaled and pinched her knees together. He pulled away and grabbed her underwear at her hips with both hands and slid them off of her in one motion. Then he pushed her knee to the side with the back of his hand.

“Is this you? Is this how you are?” His voice was barely a whisper.

“This is how I am now, and sometimes, and for you.”

He sunk his hips into hers.

“I hear music,” she said. “Old music. Like my parents used to play.”

“Are you going to cum for me?”

“Baby, I’m almost there already.”

“You cum for me now, you come with me to town later, yeah?”

“Just keep fucking me.” She ran her hands over his shag carpet of a chest.

“Say it.”

She nodded. “I will. I will.”

Kiril grunted, pushed himself off of her, flipped her over onto her belly, and pulled her ass toward him. “Been a while since I fucked a black girl.”

We kept that line in, and to the shock and awe of a few thousand horny, virginal, Verse users, she giggled and let him keep going. Can’t blame her. Kiril’s an absolute stud.

  
  


# Kiril

No one in town made a peep about that boy’s bed going empty. It was early in the show. Can only think he hadn’t made a real friend yet. That, or they got the message.

1pwjaks,https://i.redd.it/kxlbvwug2n9g1.jpeg,MC6 vs Weber Key Mk II — conical grinder advice [$no budget],"Hi all, 

Coffee is…addicting, so I’m back looking for some input as I decide on conical burr grinder to add to my setup.

Current setup:

La Marzocco Linea Mini
Weber EG-1 (used for filter + lighter/clarity-focused espresso)

I’m looking for a conical grinder primarily for espresso milk drinks, mostly medium to dark roasts. Body, sweetness, and texture matter more to me than clarity or filter performance as the EG-1 serves that purpose and still performs amazingly for espresso as well. I really like the flavor I get from Mazzer 71mm conicals (local café runs a Robur S).

I’m currently deciding between the following but open to others as well:
Kafatek MC6
Weber Workshops Key Mk II

I’ll be honest: I love the design of the Weber Key, Kafatek not so much. That said, I’m not dating the grinder, espresso quality matters most, and I’m happy to live with the beast if the cup is better.

Budget isn’t a concern. This would be espresso-only. Workflow matters, but cup quality comes first.
Would love to hear from anyone who owns or has compared these, especially around:

Shot consistency
Mouthfeel/sweetness in milk drinks
Long-term ownership impressions

(This post was organized with AI help because I’m coming out of a long burnout and my thoughts are still messy, but the experience is mine.)

I never planned to work in coffee.

I never chose it as a business, a hustle, or a way to “make it.” It just *happened*. I needed to live, coffee was there, and it worked. The money was always secondary, almost accidental.

What coffee gave me wasn’t status or income. It gave me regulation.

Tasting, roasting, calibrating, evaluating defects, talking about flavor with precision, those things were easy for me in a way most of life never was. Not “easy” as in shallow, but easy as in natural. It grounded me. It quieted my brain.

I’ve recently been diagnosed autistic as an adult, after years of severe burnout. Looking back, coffee wasn’t just something I was good at, it was one of the few spaces where my nervous system could relax. Flavor has rules. Sensory input is honest. A cup doesn’t lie or perform.

People often highlighted my palate, my sensitivity, my blunt feedback. I didn’t experience that as talent or harshness, it was just perception. If something tasted oxidized, it was oxidized. There was no emotional layer to negotiate.

That clarity is rare outside sensory work.

When burnout finally hit hard, the first thing I lost wasn’t productivity, it was pleasure. Tasting stopped being grounding. Everything became noise. That’s when I understood something was deeply wrong.

I’m not writing this to romanticize burnout, autism, or coffee. I’m writing it because I think many of us in this industry mistake regulation for passion, and endurance for vocation.

Coffee sustained me, but it also carried me far past my limits because I didn’t know I had any.

Now I’m resting. Really resting. No competitions, no goals, no next move. Just letting my system recover and seeing what remains when there’s no pressure to perform.

If I come back to coffee, it will be because it still brings calm, not because I’m “good at it.”

If not, I’m grateful anyway. It kept me alive longer than I understood.",3,1766794084.0,CoffeeRoasting,0,1.0,False

No NSFW right out of the gate either please.

Good morning/afternoon/evening/whenever this post may find you, and may it find you well! Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text.

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

* 25-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* Childfree (non-negotiable)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR WDIS POSTS**

* Position-specific scoring rules (PPR, TE premium, 4 or 6 pt passing TD, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, std/PPR, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
* This week's opponents of your players
* Entire roster if helpful

---------------------

**PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS BEFORE POSTING YOUR OWN**

* When answering questions, please make sure to **sort by NEW!**

----------------

**WE HAVE A BOT THAT CAN REFERENCE THE BORIS CHEN RANKINGS AND GIVE YOU FEEDBACK**

To invoke the bot, comment anywhere in this sub in the following format:

!boristiers position [player, player, player...]

Where position is a standard position acronym (dst, flex, qb, rb, te, wr) and player, player, player... is a comma-separated list of players for that position. Here's some examples:

!boristiers flex [hunter henry, keenan allen, melvin gordon]   
!boristiers rb [matt breida, tevin coleman]  
!boristiers qb [lamar jackson]  

The bot will reply to your comment with a table of player ranks in the format of {tier}.{position_in_tier} for each of the applicable forms of scoring. If a player is not found / ranked, they'll be denoted as N/A.

----------------

**WHEN ANSWERING QUESTIONS**

* Do **NOT** reply with only the player name. This just removes the other person from the index without them getting information. You are not helping.
* Explain why you would start that player.
* Remember most people know how to look up rankings. They come here for discussion, start a discussion!
* **Please respond directly to the OP or the Bot will not pick up your comment**

----------------
**individual WDIS threads posted after this point will be deleted in order to keep the subreddit clean. Post here instead! If everyone sorts by new, your questions should be answered.**

They arrived on scene to discover a semi-conscious woman who bore signs of severe injuries and mutilation consistent with torture.



The bedroom in which she was discovered contained bloodstained ligatures, bedding, clothing, and a variety of weapons including a baseball bat, a hatchet, a kitchen knife, a machete, and dumbbell plates, all of which bore signs of use. 



In the center of the room was a large shattered mirror. Broken glass covered the room. One shard approximately eight inches in length and three inches in width was lodged in the victim’s stomach.



The victim, who was clearly delirious, told officers that her boyfriend did this to her. “But it’s not his fault. He was crazy, and the mirror made him crazier.”



Despite extensive search efforts, no other individual was discovered on scene, including the victim’s boyfriend. It should be noted that this man was never located, and to date is considered missing.



EMS transported the victim to the hospital, where emergency surgery commenced.



No matter what treatment was rendered, the wound inflicted by the large mirror shard would not heal.



After significant medical intervention, it stopped bleeding but did not knit, effectively leaving the victim with a small cavern in her abdomen.



Approximately two weeks into her hospital stay, one of the nurses providing treatment went into hysterics and refused to go back into her room. When asked, the nurse explained that while performing wound care, she “looked inside the patient’s wound and saw a room.”



According to the nurse, the patient herself was somehow inside this room inside the wound, smiling back at her.



The patient was not capable of providing any additional information. At this time, she was still extremely mentally unstable owing to her ordeal, and medically fragile. 



Shortly after this, the patient was taken for further study with the goal of closing her wound once and for all.



The details of this study are disturbing and fundamentally irrelevant.



Suffice to say, the medical professionals studying her wound also observed this bizarre “room” described by the nurse. Following a distinctly unfortunate incident relating to this room, hospital staff facilitated her transfer to the custody of AHH-NASCU.



The inmate, Ms. Pauley, has been with the agency ever since. She is currently a T-Class agent assigned to the agency director.



Ms. Pauley’s ability is simply astonishing. In simplest terms, she is the keeper of an open-ended pocket dimension. This dimension takes the form of a living room paneled in mirrors. Ms. Pauley says the space is identical to the living room of her childhood home except for the mirror walls.



The entrance to this pocket reality is the wound cut into Ms. Pauley’s abdomen by the mirror shard. Ms. Pauley and Administration both agree that the spectacular properties of this wound derive directly from the properties of the broken mirror that inflicted the injury. After taking her into custody, Agency personnel attempted to find additional shards of the mirror but were unsuccessful.



Notably, the pocket-dimension includes a front door that, when opened, leads to other locations. Previously, Ms. Pauley claimed to have no idea where the door led. However, following the recent escape of Inmate 70 (Ward 2, “The Man Who Never Smiles”) the agency learned that Ms. Pauley not only knows where the door leads to, but can control where it goes. 



Given Inmate 70’s unique abilities, Ms. Pauley was not disciplined for his containment breach. However, on 12/14/24, when she was caught trying to help Inmate 22 (Ward 1, “Lifeblood”) breach containment.



It should be noted that Inmate 22 reported Ms. Pauley of her own volition, although she displayed extreme emotional distress at the idea that Ms. Pauley would “get in trouble.”



After this incident, Ms. Pauley was fitted with a device that removes her ability to control whether to open or close her pocket-dimension. When the device is active, her body is intact, the wound appears to be healed, and no going in or out. The agency director currently monitors this device himself.



Ms. Pauley is a 51-year-old adult female. She is 5’9” tall, with brown hair and blue eyes. She suffers from major depressive disorder and anxiety. Despite extensive therapy and full compliance with her treatment plans, she experiences significant distress whenever she looks into a mirror. 



Ms. Pauley has historically been extremely cooperative with Agency directives, but due to recent events she was reclassified to uncooperative status.



At the director’s discretion, she still maintains T-Class status, albeit in a highly restricted capacity.

My boyfriend used to talk to mirrors.



He told me that talking to his reflection was a coping mechanism he developed as a kid. I had a few of my own weird coping mechanisms, so I understood. I didn’t like it — mirrors have always made me uneasy — but I understood.

Besides, talking to the mirror wasn’t the only bizarre thing he did, and certainly not the scariest. Not by a long shot.



*Crazy* is a bad word, especially for people like me. I hate using it, even now.



But looking back, Philip was crazy.



But at the time, his particular kind of crazy felt familiar. He felt comfortable. He felt like home. Everyone wants to find home, me included.



So what are you supposed to do when crazy feels like home?



No one else has ever felt like home to me. Only him. 



And he wasn’t a monster. Far from it. He was sweet and thoughtful, and stable enough to get custody of his baby sister, Alice, who adored him. They had the same eyes, this spectacular pale green. 



Most importantly, Philip was sure about me from the very beginning. He showed it, every day. He once told me that he knew we were meant to be from our very first conversation. Like he’d known me his entire life. Or that we’d known each other in a thousand prior lives. 



I didn’t believe in any of that, of course. But I believed the way he treated me.



And he treated me extremely well.



Above all, he was so considerate. It’d take days to tell you everything he did for me. But just as an example, I once told him no one had ever read me a bedtime story. From that point on, every night before we went to sleep, he’d tell me a story. Sometimes fairy tales, sometimes urban legends, usually stories he made up himself. Falling asleep next to him while he whispered a story in my ear is one of my favorite memories, even now.



I asked him once where he got his story ideas. “From the mirror,” he teased. “I talk to it, and it talks back.”



In a lot of ways, he was wonderful.



Now, don’t get me wrong. Our lows transcendently awful. But the highs were correspondingly spectacular. And even on the worst days, we never went to sleep angry. That was a first for me. Even if we’d been fighting, even if we’d been screaming, even if we were angry and even if I was scared, that all melted away as soon as we got into bed and he started telling a story. 



That’s why it was so easy to stay with him.



As for the things that made it hard to stay — well, that’s where my own weird childhood coping mechanism came into play.



When I was a little girl, I used to imagine a little pocket behind my heart. A hidden, dark, secure, and above all safe place where I put all my bad feelings.



That pocket is where I shoved all my fears and doubts about Philip, and it’s where I hid all the instincts that screamed at me to leave him. 



There were a lot of those. Too many. But the heart-pocket was magic, so whenever I had too many bad feelings for the pocket to hold, it grew to accommodate them.



Once, after this particularly insane fight, I could practically feel it expanding. I felt it stretching from my heart to my hips, gently displacing my organs and grazing along my bones. I was sure I’d be able to press down on my stomach and feel it hiding, firm and heavy and full of all the darkness that threatened my light.



I hated our fights. I hated how they made me feel. I hated how they made him feel. I hated that they were never about anything important. I hated that Alice had to hear them.  



Most of all, I hated how he talked to the mirror after every one of those fights.



Because no matter what he said about coping mechanisms, he only ever got worse after he talked to mirrors. 



There was one day, maybe a week after the new year, where we basically started fighting the minute we woke up.



Nothing I did helped. No matter what I did, everything just kept getting worse and worse, snowballing into something uncontrollable. I could feel it in my gut and in the depths of my heart-pocket: 



We were headed for disaster.



And that night, he didn’t get into bed with me. He stayed in the bathroom, talking to his mirror.



What I heard him say was terrifying.



He kept repeating *Every life, we kill each other.*

  


And he kept saying he needed to sever “the soul tie.” How pain is the only way. That’s what he kept saying: *Pain is the only way. The greater the pain, the cleaner the cut. You have to do it. It’s the only way to end this forever. It’s the only way to save each other.*



I tried to shove all the fear into my heart-pocket, but it wouldn’t fit. It kept bursting out to run through my bloodstream in terrible electric surges.



Finally I couldn’t take it anymore. At three in the morning on that frozen January night, I confronted him.



He had a full-bore breakdown.



He started screaming and begging by turns. Grabbing me and shoving me against the wall, only to fall to his knees begging. He asked me to forgive him. He said we were cursed, that the angel in the mirror told him so and the angel never lied. He said he loved me so much that he would do anything to break the curse. Anything to sever the soul tie.



Anything to set each other free.



Something in his face made me sure that he was about to hurt me.



So I dragged Alice out of bed — it wasn’t hard, she was wide awake and crying, bright green eyes swollen and swimming with tears — bundled her into her coat, and took her to the car.



It was snowing. We slipped and slid on the icy driveway as gusts of wind tore through our coats. Philip came after us, screaming, begging us to stay. That he needed to save us once and for all.



He even chased after the car. I saw him in the rearview mirror, a manic shadow that only vanished when I turned the corner and sped away.



The snow was coming down hard and the wind was spinning it out into billowing blankets. It was impossible to see.



I wasn’t driving well to begin with because of stress. About ten minutes after we left the house, I hit a patch of ice. The car spun out of control. I heard Alice scream.



The next thing I knew, I woke up in a hospital.



Philip was slumped in a chair by my bed, fast asleep and whiter than a sheet.



I tried to wake him up, but my head was swimming. The world was tilting. I couldn’t remember anything. I fell asleep again.



When I woke up, the doctors told me I’d make a full recovery. By some miracle, I’d survived.



Alice had not.



Somehow, Philip didn’t blame me.



It’s so awful to say, but losing Alice changed him for the better.



No more fights, no more screaming, no more anything. Just hopeless gentleness.



He stopped doing all the little considerate things I’d loved, so I did them instead. I didn’t tell him bedtime stories, though. That was a uniquely Philip thing. Even the thought of whispering fairy tales to him as he drifted off felt like a betrayal in a way I couldn’t articulate.



The only thing that didn’t change was the mirror.



He still talked to the mirror.



He always kept his voice so low that I couldn’t make out his words. Sometimes it sounded like two voices. But one morning, about a year after we lost Alice, I woke up to the familiar sounds of his mirror-conversation. For once, he was talking loudly enough for me to hear.



And he was crying.



“How am I supposed to hurt her? How can you expect me to do any of this?”



Then he shushed himself, and his voice returned to that indistinguishable softness.



I almost left that day.



But I didn’t.

The next morning, Philip basically became a different man.



He woke me up with toast and coffee for breakfast, something he hadn’t done in nearly two years. He started smiling again, and doing all those little things he used to do.



And that night, after I climbed into bed, he brought me a cup of tea. While I sipped it, he finally told me another bedtime story:



*Once upon a time, a woman named Akrasia fell in love with a man named Kairos. But Kairos wouldn’t have her. Kairos was rich, you see, while Akrasia lived with her penniless father in a hovel by the sea.*

  


*Out of desperation, Akrasia went to the god Hynthala. She entered his mirror palace and offered anything and everything in her possession if only Hynthala would make Kairos love her. ‘You have nothing,’ Hynthala told her. ‘Nothing but the clothes on your back. Clothes do not buy love. Love buys love. Your father loves you. Bring me your green-eyed father, and I will make Kairos love you.’”*

  


*So Akrasia brought her father to the mirror palace. Hynthala accepted him as an offering, and told her to go to Kairos. “He will love you now and forever,” he promised. “From this moment until the very last star dies for the very last time.”*

  


*Akrasia went to Kairos. True to Hynthala’s word, he loved her above all else.* 

  


*But he still would not take her to wife.*

  


*He would have to renounce his family and the bride they had already chosen for him. Though he loved Akrasia deeply, he would not forsake everything for her.*

  


*Akrasia held onto hope that Kairos would change his mind, but he did not. On the night of his wedding, she flung herself into the sea and drowned.*

  


*Kairos grieved her passing deeply, for he did love her. But although he loved Akrasia until his dying day, he never regretted the choice to keep his family, his position and his inheritance.*



And that was the end.



“This story is about us,” Philip said quietly.



I felt sick. I knew, somehow, that this was Philip’s way of ending things with me. 



Through tears, I asked, “So what, am I supposed to be Akrasia?”



“No.” He cupped my face. “Never.” His thumb brushed across my cheekbone, smearing the tear against my skin. “You were Kairos.”



For the second time, something in his face made me sure I was about to die.



Before I even realized what I was doing, I was halfway out of bed. But when my feet hit the floor, the world spun and stretched, swinging upward, and I fell back.



Philip shot forward and pinned me down. I tried to struggle, but every time I moved the world flipped upside down. I felt like I was stuck to the ceiling, ke whatever was holding me was giving way. Like I was about to fall to the floor and smash like a porcelain doll.



“It’s going to be okay,” Philip soothed. “I promise. Listen. Please listen. I’m doing this because I love you. I have to sever our tie, for your sake and for mine. We find each other in every life. It should be beautiful, but it’s not. We always destroy each other and everyone around us. The mirror told me. The mirror never lies. If I’d listened to it, Alice would be alive and you would be happy somewhere else. I know it. *I know it.*”



He tied me down. I tried to fight, but whatever he put in my tea rendered me helpless.



As he worked, he explained what he was going to do and why.



“Memories don’t transfer, but essence does. We have to make our essence remember. The only way to do that is suffering. We have to make it hurt so badly that our essences repulse each other in the next life and every life that comes after. It’s the only way we’ll be happy: By making sure we never love each other.”



Then he got up and left. I tried to wriggle out of the restraints, but every time I moved my head, the room spun.



Some time later — maybe a minute, may be ten minutes, maybe an hour or six or two days — he came back with the mirror. He put it on top of the dresser, angling it so I could see myself.



Then he came to the edge of the bed and told me another story.



I could barely follow his words. My head was swimming. Consciousness dipped in and out, just like when I’d been in the hospital after the wreck.



*A long time ago, two homeless orphans were best friends: a beautiful and very angry girl, and a sad little boy with a green-eyed cat that he loved more than anything except the girl. All they had was each other. They slept during the day to avoid those who might prey on two small children alone in the world. They woke at sunset and traveled at night, stealing fruit from moonlit orchards and eggs from sleepy chickens in their coops.*

  


*But when winter came, the orchards died and the chickens stopped laying. The children were soon starving.*

  


*One bitter morning, the girl left the boy and his green-eyed cat sleeping in a barn, and revealed herself to the farmer.*

  


*The farmer welcomed her into his house, but he did not help her.*

  


*When the boy woke to find the girl gone, he thought she had abandoned him, so he cried. But then his green-eyed cat hurried to the barn door, meowing.*

  


*When the boy left the barn, he heard the girl screaming from inside the farmhouse.*

  


*His little cat found a way inside through a broken window and led him through dusty, sunlit rooms to a door, behind which he heard the girl weeping.*

  


*She was in a terrible state, but he helped her to her feet. The cat led them  back through the dusty, sunlit rooms to the broken window. The cat jumped onto the sill, but lost her balance and fell back. She knocked a pot to the floor, where it shattered.*

  


*The sound alerted the farmer. As he came crashing down the stairs, the boy helped the girl through the window. He tried to follow, but the farmer caught him.* 

  


*The boy’s last memory was the sound of his cat meowing as he died.*

  


*The girl tried and save him, but she was too late and too wounded besides, and died for her trouble.*



When Philip finished, he leaned over and picked up a baseball bat. It made me scream, which made him cry.



“I’m sorry,” he wept. “I’m so, so sorry.”



He brought the bat down on my knee, once, twice, three times.



Agony. Pure, white-out agony. I could hear myself scream, but barely noticed. The mirror loomed across from me, dark as a nighttime pool. I imagined teeth inside the glass, bared in a smile.



Philip talked to the mirror after. As he spoke, I felt my heart-pocket shudder and expand. I pretended to open it and dropped things inside: Fear, the dizziness, the overwhelming pain in my knee.



It was slow and tortuous, but by the time Philip had finished and curled up next to me, whispering tearful apologies, I was able to sleep.



The next day, he told another story. 



But I interrupted him quickly, calling him a fucked-up, gender-bent Scheherazade. I told him he needed help. I promised I’d get him help. I told him I loved him, I still loved him and would always love him and none of this changed that, just please, please, please, *please*—



He struck me with enough force to daze me.



As my ears rang and dark spots swarmed my eyes, Philip told another a story in between his own sobs.



He told me of another life where I was captured by a warlord. He traded his green-eyed sister to the warlord to free me so we could escape together. But it was all for naught, because we died anyway, long before we reached safety.



As he spoke, I saw glimmers of his story. Scenes from a fading dream. The warlord grinning as he pulled the green-eyed sister in and shoved me out. Philip’s sick and haunted eyes — but they weren’t Philip’s eyes, it wasn’t Philip’s face. The devastated countryside, the bugs and animals feasting on the dead left to rot among the rocks. The roving band that finally killed us long before we reached our destination.  



When Philip finished, he pulled out a knife.



I immediately kicked him, sending the knife skittering across the floor. He moaned, then picked up the bat and smashed my other knee.



He screamed even louder than I did.  



Then he talked to the mirror.



After he left, I prayed — not to God, but to my heart-pocket. I prayed for it to become huge. Bigger than big, bigger than the room I was in.



And it answered. I felt it grow. Felt my organs shifting, the tickle as it scraped along my ribcage. When I felt it was big enough, I opened it up and dropped myself inside it.



Part of me was still in Philip’s bedroom, gazing blankly at the mirror while I wept.



But the other, bigger, more important part was inside my heart-room.



It looked just like my childhood living room early on Saturday mornings, right down to the cartoons on the TV and the half-eaten bowl of cereal on the floor and the battered cardboard boxes stacked against the wall to predawn gloom outside the windows.



I sat on the floor, criss cross applesauce, and watched Looney Tunes and ate soggy cereal until Philip came back.



He told me another story, some fucked-up beauty and the beast analog about a man who was a monster inside and out, and the woman he loved who was just as monstrous, but only on the inside. When they were finally caught, she betrayed him to save herself. He attacked her in a heartbroken rage, only to find out it wasn’t true — her betrayal had been a clever ruse to save him.



The hunters killed them both. He died loathing himself as he drowned in his own blood. 



There were no glimmers this time. I saw the entire thing in the mirror, as clearly as if it were playing on TV.



Philip hurt me again. I don’t remember what he did, because I managed to hide inside my heart-room before the pain entirely hit.



But even from the depths of my heart-room, I heard Philip talking to the mirror.



And this time, I heard something talking back.



For the first time, it occurred to me that I was losing my mind. With that realization came a storm of rage, pain, and above all, terror The terror made me feel crazier than all the rest put together.



I felt it coming up my throat, like vomit but impossibly too much. Enough to tear my throat open, to rupture my stomach, corrosive enough to burn holes in my heart-room.



I ran blindly to the stack of battered boxes in the corner, dumped one out, and vomited everything inside me into the box.



The box swelled and undulated like it was going to burst open, but it held.



When I was done, I closed up the box.



Then I shuffled back across the room, sat down in front of the blaring TV, and continued to eat my cereal.



Philip came back a while later to tell me yet another story of how our other selves did nothing but ruin each other and everyone around them.



I don’t remember what it was about, because the moment I saw him, I opened the door to my heart-room and hid inside.



This is how it went for days. Maybe weeks. Maybe even months.



Every day Philip told me some awful bedtime story where some man or woman or child destroyed the person who loved them most out of cowardice or calculation or terror.



After every story, he hurt me. After he hurt me, he told me through his own tears that the pain was another blow against the soul tie. Once it was cut, we would finally be free and in the scheme of eternity, all of this would be nothing but a bad dream. 



Then he would talk to the mirror, and the mirror would talk back.



No matter how deeply I hid in the pocket-room beside my heart, no matter how loudly I crunched cereal or how loudly I turned up the volume on the TV, I always heard the mirror talk back.



That frightened me. The point of my pocket-room was to protect myself. To preserve my sanity. To make sure I got out of anything I fell into alive.



But even my room couldn’t protect me from the fact that Philip’s mirror always talked back.



Philip got worse and worse. I barely noticed. Even when he hurt me, even when he wept afterward, even when he crept into bed and held me while he sobbed into my hair, I barely noticed. How could I? I was sitting in my cozy living room, watching Looney Tunes and eating my favorite cereal while the sun came up.



I was happy there. No one, not even Philip, could touch me while I was happy. 



It got to the point where I couldn’t even remember anything he told me, or differentiate the pain of one injury from another.



But I do remember the day he broke the fingers on my right hand.



He cried because I loved to play the violin, and with broken fingers I would never be able to play again.



That made me laugh.



That’s why I remember it: Because it made me laugh until I gagged.



I mean of all the things to worry about while you’re torturing your girlfriend to death, that’s what breaks you?



That was actually it, though. It really is what broke him.



After that, Philip told the mirror he couldn’t hurt me anymore. That he would never hurt me again.



For some reason, that pulled me out of my pocket room. Just as I surfaced, he left. 



I tried to go back inside myself but couldn’t. The door to the pocket room was locked.



So I stared at the mirror, crying weakly as tides of pain drowned me.



As I faded out, the mirror flickered to brightness. Just like a TV.



And I saw another story.



Two men in military uniforms, cut off from their squad and hiding from enemies. One was a monster of a man, a quintessential soldier. The other was his opposite, small and badly wounded. He expected the big one to leave him. *I* expected the big one to leave him.



Instead, he bundled the small one in his own jacket and kept watch for hours while the winds screamed and enemies trekked by obliviously. He built a small fire and used it to cauterize the small one’s wound.



When the coast was finally clear, he hoisted the little one onto his back and carried him for hours, until he caught up with their squadron.



No one got hurt.



No one betrayed anyone else.



No one died.



And the two of them stayed best friends until the day the big one died.



It was a good ending. A happy one.



And I knew, as that story faded away, that it wasn’t the only happy one.



I focused on the mirror, willing it to show me something else. Something that was good.



It did.



And a third time.



And a fourth.



Again and again and again, all day long.



Philip finally came back, apologizing. “I got weak. I’m sorry. That was unfair to you. I have to be strong to break our tie for good. From now on, I will be.”



I saw that he had a hatchet with him.



The truth flooded out of me. All of the good stories. All of the love. Every last detail of every last happy life.



“Where did you see this?” he asked.



“In your mirror,” I said.



For the last time in his life, Philip had a breakdown.



But unlike his other breakdowns, this one felt right to me. Even positive. Like the breakdown was an earthquake shattered the hole in which he’d fallen, and he was riding back to the surface on a tidal swell of broken earth.



Like he was finally coming back to himself. 



Like a spell had broken.



Once it broke, he ran to me and started untying my restraints. 



But then the mirror spoke again.



Something ancient and deep and awful, something that made my bones thrum.



The mirror blazed to a flat, brilliant, shimmering darkness.



Philip threw it to the ground, shattering it.





The broken glass shot upward and whirled impossibly, like a tornado. Pieces spun out, cutting Philip, embedding themselves in the walls. One huge shard flew at me. I saw Philip’s reflection for an instant, and then my own right before it lodged itself in my stomach. I felt it cut my pocket room. I felt the contents spill into my bloodstream.



The storm stopped. Shards fell to the floor like shining rain, thudding on the carpet, clattering against the glass still clinging to the frame.



As I watched, the floor inside the frame flickered and vanished, transforming into a void. Into a bottomless black tunnel. Just like in the cartoons I watched in my pocket-room.



Shining white hands rose out of the mirror tunnel and gripped the frame as Philip reached for me.



If my pocket-room had not been cut, I would have reached for him too. I would have pulled him close, away from the glimmering black tunnel and those shining monster hands.



But my pocket-room had been cut. Everything inside it — all the hate, all the pain, all the rage, for Philip and for everyone and everything else  — was surging through me now. I’d been torn open. I had become a passageway. A door. A portal, not just for my own pain but for the suffering of each and every life we’d been cursed to share.



When he saw my expression, he crawled back. Glass crunched under his hands. He left smeary handprints of blood on the carpet.



His backed into the broken mirror. The moment he touched it, those shimmering white hands grabbed him and pulled him down into that insane tunnel.



I lunged after him. When I hit the floor, every bone and muscle in my body screamed. But that pain wasn’t enough to stop me.



I crawled to mirror frame and looked down into the tunnel. There he was. Beneath him, far below in the darkness, something billowed into being. Something ghostly bright and shimmering, with monstrous hands grasping upward.



I reached for him, lost my balance, and started to fall.



And as I fell, I saw the walls of the tunnel or the wormhole or whatever you want to call it were alive. Like a cosmic TV. I saw things I recognized. Things from my own life, things from my life with Philip. I saw other things that I didn’t recognize with my eyes, but still recognized with my heart.



I saw things I didn’t know at all. I saw things that frightened me. I saw things that felt terribly wrong, and things that felt beautifully right.



Ten million scenes from ten million lives, whirling around me, bright and almost blinding against the dark tunnel.



Somehow I knew, in the truest part of me, that I could have reached out and fallen into any one of those lives and lived there without being any the wiser



But I didn’t care about any of those lives.



I only cared about Philip falling into the arms of the monster far below.



My fingers finally brushed his. His hand convulsed on mine. Pain exploded as the broken bones ground against each other.



I thought he was going to claw his way up my arm. Even though it would hurt, even though the pain would be exquisitely hideous, that was all I wanted.



Instead, he shoved me away



He continued to fall.



But I shot upward, spinning back like a retracting yoyo, far, farther, farthest, past the empty mirror frame and back in the bloodstained bedroom.



Even though the room tilted and swam, even though I was in more pain that I could even comprehend, I dragged myself to the phone and called the police.



This will sound insane. More insane than what I’ve already told you.



While I waited for the ambulance to come, the shimmer-handed monster spoke to me from the shard of mirror lodged in my guts. “It was impossible to make him let you go.”



“Is it broken?” The room swam around me. I wondered if I was about to die. “The…the soul tie. Is it broken?”



“There is no soul tie. That was a lie. I tell many lies. Even the lives I showed him were lies. Most of them weren’t even yours.”



I started to cry. “Did he end it, at least, like he wanted to? That’s all he wanted. Is it over now?”



“No. Didn’t you hear what he told you? Nothing is over. It will never be over. Not until the last star dies for the very last time.”



I yelled at it, but it didn’t answer. He never spoke to me again.



Which is rude as hell, especially when you consider that he still occasionally crawls out of the tunnel his mirror cut into my stomach.



\* \* \*





If you’re not interested or up to date on my office drama, this part won’t make sense or matter, so feel free to leave it.





After that interview, I was a wreck.



So I went to see Numa.



Even though I didn’t particularly want to invite him, Christophe looked almost as sick as I felt, so I asked him to come along. He declined.



So I set off alone.



Numa was my first patient, and still one of my favorites. I don’t talk to him often because he just…doesn’t like talking. But I interview him about once a month, and I feel like we’re making slow progress.



Unbeknownst to me, the Agency recently acquired an injured puma cub. Yesterday they had me present it to Numa. Long story short, they’re getting along famously. Numa’s already named her Cub.



I watched them play for a while, then went back upstairs.



As is typical these days, Mikey was waiting for me.



But this time, I was finally ready for him. I immediately made eye contact and asked, “What’s on your mind?”



“There are five wards in the Pantheon.” He answered quickly, like they always do when I make them talk. “Ward One, where we’re at? It’s kind of like fancy ad-seg. Or federal prison. I know about both. I guess you do, too. Just from the opposite side of the cell door.”



“What else?” I asked.



“I was supposed to be A-Class, and you were supposed to be me sidekick. Seems redundant if you ask me, but Admin really liked the idea. But I fucked it up. That’s why you’re stuck with Charlie. Sorry.”



I filed this information away for further consideration. “Why do you want me to be best friends with Christophe?”



It’s hard to explain, but the best way I can put it is Mikey put up a shield. Not enough to stop me from compelling him to answer, but enough to tell the truth without telling the whole truth. “Because he’s a company man for a company that holds in contempt. He gets punished when he obeys, and punished when he doesn’t. He needs is for someone to convince him he fits in. You’re different than him, but not that different. That means you can convince him he fits in.”



“Why can’t you do that?”



“I’ve tried. I can’t. But I think you can.”



I tried to pull out more information, but he was resisting. People try to resist me all the time, but no one ever succeeds.



Except Mikey was, in fact, succeeding.



Christophe came stomping in, breaking my concentration. I felt Mikey slip through.



“Wait here,” he said, then followed Christophe.



I waited patiently for several minutes. Then it finally occurred to me:



*What the hell am I doing?*

  


Thoroughly spooked, I spun around and went after them. I couldn’t find Mikey, but I found Christophe brooding in the empty conference room. He’d been out in the woods because he reeked of evergreens. The smell was almost enough to put me at ease.



“What do you want?” he asked.



“You should go see Numa. He named the mountain lion Cub.”



“Of course he did.”



I waited, trying to figure out what to say to make him look at me. Once he looked at me, I could make him talk. About what, I didn’t know. But I figured it would come to me, like it always did.



Finally I asked him about the mirror shards. “Didn’t they ever ask you to like…track them down?”



“They did.”



“Couldn’t you?”



“Of course I could. I told them I couldn’t.”



That made me laugh. “I can’t say I’m grateful for much here, but I’m pretty grateful to not have to worry about getting sliced up by pieces of a magic mirror. And that’s all thanks to you.”



“It is.”



My patience died. “Christophe, look at me.”



He did.



“What do they do to you downstairs?”



I felt that same sense of deflection I’d gotten from Mikey. Of telling the truth, but not all of it.



“They make me into what they need.”



“What do they need?”



“A vicious dog who does bad things for his bad rewards.” His face contorted, not terribly but just enough to compromise the humanity in it. His eyes took on the mirror-like shine that I despised. “You don’t have to make me talk to you. I will answer what you ask.”



“Okay.” Even though I didn’t want to, I went over and stood beside him. He tensed up. I couldn’t help but wonder what he was afraid of. “Then tell me, what do they do?”



“I never remember. Only that it hurts very much during, and that I feel very good after. When we first met, and I made you frightened — when I liked how it felt to make you frightened — they had just finished with me. Their work was supposed to last a long time, but it lasted a very short time. They are unhappy and they think it’s your fault. I have told them it is not. I have told them you and I do not even get along.”



“We kind of do, though.”



“If we got along, you would not look at me and see only teeth.”



I didn’t know what to say.



“Do not feel sorry. You are right to see what you see.”



We stood in silence for a moment.



Then he said, “I have not always done bad things for bad rewards. I have done the right thing, sometimes. But always too late, and the right thing does not matter if you do it too late.”



I felt a twinge of instinct that made me want to recoil from him and from myself, but knew I had to follow it if I wanted any kind of positive outcome. So before I could think about it — or rather, think myself out of it — I put a hand on his shoulder.



He tensed up again.



“That’s probably true,” I said, “but the fact that you can think that far about it still puts you way ahead of all the other staff here. I can see that just as clearly as I see your teeth. Is there anything I can do or say to keep them from hauling you downstairs?”



“Yes. You can stop whatever this is.”



With that, he shrugged me off and stalked away.



I won’t lie, it was a relief to see him go.

He won’t be gone for long, though, because I just got next week’s interview schedule and he’s still assigned to attend each and every one.



I hope that means they’re not planning on taking him downstairs any time soon.



Partly because I don’t really want anyone to hurt him, and partly because I have the feeling he’s the only person here who will talk to me about all the different wards.



I guess all I can do is wait and see.

here's what I do:  
  
Keep a small envelope in your car with $5-15 gift cards, these are perfect for grabbing coffee between errands or picking up small things, if it's in your car you might remember to use it.  
  
Put all amazon and online shopping cards in one place near your computer, I keep them in a drawer I open daily. When you're about to buy something online it's more likely, you'll see them and remember to check the balance first.  
  
For restaurant cards, take a photo of each one and save it in a phone album called ""gift cards"" with the balance in the photo name. When you're deciding where to eat you can scroll through and see what you have, update the name when you use some of it!  
  
Check for expiration dates and set a calendar reminder. Some cards lose value after a year or have fees, so knowing what you have matters.  
  
The key is making them visible and accessible, gift cards hidden in a drawer might as well be worthless. They're basically free money if you actually use them, ORGANIZATION is key because each card works for specific things.  
  
Also pro tip: if you get a gift card for somewhere you know you won't use, regift it or trade with another teacher, no shame in that, better someone uses it than it expires.

# Taste the Difference: Why Organic Coffee Matters

That morning cup of coffee might be doing more for you and the planet than you realize, especially if it’s organic. Beyond the rich aroma and energizing jolt, choosing organic coffee supports sustainable farming practices that benefit both consumers and the environment.

Organic coffee is grown without synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. This means fewer harmful chemicals end up in your cup and, crucially, in the soil and water systems where the beans are cultivated. Farmers who practice organic methods often focus on biodiversity, soil health, and water conservation, creating a more resilient ecosystem around their farms.

Here’s why making the switch is a brew-tiful idea:

*   **Healthier for You:** By avoiding synthetic chemicals, organic coffee reduces your exposure to potentially harmful residues. You get pure coffee flavor, unadulterated by artificial inputs.
*   **Better for the Planet:** Organic farming protects soil fertility, conserves water, and promotes biodiversity, helping to maintain the natural habitats essential for countless species.
*   **Supports Farmers:** Organic certification often means fairer prices and safer working conditions for the farmers and communities involved in growing your favorite beans.

1pwixqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CougarsAndCubs/comments/1pwixqx/should_i_confess_to_a_friend_mother/,Should I confess to a friend mother?,"Hello everyone.I used a little AI to fix my grammar since english is not my first language. I’m a 34(M), and I’m attracted to a divorced mother of a friend who is 60(F).

For a bit of context, I met her about seven years ago. A friend from university told me she was having problems with her computer, so I went to help her. She turned out to be one of the nicest people I’d ever met—very friendly, easy to talk to. We had a great conversation. I found her quite to be very pretty, but not enough at the time to try anything beyond that.

Years passed, and last year she contacted me again because she was having issues with her computer and printer. This time it was paid work. I went to her house, fixed the problems, and afterward we had tea and a long conversation about everything—from work to relationships. I realized then that she still looked very good.

After that, I went to her house about three more times for other technical issues, but nothing really happened. Then, around April, her son got married, and we both attended the wedding. That night, I couldn’t take my eyes off her. She was wearing a dress that fit her curves perfectly, and her smile made her look ten years younger. That was the moment I fell for her.

That evening, we took photos at a photo booth, danced, had a drink, and talked for a while. She eventually left early because she was tired from all the wedding preparations.

A few months later, I visited her again. When I arrived, she gave me one of the nicest hugs I’ve ever received. She treated me to lunch before I helped her with her technical issues. After that, she invited me out for coffee at a nearby shop. We talked about relationships, and I asked if she was looking for a partner. She told me that there was a man who was interested in her, but he had not made a good impression. She also said she sees me like a son and believes I’ll find a nice girl to start a family with—although the person I want is her.

We continued talking by phone, sending videos, and keeping in touch. Eventually, she suggested we go for a walk in the park and then have lunch. I agreed, and two weeks later we did just that.

We talked about everything. She mentioned some bad behaviors from past partners that I don’t have, and she told me she had stopped any further progress with the man who had been courting her. He had pressured her to prioritize him when she went to visit friends at the beach, which made her uncomfortable. We had a really nice lunch, and when I was leaving, I told her that one of the best hugs I’d ever received was from her. She responded by giving me another big hug.

Now, here’s my dilemma. On New Year’s Day, we’re planning to have lunch together at her apartment and talk about what’s been going on in our lives. After that, I want to confess my feelings. However, I don’t want to pressure her. She has said she doesn’t want to feel forced to give attention to a partner, that she values her freedom and  doing some activities on her own, and there’s also the fact that she’s my friend’s mother.

Because of this, I was thinking of asking her whether I have any chance of having a relationship with her—keeping things as they are, but acting like lovers when we’re together.",2,1766793317.0,CougarsAndCubs,3,1.0,False
1pwixof,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkGathering/comments/1pwixof/i_went_home_for_christmas_something_is_slowly/,I Went Home for Christmas. Something is Slowly Killing My Parents,"The last thing I said to my parents was cruel.

I’d felt suffocated for months, drowning in their small-town life, and I just couldn't breathe. I don't remember the exact words I threw at them, but I know I wanted it to hurt. I remember the look on my mother’s face, like I’d physically struck her. My dad stood there, silent and stony, watching me pack my bag and scolding me for ‘talking to my mother like that’.

I slammed the front door so hard the stained glass rattled in the frame. I got in my car, blinded by rage and falling snow, and I drove away.

I hadn't spoken to them since. Months of stubborn silence. But standing at the end of the driveway now, looking up at the house, that anger felt old. Distant. Like it belonged to a different person.

All I felt now was the cold.

The truth was, I had nowhere else to go, and I couldn’t imagine spending Christmas anywhere else but home. I’d been stubborn, and if they were angry, I’d deal with it. I really needed to make things right, and I hoped they'd be happy to see me.

The cold was bitter, bypassing my coat and settling deep into my chest the moment I got out of the car. The house looked inviting, though. The bay window was glowing with that familiar orange warmth, and the Christmas tree lights blurred slightly behind the frosted glass. 

I wasn't the only one watching the house. 

Felix, our old tabby cat, was sitting on the low brick wall that lined the garden. His black-and-grey fur was puffed up against the chill.  His yellow eyes wide and unblinking, tracked my journey up the path. He trotted over to me and rubbed his body on my leg. 

“Well hello there stranger,” I said, squatting down to stroke the spine of his back. 

The front door opened with a heavy creak that vibrated in the quiet air.

Dad stepped onto the porch.

The sight of him knocked the air out of me. He looked older than I remembered. Worse. His skin was a dull, flat grey, like wet newspaper and he was wrapped in a thick woollen cardigan that seemed to drown him, hanging in loose folds off his shoulders. He looked gaunt, like he'd been eroding; the substance of him being slowly scooped out from the inside, leaving just the skin.

He hugged his arms around his chest, shivering as he looked down.

His expression softened and confused, but his eyes were glassy; filmed over?

“You’re back,” he whispered, relief in his voice.

I let out the breath I'd been holding. *He wasn't angry.*

“I’m back, Dad,” I said, my voice cracking. “I... I wanted to come home.”

Dad shook his head, a small, sad smile touched his lips.

“Come on in then, you daft thing,” he muttered, shivering. “I suppose you’ll want feeding.”

He turned, holding the door open. I stood up, my legs stiff and heavy, and followed Felix inside.

Dad closed the door, he leaned his forehead against the wood for a second closing his eyes, looking exhausted. Drained.

“You’ve been gone a while,” he murmured.

“I know,” I replied. “I’m sorry.”

I removed my coat and reached for the empty hook by the door, but stopped. It didn't feel any warmer inside. The chill still engulfed me, so I pulled my hand back and put my coat back on.

Dad shuffled down the hallway, his slippers dragged against the floorboards with a slow, rhythmic rasp, like sandpaper on wood.

I followed, the hallway feeling narrower than I remembered. I glanced at the gallery wall, filled with school photos, holiday snaps, the graduation portrait I hated. Mum used to dust these every Sunday like clockwork, but now, a thick, grey film coated the glass, blurring our faces and our smiles. On the telephone table, a tower of envelopes sat unopened. Bills. Flyers. The stack was messy, sliding sideways, and a red ""Final Notice"" poked out from the chaotic heap. 

This didn't make sense. Mum was militant about organisation. Seeing that mess... I felt like I'd walked into the wrong house.

The kitchen air felt thick, but not with the inviting warmth a Christmas kitchen usually permeates., this just felt…thick. Dense. The smell of roasting turkey and sage was there, but underneath it, there was something else. Something off. Like stagnant water, or damp.

Dad moved to the fridge. The light inside flickered as he pulled the door open. Mum stood at the sink, her back to the room, facing the dark window. She was peeling a potato, her movement slow and lethargic.

""Look who showed up,"" Dad whispered with forced cheeriness, staring into the bright, humming interior of the fridge.

I leaned against the counter, crossing my arms. Dad looked worse in the harsh light of the kitchen, his skin translucent and waxy. Mum’s shoulders were hunched, and rigid. She held herself with a brittle stiffness. 

She paused briefly, whispering ""Oh that's nice, love,"" before continuing with her rhythmic peeling.

Dad moved to the small wooden table and collapsed into his chair, his eyes fixed on the salt shaker in the centre of the table as his thumb traced the grain of the wood.

*Something is wrong here.*

The house was freezing, Dad had lost a scary amount of weight, and Mum... she just said 'that's nice, love'? My fiery, loud mother, just... whispering? This wasn't like my parents. 

Dad cut through my panic.

""Do you remember that time we all went to the fair?"" Dad said, his voice quiet.

I forced my brain to switch tracks, digging through childhood memories to find the image he was looking for. 

""On Yardley Park?"" I asked.

The corner of Dad's mouth slowly turned upwards, just slightly. ""The one on Yardley Park.""

""Yeah,"" I said, a small, tired smile touching my face. ""I remember.""

""We got there,"" Dad continued, his eyes still fixed on the shaker. ""We’d gone on a few rides. But it was getting late, and we needed to go home.""

He went quiet, looking down at his hands and watching them tremble.

The guilt prickled at me, sharp and familiar.

""I decided I didn't want to go,"" I said. ""I ran over to the funhouse.""

Mum’s hand stopped moving. She gripped the edge of the porcelain sink, her knuckles white, the skin pulled tight.

""We looked for over an hour,"" she whispered to the window. ""I was so scared.""

""I was a git, I know,"" I said. ""I remember you grounded me for two weeks. I was so mad at you.""

Mum let out a shaky breath. ""I was so angry.""

Dad looked up then. He looked at Mum’s rigid back.

""To his face you were,"" he said softly. ""But when he wasn't looking, you were just relieved. You kept thinking of things to do together once he’d finished his grounding.""

The room seemed to warp at the edges.

""I never knew that,"" I said, looking at Mum. ""I thought you were just... angry.""

Dad smiled, a sad, thin thing. ""You couldn't stay angry for long though, could you?""

Mum shook her head. She wiped her cheek with the back of her wet hand.

""I couldn't,"" she whispered. ""I never could.”

The moment held for a heartbeat, then shattered.

Dad’s eyes dropped back to the salt shaker, his thumb resumed its work. Mum turned back to the window, and the knife found the potato. It happened so fast. The life that had flickered in their faces vanished, replaced by a gloomy grey vacancy. It was like watching a machine reset. 

A cold dread settled in my gut. This felt forced and unnatural, like a heavy curtain had dropped back down, cutting them off from me.

I had to get out of this room. I could feel my eyes start to well.

""I’m going to wash up,"" I said quickly, trying to keep my voice level. I didn't wait for an answer, I turned and walked out.

The damp smell followed me through the hallway and up the stairs, the banister a frozen ribbon of ice beneath my hand. As I turned toward the bathroom at the top of the  stairs, I saw the door closed and the light turned on, and underneath the door, a shadow danced back and forth.

*Was someone in the bathroom?*

My heart quickened as I drifted toward the closed door. 

*Surely Dad would have mentioned someone being here?*

The door handle started to turn. I stopped, watching its slow rotation.

*Someone is in there.*

The handle stopped dead.

*Shit.*

My eyes scanned the landing for something, anything, to grab. Nothing.

*Fuck.*

The door jerked open, and I stepped back, my body tense, and my breathing unsteady.

""Hello, Charlie.""

A woman stood in the doorway. She was petite, with bright eyes and cheeks that flushed with a healthy, vibrant colour; a stark, violent contrast to the grey, waxy pallor of my parents downstairs. She wore a neat blouse and a cardigan that looked freshly laundered. A cloying scent of floral soap wafted off her.

She beamed at me. A bright, bubbly smile that felt piercing in the gloom of the landing.

I stepped back against the banister.

“Hello?"" I said.

She clasped her hands together, tilting her head. ""I wondered when you'd get here.""

""I'm here,"" I said, my voice thick with confusion.

""Yes, you are.” She stared at me, her smile fixed. 

An awkward, heavy pause stretched between us. She didn't blink enough. She seemed too comfortable, too at home in this freezing, decaying hallway.

""Sorry,"" I said, straightening up. ""Who are you?""

""I'm a friend of your parents,"" she said, her tone breezy. ""I've been looking after them while you've been away.""

I thought of Dad’s hollowed-out face, Mum’s lethargic peeling, the dust on the photos, and the unopened bills.

""Looking after them?"" I repeated.

She smiled and nodded, eager, like a puppy waiting for a treat.

""How?"" I asked. The word came out sharper than I intended. I looked around the landing. The wallpaper was peeling. The air smelled of damp. 

*Looking after them how? They look like shit. The house looks like shit.*

""Little things,"" she said.

""Little things?""

She smiled again. Another nod.

The anger flared in my chest. 

""What little things?"" I asked through gritted teeth.

She just smiled.

*Smug little…*

""I've been here for them while you've been away, Charlie,"" she said softly.

Well that hurt. It hit me like a physical blow in the stomach. The guilt I’d been suppressing surged up, twisting into defensive rage.

I looked at her, really looked at her. She was too clean. Too happy.

*A fucking scammer.*

The realisation sunk in. She was one of those people who preyed on the elderly. Worming her way in and isolating them, letting them rot while she slowly siphoned off their savings, waiting for them to die so she could clear them out. That’s why the heating was off. That’s why they were starving.

""I'm back now,"" I said. I made my voice hard. A warning.

Her smile didn't falter, but her eyes seemed to drill into me.

""Are you?"" she asked.

“Yes."" I said.

""For how long?""

""For however long I'm needed.""

Her expression shifted, and I saw a flicker of something else, pity, maybe? Or annoyance?

""OK, Charlie,"" she said. ""But I hope it's not too long.""

She stepped past me and a wave of cool air followed her. She walked to the stairs and began to descend, her hand trailing lightly over the banister.

I watched her go, my heart pounding. That felt like a threat. I was a problem. She knew I’d disrupt whatever long-con she was running on my parents.

I looked back at the open bathroom door, then down the dark stairwell where she had disappeared.

*This is all my fault.*

The tears fell, and the world became watery and indistinct. I ran to the bathroom and gripped the cold porcelain of the basin until my knuckles ached. I looked up into the mirror, expecting to see my own red-rimmed eyes, instead, I saw a grey, blurry mess. I tried wiping the tears away with the back of my hand, but they kept coming, my reflection still smudged and distorted.

I squeezed my eyes shut.

*I bet I look like shit.*

I splashed water on my face and dried it with a towel musty smelling towel.

*I had to face this. I had to fix this.*

I reached for the door, but in my haste, I fumbled and missed the handle. I stared at my shaking fingers.

*Get a grip.*

I focused, steadying my hand, and opened the door.

The hallway was dark. My parents' bedroom door stood ajar at the end of the hall. From inside, the quiet sobs of my Mum drifted onto the landing.

I slowed my pace and hovered at the doorway.

My mum sat on the edge of the bed with her back to the door, a tissue balled in her hand. I could see her shoulders shaking, hear the wet, stifled catch of her breath as she tried to hold it in.

“Mum?” I whispered, not wanting to make her jump.

She let out a deep, shuddering sigh. She straightened her spine, dabbing the corner of her eye with her tissue. 

“I’m fine,” she whispered.

“You don't seem fine, Mum.”

A small, quiet sob escaped her. She shrank further into herself, pulling her arms tight around her waist.

“You left us,” she choked out. “If you’d just stayed, we’d be fine. We’d all be fine.”

The light in the room seemed to dim. A shadow passed over the bulb, and a sudden, sharp chill washed over me, raising the hair on my arms.

“I know, Mum. I’m sorry.”

I took a small step forward. I wanted to hug her. To comfort her. I wanted to tell her that if I could go back in time, I would. That I wouldn't have left. I wouldn't have stayed away.

But I didn’t say any of that. The words stuck in my throat.

If I'd have known. If I'd have just… The guilt twisted in my gut. All they ever did was love me, and I left the door wide open for some fucking scammer to walk in and do this to them. I abandoned them, and a predator walked right into the void I left behind.

She just sat there. Crying. Quietly.

I looked around the room. The fire that had filled this house was gone. The light, gone. The life... gone.

I stood there, helpless, watching her cry.

“My heart feels broken,” she whispered.

I took another step toward her, wanting to reach out and comfort her, but my eyes were drawn to the sideboard to the right of where she sat.

I remembered it was usually bare, just a coaster and a lamp. Mum didn't like what she called 'tat' on show, but now it was crowded, a collection of items arranged in a circle of unlit tea lights, and in the centre, a smooth, dark grey stone. Some sort of large beach pebble, polished by the sea. It looked like a shrine. Or some sort of altar.   

I moved closer, drawn by a sick curiosity.

There were photos propped up against the stone. A copy of my graduation photo and a shot of us at the beach, but they had been defaced. The glossy paper was torn and white where my face used to be. Scratched out. Erased with violent, frantic strokes of a needle or a knife.

What the hell was that woman doing?

Next to the photos lay a scrap of paper. The handwriting was jagged and unfamiliar.

*Our journey is done. Let the wandering cease. Bind our memories to the dark.*

""What is this?"" I asked, my voice rising in panic. ""What the hell is this?""

I turned to look at Mum.

She stood up from the bed and moved slowly toward the sideboard.

""And who is that woman?"" I demanded, pointing out to the hall. “Is she making you do this?""

Mum took a deep, shuddering breath and closed her eyes.

""This is my hope for you,"" she whispered, placing her hand on the black stone. She leaned in, her lips moving in a silent, frantic rhythm.

I stared at her.

“You’re not religious?” I questioned, confusion taking over. 

She continued to whisper.

*I couldn't watch her do this.*

I reached out to grab her hand. I needed answers. I needed to know what the hell was going on.

""Mum, stop!”

My fingers brushed against the back of her hand, the side of my palm grazing the black stone.

The reaction was instant. Violent.

A piercing headache drove a spike through my left temple, then a physical shockwave, and screeching static that engulfed the room. My vision blurred. The floor seemed to tilt aggressively to the left.

I fell to my knees, clutching my head.

Mum didn't flinch. She kept her hand on the stone, whispering into the dark.

""Stop,"" I pled.

The darkness rushed in from the edges of my vision. Heavy and suffocating. I hit the floor, and the world went black.

I felt numb.

My eyes flicked open to the dim amber light of the living room. I was sitting in the high-backed armchair by the fire, my head lolling against the wing.

I tried to stand up, but I couldn’t move. 

My limbs felt like lead. Disconnected and lost.

""Hello, Charlie.""

The woman breezed into the room. She looked even fresher now, her cheeks rosy, her blouse crisp. She held herself with an infuriating, bouncy energy that made the grey stillness of the room feel even deadlier.

""What did you do to me?"" I rasped.

""I think you got a bit overwhelmed,"" she said, clasping her hands.

I tried to lunge at her, but I just twitched in my chair. The panic spiked.

""Your doing something to them!"" I blurted out.

The woman smiled. ""I hope so!""

*She’s a monster. A sick twisted monster.*

I willed my arms to rise, or my legs to lift me, but I was frozen in place.  
""Why can't I move?""

She sighed.

Felix trotted into the room. He looked at me, gave a soft *chirrup*, and jumped up onto my lap. He circled once, kneading my paralysed legs with his claws, and settled down, purring against my chest. The weight of him was the only thing anchoring me to the room.

The door creaked and dad walked in.

""Dinner's nearly ready,"" the woman chirped.

Dad stared at the unlit fireplace. ""Dinner's nearly ready,"" he repeated. His voice was hollow and monotone.

He walked over to the drinks cabinet. Glass clinked against wood.

""Dad!"" I whimpered. The sound was small, pathetic. ""Dad, look at me.""

He grabbed a bottle of scotch and two heavy crystal tumblers and walked over to the small coffee table in front of me.

He put one glass down in front of himself, and another in front of me.

He poured a measure into his glass, then he poured a measure into mine. The amber liquid splashed against the crystal.

""One for you, son,"" he whispered.

He lifted his glass, tapped it against the rim of my glass, a lonely, singular chime in the quiet room, and then downed his drink in one swallow.

I stared at him. I saw the gaunt, grey skin of his neck. The way his collar hung loose. A tear leaked out of my eye and tracked hot down my frozen cheek.

""Please let them go,"" I whispered to the woman. Defeated.

She stood by the door, watching us.

""I can't,"" she said softly.

""Why?""

""Dinner's Ready.” Mum’s voice drifted from the dining room. It wasn't the voice I remembered. It was tired. Reedy.

I watched Dad slowly push himself up from the chair. He looked at my full glass of whisky for a second, shook his head, before he turned and shuffled out of the room.

""You coming?"" the woman asked.

""I can't mov…”

I flinched and my hand jerked off the armrest.

The paralysis vanished as quickly as it had come. The weight had lifted.

I pushed Felix gently off my lap and scrambled to my feet, my legs shaky.

I stumbled out of the living room and into the hallway. It stretched ahead. I passed the gallery wall again, forcing myself to look at the photos. My parents, younger, standing on a pier, squinting into the sun. Smiling.

I remembered the argument. I remembered the heat of it. The way I’d thrown words like stones, intending to hurt. *I can’t even remember what it was about.* 

I wished I’d just shut my mouth. All they’ve ever done is love me, and I’d repaid them with silence.

*I fucking hate myself.*

I reached the dining room door, the smell of the turkey was overwhelming.

I stepped inside.

Mum and Dad were seated at the table. The candles were lit, casting long, flickering shadows against the walls. They’re plates opposite each other, Dad was just taking his seat at the table. 

I moved closer.

There were only two places set. Two plates. Two knives. Two forks.

I looked at the empty space where I would normally sit. The wood was bare. No mat. No glass. No plate.

The woman lurked in the doorway behind me, silent.

*Only two places?*

""Mum?""

Tears were streaming down Mum’s face. They dripped off her chin, landing silently on her plate. Slowly, in perfect unison, my parents turned their heads. They picked up their wine glasses, held them up, toasting the empty air where I should have been sitting.

""Cheers to you, Son,"" Dad whispered, his voice breaking. ""We miss you every day.""

The words hung in the air.

""I'm here,"" I choked out. ""I'm right here.""

I slammed my hand down on the table, but there was no sound. No rattle of cutlery. No thud of flesh against wood. My hand passed straight through the mahogany as if it were smoke.

I stared at my hand.

The smell of turkey and sage vanished, replaced instantly by the smell of wet earth and diesel.

The ""damp"" smell I’d been tracking through the house. It wasn't the house. It was me.

""No,"" I whispered.

The woman stepped out of the shadows, her smile giving way to a solemn, gentle expression.

“Your journey is done,"" she whispered, repeating the words from the note. ""Let the wandering cease.""

My eyes wandered to the space next to Mum. On the table lay a photo. My graduation photo. Mum, Dad… and me. Smiling.

""I drove away,"" I whispered, closing my eyes. 

The headlights cutting through the white. The rage screaming in my ears.

Then, the cold.

The deep, bone-crushing cold.

""How long?"" I whispered, opening my eyes.

""A while,"" the woman said softly.

I looked at my parents. Dad's arm wrapped around Mum, their eyes glassy, their frames so frail. 

I’d missed so much.

""Please,"" I said to the woman, my voice fading. ""Look after them.""

She nodded. ""I will.""

I looked back at my parents one last time. I wanted to stay. I wanted to scream that I was sorry, that I loved them, that I hadn't meant a word of what I said that night.

I'd... I'd never get the chance now.

I felt the cold lifting. The heavy, dragging weight in my limbs dissolving into light.

""I love you,"" I whispered.

Mum smiled, just a little, as if she had caught a drift of familiar scent in the air.

The candlelight flared. The room blurred. The grey static rushed in, but it wasn't terrifying this time; I didn't fight it.

I closed my eyes and let it take me.

1pwiums,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1pwiums/aio_for_asking_my_friends_for_space/,AIO for asking my friends for space,"TLDR- I asked my friends for space after we had a disagreement, they got mad at me, and we haven’t talked in months. This is kind of long, sorry! 

My friend we can call A (24F) and I (24F) have been friends since we were in grade school and fairly recently we became friends with someone we worked with (27M- we can call him F). We have been on and off friends with him because of his rude and weird behaviors, but we were all pretty good in May. At the end of May, we went on a camping trip with my family, and my college roommate, K, (25F) came with. The three of them have met and spent extended time with each other before, different spaces but at the camping place as well. 
We discussed sleeping situations before and everyone was good with the decision, as there was a lack of space and I wanted to make sure everyone was comfortable. My college roommate, K, was going to sleep in my bed in the upstairs loft, friend A was going to sleep in the bed next to mine that she always slept in, and friend F was going to sleep on the floor at the foot of the beds. I was going to sleep downstairs in my mom’s room. It is important to note that these are not usual rooms, the beds are less than a foot apart, are only camping sleeping pads on the floor, and on the other side of the stairs going up to the loft is my sister’s (16) room where she was sleeping with my niece (9). My sister in law and her other child (4) were downstairs in the living room. 
When we were going to bed, I was at the stairs asking if everyone was comfortable and needed water or anything, and we were talking about plans for the next day. All of a sudden, friend A started loudly voicing how bad she felt for friend F because he was sleeping on the floor and started like dragging him up to her bed. We were not friends that would usually share beds in the first place, and the beds are extremely small, so this was very weird. My college roommate, K, is pretty timid and shy but I could see how uncomfortable she was getting. I explained that we agreed on the bed situation and that this new situation was making everyone uncomfortable but friend A would not let up. I didn’t know what to do because it was so awkward, so I just looked at friend K and she shrugged so I thought it would be fine, said how weird F and A were being, and left. 
In the morning F and A were gone when I went up to the loft, and K was visibly uncomfortable. I asked if she was okay and she explained that F and A started making out after F was stating his feelings for A. K said that she was shocked and felt weird so she sat up and made it obvious that she was still up, but they didn’t stop. F and A were also making out when K woke up, and they shortly left without saying anything to K. I told K how bad I felt that I put her in that situation, and we talked about how weird that was. I said I would talk to them and we would find a new sleeping arrangement for the next 2 nights, or even ask them to leave if K wanted me to. 
After our first few activities, K pulled me aside and said she wasn’t feeling well and felt like she should go home. I knew there was more to it, but respected her decision and she left. A and F stayed for the next 2 nights but it was strange. There were a few times where I was cooking in the kitchen, or just chilling on my phone when they went up to the loft and F would ask over and over if I was still inside. I also caught them on top of each other, literally a minute after my niece and nephew were in the loft with them. 
When I got home, K called me and explained that F and A also had sex on that first night, but she was so grossed out and did not want to damage my and A’s friendship so she didn’t want to tell me. She told me because my sister, niece, and nephew were also there. 
The next day, I asked if I could talk with F and A, and we all sat down and I asked if there was anything going on between them and what happened when we were camping. F went silent and A got defensive right away. I didn’t get mad or shout, but just brought up points that made me upset. I asked why they thought it was appropriate to do that less than a foot away from K, let alone while in the extremely close space of my underage sister and niece and nephew. After I brought all of that up, A just kept insisting that absolutely nothing happened. F said that he didn’t want to say anything. 
Once I realized we were not getting anywhere, I asked F to leave. Now it was also weird because A had been living at my house (rent free and not paying for anything) for the past year. I asked that she go to her house and explained that I just needed some separation and space. F left, and A and I had another conversation where I said I would still want to be friends, but their actions were completely inappropriate and frankly gross, which is the reason I needed some space. I never said that she needed to stop talking to me completely, only asked that she go to her house for a little while. 
For the next 2 weeks, she did not say anything to me at all. I was leaving on vacation and my family asked her to watch my dog 2 months prior. I reached out asking if she would still be okay with this, and she only responded to my mom when she asked the same question. Since she was speaking to my mom, I asked her to let A know that F should not come over while I was gone, as he was telling everyone at work how horrible I was. 
To shorten this, F came over to my house multiple times, and the last time I called him and asked him why he would do that when I clearly asked them not to have him over, and he started screaming at me and calling me names. When I got home from vacation, A was already gone and we were supposed to go to plans we had made before all of this happened and she never said anything so we didn’t go. We have seen each other maybe 4 times since then, and texted in length about 2 times. Each time she seemed like she was mad at me for asking for space, saying that me asking for space and “not talking to her” hurt her, even though that did not happen. She also mentioned multiple times that she didn’t understand why K and I were upset, as it “only lasted 3 minutes.” 
I have always said to her that I wanted to try to make our friendship work but she is hung up on me asking for space, and is almost offended that K and I were upset. It has been multiple months, and they are now dating, so I’m not sure if I want to see her, since every time she talks the entire time about what they are doing together, and the minute I talk about anything that we all used to do, like how I went to our favorite coffee shop, she gets mad and says she can’t talk about that. We hadn’t done anything together since summer, and we ran into each other, the first time with all 3 of us there, and she literally turned her back to me when I said hi and then acted like she didn’t know me. 
Everyone that knows about the situation also thinks what they did is weird, and that their behaviors after are uncalled for, but I just want to see if I am overreacting.

I have been trying to organise and clean my sons' playroom for the past 3 hours, but I struggle so much. It is my tornado organisation style. I need tips beyond ""just focus on one small area"". 

I make a cup of coffee. I start doing one drawer, but then i see something that needs to go somewhere else. I put that thing there. Now I see something in that area that needs organizing. Oh, but I need a plastic bag, let me go get one in the laundry room. Now I see an old craft project that I forgot about. Let me put that here so I don't forget. What was i doing again? I walk back there and the original drawers contents are everywhere from the beginning. I should really clean that up. Maybe I will try another drawer. Groceries are delivered. I need to bring those in right now! I put the cold stuff away and see ham. I ask my son if he wants ham and cheese. Now I make him ham and cheese. Finally, I can orgnanise! I need labels. JFC, where are my labels? I need them RIGHT NOW. Let me look all over the house because i am going to cry if i can't find them. Meanwhile, I never finished putting the groceries away and left salmon and ice cream out... I dont realise until an hour later. JFC. I am such an idiot.

The cycle continues. Now it is 3 hours later. In the playroom, drawers open everywhere. I have a cape on because in the middle of this fiasco, my son wanted to put capes and run around. The other rooms are a mess. I have had a few meltdowns and had to take deep breaths. My husband is taking my older son out so I can have some air. I am finally sitting and having a hot cup of black coffee to calm down and write this post.

I really need help. I am trying to get a diagnosis finally because I am at a breaking point. My symptoms make existing so hard, harder beyond what it should be. I am not sleep deprived because my kids sleep great and i sleep a lot. My husband is supportive.

There is a strong branding/story/visuals attached to it as I'm in marketing - reaction has been positive. While industry is saturated, my product is incredibly distinctive - people rarely say no. Goal is to place in coffee shops, specialty/lifestyle stores, and traditional pet stores.

All of the below since 11/01 and while working my full-time job:

\- Local WGN TV media feature - they're filming me in Feb and running on the news 5 times or so for a Valentine's Day feature (not expecting A LOT of sales here just credibility)

\- Sold \~80–100 units so far mostly at in-person events, $25/each, margin with Amazon ingredients is at 68%

\- 100% conversion on vet clinics and event partnerships. Every business I’ve approached for holiday parties or events has said yes and I've sold a lot in these locations.

\- Currently in 2 smaller pet stores, with 2 more in progress (too soon to tell repeat purchases/velocity)

\- Accepted into 2 farmers markets so will start selling in person 2 days every weekend.

\- Completed fundraising deck, applied to incubation program and looking to quit full time job in Feb if I get funds I am asking for. I have a soft commitment from an investor.

I am already burnt out working 2 jobs - making the treats, sales, order fulfillment, packaging, marketing....everything it is not sustainable and I cry a lot from exhaustion.

Tbh if I don't raise as much money as I'd like I am thinking about getting a business loan - I am positive I will raise some funds but I am not sure the magnitude.

What other signals told you it was “safe enough” to quit your full-time job? Someone told me my business should be making as much as my full time job \~5,000 post taxes, insurance benefits, before I quit and to hire someone to make the treats but I still do not have enough capacity to do sales and grow as much as I'd like with this full time job for business to catch up

1pwiiyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerfitness/comments/1pwiiyz/struggling_to_grow_upper_body/,Struggling to grow upper body,"33M here, kind of a fitness newbie. Currently 6'2, 208lbs, naturally slim-ish build.

Been working out for last 1.5 years. I've seen good progress in lowerbody during this time, but I can't seem to put on any upper body gains. I've put quite a bit of effort into a few elements to improve this (details below), but no luck. This is what I do:

1. **Workouts**: 2-3 upper body workouts a week. Mix of exercises, but usually involves a bar one day a week, and mix of dumbbells and pushups for rest of week. I do still notice DOMS (especially in chest) fairly regularly. I also do 1 lower body workout per week (DOMS there as well), and like I said I have noticed some gains there.
2. **Diet:** I track everything I eat, and usually it's very similar every day. Protein varies between 190g - 220g per day. I was in an accidental calorie deficit about a year ago (before I tracked), but I've been in varying calories surpluses every since. I take creatine every day.
3. **Calories burned**: I track this via smartwatch (though skeptical of its accuracy). Average is \~3200 burned per day, though obviously varies quite a bit based on rest vs active days.
4. **Water**: Min 85oz per day, usually around 95oz. I only drink water + one coffee per day
5. **Sleep**: I track this as well. Almost always getting minimum of 7 hours
6. **Some rough numbers**: I think I'm decent at pushups (can get to 40ish in one go), but my bench press feels like it's barely changed. \~190lbs for one rep max. I just feel like chest, arms, and shoulders haven't grown/changed at all in the last year.
7. **Cardio**: I do very limited cardio. Hasn't really been my goal, but I assumed it wouldn't really help putting on upper body gains.

I've gone up and down between 200lbs and 210lbs. I am definitely able to lose fat weight very easily, but gaining lean mass has been almost impossible. Been starting to question things like genetics, which feels silly. Anyone have ideas? Happy to provide more details on anything above.",2,1766792214.0,beginnerfitness,1,0.76,False

HELP!,"My gf (19F) and I (22M) have been having a rocky past few months. For a bit of backstory, we started off amazing. I met her while snowboarding one of my favorite mountains. Things were going great, we had our first date snowboarding, and a few after that doing outdoor stuff/concerts. Got her flowers every time we hung out, and made sure to be a gentleman. Even made a charcuterie board for her and took her on a picnic date. Then out of nowhere, she ghosts me. Weeks go by and I think we’re over, when all of a sudden she texts me on Whatsapp, saying “Praying you have Whatsapp, I’m in Guatemala right now, I’ve been hiking volcanoes and staying at a hostel and getting drunk everyday.” I already knew she was crazy, but this was icing on the cake (if it matters, she’s a white girl who doesn’t speak Spanish, so her being in Guatemala was kind of insane to me.) We talk for a bit, and I felt left out, so I fly to Costa Rica for my birthday. Kinda assuming she slept with someone there, I did the same in CR. Selfish and hypocritical I know, shame on me. I thought it would make me feel better but alas, only felt worse. Fast forward a bit, and while I’m in CR I jokingly propose to her that I could fly over a country and see her. Excited, she agrees, and says I really should go visit her. So I do. Lol. 

Once we reunite, it was like love at first sight again. Being in a whole different county with a girl I really liked, what more could I ask for? It was like a honeymoon the time we were there. I tell her I want to take things more serious between us, and after some more time getting to know her, I would like her to be my gf. She agrees and says she feels the same way. She was honest about everything when I asked her about her past and what exactly happened in Guatemala. She slept with two people while she was there, one guy and one girl. (She also tells me she slept with 12 people at this point, and she was 18 years old, so take that as you will. It definitely made me feel some type of way, like I couldn’t take her THAT serious cuz of the obvious red flags. But she also had her reasonings, mostly due to trauma and losing her mom at a very young age.) I decide I can move past it, and we agree to continue talking when we get back. So we fly back on separate days (I had work and she already had a flight back) and rendezvous when we get back into the states. 

Everything is going great at this point. We have gone on a few dates, and during one of them at the hot springs, I ask her to be my gf with a poem I wrote her. (Most cheesy thing I’ve done for a girl but she was everything to me and I didn’t care lol.) Things were amazing for the first few months, as they usually are at the start of a relationship. (I’ve been in 4 serious long-term relationships before her, so I kinda have an idea of how it goes.) In my head though, I thought she wasn’t taking me that serious because of how the start of our relationship unfolded. I thought she might still be talking to or entertaining the idea of other people. So I do something similar. There was a girl I had a brief history with (a kiss and a date) who worked with me. I work at the airport and she’s a barista, so I would get coffee/food from her every once in a while since it would be free. Gf finds out, and she gets pissed, understandably. She tells me to stop, but I continue because I didn’t think it was the biggest deal to begin with (truthfully, it was nothing more than a 5 min convo while she prepped my food/coffee) and also because I assumed she was doing shady shit behind my back that whole time. She tells me she wasn’t and that she was taking me serious, but things obviously change after this. Long story short, we both begin playing games at this point. I go dancing Salsa with a home girl, she likes a few posts of a guy she used to talk to. She finds out that I watch porn, and that I was liking some girls stories (shitty and typical I know, I was an asshole and it wasn’t justified, should’ve broken it off instead of playing these games with her.) So she goes and sells a picture of her feet to some random dude on Reddit (gross as fuck lmao.) Then tells me she went on Hinge, set her location to California, and talked to only one guy, before deleting it due to feeling bad. All of this gets out 2-3 months ago, so now it’s just been rocky. 

Fast forward to present time, and I feel like sex isn’t the same. The way she views me isn’t the same. The way she loves me isn’t the same. Obviously all of that will change, but she tells me things will get better. She tells me she wants to do this more than anything, and that’s the only reason she’s stayed so long and put up with my shit(which makes sense.) She has been trying her ass off, and I can see the effort she’s been putting in. She really is trying. On the other hand though, it doesn’t feel like things are really getting better. It almost feels forced. She gets really intimate and loving after we have sex, but it kind of goes away when we don’t. Then last night, her pu**y got dry while we were having sex. First time it’s happened. For context, we have some amazing sex. Might be TMI, but I was the first to make her squirt, first to try anal with her, and first  guy to make her cum from oral. I always prioritize her orgasm before mine. Make sure to dominate and make her feel good before/during/after sex. But after last night, I’m not sure what to think anymore. Is she starting to see me different, and that’s why she got dry? The sex isn’t as intense as it used to be. It’s not as passionate either. After everything happened, it’s been rough getting back to that point. And not just with sex either, but the feeling in general that we both had when we first started dating. 

To top it all off, we planned a trip to the Philippines next week. It’s been planned for a while now, but we finalized everything a few weeks ago. Might’ve been irrational for us to book a whole trip together while we’re not exactly in the best spot, but we thought a reset could help. I know it’s possible, I’ve seen people come back from worse. But my question to you guys is: after everything that’s happened, do you guys think it’s worth trying to fix this relationship (which I do want to do), or would it be better to cut it off due to the baggage we now carry? It’ll take time for sure, but just trying to see peoples experiences/POV’s on this. ",0,1766792142.0,relationship_advice,4,0.17,False

[Budget $500 ish],"My partner is a 32 (m) who is obsessed with 3 things:

1. Perfecting his Tacoma x GFC camping setup  w/ quality gear.
2. Big objectives, Type-2 fun & outdoor adventures.
3. Really good coffee and his daily ritual.

So, I am making him an outdoor espresso / coffee kit for his birthday next month but don’t have the same coffee knowledge. I really want this gift to be a hit so I am hoping y’all can help me figure this out. His 3x siblings and parents are helping me purchase everything, so my budget is flexible but not infinite. Included more details on budget for each item below.

# The Goal & Context

I am recreating the converted Stanley lunch box set up with[ **Unito**](https://unito-store.myshopify.com/collections/all) accessories in the video attached. I just need to complete it with the right espresso machine, grinder, (potential) milk steamer and any other espresso-head accessories that are a must have.

He will use this setup out the back of his Tacoma for the most part but I know he would love to brew a freshy in the alpine while ski touring or winter camping too.

**Here's the gear I am considering (and ma**

# Portable Espresso Machines [Budget: Max $250]

**1.**[ **Outlin Mino**](https://outin.com/products/mino-portable-electric-espresso-machine) \- I defs got pulled in by Outlins ""outdoorsy"" marketing and impulse purchased the Mino today since its on sale and seemed like a great choice for versatility and performance in different weather conditions and altitudes.

Is the Mino the best option for his use outdoor use case, for an espressohead and in general as a high-quality portable machine? Or did the marketing get me? ***I can cancel my order and pivot, so please be honest!***

**2.**[ **Wacaco Pixapresso**](https://wacaco.com/products/pixapresso?variant=54407749501001&country=CA&currency=CAD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22557685190&gbraid=0AAAAADnFyJzoWt7Os2-ndR6FJ1zvtQ8Ks&gclid=Cj0KCQiAgbnKBhDgARIsAGCDdldecbbsY8xxYTJ5gXrfhMZrLiw4h1EShzqL6wazwOOEpJ5TEn4-2bAaAg65EALw_wcB) **-** This seems like another great option with decent reviews! I like that it has more customizations/brewing options and a much larger water tank. Its also more affordable.

**3.**[  **Flair GO**](https://flairespresso.com/products/espresso-makers/flair-go/) **-** The GOAT portable machine according to Youtube. Doesn't have the same diversity of use as the electric but I am down to pivot if this is the must have for quality.

# Portable Grinders [Budget: Max $200]

**1.**[ **Outlin Fino Electric Grinder**](https://outin.com/products/fino-portable-electric-coffee-grinder)**:** Almost purchased but decided to hold off because it feels expensive for what you get BUT my parter does love a seamless, functional system. Thoughts?

**2.**[ **NUTTII OX Portable Electric Grinder Pro**](https://eightouncecoffee.ca/products/nuttii-ox-portable-electronic-grinder?variant=41574510166110)**:** This one seems great and is more affordable.

**3.**[ **Wacaco Exagrind Manual Grinder**](https://wacaco.com/products/exagrind?_pos=1&_sid=68c3ef399&_ss=r)**:** No notes. Is what it is!

# Milk Steamers [Budget: Not sure yet. Depends if its worth it!]

I know he would prefer to steam his milk manually vs. using an electric frother. So the internet told me these are my two best options for stove top. Looking for opinions and if there is anything else I should consider. This would be a tacoma camping only piece of the kit.

**1.**[ **Bellman Stovetop Frother**](https://terracaf.ca/products/bellman-stove-top-milk-frother-cx-25s?srsltid=AfmBOoqEhC699Bs8hxEPrsblrlppm3ZnI65-02Gs5-xmJNjIU4VNElLd) **-** The OG! Decent price, but shes really big.

**2.**[ **Flair Stovetop Steamer**](https://flairespresso.com/product/flair-wizard-steamer/) **-** Taking the lead as new king!

# Accessories

I really like how the Outlin machines and accessories are modular. If I go that route, I think i'll get the collapsable stand and maybe the scale? Is the scale really necessary? and are there any other accessories I should consider purchasing? Open to other brands / hacks that can help me cut the cost a bit.

Thanks so much for helping me build his dream birthday present! Can't wait to get this kit together and see his reaction 🥰

I’d felt suffocated for months, drowning in their small-town life, and I just couldn't breathe. I don't remember the exact words I threw at them, but I know I wanted it to hurt. I remember the look on my mother’s face, like I’d physically struck her. My dad stood there, silent and stony, watching me pack my bag and scolding me for ‘talking to my mother like that’.

I slammed the front door so hard the stained glass rattled in the frame. I got in my car, blinded by rage and falling snow, and I drove away.

I hadn't spoken to them since. Months of stubborn silence. But standing at the end of the driveway now, looking up at the house, that anger felt old. Distant. Like it belonged to a different person.

All I felt now was the cold.

The truth was, I had nowhere else to go, and I couldn’t imagine spending Christmas anywhere else but home. I’d been stubborn, and if they were angry, I’d deal with it. I really needed to make things right, and I hoped they'd be happy to see me.

The cold was bitter, bypassing my coat and settling deep into my chest the moment I got out of the car. The house looked inviting, though. The bay window was glowing with that familiar orange warmth, and the Christmas tree lights blurred slightly behind the frosted glass. 

I wasn't the only one watching the house. 

Felix, our old tabby cat, was sitting on the low brick wall that lined the garden. His black-and-grey fur was puffed up against the chill.  His yellow eyes wide and unblinking, tracked my journey up the path. He trotted over to me and rubbed his body on my leg. 

“Well hello there stranger,” I said, squatting down to stroke the spine of his back. 

The front door opened with a heavy creak that vibrated in the quiet air.

Dad stepped onto the porch.

The sight of him knocked the air out of me. He looked older than I remembered. Worse. His skin was a dull, flat grey, like wet newspaper and he was wrapped in a thick woollen cardigan that seemed to drown him, hanging in loose folds off his shoulders. He looked gaunt, like he'd been eroding; the substance of him being slowly scooped out from the inside, leaving just the skin.

He hugged his arms around his chest, shivering as he looked down.

His expression softened and confused, but his eyes were glassy; filmed over?

“You’re back,” he whispered, relief in his voice.

I let out the breath I'd been holding. *He wasn't angry.*

“I’m back, Dad,” I said, my voice cracking. “I... I wanted to come home.”

Dad shook his head, a small, sad smile touched his lips.

“Come on in then, you daft thing,” he muttered, shivering. “I suppose you’ll want feeding.”

He turned, holding the door open. I stood up, my legs stiff and heavy, and followed Felix inside.

Dad closed the door, he leaned his forehead against the wood for a second closing his eyes, looking exhausted. Drained.

“You’ve been gone a while,” he murmured.

“I know,” I replied. “I’m sorry.”

I removed my coat and reached for the empty hook by the door, but stopped. It didn't feel any warmer inside. The chill still engulfed me, so I pulled my hand back and put my coat back on.

Dad shuffled down the hallway, his slippers dragged against the floorboards with a slow, rhythmic rasp, like sandpaper on wood.

I followed, the hallway feeling narrower than I remembered. I glanced at the gallery wall, filled with school photos, holiday snaps, the graduation portrait I hated. Mum used to dust these every Sunday like clockwork, but now, a thick, grey film coated the glass, blurring our faces and our smiles. On the telephone table, a tower of envelopes sat unopened. Bills. Flyers. The stack was messy, sliding sideways, and a red ""Final Notice"" poked out from the chaotic heap. 

This didn't make sense. Mum was militant about organisation. Seeing that mess... I felt like I'd walked into the wrong house.

The kitchen air felt thick, but not with the inviting warmth a Christmas kitchen usually permeates., this just felt…thick. Dense. The smell of roasting turkey and sage was there, but underneath it, there was something else. Something off. Like stagnant water, or damp.

Dad moved to the fridge. The light inside flickered as he pulled the door open. Mum stood at the sink, her back to the room, facing the dark window. She was peeling a potato, her movement slow and lethargic.

""Look who showed up,"" Dad whispered with forced cheeriness, staring into the bright, humming interior of the fridge.

I leaned against the counter, crossing my arms. Dad looked worse in the harsh light of the kitchen, his skin translucent and waxy. Mum’s shoulders were hunched, and rigid. She held herself with a brittle stiffness. 

She paused briefly, whispering ""Oh that's nice, love,"" before continuing with her rhythmic peeling.

Dad moved to the small wooden table and collapsed into his chair, his eyes fixed on the salt shaker in the centre of the table as his thumb traced the grain of the wood.

*Something is wrong here.*

The house was freezing, Dad had lost a scary amount of weight, and Mum... she just said 'that's nice, love'? My fiery, loud mother, just... whispering? This wasn't like my parents. 

Dad cut through my panic.

""Do you remember that time we all went to the fair?"" Dad said, his voice quiet.

I forced my brain to switch tracks, digging through childhood memories to find the image he was looking for. 

""On Yardly Park?"" I asked.

The corner of Dad's mouth slowly turned upwards, just slightly. ""The one on Yardly Park.""

""Yeah,"" I said, a small, tired smile touching my face. ""I remember.""

""We got there,"" Dad continued, his eyes still fixed on the shaker. ""We’d gone on a few rides. But it was getting late, and we needed to go home.""

He went quiet, looking down at his hands and watching them tremble.

The guilt prickled at me, sharp and familiar.

""I decided I didn't want to go,"" I said. ""I ran over to the funhouse.""

Mum’s hand stopped moving. She gripped the edge of the porcelain sink, her knuckles white, the skin pulled tight.

""We looked for over an hour,"" she whispered to the window. ""I was so scared.""

""I was a git, I know,"" I said. ""I remember you grounded me for two weeks. I was so mad at you.""

Mum let out a shaky breath. ""I was so angry.""

Dad looked up then. He looked at Mum’s rigid back.

""To his face you were,"" he said softly. ""But when he wasn't looking, you were just relieved. You kept thinking of things to do together once he’d finished his grounding.""

The room seemed to warp at the edges.

""I never knew that,"" I said, looking at Mum. ""I thought you were just... angry.""

Dad smiled, a sad, thin thing. ""You couldn't stay angry for long though, could you?""

Mum shook her head. She wiped her cheek with the back of her wet hand.

""I couldn't,"" she whispered. ""I never could.”

The moment held for a heartbeat, then shattered. 

Dad’s eyes dropped back to the salt shaker, his thumb resumed its work. Mum turned back to the window, and the knife found the potato. It happened so fast. The life that had flickered in their faces vanished, replaced by a gloomy grey vacancy. It was like watching a machine reset. 

A cold dread settled in my gut. This felt forced and unnatural, like a heavy curtain had dropped back down, cutting them off from me.

I had to get out of this room. I could feel my eyes start to well. 

""I’m going to wash up,"" I said quickly, trying to keep my voice level. I didn't wait for an answer, I turned and walked out.

The damp smell followed me through the hallway and up the stairs, the banister a frozen ribbon of ice beneath my hand. As I turned toward the bathroom at the top of the  stairs, I saw the door closed and the light turned on, and underneath the door, a shadow danced back and forth.

*Was someone in the bathroom?*

My heart quickened as I drifted toward the closed door. 

*Surely Dad would have mentioned someone being here?*

The door handle started to turn. I stopped, watching its slow rotation.

*Someone is in there.*

The handle stopped dead.

*Shit.*

My eyes scanned the landing for something, anything, to grab. Nothing.

*Fuck.*

The door jerked open, and I stepped back, my body tense, and my breathing unsteady.

""Hello, Charlie.""

A woman stood in the doorway. She was petite, with bright eyes and cheeks that flushed with a healthy, vibrant colour; a stark, violent contrast to the grey, waxy pallor of my parents downstairs. She wore a neat blouse and a cardigan that looked freshly laundered. A cloying scent of floral soap wafted off her.

She beamed at me. A bright, bubbly smile that felt piercing in the gloom of the landing.

I stepped back against the banister.

“Hello?"" I said.

She clasped her hands together, tilting her head. ""I wondered when you'd get here.""

""I'm here,"" I said, my voice thick with confusion.

""Yes, you are.” She stared at me, her smile fixed. 

An awkward, heavy pause stretched between us. She didn't blink enough. She seemed too comfortable, too at home in this freezing, decaying hallway.

""Sorry,"" I said, straightening up. ""Who are you?""

""I'm a friend of your parents,"" she said, her tone breezy. ""I've been looking after them while you've been away.""

I thought of Dad’s hollowed-out face, Mum’s lethargic peeling, the dust on the photos, and the unopened bills.

""Looking after them?"" I repeated.

She smiled and nodded, eager, like a puppy waiting for a treat.

""How?"" I asked. The word came out sharper than I intended. I looked around the landing. The wallpaper was peeling. The air smelled of damp. 

*Looking after them how? They look like shit. The house looks like shit.*

""Little things,"" she said.

""Little things?""

She smiled again. Another nod.

The anger flared in my chest. 

""What little things?"" I asked through gritted teeth.

She just smiled.

*Smug little…*

""I've been here for them while you've been away, Charlie,"" she said softly.

Well that hurt. It hit me like a physical blow in the stomach. The guilt I’d been suppressing surged up, twisting into defensive rage.

I looked at her, really looked at her. She was too clean. Too happy.

*A fucking scammer.*

The realisation sunk in. She was one of those people who preyed on the elderly. Worming her way in and isolating them, letting them rot while she slowly siphoned off their savings, waiting for them to die so she could clear them out. That’s why the heating was off. That’s why they were starving.

""I'm back now,"" I said. I made my voice hard. A warning.

Her smile didn't falter, but her eyes seemed to drill into me.

""Are you?"" she asked.

“Yes."" I said.

""For how long?""

""For however long I'm needed.""

Her expression shifted, and I saw a flicker of something else, pity, maybe? Or annoyance?

""OK, Charlie,"" she said. ""But I hope it's not too long.""

She stepped past me and a wave of cool air followed her. She walked to the stairs and began to descend, her hand trailing lightly over the banister.

I watched her go, my heart pounding. That felt like a threat. I was a problem. She knew I’d disrupt whatever long-con she was running on my parents.

I looked back at the open bathroom door, then down the dark stairwell where she had disappeared.

*This is all my fault.*

The tears fell, and the world became watery and indistinct. I ran to the bathroom and gripped the cold porcelain of the basin until my knuckles ached. I looked up into the mirror, expecting to see my own red-rimmed eyes, instead, I saw a grey, blurry mess. I tried wiping the tears away with the back of my hand, but they kept coming, my reflection still smudged and distorted.

I squeezed my eyes shut.

*I bet I look like shit.*

I splashed water on my face and dried it with a towel musty smelling towel.

*I had to face this. I had to fix this.*

I reached for the door, but in my haste, I fumbled and missed the handle. I stared at my shaking fingers.

*Get a grip.*

I focused, steadying my hand, and opened the door.

The hallway was dark. My parents' bedroom door stood ajar at the end of the hall. From inside, the quiet sobs of my Mum drifted onto the landing.

I slowed my pace and hovered at the doorway.

My mum sat on the edge of the bed with her back to the door, a tissue balled in her hand. I could see her shoulders shaking, hear the wet, stifled catch of her breath as she tried to hold it in.

“Mum?” I whispered, not wanting to make her jump.

She let out a deep, shuddering sigh. She straightened her spine, dabbing the corner of her eye with her tissue. 

“I’m fine,” she whispered.

“You don't seem fine, Mum.”

A small, quiet sob escaped her. She shrank further into herself, pulling her arms tight around her waist.

“You left us,” she choked out. “If you’d just stayed, we’d be fine. We’d all be fine.”

The light in the room seemed to dim. A shadow passed over the bulb, and a sudden, sharp chill washed over me, raising the hair on my arms.

“I know, Mum. I’m sorry.”

I took a small step forward. I wanted to hug her. To comfort her. I wanted to tell her that if I could go back in time, I would. That I wouldn't have left. I wouldn't have stayed away.

But I didn’t say any of that. The words stuck in my throat.

If I'd have known. If I'd have just… The guilt twisted in my gut. All they ever did was love me, and I left the door wide open for some fucking scammer to walk in and do this to them. I abandoned them, and a predator walked right into the void I left behind.

She just sat there. Crying. Quietly.

I looked around the room. The fire that had filled this house was gone. The light, gone. The life... gone.

I stood there, helpless, watching her cry.

“My heart feels broken,” she whispered.

I took another step toward her, wanting to reach out and comfort her, but my eyes were drawn to the sideboard to the right of where she sat.

I remembered it was usually bare, just a coaster and a lamp. Mum didn't like what she called 'tat' on show, but now it was crowded, a collection of items arranged in a circle of unlit tea lights, and in the centre, a smooth, dark grey stone. Some sort of large beach pebble, polished by the sea. It looked like a shrine. Or some sort of altar.   

I moved closer, drawn by a sick curiosity.

There were photos propped up against the stone. A copy of my graduation photo and a shot of us at the beach, but they had been defaced. The glossy paper was torn and white where my face used to be. Scratched out. Erased with violent, frantic strokes of a needle or a knife.

What the hell was that woman doing?

Next to the photos lay a scrap of paper. The handwriting was jagged and unfamiliar.

*Our journey is done. Let the wandering cease. Bind our memories to the dark.*

""What is this?"" I asked, my voice rising in panic. ""What the hell is this?""

I turned to look at Mum.

She stood up from the bed and moved slowly toward the sideboard.

""And who is that woman?"" I demanded, pointing out to the hall. “Is she making you do this?""

Mum took a deep, shuddering breath and closed her eyes.

""This is my hope for you,"" she whispered, placing her hand on the black stone. She leaned in, her lips moving in a silent, frantic rhythm.

I stared at her.

“You’re not religious?” I questioned, confusion taking over. 

She continued to whisper.

*I couldn't watch her do this.*

I reached out to grab her hand. I needed answers. I needed to know what the hell was going on.

""Mum, stop!”

My fingers brushed against the back of her hand, the side of my palm grazing the black stone.

The reaction was instant. Violent.

A piercing headache drove a spike through my left temple, then a physical shockwave, and screeching static that engulfed the room. My vision blurred. The floor seemed to tilt aggressively to the left.

I fell to my knees, clutching my head.

Mum didn't flinch. She kept her hand on the stone, whispering into the dark.

""Stop,"" I pled.

The darkness rushed in from the edges of my vision. Heavy and suffocating. I hit the floor, and the world went black.



I felt numb.  
  
My eyes flicked open to the dim amber light of the living room. I was sitting in the high-backed armchair by the fire, my head lolling against the wing.

I tried to stand up, but I couldn’t move. 

My limbs felt like lead. Disconnected and lost.

""Hello, Charlie.""

The woman breezed into the room. She looked even fresher now, her cheeks rosy, her blouse crisp. She held herself with an infuriating, bouncy energy that made the grey stillness of the room feel even deadlier.

""What did you do to me?"" I rasped.

""I think you got a bit overwhelmed,"" she said, clasping her hands.

I tried to lunge at her, but I just twitched in my chair. The panic spiked.

""Your doing something to them!"" I blurted out.

The woman smiled. ""I hope so!""

*She’s a monster. A sick twisted monster.*

  
I willed my arms to rise, or my legs to lift me, but I was frozen in place.  
""Why can't I move?""

She sighed.

Felix trotted into the room. He looked at me, gave a soft *chirrup*, and jumped up onto my lap. He circled once, kneading my paralysed legs with his claws, and settled down, purring against my chest. The weight of him was the only thing anchoring me to the room.

The door creaked and dad walked in.

""Dinner's nearly ready,"" the woman chirped.

Dad stared at the unlit fireplace. ""Dinner's nearly ready,"" he repeated. His voice was hollow and monotone.

He walked over to the drinks cabinet. Glass clinked against wood.

""Dad!"" I whimpered. The sound was small, pathetic. ""Dad, look at me.""

He grabbed a bottle of scotch and two heavy crystal tumblers and walked over to the small coffee table in front of me.

He put one glass down in front of himself, and another in front of me.

He poured a measure into his glass, then he poured a measure into mine. The amber liquid splashed against the crystal.

""One for you, son,"" he whispered.

He lifted his glass, tapped it against the rim of my glass, a lonely, singular chime in the quiet room, and then downed his drink in one swallow.

I stared at him. I saw the gaunt, grey skin of his neck. The way his collar hung loose. A tear leaked out of my eye and tracked hot down my frozen cheek.

""Please let them go,"" I whispered to the woman. Defeated.

She stood by the door, watching us.

""I can't,"" she said softly.

""Why?""

""Dinner's Ready.” Mum’s voice drifted from the dining room. It wasn't the voice I remembered. It was tired. Reedy.

I watched Dad slowly push himself up from the chair. He looked at my full glass of whisky for a second, shook his head, before he turned and shuffled out of the room.

""You coming?"" the woman asked.

""I can't mov…”

I flinched and my hand jerked off the armrest.

The paralysis vanished as quickly as it had come. The weight had lifted.

I pushed Felix gently off my lap and scrambled to my feet, my legs shaky.

I stumbled out of the living room and into the hallway. It stretched ahead. I passed the gallery wall again, forcing myself to look at the photos. My parents, younger, standing on a pier, squinting into the sun. Smiling.

I remembered the argument. I remembered the heat of it. The way I’d thrown words like stones, intending to hurt. *I can’t even remember what it was about.* 

I wished I’d just shut my mouth. All they’ve ever done is love me, and I’d repaid them with silence.

*I fucking hate myself.*

I reached the dining room door, the smell of the turkey was overwhelming.

I stepped inside.

Mum and Dad were seated at the table. The candles were lit, casting long, flickering shadows against the walls. They’re plates opposite each other, Dad was just taking his seat at the table. 

I moved closer.

There were only two places set. Two plates. Two knives. Two forks.

I looked at the empty space where I would normally sit. The wood was bare. No mat. No glass. No plate.

The woman lurked in the doorway behind me, silent.

*Only two places?*

""Mum?""

Tears were streaming down Mum’s face. They dripped off her chin, landing silently on her plate. Slowly, in perfect unison, my parents turned their heads. They picked up their wine glasses, held them up, toasting the empty air where I should have been sitting.

""Cheers to you, Son,"" Dad whispered, his voice breaking. ""We miss you every day.""



The words hung in the air.

""I'm here,"" I choked out. ""I'm right here.""

I slammed my hand down on the table, but there was no sound. No rattle of cutlery. No thud of flesh against wood. My hand passed straight through the mahogany as if it were smoke.

I stared at my hand.

The smell of turkey and sage vanished, replaced instantly by the smell of wet earth and diesel.

The ""damp"" smell I’d been tracking through the house. It wasn't the house. It was me.

""No,"" I whispered.

The woman stepped out of the shadows, her smile giving way to a solemn, gentle expression.

“Your journey is done,"" she whispered, repeating the words from the note. ""Let the wandering cease.""

My eyes wandered to the space next to Mum. On the table lay a photo. My graduation photo. Mum, Dad… and me. Smiling.

""I drove away,"" I whispered, closing my eyes. 

The headlights cutting through the white. The rage screaming in my ears.

Then, the cold.

The deep, bone-crushing cold.

""How long?"" I whispered, opening my eyes.

""A while,"" the woman said softly.

I looked at my parents. Dad's arm wrapped around Mum, their eyes glassy, their frames so frail. 

I’d missed so much.

""Please,"" I said to the woman, my voice fading. ""Look after them.""

She nodded. ""I will.""

I looked back at my parents one last time. I wanted to stay. I wanted to scream that I was sorry, that I loved them, that I hadn't meant a word of what I said that night.

I'd... I'd never get the chance now.

I felt the cold lifting. The heavy, dragging weight in my limbs dissolving into light.

""I love you,"" I whispered.

Mum smiled, just a little, as if she had caught a drift of familiar scent in the air.

The candlelight flared. The room blurred. The grey static rushed in, but it wasn't terrifying this time; I didn't fight it.

I closed my eyes and let it take me.

I’m 26F and recently I’ve had nothing to look forward to. Life feels miserable when there’s nothing you wake up for in the morning. I have a job (which I hate but can’t find another to quit), I don’t make much money but it’s just ok to exist and go on some trips if I save up. I’m single (like some guy that doesn’t like me back, at least not enough for LDR), I don’t have many close friends and currently no hobbies at all. There’s nothing to do where I live except go get some tasteless coffee (I can’t even find the type I like here). 

I enjoy(ed?) traveling but lately, I’m sad and even when I travel it just travels with me. I’m less miserable when traveling but still, not happy. I can’t travel for another 8 months cause I have no money. Same thing with concerts. 

It’s hard to keep going when there’s 0 reasons to. When I feel super sad I just go to sleep so I don’t have to “feel” it. I wake up and redo it. So yea, life pretty much sucks and I don’t know how much longer one keeps going like this.

I’m sorry if this is not the right place to ask. I don’t have enough karma to post in r/AskAnAmerican yet.
For context: I am an immigrant, 23 years old, and I’ve taken 2 driving lessons so far (3 hours total) with a driving instructor. He told me I only need 2 more lessons (another 4 hours), and then I can take the driving test next week, meaning I’ll have about 7 hours of driving practice before the exam.
I am so scared. I have not been able to make correct turns at all. I’m afraid I could be a danger on the road. My instructor charged me $600 for about 7 hours. He said if I want to practice more with him, I’ll have to pay extra. I want more practice, but I can’t afford it, it would get too expensive.
I just finished my second lesson today and am literally crying while typing this. I made many mistakes like hitting the curb, or turning too wide ending up on the opposite lane (and it’s dangerous because it’s a two-way street). He got very angry, yelled at me, asked me what’s in my head. I understand that he has a stressful job and he was afraid I would damage his car. I tried very hard not to cry during the lesson. And he’s the one who monitors my driving exam so I guess I will pass anyways, I don’t know how it works. I just have a hunch because he is decisive in having me taking the driving exam next week. While a driver license is extremely important to me, I am 100% sure I would hurt something, someone and I don’t want that at all. But I honestly cannot pay more for extra hours. 
I know many people have parents or friends who can sit with them and help them practice outside of lessons. But I have no one. After 7 hours, I will literally be alone on the road and that’s terrifying. Is taking the driving test after 7 hours considered normal in America? Or am I just like, slow in the head? I feel like I am going to need like hundreds of hours before I take the test. The sizes of the streets vary. There are wide streets, narrow streets, light turns, sharp turns, like, it’s not always 90 degrees turn, there is not a fixed formula, I don’t know if you guys feel what I feel. Like, it’s different every time. I also find it very hard to look behind to check for blind spots fast before I get to the only lane left turn. It’s 1 second but I also need to watch out for cars ahead because the red light is close, I might hit cars ahead while looking back. I don’t know if you guys understand what I describe but one thing for sure, I am not good after 7 hours. 
So, this sounds silly but are there like any volunteer services where they help practicing driving for free? 
I cannot knock on every door and ask my neighbors because I would look like a scammer. Or can anyone who currently by chance, have free time to help me? I am in Cypress Green. I am poor but I will like, buy you coffees. I know I am a total stranger on Internet but I really don’t know where to ask. Any advice would be appreciated!

I just got the Zigaat Odyssey for Christmas. Super excited about it and I am really loving the sound of them. I am using the stock tips they come with which have super tight bass response and not much sibilance in the highs. 

I am specifically looking for some peoples ear tip recommendations that have had these iems before.

I have tried the following tips on them:

Spinfit W145 - Felt like it took a lot of base away and wasnt as stable

Stock - Favorite sound, horrible comfort. Tight base, managed highs, little sibilance

KB Ears Coffee (brown) - Sounds good but muddies the bass a bit and makes it feel boomy. Most comfortable so far.

Tang Sancai Wide Bore - Pretty comfy but lets too much treble sibilance through.

  
I have the following tips coming in the mail:

Dunu S&S

Penon Liquor Tips Orange

KB Ear 07

TRI Clarion

  
I checked out the Divinus Velvet and they are a bit pricey. If people think they are ideal on these then I am open to trying those as well.

  
Any recommendations from the community? Thanks!

Last year I joined gym and lost around 4-5kg apart from water weight but due to listening to trainers and few others reasons, I quit after few months.

Right now I want to lose as much fat as I can in 60-90 days before I take a pause (will maintain diet) as I will be having exams around march-april.

I have calculated my maintenance calories which come down to approx 3,000 and I have been recommended to cut them by 800-100.

Diet plan that I have made according to my routine is:

Breakfast: Black coffee/black tea with few nuts and 1-2 khajoor

Lunch: 2 eggs, half chappati and some home made salan

Pre workout: Black coffee

Snack: Fruits like apple, guava, orange 

Dinner: 2 eggs, steak or meat in any form

Apart from this, I have made a commitment to quit soft drinks etc, drink lots of water and try my best to walk 10k steps daily.

As for workout, I will try my best to hit the gym 3-4x a week and will primarily focus on strength training by using machines like chest press, shoulder press, pectoral fly etc.

I’d like someone to help me by telling other DOs and DONTs, along with guiding that what can I improve in this plan for better results. Thank you",1,1766791256.0,Fitness_Pakistan,1,1.0,False

I’m stuck in programming (mostly with C++, but this probably applies to other languages too). I know the basics, I can write code if given a problem, make my own data types, use templates, constructors, and so on. But I don’t know how to take the next step.

Right now, I’m trapped in this mindset of “do everything exactly by the book, exactly how professors say it.” I want to move past that and actually use what I know to build projects and deepen my understanding. But I have no idea where to start.

How do I learn to tell if my code is good or bad? How do I know if I’m building a project the right way? Is it okay to Google solutions, or do I have to figure everything out by myself step-by-step? How do I break out of this “memorize every little detail perfectly” mode? Basically, how do I become the “basic programming nerd” you see in movies, confident and creative with code?

If anyone has advice on how to level up and start creating projects that actually teach me, I’d be so grateful. I’ll even buy you a coffee! 😮‍💨",2,1766791173.0,AskProgrammers,7,1.0,False

1pwi4ew,https://www.reddit.com/r/Deja_Vu/comments/1pwi4ew/my_deja_vu_theory/,My Deja Vu Theory,"Could Deja Vu be caused by processing something inherently known? Or as an instinct as such, here’s my take.

The universe is expanding at a faster rate than it was before and so forth which leads us to conclude we’ve been scaling up as time moves and why there could have been a big bang initially.

But what if this always happens? Over and over. Forever. 14.7 billion years is just the current 14.7 billion years. This whole cycle restarts and every star, person and atom all fall into the same place.

When you drip milk into a coffee it creates chaos that could never be produced in the same way again. As much as it looks chaotic it was always going to swirl in a certain way and this leads me to the Deja Vu theory.

I don’t believe we could have parallel universes and timelines this just spirals with the sheer amount of decisions humans make but I do believe can retain information as it ‘births’ into the next universe. Albeit the same one?

Deja Vu is a memory but it didn’t happen before. It happens at the same time every universe.

I would love to get to know you!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm shadow\_surf. Imagine if this was my real name. Maybe then people wouldn't butcher it like they do with my real name lol. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one special someone that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in a real, genuine connection and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of meeting a long term partner, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring person. An individual that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in that special someone. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is ready to make it work with a guy named shadow\_surf haha.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a partner?

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* Loyal, trusting, and honest
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

For a moment I debated simply curling up in the blankets of my bed and going back to sleep. I knew that was a futile effort, however. I had grown far too accustomed to the rhythm of life on Earth.  
  
With a groan, I pulled myself out of the bed and down onto the floor. I could feel the fuzzy fabric of the carpet scratch at my scales, as I crossed my legs and went into my prayer. It felt odd offering prayer to the ancestors with the rise of the sun, rather than at its setting. Still, tradition required a prayer at the opening of one’s day, whenever it may start.  
  
“Hallowed ancestors,” I began, “those who have stepped beyond the gates of death, and dwell in eternal happiness in the halls of your forebears, hear my prayer. Thank you for your love and for your wisdom. Thank you for the spark of life, passed from one generation to the next. I pray this day for your blessing. May you look favorably upon my path. May my sweet Isif and Azna never again feel the burdens of this world…”  
  
I paused, collecting myself, as I felt the tears of despair begin to chew their way out. I took a deep breath, letting my sorrow rush over me like a raging river. It hadn’t been easy to suppress that pain, ever since I awoke from the Archives. Up until now, I had my roommates nearby to help distract me from it. Now? With this empty, silent house, the sadness felt much closer. More urgent. After a moment, the agonizing sorrow passed, and I felt myself return to a state of calm. I let my breath out, centering myself.  
  
“May they feast unending with our ancestors. Bless Chief Hunter Isif with your wisdom and your strength. May he drive his claws into the heart of Betterment.” I paused once more, feeling my tears streaming down my face, despite my best attempts. “Please… may he free our people from this monstrous existence.”  
  
I choked, chiding myself for letting my emotions get the better of me. Still, it was hard to fight back the tsunami of feelings in my prayers.  
  
“Bless Arthur and Jammek. Bless Mixsel. May your wisdom and courage touch them. Isif and Azna, may your blessings be upon your descendents…” I paused, the fact that they wouldn’t have any descendents fell upon me like a terrible, unbearable weight. I didn’t want them to have descendents. I didn’t want to think my brave Isif and innocent little Azna living with Betterment was even a possibility. Isif and I had discussed what we would do if Betterment made its foul way to our island home. I trusted he would have carried through. I pushed on, forcing my rising emotions to the side, where they belonged.  
  
“May the followers of Betterment walk endlessly through the Desolation.” I hissed, thinking of those monsters, imagining them gleefully torturing aliens and their own people alike, “May they never sit at the tables of their ancestors.” I finished, fighting back a final gush of desperate, biting sadness. Then, for a long moment, I simply sat there in the dark of my room. 

I wanted to crawl under a rock at that moment. Hide myself away and just die. I wouldn’t do that though. To give up on the gift of life, would be to spit on their memory. So I sat there, festering in my own feelings of loss. I finally heaved out a heavy sigh, realizing that just sitting here would give me nothing to take my mind off of it.

Using every ounce of willpower I had left, I pulled myself to my feet, grabbed my pad from its charger and opened the door. The rest of the house was quite bright and my eyes took a second to adjust. Once I could see properly, I walked downstairs, making my way to the kitchen. Opening the freezer, I spied a pack of those spiced sausages that Arthur had fixed for breakfast. Pulling them out and tossing one into my mouth, I grimaced. It didn’t taste the same when it wasn’t cooked. The plant matter that was used to spice it was much more obvious in this state and far from appealing.

I turned my eyes to the stove. I had never cooked meat before, aside from drying it and smoking it. It had never been something I had even considered. Up until meeting the humans I would have considered burning meat to be a waste. I wracked my brain, trying to recall what Arthur had done. It took a moment, but I finally got a fairly good picture of it in my mind and grabbed a pan from where it hung above the stove. Setting it atop one of the burners, I turned the little knob and waited for the tiny click that it made.

A second later, I heard the click and saw flames race up to lick at the bottom of the pan. I began to take the sausages out of the package and load them into the pan, before suddenly remembering something. Didn’t I see Arthur use some sort of thick, oily substance on the bottom of the pan? I could already see the small container of golden liquid sitting off to the side. I knew I’d seen him use it before… but had he used it with this? I debated a moment, before finally deciding to pour a little of the liquid into the bottom of the pan. With that done, I dropped a few of the sausages in. I had decided to cook only a few at first, just to be certain that I was doing this correctly.

Next came yet another hurdle. How long had Arthur left them there? I could recall him flipping them after a bit, but the timing was a complete blur to me. I waited and watched as the oil in the pan began to sizzle, a bit of it starting to leap out and land on the stovetop. The flying oil began to quickly become a problem. Perhaps it was time to turn them over? I reached into a nearby drawer, grabbing one of the flat, plastic, cooking tools that Arthur used. Sticking it into the pan, I attempted to grab the handful of sausages in one go. My efforts quickly turned disastrous though, as a large wave of oil and grease went spilling over the side of the pan and into the fire below. 

Suddenly the flames leapt up, startling me enough to make me drop my cooking tool and jump back. Now the bubbling liquid in the pan was burning too, making the whole kitchen quickly fill with smoke. I removed the pan and hurriedly moved it over to an ulit burner, before opening the kitchen window and door to let some of the smoke out. That could have certainly gone better. I silently cursed myself for not having tried to learn something from Arthur before he left. With a defeated sigh, I moved back to the stove and turned the burner off. The fire in the pan had dissipated by now, but the sausage in there looked more like charcoal than it did meat.

This wasn’t going well, and I didn’t wish to ruin the remaining sausages. A new approach was in order. I walked to the front door, grabbing my goggles and heading outside. A quick march down the street and I was knocking on Shuyi’s door. To my delight, it was the Human herself who answered.

“Good morning Izra!” She greeted me with a smile, “If you’re looking for Onio, he’s out at the minute.”

“Actually it was you I came to see.” I announced, “I wished to request your help.” She cocked her head at that, looking up at me curiously.

“With **what** exactly?”

“I would request for you to help me cook something.” I explained, “I failed to learn from Arthur before he left and the tiny breakfast sausages do not taste the same frozen.” The woman let out a laugh at that, adjusting the collar on her pelt.

“Sure thing Izra.” She answered, quickly putting her shoes on, “I can show you how to do it.” The Human happily followed me back to my house and into the kitchen. Almost immediately, she began to cough.

“Judging by the smoke in here,” She laughed, “I’m assuming you already attempted it and it didn’t go so well?”

“Indeed.” I replied, gesturing towards the burnt cinders laying in the pan. The Human reached over, picking the pan up and examining the charred remains of my initial attempt.

“Did you put oil in this?” She asked, shaking her head, “You don’t need oil with sausage. They make enough grease as is. At least you didn’t try to put it out in the sink. That would have been disastrous."" The Human promptly emptied the ruined sausages and remaining oil into the trash, taking more out of the package and putting them into the pan.

“So just put the sausage in by itself,” Shuyi instructed, “Turn the stovetop to medium heat, then just give them about five to six minutes on each side. You can use your holopad to time it if you aren’t certain.”

“I appreciate your aid.” I replied simply, making a mental note of her instructions, “You also mentioned Onio was out? Where did the Harchen go, so early in the morning?”

“He said he needed more painting supplies.” The woman answered, shooting me a curious glance, “Mentioned stopping to see Veryn as well.”

“Veryn?” I repeated uncertainly, “Why did he need to see her?”

“I believe he had some questions about Arxur culture, if I remember correctly?” She mused, scratching her forehead with one finger, “While we’re on the subject of Onio, is it true he got into a fight with someone in camp yesterday?”

“It is.” I explained, “We were out walking when a Yulpa tried to challenge me to a fight.”

“Not sure what a Yulpa is,” Shuyi laughed, “but I’m struggling to picture Onio fighting *anything*.”

“He’s much more competent than people seem to be willing to give him credit for.” I huffed defensively.

“Is that admiration I detect in your voice?” She asked teasingly, using the flat cooking tool to move the sausages around as she spoke.

“It is.” I said confidently, “I’ve begun to take his offering of courtship more seriously.”

“Really?” She responded with a smile, “I’m glad to hear that. The little guy’s pretty smitten with you. He tried writing poetry for you, there for a minute. They… weren’t very good. He’s much better at painting.”

“Oh?” I inquired, intrigued at what that implied.

“Oh yeah.” She continued, “I’m sure he’ll show you when he’s ready. Any news from Arthur and Jammek?”

“I attempted to call them last evening.” I hissed, waving a claw dismissively, “They were preoccupied with something. Jammek said he would call me back today.”



**Memory Transcription Subject:** Veryn, Confused Arxur

**Date: \[Standardized Human Time\]:** February 5, 2137



“You want to talk to **me**?” I repeated uncertainly, looking across the couch at the tiny Harchen man. He seemed completely at ease, even returning my question with a friendly wave of his tail.  
  
“Indeed!” He exclaimed in his odd accent, “I have several questions about Arxur culture and, alas, the internet has proven to be a poor source of information.  
  
“I… I can try and answer… at least the parts I know.” I replied sheepishly, “But Betterment had already begun wiping out as much of any other culture as they could by the time I was taken.”  
  
“Any questions you could answer would be invaluable.” He assured me, “I suppose my first question would be about that instrument you’re learning to play? The Zorathan? Is that a very common instrument for your people?”  
  
“Not at all.” I said decisively, “A Zorathan was extremely difficult to make and cost a great deal. Not that these things we’re playing on are actual Zorathans. They’re very similar but there are some pretty major differences.”  
  
“Oh?” The smaller reptile replied quizzically, “Such as?”  
  
“Well the most obvious is the size.” I expounded, pointing a claw at my own instrument sitting on the coffee table, “These were clearly designed to be played by humans. An actual Zorathan would be a bit bigger and the neck was proportionally longer as well. Those are minor details though. The biggest difference is the materials that go into making it.”  
  
“What sort of materials?”  
  
“Well first are the strings. These appear to be some sort of metal. An actual Zorathan would be made from mud sentinel guts.”  
  
“Guts?” Onio interrupted, an excited look in his eyes, “How intriguing! Was the sound much different? For that matter, what is a mud sentinel?""  
  
“The sound wasn’t actually that far off.” I mused, “Probably because mud sentinel guts were so blasted tough. As for what a mud sentinel was? They were massive, reptilian herbivores. They had enormous crests on their heads and a single horn on their nose. They had thick, wiry hairs along their backs as well. Oh, and the males had huge tusks in their mouths! They were extremely aggressive towards most things entering their territory. They were called mud sentinels because the males would claim mud flats as their territory and the herds would spend most of their time sunk into the mud to keep cool.”  
  
“Oh my.” The Harchen thought aloud, “I dare say they must have been quite the threat to settlements.”  
  
“Not at all.” I replied, feeling a bit proud of myself for being able to answer his questions, as mundane as they may have been. “Most cattle farmers would purposely create large mud flats around the edges of their grazing land to attract them. They didn’t mind the cattle being nearby and were a great way to deter predators from getting near them.”  
  
“Would they not attack the Arxur farmers?” Onio asked, cocking his head curiously.  
  
“Well, they would if the ranchers got too close. But most of the time they learned to just ignore the ranchers, so long as they kept a proper distance.”  
  
“What a fascinating use of the environment for pest control.” The reptile gasped, looking positively giddy.  
  
“But back on topic,” I continued, ignoring his excitement, “The other difference is the biggest. The wood. A real Zorathan was made exclusively from Zorian wood. It’s what gave the instrument its name. The wood only grew in the volcanic belt at the equator. The trees were virtually unkillable and just kept growing till they couldn’t get enough resources and starved themselves to death.”  
  
“What was so special about this wood?” He inquired, focusing himself on the topic at-hand, once again.  
  
“It kept trying to regenerate for a few days after being cut.” I explained, “The carvers had to work quickly to shape the Zorathan within that time-frame. That way, the wood would have time to regenerate a little bit before it was put over a flame. The low heat from the fire would cause it to stop regenerating. I don’t understand the specifics of it, but from what I understand, the regeneration meant that any minor imperfections from the carving process would heal up, before they polished it. It made the sound of each Zorathan nearly identical to every other.”  
  
“I see.” Onio nodded, “That must have required quite a skilled craftsman to work with the wood?” I thumped my tail in confirmation.  
  
“Exactly.”  
  
“Thank you my dear.” The Harchen said, moving on, “I am glad to know a bit more about my lovely muse’s art. My next question is… perhaps a bit more sensitive.” I cocked my head at that, my tail wagging slightly behind me. I had an idea where he was going with this.  
  
“I was curious if the Arxur have any particular rituals for courtship?  
  
“Why, yes.” I answered, trying to contain my excitement, “There were a few that I know of. For instance, it was customary to announce your intentions by bringing the woman you wished to court an offering of food.” I paused, noticing with amusement how intently Onio was listening, “After that, you would request a test.”  
  
“A test?” He inquired, “What sort of test?”  
  
“A test of your skill as a hunter. A way to show you could provide for a mate.”  
  
“I see.” He said with a nod, his enthusiasm not the least bit abated. Would this crazy little Harchen actually go through with something like this? I knew that the individuals here in the camp were quite different to their modern counterparts, but I still found it difficult to believe that one of these herbivores could stomach hunting.  
  
“The female in question would select a target for the hunt,” I pressed on, “usually a dangerous or difficult to catch prey. Something to let the man really show off his skill. You… are you thinking of doing that for Izra?”  
  
“I am.” He answered without hesitation, “I intend to show her my interest is sincere. I believe it would bring her some measure of joy, if I were to approach this in the manner of her own people.”

“The Longshore Arxur?” I replied, “I’m fairly certain that was their tradition. You’d have to ask Izra to be sure though.”

“Longshore Arxur? What does that mean?”

“Her home country. It was called Longshore.” I explained, watching as the Harchen grew interested once more, “It was a small island nation. One that was low on Betterment’s invasion list. They barely made any of their own food, so Betterment planned to just invade their trading partners and starve them out.”

“A cowardly tactic.” Onio spat, his tail flicking irritably. I couldn’t argue that. It was no secret to the rank-and-file Arxur that, despite all their rhetoric about cruelty and courage, the Prophet Descendent and his top officials were cowards. Not that you’d ever hear any Betterment Arxur say such a thing. At least not say it and live.

“I agree.” I responded, feeling a sense of shame well up inside me, knowing that I had been a part of that. The fact that Izra understood full-well that I had been part of Betterment, and still chose to show me such kindness… it made me feel sick with myself.

“Are you well, dear?” Onio questioned, hopping from the couch and walking over to me. He reached a paw out, placing it on my knee.

“It sickens me.” I hissed, “The fact that I was a part of that. That I was part of the group that ruined Arxur society.”

“You clearly have nothing in common with those people.” The smaller reptile replied calmly, acting as though he were simply stating the obvious, “The mere fact that the idea sickens you, is proof of that.” I looked over at him, watching as he gave my leg a confident pat, “Just remember my dear, the circumstances of one’s birth do not dictate our fate. One cannot decide what we are born into, only what we choose to become.”

For a moment I saw a bit of what Izra must see in him. Sure he was a bit odd, but underneath that goofy surface there was something deeper. He was confident, unafraid and remarkably intelligent.

“Thank you.” I responded, at last, “I… I hope I can live up to that idea.”

“Not to be too crass my lady,” The Harchen laughed, his scales turning a slightly brighter shade as he spoke, “but the mere fact you haven’t resorted to the vile and barberous cannibalism they have, shows that you are.”

“I may not have eaten anyone…” I replied nervously, looking away as I suddenly felt a new wave of shame wash over me, “but I’ve done other things…”

Onio paused, pulling himself up onto the couch, “What do you mean?”

“I was a… a conscript.” I admitted, curling in on myself as the memories came back once again, “I saw combat. The things I did… they were awful. I listened to every order they gave me. I… I just did those awful things.”

“Ah.” The man said knowingly, “I was a soldier myself dear. No one leaves war without some regrets.”

“They aren’t just some regrets!” I hissed, suddenly incensed at how casually he spoke, “They made be burn down a whole house filled with younglings! They wanted to set an example to the locals, so they rounded up all of the young ones and… and… Prophet help me… I just wanted to live! I didn’t want to die!”

My sudden spiral into that memory was interrupted as Onio gave my knee a squeeze. His face had taken on a hardened and distant look.

“Let me tell you a story.” He began, pulling my attention away from memories that I had much rather forgotten, “There was a separatist movement in the southeast of my home country. A group from the Donda Valley region wished to gain independence. The government would never allow that, however, as the valley was much too valuable for agricultural production. So they sent us in to restore order. My unit rounded up an entire separatist cell. We caught them off guard and they surrendered without a fight. I wanted to take them prisoner. My commanding officer denied that. The government said we had too many prisoners already, no use bringing in more mouths to feed. So he had us line them up against a wall… and we executed them.”

I listened in shock to the Harchen’s story. Nothing in me could have expected a story like that from him. The unfamiliar, forlorn look on his face just felt wrong, when I compared it to the bubbly, excitable Onio that I was used to.

“Why did you do it?”

“The same reason as you, dear.” Onio replied with a weary sigh, “I was afraid. I would have my entire career ruined, had I refused the order. My life would have been over and I would have been imprisoned for insubordination. So, I did what I was told.” For a long moment the pair of us sat in silence, uncertain what to even say.

“How do you live with it?” I asked at last, looking over to the small reptile with a renewed sense of respect.

“We may be so far into the future that our crimes have passed from living memory,” Onio said melancholically, “but they will weigh on our shoulders forever. I carry the shame and regret of what I have done, every single day. I accept that. I choose to be a better person, here and now. That is how I live with it. By being a better person and pushing ahead. A stain like that never goes away, I’m afraid. But over time, you learn to shoulder the weight a bit better.”



**Memory Transcription Subject:** Izra, Curious Arxur

**Date: \[Standardized Human Time\]:** February 5, 2137



This radio that Arthur had repaired was proving quite the boon to me. Jazz had just been the beginning. The sheer variety of Human musical styles was positively daunting! From Jazz I had moved to blues. From blues to country. From country to rock. From rock to pop. It was a never ending scrounger hole of possibilities!  
  
I was going to have to introduce some of the other musicians to this feast of music. It would be incredible to try and experiment with some of these styles, even with our limited instrumental options.  
  
I think the country and pop styles might be doable with what we had. That would be interesting, to say the least. Iskit had expressed interest in learning a new instrument. Perhaps if the Tilfish could pick up on guitar? The possibilities washed through my mind in an excited torrent.  
  
I was just finishing up a song by a band known as “Nirvana”, when my holopad began to ring. I pushed the button on the radio to mute it, before reaching over and accepting the incoming call.  
  
“Hey Izra!” Jammek greeted from the other side, the video showing him in some sort of waiting room, “Sorry about last night. I was… ehh… tied up with something.”  
  
“It is no issue, Friend Jammek.” I answered, “I was simply wondering how your press conference went? The news here did not show much of it.”

“That’s probably for the best.” The Venlil replied, a look of distress on his face, “It didn’t go so well.”

“What happened?” I hissed worriedly.

“Someone leaked a bunch of information to one of the reporters.” Jammek explained, his ears laying flat against his head, “He knew about the dog and Arthur’s fight with that Walter guy.”

“Who would have told him?” I gasped, wracking my brain, “Why?”

“I’m not sure.” The Skalgan sighed, shaking his head in the Human fashion. It seemed we had all picked up on some of their mannerisms in our stay here.

“Auntie?!?” Came an excited squeak from the other end. Mixsel suddenly burst into view, scrambling her way up onto Jammek’s lap.

“Hello, little one.” I cooed, waving a claw at the white fluff on the other end of the call, “How are you today?”

“I’m good!” She giggled, a maniacal look on her little face, “I got to see a guy get chased by buds!”

“Buds?” I repeated uncertainly.

“She means birds.” Jammek explained, leaning his face up next to hers, “It’s a long story.”

“Well, you will have to tell me all about it, Mixsel.” I laughed. That child certainly liked getting into mischief. I silently wondered if my Azna would have been like that, had she been given the chance?

“Awfu is taking the em… ema… emathy test!” Mixsel announced, “The cute little doctu said Awfu was going to do gweat!”

“So he decided to take it?” I inquired, “Did he talk to Dr. Bilon first?”

“No.” Jammek grumbled, a look of concern growing on his face, “He says he’ll call him after though. It worries me, but the doctors here said that none of the humans suffered any lasting effects.”

Suddenly from the other side, Mixsel and Jammek looked up from the camera. The sound of someone’s voice could be just barely heard, coming from out of view.

“Got to go Izra!” Jammek announced, “They just let us know that Arthur is about to finish up. We’ll call you again afterwards!”

“Goodbye, you two.” I replied, swishing my tail behind me. It was odd, I thought as the call ended, I missed those three far more than I had thought I would. The whole house just seemed so quiet without them. Before I could dwell further on that thought, a knock came from the front door.

Rising from the couch, I made my way over and opened it up, only to find Onio on the other side. The Harchen held a large dish in his hands, filled with what appeared to be some variety of rib meat. 

“Hello Onio.” I greeted, my tail thumping happily behind me, “Would you like to come in?” The small male gave me a curt bow, stepping quickly inside as I moved out of his way. Moving over to the dining room table, he sat the container of food down, before promptly turning around towards me, his head held high.

“I intend to announce my intentions to court you my lady.” He abruptly exclaimed, shocking me. I had assumed his “intentions” were pretty much crystal-clear to begin with. My eyes flitted over to the ribs on the table and the pieces of the puzzle started to fall into place. Shuyi had said he went to talk to Veryn. I think I knew why now.

“Onio,” I sighed in frustration, “this *isn’t* necessary.”

“Nonsense.” The small reptile rebuffed, flicking his tail dismissively, “I insist! Test me my dear!”

I gave a silent groan. Why did Veryn think it would be a good idea to tell him about that? After seeing his prowess in person, I was at least somewhat less worried about his own well-being. After all, it wasn’t like he was expected to kill his quarry with his bare claws. My primary concern was how the Humans might look at this. They didn’t seem too keen on killing native wildlife from what I had seen, and were certainly less than eager to let the refugees go wandering around outside the camp. The guards had even insisted the Krokotls not fly too far from the fences.

“Can… can you let me think about it?” I pleaded in frustration, noticing the previously confident Harchen deflate slightly at my reply. “I’m not telling you no!” I added quickly, “I just need some time to figure out how we could do a test, here on this planet.” Onio immediately perked back up, an excited glimmer in his eyes.

“Ah! Of course!” He laughed, “I didn’t mean to rush things my dear! I’m sure you need time to pick a proper challenge for me! I shall begin to make my own preparations, post haste!” He suddenly reached out, grabbing me by one claw, before leaning forward and pressing his mouth to it. I gave him a blank, confounded look in response, uncertain what the gesture was meant to imply. Onio, in typical fashion, appeared entirely unfazed by my confusion and simply made his way towards the door. “Don’t go easy on me, my muse! I shall show you that even an herbivore can be a mighty hunter, when fueled by the passions of love!”

I stood for a moment, staring in utter shock as he shut the door behind him, leaving me alone in the room. I collapsed down into one of the wooden chairs around the dining room table, reaching out and grabbing a rib. I absent-mindedly tossed it, bone and all, into my jaws. My mind was struggling to process what had just happened. I chewed the tangy, fatty meat and allowed the delicious taste to bring my senses back into focus.

This was a conundrum. The man was obviously dead-set on going through with this. The idea of picking some small, inconsequential target crossed my mind. No. He would just find that to be insulting. I was going to need to talk to a Human about this. I suppose a visit to the concierge was in order.",32,1766790425.0,NatureofPredators,7,1.0,False

The stench had gotten worse every day since Sarah left; she was the heart of this house, and now without her, it rotted around me. Ninety-three days have passed since she left, over three months of excess and misery, watching the walls of filth grow around me—my only sense of day-to-day progression. I felt as though she left me with a hole in my stomach, one I relentlessly tried to fill, but her impression was too intricate; the crude substitutions of food and drink only seemed to stretch and warp her outline. 

Things hadn’t always been this way; I suppose I was always a bit of a slob, but it used to be manageable. I worked at a dump, compacting mountains of trash, so my tolerance to filth had always been a bit more endurant than most. But after the car accident, after Molly and my back injury, I grew less and less capable of cleaning up after myself. I was no longer able to work either; forced to retire and draw disability, I spent all my days stewing on my grave mistake, replaying my sweet Molly’s scream from the backseat over and over in my head. Things had just gotten worse, to the point where Susan could no longer manage to deal with the trail of mess I left behind with my every step. I didn’t blame her for leaving; I just had no idea how to continue without her. I had nothing now. 

Nothing can ever prepare you for losing a child; when Molly died it felt as though the world should end around me, like a fundamental law of reality and decency has been irreprovably violated to an extent that the world should stop moving. But it just keeps going.  

Cluttering mounds of trash tangled with clothes hid the floors and surfaces, a crude collage from hundreds of binges, each piece a memory flashing in my mind as my eyes roved around the room. 

I hadn’t slept the night before, just catatonically stared at the mold growing down from my ceiling. It had started as a splotch on the leaky ceiling that Sarah had routinely sprayed with bleach to cull its growth. I’d allowed it to grow; I’d even taken to talking to it, reminiscing about times I spent with my family, back when the world made sense.
My bladder ached as I lay in bed; typically I would just use one of the bottles covering my nightstand, but they’d all been filled to the brim. My bedsheet felt like the scabbed skin of a junkie, scratching me with its brittle, chewed nails as I rolled towards the edge and grabbed my cane. 

Something damp and furry squelched under my foot as I pushed through the trash and landed on the carpet, digging a path with my feet. The matted carpet felt like clay under my feet, like I was walking through a muddy lake of trash as I tried to hurriedly dig a path to the bathroom. I grabbed the door and pulled, but it was barricaded;  my bladder felt like it would give with each consecutive tug of the door. I edged the door along until it was finally wide enough to slide my bulk through. Now in a full panic for relief, I trampled over the pile, feeling it rough and scratchy against my feet. After I’d ascended to the peak of the pile, still feet away from the toilet, I dropped my sweatpants around my knees. 

I relieved myself, then hesitantly grabbed my scale from the counter. I knew the results weren’t going to be good, but my morbid curiosity required me to attach a number to attach numerical value to my sense of self-deprecation. The numbers spun so fast that it looked like it may fly off the scale, passing the maximum of three hundred pounds and landing at the fifty mark. 
“My god. How can I have gained forty pounds in the last three months?”

I let out a sigh but quickly went quiet as I heard something coming from my hallway. A soft, familiar, harmonious whisper, a tune I recognized distinctly as it scored the memories that looped in my head on repeat. It was “I Can’t Help Falling in Love with You,” our song and her ringtone.

I turned around and hurried back to my room, tripping lightly over the mound behind me in my desperation to catch her call. Entering the hallway, my foot clipped against the tunnel of trash, sending it avalanching over the path in front of me. I began to trample over the pile, feeling it crunch under my feet as I hurried along. Stepping through the doorway, I saw her name surrounded by hearts on my phone, but my balance started to waver, it felt as though the pile started to shake below me and I fell face forward. My head smashed hard into the metal bed frame, and my forehead split open as I groggily landed in the pile of trash. I felt dizzy and confused as I raised my head. I was lost and entranced by the sound of her song as I tried to recall what I was doing. Then the music stopped, and it came back to me.

“I have to call her back.” I felt blood streaming down my face and dripping off my chin as I stood to my feet.

My balance was still wobbly as I made my way to the phone. Blood slickened my phone, my thumbs leaving a crime scene around the screen as I frustratedly tried to call her back. I turned it on speaker and listened as each dial tone marked the descent towards disappointment; I just needed to hear her voice, I thought. My foot nervously tapped at the damp spot, matching the rapid beat of my heart against my ribs. The sixth tone sounded with no answer and left me with a pathetic frown on my face as the robotic voice sent me to her voicemail.

“Hi, this is Sarah. Sorry I missed your call. Leave a message at the beep.”
I looked at my phone, wiping the dragged lines of running blood on my shirt before seeing she’d left a voicemail.

""Hey Matt, this is Sarah. I’m just calling to let you know I’m going to be coming by to grab the last of my stuff next Friday. I hope you’re taking care of yourself; we’ll get coffee then and talk about all this. … I still love you, Matt.”
The relief her voice used to bring was gone; instead, it just stung at the circumference of the hole in my stomach. That last line echoed through the apathetic void in my mind: “I still love you.” What did she mean by that? Was she just being nice? Or is there hope for us still? I replayed it six times, each time with the naive hope that the next listen would bring some clarity to the statement, that I’d pick up on some subtle nuance that clarified the debacle. But each time just increased my stress and twisted the ambiguity of the message into a self-inflicted weapon of conspiratorial thoughts. 

Anxious thoughts recklessly looped around my mind, like a train off its rails moving in concentric circles with exponential momentum. I fell back to my typical last line of defense for these episodes. I went to the kitchen.

The floor felt sticky on my feet, like the grime was trying to trap me there, saying, ""Stay and indulge further."" I swung the fridge door open, letting loose the trapped stench of rot. A plate of burgers that Sarah had left to thaw before she left abruptly. I held my breath as I reached the rack above it to grab a twelve-pack of Bud Light; the door clanked slightly against the glass bottles as I hurriedly closed it behind them. I opened the pantry, reaching behind the coffee to grab the pack of snowballs. I felt something furry graze along my fingers before it squeaked away.

Anticipation and shame swirled in my belly, fighting for dominance as I followed the trail back to the bed. I fell into bed, and my body reflexively opened the first snowball on muscle memory, taking no time to taste as I forced the dry sphere past my lips. Crumbs rained onto my belly as I chewed with my mouth forced open. I grabbed another, unwrapping it ravenously with my mouth still half full and biting half of it off to feel my mouth packed with cake and marshmallow again. I felt myself choking on the dry pastry, heavy and slow in my throat, the narrow streams of air barely worming their way through the crumble, and I started to hack slightly. My throat squeezed against the sweet obstruction; I opened one of the beers and began to pour it over the dense packing, feeling the cake soften to a carbonated chocolate mud that dripped down my throat. I continued cramming, rinsing down the fourth and then the fifth before my stomach began to protest. I let the cake fall from my mouth to my sheets as I quickly grabbed an aluminum bottle from the bedside table, screwed off the top, and wrapped my lips around it. The smell of ammonia hit me hard as the bile exited my mouth and splashed back onto my lips. I realized with disgust what I had done. I started gagging as I thrust the bottle away from my face, feeling it splash onto my wrist. I screwed the lid back onto it before throwing it next to my bed, watching as the bottle sank to the bottom as if dragged. The bottle filled the room with the stench of piss and vomit, so I decided to go to the living room. 

I was overwhelmed with vertigo as I stood up; my footing faltered. As my mind swirled, I nearly slipped on the same spot from before. It felt significantly deeper and wetter; sticky red slime rose with my foot, and I disgustedly dragged it on the clay-covered carpet to wipe it off.

The living room was buried in two feet of trash; on a quick scan around, you’d be hard-pressed to identify a single object in the tangled mounds, outside of the yellow-stained couch and the box TV surrounded by bottles that hid the bottom half of the picture. I plopped down on my La-Z-Boy, pulling the lever and watching as detritus was thrown across the room; the metal screeched under my weight as my ass form-fitted into the seat. 
I turned on the TV, and the DVD inserted into it started playing, a slideshow of pictures and videos from when we were young. A picture of us at the bar popped onto the screen, me holding her in one arm and a beer in the other. I was so young and strong then. Sarah looked so happy, laughing wildly. I don’t remember the last time I saw her like that… My nose started to run as tears began to well in my eyes. I felt that pit in my stomach rising, feeling at risk of swallowing me whole; it demanded I stuff it down. I fixed my gaze on the snack as I forced it into my mouth when our song came on again. I looked up to see us dancing; we twirled around the room, and my mind flashed to the night. We danced for hours, until everyone else had left the cathedral. I haven’t been able to dance since the accident; now I can barely walk on my own.

We’d continued to grow distant since that day. She was kind and tried to help me deal with the guilt, but I always felt like she blamed me on some level. I know I do.

“God…things have gotten so bad.” As I said this, a glob of chewed chocolate fell from my full mouth and onto my belly, rolling off into the trash.

A photo of our last Christmas appeared on screen, and I was reminded of when this room was cluttered with presents and shining decorations rather than filth. I began to sob wildly at this sight. Molly tore open the last of her presents and saw a big plush rat.

“I love it so much!” She said, squeezing her arms around it.

“I’ll name him Mr. Cheesy!”

“Goddammit.” I pressed my hands against my stinging eyes.  “I have to get this all clean. I need Sarah back. God, I can’t live like this.”

I continued to eat as I sobbed uncontrollably until I fell asleep with my mouth still full.
I woke to a sound coming from my bedroom; it was difficult to decipher with my mind still fuzzy, but it sounded like a pained groan. At first I thought it must be an animal that had gotten trapped. I grabbed my beer and my cane and started towards the door.

But as I got closer, I realized this wasn’t an animal. Impossibly, I thought it sounded like Sarah. “Fuck,” I thought. Did she come through early to get her stuff? She sounds hurt? I hoped she hadn’t slipped in the piles of trash and injured herself; I’d never be able to stomach the shame if my mess got her hurt.
I began to rush towards the door as fast as I was able.

“Sarah? Are you okay?” My throat tensed and nostrils revolted at the overwhelming stench of filth that hit me as I opened the door.
I covered my nose, adrenaline stifling a gag as my panicked eyes darted around the room, but I didn’t see her.

Looking to the corner of the room, I saw the large heap of trash next to the bed twitching incrementally; the pieces of trash seemed to flare out, giving a brief glimpse of a red skeletal base that connected the individual pieces. 

“Matt.” Sarah’s voice would call from the pile, interspersed between shrill, painful cries in her voice.

My sense of fight or flight sent me racing; I just wanted to stop the torturous screams, so I began to dismantle the pile. I grabbed a bag of chips at its base and began to pull, but it felt stuck on. I felt sticky skin pulling like wet adhesive; it made a sloppy sloshing noise, and I was hit with a stench of spit, stale soda, and piss. Her scream heightened in pitch, causing my eardrums to ring. Blood rushed from under the bag as red tendrils pulled against my grip.
“Matt, you’re hurting me, Matt.”

My grip released, and the bag snapped back into place with a wet clapping noise that sent sticky red liquid spritzing around my face. It tasted like Sarah’s mouth if she’d eaten the contents of a dumpster. I felt sickened and longing at the reminder, but it also tasted nostalgic and heavenly.

“Please, Matt, I’m so hungry. Please, bottle. Give bottle.” 

“What the fuck are you?”

“It’s me, Matt.”

“No, this doesn’t make any sense. What do you want from me?”

“Matt, please, I’m so hungry; Matt, help me, or I’ll die.” The words felt good to hear in a perverse way; it had been so long since I’d felt needed, I’d gotten so used to being the one needing help. I stood frozen, eyeing the bottle of beer in my hand.

“You just want the bottle?”

“Yes, please.”

I drank the rest of the stale beer and threw it into the pile; I watched as the trash avalanched over it. I heard a cracking of glass and watched as the shimmering fragments began to spread around the exterior of its mass, the light catching off it making it shine with a brilliant radiance.

“I love you, Matt.”

“Why do you sound like her?”

“It’s me, Sarah.”

Pain shot up my knees as I fell in front of the pile in gawking reverence. I saw small red spots speckled around it; ripples moved in waves through the crimson puddles. I touched one of them with my thumb and felt warm blood spread under my finger.

It winced slightly. “Soft, please.”

I kept my eyes on the pile as I backed out of the room, closing the door behind me. I heard the pie through the door humming the tune of Sarah and my song.

“I’m losing my mind,” I said, rubbing my thumbs on my temples.

I went back to my chair, my feet unconsciously syncing me to the harmony of our song as my body swayed slightly. I plopped down, grabbing a snowball and tearing it from the pack. I stared at it in my hand, mouth open in preparation. I felt disgusted at the sight of it; my stomach turned at the thought of scarfing it down. I threw it into the pile. I suddenly felt a wave of relaxed exhaustion hit me as my adrenaline crashed.

“I have got to get out of here, man; I need to get away from this mess.”

I went to the one clean room in the house, my daughter's room, left completely untouched since she passed.

Walking in felt like I was entering a different world, from a house buried in trash to a bastion of childhood whimsy, with pink walls sporting posters of fantastical creatures and landscapes.

Her bed was made tightly, and rather than disturb it, I lay on the floor, snuggled tightly with Mr. Cheesy as the song still faintly echoed to me. I buried my face into it, feeling my tears dampen its fur against my face.
I cried until I fell asleep.

I was woken by Sarah’s groans reverberating into the room; my head rushed up, and for a fleeting moment I expected to see her next to me before the memories of the last few months flooded back to my mind, followed shortly by the insanity of last night. I looked up at the clock; it was 3:00 AM. I scrambled to my feet, noticing I had left my cane in the living room, before I dragged myself with only a slight limp back to my room.

“Matt, please, I’m so hungry.” I looked at the pile, which was noticeably smaller; the specks of blood dotting its surface had shrunken into brown shriveled scabs.

“I just fed you,” I said, still bleary-eyed and disoriented, my head pounded and swirled in confusion. Her whines felt like spikes penetrating through my clouded brain, insanely standing as the only point of cohesion and understanding in my confused state.

“More, please. More, or I’ll die, Matt, and you’ll lose me.”

I tried to focus my thoughts. Was this a good idea? I’m not sure what this thing is, but I was unsure of most things at the moment, my head aching and disoriented, unable to grasp my reality.

Sarah’s voice let out a bloodcurdling cry that cleared any thoughts of moral decisions and sent me into a primal scramble to save the one I loved.

“Sarah? Are you okay?” I said it but got no response. I kicked myself slightly for calling this thing Sarah, but my panic did not subside with the realization. I shook the pile, feeling the bottles lazily drag as if through viscous liquid; it sounded wet, and the smell of bile emanated from the opening it formed. I watched as a bottle consolidated itself into a ball before being sucked into the center of the pile, causing it to shrink down a couple of inches at its center.

“I’m dying, Matt.”  Its voice cried weakly.
I grabbed as much garbage as I could fit in the breadth of my arms, feeling greasy stains and backwash soak through my white t-shirt as I hauled load after load towards the pile. I dumped the trash onto it and watched as it seemed to open out, widening the holes and swallowing the loose detritus in its many openings. Smooth, translucent, red mouths lined with black furry veins extended from the openings, biting at the rain of garbage and scarfing it down, blood spurting as it smacked its lips. The pile continued to swell as it ingested more of its food; a small poof of smoke billowed from each of its holes. I watched a two-liter stick from its peak still only halfway down; greasy burger wrappers lubricated its descent, but it seemed to get stuck before the plastic on the bottle began to warp as if chemically heated.

The pile doubled in size; I watched as the blood splotches grew to massive patches of blood sodden, gooey musculature around the pile. It stretched around the bottles and grew over the ridges of crumpled paper and plastic. It grew around the circumference of the puddles with fibrous tendrils that walked down its mass, intertwining to form a wall of soft, sinewy tissue that looked like a massive throbbing tumor.

“I love you so much, Matt. Thank you.”

“You’re not really her.”

“But I can be Matt; I just need more.”

I wasn’t going to be getting any more sleep, so I decided to start cleaning. After all, how bad could this thing be if it was encouraging me to clean my house? It needed to be clean when the real Sarah got here anyways.

I went to the kitchen and grabbed the dusty box of trash bags and began before heading back to my room. I still limped slightly, but it was better than it had been since the accident. She sang our song as I cleaned, and I was reminded of how Sarah would sing and hum when she cleaned.

I filled bag after bag as I awkwardly danced and swayed around the room to her song.
I filled twelve bags of what was left on the floor in the room. I’d also vacuumed the carpet, filling the empty tank of the vacuum three times over before the job was done. The mold on the wall had spread rapidly; it was thick in the carpet around the pile and spread around the room like a complex vascular system faintly visible on the dark-stained carpet.

“I got a lot for you to eat now; you shouldn’t be hungry for a while.” I said, my voice shaken slightly with uncertainty.

“Oh Matt, you’re so good to me, I would never leave you.” I found myself blushing slightly at her words.

The bags were heavy and sagged with liquid at their bottom, feeling as though they may burst through as the plastic strained against the weight. I dragged the bags one by one towards her; I turned around with it the size of a beachball, and when I came back with the next bag, it was the size of a washing machine, with its mouths the size of my head and growing. This continued until I dumped the final bag of trash onto it and saw it grow to the size of a twin-sized bed and up to the chest of my 5’10” frame. Thick red liquid secreted from under its mass in synchronized bursts with what sounded like water drumming against metal. I could feel the sticky liquid pooling between my toes, sticking my feet to the ground, and when I lifted them, thick strings of the stuff came up with my foot feeling like strings of wet cement. The furry black veins sprawled across the irregular membrane with the complexity and intricacy of a spider web. Pieces of trash jutted out around the dark red stomach, stretching its skin taut and giving it a spiny appearance; it looked as if the skin might tear as it throbbed outward. I heard metal and plastic popping as the jutting imprints of trash compressed flat.

Though I didn’t feel tired while working, after I’d finished I was hit by a wave of exhaustion. I crawled next to her in my bed and went to sleep despite it only being 5pm.

The next day I cleaned the bathroom; the mold had already spread tentacular, hardly visible on the stained black linoleum. I looked into my mirror after I’d cleaned the floor, seeing one of my pupils double the size of the other with my eyes a bright red. I was able to nearly finish the hallway the same day before I fell from exhaustion at her base. 

That night I lay down next to the pile, and we watched old videos. I watched one of Sarah and me playing with Molly at the park; I pushed her high into the air on the swing, and she screamed with joy and mock fear as she soared into the air.

“Haha thank you, Daddy” She screamed.
“I miss Molly so much.” I said with a tear forming in my eye.

A long, slimy tendril wiped my eye.

“I know, Matt, so do I.”

I hugged the slimy mass of flesh. Crying my eyes out and feeling the blend of blood and salty tears mix in my eyes.

“Do me a favor, please.”

“What is it, Matt?”

“Stay out of her room; I just want that to remain pure.”

“I promise, Matt, I won’t touch it at all.”
I wiped the red liquid off of my body before crawling into bed.

The living room took three days to finish, and as I finished wiping down the surfaces, I wrung the gray liquid from the filthy paper towels over her and watched as small mouths gaped around her body, slurping down the running gray water. I even dumped the nearly full pack of snowballs into one of the bags. I hadn’t worked like this in years, but it didn’t feel like work. I didn’t take breaks; I didn’t feel I needed them. I felt more rested now cleaning nineteen-plus hours a day than I had sleeping more than half of it away. Now that I had Sarah's angelic voice to lull me to sleep, my days had gone from lethargic fatigue to a focused drive propelled by an almost manic energy. She sang our song on repeat as I jovially floated around the house, my motion in sync with her harmony as I cleaned. The fungal map moved under my feet, tickling me slightly.

She now nearly filled the entire room, touching all four corners and sloping up at her center to nearly touch the light fixture. I tore open the bag as I stood in the doorway and began feeding the damp towels into her front-facing mouth.

“Why don’t you look like her?” I said as I grabbed one of the used towels from the bag and fed it into the bulbous lips of the mouth in front of me.

“I’m trying to, but it’s so hard with just plastic and paper; I need flesh matt, flesh to make flesh.” Her words were uninterrupted as her mouth closed around my fingers and sucked the towel away from my grip.

I thought about the meat in the fridge; I’d hardly opened the fridge in the last several days, so it had slipped my mind. I fed her one more of the towels before heading to the kitchen.

I opened the door to the fridge, and though the meat had progressed in its rot, the smell no longer offended me but was a recognizable change from the prevailing scent of filth that I’d gotten used to. I grabbed the plate and headed back to her, sliding the meat down into her mouth. I then watched as its tongue extended and licked the molded blood from the plate. The flesh above her mouth began to bubble and rise into a nub of pink translucent flesh that bloomed out of the stomach from in front of where I stood at the doorway. Flakes of scaly pale skin scattered patchily around the nub, which was the size of a fist and twitched lazily.

“This is a good start, Matt, but I’m going to need more.”

“Ok.” I pulled out my phone and made an order.

“Lie with me, Matt; you’ve given me so much. Hold me.”

I lay down in the thick puddle of red at her feet, my legs forced out of the doorway, her soft flesh forming around my head. I could feel the sticky liquid worming into my ear canal as I made my head comfortable and went to sleep.

The next morning I sat up from the puddle of crimson, feeling it peel off my skin in stringy vines that snapped as I sat up. My left ear coughed out thick red molasses as I smacked the right side of my head. 

“Good morning, my love.” Her voice had been getting more like Sarah's every day and now was indistinguishable.

“Good morning,” I said, rising to my feet.

I went to the bathroom and grabbed a towel off the sink, wiping the liquid off me. While I was in the bathroom, I thought to step on the scale; it read 270, which I was ecstatic to see, and I realized how ridiculous I was to think she could be bad for me. So far she’d only helped me to clean my house and lose weight. I lifted my shirt and saw a pile of loose skin bundled around my midsection and sagging down to my waist. 

I returned to the room, wrung the towel into the pile, and watched pink tube-like appendages stick from the mouths and bend to suck the liquid dripping down it. 

“The meat is on its way.”

“Yay, thank you, Matt.”

With the house now clean, I had nothing better to do than to wait at the door for the delivery, preparing an explanation for if the driver had a remark about the strange order. I’d used the last of my monthly check to make the purchase and was eager to see the results. I thought about how wonderful it would be, even if it wasn’t really Sarah, if it sounded like her and looked like her and made me feel the way she did. Was there a difference?

The thought was interrupted by a banging at the door.

I cracked the door open to see a man standing with bags clustered in his hands. He eyed me oddly as I reached past the cracked door to grab the bags wordlessly.

I carried the bags into the room and set them in front of the pile. 12 frozen chickens.

“Thank you so much, Matt, but can you do me a favor?”

""What is it?""

“Don’t watch.”

My large, sweaty hands slipped under the tight plastic, feeling soft, wet skin over the hard frozen center. After stripping them all bare, I began to insert them from head to toe into the orifice. It was too tight to enter at first, but as I rubbed it around the hole, I watched it gape wider and begin to drip sticky brown liquid that made the hole more malleable. I listened to the sweet familiar sounds of Sarah’s moans as I pushed the raw meat with all my force, feeling it deepen inch by inch. The legs felt stuck, and I had to reach into the hole and clasp one side of its interior wall, widening it out to force the rest in. I felt the warm, fleshy walls of her entrails around my fingers as my hand pressed the rest of the poultry inside of her. 

I heard her begin to cry and pulled my hand out, noticing it was a bright red and stinging under the brown liquid coating it, as if from a slightly caustic solution.

“Are you okay? Do you want me to stop?”

“No, keep going!”

I listened to the slopping sounds of meat being digested as I forced my focus to inserting each of the chickens, feeling the orifice widen and moisten with each consecutive intrusion. The last few of the birds entered in with ease and began to dissolve as soon as they touched the brown liquid; I only had to start them into her before the mouth slurped the rest of it into her mouth. As I pushed the remainder of the last chicken into her, an intense burning sensation made me tear my hand away as it made contact with the sludgey brown lubricant.

“Ok, you can look now.”

Her skin was white and pink; small bumps lined the blank human torso and face, with bones jutting occasionally through the skin. Slivers of fat draped down from her ears, nose, and lips and down to cover her nipples. But despite the grotesque exterior, it had formed in the shape of Sarah near perfectly. There was a small pale bump that sprouted under her form.

I slid past the mass of flesh to get into the closet. Sat in the back, wrapped in plastic, was her wedding dress. I slid past her again, unwrapped the dress, and signaled for her to raise her arms. I slid the dress onto her; it bunched at her hips to form a flowing white reef where her torso started.

I approached her closely, pulling a small sharp shard of bone that stuck out from her cheek. My eyes met hers, a milky white, and our bodies touched, feeling my shirt dampen with cold liquid as I caressed my hand down her cheek, feeling its freeze thaw under my touch. I kissed her, tasting cool blood and hard fat in my mouth, feeling the fat coat my tongue as it melted from the heat of my mouth. 

“I love you, Sarah.” I said, pulling away and watching the red fluid drip from her mouth and onto the dress.

“I love you too, Matt.”

I wiped the fluid off of my face, offering her my hand, to which a vascular tongue stuck from one of its mouths and licked it clean.
“Why don’t you burn me like you do the trash?”
 
“Because I choose not to.”

The harmony as she hummed put me in a trance; our bodies came together, and we began to dance. I don’t know how long we danced for. My feet went numb but still effortlessly found the rhythm of her song. Night came and darkened the room, and our silhouettes still swayed against the ambiguity of shadow. Light would pour in, showcasing our love to the rising sun, only to be replaced once again by the night, rendering us secret lovers under the cloak of anonymity. I felt the lump on her stomach slowly growing as we danced. Time lost any meaning within the harmonious display of love; each sway felt like it could last forever. It was a display of the cruelty of time that a moment of such remarkable beauty could end, but such cynicism was a false presumption, as the next motion complemented the story being told. Day and night were rendered an arbitrary setting for something much more important, one whose passage I hardly noticed before long.

As I moved to dip her down, I felt my finger pierce through soft flesh, pulling it away to reveal a black rot on my fingers. 

I stepped back, seeing the growth was now the size of a bowling ball.

“Baby, are you okay? You’re rotting.”
“It’s just… The meat you brought me was already dead; it’ll rot quickly. If you want it to last, I need something living.”

“I can’t feed you something living; that’s wrong and cruel.”

The smell of rot wafted up to me as she pressed her finger to my lips, shushing me. A moment of silence passed before I heard a squeaking in the walls.

“Well, the rats I suppose I need to get rid of them anyways; what’s the harm?”

I went to the living room and grabbed the box of snowballs that I’d left untouched on the coffee table for several days. I opened one, carried it to the kitchen, and left it on the floor as I waited.

About thirty minutes passed before one of the vermin began to sniff at it. I approached slowly, careful not to alert it to my presence. As it began to bite into the treat, I grabbed it from behind. It scratched and clawed at my hand, but despite the pain, I kept a single-minded ambition to carry it to her. As I walked through the bedroom door, it bit down hard on my hand, piercing through it and sending blood streaming down my palm and into its furry coat. I quickly pressed my hand through Sarah's stomach. The creature's cries were frantic in the stomach but died off quickly.

I looked up from nursing my wounded hand to see her clouded pearly eyes rolled over and now showing beady red pupils, as a tuft of scraggly hair sprouted from her scalp.
“I’m going to go get you more.” I said with an exasperated breath.

As I walked through the hallway, I looked at Molly's door, seeing that the mold had started to ease its way underneath it.

I was filled with righteous indignation as I slung her door open and saw that the serpentine path of mold had now lined most of the carpeting. It had even crawled over the plush rat. 

“No, no, no.” 

I marched back into the room.

“Who the hell do you think you are?”

“You stay the hell out of my daughter’s room; you’ve got no goddamn right. I told you never to go in there.”

“It wasn’t me, Matt; please listen.”

I was filled with fury. I grabbed the bulging lump, and I began to rip it from the pile. I pulled, watching the soft skin tear. I hadn’t put strength like this onto something in a very long time. She screamed and cried insanely, pleading with me to stop and listen. 
I felt a sense of triumph at the display of my newfound strength as the skin ripped and plummeted to my back. But my sense of pride was shortcut by a higher pitched scream piercing through Sarahs, one that’s played through my mind everyday since the accident. 
The ball of flesh flattened out and laid flat over my face, I carefully pulled it off my face laying it on the ground as I rose to my knees.

“Daddy? Why did you hurt me, Daddy?”
Molly's face was carved into the underdeveloped bloody mess.

“No.”

“It hurts.” Her voice was trailing off into a whisper.

“Please, God, no.”

“I’ve killed her; I’ve killed her again. God, why? Why could this happen to me?”

“I can save her, Matt; give her to me.”

I pressed the flap over the leaking hole in her stomach and watched as the skin seemed grafted itself on roughly.

“I can heal her, Matt, but I’m going to need something big; I need a person.”

“I can’t do that.”

“It’s the only way, Matt!”

“Ok, just let me think; I just need to think this through.” My head still felt dizzy and clouded; I didn’t know how long I’d been up or when the last time I’d eaten or drunk anything was. 

“There’s no time to think, Matt.” 

“Someone’s here.” 

A knock came from my door.

“Wash yourself off quickly, Matt; you need to lure them in.”

I sprinted towards the bathroom, turning on the shower and rinsing the dried blood from my skin and matted hair, sending it pooling in the tub below me. 

“Just a minute,” I shouted.

I grabbed my last pair of clean clothes from the dryer that had been sitting there for the last several months. I thought it could be a nosy neighbor asking about the smell or the landlord. But I had no choice; if they were insistent on coming in, they would need to be disposed of.

I looked out the peephole to see who the unfortunate victim would be. It was Sarah. 
“Shit,” I whispered. Had it been two weeks already? Everything had been moving so quickly.

I stood there in awe as she knocked again.
I saw her eyes go wide before narrowing inquisitively.

“Hey Matt, how are you? Wow, you’ve lost a lot of weight.” 

“Uh, yeah, I’ve been dieting, I suppose. I’m good though, yeah, I’ve been really good. How have you been?” I said, trying my best to appear casual as my heart pounded in my chest. 

“I’m fine; you’ll have to excuse me. I've been sick with covid, but I’m mostly over it now, besides still not being able to taste or smell anything. Can I come in?” she said, blowing her red nose into a tissue.

“Uh, yeah, just come to the kitchen; I’ll make a pot of coffee.” I let her in, hoping she wouldn’t see the black fungal map under her feet.
I led us through the hallway.

“Wow, it’s spotless in here; it looks so good, Matt. I’m proud of you.”

“Of course, Sarah; I just want us to work.”

“I know, Matt, I do too.”

I closed my eyes as I listened to the sound of her humming behind me while I poured the water into the pot, but my soothed state diminished as I realized there was another humming matching hers from farther away.
I abruptly turned around and took my seat, hoping to distract her before she noticed the mimicry.

“I’ve been really worried about you, Matt.” The words echoed from the room, and I saw Sarah turn her head towards the noise in confusion.

""I’m doing great; there's no need to worry. I’ve just missed you a lot.” I said quickly, trying to break the silence.

“I’ve missed you too.” She squinted her eyes.

“Is there an echo in here?”

“Ah yeah, I guess now that it’s clean, you know?”

“Right.”

“Sarah, I need you in my life. I can’t stand to be without you; these last few months have been miserable.”

“You were miserable with me too, Matt. I’m not the problem in your life. I appreciate the efforts you’ve made, but I need more than for you to clean the house once.”

“It’s not a one-time thing, I promise. I’ll keep it clean; just please, I’m nothing without you.”

“This is what I mean; I can’t be solely responsible for your well-being. I’ve been through this cycle with you before; I’ve seen you make changes, and they just go away over time. I just can’t do that anymore, Matt. I’ve made my decision,"" she said before once again sneezing into her napkin.

My expression went cold. “That’s fine. Please, if you don’t mind, can you grab the rest of your stuff from the room? I can’t bear to see it anymore.”

“I understand.” She said, standing up from the table. 

I watched as she swung the door open in front of her. Watched as she was immediately hit by trash avalanching down to her feet and how the trash seemed to caramelize atop her feet. She tried to tug them, but she screamed in agony as they refused to move. The red flesh began to form back around the trash that was burying Sarah's lower half. Sarah made eye contact with her deformed mimic. My heart sank as she turned back to look at me; with tears in my eyes, I placed my hand on her back and forced her closer to the other Sarah.
She stopped resisting as Molly's face appeared in front of her.

""I love you"" Molly's voice said.

She closed her eyes and extended her arms, trembling as she allowed the pile to embrace her; her skin began to soften and melt away, and I watched the pink salmonella hands dig under the melting skin like clay before painting it over her rotting flesh. Her meat and bones sagged in place as her stomach formed around her, consuming her body into the all-consuming membranous stomach. 
It was a near-perfect imitation of her; only the smell was off. The smell was family, all the filth I’d acquired with love. She floated across the pile, resting on her back where the bed was.

“Lay with me.”  She said her nose began to drip off, and she reshaped it quickly, leaving it asymmetrical and twisted.

I crawled over the soft tissue of her stomach; the pain I felt meant nothing as my palms melted me into place with each stride in my crawl or when I ripped my sticky, melting hand to get closer to her. Tears dripped from my face and sent the gore from my hand running down her belly.

I crawled on top of her, feeling her skin now soft and warm, smelling the scent of her perfume faintly over the overwhelming stench of rot and trash. I felt myself dissolving in her mouth as I sank down, my silhouette forming into the gelatinous flesh perfectly. It was the most delightful sensation I’d ever known, to be fully embraced and accepted as what you are. I heard a whisper before my body sank fully into the stomach.

“Thank you, Daddy.”

My son was an Apache mechanic(MOS 15R) in the Army, recently out. When he saw my first models he said that he'd like to find a detailed model of an Apache. July 12th I started the project, without him knowing and finished the actual model just after thanksgiving. There are a lot of mistakes and only a few less scratch built pieces (broken, escaped tweezers at mach speed or just details). I got the wood from a scrap pile. Routered the edges, ""stained"" it with coffee and a light waxing. My son was here for Christmas and finally found out what I had built. It was really cool to sit with him as he pointed out all the small details and explained what they actually did. He was pretty blown away by the detail. I created an album of all the pictures and videos, ~230, so he can see the work and details.


I purchased and used [Glenn Hoover instructions](https://glennhoovermodels.com/ah-64e-1-35-takom/)...made the build MUCH easier than the original instructions. I learned A LOT....and almost wish I could do it again with the knowledge I gained.

**The Premise:** What happens when a chaotic paralegal with ADHD collides with a repressed, perfectionist Ivy League lawyer in the high-pressure world of a New York corporate law firm? War, obviously. And maybe some very inconvenient sexual tension in the file room. It’s *Suits* meets *Red, White & Royal Blue*, with a heavy dose of workplace burnout and coffee dependency.

**What I’m looking for:**

1. **The Voice:** Does Mateo (the POV character) sound distinct and engaging?
2. **The Pacing:** Does the introduction move fast enough?
3. **The ""Banter"":** Does the dialogue feel snappy and natural, or forced?

**CHAPTER ONE**

**MATEO**



The thing about having ADHD is that your brain is essentially a browser with forty-seven tabs open, three of them playing music, and one of them is on fire, but you can't figure out which one.

This is what I was thinking about at 8:47 AM on a Monday morning while standing in front of the Keurig machine, watching it do absolutely nothing because I'd forgotten to put a pod in. Again.

""You okay there, Rivera?""

I startled so hard I nearly knocked my empty mug off the counter. James Chen was leaning against the doorframe of the break room, arms crossed, grinning at me like I was a particularly entertaining YouTube video.

James was one of those people who seemed to have figured out the secret to life and was too polite to share it with the rest of us. Senior paralegal, five years at the firm, universally liked. He had the kind of easy confidence that came from genuine competence rather than arrogance.

Also, he was inexplicably nice to me, which I'd long ago decided was because he was nice to everyone and not because I was special in any way. People like James—put-together, successful, the kind of handsome that registered on everyone's radar regardless of orientation—didn't notice people like me. Not that way, anyway.

""I'm fine,"" I said, cramming a pod into the machine with more force than necessary. ""Just. You know. Monday.""

""Mondays,"" James agreed, walking toward the counter. He leaned against it, close enough that I caught a hint of whatever expensive cologne he wore. ""Hey, you see the email about Whitmore?""

""The tax shelter thing? With the Cayman shell companies?""

""That's the one. Fourteen boxes of documents just came in. Partner Chen wants the full review by Friday.""

""Partner Chen—wait, isn't that your...""

""Uncle."" James's grin widened. ""Different Chen. Though I understand the confusion. We're both devastatingly handsome and share a genetic predisposition toward obsessing over tax code.""

I laughed despite myself. James had that effect on people—he could make the most stressful situation feel manageable just by making a joke about it. It was probably why the partners kept giving him the nightmare cases.

""Fourteen boxes by Friday,"" I said. ""Cool. I'll cancel my plans.""

""You had plans?""

""I have Netflix and a succulent I haven't killed yet. Those are plans.""

""A succulent. Impressive."" He tilted his head, studying me with what looked like genuine interest. His gaze lingered on my face in a way that made heat prickle at the back of my neck. ""What's its name?""

""...Ricardo.""

James burst out laughing. Not a polite chuckle—a real laugh, the kind that crinkled his eyes and showed his teeth. ""Ricardo. That's incredible. You named your plant Ricardo.""

""He looked like a Ricardo,"" I said defensively, but I was smiling. It was hard not to, when James laughed like that. Like you'd said the funniest thing he'd heard all day, even when you definitely hadn't.

He was still smiling when he said, ""There's something else. We're getting a transfer from the Boston office. They're putting him on Whitmore with us.""

""A transfer? Why?""

""No idea. All I know is he worked on some major cases up there. Supposed to be sharp."" James shrugged. ""Could be good. Extra hands for fourteen boxes.""

""Or extra competition for the one functioning stapler.""

""Hey."" James reached out and squeezed my shoulder briefly. His thumb brushed my collarbone through my shirt, and I tried not to react to how warm his hand was. ""You're the best paralegal on this floor. Don't let some Boston transplant make you forget that.""

I blinked at him. James was always saying stuff like that—complimenting my work, telling me I was good at things, acting like I wasn't one wrong move away from being exposed as the fraud I definitely was. It was just how he was. Encouraging. Mentorship-y. The kind of senior colleague who actually bothered to help the newer people instead of treating them like obstacles.

That's what it was. Mentorship. Not... anything else.

The touch lingered a half-second longer than strictly professional. Or maybe I was imagining it. I was always imagining things—reading into gestures that meant nothing, missing signals that meant everything. My therapist called it ""social processing differences."" My sister called it ""being completely hopeless at knowing when someone's flirting with you.""

Not that James was flirting. James was just... warm. To everyone. It wasn't special.

Besides, even if he were flirting—which he wasn't—office relationships were a minefield. Especially for people like us. The firm had a rainbow flag in the lobby during Pride Month and a non-discrimination policy on the website, but I'd also heard Partner Morrison ask James if he had ""a girlfriend yet"" at the holiday party last year. James had smiled and deflected with a joke about being married to his work.

I'd done the same thing a hundred times. We all had. It was easier than explaining.

""Thanks,"" I said, because that's what you say when someone's nice to you even though you don't fully believe them.

James opened his mouth to say something else—

And then the break room door banged open.

""Is this where they keep the coffee? Thank fuck. The stuff in Boston was basically motor oil.""

I turned around.

And immediately wanted to turn back.

\* \* \*

The man in the doorway was the kind of tall that made you instinctively step back to maintain a reasonable conversation angle. Broad shoulders, expensive shirt that fit like it had been tailored specifically for his body. His hair was artfully messy in a way that probably took twenty minutes and a lot of product, and his jaw looked like it had been carved by someone who had strong opinions about bone structure.

He was, objectively, stupidly attractive. The kind of attractive that made you want to punch something.

Everything about him screamed lacrosse scholarship and summer house in the Hamptons and *I've never had to work for anything in my life.*

I hated him immediately. I also, inconveniently, wanted to know what his shoulders looked like without the expensive shirt. I hated that too.

""Connor Walsh,"" James said, stepping forward with his hand extended. ""From Boston, right? I'm James Chen—I'll be running point on Whitmore.""

""Chen."" Walsh shook his hand with the kind of firm, confident grip they probably taught at prep schools. ""They told me you'd be in charge. And this is...?""

He looked at me. Not through me, the way people usually did. *At* me. His eyes—grey, I noticed, an unsettling pale grey that had no business being that striking—traveled from my face down the length of my body and back up again. The assessment should have felt clinical. Instead, it felt like heat, like being seen, like standing too close to a fire.

My skin prickled. My face flushed.

*What the fuck.*

Something about the assessment made me hyperaware of myself. The shirt I'd ironed badly this morning. The coffee stain on my sleeve I'd hoped no one would notice. The way my hair was probably doing that thing where it stuck up in the back because I'd been running my hands through it while wrestling with the Keurig.

""Mateo Rivera,"" James said, before I could respond. ""He's been on Whitmore since the beginning. Knows more about it than most of the associates.""

""Rivera."" Walsh's eyes flicked over me once more—fast, but not as dismissive as before. Something flickered in that grey gaze. Surprise, maybe, or recognition, though we'd definitely never met. Then he nodded. Not a greeting. An acknowledgment. Like I was a piece of office equipment that had turned out to be more interesting than expected.

Something hot flared in my chest.

""Walsh,"" I said, matching his tone. ""Welcome to New York. Try not to get lost.""

His eyebrows rose a fraction of an inch. For a second, something flickered across his face—surprise, definitely, that the furniture had talked back—before his expression settled into an easy, infuriating smile.

""I'll do my best."" His voice had dropped slightly, taken on an edge that felt almost like... teasing? ""Though if I do get lost, I'm sure there's a color-coded map somewhere. You seem like the type to have one.""

""The type?""

""Organized. Meticulous."" He nodded toward the mug in my hand. ""Let me guess—you have a different mug for each day of the week.""

I didn't have a mug for each day of the week. I had a mug for each *type* of day—good days, bad days, emergencies—but I wasn't about to explain my coping mechanisms to some Boston prep school reject who'd known me for thirty seconds.

Who'd looked at me like he was trying to figure me out. Like I was a puzzle worth solving.

""I have a system,"" I said coolly. ""Some of us need one.""

""And some of us don't."" He smiled, all teeth, and reached past me to grab a coffee pod. His arm brushed mine as he did it—warm, solid, close enough that I caught a hint of whatever cologne he wore. Something expensive. Something that made me want to lean closer, which was absolutely not happening.

""Interesting,"" he said, and his voice had dropped into a lower register that did things to my nervous system I refused to acknowledge.

I wanted to say something cutting. Something that would wipe that smug expression off his unfairly symmetrical face. But my brain—my stupid, forty-seven-tabs-open brain—chose that exact moment to go completely blank.

Possibly because all available processing power had been redirected to cataloguing the exact shade of grey-blue his eyes were in the fluorescent light. Possibly because I was a disaster of a human being who couldn't focus on being righteously angry when faced with cheekbones like that.

""Well,"" Walsh said into the silence, shoving the pod into the machine with the confidence of someone who'd never fought a printer in his life. ""This has been fun. I should go find my desk. Chen, good to meet you. Rivera.""

He said my name like a period at the end of a sentence. Like a door closing.

Or maybe like a door opening, just a crack.

Then he was gone, coffee cup in hand, leaving behind nothing but the faint smell of expensive cologne and the overwhelming urge to throw something at the wall.

""So,"" James said, after a moment. ""That's Connor Walsh.""

""He's a dick.""

""He seems..."" James paused, searching for a diplomatic word. ""Confident.""

""That's a generous way to put it."" I grabbed my coffee cup, mostly to have something to do with my hands. My palms were sweating. Why were my palms sweating? ""He's also—"" I stopped myself before I could say ""unfairly attractive"" or ""built like a Greek statue"" or ""the exact type of asshole I have historically made terrible decisions about.""

""Also what?""

""Nothing. Just. Annoying.""

James gave me a look that suggested he didn't entirely believe me, but he let it go.

I let out a breath I didn't realize I'd been holding. Connor Walsh had been in the building for approximately five minutes and he'd already short-circuited my brain, insulted my organizational system, and made me hyperaware of my own body in a way that felt deeply unfair.

""Hey, you want to grab lunch later? There's that new Thai place on 53rd. I've been wanting to try it, but eating alone at restaurants makes me feel like a divorced accountant.""

I blinked at the sudden topic change. ""You want to get lunch? With me?""

""That's generally how lunch works. Two people, food, maybe some conversation about how Partner Chen is going to make us review fourteen boxes by Friday."" He shrugged. ""Unless you're too busy with Ricardo.""

A joke. He was being nice. This was just James being James—the senior colleague who actually bothered to include people, who didn't make it weird that we were two gay men working in corporate law where everyone still pretended that representation was somehow new and brave even though it was 2024 and we were in Manhattan, not Mississippi.

Not that James had ever said anything explicitly. Neither had I. It was just... understood. The way we both carefully didn't react when someone made assumptions about wives or girlfriends. The way we'd developed a shorthand for navigating the partners who still asked about ""family plans"" in ways that felt pointed.

""Lunch sounds good,"" I said. ""Thanks.""

""Great."" James smiled, warm and easy. ""I'll swing by your desk around noon.""

He left, and I turned back to the Keurig, which had apparently decided to work now that it had an audience.

My reflection stared back at me from the machine's shiny surface. Dark eyes, dark hair that was definitely doing the thing in the back, a face that my mother called ""expressive"" and my sister called ""incapable of hiding a single emotion."" I wasn't ugly. I knew that objectively. My mother told me I was handsome every time we video-called, which didn't count because she was my mother. My sister told me I cleaned up well, which was her way of saying I was a disaster most of the time but could occasionally pass for presentable. The guys I'd dated in the past had seemed to find me attractive enough, even if those relationships had all ended in various flavors of ""you're too much"" or ""I can't keep up with you.""

But standing in the break room after Connor Walsh had looked at me like I was a puzzle worth solving, I suddenly felt very aware of my rumpled shirt and my coffee-stained sleeve and my hair that was definitely doing the thing.

He'd probably dated models. Or actors. Or other prep school lacrosse players with trust funds and perfect hair.

Not that it mattered who he dated. Not that I was thinking about who he dated. Not that I cared at all.

I grabbed my coffee and headed back to my desk, determined to focus on the Whitmore files and not on the way Connor Walsh had said my name. Or the way James Chen had touched my shoulder. Or the weird, electric tension that had filled the break room when both of them were looking at me at the same time.

*Get it together, Rivera,* I told myself. *You have fourteen boxes of documents to review. You don't have time for whatever this is.*

Ricardo was waiting for me at my desk, stoic and green and completely unconcerned with office politics.

""I know,"" I muttered to him, settling into my chair. ""I know. Focus. Shell companies. Tax shelters. Not hot coworkers who may or may not be checking me out.""

Ricardo, as always, declined to comment.

If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life.

I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a friend?

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

1pwhq3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/brokenbones/comments/1pwhq3h/bouncing_back_after_a_break/,Bouncing back after a break,"Just some advice after breaking my leg this summer I thought I'd share and try to help anyone who's recovering.
So this summer I was in a motocross accident and broke my leg..tibia plateau fracture. Needed surgery and the doctor put a rod bunch of pins in my leg. Said It was a really bad break and that it would be minimum  4 months non weight bearing.  For context I'm a 30 year old male. 
120 days sounded way too long to me. They sent me home in a splint with crutches and told me not to smoke. Basically all the advice they gave me. They handed me a ton of painkillers, most of which I just threw out. I know how hard those opiates are on your liver and I just figured I'd tough it out. 

I figured my body was going to need good nutrients to repair the broken bone and soft tissue. So I dialed in my nutrition. Ate 6 eggs with  a half pound of pork sausage every morning. Coffee and a bit of fruit. Usually a banana or some strawberries. Lunch was half a pound to a pound of ground beef with mashed up sweet potatoes. Dinner was a few fillets of fish, more ground beef or a pound of steak depending on the day, and russet potatoes. Very little sugar. Although I did drink alcohol a decent amount. 
This diet I described has been pretty typical for me for the last five years. By week three post surgery I decided I'd get back into the gym. My left leg was broken so I was able to drive to the gym. Used my crutches to get around. Fortunately my gym is ground level gym so no stairs needed. 
Did all upper body workouts. Lots of bench press, bicep curls, shoulder press. Anything I could do from a seated position. By about the 5th week post surgery I'd do some standing workouts such as tricep pulldowns but keep all my weight on the good leg.
I had nothing else to do so I'd spend about 3 hours in the gym 5 or 6 days a week. Made considerible strength and size gains in that time. And didn't gain any belly fat like I expected from being essentially couch ridden aside from the gym. 
Sleep was also pretty good. Would get atleast 8 hours a night. 

Weight training kept the blood moving and definitely accelerated the healing, along with the good nutrition. 
At my 6th week follow up appointment and x-ray, my doctor cleared me to walk. I didn't expect to be walking out of the hospital that day. Now I wasn't walking very well. But I was able to walk. The doctor was very surprised and said it was the fastest he had seen someone heal from such a bad fracture. 

So my advice is to dial in your nutrition, and keep moving in whatever way you are able to. Doesn't have to be weights. That was just easiest for me as my leg was broken. 

Also, just to make your life easier while you're healing, get set up for maximum comfort.
I'd assemble everything Id need for the day near the couch. I'm not big on video games but you can bet your ass I was doing some gaming while I wasnt at the gym. I was able to rent some stuff from the Red Cross for free. The wheel chair they gave me was total junk though. I went and bought my own and sent the receipt to my insurance company. Having a wheelchair made going out in public much easier. Any time I was in a business that had electric mobility scooters I took advantage of them.

My husband is ASD I’ve been a stay at home mom for the last 5 years. I just started working again last month 

I’ve never really checked his phone we have been together almost 9 years married 5 

I came home one night out a year and a half ago from my neighbours house. I went to check his phone to check our insurance. He was texting his ex-girlfriend. There was a lot of trickle truth that lasted over months, he apparently never met a girl in person, but spoke to multiple people. He’s previously slept with before us . 

It broke me huge I sent my world upside down. I started medication doing a lot better. 

I’m not stuck because I just don’t feel myself living in like I used to. I love him so much and I’ll always be his protector and Bestfriend. I just don’t know him the same way he really hurt me. He was on dating apps asked a girl for coffee, but she declined. He said he never met up with anyone in person. I think there’s more to it, but it’s the only two girls I decided to randomly reach out in message. They sent me a lot of information and screenshots. It hurt me, especially because it’s been going on for years. We have two children together.

I’ve never had an eye for another man before, my husband and I are complete opposite. I moved here five hours away from home to get sober and create a new lofe and we ended up meeting 4 months later. He swept me off my feet bought us a house at 21 and I thought we had a almost perfect life and turns out I was wrong 

I’m so hurt . 

A few weeks after I found this out, this new store opened on my town and i instantly was attracted to the owner. Would never done anything but told my bff that he was hot.

He’s been giving me a little attention since I’ve been working down the road from him I like it but it don’t feel right. 

Idk what to do. tl;dr Is it time to leave my marriage ? I have no family there they are 5 hours away 

His parents said I’d o left I would be ruining the family and that I just need to get over it ",1,1766790081.0,marriageadvice,2,1.0,False

I’m into staying active (walking, hiking, paddle boarding, trying new things), exploring coffee shops and food spots, thrifting, and just hanging out and talking about life.
