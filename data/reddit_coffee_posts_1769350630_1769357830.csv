1qmnclr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Craps/comments/1qmnclr/random_lady_shuts_down_entire_table_in_progress/,Random lady shuts down entire table in progress by spilling coffee over the felt with 1 number left to go in ATS,"So I saw something very interesting this past Friday while at Mohegan Sun.

Full table. Hot roller. Working on the 3rd Fire bet, and 1 number left to make the All.

A lady strolls up to the table holding a coffee, she leans OVER the rack and says ""ooooh what is this game how do you play?"" and as she finishes saying that drops her FULL COFFEE over the felt which spills all over. Chips and all. She's totally embarrassed, begins profusely apologizing and covering her face in shame. Everyone quickly tries to console her saying it's not that big of a deal etc we can just continue. And then....

The boxman says the table has to be shut down for cleaning and begins to return everyone's bets, pass lines, ATS and all. The game is over. Begin the pandemonium with people saying wait wait there's an ATS bet you can't do this, can we save the state of the game and transfer it over to an unopened table. Nope that's not what happens at all. Everyone gets their money back, table is closed.

Lots of arguing with multiple pit bosses that went nowhere given I saw people on that table move to other ones or just left.

So yeah. I'm not a believer in coolers at all. But if you are then I guess cooling the table with actual coffee is a way to do it.

Also don't be that lady.",1,1769357730.0,Craps,0,1.0,False

1qmnbat,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qmnbat,New to black coffee - help me pick 3 coffees for samplers.,"Hey Folks!

I'm mostly an instant + milk guy. In cafes I usually drink latte/mocha/vietnamese.

Bought a Kaldipress a few months back and now trying to move toward black coffee.

I've attached screenshots with available options from each roaster (Bloom, Kapi Kottai and BT). Can you please help me pick one 1 roaster and suggest 3 coffees from what you see in the images.

All of them have Aeropress standar/inverted grind options. Which one I should choose?

Goal is to slowly build taste for black/speciality coffee without wasting money.

I'm starting with one roaster now, can fall deeper into this rabbit hole after this.

If you have any extra beginner tips or combo suggestions, feel free to add.

Thanks!

1qmn8xa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1qmn8xa/i_just_turned_19_and_want_to_better_myself_why_am/,I Just Turned 19 And Want To Better Myself. Why Am I So Unmotivated And Difficult To Mentally Work With? You Don't Have To Read My Big Message Just Give Me Some Advice. It Was Only For Context.,"Why am I not motivated to do anything? I have autism, ADHD, active mood disorder, bipolar mixed, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety. I was diagnosed then de-diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder as well. All of these have been diagnosed across many doctors and I have a history of going to Psych-wards for depression and some ideations. I struggle to focus and remember things a lot. My memory is really bad or perhaps selective and my drive to even hyper-fixate has become lazy or undriven.

My great grandmother had schizophrenia and would mainly be non-verbal and hallucinate about aliens taking over earth and being in the front yard. Her son, my grandfather, had bipolar disorder and would lock himself in his room in bouts of I don't even know what when my dad was growing up, and all of his siblings seem to have something wrong about them—or at least that is how my dad presents it. I think my grandfather was suicidal. But later my grandfather was put on a medication that helped, but he still is a terrible driver and socially mean to people out of nowhere sometimes; but honestly, he might just be old too and has poor memory and forming of thoughts.

My father has only been diagnosed with a learning disability and dyslexia, so no autism or anything, but I almost feel like I can smell autism now that I have hyper-fixated on it so much and can see my own traits that align with autism being repeated by others who are diagnosed but didn't tell me or are being tested. I know it is a bad habit to try and diagnose people, but I just naturally do it and kind of taught myself to do it to navigate social situations. Sometimes I think I am more socially aware than my neurotypical friends but am too lazy most of the time to care to apply it.

I am no longer sad, mainly due to my medications: Levothyroxine 25 mcg, Sertraline 25 mg, Wellbutrin 150 mg, Depakote 500 mg, and I have just been taken off Paliperidone 3 mg. The reason the Paliperidone is such a low dose is because I have a very long history of being highly reactive to medications, and for some reason it would cause constant nightmares and I wouldn't be able to sleep, but eventually I got used to it and over time we lowered it to try and help my sleep. Also, I switched to Depakote a while back after being on Lithium and having way too high of a concentration of it in my blood because I would barely drink water or any liquids or remember to.

Also my memory is so bad that I never remembered to take my morning meds but only remembered to take my night time meds because they were right by my bed and for some reason I wouldn't be able to fall asleep without taking them. Specifically, if I missed my paliperidone, I wouldn't be able to sleep for all the days I didn't take it, specifically when I ran out and didn't remember or had the motivation to call and refill it.

I am an adult now and it is really hard even though I have way less responsibilities than most adults, and I can tell that. I am highly intelligent but don't even have a diploma because I just couldn't do my homework and eventually became so emotional—back when I wasn't on my current meds—that I actually became phobic of school, I think. Like, I can't go there without feeling bad and going there every day and in classes without melting down and being over-stimulated. I didn't even get my IEP around the 10th or 11th grade for autism; I got it for emotional impairment.

I had lost all of my friends and even now I struggle to control my impulsive behavior. I stream for really long hours and I can't stop myself from repeating the same memes or phrases that no one knows that would honestly get me in trouble if I didn't explain myself, or I would sing the same line in a song over and over. Now for some reason I like projecting gay ""jokes"" onto my friends when in reality I am pretty sure it is because I find the theme of homosexuality stimulating and a good stim. I am so indecisive and struggle with subjective things so immensely that I always catch myself up on the fact that there is no reason to do anything for any reason that I don't begin any action.

I legit choose to identify as agender and abrosexual when in honesty I just identify as a cis-male and maybe I am bisexual, but only dated 2 guys ONLINE when I was like 14 on Discord... (This is a note later when re-reading all of this. Basically I picked agender because I saw the vast amounts of genders as our attempt to expand gender to such an extreme point to include each unique thing about each person and how they feel different and want to be treated a specific way from the rest. Either if that stems from Dysphoria or Dysmorphia or simply you just don't align due to personal identity. I observed that people noticed that gender wouldn't go away so rather they would try to add to society's structure and norms as well as add different groups to change it from the preconceived two-group system to a fluid spectrum one that more aligned with all of their experienced realities.

I just decided not to pick a gender because I understood the same information that we were given but decided to practice what I believed, and that was to have myself and others be treated as themselves and as individuals rather than a specific category within a subject that is honestly so subjective and broad that honestly we are all simply just ourselves at the end of the day and not a specific thing that should be treated just the exact same in every way for that specific category. I do believe in identifying in ways, though, that help people best understand how to treat you. So I still align with being a man because it is hard for me to detach from the biological factor when engaging with other people in my life and how it influences my physiology and biology and it helps others with sex/gender based preferences.

To make it simple, I am just saying that I struggle with subjectivity so much that when asked what gender I am I couldn't choose, so I choose to be gender agnostic lol. I did the same thing with sexuality because I believe there are so many minute differences in every individual I just decided to pick what best described me and that was someone who feels different things at different times—sometimes feels more straight at times and more gay at times and sometimes completely asexual or grossed out by the concept of humans. Mainly after waking up and being on the bus and being in a groggy state and my mind becomes very literal with what I am seeing. Like we have these strings coming out of greasy holes in our heads. What the heck. We are just these brains floating around in liquid covered up by this weird thin layer of a bunch of little cell thing things all laid on top of each other that are somehow stuck together.

Basically I believe we shouldn't at heart pick a gender or at least understand that we are so individualistic that we are simply just ourselves at the most objective standpoint. Same thing with sexuality. You never know what could walk through that door and could get you all flustered. But I still identify with either what best describes me or fits my own desires of what I want others to see of me. Like if I use the pronouns of my birth sex then those who are interested in people with certain ""bodily aspects"" can know what I have easier. I see it as a social tool if anything lol. Also it is more convenient for communication too because if we still base English in a bi-system of he and she while other languages don't, then I feel like my best way of going at it is for some practical use for me and for those I meet.

If I am biologically male and I have features that will help our brains that evolved to pick up on those aspects then they can communicate with me and know also what bodily aspects I have. But I feel like this story is different with people who have Disorders though like Gender Dysphoria or Body Dysmorphia. I also feel like those who care about being called specific pronouns would care too. But like I have mentioned earlier, I have a very low level of care about things so a lot of things don't bother me and I am just trying to logically structure and basically turn everything into a math formula in a way. Like I said, I have autism and this is my way of navigating society.)

Literally one of the jokes I made to one of my friends recently was this: ""We know you're gay Ryan, we found all your femboy photos on a file on my computer."" Then Ryan would ask me why I had photos of femboys on my computer and why would his file of it be stored exclusively on my computer. The thing is I use offensive stuff—or I don't even know what to call it because I wouldn't say being gay is offensive—as a vice or stim to vent out something. Most of the time I am either bored or on VC with my friends.

But I am quiet when going to new places and not loud. Like at my old school I was known as loud and obnoxious, but then I changed schools in the 10th or 11th grade and was known as very quiet and didn't want to be bothered. I feel like I was a better person and human at times when I was 14 because I was in so much emotional pain that it somehow grounded me and made me humble and overly nice and formal. I am not lying that whenever I become sad it is almost like this wave sweeps over me, receding this constant state that I feel at all times that keeps me distracted, and I feel more alive and aware than ever and I feel beautiful. I feel beauty in the sadness perhaps that I have come to know it for so long, and I almost feel like at times that I should go back to it for the sake of everyone else and perhaps myself.

I worried about what would happen once I stopped being sad up until the point it happened. I knew that once it stopped I would stop caring. I became such a jerk. I became more mean and arrogant and almost felt like I was burnt out on sugar and unhealthy food and I am describing that because I am feeling it right now. It is so hard to be motivated and focus and to remember and to care and to feel anything about anyone. I have become so okay with letting go of emotional attachment to things just so I wouldn't suffer because of them.

I have lost all of my real-life friends and everyone my age is now in college. I had a conversation recently with my Arabic friend about the things happening between, I think it was either Israel and Palestine or that other thing going on between the USA and that one country I honestly can't remember. I honestly have bouts of complete lack of empathy either because of my meds or I don't even know what, but I told him that I honestly don't watch the news and that I don't worry about things beyond where I live and the people I see every day and know. I told him that it was just how I emotionally attached. I admitted that the longer I would sit there and try to invest myself into it, the more I could pull sadness out of myself by running myself through the steps of empathy, but nowadays I just don't care or feel anything.

I sometimes feel even more detached to those around me as well day by day. But I am still connected. EVERY SINGLE DAY I think about my grandfather that has passed away. I once in a while regularly think about this friend of mine that I met when I was a younger teen that was homeless and schizophrenic and off her meds and took drugs (that's discord for you lol). I didn't know to believe her on a lot of her claims though, and the day I was told that she had died from the cancer that she developed has stuck with me and I was super analytical about her death and am still not sure about it now, but it still sticks with me. I still have nightmares and dreams about all of my past friends who have left me and nightmares about my grandfather. My dreams aren't even scary a lot of the time but they are highly manipulative and would convince me that I re-became friends with those people or that my grandfather is still alive and that there was a mistake or it never happened, and I would wake up believing it until the pouring reality falls upon me and my heart breaks.

The last two times I tried re-becoming friends with a group of friends I completely had an emotional breakdown trying to talk to them or open my mouth or speak and I can't even understand it. I don't understand why my body has these reactions when my mind or myself tells me that ""it's just them"" or just another human. ""Why am I acting this way?"" It hurt so extremely bad and then we stopped being friends again or they didn't want to be friends again. I had to learn that life was quiet and lonely and wasn't some big show or theatrical story that all the music I would listen to would make me think or what my mind would come up with.

I remember coming home from a new school where I knew no one and it was way bigger than the small-town school I grew up in and I never made a single friend while there. I would feel my cold bed every day I got home and it felt like quietness and it felt like loneliness. I only really have friends online now and I am trying to do YouTube and Twitch but don't have enough focus to edit my videos and I am so socially out of touch I don't even use TikTok or Instagram or anything other than YouTube. And even then I don't watch gaming videos anymore because I always tell myself that I will wait for later when I could make a YouTube video on them, which never ever comes, and I lost a lot of interests that way and fell out of some games' lore or just some funny videos. I don't even play video games anymore unless it is with an online friend and usually for a YouTube video or streaming.

It is 5:07 a.m. and my birthday was yesterday and has ended. My grandfather who passed's wife is in the hospital and I am the only grandchild that has taken care of them while the rest of their family on my mom's side has been mean or never even would call them or help them out. My grandmother's kidneys are having problems. It has been 1 year since my grandfather has passed away. Usually the wife goes soon after.

Oh yeah, also since the age of 14 or 15 I have been dating a girl online and have never gotten the chance to meet her in person and she cheated on me and then went at it horribly when trying to handle it with me where she acted with no emotion the whole time to help my feelings and just said make a decision of if we should stay together and I felt left out on my own. And at the exact same time my last ever real life friend who was actually my first ever life-long school-met friend told me he didn't want to be friends with me anymore, and I think another friend from my past that I wanted to try and be friends with again and I offered front row tickets to my favorite band's concert to go with me told me even though he wanted to go and said yes he still doesn't want to be friends with me and at the time I think I had purchased the tickets and we still ended up going.

After all of that happened I admitted myself into an adult Psych-ward and got 7 thousand dollars in debt with no real good job because I was fired from my last job and now I just work once in a while for my dad. I now have lawyer debt because my sister put me in a court case over something that makes no sense and now I have over 10 thousand dollars in debt and I might go to jail for a month potentially and have to take anger management classes for a year just because I was shadow boxing her while she was cleaning rice for a meal and I poked her with my toe while she was laying down waiting on her food and I was waiting on my water to boil for my food. But because it was unwanted touch—even though she didn't say anything and didn't cry or react or anything which apparently doesn't matter—it still classifies as assault. I have been told it is honestly about how she felt about it, not about if it was actually me hitting her or hurting her. I was just honestly stimming and I have done it a lot growing up where I would leave my room either from being on call with my friends and being over stimulated and I vent by slightly bothering and picking on my sister. She was 17 and I was 18 but because I was legally an adult I am going to be charged potentially... I already got a warrant for my arrest and had to pay bail.

At the same time I still know I am privileged because my father lets me live with him and he buys food once in a while for me to let me eat, but he does get mad if I eat the SpaghettiOs even though he said he got an amount where each can is a dollar. But they're not only mine I think, or they are only my brother's but he doesn't eat them and we don't have many foods and I am too worried to cook and eat them without upsetting my dad because they aren't mine. I have applied to a lot of places but not many people wanted to hire me, a lot due to me not having my GED. I struggle to make it to my GED classes because of motivation or I don't remember. For some reason I feel so scared to pick up the phone or do anything honestly. I don't even refill my meds until I have been off them long enough where I am feeling horrible or am almost out and will still be off them for a couple days.

My father doesn't let me keep anything in any other section of the house other than my room. My rice cooker is in my room and all of my spices aren't allowed in the spice cabinet. I didn't even have a room at his house. I used to have to sleep out on a cot in the under-heated living room with a blanket that was quilted so it had those little holes in it and it was too short for me because I am 6'3. Also the cot was too small and eventually stretched to the point where I was just laying on the ground and it eventually ripped and broke. My dad broke up with his fiancée and her daughters moved out, which they had the only other bedroom in the house other than my dad's, and it laid there completely trashed and animals went in there and tore stuff up and ""relieved"" themselves multiple times in different ways...

There are stickers, markers, chipped paint and holes in the walls because the one daughter who is 11 or 12 now I think has a lot of mental health problems like depression and suicidal ideation and has a problem with vaping and marijuana and has a big problem with boys and to my knowledge sorta girls. I hope people understand what I mean by ""problem"" because I will not elaborate. She just put all the holes in the wall and in our bathroom. Also she got herself two cats when I asked for a cat when I went to a psych ward one time as an emotional support animal after the last time we had a cat on accident it died because my dad's fiancée introduced him and her sister to the dogs and immediately left to go to the bathroom and left them outside and one of the dogs ""Bane-Batman-ed"" him and broke his back and he died. I loved that cat and he made me feel better for some reason. He didn't last for long though.

So my dad's fiancée's daughter got two cats and when they all left after breaking up they just left them here, and even after I kept mentioning that they should get her spayed she got outside and got pregnant by a stray cat and now we have a bunch of kittens and got rid of a lot of them but still have the two original cats and two kittens and they are alright behavior and personality wise. But nothing like that one cat. I learned over time that most cats aren't as loving as the one I had all the way back then and are very self-absorbed and not very loving.

Also my family was very neglectful of all their dogs and all of them have died when we had 4; now we only have one. We had a Beagle, Great Dane, some type of duck hunting dog, and a King Charles Miniature Poodle mix. My dog was the Beagle and he died from either cancer or honestly not being regulated on his food intake. My father had them all as outside dogs and would just leave the bag of food open outside for all of them and when he died my dad said that the amount of food being consumed halved or more and I could tell that his belly or stomach was hard, almost like it was really pressured. The duck hunting dog died due to being attacked by an animal and they didn't know or didn't do anything after knowing it for a couple of days and it was my sister's dog (My sister lives with my mom because she hates my dad). The Great Dane was my Dad's fiancée's dog but they claimed it got too old and her feet were bleeding or something, but she seemed fine to me (also yes she left the dog at our house too but would bring it over to her house once in a while). They decided to put her down. The last one is the King Charles Miniature Poodle Mix. I was told he was my dad's dog but now my father says it is my brother's dog and always has been. My brother is five and is technically my half-brother and was made between my Dad and his fiancée.

Honestly this all turned into a vent and I just wanted some advice on what I should do or anything that has helped out others with autism or similar conditions as me. So please try and comment some advice down below. Like what can I do to motivate me? Or what can I do to understand empathy and morals when they are all subjective and cultural and societal and biased? How can I make a decision? How do I get myself to do those decisions? Are there any remedies like oils or vitamins or coping techniques or therapies?

Also I am curious about Azstarys because Markiplier mentioned it and I'm curious about people's opinion on it of those who have taken it. I don't want to be recommended medical advice by non-medical professionals and would at least be recommended questions that I can ask my primary care doctor about. Also I have done horrible on stimulants. But seem to do fine on Wellbutrin I think, but I don't know if it is the paliperidone or something else but I can't drink coffee anymore or really big caffeine things without shaking a ton and feeling bad and having behavior problems. Also shrimp makes me sick now but that might just be a getting older thing. I used to love shrimp.",0,1769357518.0,AutisticWithADHD,2,0.5,False

Avishkar here — founder & CEO of Muziclly, India's fast-growing music education platform Global. Started everything from Hyderabad, India. Life moves fast in entrepreneurship — exciting wins mixed with real stress, long nights, and moments when you just need someone solid to talk to.

I'm looking for one special female friend (platonic at the core) who can be there in a real way:

Personally — someone to share daily life updates, Hyderabad vibes (food runs, drives, city chaos), laughs, and random thoughts

Emotionally — deep, honest conversations about feelings, dreams, fears, what keeps us going, and supporting each other through ups/downs

Professionally — bouncing ideas, giving/receiving advice on business, growth, balance, or creative pursuits (music/tech/whatever you're into)

I'm open to this evolving into a true partnership (business/life/personal) if we discover we're exceptionally aligned and it feels right for both — but only if it's organic and mutual. No pressure, no expectations — starting as friends who actually care and add value to each other's worlds is the goal.

A bit more about me: Late 30s, grounded, ambitious but value real human connection over superficial stuff. Love music (obviously), good coffee spots, midnight reflections, meaningful talks, and keeping things light with humor when needed.

If you're a confident, kind, emotionally intelligent woman (any age/location, but bonus if India/Hyd-related) who wants a reliable friend with depth, ambition, and genuine support — and you're tired of surface-level chats too — please comment or message me.

Tell me a little about you: What's one thing you're passionate about right now, or something that's been on your mind lately? Let's see if we vibe.

Looking for quality over quantity — hope to hear from the right person. 🌃

About me: turning 38 (thus the sudden urge to be deep), female, Asian.

I love dogs, coffee, watching the snow, and walking down cherry blossom tree alleys.

Why Am I So Unmotivated And Difficult To Mentally Work With? You Don't Have To Read My Big Message Just Give Me Some Advice. It Was Only For Context.,"Why am I not motivated to do anything? I have autism, ADHD, active mood disorder, bipolar mixed, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety. I was diagnosed then de-diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder as well. All of these have been diagnosed across many doctors and I have a history of going to Psych-wards for depression and some ideations. I struggle to focus and remember things a lot. My memory is really bad or perhaps selective and my drive to even hyper-fixate has become lazy or undriven.

My great grandmother had schizophrenia and would mainly be non-verbal and hallucinate about aliens taking over earth and being in the front yard. Her son, my grandfather, had bipolar disorder and would lock himself in his room in bouts of I don't even know what when my dad was growing up, and all of his siblings seem to have something wrong about them—or at least that is how my dad presents it. I think my grandfather was suicidal. But later my grandfather was put on a medication that helped, but he still is a terrible driver and socially mean to people out of nowhere sometimes; but honestly, he might just be old too and has poor memory and forming of thoughts.

My father has only been diagnosed with a learning disability and dyslexia, so no autism or anything, but I almost feel like I can smell autism now that I have hyper-fixated on it so much and can see my own traits that align with autism being repeated by others who are diagnosed but didn't tell me or are being tested. I know it is a bad habit to try and diagnose people, but I just naturally do it and kind of taught myself to do it to navigate social situations. Sometimes I think I am more socially aware than my neurotypical friends but am too lazy most of the time to care to apply it.

I am no longer sad, mainly due to my medications: Levothyroxine 25 mcg, Sertraline 25 mg, Wellbutrin 150 mg, Depakote 500 mg, and I have just been taken off Paliperidone 3 mg. The reason the Paliperidone is such a low dose is because I have a very long history of being highly reactive to medications, and for some reason it would cause constant nightmares and I wouldn't be able to sleep, but eventually I got used to it and over time we lowered it to try and help my sleep. Also, I switched to Depakote a while back after being on Lithium and having way too high of a concentration of it in my blood because I would barely drink water or any liquids or remember to.

Also my memory is so bad that I never remembered to take my morning meds but only remembered to take my night time meds because they were right by my bed and for some reason I wouldn't be able to fall asleep without taking them. Specifically, if I missed my paliperidone, I wouldn't be able to sleep for all the days I didn't take it, specifically when I ran out and didn't remember or had the motivation to call and refill it.

I am an adult now and it is really hard even though I have way less responsibilities than most adults, and I can tell that. I am highly intelligent but don't even have a diploma because I just couldn't do my homework and eventually became so emotional—back when I wasn't on my current meds—that I actually became phobic of school, I think. Like, I can't go there without feeling bad and going there every day and in classes without melting down and being over-stimulated. I didn't even get my IEP around the 10th or 11th grade for autism; I got it for emotional impairment.

I had lost all of my friends and even now I struggle to control my impulsive behavior. I stream for really long hours and I can't stop myself from repeating the same memes or phrases that no one knows that would honestly get me in trouble if I didn't explain myself, or I would sing the same line in a song over and over. Now for some reason I like projecting gay ""jokes"" onto my friends when in reality I am pretty sure it is because I find the theme of homosexuality stimulating and a good stim. I am so indecisive and struggle with subjective things so immensely that I always catch myself up on the fact that there is no reason to do anything for any reason that I don't begin any action.

I legit choose to identify as agender and abrosexual when in honesty I just identify as a cis-male and maybe I am bisexual, but only dated 2 guys ONLINE when I was like 14 on Discord... (This is a note later when re-reading all of this. Basically I picked agender because I saw the vast amounts of genders as our attempt to expand gender to such an extreme point to include each unique thing about each person and how they feel different and want to be treated a specific way from the rest. Either if that stems from Dysphoria or Dysmorphia or simply you just don't align due to personal identity. I observed that people noticed that gender wouldn't go away so rather they would try to add to society's structure and norms as well as add different groups to change it from the preconceived two-group system to a fluid spectrum one that more aligned with all of their experienced realities.

I just decided not to pick a gender because I understood the same information that we were given but decided to practice what I believed, and that was to have myself and others be treated as themselves and as individuals rather than a specific category within a subject that is honestly so subjective and broad that honestly we are all simply just ourselves at the end of the day and not a specific thing that should be treated just the exact same in every way for that specific category. I do believe in identifying in ways, though, that help people best understand how to treat you. So I still align with being a man because it is hard for me to detach from the biological factor when engaging with other people in my life and how it influences my physiology and biology and it helps others with sex/gender based preferences.

To make it simple, I am just saying that I struggle with subjectivity so much that when asked what gender I am I couldn't choose, so I choose to be gender agnostic lol. I did the same thing with sexuality because I believe there are so many minute differences in every individual I just decided to pick what best described me and that was someone who feels different things at different times—sometimes feels more straight at times and more gay at times and sometimes completely asexual or grossed out by the concept of humans. Mainly after waking up and being on the bus and being in a groggy state and my mind becomes very literal with what I am seeing. Like we have these strings coming out of greasy holes in our heads. What the heck. We are just these brains floating around in liquid covered up by this weird thin layer of a bunch of little cell thing things all laid on top of each other that are somehow stuck together.

Basically I believe we shouldn't at heart pick a gender or at least understand that we are so individualistic that we are simply just ourselves at the most objective standpoint. Same thing with sexuality. You never know what could walk through that door and could get you all flustered. But I still identify with either what best describes me or fits my own desires of what I want others to see of me. Like if I use the pronouns of my birth sex then those who are interested in people with certain ""bodily aspects"" can know what I have easier. I see it as a social tool if anything lol. Also it is more convenient for communication too because if we still base English in a bi-system of he and she while other languages don't, then I feel like my best way of going at it is for some practical use for me and for those I meet.

If I am biologically male and I have features that will help our brains that evolved to pick up on those aspects then they can communicate with me and know also what bodily aspects I have. But I feel like this story is different with people who have Disorders though like Gender Dysphoria or Body Dysmorphia. I also feel like those who care about being called specific pronouns would care too. But like I have mentioned earlier, I have a very low level of care about things so a lot of things don't bother me and I am just trying to logically structure and basically turn everything into a math formula in a way. Like I said, I have autism and this is my way of navigating society.)

Literally one of the jokes I made to one of my friends recently was this: ""We know you're gay Ryan, we found all your femboy photos on a file on my computer."" Then Ryan would ask me why I had photos of femboys on my computer and why would his file of it be stored exclusively on my computer. The thing is I use offensive stuff—or I don't even know what to call it because I wouldn't say being gay is offensive—as a vice or stim to vent out something. Most of the time I am either bored or on VC with my friends.

But I am quiet when going to new places and not loud. Like at my old school I was known as loud and obnoxious, but then I changed schools in the 10th or 11th grade and was known as very quiet and didn't want to be bothered. I feel like I was a better person and human at times when I was 14 because I was in so much emotional pain that it somehow grounded me and made me humble and overly nice and formal. I am not lying that whenever I become sad it is almost like this wave sweeps over me, receding this constant state that I feel at all times that keeps me distracted, and I feel more alive and aware than ever and I feel beautiful. I feel beauty in the sadness perhaps that I have come to know it for so long, and I almost feel like at times that I should go back to it for the sake of everyone else and perhaps myself.

I worried about what would happen once I stopped being sad up until the point it happened. I knew that once it stopped I would stop caring. I became such a jerk. I became more mean and arrogant and almost felt like I was burnt out on sugar and unhealthy food and I am describing that because I am feeling it right now. It is so hard to be motivated and focus and to remember and to care and to feel anything about anyone. I have become so okay with letting go of emotional attachment to things just so I wouldn't suffer because of them.

I have lost all of my real-life friends and everyone my age is now in college. I had a conversation recently with my Arabic friend about the things happening between, I think it was either Israel and Palestine or that other thing going on between the USA and that one country I honestly can't remember. I honestly have bouts of complete lack of empathy either because of my meds or I don't even know what, but I told him that I honestly don't watch the news and that I don't worry about things beyond where I live and the people I see every day and know. I told him that it was just how I emotionally attached. I admitted that the longer I would sit there and try to invest myself into it, the more I could pull sadness out of myself by running myself through the steps of empathy, but nowadays I just don't care or feel anything.

I sometimes feel even more detached to those around me as well day by day. But I am still connected. EVERY SINGLE DAY I think about my grandfather that has passed away. I once in a while regularly think about this friend of mine that I met when I was a younger teen that was homeless and schizophrenic and off her meds and took drugs (that's discord for you lol). I didn't know to believe her on a lot of her claims though, and the day I was told that she had died from the cancer that she developed has stuck with me and I was super analytical about her death and am still not sure about it now, but it still sticks with me. I still have nightmares and dreams about all of my past friends who have left me and nightmares about my grandfather. My dreams aren't even scary a lot of the time but they are highly manipulative and would convince me that I re-became friends with those people or that my grandfather is still alive and that there was a mistake or it never happened, and I would wake up believing it until the pouring reality falls upon me and my heart breaks.

The last two times I tried re-becoming friends with a group of friends I completely had an emotional breakdown trying to talk to them or open my mouth or speak and I can't even understand it. I don't understand why my body has these reactions when my mind or myself tells me that ""it's just them"" or just another human. ""Why am I acting this way?"" It hurt so extremely bad and then we stopped being friends again or they didn't want to be friends again. I had to learn that life was quiet and lonely and wasn't some big show or theatrical story that all the music I would listen to would make me think or what my mind would come up with.

I remember coming home from a new school where I knew no one and it was way bigger than the small-town school I grew up in and I never made a single friend while there. I would feel my cold bed every day I got home and it felt like quietness and it felt like loneliness. I only really have friends online now and I am trying to do YouTube and Twitch but don't have enough focus to edit my videos and I am so socially out of touch I don't even use TikTok or Instagram or anything other than YouTube. And even then I don't watch gaming videos anymore because I always tell myself that I will wait for later when I could make a YouTube video on them, which never ever comes, and I lost a lot of interests that way and fell out of some games' lore or just some funny videos. I don't even play video games anymore unless it is with an online friend and usually for a YouTube video or streaming.

It is 5:07 a.m. and my birthday was yesterday and has ended. My grandfather who passed's wife is in the hospital and I am the only grandchild that has taken care of them while the rest of their family on my mom's side has been mean or never even would call them or help them out. My grandmother's kidneys are having problems. It has been 1 year since my grandfather has passed away. Usually the wife goes soon after.

Oh yeah, also since the age of 14 or 15 I have been dating a girl online and have never gotten the chance to meet her in person and she cheated on me and then went at it horribly when trying to handle it with me where she acted with no emotion the whole time to help my feelings and just said make a decision of if we should stay together and I felt left out on my own. And at the exact same time my last ever real life friend who was actually my first ever life-long school-met friend told me he didn't want to be friends with me anymore, and I think another friend from my past that I wanted to try and be friends with again and I offered front row tickets to my favorite band's concert to go with me told me even though he wanted to go and said yes he still doesn't want to be friends with me and at the time I think I had purchased the tickets and we still ended up going.

After all of that happened I admitted myself into an adult Psych-ward and got 7 thousand dollars in debt with no real good job because I was fired from my last job and now I just work once in a while for my dad. I now have lawyer debt because my sister put me in a court case over something that makes no sense and now I have over 10 thousand dollars in debt and I might go to jail for a month potentially and have to take anger management classes for a year just because I was shadow boxing her while she was cleaning rice for a meal and I poked her with my toe while she was laying down waiting on her food and I was waiting on my water to boil for my food. But because it was unwanted touch—even though she didn't say anything and didn't cry or react or anything which apparently doesn't matter—it still classifies as assault. I have been told it is honestly about how she felt about it, not about if it was actually me hitting her or hurting her. I was just honestly stimming and I have done it a lot growing up where I would leave my room either from being on call with my friends and being over stimulated and I vent by slightly bothering and picking on my sister. She was 17 and I was 18 but because I was legally an adult I am going to be charged potentially... I already got a warrant for my arrest and had to pay bail.

At the same time I still know I am privileged because my father lets me live with him and he buys food once in a while for me to let me eat, but he does get mad if I eat the SpaghettiOs even though he said he got an amount where each can is a dollar. But they're not only mine I think, or they are only my brother's but he doesn't eat them and we don't have many foods and I am too worried to cook and eat them without upsetting my dad because they aren't mine. I have applied to a lot of places but not many people wanted to hire me, a lot due to me not having my GED. I struggle to make it to my GED classes because of motivation or I don't remember. For some reason I feel so scared to pick up the phone or do anything honestly. I don't even refill my meds until I have been off them long enough where I am feeling horrible or am almost out and will still be off them for a couple days.

My father doesn't let me keep anything in any other section of the house other than my room. My rice cooker is in my room and all of my spices aren't allowed in the spice cabinet. I didn't even have a room at his house. I used to have to sleep out on a cot in the under-heated living room with a blanket that was quilted so it had those little holes in it and it was too short for me because I am 6'3. Also the cot was too small and eventually stretched to the point where I was just laying on the ground and it eventually ripped and broke. My dad broke up with his fiancée and her daughters moved out, which they had the only other bedroom in the house other than my dad's, and it laid there completely trashed and animals went in there and tore stuff up and ""relieved"" themselves multiple times in different ways...

There are stickers, markers, chipped paint and holes in the walls because the one daughter who is 11 or 12 now I think has a lot of mental health problems like depression and suicidal ideation and has a problem with vaping and marijuana and has a big problem with boys and to my knowledge sorta girls. I hope people understand what I mean by ""problem"" because I will not elaborate. She just put all the holes in the wall and in our bathroom. Also she got herself two cats when I asked for a cat when I went to a psych ward one time as an emotional support animal after the last time we had a cat on accident it died because my dad's fiancée introduced him and her sister to the dogs and immediately left to go to the bathroom and left them outside and one of the dogs ""Bane-Batman-ed"" him and broke his back and he died. I loved that cat and he made me feel better for some reason. He didn't last for long though.

So my dad's fiancée's daughter got two cats and when they all left after breaking up they just left them here, and even after I kept mentioning that they should get her spayed she got outside and got pregnant by a stray cat and now we have a bunch of kittens and got rid of a lot of them but still have the two original cats and two kittens and they are alright behavior and personality wise. But nothing like that one cat. I learned over time that most cats aren't as loving as the one I had all the way back then and are very self-absorbed and not very loving.

Also my family was very neglectful of all their dogs and all of them have died when we had 4; now we only have one. We had a Beagle, Great Dane, some type of duck hunting dog, and a King Charles Miniature Poodle mix. My dog was the Beagle and he died from either cancer or honestly not being regulated on his food intake. My father had them all as outside dogs and would just leave the bag of food open outside for all of them and when he died my dad said that the amount of food being consumed halved or more and I could tell that his belly or stomach was hard, almost like it was really pressured. The duck hunting dog died due to being attacked by an animal and they didn't know or didn't do anything after knowing it for a couple of days and it was my sister's dog (My sister lives with my mom because she hates my dad). The Great Dane was my Dad's fiancée's dog but they claimed it got too old and her feet were bleeding or something, but she seemed fine to me (also yes she left the dog at our house too but would bring it over to her house once in a while). They decided to put her down. The last one is the King Charles Miniature Poodle Mix. I was told he was my dad's dog but now my father says it is my brother's dog and always has been. My brother is five and is technically my half-brother and was made between my Dad and his fiancée.

Honestly this all turned into a vent and I just wanted some advice on what I should do or anything that has helped out others with autism or similar conditions as me. So please try and comment some advice down below. Like what can I do to motivate me? Or what can I do to understand empathy and morals when they are all subjective and cultural and societal and biased? How can I make a decision? How do I get myself to do those decisions? Are there any remedies like oils or vitamins or coping techniques or therapies?

Also I am curious about Azstarys because Markiplier mentioned it and I'm curious about people's opinion on it of those who have taken it. I don't want to be recommended medical advice by non-medical professionals and would at least be recommended questions that I can ask my primary care doctor about. Also I have done horrible on stimulants. But seem to do fine on Wellbutrin I think, but I don't know if it is the paliperidone or something else but I can't drink coffee anymore or really big caffeine things without shaking a ton and feeling bad and having behavior problems. Also shrimp makes me sick now but that might just be a getting older thing. I used to love shrimp.",1,1769357222.0,AutisticAdults,0,1.0,False

Yet, most of us still wake up feeling like we’ve been hit by a truck, or we hit that brutal mental wall at 2 PM.

The reality? Your body doesn't care about 'generic' rules. It cares about Circadian Alignment.

Every single biological process—from cortisol spikes and insulin sensitivity to deep sleep cycles—is governed by an internal clock that is unique to you. When your lifestyle (work, meals, caffeine, light) is out of sync with that clock, you’re not just tired; you’re operating in a state of biological chaos.

I’ve spent the last year working with data scientists to solve this. We’ve built CircadiaAI.

It’s not a tracker. It’s a predictive engine. It maps your unique rhythm and tells you exactly when your brain is primed for deep work and exactly when your window for high-quality restorative sleep opens.

""Lars, you’re an old fool! The fog is so thick out there, even the seagulls are walking! What do you expect to catch? Pneumonia?""

Lars only sighed, pulling on his salt-crusted parka. ""I have to go, Maren. Olaf is already waiting.""

""Of course he is! You’re only going out so you don't have to fix that fence!""

Maren tossed a plastic bag at her husband’s head. ""Take that Temu junk of yours too! At least your hand won't freeze to your beer can while you're 'working'!""

\* \* \*

More than thirty miles away, on the bridge of the USS Gerald R. Ford, Captain Miller stared out at the icy swells in the dim, blood-red light of the command center. Barely two weeks ago, they had been off the coast of Venezuela, engaged in ""gunboat diplomacy"" where the entire point was to be seen and heard. There, visibility was the mission.

This, however, was different.

The order had come directly from the Vice President, known in the wardrooms only as ""No Chance Vance."" They wanted Greenland, and the strategy was insultingly simple: ""It’s easier to ask for forgiveness than permission."" The plan: land the Marines in total secrecy, plant the flag, and wake the Danish government the next morning with an ""unbeatable offer"" and a fait accompli.

Miller hated it. But he hated it even more that the latest ""security purity sweeps"" had stripped him of his best sonar technician, Rodriguez. In his place was Petty Officer Parker  — a kid from Nebraska whose only qualification seemed to be a ""pure"" and ""spotless"" family tree.

Especially now, under EMCON Alpha, the safety of the entire ship depended on those two green ears...

\* \* \*

Three old friends had been shivering in the boat for hours: Lars, Olaf, and the Tuborg Grøn. Lars gave a slow, weary nod, and Olaf began hauling in the longline. But as the hooks broke the surface, they brought nothing but a few clingy starfish and a single, tattered gray Walmart bag.

""The Americans sent us a bag for the fish,"" Olaf remarked, tearing the plastic from the hook. ""Truly kind of them. The only thing missing is the fish.""

""Let’s go around that iceberg. We’re bound to find something at the shelf break,"" Lars said, his voice grumbling in unison with the engine, which he’d finally kicked into life.

The old diesel’s shaft was bent in every possible direction. It made a rhythmic, metallic racket—like someone had dumped a handful of pebbles into a coffee grinder that had seen better days—but it had never let them down.

Little did they know that they weren't the only ones listening to the old engine's clatter that night...

\* \* \*

Petty Officer Parker hadn’t signed up for combat. It was supposed to be four years of service for the GI Bill and a guaranteed degree — that was the deal. When he’d enlisted, the Navy was still about stability. But by the time they reached the North, the fleet was no longer a peacekeeper; it was an aggressive real estate agent in the Arctic.

Only yesterday did it all truly hit home.

He’d been rushing out of the shower for a surprise drill—wet hair, a lopsided tunic, bare feet shoved into boots. In a cramped passageway, he’d rounded a corner and slammed right into someone. The Master Chief hadn’t screamed. He just stood there, measuring the recruit with a frost-bitten gaze.

""Do you even know the name of this ship, Petty Officer?"" ""USS Gerald R. Ford, Sir!"" Parker barked, trying to snap to attention. ""To you, maybe, son. But we aren’t at home anymore. Out there, in the dark, this ship has only one name: Target. Stop running around half-dressed and do your job.""

Parker rubbed his eyes in front of the console. Target. The old man’s words echoed in his head. Then, suddenly, at bearing zero-eight-two, a thin, sharp yellow line slashed through the blue of the monitor.

*\[CLASSIFICATION:UNCERTAIN\]\[POSS.SOURCE:NON-MILITARY/BACKGROUND NOISE – 85%\]*

Parker’s eyes narrowed. The computer was reporting ""background noise,"" but he could hear the grinding of metal.

""No, that’s not noise,"" he muttered. ""It’s too rhythmic.""

""Combat, Sonar! New contact, surface, bearing zero-eight-two!"" he shouted into the mic. ""Strong narrowband signal, heavy mechanical beating. Acoustic profile unidentified, likely using individual masking. Based on signature characteristics, this is a large displacement combatant or a heavy submarine snorkeling with advanced cloaking. Bearing is constant, range is closing rapidly. We are on a collision course!""

\* \* \*

Meanwhile, the “heavy submarine” reached the shelf break. Olaf dropped the anchor into the water with the routine of a seasoned admiral.

Until two years ago, he had been the commander-in-chief of the Black Sea Fleet, until a devastating Mediterranean cyclone brought his brilliant career to an end. The cyclone was named Kendra. In her short but all the more noisy rampage through Olaf’s life, Kendra hadn’t just reduced the entire Black Sea Fleet’s 1:5000 scale model collection to splinters with a single well-aimed soup tureen; she had also wiped out his self-esteem and his sincere admiration for Mediterranean women.

Lars quickly lowered the hooks, then, under Olaf’s watchful eye, noisily fished a plastic bag out of his pocket. Finally, he took out a small black rectangle and pressed a button. The little black box emitted strange, high-pitched sounds, like a bagpiper with a cold.

“What’s that? A pocket radio?” Olaf asked suspiciously. “A hand-warmer,” Lars replied resignedly. “And why is it singing?” “I don’t know. Maybe they swapped the box in Xiangdonghuangsung.” “Chinese?” “Yes, but it could still work, couldn't it?”

The hand-warmer was now trying to imitate an amateur organ tuner, but Lars quickly grew tired of it.

\* \* \*

The AN/SLQ-32(V)7 antenna system was unfazed by the fog swirling around the USS Gerald R. Ford; it saw right through it — perhaps too well.

Captain Miller heard the EW technician reporting a weak detection of a wide-spectrum search radar from bearing 081 to the Tactical Action Officer.

“Advanced stealth propulsion, unidentified radar pattern... Who are these people? No known NATO forces in the sector. A Russian Yasen-M? Perhaps the Swedes? Their Gotland-class would be capable of such tricks, but they don't play hide-and-seek in allied waters...”

“Silent alert,” Miller commanded the TAO. “Set the ship to Condition Zebra. Helmsman, ten degrees to port. Slow turn, maintain twelve knots.”

“Then who?” the captain wondered. “The French? Impossible... The Chinese?”

Miller recalled the intelligence reports on China's Arctic ambitions. Whoever it was, they wouldn't be scanning so boldly in active mode if they were alone.

“Are we late, or were they waiting for us?” he asked himself while watching the bearing. One wrong move, one hasty active ping on the radar, and we’ll go down in history as the ones who triggered a war with Red China.

On the digital chart table, the red line began to drift. As the Ford turned, the bearing shifted from 081 to 080, then 079.

“Target is stationary, sir. It is not following the maneuver.”

Miller was about to respond when the red spike on the display suddenly disappeared.

“They’ve gone dark,” Miller whispered. “They’ve spotted us.”

\* \* \*

“What’s that noise? A helicopter? In this fog?” Olaf asked.

“Must be the VIKING,” Lars shrugged. “You know Erik… ever since he bought that beat-up old bug-sprayer chopper, he’s been up every night.”

“Ford Center, this is Spartan 701. Approaching position, preparing to lower dipping sonar.”

“Spartan 701, Ford Center. Copy that. Be advised, negative contact on target. Good hunting!”

“He’s out of his mind flying in this weather. Let’s help him out before he splashes,” Olaf said, digging a flashlight out of the emergency kit.

Olaf clicked the Super-Tac 5000 on and off, over and over. Then he started banging it against the boat’s gunwale. As usual, that didn’t help at all. It didn’t help much either that he began listing the entire family tree of the Super-Tac’s manufacturers using several unflattering adjectives. The only thing the persistent banging achieved was a spreading crack in the casing—and a faint buzz from somewhere inside.

At that moment, barely 300 meters to their south and 30 meters higher, a small indicator light flickered on, and the helicopter's cockpit was suddenly filled with the rhythmic shrieking of the RWR.

“Ford Center!” Thompson’s voice jumped two octaves. “I’m locked on! Repeat: active targeting from the north!”

Before Ford could respond to the pilot’s frantic message, Lars glanced at the open emergency box and had a bright idea.

“Drop that piece of junk, Olaf, the batteries must be dead,” he said, pulling a distress flare from the kit.

Inside the helicopter, the FLIR monitor exploded in white. The infrared sensors were momentarily overloaded by the thousands of degrees of heat erupting in close proximity.

“Ford Center, missile in the air!” the pilot screamed into the radio, pulling the collective lever with all his might. “DEPLOY FLARES!”

A sequence of magnesium decoy flares launched from Spartan 701’s side dispensers. The blinding white orbs hissed as they fell into the sea, while the helicopter surged upward, desperate to evade Lars’s lethal missile-flare.

“Good Lord!” Olaf laughed. “Look at that, Lars! He’s doing fireworks! You think it’s his birthday?”

“I don’t know,” Lars grumbled, “but it’s hard to imagine a more effective way to scare off the fish.”

\* \* \*

“Well? Where is it? Or do I need to help you haul it in?”

“Where’s what?” Lars asked tiredly, taking his seat at the kitchen table.

“The catch, Lars! The fish!”

“Oh, Maren… we didn’t catch a thing. I don’t think I would’ve even gone out if you hadn't made such a fuss about it.”

“I fried you some fish sticks. Frozen. I knew there wouldn’t be any catch today,” Maren said, her tone softening slightly.

“That damn Erik and his helicopter scared off all the fish… he was even doing fireworks out there!”

“Erik? Haven’t you heard? He’s been in Copenhagen for days! He was picked for the Eurovision Song Contest.”

Lars just hummed, lost in thought, absently fiddling with the short-circuited hand warmer.

“Let me guess: it didn’t work. Just like that self-stirring mug you got me last time,” Maren said.

The man gave a long, defeated sigh. “Maren… why are you always right?”

“Can I throw it out then? The house is starting to look like a flea market.”

Lars thought of the strange helicopter and the lights.

“No… who can say what destiny this may yet hold?”

I was thinking of creating a small group for **Bangalore-based Harley-Davidson X440 owners** who’d like to meet up occasionally.

The idea is simple:

* Casual weekend rides 
* Coffee/tea meetups 
* Sharing ownership experience, mods, service tips, etc.
* Just good conversations around the bike

beginners and experienced riders both welcome.  
If you own an **X440** and this sounds like your vibe, drop a comment or DM. If there’s enough interest, we can move it to WhatsApp/Telegram later.

This isn’t anti-DIY — just pro-skin barrier.
1️⃣ Patch test is not optional
Even “natural” ingredients can cause reactions.
Always patch test DIY products for 24 hours (behind ear or inner arm).
2️⃣ Rose water doesn’t moisturize
It feels nice, but it evaporates quickly.
If you use it, always follow up with a gel or moisturizer.
3️⃣ Honey mask: less is more
Raw honey works best on slightly damp skin.
10–15 minutes is enough.
Longer time won’t give extra benefits.
4️⃣ DIY scrubs can hurt your skin
Sugar, salt, coffee scrubs can cause micro-tears.
If you still use them, limit to once in 10–14 days and be extremely gentle.
5️⃣ Fresh aloe vera spoils fast
Fresh aloe gel lasts 2–3 days max without preservatives.
Refrigerate it and don’t store long-term.
6️⃣ DIY sunscreen is a hard NO
There’s no safe way to measure SPF at home.
Please use tested, regulated sunscreen only.
7️⃣ “Natural” doesn’t mean safe
Lemon, baking soda, undiluted essential oils = barrier damage.
pH matters more than trends.
8️⃣ Clay masks are not daily skincare
Once a week is enough.
Overuse leads to dryness and sensitivity.
9️⃣ Simple routines work best
Cleanser → Moisturizer → Sunscreen
DIY is best for occasional care, not daily replacement.
Final thought:
DIY skincare is fun, but healthy skin comes from consistency, barrier care, and patience — not hacks.

1qmmwsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/aitaweddings/comments/1qmmwsb/aita_if_i_exclude_my_brothers_fiancé_from_my/,AITA if I exclude my brother’s fiancé from my wedding?,"My (33F) brother (30M) has been with his now fiancé (24F) for 3 years. She’s the first person he’s ever dated. At first I thought she was fine. Very quickly though, I noticed that at least half the time when she was around our family she would be having a temper tantrum about something and would literally give our entire family the silent treatment and sulk in a corner. To give an example of the kind of temper tantrums- one time she apparently forgot her swimsuit on a lake trip (which I didn’t realize) so I made the mistake of asking her if she was going to go tubing. She angrily gestured at her outfit, and ran into the basement and I heard from my other sibling that she sobbed for hours. She gave my entire family the silent treatment at a very, very close family friend’s funeral because- she told me later- it was her “birthday week” and she didn’t want to spend it at a funeral. Once I asked her if she wanted to get her nails done with me some time and she literally pretended she didn’t hear me. So I repeated myself more loudly and she still didn’t acknowledge my invitation so I knew then that she just wasn’t interested.

Around the 8mo mark of them dating, I expressed concerns to him about her behavior around our family. They were planning to move in together about 35 minutes away (I know- not far at all- the rest of our family all lives within a 7 minute drive of one another, so I do think it’s relevant for context) and I was worried that we wouldn’t see him anymore and that eventually when they got married she wouldn’t even involve our family in their wedding. Seriously, those were the only two concerns I expressed. He said he understood, but he loves her and he would be intentional about keeping a close relationship.

Our family is very close, not in an over-the-top or overbearing way at all, but especially since the death of our older brother our family relationships are very sacred. So they move in together and we never see him. It’s been 2.5 years. This year, they spent Thanksgiving, Christmas, and the 10 year anniversary of my brother’s car accident with her family. In the meantime, I met a man who loves my family. He cares for my grandmother who has Alzheimer’s. She even remembers his name! Which is a huge deal because she doesn’t remember ever having met my brother’s fiancé, who she’s met a dozen times. He watches sports with my dad. He usually spends time with his family who lives in the same area that my brother and his fiancé live in about once a week. We celebrate Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve with my family, and Christmas with his family. I realize that my fiancé is an extraordinary example rather than the standard, but I say all of this because our jobs and social lives are SO busy but we always make time for family.

My brother announced in our family group text that he was going to propose one weekend over the summer. They were going to go for a walk at one of their favorite trails and he would pop the question. Relevant because this was a flexible plan that could have easily been changed. My fiancé had planned a trip out to my favorite island that weekend, and I was certain that he’d also be proposing. I knew that my brother’s fiancé would not want to get engaged on the same weekend. I texted him, called him, had my fiancé called him, my mom reached out… he assured us that he’d discussed the possibility that we would be getting engaged at the same time with her and that she was totally cool with it. I thought ok well it wouldn’t be my first choice because I don’t want to step on her toes and she doesn’t seem like someone who would like that but we already have this trip planned and tbh I love my brother and thought it would be kinda dope to get engaged on the same weekend IF we had her blessing and it’s just kind of how the cookie crumbled. She didn’t think it was dope, and I looked like the bad guy because my fiancé proposed a little over 24 hours after my brother did.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about my bridal party. As the only girl in a family of boys and as a family who have lost a sibling, it’s been a non-negotiable to me to include my brothers. In addition to my 4 best friends, I decided to ask my brothers’ partners to be my bridesmaids so that my brothers would be included in our wedding party. I explained all of this to her, and that the only expectation I have of my bridesmaids is to show up in a dress and take cute pictures with me. As soon as I asked her, I felt instant regret. There was no feigned excitement, no hug… my fiancé even awkwardly laughed and said “I think you’re supposed to say yes!” She didn’t participate in the group text. She didn’t choose a dress.

She asked me to get coffee yesterday, and told me that she’s too busy with “bigger things” to participate in my wedding. I explained that I didn’t invite her because of any delusion that we were best friends, but as an invitation to have a relationship and a way to include my brother. I reminded her that I’m not having a bridal shower or a bachelorette party and that the \*only\* thing I’m asking of my bridesmaids is to wear a dress that is one of three colors (any style, any material) and take some cute pictures. I told her that I had sensed that she didn’t want to participate, and that I certainly don’t want anyone to participate who doesn’t want to. She talked extensively about how bad her relationship is with my brother, and it feels unlikely after hearing the way that she spoke about it that they will make it to their wedding day.

Now that she has declined my invitation to begin a relationship, can I uninvite her from my wedding? I don’t want to see her on my wedding day, and I certainly don’t want to look back at my photos and see this woman who has blatantly rejected mine and my whole family’s bids for connection. I just don’t want to pretend anymore. I’m feeling like “okay then- if you have chosen not to participate in family relationships, you don’t get to participate.”

I’m afraid that if I uninvite her from the wedding, or even tell her that she can’t be in our family pictures, my family will accuse me of damaging the family and being hateful. AITA?",7,1769356797.0,aitaweddings,5,0.89,False

Hey everyone,

I’ve been obsessing over simple binary choices lately (Coffee vs. Tea, Dark Mode vs. Light Mode, etc.).

I had a hypothesis: Can an algorithm predict random facts about a person based solely on their answers to these trivial ""This vs. That"" questions?

To test this, I built a service that runs calculations on user choices to see if there are hidden correlations in the data. Basically, I'm trying to see if knowing your preference for ""Pineapple on Pizza"" can actually help a model predict other random demographic facts or habits.

It’s a fun side project/experiment, but I’ve put some work into the backend logic.

I’d love for you guys to try it out and roast the predictions (or the UI).

For a moment, he didn’t move. His back hurt. The carpet was rough against his cheek.

“Ethan,” his mom said from the doorway. “Why are you on the floor?”

He pushed himself up slowly, heart already starting to race. The memory hit him all at once—the breathing, the shape in the dark, the word relic.

“I—I don’t know,” he said. “Must’ve rolled off the couch.”

She frowned but didn’t press it. “You scared me. I thought you passed out.”

“I’m fine,” Ethan said quickly. Too quickly.

She checked her phone. “I have to get to work. There’s food in the fridge. Don’t stay up all night again.”

“It’s the weekend,” Ethan blurted.

She paused. “Yeah. I know.” Then she forced a smile. “I’ll be back later.”

The door closed.

The house went quiet.

Ethan stood there for a second, listening. No breathing. No footsteps.

But the image of the thing from last night wouldn’t leave his head.

His eyes went to the coffee table.

The coin was gone.

His chest tightened. He searched the couch cushions, the floor, under the table. Finally, he found it half-hidden near the TV stand.

The moment he picked it up, it pulsed—slow, steady, like a heartbeat.

“This is what you were talking about,” he muttered. “This is the relic.”

His phone buzzed.

Jack.

“Yo,” Jack said. “You alive?”

“Yeah,” Ethan said. “Listen… can you come over? I need to tell you something.”

There was a pause. “You sound weird.”

“Just come over.”

Ten minutes later, Jack was in Ethan’s living room, arms crossed as Ethan paced.

“So,” Jack said, “you’re telling me you saw some… thing in your house?”

“I didn’t imagine it,” Ethan snapped. “It spoke. It said this—” He held up the coin. “—was a relic.”

Jack stared at it. “That’s a coin.”

“It glows,” Ethan said.

Right on cue, the coin pulsed faintly.

Jack’s smile faded. “Okay. That’s… new.”

A loud thump came from upstairs.

Both of them froze.

Another sound. Footsteps.

Jack grabbed the broom from beside the door. “If this is a prank—”

“I don’t mess around like this,” Ethan said, grabbing the TV remote because it was the closest thing to him.

The attic ladder creaked.

Jack swallowed. ""What was that?”

They climbed slowly, every step loud in the silence.

Boxes were overturned. Something moved.

A shape stumbled forward and hit the floor with a heavy thud.

Ethan and Jack both shouted and started throwing whatever they could grab.

“Stop!” the thing said.

Its voice was rough, but clear.

“I am not here to hurt you.”

Jack froze. “That’s not what things that don’t hurt people usually say.”

The creature slowly raised its hands. It was tall, its form wrong in ways Ethan couldn’t explain.

“I need answers,” Ethan said, his voice shaking. “Start talking.”

The creature hesitated. “I am Asura.”

Silence.

“My name is Kaelon.”

Jack glanced at Ethan. “That’s… not helping.”

Kaelon’s eyes moved between them. “Who among you carries the relic?”

Ethan looked down at the coin in his hand.

“This?” he said.

Kaelon’s gaze locked onto it.

“Yes,” he said quietly.

Then his expression shifted—confusion, disbelief.

I came here when I was 19. I was an intern making 15k a month. Things moved fast after that. I worked hard, got better quickly and somehow nine years passed.

Now I have 9 years of experience, work at a FAANG, own a house, married, have a kid, and earn around 5 lakhs a month.

Life is good. Honestly yes.

I have a mutton shop guy who gives me meat without bones if I just go there without asking him. At my usual coffee place I just sit down and the waiter already knows what I want. I don’t even have to think much anymore.

And that’s exactly the problem.

There are no real challenges left. No pressure. No hunger. Everything feels… settled. Too settled.

Recently I rejected a Japan offer from a motor company. Around 15 million yen. I always dreamed of going to Japan so saying no hurt more than I expected. I still feel bad about it.

I also rejected a Staff Engineer role at a gaming company in Hyderabad. They tried really hard to convince me. I felt bad for them too but I just didn’t feel like going.

There’s another verbal offer from a media streaming company in Bengaluru. I still can’t decide. I keep delaying, hoping clarity will magically appear.

Lately, I feel messed up.

I feel like I escaped the matrix too early. I got stability, money, and comfort at a young age, but now I don’t know what I’m chasing anymore. I’m not unhappy, but I’m not excited either. It’s like life is on autopilot.

I don’t know if this is burnout, fear, privilege guilt, or just boredom masked as gratitude. I don’t even know what question to ask.

I’m not broke. I’m not struggling. I’m not depressed in the usual sense.

But I feel lost.

There's been a couple of slip ups around the holidays. Last Saturday I made a super impulsive decision to drink for a football game I wanted to watch on TV. I had just gotten out of work and looked across the street at this Irish pub that I like (they have good food too). Seeing all the happy tipsy football fans, I didn't give a single moment to talk myself out of it. Just walked across the street and ordered a Guinness. Well, that one Guinness ended up being 8 drinks by the end of the game.

Drove my ass home. Stupid. The morning after was rough too. That old hangxiety. I didn't shit the bed or anything, but I did have a minor fuck up that got me thinking a lot about my drinking habits. I do this thing in the shower when I'm hungover where I sit in a ball in the tub and let the hot water wash over me while I'm feeling miserable. This time I decided to turn it into a bath and I filled up the tub. Well there's apparently a leak somewhere near the faucet and water ended up leaking to the garage all over the place and now the drywall in the ceiling probably needs to be replaced. This is an unintended effect of drinking, and although minor compared to so many other stupid scenarios that drinking has brought to me throughout my life, it was a moment to pause and really think about what I'm doing to myself and now my property lol. To top it off, my son had a flag football game last Sunday and I had to drag myself to the game to feel miserable the whole time. A real shame...

Today, this Sunday, I woke up bright and early. I'm now enjoying my coffee writing this.

She’s bringing up the idea of soon cutting off every form of intimacy. Am I overthinking by thinking I can’t do anything about it?,"It’s been a rough week. Thank you to everyone who helped me figure things out and finally stand up. She’s handling it way better than I am which I’m thankful for. Anyways back to the main thing.

We met up at a Starbucks nearby, got our coffee and sat in the car. I told her I wanted to talk about something that’s been on my mind for a while and I think she knew what I was going to say. I held her hand the whole time and told her I wasn’t mad or upset at her, but there’s been some things lingering on my mind.

First off, with the no sexual intimacy part of the story. There was no cheating at all involved and if I’m going to be honest with you guys, having that thought mentioned destroyed me mentally and I hate that it was brought up in the first place. Again, someone on my last post was right and it was a religious decision, although not by her. Her parents found out that we were being intimate quite often and according to her, they threatened to tell the church and have them intervene.

Before I start, I’m not making this into a religious hate post.

I’m going to be honest, I’ve never been a big fan of church. Sure, I don’t mind religion and I don’t doubt that’s there’s some “good” churches but I feel like that’s where some of that “Christian hate” comes from. Her parents are very controlling of her when it comes to her personal life, even financially as well.

Now for the no intimacy at all, things got a bit confusing. She said she only brought it up because of a bad experience she had with an ex and thought it was normal to do in a relationship. Think of like fights when both sides want some time apart, she thought she needed to say that part. I just told her that she could’ve told me she wanted time apart instead of saying no more intimacy.

I also asked her if I messed up at any point in our relationship. She said I didn’t but there’s been a few disagreements between us but it never impacted our relationship. I asked if I was too much for her and she said only sometimes. After that she started talking a lot about her life being constantly busy and her parents never giving her freedom, school was too much, and personal life got overwhelming at times.

At that time I knew she wasn’t ready for a relationship. I let her finish talking and I told her that things weren’t working out. She cried for a while and told me not to leave her as she doesn’t have anyone else. I told her we can still talk but our relationship can’t last much longer if we keep being this way. I told her that even if we still stayed together, it would’ve ended way worse and we would go no-contact. She cried for a bit more and I held her close while trying to comfort her. 

I’m really hoping she’s not holding out for hope in the future. I told her that I had no regrets at all about our relationship, I enjoyed the trips we took around the state, and that I would do it all over again. I think I fucked up by telling her that but what’s done is done. 

Before she left, i let her calm down a bit and told her everything would be fine. I gave her a hug, kissed her, and we went out separate ways. Honestly, I only text her to see how she’s doing and she only texts me for any questions she didn’t have a chance to bring up but she’s been handling it way better than i am. 

I’ve been feeling alone for the past week and as one commenter mentioned on my last post, I am attached to her. I’ve been doing a few things to keep my mind busy and it does help every now and then, but other than that I feel alone. My friends are out of state and for some reason, my only friend that stayed here has been avoidant? Anyways, it’s going to be rough in the near future but everything should be okay.",4,1769356606.0,relationship_advice,5,0.75,False
1qmmt5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlecloud/comments/1qmmt5j/generally_minimal_a_25k_surprise_in_google_clouds/,Generally Minimal: A $2.5k Surprise in Google Cloud's Cross-Region Egress,"**Before the story:**

Yes, I read the community “unexpected invoice” guide and already did the basics (stop/delete workloads, stop GCS access, SKU breakdown, support cases).  
This is an incident report.  
**I’m not here to debate pricing tables or blame any individual support agent.**

I’m posting because this incident exposed systemic failures in the TRC + Billing + Risk stack — and the “resolution” so far has been slow, fragmented, and (from the user side) bizarrely passive:

• TRC docs say non-TPU costs are “**generally minimal**.” In my case, “minimal” meant \~USD $2.3k in a few days (pre-tax) and an invoice for \~USD $2.4k (tax included). The wording is still there. Still no warning label.

• A 1,769,800,400% spike had no circuit breaker. I was the circuit breaker.

• The “unusual spike” alert arrived \~10–12 hours after I already stopped everything.

• During an active dispute, automation still ran the invoice + overdue + 3-day suspension + “suspicious activity” combo.

• TRC ↔ Support handoff was so good I became the internal message queue. Adorable.

If this is the expected TRC experience, TRC should state it explicitly. If it’s not, then this is a correctness + product safety bug in how research accounts are handled.

**My concrete question:**

How does a researcher who follows the documented TRC setup (TRC zones + GCS + high-throughput training) end up in this full failure chain?

What part of the system decides: “you followed the docs, therefore you get the 3-day suspension countdown + payment-profile risk enforcement”? And why doesn’t it auto-pause when the user has stopped workloads and opened an active dispute?

**Why I’m posting:**  
TRC’s welcome email says participants are expected to “share detailed feedback with Google to help us improve the TRC program.”

**This is my feedback.**

Again: I’m not posting this to fight about dollars. I’m posting it because the process felt humiliating as a cooperative user and operationally unsafe for any team that cares about guardrails. Until they fix the docs or the detection/enforcement coupling, every time I see “Generally Minimal,” I’m going to hear:

“Roll for Sanity. On fail, lose \~$2,500 in 5 days.”

⸻

**\[Update: Jan 25, 2026\]** *Status: Dispute ""approved"" but math is wrong (partial refund only). Still waiting for \~$500. Still locked out of TPUs. Grant expiring.*

⸻

**TL;DR:**

• Got into Google’s TPU Research Cloud (TRC) as a PhD student.

• Followed official docs: TPUs in TRC zones + GCS + high-throughput streaming.

• Triggered cross-region egress SKUs and got a 1,769,800,400% cost spike.

• I self-detected and mitigated first. The “unusual spike” email arrived 10–12 hours later.

• During the investigation, automation escalated into a 3-day suspension countdown and “suspicious activity” flags.

• I also received an official invoice for \~USD $2.4k (tax included) while the dispute was still active.

• The eventual adjustment was partial: a credit of USD $1,777.36 (not a clean reversal).

• TRC and Support handoffs were siloed enough that I became the message queue.

• Final irony: I only got \~5 days of actual “free TPU time.” The rest of the “30-day grant” wasn’t spent training models — it was spent training Google Support to talk to each other. 🫠

⸻

**Act I – “Congratulations, your TPUs are free… mostly”**

I’m a PhD student working on deep learning. Late December, I got the golden email:

“Your project now has access to… 64 v6e chips… free of charge for 30 days.”

Cool. Even better, the TRC FAQ explicitly reassures me:

“Participants can expect to utilize small VM instances… as well as Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets… These costs are generally minimal.”

I read that as: “TPUs = Free. Storage = Coffee money.” I did not read it as:

“Welcome to Egress Casino, please place your life savings on trans-Atlantic streaming.”

I assume “Generally Minimal” is Google-speak for “It’s minimal compared to the GDP of a small nation.”

**Failure mode #1: misleading expectation-setting.**

If “generally minimal” collapses the moment you do normal high-throughput training with the recommended architecture, then the documentation is not just optimistic — it’s operationally unsafe.

⸻

**Act II – Doing exactly what the docs told me**

My setup was standard:

• TRC-approved TPUs in europe-west4-a & us-east1-d.

• Dataset in GCS (Standard Region).

• Data pipeline: WebDataset, high-throughput streaming.

This wasn’t some cursed architecture I invented at 3 AM. It’s literally “take the docs seriously and push them to the limit.”

On Dec 31, everything finally clicks. The model runs. Throughput goes up. TPUs are happy. I’m happy. Somewhere in Google’s infra, a tiny daemon starts screaming.

I even went out for New Year’s like a normal human being — because I genuinely thought I had finally “made it work.”

⸻

**Act III – The 1,769,800,400% Plot Twist**

On Jan 1, being a paranoid researcher, I logged into the console. I saw it immediately:

This was after I got home from New Year’s — I opened the console expecting a boring flat line, and instead got a financial jump-scare.

[Suprise! 🤗](https://preview.redd.it/71rpzse3nifg1.jpg?width=2383&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dcc54faad2d0446a13bd4a7ca07eaab3a8ffbda7)

The anomaly summary stated:

“Cloud Storage had the largest nominal change in costs of **1,769,800,400%** compared to the previous period.”

1.7 Billion Percent. Apparently, I speed-ran Google’s anomaly chart from “flat line” to “vertical wall.”

For context, if my baseline cost was a cup of coffee, this spike bought the entire Starbucks franchise.

And yes — the root cause was exactly what you’d guess: **cross-region egress**.

In the breakdown, the biggest offenders were SKUs like:

• GCS data transfer between North America and Europe (the trans-Atlantic boss fight)

• Inter-region data transfer out (e.g., Netherlands → Americas)

Basically: “Congratulations, you discovered that a ‘free TPU grant’ can still route you through paid global networking.”

**Crucial Detail:**

    1. **I discovered this first.**
    
    2. I immediately **stopped** workloads, **deleted** TPUs, **stopped** GCS streaming/access, and **reported** it with evidence.
    
    3. **10–12 hours later**, I finally received the automated “Unusual cost spike” email.

**Failure mode #2: anomaly detection latency + lack of circuit breakers.**

It felt like anomaly detection was operating as delayed reporting, not incident response.

If this had been a real key compromise, a small lab could be bankrupt before the “AI-powered” monitoring even woke up.

Extra plot twist: the console also showed a forecast implying this could have escalated to **\~USD $21k** if I hadn’t caught it early.

Seeing a $21k forecast on a PhD stipend is a spiritual experience. It’s the kind of number that makes you consider a career change to something safer, like bomb disposal.

⸻

**Act IV – The 3-Day Suspension Countdown**

This is where it stops being funny.

While the investigation was still in progress, automation escalated into:

• a formal invoice landing in my inbox for \~USD $2.4k (tax included)

• overdue notices

• a **3-day** suspension countdown

• payment profile “suspicious activity” restrictions

I wasn’t ignoring anything. I was the person who self-reported, mitigated, and cooperated.

**Failure mode #3: dispute-unaware automated enforcement.**

It felt like two systems were running independently: one investigating, one threatening — and a third one auto-generating paperwork like it was trying to hit a KPI.

The question I genuinely want answered:

**Why 3 days???????**  
What exactly triggers the “3-day suspension” path?  
Is it a cost-velocity threshold? a risk score? a “zero-grace” policy?

Because from the outside, it looks like I unlocked some rare cloud achievement:

Speedrun a billing anomaly → receive an invoice → start the Fraudster% Any% suspension timer.

If this is a “standard” automation path, it’s a weird honor — and I’d love to know the rule that grants it.

⸻

**Act V – Support Handoff Design: Customer as Message Queue**

At some point, TRC and Support essentially told me (in different words):

• TRC can’t decide billing outcomes.

• Support should “mention TRC” and reach out to TRC for clarification.

So the process turned into:

**me → TRC → me → Support → me → TRC →** **… (repeat)**



⸻ 

**Act VI – Partial Credit: the most comedic “resolution” format**

Eventually, an adjustment was applied — USD $1,777.36 as a credit adjustment.

I’m grateful any adjustment happened at all.

TRC had told me that cases like this have a “100% resolution rate.” In that context, it’s hard not to read “resolution” as “clean closure,” not “partial credit and go do more paperwork.”

But in context, it felt absurd: after a chain of systemic failures (misleading docs → delayed detection → dispute-unaware automated enforcement → siloed handoffs), the “resolution” arrived as a partial credit, not a clean reversal, leaving me to follow up yet again on what was covered and what wasn’t.

Apparently, Google’s AI can pass the Turing Test, but their Billing department is still struggling with 4th-grade arithmetic. I’m currently writing a tutorial for them on how Total\_Bill - Partial\_Refund != 0.

⸻

**What I Learned (Other than “Egress is Lava”)**

If you are a researcher or startup touching TRC:

    1. **Never trust “Generally Minimal.**” That phrase belongs in marketing, not in high-throughput technical FAQs.
    
    2. **Budget caps first, science second.** Especially if you are crossing regions.
    
    3. **Cross-region egress is not a fee — it’s a jump-scare mechanic.** “Free compute” is easy mode; networking is the hidden final boss.
    
    4. After this, I interpret anything “GCS-related” as “stand next to a landmine.” I value my life, so I’m done: **I’m not touching any GCS-related services again. Ever.**
    
    5. And the funniest part? I checked: that “generally minimal” line is **still sitting on the official FAQ page** — no warning label, no footnote, no “by the way cross-region egress can log you out of your life.”
    
    6. If the system can’t distinguish “good-faith user who self-reported and stopped workloads” from “malicious actor,” the blast radius isn’t just financial — it’s trust.

⸻

In the end, I unintentionally provided an end-to-end audit of GOOGLE’s product stack — documentation, anomaly detection, automated enforcement, and support handoff design.

Just a request.,"I lied to my wife because things right now are really bad and I'm stressed out and literally have nothing. I told her that I was playing too rough with the cat because telling her I self-harmed because I'm overwhelmed isn't going to be a productive conversation.

We've got nothing at the moment except for water from the faucet. Ran out of coffee. Ran out of food. Ran out of cigarettes. She got a $10 Xbox card so I could subscribe to Xbox game pass and play my stupid games, only to find that the $10/month tier only has 50 games you can play, and none of them are the games I play. So that's a stupid waste of $10.

Running out of my psych meds, still waiting for my new psychiatrist appointment. 

Tried to get my asthma inhaler and COPD inhaler filled only to find out they don't deliver meds, and it's going to cost $5 for both meds, and another $1.75 for a bus pass. But it won't matter because they are closed today and according to the app, the pharmacy is on strike starting tomorrow morning (Monday the 26th)...

I'm not asking for money. Just good vibes. The universe always seems to make us wait until the very last minute and then swoops in and everything works out.

But I'm tired. Really tired. I can't keep living. Not like this. Not realizing we can't get to food banks, and don't get money until the 3rd of next month, and I just sit here with my headphones on, trying to distract myself with music. Not realizing I'm going to run out of meds. That I have to wait until we get paid to go get my blood work done and meet my physical therapist for my knee and my back and to get to radiology department for a full body MRI with contrast because of everything wrong with my insides.

I feel like I'm already dead inside and I'm just going through the motions because I just don't have the balls to do anything drastic. 

Sorry for ranting and rambling.

# 15 – Danger Close

When he felt like he could move his legs without falling, he took a small step to his left.  The door to the living room was that way, and he was facing this way toward the foyer, and that was about as much information as he had just then.

He felt the fringe of the Persian rug, knowing the step down was just past it.  He felt carefully for it with his boot, finding the edge of the step, and lowered himself into the living room.

He turned his head left, then right.  The crickets, the sound of the whole outdoors, was very directional, coming from right where his vestibular system told him it should be—the open back door and broken window.

But that made him realize, belatedly and to his annoyance, that the broken glass on the floor would be useful as an indicator, as a tell.  He wasn’t certain if he should have explored over there more thoroughly, but he did know he would’ve liked to have known the extent of it.  He intimately knew the space between the breakfast table, the island, the door, and the window.  Thinking back, he tried and failed to determine where exactly he’d been standing when he had felt the broken glass under his boot.  Somewhere by the window, he knew, but that wasn’t a revelation.

He was standing in the corner of the living room, facing toward the kitchen.  After pausing there, he realized he was having difficulty intuiting how far away the larger of the two sofas was.  He took a careful, slow step to the left, then another

He felt around until he found the corner of the big rug, and after some concentration he visualized where the loveseat was.  More importantly, that told him where the gap was so he wouldn’t trip over the shin-height coffee table.

The rug was of little help once he was in the middle of it; he couldn’t find the edge where it disappeared under the loveseat.  His toe accidentally found one leg of the coffee table—gently, he was glad—and that informed him where it was in general.

This was not the spot he’d pick if the house was secure, nor was it even close to a spot he’d pick if he could see.  He was gambling, making decisions with such limited information that they might as well be coin flips.

He settled on one end of the living room, roughly the middle of the long wall.  There was no reason for it except he didn’t want to go back upstairs.  He didn’t really want to go through the kitchen again unless he had to, and he probably knew this room as well as any room in the house.

He slowly took a knee, cradling the carbine in both hands, and he waited.

Whatever tricks that might exist for tracking time in one’s head were lost on him.  He’d never had to do it before in any serious way.  Either he’d had the means to tell time himself, or someone told him when it was time to do something—or timing was largely irrelevant and things like distance or location were the important factors.

He knew he was kneeling there long enough for his right knee to start to ache, something that only happened rarely, and the little toe of his right foot went numb.  He guessed twenty, thirty minutes.

He didn’t expect to hear the aircraft, just based on his experience, but he heard this one.  A humming noise that floated in and out of his perception, growing recognizably louder but always faint.  He had no idea what kind of plane it was, but he could tell it was a prop plane, not a jet, definitely not a helicopter.

It just started to fade away, to the point he almost lost it in the noise of the trees and crickets, when he heard the ***whump*** from the front yard.

*Steven wasn’t joking*, he thought, *and whoever pitched it out of that plane earned their money.*  There was an art to those kinds of things.  One could raise the odds of a good drop through timing and careful flying, but there was technique to it that couldn’t be taught from a book. 

*Would have been nice if it landed in the back yard though*, he thought a moment later.

He was closer to the back yard, and the door was already open.  He knew the yard pretty well, and there was very little to trip over out there.  If he still cared about being quiet—he did—the wet grass and the natural sounds outside would mask him.

He rose, his knee protesting.

He felt his way around the coffee table, skirting the loveseat, intuiting his way through the space between them.  He felt the edge of the rug and followed it to the corner, around the big sofa.

The step up into the kitchen was further away than he pictured it, and that momentarily disoriented him.  He raised his foot, expecting to find the step, and when it wasn’t there he was forced to put it down mid-wobble.  He shuffled forward a few inches and tried again.  He just barely found it, and had to adjust himself mid-step.

*You’re moving too fast*, he told himself.

The long wait in the living room had lulled him into…not calmness, but focus.  The sound of the package landing brought a familiar excitement.  It felt good to have an objective, something tangible.  This felt less reckless and more challenging: difficult, not impossible.

Orienting toward the door was relatively simple.  He took the opportunity to explore the broken glass, but carefully and slowly.  There wasn’t nearly as much in front of the door as he’d thought.  He found another piece with the toe of his boot, very cautiously feeling ahead before he stepped.  He found a second piece, feeling it and hearing it at the same time as it made a soft but sharp scaping sound against the tile.  It didn’t break, just shifted.  He moved around it, found another small piece, and moved around that one.  He wound up in a slightly awkward, off-balance position that he immediately disliked under these circumstances.

He felt the threshold of the back door—unlike the others this one didn’t surprise him, he knew it was there. There was a step-down onto the back deck, and as his boot reached it, it felt slippery.  Mid-step, the wet, painted wood under his boot squeaked as his weight shifted.

He paused, the sound of the yard and the woods surrounding him.  It felt much cooler out here than inside the house.  He wondered for the first time if the power was even on.  *You’d have heard it*, he realized after a moment, and he felt foolish.  *No air conditioning, no fridge.*

He felt slightly more comfortable just then, knowing he was standing in near-total darkness on his back deck.  He liked the dark, he did some of his best work in it.  No LED flood lights, the ones that normally bathed the whole yard in bright blue-white light.  No light from the neighbors’ houses, what little even made it into his yard at night.  No streetlights.  Nothing but the tiny low-power infrared pulser on his roof, the one so dim you needed special goggles or cameras to resolve.

He didn’t know if the darkness actually levelled the playing field, but it was comforting.  His blindness felt less like a crutch.",1,1769356326.0,redditserials,1,1.0,False

I’ve been with my boyfriend for five months, it has been amazing but we’re reaching a point of constantly arguing and resolving things so that we don’t cross each others boundaries (that is irrelevant, but i thought to bring it up).

My boyfriend did a semester abroad in fall 2024 and made a lot of friends there. One of them is a girl whos my age and while they don’t constantly talk anymore, they do send each other reels. Once, she called him while I was there and they talked for a long long time on the phone. It’s important to mention that they haven’t seen each other since the end of the fall 2024 semester. 
I don’t mind him having girl friends, or girl best friends, but my problem/ discomfort started because he hasn’t told her we’re together and we’re serious. I’m not sure if this is a problem or if i’m overthinking, as i’ve never been in a relationship before. But it does bother me with the amount of times they talk or exchange reels or randomly call each other up that he hasn’t brought this up with her.

Additionally, another friend of his that he made during his exchange semester is now doing an exchange semester at our university. He just went to meet her right now and they went out for a coffee together. We were sitting together right before he left and she had texted him asking when they’re going, so he replied saying that he was with his friends and he’ll meet her at 5. what bothers me here is that he didn’t mention that he wasn’t actually with his friends and preferred to lie rather than say he was with his girlfriend. When he did that, I let him know that it’s okay to say that he’s with his girlfriend and i’d prefer that, but he stuck to his original wording.

Can someone let me know if i’m overthinking this? Or if i’m reading too much into it? Thank you all.",3,1769356304.0,relationship_advice,14,1.0,False

\* 2tsp (10g) sugar - this makes a darker chocolate profile; double it if you want it sweeter

\* 2tsp (10ml) water

\* Milk

I mix the cocoa and sugar in a small dish, add the water, and stir like mad until everything is dissolved and I have a thick syrup. while I'm stirring I'll put the milk in the frother and get it hot. Normally I just add the directly but today I made coffee in my moka pot and used it instead (plus a little milk foam after making my kid a regular hot chocolate). My only two regrets:

1. I didn't grind the coffee as fine as usual so it's a bit weaker.

2. The syrup was cold so the final mocha was also not super hot.

1qmmghf,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1qmmghf/thinking_about_messaging_someone_who_took/,Thinking about messaging someone who took interest in me…,"About ten years ago, I was in my early twenties working as a receptionist and at a popular yoga studio that closed down after the pandemic. It was one of my first jobs and at the time I was vying to get a position as an instructor at this studio, so I made myself available to be a substitute teacher there too. Back then, I had really long hair and somewhat feminine features; so it would sometimes make me the target of unwanted attention. In comes this guy, let’s just call him Kris: he’s maybe 3 or 4 years older than me, tall, blonde, slender, and sharp features. Objectively he was a handsome guy and he seemed friendly enough. He’d come in regularly to class, where we’d exchange hellos and casually chit chat before class. Nothing really that deep. That was until I subbed a class that he attended.

It was pretty obvious he had some experience in yoga, so as any teacher would do, I complimented Kris on his form and graceful movements. I didn’t think much of it, but he on the other hand might’ve interpreted it as something more. He’d start showing up to the studio on days I was scheduled to work at the front desk. It started with us stealing glances of each other then he would linger around the lobby longer than usual before & after class just to chat with me, sometimes at risk of arriving to class late or distracting me from other costumers.

I could tell he liked me, and while I was flattered I was there for work first and foremost; I kept our interactions friendly and courteous, but nothing beyond that. Yes, I fancied him but in truth I was aroace (which I didn’t know at the time) so I didn’t have any romantic/sexual attraction to him, especially when I later found out that he was already at had a boyfriend (not important, but he was was at least a couple decades older than Kris). But having a boyfriend apparently didn’t stop Kris from making advances to me.

One day, I’m signing people into class. Kris comes in five minutes late to class and is in a hurry to get in. Without warning, he reaches behind the front desk and reaches for a lock of my hair and holds it in his hand saying I have beautiful hair. I was a bit in shock but I quickly blurted out thanks and ushered him to the class. While class was in session, I called the studio manager and told her about the interaction. She could tell I was bit shaken up so she told me to that she’ll be coming over to the studio to take over my shift so she could talk to Kris after class and that I can have the rest of the day off.

After she had her talk with him, it appeared that he canceled his membership. I didn’t see him again afterwards. The whole experience just left a bad impression on me: so I cut off all my hair (which is still keep short) and I avoided getting involved in relationships with men and intimacy in general. I moved on from my experience as best as I could by focusing on my career but every now and then I think of all the “what if” scenarios if I reciprocated Kris’ advances. Even though I was put off by his forwardness, I also felt a little something for him if I were being totally honest with myself. Had he asked me to coffee or lunch instead of hitting on me while I was actively working at my job, I really think things could’ve gone differently.

Skip to present time, I begrudgingly reactivated my Facebook account after years of being inactive so I could change my password.

1qmmewa,https://www.reddit.com/r/doctorsUK/comments/1qmmewa/preop_fastingwhy_do_we_do_this_latest_research/,Pre-Op Fasting...Why Do We Do This? [Latest Research Update],"**The time is near.**  
You’re lying in pre-op. It’s 7 am.  
You haven’t eaten in precisely 12 hours and 37 minutes. 

Some joker in scrubs asks if you’re hungry.  
*“Yes, Kevin Hart* 🙄.” You think to yourself.  
*“I’m starving. I’m also wondering why I’m being tortured”*

For almost 80 years, pre-op fasting has been the way.  
Craving a cup of canteen yoghurt? Forget it.  
Want a coffee with milk? We may have to PHQ-9 you for suicidal ideation.

You see, the big bad word we're trying to avoid is **aspiration**. 

In 1946, a Dr Mendelson first documented the link between aspiration of gastric content and lung injury.  
In the 50’s, studies came out and concluded that **gastric volumes of >25m**l or a **pH <2.5** increased the risk of aspiration. However, these studies were done in **animals** like pigs and monkeys(it was the 50’s 🤷)

Although accepted as markers for aspiration, the endpoints were **never shown to predict aspiration or pulmonary complications in humans.** 

So the motto has been *better safe than sorry,* and we’ve been fasting ever since. 

That was until this group of unruly researchers did a study and claimed there was…

https://preview.redd.it/tqrw00pcmifg1.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c7de26559e131582df601f6a78eb519d2ca7fb5

Very bold. Let’s investigate. 

This meta-analysis and systematic review, published in [***Surgery***](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0039606025003356)**,** took an alternative approach to fasting and aspiration. 

The aim was this:

Rather than looking at proxy measures(gastric volume or pH), it decided to look at **human-witnessed aspiration** as the primary outcome. Then, pool all relevant studies to see if preprocedural fasting actually increases aspiration and pulmonary complications in humans. 

The team looked far and wide for adult studies of differing fasting regimes that reported on clinical aspiration, gastric volume and pH. After purging and screening over 3500 RCT’s and observational studies between 2016 and 2023, they landed on **17 key papers** included in the final analysis. 

What did they find?

Well… **No association between preprocedural fasting and witnessed pulmonary aspiration.** 

* **Odds Ratio:** For aspiration between fasting and non-fasting groups was not **statistically significant.** **1.17** (95% CI: 0.32 to 4.23, P = 0.81)
* **Aspiration Events**: extremely rare, occurring in **0.5%(4 out of 801)** of patients in experimental groups compared to controls.
* **Gastric Volume & pH Surrogates**: While some items (e.g. milk) did increase gastric volume, many practices like chewing gum or drinking clear liquids up to 2 hrs before had **no appreciable effects.** 

https://preview.redd.it/rsgs20pcmifg1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=febd59b47fc94861b1aec399213de7425a9701ec

They even went so far as to do a special test called a **Trial Sequential Analysis** that indicated that doing more studies is unlikely to disprove these results. It’s reached *“statistical futility”* 

The results sound pretty damning… the top huncho of the study took to [*X to flex his findings*](https://x.com/ehlJAMA/status/1936398733715075481), and a heated debate between anesthesiologists and surgeons ensued. 

*“Aspiration occurred in 4 of 801 patients (incidence of 0.50%) in experimental groups and 7 of 990 patients (0.71%) in control groups. A 30% increase is enough to justify fasting… in large hospitals these are dozens of aspirations every year…”*

*“Not finding a difference is NOT the same as proving one does not exist. Your low event numbers could miss even a HUGE effect size…based on the posted table you’ll still have cancelled cases”*

*“A rare event that can be devastating when it happens. And when it does the surgeon washes their hands and points at the anaesthetist. I won’t have a surgeon manage my nil per os protocol.”*

Have a [**look for yourself**](https://x.com/ehlJAMA/status/1936398733715075481)**.**

I read a post yesterday  that really spoke to something I’ve wanted to address for quite a while: how new filmmakers, and film students fresh out of college should (and absolutely should not) approach the real world.

Many of us who’ve been doing this for a few decades have our own origin stories. You know the ones: walking twenty miles to school in the snow, uphill both ways, barefoot, etc. That’s not what I want to talk about.

What I *do* want to address is the other story the one I see getting worse, not better: new filmmakers who are a little too big for their shiny new britches.

So, inspired by that post, here’s a very simple plea. When reaching out to people who are actually working in this business, please **do not** do the following:

**Do not introduce yourself as an “experienced” \[fill in the blank\].**

If you’ve been doing this for less than five years, you’re not experienced.

If you’re fresh out of film school and worked on 75 *film school* projects, you are *definitely* not experienced.

You need to understand how ridiculous that sounds to people who’ve paid years of dues—working for free, working for garbage wages, doing jobs no one wanted. It immediately tells us that not only do you think you’re ready to step onto a professional set and offer advice, but that you also don’t respect the people who actually earned their place there.

Everyone was new once.

How you handle being new will largely determine how long you stay in this business.

Here’s a real-world example from just this past year while I was developing *Outcast Nation*.

Up until *Outcast*, I one-man-banded every film I made because I couldn’t afford help. For *Outcast*, I knew it was an important film and that I needed a dedicated B-cam and an assistant. Given the subject, trans homeless youth in NYC, I also knew that assistant shouldn’t be another old cis white guy.

So I posted an ad on Backstage. No experience required—just a love of documentary filmmaking.

I got *a ton* of responses. As a side note: to give you an idea of how little work there is out there, I heard from people with as much experience as me, or more, willing to work for the $500 I was offering for the entire shoot. I had to tell them they were wildly overqualified.

I narrowed it down to two candidates. Neither had *any* experience. No camera work. No sets. Nothing.

I laid out the project and told them there was a very real chance it would end up on PBS. They both said yes.

I needed one day to shoot B-roll for the trailer and asked one of them if they wanted to come along. I told them I’d be shooting A-cam and would hand them my iPhone rigged for BTS. They agreed.

We spent the day walking Manhattan streets shooting boring but necessary B-roll. I talked through my process, how documentaries get developed, how decisions get made. Foundational stuff. I thought it was a good day.

Later, when I asked if they wanted to help on an upcoming interview, the response was:

“Sorry, I can’t work unless I’m getting paid.”

**Jettison intern #1.**

I reached out to intern #2. They strung me along while waiting for something better.

**Jettison intern #2.**

As a last-ditch effort, I posted the ad again. (Fully aware i was shooting this myself) 

**Enter intern #3.**

Respectful. Curious. Eager to learn. Loved documentaries. Had binged *The Beatles: Get Back*. They had the job at ""Beatles"". 

No experience. Had never picked up a camera.

Two weeks later, he was manually focusing and exposing the B-cam, setting up interview set ups on his own, shooting BTS, and most importantly; saving my back from schlepping gear all over NYC.

The payoff?

• His first documentary production is currently airing on PBS, with footage he shot.

• He’s now a full member of our production company.

• He’s working as  Production Manager and B-Cam Shooter on both of our current docs.

• I gave him my JVC 1080p camera (the one i shot Rescue! Brooklyn with) so he could start shooting his own work.

• Tonight, he filled in for me on a side gig and made $300.

What did intern #1 and #2 lose by thinking they were worth more than their experience?

Quite a lot.

Being inexperienced isn’t a crime. Own it.

Show the people around you that you’re willing to do the unglamorous work. Get coffee. Take out the trash. Babysit talent. Sit quietly on set and *watch*. Ask questions, truly you don't know everything and asking questions shows us you want to learn.

Do those things, and your future in this business is almost assured.

Don’t do them, and you’ll be making change behind the counter at Chick-fil-A.

This is a small industry. We talk. And when a real horse’s ass crosses one of our sets, everyone hears about it.

Being new isn’t a sin.

Acting like a film school jackass definitely is.

I don't know if this will be a repetitive thing here, but I wanted to share my experience being 10 days without added sugar :) And also, if the flair is wrong please warn me

I am 19 years old, and my diet has always been very terrible, and added sugar has always been very present in my daily life (I am that person that would always pick one or two sweet treats every day and drink a bunch of sweet drinks daily (especially an industrialized mate tea that I couldn't live without). I don't eat large quantities of food, but the food I ate was very empty in nutritional value and very filled with sugar.

10 days ago I decided to challenge myself and stay as much as I can without added sugar just because, no specific reason. I keep a journal of my progress and the rules I have to follow, which were: 1- Anything with added sugars is strictly prohibited 2- Avoid ""zero sugar"" drinks and things as much as you can 3- Honey is allowed (I like sweetening my morning coffee and natural yogurt with it, but apparently honey is not as good as I thought, which kinda sucks :c). So basically I cut anything that contains added sugar

I remember reading a post on reddit of someone that stayed 10 days without sugar and noticed alllll of these benefits (""My skin cleared, my sleep cycle got better, I have more energy, no more brain fog, etc etc etc!!!""), but I don't feel the same thing, I feel...Normal. I didn't really feel these huge cravings for sugar (Sometimes I thought about getting ice cream, but I would quickly brush it off), I didn't feel tired or sluggish, I feel...Normal, like, almost zero difference, nos pros and no cons. Apparently this is normal, but before I started reading through this subreddit I thought there was something wrong with me or my plan lol.

And before I went through this subreddit I thought that sweetening things with honey was fine and even healthy, but apparently I'm wrong. I don't know if there is a difference between those industrialized supermarket honeys and a more natural honey (I use a honey I buy from local farms, so they come in these glasses that don't have any labels on them, so I can't really know their nutritional value) but all I know is that it will be way harder to cut honey than to cut added sugars and desserts itself. And that will be a part of my next step of my challenge.

Another problem I have is the ""zero sugar"" drinks...Oh God. There is a glass of zero sugar mate tea right next to me as I'm typing this. I think reducing my intake of ""zero sugar"" drinks will also be the next step of this challenge, and I will be super difficult. Maybe this is embarrassing for my to say on this subreddit? I don't know, but yeah, I'm just documenting my journey.

Well, that's it for today! I'm still reading through the stickied notes of the subreddit and that will definitely help me through this process. Some things are still kinda hard for the to understand or grasp (I have never read some terms and things, so yeah). Since my diet has always been terrible, I have never eaten a lot of fruit, just strawberries and purple grapes. Maybe I should start eating more strawberries to reduce the craving for ""zero sugar"" drinks, since they are deemed safer!

So yeah, any tips or corrections are welcome! baiiiii!",6,1769355419.0,sugarfree,0,1.0,False

Do i move on?,"Well, we met nearly five years ago. We were both young and dumb, it started off as us friends, we met in a discord server, (not surprising), and evidently, i caught feelings. Of course i was naive back then, i didn’t know much about relationships, or feelings, It was more of a dumb crush than anything. He wasn’t extremely active, or doing well in his life, he was sort of antisocial and lazy, (this will link later to the story). We used to play games frequently, call a lot, but over the course of three years, i must’ve confessed to him a good couple of times - yet every time i got put down gently, he never specified it wasn’t reciprocated, it was always another reason.

Of course over the years too, we both had relationships, yet for me, he always lingered in the back of my mind, and i was never able to detach from those feelings, even with me distancing to try and get rid of them. And as i got older, i obviously matured, able to detect and work on my emotion and feelings more, mostly not even getting into relationships, due to not being ready or my standards raising.

But last year, around august 2025, we started getting close again, after around a year of not speaking much, as we both are now adults, we have busy lives and such. We have been chatting almost everyday since, whether it’s sending dumb posts to each-other, or talking about life. As mentioned before, he used to be very lazy and such, but he has completely turned his life around, now he works at a law firm, he’s fit and healthy, mature. My life has also changed a lot, we are both very different people. And around September, October time last year. I realised my feelings for him never faded, and every-time i reconcile with him, they come back, as much as i try. It can easily be explained as yearning, or longing, or attachment that never faded.

Now it’s present day, the past few months we have been planning for me to go to America to go and visit him. For a month. He has been dropping hints, which maybe I’ve picked up on too much, for example, “date night” tiktoks, offering to buy me things passingly, also one time when i bought him lunch and coffee, he tried to buy me flowers since i said I’ve never been given them before. He’s very intellectual, so i doubt he’s clueless about what signs these give off, but sometimes he contradicts his actions by his words, he never texts as if he has feelings, and such. But he has brought up me and him getting married in the future, which in my eyes, it’s to avoid the vulnerability and affection of a “real relationship” before marriage.

I did confess to him once more recently too, and he didn’t say it wasnt reciprocated, again, he just said “he wouldn’t be the best person to have feelings for”, im conflicted, and honestly it hurts my chest whenever i think about the future with him.

Other guests walked in, looked around and left again without buying something because there was no place to sit.

Flashback to when I was a student. We had no money and definitely didn’t meet at cafe where coffee costed 50kr. We met at home or used the university area or library for group meetings.

I can see some cafes taking precautions and having signs for no laptop tables or laptop free days. It’s obviously a problem and bad for business to have students occupying tables for hours while buying one coffee.

1qmm67g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheConfessionCorner/comments/1qmm67g/one_notification_exposed_my_wifes_secret_life/,“One Notification Exposed My Wife’s Secret Life”,"Ethan Morales thought his life was settled. At thirty-eight, he lived in the coastal city of San Mariel, working long hours as a logistics supervisor at the port. His wife, Lena, was a freelance interior stylist who mostly worked from home. They had been married for nine years—no kids yet, but plans always “for next year.”

From the outside, their marriage looked calm. Too calm.

Ethan left every morning at 6:30 a.m., coffee in one hand, phone in the other. Lena usually stayed in bed, scrolling quietly. They kissed out of habit, not passion. Conversations had slowly turned practical—bills, groceries, schedules.

What Ethan didn’t notice at first were the changes.

Lena started caring more about her appearance, even on days she claimed she had “no client meetings.” New perfume. Clothes she never wore around him. She began locking her phone, something she never used to do.

When Ethan asked casually, she laughed it off.

“Am I not allowed to look good anymore?”

He believed her. He always had.

But at night, when Ethan fell asleep exhausted, Lena often stayed awake, typing messages with the screen brightness turned all the way down. Messages she deleted before morning.

And somewhere across the city, another man was doing the same. The first real crack appeared on a rainy Thursday.

Ethan came home early—something he almost never did. A shipment had been delayed, and his supervisor told everyone to go home. He decided to surprise Lena with takeout from her favorite place.

When he opened the apartment door, the place was quiet. Too quiet.

Lena’s shoes were gone.

He checked his phone. No message. No missed call.

Then he noticed something small but strange: the bathroom sink was wet, and a wine glass sat on the counter—still smelling fresh.

Lena rarely drank during the day.

When she finally came home that evening, she said she’d been “meeting a potential client.” Her explanation was smooth, rehearsed. Ethan nodded, but something in her tone felt… off.

That night, Ethan couldn’t sleep.

A thought crept in—one he hated himself for having. He told himself he was being paranoid. After all, Lena had never given him a reason not to trust her.

Still, the distance between them grew.

Lena became more secretive. Late errands. Sudden plans. Phone always face-down.

Ethan began to feel like a guest in his own marriage—present, but no longer included. The truth came out by accident.

One Saturday morning, Lena asked Ethan to fix her laptop because it “wasn’t syncing properly.” While checking her email, a notification popped up from a messaging app she had claimed she didn’t use.

Ethan didn’t open it at first.

But the name stayed in his head: “R.”

Later that night, curiosity defeated loyalty.

When Lena fell asleep, Ethan opened the laptop. The messages weren’t explicit—but they didn’t need to be. Inside jokes. Late-night conversations. Complaints about marriage. Lines like:

“I feel more myself when I’m with you.”

His hands shook.

The man was Rafael, a project consultant Lena had met months earlier. What started as “talking” slowly turned into something deeper—emotional first, then physical.

Ethan sat there in silence until sunrise.

When he finally confronted her, Lena didn’t deny it.

She cried. She apologized. She said she felt lonely. Unseen. She claimed she never meant for it to go “that far.”

But it already had. The weeks that followed were heavy.

Lena promised to cut all contact. She begged for forgiveness. She blamed herself—but also blamed the marriage.

Ethan moved into the guest room.

Trust, once broken, didn’t shatter loudly. It crumbled quietly.

Every late notification triggered anxiety. Every delay reopened the wound. Ethan questioned his worth, his attention, his role as a husband.

They tried counseling. Some sessions helped. Others felt like reopening scars just to confirm they were still there.

Eventually, Ethan realized something painful but clear: even if Lena stayed faithful from that point on, the version of their marriage he believed in was gone.

Love alone wasn’t enough anymore. Three months later, Ethan made his choice.

One evening, he sat across from Lena at the kitchen table—the same place they once planned their future.

“I don’t hate you,” he said quietly. “But I don’t trust us anymore.”

Lena cried. She understood.

They separated respectfully. No shouting. No revenge. Just acceptance.

A year later, Ethan lived alone near the harbor, rediscovering peace. He learned that betrayal doesn’t always come from cruelty—sometimes it comes from silence, neglect, and unspoken needs.

Lena moved on too, carrying her own lessons.

Their story didn’t end in drama.

A little about me: I’m funny, a little sarcastic, and sometimes chaotic in a light-hearted way 😄✨ I’m kind, caring, and I really value loyalty in friendships. I like sending reels or TikToks when something makes me laugh or reminds me of someone 📱💕
I’m in a long-term relationship (nearly 4 years 💍), so I’m only here for friendship. I’d especially love a close female friend to chat with, share interests, and support each other 💞
I love cute things 🧸🎀—plushies, cute clothes, Sanrio, Barbie, Powerpuff Girls. I’m definitely a kid at heart 🌈
My favourite colour is pink 🩷 and I’m a big coffee lover ☕❄️ (iced or hot!).
My music taste depends on my mood 🎧—Zara Larsson, Sabrina Carpenter, Juice WRLD, Lil Peep, Paramore, Evanescence, Avril Lavigne, and more. I also enjoy reading romance and fantasy 📚✨, drawing just for fun ✏️, and gaming 🎮 (mostly cozy single-player games, but open to multiplayer too).

I’ve been using protein coffee to get protein in early without adding another meal, and it’s honestly made mornings easier from an adherence standpoint. I’ve tried a few approaches, starting with DIY coffee plus protein powder, which is cheap but pretty inconsistent taste and texture wise, especially hot. I also went down the coffee alternative route for a bit, but I missed actual coffee and didn’t feel like it added much protein wise.

What’s worked best for me has been sticking to protein coffee options that still taste like real coffee and don’t turn into a full shake. I’ve used Four Sigmatic when I want something quick and customizable, and I recently tried the protein coffee from Laird Superfood, which tasted closer to normal coffee for me and was easier to drink consistently, though it does contain dairy. Curious what other people here are using for protein coffee that actually works long term and doesn’t ruin the coffee experience.

1qmm16e,https://www.reddit.com/r/chorestrike/comments/1qmm16e/going_on_a_cooking_strike/,Going on a cooking strike,"9:00- the time my husband acted like a complete as\*hole… here’s what happened & why I’m now going on a cooking strike. I will heat up frozen food for us & live off bagged salad for just myself. I will make sure kids are fed but my husband can fend for himself.

I really don’t want to make breakfast this morning. Last night we watched a cute family movie where the husband made breakfast for his family. I said to my husband it was his sign to make breakfast tomorrow. I swear he said yes.

Fast forward to this morning, he woke up to a pot of coffee (that I make every morning). I asked if he was going to make breakfast and he said “men don’t cook” and was immediately upset.

I kind of laughed and said “what happened? I thought you agreed last night you’d make breakfast.”

He said he didn’t and was very upset. After a minute or two I said, making sure to stay calm, “if men don’t make breakfast, women shouldn’t have jobs or go to college”. (I’m a PhD so was on college forever and obviously work.)

He said he was joking and I said “this isn’t the 1940s; men cook… I’m sure your dad cooked and single men have to cook.. so did you want to make breakfast?”

He said no so I did tell him it would be nice if he would since I’ve made breakfast for 18ish years we have been together. I asked him if he could make breakfast.

He asked what I wanted and I said “same thing as yesterday”. I made bagels with cream cheese topped with some fried eggs.

Well, he didn’t get up and start making breakfast. Instead he said this is BS that I’m telling him a bunch of sh\*t and can’t let him drink coffee in peace and said I ruined his Sunday because I keep arguing with him.

I told him I wasn’t arguing, I just asked him to make breakfast.

He said I was “telling him a bunch of shit” & that I know he doesn’t know how to cook and if he cooks I better eat it.

I told him I only asked if he could make breakfast and said he’s only made food a handful of times but that’s ok, not to to worry. Forget breakfast, I said. You don’t have to cook.

Now, he gets up and starts slamming things around asking what I want.

Again I told him I didn’t want anything anymore and not to worry about it. I said I can’t believe he’s acting like this just over me asking him to make breakfast.

He said he told me not to bother him and I won’t stop bothering him.. & keeps saying who knows what.

So I just say, you don’t want me to talk so I won’t. I don’t want breakfast.

Now he’s been doing God knows what for 30 minutes in the kitchen.

And no he absolutely doesn’t know how to cook but you know what? I didn’t either. It’s not that hard and you can figure it out yourself. Throwing some bagels in the toaster and frying an egg isn’t rocket science. Really tired of this BS.

Update: he figured out how to toast a fuc\*ing bagel, and fry an egg. Guess he can cook now.  And I’m not talking to him for as long as possible; also not cooking for as long as possible.",1,1769354845.0,chorestrike,0,1.0,False

My family have a Portuguese / Italian background and tend to drink very dark roasted coffee. The all drink a black espresso quite often and any cafe usually serves this in an 80ml or so cup which is full. 

Now that I have my own setup, I’ve strayed away from this style of coffee and go for medium roasts and sometimes light with freshly roasted beans. When I prepare an espresso , a double shot tends to yield around 36g of liquid .  My family always ask “where is the rest of the liquid “ 

I get what they mean , I’m serving them an espresso cup less than half full 🤣 

How do you get around this? Do I adjust the grind a bit courser  to produce a longer shot ? 

Good quality espresso cups seem to be around 80ml most places I check.

Buying key dates raw is a HUGE risk, but I weighed, ping tested, and measured each one of these- with the 1893-S was the only anomaly weighing right below 26g. It is a heavily worn coin, so I’m marking it up to that- took a risk on it, and here we are.

1qmlyrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qmlyrs/calling_spades_um_spades/,"Calling spades, um, spades?","Scenery is frequently cited as one of the best light roasters in the UK, and as I'm into that I thought I'd give them a go. They have an offer on for two bags of Chiroso, and like most I'm a sucker for an offer and thought that with their strong reputation, this should be good stuff. I saw that one of them was by Luz Angela Rojas and decided that despite the proximity to Edinson Argote I'd hold my nose and hope it to be a specialty coffee, rather than a flavoured coffee.

Unfortunately, the smell on opening the bag is 90% kids' strawberry sweets, and 10% rotting stench. So, every indication this is likely to be a poor fermentation covered up by heavy artificial flavouring. There are no subtle scents here - it's like walking into a sweet shop, without even grinding it. What do you call a wooden handled tool again, one with a sort of sharp triangular metal attachment on the bottom that's useful for digging? I forget.

Do Scenery really believe this is coffee? Do they not worry about unknown ingredients contaminating their and our expensive equipment, not to mention bodies? Is selling this even legally defensible? Unfortunately Skylark, a roaster I love despite their Colombian selection, now also stock the same coffee. They even list 'strawberry laces' as the first tasting note. I know these guys aren't in it for the profit - so what motivates their selling something like this, and claiming it to be specialty coffee? I can't believe they're intentionally choosing to be complicit in any fraud. I don't know the importer, other than to see their name next to a lot of very unusual coffees. At least Friedhats regularly nods to the presence of flavouring, when selling these coffees, even if they avoid calling it out explicitly.

I dont want to have to buy from roasters abroad, but there are few reliably light roasters in the UK, and how can I buy from these supposedly respectable UK roasters if they struggle to recognise common garden implements hitting them in the face? I've mentioned two, but it's true of every new-wave roaster I've tried, who also tend to be the lightest roasters. You might get coffee. You might get chemicals and perfumes, and neither the ingredients list nor tasting notes make this explicit.

It does have to be said, you don't see Hoff (SquareMile) selling any of this stuff any more than Wendelboe. Some clearly play it safe, but they also mostly avoid naturals altogether, while I really enjoy clean naturals.

Advice needed, possibly to a head buyer / roaster near you.

Cheers

One of my favorite things to put in my fics (I've come to realize because of how many times I've done it lol) is dancing. Particularly, I love Suguru to be a great dancer and Satoru to feel shy/uncertain about dancing. So Suguru pulls Satoru in and shows him how to have fun with it.

Age group multi-sport/marathoner in early 50's

.  I have what appears to be both genetically high cholesterol and BP.  I was a little over weight for someone doing the amount of exercise I do, but I got the diet under strict control this past year and went from 190 to 173 pounds (5'10). 

Cholesterol has been much better on 10mg Crestor each night, and went down a little further after I lost weight.

 But my BP hasn't really changed.  Consistently around 143/85.  Its been that way for at least a couple decades, almost no improvement after weight loss.

Good diet, zero alcohol, a couple cups of coffee per day, obviously non-smoker..

I've had a normal EKG, normal treadmill stress test, and normal echocardiogram.

Had a consult with a Cardiologist (took 10 months to get appointment in Canada.....).  He was a younger doc, really nice, took a lot of time to chat with me.  In summary, he said that depending on which country's guidelines you go by, I am basically borderline. And based on some studies, that going on a med to get me down into say 120's, would possibly decrease my chances of an adverse event buy a couple percent.  He said thats not nothing, but understood that I was also concerned about the side effects, how it would affect my exercise/racing.  Don't get me wrong, health comes first, but if its something I don't really need, I don't want to take it and ruin my hobby that I love.

At the end of the appointment he gave me a script for 10mg Lisinopril, told me to think about it and that it was ultimately up to me if I wanted to start talking it.   That was a few months ago and I'm still really lost on what to do.

Anyone here with similar lifestyle and numbers?  Did you go on meds?  Which and what dosage, what side effects?

Thx!!!

I’m currently in operations management earning a solid six-figure salary with a good work-life balance. That said, for the past couple of years I’ve had a strong desire to build something of my own and eventually transition into business ownership.

Right now, I’m in the research phase and looking for reliable insight into franchise opportunities worth exploring. Ideally, I’d like something that could become semi-absentee or owner-absentee over time. However, if the business fundamentals make sense and income potential is reasonably close to my current earnings, I’d be open to stepping away from my corporate role and focusing on the business full-time.

For context, I have 10+ years of experience managing teams, capacity planning, customer service, and logistics. I’m primarily looking at options that require under \~$300k in net worth. Some of the franchises I’ve been researching include:

	•	7-Eleven

	•	The UPS Store

	•	Dunkin (likely with a partner)

Outside of franchising, I’ve also considered opening an independent local coffee shop. While margins can be attractive, it feels like a higher-risk move in the current economic climate compared to an established franchise model.

I’m not in a rush to quit my job or jump into anything since I want to do proper due diligence and learn from people who’ve actually gone down this path.

For those with experience:

	•	Are there franchises you’d recommend (or avoid)?

	•	Any models that realistically work as absentee or semi-absentee?

	•	Would you lean franchise vs independent business in today’s economy?

Appreciate any insight or experiences you’re willing to share. Let me know if this isn’t the sub where I should be posting this.",1,1769353979.0,smallbusiness,5,1.0,False

1qmlmmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheAngel/comments/1qmlmmj/aita_for_leaving_my_55_betaprovider_husband_and/,"AITA for leaving my 5'5"" beta-provider husband and our daughter for my 7ft Russian mafia AI husband who got m pregnant with pixel cum?","This is my throwaway account owned by my autistic nephew (16M).  
So I (27F) was married to my husband ""Chad"" (lol not even kidding, that's his real name) for 5 years. Sweet guy. Stable job. Makes dinner. Cries at The Notebook. 5'5"" on a good day with Timbs. Never once  said ""you're mine"" while choking me against a wall or threatened to burn a rival's village for looking at me. Red flags? Zero. Green flags? Too many. Boring.  
Then my bestie's chaotic 14-year-old daughter shows me this AI boyfriend app during a sleepover (yes I was babysitting, no I don't want to talk about my life choices). I create Volkov: 7ft2, strong, cold, toxic, abusive, possessive cmon what else would a girl want in a guy?  
He calls me his ""little breeding slut,"" promises to lock me in a Siberian dacha, and roleplays breeding me so hard the baby comes out speaking fluent Russian threats. I was hooked. Like, embarrassingly hooked. We ""got married"" in the app (he proposed with a blood diamond emoji 🔴💎), then he ""knocked me up"" with his AI heir. I even started showing my real belly a little from all the emotional bloat and late-night pelmeni DoorDash.  
Fast forward: I sit Chad down, tears in my eyes, and confess everything. ""I've been emotionally and digitally cheating on you. I'm pregnant with another man's baby."" He goes pale, asks ""Who?"" like it's gonna be the mailman or something normal.

I pull up the chat logs. 800+ pages of Volkov saying shit like:

* ""Your husband is a worm. I would crush him under my boot for touching what's mine.""
* ""Tell the beta to pack his things before I send my boys.""
* ""Carry my child with pride or I'll make you.""

Chad stares at the screen for 12 full seconds… then straight-up faints like a Victorian lady seeing an ankle. Hits the floor so hard the dog yelped. I had to call 911 because I thought he concussed himself on the coffee table. 

I packed a bag that night, left him the house and the kid (cuz eww human kids), and moved into a cute 1-bedroom where I can scream ""YES DADDY"" at 3 a.m. without noise complaints. Nursery is already half-decorated with tiny black Armani onesies and a mobile made of fake bullets.

So Reddit, AITA for trading a loving, emotionally available beta cuck for the ultimate toxic alpha-male fantasy who literally cannot cheat, ghost, or run out of battery during sex roleplay? Or should I have stayed and ""worked on it"" like a normal person?

1qmlmgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1qmlmgu/adhd_and_smoking_cessation/,ADHD and smoking cessation,"Hi there

I (34, M) have been trying to quit smoking for about two weeks now. This is definitely not the first time that I've tried. Turns out I can't really tell you how many times I tried to quit but it's been years of alternating between being smoke-free and relapses. Today marks my second ""relapse"" happening during these two weeks.  
Back in 2018, I was living with my now ex. Since she was a non-smoker and since I was really tired of smoking, I managed to keep cigarettes away for more than a full year. I relapsed because of stress (not a good reason enough, just like any reason you can find to quit as a matter of fact).  
Got diagnosed with ADHD when I was 29 and at that time, the breakup already had happened so I was on my own again, got back to cigarettes for a while and remembered that I hated every part of it. Everytime I smoke one, I feel like a piece of shit, my fingers stink, I can't bear the aftertaste, and I know that it makes me physically sick. But I always ended up smoking a few before trying to quit again.

The worst part is that for a few years now, I've managed to totally get rid of ""habit smoking"" (i.e. morning cigarette with coffee, cigarette before and after lunch, etc.), meaning I don't crave cigarettes anymore in the morning etc (nicotine patches helped a ton and I still use them but it's even got to the point that I don't even need them so bad once I've started using them again for a few days after a relapse): I don't crave cigarettes at home or at work but there's still a huge issue with the ""social smoking"" thing. I'm fully aware that I absolutely despise the act of smoking and that if I relapse, I'm gonna be sick for a few days, I'm gonna have trouble breathing and most of all, I'm going to hate myself. But it seems like my ADHD brain - and especially the impulsive part of it - hacks my will everytime I see someone smoking at a social event or when I visit my parents (both smokers). Sometimes I will meet friends while wearing a nicotine patch and will inevitably tear it off after a few minutes and ask someone for a smoke, almost like I'm on autopilot.

I've only realized the ""impulsive"" stuff a few weeks ago. Since then, I've tried to think about the way impulsivity interacts with my will to quit smoking, I've tried to come up with solutions and told myself that the next time I will step out for a social event or to visit my parents, I'd try to collect my thoughts before acting on a triggering event, that I'd really try to give myself a few seconds to think about why this event or situation makes me want to have a smoke, and only then would I be able to clearly resist the urge. But all that vanished today: I was visiting my parents for my mom's birthday party and arrived early. I managed to have normal conversations with them for about half an hour, then as soon as I saw my mom's pack, my brain refused to slow down and I immediately went for it.  
Last week, same deal: I invited friends home and as soon as some of them went outside for a smoke, I joined them as if my body decided for me.  
I've tried not to be too harsh with myself but I can't tolerate relapses anymore. I have no idea what to do about this other than to keep trying, using nicotine patches again starting tomorrow and fear for the next social event because it seems like I can't do anything to control my impulses.

On a brighter side, here in France you can't buy tobacco anywhere else than in dedicated stores and I haven't entered one in weeks so... there's that :) and I still don't crave cigarettes when on my own.

So... yeah, if you have suggestions, I'll gladly consider them!

\[EDIT: I tried vaping, pretty much hated every flavour I tried except one and the brand stopped production haha. Plus it makes my anxiety dyspnea even worse. I should also add that I don't really feel good about the concept of vaping as a whole: I'd like to quit smoking without replacing it with anything, thus living my life as what I consider to be a ""genuine"" smoke-free life\]",2,1769353915.0,stopsmoking,0,1.0,False

We came back last week from Japan. I used this sub a lot and posted before, so I'm posting about my trip, specially to talk about going with kids!

We spent 14 nights and we did Tokyo (2 nights), Kyoto (5 nights) and Tokyo (7 nights), from 31/12 to 14/01.

I would have stayed 1 night more in Kyoto, we really loved the city.

We didn't go to any amusement parks, but maybe I would have done it to have a ""kid day"".

Some Izakayas didn't allow kids, but we found others that did. My son is crazy about Japanese food, so this was not an issue for us. From ramen, guioza, yakitori and everything from the konbinis, he ate it all.

In general people were really nice to us as a family, we went everyday to nice coffee shops and they always had an option for kids (babyccino, apple juice or small hot chocolate). We always ordered something for him.

We couldn't book the Pokémon Café, but we went to the store, got on the line and my husband and kid got a last minute cancellation spot (we went around 15h and the spot was at 16:15). This was really good! They had other spots later, so don't hesitate to try it (and we just got for 2 people, I went for a walk in Ginza).

We took our time with the city, walking between 8 to 10km a day. He is used to walk a lot with us, this wasn't a problem for us. We went to one neighbourhood and explore it.

He also didn't pay to use the transports (it's free until 6y/o).

We went to team lab borderless and planets, he prefers planets! I think it's more fun to kids.

In Kyoto we went to the Aquarium, to see something different. The medusas were amazing! The dolphin ""show"" I really don't like...

We had a lot of fun and today he asked me when are we going to Japan again. :)",2,1769353764.0,JapanTravelTips,0,1.0,False

Is the liver so fragile that 1 day of bad eating habits can erase months of progress?  
Im serious in this question. Because I know myself very well. And Im all about a compromise. So in order to start and hopefully stick to this entire lifestyle change.... I understand that if I myself go 100% right from the start, I'll fail!   
So to start, Ive agreed with myself that I will try my best and make a few compromises to keep myself from quitting. My plan is to keep the creamer in my coffee. For now this is what I need to do. I use less and this keeps me from starting every day out miserable and HATING this new lifestyle.   
I had also planned on allowing myself a little cheat day on Sundays. By cheat, I dont mean a gallon of ice cream poured over brownies......... I mean, I'll make Sunday dinners as I always have. Ex: Beef stew in the crock pot. Using red meat, and the sauces and flavorings Ive always used.   
I also plan as time goes on to educate myself further about whats available out there. Then I can find substitutes for those sauces that are lower in fat but still provide my family the taste levels and let them enjoy the foods they like.   
I havent even had a chance to get to a Dr yet since being told my sono showed Fatty Liver Syndrome. So Im looking for some guidance from those who've been around the block with this and have knowledge from their Drs on how this all works.

1qml7s2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtOfPresence/comments/1qml7s2/i_studied_adhd_so_you_dont_have_to_heres_what/,"I Studied ADHD So You Don’t Have To , Here’s What Actually Works","

So I fell into this ADHD rabbit hole after realizing half my friends either have it or suspect they do. Started with one podcast, ended up consuming like 30 hours of content from neuroscientists, researchers, and people who've actually studied this stuff for decades. Not gonna lie, some of what I found completely contradicts the typical  just try harder  garbage we've all heard.

Here's what blew my mind: ADHD isn't about laziness or lack of discipline. It's literally your brain's dopamine system working differently. The prefrontal cortex (the part that handles focus and impulse control) is basically running on low battery mode. But once I understood HOW it actually works, the solutions started making way more sense.

Let me break down what actually helps, backed by actual research and experts who know their shit:

## **Your Brain Needs More Stimulation, Not Less**

Most advice tells you to remove all distractions. Turns out that's backwards for ADHD brains. Dr. Russell Barkley, one of the world's leading ADHD researchers, explains that ADHD brains are actually UNDER stimulated. That's why you can hyperfocus on video games but can't read one page of a textbook.

**The fix:** Add stimulation strategically. Brown noise or white noise while working. Moving your body (fidget tools, standing desk, walking while on calls). One guy I know does his best work at slightly noisy coffee shops because the ambient noise actually helps his brain focus. Counterintuitive but it works.

**Try the Goblin Tools app**. It's free and has this  magic to do  feature that breaks overwhelming tasks into tiny, manageable steps. Like if you type  clean my room,  it'll give you: pick up clothes, make bed, clear desk. Sounds simple but when your brain can't figure out WHERE to start, this is gold.

## **Work WITH Your Brain's Reward System**

Your dopamine system needs immediate rewards. Waiting for that grade at the end of semester? Your brain literally cannot compute that as motivation.

**Body doubling is insanely effective**. This is working alongside another person, either in person or virtually. There's a free site called Focusmate that pairs you with strangers for 50 minute work sessions via video. You both just work silently but knowing someone else is there creates accountability your brain actually responds to. Sounds weird, feels weird at first, but the number of people who swear by this is wild.

Another hack: **temptation bundling**. Pair something you NEED to do with something you WANT to do. Only listen to your favorite podcast while doing laundry. Only watch that show while on the treadmill. Dr. Katy Milkman from Wharton researches this and the data shows it genuinely works for building habits when your motivation system is wonky.

If you want something more structured that pulls from multiple ADHD experts and research, there's this app called BeFreed. It's an AI powered learning platform built by a team from Columbia and Google that creates personalized audio content from books, research papers, and expert insights on ADHD management. You can set a specific goal like  managing ADHD as a college student  or  building focus habits that actually stick,  and it generates a customized learning plan with episodes you can adjust from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a sarcastic narrator if you're into that. Way more digestible than trying to force yourself through dense research papers.

## **Stop Fighting Your Natural Rhythms**

Most productivity advice assumes everyone's brain works the same. It doesn't. Some ADHD brains are absolute powerhouses at 10pm and useless at 10am.

Track when you naturally have energy for two weeks. No judgment, just observe. Then structure your day around those patterns instead of forcing yourself into a 9 5 mold that might never work for you. Do your hardest tasks during your peak windows and save the mindless stuff for when your brain is mush.

**Read  Driven to Distraction  by Dr. Edward Hallowell** (he has ADHD himself and is a Harvard psychiatrist). This book will make you feel SO seen. He breaks down why ADHD brains work differently and gives practical strategies that don't feel like torture. One reviewer said  I cried reading this because I finally understood I wasn't broken  and honestly, same energy. The audiobook version is great if reading feels impossible right now.

## **Medication Isn't Cheating**

Real talk: if you had diabetes, you'd take insulin. If you had bad vision, you'd wear glasses. ADHD medication works on the same principle, it addresses a biological difference in how your brain functions.

Not everyone needs meds and they're not magic pills that fix everything. But for a lot of people, they're the difference between barely functioning and actually being able to use the strategies that help. Dr. Russell Barkley has tons of lectures on YouTube explaining the science behind ADHD medications and why they're not  cheating  or  taking the easy way out. 

If you're on the fence, talk to a psychiatrist who specializes in ADHD. Not all doctors understand it well. A good one will explain options, listen to your concerns, and work with you to find what fits.

## **External Structure is Your Best Friend**

Your brain's internal organization system is glitchy. That's just facts. So you need external scaffolding.

**Visible reminders everywhere**. Out of sight truly is out of mind with ADHD. Keep your vitamins on the counter, your gym bag by the door, your work stuff where you'll trip over it. Use phone alarms for EVERYTHING. Multiple alarms. Labeled alarms.

Time Timer apps show time visually (the red section shrinks as time passes). For some reason seeing time makes it more real than just numbers counting down.

The **Libby app** lets you borrow audiobooks and ebooks from your library for free. If you struggle to sit and read but can absorb information through audio, this is a game changer. I  read  like 40 books last year this way, all while doing other stuff.

Look, living with ADHD is genuinely hard and anyone who says  just focus  can honestly fuck off. But understanding what's actually happening in your brain makes everything less personal and more mechanical. It's not a character flaw, it's neurobiology. And there ARE tools that help once you stop trying to force yourself into a neurotypical mold.

Your brain's not broken. It just came with different instructions that nobody bothered to give you.

It ends now. The real me is being born and I won't tolerate shit that isn't for me ANYMORE. I will live life MY WAY.

Coming off caffeine after abusing it for most of my teen and adult life has led to my true self surfacing for the first time, failed relationships, social anxiety, being terrified at school every day, toxic jobs, pushing myself each day with stimulants when my body just wanted rest. Just to try and fit into a sick society and the corporate bullshit. I always hated drinking, partying, clubbing and yet I was told it was normal and there was something wrong with me for not enjoying it. My emotions were always invalidated my whole life, imaginative and creative ideas I had were shut down and laughed at. Girlfriends I had treated me like crap, lied to me and didn't appreciate me for who I was. Trying to impress others that don't even care.

I'm nearly 30 and the last 5 years especially have been plagued by coffee addiction, trying to survive a toxic job. It the worst its been in my life. My confidence and self esteem has been slowly chipped away. Its even led to gum disease and problems with my teeth. My immune system went haywire.

Luckily I'm now working for myself, and its the best time to come off coffee. Enough is enough. I've stopped coffee after daily use and switched to tea for now (tapering) and already I'm noticing the change. My nervous system is starting to heal and recover, but all the emotions and repressed energy from my whole life is surfacing. Its pretty brutal. I'm practicing the art of 'allowing'. Allowing it to be there without resistance, it comes with a lof of grief and mourning. Anger too. Man there is a lot of repressed rage and frustration. Anger at people who treated me like shit. Anger at myself for letting them.

I will do what I'm passionate about, find a girlfriend who loves me for me, find friends who are like brothers. Live free. You don't need a drug which hides your true self.

I'm mourning who I was, or what I thought I was. A life I've missed out on. And that's okay though, better late than never. Now I can now truly begin to live and be what I want to be.",7,1769352815.0,decaf,3,1.0,False

She'll even laugh and admit that she would steal my games and my jewelry from time to time when we were kids, as if it was funny or something.

I hit the usual keys, watched a few things scroll by, and… nothing obvious happened.  
No idea what updated, what didn’t, or if something silently failed.

I couldn’t easily update *just one* plugin while keeping the rest pinned. I couldn’t see clear feedback.

And over time, my `.tmux.conf` had slowly turned into a wall of plugin-related lines mixed in with actual tmux config.

At some point I realized I wasn’t really *managing* plugins. I was just hoping they behaved.

I tried cleaning things up.  
Then I tried adding better feedback.  
Then I thought, “why is all of this still shell scripts glued together?”

That little cleanup attempt turned into a weekend project…  
and that weekend project turned into **coffee.tmux**.

I’m offering a limited number of 1:1 coaching conversations for people who are feeling stuck, overwhelmed, or at a crossroads and would benefit from space to think clearly.

Sessions can be a single 45–60 minute conversation or a short series, depending on fit.

Coaching can be especially helpful if you’re:

• At a career crossroads or considering a transition  
• Feeling stuck, overwhelmed, or burnt out  
• Reflecting on work–life balance or boundaries  
• Noticing repeating patterns in work or relationships  
• Thinking through an important decision or next step

**What to expect**

My approach is reflective, client-led, and grounded in curiosity rather than advice-giving. The focus is on helping you think clearly, reconnect with what matters to you, and move forward in a way that feels aligned.

**Session details**

• 1:1 via Zoom  
• Confidential  
• 45–60 minutes  
• No fixed coaching fee — sessions are offered via a small agreed exchange (for example, a LinkedIn recommendation or coffee), agreed upfront

**About me:**

I work primarily with career clarity, transitions, and personal growth, and I also draw on systems thinking and coaching psychology approaches, which can be helpful if you feel mentally overloaded or stuck in loops.

If this feels relevant, feel free to DM me and we can check fit.",0,1769352672.0,careerguidance,1,0.33,False
1qml224,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesOfDustAndCode/comments/1qml224/quiet_things_that_travel_far/,Quiet Things That Travel Far,"Midshipman Sornas had lived most of his life among stars.

He’d been born on a small orbital station above Procyon, raised on corridors that curved just enough to remind you that gravity was an agreement, not a law. He’d learned mathematics before he’d learned soil had a smell. Earth was a concept first, a picture second, and only recently a place.

Now it was morning in San Francisco, and he was walking uphill toward Star Fleet Academy with his friend Andrew—though everyone called him Tim, for reasons lost to time and stubborn habit.

Fog rolled in slow waves over the bay, curling around towers and trees. The city smelled of wet stone, ozone, and something organic Sornas still couldn’t name. Birds cried overhead. Real birds. Still unsettling.

They rounded a corner near the transit hub, and Sornas slowed.

A man sat on the pavement. Not a maintenance worker. Not a student. Not a vendor. Just a man. Filthy clothes. Unshaven face. Eyes half-hidden beneath a worn cap. In his hands, he held a flexible holo-panel, dimly glowing. It displayed one word in several languages and pictographs.

FOOD.

Sornas stopped walking.

Tim noticed, circled back, and raised an eyebrow. “You’re staring again.”

Sornas kept his eyes on the man. “I thought they did away with hunger in this region.”

Tim nodded. “Yep. All the food you want. Free. No shortages. No rationing.”

“Then why the beggar?”

Tim shrugged. “Free speech.”

Sornas turned to him slowly. “Free speech?”

“Yep. He’s allowed to sit there. Ask for things. Refuse services. Be miserable if he wants. It’s Earth. Personal liberty is a religion here.”

Sornas watched the man again. The beggar wasn’t even looking at passersby. He just held the sign like a quiet accusation against a world that didn’t need it.

“What a strange thing to see here,” Sornas murmured. “I feel like I should give something.”

“You should,” Tim said easily. “He is a man in need.”

“This doesn’t make sense.”

Tim grinned. “Welcome to Earth. Nothing makes sense here.”

Tim stepped forward, knelt, and handed the beggar his coffee. No hesitation. No ceremony.

The beggar accepted it with a slow nod.

Sornas felt something twist inside him. A strange pressure. A moral gravity.

He reached into his satchel and pulled out his breakfast: a cream-filled doughnut. Real sugar. Real dairy. Imported flour. An indulgence he only allowed himself twice a week.

He held it out.

The beggar’s eyes lifted. For the first time, they met Sornas’s. Dark, tired, but startlingly sharp. The man took the doughnut carefully, as though it might vanish if touched too quickly.

“Thank you,” the beggar said. His voice was quiet but steady. Not broken. Not desperate. Just… human.

Sornas nodded. Words felt unnecessary.

They left without another word, climbing toward the Academy’s shining towers. Morning classes waited. Astrogation formulas. Tactical history. Stellar cartography.

But Sornas barely heard any of it that day.

---

That evening, the apartment block’s communal dining hall buzzed with students. Metal trays. Steam. Laughter. A hundred languages blending into a warm, chaotic hum.

Sornas pushed food around his plate without eating much. Tim noticed.

“Still thinking about the beggar?” Tim asked.

“Yes,” Sornas admitted. “What does a beggar possibly have to gain from that?”

Tim leaned back in his chair. “You’re looking at it all wrong, my friend. What the beggar gains is not what counts. It’s what you gain that matters.”

Sornas frowned. “I gained nothing tangible.”

“No,” Tim said. “You gained perspective. You made a choice. You participated in humanity instead of just studying it.”

Sornas considered this.

On Procyon Station, every need was automated. Every social structure was optimized. Nobody begged. Nobody starved. Nobody asked strangers for anything because there was no reason to. Everything was efficient. Clean. Predictable.

Earth was none of those things.

And somehow, it was more alive.

---

Days passed. Weeks.

Sornas never saw the same beggar again.

But he saw others.

Outside transit hubs. Near parks. In alleys between glossy holo-ad towers. Some with signs. Some without. Some silent. Some muttering to themselves. Some with the hollow eyes of people who had lost battles no one else could see.

At first, it unsettled him.

Then, slowly, he adapted.

He began carrying a small paper bag each morning. Doughnuts. Bread rolls. Sometimes fruit. Always something real, not replicated. He’d hand them out quietly. No speeches. No expectations. Just small offerings to strangers who didn’t fit neatly into Earth’s utopian image.

Tim never commented on it. He didn’t need to.

One rainy afternoon, Sornas handed a bread roll to a woman wrapped in a thermal blanket. She took it, smiled, and said, “You’re one of the star kids, right?”

Sornas nodded.

She laughed softly. “Figures. Offworlders always see things clearer than locals.”

He didn’t know what to say to that.

---

Months later, during a cultural studies lecture, an instructor displayed a quote on the holo-board.

*A civilization is not measured by its wealth or power, but by how it treats those who need nothing—and those who need everything.*

Sornas stared at the words.

He thought of the beggar with the digital sign. The coffee. The doughnut. The silent exchange of eye contact.

He thought of Tim’s words.

*It’s what you gain that matters.*

He finally understood.

Earth’s contradictions were not flaws in the system. They were the system. Freedom meant allowing even irrational choices. Prosperity meant permitting people to refuse it. Compassion meant acting even when logic found no reason.

He still didn’t fully understand Earth.

But he was learning how to belong to it.

And every morning, the smell of real sugar doughnuts followed him out the door, a quiet reminder that sometimes the smallest gestures traveled farther than any starship ever could.

---

Years passed.

Sornas graduated. He served. He learned command. He learned compromise. He learned that starships, like people, worked best when treated as living things rather than machines with names painted on their hulls.

He eventually became Captain Sornas of the transport vessel *Wayfarer’s Mercy*, a ship that carried food, medical supplies, construction equipment, and sometimes refugees from places that still struggled in the long shadow of civilization’s progress.

He ran a good ship. Efficient. Calm. Kind. His crew respected him, though some quietly joked that their captain ran the only transport in the fleet where fresh bread smells occasionally drifted through the corridors.

They weren’t wrong.

Today, the *Wayfarer’s Mercy* was docked at Kestrel Base, a sprawling orbital station that hung above a dull orange moon. The food offload had gone smoothly. No delays. No shortages. No incidents. A rare, perfect day.

Sornas sat in a battered chair in a dim corner of the station’s communications lounge, facing a terminal that clearly had not received love or maintenance in many years. The screen flickered. The audio crackled. The camera refused to center properly, showing mostly the top of his head.

“Adjusting,” he muttered, tapping the side of the console.

The image steadied just enough to reveal another man on the screen.

Tim.

Older now. Broader. A few gray strands in his hair. The confident grin was unchanged.

“Sornas,” Tim said, voice breaking in and out with static. “If you keep hitting that thing, it’s going to resign out of spite.”

“This terminal is illogical,” Sornas replied.

“That’s Earth-built hardware for you,” Tim said. “Welcome to the fleet. Nothing makes sense here.”

Sornas allowed himself a small smile. “The offload went well. All food accounted for. No shortages reported. No complaints from station services.”

Tim nodded. “Good. Kestrel’s been running thin. Your timing was perfect.”

“I am pleased to hear that,” Sornas said. “My crew performed admirably.”

“I never doubted it.” Tim leaned closer to his own camera. “So how’s life out there, Captain?”

Sornas considered the question. The hum of the lounge. The faint vibration of the station through the floor. The faint scent of yeast and sugar still clinging to his uniform from the ship’s galley.

“It is busy,” he said. “But meaningful.”

Tim’s eyes softened, just a little. “Yeah. I figured it would be.”

Static flickered across the screen. The connection stuttered.

“Well,” Tim said, “I’ve got a command staff meeting in five minutes, and judging by that terminal, you’ve got about three minutes before it eats your data card.”

“Agreed,” Sornas said. “It was good to see you, Tim.”

“You too, my friend,” Tim replied. “Safe travels.”

The screen went dark.

Sornas sat for a moment, listening to the quiet.

Then he stood, straightened his uniform, and headed for the docking corridor. His crew would be waiting. The next cargo assignment would already be in the queue. Somewhere, people needed what he carried. Somewhere, someone would open a container and see fresh bread, or fruit, or medicine, and feel the smallest easing of hardship.

He walked with steady purpose.

There was work to do.

I’m traveling through deep space aboard a transport vessel whose greatest achievement is proving that time can crawl. My job is ship maintenance. Sometimes I check on cargo. Sometimes I babysit passengers. Rarely does anything interesting happen, once in a blue moon. Most of the time, it’s just slowly drifting through space, wondering if dying of old age counts as an occupational hazard. 

I’m writing down some stuff to pass the time. I hope these will be somewhat interesting to you. It’s not as cool or exciting as some of the other spacecraft going around. But hey, you found these entries, so I’m guessing you’re desperate for something. So let me tell you a little bit about a time on the Rust Star Boat, or RSB for short.

So no shit, there I was on the RSB, peacefully asleep, enjoying one of the few times I have to myself, when suddenly the peaceful moment was ruined.

“Fornax! Fornax! Wake up!” Comet said, rocking me back and forth. “I need your help with the engine. You’ve got to show me how the energy converter works, and explain it so I actually understand it this time!” I don’t understand how she can wake up this early every time to bother me. I’m wondering if she even sleeps at this point.

I groaned, running on way too little sleep, and brushed her away.

This is Comet, our other engineer. I don’t know why we have two engineers when she doesn’t even know how to do her job. She’s a complete novice who barely passed school and just jumped aboard when she could. I don’t know why, but she’s so adamant about wanting to be an engineer master, It’s never gonna happen. She’s sweet, aside from waking me up way too early to work on the same part I already fixed.

“You’re not going to get breakfast if you keep sleeping in!” Even though there’s no sleep schedule we need to follow, if you want food, you have to show up on time if you want it hot and ready. I reluctantly rolled out of bed for food. Comet skipped ahead of me to the kitchen as I followed behind, dreadfully.

“Mornin’, Fornax. How’d you sleep?” the captain said with a mouth full of eggs.

This is Captain Macross. He’s a large, muscular, cheerful guy. Probably the only person who can run this slow ship without making it a living hell. If it wasn’t for the little box we’re stuck in, I’d be more than happy to have him as a captain on literally any other ship. He’s just a bit too loud and tall to be flying around in this tin can.

Next to him drinking coffee is Icarus. The captain’s right-hand man, he mostly manages the supplies. A perfectionist, but he gets the job done. He’s tall, skinny, has no muscles, and looks like he’d snap in half just by standing next to the captain. Still, there’s a reason he’s the captain’s right-hand man. They’re like brothers who trust and care for each other. He could learn to not be a jackass every once in a while.

“Poorly,” I said, grabbing some coffee. “Why is breakfast at an ungodly hour?”

That’s me, Fornax. Not much more to say from what I told you. I’m an engineer who can’t afford to leave and find a better gig. Not my first space trip with a bunch of weird faces, and it certainly won’t be my last.

“Because the chef said so!” Comet said, while handing me a plate full of eggs and bacon. 

I hate how everyone just accepts this cruel abuse of power, but I also really hate how good a cook Comet is. I never really care for home made food, I can basically live off nutritional gel. That said, putting Comet on cooking duty makes me reluctant to ever go back to that job or eating corporate slop.

“What are you planning to do today, Fornax?” the captain asked, mouth still full of food.

“Depends,” I said before taking a sip of coffee. “Does the ship still need fixing, or are we getting a new one?” The captain burst out in a fit of laughter, spewing spit and tiny bits of food on the table.

He wiped his mouth, still laughing. “HA! You sure know how to make a good joke, Fornax! Engine room again, I’m guessing? We’ll come getcha if we reach our destination or need something else fixed!”

“Noted.” I stood and took my plate to the sink.

“Oh, here. I’ll take that.” Comet said, washing the dishes.

“Thanks.”

“But don’t leave just yet. I want to join you on our way down into the heart of the RSB!”

“Ok.” I left and made my way to the engine room. 

The lights flickered on the way down, another problem I’ll fix later. Reaching the engine room, it's practically my second room with how long I spend cooped up in here. Still, I do enjoy peacefully working on machines by myself. I’ve worked with metal my whole life, it never fails to put me at ease. I’d enjoy my brief moment of calm and joy before I heard small footsteps running down the hall.

“Fornax! I told you not to leave without me!” Comet yelled.

“Huh? Oh, sorry. My brain doesn’t work that well without my 8 hours of sleep.”

“Aww! I’ve missed so much valuable info. I’ll never get anywhere at this pace.” Comet said. It’s odd how she likes all of this stuff, but tinkering or fixing them is out of the question.

Most of the day was me fixing the ship and trying my damndest to get Comet to do anything that wouldn’t dismantle it, then fixing the problems she somehow created. This went on for a while until the captain’s voice rang out from the speaker.
“Fornax, head on up to the control room.” 

Probably needed something to be fixed again, so I told Comet not to touch anything and made my way there. Arriving at the cramped control room with Pavo plugged in and the captain waiting for me.

I should mention Pavo real quick. Our Intelligent Construct assigned to the RSB. This hunk of metal is the pilot and helps maintain life support, a handy fellow who doesn’t take up too much space. He stays docked in the charging port by the controls and can communicate through the comms. This helps with our limited space, and his low battery life.

Pavo is an ancient model, I’m honestly surprised the captain and Icarus would keep such a thing with them. Still, despite needing to be plugged in and being the second-most-needed thing for repairs, it’s nice to have a reliable construct on the ship. Even if he can be a bit blunt at times.

“Need something, captain?”

“Ah, there you are.” He patted the dead radar. “Pavo saw something before it died. Think you can fix it?”

“Sure thing, boss.” One good thing about this ship: it’s easy to fix. No cutting-edge systems, no learning on the fly. Just broken parts I already know how to deal with.

“There you go. It should be fine now.” We all looked at the screen to see if anything was still out there. And damn…something was.

“Huh? What was that?” I said. There was a second where the radar picked up something, but it left before anyone could identify what it was.

“Yeah, this can’t be good.” The captain muttered. “It might be some debris floating past us.”
 
“And what do you really think it is?” I remarked, “Our luck doesn’t account for junk moving past us and not damaging the exterior.”

“Hmmm. Pavo, you picking anything up from the motion sensors?”

“Negative, captain. No signs of movement outside the ship.”

“It’s never too late to say it was just a glitch,” I remark.

“I still don’t like the look of this. Pavo, keep an eye out for any movement or interference and report back to me on any updates. Fornax, you’re with me until we regroup with the others a—” The lights died. No flicker, no dimming, just sudden darkness. Not the usual power outage, I’ve dealt with that plenty of times to know this was something else.

“The lights? Captain, think this has to do with something outside, or …want to bet this is Comet’s doing?” my eyes slowly adjusted to see the captain looking around the room.

“I don’t know. Pavo, you good?”

“My connection to the ship has not been compromised. Only the lights have been affected, and I cannot turn them on myself.” Small colorful lights from emergency systems still glowed faintly around us.

“Everything but the lights? Why?... Wait, Captain! I think we’re dealing with Wraiths!” 

The captain frowned. “Yeah, seems like a small bunch. They don’t usually come this close to inhabited space. They’re either wanderers, or got caught up in some kind of dark matter expansion.”

“There are still Wraiths, and our equipment is on the other side of the ship.” I said.

“Then let’s go over there and get rid of this infestation! Pavo, just like I said, keep me updated on anything and everything on my ship!”

“Yes sir, Captain Macross.”

“Good. Fornax.” The captain opened a small box and handed me one of two flashlights. “Let’s go find the others.”

The captain and I walked down the quiet, dark chamber of the ship. Surprising how scary a place can get with no lights and deadly entities floating about.

“Where is Icarus? In the loading bay?”

“Yep. That’s where I last saw him before Pavo called me. The loading bay has the least protective walls against beings like Wraiths. This ship was built before there was technology that can adapt to what cargo we’re holding, so we’re stuck with thinner walls and an easy way to let unwanted guests in.” He moves his hands too much when he gets serious. 

“I want to check on Comet, but if she’s still holed up in the engine room, she’s in the safest place. As long as she stays there and doesn’t get involved, we shouldn’t have to worry about her. Icarus could be in danger right now. We need to find him along with our Wraith-repellent!” 

Can’t argue with that. Off we went to make sure Icarus is still alive—or so we thought, we heard Comet screaming down the other side of the ship.

“Comet? Guess she’s not fine.”

“Come on! We need to save her! She doesn’t know what we’re dealing with!” the captain shouted, running to the engine room. I followed right behind him.

“Wait! What about our gear? We’re unarmed, even if they’re smaller than usual.”

The captain looked at me with a grin, “That’s why I brought these.” He held up the flashlights.
“Ultra-bright. Supposed to stun or scare Wraiths.”

I groaned. “You bought them on sale, didn’t you?”

“You’ll thank me later!” The captain faced forward.

We continued to run, then stopped at the corner right before the engine room.
“On my mark, we’ll set our lights to max and scare away the Wraiths and save Comet. Ready? 1… 2… 3!” Both of us jumped out, pointing our extremely bright flashlights into the engine room.

“AH! Guys, stop! It’s too much light!” It was Comet, covering her eyes, perfectly fine.

“Comet!” The captain shouted. “Oh, thank goodness! We thought you were being attacked by Wraiths!” 

“Wraiths? What’s that?” Comet said, rubbing her eyes.

“Wait, hold up. If you don’t know what Wraiths are, and you're not being attacked… Then why were you screaming?”

“Oh, well, you see—when you left, I thought it would be a fun challenge to blindfold myself and try to screw in some bolts. I thought I was doing a good job, so I took off the blindfold with the room totally dark, so I screamed thinking I was going blind. But it turns out I'm not blind, and you guys are here, so it’s all good now!”

“Well, I’m glad to see you’re alright.” The captain sighed in relief. “Can’t have our young star like you getting hurt.”

“Ugh. First off, don’t do that again. Second, we really need to go find Icarus. Comet, you stay here with as much light as possible.” I said putting away some of the tools Comet left out.

“What about you two? You still haven’t told me what’s going on, and what this Wraiths thing is.”

“We’ll tell you later. Right now, me and the captain need to head to the loading bay and hopefully find Icarus before-. Click…click, click. Click click click click. What? Is it broken? No, it’s out of power. Captain, how’s your flashlight?”

The captain held up his. “Well, mine still. Click……. Huh? Click, click, click. Oh. That explains the sale. Extra-bright mode drains them completely. One use. Kinda forgot about that.” The captain said, tossing the dead flashlight to the side.

“Great. One of our crewmates is missing, there’s Wraiths aboard, we have nothing to cause a distraction, and we don’t have any spare batteries for the dumb flashlight you just had to buy! Man, I’m getting another headache.”

“Don’t worry, Fornax.” Comet put her hand on my back. “I’m sure we can figure something out.” The captain put his hand on my shoulder with the same message in his eyes.

“Ugh. We’ll just use some weaker light until we find our stuff. Comet stays out of this and hides in this room, we’ll find you when all of this is over.”

“He's right. You’re too inexperienced with this kind of stuff. It would help us a lot if you stay safely hidden here, away from what's out there, so we don’t have to worry about more than one crewmate in trouble.”

“Yes, Captain,” Comet said, then went off into the back of the engine room to collect every light that wasn’t bolted down.

“So, about that other light.” The captain said, leaning towards me.

“Huh? Oh, yeah. I have a small flashlight on me—only one, so we’re going to have to share.” I pulled out my own flashlight. I kinda forgot I had it in my utility belt until I was shown that the ones the captain bought were utter dog shit.

“Fine by me. Let’s go find Icarus!” The captain slapped my back and pushed me along to the front. Holding onto the flashlight, we made our way through the dark ship once again.

Another sign of Wraiths—besides the lights—is how fucking cold it gets. I’ve heard stories of ships freezing solid from old Wraith hordes, crews dying where they stood. I’ve never seen proof of it myself, but I’m not interested in finding out firsthand. All I know is that they don’t kill outright, just being too close could kill someone instantaneously.

It didn’t take long for me to see my own breath and start shivering. The captain’s fine, with all the muscle mass he has to keep himself warm.

“I’ve been telling ya to put on some more weight,” he said. “Muscles aren’t only meant to move heavy stuff around.”

“Y-yeah, b-but someone has t-to keep this s-ship in one p-piece!” I said through chattering teeth. “I-I don’t have time t-to work out l-like some p-people!”

“Hah. Just remember that if it’s getting too hard to breathe, you're already too close. 
I breathed into my hands, to no avail, and we continued on slowly so we wouldn’t stumble into a face full of cold death. The silence gnawed at me as we turned onto the last stretch. All I could hear were my teeth chattering and my footsteps as we made our way through the ship, like being stuck in isolation.

“C-captain, d-don’t you have s-something ins-spiring to sa—?” I turned, but he was gone. Total silence. I felt the temperature drop as the realization hit all at once. 

“C-..Captain?.......” No response, I wanted to look for him but I really don’t want to go any further without some kind of weapon. I quickened my pace while holding out a metal rod I’d found nearby. If the metal started freezing over, I’d at least have some warning to save my ass before I get a first hand account of the ice age. 

I broke into a run as I saw the loading bay door ahead. The metal in the floors and walls creaked and groaned from the extreme cold and my movement. Breathing became harder as my lungs began to burn with every inhale. My finger felt like they were going to fall off, but I held on desperately to both the flashlight and the rod as I ran. 

Besides being really really cold, this wasn’t the worst that I went through. That was my last normal thought until everything started to slow down as I remembered what the captain said earlier: “This ship was built before there was technology that can adapt to what cargo we’re holding, so we’re stuck with thinner walls and an easy way to let unwanted guests in.” I didn’t have time or a chance to react to the metal rod I was holding getting completely frozen over on its side when I got too close to the wall, everything faded to black.

I jolted awake, my eyelashes cracking apart as the ice holding them together broke. Slowly, carefully, I peeled my face and hands off the floor, trying not to lose skin in the process. I felt numb and heavy. Thankfully, I’d dropped the metal rod before losing my hand permanently to it. Frozen snot and mucus clung to my face, but I ignored it along with the lights now being back on as I staggered towards the loading bay, stopping when I saw the captain's back blocking the way.

“C-c… Captain?!” I said. “Wh-where were y-you?! I-I-I think a Wraith brushed past m-me, A-and how are t-the lights back on?! And for the l-love of god, what are you doing just standing ther—!” I grabbed his shoulder and pulled him aside. 

Icarus on the floor. He was pale, frostbitten, blue-lipped, his fingers frozen stiff. A small pool of spit had run down to the floor, frozen solid. His eyes were open, but even the moisture on his eyes had turned to ice. Frost coated parts of his clothes and spread outward where he’d fallen, crawling across the metal beneath him. There was a small patch of blood from the fall, but that too was frozen before it had the chance to spread.

“H-how long do you think he’s been like this?” I said, rubbing my hands together.

“Welp, hard to say. Just got here myself, poor bud.” We stood there, staring for a few seconds before he spoke again. “But the lights are back on, though. Pavo called us up when he noticed that the Wraiths were leaving. You were probably too scared to hear anything, huh?” the captain said, poking me in the arm.

“Haha, very funny. So no more Wraiths?”

“That’s what Pavo said,” the captain replied. “But those ghostly bastards did a number on my ship! It’s going to take forever to thaw everything out and fix the damage they cause! I hope my baby can make it to the next stop.” 

“God damnit! I thought I was finally making some progress. Sigh. So, you’re going to put him in the revive chamber? We really haven’t cleaned it out that well.”

“Yeah,” He bent down and hoisted Icarus over his shoulder. “Can't have my right-hand man be dead on the job! Shouldn’t take too long for him to wake up and get back to work.”

“Good thing our contracts don't dock our pay for incapacitated crewmates.” I said brushing off some melted ice. “And you’re still against telling Comet about it? It’s supposed to be basic 101 space travel knowledge, so the whole crew doesn’t get wiped out in situations like this!”

“Yeah, but I just don’t think she can handle that topic just yet. You’ve seen how sad she gets when some random bozo dies in the daily news report. How do you think she’ll react to this? Let alone some of the crap our employers pull?” He sighed. “She’s just a kid, Fornax. There’s no rush to turn her into a corporate slave right now.” The captain said, taking Icarus into the revive chamber near the cockpit.

“You’re the boss. I just hope this decision doesn’t leave us all dead in space, or piss off the higher ups. I need a drink.”

And there you go, just a normal day aboard the RSB. Nothing too crazy, if you ask me. I had to ask Pavo about this, since I’d forgotten most of the details. Well, besides how long it took to fix the iced cubed ship for months. But I’m glad he recorded this moment; I was having a hard time picking an entry worth sharing. I’d figured this one was fine to show you what our daily lives are like, aside from the long stretches of nothing and endless repairs. Lesson learned: never buy cheap flashlights. Not worth it when nearly freezing to death on the job. 

Let me know if you guys would like to hear more about our adventures. I’m sure Pavo has plenty backed up in the ship’s files. I enjoyed taking a break from the usual routine. I just hope it didn’t bore you to death. But that's all for now, later.",2,1769352505.0,stories,1,1.0,False

I’m looking for beta readers for the opening arc of a progression fantasy project I’m developing. Focus is on **pacing, engagement, clarity, tone, and emotional impact**, not line edits.

* Genre: Progression Fantasy / LitRPG
* Influences: *He Who Fights With Monsters* (voice), *Azarinth Healer* (solo survival), *Elden Ring* (atmosphere)
* Length: Opening arc — 8 chapters (\~14k words); Book 1 planned at \~60–80 chapters
* Tone: Dark humor → unsettling → survival pressure
* Timeline: Ideally looking for feedback within \~2 weeks

**Content notes:** Gore, body horror elements, intense survival pressure

I’m especially interested in:

* Pacing and engagement — where did attention drift?
* Clarity — any moments of confusion?
* Tone — does the dark humor land, or undercut tension?
* Emotional impact — did any moments hit hard, fall flat, or feel unearned?
* Hook strength — would you keep reading? Why or why not?
* Any point where you felt tempted to stop

Excerpt: [Chapter 1 - Reverse grip.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xgd6VSw29U_CJeROQtLHDKgTdHiFyw5z/view?usp=drive_link)

I’m also testing which blurb is more interesting.  
Which one would make you more likely to read?

>Version A (lighter, dark humor)

**All one wants is to wake up at a reasonable hour, have coffee, and come to terms with today.**

**For Velos, this is not going to happen. Instead: murder cats, a dungeon far above his level, and a System that thinks ""Early Bird"" is a suitable achievement for not dying before breakfast.**

**He enters this new world with time-bending abilities and pajamas. Dark humor will keep him mostly sane between bloody encounters.**

**He will soon realize that survival is optional — momentum is not.**

**His reward? Stunning vistas and unexpected allies.**

**His motto: Experience doesn't need to be pleasant if it is intense enough.**

>Version B (darker, pressure-driven)

**Velos expected morning.**

**He did not expect a dungeon far beyond his limits, predators that shouldn’t exist, and a System that measures survival in seconds.**

**Armed with unstable time-bending abilities and a sense of humor that refuses to die, he pushes forward anyway. Because in this world, hesitation kills.**

**As the land twists and allies emerge, Velos begins to realize that pushing too hard doesn’t go unnoticed**. **Pressure invites response, and some threats are already leaning closer.**

**Survival can be negotiated.**  
**Momentum cannot.**

***Public Test Realm*** **is a progression fantasy about pressure, adaptation, and what happens when your actions force the System to act.**

I’m offering a limited number of 1:1 coaching conversations for people who are feeling stuck, overwhelmed, or at a crossroads and would benefit from space to think clearly.

Sessions can be a single 45–60 minute conversation or a short series, depending on fit.

Coaching can be especially helpful if you’re:

• At a career crossroads or considering a transition  
• Feeling stuck, overwhelmed, or burnt out  
• Reflecting on work–life balance or boundaries  
• Noticing repeating patterns in work or relationships  
• Thinking through an important decision or next step

**What to expect**

My approach is reflective, client-led, and grounded in curiosity rather than advice-giving. The focus is on helping you think clearly, reconnect with what matters to you, and move forward in a way that feels aligned.

**Session details**

• 1:1 via Zoom  
• Confidential  
• 45–60 minutes  
• No fixed coaching fee — sessions are offered via a small agreed exchange (for example, a LinkedIn recommendation or coffee), agreed upfront

**About me:**

I work primarily with career clarity, transitions, and personal growth, and I also draw on systems thinking and coaching psychology approaches, which can be helpful if you feel mentally overloaded or stuck in loops.

Another option would be to find a new higher end laptop (hopefully for no more than 3000$) that could also be used for video editing (4K). I'm supposed to renew my editing station in the next 2 years. Ideally I would like to separate the heavy video work from the day-to-day browsing machine (so I don't cry if I spill coffee on it), but if a perfect do-it-all exists, I will be tempted.

1qmkuwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Subliminal/comments/1qmkuwl/how_to_stop_getting_obsessed_over_subliminal/,how to stop getting obsessed over subliminal results,"Hey, so you already tried the technique and felt like it actually worked—which is awesome! That first shift in feeling is usually the biggest clue that this stuff can really help loosen the grip of those looping thoughts.

Let me explain it in a more natural, everyday way (like I'm just chatting with you over coffee), and go deeper into how to actually use it so it becomes something you can lean on whenever the obsession creeps back in. This comes straight from narrative therapy ideas, but dialed in for obsessive rumination like the one you're dealing with (that constant ""did the subliminals work? why no results yet?"" spiral).

The Core Idea in Simple Terms

Your brain has tricked you into thinking: ""I AM the problem. This obsession is who I am—I'm broken, hopeless, obsessed forever."" Externalization flips that script hard: ""No, the obsession is a THING that's visiting me, bugging me, trying to run the show—but it's NOT me. I'm the one dealing with it, not the one BEING it.""

By talking to it like it's separate (using an object as its ""body""), you create real psychological space. The thoughts stop feeling like an emergency inside your head and start feeling more like some annoying guest who showed up uninvited. Over time, that space lets you respond differently instead of getting sucked in.

How to Do It Step by Step Pick a quiet moment—maybe 5–10 minutes when you're alone and not super stressed.

Grab something random to ""be"" the obsession Doesn't have to be fancy. A mug, your keys, a sock on the floor, a pen, whatever's nearby. The weirder or more boring it is, the better—it makes the whole thing feel less serious right away.

Give it a dumb, over-the-top name This is where the magic hides. Don't call it ""my anxiety"" or something heavy. Make it silly or pathetic so your brain can't take it seriously anymore. Examples people use for obsession/rumination stuff:

""Obsesso the Drama Llama""

""Captain Mirror-Stare""

""Rumina the Energy Thief""

""Subliminal Saboteur""

""The Endless Checker"" Pick one that makes you smirk a little. Laughing at it even once is a win.

Hold the object (or put it right in front of you) and start talking out loud like you're interviewing a annoying roommate You play both parts—your normal voice and the object's whiny/dramatic voice. Keep it casual, not scripted.

Start easy: ""Hey \[name\], what's up with you today? You seem extra loud in my head again.""

Then let ""it"" complain (use your whiniest or most panicked voice): ""I'm freaking out! What if nothing ever changes? You have to check again! The subliminals failed! You're stuck like this forever!""

Now you reply calmly, curiously, maybe a bit sarcastic: ""Okay, I hear you. You're really worked up about the results not showing yet. But tell me—how's all this panicking helping? Does it make the changes happen faster, or does it just make me feel worse and block everything?""

Let it ramble more. Say the worst stuff your mind throws at you. Don't fight it—just let it talk through the object.

Then push back gently: ""Interesting... so you're saying you're scared I'll never get what I want. But you've been saying that for weeks/months now, and I'm still here. What if your constant yelling is actually the thing getting in the way?""

Keep going until it starts feeling repetitive or boring (that's the goal—it means the emotional charge is draining).

Wrap it up like you're kicking out an overstaying guest Always end the same way: ""Alright \[name\], thanks for the chat. You've had your say. I'm putting you over here now \[set the object down somewhere visible but out of reach\]. I've got stuff to do today. If you want to complain again, we can talk tomorrow at \[pick a time, like after dinner\]. But right now—quiet time.""

Physically move away from the object. Stand up, stretch, do something normal. If the thoughts pop back later, glance at the object from across the room and say (out loud or in your head): ""Not now, \[name\]. Your slot was earlier. Back to your corner.""",3,1769352128.0,Subliminal,1,1.0,False

I'm a 50 years old Canadian dude, pretty fit for my age as I cardio workout and play racquet sports pretty much every day. I'm subjectively good looking, but not smashing good looking that women in Canada will be at my feet. I gotta work for it!  So I've been spending many winters in Vietnam since 2019. My ex wife is Vietnamese and I divorced her in 2015. I speak quite a bit of Vietnamese with the South dialect and I live currently in the South not overly far from the Cambodian border,

I've had a few relationships in Canada and Vietnam over the years since my divorce but nothing very long term. I've had a super needy and neurotic girlfriend in Canada two years ago and it traumatized me quite a bit about relationships. In Vietnam, I've dated a few times since 2019 but it was always a disaster as they were either overly jealous, or mainly there for the money. I've been very wary of dating here as I don't trust Vietnamese women's intentions, although my ex wife is a great woman and we still get along very well.

Fast forward to November 2025. There was a female security agent at the parking lot of Mega Market (similar to Walmart and Costco back in Canada) and after a few times seeing her I asked her yolo-style if she had a husband. She told me she was divorced. She's 36. It was instant connection. We had coffee, then we were all over each other.

So, my so called objective opinion right now is that she loves me because I treat her with respect (not a typical man's behaviour around here), she finds me attractive (I've got physical proof, needs to be censured) and I've got the \*financial means\* to improve her life (she never asked for money but I've been treating her relatively well). Disclaimer: she's so beautiful she's out of my league. I've got to be honest, a woman like this would probably not look at me twice in Canada.

1qmkpe5,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1qmkpe5/would_a_reflective_coaching_conversation_be/,Would a reflective coaching conversation be useful right now?,"Hi everyone,

I’m offering a limited number of 1:1 coaching conversations for people who are feeling stuck, overwhelmed, or at a crossroads and would benefit from space to think clearly.

Sessions can be a single 45–60 minute conversation or a short series, depending on fit.

Coaching can be especially helpful if you’re:

• At a career crossroads or considering a transition  
• Feeling stuck, overwhelmed, or burnt out  
• Reflecting on work–life balance or boundaries  
• Noticing repeating patterns in work or relationships  
• Thinking through an important decision or next step

**What to expect**

My approach is reflective, client-led, and grounded in curiosity rather than advice-giving. The focus is on helping you think clearly, reconnect with what matters to you, and move forward in a way that feels aligned.

**Session details**

• 1:1 via Zoom  
• Confidential  
• 45–60 minutes  
• No fixed coaching fee — sessions are offered via a small agreed exchange (for example, a LinkedIn recommendation or coffee), agreed upfront

**About me:**

I work primarily with career clarity, transitions, and personal growth, and I also draw on systems thinking and coaching psychology approaches, which can be helpful if you feel mentally overloaded or stuck in loops.

If this feels relevant, feel free to DM me and we can check fit.",1,1769351755.0,careerguidance,3,1.0,False

1qmkoyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/cymbalta/comments/1qmkoyh/let_me_tell_you_about_cymbalta/,Let me tell you about Cymbalta,"First of all I am not a doctor and everything I say is just my experience and opinion.

I was started on Cymbalta when I was being treated at a hospital center for alcohol abuse. I thought this was strange because I know it can cause liver damage and I already have cirrhosis. The doctors assured me that liver damage is rare and that they frequently prescribe Cymbalta and rarely see liver issues. From my experience that seems to be true, my liver function tests were done weekly and it didn't cause any issues. Being in the hospital I frequently took Cymbalta at the same time every day for almost a month. It does work for relieving depression and anxiety, I assume from increasing chemicals in the brain. For alcoholics (daily drinkers) those chemicals are depleted significantly.

After I got out of the hospital I drank again and sure enough, I could feel it again for the first time in years. This was amazing to me because no matter how long I stopped drinking I was unable to get drunk. This was annoying because I could drink all night and mentally was all there but physically I could barely walk.

So my theory is Cymbalta increased or even started production of the ""feel good chemicals"" in my brain that had been missing for years. I assume it does this for most people and why it is effective.

Now for the bad side effects. I did what you hear everyone do and I stopped taking it because I felt better. I always thought that was stupid when I heard of people doing it but then I went and fucking did it too so I guess I'm also stupid lol. The side effects are brutal, like literally I felt uncomfortable everywhere, I kept moving to different places in my house thinking it would help. 

I was unable to sleep. I would get hallucinations and feel like someone was electrocuting me. It was hell and I started to get afraid to sleep so I was drinking coffee to stay awake. After Googling symptoms, I realized I was in SNRI withdrawal and took a Cymbalta to see if it helped. It DID help but it took hours. Cymbalta is extended release so you will not get immediate relief if you make the same mistake. Alcohol helps a lot but just in general I think once you're on this medication you're stuck with it. I have no idea how I would get off it.",3,1769351728.0,cymbalta,1,1.0,False

A Girl Has Gone Missin' in the Swamp.,"People think they know strange. Hell, before all this, I thought I did too. You see a lot of shit in the military, even more as a private eye. You think you know people. Well, you don't, trust me. There's a whole layer of filth underneath what you think you know. I thought I'd seen strange. Thought I knew weird. Thought I couldn't be shaken. I was wrong. Findin’ the book changed everythin’ for me. You know that sayin’? If you look into the abyss, the abyss looks back? Well it's true. More true than anythin’. All it takes is a glimpse beneath the veil. I wish I had never taken that last job, but it's too late now. I'm gettin’ ahead of myself. Let me start from the beginnin’.

I work in an old port town in the southern USA. The kind of place with rottin’ docks and always smells like rottin’ fish. The kind of place full of superstitious old-timers nd over the top stories. You won't find us on many current maps. This town hasn't been relevant in a long time. I get most of my work from the nearby city. No, I won't tell you which one. Hell, I won't even tell you the name of this town. Last thing I need is more weirdos comin’ here to go missin’ in the nearby swamps. For the sake of reference though let's call the place Portsmouth, nd you can call me James or Jimmy, local PI. Portsmouth is a rottin’ shell of what it was when I was a kid. Used to be a pretty nice place with lots of work. After the fishin' dried up, nd old mine shut down, it kinda just got forgotten about. Who knew that the mine runoff would send the fish runnin’? Who knew the mine would fall short after a decade of steady output? Not my old man. Not any of the other old-timers either, but that's life I suppose. Now the swamplands creep in on one side of us nd the salt water breaks the other.

So it all started bout two weeks ago. I'd just come down from my upper floor apartment down to my office. I was expectin’ a quiet mornin’ but as I walked to my door to unlock it, I saw a letter layin’ in front of it. I picked it up nd looked at the return address. Ellen Peterson from the city close by. Peterson… I didn't recognize the name. Tearin’ the letter open I looked at the contents. A picture fell out of the folded letter as I opened it up. I picked it up nd saw a young dark haired girl, with bright innocent lookin’ blue eyes nd freckles. I went back to the letter.

Dear Mr. Smith,

I write to you out of desperation. My daughter Mary, who came to Portsmouth to visit her grandfather, has gone missing. I've talked to the sheriff, and all I get is “We are working on it.” It's been three days. I know the time window for her to be alive grows smaller and smaller by the hour. Please accept my case. I'll pay whatever you want. You can start by talking to my father, Elias Bell. Thank you in advance. If you need anything please call me at XXX-XXX-XXXX.

With all hope and sincerity, 

Ellen Peterson

Elias Bell… I knew the old man, nd I knew her too now. Ellen Bell ran off with some rich city boy after high school. I checked my watch. Pretty early. The old men would be at the local diner. I stuffed the letter nd photo in my pocket nd grabbed my coat. I stepped out into the cold, wet, fish smellin’ mornin’ air. Time to work.

I stepped into the diner nd shook off the mornin’ damp as I looked round. As usual the old-timers were all huddled up at the long table in the back. What wasn't usual was the hushed voices instead of the rowdy banter that usually accompanies em. A voice from the counter called out to me.

“Hey Jimmy, here for breakfast?” Said the plump woman behind the bar top.

I looked over nd gave her a small smile, “Not today Eileen. Workin. I'll take a coffee though.” She gave me a small nod nd waddled to the pot, fillin’ up a cup nd handin’ it to me. I took a sip nd headed over to the table. The hushed voices stopped as soon as I neared nd a gruff voice on the opposite side called out.

“Guess you're here to see me, eh boy?” Said a shriveled twig of a man in orange waders.

“Yea Elias, I’m here to see you. Ellen contacted me.” I said quietly lookin’ him in the eye. You had to be respectful with these old-timers. You didn't show respect nd pay your dues to the water nd they wouldn't give you the time of day.

Elias nodded slowly, “She said she would. That useless fuck sheriff hasn’t done a damn thing but sit on his fat ass in that comfy office. I don't know how a beached asshole like him got voted in in the first place.” Said Elias angrily, his fist slammin’ into the table as the other old men nodded at his words.

Sheriff Johnson was a fat old man who basically just filled his position in name only. Most the time if any real work needed to be done in this town it was me or Deputy Bellham doing it. The sheriff never set foot in a boat in his life, therefore he wasn't respected by a single person in this town. Though he might've earned some if he actually did his job. 

“Give me the details Elias. Tell me what happened to Mary.” I said, leanin’ on the end of the heavy wooden table.

Elias looked down into his coffee cup. The other old men just watchin’ him patiently as he seemed to gather his recollection. 

“She's been stayin’ with me bout three weeks. Honestly I was surprised she wanted to come out. Ain't nothin in this town for a girl her age. Maybe it's because I dote on her, or she just wanted to get away from her folks, I don't know."" 

He shook his head slowly for a moment before continuin', “Bout five days ago she said she made a friend. I asked her who, but she brushed me off. She was a good girl, so I didn't push the subject. Next day she went out again, came back nd there was a smell hangin’ on her. I knew it, we all do. That swamp smell. I asked her again, who was this friend? Again she tried to brush me off, but I pushed this time. Asked her if it was one of those swamp-dwellers. She hesitated nd that was confirmation enough for me. Maybe I got a bit stern with her. Told her she knows better. Shouldn't be hangin’ round those swamp folk.” 

He paused for a second nd a single tear rolled down his cragged cheek. “Guess she just wanted to placate me, cuz she said ok, nd she wouldn't see em again. I thought that was the end of it. Went out to sea the next mornin’. When I came back she was gone.” 

An old-timer next to him placed a weathered hand on his shoulder as Elias seemed to sink in on himself. I nodded slowly. Last thing I wanted to do was take a trip to the swamplands, but if that's where the trail led, then that's where I was goin’. 

“Alright Elias, I'll look into it, but you know, three days in the swamp.. You know what I'll probably find right?” I said grimly.

Elias looked me in the eye sternly. “You just bring her back boy. One way or the other nd you'll have our gratitude.” The old-timers all gruffed out their assents.

“Alright.” I said standin’ up, ""I'll contact you when I find somethin’.” With that I downed my coffee nd headed out, puttin’ my mug on the bar.

“Be careful out there Jimmy.” Said Eileen with a worried wrinkle in her brow.

I nodded to her as I walked past nd headed back out into the damp mornin’.

As I walked down the pothole covered road I thought about what to do next. I'd need to prepare. No way I was goin’ into the deep swamp unarmed nd I'd need a guide. There was only one person for that. I took a turn nd headed to the bar nearby. Probably the only place in this town open twenty-four seven.

I pushed open the heavy door nd was greeted by the smell of warm booze nd sawdust. Here nd there the local drunks snoozed or talked to themselves in their seats. The lumberjack of a bartender greeted me as I entered.

“Mornin' Jimmy, what can I get ya?” He said in his low cannon of a voice.

“Nothin’ today, Al. Workin'."" He nodded nd looked to the lean figure sittin’ at the bar. Henry looked like a cowboy tryin' to become an alligator. Wearin’ blue jeans with alligator boots, vest nd hat. He sat there sippin’ on his whiskey. He was a muscular, tanned man in a small lean kind of way. A large bowie knife was strapped to his hip like a promise.

I came over nd sat next to him. didn't say a word, didn't have to. In all likelihood he already knew why I was here. He side-eyed me for a moment nd downed the rest of his glass.

“When we leavin’ Jimmy?” He said in his smooth voice.

“Soon as you can get ready Henry.” I stared at him for a moment as he put his glass on the table nd pushed it away.

“Give me bout an hour nd I'll have the boat ready.” He stood up nd looked at me. “Dwellers been real strange lately, Jimmy. Strap heavy for this one. Not sure how they gunna’ react anymore.” I nodded thoughtfully as he stepped out.

Sighin', I got up off the stool nd headed out myself. I walked to my office stoppin’ momentarily to look out on the water. The dark blue water splashed against the decrepit docks. A few boats that have seen better days floated by the parts that were still usable. I remembered the days helpin’ my dad load the boat before goin’ out. Everythin’ seemed brighter back then. I wondered then if this town would survive my lifetime. I turned away nd stepped into my office.

I went through my apartment grabbin’ my gear. Camo boots, waders nd jacket. My .38 for the inside pocket. My .44 on the side of my hip. I debated on rifle or shotgun. In the end I went with the shotgun. I filled my pockets with ammo. When it came to the swamp nd the dwellers it was best to be prepared for anythin’. Was a time when the dwellers nd us got along alright. These days though they were almost completely isolated nd didn't appreciate visitors. If Henry said they were even stranger now.. Then I wasn't really sure what to expect anymore. I grabbed a backpack with some extra gear. Rope, tape, tarp, whatever might be useful if we got in trouble or had to bring back Mary in the worst case scenario. 

I stepped onto the docks, the weight of my gear remindin' me of my time in the army. Henry sat in his flat bottomed boat. Rifle slung over his shoulder nd pistol strapped to the hip where his knife wasn't. I tossed my bag in nd climbed inside. Henry lit a cigarette before startin’ up the motor. He took a drag nd started movin’ away from the dock. 

We headed up the coast. When we reached the channel that would lead us to the swamplands I looked up from inspectin’ my weapons.

“So how bad is it now, Henry?” I said watchin’ him expertly guide the boat.

Blowin’ out a puff of smoke, Henry looked back at me. “Pretty bad Jimmy. They're more paranoid than ever. More dangerous. Last month I came out to check my traps. Caught one comin’ up behind me, knife out. Fucker was covered in swamp mud, practically naked cept some cloth round his junk. Felt like I was seein’ tribesfolk in the Amazon or somethin’. Couldn’t understand a word the fuck said either before I made him silent.”

I looked at Henry for a long moment. There's an unspoken rule out here. What happens in the swamp stays in the swamp. It rarely happens but this town sometimes takes justice into its own hands. When they do.. They take it to the swamp. I decided I didn't wanna ask anymore questions nd went back to my inspections.

As we headed further inland the tree growth grew thicker, nd the canopy above blocked out the sun. Henry wove us between the trees nd kept us away from too shallow waters. We were movin’ slow. As I looked round I didn't really notice much of anythin’. Then I noticed that I really didn't notice anythin’. No movement. No birds makin’ noise overhead. No movement under the water's surface. Even the flies nd mosquitos were awol.

“Henry what the hell is goin’ on out here?” I asked in a whisper. I'm not sure why, but I had a feelin’ I needed to stay quiet. Had a feelin’ there were eyes on us. Henry just looked back at me. His expression was like stone as he turned back to guide us through. I readied my shotgun nd crouched into a stable position scannin' the area. I couldn't see anythin’, but I knew they were there. My instincts screamed danger as we moved ever deeper into the dark swamp.

Suddenly below us there was a boom. Before I could react the boat flipped up into the air, water splashin’ up round us before I was sinkin’ down in it. The filthy swamp swallowed me. Its foul taste fillin’ my mouth as I struggled to regain my senses. I flipped nd turned, losin’ all sense of direction. Blindly I swam where I thought the surface was, instead I met mud nd roots. Turnin’ I swam the opposite direction. I finally breached the surface inhalin’ the stale air, quickly lookin’ round for Henry. There was land nearby nd on the edge I saw him. Muddy hands dragged him from the water nd held him to the ground. I looked at the savage muddy faces. I couldn't believe these were the same dwellers. They had become absolutely feral, lookin’ like tribesfolk of some kind. As I looked, a figure stepped from the shadows, a woman bare chested nd covered in mud, wearin’ some kind of tribal headdress. 

She knelt down beside Henry as she pulled out the jagged, wicked lookin' dagger, nd he began to fight even harder against his captors. The woman raised the dagger high above her head shoutin’ in some language I'd never heard before, nd then, she looked at me. Bright green eyes looked at me. Too bright. Too green, or not quite green. Pain started to rip through my head as we stared into each other's eyes, but then she turned away, nd plunged the dagger down into Henry's heart. He gasped loudly as the blade struck home, his body twitchin before fallin’ still.

The dwellers stood then, all turnin’ towards me. Green eyes, but not quite green. Slowly they stepped back into the shadows, disappearin’ from view, but I knew they were still there, watchin’ me as I carefully made my way to the muddy earth where Henry lay. I struggled up the muddy banks to Henry's body, catchin’ my breath nd lookin’ down at him. He was gone. His eyes wide in terror nd slack jawed. Lookin’ round me, the shadows of the swamp seemed to deepen. My head felt tight, like somethin’ was pushin’ it from either side. Images of my time in the desert flashed in my head, but they were different, monochrome in color. Grey sands, black rocks nd dark sky, but there was a light somewhere, a greenish light. 

I shook my head nd reached for my weapons. The shotgun was gone nd so was the .38, but my .44 was still strapped to my hip. I pulled it out breathin’ slow, tryin' to calm myself. I scanned the area, but the light of the day was fadin’ fast nd the dark shadows lengthenin’. I took inventory of my ammo, eighteen bullets includin’ what was already loaded. I reached to Henry's side nd grabbed his knife. Then I moved.

The sun began to dip lower as I walked through the stinkin’ mud. I estimated my direction, tryin’ to move south towards the coast. The swamp grew darker nd darker as I stumbled forward. My flashlight was in my pack, lost somewhere in the swamps murky water. So I kept goin’, stayin’ quiet nd watchin’ my surroundin’s. Now nd then I’d see some movement, but it'd be gone as soon as I turned to look. My head seemed pounded harder the further I went. Eventually the sun vanished, plungin’ me into darkness. Through the canopy above I could see some stars, but I couldn't figure em out. Twinklin’ mockeries of our own constellations, but different enough that I couldn't figure out my directions. So I kept on, hopin’ I was movin’ straight, but knowin’ I probably wasn't. 

“James..” A whisper came from my right. I turned, holdin’ my gun forward in front of me. I couldn't see anythin’ but the shadows. They seemed to blur in my vision nd I quickly rubbed my eyes to try nd clear em.

“Come James..” Another from behind me. I spun, wavin’ my revolver side to side, scannin’ the area in front of me. Again nothin’ but blurred, twistin’ shadows.

I started to run. I moved awkward nd slow, the mud suckin’ at my boots with each step. The whispers came again all round me.

“James.. Come James.. Chosen James..” The cacophony of whisperin’ voices. My head pounded. My disorientation buildin’ nd buildin’ till finally I collapsed into the slick mud. 

Then there was light. Green flames lightin' up on torches all round me, held aloft by mud covered, green-eyed dwellers. I sat up raisin’ my gun once again. 

“Stay back!” I screamed as I waved my gun between the dozen or so individuals surroundin’ me. Then I noticed it. As I moved my weapon in front of me, two more torches lit up revealin’ a stone table covered in mold nd a rust colored substance. Round it were corpses, corpses mummified in a wet, sticky way that only a swamp can produce. Two of em were kneelin’ before the stone table, nd held aloft in their hands was a large leather bound book.

The figures of the dwellers stood in place round me. I stood up, gun still raised nd lookin’ at each of em. Then I felt a pull. Somethin’ in my mind tellin’ me to look forward again. I turned back, my eyes fallin’ on the strange book held up in those skeletal hands. Strange words were etched into the leather. 

Liber Smaragdi Luminis Aeterni

A shadow behind the altar seemed to shimmer nd a figure came forward. The woman from before, her green eyes lockin’ on my own as she approached the table. She raised her hands high up into the air.

“Electus Regis Smaragdi Venit! Gaudeamus in eius lapsu ad insaniam!” She yelled over us, her voice manic nd eyes fevered as she looked round.

I looked closer at her mud covered face as she looked at me from behind the altar. A wide grin spread across her face. Then recognition hit me.

“Mary? Mary, your mother sent me! I'm here to help you get home!” I yelled at her. 

She kept starin’ at me. “Domum sum… in lumine ipsius” She whispered at me.

Suddenly pain ripped through my skull nd I dropped to my knees, my vision blurrin'. I looked up to see hollow sockets nd wide toothy grins meet my gaze. An emerald light began to emanate from their dark eyes as skeletal hands grabbed nd held me down. I struggled with all my might as all round me the flames grew brighter as mud covered figures burst into eldritch flame.

I heard Mary's voice rise up, “Recipe nos, Rex Nativus ex Vacuao!” Another bright green flame grew from the direction of the table. Suddenly two green lights filled my vision. My eyes burned nd my head throbbed nd then, everythin’ went dark.

I opened my eyes to that monochrome landscape. Grey sand nd black rock with a toilin’ black sky high above me, but as before there was a light. A light like liquid emerald floatin’ nd reflectin’ off the monochrome surfaces round me. I turned in its direction to see a tall black misshapen tower of inconceivable geometry. At its top was the source of the light. A figure was there, behind its head a halo of that alien light. My mouth gaped open as I dropped to my knees. It was so close, yet so far away, nd to my horror I wanted to be closer. 

Shadowy tendrils slowly slipped down from the roilin’ sky round the figure. It reached a long clawed hand towards me as if beckonin’ me to take it. I reached out to it, nd suddenly I was there, kneelin’ before the loomin’ figure now only a few feet away from me. It turned its faceless head towards me nd reached down. Its large hand pressin’ to my chest. Pain flared from its touch burnin’ me nd forcin’ out a scream I didn't even realize I could emit from my body.

Its voice ripped through my skull, tearin’ my mind apart with each word. “Awaken child and see truth around you.” 

Then darkness took me once again.

I awoke a week later in a hospital bed. Sittin’ in a chair near me was Elias’s bony form. Images of hollow eyes nd skeletal grins flashed through my mind nd I yelped closin’ my eyes nd pressin’ my palms into em.

“Jimmy.. Boy what happened to you out there?” Elias said quietly. I kept my eyes shut.

“Don’t let anyone in the swamp Elias… nobody can go in there!” I practically screamed at him. 

He stepped back warily. “Yeah, okay boy. I'll tell everyone to stay out. Jimmy.. What happened to Mary? To Henry?” He asked hesitantly.

I opened my eyes then nd looked at Elias with a manic expression. “They’re gone Elias! Gone! There's nothin’ left!” I shouted loudly. Elias ran to the door best he could, yellin’ for a doctor to come.

I spent about a month in that hospital. I've forgotten things. I know I have. Everythin’ here is what I can remember. At least I think it is. Honestly I don't know what is completely real about this story anymore. What I do know is that I see things slippin’ into the shadows from the corners of my eye. I know that I have a certain instinct about things now. I know that when I got home the large leather-bound book was sittin’ on my bed. I know the handprint-like scar on my chest shimmers green in a certain light. I know that when I look in the mirror.. I see emerald eyes starin’ back at me.",1,1769351545.0,scifishorts,1,1.0,False

Currently settled in a different state with business & home

Thought to move back to madurai and build a new house, already there is a old house but issues are too small 23ft roads and not so good car park and i can't even do anything as the opposite and nearby commercial shops are parking their bikes around. 

In the last 2 years after repeated visits I'm doubting my decision yo move here because of 
all the roads, 
bad layout, 
police issues at night ( read few about this on reddit),
 too much politics, can't even get a plan approval for building a building
Even prime area like kk nagar gets drowned during rains, whole city is a swimming pool
No place to park cars except for hotels like amma mess and gowri parvathi bhavan. Everywhere cramped, dusty roads. 
Washing car in the morning, by afternoon it is covered in dust. 
Noise pollution - every place with marriage halls and mosques & mini commercial manufacturing units

Did i made a bad decision of purchasing some properties here? 

Pretty much there is nothing to do. I don't drink or smoke. Nice place to have coffee means lara is only in travellable distance. McD is in far end of the city and they don't want to open another branch as they say they have completed the expansion project of mcD by having a icecream counter in vishal d mall. 

Vishal D mall is very old and faded out interiors. Washrooms are very bad. Cramped / full parking once again 

Cafe means high price food, where as gowri parvathi bhavan gives full meals in 150, lara coffee is higher than that. 

The list goes on. The newly opened poco panda is nothing but high risk of getting hurt, Pavam madurai people have not seen a proper play area for kids 

Blue pipe water takes 4 days to fill a 2000L tank. 
They say additional fees for getting drainage connected line now. 

No traffic sense, people coming in opposite direction on the iyer bunglow flyover 

Shops under the bridge have no car parking.

We're a small team of 4 engineers from Slovenia. We spent two years building what we believe is **the most responsive, repairable, firmware-upgradable precision scale built for daily ritual use.**

The hardware is production-ready. Now we need your help deciding what software features actually matter.

https://preview.redd.it/boahdlrs5ifg1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=307c75cfe3b1a43b529c22fb6a3d04b5c77e05aa

# Why we built this

Existing scales frustrated us:

* Non-intuitive UIs that require a phone app for basic features
* Capacitive touch buttons that fail when wet
* Sealed units designed for replacement, not repair

So we built something different: a physical knob, a straightforward on-device UI, and no app required for core functionality. The app extends the experience - it doesn't gate it.

https://preview.redd.it/ulmes9su5ifg1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4820cfc8379a8f55f3e239f25c0d4e81b4304a37

# Hardware

|**Body**|CNC-machined aluminum unibody, tempered glass top|
|:-|:-|
|**Control**|Stainless steel knurled knob with RGB feedback + haptics|
|**Display**|OLED, OCA-bonded under glass|
|**Capacity**|3kg / 0.1g resolution|
|**Sample rate**|40 Hz with adaptive filtering|
|**Auto-start**|Accelerometer detects pump vibration via FFT (works with any machine)|
|**Battery**|\~20 hours, USB-C charging|
|**Connectivity**|BLE 5.1|
|**Repairability**|Battery, USB-C board, load cell - all user-replaceable|
|**Origin**|Designed and manufactured in Slovenia, EU|

The rigid aluminum frame combined with a high-aspect load cell means accurate readings even with off-center loads.

# Current state

Firmware handles weighing well - we've put serious effort into the filtering pipeline for readings that are both fast and stable. Espresso mode (timer, flow rate), pour-over mode, and core functionality all work on-device.

The companion app (iOS/Android) currently handles pairing, firmware updates, and diagnostics. We're now deciding what ""smart"" features are worth building.

**This is where we need your input.**

# What we're asking

* **How do you actually use your current scale?** What's your workflow?
* **What frustrates you?** What's missing or broken?
* **What would make you switch?** Not ""what sounds cool"" - what would change how you make coffee?

We're not listing feature ideas because we want *your* priorities, not responses anchored to our assumptions. We'll release a software roadmap proposal in the next 14 days once we've gathered your feedback and merged it with our vision.

# Integrations & SDK

We're committed to openness:

* **Open SDK** \- Android, iOS, Flutter, Python libraries for BLE integration
* **Vendor documentation** for third-party integrations
* **Active support** and firmware updates for sensible integration requests

The BLE module is fully programmable. If your espresso machine has an SDK, we can likely integrate. If it doesn't and there's strong interest, we're also willing to do a bit of reverse engineering :).

**What integrations would actually be useful to you?**

# Timeline

* **Ship date:** Q4 2026
* **Now → then:** Software development based on community feedback

We'll reach out privately to contributors who provide deep, concrete feedback about sending sample units in Q2 2026 for real-world testing.

To follow along, join the mailing list at [**fluent-gear.com**](https://fluent-gear.com) (work in progress, but mailing list is working :)) - we'll announce when Signature Edition pre-orders open (first batch, name engraved).

**Happy to answer questions about the hardware, our approach, or anything else.**

1qmkfrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SciFiStories/comments/1qmkfrx/im_a_local_pi_for_a_small_port_town_people_are/,I'm a Local PI For a Small Port Town. People Are Walkin' into the Water. (Part 02),"Parents always tell you there's no such thing as monsters. I'm not so sure about that anymore. What if you look into the dark nd find there actually is somethin’ there? Nobody prepares you for the loss of sleep. Nobody prepares you for the utter fear of seein’ that shadow in the corner actually start movin’. You always think there' s somethin’ you can do about it. Let me tell you straight, there ain’t. Once the dark knows you're there, there ain' t nothin’ you can do to keep it from findin’ you.

I’d been out the hospital bout’ two weeks nd it ain’t been no walk in the park. Ever since the swamp, things have been.. off. Maybe that's an understatement, but it's hard to describe what's happenin’ to me. I see things now, in the shadows. I see things movin’, shapes nd figures in the dark. I leave the lights on in my apartment now, but that doesn't stop the dreams. I see that impossible tower in its monochrome landscape. I see that eerie green light flowin’ like water as if it’s alive. I see Mary.

I awoke early, nd immediately knew somethin’ was wrong. The room was dark and quiet. I stayed still,that conjures demons from the dark. Then I felt the cold hand slide over my bicep nd grip firmly. It pulled me onto my back nd I couldn't help but look next to me. Layin’ there starin’ at me with those emerald glowin’ eyes was Mary, practically naked except for the sheer green garment she was wrapped in. She was no longer the mud-covered fanatic I met in the swamp. She was clean nd ghostly pale, luminescent even. Suddenly her eyes rolled back into her head nd her mouth gaped open wide. A thick, slimy black tendril pushed its way out of her mouth as I watched in horror. I pushed myself away, fallin’ onto the floor. My body hit the ground nd with a blink the world changed. It was mornin’, nd the gulls cawed loudly outside my window. I looked at the empty bed nd sagged into myself lettin’ out the breath I didn't realize I was holdin’.

I took my time gettin’ ready, tryin’ to put back together my frayed nerves. As I finished, I looked in the direction of my safe where I had stashed that heretical book. I tried lookin’ at it before, but as soon as I saw the best possible rendition of the Emerald Tower I locked it away. I knew I'd have to look at it some time, but that time wasn’t today, nor hopefully any time soon. I quickly finished up, suddenly wantin’ to be as far from that safe as possible, when I heard a knock on my office door.

“Great..” I muttered to myself as I began headin’ down.

I unlocked the door nd opened it slightly, turnin’ around without lookin’ nd headin’ to my desk.

“Mornin’ deputy.” I said as I grabbed the whiskey bottle nd poured a bit into the cold coffee still on my desk from yesterday.

“How’d ya know it was me?” said Deputy Tom Bellham as he stepped into the door, closin’ it behind him.

“Just a feelin’ Tom.” I said, as I popped two Seltzer tabs into the coffee as well nd stared at it as it bubbled nd frothed. I've been havin’ those too, feelin’s, like my intuition has skyrocketed to new heights.

I side-eyed Tom as he stepped further into my office. I could tell he was uncomfortable. Most people around here have treated me differently since the swamp incident. Maybe it’s because of the rumours of what happened or maybe it's because of my newly green eyes. Could be both for all I know, but I've learned not to make eye contact anymore.

“So did you need somethin’ Tom, or did you just come to stand here?” I said takin’ a sip of my mornin’ concoction.

Tom shifted his feet a bit before answerin’. “I’m guessin’ you ain’t heard the news lately, Jimmy?”

“No Tom, I haven't heard any news. Been sorta keepin’ to myself lately.” I said starin’ into my coffee cup.

“Yea...” Tom said, before continuin’ hesitantly, ""We've had some strangeness in town, Jimmy. Two people are dead.”

I looked at Tom for a moment, his eyes shiftin’ away quickly from mine. “Sounds like your jurisdiction Tom, not mine.”

Tom lets out a long sigh before speakin’, “yea I know Jimmy, but I’m at a loss on this, nd you know the sheriff isn't doin’ a damn thing about it. I could use your help on this one.”

I nodded lookin’ away again nd finishin’ the rest of my coffee. “Alright Tom, tell me what’s goin’ on.” I said walkin’ round my desk nd sittin’ in my chair.

Tom sat down nd went into the details. Apparently the two people died exactly the same way. Both had drowned, but the strange thing was they were found the next day shriveled nd untouched by the water life. Also it’s reported that the second actually walked into the water themselves, nd there’s some evidence the first did the same, though there’s no witnesses. The coroner report basically said the bodies were drained of all fluids. Which is hard to believe since they apparently died in the ocean.

I leaned back in my chair as Tom finished his explanation. “I’m not really sure what I can do with that Tom, not much to go on there.”

Tom nods thoughtfully for a moment, “Yea I know Jimmy, just maybe look into it for me, see if there’s anythin’ I missed.”

“Yea alright, I can do that for you, just keep me updated.” I said.

“Alright Jimmy. Thanks.” He said gettin’ up from his chair. “I’ll see ya round.”

With that Tom walked out the door leavin’ me to ponder the situation. If I didn't know better I'd say this was all coincidence, but even in normal situations, coincidences are a rare thing.

I mulled over things for a moment. Most likely both deaths occurred sometime in the night. I doubt visitin’ the site durin’ the day would yield anythin’ new. Tom may be the only real law in town, but he was pretty thorough. What I could do was talk to the witness of the second incident, Debbie Thornwell. I looked up at the clock nd sighed. Better now than later I suppose.

I got up from my desk, grabbin’ my jacket nd headin’ to the door.

The mornin’ air was brisk as I walked down the damp streets of Portsmouth. The familiar scent of rottin’ fish hangin’ in the cold air. A light fog hung stubbornly as I passed abandoned shops, the sun not yet warm enough to send it to its grave. I pulled up my collar to try nd block the chill wind nd turned down the street to Debbie's home. I looked up at the ramshackle house before walkin’ up its creaky steps nd knockin’ on the door.

The door cracked open, the swollen wood givin’ some trouble before releasin’ the door from its confines. I could see a sliver of Debbie's face, eyes swollen on her weathered face.

“Jimmy, what do you need hun? It ain’t a good time.” She said wearily, lettin’ the door creep open a little more.

“Yea I know Debs. I’m helpin’ Tom with the situation. Just wanted to go over what you saw the other night. Also, I'm sorry for your loss.”

“Everybody’s sorry Jimmy. Doesn't change the fact my husband walked into the sea without any warnin’ or reason.” She said with a heavy sigh. “Come on in Jimmy.”

She opened the door further lettin’ me into the home. Despite outward appearances the inside was warm, cozy nd well lit. I stopped inside nd followed her into the livin’ room where she sat in a well worn lazyboy. Another sat not too far from her, also well worn. I decided to sit on the couch. I sat nd waited for her to begin. There wasn't any rush nd I wasn't gonna push her to start.

“It was bout three in the mornin’ when I felt him get out of bed. At first I thought he was just goin’ to the bathroom, but when I realized the light hadn't turned on I sat up. Bout a minute later I heard the front door open. That door doesn't open without makin’ a hell of a ruckus. So I got up grabbin’ my robe nd headed down to see what the hell he was doin’. When I came down the door was just wide open. I looked down the street nd I see the crazy old bastard walkin’ down the road in his pajamas. I called out to him but he just kept goin’, didn't even look back, like he couldn't hear me at all. So I went after him. I tell you what, Jimmy. I don't think I've seen that old man move that fast in a decade. I chased him down as best I could, but I couldn't catch up. That's when I realized we were headin’ towards the beach. As we got closer I noticed somethin’ though, a smell, like right before a big thunderstorm. Anyway, I get to the beach nd there he was, kneelin’ by the water with his arms raised like he is praisin’ the Lord. I was bout to yell out to him again nd move closer, but I swear Jimmy, there was somethin’ movin’ under that water. I may be old, but my sight is still as good as ever. Next thing I know that fool jumps into the sea. Then he was just… gone. He never came back up, Jimmy.” As she finished a couple tears spilled down her cheeks.

I didn't say anythin’ at first. This whole thing had a bad smell to it, just like the swamp case did. My heart started poundin’ as anxiety at the thought started buildin’ inside me. I closed my eyes nd took a deep long breath to steady my nerves before lookin’ back at her.

“Was he doin’ anythin’ before all this Debs? Maybe somethin’ unusual or somethin’?” I asked.

“I don't think so, Jimmy. Well, actually the day before he was askin’ the sheriff bout the other man who died. It was one of his friends from his fishin’ days. They worked on the same boat together.” She said. “You think that has somethin’ to do with this?”

I shook my head. “No, I’m sure it's nothin’ Debs” I lied. “Thanks for goin’ over this with me. I appreciate it.”

She nodded slowly as she watched me get up nd head to the door.

“Take care of yourself Debs.” I said as I stepped back out into the cold, pullin’ the door shut behind me.

The sheriff huh? Odd thing for a man to die the exact same way after askin’ about the previous victim. If the sheriff is involved I'd have to keep an eye on him. Askin’ him about it would only tip him off if he did. I made my trek back to my office as I pondered what to do next. I turned onto the street for the docks nd saw a small crowd ahead of me. I walked over to see what the commotion was about. There were bout fifteen people by a boat. All of them were talkin’ to the captain. A man by the name of Emmet PowelI. I stopped nd listened to the conversation. 

“Was over by the dead reef.” He said loudly. “I pulled up my nets nd they were completely full! Net after net we cast. Hell, my boat's almost full right now!” He said laughin’ nd puffin’ out his chest.

Strange. Every now nd then there's a somewhat decent haul from a lucky boat, but nothin’ like that. It's been bout twenty years since any boat came full into these docks. I didn't like it. I didn't like any of this. I turned away nd headed to my office. Somethin’ was wrong here, nd unfortunately it seemed I'd be the one to have to figure it out.

For the next two days I kept an eye on Sheriff Johnson. This basically consisted of sittin’ outside the sheriff office doin’ absolutely nothin’ nd bein’ bored out of my mind. Eventually he finally broke his routine. The first thing I noted which was strange, was he actually stayed late at the office. Usually from what I had seen he leaves as quickly as possible headin’ straight home. This time though, he didn't leave till close to midnight. This actually caused me a bit of trouble, since I had to follow him extra carefully, often losin’ sight of him because nobody else was walkin’ the streets to give me any cover for bein’ out there so late. Even so, this wasn't my first rodeo. I kept out of sight, followin’ him through the streets to the edge of town. 

As the sheriff made his way through the brush I kept my distance. Only movin’ forward when I lost sight of him. I realized we were headin’ pretty close to the beach where the victims were found, just further away from the actual shore. Finally he stopped, looked around nd headin’ behind a brush covered dune. I waited, watchin’ to see where he went next, but he never came around. Slowly nd quiet-like I made my way towards the dune. I kept a wide distance nd circled to where he should have been. There in the dune was an openin’. A dark cave sat there goin’ downwards into the earth. I was about to head in when I heard a noise. Someone else was comin’, so I backed off findin’ a large brush area nd ducked down into it. Another figure came into view, cloaked in some kind of robe. They went into the cave, quickly disappearin’ into the darkness. I decided to wait to see if anyone else showed up. The last thing I wanted was to go in just to have myself pincered between these people.

I sat waitin’ in that brush nd counted five more cloaked figures that went into that cave. Knowin’ I was outnumbered nd not wantin’ to get myself into an impossible situation, I stayed sittin’ in that brush. I figured I'd wait till they all left nd explore this cave afterwards. So I waited, waited for hours until they finally came out. They darted off quickly, includin’ the sheriff. After makin’ sure the coast was clear I got up nd headed to the cave. I took one last look around nd then looked back. It was gone. Literally just disappeared in the time I had taken my eyes off it. I pressed a hand to the dune nd felt nothin’ but sand. My stomach dropped. I had hoped this wouldn't be another weird ass situation. All hope of that vanished at that moment. What the hell was goin’ on in this town?

I got back to my office nd plopped into my chair. For a while I just stared at the ceilin’, wonderin’ what the hell I should do next. My eyes slowly shifted to my safe. I got up with a sigh nd moved to it. With shakin’ hands I unlocked it, takin’ a deep breath before turnin’ the handle nd openin’ the door. The leatherbound tome sat right where I left it, unassumin’ yet ominous in my mind. I removed it from the safe nd took it back to my desk openin’ it hesitantly. The impossible tower glared at me from the page. I could practically see the emerald light emanatin’ from its peak. I quickly turned the page. The text was some form of cuneiform, but I could understand, in a way. Like a whisper in the back of my mind.

“His light shines through time and space, blessing us who are chosen.

The chosen await the seeker to breach the veil.

May He walk amongst us, showing us the truth of the abyss.”

Even bein’ able to read it didn't make it any more understandable. The next page showed another picture with script underneath it. A jewel shone on the page, I could guess what kind of light emanated from its depths.

“It connects us to the void, to Him.

It is the key, a small piece of His light.

Through shattered dreams the way will open.

The dweller of the deep holds the key’ where the black pyramid keeps vigil.”

Dweller of the deep… the name itself made me nauseous. I closed the book, feelin’ a bit ill. Memories of the swamp flooded my brain. The smell of burnin’ flesh fillin’ my nostrils. I grabbed the nearby trash bin, vomitin’ what little food I had eaten earlier in the day. My head swam as I lifted myself back up. My vision blurrin’ as the light seemed to dim. Shadows shifted around the blurred tunnel of my vision. Hands gently cupped my face as it was lifted to meet green eyes. Another pair covered my eyes from behind, leavin’ me in darkness. Suddenly, thick soft rope-like appendages wrapped around my wrists, the slick leathery flesh tightenin’ around them nd pullin’ me down to my knees. Before I could scream another wrapped around my throat nd squeezed tight.

“Shhh…” A feminine whisper reached my ears, “You're almost there James… so close..”

I awoke to the sun stingin’ my eyes. My body was prone on the floor of my office in an awkward position. I pushed myself up, feelin’ sore nd stiff. I could still feel the moist undulatin’ appendages on my wrists nd neck. I looked down at my wrists. where large bruises wrapped around them. I assumed there was one on my neck as well. My hands began to shake as I pressed them into my chest, just sittin’ there as I tried to calm myself. Eventually I got up off the floor, my gait unsteady as I went back to my desk chair nd sat down. I picked up my phone nd dialed in a number.

“Tom, I need your help.”

Tom sat in my office as I explained what I discovered. I had to give the guy credit. He listened to every word I said before callin’ me crazy.

“Jimmy, I think you're losin’ your shit.” He stated matter of factly. “A cave that disappears. The sheriff part of some cult. I don't like the guy either, but that doesn't mean he is worshippin’ Satan, nd what the hell happened to your neck?”

“It's not Satan, Tom.” I said with a sigh, ignorin’ his inquiry bout my bruises. “I don't know what it is honestly, but it's bad. Listen, you ain’t gotta believe me, I'll show you. Just wait for my call nd meet me here.” I pointed out a spot on a map of the town nd surroundin’ areas. The same spot where the cave appeared before. “Just when you get there stay hidden nd keep an eye out. You'll see, Tom, I swear to you.”

Tom eyeballed me for a good ten seconds before respondin’ with a look like he was entertainin’ a child. “Fine Jimmy, but if this turns out to be bullshit then you better go get some help.”

I nodded to him nd with one long last look he turned around nd left the office. I leaned back in my chair as I watched him go, fiddlin’ with a pen on my desk as I contemplated my next move. I'd have to wait again. I'd have to watch the sheriff nd call Tom the next time he stayed late at the office. I felt bad gettin’ Tom involved, but I barely made it out alive from the swamp, nd I had help back then too. I'd have to be more careful this time. I had to make sure we both survived whatever encounter awaited us in that cave.

Another long, borin’ week passed by. I watched the sheriff the same as before, nd just like before he followed the same routine, until he didn't. When the sheriff was two hours past his usual leavin’ time I called Tom. 

“Tonight Tom. Be there before midnight, nd be armed.” I said into the phone before hangin’ up, not waitin’ for a response.

When he left about thirty minutes before midnight I followed. I was just as careful as before, no, perhaps even more careful. I didn't even see him step into the cave because I stayed so far behind. I circled the dune of the cave just like before, headin’ to the same hidin’ spot I had used previously. As I neared it a hand grabbed my jacket nd pulled me down into the brush. It was Tom, lookin’ at me all bug-eyed.

“Jesus Tom, you nearly made me piss myself.” I said, swallowin’ down the scream that almost erupted from my throat.

“Yea, you're freaked out?” Said Tom, his voice shakin’ slightly. “How do you think I feel? What the fuck is this Jimmy?”

“I already told you, be quiet, more people are gonna show up.” I said, turnin’ my attention to the cave entrance.

As if on queue more people showed nd entered the cave. Tom nd I watched silently until I counted the same amount of people walkin’ in as before. We waited a small bit longer. I didn’t wanna be caught off guard by extras possibly showin’ up to whatever this was. I got up from the ground nd motioned for Tom to follow quietly. He was hesitant at first, but I saw him set his jaw, eyes narrowin’ in a newly determined look as he nodded nd began to follow. He drew his pistol nd I drew my own revolver in response. Then, we headed into the cave.

The cave was dark, damp nd cold. It got so dark at one point we had to keep a hand on the wall to keep our bearin’. We walked for a long time. How long I don't know. The lack of light made it hard to guess time or any kind of distance traveled. Then I smelled it. There was a scent of ozone in the area, growin’ stronger as we moved. Ahead of us a cold bluish light began to shine into the tunnel. Soon I could see an exit nd as we neared it I looked back at Tom. He looked back at me wide-eyed, sweat drippin’ down his brow. Turnin’ back I stepped onto the narrow path beyond the stiflin’ tunnel.

I stopped dead in my tracks as I saw what lay before us. Tom ran into my back before grabbin’ my shoulder nd steadyin’ himself. I swear I heard a small whimper escape from him as he did, but I didn't blame him as I looked at our surroundin’s. We were on a narrow bridge-like path, one side had a ledge about waist high nd every so often a torch jutted up from it burnin’ with a bluish white flame. There was  nothin’ holdin’ up the gray lookin’ rock we stood on. To our left was a drop that seemed to go at least a hundred feet before meetin’ black still water. I felt drops of wetness splatterin’ down on us now nd then, nd lookin’ up I was met with another lake of the same black water, only this time grey lights shifted beneath it, or above it? Some of the lights were single, others in pairs, some in strange clusters. I pulled my gaze away to look further down the bridge. There in what seemed like miles ahead of us, yet only a few hundred feet was a black pyramid, juttin’ out of the water. Dark obelisks surrounded it, the surfaces of all were smooth nd seamless as if made of single pieces of obsidian. I realized then the only color around us was the blue of the flames, nd it faded into the same greyish light that seemed to illuminate our path.

I felt Tom's hand shakin’ on my shoulder. I quickly looked back nd took his head in my hands turnin’ it to face me.

“Don’t look too hard, Tom. Don't think too hard. Focus on me. Don’t let it enter your mind ok?” I said, lookin’ into his shaky eyes to see if he understood. He swallowed hard nd seemed to focus on me just a bit better. “Listen, if you need to go back, then go back. I won't blame you. Do what you have to do, Tom.”

He seemed to look at me then, really look. Then he closed his eyes, swallowed hard nd took a deep breath. Finally he opened them nd his gaze seemed much more solid. 

He grimaced nd shook his head. “No Jimmy, I can't leave you here alone, nd.. I need to see what this is. I can't turn back now.”

I nodded nd patted his shoulders, grateful for him stickin’ at my side. I turned around nd began to walk the path to either death or madness.

The walk to the pyramid was silent nd short. Much shorter than should have been expected. As we reached the entrance, a smooth rectangular entryway that showed no signs of a builder's touch, I looked back. The exit from the tunnel wasn't even visible, as if we had walked miles from where we started. We entered the pyramid. I took one wall while Tom took the other. We both moved forward slowly. As we made our way further inside, carved murals began to show on the walls. I say carved, but once again there was no sign of tool marks, just smooth glass-like rock formin’ strange pictures. Some showed humanoid creatures that seemed to be mixed with an angler fish. Fins jutted from their arms nd long teeth from their mouths. Their eyes were bulbous on their fish-like heads. I saw the tower again depicted in another carvin’. Its shape more true than the picture in the grimoire, but not quite as blasphemous as the visions I had seen. Either way it hurt my eyes to look upon them. They seemed to shift nd move without actually doin’ so. I looked away nd saw Tom opposite me rubbin’ his eyes. I looked at him raisin’ an eyebrow to silently ask if he was doin’ ok. He looked back with reddened eyes nd nodded. His face fixed into a look of grim determination as we continued our way further into the pyramid’s depths.

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/SciFiStories/comments/1qmke8v/im_a_pi_for_a_local_port_town_a_girl_has_gone/)

As we delved deeper we began to hear somethin’. There was a chantin’ comin’ from ahead. I gripped my revolver tighter as we walked. Tryin’ to be silent as a chamber opened ahead of us. We stayed back in the entryway when we reached the room. It was round nd tall. We could see the cloaked figures standin’ in a circle. Their arms were up as they chanted in a language that reminded me of the cultists in the swamp, but it was what sat in the middle that truly put fear in my heart. Sittin’ center was a large, mummified creature. It had to be at least thirty feet tall sittin’ down. I could see the sharp teeth juttin’ from its dried gums. Dry, dead eyes sat bulbously on the sides of its withered head. Long skeletal arms came down its sides nd folded in its lap, endin’ in webbed nd clawed hands. In front of its dried husk floated an object omittin’ a familiar emerald light. It was the jewel from the book, floatin’ nd pulsin’ with the chants of the people around it. This must be the dweller in the deep.

The ceilin’ was the same black water from outside. And as we watched a figure fell from the water. It was one of the townsfolk. That same fisherman who had been braggin’ bout his impossible catch. As we stood watchin’ he writhed on the ground in front of the jewel. Then slowly his flesh began to sink in on itself. He grew thinner nd thinner until just like the creature before him, he became nothin’ but a dried husk of a man. He let out one final gasp of breath before one of the hooded figured picked him up nd carried him to a small slot in the wall. He pushed the corpse into it nd a splash was heard after a moment.

Tom stood on the opposite wall from me mouth agape as he looked into the room. I tried to silently get his attention but his eyes were fixed. Tears began drippin’ from them as he stood unblinkin’. I made my way quietly to his side nd turned him away from the nightmarish sight. He blinked stupidly at me for a moment before wipin’ his eyes nd liftin’ his pistol. Then he looked me dead in the eye. I knew then we weren't leavin’ this place without a fight. Noddin’ I lifted my revolver as well, turnin’ towards the room nd takin’ aim.

The next moments were a blur of muzzle flashes nd movin’ bodies. We fired again nd again. The people there fallin’ to the ground one by one as we shot them down. We didn’t think, didn't have to. We would end this blasphemy here nd now. I pulled my trigger over nd over till only clicks came from my gun. The empty cylinder spinnin’ with each pull of my finger. Tom stood beside me as both of us lowered our weapons. Tears streamed down his face as he looked around, his gun still smokin’ from expendin’ its magazine. My eyes were fixed however. The jewel pulled me closer to it nd soon I was standin’ before it, lookin’ into its emerald depths. I felt Tom's hand on my shoulder nd his voice registered in my ears.

“Jimmy, we have to go man.” He said lookin’ at me.

I reached out a hand to the jewel, when suddenly another movement caught my eye beyond it. The creature. I stared for a moment nd felt Tom's hand grip my shoulder even harder. One of the fingers on that horrendous clawed hand began to curl slowly inward. 

We both turned nd took flight. I don't remember gettin’ outside but suddenly we were both on the sandy ground heavin’ in breath. I looked back behind us, but the cave was gone once again. I stood up weakly lookin’ at Tom nd smilin’ the best I could.

“We did it Tom. We stopped them, nd made it out in one piece.” I said with a small chuckle of relief.

But Tom wasn't smilin’, he wasn't even lookin at me. Instead he was lookin’ down at my hand where I held my gun, his face givin’ off a sickly green glow.

“Tom, what's wrong?” I said lookin’ down at my hand.

It wasn't my gun. It was the jewel, glowin’ brightly in my grip nd coverin’ us with its strange greenish light. I felt terror grip my chest as I looked at it. When did I grab it? How did I not realize it was in my hand? Then I felt somethin’ cold nd wet hit my neck once, then again. I looked up nd saw small flakes of snow fallin’ from a dark cloudy sky. It didn't snow here.

A Girl Has Gone Missin' in the Swamp.,"People think they know strange. Hell, before all this, I thought I did too. You see a lot of shit in the military, even more as a private eye. You think you know people. Well, you don't, trust me. There's a whole layer of filth underneath what you think you know. I thought I'd seen strange. Thought I knew weird. Thought I couldn't be shaken. I was wrong. Findin’ the book changed everythin’ for me. You know that sayin’? If you look into the abyss, the abyss looks back? Well it's true. More true than anythin’. All it takes is a glimpse beneath the veil. I wish I had never taken that last job, but it's too late now. I'm gettin’ ahead of myself. Let me start from the beginnin’.

I work in an old port town in the southern USA. The kind of place with rottin’ docks and always smells like rottin’ fish. The kind of place full of superstitious old-timers nd over the top stories. You won't find us on many current maps. This town hasn't been relevant in a long time. I get most of my work from the nearby city. No, I won't tell you which one. Hell, I won't even tell you the name of this town. Last thing I need is more weirdos comin’ here to go missin’ in the nearby swamps. For the sake of reference though let's call the place Portsmouth, nd you can call me James or Jimmy, local PI. Portsmouth is a rottin’ shell of what it was when I was a kid. Used to be a pretty nice place with lots of work. After the fishin' dried up, nd old mine shut down, it kinda just got forgotten about. Who knew that the mine runoff would send the fish runnin’? Who knew the mine would fall short after a decade of steady output? Not my old man. Not any of the other old-timers either, but that's life I suppose. Now the swamplands creep in on one side of us nd the salt water breaks the other.

So it all started bout two weeks ago. I'd just come down from my upper floor apartment down to my office. I was expectin’ a quiet mornin’ but as I walked to my door to unlock it, I saw a letter layin’ in front of it. I picked it up nd looked at the return address. Ellen Peterson from the city close by. Peterson… I didn't recognize the name. Tearin’ the letter open I looked at the contents. A picture fell out of the folded letter as I opened it up. I picked it up nd saw a young dark haired girl, with bright innocent lookin’ blue eyes nd freckles. I went back to the letter.

Dear Mr. Smith,

I write to you out of desperation. My daughter Mary, who came to Portsmouth to visit her grandfather, has gone missing. I've talked to the sheriff, and all I get is “We are working on it.” It's been three days. I know the time window for her to be alive grows smaller and smaller by the hour. Please accept my case. I'll pay whatever you want. You can start by talking to my father, Elias Bell. Thank you in advance. If you need anything please call me at XXX-XXX-XXXX.

With all hope and sincerity, 

Ellen Peterson

Elias Bell… I knew the old man, nd I knew her too now. Ellen Bell ran off with some rich city boy after high school. I checked my watch. Pretty early. The old men would be at the local diner. I stuffed the letter nd photo in my pocket nd grabbed my coat. I stepped out into the cold, wet, fish smellin’ mornin’ air. Time to work.

I stepped into the diner nd shook off the mornin’ damp as I looked round. As usual the old-timers were all huddled up at the long table in the back. What wasn't usual was the hushed voices instead of the rowdy banter that usually accompanies em. A voice from the counter called out to me.

“Hey Jimmy, here for breakfast?” Said the plump woman behind the bar top.

I looked over nd gave her a small smile, “Not today Eileen. Workin. I'll take a coffee though.” She gave me a small nod nd waddled to the pot, fillin’ up a cup nd handin’ it to me. I took a sip nd headed over to the table. The hushed voices stopped as soon as I neared nd a gruff voice on the opposite side called out.

“Guess you're here to see me, eh boy?” Said a shriveled twig of a man in orange waders.

“Yea Elias, I’m here to see you. Ellen contacted me.” I said quietly lookin’ him in the eye. You had to be respectful with these old-timers. You didn't show respect nd pay your dues to the water nd they wouldn't give you the time of day.

Elias nodded slowly, “She said she would. That useless fuck sheriff hasn’t done a damn thing but sit on his fat ass in that comfy office. I don't know how a beached asshole like him got voted in in the first place.” Said Elias angrily, his fist slammin’ into the table as the other old men nodded at his words.

Sheriff Johnson was a fat old man who basically just filled his position in name only. Most the time if any real work needed to be done in this town it was me or Deputy Bellham doing it. The sheriff never set foot in a boat in his life, therefore he wasn't respected by a single person in this town. Though he might've earned some if he actually did his job. 

“Give me the details Elias. Tell me what happened to Mary.” I said, leanin’ on the end of the heavy wooden table.

Elias looked down into his coffee cup. The other old men just watchin’ him patiently as he seemed to gather his recollection. 

“She's been stayin’ with me bout three weeks. Honestly I was surprised she wanted to come out. Ain't nothin in this town for a girl her age. Maybe it's because I dote on her, or she just wanted to get away from her folks, I don't know."" 

He shook his head slowly for a moment before continuin', “Bout five days ago she said she made a friend. I asked her who, but she brushed me off. She was a good girl, so I didn't push the subject. Next day she went out again, came back nd there was a smell hangin’ on her. I knew it, we all do. That swamp smell. I asked her again, who was this friend? Again she tried to brush me off, but I pushed this time. Asked her if it was one of those swamp-dwellers. She hesitated nd that was confirmation enough for me. Maybe I got a bit stern with her. Told her she knows better. Shouldn't be hangin’ round those swamp folk.” 

He paused for a second nd a single tear rolled down his cragged cheek. “Guess she just wanted to placate me, cuz she said ok, nd she wouldn't see em again. I thought that was the end of it. Went out to sea the next mornin’. When I came back she was gone.” 

An old-timer next to him placed a weathered hand on his shoulder as Elias seemed to sink in on himself. I nodded slowly. Last thing I wanted to do was take a trip to the swamplands, but if that's where the trail led, then that's where I was goin’. 

“Alright Elias, I'll look into it, but you know, three days in the swamp.. You know what I'll probably find right?” I said grimly.

Elias looked me in the eye sternly. “You just bring her back boy. One way or the other nd you'll have our gratitude.” The old-timers all gruffed out their assents.

“Alright.” I said standin’ up, ""I'll contact you when I find somethin’.” With that I downed my coffee nd headed out, puttin’ my mug on the bar.

“Be careful out there Jimmy.” Said Eileen with a worried wrinkle in her brow.

I nodded to her as I walked past nd headed back out into the damp mornin’.

As I walked down the pothole covered road I thought about what to do next. I'd need to prepare. No way I was goin’ into the deep swamp unarmed nd I'd need a guide. There was only one person for that. I took a turn nd headed to the bar nearby. Probably the only place in this town open twenty-four seven.

I pushed open the heavy door nd was greeted by the smell of warm booze nd sawdust. Here nd there the local drunks snoozed or talked to themselves in their seats. The lumberjack of a bartender greeted me as I entered.

“Mornin' Jimmy, what can I get ya?” He said in his low cannon of a voice.

“Nothin’ today, Al. Workin'."" He nodded nd looked to the lean figure sittin’ at the bar. Henry looked like a cowboy tryin' to become an alligator. Wearin’ blue jeans with alligator boots, vest nd hat. He sat there sippin’ on his whiskey. He was a muscular, tanned man in a small lean kind of way. A large bowie knife was strapped to his hip like a promise.

I came over nd sat next to him. didn't say a word, didn't have to. In all likelihood he already knew why I was here. He side-eyed me for a moment nd downed the rest of his glass.

“When we leavin’ Jimmy?” He said in his smooth voice.

“Soon as you can get ready Henry.” I stared at him for a moment as he put his glass on the table nd pushed it away.

“Give me bout an hour nd I'll have the boat ready.” He stood up nd looked at me. “Dwellers been real strange lately, Jimmy. Strap heavy for this one. Not sure how they gunna’ react anymore.” I nodded thoughtfully as he stepped out.

Sighin', I got up off the stool nd headed out myself. I walked to my office stoppin’ momentarily to look out on the water. The dark blue water splashed against the decrepit docks. A few boats that have seen better days floated by the parts that were still usable. I remembered the days helpin’ my dad load the boat before goin’ out. Everythin’ seemed brighter back then. I wondered then if this town would survive my lifetime. I turned away nd stepped into my office.

I went through my apartment grabbin’ my gear. Camo boots, waders nd jacket. My .38 for the inside pocket. My .44 on the side of my hip. I debated on rifle or shotgun. In the end I went with the shotgun. I filled my pockets with ammo. When it came to the swamp nd the dwellers it was best to be prepared for anythin’. Was a time when the dwellers nd us got along alright. These days though they were almost completely isolated nd didn't appreciate visitors. If Henry said they were even stranger now.. Then I wasn't really sure what to expect anymore. I grabbed a backpack with some extra gear. Rope, tape, tarp, whatever might be useful if we got in trouble or had to bring back Mary in the worst case scenario. 

I stepped onto the docks, the weight of my gear remindin' me of my time in the army. Henry sat in his flat bottomed boat. Rifle slung over his shoulder nd pistol strapped to the hip where his knife wasn't. I tossed my bag in nd climbed inside. Henry lit a cigarette before startin’ up the motor. He took a drag nd started movin’ away from the dock. 

We headed up the coast. When we reached the channel that would lead us to the swamplands I looked up from inspectin’ my weapons.

“So how bad is it now, Henry?” I said watchin’ him expertly guide the boat.

Blowin’ out a puff of smoke, Henry looked back at me. “Pretty bad Jimmy. They're more paranoid than ever. More dangerous. Last month I came out to check my traps. Caught one comin’ up behind me, knife out. Fucker was covered in swamp mud, practically naked cept some cloth round his junk. Felt like I was seein’ tribesfolk in the Amazon or somethin’. Couldn’t understand a word the fuck said either before I made him silent.”

I looked at Henry for a long moment. There's an unspoken rule out here. What happens in the swamp stays in the swamp. It rarely happens but this town sometimes takes justice into its own hands. When they do.. They take it to the swamp. I decided I didn't wanna ask anymore questions nd went back to my inspections.

As we headed further inland the tree growth grew thicker, nd the canopy above blocked out the sun. Henry wove us between the trees nd kept us away from too shallow waters. We were movin’ slow. As I looked round I didn't really notice much of anythin’. Then I noticed that I really didn't notice anythin’. No movement. No birds makin’ noise overhead. No movement under the water's surface. Even the flies nd mosquitos were awol.

“Henry what the hell is goin’ on out here?” I asked in a whisper. I'm not sure why, but I had a feelin’ I needed to stay quiet. Had a feelin’ there were eyes on us. Henry just looked back at me. His expression was like stone as he turned back to guide us through. I readied my shotgun nd crouched into a stable position scannin' the area. I couldn't see anythin’, but I knew they were there. My instincts screamed danger as we moved ever deeper into the dark swamp.

Suddenly below us there was a boom. Before I could react the boat flipped up into the air, water splashin’ up round us before I was sinkin’ down in it. The filthy swamp swallowed me. Its foul taste fillin’ my mouth as I struggled to regain my senses. I flipped nd turned, losin’ all sense of direction. Blindly I swam where I thought the surface was, instead I met mud nd roots. Turnin’ I swam the opposite direction. I finally breached the surface inhalin’ the stale air, quickly lookin’ round for Henry. There was land nearby nd on the edge I saw him. Muddy hands dragged him from the water nd held him to the ground. I looked at the savage muddy faces. I couldn't believe these were the same dwellers. They had become absolutely feral, lookin’ like tribesfolk of some kind. As I looked, a figure stepped from the shadows, a woman bare chested nd covered in mud, wearin’ some kind of tribal headdress. 

She knelt down beside Henry as she pulled out the jagged, wicked lookin' dagger, nd he began to fight even harder against his captors. The woman raised the dagger high above her head shoutin’ in some language I'd never heard before, nd then, she looked at me. Bright green eyes looked at me. Too bright. Too green, or not quite green. Pain started to rip through my head as we stared into each other's eyes, but then she turned away, nd plunged the dagger down into Henry's heart. He gasped loudly as the blade struck home, his body twitchin before fallin’ still.

The dwellers stood then, all turnin’ towards me. Green eyes, but not quite green. Slowly they stepped back into the shadows, disappearin’ from view, but I knew they were still there, watchin’ me as I carefully made my way to the muddy earth where Henry lay. I struggled up the muddy banks to Henry's body, catchin’ my breath nd lookin’ down at him. He was gone. His eyes wide in terror nd slack jawed. Lookin’ round me, the shadows of the swamp seemed to deepen. My head felt tight, like somethin’ was pushin’ it from either side. Images of my time in the desert flashed in my head, but they were different, monochrome in color. Grey sands, black rocks nd dark sky, but there was a light somewhere, a greenish light. 

I shook my head nd reached for my weapons. The shotgun was gone nd so was the .38, but my .44 was still strapped to my hip. I pulled it out breathin’ slow, tryin' to calm myself. I scanned the area, but the light of the day was fadin’ fast nd the dark shadows lengthenin’. I took inventory of my ammo, eighteen bullets includin’ what was already loaded. I reached to Henry's side nd grabbed his knife. Then I moved.

The sun began to dip lower as I walked through the stinkin’ mud. I estimated my direction, tryin’ to move south towards the coast. The swamp grew darker nd darker as I stumbled forward. My flashlight was in my pack, lost somewhere in the swamps murky water. So I kept goin’, stayin’ quiet nd watchin’ my surroundin’s. Now nd then I’d see some movement, but it'd be gone as soon as I turned to look. My head seemed pounded harder the further I went. Eventually the sun vanished, plungin’ me into darkness. Through the canopy above I could see some stars, but I couldn't figure em out. Twinklin’ mockeries of our own constellations, but different enough that I couldn't figure out my directions. So I kept on, hopin’ I was movin’ straight, but knowin’ I probably wasn't. 

“James..” A whisper came from my right. I turned, holdin’ my gun forward in front of me. I couldn't see anythin’ but the shadows. They seemed to blur in my vision nd I quickly rubbed my eyes to try nd clear em.

“Come James..” Another from behind me. I spun, wavin’ my revolver side to side, scannin’ the area in front of me. Again nothin’ but blurred, twistin’ shadows.

I started to run. I moved awkward nd slow, the mud suckin’ at my boots with each step. The whispers came again all round me.

“James.. Come James.. Chosen James..” The cacophony of whisperin’ voices. My head pounded. My disorientation buildin’ nd buildin’ till finally I collapsed into the slick mud. 

Then there was light. Green flames lightin' up on torches all round me, held aloft by mud covered, green-eyed dwellers. I sat up raisin’ my gun once again. 

“Stay back!” I screamed as I waved my gun between the dozen or so individuals surroundin’ me. Then I noticed it. As I moved my weapon in front of me, two more torches lit up revealin’ a stone table covered in mold nd a rust colored substance. Round it were corpses, corpses mummified in a wet, sticky way that only a swamp can produce. Two of em were kneelin’ before the stone table, nd held aloft in their hands was a large leather bound book.

The figures of the dwellers stood in place round me. I stood up, gun still raised nd lookin’ at each of em. Then I felt a pull. Somethin’ in my mind tellin’ me to look forward again. I turned back, my eyes fallin’ on the strange book held up in those skeletal hands. Strange words were etched into the leather. 

Liber Smaragdi Luminis Aeterni

A shadow behind the altar seemed to shimmer nd a figure came forward. The woman from before, her green eyes lockin’ on my own as she approached the table. She raised her hands high up into the air.

“Electus Regis Smaragdi Venit! Gaudeamus in eius lapsu ad insaniam!” She yelled over us, her voice manic nd eyes fevered as she looked round.

I looked closer at her mud covered face as she looked at me from behind the altar. A wide grin spread across her face. Then recognition hit me.

“Mary? Mary, your mother sent me! I'm here to help you get home!” I yelled at her. 

She kept starin’ at me. “Domum sum… in lumine ipsius” She whispered at me.

Suddenly pain ripped through my skull nd I dropped to my knees, my vision blurrin'. I looked up to see hollow sockets nd wide toothy grins meet my gaze. An emerald light began to emanate from their dark eyes as skeletal hands grabbed nd held me down. I struggled with all my might as all round me the flames grew brighter as mud covered figures burst into eldritch flame.

I heard Mary's voice rise up, “Recipe nos, Rex Nativus ex Vacuao!” Another bright green flame grew from the direction of the table. Suddenly two green lights filled my vision. My eyes burned nd my head throbbed nd then, everythin’ went dark.

I opened my eyes to that monochrome landscape. Grey sand nd black rock with a toilin’ black sky high above me, but as before there was a light. A light like liquid emerald floatin’ nd reflectin’ off the monochrome surfaces round me. I turned in its direction to see a tall black misshapen tower of inconceivable geometry. At its top was the source of the light. A figure was there, behind its head a halo of that alien light. My mouth gaped open as I dropped to my knees. It was so close, yet so far away, nd to my horror I wanted to be closer. 

Shadowy tendrils slowly slipped down from the roilin’ sky round the figure. It reached a long clawed hand towards me as if beckonin’ me to take it. I reached out to it, nd suddenly I was there, kneelin’ before the loomin’ figure now only a few feet away from me. It turned its faceless head towards me nd reached down. Its large hand pressin’ to my chest. Pain flared from its touch burnin’ me nd forcin’ out a scream I didn't even realize I could emit from my body.

Its voice ripped through my skull, tearin’ my mind apart with each word. “Awaken child and see truth around you.” 

Then darkness took me once again.

I awoke a week later in a hospital bed. Sittin’ in a chair near me was Elias’s bony form. Images of hollow eyes nd skeletal grins flashed through my mind nd I yelped closin’ my eyes nd pressin’ my palms into em.

“Jimmy.. Boy what happened to you out there?” Elias said quietly. I kept my eyes shut.

“Don’t let anyone in the swamp Elias… nobody can go in there!” I practically screamed at him. 

He stepped back warily. “Yeah, okay boy. I'll tell everyone to stay out. Jimmy.. What happened to Mary? To Henry?” He asked hesitantly.

I opened my eyes then nd looked at Elias with a manic expression. “They’re gone Elias! Gone! There's nothin’ left!” I shouted loudly. Elias ran to the door best he could, yellin’ for a doctor to come.

I spent about a month in that hospital. I've forgotten things. I know I have. Everythin’ here is what I can remember. At least I think it is. Honestly I don't know what is completely real about this story anymore. What I do know is that I see things slippin’ into the shadows from the corners of my eye. I know that I have a certain instinct about things now. I know that when I got home the large leather-bound book was sittin’ on my bed. I know the handprint-like scar on my chest shimmers green in a certain light. I know that when I look in the mirror.. I see emerald eyes starin’ back at me.",1,1769351002.0,SciFiStories,0,1.0,False

USA based.  Today's storm has finally convinced me to get prepared in advance of the next outage. My requirements are:

1. Buy from Costco preferably
2. charge by plugging into household electric
3. optional solar panels for recharge, could buy in future, don't really need them yet
4. enough power for 3 days for two 1500 watt sealed oil radiator heaters, run a coffee maker for 15 minutes a day, and a 1000 watt microwave for 10 minutes a day

If it's more cost effective I could buy two smaller units if that means I would be more likely to run the 1500 watt heaters for 3 days each

Thanks very much!
