She was employed 3 years ago and we‚Äôve been best friends ever since. We do things together such as coffee, shopping, out of country trips. Lahat ng problema namin sa office at sa personal life, alam namin. Everything changed when a new workmate came in the picture. 

Newbie (29F) is funny, loud and nice but not my type to be my friend. I am a very reserved person and I don‚Äôt trust easily. Days went by and I saw biglang naging close si bff and newbie. Pag kasama ko si bff, sinasabi nya na hindi nya gusto si Newbie pero after a few days mag uupload si  newbie na nagcocoffee sila ni bff. I didn‚Äôt mind at first.

Lately, I found out another workmate has been spreading rumours about me. Lumabas pala si bff, newbie and the other workmate. They had coffee and talked about me, I got knowledge of this dahil newbie reached out to me the day after. Man, i felt betrayed. Sobrang sakit. Newbie is not my friend but she had the audacity to tell me what was happening. I did not expect this from her but I expected it kay bff since she was my friend. I treated my bff as my sister yet habang pinag uusapan ako, she never bothered to tell me anything. Kahit ‚ÄúUy te alam mo ba kahapon may mga sinabi about you si ganito‚Äù. Wala. I waited 3 days, wala siyang sinabi. Sa 3 days na yon umiiyak ako not because pinag usapan ako but because I felt betrayed. If a friend of mine is being talked about, I‚Äôd let that friend know immediately. I‚Äôd have her back. Pero si bff wala eh, parang wala lang sakanya. Nasaktan ako dahil bakit ganon sila kakomportable na pag usapan ako sa harap ni bff knowing na alam ng lahat na magkaibigan kami.
After 3 days I told her na alam ko na ang pinagsasabi nila about me. Ang sabi lang nya ‚Äúay alam mo ba may kwento ako yan‚Äù. I just replied ‚Äúnako wag na ayaw ko mastress hehe‚Äù so I‚Äôve decided to cut her off. Maybe we weren‚Äôt on the same page after all. ",1,1755152331.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

## Key Features analysis

The quality and performance of gable table legs depend on several key features that directly impact their durability,stability,and aesthetic appeal.

**Material:** The material used in the construction of gable table legs is paramount. Typically, these legs are crafted from solid hardwoods like maple, oak, walnut, or pine. Hardwoods offer superior strength and resistance to wear and tear, ensuring the legs can support the weight of the tabletop and withstand daily use. The choice of wood also influences the leg's appearance, with options ranging from the light, clean look of maple to the rich, dark tones of walnut. The type of wood selected affects finishes achievable.

**Dimensions and Height:** Accurate dimensions are crucial for achieving the desired table height and proportions. Gable table legs are available in a variety of heights, typically ranging from coffee table height (16-18 inches) to dining table height (28-30 inches) and bar height (40-42 inches). The width and thickness of the legs also play a role in their stability and load-bearing capacity. It's essential to measure your tabletop and consider the intended use of the table to select legs with appropriate dimensions.

**Construction and Joinery:** The way the gable table legs are constructed greatly influences it's overall strength and stability. Look for legs with solid, well-executed joinery, such as mortise-and-tenon or dovetail joints, which provide superior structural integrity compared to simpler joinery methods like screws or nails. The quality of the construction ensures the legs can withstand stress and resist wobbling or loosening over time.**Finish and Detailing:** The finish of the gable table legs contributes substantially to their aesthetic appeal and durability. Options include unfinished (allowing for custom staining or painting), pre-finished with a clear coat or stain, or painted with a solid color. The level of detailing, such as decorative carvings or turned elements, can also enhance the legs' visual appeal and complement the overall style of the table. A well-applied finish protects the wood from moisture and scratches, extending its lifespan.**Weight Capacity:** An significant factor to consider is the weight capacity of the gable table legs, especially for larger or heavier tabletops. Manufacturers typically specify the maximum weight the legs can safely support. Exceeding this weight limit can compromise the legs' structural integrity and lead to instability or even failure. Choose legs with a weight capacity that exceeds the weight of your tabletop and any anticipated load.

Key features of gable table legs include:

* Durable hardwood construction
* Sturdy joinery for stability
* variety of heights and dimensions
* Customizable finishes and detailing
* High weight capacity

## FAQs section

**Are gable table legs challenging to install?**

My girlfriend and I just made it back to Lakewood, WA after an incredible trip on our 2022 Navis. We were gone just under three weeks, with about ten solid days of riding time. We camped most of the way, but stayed with friends in Reno, Sacramento, and Oakland to break things up.

# Route Highlights

* Camped in Mt. Hood National Forest.
* Crossed east on Barlow Road ‚Üí stranded in Warm Springs Reservation for a night ‚Üí nearly slid off a 500ft cliff into the Deschutes River.
* Goose Lake on the OR/CA border ‚Üí Reno via US-395.
* On the return: Sacramento ‚Üí Oakland ‚Üí Paradise, CA ‚Üí Lassen NF ‚Üí Deschutes NF near La Pine ‚Üí Portland ‚Üí back home.

# The Ride

We brought along disposable film cameras (digitized later), so the photos are a little overexposed ‚Äî proper Gen Z energy, not quite knowing how to use them. But they captured the vibe: insane gravel/dirt/rock sections, close calls, jaw-dropping landscapes, and the kind of memories you only get from traveling slow and scrappy. We almost died more times than we can count, but we also saw the most beautiful corners of the American West and had the most fun of our lives.

# Our Setup

* **Tires:** Michelin City Grip 2 (110/70-12 front, 120/70-10 rear) on mine, Shinko SR723 whitewalls (same sizes) on hers
* **Luggage:** Kemimoto soft saddlebags (both bikes)
* **Fuel:** Off-brand Amazon flat gas cans (1.3 gal each) mounted to racks
* **Suspension:** Stock

# Notes

If people are interested, I‚Äôll put together our full mapped route and make it public. We made a lot of decisions on the fly, so it‚Äôll take me a little time to recreate it properly.

If you‚Äôve ever thought about taking your Navi further than a coffee run, ask away. I‚Äôm happy to share about fuel range, camping strategies, gear setup, or just what it‚Äôs like to live on two 110cc bikes for weeks.

**Final thought:** Don‚Äôt wait for the perfect bike or the perfect moment. Adventure doesn‚Äôt need 1200cc ‚Äî sometimes 110cc is more than enough.

You turned your head, already knowing. There it was.

Jenny üí´

1 new message.

Your heart skipped the way it always did with her. You opened it slowly like unwrapping something fragile.

‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ I just got into bed. Mom gave me a look but didn‚Äôt say much. I think she knew I needed tonight. I don‚Äôt even know what to say. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve smiled like that in a long time.‚Äù

Then, a pause. The little dots flashed on the screen.

‚ÄúWhen I was driving home, I kept replaying everything. Your arms. Apollo snoring next to me. That couch. That hug. That kiss. You felt like safety. Like I could just be.‚Äù

Your breath caught. The kind of text that made the whole room lean in to listen.

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt expecting to feel that way tonight. But I‚Äôm glad I did. I‚Äôm really, really glad I did.‚Äù

Then, another pause. More dots.

‚ÄúGoodnight, Lucas. I‚Äôll be dreaming of you tonight. And I‚Äôll probably still be smiling in the morning.‚Äù

You stared at the screen, your thumb hovering unsure what to say back right away. Because sometimes, love doesn‚Äôt need a perfect reply.

Just presence. Just feeling. Just‚Ä¶ her. You typed, slowly:

‚ÄúSleep well, Jenny. I‚Äôm still holding you, even if it‚Äôs just in my dreams.‚Äù

Send.

And then you set the phone down. Smiling. Heart full. The night wasn‚Äôt empty anymore. She was still with you.

**Part XI: The Next Morning**

The sun came gently, as if it knew not to wake you too fast. It slipped through the slats of the blinds and scattered across the room, painting golden stripes over the couch cushions, the photo frames, the stillness. But you were already awake.

You hadn‚Äôt really slept not in the way most people do. You had drifted in and out, holding onto the warmth of the memory she left behind.

The ghost of her head on your shoulder still lingered. So did the weight of her hug, the way her lips met yours like she meant it.

You checked your phone, not out of habit but hope.

Nothing new.

But that last message was still there. You reread it, letting her words pour into you like coffee.

‚ÄúYou felt like safety. Like I could just be.‚Äù

You smiled to yourself. Pulled the blanket closer. Apollo, still curled on the other end of the couch, twitched his ears but didn‚Äôt wake.

You whispered, almost as if she were still beside you:

‚ÄúGood morning, Jenny.‚Äù

Then came the ding.

Your phone lit up again.

Jenny üí´

1 new message.

‚ÄúMorning. I woke up with my cheek pressed against my pillow and for a second I swore it was your shoulder. I didn‚Äôt want to move.‚Äù

You sat up slowly, every part of you lighting up like a sunrise.

‚ÄúAlso, I think I have dog hair on my jeans. So I guess that means I‚Äôm officially part of the Apollo fan club?‚Äù

You laughed. Actually laughed. It was soft, but real.

You typed:

‚ÄúYou were initiated the moment he rested his head on your lap. That‚Äôs the highest honor in this house.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlso‚Ä¶ I miss you.‚Äù

She replied almost instantly:

‚ÄúI miss you too.‚Äù

And somehow, just like that, the morning didn‚Äôt feel empty. It felt like the beginning of something. Like possibility. Like a first page, even though you were already so many chapters in.

You stood up, stretched, glanced around the house and it already looked different. Not because anything changed.

But because she‚Äôd been there. And now the air knew her name.

**Part XII: A Conversation That Could‚Äôve Lasted Forever**

You didn‚Äôt expect it to ring. Not really. Not yet.

But there it was her name lighting up your screen. **Jenny** üí´ Not a text. A call.

You answered it like you‚Äôd been waiting for it all day. Because you had.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù you said, voice still a little hushed, still carrying the weight of all the things you didn‚Äôt know how to say yet.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she answered, light and a little sleepy. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt wake you up, did I?‚Äù

You smiled. ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôve been up. Just‚Ä¶ missing you.‚Äù

There was a silence not awkward, but the kind that happens when two people are smiling on opposite ends of the line.

‚ÄúI can still feel your arms around me,‚Äù she said finally. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever felt that safe. Like‚Ä¶ my entire body just let go for the first time.‚Äù

You leaned your head back on the couch and exhaled. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly how I felt when you laid your head on my shoulder. Like the world could fall apart outside and I‚Äôd be okay as long as you were there.‚Äù

The conversation opened from there like a flower in sunlight.

You talked about everything how tired she was after barely sleeping, how your coffee didn‚Äôt taste right without her sitting beside you. How Apollo was moping around like he, too, had just said goodbye to someone special.

Jenny laughed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve ruined my routine, you know that?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow so?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said with a teasing tone, ‚ÄúI used to wake up, scroll for a bit, brush my teeth, and start my day. Now I wake up thinking about your shoulder. And your dog. And your stupid perfect hoodie that smells like you and I *might* have taken.‚Äù

You grinned. ‚ÄúI knew it. I was looking for that.‚Äù

She laughed again, and it was music. Real and melodic.

Then it got quiet for a second. The way things do when something deeper is trying to push its way through.

‚ÄúI keep replaying last night in my head,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd I think it scared me a little.‚Äù

You sat forward. ‚ÄúScared you how?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause it felt real. And good. And I‚Äôm not used to good staying.‚Äù

Your voice softened. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be a moment, Jenny. I want to be a constant. If you let me.‚Äù

There was a pause.

Then: ‚ÄúI want that too.‚Äù

The conversation stretched across the day like sunlight through windows. You talked about music, childhood memories, favorite smells, the weirdest things you each kept in your junk drawers. She confessed her love for midnight snacks and how she sometimes talks in her sleep. You told her about B, and she didn‚Äôt laugh she asked questions. She got it.

Hours passed.

Lunch came and went. Afternoon drifted in lazily. But neither of you wanted to hang up.

‚ÄúDo you realize we‚Äôve been on the phone for four hours?‚Äù she finally said, half amazed.

‚ÄúCould‚Äôve been four minutes or four days,‚Äù you replied. ‚ÄúTime‚Äôs different with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hang up,‚Äù she said quietly.

‚ÄúThen don‚Äôt.‚Äù

So you didn‚Äôt.

You stayed on the phone as you walked around your house, folded laundry, made a sandwich. She read aloud from a book she was halfway through. At some point, Apollo barked at something outside and she asked you to turn the camera on just so she could see his face.

It was everything and nothing all at once.

And as the sun began to dip behind the neighborhood rooftops, and the sky turned soft with evening, you whispered into the line¬†

‚ÄúThank you for calling.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I needed to,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúToday‚Ä¶ and maybe always.‚Äù",1,1755151607.0,LoveLetters,1,1.0,False

So yeah, there are a few here that might have tag buddies on Ao3 (example: soulmate au), but if so, consider it an 'amuse bouche' of the genre then. I most likely will be following up with some tighter au lists such as 'Phoenix is an actual Phoenix au', 'Vampire au', and my personal weakness: 'Soulmates au ‚ù§Ô∏èüíô'



Anyways!  Here is a selection of some of my favourite Narumitsu alternative universe fics. I think this is my largest list so far so get comfy! And trust me, there *will* be more. And as usual, they are in no particular order because in every universe, and in every timeline, ~~I am a chaos gremlin~~ fan fics are to be loved and celebrated, not ranked :p

I put both links in because technically it is a series, but I read it like one big fic. It's so good. I've never even seen Pacific Rim but who cares? This series is so well written, you don't need to have seen the movie. Fantastically strong characterization and world building with our favourite characters. Mostly Apollo-centric I'd say but very strong Narumitsu, Trucy, Maya, Ema and Pearls in the background. Angel makes her presence known too ;)  Ugh, just do yourself a favour and read it.

Decide for yourself.,"I built an interactive fiction generator that I've been using for over a year now, always trying out new models. It uses structured outputs to ensure adherence to a schema that I use for the UI (for example, when returning a narrative, it also returns a paragraph-by-paragraph plan, a summary of events, and a set of objects to use as ongoing memories for ""world state"")

For this test: I asked OpenAI GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Google Gemini 2.5 Pro to pitch a story with this input: ""A dark, hard sci-fi story about the accidental creation of a strangelet during an experiment at the LHC."" Each one was told to write a pitch (including a title, log line, and character bios), and I accepted the first one the model spit back. Then, the opening scene was requested, in 8-12 paragraphs.

Here are the results (model names in spoiler tags). Read all three before

**Model A**

>Three a.m. in the ATLAS control room tasted like burnt coffee and ozone. A low, persistent hum vibrated up through the soles of Aris Thorne‚Äôs worn sneakers, the collective thrum of a sleeping god. Before her, a four-story wall of monitors bathed her in a universe of blue and green light, each screen a torrent of data from the heart of the Large Hadron Collider. She leaned forward, her reflection a pale ghost against the cascading numbers, a messy bun escaping its clip, her eyes burning with an intensity that had outlasted three consecutive caffeine IV drips.

>""Energy levels at 13.9 tera-electron-volts, Dr. Thorne,"" a young post-doc named Olivier murmured from a nearby console, his voice tight with awe and terror. ""We are‚Ä¶ significantly beyond stated operational limits.""

>""Stated limits are for discovering things we already expect, Olivier,"" Aris shot back without looking at him, her fingers flying across her keyboard, coaxing, commanding. ""We're not here to be safe. We're here to be right."" Her mentor, Dr. Anya Sharma, had been crucified for the theory‚Äîthe math that predicted stable strange matter. They called her a crank, a Cassandra of pseudoscience. Vindicating her was a debt Aris intended to pay, no matter the cost.

>""Proton bunches aligned. Collision in ten‚Ä¶ nine‚Ä¶"" The synthesized voice of the control system was chillingly serene. Aris held her breath, the hum of the facility seeming to crescendo into a single, piercing note in her skull. Her whole life, her entire professional reputation, was collapsing into this one infinitesimal point in time and space. This is for you, Anya.

>""‚Ä¶three‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶ one‚Ä¶ Impact.""

>There was no bang. No shudder. Just a flash on the central event display‚Äîa blindingly pure, white starburst that blossomed and vanished in a nanosecond. In its wake, where there should have been a chaotic spray of exotic particles, there was‚Ä¶ nothing. A void. A single, black pixel at the heart of the collision analysis. An absolute zero in a sea of data.

>Olivier gasped. ""What was that? A sensor failure? Did we get anything?"" He sounded like a child on Christmas morning who‚Äôd just unwrapped an empty box.

>But Aris didn't answer. She stared at the black pixel, a knot of ice forming in her stomach. It wasn't a failure. It was too perfect. She frantically pulled up the sub-target mass spectrometer readings. The numbers scrolled, and the ice in her gut spread to her limbs. The target‚Äîa microscopic lead-ion lattice‚Äîwas supposed to have been annihilated. Instead, its mass was‚Ä¶ increasing. Slowly. Impossibly. A positive integer where there should be a rounding error.

>""It's converting,"" she whispered, the words catching in her throat. The strangelet wasn't just stable; it was acting as a seed crystal. It was pulling in adjacent quarks, flipping them to 'strange' quarks, and adding their mass to its own. A subatomic parasite. A single point of infinite gravity, born and feeding.

>Her mind raced. Containment. Magnetic bottle. I can hold it. Her hands flew to the failsafe controls for the superconducting magnets surrounding the impact chamber. She slammed the enter key. An error message bleated back at her: ACCESS DENIED ‚Äì EXTERNAL LOCKOUT. A second later, the main display flashed a new reading: GRAVIMETRIC ANOMALY DETECTED. SINK RATE: 1.1 CM PER MINUTE. It was dropping. Eating its way through the diamond-composite floor of the detector.

>With a pneumatic hiss that cut through the humming silence, the main doors to the control room slid open. A stocky man with a neat grey beard and the weary eyes of a predator stepped inside. Jean-Luc Dubois, CERN's Head of Security, didn't even glance at the frantic screens. His gaze locked onto Aris, his expression unreadable, his calm more terrifying than any alarm.

>""Dr. Thorne,"" he said, his voice a low gravel that carried absolute authority. Before she could respond, he touched the comms unit on his lapel. ""This is Dubois. Initiate Tier Four containment. Seal the ATLAS cavern. No one in, no one out. Effective immediately.""

>The heavy blast doors at the end of the corridor began to slide shut with a deafening, metallic groan. The final thud echoed in the room, a sound of profound finality. Aris was trapped. Not with a scientific marvel, but with the seed of a new extinction, sinking slowly toward the heart of the Earth.

**Model B**

>The control room smelled of metal polish and hot silicon. Fluorescent strips hummed like an insect chorus overhead; a hundred racks of LEDs through the glass threw a cold, matrixed light over faces. Ana stood with her shoulders set, leather jacket half-unzipped, a battered notebook clamped in one hand. She tapped two fingers together against her thigh, counting phase windows in her head the way others count prayers.

>""Good readout,"" she said without ceremony, the sentence sharper than the applause that clapped elsewhere in the room. Her voice was dry, flat as graphite. Across from her, Leila's mouth had become a machine of tiny movements ‚Äî eyes flicking from waveform to waveform, thumb half-chewed in a nervous ritual. Leila grinned, breathless; ""We nailed it. Look at the cross-section on channel seven‚Äîcoherent signal across ten nanoseconds.""

>Martin Haldane was in a suit even here, his tie loosened but lapel neat under the lab lights. He smiled the practiced smile of a man who had mediated a thousand eulogies for bad results and elevated many dull papers to policy. He smoothed the lapel when Ana's gaze found him. ""Congratulations, team. We'll prepare the release protocol after the calibration notes,"" he said, measured as a governor.

>Marco leaned against a console with the tired grace of someone who'd earned every scar. He smelled faintly of lubricant and coffee; a multimeter sat heavy in his pocket like a talisman. He said, blunt as a wrench, ""Keep cooling stable. If the cryos fluctuate, we pause. No spontaneous physics, please."" His knuckle scar twitched as he turned a wrench-tight metaphor into a literal instruction.

>The collision itself had been anticlimactic in sound: a soft, masked thump in the speaker banks and a cascade of green boxes blooming on monitors. For Ana, the moment was less noise than pattern ‚Äî a sudden, compact vector of charge-density propagating along an expected lattice, then folding inward with a geometry she'd sketched as a grad student and abandoned as impossible. Her fingers kept tapping. The schematic in her head resolved, then refused to obey the equations she would swear by.

>They celebrated with low, professional smiles and exhausted champagne in plastic cups. Leila laughed too loudly and then immediately watched the telemetry again, as if the triumph had to be monitored for temper. Elias hovered by the doorway with his recorder, the device glossy and accusing in his hand. ""Nice timing,"" he said, voice already filing the evening away into a lead for future use. ""You're letting me watch history, right?""

>Ana felt the soft, intoxicating confirmation of being right ‚Äî that particular chemical kick that followed theoretical vindication. It was dangerous, she recognized it: hubris tastes like victory and dries the tongue. She let herself savor it for a breath that was a mistake. Somewhere under her ribs a small, older fear tightened; she had always equated being right with being safe.

>The first anomaly read like an irritation: channel seven dipping for microseconds, a loss of counts in a three-millimeter region where there should have been steady scattering. Marco frowned at the cryo readouts. ""Temperature's oscillating. Not mechanical. Not a seal."" He said it softly, as if naming a domestic disturbance. Leila's eyes went paper-white as she overlaid the frames; her fingers flew across keys. ""There's absorption‚Äîlocalized. Not decay. It's like‚Äî"" She stopped, laughing that sharp, nervous laugh and then whispering, ""‚Äîsomething's eating counts.""

>Ana stared until the world of graphs became tactile: points vanishing as if someone rubbed dust from a screen. She translated, clean and clinical, to herself: lower-energy states, anomalous binding energy, a stable cluster with negative surface tension. The language of catastrophe arrived as notation and ink, and she cursed inside Hungarian, a small private bulwark. ""Show me the raw traces, Leila,"" she said. Her hands, so practiced at comforting circuitry, felt suddenly useless.

>Martin's smile thinned. The lull after success flattened into a decision-point with all the velocity of tectonic plates. He folded his hands and smoothed his lapel again; containment and communication sat like two knives on the table between him and the team. Elias clicked his recorder, waiting, hungry for the narrative. Marco reached for a checklist, fingers already going through motions. Ana thought: we can run one more controlled collision and see the propagation constants. Or we can shut the machine and call for external review. Her mouth tasted like metal. She tapped two fingers together, harder now, and the beat of control became the drum of a choice not yet named.

**Model C**

>The acrid smell of ozone and burnt electronics filled Tunnel Seven as Dr. Elena Vasquez descended the emergency stairwell, her wire-rimmed glasses fogging slightly in the humid air. The concrete walls hummed with residual electromagnetic energy, a low-frequency vibration that seemed to penetrate her bones. Three levels below Lake Geneva, the Large Hadron Collider stretched its seventeen-mile circuit through darkness, and something had gone wrong with the night's collision sequence.

>""Status report,"" she called into her radio, her voice echoing off the curved tunnel walls. The taste of metal lingered on her tongue‚Äîa familiar side effect of high-energy particle decay, but stronger tonight than she'd ever experienced.

>""Dr. Vasquez, thank God."" James Chen's voice crackled through the comm, tension bleeding through the static. ""We've got a massive resonance anomaly in Section Four. The magnetic containment is... well, it's doing things it shouldn't be able to do.""

>Elena adjusted her glasses, her calloused fingers finding the familiar ritual comforting as her mind raced through possibilities. ""Define 'things it shouldn't be able to do,' Dr. Chen. I need precision, not hyperbole.""

>The emergency lighting cast harsh shadows as she reached the control room, where James stood hunched over a bank of monitors, his usually neat black hair disheveled from running his hands through it. Red warning indicators painted his face in intermittent crimson. Behind him, the main display showed a three-dimensional model of the collision chamber, with energy readings that made Elena's stomach drop.

>""Look at this."" James's fingers flew across the keyboard, pulling up data streams that scrolled faster than human eyes could follow. ""At 23:47:33, we achieved standard collision parameters. Gold ions, seven TeV per beam, everything nominal. But then‚Äî"" He highlighted a specific timestamp. ""‚Äîwe got this resonance spike that lasted exactly 0.0003 seconds. The energy signature doesn't match any known particle decay.""

>Elena leaned closer, studying the waveform pattern. The numbers were wrong‚Äînot just unexpected, but fundamentally wrong in a way that violated several conservation laws. ""Show me the magnetic field data.""

>""That's the problem."" James's nervous laugh echoed in the sterile room. ""The field strength is increasing. Not decreasing like it should after beam dump‚Äîincreasing. And it's pulling in ambient particles from the tunnel atmosphere.""

>The implications hit Elena like a physical blow. She gripped the edge of the console, her knuckles white against the polymer surface. In the distance, she could hear the low thrum of the superconducting magnets, their frequency slightly off from the normal operational tone. ""¬øDios m√≠o,"" she whispered, then caught herself. ""How long has the anomaly been active?""

>""Forty-seven minutes and counting."" James pulled up another screen showing the facility's automated safety systems. ""But here's the weird part‚Äîthe computer keeps trying to initiate emergency shutdown, but every time it does, the anomaly just... adapts. Like it's learning from our containment protocols.""

1mps3dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1mps3dm/i_just_want_to_feel_rested/,I just want to feel rested,"I have been either rapid cycling or in a mixed episode for a month now, possibly more for all I know. 

I can hardly remember anything. It feels like I‚Äôve just been trying every hour of every day to keep my head above water. 

My family has been getting renovations done for over a month. Every day, strangers in our house at 8AM sharp - drilling, sawing, hammering etc. . . what a great coincidence this would take place when I‚Äôm at maybe my lowest and most vulnerable point in my life. (Not to mention my family members are hoarders and this house is an embarrassment) 

Right when I learn of my bipolar and am trying to piece together my shattered reality. 

I had to stay in my room to find any peace before, but at least it was my space. But now there is no peace. 

I woke up yesterday exhausted (barely getting sleep because of the noise + hypomania). Made some coffee and started listening to music to try my best to wake up and not feel like I was going crazy. 

There‚Äôs a knock at the door, I assume it‚Äôs one of my family members. I respond with a ‚Äúyeah?‚Äù And one of the workers just opens the door to my messy ass room and sees my sleep deprived ass sitting there on my computer (still 8:30 am mind you) 

Of course, no one decided it was important for me to know they would be doing drywall in the bedrooms. So I guess add that traumatic experience to the list of things to sort through later. 

I‚Äôm just so tired. Confused. Drained.

Every time I start to feel somewhat normal I swing back into an episode. Either that or it‚Äôs just one continuous one. I have no way of knowing anymore because it‚Äôs all just one blur. For all I know the noise, anxiety and shit sleep are just restarting the episode every time it ends. 

All I can say is I am not sure I have ever felt this level of exhaustion on so many levels. I‚Äôve gone from screaming on the inside and wanting to explode, to a quiet sob. 

Am I just screwed at this point? I feel like I‚Äôm not the same person I was a month ago. I feel like something in me is broken - or at the very least, changed - beyond repair. 

While discovering my bipolar should be a good thing, I can‚Äôt help but feel like all that‚Äôs done is take a way the last bit of ignorance I had of the world and my life that allowed me to enjoy them. 

Blah.

1mprxec,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/1mprxec/micro_aggressive_behavior_from_hotel_staff/,Micro aggressive behavior from hotel staff‚Ä¶," I had the most bizarre experience today at the hotel I am staying at. I‚Äôm currently on a work trip and staying at a Wyndham Microhotel during my stay. The hotel I‚Äôm at is owned by an immigrant Indian staff. I really didn‚Äôt care as I was just wanting a place to land.

But after being here for a few days I‚Äôve realized they must not be pleased to have me here. My room is on the first floor and the room closest to the receptionist desk and laundry room. 
I have waken up and seen the maid carts in the hallway each day but no one has knocked to clean my room. Which I really didn‚Äôt read into much until today.

I left out my room to walk to the grocery store next door and was in my bonnet (I know but I was walking to get coffee before I got ready to go to work) and as I walked into the Lobby there was a group of the employees congregated at the desk and they just stared at me weird and gave me really disgusted looks. 

I come back to the hotel, go to my room and put my coffee in the machine and realize I need a cup. No biggie I‚Äôll just go to the lobby and grab one of the cups from their coffee station. And decide while at it I‚Äôll ask for more bath towels since they haven‚Äôt provided room service to give me more. 

As soon as I walk back into the Lobby the group congregated in the lobby act like I‚Äôm not allowed to be walking freely in the hotel and start giving me dagger eyes. 
I ask the one behind the counter if I can get more towels and he tells me if I want more I need to go to my room and put my dirty ones in the laundry hamper in the employees laundry room?!?? Meanwhile everyone else gets room service ‚Ä¶ I have to take mine to the employee laundry room myself like I‚Äôm the help? And my room is close to the laundry quarters and front desk so I feel like ignoring me was deliberate at that point. 

I comply because I want new towels and bring my towels to the laundry room. 
And then he reluctantly hands me two more towels and ignored me when I said thank you.

The other employers still congregated in the lobby are looking at me like I don‚Äôt belong there and one questions which room I‚Äôm in so I tell him. 
Thinking the interaction was over I go about my way to grab some coffee cups and then the one who asked me which room I was in yelled at me ‚Äúwhere are you going ? The room you said is that way!‚Äù

Like I‚Äôm not allowed to be in the Lobby to get coffee cups ?!! 
So I replied ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grabbing cups‚Ä¶‚Äù and walked away‚Ä¶

I was sitting in my cozy chair, sipping on some mediocre coffee, and started thinking about us‚Äîhumanity, I mean. We're kinda at this point where we're riding on the edge of technology and tradition, and it makes me wonder... where are we actually heading?

It feels like three's this giant puzzzle we're all trying to pisce together, but I'm not sure we all agree on what the final pictrue looks like. Is it a world where tech controls us, or where we find a way to blend it with who we are in a good way? Might soud a bit dramatic, but it's something that's been buzzing in my mind lately.

Sometimes I worry about things like the environment and whdther we're doing enough to ensure there's a planet left for futre generations. Other tmes, I'm hopeful, seeing all these young foljs making waves and pushing for change. But then there‚Äôs a part of me that can‚Äôt help but feel a bit of fear creeping in, wondering if we‚Äôre all just spinning our wheells.

I'm curious if anyone else out there feels this mix of hope and fear for our collective future. Like, what‚Äôs coming next, and are we even ready for it? Is three something more we should do, or maybe sommething we should stop doing altogether?

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 20 year old woman I‚Äôve been on my weight loss journey for id say 5 and half months now. Sw (160) Cw (132? Could be less due to sodium and water weight lately) Gw (125-120 maybe 118) 

I got sick with covid about 2 or 1 week ago and it hit me pretty hard I couldn‚Äôt work out or eat much so it was pretty hard to track things or my weight just for some background anyways 

over the weekend I did maintenance calories (some I couldn‚Äôt count due to being at family‚Äôs house not cooking the food) 

Monday I went back to my deficit but had a very hard time with it. Mentally I just felt so burnt out from counting and being obsessed with my weight I don‚Äôt feel free at all nor like it‚Äôs healthy for my mental health rn so Tuesday I went to maintenance again as well as today (Wednesday) 

Me and my fianc√©‚Äôs anniversary is this weekend on Saturday so I won‚Äôt be able to count calories accurately. 

And we have a camping trip with family the 25th for that whole week. Where I won‚Äôt be able to count calories at all let alone accurately as I won‚Äôt have access as family will be cooking everything. 

There also maybe be a risk of pregnancy right now and I‚Äôm worried if I am in a deficit or restricting things as I have been it would effect that as I have been skipping breakfast only have a light snack and coffee then cleaning for hours and eating around dinner time just enough to reach maintenance. 

So I was thinking today since there would be now point in being in a deficit the rest of this week because I‚Äôd have to break it this weekend and then after a week having to break it again going to maintenance the rest of the week and weekend as well as the camping trip 

So I guess the advice and reassurance I‚Äôm looking for is that it‚Äôs a good idea..I know people say a month break like that is very good for your body but not being able to count anything accurately at all for a whole week is scaring me as I‚Äôm very afraid of gaining weight. 

It‚Äôs also been very hard to lose this last bit of weight I have and I‚Äôve heard a maintenance break that long could help with that i know slow and steady wins the race but I guess I‚Äôm just worried about a lot.. any advice or reassurance would be very helpful thank you.

We‚Äôve disagreed but primarily always been on the same page. We survived middle school and highschool. We went out separate ways for college and went to almost opposite sides of the country. The summer before we left, some issues came up of my friend just avoiding hanging out and always making up excuses which I just chalked up to fears about leaving like if she didn‚Äôt say bye then leaving didn‚Äôt feel  (she left earlier than me for sorority rush). However, we talked all the time on the phone and facetimed all the time. Even though we were apart, I still felt like our friendship was going strong. But then over winter break it was the same thing as our last summer were she was always busy and could never do anything keeping in mind she was not working at all during these times. I even tried doing something with less of a time commitment like trying to just meet up for coffee or ice cream. I didn‚Äôt see her once over winter break which was almost 2 months long. I understand on short breaks not having time but being too busy to get coffee once over winter break especially without being employed. It hurt and I would have believed she was distancing herself but once spring semester started we were talking on the phone almost daily. Now summer break ‚Äò25 it‚Äôs the same thing. She tells me she‚Äôs too busy and she‚Äôs sick and tired but i have her location and see she‚Äôs at another one of her friend‚Äôs house.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget your math homework,‚Äù Mrs. Pike called over the noise. ‚ÄúEspecially you, Brett.‚Äù

‚ÄúScout‚Äôs honor,‚Äù Brett replied, giving a lazy salute‚Äîthen turned to Kyle and crossed his fingers with a smirk.

The children flooded the halls full of lockers excitedly to leave the building for the weekend. Home work was the last thing on the kids mind.

Out in the crisp air, the smell of damp leaves and chimney smoke filled the streets. As brett and kyle left kids dispersed down different streets to their homes. Headed down the cracked sidewalk, the trees above them clattering in the wind.

‚ÄúSo, this vampire game,‚Äù Kyle said.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Brett grinned, eyes lighting up. ‚ÄúYou, open doors, collect garlic, shoot the creature with a crossbow‚Äîit‚Äôs awesome. Game Up magazine says if we get enough garlic, the boss turns into smoke before we even fight him.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think we can beat it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe *will* beat it. He said with determination. We only have it for the weekend, so tonight‚Äôs the night. I read there‚Äôs this hidden level‚Äîyou gotta go through a wall in the wine cellar, and then‚Äîboom‚Äîcrossbow upgrade. That‚Äôs how we win.‚Äù

Kyle nodded. Eager to do something his parents wouldnt know about, he could see it clearly in his minds eye.

‚ÄúThanks for coming over, man,‚Äù Brett added after a pause. ‚ÄúYou know how my mom‚Ä¶‚Äù He rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say she likes things her way.‚Äù

Before Kyle could answer, Jeremy the class clown cut across their path. Although at this week he seemed more unkempt than a class clown. Brett had to stop short.

Everyone at school knew Jeremy. He was off, same grade but different class. His flannel was misbuttoned, collar sticking up on one side, hair sticking out in clumps like he‚Äôd just rolled out of bed. The skin under his eyes was dark, his gaze darting and restless. Recently he seemed more negative than his usual ‚Äîlike he hadn‚Äôt slept in days and had no one to tell him to.

He didn‚Äôt slow down, just clipped Brett hard in the shoulder.

‚ÄúWatch it, losers,‚Äù Jeremy barked, lip curling ear to ear. Like hes hiding a secret. Jeremy trotted backward tung out, thumb on his nose wiggling his fingers.

‚ÄúGod, Jeremy,‚Äù Brett snapped rolling his eyes, spinning halfway around. ‚ÄúTry walking in a straight line for once!‚Äù he yelled back¬†

But Jeremy was already moving, going to annoy the next kids he encountered.

Kyle adjusted his backpack. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs his deal?‚Äù

Brett snorted. ‚ÄúThat *is* his deal.‚Äù

They kept walking, vampire game still in their heads‚Äîbut the echo of Jeremy‚Äôs glare lingered with them, sour and heavy, like the first hint of a storm.

That night, the living room smelled of melted cheese and tomato sauce. Brett‚Äôs NES was humming, the vampire game‚Äôs title screen flickering with pixelated bats.

‚ÄúYou boys and your games,‚Äù Brett‚Äôs mom said, setting down a pizza box on the coffee table. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to give yourselves nightmares. Don‚Äôt wake me up if you do.‚Äù

Kyle glanced at Brett. She wasn‚Äôt joking‚Äîshe meant it.

Brett gave a quick nod. ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt, Mom.‚Äù

She grabbed two plastic cups from the kitchen counter, poured bright orange soda into each, and handed them over.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good,‚Äù Kyle said, pushing his away.

Her smile froze. ‚ÄúWe dont waste things in this house, you will drink it.‚Äù The warmth in her voice was gone.

Brett didn‚Äôt move. Kyle looked from him to her, confused.

‚ÄúGo on,‚Äù she said, folding her arms. Eyebrow arched.

Hesitant, Kyle lifted the cup and drank, bubbles biting at his throat. She watched him swallow every drop, then let her smile return.

‚ÄúGood boy.‚Äù

She turned toward the hallway. ‚ÄúAnd remember‚Äîlights out at 9, and please keep it down, im asking nicely.‚Äù

The sound of her slippers faded upstairs.

Brett leaned toward Kyle, voice low. ‚ÄúTold you. Let‚Äôs go to the basement so we don‚Äôt wake her up.‚Äù Kyle nodes not knowing how to process why she made him drink something he didnt want.

They unhooked the game square, gaming system, cords trailing like vines, and carried it downstairs. The basement was half-finished‚Äîone side cement floor and exposed beams, the other with old carpet that didn‚Äôt quite reach the walls. A single bare bulb dangled overhead, making long shadows out of the support beams.

Kyle shivered. ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs it so cold down here?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always like that,‚Äù Brett said, brushing it off as he set the game square, gaming system on a low table. ‚ÄúGrab my backpack. I brought the *Game Up* magazine‚Äîwe‚Äôre gonna need it for the wine cellar trick.‚Äù

Kyle hauled the backpack over, the weight heavier than he expected. ‚ÄúMan, what do you keep in here, bricks?‚Äù

Brett frowned. ‚ÄúNothing but my stuff for school and the mag.‚Äù

Kyle reached inside and pulled out a heavy, wooden-bound book, the cover dark as burnt oak, the edges worn smooth by use.

Brett leaned over, eyebrows knitting. ‚ÄúWhat the‚Ä¶? That‚Äôs not mine.‚Äù

The latch was ornate, cold under Kyle‚Äôs fingers.

They exchanged a glance.

Brett flipped it open, and the wooden covers creaked as they spread. Inside wasn‚Äôt paper at all‚Äîit was carved wood, shaped into a tiny, three-walled house. Every detail was there: faded wallpaper curling at the corners, miniature chairs, a thread-sized rug. Even the floorboards had tiny scratches worn into them.

‚ÄúWhoa,‚Äù Brett whispered, grinning. ‚ÄúThis is *amazing*.‚Äù

Kyle stayed a step back, the cold air pressing heavier against his skin. Something about the little house made him uneasy. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd it come from?‚Äù

Brett shrugged, still smiling. ‚ÄúWho cares? Look at it.‚Äù

Kyle stood to grab the magazine from the bag, but his knee nudged the edge of the book.

A sharp *click* sounded, and a narrow panel on the side sprang open.

The overhead bulb flickered once‚Äîtwice‚Äîbefore settling back into its dim glow.

From the hidden compartment, several tiny figures stepped out onto the carpet.

The figures were miniature people. Moving but absent minded, like nothing happened. As the miniature people stood up they seemed unphased by the boys presence.

They turned toward the wooden house inside the book and began walking toward it in slow, steady steps, like people heading home after a long day. Their expressions were soft, their movements unhurried‚Äîcontented and unassuming.

Brett‚Äôs eyes followed them with pure fascination. ‚ÄúWhat are they?‚Äù

Kyle crouched, but kept his distance. They were small, harmless-looking‚Äîbut their perfect indifference made his skin prickle. They never paused, never wavered, just kept moving toward the open rooms, as if nothing else in the world existed.¬†

The one bulb flickers, the sound of 8 bit vampire killer plays in a loop dun dun duuuuun dun dun duuuuuun. the boys unflinching mesmerized, thinking.

Brett leaned closer, smiling faintly. Kyle glanced at the basement stairs, that quiet knot in his gut tightening.

Kyle was laughing quietly, leaning over the dollhouse, completely absorbed in moving the tiny people around. Brett was just as engrossed, setting one figure on the bed while nudging another toward the kitchen. For the first time all night, the cold basement didn‚Äôt feel unsettling‚Äîjust full of wonder.

They didn‚Äôt notice the clock.

‚ÄúAre you asleep, boys?‚Äù Brett‚Äôs mom called from the top of the stairs. Her voice was slightly annoyed but softened just enough to keep up appearances.

Brett jumped, then grinned nervously. ‚ÄúWhat? Uh‚Ä¶yeah. We were just‚Ä¶falling asleep.‚Äù

Kyle nodded, trying to look like he was already dozing.

She couldn‚Äôt see them in the basement, and they couldn‚Äôt see her. After a pause, she shut the door a little too loudly and went upstairs, her slippers echoing on the stairs.

Once the sound of her footsteps faded, Brett lifted the heavy wooden book again. They opened it carefully‚Äîand froze.

One of the tiny people was squished flat against the floor of the dollhouse, motionless.

Kyle‚Äôs eyes went wide. ‚ÄúOh no‚Ä¶we‚Ä¶we killed it!‚Äù

Brett swallowed, his hands trembling slightly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre‚Ä¶we‚Äôre murderers. We‚Äôre going to go to prison!‚Äù

Panic flared, hearts racing.

Footsteps creaked on the stairs. Their mom was back, checking.

‚ÄúUh‚Äîthere was a‚Ä¶spider,‚Äù Brett blurted, shoving a hand over the book.

Kyle nodded frantically. ‚ÄúYeah! Big one!‚Äù

Her voice softened. ‚ÄúIf you need to stay up here a little longer, that‚Äôs okay too‚Ä¶‚Äù Her tone trailed off as she retreated upstairs.

Brett exhaled and lowered the book slowly. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶we‚Äôre good,‚Äù he whispered.

Kyle nodded, still shaking. The tiny house sat between them, innocent and silent.

Once the footsteps upstairs faded completely, Brett and Kyle leaned over the wooden book again, hearts still hammering.

They opened it carefully‚Äîand froze.

One of the tiny people lay limp on the floor of the dollhouse. The other two had gathered around it, heads bowed, their tiny hands pressed together as if in mourning. Kyle‚Äôs stomach sank.

‚ÄúThey‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre crying,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúOr‚Ä¶whatever tiny people do when someone dies.‚Äù

Brett swallowed hard. ‚ÄúWhat do we do with it?‚Äù

Neither boy could answer. After a moment, Brett reached out and gingerly picked up the limp figure. In muffled voices they freaked out, glaring at the dangling body.¬†

Then‚Äîa sharp tap at the basement window.

A whisper, barely audible over the quiet hum of the basement bulb, floated in through the glass:

‚ÄúWhat are you going to do with it?‚Äù

The boys froze, eyes wide, breaths held. Every instinct screamed at them to bolt upstairs‚Äîbut something about the soft, almost gentle tone rooted them to the spot. The fear of waking their mom came to mind. But someone was outside watching them. Watching the doll house.

The voice whispered again, closer this time:

‚ÄúLet me in‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll help you. He doesnt look well‚Äù

Brett and Kyle reeled back toward the stairs‚Äô light, the only brightness in the dark, cold basement. With trembling hands, Brett gently shut the book, hiding the tiny figures inside.

The voice tapped again, lightly. First on the same window. Then the far one.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

Tap Tap.

‚ÄúI can help.That must have been scary‚Äù

over the next few hours, soft and deliberate. Every tap made the boys flinch. Neither could sleep. They huddled together near the stairs. The whispering reassurances repetitive. Softly tapping.

¬†The voice came again, soft, coaxing, almost pleading:

‚ÄúThey need me to help‚Ä¶ let me in.‚Äù

It sounded like a favor being asked rather than a threat‚Äîand yet, the way it lingered in the air, sent shivers down their spines.

Brett clutched the book tighter, Kyle‚Äôs hands pressed against his knees holding the limp doll body. Neither boy moved, waiting, listening, afraid that even the slightest sound might summon the disembodied voice closer.

Already put 1k down for a 2026 allocation expecting delivery april/may. 26 yrs old 100k km driving experience in a 2014 mazda 3. Already saved extra 2300 for down payment aiming for atleast 15k. Can I afford this car? Do I have enough driving experience to not just crash and destroy it? (No at fault accidents and no speeding tickets thus far)


26 yr old early career software engineer. Despite the struggles my industry is facing, ive landed myself a very secure industrial software engineering position that provides solid job security. I take home 4k/month after tax with plenty of overtime opportunities and travel/food compensation that reduces my cost of living quite drastically. My condo/utilities/strata costs me 1600/month and if I don't do any travel for work I spend about 400/month on food and then between car insurance, home insurance, student loan payments, payment plans and other miscellaneous expenses i spend about 500/month (all rounded up) leaving me 1500/month leftover. I also have the option to rent out my second bedroom for an additional 1250/month. For about 3-4 months/yr I travel for work which reduces my food costs (100 per diem) and nets me an extra 500->1k/month on average for overtime and travel compensation (70 cents / km traveled typically 500km-900km)

Ive already paid a 1k deposit to have first right of refusal on 26 supras from my local Toyota dealership and ive set aside another 2300 so far for the down payment. Im aiming for at least 15k down. I have just over 100k km driving experience in a 2014 mazda 3 ive owned since 2016 (fully paid off) with no at fault accidents or speeding tickets. I also frequently drive my dad's Lincoln Navigator L and the extra horses make my mazda feel incredibly sluggish.

I really really love to drive and ive always wanted a nice sporty car I can take to local cars and coffee and on track days (track very close to me). Since submitting the 1k deposit and entertaining the idea of owning a supra, ive become noticeably more motivated in almost all aspects of my life and I feel generally super excited about the future and life in general. Despite all the dreaming and excitement, id like to come back to reality for a moment to ask: Can I afford this car? Do I have enough driving experience to reasonably get behind the wheel of this car?

I live in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia so there will be snow on the ground most likely from early November -> early March so id like to keep the FWD mazda 3 for the winter. Does it even make sense to own a car like this here?

1mpriqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1mpriqg/perspective_on_visitors_from_a_secondtime_mom/,Perspective on Visitors from a Second-Time Mom,"I didn‚Äôt think through the visitor element beforehand. I didn‚Äôt have a strong opinion and we definitely didn‚Äôt have a plan since our baby came early. But I am so glad that we had people around to help us in some really tough moments. I strongly recommend having SOMEONE be close by when the time comes. Even if you know you don‚Äôt want visitors in your room or meeting the baby, I still recommend having someone close by or willing to be on-call to support you/your partner during the process. Something as simple as making sure they can meet the Door Dash driver at the hospital entrance so your spouse doesn‚Äôt have to trek across the hospital to grab food for y‚Äôall. Someone who can bring you a protein smoothie if you deliver at 3:00 am and the hospital kitchen and all surrounding restaurants are closed. Someone who can bring you any items you forgot to the hospital. Or who might be able to hold your baby in the NICU while you recover from an intense labor. 

I personally went 24 hours without food. I delivered at 1:00 am and had no hope of eating since everything was closed. My parents were able to go to our house and whip me up a delicious snack with food we had on-hand and bring it to the hospital so I didn‚Äôt have to wait 5 more hours to eat. It was glorious.  

There are all kinds of reasons that additional support can be helpful. That doesn‚Äôt mean that every person who wants to be there should be. But I would at least identify someone who can show up when you need them and fill in the gaps so your partner is fully able to support you. Even just bringing you a cup of coffee the next morning so no one has to leave you in the hospital is a gift. In general, I think visitors get a bad rep, but I was so grateful for every person who met a need that we had no idea we would have. It made our experience what it was.

But now looking deep into Google and Reddit I finally think I found out what I have and it actually relieved me a little. Trust me I spent so long trying to find an answer.. I've never heard about PVCs until today. I've been dealing with this for years since I was 11 actually and I was a premature baby if that counts. I was one month premature. 

Lifting, hunching over/bending over, lying down sometimes on my side, sometimes even sitting down or walking, excercise, when I'm hot, caffeine, stress, when I'm crying, eating large meals (especially if it's more on the unhealthy side) and having to excessively burp is when I have it. (Edit: not all the time I'm doing these things but it's more likely to happen.)

I also have shortness of breath now that I assumed was my asthma but I guess not after reading all about this. My shortness of breath came gradually starting in March/April and it got worse. Even as I'm typing this I'm short of breath. My heart will beat ""thick"" or hard for one beat then go back to beating normal or it'll beat weakly and then beat normal again. It happens maybe 4-5 times a day at the worst and 0-2 at the least a day. 

I rarely drink, (I used to more in 2021-2023) my diet is healthy for the most part but I'd say it's 70/30. Maybe even 60/40. I exercise a lot because my job requires walking all 8 hours. (Obviously except break.) so that's a little run down. I did go to the hospital maybe about 5 times because I had a PVC scare that I thought something was going to happen to me and each time they sent me home saying I'm fine and 100% healthy. I've gotten EKG's and I never feel like it's accurate because I know they're just a few seconds. Like what if I have an PVC scare before or after the test? They won't see that and then just say I'm fine. 

I do have other health issues like asthma, anemia, anxiety, and I'm underweight for my age. 

I just have a few questions: 

1. Is it something to worry about? - I do have an appointment with the cardiologist the 22nd. 

2. Is it actually as common as it is? I've never met anyone who had this before and trust me I've asked a lot of people in my life from age 11 til now lol, either coworkers or classmates, and probably only 4 people said they had something similar. I know there's communities like this but it's just hard to believe I've never met anyone irl who felt this way. My sister feels this way too, she gets the same feeling and everything but the rest of my family doesn't.

3. Is it life threatening?

I want to feel healthy and I feel like this is something that really gets in the way. Knowing that I can't even workout properly but I see people do full hour workouts and lifting and running and all that or I saw a post of a someone saying they have 3 coffees a day to get by and I know if I had 3 caffeine filled coffees I'd be having a scare all day and I envy them honestly because I fear I can't do that because of this I feel so restricted. The other day at work I bent down to grab something at the bottom shelf and had it bad. It scares me so much but I try to remain calm in the moment. Everytime it happens I get so scared that I'm dying. The best way to describe my feeling is I get an adrenaline rush and then I pause like Raven having a vision then I try to breathe and remain calm in those 1-2 seconds it happens.

Sure, Big Ben and the London Eye are great, but the real charm? It‚Äôs tucked away in quiet gardens, cobbled lanes, and places you might miss if you blink too fast.

One crisp morning, I found myself climbing the steps to¬†**The Hill Garden and Pergola in Hampstead**. It felt like stepping into a forgotten fairytale ‚Äî stone walkways wrapped in wisteria, overlooking manicured lawns. Hard to believe this peaceful spot existed just minutes away from the chatter of Hampstead Heath. Wander a bit more, and Fenton House reveals itself, hiding behind brick walls with orchards so pretty they could be from an old English painting. From its rooftop terrace, the rooftops of Hampstead seem to stretch forever.

Another day, I detoured into¬†**Leadenhall Market in the City**¬†‚Äî a glittering Victorian arcade with iron arches and cobblestones. The quiet hum of early morning made it feel like my own private movie set (though Harry Potter fans might recognize it as Diagon Alley). For skyline lovers, here‚Äôs a tip: skip the tourist queues at Sky Garden and take the lift to The Garden at 120. It‚Äôs free, uncrowded, and the view? Absolutely breathtaking.

Then came my favorite surprise ‚Äî a rainforest in the middle of brutalist architecture. Seriously. The Barbican Conservatory smells of wet leaves and fresh air, its tropical plants stretching to the high glass roof. In west London,¬†**Kyoto Garden in Holland Park**¬†offers stone paths, koi ponds, and a waterfall so soothing you forget you‚Äôre in the middle of a bustling city. And for something older, the Chelsea Physic Garden whispers secrets of medicinal plants cultivated since the 1600s.

One weekend, I ventured to¬†**Walthamstow‚Äôs God‚Äôs Own Junkyard**, where neon signs buzz and glow in every corner. It‚Äôs like stepping into a living pop-art dream. On a different mood, I found calm at the WWT London Wetland Centre, where herons skated low over rippling water and the city felt miles away. For pure serenity, I stumbled into¬†**St John‚Äôs Lodge Garden in Regent‚Äôs Park**¬†‚Äî a hidden formal garden perfect for reading under sculpted greenery.

And then there‚Äôs the mystery of the Thames. When the tide is low, you can go mudlarking ‚Äî searching the riverbed for treasures from centuries past. Every little find ‚Äî a clay pipe, a shard of pottery ‚Äî feels like touching history.

The charm doesn‚Äôt stop there. London‚Äôs mews streets ‚Äî like¬†**Kynance Mews**¬†and St Luke‚Äôs Mews ‚Äî look straight out of a romance novel, with cobbles, ivy walls, and pastel-painted doors.

1mpr9de,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Fi_Fie_Fo_Fum/comments/1mpr9de/my_shopping_meal_planning_and_cooking_method/,"My Shopping, Meal Planning and Cooking Method","This is what works for us - maybe it works for others, maybe they have other things that work better for them!  To each their own, but I hope if anyone‚Äôs looking for ideas, they find something useful here. 

This is my system for meal planning, shopping and cooking:

I plan a day to do all the shopping - I do this based on when sales are in my shops.  The day before, I review the food already in my home.  I sit down with my household and decide what we would like to eat this week based on what's in our home and what is on sale (or I make a plan and just run it by them for veto). I recommend keeping recipes simple and things you know your household likes to start.

I often make four dinners, two things that should be eaten fresh and two that will create leftovers for the next night.  That gets me dinners for six nights. The remaining night is flex night (extra leftovers, very occasional carry out/dinner out, misery meal, whatever). Good leftover recipes are things like meatloaf, lasagna, stews, casseroles, etc. Good one night meals are things like fish, simple pastas, a smaller roast, stir frys, sheet pan dinners, all that.  I try to choose recipes that use similar ingredients if they are only using a part of something huge/expensive.

Next, lunches- I usually do one pot of soup, one salad, and one sandwich. Mixed and matched through the week.  I also prep heavier carb-protient-veg lunches for the people in our household who work outside of the home (heavy physical labour).

Next, breakfasts/staples/snacks: what do we use every week and need to top up? Eggs, milk, tea, coffee, butter, etc.

I write each meal down on a calendar (or on a spreadsheet).  I organise by what meals have ingredients that go off quickly and which ones last longer - fish, lettuces, etc tend to need to be used sooner.  Starchy veg, potatoes, meats can last longer into the week.  I hang the calendar on the fridge/pantry door so I can always see it.

Then I make my grocery list - I make sure to include quantities needed.

I shop in my pantry and cross off the things I don‚Äôt need to buy.  I look at coupons/sales and write down where I will purchase specific ingredients.

Shopping day, I have a nice meal before I go out. I do the shopping and go home. Anything I buy in bulk, I process right away - separate chicken breasts, wash and portion fruit‚Ä¶ so on.   I've found if I leave these tasks for later, we tend to have more food waste.

Cook according to the calendar. Be very deliberate about it to start.

Rinse and repeat.

I keep a list of meals that worked for us, ones we love, ‚Äúmisery meals‚Äù which I can make quickly, cheaply and with stuff I always have on hand and keep those somewhere handy.  I keep some of my old meal plans too so that I can page through them and grab one on a busy week and be all set to start the shopping process with a little less hassle.",1,1755147738.0,u_Fi_Fie_Fo_Fum,0,1.0,False

Has anyone out there cracked the code or gotten burned? I keep running into posts about amazing discounts, but why does it feel like I‚Äôm about to fall into a trap set by a digital grifter? Anybody else as confused as I am?

Let me break down my wild thought spiral:

- **Some people swear by it.**
  They show their emails, happy with their new Uber Eats or Amazon codes, sorta flexing on us slowpokes who haven‚Äôt made a move yet.
- **Others? Horror stories.**
  Cue the terrifying tales of drained balances and customer service disappearing like Houdini at a magic show.
- There‚Äôs the classic: ""Great savings, but beware."" WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?
- ‚ÄúGift Card Com hooked me up with a $50 Starbucks card for $35!‚Äù
- ‚ÄúMy gift card was empty upon arrival, now I‚Äôm ghosted.‚Äù

Each new post I find on Google or https://goodnovel.org/ usually just adds to the drama rather than clearing the fog.

I just want to know:

- Is it worth it?
- How risky do you feel with digital gift cards in general?
- Has anyone in the r/LuxuryGiftsf fam had direct experience? Like, did it work? Did it not? DETAILED SPILL PLEASE.

And then, am I only seeing the extreme ends of the spectrum? Where are the mellow ‚Äúbought one, worked, NBD‚Äù stories hiding?! Seriously, I‚Äôm scouring Reddit, TikTok, even random discussion forums and it just gets weirder every time.

Here‚Äôs something else messing with my logic:

- If it‚Äôs a scam, why do SO many apparently regular people recommend it?
- And if it‚Äôs fine, why so many ""never again"" posts?
- Is it like https://goodnovel.org/ where some people LOVE it and dive in for the deals, and some are just filled with dread because things can go off the rails at any time?

I get tempted every time my favorite coffee shop gift card drops below market price. Feels illegal, but it‚Äôs just advanced couponing, right? RIGHT?!? Or is it too good to be true and I‚Äôll end up gifting my cousin a big ol‚Äô $0 balance?

Can we maybe make a master thread or something? Let‚Äôs get organized. There must be a conclusive answer somewhere out there in the wilds of the Internet or, dare I say, on https://goodnovel.org/ (because let‚Äôs be real, reading gift card horror stories is my new hobby).

To help them navigate, management issued a pamphlet titled *Common Workplace Phrases: A Guide for the Utterly Unprepared*.

**‚ÄúLet‚Äôs circle back.‚Äù**  
Means: ‚ÄúI do not understand this now and I am hoping I will understand it later, preferably when you are no longer employed here.‚Äù

**‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a learning opportunity.‚Äù**  
Means: ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt afford to fix this, so let‚Äôs pretend the pain is educational.‚Äù

**‚ÄúCan you take ownership of that?‚Äù**  
Means: ‚ÄúThis problem now belongs to you, spiritually and legally, until the sun burns out.‚Äù

**‚ÄúWe‚Äôre like a family here.‚Äù**  
Means: ‚ÄúThere will be arguments, passive-aggression, and someone will cry in the break room, but we will still expect you to work weekends.‚Äù

**‚ÄúLet‚Äôs put a pin in it.‚Äù**  
Means: ‚ÄúWe will never speak of this again unless a lawsuit is involved.‚Äù

**‚ÄúGood hustle!‚Äù**  
Means: ‚ÄúYou accomplished the task in a way that was technically correct but makes everyone deeply uncomfortable.‚Äù

For the uninitiated, the trick to surviving the modern workplace was to treat it as an alien culture ‚Äî because it was. Meetings were the rituals, emails were the sacred texts, and coffee was the only recognized form of currency.

The older employees, veterans of countless ‚Äúparadigm shifts,‚Äù watched the newcomers with a mix of pity and awe. They knew that soon enough, the fresh-faced recruits would learn the truth: no one actually knows what they‚Äôre doing ‚Äî some people are just better at pretending.

And so, the new generation settled in, adopting the ancient phrases, inventing some of their own, and preparing to someday look just as exhausted and mysterious as everyone else.

I gave her five months before I blocked her, but that was two years ago. She had to have gotten a new number because she just reached out asking if we could go get coffee.

**Parsing the Odds: The Math Doesn‚Äôt Lie (Mostly)**  
Let‚Äôs start with the numbers, because even in tennis, where players sip water between points like it‚Äôs a job requirement, statistics reign supreme. The consensus here is clear: **Ben Shelton is the favorite**, with decimal odds hovering around **1.65 to 1.76** (-600 to -560 in American terms). That translates to an implied probability of **57-61%**, which is basically the sportsbook‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúShelton‚Äôs got this, unless he trips over his own shoelaces‚Ä¶ again.‚Äù

Jiri Lehecka, meanwhile, is priced between **2.08 and 2.20** (+108 to +120 in American odds), implying a **45-48% chance** to win. For context, that‚Äôs about the same odds as correctly guessing whether your morning coffee is decaf *before* your first sip. Not impossible, but not exactly a sure thing.

The spread (-1.5 for Shelton, +1.5 for Lehecka) and the total games line (24.5 over/under) are both offered at **1.87**, which is sportsbook parlance for ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not taking sides, we‚Äôre just here to take your money.‚Äù

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Surface, and National Pride**  
Now, let‚Äôs spice things up with context. Ben Shelton, the 22-year-old American with a serve that could power a city block, has been in stellar form this season. His explosive game thrives on hard courts like Cincinnati‚Äôs, where his first-serve percentage (over 70%) and aggressive net charges make him a one-man wrecking crew. No major injuries here‚Äîjust the usual drama of a young star trying not to tweet controversially during matches.

Jiri Lehecka, the 23-year-old Czech, is a grittier, baseline grinder. He‚Äôs a clay-court specialist with a game like a slow-burn novel: less fireworks, more *will-he-ever-win-this-point?* He‚Äôs had some success on slower surfa

My search history looked like *air fryer best*, *air fryer under 5k*, *air fryer reviews*, and *is eating fries every day healthy?* (spoiler: still no üòÖ).

After flirting with at least 5 different models .... including the INALSA NutriFry that I *almost* bought...my mum put her foot down:

*‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going with Philips. Period.‚Äù*

And honestly? I‚Äôm not even mad about it. Because the **Philips HD9200/90** turned out to be exactly what we needed... big enough for family snacks, simple to use, and backed by a brand that‚Äôs basically the Amitabh Bachchan of kitchen appliances.

**Side note:** I‚Äôm reviewing *all* the air fryers I shortlisted (including the ones I didn‚Äôt buy) so you know what you‚Äôre getting into.

[Check today‚Äôs Philips deal here](https://www.amazon.in/PHILIPS-Fryer-HD9200-90-Technology/dp/B09CTWFV5W/tag=rahulbhatia-21)

# Why the Philips HD9200/90 Works for Everyday Homes

The first thing you notice? **It‚Äôs not trying too hard**. No overcomplicated features, no ‚Äú20-in-1‚Äù claims you‚Äôll never use. Just **Philips‚Äô RapidAir Technology**, a 4.1L basket, and a design that fits neatly in most kitchens.

**Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs worth the hype:**

* **4.1L capacity** ‚Äî perfect for families of 3‚Äì5 without needing multiple batches.
* **RapidAir Technology** ‚Äî Philips‚Äô patented system for evenly crisp food with up to 90% less oil.
* **Temperature & timer control** ‚Äî so you can tweak for different recipes.
* **Sturdy build** ‚Äî feels premium, not plasticky.
* **Extra 1-year warranty** ‚Äî so you‚Äôre covered for a total of 2 years.

# Pros (AKA Why You‚Äôll Probably Love It)

‚úî Big enough for family dinners but still counter-friendly.  
‚úî Cooks evenly ‚Äî no random soggy fries hiding in the corner.  
‚úî Energy efficient compared to preheating an oven.  
‚úî Trusted brand with a great service network in India.  
‚úî Easy-to-clean removable basket.

# Cons (Because I‚Äôm Not Here to Sugarcoat)

‚úñ No fancy digital display ... it‚Äôs a manual knob control model.  
‚úñ Price is a bit higher than budget brands.  
‚úñ Doesn‚Äôt come with extra accessories (you can buy them separately).

# My Verdict ... Should You Buy It?

If you want a reliable, no-nonsense air fryer that‚Äôs going to last years, the **Philips HD9200/90** is it. Yes, it costs more than budget options, but you‚Äôre paying for consistent performance and service you can trust.

I‚Äôve used it for fries, chicken wings, paneer tikka, even reheating pizza ... and the food comes out evenly cooked every time.  
Honestly, this is one of those ‚Äúbuy once, cry once‚Äù appliances ... spend a little more now, and you won‚Äôt have to replace it anytime soon.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of a live edge side table hinges on several core features that influence its durability,aesthetic appeal,and overall functionality. Understanding these features allows you to make an informed decision that aligns with your personal preferences and requirements.

**Wood Type:** The type of wood used considerably impacts the table's appearance, durability, and price. Options range from hardwoods like walnut, maple, and oak to softwoods like pine and cedar.Hardwoods offer superior strength and resistance to scratches and dents, making them ideal for high-traffic areas. Softwoods, while more affordable, require more careful handling and may exhibit a more rustic aesthetic due to their natural grain patterns.

The choice of wood should complement your existing decor and withstand daily wear and tear.Each wood type has unique grain patterns and natural color variations that add character to the table, therefore understanding the specific characteristics of each species is essential. Additionally, sustainably sourced wood ensures that your purchase supports responsible forestry practices.

**Edge Profile:** The live edge profile is the defining characteristic of these tables, referring to the natural, unaltered edge of the wood slab. Variations exist in the amount of bark retained, the smoothness of the edge, and the overall shape. Some tables feature a highly refined, almost polished edge, while others showcase a more rugged, natural look with intact bark.

The ideal edge profile depends on your personal aesthetic preferences. A more refined edge can blend seamlessly with modern interiors, while a more rustic edge adds character to farmhouse or industrial-style settings. Careful consideration should be given to the edge's texture and any potential safety concerns,especially in households with children or pets.

**Base Design:** The base of a live edge side table plays a crucial role in its stability, visual appeal, and overall style. Common base materials include metal, wood, and occasionally acrylic. Metal bases, such as hairpin legs or geometric designs, offer a modern and minimalist look, while wooden bases can complement the rustic aesthetic.

The base should be sturdy enough to support the weight of the wood slab and any items placed on the table. Consider the height of the base and its impact on ergonomics, ensuring that the table is easily accessible from your seating area. The design of the base should also complement the wood slab's unique characteristics, enhancing the table's overall aesthetic appeal.

**Finish:** The finish applied to the wood surface not only enhances its appearance but also protects it from moisture, scratches, and stains. Common finishes include oil-based, water-based, and polyurethane options. Oil-based finishes penetrate the wood, enhancing its natural grain and color, while water-based finishes offer a more durable and environmentally pleasant option.

Polyurethane finishes provide a tough, protective layer that resists scratches and stains but can sometiems give the wood a more artificial appearance. The choice of finish should depend on your desired aesthetic and the level of protection required. A matte or satin finish can maintain the wood's natural look, while a gloss finish adds a touch of elegance.

**Dimensions:** The dimensions of the live edge side table are crucial in ensuring it fits seamlessly into your space and serves its intended purpose effectively. Consider the table's height, width, and depth in relation to your seating area and other furniture pieces. A table that is too large can overwhelm a small space, while one that is too small may not be functional.

Measure the available space carefully before making your purchase,and consider the table's intended use when determining the ideal dimensions. A table used for holding drinks and snacks should be easily accessible from your seating area, while one used for displaying decorative items may require more surface area. Also, consider the thickness of the wood slab, as this contributes to the overall visual weight of the table.

I am a serious procrastinator, and suck at organizing stuff. I described myself as all over the place and messy, lol. But here are some tips that help me get started and focus on work. 

First, It's important to just have a list of things you have to complete, and the items can be as small as possible. That's important!!! If you look at my daily schedule, it's messy, but at least I know what I need to do, although I am so far from having a fancy, perfect schedule, you could read some other guide if you want to work on that.

Here some other tips....

1. 1 minute rule GoalÔºöAvoid distraction and task initiation 
      * You may have heard of 5 second rule. If you want to pick up your phone, you count for 5 seconds, then say Go! But for me 5 seconds is kind of too short, so I instead wait for a minute. And usually after a minute, since I am easily distracted, I could distract from my phone, and start doing the task.
      * After the 1 minute rule, you could use the 15 mins rule. Always have a clock in front of you, so that you could visualize the time. Tell yourself, In this 15 minute, you just have to finish that one tiny task. Setting a time limit could push you a little bit and have a sense of urgency.  The mental time limit could be 10 -15 minutes. Too short, you will think there is not enough time to complete so you think you can't complete anyway. Too long, you will think you have too much time and you will procrastinate. So, find a time that works for you.
      * Also, if you are feeling overwhelmed or stressed, you can take 1 breath, like meditation kind of breath, you can do more if you want. This is to calm yourself down, let the emotions sink in and dont let that control you. Try to disconnect from your thought and feelings, focus on the tiny task in front of you. 
2. 10 seconds rule GoalÔºöComplete a very small task 
      * If sth takes less than 1\~10 seconds to complete, (like fax a thing, make a minor phone call, sign whatever paper), do it right now. After you finish that very small task, you have a sense of accomplishment. And also, you could complete that minor, maybe also kind of important task that you could have ignored or forget!! Then, you cross that item (the one you keep forgetting) off your to do list , and feel less overwhelmed at the end of the day.
3. Pomodoro method GoalÔºöGet through a few work/study sessions (sustain work) 
      * This one I am still trying out. Because usually after I have focused for about an hour, I rest, then I won't be able to focus again. So, this could make me work longer? That's the toughest one to follow.
4. Minimize distraction Delete social media apps. 
      * I deleted Instagram, and then I realized how much time I have spent on it, and how much more time I could have for work/for fun, most importantly for sleep. Figure out what activity you spend the most time in, could be gaming (i uninstalled a game I usually play all the time), could be scrolling apps, could be Utube (I mostly only watch UTube on my phone, because I couldn't stop watching on the computer, with endless suggested videos)
5. Feel good
      * Dont beat yourself up after you procrastinate! We change by feeling good!
      * Work is not your entire life, stop overestimating your importance at work, you need to develop interest and take breaks. Allow time for your brain to relax.
6. Sleep and caffeine
      * Have enough sleep, to keep your mind sharp and its good four your brain and body.
      * Have some tea or coffee. Try different types until you figure out which one keeps you awake. For me, a cup of green tea makes me wide awake and not wanting to sleep.

Please try some of the tips to see if they work for you. We need hacks to trick ourselves to stop procrastinating and get started. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Solution! Lego base + coffee stirrer + green construction paper + laminator!

Use hobby knife to cut little slit in each layer of the tree and slide it on.   Easy peasy!   (10-15min!)
