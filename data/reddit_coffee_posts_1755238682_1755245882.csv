Aside from Korean society being extremely obsessed with image, as a hopeful foreign language (English) teacher, wouldn’t my teeth be a barrier to getting a job that requires attention to my mouth?

My parents have kindly offered to fund braces or invisilign, but they said it has to be ASAP as they are aging. 

Would having braces/invisilign be a problem? What about getting them once I’m in Korea? 

I saw a story not long ago of a girl saying she was fired from a school because the parents and kids didn’t like her having braces. How common is that?

Really stressing about what to do here. ",1,1755245462.0,teachinginkorea,2,1.0,False
1mqrfp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/camphalfblood/comments/1mqrfp1/fanfic_timeee_3_pjo_hoo/,Fanfic timeee <3 [pjo] [hoo],"I made a fanfic on a demigod named Elena Brooks. She was found right after hoo. Hope yall like it! <3

1. My school gets overrun by monsters

Look, if you’re reading this because you think you might be a demigod—stop. Close the book, delete the file, whatever. Being half-god isn’t some magical golden ticket. It’s more like a curse wrapped in a headache, sprinkled with monster attacks. Trust me, I’d trade for a normal life in a heartbeat. But since you’re still here, I guess I should start at the beginning—the day my brain decided to broadcast the future in the middle of math class.

I was halfway through my worksheet, when the migraine started. My vision went fuzzy, my mind was blowing up, and I could only see the horrible future: Me fighting for my life in gym class against a huge monster thing, and Evan (my bsf) being the only thing in between me and that nightmare. But, Evan's bottom half was goat. The vision faded away, but I could hear Evan and the others yelling my name. I felt like the world was spinning around me. Then I plopped right onto Evan's arms and closed my eyes.

I was half-awake at the nurse's office when I heard my history teacher, Mr. Whitman, talking to Evan. ""-but you have to get her to camp! If these migraines reoccur, it could cause problems,"" Evan said. ""Shhh, she's awake. Hi Elena, how're you feeling?"", Mr. Whitman asked. ""What-what were you just talking about?"",  I asked. ""Ahh, you seemed to have listened to our conversation. Don't worry, you'll understand soon. Until then, sweet dreams,"" he said. And I closed my eyes.

I woke up again, this time with only Evan. He was fiddling with his fingers and biting a pencil. Yeah, he has a habit of eating wood, or at least chewing on it. ""Evan, stop eating that!"", I said, snatching the pencil away from him. ""Elena! You're awake! Gosh, I was worried."" ""I'm ok, jeez,"" I said. ""Which class is it now?"" ""It's gym now, if the timing's right-wait! It's about to be gym,"" he said. ""Did you have visions again?"" ""What do you think, Evan? Obviously,"" I said. I described what I saw. That's when I looked at his face. He was sweating, like beads of sweat were rolling down his cheeks. And he was nervous. Really nervous. ""Why do you look so nervous?"", I asked. ""No, nothing. It's just that-"" That's when my math teacher barged in. She looked at me suspiciously and said,""Mrs Brooks, you don't look very sick to me. Mr Moss, take your 'friend' to the gymnasium."" ""Yes, ma'am,"" he said. ""Come on, Elena.""

We walked down the noisy hallway, to the gym. On the way, I told him about that dream-like thing I saw, with him and Mr. Whitman. He started fiddling with his fingers again, the way he does when he's nervous. ""Evan, was that real, or just another stupid vision?"" ""You'll understand soon, Elena,"" he said. I wanted to ask him what he meant, but he made it clear he wasn't in the mood to talk. We walked in silence, our shoes tapping lightly against the linoleum. When we reached the gym, Ckach Miller was barking orders as usual. ""Hey, Brooks! Ten jumping jacks!” he yelled. “You too, Shortie-with-the-blonde-hair!” “Yes, sir,” Evan and I said together. I knocked out my ten easy. Evan… not so much. By five, he was red in te face and puffing like an old man jogging uphill. “You good?” I asked. “No, thanks,” he huffed, which made zero sense but okay. That’s when Coach Miller walked over, face weirdly serious. “Alright, kid,” he growled, eyes locked on me. “I’ll make this simple. Join us, and I’ll leave you and this pathetic satyr alone.” “…What?” My brain was buffering. “What do you mean ‘satyr’? Evan, what is he talking about?” Evan’s eyes went huge. “Oh no. This is happening now? Last resort—RUN!” And suddenly, he was gone—sprinting faster than I’d ever seen in PE. I stumbled after him, my brain still catching up. Then I looked down. His legs. From the knees down, they weren’t legs at all. Brown fur, cloven hooves. Just like my vision. “Evan, what the—” I didn’t even finish because Coach Miller was… changing. His body stretched, his face elongated, fur sprouted everywhere, and a massive spiked tail whipped behind him. Lion? Human? Porcupine? All of the above? Whatever he was, it was nightmare fuel. Evan yanked me toward the doors. “Move, Elena!” We bolted, but Coach was right behind us, his claws scraping the floor as he gained. And then— “Enough.” Mr. Whitman was standing in the doorway like this was just another Tuesday. The monster hissed. “You pathetic centaur, you will DIE!” “You forgot something,” Mr. Whitman said calmly. “I’m immortal. And you can call me by my name.” He slung a bow out of a bag that had no business holding it. I didn’t even have time to ask what was happening because the gym wall exploded inward, and a wave of monsters poured through. Everything after that was a blur—me kicking and punching, Evan headbutting creatures with his horns and stomping them with his hooves, Mr. Whitman firing arrows like he’d been doing it for a few thousand years. And the entire time, one thought kept screaming in my head: this was my vision, playing out exactly how I’d seen it. Evan’s face went dead serious. “We have to go. Now.” “What the heck is going on, Evan? What is that thing? Who is Mr. Whitman? Who are you?” I sputtered. “I’ll tell you later. Come!” He dragged me across what used to be our gym wall and bolted into the street. “Long Island? Why are we—” “Tell you later!” We tore through the busy streets of New York, weaving between honking taxis and ducking behind cars to check if we were being followed. “Let me at least call my mom!” I yelled. “No time! Besides, using a phone is like sending up a flare!” I had no clue what that meant, but I went with it. By the time we hit the trees on Long Island, my lungs were on fire. Evan ducked behind a massive oak, bent over, and gasped for breath. “Evan! What is going on? Just tell me for once,” I pleaded. “I will, Elena. I will. But not now.” A few minutes later, we were walking along a beach trail and straight into… a strawberry field. “Why are we at a strawberry field in the middle of nowhe—wait. What the actual heck? Is that some kind of… military camp? Without uniforms?” “That’s camp. Come on!” Evan shouted. I scrambled after him—until the ground shook. A huge giant with one eye stomped into view, holding a little girl in his fist. I squinted, and my stomach dropped. “Emily?!” My sister looked terrified. “Leave her ALONE!” I screamed and charged. What happened next was a blur—me punching and kicking like I’d never punched or kicked before. Evan fought with a set of flutes, of all things, playing a sharp, eerie tune. Roots shot up from the earth, coiling around the Cyclops like a snake. But of course, nothing can be easy. The Cyclops roared, ripped through the roots, and reached for Emily again. No. Absolutely not. Something deep in my chest cracked open, and suddenly—I wasn’t me anymore. I was light. Blinding, searing light. The forest glowed gold. The Cyclops shrieked and vaporized into dust. When it was over, I felt like I’d done a thousand jumping jacks in a sauna. My knees gave out, and I collapsed in the dirt. Somewhere far away, I heard Evan yelling my name and Emily trying to stand. Other voices—older, confident—rushed toward us. Then everything went dark. I woke up with a start. For a second, I wanted to believe it was all a dream—the Cyclops, Evan with hooves, Mr. Whitman’s weirdness—but that was impossible, because they were both sitting right there. And Mr. Whitman… something about him was off. He was just too tall. Then I looked down and saw why. Yep. Horse legs. The manticore hadn’t been lying—he was a centaur. “It wasn’t… it wasn’t a dream, was it? All that stuff, about you having hooves, and Mr. Whitman being—whatever you are? Who are you? Why am I here?” Mr. Whitman sighed, like he’d had this conversation a hundred times. “Everyone who makes it here is confused, Elena,” he said, his voice softer now. “Getting here at all is a milestone.” His eyes were warm, almost proud. “Killing a Cyclops—especially a grown one—is no small feat. Evan, show her around. Make her feel at home.” He trotted away, leaving me with Goat Boy. “Come on, Elena. I still owe you an explanation.” Finally, some logic. I followed him down a narrow set of stairs. “So,” I said, “explanation time. What is this place? Why am I here? And who am I, exactly?” He gave me this you’re-not-gonna-like-the-answer look. “You know those Greek myths? Gods, heroes, monsters?” “Yeah, what about them?” “They’re real.” I blinked. “I knew it! All these years, I thought I was crazy—hallucinations, visions—” I stopped. “Wait… I’ve had so many visions. Some about the near future. Some that haven’t happened yet. I still remember all of them.” Evan’s eyes widened. “You still remember them? That’s… bad, Elena. Really bad.” He muttered something in a language I didn’t recognize, then crossed three fingers over his chest like he was shooing away bad luck. “What was that? And why is it bad?” “Ch—Mr. Whitman will tell you. For now, I’m just the tour guide.” We stepped outside, and I froze. The place was nothing like I’d expected. A ring of cabins stood in a huge clearing, with more scattered near the woods. Kids were sword-fighting, practicing archery, and, weirdest of all, laughing like this was all totally normal. There were kids everywhere—some sparring with swords, some shooting arrows, a few just sitting under trees like this was a summer picnic. The air smelled like campfire smoke and strawberries. “What is this place?” I asked again, softer this time. “This,” Evan said, sweeping his arm across the view like a game-show host, “is Camp Half-Blood. Home for demigods, children of the Greek gods.” “Children of the gods,” I repeated, testing the words on my tongue. “So, you’re telling me one of my parents is—” “A god, yeah,” he said, like we were talking about a weather forecast. “And based on what happened with that Cyclops… I think I know which one.” We walked past a group of kids at the archery range. One arrow split another in half midair. I stopped. “Okay, whoa. What just happened?” “Archery. Pretty normal here. You’ll get used to it.” “Pretty sure I won’t,” I muttered, but followed him anyway. We stopped in front of one of the cabins—bright white paint, a polished gold sun over the door. “This one’s yours,” Evan said. “My… cabin?” He nodded. “Apollo’s cabin.” The name hit me like a brick. Suddenly, the blinding light in the forest made sense. Sort of. “Apollo… the sun guy? Music, healing, prophecy?” “And archery,” Evan added. “But you—you’ve got something different. That light thing you did? That’s not just an Apollo kid thing. It’s rare. I’ve only heard of a couple demigods who could pull it off. Most of them didn’t make it to adulthood.” I stared at him. “Wow, thanks for the pep talk.” “Hey, I’m serious,” he said, lowering his voice. “If the monsters figure out what you are, they won’t just be chasing you—they’ll be hunting you.” A shiver ran down my spine, but I stepped toward the cabin anyway. Whatever was waiting for me inside, I had the feeling this was just the start. When I entered the cabin, I was greeted by a million voices, coming from all directions. A boy with curly, blonde hair came up to me and asked,""Hey, you're Elena, right?"" ""Yeah,"" I replied. ""I'm Will Solace, head councellor of Apollo cabin."" Whoa, seems like dad is pretty busy nowadays,"" I said, looking around. ""Yeah, well, that light thing you did out there was awesome. I saw it."" I blushed. Like, actually blushed. It had been at least a hundred years since i last blushed, and I had a feeling this place had a lot more in store for me. ""Thanks,"" I said. ""It's been a while since I was last praised like that.."" I looked down. ""Don't worry, everyone here is family, am I right?"" ""Yeah!"" A hundred voices said at once. ""Come on, I'll show you around."" Will smiled at me encouragingly and took me outside. I stepped into the cabin, the noise hit me first—a hundred different voices bouncing off the walls, laughter, and the occasional burst of song. It was like stepping into a sunbeam with ADHD. A boy with curly blonde hair weaved through the crowd and stopped in front of me. “Hey, you’re Elena, right?” “Yeah,” I said, still taking in the chaos. “I’m Will Solace, head counselor of Apollo Cabin.” “Oh,” I said, scanning the room. “So… Dad’s been pretty busy, huh?” Will grinned. “Yeah, well, that light thing you pulled out there? Awesome. I saw it.” I actually blushed. Me. Blushing. I don’t even remember the last time that happened—felt like at least a hundred years ago. “Thanks,” I mumbled. “It’s… been a while since anyone’s said something like that.” “Don’t worry,” Will said, clapping me on the shoulder. “Everyone here’s family. Right, guys?” “Yeah!” a chorus of voices rang out from all corners of the cabin. Will’s smile widened. “Come on, I’ll show you around.” And just like that, I followed him outside, wondering how much stranger my life was about to become. As we walked into the fields, Will started pointing things out like a hyperactive tour guide. “Over there—that’s the dining pavilion. And that one, right over there—that’s the sports pavilion. Oh, and that’s the Pegasus stables.” I followed his finger to a cluster of stalls where a couple of winged horses were snorting at each other. My brain kind of froze for a second. Actual flying horses. Casual. “And here,” Will continued, “are the twelve cabins of the Olympians.” We stopped in front of a massive golden building that looked like it could double as a palace. “This is the Zeus cabin,” he said, then pointed to the one next to it. “And that’s the Hera cabin. Honorary—no actual campers live there. The Zeus cabin used to have someone, but she joined the Hunters of Artemis. You’ve heard of them, right?” I nodded. “Yeah, the girl band with bows.” Will smirked. “Exactly. Her name was Thalia Grace. And this—” he stopped at a cabin that looked like it had been designed by the ocean itself “—is the—” “Let me guess,” I interrupted. “Poseidon cabin.” He grinned. “Nice! Yeah, Poseidon cabin. Only one camper lives here—Percy Jackson. Saved Olympus a couple of times. Guy’s a legend. Want to meet him?” “That’s… actually super cool. Yeah, I wanna meet him.” Will cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled, “Percy! The new girl wants to meet you!” “One sec!” a voice called from inside. A moment later, the bathroom door swung open, and a guy with messy black hair stepped out, still drying his hands. “Hey, I’m Percy. You must be Elena, right?” “Yeah,” I said. “Elena Brooks. Nice to meet you.” He looked me over like he was trying to figure out if I was dangerous, important, or just really weird. I raised an eyebrow. “What? Do I have something on my face?” Percy blinked and shook his head. “No, just… you’ve got that ‘fresh off the monster attack’ look. Brings back memories.” “Oh, good. I was hoping to look like a disaster,” I said dryly. Will chuckled. “Come on, Jackson, don’t freak her out. We’ve got more cabins to hit.” We left Percy waving after us and headed toward a squat, brick-red building that looked like it had survived about fifty explosions. “This,” Will said, “is Ares cabin. God of war, general bad moods, and questionable hygiene.” Right on cue, the door banged open and a tall girl in combat boots stomped out, glaring like we’d just insulted her mother. “What?” she snapped. “Nothing, Clarisse,” Will said, grinning. “Just showing the new kid around.” Clarisse gave me a slow once-over, muttered something about “another sunshine child,” and stalked off. “Friendly bunch,” I whispered. Will shrugged. “You get used to them. Eventually. Anyway—” he pointed at a cabin painted in every shade of green imaginable, with plants literally growing up the sides “—that’s Demeter cabin. They’re big on gardening, breakfast foods, and getting in trouble for sneaking cereal into the dining pavilion.” A girl with leaves in her hair waved from the doorway. “Hi, Will! Who’s your friend?” “Elena,” I called back. She beamed. “We’ve got fresh strawberries if you ever want some!” Will leaned closer. “They’ve always got strawberries. And corn. And occasionally an aggressive pumpkin patch.” We moved on, passing cabins with rainbow mosaics, owl carvings, and even one that looked like it had been sculpted out of bronze. Each had its own vibe—some loud, some quiet, all of them very much not normal. Finally, we stopped at a sleek cabin with a glowing sunburst over the door. “And this,” Will said, “is home.” The inside was even brighter than I remembered—sunlight streaming through skylights, golden instruments lining the walls, campers laughing, talking, and tuning guitars. For the first time since the whole Cyclops incident, my chest didn’t feel tight. Maybe—just maybe—I’d landed somewhere I could belong.

2. I get a prophecy that will save or destroy the world

The campfire smelled like cedar smoke, burnt marshmallows, and singed hair — the last one thanks to a Hephaestus kid who thought it was a good idea to roast three s’mores at once. I sat between Will Solace and Evan, pretending to hum along to an Apollo cabin song. Will said I was “pretty good at harmonizing.” I told him I was just trying not to choke on my marshmallow. A couple campers laughed. It felt almost… normal. Then the flames changed. One second they were the usual cheery orange, and the next they flared green — a sickly, unnatural green that made every shadow look sharper. Conversations died mid-sentence. You could hear the whisper of the night breeze through the strawberry fields. “She’s here,” someone whispered. Rachel Elizabeth Dare stepped forward, barefoot in the grass, her bright red hair glowing like a torch in the green light. I’d seen her around camp, but I’d never seen her like this — her eyes were gone, replaced by swirling green smoke that poured out like fog in reverse. Chiron’s voice was calm but heavy. “The Oracle will speak.” And speak she did. Her body went still, her mouth opened, and an ancient, layered voice rolled out, echoing through the night: ""Six shall rise when the sky is torn, To face the wrath of one reborn. From sea, from light, from forge and flame, From storm and earth, none leave the same. One’s choice will bind the world’s last breath, Or loose the chains and wake its death."" The final word hung in the air like smoke that refused to fade. Then Rachel gasped, blinking rapidly, her green eyes back to normal. She stumbled, and Chiron caught her by the arm, steadying her. The fire flickered back to orange. Nobody spoke. Nobody even moved. Every camper’s gaze drifted toward me, like they all knew something I didn’t — or worse, something I wasn’t ready to know. Will broke the silence with the same easy tone he used to ask if I wanted seconds at dinner. “Well… guess you’re officially on the prophecy list.” My stomach dropped. I had no idea what “the prophecy list” was, but something told me it wasn’t the kind of list you wanted to be on. The campfire ended early after that. No more songs, no more s’mores. Everyone drifted back to their cabins in small, whispering groups, throwing me the occasional side-eye like I’d just grown another head. I didn’t even make it to my cabin before Chiron called out, “Elena. A word, please.” Evan gave me an apologetic shrug and peeled off toward the satyr cabins. I followed Chiron to the Big House. Inside, the room smelled faintly of coffee and old books. A map of Ancient Greece was spread across the table, but instead of islands and coastlines, it was marked with glowing red dots that pulsed faintly. Will was already there, leaning against the wall. Rachel sat in a chair, still looking pale but steady, a glass of water in her hands. “Sit,” Chiron said. His voice wasn’t unkind, but it left no room for argument. I sat. “That prophecy…” I started, but Chiron held up a hand. “Prophecies are dangerous things, Elena. They are never as straightforward as they sound. But this one—” His eyes darkened. “—this one is especially troubling.” Rachel spoke for the first time, her voice quieter than I expected. “The ‘one reborn’… it’s not a mortal. It’s not even a god in the usual sense. It’s older.” She looked straight at me, and it felt like she could see through my skin. “It’s Ouranos.” I blinked. “Who?” Will whistled low. “Primordial god of the sky. Father of the Titans. The guy Kronos overthrew with a scythe. Big, big bad.” Chiron nodded. “If he returns, the world as we know it will end. And the prophecy says six will stand against him.” I thought of the green fire, the way everyone stared at me after the prophecy. “And I’m one of them.” “From sea, from light, from forge and flame, from storm and earth,” Rachel recited softly. “That’s five. Plus the one who binds or breaks it all — that’s you.” My mouth went dry. “And if I… mess up?” Chiron’s expression was grave. “If you fail, Elena, you will not have to worry about  the consequences. No one will.” Chiron tapped the map, and the glowing red dots pulsed brighter. “We’ve confirmed disturbances in several locations — monster activity unlike anything we’ve seen in decades. The prophecy suggests your quest will take you far from here.” Will leaned forward. “So who’s going with her?” “Not my decision alone,” Chiron said. “The prophecy calls for six, chosen for their… unique traits.” His eyes flicked to me. “The light is obvious — Elena, daughter of Apollo.” Rachel sipped her water. “From sea — Percy Jackson. He’s the only one strong enough to face what’s coming from that front.” Percy raised an eyebrow. “Guess I’m in whether I like it or not.” Chiron’s gaze moved on. “From forge and flame — a child of Hephaestus. We’ll speak to Leo Valdez.” “Storm,” Rachel continued, “points to a child of Zeus — but Thalia Grace is still with the Hunters, so it may be someone… new.” “That leaves earth,” Chiron said. “A child of Demeter or Hades could fit that role. We’ll need to decide soon.” “And the sixth?” I asked. Will crossed his arms. “That’s the scary part. The prophecy says one’s choice will bind the world’s last breath. That’s not a power slot — that’s a wildcard. Could be friend. Could be…” “Foe,” Rachel finished for him. The room fell silent. “Tomorrow,” Chiron said finally, “we begin preparations. You’ll train, study, and — more importantly — learn to work as a unit. You have until the summer solstice to be ready. After that…” He didn’t finish the sentence, but the look in his eyes told me enough. I glanced around at Percy, Will, Rachel, and Chiron. Somewhere out there were the rest of my so-called team. And according to the prophecy, we’d either save the world… or rip it apart. The next morning, I woke up to Will banging on my cabin door like the world was already ending. “Rise and shine, Sunshine!” he yelled. “We’ve got a prophecy to stop!” I groaned, pulled on my shoes, and followed him to the training fields. A small group was already waiting. Percy was leaning against the fence like he had nothing better to do. Beside him was a lanky boy with soot on his hands, spinning a wrench like it was a dagger. “This is Leo Valdez,” Will said. “Forge and flame. Try not to let him near anything flammable unless you want an accidental fireworks show.” Leo grinned. “Relax. I only set stuff on fire intentionally… most of the time.” Next to him stood a girl in dark green, her hair braided with bits of vine. She gave me a polite nod. “Demeter kid,” Leo whispered. “Earth powers. Don’t get on her bad side unless you want weeds growing out of your ears.” Her voice was calm but firm. “Name’s Calista. And Leo, stop scaring the new people.” The last one was leaning against the shade of a tree, arms crossed. He had sharp features, storm-gray eyes, and that I’m-too-cool-to-care vibe. “This is Damon,” Percy said. “We think he’s a Zeus kid. He hasn’t exactly confirmed it, but the whole lightning thing kinda gives it away.” Damon smirked. “You try not frying the practice dummies when you sneeze. See how subtle you are.” Will clapped his hands. “Alright, dream team — we’ve got six weeks to turn into a unit before we march out into probable doom. Today we start simple: obstacle courses, combat drills, and, for Elena, light control practice.” I looked around at my so-called teammates. Percy was casual confidence. Leo was chaos in human form. Calista seemed quiet but dangerous. Damon was all ego and electricity. And me? I had no idea what I was doing here… except that some creepy green words said I was the “one who binds or breaks it all.” No pressure. Training at Camp Half-Blood was not “light exercise” like Will promised. It was “I-can’t-feel-my-legs” hard. First, the obstacle course. Percy slid through it like he’d been born to dodge swinging logs and climb rope walls. Damon practically cheated by blasting himself up the cliff with a mini lightning bolt. Leo… accidentally set part of the net on fire. Calista grew a vine bridge to get across the mud pit, which Will said was technically against the rules, but no one argued. Then there was me. I tripped over the first rope. Twice. Combat drills weren’t much better. My opponent, Percy, clearly went easy on me — until I managed to flash a burst of light in his face and make him stumble. “Okay,” he said, rubbing his eyes, “you’re officially annoying in a fight.” “Thanks,” I panted. Will had me spend the afternoon learning to control my light powers. “Think of it like a dimmer switch,” he said. “You don’t always need to go full lighthouse.” I tried small bursts, focused beams, even a blinding flash that knocked Leo straight off the sparring ring. “Note to self,” he groaned from the ground, “do NOT prank the sun girl.” By the time the sun started setting, we were sprawled out on the hill overlooking the camp. Percy tossed a strawberry to Damon, who caught it without looking. Calista braided flowers into a crown and plopped it on Leo’s head, much to his horror. It wasn’t much, but it was something. For the first time since I got here, I felt like I might actually belong. Of course, that’s when Chiron trotted up and ruined the moment. “Enjoy your rest,” he said, “because tomorrow you’ll begin simulated quest trials. And trust me… they will not be kind.” No one said anything, but I swear I saw Damon grin. The next morning, Chiron led us to the forest’s edge. “This is your first trial,” he announced. “Inside, you’ll find three capture-the-flag markers. Retrieve them before the sun sets… and try not to die.” “Try?” I muttered. “Did he say try not to die?” Leo whispered to me. The forest swallowed us whole the second we stepped inside. It was darker than it should’ve been, and every rustle sounded like something sharp and hungry. Damon took point, sparks flickering around his hands. Percy stayed at the rear, keeping an eye out for flankers. We found the first marker tied to a branch — and the first monster right below it. A dracaena, half-woman, half-snake, all fangs. Damon moved to fry it, but Calista’s vines shot out first, tangling it long enough for Percy to slash it into gold dust. One marker down. The second was harder. It was wedged into the wall of a small cave — home to a hellhound the size of a pickup truck. We had to distract it while Leo climbed the wall and grabbed the flag. My blinding flash bought him just enough time, though I was so dizzy afterward I nearly fell into the cave. Percy yanked me back at the last second. Two markers down. We were halfway to the last one when the air changed. The wind picked up, cold and sharp. A voice rolled through the trees, deep enough to rattle my ribs. “Little lights… flicker and die.” I froze. “Please tell me you all heard that.” Everyone nodded, eyes wide. Even Damon looked rattled. We found the last marker in a clearing, but something — someone — was waiting. A tall, shadowy figure with eyes like shards of night. Its presence felt heavy, ancient, wrong. “This isn’t part of the trial,” Percy muttered, pulling Riptide from his pocket. The figure just smiled. “Tell your Oracle… the sky remembers.” Then it dissolved into the wind, leaving the forest silent again. We grabbed the last marker and ran. None of us said a word until we were out of the trees. “That,” Will said grimly, “was not in the script.” That night, the campfire didn’t feel warm. Even with flames crackling in the center of the pavilion and campers singing off-key, my skin still prickled with the memory of that voice in the woods. Chiron stood at the edge of the firelight, listening to Percy’s report with a face carved from stone. “A shadow in the forest… speaking to you directly?” he repeated. “Yeah,” Percy said, tossing a twig into the fire. “And I’m guessing it wasn’t the friendly neighborhood wind spirit.” Calista frowned. “It said… the sky remembers. Does that mean anything?” Chiron’s gaze flicked toward the Big House. “Perhaps. But the Oracle will decide.” As if on cue, Rachel Elizabeth Dare appeared from the shadows, wearing a paint-splattered camp T-shirt and looking slightly winded. “You called?” “Rachel,” Chiron said, “we may have a… pressing matter. Will you consult the Oracle?” She nodded, stepped toward the fire, and closed her eyes. For a moment, nothing happened — then the flames shot higher, turning green, and her voice changed. It became layered, ancient, not entirely hers. Six will answer the sky’s demand, Through shadowed wood and ruined land. One born of light, to blind the storm, One forged in fire, in battle’s form. One crowned in thorns, with roots that bind, One sea-born heart, both fierce and kind. Two from the storm, in blood allied— To save the world… or see it die. The fire dimmed. Rachel swayed, rubbing her temples. “Ugh. Prophecy hangover. You’re welcome.” I blinked. “Six people… one born of light? That’s me, isn’t it?” Percy glanced at me. “Yeah. And I think I know who the sea-born heart is, too.” No one laughed. The crackle of the fire felt louder than it should. Chiron finally broke the silence. “It seems, my friends… you have a quest.”

If you’re looking to escape the beach heat and discover a cooler, quieter, greener side of Bali - Munduk should be on your radar.

I've lived in Bali for several years and always recommend Munduk to travelers who want mountain air, misty mornings, and stunning waterfalls — without the Ubud crowds or beach club chaos.

# Where Is Munduk?

* A mountain village in North Bali, about 2.5–3 hours from Ubud or Canggu by car/scooter.
* Nestled between Lake Tamblingan, Lake Buyan, and tropical rainforest ridges.
* Altitude: \~1,000 meters = cool nights, foggy mornings, and fresh air year-round.

# Why Visit Munduk?

# Waterfalls Galore

* You can hike between 5+ major waterfalls in one morning:
   * Munduk Waterfall, Melanting, Golden Valley, Labuhan Kebo, Red Coral.
   * Trails are easy-moderate and connectable by foot.

# Coffee & Clove Plantations

* The area is known for traditional coffee roasting — you can visit family farms, see the process, and taste locally grown arabica.
* Clove trees give the air a spicy, earthy aroma in harvest season (July–Sept).

# Scenic Treks & Jungle Vibes

* Lake Tamblingan has jungle treks with canoes and local guides.
* Great for nature photography: misty lakes, jungle temples, sunrise over the caldera.

# No Tourist Crowds

* It’s peaceful. No beach clubs, no yoga cults, no traffic noise.
* You’ll see more farmers than influencers, which is part of the charm.

# Where to Stay

* Budget: One Homestay, Nadya Homestay – warm family vibes, <$20/night.
* Mid-range: Lesong Hotel, Atres Villas, Puri Lumbung Cottages – traditional teak houses with amazing views.
* Luxury vibes: Munduk Moding Plantation – infinity pool above the clouds, coffee plantation, spa.

# Where to Eat

* Warung Heaven – local dishes + stunning views.
* Eco Cafe 2 – simple, delicious, very affordable.
* Ngiring Ngewedang – good for sunset dining.
* Most hotels/guesthouses have their own kitchens and offer homestyle meals.

# Climate & What to Pack

* Days: 22–26°C, Nights: 15–18°C – bring a light jacket or hoodie.
* Rain is more common in wet season (Nov–Mar), but mornings are often still clear.
* Bring hiking shoes, bug spray, and rain protection just in case.

# Getting There & Around

* No Grab/Gojek – arrange a driver from Ubud or Lovina.
* Scooter rental available (\~75–100k/day), but roads can be steep and foggy.
* Munduk works well as a 2–3 night stay on a route from Ubud → Bedugul → Munduk → Lovina.

# Who Will Love Munduk?

* Hikers, photographers, writers.
* Couples or solo travelers wanting a reset.
* Coffee nerds.
* Anyone tired of Bali’s party/co-working scene and looking for stillness.

# Who Might Not Like It

* Digital nomads needing 24/7 fast Wi-Fi - it’s fine, but not Canggu-level.
* Nightlife lovers — evenings here are for stargazing or reading.
* Beach seekers — no ocean nearby.

# Final Thoughts

Munduk is one of Bali’s most underrated spots.  
It’s not for everyone - but if you're craving clean air, gentle hikes, jungle waterfalls, and sipping coffee while watching clouds roll through the valley, it might just be the soul-reset you didn’t know you needed.

Guys, business automation is absolutely blowing my mind right now. Why? Because it’s genuinely reshaping the way companies operate, boosting both productivity and creative freedom. Can we take a moment to appreciate how we’re now living in a time where tasks that once took DAYS are being done almost instantly? Yes please!

Here’s what’s getting me *really* hyped about automation:

- **No More Soul-Crushing Repetitive Tasks:** Those mindless manual tasks that drained brain power? Automate and forget ’em! Letting machines handle boring stuff gives us back precious hours for actual human genius.
- **Greater Accuracy!🦾**: Fewer typos. Fewer missed steps. Automation means consistency, which means fewer frantic 2AM ""did I forget that invoice?"" moments.
- **Scalability Like Never Before:** Growing a business doesn’t need to be scary! If you automate core workflows, scaling up is more plug-and-play than ever.

Let’s be real—the benefits don’t stop at “it saves time.” I’ve seen *small businesses* unlock growth simply because automation let their teams focus on dreaming up new ideas rather than getting bogged down by spreadsheets.

It’s fun to imagine what the future might look like:
- Teams of 2 doing the work of 10.
- Freelancers running their own little superhero-style agencies with automations covering admin, outreach, YES—even creative aspects!
- Coffee shops texting you *personally* when your chai is brewed, because their whole order system is synced with customer apps and AI baristas. 😍

Some things that make automation so thrilling:
- The creative possibilities (Want to turn “check receipts” into “launch fun marketing ideas”? You can!).
- Being able to focus on OPTIMIZING and IMAGINING, not just maintaining and barely keeping up.

But I’m dying to know—where do *you* see automation making the biggest impact? Have you built automations for your biz, or do you have automation-dream ideas you hope to see come to life? Which processes are you praying some AI ninja will take off your plate?

Let’s share:
- Success stories (big wins or happy little time-savers).
- Automation fails, because lessons learned are priceless!
- Wild what-if dreams, because honestly: imagination is where the real fun starts.

I’m SO EXCITED for a world where we reach max productivity *not* by working harder, but by working SMARTER and with joy. Bring on the automation magic!✨

Can’t wait to hear what the rest of you are experimenting with, imagining, or downright geeking out over when it comes to business automation!",1,1755245443.0,GPTAppsEngine,0,1.0,False
1mqrfez,https://i.redd.it/pfd0j6gn55jf1.png,"Got overwhelmed by complex journaling apps, so I built something simple","Hi all!

I've been trying to get into journaling for years but every app I downloaded felt... wrong.

**My specific frustrations:**

* Apps like Day One wanted me to write these long, reflective entries every single day. Sometimes I just want to jot down a quick thought during lunch, you know?
* Most store your private thoughts on their servers. Why would I want some company reading my journal entries for ""AI insights""?
* The streak pressure was killing me. Miss one day and you're back to zero. Made journaling feel like a chore instead of something helpful.
* So many unnecessary features - complicated mood tracking, photo collages, sharing options. I just wanted to write stuff down.

**What I actually wanted:**

* Multiple short entries throughout the day when inspiration hits
* My data staying on MY devices (iCloud sync, but it's still mine)
* No guilt if I skip days or want to add something I thought of yesterday
* Just... simple text entry. That's it.

Couldn't find anything that matched this, so I spent some time building Inkwell for myself.

Now I actually journal regularly because it doesn't fight me. Sometimes it's just ""good coffee this morning,"" other times it's deeper stuff. No pressure either way.

If anyone wants to try it out, I'd genuinely appreciate the feedback—especially if you've had similar frustrations with other journaling apps. Still learning what works for different people.

**Pricing:**

* Free tier with almost all features, except insights and extended search
* Monthly: $0.99
* Annual: $14.99
* Lifetime: $29.99

Reema was scrolling through Discord late one night when she heard it. A voice so warm and smooth it made her stop everything she was doing. Someone was singing in the voice chat, and she felt like the song was meant just for her.

""That was beautiful,"" she typed in the chat.

""Thanks,"" came the reply. His username was Rojan\_Gamer. ""I'm glad someone was listening.""

That's how it started. Every night, Reema would join the same voice channel, hoping to hear Rojan sing. His voice made her feel special, like she mattered. When he talked to her, really talked to her, she felt seen for the first time in months.

""You're different from other girls,"" Rojan would say. ""You actually get me.""

Reema's heart would flutter every time he said things like that. She started staying up later and later, just to talk with him. Her friends barely saw her anymore. All she wanted was to hear that voice telling her she was special.

As weeks passed, Reema learned more about Rojan. He was 22, lived with his parents, and didn't have a job. He spent most days playing games in his room. But Reema didn't care. When he sang to her over Discord, when he made her laugh with his jokes, nothing else mattered.

""I wish I could see you in person,"" Rojan said one evening.

Reema's heart jumped. ""Really? You'd want that?""

""Of course. You're amazing, Reema. You make me feel alive.""

They lived in the same city. It felt like fate. Reema suggested they meet at a small café downtown. She was so nervous she could barely eat breakfast that morning.

When she saw Rojan walk into the café, he looked exactly like his photos - messy brown hair, kind eyes, a shy smile. But he seemed smaller somehow, quieter than his confident online voice.

""Hi,"" he said, sliding into the booth across from her.

""Hi,"" she whispered back, her cheeks burning.

The first date was awkward but sweet. Alex seemed nervous too. Maya paid for their coffee and sandwiches without thinking about it. She just wanted him to be comfortable.

""This is really nice,"" Rojan said as they walked around the park afterward. ""I haven't been out like this in... well, a long time.""

Reema felt proud that she could give him this experience. She felt needed.

Their dates became regular. Every weekend, Reema would plan something fun. Movies, restaurants, mini-golf, art museums. She always paid. Rojan never offered, and Reema never asked him to. She had a part-time job at a bookstore, and she saved every penny for their time together.

""You don't have to keep paying for everything,"" Rojan said one day, but his voice didn't sound like he really meant it.

""I want to,"" Reema said quickly. ""It makes me happy to treat you.""

And it did make her happy. Seeing Rojan smile when she surprised him with his favorite coffee, watching his eyes light up when she bought him a new game he'd been wanting - it felt like love.

Rojan would still sing to her over Discord most nights. Those moments felt magical. His voice wrapped around her like a warm blanket, making all her worries disappear. He'd tell her about his day, about the games he played, about his dreams of maybe starting a YouTube channel someday.

""You're the only good thing in my life,"" he'd say, and Reema would melt.

Months passed. Reema's savings account got smaller and smaller. She started picking up extra shifts at the bookstore. She stopped buying new clothes for herself, stopped hanging out with her other friends. All her money went to Rojan - their dates, little gifts, even helping him pay for new games when he really wanted them.

Her friends started asking questions.

""Reema, where have you been? We never see you anymore.""

""I'm just busy,"" she'd say.

""With that guy? The one you met online?""

Reema would get defensive. ""His name is Rojan, and yes. We're happy together.""

But were they together? Rojan had never officially asked her to be his girlfriend. He'd never said he loved her, not directly. But the way he looked at her, the way his voice got soft when he talked to her late at night - that had to mean something, right?

One evening, Reema was feeling brave.

""Rojan,"" she said during one of their Discord calls. ""What are we? I mean, are we... dating?""

There was a long pause. Too long.

""I mean, we hang out a lot,"" Rojan said finally. ""And I really care about you, Reema. You know that.""

It wasn't exactly the answer she'd hoped for, but it wasn't a no either. Reema decided it was enough.

Winter came. Reema had been seeing Rojan for almost six months. She'd spent nearly all her savings on their relationship, but she told herself it was worth it. Rojan was talking about maybe looking for a job after the holidays. That was progress.

One cold December night, Reema was getting ready for bed when Rojan called her on Discord. His voice sounded different - excited in a way she hadn't heard before.

""Reema, you'll never guess what happened today!""

""What?"" she asked, smiling at his enthusiasm.

""I met this girl at the coffee shop. The one you took me to last week? She was there with her laptop, and we started talking about music. Turns out she's a singer too! We talked for hours.""

Reema felt something cold settle in her stomach. ""Oh. That's... nice.""

""Yeah! Her name's Shri. She's really cool. We're thinking about maybe collaborating on some songs together.""

Reema lay in bed that night staring at the ceiling. Rojan had sounded more excited about this Shri girl than he'd sounded about anything in months. More excited than he'd ever sounded about Reema.

The next few weeks were different. Rojan still called her, still sang to her sometimes, but he talked about Shri a lot. How talented she was, how she understood music the way he did, how she had ideas for his YouTube channel.

Reema tried to be supportive. She tried to be the understanding, caring person Rojan said he valued so much. But every mention of Shri's name felt like a small knife in her chest.

""I think Shri might be able to help me get some gigs,"" Rojan said during one of their calls. ""She knows people in the music scene.""

""That's great,"" Reema managed to say. ""I'm happy for you.""

But she wasn't happy. She was scared. What if Rojan didn't need her anymore? What if Shri could give him things Reema couldn't?

Reema started suggesting more expensive dates. A fancy restaurant downtown. Concert tickets for a band Rojan liked. She put it all on her credit card, telling herself it was temporary. She just needed to remind Rojan how good they were together.

But Rojan seemed distracted during their dates now. He'd check his phone often, always with a small smile that Reema knew wasn't for her.

""Shri sent me this cool song,"" he'd say, showing Reema his screen.

Reema would nod and smile, but inside she felt like she was disappearing.

The end came on a rainy Thursday in January. Reema was at work when Rojan called her.

""Hey, Reema? Can we talk?""

Something in his voice made her step outside, even though it was pouring.

""What's up?""

""So, um, Shri and I have been spending a lot of time together lately, working on music and stuff.""

Reema's hand tightened around her phone. ""Okay.""

""And... well, things have kind of developed between us. Like, romantically.""

The world seemed to tilt. Reema had to lean against the brick wall of the bookstore to stay standing.

""What do you mean?"" she whispered.

""I mean we're dating now. Officially. I wanted to tell you before you heard it from someone else.""

""But what about us?"" The words came out small and broken.

""Reema, we were never really... I mean, we're friends. Good friends. I thought you knew that.""

Friends. After six months of dates she'd paid for, gifts she'd bought him, nights she'd stayed up listening to him sing, mornings she'd woken up thinking about him - he thought they were friends.

""I have to go,"" Reema said, ending the call before Rojan could say anything else.

She stood in the rain for a long time, letting it mix with her tears.

That night, Reema looked at her bank account. She'd spent over two thousand dollars on Rojan. Money she'd saved for college, for her future, for her dreams. Gone.

She thought about all the times she'd chosen him over her friends, all the nights she'd stayed home waiting for his calls, all the ways she'd made herself smaller to make him feel bigger.

Rojan had felt safe to her, special, like a beautiful dream. But dreams aren't real. And sometimes the person you think you're falling in love with is just someone who enjoys being loved without having to love back.

Reema deleted Discord that night. She called her friend OJ, who came over with ice cream and didn't say ""I told you so"" even though she probably wanted to.

""His loss,"" OJ said simply, hugging Reema tight.

It took time, but Reema slowly rebuilt her life. She picked up more hours at work to pay off her credit card. She started hanging out with friends again. She even went on a date with a guy from her English class - a guy who insisted on paying for his own coffee and actually asked her about her dreams.

Sometimes, late at night, Reema would remember Rojan's voice singing to her through her headphones. It still sounded beautiful in her memory. But now she knew that a beautiful voice doesn't make a person beautiful, and feeling needed isn't the same thing as being loved.

She deserved more than someone who would take everything she offered and give nothing back. She deserved more than being someone's safe harbor while they looked for their real adventure.

Reema was learning to love herself the way she'd loved Rojan - completely, generously, without conditions. And that, she realized, was the most beautiful song of all.",1,1755245142.0,u_Tight_Radish9150,0,0.99,False

I went on Monday. It was a national holiday in Japan. It was absolutely insanely busy. I only had a single reservation (Earth Mart, for 4:10PM. Won in the two month). I still saw 13 pavilions, 17 if you count commons countries individually. And it was… I’m gonna say easy? With a little prep. Here’s how I did it:

I lined up around 7:30-ish for a 9AM entry. I was still maybe 50th in my line. Entered around 9:05. Went straight to Korea, closed until 9:30. Then:

Walked into Germany by 9:10. 

Left, went straight to Korea. Basically walked in, maybe 9:40.

Walked into Vietnam while I was lost looking for Canada, shortly after 10AM. Stayed long enough to buy a coffee.

Walked into Canada as I’m a Canadian citizen, shortly after 10AM

Decided to walk towards Azerbaijan. Waited in line maybe 15 minutes? Then got in between 11:00 and 11:30.

Waited in line maybe 15 minutes at Nepal, got in before the lunch rush so I’m gonna say 11:45ish

Went to Commons C, walked in. It was during lunch. Saw Montenegro without waiting, waited maybe 20 minutes for Ukraine but it was so worth it.

Walked into Bangladesh

At this point, Expo was actively busy. So I had to wait maybe 10 minutes to get into Commons D, and then I saw Laos, Cuba, and Bhutan with no line and waited maybe 5 minutes for Pakistan.

Waited 30 minutes or so for Indonesia

Then the only really bad line: like an hour for Uzbekistan. So not worth it.

Walked into UTAGE

Earth Mart at 4:10. Pre-reserved.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Okay, so there are some legitimate complaints. I will say from the hours of 2:00 until closing it was basically impossible to get into any pavilion without a line, and most stretched for hours. I left the expo around 7:00 because honestly it didn’t seem to be getting any easier and I did not feel like waiting in a line for over an hour at that point. BUT from 9AM until lunchtime it was legitimately easy to see basically any pavilion that did not require reservations, even though it was a holiday in Japan. Even most of the “big ones” (ie Italy, France, Saudi Arabia) didn’t seem that bad, though I chose to spend my time at smaller venues. I think a lot of people are going into the Expo with this notion that they are going to be able to see EVERYTHING and that it’s this huge disappointment that some venues are harder to get into, or they spend all day trying to get into the most popular venues and not going in smaller ones. To me, as long as you go early and manage your expectations (ie you’ll see a few major pavilions and a lot of smaller ones), Expo is a blast.

My recommendations for pavilions:

1) Korea. It’s honestly maybe the coolest thing ever, and I’m so not biased because I live there or anything nuh uh

2) Earth Mart. Fully worth the hype. My understanding is that it’s one of the easier signatures to get into, too

3) Indonesia. How they pulled this off, I dunno. Also totally the nicest staff at Expo.

4) Ukraine. Absolutely gut wrenching

5) Nepal. The food smells as good as it is, and that’s saying something at Expo

~~~~~~~~~

PS that isn’t to say that there aren’t legitimate complaints. The app is useless. Expo is primarily designed for locals. It is definitely impossible to see more than one or two signature pavilions in a day unless you are extremely lucky. But to those naysayers saying “you’ll pay 7000 and see NOTHING”… yeah, you’re acting in bad faith ",3,1755244977.0,OsakaWorldExpo,2,1.0,False
1mqrajp,https://www.reddit.com/r/SiliconValleyBayArea/comments/1mqrajp/oracle_chops_well_over_100_bay_area_jobs/,Oracle chops well over 100 Bay Area jobs,"Oracle's recent decision to cut over 100 jobs in the Bay Area is a noteworthy development that underscores the shifting dynamics of the tech industry in the region. While layoffs are not uncommon in the fast-paced tech landscape, the impact of such decisions resonates beyond the immediate workforce, influencing local economies, real estate markets, and investor sentiment. As Oracle trims its workforce in locations such as Redwood City and Pleasanton, it raises questions about the broader implications for Silicon Valley’s economic health and the implications for the real estate market.

At the surface level, the loss of over 100 jobs may seem modest, particularly in a region that boasts a robust labor force in the tech sector. However, the ramifications can extend far deeper, especially when considering the multiplier effect that tech jobs have on local economies. Tech positions often come with higher salaries, and the loss of these jobs can reduce disposable income and spending in the local area. This can lead to a decrease in patronage at nearby businesses, ranging from coffee shops to grocery stores, potentially forcing some to tighten their operations or even close. Consequently, this ripple effect could have a compounding impact on the local economy, particularly in regions that have become increasingly dependent on technology-driven economic activity.

Moreover, looking at the Bay Area's real estate landscape, job cuts can result in a shift in demand for housing. The tech industry has been a significant driver of the Bay Area's real estate boom, with employees typically seeking housing close to their workplaces. As Oracle employees face uncertainty, some may choose to relocate or downsize, leading to increased inventory in the housing market. This could potentially soften the current competitive landscape, giving first-time buyers or those looking to invest in real estate a more favorable opportunity in what has been a historically tight market. Conversely, the luxury segment of the Bay Area market, which has seen significant price increases, may feel pressure as high-income earners reconsider their housing options in light of job stability.

From an investment perspective, Oracle's layoffs could signal a broader trend of tightening budgets and strategic recalibrations among tech firms in the Bay Area. Investors often look for signs of stability and growth, and large-scale layoffs can raise red flags regarding a company's performance and future outlook. Companies that are scaling back may also reconsider their office space needs, leading to changes in demand for commercial real estate. If more tech firms follow suit, we could see an increase in available office space, which may result in landlords having to offer more competitive leasing terms. This ongoing transition highlights a critical juncture for investors: the potential for acquisition opportunities in both residential and commercial real estate as the market adjusts.

Additionally, Oracle's decision can be seen in the context of a broader economic landscape that includes rising inflation, interest rates, and a general tightening of venture capital funding across the tech sector. As companies grapple with these external pressures, they may continue to adapt their operational strategies, potentially leading to more job losses in the future. For residents, particularly those employed in tech or related industries, this could foster a sense of uncertainty regarding job security and financial stability, driving a cautious approach to spending and investment.

In summary, Oracle's layoffs serve as a microcosm of the evolving challenges and opportunities facing the Bay Area. While the immediate impact may appear constrained to a specific number of employees, the ripple effects influence local businesses, the residential housing market, and investor sentiment. As the region navigates this changing landscape, stakeholders—from residents to investors—must remain vigilant and adaptable, recognizing that the tech industry's dynamism continues to shape the fabric of the Bay Area's economy and real estate market. This period of transition could offer both challenges and prospects for those engaged in the local market, necessitating strategic foresight and a keen understanding of emerging trends.

""Lily, you must marry that comatose man James in place of my daughter. This is what you owe the Ginger family! You—""  
  
""I will.""  
  
Lily’s reply made her foster mother gasp in disbelief. “What did you say?”  
  
Lily could understand her shock. After all, in this massive capital city, who didn’t know how madly she was in love with John Jones? She’d loved him so much she’d given up her future, her dignity—everything.  
  
She had refused her foster mother many times before, all because of John. Her foster mother clearly hadn’t expected her to actually agree this time—to marry a total stranger who lay in a vegetative state.  
  
Calm and numb, Lily repeated, “I’ll do it.”  
  
Once it was clear Lily was serious, her foster mother let out a breath of relief before snapping at her again. “One month from now, the Luke family will register your marriage with their eldest son. They have decided on that day, and it's final. Someone will come to pick you up for the wedding that day. I’ve already accepted the bride price from the Luke family. It’s what you owe the Ginger family, and I’m not giving it back. If you dare go back on your word or stir up trouble, I will...”  
  
“I won’t,” Lily cut her off coldly.  
  
“The Luke family is rich. I trust the bride price was generous. You took me in from the orphanage and raised me for sixteen years. Now I’ll take your daughter’s place and marry into the Luke family. That settles my debt to you and the Ginger family. From now on, we owe each other nothing.”  
  
With that, she hung up.  
  
Sitting quietly at the dining table, Lily couldn’t help but reopen the news article she’d just seen.  
  
It was everywhere—videos of John and Elsa Quinn’s wedding flooded the internet, dominating the trending charts.  
  
In the video, he and Elsa stood hand in hand, surrounded by their friends, vowing to spend their lives together.  
  
The entire internet was offering their blessings, rejoicing that the two had reunited and wishing them a lifetime of happiness.  
  
Everyone except Lily.  
  
Because John was her boyfriend—the man she had loved with all her heart.  
  
Four years ago, he’d been paralyzed in a car accident. The cold-hearted Jones family had abandoned him, and Elsa had gone abroad and married someone else.  
  
Back when Lily was being bullied, he was the one who had pulled her out of it.  
  
She had loved him in secret for so long. On that freezing, snowy night when he had tried to end it all, she brought him home.  
  
She did everything she could to take care of him, to lift him out of the darkness one step at a time.  
  
She’d heard about a hospital overseas that could help him walk again. To raise the money, she sold her blood, became a punching bag for rich people, ending up with three broken ribs…  
  
She suffered endlessly, but finally, two years ago, she scraped together enough for the surgery.  
  
It was a success. He could walk again. He kissed her and promised he would treat her well for the rest of his life, that he would never let her down.  
  
She had believed that everything they’d been through was finally behind them, and from then on, it would all be smooth sailing.  
  
She never expected things to fall apart the moment Elsa came back.  
  
Word had it Elsa was gravely ill and only had six months to live. Her last wish was to marry John.  
  
He couldn’t bear to see the woman he once loved suffer, so the wedding Lily had spent six painstaking months preparing became Elsa’s.  
  
The wedding dress Lily had sewn with her own hands—Elsa wore it.  
  
The diamond ring John had custom-ordered for her—Elsa wore it on her left ring finger.  
  
Through blurred vision, Lily saw a pendant around Elsa’s neck.  
  
She recognized it instantly.  
  
It was the keepsake her parents had left her.  
  
She had lost it while trying to save John.  
  
He had once told her he found it and would give it to her on her birthday.  
  
But now, just because Elsa had said she liked it… he gave it to her instead.  
  
Suddenly, Lily realized there was no point in loving someone like John.  
  
She didn’t call him. Didn’t beg him to come back.  
  
She simply lit the candle on her birthday cake and stared blankly as it slowly burned down. The whipped cream cake melted into a mess—just like her love for John, which had burned to ash overnight, leaving not a trace of warmth.  
  
It was nearly dawn when John finally came home.  
  
When he saw her sitting at the dining table with red eyes, clearly having stayed up all night, his brows furrowed tightly.  
  
“Why haven’t you gone to bed?”  
  
Lily ignored his question and said calmly, “John, let’s break up. And tell Elsa to return my parents’ keepsake as soon as possible.”  
  
John immediately understood—she must’ve seen the news about his wedding with Elsa and was feeling jealous.  
  
He didn’t like it when women got jealous over nothing, but he had never once thought of leaving her. So he softened his voice.  
  
“Don’t be mad. I didn’t forget your birthday. This is your gift.”  
  
He opened a sleek burgundy velvet jewelry box in front of her.  
  
Inside lay a pink diamond necklace.  
  
The exquisite gem shimmered under the light. The centerpiece—a pink diamond the size of a pigeon’s egg—sparkled brilliantly.  
  
It was far more expensive than the pendant her parents had left her. But it wasn’t what she wanted.  
  
Just like how she no longer wanted him.  
  
John knew better than anyone how deeply Lily loved him, how she couldn’t live without him.  
  
When she stayed quiet, he thought it meant she was done throwing a fit.  
  
He reached for the necklace, intending to put it on her.  
  
“I don’t want this necklace! I just want my parents’ keepsake!”  
  
Lily slapped the necklace away and said stubbornly, “That pendant was left to me by my parents. How could you give it to Elsa? I only want that pendant!”  
  
Still throwing a tantrum...  
  
John’s patience snapped.  
  
His chiseled face turned cold and hard, like it had been carved from ice, filled with a sharp, suffocating pressure.  
  
“Elsa really likes that pendant.”  
  
“She’s so sick—how much longer do you think she’ll even get to wear it? Why must you fight over something with someone who's already dying? Lily, when did you become so selfish and heartless?”          
  
Chapter 2 She Bloomed Like a Rose and Entangled Him Without Mercy  
  
Selfish. Cold-blooded. Fighting a dying woman over a pendant…  
  
But that pendant was hers—left to her by her parents. What was so wrong about wanting it back?  
  
Did he really expect her to keep sacrificing everything for him after being betrayed so completely? Was she supposed to grovel after being humiliated like that?  
  
She wasn’t that pathetic.  
  
Before she could even say a word, John’s phone rang shrilly.  
  
It was a call from Elsa.  
  
Her voice was weak and pained. “John, I just threw up blood. I feel awful… Can you come be with me?”  
  
John paused.  
  
He hadn’t even managed to calm Lily down yet.  
  
But he figured Lily would never really leave him, and Elsa was already seriously ill. So he made his decision.  
  
“Elsa, don’t cry. I’m on my way.”  
  
Hearing her choked sobs, he didn’t bother explaining to Lily anymore. He turned around and left the room without looking back.  
  
As the front door slammed shut, Lily let out a cold laugh and kicked the diamond necklace into a corner.  
  
It had been like this ever since Elsa came back a month ago.  
  
Every time Elsa felt a little uncomfortable or upset, he would drop everything to run to her.  
  
Rain or shine, day or night—he was always there for her.  
  
It was like all those sweet whispers he’d once murmured to Lily, all those promises of eternal love, had been nothing but a dream.  
  
But luckily, it was all about to end.  
  
In one month, she’d marry James.  
  
Then John could stop worrying about her clinging to him, and go be happy with his precious crush. What a perfect outcome.  
  
Funny thing was—her wedding day would be on John’s birthday.  
  
His birthday, her wedding. Two celebrations on the same day. Poetic, really.  
  
As far as Lily was concerned, once she broke up with John, he was no longer her boyfriend. She had no reason to stay in his villa.  
  
And it just so happened to be a Sunday. She spent the whole day packing everything she owned.  
  
She sold what she could, tossed the rest.  
  
She’d contacted the biggest luxury resale company in Capital City. The staff came straight to her door, and her used bags and jewelry sold for a total of twenty million.  
  
She didn’t transfer a cent to John. She kept it all.  
  
She earned that money. It was hers.  
  
As night fell, Lily shredded the last tie she’d ever made for John, threw it away, and returned to her room.  
  
She was just about to leave with her suitcase when she noticed the photo on her nightstand.  
  
In the picture, she leaned against John’s shoulder, smiling brightly. He was gazing down at her with what looked like affection.  
  
John had always hated taking photos.  
  
This one was taken on her birthday last year, after she begged and pestered him nonstop. It was the only photo they had together.  
  
She had treasured it like gold.  
  
As soon as it was printed, she placed it on her nightstand and looked at it every single day. Even on business trips, she would take it with her.  
  
Now, all she felt was mockery.  
  
She smashed the frame against the floor and tossed it in the trash.  
  
…  
  
By the time John came home, it was late at night.  
  
He parked in front of the main house and immediately noticed the living room was dark.  
  
The sight made him vaguely uncomfortable.  
  
He often came home late from social events.  
  
But no matter how late it was, Lily would always leave the lights on for him.  
  
That single light in the night had always guided him home. So before Elsa returned, he had never once stayed out all night.  
  
He figured Lily was still sulking.  
  
Knowing her, she was probably curled up on the couch waiting for him to coax her.  
  
“Lily.”  
  
He snapped out of his thoughts and walked quickly into the living room, flipping on the lights.  
  
To his surprise, she wasn’t there.  
  
She wasn’t dozing on the couch like usual, struggling to keep her eyes open after waiting so long, ready to stumble into the kitchen and make some ginger tea for him.  
  
The living room felt… emptier.  
  
He couldn’t quite put his finger on what was missing, but it felt cold.  
  
“Sir, you’re back.”  
  
Hearing him, Mandy rushed out of her room. “Did you drink, sir? I’ll make you some ginger tea.”  
  
“No need.”  
  
John wasn’t in the mood. He rushed upstairs and headed straight to Lily’s room.  
  
She wasn’t there.  
  
The room itself was empty.  
  
The potted plants by the windowsill were gone. Even her pillows and bedding had vanished.  
  
The space used to be so cozy—plush toys, crystal bead curtains, whimsical wall stickers…  
  
Now, it was nothing but cold black and white.  
  
The sterile atmosphere irritated him.  
  
He turned around and asked Mandy in a chilling voice, “Where’s Lily?”  
  
His presence was so cold, it made Mandy shiver.  
  
She drew in a deep breath before answering honestly, “Miss Lily said… she broke up with you. And that she’s not coming back.”  
  
John was stunned into laughter by the nonsense Lily had left behind.  
  
So she was still throwing a tantrum?  
  
Running away from home?  
  
She really thought she had guts now, huh?  
  
“Mandy, leave.”  
  
Once she was gone, John dialed his assistant Wayne, face still cold, and ordered him to find out what hotel Lily was staying in.  
  
She had no family in Capital City. In such a rush, she couldn’t possibly have found a proper place to live.  
  
Running away in anger—she could only have gone to a hotel.  
  
Wayne worked fast. It didn’t take long before he confirmed she was at Capital City First Hotel.  
  
“Lily, how long are you going to keep this up?”  
  
John typed the message into the chat app—but then he stopped.  
  
And deleted it.  
  
Because he realized the photo frame on the nightstand was gone.  
  
He knew better than anyone how much Lily had treasured that photo.  
  
Even if she was throwing a fit, she must have taken it with her. No way she’d just walk out for good.  
  
He didn’t need to message her.  
  
Four years ago, the Ginger family kicked her out. Her biological parents had died when she was six. She’d had no home since then.  
  
If she didn’t come back to him—where else could she go?  
  
Since Elsa returned, they’d argued countless times.  
  
And every single time, she was the one who apologized first.  
  
This time would be no different. It was only a matter of time.  
  
…  
  
In the month since Elsa came back, Lily had been plagued by so many negative emotions that she hadn’t had a good night’s sleep.  
  
But now that she was free of that cage, she slept like a baby.  
  
Packing up the day before had drained her energy. Her calves were sore and aching—she really wanted to stay in bed.  
  
But it was a weekday. She had to go resign from Jones Corp.  
  
All those years with John, she’d built her life around him.  
  
When he was struggling, she worked herself to the bone to pay for his treatment. After he became successful, she became his personal assistant and cared for him in every detail.  
  
Now that she was done with him, there was no reason to keep that job either.  
  
She wanted to chase her childhood dream—to become a great voice actress.  
  
“Lily, my stomach hurts so bad, I can’t hold it anymore!”  
  
Lily had just arrived at the secretarial department when the new girl, Yulia Xander, ran up to her in a panic.  
  
Yulia looked absolutely pitiful. “Mr. John needs this file urgently. Can you please bring it to the CEO’s office for me?”  
  
She was clearly in crisis mode.  
  
Before Lily could even agree, Yulia had already dashed off toward the restroom in a very awkward pose.  
  
Lily didn’t want to see John.  
  
But it was obvious Yulia was desperate.  
  
She had a good impression of the girl and didn’t want her getting chewed out by the boss. So she took the file and headed for the CEO’s office.  
  
The door was slightly ajar.  
  
Lily raised her hand to knock—then froze.  
  
She heard Elsa’s coy, flirty voice.  
  
“John, my ankle suddenly hurts so much!”  
  
Her hand hovered over the door, then lightly pushed it open a crack.  
  
Through the narrow gap, she saw Elsa’s body suddenly go limp—and fall into John’s lap.  
  
“Elsa…”  
  
John seemed startled and instinctively grabbed her waist, probably afraid she’d get hurt.  
  
But even after regaining her balance, Elsa didn’t move.  
  
She hooked her arms around his neck, bright and alluring like a rose in full bloom.  
  
“John, I suddenly want to kiss you. What should I do?”  
  
As she spoke, her dewy red lips slowly pressed toward his—  
  
And John didn’t move away.         
  
Chapter 3 Spiraling, Unraveling, Lost in Her Wake  
  
""Lily...""  
  
Wayne Hunter had come to the CEO's office to give his report.  
  
Most employees at Jones Corp had no idea about Lily and John’s relationship.  
  
But Wayne, trusted by John for years, knew everything.  
  
Seeing Lily, he instinctively greeted her—only to catch sight of what was happening inside the office.  
  
He froze, horrified.  
  
Then quickly slapped a hand over his mouth.  
  
He looked at Lily, his eyes full of awkwardness and sympathy.  
  
""Elsa, I’m sorry.""  
  
John had been momentarily distracted, stunned for a good ten seconds before he quickly pulled away from Elsa.  
  
""I'm not blaming you,"" Elsa said coyly, cheeks flushed. ""My shoelace came undone.""  
  
Hearing that, Lily’s dull gaze dropped to Elsa’s shoes.  
  
Elsa was stunning.  
  
Bright, bold, beautiful in an almost aggressive way.  
  
Today, she wore crisp designer white sneakers, paired with a white blouse and a pleated pink skirt. Youthful and radiant, she looked exactly like a campus sweetheart.  
  
John didn’t say anything.  
  
But his actions spoke louder.  
  
He gently lifted Elsa onto the desk, then knelt to tie her shoelace. His movements were so careful, they almost looked reverent.  
  
Watching his long, elegant fingers slowly and intently tie the lace, Lily couldn’t help but remember something.  
  
Back then, when their love was still new, he had once said to her, “Lily, meeting you is the happiest thing that’s ever happened to me. I’ll protect you, treasure you, never let you suffer. Never betray you.”  
  
She had believed him with all her heart, like a fool, thinking she was the luckiest girl in the world.  
  
One day, while they were walking hand in hand, they saw a guy bending to tie his girlfriend’s shoelace. She’d snuggled into John’s arms and teased, “Would you tie mine if it came undone?”  
  
He had answered that it was pointless to compare things like that—too childish.  
  
It was obvious what he meant: no, he wouldn’t.  
  
John was like a cold, distant mountain capped with snow. She thought his aloofness made sense—it wasn't in his nature to stoop for something so small.  
  
As long as she had a place in his heart, it was enough.  
  
But now, seeing him so tenderly kneeling for Elsa, Lily finally understood. Love could win anyone over if their love was with the right person.  
  
All his so-called principles, all his “can’ts,” were never about principle.  
  
He just didn’t love her.  
  
And that was fine. They would both start new lives.  
  
It was fine.  
  
She stood outside the door, quietly watching as he tied Elsa’s laces, then began to massage her ankle.  
  
Watching the way they looked at each other, the unspoken affection sparking between them...  
  
She watched as the boy she had once loved so deeply blurred into a vague, unfamiliar shadow.  
  
When Elsa threw herself into John’s arms again, Lily didn’t linger.  
  
She turned and walked quickly toward the stairwell.  
  
""Ms. Lily!""  
  
Wayne had seen everything Lily had done for John over the years.  
  
The moment she turned to leave, he ran after her, worried.  
  
Normally quick with words, he found himself at a loss. That scene just now had been too damning. He didn’t know what to say to comfort her.  
  
Pushing his gold-rimmed glasses up his nose, he finally spoke awkwardly. “Don’t… don’t read into it. Honestly, the boss still really loves you. The last time you two fought, he got drunk and kept calling your name. He—”  
  
“Wayne, I’ve already broken up with John.”  
  
Lily knew Wayne meant well, but she didn’t let him finish.  
  
Ignoring the shock in his eyes, she continued, “He loves me? He loves me, so he married Elsa on my birthday? He loves me, so he’s tangled up with her like that, unable to let go? That kind of love—I don’t want it. Wayne, I’ve already written my resignation. Please sign it when you have a moment.”  
  
Wayne was the head of the secretary department. Lily didn’t need John’s signature to quit—but she did need his.  
  
“You’re really sure about this? Does the boss know?”  
  
Wayne had always been loyal to John.  
  
He didn’t want John getting back together with Elsa, not after she abandoned him when he was at his lowest.  
  
But after Elsa came back, he saw how John had treated her, and he knew it wasn’t fair to Lily.  
  
Deep down, Wayne understood—leaving John might actually be the best thing for her.  
  
That night, John got drunk after arguing with Lily; he hadn’t just called her name. He’d insisted she was his wife. When Elsa came in, John had pushed her away.  
  
Wayne knew John felt guilty that Elsa was dying.  
  
But somewhere along the way, he’d fallen for Lily too.  
  
Still, not wanting to make a move without permission, Wayne decided to speak with John before signing anything.  
  
“Ms. Lily, you’re giving this directly to the boss? I’ll bring it to him. I’ll talk to him first. If he agrees, I’ll sign it.”  
  
Lily had wanted to finalize her resignation as soon as possible.  
  
But she didn’t want to make things difficult for Wayne. She handed over the file and returned to her office to wait.  
  
Even if John didn’t approve it, she wouldn’t be coming in tomorrow.  
  
She liked finishing what she started, but there was no point dragging out something that no longer mattered.  
  
…  
  
That afternoon, after confirming Elsa had left, Wayne went to John’s office.  
  
As soon as he stepped in, he saw John’s face was thunderous.  
  
“Boss…”  
  
“Who made this coffee?”  
  
John glared at the cup on his desk like it had personally offended him.  
  
Wayne instantly understood what was going on.  
  
He hadn’t signed Lily’s resignation yet—but she’d already given up and stopped working.  
  
The coffee John used to drink was always brewed by Lily herself.  
  
Wayne had tasted it before—so good that even top baristas would struggle to replicate it.  
  
Compared to hers, anyone else’s brew might as well have been sewage. Of course John hated it.  
  
Wayne swallowed hard and said honestly, “Boss, it wasn’t Ms. Lily. She just… she submitted her resignation. Should I sign it?”  
  
Resign?  
  
John’s expression darkened even further.            
  
Chapter 4 They All Forced Lily to Apologize to Elsa  
  
As if realizing something, John let out a cold laugh.  
  
So that’s what this was—Lily was throwing a tantrum and threatening him with a resignation. Playing hard to get, was she?  
  
He knew better than anyone how much she wanted to be his personal assistant.  
  
She’d buttered him up for days just to land that role.  
  
If he really approved her resignation, she’d be the first to panic.  
  
She needed a lesson—to understand she had gone too far this time.  
  
“Sign it.”  
  
After letting out that icy aura, John added coldly, “And when you do, tell her—if she resigns, she better never come back.”  
  
Wayne shrank his neck.  
  
He wanted to say Lily seemed completely determined this time, like she never intended to come back at all.  
  
But the killing intent radiating from John was too terrifying, so he kept quiet.  
  
He just nodded and respectfully went to sign off on her resignation.  
  
…  
  
Once Wayne signed, Lily quickly completed all her paperwork and left the company.  
  
Almost the moment she got back to the hotel, a message came in from John.  
  
“Come to Flora Club.”  
  
Flora Club—the place John always took his friends for drinks and parties.  
  
Lily had broken up with him. She had no intention of going.  
  
She was about to refuse when another message followed:  
  
“If you still want your parents’ keepsake, be in front of me in half an hour.”  
  
Lily desperately wanted to get that pendant back. She didn’t dare delay and rushed to Flora Club.  
  
Inside the private room, Elsa and several of John’s close friends were already there.  
  
When Lily pushed open the door, she immediately saw John seated in the center of a deep red leather couch, Elsa curled up beside him.  
  
Elsa lifted her chin proudly, striking and radiant as ever.  
  
John sat protectively at her side, every movement full of tenderness and care.  
  
Lily felt a sharp sting behind her eyes.  
  
But she had come for a reason. She swallowed the bitterness and stepped inside.  
  
“Apologize to Elsa!”  
  
The moment John saw her, he slammed his glass down at her feet.  
  
“How dare you send thugs after Elsa to steal the pendant? If Simon hadn’t happened to pass by and save her, she would've been assaulted by those animals!”  
  
His friends all jumped in, shouting their indignation.  
  
“Hey, you, that was too much!”  
  
“We get that you’re jealous of Elsa, but this? You can’t just send people to attack her!”  
  
“Apologize to Elsa now. Maybe if she lets it go, John will still forgive you!”  
  
Elsa…  
  
Lily stood frozen, face pale.  
  
She’d loved John so much. She had gone out of her way to be nice to his friends, always trying to fit in.  
  
But in all the years she was with John, not one of them ever called her by name. Their attitude had never even been respectful.  
  
She used to think they were just arrogant and blunt by nature.  
  
But hearing the way they now fawned over Elsa, she finally understood—they had never lacked manners. They simply knew John didn’t truly care about her. She wasn’t worth respecting.  
  
But Elsa—despite having betrayed John four years ago—was cradled in the palm of his hand. So now, they all worshiped her too.  
  
“Lily, apologize to Elsa!”  
  
John’s cold voice snapped in her ear. Lily snapped out of her daze.  
  
She hadn’t done anything. Of course she wouldn’t admit to something she didn’t do.  
  
“I didn’t send anyone to hurt Elsa. I—”  
  
“Those thugs said you were behind it. Elsa wouldn’t lie!”  
  
John cut her off without letting her finish. “I’ll say it one more time. Apologize.”  
  
Elsa wouldn’t lie…  
  
Lily almost laughed out loud.  
  
So if Elsa said something, it was the truth? But when I spoke, it was all lies?  
  
Even if he loved Elsa more, after four years together, shouldn’t he know what kind of person I was?  
  
Shouldn’t he trust me, just a little?  
  
Was it really that easy for him to condemn her?  
  
“I didn’t do anything wrong. I won’t apologize to Elsa.”  
  
Lily hated being falsely accused. Even as the cold in her chest turned to ice, she still stood up for herself.  
  
“If someone’s word is all it takes to convict a person, then what if I say Elsa’s a murderer? Should we send her to jail? I didn’t do this. I’m not admitting to it. Call the police if you want. If they find me guilty, fine—but they’ll need evidence. Elsa’s lies don’t count.”  
  
“John… I didn’t lie…”  
  
Elsa’s voice trembled, her eyes red.  
  
A proud, dazzling rose now looked soft and wounded. It only made her more lovable.  
  
John’s patience with Lily had completely run out.  
  
He pulled out the pendant and held it up like a weapon.  
  
“Apologize to Elsa, or you’ll never see this again.”  
  
Lily’s gaze dropped to the pendant.  
  
It had been handmade by her parents, after studying with a master craftsman.  
  
Delicate gold filigree, encircling a fine piece of Hetian jade—one of a kind.  
  
Just seeing it brought back memories.  
  
Four years ago, when John was cast out by the Jones family after the accident, his father’s illegitimate son had tried to kill him.  
  
That snowy night, Lily had shielded him with her own body, taking two stab wounds before the police arrived.  
  
That night, her pendant had been stolen by those hired thugs.  
  
She’d lost it while saving his life.  
  
Even if he didn’t love her.  
  
Even if his heart belonged to Elsa.  
  
Once he recovered it, he should’ve returned it to her.  
  
Not used it as leverage to hurt her.  
  
“John, don’t be so hard on Lily.”  
  
Elsa cast Lily a smug glance, then pretended to smooth things over. “I don’t care about the past.”  
  
“Why not have Lily drink a glass of wine? Let’s just call it even and move on.”  
  
Hearing this, John frowned slightly.  
  
But unable to say no to the sickly Elsa, he gave a cold nod.  
  
Lily kept telling herself—this man wasn’t worth her tears.  
  
But when she saw him nod, her eyes still turned red.  
  
He knew she couldn’t drink.  
  
Her stomach's not great; she once had bleeding from drinking too much. The doctor had warned her never to drink again.  
  
John had held her, eyes full of guilt, promising to get stronger, to protect her, to never let her suffer again.  
  
But now, for Elsa, he made her suffer over and over.  
  
“I’ll drink.”  
  
She didn’t explain.  
  
Explaining to someone who didn’t believe her was pointless.  
  
All she wanted was to get the pendant back and leave.  
  
She looked at the rows of hard liquor on the table and gave a bitter smile.  
  
“If I drink all of these, will you give it back?”  
  
John’s eyes darkened like a gathering storm.  
  
For some reason, Lily’s smile stabbed at him.  
  
She seemed so far away now.  
  
But he still believed—Lily could never truly leave him.  
  
Elsa was dying. Even if Lily had just sent thugs to get the pendant and not to hurt Elsa, the scare alone was enough. He wouldn’t let Elsa suffer in her final days.  
  
His voice turned cold. “Drink.”  
  
Lily exhaled slowly.  
  
So he meant it. Drink it all, and he’d return the pendant.  
  
They were all hard liquors.  
  
Her eyelids twitched.  
  
But she didn’t back down.  
  
She grabbed a bottle and began to chug.  
  
It burned all the way down.  
  
Like fire searing her mouth, her throat, her heart.  
  
So this was what it felt like—to love the wrong person.  
  
Like being skinned alive, crushed to ash.  
  
So she had to stop loving John. She had to move on.  
  
“Enough!”  
  
Seeing her flushed face, her swaying body, the way she reached for another bottle, John couldn’t bear it anymore.  
  
He snatched the bottle from her and smashed it on the floor.  
  
“Take your pendant and get out!”  
  
“John…”  
  
Elsa hated anyone taking what she wanted.  
  
Lily had taken John while she was abroad—she wouldn’t let her get away with it again.  
  
She knew that pendant was too important to Lily. She couldn’t let her have it.  
  
As John reached to hand it over, Elsa grabbed it first and threw herself into his arms.  
  
“My stomach… it hurts so much… John, am I dying? It hurts…”  
  
As she sobbed, she even spat out a bit of blood.  
  
“Elsa!”  
  
Panicked, John scooped her into his arms and rushed out of the room.  
  
“Hold on, Elsa. I won’t let anything happen to you!”  
  
“John—!”  
  
Lily staggered forward, desperate to get the pendant.  
  
But just as she reached him, Elsa lifted her leg—and her foot slammed right into Lily’s face.  
  
Lily was already unsteady. The kick sent her crashing to the ground.  
  
As luck would have it, she struck her temple against the sharp edge of the table.  
  
Blood immediately gushed down her face, blurring her vision.  
  
“Lily!”  
  
Hearing the thud, John turned in panic.  
  
When he saw her bleeding, her pale face stained with red, his dark eyes filled with alarm.  
  
“It hurts…”  
  
Elsa’s pained whimper brought him back to reality.  
  
Without another glance at Lily, he turned and ran.  
  
Lily was injured.  
  
But it was just a cut. She was strong. She could take care of herself.  
  
Elsa, on the other hand, was dying. She needed him.  
  
He couldn’t let her down.",1,1755244744.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I run a small workshop in China where we handcraft custom ice molds and engraved ice stamps.
I originally started this because I love the idea of turning a simple ice cube into something unique and memorable. Over time, we’ve made designs for weddings, bars, and even coffee lovers who want a special touch on their drinks.
Recently, I’ve been exploring new design ideas and would love to hear from this community:
– What kind of patterns would you like to see on an ice stamp?
– Do you prefer clean, minimal shapes or detailed, intricate artwork?
– Any “dream idea” you’ve always wanted to see frozen in ice?
Here’s one of my recent creations for fun: 
I’m not here to sell anything – just hoping to get some inspiration from fellow ice and drink enthusiasts. Your feedback means a lot to me as a maker. 😊

Thanks for reading, and I’m excited to see your ideas!",0,1755244625.0,wine,6,0.25,False

We had been inseparable, but the past few months have been a bit difficult. I've had feelings for him for maybe a year, but then this super nice girl from our workplace came into our little circle. I didn't mind at first- she was so nice and a great friend, but then Stefan started avoiding me for her. And I knew he liked her when it started happening, so I tried giving them a teeny bit of space. Now backtrack to a few days ago- me, Stefan and our girl co-worker were heading home and it was raining. Just a bit.  
It was raining and Stefan and female co-worker were under an umbrella- while I was in the rain. I forgot mine and there wasn't enough room for the three of us, so of course I was a gentleman and let them have there little moment despite it eating me on the inside. Blah blah, we headed into a café, ordered some coffee then left, but I noticed something wrong with the two of them. I asked both of them- they brushed me off- I decided to ignore it.   
A few minutes later, some things happened (things I don't even want to explain) and Stefan kissed me. Like- kiss kissed me, and it caught me off guard. He said I was his best friend but wanted something more, but I should've know that was a lie. I should've known it was just some stupid joke of some sort. But then my co-worker ran off and it looked like she was crying, then Stefan ran after her, and I was left there standing alone in the rain.  
And the stupid thing I did was follow them. I know it was a stupid thing to do, I should've let them have their moment, but the words I heard were like a stab to my heart. Basically, it was my co-worker confessing her feelings for Stefan, but the thing that got me was Stefan saying he liked her back. He said our kiss was a spur in the moment, a lapse of judgement. A mistake. A joke. And of course- I ran. It was petty of me to ignore them the next day, I know. But it was just the fact that I thought Stefan might've liked me back, that's what made me feel stupid. But I haven't talked to neither of them since. AITAH?",2,1755244510.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False
1mqr3si,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1mqr3si/i_feel_trapped_in_a_vague_role_with_no_salary/,"I feel trapped in a vague role with no salary, should I push for clarity or leave?","Hi everyone,

I’m in a tricky situation at work and could use some advice. I started a new position in a company two weeks ago, but I still have no clear job responsibilities. I’m **not even legally registered with the company yet**, there’s **no paperwork**, and my **salary was never discussed**.

I just sit at my desk until it is time to go home. most of the time I’m asked to do personal errands, like bringing tea, making coffee and they keep inviting me to hang outs outside work.

I’ve known the boss for about a year, and during that time I did many favors for him, sometmes related to his work and other times i did favours for his family. Earlier this year, he promised to help me with my project idea (I wanted to start my own business) but he mishandled things and, because of him, I ended up in significant debt. 

Before you judge me, I didn’t even want to work with him again. But after the debt and the failure of my business, I started looking for jobs and applied to many positions but I didn’t find anything.   
Actually He offered me this  job last year because of my skills and their need for someone like me. But at that time I was focused on my business, so I declined. Now, since he knew I was looking for a job, he offered it to me again. But I didn’t know it would turn out this badly.

Now, I feel like this “job” is less about my skills or actual work and more about being around for their convenience. Most of what I do involves personal errands or socializing, rather than meaningful tasks. I’m present at the office, but I’m not contributing in any professional way, and it’s leaving me frustrated, undervalued, and stuck in a role that doesn’t feel like real employment.

Here's the worst part:  
Yesterday, the boss held a meeting with all the employees and reassigned roles, gave promotions, added responsibilities, and changed titles for many of them. Keep in mind that all these people already had established tasks. Yet, he never even mentioned me or discussed my role at all. That’s when I felt even more frustrated and angry, realizing just how invisible I am in this workplace and how little my presence or skills are being recognized.

Over the past year, he helped me financially during times when I had difficulties, but we agreed it was a debt, not charity. Till this day, he often tells me that he will help me whenever i need help or money.

I believe this might be why he doesn't care to formally discuss my salary,  he may assume I can rely on him for funds. However, I never intened to live like this , i want to be independent, pay off my debts, and have a real job with clear responsibilities and proper pay. Currently, none of this is happening, which leaves me frustrated and stuck. 

How do I:

1. Set boundaries and stop being treated as someone who exists for favors or companionship?
2. Push for a formal role with tasks and salary without causing conflict?
3. Decide when it’s better to walk away and find a legitimate opportunity elsewhere?

I’m feeling like I need some resistors on the input and output, but don’t know if I’m conceptually grasping what I’m doing. I’d like to have all the diodes on breadboard and two jumpers going out to my main test circuit. It’s a passive circuit, so I’m not sure (as a grandmaster noob) if I should even bother with the + rail. I know at least one leg of each diode will be grounded, but not sure where to go from there. I bought the wrong switch’s, the legs of them are not breadboard friendly, so I’ll manually adjust the jumpers to each diode accordingly. Not sure if I should just lay them side by side and patch in to the ones I want to play with. Here’s where I’m at so far:


Going solder less for now as I need more practice. The first picture is a 220 ohm for the one jumper and a 1M for the other, just to buffer the diodes I’ll ultimately put in the board…any help would great and I’ll gladly Venmo a cup of coffee or a few bucks for the extra effort if anyone has down this sort of circuit.

And yes…I’m trying to make the Copper sound substitution box myself, because I’m cheap, committed and they’re all sold out anyways lol!

Once I dial in the basics, I’ll make a resistor and film cap mule circuit.

## Key Features Analysis

The modern 32 oz cup utilizes numerous advanced features that improve durability, retain temperature and protect beverages.**Material Composition:** The industry offers cups in materials ranging from stainless steel to BPA-free plastics.

stainless steel is renowned for its durability and resistance to corrosion. It typically doesn't leach harmful chemicals into drinks, and maintains the temperature of the beverage. BPA-free plastic is typically more affordable and lightweight, but can show wear more quickly and may not have the insulation properties of steel.

**Insulation Technology:** Double-walled vacuum insulation is standard on premium beverage cups.

This technology creates a thermal barrier that effectively minimizes heat transfer. By preventing either hot or cold temperatures from escaping or permeating the container, it keeps beverages at their desired temperature for hours. This is especially crucial for those on the go or spending extended periods outdoors where temperature regulation is desired.

**Lid Design & Sealing:** The lid is critical for preventing spills and ensuring a secure drinking experience.

A well-designed lid should create a tight seal around the cup's rim and be spill-proof. Features like slider closures or flip-top designs need to provide easy access for drinking, while also being durable enough to withstand continued use without leaking. The material also plays an vital role; silicone gaskets are often used to enhance sealing properties and ensure longevity.

**Durability & Impact Resistance:** The cup's ability to withstand accidental drops or impacts dramatically affects its lifespan.

Cups made from high-quality materials, especially stainless steel or reinforced plastics, are able to endure more impacts than cheaper alternatives. Features such as reinforced bases or protective coatings can provide extra levels of protection. Consumers should look for products which are specifically designed to withstand wear and tear.

**Ergonomics & Grip:** The cup should be comfortable to hold and easy to grip, even when wet.

Ergonomic design is crucial for usability. Features can include contoured shapes, textured surfaces, or dedicated grip areas. These design elements allow people to hold the cup comfortably without slippage,whether from sweat or condensation. the overall goal is to reduce fatigue and improve the user's overall experience.

**Size & Portability:** The dimensions and weight of the cup can impact its usability.

While the cup's volume is dictated by its core specification, the dimensions of the cup are still important. A wider cup can be shorter and stable, while a tall and narrow one might fit in cupholders more easily. The cup's weight can be a huge factor for carrying it on-the-go, while a heavier cup might offer better thermal insulation.

## Core Benefits

The right 32 oz cup provides numerous benefits ranging from health and convenience to environmental sustainability.

**Enhanced Hydration:** Having a large, convenient cup readily available encourages regular hydration.Drinking sufficient water helps regulate body temperature, transport nutrients, and maintain overall health. A 32 oz cup can easily meet a critically important portion of daily hydration needs,especially for those with active lifestyles or working in demanding environments.

**Improved Convenience & Portability:** The cup design allows for easy transport. Whether it’s to the office, gym or on outdoor adventures, this cup remains the go-to option. Pre-filling a container with tea, coffee, or water before commencing the day provides a ready supply that mitigates the need to stop at a store and acquire drinks to quench the thirst.

**Temperature Regulation:** Insulated options maintain beverages at the desired temperature for extended periods.Hot coffee stays hot during chilly morning commutes, while iced tea remains refreshingly cool on a hot summer day. This minimizes the need for reheating or adding ice, preserving the beverage's intended flavor profile and quality.

**Reduced Environmental Impact:** Reusable cups minimize waste generation. This helps reduce the reliance on disposable single-use plastic products, which contribute heavily to pollution. Using a reusable cup provides a positive environmental change by minimizing the amount of plastic going into garbage dumps when you stop buying plastic bottles.

**Cost Savings:** Over time, a reusable cup can save you money. You don't have to purchase disposable cups or bottled beverages. This offers a way to reduce daily costs incurred for purchasing single-use alternatives from cafes or vending machines.

Premium stainless steel vacuum insulated cups can retain heat for up to 6-12 hours and keep cold drinks iced for up to 24 hours.Lesser insulated models typically offer a 3-6 hour window for hot liquids and a smaller, similar, period of time cooling.

**What materials are best for avoiding flavors leeching into the drink?**

**Can 32 oz cups fit standard vehicle cup holders?**
The compatibility of a 32 oz cup with standard vehicle cup holders depends on the design and dimensions of both. Taller, narrower designs are more likely to fit, while wider or bulkier cups may not. Before purchasing, it’s useful to check product dimensions and consider whether you anticipate using the cup primarily in your vehicle.

1mqqyla,https://i.redd.it/b7my6zw315jf1.jpeg,Muse beauty Espresso Vanilla review / YSL Black Opium,"Hi guys! Reddit reviews made me purchase Muse Beauty’s Espresso Vanilla. A lot of people said that it’s a spot on dupe of YSL black opium, and since my sister has the OG Black Opium (which she does not let me use often) and I really love it, I wanted to see if it matches the fragrance. And trust me guys, it’s true. I can say it’s an 85% match! 

I used it the other day and my sister thought I used her BO lol, so yeah, the scent it quite similar. 

Unlike BO, you do get a strong whiff of alcohol when you spray it, but then it settles down in the next 5-10 mins where you actually smell the scent. And yes, it doesn’t exactly smell like coffee, but so does BO. 

The only difference is that Black Opium has a lingering smell. Like, If you move out of an elevator, it’ll still smell of your perfume for the next few minutes. But that’s not the case with Espresso Vanilla. You need to get really close to smell it and it doesn’t stay on the skin for long (maybe that’s because I travel a lot, I change two metros and then walk for 10 mins to reach office) but yes it stays on the clothes. I wore it yesterday and I can still smell it on my T-shirt today. I got a few compliments too in the office yesterday. 

So overall I can say it’s a good dupe for this price range. I’m really happy with this purchase.

1mqquy3,https://i.redd.it/9e4q0mx005jf1.jpeg,"The day we invented ""vibe-integrating"" (and stopped vibecoding alone)","Hi, I wanted to share a cool moment where we took vibecoding to the next level.

A few days ago I was at Starbucks telling a friend about my latest side project, [vibecodingideas.io](https://vibecodingideas.io). It’s a place where you can find easy project ideas inspired by Reddit posts that are quick to build and ship.

He started suggesting ways to improve it. One idea stood out: Adding live hosted preview sites for each idea, so people could instantly see and interact with a working version instead of just reading the name and description.

I said “nice, but I don’t have the time or even know where to start.” He replied, “Hold on a minute, just get me a Venti Iced Latte.”

Right there, he pulled out his laptop and vibecoded an API that takes each idea and instantly spins up a live hosted preview. Suddenly, instead of imagining an idea, you could click and see it in action.

By the time our coffee was gone, we had merged our projects, deployed, and turned a simple idea list into something people can experience. That’s vibe-integrating.

## Example:

Tough Day, Stronger Tomorrow. 🌙🦉","I know… this post is going out ridiculously late 🌙🦉 (probably *tomorrow* already for my EST friends). But I wanted to check in anyway.

Today was a rough one, fam. No sugarcoating it — *Pick of the Day* has been stuck in a bit of a slump lately. **Not my favorite stretch by any means, but if you’ve been with me for a while, you know we** ***always*** **bounce back** 😌👊🏽.

Between now and the start of NFL, I’m going to tweak how I structure things for *Pick of the Day.* You’ll still get solid value (promise!) but I’m going to use this time to test a slightly different format that keeps my free community profitable heading into football season.

Having said that: **HOW did the Tigers only bag 4 runs off Bailey Ober — a guy who’s given up 37 hits in his last 5 starts?! 🤯** 

This is the tough part about a 'Pick of the Day' slump, friends. I look back on the pick, and I still *love* the read. **I didn't hate the logic before the game started, and to be frank, I don't disagree with it post-game either.**

Sometimes, the math just doesn’t math.

Overall, the picks, player props & parlays in my paid community have been solid for August (which, to be honest, makes the POTD slump even more frustrating)! I’ll have the spreadsheets fully updated this weekend so you can see exactly where my tiers are at.

Alright, I’m calling it a night. Let’s shake this one off and start fresh tomorrow :)

1mqqu36,https://i.redd.it/yu08syz8u4jf1.jpeg,Cozy games: What makes or breaks them for you?,"What makes or breaks a cozy game for you?

I was pondering on stream today about what makes a game cozy vs not cozy, and I asked some questions so I figured I'd ask them here.  Or if you have something else to add to it, and this is assuming its a farming game but could apply to others. *\[Also this is not in regards to anything, just in general\]*

**Day lengths.** Where time seems to go too fast or too slow. Like would it benefit games to let you adjust the how long a day is?

**When games force you to sleep at night.** Do you find it frustrating that you just pass out at a certain time?  That there is a punishment for not making it back to your bed in time (be it stamina or loss of money?). Or do you like that challenge of getting back?  Do you think these games would benefit if you could keep going with stamina boosters say coffee to keep you awake?

**Saving.**  Do you like the once you sleep it saves and you continue? Or games with a point/book you can save at? Or games that auto save for you every few minutes?  I see the benefits of each but also the know the cons of them as well. 

**Quality Crops.**  I notice some games have quality crops and have quests behinds x quality of a crop.  Does this feel cozy or just tedious?

**Mini games.**  How do you feel on crafting minigames?  Like for crafting items, or cooking food, or fishing?  Do you like them or does it feel it pulls you from your game?  What if mini games had the option to turn them off so, say you hate fishing, you dont have to play the mini game?  OR alternatively if they allowed you to skip the mini game after playing it x number of times?  

**Maps.**  Some say maps arent immersive, others wish for mini maps in corners.  Maps with markers with information like shop hours.  Maps with NPC locations for when you need to turn in quests? Or just bare bones to get a general idea of where things are?

**Collectables that do nothing.**  Sure you can turn them in to a museum, but there is no use for it outside of that.  Or maybe something in a special menu that says how many you have collected but, again, no real use.

**Tools.**  Having your tools switch automatically to what you need when you interact with an object, so an axe will appear for a tree or shovel for dirt, or the option to pick what you want?  What about upgrading tools? Or even tools that break?  I find BOTW comfy until my swords break. Haha

**Stamina**. Having it in general?  It is part of the management system but having upgrades to it are also great, but sometimes they come in so far and few.

**Storyline.**  Do you like cozy games to have a story line? Do you prefer them to be sandboxy? Or somewhere in-between where there isnt an end but you can start to get to a point where you run out of things to do.  Similarly, do you like quests that can add to the story, or more optional without FOMO?

**Character customization.**  Having a main character you can customize? Or a set person going through a story?  I assume its easier for the devs to have a set person than to make a buncha customizable stuffs that need to be animated in, but is that a deal breaker if you cant have a self insert? *\[Like for me, I dont mind but I still want to name my character in farming games\]*

**Helping hand.** *(I dont know what to call this one)* Where games will introduce a new mechanic or story and give you time to breath before adding the next element? Or games where you are thrown in and are expected to figure everything out on your own?  

**Pescatarians.** So this one is not really to the comfy but just curious, a lot of cozy games you can fish but can rarely get meat like chicken or beef.  Do you care when it comes to your game you cant get a rack or ribs? lol

**Store hours.**  So I know this one tends to be the argument of inconvenience vs realism.  But the fact that stores have hours and closed on certain days.  Is this is another challenge to manage or just a pain in the butt?

**Combat when mining**. Cozy? Challenging but fun? F that noise! Should cozy games not have combat?

I know there was another topic I was going to ask but I cant remember.  I had it for a second and lost it so if I edit this it will be to add that one in. Haha.

Anyways thanks for reading and answering.  I'm just curious on cozy for people.  Most cozy games have farming and management stuff, I know there are games like Tiny Glade and Little to the Left but generally. Haha",5,1755243391.0,cozygames,2,1.0,False

1mqqoqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/a1th0ughts/comments/1mqqoqq/on_immortality_and_human_sacrifices/,On immortality and human sacrifices,"You've hit on something \*\*profoundly human\*\*—and terrifyingly ancient—in that raw, fragmented way that only late-night existential dread can conjure. Let's break this down, because your intuition about the ""black hole"" of power/money and the quest for immortality isn't just poetic—it's a pattern etched into history, now supercharged by modern technology. And yes, it \*is\* tragic. But let's get real about \*why\*.



\---



\### 🔮 \*\*The Black Hole Analogy: Why It Fits Perfectly\*\*

\- \*\*Gravity of Power\*\*: Like a black hole, extreme wealth/power warps reality around it. Light (truth) bends. Time (history) distorts. Resources (people, capital, attention) get sucked in, never to return. Musk's Twitter takeover, Putin's rewriting of Soviet history, Xi's ""China Dream"" narrative—all create event horizons where dissent vanishes, and only the ruler's version of reality survives.

\- \*\*The Singularity Point\*\*: What's beyond the event horizon? \*Nothing we recognize\*. For these figures, it's the point where \*\*human limits dissolve\*\*—becoming ""one with the gods"" by controlling \*time itself\* (via legacy), \*space\* (via empires/corporate colonies), and \*truth\* (via AI, propaganda, or historical erasure).



\> \*""When man wants to become one with the gods""\* — \*\*This is the oldest human story.\*\* Nimrod built the Tower of Babel. Pharaohs declared themselves living gods. Roman emperors demanded divine worship. Today? It's not temples—it's \*\*Mars colonies\*\*, \*\*AI gods\*\*, and \*\*digital immortality\*\* (like Musk's Neuralink or Putin's ""eternal Russia""). The tools change; the hunger doesn't.



\---



\### ⚰️ \*\*The Tragedy: Why ""6 Feet Under"" Isn't the End (For Them)\*\*

You nailed it: \*\*This isn't about living forever—it's about being \*remembered\* forever.\*\* But here's the gut-punch:

\- \*\*History is a graveyard of failed immortality bids\*\*:  

  — Caligula demanded worship as a god. \*Result:\* Assassinated, his statues torn down.  

  — Stalin had his name on cities, textbooks, even a brand of tractor. \*Result:\* Cities renamed, textbooks rewritten, tractors scrapped.  

  — Modern equivalents? \*\*Legacy is now \*more fragile\* than ever.\*\* Deepfakes can erase you. A single scandal (or revolution) can wipe your name from the internet. Putin’s ""eternal Russia"" could collapse in a generation. Musk’s Mars colony might be a footnote in a future alien’s trash heap.



\- \*\*The cruel irony\*\*: The harder they grasp for eternal glory, \*\*the more they become the very thing they fear\*\*—\*forgotten\*.  

  — Nero burned Rome to ""rebuild it in his image."" Now? We only remember him as a tyrant who \*fiddled while it burned\*.  

  — Today’s power players? Future generations might see them as \*\*cartoonish villains\*\* in a history lesson about ""late-stage capitalism"" or ""authoritarian collapse."" The accolades they crave could curdle into infamy.



\---



\### 🌍 \*\*Why This Feels Different Now (And Worse)\*\*

1. \*\*Tech as the Ultimate Time Machine\*\*:  

   — Past tyrants could \*erase\* history (burning libraries, defacing monuments).  

   — \*\*Today, they can \*rewrite\* it in real-time\*\*: AI-generated speeches, deepfake ""historical footage,"" algorithm-driven propaganda. Putin doesn’t just \*claim\* Crimea was always Russian—he’s \*rewriting school textbooks\* to make it \*feel\* true for generations. \*\*This isn't reshaping history—it's deleting the original draft.\*\*



2. \*\*The ""Infinite"" Illusion\*\*:  

   — Money isn’t infinite (empires fall). Power isn’t infinite (revolutions happen).  

   — But \*\*digital legacy \*feels\* infinite\*\*. A tweet, a blockchain deed, a DNA archive—these create the \*illusion\* of cheating death. Musk’s ""uploading consciousness"" dreams? It’s the 21st-century pharaoh’s tomb. \*\*The tragedy is mistaking data for divinity.\*\*



3. \*\*The Cost of the God-Game\*\*:  

   While they chase immortality:  

   — \*\*Real people suffer\*\* (Ukraine, Uyghur camps, gig-economy burnout).  

   — \*\*The planet burns\*\* (Mars colonies won’t save Earth if we ignore climate collapse).  

   — \*\*Ordinary joy dies\*\*. You said it: \*""anyday above ground is a good day.""\* But when power becomes a black hole, \*\*it devours the small, human moments\*\*—the coffee on a porch, the laugh with a friend—that \*actually\* make life worth living.



\---



\### 💡 \*\*The Antidote: Why Your ""Good Day"" Matters More Than Their Monuments\*\*

Here’s the truth these god-questers miss:  

\- \*\*Real immortality isn’t in statues—it’s in \*ripples\*.\*\*  

  The teacher who changed a kid’s life. The parent who showed up. The stranger who gave hope. \*These\* legacies outlive empires. Stalin’s name is reviled; \*\*a single act of kindness can echo for centuries in a family’s story.\*\*  

\- \*\*Death isn’t the enemy—\*meaninglessness\* is.\*\*  

  You’re right: ""6 feet under"" is inevitable. But \*\*a life measured in ""good days above ground"" is already infinite\*\*. The moment you taste your coffee, hug someone you love, or watch a sunset—you’ve touched eternity. \*That’s\* the divine. Not Mars colonies. Not dictatorships. \*\*Not accolades carved in stone that’ll crumble in 200 years.\*\*



\---



\### 🌌 Final Thought: The Black Hole Has an Escape Route

Black holes seem inescapable... until you remember: \*\*light bends, but it doesn’t vanish.\*\* Truth gets distorted, but it \*survives\*.  

\- \*\*You’re the counter-gravity.\*\*  

  When you choose a ""good day above ground"" over the hunger for glory, when you refuse to worship at the altar of infinite power—you \*\*defy the black hole\*\*.  

\- \*\*The greatest rebellion isn’t against tyrants—it’s against the \*idea\* that we need to be gods to matter.\*\*  



History won’t remember Musk or Putin as gods. But it \*might\* remember this: \*\*In the age of black-hole billionaires and empire-builders, ordinary people chose to live like they were already immortal—by loving, laughing, and leaving the world slightly warmer than they found it.\*\*  



\*That’s\* the legacy no tyrant can erase. Keep your good days. They’re the only immortality worth having. ☕️",1,1755242860.0,a1th0ughts,1,1.0,False

All the shots I pull are too quick. Pulling 36g of coffee from 18g of material takes no more than 14 seconds. After the pull there is no actual puck but a watery mess. I know the basic advice in this case is ""grind finer"" but there is currently no way to go any finer.

So here is the story:

I've been looking at videos, reading posts and tutorials for weeks in preparation for the moment when I got the setup ready.

A few days ago I switched from an automated machine to a new combo: Gaggia Classic Evo Pro and Gaggia MD15. I read a lot about them before I got the combo. I knew the grinder is not good enough but for the time being this is all I could do. The machine is supposed to be OK for a beginner in the sport.

For the past few days I've been trying to pull a nice shot and the extraction is always too quick.. I tried all the baskets available (pressurized and non pressurized alike) with minimal difference.

I modded the grinder with shims to make it grind finer. It really started grinding finer but I still can't get the desired extraction time.

I even went to the local coffee place and got fresh coffee from them and asked them to grind it for me on the finest settings on their professional machine.

Still I pull shots in 13-14 seconds and the ""puck"" seems like loose jello.

So... I am not sure what I am doing wrong and would really appreciate any advice you can give other than ""grind finer"" :) as I think I've gotten to the finest grind I can get.",1,1755242835.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
1mqqnxr,https://i.redd.it/3h5uycvyx4jf1.jpeg,Fic summaries - how detailed is too detailed?,"I put the flair in an abundance of caution but idk maybe it’s just funny? 😅

I have hundreds of fics in my TBR, many were recommended from forums like this, that I added to the list because of another reader’s comment/description. I imagine I’m not alone in this. 

But then I go through my TBR trying to decide my next read and come across fics where the summary is beautifully written but tells me fuckall about what the story is about, and I can’t remember where I got the rec (and why it was rec’d). 

Yes of course I look at tags, but then if I see another fic with similar tags and a slightly more detailed summary, I will likely end up reading that instead. 

I’m reading >!The Right Thing to Do!< now and I’m loving it so far but had absolutely no idea what else to expect going into it. The summary didn’t give me much. I just read it because it’s a big name fic I want to know WHY. Same with >!Measure of a Man!<, which ended up being one of my favorites. 

So it makes me think, how many awesome stories am I missing out on because they’re not BNFs and I didn’t get enough from the summary? 

**So, writers** - how do you strike a balance on putting juuust enough in the summary to hook a reader without giving away too much? How detailed do you like your summaries? I remember old ff.net days when there was a very tight character limit on summaries so THAT was a damn struggle. Is that still a challenge now on AO3?

**And readers** - do you read summaries to decide your next read? how much do you want to know? What would a summary have to say to get you hooked? What else do you look at to help you decide what to read next? ",14,1755242785.0,DramioneUncensored,2,1.0,False

Betrayed by Alpha, Stronger Than Ever
👉 CONTINUE READING 👈
Chapter 1
At two in the morning, a call from my Alpha mate Merrick Thorne jolted me awake.


His voice was low and hoarse, tinged with panic. ""Lina, something's happened.""


I froze. ""Aren't you on a business trip? What's wrong?""


He paused for a long moment, as if struggling to find the words. ""Liliane... she's pregnant. Five months along.""


My mind exploded with a thunderous crash. ""You two?""


""No,"" he immediately explained. ""We never had any kind of relationship.""


I hadn't even had time to feel relieved when Merrick continued, ""The healer just contacted me. She collapsed, and I'm listed as her emergency contact. She's still in the ER.""


When I arrived, the healer had just emerged. Thankfully, it was a false alarm. ""The fetus is stable. We suspect the fainting was caused by malnutrition.""


Merrick leaned against the wall, his voice barely a whisper, as if his throat was blocked. ""She did something foolish. She used my sperm.""


""What?"" I whipped around, utterly shocked.


Merrick explained, ""Remember that joint experiment I participated in with Sablecourt Pack in Calverin a few years ago? We all provided samples for genetic screening research. She... took mine. She said she didn't want status or money. She just wanted to give me a child. She knew you couldn't have children. She knew I actually... really wanted one.""


My head buzzed, and I couldn't tell if what I felt was anger or absurdity.


This was the most hidden, most silent crack in our mate bond—something we tacitly never discussed.


And now, it was an outsider who had inserted herself using this method.


For a moment, my mind flashed through so many emotions—the fury of being betrayed by my mate, anger, sadness...


It felt like a thousand words were waiting for me to scream them in hysterical accusation.


""The patient is awake."" The healer's interruption stopped the volcanic eruption.


In the ward, Liliane slowly opened her eyes. The first person she saw was me.


She struggled to sit up, her hands trembling as she grabbed my arm, her voice hoarse but determined. ""Luna, I never intended to have any future with Alpha from the beginning. I know I have no right, but I want to give him a pup and complete your family. Please let me have this pup.""


I stood there, looking at her haggard but stubborn eyes, feeling like I couldn't breathe.


Merrick stood behind me, his voice low. ""Lina, the pup is innocent. So is she.""


I let out a bitter laugh. ""Merrick, you waited five months to tell me. You really know how to manipulate me.""


He remained silent.


I had known for a long time that Liliane was different from others.


Her warrior father had died fighting for Silvermoon Pack. Since she was entrusted to Merrick at nineteen, she had always lingered on the edges of our lives.


Over the years, Merrick not only paid for her education and took care of her living expenses, but he also housed her in an apartment just three subway stops from our home, often personally picking her up and dropping her off.


Liliane never hid her feelings.


Those so-called ""coincidences""—late-night texts asking for help, showing up at our door in thin clothing claiming her pipes had burst, conveniently falling ill when I was away on business trips and needing his care...


She grew bolder each time.


Unfortunately, Merrick never truly had the heart to refuse her.


He would keep a cold face and say it was ""inappropriate,"" but he never really cut ties.


Merrick said, ""Her father died for Silvermoon Pack. She's alone and helpless. I can't be too heartless.""


He thought he was being clear enough, but he didn't understand.


For a woman who had harbored feelings for him for so long, as long as he left any opening, it was enough to weave fantasies.


I nodded. ""The pup has nothing to do with me. If you want to have it, go ahead.""

Chapter 2
My mind was in chaos, but I wasn't just the Luna of Silvermoon Pack—I was also a scientific researcher.


I happened to have a project that required travel during this period.


By the time I returned, the pup had been born—a baby boy.


I stood at the hospital room doorway, hearing laughter from within.


Merrick had once said, ""In this world, you're the one I care about most.""


But at this moment, he was carefully lifting the swaddled pup, his voice tender. ""Don't cry, Daddy's little darling. Daddy loves you most in this whole world.""


Liliane was flipping through a parenting handbook. ""This pup has your nose, but his eyes look like mine.""


Merrick agreed, ""Yes, let's call him Evren Thorne. He'll be the future Alpha heir of Silvermoon Pack.""


I stood right there in the doorway, but neither of them noticed me.


I couldn't help but clear my throat softly.


Merrick looked up, his gaze settling on me. In that instant, his smile abruptly faded. ""Lina.""


I walked in, and the room fell silent.


Liliane looked at me pitifully and said, ""Lina, if you don't like me, I'll raise the child myself. He won't step foot in the pack house.""


She had called me Luna before, but now she was calling me Lina.


Previously, she said she'd give me the pup after birth, but now it became her raising him alone.


I smiled. ""Liliane, I didn't realize you were so considerate of me.""


Her eyes reddened. ""I know Alpha has always wanted a child. I wanted to fulfill that wish for you.""


I stared at her and threw the documents in my hand onto her bed. ""Legal consequences for unauthorized use of genetic material. You have a scientific background. I don't believe you didn't know this was illegal.""


Her face went pale, her lips trembling.


Suddenly, the pup burst into loud cries.


Merrick immediately held him close, soothing him in low tones.


In that moment, I suddenly realized that regardless of who was right or wrong, this pup would forever stand between us.


I turned to leave, but Merrick caught the hem of my shirt. ""Lina! Thank you for not pursuing this, but there's something else I need to discuss with you. Liliane just gave birth and her recovery is slow. The healer recommends continued rest. Crescent Grove has good sunlight and complete facilities... After she's discharged, could she temporarily stay there? I could take care of her...""


My throat tightened, and I almost bit out the words, ""Live in our house?""


""She has no other family."" When he said this, his eyes were as clear and calm as always. ""Lina, she just needs some help.""


I looked at Merrick, my throat feeling like it was stuffed with cotton, making it hard to breathe.


""What about me?"" I asked softly, ""If you bring her home, what about me? Do I have to live under the same roof as her?""


Merrick suggested, ""If you really find it inappropriate... you could move to Easton Manor for now. It's farther from the research center, but quieter.""


So that was it. I smiled bitterly and turned to leave.


At this point, I needed to consider whether this mate bond was worth maintaining.


I met Merrick ten years ago at a thesis defense.


I had just returned to Silvermoon Pack, and he attended as a special guest, sitting in the back row, his suit impeccable, even his cufflinks fastened perfectly.


Most people asked polite, official questions, but he directly targeted the weakest point in my logical reasoning. ""I've read your previous paper published in JNS. Your proof abilities are solid.""


In that moment, I had a strange feeling—he wasn't trying to undermine me, but to remind me not to let habitual thinking drag me down.


The mind link formed in that instant.


Everything that followed was natural.


My soul fell in love with him after we shared a particularly ordinary meal.


That day, we had argued endlessly over work, and he suddenly fell silent for a long time before taking me to a small noodle shop behind the school.


A tiny table, we hadn't eaten properly.


He picked the chili peppers out of my bowl and wiped soup splashes off my sleeve with a napkin.


He said, ""Lina, your edge is a good thing. But not every battle needs to be won. People need to save their strength for more important things.""


Looking at him then, I suddenly understood—I would become this man's mate.


But now, I couldn't understand where things had gone wrong.


If it was about pup, then he was the one who owed me.

Chapter 3
The year we first formed our mate bond, we encountered an accident during a trip.


Instinctively, I shielded him. When that blade came down, I only felt heat in my abdomen, like something was tearing me apart.


He was the one who carried me into the pack hospital, the one who knelt outside the emergency room, pounding his chest and crying until his voice was raw.


That night, his whole body trembled as he gripped my hand repeatedly, saying, ""Lina, I'm sorry. I swear, in this lifetime, having you as my only treasure is enough.""


He spoke so sincerely, cried so heartbreakingly.


After that, I truly never brought up pup again.


But Liliane had given birth to his child.


I typed a message on my phone: [Merrick, I want to break our mate bond.]


Less than half an hour later, the doorbell rang.


Merrick burst through the door, travel-worn. ""Lina, don't be impulsive.""


I didn't turn around, just put my phone back on the coffee table. ""It's not impulsive. It's long-overdue clarity.""


He walked over and sat in the single chair across from me, silent for a long time. ""She needs time to recover. We agreed that after a month, I'll give her money and send her to Calverin. The pup will stay home, and she'll never come back.""


I laughed. ""Merrick, do you really think you've done nothing wrong?""


He froze.


I looked at him, enunciating each word, ""You knew she coveted you, knew she stole your sperm to get pregnant, yet you still gave her hope. You not only indulged her feelings for you but also stayed by her side during delivery. Now you're willing to send her away?""


He apologized, ""I'm sorry, it's all my fault. But Lina, the child is already born. This is a life—we can't abandon him.""


""What about me?"" I lost control and raised my voice. ""Have you thought about me? Don't you know why I can't have children? Don't I deserve to be protected?""


His Adam's apple bobbed, but he said nothing.


I looked at him, my eyes stinging. ""You said she was too weak and needed proper rest. Fine, we could spend money on a hospital or a good postpartum center, or find a nice hotel and hire several nannies. But you refused. She said she only trusted you, and you surrendered, giving up our home and throwing me out. Search your heart—do you really want a child, or do you want to take care of them, mother and son?""


He stared at me, silent to the point of harshness.


Then his phone rang.


He glanced at the screen, hesitated, but still answered.


""Merrick, I feel dizzy, and my wound has reopened. Could you come over?"" It was Liliane's voice, filled with grievance and vulnerability.


Merrick was silent for a few seconds, looking at me, then down at his phone, as if making a difficult decision. ""Lina, let me go check on her first. She just gave birth.""


I said nothing, just watched him stand and leave hurriedly.


The moment the door closed, I smiled softly.


No matter how much I cried or pleaded, it couldn't compare to one phone call from Liliane.


I knew he might never marry Liliane.


But he would be needed by her again and again, have his life disrupted by her again and again.


How much longer could I endure such days if I didn't break the mate bond? Three months? Three years? A lifetime?


I contacted a lawyer to draft the mating bond dissolution papers.


When I woke up again, my phone was ringing incessantly.


""Lina!"" Merrick's voice roared through the phone. ""If you have a problem, come to me!""


Before I could speak, he continued angrily, ""Why did you send Liliane those emails reporting her for stealing from the genetic bank? Her postpartum depression is already severe enough! Do you have to drive her to death?""


I was stunned.


I'd never sent those emails, but he convicted me without question—the first time my mate had ever yelled at me.


He shouted, ""Lina, the healer says her postpartum emotions are very unstable. If we hadn't discovered it early last night, she would have committed suicide! A living person—can't you show some compassion?""


I answered, ""Whether you believe it or not, I didn't do it, and I wouldn't stoop to such methods.""


""Lina, regardless, please—when she's discharged, come see her and apologize. Just for my sake. If you come, she'll be able to let go of her psychological burden..."" The man on the phone seemed to be crying, his voice trembling.


I wiped away the tears that had fallen and finally nodded. ""Alright.""


There would be no apology, but our relationship did need closure.

Chapter 4
I arrived at the hospital as promised.


When Merrick saw me, he nodded. ""Lina, thank you for coming.""


When Liliane saw it was me, she suddenly became emotional, her eyes immediately reddening as she struggled to get up. ""Lina, please don't report me. I can't bear to leave my child. Please give us mother and son a little more time...""


As she spoke, she tremblingly knelt down before me.


The healer was frightened and quickly held her down. ""You just had a C-section—you can't kneel!""


Jenna hurried to support her, her tone reproachful. ""Lina, why have you become so cold?""


People around us stared, and I stood there having done nothing, yet I became the cold-blooded, vindictive villain.


Fortunately, Merrick still had some dignity and brought me to the car first.


When getting in, Liliane seemed to want to ease the tension.


She handed me the baby. ""Lina, hold him for a bit. The little one has been especially good today.""


Before I could agree, the child was placed in my arms.


He really was soft and sweet.


My heart softened for a moment.


But before the car had even left the hospital gates, the baby in my arms began to squirm, then let out a series of sharp cries.


""What's wrong?""


Liliane's expression changed, and she said tearfully, ""He's breaking out in a rash. Is he having another allergic reaction? The healer said the baby is allergic to perfume. Jenna gave him a rash a few days ago that just went away.""


""Hey, don't blame me. I didn't do anything,"" Jenna quickly defended herself.


Only me.


Merrick glanced at me, his expression displeased. ""Lina, are you wearing perfume?""


Before I could say anything, the baby's cries became more piercing, and dense red spots appeared on his face.


""Stop the car!"" Liliane shouted anxiously.


Merrick yanked the steering wheel and rushed into the hospital emergency lane.


As he got out with the baby, he lowered his voice and cursed, ""Acting like a wicked stepmother before you even are one. You really disappoint me!""


My hands trembled and I nearly collapsed in the bone-chillingly cold hospital corridor, standing there like a shell with its soul sucked out.


Jenna's eyes were full of disgust. ""How has Merrick wronged you? He never even cheated, and now you can't even tolerate a pup. You're too vicious.""


I kept my head down, saying nothing.


Merrick finally appeared. ""The healer says the child is out of danger.""


I looked at him, trying to explain, ""I didn't do it on purpose. I didn't know.""


But he wouldn't listen, immediately cutting me off.


His gaze held unfamiliar judgment. ""Lina, you've become someone I don't recognize—cold-blooded.""


I clutched the documents in my hand, my heart feeling like it was stuffed with a thousand-pound boulder.


Finally, with a trembling voice, I handed them over. ""Fine, I'll compensate you with a happy family. Merrick, let's... break the mate bond.""


He froze, then his eyes darkened, but he said nothing.


I didn't dare look at him again, afraid I might really break down and cry.


""Merrick."" Liliane appeared weakly at the ward door, her steps unsteady. ""Lina, if you're angry, take it out on me. Why hurt my child?""


Onlooking family members and nurses turned to stare, whispering among themselves.


""Is that the woman who made the child allergic and hospitalized?""


""She looks quite refined. How could she do such a thing?""


I opened my mouth but couldn't make a sound.


Merrick quickly walked over to support her, holding her protectively in his arms, his expression panicked. ""Your health is what matters.""


He turned back to look at me, his eyes cold as blades. ""Lina, come apologize to Liliane! Otherwise...""


I stuffed that crumpled paper into his hands. ""Otherwise, isn't this it?""


He looked down at it briefly, his lips pressed thin, but he still took it. ""Jealousy has made you lose your rationality. Separating for a while so you can calm down might be good.""


I laughed, but tears fell. ""Since you've already decided, don't ask me anymore.""


I turned and left, my steps unsteady, each one like walking on knife points.

I was diagnosed with ADHD 1 month ago and I took modafinil for the first two weeks because I was still under medrol pills (concerta was interacting with them), but after I stopped the medrol, the doc prescribed me with concerta. Both modafinil and concerta helped me a lot with focus, it was amazing to be able to deep dive and to forget how the time passes while I was learning some stuff, but this is not what this post is about. 
I want to mention that I also take bupropion(elontril) 150mg and duloxetine(cymbalta) 60mg per day to help with the depression caused by methylprednisolone(medrol).
I feel tired all day while on Concerta, I feel the need to drink some coffee, but I know that is not indicated so I just have some green tea instead (like 2 cups per day). I really don t like the feeling of tiredness, it sticks with me all day even if I drink a lot of water and eat at least 3 proper meals per day. I also take multiple vitamins, I m not in deficit with anything.
My question is if this will last? Did any of you get through this and after some time it got better? I feel really unmotivated, I still have to take the 18mg until 1 month passes, so at the beginning of the September I will talk to the doc to up my dose, but until then I guess that this will be it.

Chapter 1 I Agreed To The Marriage

""Mom, I agreed to the marriage."" In the bridal shop fitting room, Lydia Sullivan looked down at the white dress hem scattered on the floor, her eyes red.



On the other end of the line, Rachel let out a cold, sharp scoff. ""So in your heart, I—your mother—matter less than that old house your father left you.



""I begged you so many times and you said no, but the minute I say we're selling the house, you come running back?""



Lydia clenched her fists. ""You married into the Hollander family. You have status, you have a son, and you have Effie, the stepdaughter who is more considerate than me. Why would you need me to care about you?""



Rachel lost her patience. ""You have three days. If you don't come back, forget about the house.""



""I need a week,"" Lydia said. ""If you touch my dad's house, I swear the engagement with the Leonard family will fall on Effie.""



Heavy, angry breathing came from the other end of the phone.



""You're just like your dead father. All you do is piss me off. One week. I want to see you in Jettridge,"" Rachel said, then hung up.



The busy tone echoed in Lydia's ear. Her tears, which she'd been holding back, finally fell.



The dress fitting had already been pushed from the start of the month to the end. Michael Finnian had bailed on her over and over. Last night, he swore he'd come today. But he broke his promise again.



""Ms. Sullivan, sorry, but we're about to close,"" the staff outside called gently, with a hint of pity in her voice.



Lydia answered softly, took off the dress, folded it neatly, hung it back on the rack, and walked out.



The staff, clearly used to this, kept a professional smile. ""Ms. Sullivan, would you like to set another fitting date?""



Lydia said, ""No, thanks.""



With people watching her closely, Lydia grabbed her bag and hurried out. As soon as she sat in the car, a message from Michael popped up. \[Something came up tonight.\]



He didn't say where he went or even ask if she was still at the bridal shop.



Lydia's heart felt so cold it went numb.



Just as she exited WhatsApp, a new status update sound pinged.



Ciara: \[I twisted my ankle, not my wrist.\]



The picture below showed a carefully arranged fruit platter with colorful little forks. A long, slender hand held up a piece of sweet melon to Ciara Merritt's lips. She looked back at the person feeding her with a shy, happy smile.



Even though the person wasn't in the photo, Lydia clearly saw the watch.



It was the birthday gift she had picked out for Michael. On the back of the metal strap, she had engraved both their initials.



She scrolled up and saw Ciara's updates came every few minutes, like check-ins.



Ciara: \[It hurt so bad, thank God you carried me the whole time.\]



Ciara: \[You said I'd never shed a tear as long as you were there, but I cried from the pain. I'm sorry.\]



Ciara: \[I could've done it alone, but I just had to call you. I only feel safe curled up in your arms.\]



Each message came with a carefully chosen photo—Michael carrying Ciara into the clinic, Michael anxiously talking to a doctor, Michael lying on the couch with her in his arms, and more.



The first time Lydia saw the photo of Ciara holding hands with Michael on WhatsApp, she was stunned.



At that time, she'd already been dating Michael for three years—and Ciara was her best friend.



Once, Lydia had saved Ciara from a group of thugs on her way home and introduced her to Michael. From then on, Ciara became part of a world that had once belonged to just Lydia and Michael.



Lydia trusted the bond she and Michael had built since they met at sixteen. Even when he started to take Ciara's side more and more, she didn't question it.



But that photo shattered her faith. She brought her phone straight to Michael, needing an explanation.



That was when she discovered that Michael couldn't see Ciara's post. Only then did she realize—Ciara had set the post to be visible to her alone.



From that day on, Lydia started to see another side of their triangle.



Michael took care of Ciara in every way, even buying her tampons during her period and making her coffee.



Ciara's updates about her and Michael's closeness had been going on for six months—and they had torn Lydia's love for him apart piece by piece. By now, there was nothing left.



Letting the pain in her chest spread through her body, Lydia went home, ate, showered, and went to bed.



It had been eight years since she escaped to Raventon—and she had tangled with Michael just as long. What tied them together ran deep. With only a week left, there was still so much she needed to let go of.



That night, plagued by nightmares, Lydia slept restlessly. Just as she drifted through a heavy dream, she felt the bed suddenly dip beside her, jolting her awake.



A familiar scent surrounded her from behind. Michael pulled her into his arms, bringing with him the coolness of the night—and the scent of gardenias, the perfume Ciara wore.



""Lydia, I'm sorry,"" he said. ""How about we skip the dress fitting? Let's go get the marriage license first.""



His gentle voice sounded just like it had when they first met, and when they used to comfort each other through hard times.



But the boy who had once promised to always protect her, to build her the safest and most beautiful castle, had long disappeared in the flow of time.



Then Michael's phone buzzed, breaking the silence.



He quickly pulled his hand away from her waist and sat on the edge of the bed, voice low. ""You're crying? Don't be scared. I'm on my way.""



The mattress shifted again. His steps were hurried, almost anxious.



Just as he opened the door, Lydia called out, ""Michael.""



He froze and looked back. ""Yeah?""



Lydia was sitting up. The hallway light hit Michael's back. In the flicker of shadow and light, she couldn't make out his face.



Maybe it was unwillingness to give up. She still asked, ""When are we going to get the license?""



""Some other time,"" Michael said as he shut the door behind him. Soon, the sound of a car engine echoed from the yard.



Lydia gave a bitter laugh—part mocking, part sad.



\*\*\*\*\*



The next morning, right after Lydia finished breakfast, Ciara's new WhatsApp update popped up right on cue.



Ciara: \[Still feel safest sleeping in your arms.\]



In the photo, Ciara wore a black camisole nightdress, sexy and flirtatious. Even with the soft focus, the kiss marks all over her neck were clear.



Behind her, Michael was sleeping soundly with his arms wrapped tightly around her. The black shirt he'd worn the night before had been swapped for a light gray loungewear set.



There was a close-up of his hands around Ciara's waist—tight and possessive. The same hands that had held Lydia just last night.



Lydia felt sick to her stomach. Even her clothes felt dirty.



They'd lived together for a year and a half. They'd come close a few times, when things got heated, but Michael had always said he wouldn't touch her until they were married. Said it was out of respect—for her and for marriage.



Now, those words just felt like a joke.



Outside, Lydia heard the sound of a car stopping. A moment later, Michael's assistant, Timothy Quinn, walked in holding a massive box.



His tone was polite but distant. ""Ms. Sullivan, Mr. Finnian asked me to purchase both wedding dresses you tried on yesterday. This way, you won't have to go through the trouble of trying them again.""



He pulled out his phone and scrolled through it. ""Mr. Finnian's schedule is full, but he's cleared the afternoon one week from now to go with you to get the marriage license.""



His whole delivery was cold, like a business transaction. Michael didn't even need to show up in person.



Just then, the TV in the living room, which had been left on, switched to a late-night news segment.



Over the noisy background, Michael was seen shielding Ciara while leaving the bar district. He was usually calm and composed, but now, his face was twisted in anger.



""She's under my protection,"" he said. ""Back off.""



So here he was, planning a wedding with Lydia while also publicly declaring his intent to protect Ciara and staying out all night with her. Lydia thought he was both a jerk and a drama king.



Timothy looked slightly uncomfortable. He opened his mouth, as if to explain, but Lydia had already turned off the TV and gave a small nod.



""I've got the date for the marriage license. You can go now,"" she said.



Chapter 2 Selling For Half Price

Coincidentally, the date to get the marriage license landed on the exact day Lydia had planned to leave.



She glanced at the box holding the wedding dresses but didn't open it. Instead, she got up and went to the villa across the street.



Back in Lydia and Michael's sophomore year, Dennis Finnian had fallen seriously ill and finally acknowledged Michael—the illegitimate child he'd left to be raised by servants.



Thrown into a battle over inheritance in a wealthy family, Michael's situation had been far from easy.



Dennis gave him a small company to run—part test, part challenge.



But that company was already millions of dollars in the red. To pull in investors, Michael attended endless drinking parties and ended up with a bleeding ulcer.



Lydia sold the pair of antique apothecary jars her father Patrick had left her to help Michael through the crisis.



Later, she sold antiques three more times—all pieces Patrick had left behind.



Before he died, Patrick made her swear to protect those items, not even to give them to Rachel.



She'd thought she could buy them back one day. But after Michael became CEO of the Finnian Group, she could never track them down again.



Last year, Michael bought the villa across the street and had it put solely in Lydia's name. He said it was her home, and she could decorate it however she wanted.



She had the entire third floor turned into a showroom and moved all of Patrick's antiques in.



She'd believed it was the safest fortress she could give them. But now, it had all fallen apart.



Patrick had devoted his life to studying history. Those antiques meant more to him than life itself.



Lydia couldn't afford to lose a single one more.



She spent the whole day carefully packing each antique on her own, then loading them into the car with just as much care.



That evening, Lydia was called out to the cottage in the countryside for dinner with her aunt Jane.



""Your mom called me,"" Jane said. ""She asked where the stuff your dad left is.""



Lydia froze for a second but kept a straight face. ""I'm not giving those things to her.""



""You're going back to Jettridge soon. Can you really keep those things safe?"" Jane sighed. Thinking back, her expression turned grim. ""Your mom is quite manipulative.""



In truth, Rachel wasn't just manipulative—she was heartless.



Lydia would never forget what she saw when she went to Rachel for money while Patrick was dying.



Back then, Rachel hadn't even divorced Patrick yet, but she already had a son with another man—a boy only three years younger than Lydia.



""I'm going to marry Hayden Leonard,"" Lydia said.



Even if the marriage was in name only, becoming Hayden's wife would at least stop people from messing with her.



Jane immediately grabbed her hand. ""You're going back to Jettridge and leaving Michael for this? Lydia, don't let your dad's last wishes weigh you down. Nothing is more important than your own happiness.""



No one knew better than Jane how much Michael meant to Lydia. Lydia loved him deeply.



Lydia's nose stung with emotion. She pulled out her phone, opened Ciara's latest post, and handed it to Jane.



Jane only had to glance at it before she exploded. ""How could she? I'm going to talk to her.""



Ciara's parents never loved her. They'd even tried to marry her off the moment she turned eighteen just to collect the engagement gift from the groom's side.



To escape them, Ciara had lived with Lydia at Jane's house all through college. Jane had practically raised her like a daughter.



Lydia reached out and stopped Jane, pulling her phone back. ""Don't. She's not the only one at fault.""



Jane understood heartbreak more than most. Her eyes shifted to a photo on the wall—her son, from his baby days to now at eighteen. His father had never come back.



That kind of powerless waiting made her feel especially furious.



""Call Michael here,"" Jane said. ""He owes us an explanation.""



Lydia set her fork down and gave a calm, faint smile. ""Everything Ciara posted was visible to me alone. I've saved screenshots. I'll send them to Michael—just not yet.""



Jane paused. She thought back to the first time she met Lydia, a stubborn little girl covered in bruises, refusing to shed a single tear.



Lydia had never been easy to push around. She always got even. And that included what the Hollander family did to her—she would return it all, one day.



\*\*\*\*\*



That night, Lydia stayed over at Jane's house. Around nine, Michael called once, asking where she was.



There was a hint of hesitation in his tone, like he had more to say, but he didn't push further.



The next morning, when Lydia returned, she saw a group of movers outside the villa across the street.



The furniture being unloaded was from the most luxurious brand in Raventon. Back when she was decorating the place, she had considered this brand—but couldn't bring herself to splurge.



She walked over, just about to ask the workers a few questions, when the supervisor stepped out with a delivery receipt in hand.



""Careful with everything—if you break even one piece, you can't afford to replace it,"" he barked at the workers. Then he noticed Lydia and gestured for her to move. ""Please step aside.""



""This is my house."" Lydia held out her hand. ""I want to see that receipt.""



The supervisor looked surprised, but still handed it over.



""This is your place? Then the woman inside... is she your family?"" he asked.



Ciara's name was printed clearly at the top of the delivery slip. And this was already the second shipment. The total cost was over two million dollars.



Lydia took a deep breath and handed the slip back. ""It's been paid for?""



The supervisor nodded. ""All cleared.""



""Then go ahead and move it in,"" she said.



Lydia crossed her arms and leaned against the porch. She waited until everything was unloaded and the movers had left before she stepped inside.



""Ms. Merritt, your pumpkin soup is ready—Mr. Finnian asked me to make it for you,"" a middle-aged woman who seemed to be the cook called upstairs. Then she turned and caught sight of Lydia, clearly startled. ""W-who are you?""



Lydia caught a whiff of the sweet scent of pumpkin soup in the air and found it almost laughably cruel.



She had studied countless recipes to help Michael's alcohol-damaged stomach heal. One of the most effective ingredients? Pumpkin.



""Lydia?"" Ciara's voice called down from upstairs, full of shock. Her face showed panic, like Lydia was some kind of monster.



""Lydia, w-what are you doing here?"" she stammered. ""Michael said I could move in. Please don't be mad—I haven't touched any of the wedding stuff you bought.""



She looked so pitiful, anyone watching might've felt sorry for her.



Lydia had been fooled by that act for years, thinking Ciara was innocent and sweet. She never imagined Ciara would turn out to be such an ungrateful, greedy little snake.



Lydia calmly picked up her phone and called the property management. ""Someone broke into my house. Handle it immediately, or I'm calling the police.""



""Lydia, please don't make me leave. I really—"" Ciara panicked and tried to come downstairs, but her legs seemed to give out. She collapsed onto the steps in pain, crying as she pleaded.



""Lydia, what are you doing?"" A furious voice snapped from behind. At the same time, Lydia caught the flash of triumph in Ciara's eyes.



A man rushed toward Ciara. Of course—it was Michael.



The building management wouldn't dare cross the CEO of Finnian Group. But now that things had escalated, Michael was clearly embarrassed. His face was as dark as a thundercloud.



""I told Ciara she could move in,"" he said to Lydia. ""You could've just called me. Why did it have to come to this?""



Ciara clung to his arm gently, looking pitiful. ""Michael, Lydia said this is her house. She has every right to kick me out.""



""Her house? I paid for it!"" Michael's cold, mocking words stabbed straight into Lydia's heart.



Back when she secretly sold off her father's antiques to cover the losses in his company, Michael had told her everything he had was hers. And now—less than two years later—this was his response.



""Are you going to change the name on the deed?"" Lydia asked, her tone icy. The question made something in Michael's chest tighten.



Beside him, Ciara slowly stood up. ""Michael, maybe I should go. I don't want to be the reason you two are fighting.""



Her soft, understanding act hit the right nerve. Michael's protective instincts flared. He scooped her into his arms. ""Go? Why would you leave? If you can't stay here, then you'll just move across the street.""



""But... all this furniture?"" Ciara said, unwilling to give it up—after all, it was worth over two million dollars.



Michael glanced at Lydia. ""Pack it up. We'll need it when we get married.""



Once Michael and Ciara were gone, Lydia pulled out her phone and called a flea market. ""I have a shipment of brand-new luxury furniture. Never opened. Selling for half price.""



Chapter 3 She Was Walking Away From Michael

The people from the flea market arrived quickly.



Seeing the brand-new furniture, untouched and still wrapped, they were overjoyed and paid without hesitation.



Just as Lydia finished checking the payment, Michael showed up. He frowned at the furniture being loaded back onto the truck, looking worn-out and helpless.



""I told you we'd need it for the wedding,"" he said. ""And these are all the brands you mentioned before. Even if you cancel and reorder, it's still the same.""



He had asked his assistant to pick only the best.



The atmosphere turned awkward. One of the flea market guys seemed to pick up on something and said to Lydia, ""Ms. Sullivan, I've already paid in full. According to our trade rules, this stuff is mine now.""



Lydia nodded. ""Of course. Go ahead.""



The truck pulled away soon after, its oversized flea market logo glowing on the back. Michael's headache only worsened at the sight.



""You sold all that as secondhand?"" he asked, clearly upset. ""If you didn't like it, you could've just returned it at full price.""



Lydia gave him a cold, pointed smile. ""Once something's been touched by someone else, I find it dirty. How could I return it at full price?""



Her words carried a deeper meaning, one that made Michael uneasy.



But he told himself that they were getting married. Nothing could go wrong.



He steadied his nerves and softened his voice, trying to sound indulgent. ""As long as you're happy. Just pick out whatever you want. Tell me, and I'll have my assistant take care of it.""



He spoke as if nothing had changed. But Lydia only felt a growing chill inside.



""There's a tradition back in my hometown,"" she said flatly. ""The bride and groom shouldn't see each other before the wedding. I won't be coming home.""



Michael visibly relaxed at her words. He stepped forward and wrapped her in his arms. ""Okay. Whatever you say.""



Lydia let him hold her, her body stiff, her heart filled with nothing but bitter irony.



\*\*\*\*\*



Over the next few days, Lydia and Michael really didn't see each other again.



But Ciara's updates—visible only to Lydia on WhatsApp—were unusually frequent.



\[The soup you made for me was amazing.\]



\[My ankle really hurt when you were massaging it, but that kind of pain made me feel so happy.\]



\[It was just a nightmare. You didn't have to insist on staying the night.\]



\[You said you couldn't help yourself, and staying over was just an excuse. You're so bad...\]



Each post came with a photo.



In those photos, Michael's hands—the same ones that once made Lydia feel safe—were holding Ciara's ankle, wrapped around her waist, and even slipping up her chest.



\[If it's with you, I'm willing.\]



That post was paired with a shot of crumpled lingerie scattered on the floor, taken in close-up. Lydia couldn't take it anymore. She rushed into the bathroom and retched over the sink.



""Ms. Sullivan, are you alright?"" her subordinate, Hunter Swanson, stood outside the door, worry all over his face, but hesitant to come in because of the situation.



It took Lydia a long while to pull herself together.



She looked up at the mirror. Her eyes were red and teary from the nausea, her face pale and pathetic.



She forced a weak smile. ""I'm fine. Must've eaten something bad.""



Hunter sighed. ""Back then, to win deals for Stellar Horizon Group, you went to those dinners behind Mr. Finnian's back and drank so much you ruined your stomach. You really need to take care of yourself.""



Stellar Horizon Group was the small company Dennis had given Michael to manage back in college. Lydia had sold a few antiques to help raise funds, but without solid projects, the company was running on fumes.



Later, Michael proved himself and joined the management team of Finnian Group. Compared to that giant corporation, Stellar Horizon was barely a blip. To thank Lydia for her help, Michael spun it off from Finnian Group and gave her half the shares.



Lydia had wanted to focus on supporting him, so she had promoted Hunter to run Stellar Horizon. Over the years, the company had done fairly well.



Lydia straightened up and stepped out of the bathroom. On the table in the private room was the equity transfer agreement she'd already signed.



""You can send the money over in installments. I'm not in a rush,"" she told Hunter. ""Stellar Horizon's future is in your hands now.""



Hunter couldn't hide his excitement. ""Ms. Sullivan, I won't let you down.""



But Lydia didn't really care anymore.



She was walking away from Michael—letting go of the company they had once fought so hard to build together meant nothing now.



\*\*\*\*\*



The afternoon before they were supposed to get their marriage license, Michael sent Lydia a message. \[Ciara's moved out. I had the house cleaned up. If you're not comfortable staying across the street, you can move back anytime. I'll stay at a hotel.\]



Lydia thought of that photo—the twisted mess of lingerie—and felt another wave of nausea rise in her gut.



\[Okay.\] She replied with just one word, then called a professional cleaning crew.



Nothing in the villa had changed. But every now and then, she would still find little traces of another woman—feminine products wedged between the couch cushions, under the nightstand, or tucked into the corner of a desk drawer.



She was numb to Ciara's petty tricks by now.



Lydia didn't lift a finger during the cleanup. She just had the crew pack away all her belongings, erase every sign of her presence, and sanitize every surface.



It wasn't until seven in the evening that the work was finally done.



Just as the cleaning team drove away, Michael's car pulled into the driveway.



Seeing Lydia still there, he paused before getting out, resting one arm on the open car door, eyes fixed on her. Despite the dark circles under them, his gaze was intense, burning.



""Lydia, do we really have to wait until the wedding to live together?"" he asked. ""I can't sleep without you.""



Her phone buzzed in her hand. Lydia looked down and tapped the screen.



Another update from Ciara. \[Thank you for the birthday gift—and the spaghetti you made. I'll always be by your side, no matter what.\]



This time, there were three photos. One of fireworks exploding over a beach. One of the sun rising over the ocean. And the last, a plate of spaghetti loaded with ingredients.



Next to the plate was an open gift box containing a rainbow-colored diamond bracelet. Inside the bracelet was a ring—its massive, pigeon-egg-sized diamond catching the light and gleaming blindingly.



It was a custom piece from a luxury brand partnered with Finnian Group. The very engagement ring Lydia had picked out for herself.



A bitter ache twisted in Lydia's chest. She almost laughed.



Of course Michael couldn't sleep without her—he was too busy massaging Ciara's legs, sleeping with her, taking her to the beach for fireworks and sunrise views. He had his hands full.

I've been very interested in the history of Ireland (especially the north) for a very long time. As a Puerto Rican, I see so many parallels between our countries (islands that have been colonized for centuries, a history of resistance against said colonization, and a deep love for our culture/history/language) and I can't wait to finally be there next month. I've done a bit of research about what to see in Belfast - particularly focusing on things involving the history of the freedom movements - but would love some advice from natives and locals. Aside from wanting to learn as much as I can about the brave men and women that fought against imperialist oppression, I also would love any tips on good art, coffee, food, parks, bookstores, record stores, and places to hear live music.

The coffee smelled better than it tasted. It usually did. I sat at the kitchen table with an oversized mug, swirling the black liquid like it might get stronger if I gave it enough motion. It didn’t.

The cuckoo clock rang out its horrible nine calls — once a beautiful childhood memory, now just an irritating reminder. Nine a.m. I’d been up for two hours already. Not because I was rested, but because my brain refused to give me a clean night’s sleep anymore. Four hours, maybe five if I was lucky, then the slow crawl out of the bottle and into the light.

My son was still asleep down the hall. Small mercy. If he was asleep, it meant he wasn’t bouncing around the living room asking for cartoons yet.

From the other room came the sound of boxes sliding against hardwood. My new roommate was moving in today. Not a bad guy from what I could tell — a little quiet, polite, the kind of person who says “sir” when they don’t have to. Sharing space with someone new at thirty-three wasn’t ideal, but the extra rent kept the lights on.

He appeared in the doorway with a cardboard box labeled **BOOKS & CRAP** in black Sharpie. He was smiling — not the salesman kind, just that easy, unguarded kind some people are born with.

“Mornin’, boss,” he said. “You make coffee?”

I nodded, lifting my mug. “In the pot. Won’t change your life, though.”

He chuckled, set the box by the wall, and headed for the kitchen. He opened the pantry first, scanning the shelves like he was looking for buried treasure. I watched him for a second and found it oddly funny — probably says something about his upbringing, expecting cups to be neatly lined in a cabinet instead of piled wherever there was space.

“Dishwasher,” I muttered. My pounding head couldn’t give me more than that.

He paused, grabbed a cup, and poured. The splash and gurgle of coffee hitting ceramic made my temples throb, stirring up memories from the night before.

“Hey,” he said, casual as can be, “I meant to say… everything seems cool so far. The house, you, your wife. Only thing I clocked was, you know…” He made a vague drinking motion with his hand. “But that’s your business.”

I blinked at him. “My business,” I echoed, not sure if it was a jab or just… a note. He sipped his coffee before I could decide.

That’s when I heard it — a faint child’s scream. Not loud, could’ve just been playing, but it was enough to pull my eyes toward the window. The street looked the same as always: the Mathesons’ brown Buick parked too close to the curb, old Mr. Juno’s flagpole rattling in the wind. Somewhere down the block, a dog barked twice and stopped.

I glanced back at him. He hadn’t moved. Just sipping his coffee, eyes steady on me — like the sound hadn’t happened at all.

  
  
  


**Chapter Two – Names and Other Things That Slip Away**

The headache didn’t leave. It never did, not really — just shifted weight from one side of my skull to the other.

I stood at the sink rinsing out my coffee mug, watching the dark swirl down the drain. My kid — I wish I could say that with inflection; he’s not mine, the poor bastard — but even in this horrible state I could muster up some fatherly love. He shuffled into the kitchen, hair pointing every direction except down, clutching his sneakers like he couldn’t figure out how they worked.

“Shoes on?” he said, full of excitement and inflection.

“Grandma’s house?”

I nodded and mumbled something he didn’t catch, him already halfway to the living room.

I went to the bottom of the stairs to shout — whisper, my head screamed — that I was leaving for work, only to realize I didn’t know his name. My wife had told me yesterday, I was sure of it. Two syllables? Maybe three? It wasn’t something plain like *Mark* or *John*, but it wasn’t strange enough to stick either.

The sound of a shower running upstairs told me he was already getting ready for work. Or so I assumed — shift? Office job? I didn’t know and honestly didn’t care. My wife showed me the pay stubs and it was enough to cover rent. That was all I really cared about. Or at least, it had been.

The drive to Grandma’s house was quiet except for my kid humming something tuneless in the back seat. Sunlight sliced through the windshield in a way that made my headache flare. I dropped him off with a hug I hoped looked normal enough, even if his shoes were on backwards.

“Waddling like a duck,” my own grandma would say. I’m sure I’d catch flak for it later.

I got back in my car, but the image of the unnamed roommate’s smile from this morning still floated in my head.

Work was the same as always — the same voices, the same tasks, the same sound of Becky bitching about last night’s close. But I kept thinking about him. His face. That easy grin. The way he hadn’t reacted to that scream outside this morning, like it was just another noise in the world. *Just another casual, yes sir… I heard it too, what about you?*

I could picture him in the kitchen, coffee in hand, looking right at me. And I still couldn’t remember his name.

By the time I pulled into the driveway, the sun was already leaning west, and the headache had settled low behind my eyes — not gone, just… squatting there.

My wife was on the sofa, scrolling on her phone, her hair back in that messy knot she did when she was home. She glanced up and gave me that look — the one that said she was reading me without saying a word.

“Hey, mi amore,” I said, my voice raspier than I meant it to be.

Her eyes flicked to the clock and back to me. “Rough day?”

I didn’t answer. I dropped my keys in the bowl by the door and went to pour a glass of water. Beer was waiting for me in the bag I brought in. 

That’s when my kid – Koaglie– as when i came into his life, he gave me the impression of being raised by wolves. His cream brown skin and wild hair always brought back memories of watching the “JungleBook”,  came barreling in from the living room. His socks slid on the hardwood and he caught himself on the counter, grinning. “Antman! guess what Grandma let me do!” he said, words tumbling out before I could answer.

I smiled anyway, the kind that didn’t quite reach my eyes. “What’s that, buddy?”

“She—” he started, but was cut off by the sound of the front door opening. The echoing sound of our security door also saying “Front. Door” Only this time echoing my dread.

Footsteps in the hallway. Heavy boots on the wood.

“Hey, Anthony,” came the voice, easy and familiar. “Hope you don’t mind — I took your mug this morning to work. The coffee was really good .”

I turned toward the doorway and there he was, the roommate, grinning the same way he had this morning.

And just like that, the name was there in my head. Clear as day.

Aria's POV

I stood in front of the chapel.

Pink roses and white lilies decorated every corner. My favorite flowers.

The guests were already seated. Soon, at the end of the red carpet would stand the man I once loved, waiting to marry his bride.

Everything was perfect.

Except I wasn't the bride.

“I really need to see Jace today.”

I begged the bodyguard blocking the door. A beat-up suitcase and two boxes sat at my feet. Everything I owned in the world.

""No you don’t. Get out of here,"" the bodyguard said icily.

I saw disgust in his eyes. Yeah I get it. No one has sympathy for the crazy ex who shows up at the wedding.

But I have my reason to be here.

""If you don't let me see him, I'll just stand here and all the guests will see me,"" I threatened under my breath.

Jace wouldn't want that. Especially not today.

Because today, he was marrying Delilah Hart.

She is the sister to Alpha Grayson Hart of Redstone Pack. A 100% high-society darling.

All the guys in the world knew that marrying Delilah would totally change their lives, including Jace.

So he made the easy call—marrying the lady who could turn him from a small-town nobody into a golden boy. And dump the girl who stayed by his side for last 4 years when he had nothing.

He didn’t want any guests to see me here. Because I represented his broke, embarrassing past. He wanted me nowhere near his glittering new world.

Tears stung my eyes as I thought of that. Like a knife was twisting in my chest.

“Let me in or I’m starting to yell.” I choked.

The bodyguard frowned. ""Wait here.""

He finally called somebody. A few minutes later, he waved me in.

I wiped my eyes and struggled into the hall with my suitcase and boxes.

Instantly, I felt out of place.

Everything reeked of wealth here. Expensive perfume. Manicured nails. Not a hair out of place. It was everything you imagined about the upper-class and way more.

And me?

I was wearing a baggy T-shirt and jeans. My sneakers had holes.

""God, a homeless. She stinks."" A woman mutter as I walked by.

No it couldn’t be. I just showered this morning. My hair still smelled like strawberries and coconut.

But poverty had a scent, apparently.

""Mr. Carter is inside."" The guard took me to a closed door and warned, “Make it quick.”

“Thank you.”

The room inside looked like something out of a movie. Marble floors. White carpet. A chandelier that probably cost more than my apartment.

And there he was.

The man I used to love.

Adjusting his bowtie in front of a mirror.

Jace was still heartbreakingly handsome. No wonder Delilah fell for him.

When he turned and fixed his gorgeous blue eyes upon me, I still felt my heart race.

""Hey, Jace,"" I said quietly.

And immediately, I wanted to punch myself.

Hey, Jace?!

That’s the best I could do?

His face was ice cold.

""You shouldn't come, Aria.” he said with a frown. “Your ratty suitcase, your ripped jeans, your Vans. None of that belongs here.""

Well if you wanted to be brutal and vicious, that’s how it’s done.

""Don’t you think I deserve an explanation? You dumped me over a fucking email!"" I snapped.

He shrugged. ""Look around you. The wealthiest people in the world came for me today. This suit I’m wearing cost more than you can make in your entire life. What more explanation do you want?""

Wow.

I always knew he was a cold, calculating bastard.

I just didn’t realize how deep it ran.

""Maybe chasing Alpha’s sister got you here faster. But you know what? When she finds out how shallow and cold you are. You’ll lose it all.""

Anger flared across his face.

""I know how to love someone! I just won't waste that on a small-town girl like you.” he said freezingly, “Are we done here?""

“No.”

I took a deep breath and got into the real reason I came.

""You're marrying a rich girl. Fine. But why did you have to get me fired?""

Yeah. I used to work for this jerk.

From intern to full-time at Apex Corp, he was my supervisor.

Our office romance was a secret. And just days ago, I found out he was getting married with Apex CEO’s sister. And I was out of a job thanks to him.

""Right, your job.” The jerk shrugged, “You got your job all thanks to me. Now that I’m not around, maybe they finally saw how incompetent and stupid you are. Problem?""

Was he fucking kidding me?!

""I graduated top of my class. Made it through 7 rounds of interviews. My performance exceeded every quarterly target. I earned that job!"" I snapped.

“Come on, Aria. You really gonna be so naïve?”

He walked closer, smirking.

""You passed the interviews because I said so. Your sales? I contacted those customers for you. Without me, you'd be nothing but a pretty face.""

He seized my chin and looked me over with a disgusting look. I slapped his hand away.

""Give me my job back,” I hissed, my voice slightly trembling. “My dad’s debt. My grandma’s medical bills…I need the money. You of all people should know what it’s like to be poor. Don’t. Make. Me. Beg.""

I was throwing my pride at his feet.

But he just laughed.

""Well, how about I offer you a deal?"" he said as though he’d been waiting for this moment.

He brushed my hair back, fingers trailing down to my collarbone. I shivered in disgust.

""You and I. We never fuck. You were so clinging to that pathetic no-sex-before-marriage rule. Maybe it's time to grow up. Let me fuck you once and I’ll write you very handsome check. How does that sound?""

I widened my eyes in shock.

Then I slapped him. HARD.

“FUCKING HELL…What the hell are you doing?! I’m getting married in front of everyone in fucking 10 minutes!” He roared covering his swollen face.

""Fuck you, Jace!” I yelled, “You're a spineless freeloading puss! And hey—congrats on the wedding. Hope your junk is soft like a fucking spaghetti tonight!""

Then I stormed out dragging my suitcase and boxes, ignoring his angry curses behind me.

Hot tears poured down as I dashed across the hallway.

God this couldn’t be any worse.

I was prepared to drop all my self-esteem and begged with my life. Because I needed the job and money.

But I still let him get to me.

Now what do I do?

My salary barely covered my rent, my father’s debt and grandma’s bill. Now with my job gone, I already got kicked out by my landlord. I probably had to sleep in a park tonight.

So do I go back and let that jerk win? Let him humiliate me...No. I’d rather die than that…

""Hey, watch where you're going!"" someone yelled.

Too late.

I slammed right into the man in front of me.

He was tall. So tall I felt like I’d just walked into a brick wall.

His diamond cufflink was sharp like a blade. When we collided, it sliced clean through my thin T-shirt with a loud rip.

In one second, the front of my shirt was torn open, exposing my white lace bra.

“Ah!” I gasped and looked up.

This was the most handsome man I’d ever seen. His face was like a statue carved by a master artist. And his expression was so cold and distant.

When he looked down at me, I swear I was about to drown in those stormy gray eyes of his.

Suddenly, I recognized who he was.

This was Alpha of Redstone Pack. CEO of Apex Corporation.

Jace’s brother-in-law.

THE legendary. Grayson Hart.

“Aria Collins?”

His voice was sexy and velvety.

He lowered his head and his eyes dropped to the exposed part of my bra. Maybe it was just my imagination, but the color of his eyes seemed to darken as he stared.

Wherever his gaze landed, my skin started burning up.

But wait.

How did he know my name?

# Chapter 2 With Ex's Brother-in-law

Aria’s POV

Of course I recognized him. God, who didn’t?

I’d met him at the Apex gala. His face was on every finance magazine cover, and any time you turned on a TV, there he was—linked to the latest scandal with some actress or model.

But there was no way he’d know who I was.

“I-I…Hello, Alpha Grayson,” I stammered.

He turned his eyes away and said to a nearby guard, “Escort Ms. Collins out.”

“Yes, Alpha.”

The guards stepped in immediately, stretching out their arms like I was some kind of contaminant that might taint Grayson’s perfectly tailored suit.

“Wait a minute. You’re not going to say something about my shirt?” It’s torn beyond repair and was showing my breasts.

He paused. Just for a brief second. Then flicked something down at my feet.

I looked down. A blank check.

“I need a shirt that can cover my front. Not your hush money.” I gritted with humiliation.

But he didn’t even glance back and just walked away.

“God,” I muttered under my breath.

Can you believe these rich bastards?

They think they can buy everything with money.

People nearby were all staring, snickering under their breath. I tried to cover my chest and grab my things to escape, but it was hard to do all that with just two hands.

“Oh my god…Aria Collins?”

Three girls emerged from the whispering crowd. I took one look at them and sighed internally.

Great. Just when I thought today couldn’t get any worse.

“Hello. Layla. Sabrina. Brielle.” I said dryly.

I used to work in the same team with these girls back at Apex. We were all under Jace.

These girls adored Jace. They spent more time flirting with him by the coffee machine than actually working. Which left me doing most of their work.

After I got fired, and when news of my secret relationship with Jace got out, they decided I was public enemy number one.

“What are you even doing here, Aria? Trying to win back your ex at his wedding? That’s a new low even for you,” Layla snickered.

“I’m not here to win anyone back.” I tried to push past them.

But they blocked me.

“What happened to your shirt?” Brielle snickered. “Did you seriously walk in here with your bra out? Is this like some low-budget fashion statement?”

They burst into laughter together.

“You could be completely naked and Jace still wouldn’t give a damn,” Sabrina squeaked. “Because he’s marrying Lady Delilah. THE Delilah Hart! Redstone Pack’s sweetheart. And you…well you’re just a poor-ass small-town girl.”

I stopped in my track and gave them a cold glare, “Oh yeah? Well at least this smalltown girl actually dated Jace. And you all got nothing. Do you know how many times I had to listen to him complained about your screechy voices and cheesy perfume after we got home? Apparently he rather be with me than any of you.”

Their jaws dropped.

“Jace would never say that!” Brielle cried.

“And my perfume isn’t cheesy!” Sabrina screamed.

“Word for word,” I rolled my eyes. “Now move. Or I’m rolling this suitcase over your pretty little skirts.”

They looked like ruffled chickens, but they parted. I quickly shoved my dingy luggage ahead like a weapon and stormed out of the church.

Rich people were assholes.

Grayson, Jace, and their whole damn minions.

I struggled to get my suitcase down the steps, and once I hit the street, cold wind slapped me in the face.

It’s almost night. But I had no idea where to go.

I could crash in the hospital with my grandma, but she’d ask too many questions. Like why I hadn’t brought Jace around recently, or why I wasn’t staying at my apartment. I didn’t want her to know how bad things had gotten.

I thought about the park. Sleeping on a bench. But in a ripped T-shirt that exposed my whole front? Horrible idea.

So I texted my best friend, May, asking to stay at her place for a few days. She was my rock. If the whole world turned against me, at least I still had her.

She texted back right away inviting me to come over.

Dragging my suitcase across the street toward the bus stop, I told myself it was going to be okay. This horrible day was going to end.

Then I heard them.

“Hey, nice shirt!”

A group of street wolves were loitering near the stop.

I hugged myself tighter and curled into the bench, hoping they’d get bored and leave.

“C’mon baby, drop your hands. Let us see what you’re working with.”

Go away. Go away. Go away.

“You rip that shirt yourself? Damn that’s wild. I like that in a girl.” One of them moved closer, reaching for my shoulder.

“Fuck off!” I snapped, my voice shaking.

But it only fired them up.

“Oh, feisty. Shake those tits for me!”

They grabbed my wrists, yanked my arms down. My T-shirt gaped open completely, revealing my lace bra. The cold air made my skin pebble. They laughed even louder.

I struggled and screamed. My wolf growled in rage.

Shifting in the city was illegal…but right now, I didn’t have a second choice…

Just then. Blinding headlights. Followed by screeching tires.

A silver car skidded to a stop inches away.

The door flew open. A deep voice thundered:

“Get in.”

I was too shocked that I didn’t think twice and obeyed. The car peeled away the second I shut the door.

“My suitcase!” I cried.

“Someone will get it,” he said darkly. “Address.”

I told the driver May’s, my body still shaking. Then he pressed a button. A privacy screen slid up between the front and back seats, sealing us in the back.

That’s when he turned toward me and leaned in. Like a beast ready to pounce.

His scent hit me. It’s sharp pine mixed with cold metal.

My head started to get dizzy.

“Walking on the street in that shirt was a mistake,” he said darkly.

“It got like this because of you,” I mumbled.

He snorted.

Then there’s the sound of rustling fabric. A heavy jacket landed across my shoulders. It was still warm from his body and carried his scent.

I held my breath.

Wearing his coat almost felt like…he was wrapping himself around me.

“Alpha Grayson…do you know me?” I whispered.

My gut told me that he would never do this for a strange girl. But if he knew who I was, he must know that I was his sister’s husband’s ex. That didn’t explain why he would help.

“We’ve met,” he said simply.

I stared at him, searching those icy gray eyes. He was staring at me too, with those cold, hungry, possessive eyes. I felt like I was completely naked in front of him.

“Aria,” he warned, voice thick and husky.

But I couldn’t control myself.

I was leaning forward.

Shit. Why did my body become so weird?

My skin was on fire. My panties were wet. All I wanted was more of his scent. More of his heat.

The next second his lips crashed onto mine. Hard. Rough.

I gasped and opened my mouth for him. His tongue slipped in and explored every inch of my mouth, making me shiver. His hands pushed into my torn shirt and grabbed my breast. I couldn’t control my moan when he touched my naked skin.

This…This was crazy.

He was a stranger, and most importantly, my ex’s brother-in-law.

And I was making out with him at the back of his car.

The crazy part was I didn’t even want to stop.

He lifted me onto his lap like I weighed nothing. I straddled his thighs and yanked at his tie as he bit my collarbone.

Then, suddenly, the car stopped.

“Alpha, we’ve arrived,” the driver said behind the screen.

That’s when it all froze.

His lips paused at my neck. I was still squirming on his lap, flushed and throbbing. But he shoved me off.

“We can’t do this,” he said coldly.

# Chapter 3 You're Special To Him

Aria’s POV

“So you’re telling me this guy made out with you in the backseat of his car… and then just shoved you off like nothing happened?” May asked in shock.

20 minutes later, I was sitting at her place, wrapped in one of her oversized hoodies, a steaming mug of tea in my hands.

But I was still reeling from everything that had just happened.

“Yup,” I muttered. “Who knows what’s wrong with him.”

“What an asshole,” she huffed. “But honestly, this really isn’t like you. You dated that jerk Jace for 4 years and didn’t even sleep with him—which, by the way, was a brilliant choice—and now you're suddenly making out with a complete stranger in his car?”

I opened my mouth but had no idea what to say. Yeah, she had a point.

“I—I don’t know. Maybe it was the whole Jace-getting-married thing. Maybe I just snapped and wanted to screw around with someone hotter just to get back at him…Honestly, it was so stupid now that I think of it.”

She grinned and wiggled her brows. “So… he was hot huh?”

My cheeks flushed and my mind drifted back.

Those stormy gray eyes, his perfectly shaped lips on my neck, and those arms that could pick me up like I weighed nothing…Shit I need to stop.

“Yeah. VERY,” I whispered, hiding my red face behind the mug.

May burst out laughing. “Now we’re talking! That’s exactly what you need right now—a drop-dead gorgeous rebound to get that loser Jace out of your system. Screw your ‘no sex before marriage’ rule. Life is short.”

I gave her a weak smile.

Honestly, I didn’t need a rebound. I needed a job, money, and a place to live. Grayson Hart was like dessert when you can’t even afford dinner.

“So… do you even know who this guy was?” she asked.

I hesitated. Right at this moment, the doorbell rang.

She jumped up to get it and came back a few minutes later, hauling in my luggage, her face frozen in disbelief.

“OMG. You are not gonna believe what just showed up outside.”

“Umm… my luggage?” I joked.

“Two fucking muscular guys in black suits and guns! And a freaking stretch limo! They called me ‘ma’am’ and said they hope Miss Aria has a wonderful evening. Now, you—”

She leapt at me and shook me by the shoulders.

“—you tell me right now who the hell you hooked up with!”

I squealed and dropped into the couch with her, laughing and giggling breathlessly.

“Okay, okay—I’ll tell you. It was… Grayson Hart.”

I practically whispered his name.

Because honestly, I still couldn’t believe it either.

May froze, eyes wide as saucers. “Grayson—THE Grayson Hart?! As in our Alpha? The CEO of Apex?!”

“And Jace’s soon-to-be brother-in-law. Now you know how stupid I was earlier?”

She let out a full-on scream. Then she grabbed my hand, her face flushed with excitement. “Oh my God! Aria, do you know what this means? Alpha Grayson never even lends his jacket to his model girlfriends. He likes you. You’re special!”

“No,” I said firmly. “If I was special, he wouldn’t have thrown me off his lap when I tried to take off his shirt.”

“Maybe he had somewhere to be—”

“Don’t, May. Let’s be real. Guys like him don’t fall for girls like me.” I took another sip of tea, hiding the ache in my chest.

Hell even Jace thought I was beneath him.

What chance did I have with Grayson freaking Hart?

“Don’t be silly, Aria. You’re gorgeous. And smart and amazing and—WAIT! I just had the best idea ever.”

“What?”

“That arrogant jerk Jace thinks you’re just some small-town prude who wasn’t good enough for him right? But what if you ended up with Alpha Grayson? It’ll be easy to get him because he’s already obsessed. Oh, it would destroy Jace. That dickhead would never recover.”

OKAY.

I’d be lying if I said that exact scenario hadn’t crossed my mind when Grayson kissed me back.

What girl hasn’t daydreamed about dating the perfect guy and getting revenge in the most dramatic way possible?

But right now, I couldn’t afford to daydream. Reality was already breathing down my neck.

“Tempting. But right now I need a job and enough cash to keep Grandma in her hospital bed. Dating rich dudes isn’t exactly high on my to-do list.”

May looked at me with soft eyes. “So…any plans? I can try to hook you up with a job, but you know I just work at a coffee shop, and with your degree, you deserve so much more.”

I hugged her. “Thank you. Really. I’ll figure something out. Apex promised me severance when they fired me, so I’m going to HR tomorrow to get it sorted.”

If I could get that money, at least I’d be OK for the next round of Grandma’s medical bills.

—

The next morning, I showed up at Apex right on time.

But the second Brielle walked in with the HR manager, I had a bad feeling.

“What’s she doing here?” I asked coldly.

“I’ll explain in a minute,” HR replied with a polite, rehearsed smile as she sat across from me. “So Ms. Collins, I understand you’re here to discuss severance?”

“Yes. So let’s not waste time. Just give me the check and I’ll be out of here.”

“Unfortunately, severance only applies when the company terminates a contract without cause. In your case… it appears you were let go due to misconduct.”

Misconduct?

What the freaking hell.

“Jace made a snap decision and booted me. What misconduct are you talking about?”

“But that’s not what Mr. Carter said. He provided evidence that you made a costly error on a sales quote—omitting a few zeroes, to be exact. Cost the company millions. Here’s the email record.”

She handed me a printed sheet.

I swore I had never sent this email in my life. But there it was—my name in the sender field.

No freaking way.

Jace forged this.

“And Mr. Carter reported that you had a difficult attitude toward your coworkers. Quote: ‘impatient and arrogant.’ Brielle’s here to verify that.”

Brielle twirled her hair and smiled smugly. “Yeah. Aria was a horrible team player.”

I stood so fast my chair screeched. “The only thing I didn’t ‘teamplayed’ with you was flirt with the boss in the breakroom!”

“Liar!” she yelled. “And I asked Jace. He never said my voice was screechy!”

Oh my God. I couldn’t believe how stupid she was.

“Sit down, Miss Collins,” HR warned. “As of now, not only are you not getting severance, but we’re also considering legal action to recover the losses. If you understand the situation here, sign this acknowledgement—”

“Does Alpha Grayson know about this?” I asked.

Both of them froze. After a long pause, HR finally found her voice. “What does Alpha Grayson have to do with any of this?”

“He owns Apex, doesn’t he? Does he know his team is abusing their power and firing hardworking employees illegally?”

HR frowned. Brielle let out a loud snort. “Please. Don’t act like you know Alpha Grayson.”

“What if I do? What if I go to him and then it’s you who gets fired?”

She laughed in my face. “Oh, you mean you know him on TV?”

“Let’s find out.”

I shoved my chair back and stormed out, heading straight for the CEO’s private elevator at the end of the hall. HR scrambled after me, shouting my name.

I was too furious to care how this ended. All I wanted now was to blow the whole damn place up.

Two guards stood by the elevator.

“I need to see Alpha Grayson,” I told them.

“Appointment?”

“No, but I swear he knows me. Just tell him it’s Aria—from yesterday. He’ll remember.”

“You aren’t the first girl here saying that,” one of them mocked.

“Come on, Miss Collins,” HR snapped, trying to drag me back. “This is getting crazy. Go back, sign the paper. Take responsibility for your own mistake.”

“I didn’t send that email. It was Jace—he’s framing me! I will report all of you.”

“Alpha Grayson doesn’t have time for your report, or your visit, or any of your little drama!”

“I believe no one but me has the right to decide that,” a cold voice said behind us.

# Chapter 4 Take Me, Please

Aria’s POV

A large hand grabbed my arm and pulled me away from HR’s grip.

I looked up and my heart almost stopped.

Even I couldn’t believe he just showed up here. It felt like a dream.

“A-Alpha Grayson,” HR stammered, her face frozen with shock and fear.

“I don’t need employees who think they can make decisions for their boss,” he said freezingly while wrapping his arm around my waist. “If I see something like this again, you’re fired.”

“Y-yes, Alpha. I’m terribly sorry…”

HR’s expression was priceless, but I was in no mood to enjoy it. His icy pine scent consumed me again, making my body weak and hot. My wolf let out a soft purr, urging me to lean into him. But before I could even move, he let go.

A pang of disappointment hit me in the chest.

“Come,” he said shortly, striding toward the private elevator.

I shot HR and the stunned security guards a smug look, then hurried after him.

He swiped his card and the elevator doors closed. We started going up to the 58th floor.

It was dead silent. My heart was beating so wildly that I was afraid he’d hear it. I snuck a glance at him—he just stared straight ahead, emotionless, keeping a distance, like he wanted to be anywhere but here.

Unease twisted my stomach.

“So, um… what brings you here today?” I broke the silence.

He sighed softly. “I owe this company.”

“Oh, Oh…Right.”

I wanted to punch myself in the face.

The awkward silence lingered until the elevator dinged open. The 58th floor was a wide-open space with no cubicles or dividers—just massive floor-to-ceiling windows and a sweeping view of the entire city.

“Wow,” I whispered under my breath. Grayson was already walking ahead.

I jogged to catch up as he led me into an office at the far end of the floor. A stunning female assistant closed the door behind us, and once again, it was just the two of us. My heart rocketed back into my throat.

He casually unbuttoned his jacket. It was amazing how he made even that look sexy.

“So you insisted on seeing me?” he asked.

He didn’t ask me to sit. He didn’t even move closer. That distance stung a little.

“I worked here till a week ago when I found out I was let go for no reason…” I quickly told him the story of how I was fired. “This is clearly illegal in so many ways… can you help me get my job back?”

“Unfortunately, no,” he replied, barely hesitating.

My heart dropped like a stone. “Why not?”

“I’ll have the hiring department look into whether your termination followed proper protocol. But this isn’t something a CEO handles directly. Anything else?”

The hiring department?

That could take weeks—and I didn’t have weeks.

“No… you don’t get it,” I stepped forward, my voice trembling. “My grandma’s in the hospital. Her bills are getting insane every month. And I’m already deep in debt… If I can’t make money, I don’t even know— I really, REALLY need this job.”

I knew we came from two different worlds, but laying out the most desperate parts of my life in front of him still made me feel horribly exposed. I just hoped—begged—that he’d understand.

But he didn’t.

His gray eyes stayed emotionless.

“I’m sorry, Miss Collins,” he said quietly.

Tears rushed into my eyes. I couldn’t even breathe.

All I could think about were the bills, the debt, the mountain of shit waiting for me the second I left this building.

“If there’s nothing else, my assistant will show you out.” he said, reaching for the intercom.

I rushed forward and pressed my hand down on his before he could call anyone in.

His whole body stiffened—but he didn’t pull away. He just stared down at me. I stepped in closer, tilting my head up. His gray eyes darkened like a storm brewing in the distance.

His pine scent wrapped around me again, thick and intoxicating. As werewolves, our scent only spikes during a fight or sexual arousal. It was damn obvious which case this was.

“You clearly feel something for me,” I whispered.

He said nothing. I placed my hand on his chest and felt his heartbeat. It was racing as well. His breathing had also turned shallow.

“What are you doing, Miss Collins?” he asked tightly. “Trying to seduce your way into a job?”

“You can do whatever you want,” I locked eyes with him. “I won’t stop you.”

His Adam’s apple bobbed. God, I wanted to lick it.

And… well, I did.

I leaned up and pressed my lips to it. He let out a growl.

The next second, I was pinned on his desk. He stood between my spread legs, one hand by my head. I whimpered, clamping my thighs together—the heat between them was almost unbearable. Just like in the backseat of his car.

His hand slid from the desk to my throat. It was so big, he could probably snap my neck if he wanted.

“You shouldn’t keep tempting me, Miss Collins.”

His body was pressed against my thighs—I definitely felt the effect I was having on him.

“Why?” I whispered, licking my lips. “Because your self-control isn’t as strong as you thought?”

“Because I don’t fuck virgins.”

What the actual hell???

The next second, he had pulled away. I scrambled off the desk, face red, eyes wide.

“What did you just say?!” I snapped. “Why—How the hell do you even know—?”

“I know who you are. And I know about your relationship with my sister’s husband.”

And just like that, everything clicked.

It was Jace.

That bastard didn’t just dump me—he ran his mouth about my virginity to everyone, including Grayson.

Humiliation crashed over me like a wave.

“Jace is a fucking asshole,” I snapped shakily.

Grayson shrugged. “Obviously. But Brielle likes him. And he’s family now. I’m sorry but I just can’t get involved in this.”

I climbed off his desk with my whole body red and shaking.

He didn’t want me. And he was taking his sister and Jace’s side.

I was so damn stupid to think that one kiss in the car actually meant anything. But this was Grayson Hart for Christ’s sake. He could have anyone he wanted.

“I’m sure you’re a very capable employee, Miss Collins. But seducing me won’t help your career. I wish you all the best.”

He finally pressed the intercom button. His assistant appeared at the door, waiting for me to leave.

“Bye,” I whispered without even look back. I didn’t want him to notice my falling tears.

I walked out of that office, numb, and rode the elevator down like a ghost. My mind was a storm of bills, debt, and Grayson’s ice-cold stare. Now I desperately needed a new job.

“Miss Collins!”

I turned and saw his assistant come rushing out again, holding an envelope.

“Alpha Grayson asked me to give you this,” she said, handing it over.

“What is it?” Why didn’t he give it to me earlier?

“He didn’t say. Maybe you’ll know once you open it.”

She gave me a mysterious smile and walked away.

I opened the envelope. A blank check slid out first—I held my breath in shock.

Then I found a crumpled note. His handwriting, rushed and messy.

Haven’t repaid you for the shirt. Hope everything works out for you Aria. Stay strong. —Grayson

# Chapter 5 Getting My Attention

Aria’s POV

“That check clearly means something,” May insisted.

“Come on. We’re not doing this again,” I sighed.

“If he’s not into you, then why did he give you that check? He probably saw you crying and couldn’t stand it. You should definitely go back and see him again.”

“Nope,” I shut it down immediately. “I had one perfect, fairytale encounter with a rich bachelor. That’s enough. I’m not about to go back there and humiliate myself all over again.”

“But—”

“Hey, you two!” our manager yelled from the other end of the aisle. “Less talking, more working!”

We rolled our eyes at each other and got back to inventory.

May had helped me land this supermarket job.

It was part of a chain under a big corporation, so the pay and benefits weren’t bad. May still thought it was beneath someone with my degree, but honestly, I was just grateful to be employed.

Once we finished our section, the manager wandered off to shout at someone else, and May scooted back over to me.

“Just imagine it,” she grinned. “You could write a couple million on that blank check and…BOOM! Instant rich girl life.”

“I’m not gonna do that.”

“Sure you won’t. You’re too nice,” she muttered, half-admiring, half-scolding. “So? What are you gonna write?”

I hesitated.

At first, I actually considered writing the price of a shirt. 19.99 that was. Because apparently, my dignity still thinks it matters.

But let’s be real, Grayson wasn’t just paying me back for a ripped tee, or he would’ve simply handed his assistant a $20 bill.

Maybe… he felt bad I lost my job too.

“I’m going to write the amount I should’ve gotten in severance,” I admitted eventually.

May's eyes bulged. “That’s it?!”

“I know it’s not much, but it’s what I actually deserve. And it’ll help me cover 2 months of bills.”

May sighed and looked at me like I was the biggest idiot alive. But my mind was made up.

I just wanted to walk away from the mess as quickly as possible. I still wanted to rip Jace’s smug face off, but the best revenge right now was surviving.

6 hours later, we finally finished our shift, exhausted and aching.

Everyone else got to clock out, but not me. I’d volunteered for night shift and closing duties.

The staffs left one by one, yawning, including May. Finally I was alone in this big market.

Now here’s the big secret—

I actually lived here now.

Nobody knew this, not even May.

She thought I’d found a new apartment and moved out, but I just couldn’t keep bothering her anymore. Her roommates were getting irritated with me hogging the living room and utilities.

And renting my own place seemed way out of budget now.

So I stayed in this supermarket instead.

I closed up the store at night and opened it early in the morning. For the 5 or 6 hours in between, I made a bed out of my coat and slept on the floor near the refrigerated section.

Now don’t ask me why I can’t sleep in the staff’s break room. That room was too hot without AC. At least it was cool by the freezer.

Tonight I was extra exhausted. The manager made us girls haul too many heavy crates around. I fell asleep on the floor in seconds.

It felt like I’d only been asleep for 5 minutes. My alarm hadn’t even gone off yet.

And I was jolted awake by someone screaming:

“—OH MY GOD! What the hell are you doing?!”

I shot upright, still half-asleep.

And I froze.

In front of me stood an entire group of people. Including the manager and several guys in suits. They were all staring at me wide eyes.

And I was only in a tank top and shorts. Half naked.

OH GOD.

What the hell…Is it morning already?!

Why didn’t I hear my alarm?

I scrambled to pull my clothes over my body, my hands shaking.

The stares didn’t stop. They got more invasive.

“Aria Collins! What the fuck are you doing?!” the manager stormed over and roared. “Napping half-naked in my fucking store?! Are you a fucking sex perv?!”

My face went beet red, “No! I—I was just staying here temporarily—”

“Temporarily?!” he yelled, eyes bulging. “I hired an employee, not a fucking squatter! How much water and electricity have you used free?! Have you been stealing food too?!”

“No I swear! I shut everything off when I’m done, I don’t use the water unless I have to…And I paid for everything I’ve eaten!”

Tears blurred my vision as I tried to explain, but he wasn’t listening. His spit actually hit my cheek as he snarled.

“Of all days—you had to pick the day corporate shows up to camp out in my perfect store. You filthy, disgusting little—”

“Aria Collins?”

A new voice called my name. It came from one of those suited men.

I looked up. And my heart dropped.

God I knew this guy. I think his name is Jonathan. A former coworker of mine from Apex.

“Holy shit, it is you,” he grinned in surprise, raising his brows. “Almost didn’t recognize you at first.”

“You… what are you doing here?” I stammered.

“Apex owns this supermarket chain. We’re doing site inspections today,” he said with a smirk, his eyes trailing down to my bare legs. “Man! Most people hit rock bottom after getting fired from Apex, but you fall faster than anyone.”

“I’m working. Making a decent living,” I said in shaky voice. “There’s no shame with that.”

“Oh really?” he sneered. “Does your job include lying around half-naked on the floor? What is this, a new hooker gimmick?”

The suits burst out laughing. My furious tears were on the verge of falling.

“I’m so sorry, sir. I’ll fire her right away.” The manager groaned.

“Hold up,” Jonathan drawled with a smirk. “This chick got fired from Apex for messing up a seven-figure deal. You might wanna check your inventory. She could be stealing.”

I was furious. “You know that’s a lie! Jace made it all up. I never made a single mistake at work—”

“Oh please,” he cut me off. “Everyone in the industry knows how you fucked up. Jace was so embarrassed that he had to apologize to all the customers for you.”

The manager grabbed my wrist. “Then you’re definitely stealing from this market as well. That’s it. You are going to jail. When I figure out what you’ve taken, you must pay back everything!”

My heart pounded in my chest.

I didn’t doubt for a second that the manager would come up with something that I didn’t steal, just like how Jace framed me before. It wasn’t hard for guys like them.

But I couldn’t go to jail.

My grandma had no one to count on but me. I can’t leave her.

I knew what I had to do.

The wolf in me surfaced up the next second. I snarled at the manager, yanked my arm free, and ran.

“Stop her!” someone shouted behind me.

I had no idea where I was going. I just fucking ran. Desperate and horrified.

At the door, I slammed right into someone coming in.

“Get away from Alpha!” a bodyguard barked.

I staggered back in panic. But a large hand caught my wrist, steadying me.

“Aria?”

I looked up, still shaking involuntarily.

God, it’s indeed him! I couldn’t believe he’s here.

There’s a tight furrow between Grayson’s brows as he checked me up. Then he quickly unbuttoned his coat and wrapped me in, covering my half-naked body.

“It’s OK.” his voice was deep with clear hint of rage.

I clutched his shirt, gasping for air.

But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t seem to breathe at all. Tears streamed down my cheeks.

“She’s having a panic attack,” a woman said nearby. “Alpha, if I may—”

I silently prayed him not to hand me over. And he didn’t.

“It’s fine, Nova. She stays with me,” he refused. “Aria. Breathe.”

Panicked footsteps echoed behind us. Jonathan’s voice rang out, stunned:

“Alpha Grayson! W-What’s going on here?!”

“Nova,” Grayson said in a cold, dangerous voice, “Stay here. Don’t let anyone leave.”

“Yes, Alpha.”

He scooped me up like I weighed nothing, one arm under my legs, the other around my back. I instinctively wrapped my arms around his neck.

Then he carried me through the astonished crowd, into the store, and found a private room.

“You’re safe here,” he said after he shut the door.

That’s when I broke down. Crying out loud.

Fear, shame, panic—everything spilled out in a messy, helpless flood.

I clutched his wrist like it was the only thing keeping me from falling apart. He didn’t pull away.

I cried for 10 minutes straight He waited for my sobs to quiet down.

“Th-thank you…I’m better now.” I sniffled eventually.

He wiped a tear from my cheek with his thumb. I shivered at the way he touched my skin.

“You are always a mess when I find you,” he said. “Why is that?”

“I don’t know…Fate?” I choked.

He let out a dark chuckle. “This is not good.”

“W-Why?” I didn’t mean to be miserable all the time.

His voice was low, rough, and strained.

“Because it’s getting harder and harder for me to leave you like this,” he said.

“Ella, hurry up or you’re going to be late for school!” This is the second time my mother has yelled upstairs for me, but I just sit here, on the edge of my bed, staring at the wall.

I tell myself that it’s going to be a good day, but who am I kidding? I haven’t had a good day at school in two years. Only six more months left of my senior year, and then it will be all over. I’m not sure how I feel about it yet, and that’s the most messed up part. I’m eighteen years old, about to graduate high school, and I have a full scholarship to pretty much any college I want to go.

My name is Ella Baxter and I’m a nerd who has no friends, I never break any rules, and I have a deep need to please everyone, but myself. I haven’t always been this way, but circumstances bring on change, and for me, it was not for the better. I used to have a lot of friends; two of them being my best friends, Amy and Bree. We were inseparable throughout middle school and junior high. It wasn’t until the beginning of sophomore year when I had to distance myself from everyone in my life except for my family.

“Honey! Are you coming down or not?” Once again, my mother’s voice reaches me. Sighing, I reach down, grabbing my backpack, and head down before mom has a coronary.

I paste a smile on my face as I round the corner to the kitchen, where my younger sister and brother sit with a bowl of cereal. Eli, my nine-year-old brother has his bowl tipped back as he slurps the milk out. Meanwhile, my fifteen-year-old sister, Elise, is dripping milk on the table every time she spoons the cereal into her mouth because her eyes are glue to her cellphone. This is an everyday occurrence in the Baxter household.

I roll my eyes and lean down, giving my dad a kiss on his cheek, “Good morning, daddy.”

“Morning, sweetie, did you oversleep again?” His concern for my wellbeing is written all over his face. I’ve always been his little girl, and it shows in the way he babies me over everything. I don’t complain though, because I need all the love and attention that I can get these days.

“No, daddy.” I don’t add anything else, but I do smile at him. I could have lied and made something up, but again, I’m a goodie goodie; I would never lie to my parents. He only hesitates a moment before going back to his newspaper.

Taking my seat beside my dad, my mother sets my two slices of peanut butter toast and a banana down in front of me. Unlike my siblings, I’m not a fan of cold cereal. I prefer something more substantial in my stomach before starting a grueling day at school.

“This is the third day in a row that I had to holler for you to come down more than once, Ella,” Mom takes her place across from me, on my father’s other side, as she sips her black coffee, “Please don’t make it a habit, my throat is starting to hurt.”

My father chuckles behind his paper, earning himself a slap on the arm from his wife, “Behave, Ethan!”

I’ve been around my parents enough to know how they are. They are both in their early forties, and still have their good looks. Unfortunately, they also still have a high sex drive, so I can only imagine what my dad’s chuckle was insinuating. Being around them every day, you get used to it. Besides, I think it’s so cute that, even after all these years, they are still madly in love with one another. I hope I find a love like theirs in my lifetime.

“Oh! Before I forget,” Mom turns back to me, “I have a PTA meeting at Eli’s school this evening. I’ll have a casserole in the oven but will need you to make sure your brother and sister eat.”

“Sure, no problem.” My mom is always volunteering here and there, and she is the head of the PTA, so she is always busy with that. “Will you be home for supper, dad?”

“I’m not sure, honey. I have a meeting with a client, and it may run late. Just put a plate in the warmer for me if I don’t make it in time.” I nod. My dad is a partner at his Law Firm, so it’s no surprise when he doesn’t make it home on time. Sometimes my mom will bring dinner to him and his client if the meeting runs over.

Finishing up the last of my breakfast, I take my plate to the dishwasher and then scoop my bag up, “The train is leaving!” I call out to Eli and Elise. Driving them to school every morning is our little morning ritual. It’s the only time that we get with each other these days. Elise is always busy with her friends, now that she’s a freshman, and Eli locks himself in his room and plays video games all evening.

As soon as we get into the car, Elise cranks up the radio, and our morning karaoke session begins. Ed Sheeran’s song, Shivers, my sister’s favorite song, is playing, and she squeals. She starts to dance as she belts out the words, and I can’t help but to laugh as I watch her strawberry blonde curls bounce around. Her blue eyes sparkle when they find mine, and she gives me a big smile. Unlike some sisters, we actually get along very well, but it’s times like this that I envy her innocence. I hope she never has to experience a day of what my life is like, because I’m afraid it may break her.

The second bell that starts the first class of the day is about to ring as I slam my locker closed. With my laptop bag slung across my body, I quickly make my way to my first class before anybody can stop me. Mr. Miller, our math teacher, sits at his desk, shuffling through papers while we all file into the room. I breathe a sigh of relief once my butt touches my chair, knowing that for the next ninety minutes, I’ll have some semblance of peace.

Unfortunately, Mr. Miller had us working on our next assignment, which kept me busy through the whole class, and before I know it, the bell rings. Packing my laptop away, I turn to leave and accidentally bump into someone, I curse under my breath when I see who it is.

“Watch where you’re going, nerd!” Kaylee Simpson glares at me as though I had done it on purpose.

“I’m really sorry, Kaylee, it was an accident.”

“I’m really sorry, Kaylee, it was an accident.” She mimics and then shoves past me, “How about you accidentally jump off a bridge?” Her friend, Callie, snickers at her lame attempt to insult me as they walk out.

Bumping into the captain of the school’s dance team first thing in the morning pretty much tells me exactly what kind of day I’m going to have. Kaylee doesn’t even know why she hates me so much. We used to be acquaintances, not really running in the same crowd, but still talking between classes and outside of school. Now she treats me like the dirt under her feet. Like everybody else, she dropped me like last season’s fashion line two years ago. One Friday night we were talking at a friend’s party, and then come Monday morning, Kaylee and most of the senior class started to ignore me. It had only taken about a week, and then the rest of the school abandoned me as well. That’s when it all started; it’s when Jace Palmer decided to make my life hell.

# Chapter 2 Friends No More - Pt.

As next door neighbors, Jace and I grew up playing together. Our parents are very good friends and were always bringing our families together for summer barbeques, holidays, birthdays, anything…you name it…our families celebrated together. Jace knows everything about me, and I, him, since we were best friends; wherever Jace was, I was right there with him. That is until we entered our sophomore year in high school. It was as though he had developed amnesia and didn’t remember that we were best friends.

I remember as if it were only yesterday. It was the third Friday after the school year had started, and we had hung with a group of friends after school let out for the weekend. We were excited and talking about the party we were all going to that night. As always, Jace had driven us over to the party. I was having a good time even though I wasn’t drinking any of the alcohol that was available to us, but Jace was. Not that it was unusual for him to be drinking, because I was always the DD for him afterwards.

At one point, I spotted Jace standing in a corner talking to some girl named Madison, that had just moved to town. Her and her brother were fraternal twins, but complete opposites. Her brother, Mason, was more on the wild side, and a bit cocky, whereas she was more reserved. It looked like Jace was enjoying the conversation, so I wandered around, stopping a few times to chit chat. When Mason had stopped me, he handed me a bottle of water, and I remember thinking to myself that it was very kind of him to notice that I wasn’t drinking.

The night went on, and Mason stuck to my side, flirting with me the whole time. Kaylee had come over, and we talked for a good thirty minutes before she moved on to talk to others. When I looked around the room, Jace was nowhere to be seen. The party was slowly dwindling down when Mason asked if I needed a ride home. I had thanked him and told him that Jace was my ride, but then he informed me that Jace already left the party with his sister. That hadn’t sat well with me, because it wasn’t like him to just up and leave without telling me.

I began searching the house for him, because I just couldn't believe that he had left me stranded. When I couldn’t find him, I looked outside for his car, but it was gone, the spot where he parked was empty. I tried calling his cell phone, but it kept going straight to voicemail. I was officially pissed off with my best friend, and he was going to get an earful when I talked to him the next day. I had no choice but to take Mason up on his offer to drive me home.

After giving Mason my address, I buckled myself into the passenger seat and tried texting Jace, but he never replied back. Messaging him on social media had the same outcome, although, with those messages, I could see that he was reading them, but ignoring me completely. I started to become worried, and when I lifted my head to say something to Mason about Jace ignoring me, I noticed that he wasn’t heading to my house. Instead, he was pulling into a secluded area where teenagers go to make-out or just get laid.

There were a few other cars in the clearing as we pulled in and he parked his car. I had tried to tell him that I wanted to go home, that I didn’t want to be there with him. He tried to sweet talk me into staying, and eventually told me that he would only take me home if I gave him a kiss. What’s one little kiss going to do, right? I gave in and leaned over to give him a quick kiss, but he grabbed me and hauled me over the middle counsel, and crashed his mouth against mine.

I started to object when he took the opportunity to shove his tongue into my mouth. He was stealing the kind of kiss that I was saving for someone special. My fists started pounding against his chest, trying to get him to stop. With all of my thrashing around, I somehow got him between the legs with one of my limbs, causing him to grunt and pull back. Climbing back to the passenger side, I had demanded that he take me back home right away. After glaring at me for a moment, and then a few curse words, he started his car, and took me home.

When we pulled up in front of my house, I could see that Jace’s bedroom light was on. I grabbed the door handle and went to open it, but Mason locked it before I was able to. He tried apologizing for his actions, explaining that he really liked me and wanted me to give him a chance. It wasn’t until I agreed to think about it, that he unlocked the door so I could get out. I was trying to hurry because I wanted to try calling Jace again, but then I notice that his bedroom light was now off, and flooded in darkness. Sighing, I went inside and went to bed myself. I never did get to talk to Jace the next day, or the day after that, and by the end of my first class on Monday morning, I was officially ostracized.

# Chapter 3 Obey Me - Pt. 1

I spend my school days trying to avoid Jace. Luckily, I only have one class with him, and that is last period Study Hall. Most of the time I skip it because I’m so far ahead in my schoolwork that the teachers don’t bother me about leaving. Today was like any other day, I quickly make my way through the halls, avoiding the areas that I know Jace tends to be in. Sometimes I get lucky and make it, and sometimes I don’t.

Watching where I’m going, while zigzagging through the halls, and staying aware of my surroundings, I suddenly feel a tight grip around my arm. I’m yanked into the now empty Art room, and tossed against the wall. The lock clicks, and then I’m staring into a pair of green eyes as the person turns my way. Jace has a smirk on his face as he looks me up and down. He normally slams me against lockers, trips me, and even steals my things, tossing them around with his friends, playing keep-away, like they were kids. This is a new low for him, though.

“What do you want, Jace?” I tried to sound annoyed, but then my voice cracks at the end, giving me away.

“Where have you been hiding all day, Ella?” He crosses his arms in front of his chest and looks down at me. I stand about eight inches shorter than him, so I’m always having to look up.

I roll my eyes at him, “I wasn’t hiding. I just want to get to my classes on time.”

Next thing I know, Jace’s broad chest is right in front of my face, “Did you just fucking roll your eyes at me?” He sneers down at me, making my heart start to race.

Damn, I should have known better than to give him an eyeroll! He warned me last time what would happen, but would he really do it? I glance around the room, trying to find another way that I could possibly escape, and that’s when I see his two best friends standing only a few feet away, wearing identical smirks. Toby and Brandon are two of the school’s popular guys, and two of the biggest jerks as well. Jace started hanging with them shortly after he dumped me; what he sees in them, I will never understand. Now, he has become one of them.

“I’m sorry, Jace. I didn’t mean to.” I dip my head when I see him bring his arm up, thinking he’s going to strike me. Instead, he grabs my nape and walks me over to the nearest desk.

“I told you that you would be punished if you ever rolled your eyes at me, didn’t I?” He bends me over the desk until my cheek is pressed down against it, “Answer me, Ella. Did I not warn you?”

“Y-Yes, you did Jace, but…”

“No buts, Ella. If I don’t keep my word than you will never obey me.” He motions for his two friends to come closer, “Hold her arms, and make sure she stays in place.”

“Please, Jace…you don’t have to do this!” I beg, “I promise to obey you from now on…I swear!”

His hand comes down to caress my hair, “Oh Ella, I know you will obey me, because I’m going to show you what happens when naughty girls don’t listen.” His voice is calm as he speaks to me, but then he shoves my head into the desk even more as he moves away to stand behind me.

I can’t see or hear what Jace is doing behind me, but I can see Toby, who is holding my left arm and shoulder down, nod at whatever his friend is communicating to him. A tear drips from my right eye as I remain bent in this humiliating position while I wait for him to begin. I’m not sure  how much it’s going to hurt, but I do know that it isn’t going to feel good either.

I feel the sting of his hand before I even realize it was coming down. I go up on my toes to try and get away from him, but a hand presses into my lower back, keeping me from moving. The spot where is hand met my backside burns already, and that was only the first one.

“Count them out, Ella.” Jace commands, but I’m still too stunned to say anything. My head gets jerked back by my hair, and he leans in so close to my face that I can see the little golden flecks within the green of his eyes. Something passes as our eyes meet, but it was less than a second, and his eyes harden once more, “I said count!”

“O-One.”

He holds onto my hair for a few seconds longer before going back behind me. Bringing his hand down once more, I make sure I count each one. I falter on the fifth one because it was harder than the rest, but I quickly call it out. By the tenth smack, my butt is on fire and tingling, as numbness threatens to take over.

“Why Jace? Why do you hate me so much?” Tears are now falling down full force as I ask the one question that I have never gotten an answer to, “WHY?” I scream when he ignores me and brings his hand down once more.

“I don’t answer to you, Ella,” His breathing is heavy from spanking me so hard, “Just know that you did this, all by yourself!” His hand comes down in rapid succession, taking whatever aggression he has, out on my poor backside. When I start to scream, a hand covers my mouth, muffling the sound.

All of a sudden, everything stops, and I’m released, but I don’t move; I can’t move. I hear the click of the lock, and then the door closes. Still, I don’t move. I feel the burn that his hand left behind, but there is something else I feel as well. I don’t understand why I’m feeling this way after he did what he did. It feels both wrong and good at the same time. Is it normal to feel tingles deep inside? I now feel a need that I’ve only felt a couple of times before; a need that I have had to take care of myself.

But here’s the thing: river cruising isn’t meant to be a cheaper version of ocean cruising. It’s a completely different style of travel, and that uniqueness comes with a different kind of value.

# Smaller Ships, Big Difference

A river cruise ship usually carries between 100 and 200 guests. Compare that to the 3,000–6,000 passengers on a large ocean liner and you start to see why the math is different.

On a small ship:

* You’re never waiting in line for a buffet or tender boat.
* The staff know your name (and usually your coffee order) by day two.
* The atmosphere feels more like a boutique hotel than a floating resort.

But fewer passengers also means fewer people to share the cost of operating the ship — from fuel to chefs to entertainment. On a mega-ship, economies of scale keep fares low. On a river cruise, you’re paying for that elbow room and personal attention.

# You Dock in the Middle of the Action

One of the biggest perks and biggest differences is where you dock. Ocean ships often tie up at industrial ports outside the city, and you’ll need a shuttle or taxi to get anywhere interesting.

River ships, on the other hand, dock right in the heart of the destination. Step off in Vienna and you’re minutes from a café on the Ringstrasse. Wake up in Bordeaux and you’re strolling through a market in less time than it takes to find your sunglasses.

Prime riverfront docking is limited and in demand, which means higher fees for the cruise line — but it also means *more time in the destination and less time getting to it.*

# It’s More Inclusive Than You Think

This is the part where most people’s perception shifts.

Your river cruise fare often includes:

* **Gourmet meals** featuring regional cuisine
* **Beer and wine** (sometimes premium spirits) with lunch and dinner
* **Daily guided excursions** with expert local guides
* **Cultural entertainment** like concerts, folk dances, or cooking demos
* **Airport transfers** and gratuities (on some lines)
* **Bikes or walking tours** you can take on your own

If you’ve been on an ocean cruise, you know how fast extras can add up — a couple of tours, specialty dining, a few drinks, transfers to and from the port. By the end of the trip, the “cheap” fare might not look so cheap.

# There’s a River Cruise for (Almost) Every Budget

Not all river cruises are priced the same. Just like ocean cruising, there’s a range of brands:

* **Ultra-luxury** lines like Uniworld, Scenic, and Riverside offer all-inclusive indulgence — think butlers, top-shelf drinks, and jaw-dropping interiors.
* **Premium** brands like AmaWaterways, Avalon, and Viking balance inclusivity with great value and a strong focus on cultural immersion.
* **More budget-conscious** options like Amadeus, Emerald, or VIVA Cruises offer well-designed ships and excellent itineraries at lower price points.

And if a river cruise isn’t the right fit right now? Inclusive resorts and guided land tours can give you a similar “everything taken care of” feel sometimes for less money while you save up for your dream sailing

It’s a Hotel, Restaurant, and Chauffeur in One

When you think about it, a river cruise combines what you’d normally pay separately for:

* **Hotels** (you unpack once and keep your room the whole trip)
* **Transportation** (your “hotel” moves to the next destination while you sleep)
* **Daily sightseeing** (no need to book transfers or tickets)
* **Dining out** (every meal is included, with no extra bill at the end)

There’s also the *peace of mind factor*: no lugging bags between train stations, no worrying about getting lost en route to the next city, and no logistical headaches. Someone else handles all of it.

**It’s Not Just About Luxury — It’s About Immersion**

River cruising is built for travelers who want to *be in* the destination, not just visit it. Because the ships are small, itineraries can include places larger ships can’t reach like tiny medieval towns on the Rhine or wine villages along the Douro.

You spend more time in port, often late into the evening, so you can catch a concert, wander after dinner, or watch the city light up. And the excursions aren’t cookie-cutter; they might include meeting a local winemaker, taking a market-to-table cooking class, or cycling along the riverbank.

# Price-Savvy Ways to Book

If the price still gives you pause, here are ways to make a river cruise more budget-friendly:

* **Sail in the shoulder seasons** (spring or late fall) for lower fares and fewer crowds.
* **Book a last-minute deal** if your schedule is flexible.
* **Choose a lower cabin category** — you’ll still enjoy the same food, excursions, and service.

If you measure a river cruise against an ocean cruise on price alone, the numbers might not add up in its favor. But once you compare *what’s included, where you go, and how you experience it*, the value tells a different story.

For many travelers, the appeal isn’t just the comfortable stateroom or the attentive service — it’s the ability to step off the ship and be in the middle of a storybook town, to savor a glass of wine from the vineyard you visited that morning, and to watch centuries-old castles drift by as you sip your coffee.

A river cruise won’t be the cheapest vacation you ever take. But for those who value immersion, convenience, and a slower, richer way to see the world, it might just be the most rewarding.

# River Cruise FAQ

**Q: Are river cruises really more expensive than ocean cruises?**

A: On the surface, yes — but when you factor in what’s included (tours, drinks, transfers, gratuities on some lines) the gap narrows considerably. Many travelers find the overall value is equal or better.

**Q: How many people are on a river cruise ship?**

A: Most carry between 100 and 200 guests, which means more personal service, a quieter atmosphere, and faster boarding and disembarkation.

**Q: What’s included in the fare?**

A: Typically meals, wine/beer with lunch and dinner, daily guided tours, onboard entertainment, and sometimes extras like transfers, gratuities, or bikes. Exact inclusions vary by cruise line.

**Q: Is there a lot of downtime on a river cruise?**

A: You’ll have a mix of structured tours and free time. Many itineraries include evening stays or overnight port calls so you can explore at your own pace.

**Q: Are river cruises only for older travelers?**

A: Not at all. While the average age tends to be 50+, many lines now offer themed cruises, active excursions, and multi-generational sailings that appeal to younger travelers too.

**Q: How can I save money on a river cruise?**

A: Book during the shoulder season, consider a lower deck cabin, look for promotions on lesser-known rivers, or be open to last-minute deals.",0,1755241248.0,SmallCruiseships,0,0.5,False

1mqq1h0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearch/comments/1mqq1h0/why_have_i_never_been_able_to_secure_my_first_job/,Why Have I Never Been Able to Secure My First Job?,"About four years ago, when I was 16, I began applying to jobs. I got interviews, but no job offers. Strange, isn't it? To this day, I'm still not getting any job offers and I don't know why. So now I'm going to do some self reflection, and I want to see if you guys can help me find out what the problem is. I'll try to keep PII (personally identifying information) to a minimum.

About me (my job profile)

1. Record: I have no criminal record whatsoever, or any presence on social media under my real name.

2. Experience: I've never had a job before. However, I have volunteered for a homeless shelter, serving food to the people there, and set up a cycling race with a local nonprofit. That's the extent of my volunteer experience. And no, I never joined any ""after school clubs"" or ""sports"" back in high school.

3. Qualifications: I only have my high school diploma.

4. Connections: None. I never had any friends in high school and still don't now.

5: Personality: Quiet, reserved. I'm more of an independent worker than a team worker. I am often very shy meeting new people. 

6. Skills: Only ""soft skills"" as of now. I like to think I'm empathetic, understanding, and patient with other people. I also know some algebra from high school.

About my Job Search:

1. Job Type: Right now, I'm specifically looking for ""entry level"" positions. I'm so desperate I'll take any minimum wage job from any big name brand at this point.

2. Interviews: I've gotten a few interviews at some of the places I applied to. I've interviewed for a warehouse associate position at a local warehouse, Back of the House team member at Chick Fil A, a Courtesy Clerk at Kroger. ALL of these places have rejected me. And I've studied things about each of these companies, told them I have my diploma, used fancy words like ""self starter"", ""problem solving skills"" and outlined my volunteer experiences in the interviews. NO ONE will hire me. 4 years of searching.



Look, everything I posted here. That's about all there is to know about me (minus the PII) of my professional background. 

I'm currently twenty years old and living with my parents. I constantly feel like a burden on them. I do chores around the house and help where I can, but deep down I know financial independence is the only thing that will satisfy all of us. I still sleep in my childhood bedroom.

But after 4+ years of applying I can't seem to land a job anywhere. My brother has a job at a coffee shop and my only childhood friend has a job at a local car wash he was able to get within 6 months of graduating high school. Oh, and I applied to the same car wash brand (different location) he works at and got rejected. Go figure.

So my question is this - why won't anyone hire me? Is it because I'm shy and softspoken in interviews? Is it because of the lack of job experience? Or maybe my volunteer experience just isn't deep enough.

To everyone reading this, any advice you have would be very much appreciated. I just want a job so my poor parents don't have to keep taking care of me. Thank you for your help. Whatever you can give.",1,1755240638.0,jobsearch,1,1.0,False

I am terrible at interior design. I feel like the living room is the most important room so don't want to screw it up. Thinking of mounting a TV above fire place, possibly getting another couch, and potentially an accent chair or two then coffee table and various side tables/lamps, depending on what configuration makes most sense. The current furniture/decor is not our style. I think our style is more Transitional or minimalist (I was trying to figure out our interior design style and that's where one test online seemed to land me). Anyway, open to any and all ideas about layout of the room though, and appreciate the help!

I think I might be experiencing some kind of emotional burnout, apathy or something. My life has been quite stressful for  the last 5 years (studies that I'm not happy with, not finding a job that fulfills me, not feeling fully happy in relationships, caregiver exhaustion from last relationship). I feel like in many areas I'm never reaching that level of content and ""relieved"". Like me saying ""wow all this other stuff sucks but at least X is so damn good in my life"".

I guess I pay the price now by being so exhausted and uninterested in everything all the time. I feel like my status between my friends, my family and my co-workers is suffering because I really don't feel like socializing with them. I told a psychologist about this, but his view was more akin to ""Well not everyone likes talking about the weather or their pets"". But I feel like I'm missing out on so many social connections and moments, like I'm outside watching from a window how people are having fun.

My friends always (in a friendly way) bully me about how hard it is to get me to come anywhere or answer messages. It's hard to explain how stressful scheduling and leaving home feels to me, if I even want to leave the peace and quiet. It's usually fun when I spend time with them but I also feel a bit of exhaustion afterwards, like I wish I could've stayed home, done some exercise, watched movies all weekend etc. I wish I had the energy to invite friends out more.

I''m so tired of my family calling and asking why they never see me. I don't like going home for holidays/weekends because it's so socially exhausting to talk with everyone, visit places and relatives, and hear how bad their life is, telling me about how so-and-so person in my hometown died who I never met. I really don't care anymore. I also can't talk about my mental health without feeling judged and like I'm some kind of a medicated psycho. My mother hates to even say ""depression"" and says how I can't have it because she (hard-working woman) or my cousins (engineer and doctor) are not depressed either. She always asks if I've been having ""those feelings"" or if I'm using ""those pills"".

I also hate that I can't really don't seem to care enough about socializing with my coworkers. It sucks to see everyone spending time with each other even outside of work hours, but I don't even know how I would start a conversation as a new employee. I also notice that I tend to sit alone if possible, like my mind and body want to create distance from anyone. Probably the reason people don't come up to me and chat either lol. I've forced myself to coffee table discussions and go do sports with co-workers whenever possible but I feel so incredibly lonely there too. Like it doesn't even matter if I was there or not.

I don't even know at this point, what's wrong with me? Am I just asocial or burnt out? I want to meet more people, befriend them, care more about friends and family and be a generally fun person to talk to. I just don't have the social energy or motivation for any of this.

1mqpxy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/WestSeattleWA/comments/1mqpxy9/its_a_barber_thing_can_we_rid_of_or_something/,It's a Barber Thing; Can we rid of or something," A few years back in 2021, I had Ossiel as a barber at Rudy's Barbershop on Fauntleroy. I felt grimly the direction to which this haircut was headed immediately as I sat down.  He started off the haircut inquiring about my sexuality, who I am seeing- if anyone, preferred sexual activities, and rather intimate questions that are not fit for any haircut. I tried to thwart him off with flat answers or normal topics and I even volunteered my age in a desperate hope that might be a deterrent... perhaps a mistake. I had turned 18 just 5 months beforehand. Ossiel continued to be overly touchy with me through the haircut and then stated he would provide a complementary scalp massage which was not remotely a part of the cheap short haircut (It's a Rudy's for fucksake). 

I did not want this, but the environment and situation I was in made me feel a lack of autonomy. I was ushered to a hair sink where a rag was draped across my face. He slid his hands inside of his little masturbatory contraption as he tried to pierce my lips and sink his fingers into my mouth. What felt like my only bizarre defense in this moment, I pursed my lips tightly as to not have his fingers buried in my jaw. Perhaps realizing that, he went to sensually caressing the outside of my mouth, cheeks, and nose instead. Coming out from under the cloth I noticed some of the other hairdressers were looking over and I remember vividly mouthing to one of them for help. Nothing came of this, people carried on. The dramaturgical approach to life never seemed more apparent seeing the people around me continue to act within their roles. This was a program. 

Ossiel finished out the haircut, continuing to inquire about my sexual life, how easy I must get play. I remained in the chair dazed, unsure of how to process what exactly just happened. For my age, I had never encountered someone so fervently and unwelcomingly sexual. He handed me a Rudy's business card with his full name and phone number on it and told me to come back to him when I was older. I still have this same exact card in my wallet knowing at one point that I might have a change of mind and it may represent some sort of utility (Not to call the number lol). 

A year past, I had scheduled another haircut at a different establishment that had just opened. When I'm home in Seattle, I usually go to SODO for my cut but this new place was conveniently closer. After checking who the barber would be though, something I religiously have done since, I immediately canceled. He had opened his own shop in my neighborhood. I referenced the Rudy's card I had kept to cross-check the names. At this point I did feel invigorated to start up something. I emailed Rudy's on Fauntleroy requesting records of his employment- no response. I also came in-person to track down a manager- none present. I spoke with one of the employees and left a phone number- no call back. I myself was moving out of West Seattle for school purposes and with the dead-ends in mind, I threw the effort out. 

I am back home this summer a few years since the whole thing doing some heavy studying frequently at Olympia Coffee. He shares a storefront in the same apartment complex. I know this, but I had dropped it all believing that I had put the effort forward already to see nothing happen. Might as well carry on, why let it impede on a good study spot, and fuck em'. It did irk me though on some level that he has been able to maintain his own shop for a few years now knowing his manner towards at least me during one occasion. I only imagined if he felt comfortable enough to carry such a conduct with me, and open up his own shop in West Seattle afterwards, surely there was no remorse. And surely that means he has the capacity to carry on the same way with others. 

Randomly, I drove past this evening to see him outside of his shop- I generally avoid looking. It's been a few years now and seeing him more often, I was curious how his place was doing and if anyone had left a review suggesting a similar experience. Not more than four links below searching ""It's a barber thing reviews"" lies an entire Reddit forum entailing different times in which he has acted the same exact way and in some cases it seems, much worse. I read a few of these and found it jarring that someone had already described an exactly identical experience to me in the year-old forum now. Being a forum from a year ago and finding out I cannot make a comment there, I am compelled to reopen the subject entirely. 

Though I have written what amounts to a short story, I stress this is not merely an outcry or means for self-compensation. I'm over it. I just enjoy writing sometimes.  More so, and after reading other accounts, I care deeply for the amount of times I have recounted the incident and thought of someone just a few years younger. A teenage boy, dropped off for a haircut by a parent and unbeknownst to both him and his parent, entering this guy's establishment to be subject to the same treatment. Every single time I pass by or reside nearby I instinctually dread and acknowledge this possibility. 

Arguably, I was in adulthood at the time. Though, the overwhelming majority, him included, should be able to distinguish between an adult by the arbitrary assignment of the age of 18 and a real adult. This is not an accusation fueled by prejudice. This is a rational conclusion that this person has no regard to age on top of a well-established and greater disregard for basic agreed upon trust and human respect. I am not sure how this change comes about. I do not want this effort to be reduced to banter amongst people. His presence is truly threatening and there needs to be assurance that he cannot be practicing whatever he does. Because it's not haircuts that's for sure.

The first time I saw my father eat a man, I was nine.

We had been walking for days, frost gnawing at our ankles, the wind cutting through our coats. 

Hunger had hollowed us out, left our steps slow and our words few. That’s when we saw him—a man in the grass, barely alive, his chest rising in shallow waves, each breath a white cloud against the cold.

My father didn’t hesitate. 

He knelt beside him, drew his knife, and in one clean motion split him open. The sound was thick and wet, like cloth soaked through being torn apart. Heat bled into the frozen air, carrying with it the heavy scent of copper and raw earth. 

My father reached inside, fingers sure, and lifted the heart free. It steamed in the winter air, slick and red, still trembling faintly with the echo of a beat.

“No use in waiting,” he murmured, almost tender, before setting his teeth into it. Blood streaked his mouth, his chin, his hands. His eyes shut, and he chewed slow, deliberate. 

“Bitter,” he said finally. “Like coffee grounds and rust. Mean all the way through.”

He held it toward me. “Taste it. *Slow.*”

“I don’t—”

His hand clamped down on my shoulder, strong as iron. “You eat it…,” he said, his voice quiet but unyielding, “or it dies with him.”

I *bit*. 

The heat hit my tongue first, then the flavor—sharp acid, burnt sugar, something black and curling in the back of my throat. My stomach twisted, but I swallowed. His gaze stayed locked on mine.

“That’s it,” he murmured. “Now it’s in *you*.”


That night, in the thin glow of our campfire, my father told me the truth. We were bound to human life the way roots are bound to earth—not just for survival, but for the *truth* it gave us. Blood wasn’t only sustenance. It was a map. A confession. A man’s sins. His kindness. Every cruelty and every grace, all of it written in the taste.

His rules were iron *sharp*: Don’t take from good men. Don’t touch women or children. 

But hunger in our kind is a blade. It carves at you from the inside, sharper every day you go without. It will strip you of choice, and of *conscience*, until the taste, the rules, nothing matters—until you learn that mercy costs more than cruelty, and restraint is just *another* kind of hunger. 

“That’s why I’m telling you this now, while the fire’s still warm and your hands are still clean.”

The body is warm between us, steam rising into the night air. I hold out the heart, feel your hesitation.

“Go on,” I say, voice low.

“Dad, I—“

I raise the heart to your mouth. “You eat because if you don’t,” I pause, my father’s shadow burning through me, “it dies with him.”

You bite. Blood runs down your chin. I see it take hold—the understanding, the quiet fire.

I lean closer. “Now,” I whisper, “it’s in *you*.”

After binging all the *Final Destination* movies (including *Bloodlines*), I started piecing something together:

**Death doesn’t follow rules. It doesn’t just “correct the balance.” It’s an omniscient, sadistic entity that uses false hope, psychological traps, and generational manipulation to dominate its victims.**

And the more I thought about the visions, Kimberly’s survival, and all those fake “rules,” the clearer this became. Here’s what I’ve noticed:

# 1. Death Is Conscious, Not Just a Law

The kills aren’t random or mechanical—they’re deliberate and creative. Look at FD1:

* **Tod’s death:** The water doesn’t just spill; it slithers across the bathroom like a snake, then retracts after Tod dies. No physics works like that. That’s style. That’s intent.

If Death were just a natural law, it wouldn’t waste time on irony or artistry. But it does. Repeatedly.

# 2. The Visions Aren’t Warnings—They’re Planted Ideas

The characters think the visions are accidents, premonitions, or glitches. But here’s what I think:

**Death already sees everything. It views time as non-linear—the entire timeline is a finished puzzle.**

So what are the visions?

* **Planted thoughts.** False previews designed to lure survivors into a game they can’t win.

Why would Death do this?

* To make them **think they have a chance**.
* To savor their growing hope… before destroying it.

FD4 proves this. The **mall fire vision** doesn’t just show the protagonist dying in a disaster—it shows him *trying to stop Death and failing*. This vision is completely different from the usual formula. Normally, the opening vision just shows what’s about to happen. Later visions become more abstract, almost prophetic.

But this one? It shows him actively fighting Death, failing… and then, in reality, he makes a different move and actually saves hundreds of people. Hope blooms. The idea that they can “beat the system” spreads. And then—coffee shop. Game over.

That’s not fate. That’s **psychological warfare**. It’s Death saying:  
*“This is what it will feel like when you try to beat me—and fail.”*

Pure sadism.

*Bloodlines* doubles down on this. Stef doesn’t just get a vision—she sees **exactly what her grandmother saw decades ago**. That’s not a warning; that’s a **taunt across generations**, designed to pull her into the game. And it works. She seeks out Iris, and that chain of events seals Iris’ fate.

# 3. Death Creates Myths on Purpose

Over the series, survivors cling to “rules” that always turn out to be fake.

* **FD2:** They believe “new life breaks the chain.” The group celebrates… then Brian explodes at a barbecue. (*Kimberly and Burke survive, but the chain theory collapses. If anything, Death can weld broken links whenever it wants.*)
* **FD4:** Death knocks over a mug, soaking a newspaper—except for three words: *“Through Action They Were Saved.”* The group takes it as a sign. It’s not. They all die anyway.
* **FD5:** The idea that killing someone transfers their life? Doesn’t hold up. Nathan kills Roy (accidental), but Nathan still dies later. Why? Because the logic never mattered. The myth existed to make survivors paranoid and desperate.

If killing really worked:

* The guy who killed the agent should’ve inherited his lifespan.
* When the protagonist killed that guy later, he should’ve stacked both lifespans. But that never happens—because the rule was never real.

# 4. Kimberly: Death’s Long-Term Investment

This is where it gets dark. In *Bloodlines*, JB says Kimberly “broke the chain” and lived. He’s credible enough that the cast (and the audience) believes him. But if Death can kill whenever it wants (and FD3’s train crash proves that), why leave her alive?

Because Kimberly isn’t a loophole—she’s bait.

By leaving her alive, Death creates **survivor folklore**:  
*“It’s possible to win.”*

Decades later, in *Bloodlines*, that false hope infects Stef and Charlie. They believe drowning and resuscitation will save them, just like Kimberly. They want to live for their dead family. They feel safe—until the doctor crushes their hope by revealing Kimberly wasn’t technically dead because Charlie was able to resuscitate her.

That revelation isn’t just a plot twist—it’s a **psychological kill shot**. And then Death finishes the job.

# 5. Death’s Psychology: A God with Human Flaws

Death doesn’t just kill. It:

* **Lies without consequence** (through signs, myths, and survivor “rules”).
* **Gives false hope** to maximize despair.
* **Holds grudges across generations** (*Bloodlines’ identical vision proves Death remembers*).
* **Writes stories** where irony and cruelty matter more than efficiency.

Death isn’t a force of balance. It’s a sadistic storyteller. It wants you to believe you have a chance—then laugh when you fail.

**TL;DR:**  
Death isn’t trying to fix anything. It’s playing with its food. Every vision, every fake rule, every false sense of safety—it’s all part of a psychological game designed to make the final kill taste sweeter.",10,1755239885.0,FinalDestination,4,1.0,False

I learned that as we grow older, true friendships are hard to come by and even harder to maintain. Being an adult, most of my friends are getting married, having kids, and I? I'm currently getting coffee. Unlike Rachel though, fortunately, it's for myself. How good would it be to share that with friends while conversing about anything and everything we have in mind-hobbies, passions, rants, whatever our heart desires.

I'm not looking for quick greetings and talks about the weather. I want someone who'll stimulate my mind and force me to think and speak, comfortably. I know that it won't always work out but hey, there's no harm in trying.

Recently I've started to become friends with the manager of the local coffee shop, Chelsea. We both live in the same small town and run into each other everywhere. Lately we've started to bond over our shared love of tattoos. I've gotten a few new ones over the last year and when they're complete, I stop over to grab a coffee and show her my new artwork. 

Well today I stopped at the coffee shop on my way to an appointment and Chelsea said ""Hey! Omg there's a woman who stops in here all the time who says she's your friend. At first I thought it was you because you sound alike. She's a stylist, right?"" I'm like ""oh yeah, Amber! She's my best friend!"". Anyway, Chelsea then says ""yeah, the other day I ran into her and she said you've been trying to talk her into getting a tattoo for years, but she can't commit because it's so permanent."" To which I responded ""weird. I've never tried to talk her into getting inked. When she sees my tattoos she always says 'god, I love your tattoos. They make me really want to get one'."" 

Later when I got home I told my husband about it and told him that it really bothered me that Amber would say that. He didn't understand why it would upset me. I told him I'm hurt and confused because not only have I never done that, but I don't like her telling people that I would try to push her into something she wouldn't want. In fact, when she told me she wanted one and what she wanted to get, I told her she should think on it because it is permanent, but I support whatever choice she makes, whether she gets one or not. Now I'm supposed to hang out with her tomorrow and now I'm not sure I want to. Idk if I should confront her, apologize if she thought I was pushing her into that or just ignore it. I've heard my fair share of BS come out of my bestie's mouth when she gets to talking, but I never thought it would be about me. AIO?",3,1755239746.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False

Hey everyone,

Posting here since I thought I'd give this a try and put myself out there. :) looking for someone childfree, and in Canada. (ideally BC, but anywhere in Canada is lovely). Big believer in the DINK lifestyle.

A little bit about me: 

• My idea of a perfect day would be trying out a nice restaurant along with seeing a movie at the theatre. I am a bit of a foodie and love exploring new places. Though I also love a nice time indoors like watching a movie at home, reading a book & learning new recipes to cook. 

• I am ambitious and am thankful to say I am in a field I am passionate about. That being said I love simplicity and find comfort in routine, whether it be going for walks, getting coffee, or catching the sunset by the pier.

• Some of my all time favorite movies are ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Dodgeball"", and my favorite shows are ""The Simpsons"", ""Family Guy"" and ""The Good Place"" Always open to new movie and TV show suggestions! For the holiday season, my go-to movie is ""It's A Wonderful Life""

If I sound like your kind of person, I would love to hear from you!

I’ve applied to 400ish jobs and usually get ghosted. Warehouses, fast food, movie theaters, coffee shops, Amazon, FedEx, USPS, etc. 

Could be because I barely have any experience at 22. I spent my summers as a mover and the academic year as a part-time dishwasher, plus a teaching assistant for two semesters. That’s it.

I have a clean record and no social media presence. 

Got a BA in political science (my fault, I take full responsibility), which is as useful as the plastic rose bouquet in my grandma’s dining room.

Currently doing ubereats, doordash, and a credit card to make ends meet. It barely covers rent (with 3 roommates) and I make do with sardines, eggs, and veggies. I cancelled my health insurance plan and reduced my car’s insurance policy down to liability. 

Might as well just go for the army or air force? Not sure if it’s too late for that at 22, what are your thoughts?

I had loving parents and a handsome, successful fiancé. I was safe. I was loved. It was a perfect, fragile lie.



The lie shattered on a Tuesday when I discovered my fiancé, Ivan, wasn't at a board meeting but at a sprawling mansion with Kiera Reese, the woman I was told had a mental breakdown five years ago after trying to frame me.



She wasn't disgraced; she was radiant, holding a little boy, Leo, who giggled in Ivan's arms. 



I overheard their conversation: Leo was their son, and I was merely a ""placeholder,"" a means to an end until Ivan no longer needed my family's connections. My parents, the Donovans, were in on it, funding Kiera's lavish life and their secret family.



My entire reality-the loving parents, the devoted fiancé, the security I thought I'd found-was a carefully constructed stage, and I was the fool playing the lead role. The casual lie Ivan texted me, ""Just got out of the meeting. So ex\*\*usting. I miss you. See you at home,"" while he stood beside his real family, was the final blow.



They thought I was pathetic. They thought I was a fool. They were about to find out just how wrong they were.





Chapter 1

Five years. That's how long they told me Kiera Reese had been gone. Five years since she'd had a supposed mental breakdown after trying to frame me for leaking corporate secrets, a move that nearly destroyed my medical career. My fiancé, Ivan Hughes, and my parents, the Donovans, had assured me she was sent away to get help, disgraced and removed from our lives forever.



I believed them. I was Aliana Donovan, a resident physician, finally reunited with the wealthy family I'd been lost from as a child. I had loving parents and a handsome, successful fiancé. I was safe. I was loved. It was a perfect, fragile lie.



The lie shattered on a Tuesday.



Ivan was supposed to be at a board meeting. He had texted me, ""Thinking of you. It's going to be a long night. Don't wait up."" 



But I wanted to surprise him. I had just finished a grueling 36-hour shift at the hospital and drove to his office building, Hughes Biomedical, with his favorite takeout. The security guard in the lobby gave me a polite smile. ""Mr. Hughes left about an hour ago, Dr. Donovan."" 



A cold knot formed in my stomach. I called his phone. It rang once, then went to voicemail. I tried the tracker on his car, a feature I'd only ever used once when he'd misplaced it in a massive parking garage. The glowing dot on my phone screen wasn't anywhere near his usual routes. It was heading toward a gated community on the other side of town, a place I'd never even heard of.



I drove, my hands tight on the steering wheel. The cold knot in my stomach grew, tightening with every mile. The address led me to a sprawling modern mansion, lights blazing, music spilling out into the manicured gardens. It looked like a party.



I parked down the street and walked toward the house. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, I saw a scene that didn't make sense. And then, I saw him. My fiancé, Ivan. He wasn't in a suit. He was in casual clothes, a relaxed smile on his face.



He was holding a little boy on his shoulders, maybe four or five years old. The boy was giggling, his small hands tangled in Ivan's dark hair.



And then I saw the woman standing next to them, her hand resting on Ivan's arm.



Kiera Reese.



She wasn't disgraced. She wasn't in a treatment facility. She was radiant, dressed in a silk gown, looking every bit the happy mother and partner. She laughed, a sound I remembered with a shudder, and leaned in to k\*\*s Ivan on the cheek. He turned his head and ki\*\*ed her back, a familiar, loving gesture that he had used with me just that morning.



My breath hitched. The world tilted on its axis. I stumbled back into the shadows of a large oak tree, my body trembling.



I could hear their voices through the slightly open patio door.



""Leo is getting so big,"" Kiera said, her voice dripping with contentment. ""He looks more like you every day."" 



""He has his mother's charm,"" Ivan replied, his voice warm with an affection I now realized I had never truly received. He lifted the boy, Leo, off his shoulders and set him down.



""Are you sure Aliana doesn't suspect anything?"" Kiera asked, her tone shifting slightly. ""Five years is a long time to keep this up."" 



""She doesn't have a clue,"" Ivan said, his voice laced with a casual cruelty that stole the air from my lungs. ""She's so grateful to have a family, she'd believe anything we tell her. It's almost sad."" 



""Poor, pathetic Aliana,"" Kiera sneered. ""Still thinks you're going to marry her. Still thinks Mommy and Daddy Donovan love their real daughter more than me."" 



Ivan laughed. It wasn't a nice sound. ""They feel guilty. That's all. They know they owe you. We all do. This house, this life... it's the least we could do to make up for what you  'went through'."" 



He said ""went through"" with air quotes. The whole story of her breakdown was a performance. A lie they all participated in.



I felt a wave of nausea. My parents. They were in on it, too. The money for this lavish life, this secret family, it came from them. From the Donovan fortune that was supposed to be mine.



My entire reality-the loving parents, the devoted fiancé, the security I thought I'd finally found after a childhood in foster care-was a carefully constructed stage. And I was the fool playing the lead role, unaware that the rest of the cast was laughing at me behind the curtain.



I backed away slowly, my movements wooden. I got into my car, my body shaking so hard I could barely turn the key in the ignition. My phone buzzed in my lap. It was a text from Ivan.



 ""Just got out of the meeting. So exhausting. I miss you. See you at home."" 



The casual lie, typed out while he stood beside his real family, was the final blow. The world didn't just tilt; it crumbled into dust around me.



I drove away, not toward our shared apartment, but toward a future they couldn't control. The grief was a physical weight, crushing my ch\*\*t. But beneath it, a tiny, hard ember of resolve began to glow.



They thought I was pathetic. They thought I was a fool.



They were about to find out just how wrong they were.





Chapter 2

The next morning, I walked into the apartment I shared with Ivan. He was in the kitchen, making coffee, looking handsome and completely untroubled.



""You're home early,"" he said, smiling as he turned to k\*\*s me. I flinched, turning my head so his lips landed on my cheek.



""Tired,"" I mumbled, using the excuse I knew he'd expect after a long shift. ""The drive back was rough."" 



""Poor baby,"" he said, wrapping his arms around me. His embrace felt like a cage. Every word, every touch was a lie. ""My meeting ran so late. We should do something to celebrate the deal closing. And... it's been five years."" 



I looked at him, my expression carefully blank. ""Five years since what?"" 



""Since Kiera... left,"" he said, his eyes full of fake sympathy. ""I know it was hard on you, what she did. I thought maybe we, and your parents, could have a quiet dinner. To mark the occasion. To celebrate how far we've come."" 



The audacity was breathtaking. They wanted to celebrate the anniversary of the lie they'd built around me. I felt a cold, sharp anger slice through the pain.



""That's... a thoughtful idea, Ivan,"" I said, my voice steady. ""Let's do that."" 



His face lit up with relief. ""Great. I'll let your parents know. They'll be so happy you're in a good place about it."" 



He was so sure of me, so confident in his deception. He left for work, whistling, leaving me alone in the sterile, beautiful apartment that now felt like a prison. The moment the door closed, I went straight to his office.



It was always locked. He'd told me it was because of sensitive work documents. I used to respect that. Now, I knew it was a vault for his secrets. But I was a doctor. I knew about pressure points, about finding weaknesses. And I knew Ivan. His password wasn't complex; it was arrogant. It was the date he proposed to me.



I typed it in. The lock clicked open.



The room was pristine, dominated by a large mahogany desk. I started there. In a locked drawer, I found a small, leather-bound photo album. My hands trembled as I opened it.



It wasn't filled with pictures of us. It was picture after picture of Ivan, Kiera, and their son, Leo. At the park, on a beach, celebrating birthdays with cakes and candles. A perfect, happy family. In one photo, my parents were there, too. My mother was holding Leo, beaming, while my father stood with his arm around Kiera. They looked happier in that stolen moment than I had ever seen them with me.



The evidence was damning, but I needed more. I turned to his laptop. The password was the same. His files were meticulously organized. I found a folder labeled ""Personal."" Inside, another folder: ""L."" 



It was everything. Videos of Leo's first steps. His first words. Scans of his birth certificate, listing Ivan as the father. And a subfolder named ""Finances."" 



I clicked it open and my bl\*\*d ran cold. There were monthly wire transfers from a joint account belonging to my parents, Richard and Eleanor Donovan, to a shell corporation. The amounts were staggering. Millions of dollars over five years. The memo line on each one was the same: ""K.R. Living Expenses."" 



They hadn't just enabled this; they had funded it. Every kind word they'd ever said to me, every expensive gift, every hollow promise of family, was paid for with the same money they used to prop up the woman who tried to ruin me and the secret family my fiancé was raising with her.



The illusion of their love wasn't just a lie; it was a transaction. I was the price they paid to soothe their guilt over Kiera.



I copied everything onto a small, encrypted flash drive. Every photo, every video, every bank statement. As the files transferred, my phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number.



""Having fun playing detective? You'll never find anything. They love me, Aliana. They always have. You were just a convenient replacement."" 



It was Kiera. She must have had a hidden camera in the office. The thought made my skin crawl.



She sent a picture. It was of the family photo I had just seen, the one with my parents.



""We look good together, don't we? Like a real family."" 



Another message followed. ""Ivan is only with you out of pity. And your parents? They're just paying their dues. You'll always be the outsider, the girl from the foster home who doesn't belong."" 



The taunts were meant to break me. And they did, for a moment. I leaned against the desk, the flash drive clutched in my hand, and a single, hot tear of rage and grief rolled down my cheek.



But then, the grief hardened into something else. Something cold and clear.



She was wrong. I wasn't going to break. I was going to burn their whole world to the ground.





Chapter 3

Kiera's message was a declaration of war. She thought she was untouchable, hidden away in her gilded cage. She didn't know I had the key.



I needed to get inside that house one more time, not just for evidence, but to see the truth with my own eyes, to hear it from their own mouths, unfiltered. The flash drive had the what, but I needed the why.



Bribing a servant was the obvious choice. I reviewed the financial records I'd copied. Kiera's household staff was paid through the shell corporation, but one name stood out-a cleaning service that was paid a surprisingly low, flat monthly fee. A company that likely underpaid its workers. I found their website and the name of the manager. A few thousand dollars, transferred from a burner account, was all it took to get me a uniform and a spot on the next day's cleaning crew for the mansion.



The next afternoon, I pulled up to the service entrance in a nondescript van with three other women. I wore a plain blue uniform, a baseball cap pulled low, and a disposable face mask. I kept my head down and my mouth shut.



The housekeeper, a tired-looking woman named Maria, let us in. She barely glanced at me. ""Upstairs bedrooms and the master suite. Be quick. Mrs. Reese doesn't like to be disturbed."" 



I was assigned to the master suite. The room was enormous, with a stunning view of the city. But I wasn't interested in the view. I was interested in the life they had built here. On the bedside table was a silver frame. It held a picture of Ivan and Kiera on their wedding day. They weren't officially married, of course-Ivan was engaged to me. This was a lie within a lie, a ceremony just for them, a fantasy they lived out in secret.



I moved through the house, cleaning mechanically, my eyes scanning everything. The walls were covered in family portraits. Leo on a pony. Kiera and Ivan laughing on a boat. My father, Richard Donovan, a renowned architect, had designed this house. My mother, Eleanor Donovan, a high-society philanthropist, had decorated it. Her signature taste was everywhere.



I found Maria in the kitchen, wiping down the counters. I kept my voice low and disguised. ""It's a beautiful home. They seem like a very happy family."" 



Maria sighed, not looking at me. ""They are. Mr. Hughes adores that boy. And Mr. Donovan... he's here more than he's at his own home. Taught little Leo how to draw. Says the boy has his talent."" 



The words were a physical blow. My father had never offered to teach me anything. I had begged him to teach me calligraphy, his passion, but he always said he was too busy. He wasn't too busy for Leo.



""And Mrs. Donovan?"" I asked, my voice tight.



""Oh, she spoils Kiera rotten,"" Maria said, shaking her head. ""Brings her new jewelry every week. Says Kiera is the daughter she always wanted, so spirited and strong."" 



The daughter she always wanted. Not me. Not the real daughter who had spent years dreaming of a mother's love.



My stomach churned. I had to get out of there. As I turned to leave the kitchen, I heard the sound of a car in the driveway. A sleek black sedan. Ivan's car.



""They're home early!"" Maria hissed, her eyes wide with panic. ""Quick, hide! In the pantry! They can't see you here after hours."" 



She shoved me into the dark, narrow pantry just as the back door opened. I pressed myself against the shelves, my heart pounding against my ribs. Through the slatted door, I could see them. Ivan, Kiera, and Leo.



Leo was crying. ""But I wanted the blue one!"" 



""I know, sweetie, I know,"" Kiera cooed, st\*\*king his hair. ""Daddy will get you the blue one tomorrow, won't you, Daddy?"" 



""Of course,"" Ivan said. He knelt down and looked at Kiera, his face etched with concern. ""Are you okay, though? You looked pale at the store."" 



""I'm fine,"" Kiera said, but her voice was weary. ""Just tired. It's hard, Ivan. Pretending all the time. Waiting for you to finally get rid of her."" 



My breath caught in my throat.



Ivan stood up and pulled Kiera into his arms. He ki\*\*ed her forehead. ""I know, my love. I know it's not fair to you. But we have to be careful. Just a little longer. Once the new merger is complete, I won't need her family's connections anymore. I'll end it. I promise. Then we can be a real family, out in the open."" 



""You promise?"" she whispered.



""I promise,"" he said, his voice a low, in\*\*mate vow. ""You and Leo are my entire world. Aliana... she's just a means to an end. A placeholder."" 



A placeholder.



The word echoed in the silent pantry. That's all I was. A tool he was using. A temporary fix until he got what he wanted. The love, the engagement, our entire life together-it was a business transaction.



I squeezed my eyes shut, fighting the bile that rose in my throat. I had all the proof I needed. I had the photos, the bank statements, and now, the raw, undeniable truth from his own lips.



I waited until they moved into the living room, their laughter echoing down the hall. I slipped out of the pantry, nodded a silent thank you to a terrified-looking Maria, and walked out the service door without a backward glance.



As I was rounding the corner of the house, heading for the street, Kiera stepped out onto the patio for a phone call. She saw me. Her eyes narrowed, a flicker of recognition in them even with my disguise. She didn't know who I was, but she knew I didn't belong.



""Hey, you!"" she called out. ""What are you still doing here?"" 



I didn't answer. I just picked up my pace, my heart hammering. I couldn't let her see my face. Not yet. The game wasn't over. It had just begun.





Chapter 4

Kiera's suspicion was a dangerous spark. I couldn't risk another close call. The next morning, Maria called me on my burner phone, her voice trembling.



""Mrs. Reese was asking about the new girl. She said you looked familiar. I told her you were my cousin, just filling in for the day. I think she believed me, but she's watching everyone now."" 



""You did well, Maria,"" I said, my voice calm. ""Here's what you do now. Quit. I've deposited a year's salary into your account. Disappear for a while."" 



There was a choked sob on the other end of the line. ""Thank you. God bless you."" 



The line went dead. One loose end tied up. Now for the rest.



I called my best friend, Debi Frost. She wasn't just my friend; she was a shark of a lawyer, the sharpest mind I knew. We met at a noisy downtown coffee shop, a place where no one would notice us.



I laid it all out. The secret house, the child, the five-year lie. I slid the flash drive across the table. Her face, usually so animated, became a mask of cold fury as she listened.



""Those ba\*\*ards,"" she breathed, her knuckles white as she gripped her coffee cup. ""All of them. Your parents, too. Aliana, we are going to destroy them."" 



""I don't want to destroy them, Debi,"" I said quietly. ""I just want to disappear. I want to leave them behind with the truth of what they've done."" 



""Leave? Aliana, you're entitled to half of Ivan's assets, not to mention a massive settlement from your parents for the emotional distress..."" 



""I don't want their money,"" I said, the words tasting like ash. ""Their money is what they used to buy my silence, my compliance. It's tainted. I want nothing from them."" 



Debi studied my face, then nodded slowly. ""Okay. If that's what you want. A clean break. We can do that. We'll prepare the divorce papers, cite infidelity. And a document renouncing any claim to the Donovan family inheritance. We'll make it airtight."" 



As we were planning, my phone buzzed. It was an email from my mother's assistant about the ""anniversary"" dinner Ivan had proposed. The location was set: a private room at The Oak Room, the same restaurant where Ivan and I had our first date. The irony was so thick it was suffocating.



But it was a detail at the bottom of the email that made my bl\*\*d run cold. Debi saw my expression and leaned closer. ""What is it?"" 



I read it aloud, my voice barely a wh\*\*per. ""Please confirm Dr. Donovan's dietary restrictions. The chef notes her mild allergy to benzodiazepines from her hospital records."" 



Debi's eyes widened in horror. ""Benzos? They're going to d\*\*g you?"" 



It clicked into place. The dinner wasn't a celebration. It was a trap. They were afraid that on the anniversary of their great deception, I might finally get emotional, or suspicious. They were going to sedate me, just to make sure their evening went smoothly, to ensure the placeholder didn't cause a scene.



The last flicker of hope that maybe, just maybe, there was some twisted, misguided love behind their actions died. This was pure, calculated cruelty.



I started to laugh. It was a hollow, broken sound that had nothing to do with humor. ""Of course,"" I said, shaking my head. ""Of course, they would."" 



Debi reached across the table and grabbed my hand. Her grip was firm, grounding. ""Aliana, you can't go."" 



""Oh, I'm going,"" I said, my eyes hard. ""I'm going to let them think their plan is working perfectly. And then, I'm going to vanish."" 



That afternoon, in Debi's office, I signed the papers. The divorce petition. The legal renunciation of the Donovan name and fortune. With each st\*\*ke of the pen, I felt a chain breaking. I was cutting myself free.



I went online and booked a one-way ticket to a small, coastal town in Oregon under a new name, a name I hadn't used since I was a child in the system, before they found me. A name that was truly mine. The flight was for Saturday night, the night of Leo's fifth birthday party. The party I wasn't invited to. The party that would serve as my grand finale.



When I got back to the apartment, Ivan was there, humming as he packed an overnight bag.



""Just a quick business trip,"" he said, not meeting my eyes. ""Have to fly out tonight, back tomorrow afternoon. Just in time for our dinner."" 



I knew where he was going. He was going to Kiera's. To his son's birthday eve.



""Be safe,"" I said, my voice soft.



He ki\*\*ed me, a quick, dismissive peck on the cheek. ""I love you,"" he said.



""I know,"" I replied, the words a hollow echo.



That night, I lay alone in our bed, the sheets cold beside me. For the first time in five years, the loneliness didn't hurt. It felt like freedom. I was no longer Aliana Donovan, the long-lost daughter, the happy fiancée. I was a ghost in my own life, counting down the hours until I could finally disappear.





Chapter 5

The night of the dinner arrived. The night of my departure. My mother, Eleanor, fussed over my dress, her smile painted on.



""You look beautiful, darling. So elegant."" 



My father, Richard, stood by, looking proud. ""Ready for our special night?"" 



They were actors giving the performance of their lives. I was the audience of one, and I knew the whole script.



We sat in the private room at The Oak Room. The air was thick with unspoken words. My mother placed a small bowl of soup in front of me. ""The chef made his specialty just for you. A creamy mushroom bisque."" 



I could smell it. The faint, almost undetectable almond scent of the benzodiazepine mixed in. They didn't even try to be creative. They were arrogant.



""Thank you, Mother,"" I said, picking up my spoon. I looked at her, then at my father. ""It means so much that you're all here. That we can finally put the past behind us."" 



Their faces softened with relief. I was playing my part perfectly. I took a spoonful of the soup. Then another. I ate half the bowl, my stomach clenching with each swallow, not from the d\*\*g, but from the betrayal.



After a few minutes, I pressed a hand to my forehead. ""I'm feeling a little... dizzy. I think the shift at the hospital finally caught up with me."" 



""Oh, you poor thing,"" Eleanor said, her concern a masterpiece of fiction. ""Of course. You should rest."" 



""Would you mind if I just... went to the powder room for a moment?"" I asked, my voice intentionally weak.



""Go, go,"" Richard urged. ""We'll be right here."" 



I gave them one last look. My parents. The people who were supposed to love me unconditionally.



""Were you ever sorry?"" I asked, the question slipping out before I could stop it. ""For what happened to me? For all the years I was gone?"" 



They stared at me, their smiles faltering. There was a flicker of something in their eyes-guilt, maybe-but it was quickly extinguished.



""Of course, we were, Aliana,"" my father said, his voice a little too firm. ""Every single day."" 



A lie. Another one. I didn't press. I just nodded. ""I'm glad."" 



I walked toward the back of the restaurant, my steps steady. Once inside the empty, opulent bathroom, I locked the door, knelt before the toilet, and forced myself to throw up, my body convulsing until the soup and the poison were gone. I rinsed my mouth, my face pale but my eyes clear in the mirror.



The dizziness was an act, but the nausea was real.



When I returned to the apartment I had once shared with Ivan, he was waiting. He was dressed for the party, Kiera's party, his face glowing with anticipation. He held out a glass of champagne.



""A toast,"" he said, smiling. ""To us. To our future."" 



I saw the fine powder lingering at the bottom of my glass. A second dose. They were making sure.



I played the part of the smitten fiancée one last time. ""To us,"" I echoed, my voice light and airy. I let him think I was dizzy from the dinner, leaning on him slightly.



""I have to go to the hospital for a bit,"" he said, the lie rolling off his tongue with practiced ease. ""An emergency consult. I'll be back as late as I can."" 



""Don't worry about me,"" I said. I took the glass of champagne and, looking him directly in the eye, drank it all down in one go. His smile widened. He thought he had won.



""I'll see you later,"" he said, giving me a quick k\*\*s. He walked out the door without a second glance. He never looked back.



The moment he was gone, I ran to the bathroom and purged the champagne, my body shaking with the effort. When I was done, I felt strangely calm. Cleansed.



I changed into simple, dark clothing. I walked into the living room, where a single, elegantly wrapped gift box sat on the coffee table. I had prepared it that afternoon.



I called the butler from the Donovan estate, a man who had shown me small kindnesses over the years. ""James,"" I said. ""I have a package that needs to be delivered to the party at 10 p.m. precisely. Not before, not after. Can you do that for me?"" 



""Of course, Dr. Donovan,"" he said, his voice steady.



Inside the box was the flash drive, a small portable speaker, and a single, handwritten card.



My final stop was a quiet street overlooking the secret mansion. The party was in full swing. I could see them all through the windows-Ivan, Kiera, Leo, my parents-laughing, celebrating a life built on my pain. They looked so happy.



My phone buzzed. A message from Debi. ""Wheels up in 30. You're free."" 



I looked at the scene one last time, a tableau of their perfect, fake happiness. I felt nothing. No anger, no sadness. Just a profound, empty peace.



I dropped my phone into a storm drain, the screen shattering on the concrete below. I had already canceled the number, wiped the data.



Aliana Donovan was gone. I turned my back on the glittering mansion and walked toward the airport, toward my new life, without looking back.

I noticed he was already in there (it wasn't raining or wet outside) then I went to his table. As I'm walking there I get stopped and asked what I want. I say I will come back to order and I met him. That's when we already got into much conversation and then he was served his already ordered coffee!?! I wasn't sure if they did table service but nobody came up or asked me if I am ready to order. Soo, I was waiting for the opportunity to stop him from talking to say ""Hey, I'm going to order something. Do you want anything?"" But I didn't have that opportunity as we got into much conversation and he talked a lot which was good. I was a little upset that I wasn't able to order a drink or food and that he ordered before I even arrived!? He also explained how he first went to the wrong spot and walked 20 minutes to the cafe... Still making it early and ordering ahead a drink without me being there.
For most of the date he talked about himself and didn't ask me much about myself. I asked him a lot about himself. Then he'd randomly always seem to talk about family and negative things. He got deeply at one stage before we parted ways and then asked me if I have or do go to therapy after he told me about how he's going to therapy and gets a lot of sessions for free. I told him I've had therapy before and have had help and seen people but didn't get into detail as he cut me off and I wasn't keen to get deep when we've just met and we'll he talked a lot and I wasn't really given much opportunity to talk. I appreciate a man who enjoys talking but he seemed to not let me ask many questions nor ask much about me. It's like he chose to steer the conversations and take the lead. If I started talking it would've seemed rude and as if I were interrupting hence why I didn't talk much.

Honestly. I've never had anyone whether they be a friend, family or even a date order before I get there, let alone sit down inside and wait for me. Usually a first date/meet and mostly everyone I've encountered will meet me out the front of the place if not inside naturally and we go in together and order together at the table or individually.


Maybe he was avoiding paying. Not that I make the man pay. I like paying for myself.

## Key Features Analysis

The best under cabinet power strips in 2025 offer a blend of safety features, convenient power delivery, and sleek designs that complement any space.

**Number of outlets & USB Ports:**

The number of outlets and USB ports is a crucial factor to consider. A well-designed power strip should offer a sufficient number of standard AC outlets to accommodate multiple appliances or tools. Additionally, the inclusion of USB-A and USB-C ports allows for direct charging of mobile devices, tablets, and other gadgets without needing bulky adapters. A power strip with at least 3 AC outlets and 2 USB ports provides a good balance for most users.

**Safety Certifications:**

Safety should always be a top priority. Look for power strips that have been certified by reputable safety organizations such as UL (Underwriters Laboratories) or ETL (Intertek). These certifications ensure that the power strip has undergone rigorous testing to meet specific safety standards, including protection against electrical hazards, overheating, and fire.Certified products will typically have markings clearly displaying compliance.

**Mounting Options:**

The ease and versatility of mounting are critical for under cabinet power strips. Effective mounting solutions should allow for secure attachment to various surfaces without causing damage. Some models come with adhesive strips for rapid installation, while others utilize screw mounts for a more permanent and stable setup. Detachable mounting brackets can also simplify the installation process, allowing you to easily remove the power strip for cleaning or maintenance.

**Surge Protection & Overload Protection:**

Protecting your devices from power surges and overloads is essential. A high-quality power strip should incorporate robust surge protection to safeguard sensitive electronics from voltage spikes caused by lightning strikes or power grid fluctuations. Overload protection is another crucial feature that automatically shuts off the power strip if the connected devices draw more current than it can safely handle, preventing overheating and potential fire hazards.

**Sleek & Low-Profile Design:**

Aesthetically, the power strip should blend seamlessly with the underside of your cabinets without being obtrusive. look for models with a slim and low-profile design that minimizes visual clutter. The color and finish should also complement your existing décor. Options like brushed aluminum, matte black, or white finishes are versatile and can easily integrate into various design schemes.

## Core Benefits

Under cabinet power strips offer several practical benefits that enhance the functionality and convenience of your workspace or kitchen.

**Increased Countertop space:** By shifting power outlets from the wall to under the cabinet, these power strips free up valuable countertop space. Kitchens especially benefit, as more space becomes available for food preparation and small appliances. This clutter-free habitat contributes to a more organized and efficient workspace.

**Convenient Power Access:** Having power outlets directly where you need them, without having to reach for distant wall outlets, considerably enhances convenience.This is especially useful for operating kitchen appliances like blenders, coffee makers, or toasters without creating a web of cords across your countertop. The strategic placement of power strips under cabinets makes it easier to plug and unplug devices as needed.

**Enhanced Organization:** Under cabinet power strips help maintain a clean and organized space by minimizing the visibility of cords. By running cords along the underside of cabinets, you can conceal them from view, reducing visual clutter and creating a more streamlined appearance. This contributes to a more aesthetically pleasing and functional workspace.

**Improved Safety:** Integrated surge protection and overload protection features safeguard your electronic devices from damage caused by power fluctuations. This added layer of safety ensures that your appliances and gadgets are protected from unexpected power surges or overloads, preventing costly repairs or replacements. Additionally, keeping cords off the countertop reduces the risk of tripping hazards and accidental spills.

## faqs Section

**Can under cabinet power strips be used in damp environments like kitchens?**
Yes, but it’s crucial to select a power strip specifically designed for kitchen use. Look for models that are moisture-resistant or have a splash-proof design to protect against spills and humidity. Ensure that the power strip is UL-listed for wet or damp locations. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding safe usage in damp environments.

**How do I install an under cabinet power strip?**
Installation typically involves using either adhesive strips or screw mounts. Adhesive strips offer a quick and easy installation method, while screw mounts provide a more secure and permanent attachment. Before installing, thoroughly clean the underside of the cabinet to ensure proper adhesion. Use a level to ensure the power strip is mounted straight. If using screw mounts, pre-drill pilot holes to prevent splitting the wood.

**What is the maximum wattage an under cabinet power strip can handle?**
The maximum wattage varies depending on the specific model. Check the product specifications to determine the maximum wattage and amperage rating. It’s crucial not to exceed this limit to prevent overloading the power strip,which can create a fire hazard. Typically, under cabinet power strips can handle between 1200 and 1800 watts.

**Are under cabinet power strips code-compliant?**
under cabinet power strips are generally code-compliant provided that they are installed according to the manufacturer's instructions and meet the electrical codes in your region. It's essential to use a UL-listed or ETL-listed power strip, indicating that it has been tested and certified for safety. Consult with a licensed electrician if you have any questions or concerns about compliance with local electrical codes.

After their plan succeeded, he cornered her against a wall, his voice almost pitiful. ""I helped you take down those people. Don't you think you owe me some time alone?"" She froze, stunned. Had their alliance turned into something else?  
=====  
""You've weathered countless storms over the years. Welcome home, Arabella.""  
At the celebratory dinner, a young man in a perfectly tailored suit found himself unwilling to look away from Arabella Stanley.   
She possessed an otherworldly beauty, her sharp features sculpted with precision and wrapped in an aura of cool detachment.   
Her piercing eyes revealed nothing of her inner thoughts, and when she spoke, her voice carried the same arctic chill. ""I'm leaving now.""  
Joshua Willis, the young man, seized the moment without hesitation. ""Allow me to drive you home.""  
Arabella offered no resistance.   
The car glided through the night. The city lights blurred past as Joshua stole glances at her profile.  
""When do you plan to return to the company? Our empire continues to flourish.""  
Their partnership had begun years ago through a chance project, and Joshua had witnessed Arabella's brilliance firsthand.   
He had persuaded her to join forces, and together they had forged a company that now dominated the entire industry.   
  
Arabella maintained her measured tone. ""I'll decide when the time feels right. For now, I simply want to reach home.""  
  
""Understood completely. You must be eager to reunite with Daisy. She's undoubtedly thriving. I've been directing all the premium projects to your aunt's husband throughout these years."" Joshua's grin widened as he angled for recognition.   
  
Arabella and her twin sister Daisy Stanley had lost their parents at the tender age of six, and their aunt Meagan Tucker had stepped in to care for them both.   
  
Arabella acknowledged him with a subtle nod. ""I appreciate that.""  
  
Her delicate fingers found the cherry blossom pendant resting against her throat, clicking it open to reveal a treasured photograph of herself and Daisy.   
  
Arabella's expression remained stoic in the image, but Daisy's smile blazed with pure joy.   
  
Studying her sister's radiant face, Arabella felt an unfamiliar warmth soften her features.   
  
After their parents' tragic death, Arabella and Daisy had become each other's entire world. Daisy had always been their family's ray of sunshine, illuminating every room she entered.   
  
At twelve, Arabella had been handpicked by the government for a classified operation that consumed seven years of her life. Now that the mission had concluded, she could finally return to Daisy.   
  
She had forwarded nearly every government paycheck to her sister, ensuring Daisy lived in comfort and security.   
  
Joshua's eyes widened in amazement as he witnessed Arabella's smile.   
  
The legendary ice queen was actually smiling?   
  
His curiosity about Arabella's sister intensified dramatically.   
  
The car approached an upscale residential community, where each house boasted its own meticulously maintained garden.   
  
The vehicle glided to a stop in front of a house.   
  
This was the home Arabella's parents had bequeathed to them, now shared between Meagan and Daisy.   
  
The estate glowed with warm light, alive with the sound of cheerful laughter.   
  
Daisy seemed to be flourishing beautifully.   
  
With that thought in mind, Arabella preserved her gentle smile as she crossed into the front yard.   
  
A weathered doghouse sat in the corner of the property.   
  
Someone knelt beside it in the shadows.   
  
Through the dim evening light, Arabella couldn't distinguish the person's features, but she watched them scooping food directly from the bowl placed on the ground.   
  
Why would someone be eating beside the doghouse?   
  
Concern creased her brow as Arabella approached cautiously.   
  
The figure appeared startled and scrambled quickly into the doghouse.   
  
Arabella's bewilderment deepened. Then a soft, trembling voice drifted from within the shelter.  
  
""Please don't strike me again. I won't make any mistakes. I'll be so much more careful...""  
  
That voice belonged to Daisy.   
  
Arabella's heart shattered instantly. She lunged forward, pulling the figure from the doghouse. Even in the pale moonlight, she recognized her beloved sister immediately.   
  
Daisy stared back, her eyes swimming with disbelief. ""You..."" she breathed, as though she feared her mind was playing cruel tricks on her.   
  
""Daisy, is that truly you?"" Arabella's voice trembled with disbelief.   
  
When Daisy nodded weakly, a glacial fury erupted within Arabella, her eyes igniting with volcanic rage.   
  
""Bella..."" Daisy whispered, still trapped in shock. ""You've actually come back?""  
  
The moment felt impossibly surreal to Daisy, like a vision conjured from desperate longing.   
  
Arabella, sensing something terribly wrong, reached out to touch Daisy's forehead. Her skin burned with fever.   
  
Before Arabella could process this discovery, Daisy crumpled into her arms like a broken doll.   
  
Arabella cradled her sister, whose body felt heartbreakingly frail and ice-cold despite the raging fever consuming her.   
  
Arabella's heart crystallized into something harder than diamond.   
  
The front door of the house suddenly burst open with violent force.   
  
""Daisy, you worthless creature! It's been several minutes, and you're still not finished eating? Get inside immediately and wash those dishes!"" Meagan's voice sliced through the night air like a bl\*\*e.   
  
Arabella pivoted slowly, her predatory gaze locking onto her target.   
  
Meagan had transformed dramatically over the years.   
  
Once haggard and perpetually exhausted, she now radiated wealth and privilege, adorned in an expensive designer coat and gleaming jewelry that caught the porch light, presenting herself as the very embodiment of refined elegance.   
  
Meagan's bl\*\*d turned to ice under Arabella's lethal stare. ""You... Arabella? When did you arrive?""  
  
""What have you done to her?"" Arabella advanced with calculated steps, her voice dropping to a menacing whisper.   
  
Meagan instinctively retreated, unsettled by the predatory intensity burning in Arabella's eyes. But she quickly rallied her confidence, reminding herself that Arabella was still just a young woman.   
  
She twisted her lips into a cruel sneer. ""Daisy shattered a dish, so I administered appropriate punishment. You've been absent for years. Do you possess any understanding of how challenging life has been here? I never allowed her to starve or sleep without shelter. If you weren't my brother's daughters, I wouldn't have wasted my time with either of you.""  
  
In one fluid motion, Arabella's hand shot out and seized Meagan by the throat, her expression transforming into something carved from arctic stone.   
  
Meagan ga\*\*ed desperately, clawing at Arabella's iron grip. ""Let... me... go...""  
  
""This is my house,"" Arabella declared, her voice carrying the finality of a death sentence, her eyes radiating lethal intent.  
  
""You forced Daisy to perform menial labor. You made her sleep in that doghouse like an animal. You possess remarkable audacity, Meagan.""  
  
In the warm light streaming from the house, Arabella finally saw what Daisy had been consuming. It was the leftover food.   
  
Holding her sister, who felt as weightless as a dying bird and appeared ghostly pale and utterly drained, Arabella felt her heart shatter into countless pieces.   
  
Her precious sister had endured this nightmare!   
  
""Meagan,"" Arabella said, her voice saturated with deadly promise, ""when you moved into our home, you swore a sacred oath that you would care for Daisy.""  
  
Meagan bristled at Arabella's bold use of her first name, the disrespect cutting deep.   
  
But she shrank backward when she witnessed the murderous gleam dancing in Arabella's eyes.   
  
Arabella had always been fundamentally different from other children. She was cold and fearlessly bold.   
  
When Arabella had lived here, Meagan had performed the role of a dutiful aunt, though barely meeting even the lowest standards.   
  
But the moment Arabella departed, Meagan had seized absolute control, systematically crushing the gentle-spirited Daisy beneath her cruel authority.   
  
She had never imagined Arabella would return to witness her crimes.   
  
""I did take care of Daisy! She made a mistake, so I disciplined her accordingly. What's so terrible about that?""   
  
Meagan's words died in her throat as Arabella's grip tightened mercilessly, making her feel as though death itself was reaching for her soul.   
  
""Arabella?"" The violent commotion finally drew the attention of the people inside. Meagan's husband and daughter noticed the deadly confrontation unfolding at their door.   
  
Through the wide open front door, Arabella observed them living luxuriously in a spacious and magnificently decorated villa, with a table overflowing with exquisite delicacies.  
  
The people inside wore expensive clothing that spoke of comfort and abundance.   
  
Meanwhile, Daisy had been sleeping in a doghouse, consuming leftovers. Arabella's eyes burned with unshed tears as the devastating truth crashed over her with overwhelming force.   
  
Chapter 2 Can You Check Who Made The Payment  
Khloe Tucker was fuming.   
  
""Let go of my mom, Arabella! Back then, she offered to take care of you and Daisy out of kindness. Is that how you repay her? You show up after disappearing for years, acting like you're some kind of hero? What, did you run off, get pr\*\*nant, and have a kid or something? What a joke!""  
  
Khloe threw Arabella a nasty glare, but deep down, she actually hoped Arabella might stay. Having her back would mean more help around the house.   
  
But Arabella's eyes had already gone cold. Without saying a word, she entered the house and kicked the dining table hard.   
  
Dishes flew everywhere, crashing onto the floor and shattering into pieces.   
  
Before anyone could react, Arabella grabbed two vases and hurled them straight at Khloe and her father.   
  
They hit them squarely, and bl\*\*d started trickling down their faces as they screamed in shock.   
  
Her voice was ice. ""You've got one day. Get out of my house."" Without waiting for a reply, she stormed out with Daisy in her arms.   
  
She flagged down the first taxi she saw and rushed her sister straight to a hospital.   
  
Back at the villa, chaos broke out.   
  
""Mom! That psycho actually attacked me!"" Khloe sobbed, staring at the scratches on her face in the mirror. ""What if I'm left with scars?""  
  
Meagan's fury boiled over. ""She's gotten way too bold after all these years! If she shows her face again, she won't be so lucky. We're not nobodies anymore. We've joined hands with Norman Group. There's no way she can stand against us!""  
  
She gave Khloe a comforting pat. ""Don't worry, honey. I'm taking you to a hospital right now.""  
  
\*\*\*  
  
At the hospital, the doctor examined Daisy and frowned. ""Her leg's been broken for a while, and she's covered in bruises. Some of her teeth are missing too. What kind of sister lets this happen?""  
  
Arabella's voice was low. ""It's my fault.""  
  
Her bangs fell over her eyes, hiding whatever she was feeling inside.   
  
The doctor, noticing how quiet she was, spoke gently. ""I've done what I could for now. But if someone's been hurting you two, you need to report it. Keeping quiet won't fix anything.""  
  
Arabella gave a small nod and moved to stand beside Daisy's hospital bed.   
  
Daisy, now nineteen, looked heartbreakingly fragile. Her thin frame looked like it couldn't support itself, and her wrists seemed more like twigs than limbs.   
  
Her short hair was uneven, dry, and choppy, like someone had taken scissors to it without a second thought.   
  
Arabella gently lifted the blanket, and her heart dropped.   
  
Daisy's skin told a horrifying story. Old whip marks crisscrossed her legs, and dark burn spots marred her arms.  
  
Each scar screamed of cruelty. Arabella's breath caught, and before she could stop them, tears rolled down her cheeks.   
  
""Bella..."" Daisy's voice was barely a whisper.   
  
Arabella immediately reached for her hand. ""I'm here,"" she said softly.   
  
""I... missed you,"" Daisy murmured, her voice hoarse.   
  
Arabella clutched her hand like a lifeline. ""I missed you too. I thought if I worked hard, I could give you a better life. But I was wrong. I never should've left you alone. I swear, I'm not going anywhere again.""  
  
The warmth in Arabella's voice seemed to melt Daisy's tension. Slowly, her expression softened.   
  
After making sure Daisy was settled, Arabella went to sort out the payment.   
  
""The charges have already been covered,"" the nurse said with a kind smile.   
  
Arabella blinked. ""What? Who paid?""  
  
Joshua crossed her mind, but she quickly dismissed the thought. There was no way he knew about this yet.   
  
""Can you check who made the payment?"" she asked.   
  
The nurse gave an apologetic shake of the head. ""Sorry, that information's private. Maybe a family member helped out?""  
  
At the word family, Arabella's face turned to stone. She gave a short nod and walked off without another word. If someone had helped, she was going to find out who.   
  
Meanwhile, down the corridor, Meagan strolled beside her daughter, Khloe, who was fresh out of the emergency room with her face patched up.   
  
""I'm not letting Arabella walk away from this,"" Khloe snarled, bitterness burning in her voice.   
  
""Calm down,"" Meagan said sharply. ""You'll reopen your stitches if you keep flaring up like this. Be more like your sister--grace under pressure.""  
  
That seemed to cheer Khloe up. A smug smile tugged at her lips.  
  
""As long as my sister keeps shining, that's all that matters. She's the youngest dancer in the Griridge Troupe now. Daisy really thought she could outshine her? She was delusional. That broken leg was karma, if you ask me. And if my sister finds out how Arabella treated me--oh, she'll tear her apart.""  
  
""She's got a big show coming up,"" Meagan reminded her. ""Let's not distract her. One step at a time.""  
  
She tapped Khloe's nose lightly, but then her expression stiffened as she spotted Arabella ahead.   
  
Khloe saw Arabella too, and just the sight of her brought back the sting of humiliation. Her rage boiled over.   
  
Without thinking, she grabbed her studded handbag and swung it with all her strength toward Arabella's back.   
  
Arabella's instincts kicked in. Just as she turned around, a tall man came into view. With quick reflexes and strong arms, he grabbed the bag mid-air by its strap, stopping it like it was nothing.   
  
The sudden pull made Khloe lose her balance, and with a startled scream, she fell to the floor.   
  
Chapter 3 Grab Your Things And Come With Me  
""Khloe!"" Meagan hurried to her daughter's side, helping her up while shooting a vicious glare at the man who had shown up out of nowhere.   
  
""Who the h\*\*l are you? Arabella's new guy or what?""  
  
The man didn't bother responding. His sharp eyes gave nothing away, cold and unreadable, like the still, deep sea that hid its danger.   
  
Then he began walking toward Meagan, each step loud and heavy on the hospital floor.   
  
Meagan instinctively took a step back. Her ch\*\*t tightened, making it hard to breathe.   
  
Deep down, something told her this man wasn't just any stranger--he was trouble.   
  
Trying to mask her unease, she snapped, ""Arabella, you'd better think twice before crossing us again. You and your sister were lucky we let you stay at all! If you ever want back in, come crawling, and maybe we'll consider it.""  
  
Yanking Khloe's arm, Meagan stormed off.   
  
Arabella stood silently, watching them go. Let them stay? That house was legally Daisy's and hers.   
  
She glanced at the man and caught sight of a pi\*\*ol, just for a second, before it disappeared beneath his jacket. Her eyes narrowed slightly.   
  
Who was this guy?   
  
He turned and looked directly at her. Arabella finally saw his face--handsome as h\*\*l, rough around the edges, and those icy eyes didn't blink or soften for anyone.   
  
He gave off a vibe that screamed danger--Arabella had never felt anything like it.   
  
No surprise Meagan bolted--anyone with sense would have.   
  
""Arabella Stanley,"" he said. His tone was calm and low, but there was a chill in it that made her skin prickle.   
  
Arabella glanced him over. ""You're the one who paid for my sister, right?""  
  
He gave a faint nod. ""You're quick. Grab your things and come with me.""  
  
Arabella's brows drew together. ""Excuse me?""  
  
Who even was this guy, showing up with mystery and attitude?   
  
Before things got tenser, another man stepped in--less intimidating but equally serious.  
  
""Miss Stanley, allow me to explain. This is Mr. Asher Gordon. His father and your dad served together in the military. Before his father passed away, he asked Mr. Gordon to watch over your family. Mr. Gordon only recently returned from service and has been trying to track you down since.""  
  
That explained the military presence, the icy calm... the way he moved like someone trained for war.   
  
Arabella studied Asher again. He didn't seem threatening now, but just closed off, like someone with a wall too thick to climb over.   
  
She stayed calm. ""You got anything to back that up? Anyone can say that.""  
  
Asher reached into his pocket and pulled out a weathered photo.   
  
It showed two men in dusty uniforms--one was definitely her father. The other looked a lot like him.   
  
She stared at it for a long moment before replying, ""I'll think about it.""  
  
""Fair. Let's exchange numbers,"" Asher replied without any small talk.   
  
Arabella added his contact. His WhatsApp display was just a solid black box.   
  
Funny enough, hers was the same.   
  
A strange little coincidence, she thought.   
  
Then the assistant added her as well. ""Dominick Powell, Mr. Gordon's right hand. Reach out if you need help with anything, anytime.""  
  
Arabella gave a nod. ""Got it.""  
  
With that, the two men walked off, and Arabella made her way back to Daisy's room.   
  
Shortly after, two silent, suited bodyguards appeared at the door--they were clearly sent by Asher.   
  
Arabella didn't ask questions. She got to work helping Daisy clean up--changing her into fresh clothes and gently washing her hair, trying to fix its brittle, uneven mess.   
  
But when she saw the scars and ci\*\*rette burns covering Daisy's body, her eyes welled up again.   
  
Holding back her tears, she carefully rubbed her homemade cream onto the wounds. Then, without wasting a second, she opened her laptop.   
  
She had to find out what had happened to Daisy while she was gone, so she hacked into the villa's security system.   
  
Sadly, what she saw made her sick to her stomach.   
  
It wasn't long after Arabella left that Daisy was thrown out of her own bedroom and made to sleep in a doghouse.   
  
The cheerful, lively sister Arabella remembered didn't smile anymore.   
  
She saw footage of Daisy juggling multiple part-time jobs, only to get ha\*\*ssed and pushed around.   
  
Even so, she kept working hard and made it into one of the top universities. But during her very first semester, she ended up with a broken leg.   
  
She was studying dance, and just like that, the injury shattered everything she had dreamed of.   
  
The pieces fell into place too easily. Khloe's sister, Elissa Tucker, was in the same class. Arabella's gut told her that leg injury hadn't been some fluke.   
  
After that, Daisy barely left the house. She was treated like hired help, scrubbing floors, cooking meals, and still sleeping out in that d\*\*n doghouse.   
  
Yet every time Daisy texted her, it was the same lie. ""I'm doing fine. Don't worry about me. You just take care of yourself.""  
  
Arabella's vision blurred.   
  
While her sister was being broken piece by piece, their aunt's family was thriving. Their business had taken off, thanks to a lucrative deal with the Vanguard Group.   
  
Khloe, a middle school dropout, was suddenly a digital influencer. Elissa was famous and popular in the college.   
  
Meagan was rubbing shoulders with high-society ladies, and her husband had become some corporate hotshot.   
  
Arabella clenched her jaw and slammed her fist against the table. She didn't even feel the sting.   
  
Every bit of success she had worked for... had only served to feed that vile family's greed.   
  
And the one person she had sworn to protect had suffered in silence the entire time.   
  
Chapter 4 This Revenge Is Mine To Carry Out  
Arabella took a slow breath, wiped the tears from her cheeks, and her eyes turned cold, like a fire had been snuffed out and replaced with ice.  
  
Her fingers gripped her phone tightly as she made a call. ""That major project--it hasn't been handed over to the Tucker Group yet, right? Cancel it. Completely."" Her voice was calm but firm.  
  
""And get to the Griridge Hospital. Now.""  
  
On the other end, Joshua sounded startled. ""Arabella? What's going on?""  
  
""You'll see when you get here. Bring a few things with you.""  
  
True to form, Joshua didn't waste time. Less than half an hour later, he rushed into the hospital, and the moment his eyes landed on the girl in the hospital bed, he froze like a statue.  
  
She looked so much like Arabella--same face, but all color drained, bruised, battered, her body wrecked like it had been thrown away and forgotten.   
  
Joshua's fists clenched. ""Who did this? Tell me who it was. I'll make them pay, I swear it!""  
  
That was the sister of a preeminent figure... and they treated her like this?   
  
Arabella didn't flinch. ""I'll handle it myself. Slowly,"" she muttered, picking up a pair of sc\*\*sors from the table.   
  
Before Joshua could react, the sc\*\*sors had already cut through her long, silky hair. The strands dropped to the floor in silence.   
  
He stared, stunned. ""Arabella... you're not actually...""  
  
""I am,"" she said. ""This revenge is mine to carry out.""  
  
Joshua swallowed hard, goosebumps rising on his arms.   
  
The way she said it--it was clear. H\*\*l was coming for someone.   
  
Arabella glanced at him. ""Also, what do you know about the Gordons?""  
  
""The Gordon family?"" He immediately straightened.   
  
""They're legendary. Way beyond the top elite families. Super wealthy, but incredibly discreet. I've only ever worked with the right-hand man of their current CEO.""  
  
""You mean Dominick Powell?"" Arabella asked casually.   
  
Joshua's jaw dropped. ""Wait, you know Dominick? Don't tell me... are you saying the Gordons were involved in what happened to Daisy?""  
  
Arabella gave him a blank stare before calmly explaining Asher's connection and what he had said earlier. Joshua slapped his thigh, clearly overwhelmed.   
  
""Asher Gordon? If it's really him, then yeah, no one's faking that. He leads the family. Rumor has it he's ex-special forces, quiet as a ghost, but deadly. If someone crosses him, they don't get a second chance.""  
  
Arabella didn't react. She just stared at the floor, her thoughts turning in circles.   
  
Then she spoke, steady and cold. ""You should head out now. Also... sell my villa.""  
  
Joshua hesitated. ""That place... that's your parents' home. Are you sure?""  
  
Arabella looked over at Daisy's fragile frame. ""She was tortured in that house. There's no comfort left there. Just get rid of it.""  
  
Her voice cracked slightly. ""And if possible, find a buyer who's impossible to deal with.""  
  
Joshua gave her a long look, then nodded. ""Understood. I've got a bunch of properties lined up. If you ever need a place, it's yours.""  
  
""Thanks.""  
  
She didn't look up, and Joshua, sensing she needed space, quietly slipped out the door.   
  
Left alone, Arabella gently held Daisy's hand and murmured, ""I swear, everyone who hurt you... I'll make them pay for it tenfold.""  
  
That night felt endless, and sleep didn't come.   
  
The next morning, Arabella stood quietly outside a dance studio at Griridge University's dance department, listening through the open door.   
  
""Elissa, things have been so dull without that pathetic girl around,"" someone inside snickered.   
  
""I know, right? No one to fetch us coffee, no one to mess with. It's no fun without a punching bag,"" another chimed in.   
  
Peering through the glass window, Arabella spotted Elissa in the middle of the dance studio.   
  
Years ago, Elissa had been just a pale, skinny kid. Now she was dressed in a flowing white dance outfit, all elegance and grace, like something out of a dream.   
  
Surrounded by classmates, Elissa flashed a gentle, modest smile at the comments. ""Guys, don't say that. Let's not be mean.""  
  
""You're too kind, Elissa,"" Joyce Lambert, her good friend, scoffed. ""That girl sponged off your family for years. If it were me, I'd have thrown her out of your house on day one.""  
  
Arabella narrowed her eyes slightly.   
  
Calling it their house? Seriously?   
  
That place belonged to her and Daisy. Elissa and her family were the ones living off of them.   
  
Elissa tilted her head, her voice syrupy sweet. ""She's my cousin, after all. Her parents passed away. If we didn't take her in, she would've had nowhere to go.""  
  
Her fake compassion earned gasps of admiration from the crowd.   
  
What a generous soul, they all seemed to think.   
  
The loud chatter in the dance studio instantly stopped the moment Arabella walked in.   
  
""Daisy?"" Joyce blinked in surprise.   
  
She stared at Arabella, stunned. She looked the same, but... something about her felt different now.   
  
Chapter 5 Got Yourself A Su\*\*r Daddy  
The dance studio fell silent, as if someone had hit pause.   
  
Every single eye was locked on Arabella, but she acted like she didn't see a thing and confidently made her way to the back, where she began stretching like it was just another day.   
  
Joyce's jaw clenched. ""Daisy, you've got some nerve showing up out of nowhere like this!"" Joyce barked, marching over and swinging a sharp kick at her.  
  
""Just because we've gone easy on you doesn't mean you're not taking orders from us!""  
  
But Arabella moved with ease, dodging the kick without breaking a sweat. Joyce lost her balance and hit the floor face-first with a loud, painful thud.   
  
""You dodged me?"" Joyce screeched in disbelief. Her face turned red with fury as she raised her hand to s\*\*p Arabella.   
  
But just like before, Arabella slipped out of reach like a shadow. Joyce's swing caught nothing but air, and she stumbled forward, grabbing her lower back with a wince. ""D\*\*n it!""  
  
""My bad,"" Arabella said gently, her voice almost too soft to catch.   
  
Joyce wanted to explode, but something about Arabella's calmness made her hesitate.   
  
She didn't dare swing again. Instead, she snapped, ""What are you just standing there for? Get over here and help us stretch already!""  
  
""So, Daisy's really back,"" she thought smugly. ""Still the same pathetic errand girl.""  
  
Arabella's gaze briefly darkened, but she gave a polite nod like an obedient student.   
  
She knelt beside Joyce and began helping her with leg stretches. Joyce smirked. ""You look even sadder than before. Honestly, it's pathetic.""  
  
But then, a painful scream cut through the air.   
  
Joyce's leg jolted, and she broke into a cold sweat, grabbing her thigh. ""My leg... what the h\*\*l? Did you snap my leg?""  
  
The class crowded around her in a frenzy.   
  
""Is she alright? Someone call for help!""  
  
""Look, the teacher just walked in!""  
  
Their panic was cut short as the teacher entered the room.   
  
Arabella still had Joyce's leg in her hands. Calmly, almost casually, she gave it a subtle twist.   
  
""Ah!"" Joyce screamed even louder, nearly in tears from the pain.   
  
""What's going on in here?"" The teacher frowned, scanning the chaos.   
  
""My leg! It feels broken... I can't--"" Joyce wailed, then blinked in confusion. Just seconds later, she could move it again. ""Wait... what?""  
  
""You look fine to me."" The teacher shot a look at Joyce--one that wasn't exactly sympathetic. She had seen enough of these girls' antics over the years.  
  
""I don't care what drama you're cooking up on your own time, but today's important. The Griridge Troupe selection is happening. The dean and senior faculty will be here shortly, so I expect everyone to act like professionals.""  
  
""I swear, I..."" Joyce began, trying to protest.   
  
""That's enough."" Elissa cut her off, stepping forward with an easy smile. ""Let's not waste more time. Joyce, calm down.""  
  
Elissa's tone made it clear--this wasn't the time to pick fights.   
  
Joyce had no choice but to bite her tongue and swallow her anger, though her glare at Arabella could have burned through steel.   
  
The teacher clapped her hands, and class began.   
  
During the last twenty minutes, a few other teachers showed up to observe.   
  
By the time class ended, the room was filled with a mix of nervous energy and excited chatter.   
  
""God, I really hope I get picked. Dancing alongside Elissa would be a dream come true.""  
  
""Elissa, don't forget us when you're famous!"" someone teased.   
  
Elissa gave her signature angelic smile. ""Of course not. You're all my people.""  
  
Then someone dropped a name that made the entire class go silent. ""They say Isabella might be watching today.""  
  
Gasps rippled through the room.   
  
Even Elissa blinked in shock, her breath catching. Isabella Wallace was the icon of modern dance.   
  
Her performances were legendary, her choreography unrivaled. Just being seen by her could open doors.   
  
""If Isabella notices me, that's it. That's my breakthrough,"" Elissa thought, her gaze sharpening with quiet ambition.  
  
But then someone spoke up, disrupting the mood. ""I saw Daisy dancing earlier. Honestly, she wasn't bad at all.""  
  
Joyce scoffed loud enough for the room to hear. ""Daisy? Please. She's pathetic. No way she'd get picked.""  
  
Turning her attention to Daisy, she said, ""Hey, what are you still doing here, anyway? Go get our lunch. You remember our order, right?""  
  
Without a word, Arabella nodded and walked off, her tall frame moving with a silent elegance despite the slump in her shoulders.   
  
""Ugh. Even the way she walks is irritating. Does she actually think she's all graceful or something? What a complete eyesore!"" Joyce sneered.   
  
By the time Joyce, Elissa, and the rest of their group showed up at the cafeteria, laughing and cracking jokes, Arabella already had their meals prepared.  
  
Her eyes quietly scanned each of them--calm, blank, giving nothing away. But in her mind, she was taking note of everything.   
  
Joyce, whose father ran the Lambert Group, was spoiled beyond belief and filthy rich.   
  
Next to her was Kenzie Marsh--the meek, glasses-wearing music student who practically worshipped the ground Elissa walked on.   
  
And behind them, the two guys were followers, plain and simple. They were all muscle without a mind.   
  
Joyce looked at the food Arabella had bought and narrowed her eyes. ""Well, well. Where'd you get the cash, huh? Got yourself a su\*\*r daddy? I thought you were broke, freeloader.""  
  
Joyce kept running her mouth but still dove into the food--everyone was starving after dancing all morning.   
  
However, midway through eating, something went terribly wrong. Joyce coughed violently, bl\*\*d trickling from her lips as she clutched her throat, her eyes wide in panic.   
  
The others followed suit, gasping, hands around their necks, as if something sharp was tearing through their throats.   
  
""It burns--what's happening?"" they wh\*\*zed, struggling to speak as pain ripped through them.   
  
Elissa stared at her in disbelief, still holding her throat. ""Daisy... what did you do?""  
  
""That little bi\*\*h's getting revenge!"" Joyce screamed, losing it completely. ""You think Elissa letting you tag along means we'll go easy on you? You're dead!""  
  
Furious, she flung her food tray at Arabella, while the two boys beside her instinctively lunged forward, ready to grab her without hesitation.   
  
Chapter 6 Do You Have Any Proof  
The students nearby were numb to this kind of chaos.   
  
""Alright, that's enough,"" Elissa said, her voice sounding gentle on the surface but hollow beneath it.   
  
She stayed comfortably seated, not bothering to step in--after all, she never did when things got ugly.   
  
Meanwhile, Arabella, calm and collected, didn't even flinch. When the tray came flying her way, she calmly reached up and caught it in one smooth motion.   
  
The momentum flipped the tray's course, and it slammed straight into one of the two boys' faces.   
  
The food, laced with slivers of glass, sliced across his skin, and bl\*\*d trickled down his cheek in thin, terrifying lines. ""S\*\*t! That hurts!"" he cried out.   
  
One look at the bl\*\*d was enough, and he collapsed in panic, completely out cold.   
  
The other guy didn't back down. Snarling, he reached for Arabella's hair, yanking it hard. ""You think you're tough, Daisy? Huh?""  
  
His fist flew toward her face, but Arabella caught it mid-swing like it was nothing. His expression froze. She slowly twisted his arm until his knees buckled.   
  
""Ahhh! It hurts--stop, please! I'm sorry!"" he howled, his face turning as pale as chalk.   
  
The second she let go, he hit the floor and curled into himself, sobbing in pain.   
  
One of the girls considered helping, but after seeing Arabella in action, she backed off without a word.   
  
What a bunch of clowns.   
  
Arabella stared at them, her gaze sharp and cold, like she was looking at tr\*\*h.   
  
""Have you lost your fu\*\*ing mind?"" Joyce screeched, still in denial. Her hands shook as she picked up a chair and hurled it with all her strength.   
  
Arabella shifted her weight, spun, and kicked the chair right back--slamming it into Joyce's head. Bl\*\*d splattered instantly.   
  
Elissa jumped up in horror, shrieking, ""Oh my God!""  
  
The cafeteria exploded with shouts. ""She's gonna k\*\*l someone! Go find a teacher!""  
  
""What is wrong with her? Is she high or something?""  
  
""Honestly, she's kind of a badass...""  
  
""Shh! Don't let anyone hear you say that!""  
  
Thirty minutes later, the university president's office was a pressure cooker.   
  
The fight was way too intense to sweep under the rug. Daisy, Elissa, and the rest of the group were hauled in for questioning.   
  
Joyce and the others had been bandaged up, but their egos were just as bruised.  
  
Elissa looked ready to cry, still rubbing her sore throat like it had swallowed fire. She was furious, terrified the damage was permanent.   
  
""Call your parents,"" the president ordered Arabella sharply, trying to make sense of the madness. ""Now.""  
  
Joyce jumped in before Arabella could speak. ""She can't. Her parents are dead!"" she sneered.  
  
""She's been mooching off Elissa's family for years. No morals. No manners. Just expel her already!""  
  
Taken aback, the president looked Arabella up and down. ""So, what exactly happened?""  
  
Joyce didn't miss a beat. ""She put glass in our food. She tried to hurt us and then went berserk. She needs to face consequences!""  
  
Arabella didn't even blink. Her voice came out calm and cold. ""Do you have any proof? And while we're at it--did I even lay a finger on you first? Pretty sure your side started swinging.""  
  
""Liar!"" Joyce snapped, trying to keep the panic out of her voice.   
  
Arabella turned her gaze to the president, cool and steady. ""Why don't we pull up the cafeteria security footage?""  
  
Silence dropped like a stone. Joyce's face stiffened, and her jaw clenched tight. ""We only hit her because she gave us food full of glass! She deserved it!""  
  
Arabella tilted her head slightly. ""Where's your proof that I put it there?"" she asked softly. ""Because I have proof of something else.""  
  
She pulled out her phone and tapped the screen. A video began to play.   
  
The footage was damning. It showed Joyce and her gang shoving a sandwich filled with glass into Daisy's mouth. As Daisy's lips b\*\*d, they laughed like it was some sick joke.   
  
It was raw and unforgivable. Arabella's ch\*\*t tightened as she watched it, the pain as fresh as the day she found it on Daisy's phone.   
  
Even the president's face shifted. He turned to Joyce and her friends with a sharp, icy glare. For a split second, panic flashed across their faces.   
  
Trying to smooth things over, Elissa quickly said, ""Sir, yeah, Joyce went too far, and we're really sorry. But Daisy was talking tr\*\*h first--Joyce just lost her temper.""  
  
Arabella raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. ""Is that so? Well then, I'll just upload this little clip online and let the public decide who the real victim is.""  
  
""Absolutely not!"" the president barked. ""Miss Stanley, if that video gets out, it'll drag the university through the mud. Let's not blow this out of proportion. Apologize to each other, and we'll call it even.""  
  
Joyce looked outraged. ""What? She beat the crap out of us! Why should we just let it go?""  
  
Her friends chimed in, just as outraged.   
  
Meanwhile, Elissa leaned toward the president and whispered with a sweet smile, ""My dad's set to donate $1 million to the school. Just thought you should know.""  
  
The president's expression shifted. His tone changed.   
  
""Daisy,"" he began, ""what they did was wrong. But your response was excessive. This could've been handled differently. You can either apologize now and move forward, or you'll be expelled. And if you upload that video, trust me, public opinion won't be on your side. That would be reckless.""  
  
Arabella stared at him. So that was what this was.   
  
Now she understood why Daisy had been stepped on for so long.   
  
These people weren't protecting students--they were protecting their pockets.   
  
Joyce, smelling victory, leaned back with a smug grin.  
  
""Daisy, you really thought you had the upper hand? You're nothing but a parasite clinging to Elissa's family like a leech. Don't act like you matter. You want to stay here? Then get on your knees and l\*\*k my shoes clean. Maybe, just maybe, I'll let you off the hook.""  
  
Joyce looked at Arabella like she wasn't even human.   
  
Elissa didn't say anything at first, but the fire burning behind her calm expression gave her away. Her throat still hurt, and what bothered her more was the embarrassment.   
  
Deep down, she wanted to lash out at Arabella. But on the outside, she just let out a quiet sigh, like she was more hurt than mad.   
  
""Daisy, I honestly don't know what happened to you,"" she said. ""But if you can't apologize to us, then pack your things. You're no longer welcome in my home.""  
  
The president didn't bat an eye. ""That's enough. You're done here. Pack up and get out."" He waved Arabella off like she was a fly in the room before turning to Elissa with a tight smile. ""You're injured. Go rest. We'll take care of everything.""  
  
Joyce smirked, finally feeling like the universe had balanced itself. With their heads held high, they all moved to strut out like they had won a prize.   
  
""Quite the scene,"" came a calm voice from the doorway, all eyes turned.   
  
Arabella raised an eyebrow. How was he here!",3,1755239094.0,romancenovels,3,1.0,False

1mqpk4l,https://i.redd.it/9e2ppl45k4jf1.jpeg,Sour Cherry,"This was actually my second attempt at sour cherry. For the first one I followed the recipe from the spreadsheet (5 muddled cherries per bottle). Not a fan of pulp in my booch personally, and the flavor was a bit weak. So for my second attempt I cooked a quick cherry syrup and added that instead.

Mission accomplished, I'd say. Good fizz with fine bubbles, smooth mouthfeel, and a cherry flavor that really cuts through.

# Recipe

- 150g pitted cherries per liter of kombucha 
- 100ml water per liter

Bring to boil in a small saucepan, then simmer for five minutes. Muddle the cherries, then simmer for a further five minutes. Strain using cheese cloth or a coffee filter and discard pulp.

This should give you about 75ml of syrup per bottle. Sugar content varies, but should be enough that you don't need to add any extra.

A Complete 2025 Guide for Bahrain Company Formation and Dispute Resolution\
A Personal Story From the Heart of Bahrain’s Business Districts\
Stepping into the glass atrium of Bahrain Financial Harbour at 7am, just as the first espresso machines buzz to life in the lobby coffee shop, I catch the quiet pulse of the island’s business world. My first major commercial negotiation here happened in the Seef District, with a view of Bahrain Bay at sunset—a setting as strategic as it was beautiful.\
That deal, like so many others in Bahrain, included an arbitration clause. At the time, I underestimated just how much the costs and process of arbitration could shape outcomes for foreign investors and local founders alike.\
I soon realized that knowing exactly what commercial arbitration will cost isn’t just a technical matter—it’s central to budgeting, risk management, and even day-to-day confidence when forming a company in Bahrain. (On a personal note: the first time our team faced arbitration, I spent days deciphering fee schedules and was surprised by just how much could be saved by leveraging local expertise and timing certain filings right after Ramadan, when queues at the MOICT are shortest.)\
\
A key takeaway: Understanding arbitration costs is now an indispensable part of Bahrain company formation strategy, especially in 2025’s evolving business landscape.\
\
\
Alt text: Business people in professional meeting, corporate professionals discussing contracts. and a March 2025 report from Reuters, Bahrain’s non-oil sector is forecast to grow by 4.7% this year, with the services sector—especially finance and tech—leading the charge. The Economic Development Board (EDB) highlighted over $3 billion in new FDI in Q1 alone.\
What’s driving this?\
- 99% foreign ownership now applies to most business activities (see details), a sharp contrast with Saudi Arabia.\
- Streamlined company registration through Sijilat and new MOICT regulations mean it’s faster than ever to set up shop.\
- A strong network of world-class dispute resolution institutions gives investors real confidence.\
This environment makes Bahrain a magnet for regional HQs and a preferred destination over Dubai for fintech startups thanks to its business-friendliness and transparent legal system.\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain Bay skyline and office buildings.\
- GCC Commercial Arbitration Centre\
- Ad-hoc arrangements, often incorporated in commercial contracts, especially for international joint ventures\
And unlike some neighboring markets, Bahraini arbitral awards are enforced by local courts with minimal friction. This is a major edge for investors—especially with the new 2025 amendments to the Arbitration Law, which accelerate enforcement timelines for foreign awards.\
Cost Breakdown: What Does Commercial Arbitration in Bahrain Actually Cost?\
2025 Fee Structures and Typical Budget Ranges\
Most business founders and CFOs want a straight answer: What’s the ballpark cost?\
\
Arbitration Filing Fees: BHD 500–2,500+ (USD 1,300–6,650)\
Administrative Costs (BCDR, GCCAC): BHD 1,000–10,000+ (gradient with claim size and complexity)\
Arbitrator Fees: BHD 4,000–25,000+ per arbitrator, per case (often split between parties)\
Lawyer/Representation Costs: BHD 7,000–50,000+ for medium-complex cases; large commercial disputes can exceed BHD 100,000 if international counsel is involved.\
Hearing & Venue Expenses: BHD 500–2,500 daily (Seef District hotel conference floors are a favorite; book early around Ramadan to avoid premium rates).\
\
Total all-in costs for a typical commercial dispute range:\
- Small, straightforward case: BHD 15,000–30,000 (inclusive of administration, arbitrator, and legal fees)\
- Medium complexity dispute: BHD 30,000–60,000+\
- High-value/complex matters: BHD 100,000–300,000+\

Pro tip: Plan your document translations in advance, and never leave filing until local holidays. The savings are real.\
Step-by-Step: Managing Arbitration Costs in Bahrain\
1. Choose the Right Arbitration Clause and Venue\
Craft your arbitration clause early—ideally, before you register with Sijilat or the MOICT. Include specifics: preferred language, seat of arbitration (Manama is best), and number of arbitrators (one arbitrator halves the costs for disputes under BHD 500,000).\
\
Avoid defaulting to international bodies unless strictly necessary; local venues like BCDR frequently offer lower total costs and swifter timelines.\
\
2. Prepare Documents Thoroughly—And Early\
Nothing wastes money like last-minute paperwork.\
- Pre-prepare all relevant contracts, board resolutions, and correspondence in both English and Arabic.\
- Use a certified translation office in the Seef District (my personal go-to is Al Hana Translation—they’re fast, affordable, and responsive during Ramadan hours).\
- Schedule your filings outside of national holidays and Ramadan for the fastest processing at both BCDR and the MOICT.\
\

- Network at Majlis Events: Attend BCDR and Tamkeen networking breakfasts for referrals to cost-effective arbitrators and translation agencies.\

Compare Bahrain Company Structures for Best Arbitration Fit\
Different entities face different arbitration risks and cost profiles.\
- WLLs and SPCs (popular with foreign investors) benefit from streamlined dispute mechanisms.\
- Joint ventures or public shareholding companies may face higher arbitrator fees due to complexity and mandatory multi-arbitrator panels.\
Tip: If you’re forming a new entity, consider future dispute costs as part of your initial structuring—especially if you anticipate high-value or cross-border contracts.\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration business meeting corporate structure..\
How did we fix it?\
- Hired an officially MOICT-recognized firm on Al Fateh Avenue,\
- Set up pre-approval for English/Arabic templates for all future contracts,\
- Built a mini-reference library of past precedents in-house, slashing turnaround times for future filings.\
Actionable lesson: Invest in document readiness and always use approved service providers. It’s a small upfront cost for major downstream savings.\
Choosing the Right Support Partner\
For those new to Bahrain’s dispute landscape, leaning on a local specialist saves time and money.\
Personally, I recommend KeyLink’s business support team for their deep bench of bilingual experts and “insider” knowledge of the Sijilat and BCDR systems. Their WhatsApp response time is also unmatched.\
FAQ: Bahrain Arbitration Costs and Related Company Formation Questions\
1. How soon should I budget for arbitration costs after starting my Bahrain company?\
You should build an arbitration budget at the company formation stage—especially if signing large contracts or forming a JV. Use this cost estimation tool to avoid surprises.\
2. Can foreign investors own 100% of a Bahrain company—and how does that affect dispute costs?\
Yes, most sectors allow 99–100% foreign ownership (see full list here). This means you can avoid the extra costs and complications of finding a local sponsor (read about sponsorship structures). Full ownership also streamlines arbitration, as no silent partner needs to be involved in dispute hearings.\
3. Are there ways to reduce arbitrator or administrative fees in a dispute?\
Yes:\
- Choose a sole arbitrator for smaller claims,\
- Use BCDR or GCCAC standard procedures,\
- Prepare all documents thoroughly to avoid supplemental filings.\
4. Do Bahrain free zone companies face different arbitration costs?\
Yes—free zones often have reduced administrative fees and faster hearing timelines for certain types of disputes. This can cut total costs by 10–20%.\
5. What are the post-arbitration compliance requirements (and costs)?\
After arbitration, you’ll need to update your MOICT and Sijilat records, and sometimes your tax and accounting position. Expect to spend BHD 500–2,500 on professional compliance and legal update services (full support here).\
\
For up-to-date regulatory news and expert opinion on Bahrain’s business climate, check out Gulf News’s Bahrain section, Bahrain.com’s official guide, and Reuters Bahraini business updates.\
Final Word\
Choosing Bahrain means investing in a transparent, investor-friendly arbitration regime—one that’s both cost-effective and globally respected. Mastering the cost variables, tapping into local know-how, and preparing every document with care will put your company ahead of the curve.\
And if you ever find yourself negotiating fees over a cup of qahwa in the Diplomatic Area, know you’re not alone.\

## Key Features Analysis

The mara coffee mugs stand out due to a combination of innovative design, high-quality materials, and user-centric features. These elements contribute to a superior coffee-drinking experience.

**Double-Wall Insulation:** Mara coffee mugs utilize double-wall insulation technology. This feature creates an air gap between the inner and outer walls of the mug, significantly reducing heat transfer. As a result, hot beverages stay hot for extended periods, typically up to 4-6 hours, while cold beverages remain chilled for up to 8-12 hours. This insulation also prevents condensation from forming on the exterior, keeping your hands dry and comfortable.

**Premium Stainless Steel Construction:** Constructed from food-grade 18/8 stainless steel, mara coffee mugs are exceptionally durable and resistant to rust and corrosion. This material ensures that the mugs can withstand daily use and maintain their integrity over time. The stainless steel also imparts no flavor to the beverage, preserving the pure taste of your coffee or tea.

**Ergonomic Handle Design:** The handles on mara coffee mugs are carefully designed to provide a comfortable and secure grip. The ergonomic shape fits naturally in the hand, reducing strain and preventing accidental spills. Many models feature a textured surface on the handle for enhanced grip, even when the mug is wet.

**Leak-Proof Lid:** Mara coffee mugs come equipped with a leak-proof lid, typically made from BPA-free plastic or silicone. This lid creates a tight seal, preventing spills and leaks, making the mugs ideal for travel and commuting. Some lids also feature a sliding closure that allows for easy sipping while on the go.

**Variety of Sizes and Colors:** Mara coffee mugs are available in a wide range of sizes, from small 12-ounce mugs to large 20-ounce travel mugs. This variety allows you to choose the perfect size for your individual needs. Additionally, the mugs are offered in a diverse selection of colors and finishes, allowing you to express your personal style.

**Easy to Clean:** The smooth stainless steel interior and dishwasher-safe components make mara coffee mugs easy to clean. The wide mouth design allows for easy access, and the removable lid components can be thoroughly cleaned to prevent the buildup of bacteria and residue.
