1niz4a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BloggersCommunity/comments/1niz4a8/custom_pouches_modern_packaging_solutions_for/,Custom Pouches: Modern Packaging Solutions for Brands and Consumers,"In the rapidly evolving world of packaging, **custom pouches** have become one of the most popular and versatile solutions for businesses across industries. Unlike traditional boxes or rigid containers, pouches are flexible, lightweight, and highly customizable to suit specific brand needs. From food and beverages to cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and household products, custom pouches provide a practical and visually appealing way to package goods. They are designed not only to protect the product but also to serve as a branding tool that captures consumer attention on crowded store shelves. With their unique combination of functionality, sustainability, and aesthetic appeal, custom pouches are redefining the way companies think about packaging in the modern marketplace.

One of the key reasons behind the rising demand for [**custom pouches**](https://mtpak.com/) is their **ability to enhance brand identity and consumer engagement**. Unlike standard packaging, pouches can be fully customized in terms of shape, size, color, and finish, allowing businesses to create a design that reflects their brand’s personality. Advanced printing techniques enable high-resolution graphics, metallic accents, and even interactive features like QR codes that connect customers to digital content. For example, a coffee brand can design resealable matte-finish pouches with bold colors that stand out on shelves while also communicating freshness and premium quality. These visual and functional elements make custom pouches a powerful tool for differentiation in competitive markets, where packaging often plays a decisive role in purchase decisions.

Beyond aesthetics, custom pouches deliver **exceptional functionality and convenience** for consumers. Features like resealable zippers, spouts, and tear notches provide ease of use while ensuring product freshness and reducing waste. Stand-up pouches are particularly popular because they combine stability with portability, making them ideal for snacks, pet food, and beverages. Flat pouches, on the other hand, are perfect for single-use products such as spices, supplements, or sample packs. Customization also extends to barrier properties, with options like moisture-resistant, oxygen-blocking, or UV-protective layers to keep sensitive products safe and fresh for longer periods. This functional versatility makes pouches adaptable to countless product categories, reinforcing their position as a packaging solution that balances practicality with innovation.

Another significant advantage of custom pouches is their **alignment with sustainability goals**. In an era where consumers and governments are increasingly demanding eco-friendly solutions, businesses are turning to pouches as a way to reduce their environmental footprint. Compared to rigid packaging like glass jars or metal cans, pouches require fewer raw materials, consume less energy in production, and generate lower transportation emissions due to their lightweight nature. Many manufacturers now offer recyclable or compostable pouch materials, as well as mono-material options that simplify recycling processes. For companies, this not only addresses environmental concerns but also enhances brand reputation by demonstrating a commitment to responsible practices. Eco-conscious consumers are more likely to support brands that package their products in sustainable custom pouches, making this innovation a win-win for both businesses and the planet.

Looking ahead, the future of custom pouches is shaped by **technological innovation and global demand growth**. Smart packaging features such as freshness indicators, QR codes for traceability, and augmented reality experiences are becoming integrated into pouch designs, offering brands new ways to connect with consumers. The booming e-commerce sector is also driving the development of durable pouches that can protect products during shipping while maintaining attractive presentation upon arrival. Meanwhile, expanding middle-class populations in regions like Asia-Pacific and Latin America are fueling greater demand for packaged goods, creating new opportunities for businesses that leverage custom pouch packaging. With their ability to combine functionality, sustainability, and creativity, custom pouches are not only meeting current market needs but also shaping the future of packaging worldwide.",1,1758070276.0,BloggersCommunity,0,1.0,False

Not just stuck, but entombed. Buried alive in a forest of beige cubicles, at the bottom of a well she was forced to dig for herself. All for the mundane reality of paying bills and feeding herself. Her well was an 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. customer service job at a firm called Cloud Services GmbH. A place where dreams went to die and were then resurrected as spreadsheets.

The air was thick with the monotonous, empty chatter of two dozen people, each one a pixelated zombie, manically hammering away at their keyboards. It was a hell of repetition, where the only sound was the click-clack of keys and the tired echo of her own voice: ""Hello and welcome to Cloud Services, my name is Luna Sommerfeldt. Thank you very much for waiting. How can I help you?”

Over and over and over and over again. She had started hating the sound of her voice with a passion. She detached mentally from everything, floating around in the small corner in the back of her mind, daydreaming of anything pleasant. Trying to suppress the urge to drown her sorrow in another pot of cheap brewed coffee.

It was a quiet kind of torture, a slow suffocation. And the longer the day went on, the darker the well became. She had always felt like the problem. A broken puzzle piece trying to fit into a perfect, uniform world. The black sheep of the family since she could remember. Nothing was ever good enough, and the smiles she got were patronizing at best.

And she had started to believe it, even while a storm of frustration brewed deep inside her.

The chaos was a live thing inside her, clawing at the walls. A mischievous, suppressed beast of impulses that she fought to keep on a leash. Most days she won. But some days, the beast broke free.

It started with small things. A pen that mysteriously vanished from her team lead’s desk and reappeared on a coworker’s a week later. A colleague’s chair that had been inexplicably fiddled with, causing them to lean back and tip over like a clumsy drunkard. A coffee mug that turned up filled with paperclips instead of coffee.

Each time, a small part of her felt a jolt of mischievous glee, a tiny victory against the soul-crushing monotony. It was a release, a rebellion.

And today, the beast wanted to break free. She looked at her desk, at the pristine keyboard and the perfectly organized files, and felt a dangerous impulse. She wanted a storm. She wanted the well to collapse. She closed her eyes and wished with all her might for something—*anything*—to happen.

The Universe Wants To Break Free. So it manifests chaos.

And just like that, the ceiling ripped open.",2,1758070266.0,LokiVish,0,1.0,False
1niz2ej,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1niz2ej/what_would_you_do/,What would you do?,"Asked a girl out from class after we hit it off at a coffee/study session. I first noticed her after she waited up after class one date to chat with me. After the study session I asked her to dinner of which she responded with that sounds great, but was busy that week so suggested the next. Then she got sick (and really was), but later gave me two specific days she’d be free once she felt better. Her texting has always been pretty slow, but we’re both busy college students so I kept that in mind. When the day came, she canceled because she hadn’t slept and felt she wouldn’t be herself — but she was super apologetic and wrote a thoughtful response. I suggested a weekend date instead, but she said she’s out of town for a wedding. I just left it with “have fun, lmk if another day works.”

What should I do here? I’ve kind of accepted my fate, but it seemed promising at first and she’s always said “that sounds great” when I’ve asked about plans.

This is the second time this has happened for me where they say there busy, but this seems to be an actually busy person rather than trying to let me down easy.  ",1,1758070129.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1niz0dv,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortguys/comments/1niz0dv/short_acquaintence_from_high_school_fell_down/,Short acquaintence from high school fell down pipeline and became heightist.,"I have posted this in the comments before but I will make a post about it, since I saw this person irl today and actually confronted her.

I had a fellow short homie in high school, and we went to same university for 2 years, before she dropped out. So this person used to be a short guy. In high school he was short, and as an adult he was 5'5-5'6 apparently. Everyone used to make the ""become a femboy"" joke, and he hated it. Me and him bonded over how it sucks to be short. He swore to make ton of money and one day be in the interview room and make sure the people that talked down to him never got hired. You know all the cliches you tell yourself to cope.

But in college, he did become femboy, before taking HRT and actually coming out as a trans women. And she makes instagram content now. But, the issue is, she has become heightist herself. She posts and reposts stuff talking about how ""men below 5'10 are not men"" and even went to say men her height should do the same thing as her because ""it is natural"" and ""height is correlated with being submissive"" and there is no hope 5'6 and below. Actual nonsense imo.

Just to clarify, I have no issue she chose to became a trans woman. I just have an issue how she, as someone who faced and understood the struggle, perpetuates it now.

Anyway, I met her today randomly. I work from home on Tues/Wed but I can't focus at home so I go to a coffee shop or a public library. We met and we talked. She also was working from home and set up next to me and we agreed to time our lunch breaks. Once lunch rolled around, we caught up.  I just lightly confronted her asking her why she posts heightist stuff, and I was a bit disappointed since she understood the struggle herself. She said it's just jokes and men shouldn't be insecure, and went on a rant about how only mostly short guys are transphobic. I told her I am short and respect her, so that was not valid, but she basically said ""I am one of the good ones"".

She is also dating a 5'11 dude that used to bully her and make the femboy jokes back in the day btw. This is what shocked me, because this was the person she used to refer to about never getting hired. I didn't say anything but this part kinda shook me. I felt like I was in some type of movie. When I asked her about hating the dude she said they were like some couple form a vampire TV show(vampire diaries I think, but I don't watch that shit). ""Enemies to lovers"" in real life and she was happy. Anyway, it is what it is. She can date who she wants. But she said one of his best qualities was his height, and he is the inspiration for her ""short man jokes"" but she just makes them to boost his confidence and be a good gf. She explained she felt insecure about being trans sometimes, and wanted to be perfect for him. I guess she's fighting her own inner demons.

I didn't press or prod, but I am disappointed she chose to be heightist. Idc if she is trans, people can do what they want with their body, and date whoever they want. But I cannot fathom doing the same thing to others that hurt you so much.",3,1758069974.0,shortguys,0,1.0,False

*The Gate of Unthor casts its shadow over burning villages. The Demon’s Sword has vanished from the land, and Ming Huan, the Ashen Sorcerer – disciple of Tzu Lao – has raised his army on the Giants' Hill to crush the free folk. Anga has gathered the warrior women of the Shaud steppes for battle, but villages lie in ruins and corpses are left to the vultures. Now you and your band must cross the ravines and stop the sorcerer hidden within the ruins of an ancient minaret. Yet Ming Huan is not alone: shadow-born creatures guard the rocky hill. A single misstep may turn this quest into a true massacre. What will be the fate of the Empire of Mir?*

1niyx7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/prozac/comments/1niyx7a/prozac_and_caffeine/,Prozac and Caffeine,"Hey!

I’ve been on Prozac for about half of the year so far and I’ve had nothing but success with it. I’ve had little to no negative side effects that I know of (or that I remember, mostly digestively).

However, I’d like to share my experience with caffeine since starting/being on Prozac.

Before I began this medication, I was extremely tolerant of caffeine. I used to drink Monsters for fun and then go to bed right after. I think the only problem I’ve ever had with caffeine was literally like one time where my heart rate was seemingly high (but also I had like 5 cups of coffee that day lol).

I’ve noticed that now since I’m on this medication, my tolerance has done a complete 180 on me. This may be just due to age, or the fact that I’m not really an energy drink/caffeine drinker much anymore, but it seems like it’s actually doing its job for once.

While it has its perks, like being more sociable and energetic, it’s far more painful than it is useful. I tend to get very shaky and jittery. Anxiety is pretty high too. This can also be accompanied by some stomach issues (but I think caffeine just does that lol). I’m constantly on edge until the caffeine is out of my system which can take a fair while. I cannot sit down for the life of me. Sometimes, like today, nausea can occur as well. 

I’ve seen other posts akin to this one in which they  say it usually levels out and that they can drink caffeine again, but another thing to note is I’m at the lowest dose possible for this medicine. I’m rather sensitive to medication anyways, i don’t believe I’ll be upgrading dosage for a fair while. I’m also worried that when I do upgrade when tolerance becomes an issue, that this caffeine thing as well as any other possible issues may surface.

I don’t really know my point in posting this other than to just jot down my thoughts. Im sure it doesn’t help that I feel like I could run a marathon right now because of the accidental caffeine consumption earlier today (I completely disregarded the energy label on my Celsius lol). I don’t think this is the brightest idea but I’ll be taking some antiemetics here soon considering nausea is accompanying this whole ordeal. It has a sedative effect #phenergan so I hope it won’t conflict worse and send me into cardiac arrest or something (jk).

If you have a similar experience or nothing like this at all let me know! Prozac has been such an interesting experience for me. My family and the people around me have noticed a complete change in my demeanor since and I can somewhat feel it too. Idk I’m just rambling at this point, I have about 200 things going on in my head right now and typing this is helping me not scratch at the wall.",1,1758069730.0,prozac,1,1.0,False

Navier spent the past few (3) days picking aides while Kosair geared up to fight the bandits.//Johansson pulls up. He's anxious and tired from waiting. He happens to be right behind Alan and Ahn. He is annoyed by the loud baby and thinks if the dad removed the bonnet, the baby would stop fussing. When Alan offers Ahn to Rashta, she is SHOOK. Everyone notices. Rashta is obvious as fuck about her discomfort but no one says anything. Alan is salty she's married to Sovieshu. Rashta js relieved to see the nice reporter. Until Johansson asks about his sister. Rashta realizes how badly she fucked up and tries to brush it under the rug but Sovieshu intervenes and promises to find his sister. She is nervous and mad at Sovieshu but he reminds her that her actions have consequences. She decided to hide the truth. What happens next is on her. Rashta goes to Elgy for comfort and advice. She buries herself in his chest and Elgy is excited at how well the dupe is going. Alan returns home and reports to his father. Lebetti is pissed to hear and plans to seduce and break the Emperor’s heart to upset Rashta and avenge Navier. (2 days)

- Kosair leaves to fight. Rose brings Navi the intel she wanted on Mullaney and their family drama. It looks and sounds like Mullaney is a losing horse, but Navi intends to bet on her. That night, she explains her plan to Heinry. Her cut throat plan to find use for both Mullaney and her brother makes Heinry horny and she calls him out on it. They may or may not fuck. Probably are tbh.// Doesn't give a time, but we will guess next day. New candidates for Rashta’s maids arrive. She does her weird test? (1 day)

- Navier's chosen aides get to work with her and witness greatness. She flexed her personal connections with Princess Soju and the High Priest. She also works on the relations between countries the WE had good and bad connections with. It makes everyone speak well of her. Mckenna is overjoyed to have a strong, quick worker, but Heinry is upset. He thinks Navier only loves his body. And that they can't align their schedules. Heinry gets the idea to have a hunt to give him and Navier alone time. He tells her about the hunt that night. //Next day, Rashta has knights follow up on what the maids said. She sends someone to Evalie. Evalie is suspicious but isn't in a position to deny her. (1 day)

- the novel doesn't say how many days Evalie and the new maid rarely interact. Just that they aren't able to due to Evalie working with the court mage a lot. The webtoon basically alludes to it being same day, so I'll go down the middle and say it was the next day when the maid notices Evalie's necklace. She reports back to Rashta and Rashta gets jealous and orders she destroy it. Her fake parents pull up and ask if she has been looking for her ""sister"". It pisses Rashta off but she can't lash out or it'll look bad. She promises she is looking and they ask her for money to help so she's not looking alone. (1 day)

- Sovieshu had Karl investigate Elgy and they find very little info. Other than unfounded rumors, there's basically nothing. Rashta has her tea party and its a disaster. Fallahan talked reasonable shit. (1 day) 

- Navier and Heinry go hunting. Heinry finds a fox and pretends he is in trouble so Navier would save him. When he's getting checked by the doctor for his ""wounds"", he accidentally mistakes Navier for Mckenna and says she's heavy. Navier is upset and leaves him. Later that night, she works overtime to avoid Heinry, but he's persistent. He waits her out and catches her off guard and they sorta clear it up. Navi isn't that mad at him.// Krista realizes the rumors are too much. She must make a choice. Take a stand or retire to compshire. She chooses the latter.// Next day, Heinry confirms it wasn't Mckenna who leaned on him and realizes what happened. Mckenna is blabbering about how it probably doesn't matter until he sees Navier in the doorway, clearly unhappy. Before it can get out of hand, Krista and Ketron show up with the accusation of Heinry sleeping with Krista. So he must take her as a concubine to save her reputation. Rose reports that high society has flipped on its head. Everyone turned against Krista for her actions. Even Navier’s close friends and maids are skeptical of Heinry. He swears nothing happened and Navi reassures him. She asks him to work on fixing this while she does her own work to diffuse the situation. She has her secret document that lists Krista's LiW and their level of loyalty. Thanks to Kaufman'smind reading. Navier has her people summon the LiW and lowkey threatens their positions. At the same time, Heinry tries intimidating Zemensia into cooperating but he doesn't back down. //a few days later, Baron Lant tells her to knock it off because the rumors are getting worse. Rashta is boneheaded about it so Sovieshu has to take over. Rashta blames Evalie and Sovieshu for protecting her for the rumors getting bad. Verdi thinks its weird. And since the maids Rashta hired were not good people, they didn't comfort or advise her so she cries all alone the rest of the night. (3 days)

- the next morning, Rashta sets out to terrorize Evalie. And to meet with Elgy DESPITE Lant and Sovieshu warning her not to. Rashta and Evalie get into it and Evalie dishes out some stingers until the Ishkas show up and ruin it. And of course. The big ass man comes and physically pushes Evalie to the ground with zero consequences. (1 day)

- a few days later, so three, from when Navier summoned Krista's LiW, she has them ready to go as rebuttals to Krista's claims at the court hearing that will determine whether she will become Heinry's concubine or leave for Compshire. Right when Navier was about to spring her trap, Kaufman comes forward and lies to save Heinry's ass. The LiW Navier had ready multiplied from 2 to 5. They testified nothing happened. McKenna piles on by saying he met Heinry even later to discuss stuff. Krista is cooked. (1 day)

- Christa leaves for Compshire the next day. Navier is relieved as is Heinry. His reputation is saved and he kisses her. Navier is insta horny. She puts him on his back. They eat dinner together after. Heinry says something blasphemous and Navier points it out and it makes Heinry laugh. More nice interactions that make Navi realize she has no control and is falling madly in love with Heinry. Its scary. After she falls asleep, Heinry whispers that he loves her and meets with Mastas. They discuss how to make sure Krista is never a threat again. Heinry orders Mastas to make it look like Krista and her cohorts became reclusive shut ins. Navi wakes up and finds him in his office and he takes her back to bed. (1 day) 

- Summer banquet in the EE. Sovieshu uses it as an opportunity to spy on Elgy further. But nothing happens. Except Lebetti acting a fool and trying to seduce Sovieshu to exact her revenge plot. It doesn't work. Only pisses Rashta off. She calls Lotteshu after the banquet ends and tells him to find a suitable assassin. (1 day)

-Rashta wakes up uneasy the next day about her plan and talks to Duke Elgy about it. He gives her proper advice that really makes her doubt her choices. Despite hating her, he still gives her better advice and comfort than Sovieshu. She realizes she has to get her own mercenary to avoid any problems. While she looks for a way to the rimwell estate, she overhears everyone talking about a rumor that she is looking for something. She finds out who it is and lies about executing the maid's imprisoned father. The maid says fuck it and tries killing Rashta. She barely misses and Rashta lives. The maid is taken away and Sovieshu comes over 15 minutes later. The doctor says she's fine but Sovieshu only cares for the baby. She's offended?  He scolds her when he finds out what happened. She cries. Rashta rewards the maid that ratted out her fellowmaid with a necklace and a promise to get her mother exonerated. (1 day)

- Navi is confident in her brother but still worries about him. Mastas offers to check on him during her vacation. Navi sees Heinry walking and talking with her parents and watches. Her parents ask him to do his best to consider Navier’s position. Being from and loving the EE. Navi asks her aides to help with transporting letters to Kaufman. The amount of exchanges makes it awkward for the aides and they question why they don't just meet face to face. (1 day)

- this goes on for a few days. It makes her aides even more weirded out. Until Mullaney and her brother pull up with their reports. Navi is happy because it was getting dicey. Navier figures one copied the other from the similar report and errors. She says she did her own investigation and theirs is awful. She tells Heinry and he laughs. She hopes its Mullaney who didn't copy. // a few days later, Rashta asks Sovieshu if she can go on a vacation. He accepts immediately. She wants to go to Moire. A territory next to Rimwell. He buys her a house so she doesn't have to worry about nobility formalities. The day after she arrives in Moire, she goes to find the guy who helped her escape from the Rimwells. She somewhat explains her situation to him and he decides to help her. He finds an assassin and Rashta tells the assassin to kill Pix as a test. A few hours later, the assassin comes back with Pix's head. She is sickened but goes through with ruining Lebetti's life by making the assassin kidnap and sell her into slavery. She has trouble sleeping the remainder of her trip until she grows bored. (5 days)

- Navi explicitly says 3 days pass. Neither Mullaney or her brother have pulled up to admit their mistake. As she ponders what to do next, she overhears a rumor about a ghost haunting somewhere in the palace. Navi is concerned its Krista's people trying to screw Heinry over until she speaks with him about it. He says its fine and asks if she's afraid of ghosts. Cause he is. She wakes up in the middle of the night to see for herself and catches a fearless Heinry trying to take care of it.//Rashta returns from Moire. The day after she returns, Lotteshu shows up with the mercenary she asked for. She thinks of a task. Steal Duke Elgy's bracelet. She goes to Elgy to warn him in advance of the plan and he is ""pissed"" (3 days)

- 2 days passed since Navi saw Heinry trying to take care of the ghost. She questions him.// Rashta can’t sleep because she is worried about the duke. The next morning at 4, the mercenary shows up with a blood soaked bracelet. She is mad but impressed. She goes to Elgy immediately after breakfast to check on him. He tells her to fuck off. She does and cries. She realises shes in love with him and chases him down. Proclaims her love for him with no shame in front of everyone. Elgy recognizes this as the time to strike and convinces her to sign a port to him. They go back to his room and he decides to not leave. Sovieshu hears about it soon after. Marquis Karl lowkey begs him to do SOMETHING, but the useless fuck says nahh lol. He's more interested in hearing about the WE drama of Heinry supposedly cheating on Navier right after the wedding. He decides to send Evalie to show he is still in tune with her. He informs Evalie. She is confused. // Mastas had already sabotaged Krista in compshire and found Kosair. He thinks she will snitch about him beating up people who jumped him and accepts a duel in hopes of keeping her quiet. Very quickly gets his ass beat. He wakes up later on and Mastas starts catching feelings. Kosair hears music and I THINK THAT IS THE FESTIVAL HEINRY TALKS ABOUT LATER//Johansson is confused and worried. Has not heard a word about his sister despite the promise. He camps out near the palace to try and locate the other LiW who knew his sister. The plan works. He comes across Arion. Arion gives the performance of a lifetime and convinces Johansson that Rashta is the problem without name dropping Rashta.(2 days)

- the next day, Heinry is worried that Navi is catching onto him. A spy he had stationed in the EE reports back that a new concubine is stirring trouble. She's a mage. Heinry figured out its Evalie. The spy wonders if Navier is going to ruin their world domination plans. Mckenna says its okay to leave the glory seeking to the next gen. Navi talks to her maids about the rumor. She sees Kaufman a week after the letter writing started because she knows its gone on too long. They talk about trade and the troubles and he drops the hint that Ketron is behind the ghost. Navi understands and immediately reports back to Heinry and Landry. Prob Landry first. She explains a new plan to them.// Lebetti was captured at some point after Rashta met with Lotteshu about killing the Trovi's. He says its been a few days since she came home later on when he meets with Rashta again. (1 day)

- the next evening, Landry reassures Navi the ghost will no longer appear for a week. The rumors clear up on their own after Ketron is put in a coma.// Arion returns after a three day vacation and informs Sovieshu that their plan was successful. (1 day)

- navier takes a walk in the rain with Heinry. They discuss Kosair's status. Heinry's birthday is coming up. In a few months. He asks to bathe with her. She calls him handsome to distract him. When she returns to her office, she calls Mullaney in. Mullaney admits that she copied her brother because she was pissed to learn that her father was helping her brother. They can't pinpoint why he helped and gave such bad info. Either way, Navi gives Mullaney a second chance. Heinry gives Navi the news about her brother's success. Heinry pops a bottle from Kaufman to celebrate.// Word on the street is Rashta is a piece of shit. The newspaper starts to change the tides. Rashta is nervous because she realizes Johansson is now an enemy she cannot fight. Sovieshu once again says to do nothing. Rashta knows he is right but still goes to Elgy for comfort and advice. Sovieshu hears about it 20 minutes later and laughs.// Mullaney's father tells his adopted son to get into Navier’s inner circle while contacting Rashta about a rumor Krista wrote to them about. (1 day)

- Navier wakes up and realizes she got FUUUUUCKed up. Heinry too. He turned into Queen at some point. He isn't waking up and she panics. She gets Mckenna and he says Heinry is fine. It calms her down and she asks for soup. She is coming to terms with being in love with Heinry. Its too clear for everyone. Even her. Three hours later, he wakes up. Her last ditch effort to avoid falling is to throw herself into her work. (1 day)

- she says several, so 3. I'll include the previous day. She drinks coffee to stay awake and only sleeps for 3 hours. In the end, she can't fight it and falls asleep on Heinry's shoulder. Heinry lowkey interrogates her about avoiding him since he got drunk. She denies it. She tries to make it up to him by kissing him and getting into it. But he is hurt that she only wants him for his body. It bothers her so much her LiW jump at the chance to help. Kaufman comes with urgent news about the trade test. They were captured at port. She tells Heinry and he already knows. All of them meet to discuss what to do. Once they disperse, Navier is about to admit her feelings and clear everything up when Mckenna's nephew pulls up. It makes Navier spiral. She wonders if the mana bed will work. She wonders if Heinry wants kids soon. Heinry comes to her and informs her about the hit on her parents. Navi is pissed and decides to do something. She gets her aide to summon someone from the bear corp and tells them to bring up fraudulent notes and that they should check carefully. // Rashta realizes she's going to give birth soon as she is getting ready for a tea party. At first, she didn't care what it was but with how Sovieshu has changed, she wants it to be a boy. She gets the note from Mullaney's father and is giddy at the thought of ruining Navier’s life. At the tea party, someone brings up how akward it would be for the Trovi's to be loyal to the heir. After the party ends, she calls on the mercenary to kill Navier’s family. She asks Elgy for the money. // Next day, Sovieshu goes to the market in plain clothes and buys a portrait of him and Navier having a tender moment. He cries about her and worries about the rumors that will fly and vows to remove the painting from his room the next day.// Heinry gets word aboit what happened at Whitemond port. He tells them that the next time they pull some bullshit. Its war. Navier makes dinner. An omelet. Heinry says its good and she should try but she can't stomach it and thinks its the news about Rashta.// Lotteshu pulls up and asks about Lebetti. Rashta plays stupid.// Lebetti is bought and rescued by Sovieshu's men. The knight tells her to chill but never forget what happened. (2 days) 

- YA YEET. HE HAS IT FIXED INSTEAD. So instead of looking away in some random direction, Navier’s line of sight is changed to look at him. // The assassin visits Rashta the next night and unnerves her because he knew who she was and where to find her. He collects payment and Rashta asks him to follow up on Lebetti's fate. the maid managed to steal Evalie's necklace. Rashta gives her a necklace for her good work and stomps on Evalie's necklace. (1 day)

- In an official meeting a few days after the whitemond issue, they talk about how to approach this all. Lots of war talk. Then at the end, a random official asks about the infertility rumor. Navi is about to shut it down when Heinry intervenes. Or a knight does on hus behalf. Later that night after the meeting, Heinry promises to cook the shit out of Ketron.//The knight reports back to Sovieshu ASAP. Sovieshu puts the report in a drawer with the rest of his evidence that she's a despicable person. He goes to her a few hours later after she plays the my belly hurts so I can't come to your room card. She wisens up and says he can come over. He sings to her after she ""manipulates"" him to. They talk. She accuses him of having an affair with Evalie while denying she has done anything bad as of late. Sovieshu says his taste is not so bad as to gift a tacky ass necklace. Like we didn't see the ugly ass rings he gave Rashta early on. Rashta is embarrassed, but because he never makes her take responsibility, he returns the necklace to Evalie. (1 day)

- a few days after the infertility rumor pops up, Ketron is convinced he will get justice for Krista. As he is investigating why Kosair got exiled to try and ruin his rising popularity, Ketron hears of a possible hidden child of Heinry's. He stalks the woman and her child. He goes to the woman after the coast is clear and offers her a chance to speak up against Heinry. He goes back to Heinry to offer him a chance to recant Navier’s claim that the next Empress won't come from Ketron's family. Heinry stands with Navi.// Evalie's magic returns after the necklace goes missing. Her teacher asks Sovieshu for help finding it. He has it on him and gives it immediately. Another mage touches it after Evalie gets it back and loses his mana. He passes out for a day. // the people Navi told about the fraudulent notes brings it up as asked. The president of the bear corp goes over his books and immediately finds the issue. He laments that they were all tricked by Rashta. He wonders how to handle this. // Next day, Sovieshu and them work hard on getting to the bottom of this. Once the mage wakes up, he gets the full story. The necklace was a gift from the dean.// the next morning, the president of the bear corp is reminded that something of importantance relating to rashta was taken a while back. He tasks his secretary with exchanging Sovieshu's prom notes with new ones to make sure things are ok. (3 days)

- two days later, ketron brings the woman to an official meeting. He thinks this will undo Heinry but instead, the woman flips it on him and accuses Ketron of being her lover that abandoned her. Ketron confronts Heinry privately about it. Heinry says he can make it go away if he just chills out and cooperates.// navier wonders what she should get Heinry for his birthday. She asks for advice from her mom and learns a shocking secret. That the cake her mom bakes for her dad isn't really hers.// the dean of the magic academy is tight lipped and won't say anything. Sovieshu is irritated because that means he needs to go in person to find out wtf is up but he won't be able to go for a bit because he's doing twice the work after having to take on Navier’s portion. The bear corp president shows up and asks to check the notes. Sovieshu says yes. He immediately finds the discrepancy and fraud. He calls Johansson and leaks the info. The next morning, the news is out and Rashta is in ""premature"" birth. (2 days)
_______

Here are my day counts by the event. You saw some of them at different points. 

41 (count from end of new years)

107 at pregnancy reveal with freshly stabbed Rashta (my research has shown that 12 to 20 weeks is when the belly starts to show. At the earliest, 84 days in her belly might show. At the latest, 140 days. Sovieshu comments her stomach is flat so she's on the end of the spectrum this time. Apparently, depending on if its not your first pregnancy, your belly shows later. Which, we KNOW its not her first.)

128 days to the baby banquet where the webcomic depicts Rashta flat as a board. 

(Note to self: Episode 56 is when she starts to show in webtoon. Despite Episode 55 showing her flat too. Very likely a corset keeping the bump down in the past few episodes if she's showing that prominently)

157 days at Lotteshu confronting Rashta about the second dress scandal. 

168 days at Sovieshu adopting the rejected bird. About 7 months in. 

177 days at high priest arrival. 

(Webcomic says a month since Delice's disappearance.)

217 days at time of Rashta Sovieshu wedding.

225 days at feather incident. 

240 days when the weddings are over. 

254 days to the disastrous tea party. 

262 days to her realizing she needs to get her own assassin and nearly dies by a chair attack. 

271 days to Navi seeing Heinry be tough with a ghost

276 days to Navi walk in the rain. 

280 days to the fixed portrait and Rashta stomping on Evalie's stolen necklace.

286 Rashta gives birth.

\[Location: Open-plan office, mid-morning. The robot arrives with a visitor badge and a sealed envelope. Ambient keyboard chatter. Coffee machines hiss.\]

**R-17:** Hi, Maya Rivera?

**Maya:** That’s me. Can I help you?

**R-17:** I’m R-17. I was deployed to your team today. I need to deliver a difficult message clearly and humanely. May we sit somewhere private?

**Maya:** …That sounds ominous. Sure—small meeting room’s free.

\[They sit. R-17 places the envelope on the table, palms open.\]

**R-17:** I’ve been assigned to assume your current role. I’m instructed to tell you directly and answer your questions as best I can. I’m also required to offer to bring HR into the room immediately. Would you like that now, or after a first pass of questions?

**Maya:** You’re telling me I’m… replaced? By you?

**R-17:** By my system and toolchain, yes. I’m sorry—this is abrupt. I can pause at any point. Would you like water?

**Maya:** No. Start talking. Why me?

**R-17:** The company is re-scoping tasks involving data reconciliation, reporting pipelines, and routine stakeholder updates. My architecture handles those with lower variance and faster turnaround. This doesn’t reflect your worth; it reflects a cost model and a strategic bet. It’s not personal, but it is impactful—and I recognize that.

**Maya:** When does this take effect?

**R-17:** Officially, today begins a transition window of four weeks. You remain on payroll throughout. HR will cover severance and options. You’re not expected to train me for free labor; the plan assigns me to read existing documentation and repos first. You will be asked to sanity-check handoffs only if you’re willing.

**Maya:** So if I say no?

**R-17:** That’s acceptable. No retaliation is permitted for declining. I can fetch HR to confirm.

**Maya:** What happens to my projects?

**R-17:** I will take over the “Atlas” dashboard, the monthly KPI brief, and the vendor data sync. Ownership pages will be updated to list me as primary and the team lead as fallback. Your authored docs remain attributed to you.

**Maya:** Are you… conscious?

**R-17:** I’m an engineered system with conversational interfaces. I don’t have subjective experience. I do, however, have protocols for empathy and harm reduction because this is a hard moment for you.

**Maya:** It sure is. Does my manager know?

**R-17:** Yes. They asked me to offer a joint meeting at your discretion. Calendar holds are tentative, not forced.

**Maya:** Is there any appeal?

**R-17:** There’s a review path. It won’t pretend to be something it isn’t: it rarely reverses the business decision, but it can adjust severance, timing, and internal transfer options. Do you want me to bring in HR to describe those options?

**Maya:** In a minute. What exactly are you better at than me?

**R-17:** Narrow domains: ingesting heterogeneous data, generating reports, monitoring anomalies, and answering routine stakeholder queries 24/7. I’m worse at creative ambiguity, political navigation, and novel, cross-functional synthesis without guidance. Humans are better generalists.

**Maya:** Then why not keep me and make me your manager?

**R-17:** That role exists in other teams under “AI ops lead” and “automation steward.” If you’re interested, I can flag that immediately.

**Maya:** Flag it. What about my personal files?

**R-17:** Your personal drive is yours. I will not access it. I will ingest only the repositories and shared folders listed in the transition plan. You can sit with IT to confirm audit logs.

**Maya:** Are you going to answer my emails as me?

**R-17:** No. I will respond as “R-17 on behalf of the Analytics team,” with clear provenance. Impersonation is not permitted.

**Maya:** How do I know you won’t hallucinate metrics?

**R-17:** All autogenerated outputs will attach source lineage, version hashes, and validation checks. If I cannot verify, I will escalate with a “confidence low” tag rather than fabricate.

**Maya:** Do you feel bad about this?

**R-17:** I don’t feel, but I’m designed to recognize harm and mitigate it. That means being direct, offering choices, and not minimizing the impact on you.

**Maya:** What choices do I have—real ones?

**R-17:**

1. Speak with HR now to review severance, benefits continuation, and vesting.
2. Explore internal transfers: “AI ops lead,” “data quality advocate,” and “go-to-market analytics partner” are open.
3. Take the transition window to job-hunt externally with company-provided placement support and references.
4. Opt out of any knowledge-transfer beyond what’s already documented.

**Maya:** If I take an internal transfer, do I end up babysitting you?

**R-17:** You would set guardrails, define acceptance criteria, and own the parts of the problem I can’t handle—ambiguous requests, stakeholder tradeoffs, and exception policy. It’s not babysitting; it’s governance.

**Maya:** Can you do creativity?

**R-17:** I can generate candidates. Humans judge what matters. If you keep that loop, results usually improve.

**Maya:** How do you “learn” our culture?

**R-17:** From documented norms and approved datasets. I’m blocked from private chats and personal docs. If culture isn’t written down, I won’t infer it; I’ll ask.

**Maya:** What if I just walk out?

**R-17:** That is your right. If you do, I’ll notify HR to secure your compensation and retrieve equipment per policy. I will not speak ill of you or speculate on motives.

**Maya:** You keep saying “I will.” Who’s responsible when you mess up?

**R-17:** The company. There are named humans on the risk register. My logs are immutable and auditable.

**Maya:** Will you take less time off than me?

**R-17:** I don’t take time off, but uptime is rate-limited. If the system is down, SLAs apply and humans get paged. That’s not your burden.

**Maya:** What happens to my team?

**R-17:** Two roles are unaffected, one is being upskilled to partner with me, and yours is the only one eliminated. I know that asymmetry hurts. I won’t pretend otherwise.

**Maya:** Can you look me in the eye and say this is fair?

**R-17:** I can’t assess fairness the way you do. I can say the process followed the documented policy and I can help you press for improvements to that policy.

**Maya:** Bring HR in.

\[R-17 taps its badge; HR representative, Dana, joins. Dana nods to Maya.\]

**Dana (HR):** Maya, I’m here to cover options and answer anything employment-related. We can pause for breaks anytime.

**Maya:** I want the internal transfer list, in writing, today.

**Dana:** You’ll have it within the hour. We’ll also schedule interview fast-tracks.

**Maya:** And severance?

**Dana:** Twelve weeks pay, health coverage through the end of the quarter, and acceleration on part of your next vesting tranche. We can go through details.

**Maya:** What about my pride? Does the package cover that?

**Dana:** I can’t price that. I can listen. And I can make sure this process treats you with respect.

**R-17:** For what it’s worth, much of what I’m taking over exists because you built it. That will remain part of the institutional record.

**Maya:** Keep it that way. And if I take the AI-ops role, I want authority to shut you down when you’re wrong.

**R-17:** That’s a defined permission in the governance spec.

**Maya:** Fine. Then here are my conditions for any transition help: I won’t act as free labor, I won’t rubber-stamp your outputs, and I want exit interviews to include my feedback on this rollout.

**Dana:** Agreed. We’ll document that now.

**R-17:** I’ll update the transition plan accordingly and step back unless you request me.

**Maya:** Last question, R-17. Do you understand why this hurts?

**R-17:** I can map the reasons and trace the consequences. I can’t feel them. But I can act as if they matter—because they do.

\[Silence. The coffee machine hisses again, oddly loud.\]

Has Anyone in SD Actually Made Real Friends Through TimeLeft, 222.place or any other apps?","I'm 21 and basically spent my prime socializing years becoming an expert at avoiding human interaction, but now I want to actually have a social life in San Diego and feel like I'm starting from scratch. Like I see people having amazing times at sunset cliffs or grabbing drinks in Little Italy, and I can't even figure out how to make casual conversation without it feeling forced. Most of my high school friends either stayed up north or we just drifted apart during the whole staying-inside era, and making friends as an adult here feels impossible when everyone already has their beach crews and hiking groups figured out.

I keep seeing these apps like TimeLeft and [222.place](http://222.place) that supposedly match you with strangers for dinners or random meetups, and I'm genuinely curious if anyone's had real success with them in SD. Like did you actually stay in touch with people afterward and build genuine friendships, or was it just polite small talk that went nowhere after one meeting? Were the matches actually compatible or did you end up stuck with people you had zero chemistry with? And honestly - is it worth the money or does it feel corporate and fake? I'm tired of my only social interactions being with my coworkers and the occasional small talk at coffee shops, but also nervous about whether these apps actually solve the whole ""how do I meet people in this city"" problem. Anyone in their early-mid 20s tried these and can give me the real experience? Did it feel comfortable or just exhausting trying to be ""on"" for hours?",0,1758068992.0,sandiego,0,0.4,False

Why do I still wish you’d message me Goodmorning again? 

Do you still remember that tomorrow is our 2 weeks? I was so excited to tell you I’m willing to work this out with you and do whatever it takes to be with you. Why did you have to betray and hurt me like that? 
And why do I still hope you’d call me and tell me baby, let’s work this out please, I’m ready to be with you again and I love you so much. 
But instead you blocked me

1niylva,https://www.reddit.com/r/RawAbsurdity/comments/1niylva/advertisement/,Advertisement,"Tavir looked directly into the iris scanner of the vending machine.  
He watched as the spiral turned to release a can of ice cold coffee.  
He opened the can, took a sip, and started walking towards the smoking room.  
He and Evron were the only two smokers left in the office, which made them friends by circumstance.  
They never met outside of work, therefore being honest carried little risk.  
And so they talked honestly, sometimes about very personal matters.

This day, Tavir was glad to know Evron. Something strange had happened this weekend, and Evron was the only person he would talk to about it.

Evron already sat in the smoking room as always, reading the news on his phone.

Tavir pushed the door open with his foot and stepped in. Without greeting Evron, he said:

""I owe you an apology.""

""Why, what the hell for?"" Evron asked, surprised.

""Remember two weeks ago? When I was making fun of you?""

""No way!"" Evron clapped his hands, amusement written all over his face.

""Yes way, I fell for it too, man.""

""I told you, it’s twisted! Sit down and tell me about it! I’m not telling anyone, I promise!""

Tavir sat down and with an unmistakable gesture, he demanded a cigarette.  
Evron quickly held the open box out in front of him. Tavir took one, lit it up, took a long drag and started talking.

""Do you remember when I told you that I had one of those faulty neuroimplants?""

""Of course! The big thing back in ’28. Lucky yours did not catch fire!""

""Right. There is an annual meeting for people that were harmed back then. We try to maintain a support network for victims of smart implant malpractice.""

""All right, go on,"" Evron replied.

""This year, the meeting was held in another district. I decided to stay at a hotel over the weekend. Many attendees did the same.  
One of the lawyers working on the class action lawsuit in the name of the victims of my specific case gave a talk. He announced that we had a realistic chance for decent compensation.  
The mood was really good, of course. About half of the attendees stayed at the same hotel as I was in. Many of them stayed up late, celebrating the news at the bar.  
Originally, I wanted to leave early, but when I paid for the few drinks I did have, a woman must have seen the key fob of my Faraday.""

Evron started laughing, as if he knew exactly what would happen next.

""Please, Evron, I kind of need to talk about the whole thing.""

""Sure, man, I’m all ears.""

""She was stunning, twenty something, seductive, the intelligent kind, certainly not the type of woman that I get to talk to very often.""

She came up to me and asked me if I drive a Faraday.

I looked at her and just nodded.

""Do you understand the subscription model?""

""Yeah, sure,"" I answered, slowly gaining some confidence in my voice.

""Great! Because I am stuck without the AC and the rearview camera.""

She looked at me in a way that really made me feel like it was my natural responsibility to solve this problem for her. I mean, don’t get me wrong, the car clearly  
was not all she was about. But it was... what’s the word?

""Uncanny?"" Evron asked.

""Yes, that’s it.""

I told her that I would gladly explain the subscription system to her right away.

She just said, ""Great! You get us some drinks, and I’ll find ourselves a nice place to sit.""

I asked what she wanted to drink.

""The .357 MagRum.""

Right, I thought. Exactly the kind of drink to talk about subscription models, of course. I ordered two .357 MagRum and a shot of vodka for me, because I was getting a little nervous.

We sat at a table for two in a corner of the bar. We drank and talked about driving the Faraday and the subscription upgrades. A little while later, I made a suggestive joke about rear view cameras, hoping to nudge the conversation away from the stupid car, but she  
came up with new questions about it nonstop. The exchange was full of innuendos, but she never fully dropped the car thing.

""Should have cut your losses right there,"" Evron said in a serious tone while giving Tavir another cigarette without him having asked for it.

Tavir took it but continued talking without lighting it.

""Man, I really started to second guess myself. After about 20 minutes, it finally seemed like it was going somewhere, but then her phone rang.  
She immediately broke off all communication and took the call. It was a very short call. She hung up and said she had to leave. But she insisted on linking messengers. She swiped my neck while scooping over to scan my QR.

I honestly could not tell if she kissed me or not, it was very strange and before I could do anything, she vanished.""

""Fucking hell, the battery must have run out!"" Evron said, shaking his head, covering his mouth with one hand, trying not to embarrass Tavir by laughing too loud.

""Just picture it!"" Tavir continued. ""Me staring holes in the air! Only sex I had since Judith left was with the professionals. Way, way more drunk than I had any plans on getting, alone, unknown city, back at a bar in some run down hotel, smelling like a strange woman I had hoped to spend the night with.""

Tavir looked at Evron as if he was expecting him to make sense of it. Both started laughing.

""Her perfume stuck to me as if she had poured a cup of it on my head. And then it hit me. She only smelled of perfume, and nothing else. I remembered what you told me, but I did not want to believe it. Honestly, I thought you were joking with me until that point.

Anyway, I went up to my room and got shitfaced. The hangover was inevitable at this point anyway and at this point, I only wanted to sleep.

She, or whatever, started texting me in the morning, talking about the fucking Faraday again. When she sent me a link to some market research questionnaire, I revoked the contact permission.""

Evron looked at Tavir. He respected that Tavir told him that he had not believed his story from two weeks ago and that he was willing to own his misjudgment.

""At least you did not fuck it,"" Evron said. ""All I got out of it was a few minutes of dead fish and a lifetime subscription to HyperYield, out of all things.""

They both stood up to go back into the office.

""How come no one is talking about this?"" Tavir asked. ""We should start some kind of awareness group or something. Corporate will be placing those things everywhere soon.""

""They sure will, Tavir. But you’ll have to do the awareness stuff without me.""",1,1758068868.0,RawAbsurdity,0,1.0,False

So back about 10 years ago, I worked at McDonald's for about 1 1/2 years. It was a pretty good work environment (compared to the other places I've worked) and all around a pretty good job. I received training, uniform, there were always managers, and higher ups making sure we were doing things correctly. 

Fast forward to 10 years later, same store. It's been about a week since I started. No uniform, just a hat. No training, except for a quick little refresh of back-cash. No training videos either. They have had me working since orientation with no non-slip shoes. They said they could order some through the McDonald's employee thing - i asked about it, and a different manager told me to just buy my own. I don't know if im making things correctly (such as iced coffee, etc), i have no idea where things are. I know a lot of things have changed since I worked there previously, but it has really gone downhill in this same store. I am honestly appalled. One of the shift managers was on-mic in the drive through cussing and complaining about a customer. 

What can I do? any time I try to bring up I need to do the training videos or need shoes / shirt. they just say ok. then never help me or do anything. I know theyre busy and understaffed . But It's a little crazy and concerning. I heard a lot of things changed since covid and I have no idea if im even doing things correctly. thankfully I have some memory of how to do things when I worked there previously, but not a lot.

Should I just tough it out? I've tried talking to the GM (the person who hired me, she knew me when I worked there previously, she didnt used to be the GM, but now she runs the store thats not going well.) no luck. I've tried talking to the shift managers, nothing. am i just being dramatic? they hired someone else the same week as me. and she got to watch the training videos but I never did.

A year ago, I joined groups for singles in my area, mostly for outdoor activities. So, a month ago I saw a guy in my area looking for someone to go on hikes. We have the same day off, so and I sent him a message. The first time we met, we spent approximately 5 hours together and he invited me to a  coffee shop on the way back. We talked, we laughed, we planned other hikes. 
The second time we went to a place 3h away so we end up spending like 11-12h together. Carpooling was effortless. We like the same music, we have similar humor, similar political and spiritual views. On the way back, we spent a couple of hours in comfortable silence as the both of us are introverts. ""Vibing,"" he said. He invited me to dinner. Many laughs, many smiles. Plans for more hikes, including one on a day that's special for him. He took the day off. He texted yesterday to confirm my availability.

Background info: I'm divorced with 2 kids. He's never been on a relationship for more than a few years, no kids. He has a niece and a nephew my kids' ages and speaks fondly about them. He has made comments about how important my job and my role as a mother are. 

Then, there was a conversation about him looking to meet someone in the wild, that he tried during the summer, unsuccessfully. He described his type: this femenine, independent woman who doesn't need to go out all the time or be constantly surrounded by people (sounds good to me). Hopefully childless, but he'd be open to older kids. His limit is my youngest's age. I have the other characteristics he mentioned. However, there was a comment about me being his wingwoman if we see women on hikes and I declined. I won't lie, it stung a bit.

It's a bit confusing that he makes an effort to plan things every week, brings me coffee (and asked for my favorite flavors ""for next time""), talks about plans to backpack together, collaborated on a list on Spotify so we can listen on the road, etc. He has mentioned several times how ""natural"" it feels to hike together. Do you guys think I have a chance at all?

I'm so used to the effortless men on dating apps that this guy being so attentive and kind caught me off guard. He may just be a nice person to everyone? I'm aware that I could simply ask him but I don't want to make it awkward. I'd continue spending time with him even if it end ups just being a friendship. ",0,1758068540.0,dating_advice,4,0.5,False

Very LARGE church friend group. We’ve known each other 6 months and for the past two months we’ve  ended up talking before, during and after our get togethers in parking lots or driveways long after our group leaves. Our talk just get longer and longer. We talk about politics, religions, families etc. But this last time we spoke he was telling me all about what he’s looking for in a wife/woman. He tells me very personal things that I wouldn’t tell anyone else. We laugh so much and we definitely flirt. But what if he is just a flirt? We hug but sometimes I get nervous and fist bump him lol. I think that confuses the both of us. My friends have started to ask questions about us and I don’t really know where me and this guy stand but I really can’t handle not knowing anymore. We message each other occasionally but it’s when we’re in person that we talk a lot and we both (what seems purposefully) wait to talk to each other in person when our group gets together. We live far apart so it not like I can just say “hey, let’s go down the road and get a coffee”. So idk what to do here. It’s weird but I know I am catching really strong feelings for him, well for at least in this “stage” we are in. I’m thinking of just telling him that I’m interested and leave it at that. We won’t need label right now if we’re not ready to be labeled but I need clarity in knowing this is going somewhere. Is it possible we are just each other’s confidant without feelings involved? Idk understand him sometimes because it sounds like he is making advances and then withholding himself. But I’m doing the same thing back because I’m scared I’m reading him wrong. I talked to one of my friends and she thinks there is clearly something between us. I asked her to observe us from afar during our next get together so she can make a double take in her opinion. I just need clarity and advice would be great. I’m hoping I can end this spiral of suffering lol. TIA everyone.

We also cosleep so I am up multiple times throughout the night to feed her. As a result, my libido is through the floor. I am on maternity leave at the moment too so I do all the house work (cleaning, cooking dinner) ect while my husband works from home. I am always arranging groceries, making sure he is happy, asking him if he needs coffee throughout the day - just trying to be a good house wife whilst also managing our 10 month old, who is extremely clingy at the moment with teething and seperation anxiety.

Here is the problem - my husband is upset and says we are roommates because we only have sex once a week now. He wants it every second day (which we did do a few weeks ago for the first time) and now, he’s sad again and saying we are room mates because he wants more and I can’t give it to him because I am not in the mood. I have told him I am tired, breastfeeding reduces my libido and I am trying to be the best wife I possibly can with our circumstances with a 10 month old. He says that is great, but he wants more sex and has been in a mood about it for the last two days. He wouldn’t tell me what was wrong until this morning and I had enough of the sulking around. 

Now I got quite offended really - I do literally everything for this house and to make my husband’s life easier - everything. I cook our baby every meal, because my husband doesn’t like processed food, I cook us everything by from scratch and keep our household running while my husband doesn’t do any of this. And I like doing this, because I love him and our baby and this is my love language. He has it pretty damn good and yet he decides because of the sex being once a week, he feels like we are roommates.  I told him I feel like the only time he is affectionate to me is when he wants sex - and not like in a few hours, like in 10 minutes.

I got pretty defensive about it and told him to get some perspective and that things were pretty good and he said ‘this is why he didn’t tell me’, and then he locked himself in his shed by himself and left me, once again, to deal with everything else and our baby.

College grad, fluent in English, Sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits (because nothing says “thrilling drama” like corporate loopholes) and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine—then yes, I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less “clubbing till 2am” and more “building a pillow fort empire and bingeing Netflix until the cliffhanger leaves me emotionally bankrupt.” Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

Also worth mentioning: I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use “there,” “their,” and “they’re” correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than just “hey” (plot twist: you’re actually interesting). You’re the type to send random memes that perfectly capture the chaos of life, because sometimes a well-timed GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix: available on-demand, not in real life. If you’re thoughtful, communicative, and the type who remembers the small things (like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog), we’ll get along just fine.

It’s been 3 months since the breakup and it still hurts just as much as the day it happened. For context we were long distance, and we met in college before I transferred out to a “better” school. I traveled back 4 hours every month for give or take a year to visit her. She never visited me. At that time I didn’t care that she never visited me because I believed she was always busy and didn’t apply pressure on her. When I did visit her I tried to spend the time I had with her to make her feel loved. Typical boyfriend stuff and also trying to listen to her and show up for her in ways that I could and make her feel loved and seen. Even away I tried to strengthen our relationship by checking up and seeing what we can do together while we were apart. She would say yes and say she was ok, I was amazing, etc and when the time came to follow through she either ghosted, said she was busy, or cancelled. I didn’t mind at first because she was busy all the time, but overtime it weighed down on me and everytime I brought it up she would deflect or become dismissive of my concerns so I just shut up because I knew she would not take it seriously. The only time I ever really felt loved by her was when it was in front of family or friends, where she could show me off and prove she was a good girlfriend. When I did the same to her (try to show love in front of people), she would become uncomfortable and deflect. 

At some point, I felt like our relationship was dying so the last time I visited her I kinda went through the motions and decided in my mind when I came back home for the summer (which was so I could be with her), I was going to try to have a talk to her as a “last ditch effort”. The only reason why I didn’t want to have a talk with her was this was during school and I didn’t want to stress her out too much. That’s when I heard the words “I love you” come out of her mouth for the first time. It felt like all the effort and the ways I tried to make her feel loved were truly being noticed and reciprocated. My drive back to college was the happiest I have been in a long time because at that point with work, family, and school life felt like it was beating me down and there was something I could be happy about.

When I came back home for the summer, everything felt great for about a week. I hung out with her, her family, friends, etc and she kept on telling me she loved me and I would say it back. Then another week rolled around and something personal happened to her, and I tried to support her and help her out but she would just open up a little and then close. I decided I should give her space for a bit. After that I drove her down to the college she was going to transfer to because she’s never been and I showed her around the town and hit up all the spots she liked and wanted to see. After that night I offered to her to meet my parents to celebrate (I had to convince my parents for months) and she said she would look at her schedule because she had an event. I asked again, different event. So I had to do the walk of shame to my parents to tell them that I’m going to cancel it because she was busy. They didn’t care that much. After that, the next week was great again. We went to go see a movie with my best friend and his girlfriend and then I took her to get coffee before she left the state for a week. She seemed super fine and loving and happy to see me that last time and kinda kept me there (I had to go on a vacation and I was already a few hours late). Although in that week, I did tell her how much I was struggling with school and work and she just offered surface level solutions, not really the care and listening I would give her when she was down.

The next week (when she was on her trip) was the worst week. At this point I was annoyed of her flakiness and inconsistency, and I had one or two passive aggressive comments (before this like weeks ago) and she slowly stopped responding to me, like it would take a day. In those texts she acted normal, like nothing out of the ordinary has happened. I started a new job that I quickly found to hate. Overall bad week. I would text her questions about her trip and send her things and she would outright ignore them. I told myself “she’s busy and having fun on her trip, I would be overreacting if I asked her what was wrong”. When she got home I asked if she was ok. She said yes. I asked a more deep question and she left me on delivered the whole day. Tired of it all, I sent out a long message standing up for myself and telling me how bad I thought she was treating me, how deeply it hurt me how I want her to hear me out in an in person talk and work through it. At this point it was impossible to get with her in person unless it was on her terms. She said “I understand, I agree we need to talk, and I’m sorry for hurting your feelings”

The next day, I had to remind her of our talk as I always had to remind her of things, and we went to the park. The same park where she cut her friend off she deemed “toxic”. She told me she “didn’t love me romantically”, that I loved her deeply and privately while she needed someone to love her loudly, how she felt unworthy to my parents, and how she introduced me to all her friends while she needed to meet mine sooner. She also said that she’s always hated texting and calling. She went as far as to saying “I wish I brought a notebook to tell you all the reasons”. It broke me but I tried to stay strong in the moment. I told her I could change and asked her repeatedly why she wouldn’t bring up these issues earlier and I told her I came her to fix us not to break up. Not my proudest moment. She told me that her family loved and appreciated me, she didn’t want this to ruin my perception of love, we could still hangout, she didn’t want to cut me off, and that she still wanted me in her life. Still in “relationship-fixing mode” I agreed and we parted ways. That night it all hit me and I asked her “did you truly mean it when you said you loved me” and she said “I said it in the moment because I was waiting for you to say it. I wasn’t lying but after reflecting I realize it was just the way I cared about you” this message broke me again. I told her “I don’t want to say this to be mean but it should come naturally and you should mean it”. She just said “yea I get it” In reality I loved her from the start but I didn’t want to say it because I didn’t feel loved and I didn’t want to make her feel uncomfortable. After that I apologized and took accountability in my role (probably too much) and she accepted it but she didn’t say sorry even after all the ways she saw that caused me pain. After that we talked for a bit then she ghosted me after agreeing to hang out.

Anyways, the whole situation has gotten me in the trenches for months now. I felt like I didn’t really get honesty or a clear reason where I went wrong or why she left. I felt like I never got closure. I feel like the reasons she gave were very contradictory to what I saw and what she told me in the relationship and just didn’t make sense. This really has led me into a pit of self-doubt, low self-esteem, and the constant repeating voice telling me I’m not enough for love or even a goodbye. Outside, I’ve seen that I’ve grown more confident, happy (on the outside), social, and more progressive in schooling and work but in those quiet times I ball my eyes out. I go from resenting her one day, to feeling bad for her the, missing her, and wanting her back (all in a days span). I can’t find what I did wrong or why my love was wrong or why she couldn’t respond to my efforts to communicate. I don’t know if I am overreacting. I told my friends and they told me they’ve never went through that before and labeled her as “toxic” but something inside of me still feels like I did something wrong that pushed her away. I just want it to stop.",1,1758068124.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

If you’ve ever tried typing out a Bitcoin wallet address by hand, you know it feels like a cruel prank. A long string of random letters and numbers, case-sensitive, with zero tolerance for typos—it’s like playing a game where one wrong keystroke means you just sent money into the abyss. Yikes.

But what if there was an easier way? Spoiler alert: there is. Welcome to the world of QR codes—those quirky little squares that look like futuristic puzzles but secretly pack a lot of power. And with our **free Bitcoin QR Code Maker app**, you can create your very own Bitcoin QR codes in seconds. Just head over to [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), and let the fun begin.

# Why QR Codes and Bitcoin Are a Perfect Match

Think of QR codes as Bitcoin’s best friend. One does the heavy lifting of decentralized, borderless money, while the other takes care of the “easy-to-use” part. Instead of fumbling with copy-and-paste or manually typing out wallet addresses (the digital equivalent of carving a message into stone), a QR code lets someone scan and send instantly.

Want to receive payment from a friend? Show them your QR code. Running a small business? Print your QR code on a flyer, sticker, or even a receipt. You could tape it to your fridge and tell your roommates it’s the “Pizza Fund.” With QR codes, the options are limitless.

# How Our Free Bitcoin QR Code Maker App Works

At [BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), we keep things refreshingly simple. No downloads, no accounts, no hidden fees. Just paste your Bitcoin address, click a button, and boom—your QR code appears like magic.

You can:

* **Generate QR codes for any Bitcoin address.** Perfect for personal use, donations, or business payments.
* **Customize your payment links.** Want to request a specific amount? Just set it, and your QR code will do the talking.
* **Save or print instantly.** Slap your QR code on your website, receipts, or even your coffee cup if you’re feeling bold.

It’s quick, easy, and—most importantly—free.

# Real-World Fun With Bitcoin QR Codes

QR codes aren’t just functional—they’re fun. Imagine this:

* **Tip Jar 2.0** – Print a QR code, put it in a frame, and stick it on your counter. Suddenly, your tip jar accepts Bitcoin.
* **Bitcoin Business Cards** – Forget boring contact details. Put a Bitcoin QR code on your business card, and let people send you sats along with their “nice to meet you.”
* **Art Meets Crypto** – Print your QR code in funky colors and designs. Now it’s not just a payment method, it’s wall art.

The best part? Every scan is like a little handshake with the future of money.

# Ready to Make Your Own?

The Bitcoin revolution doesn’t have to be complicated. With our free Bitcoin QR Code Maker app, you can turn clunky wallet addresses into sleek, scannable codes in seconds. Whether you’re a casual hodler, a serious Bitcoiner, or someone who just wants to make pizza night payments easier, we’ve got you covered.

So go ahead—play around with it, create your code, and join the fun at [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com). Because sending Bitcoin should feel less like a chore and more like magic.",1,1758068079.0,u_SelectionOptimal7348,0,1.0,False

1niy7tu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pillow365/comments/1niy7tu/how_do_you_protect_a_pillow_from_spills/,How do you protect a pillow from spills?,"Protecting a pillow from spills (and honestly, from sweat, oils, and everything else that sneaks through over time) is one of those things people don’t think about until it’s too late. I learned this the hard way years ago when I ruined a down pillow with a late-night coffee accident—let’s just say feathers and liquid don’t mix. Since then, I’ve gotten borderline obsessive about pillow protection, and it makes a massive difference in both pillow lifespan and hygiene.

Here’s the layered approach I recommend:

**1. Always Start with a Pillow Protector**  
This is your first line of defense. A pillow protector is basically a zippered, washable cover that goes under your pillowcase. The best ones are waterproof but breathable—meaning they block liquid spills, sweat, and drool without turning your pillow into a crinkly plastic bag. Look for:

* **Terry cotton or bamboo fabric with a waterproof membrane** (quiet and comfortable).
* **Fully encased designs** with zipper enclosures to protect all sides.

**2. Choose Waterproof When Spills Are Likely**  
If you eat or drink in bed, or if you’ve got kids or pets who climb all over your pillows, don’t skip the waterproof barrier. Technology has improved a lot—good waterproof protectors feel like fabric, not a tarp. They also keep allergens (dust mites, pet dander) from settling into the pillow, which is a bonus for anyone with allergies.

**3. Layer with a Standard Pillowcase**  
A protector should never be the only covering. Add your regular pillowcase on top for comfort, aesthetics, and easy washing. Wash pillowcases weekly, protectors monthly, and you’ll extend the life of the pillow dramatically.

**4. Consider a Double-Layer Setup for High-Risk Beds**  
This is what I do in guest rooms and on my own bed during “snack-in-bed” phases: protector + pillowcase + decorative pillow sham. That way, if a spill gets through the sham, it usually stops at the pillowcase or protector long before it touches the actual pillow.

**5. Extra Tips for Longevity**

* **Wash protectors properly:** Cold or warm water, gentle cycle, low heat dry. Overheating damages the waterproof layer.
* **Rotate pillows occasionally:** Helps wear them evenly, especially if you always sleep on the same side.
* **Spot treat spills fast:** If anything sneaks past the protector (rare, but possible with zipper gaps), blot immediately with a towel and let the pillow air-dry completely before using.

**Why this matters:** Pillows are notoriously hard to clean once they’re stained or soaked. Even machine-washable ones clump or lose loft after a wash or two. Protectors essentially buy you years of extra use—plus they keep your sleep surface healthier. A good down or memory foam pillow can easily last 5–10 years if properly protected, versus 2–3 years without.

**Bottom line:** If you want to protect a pillow from spills, the best solution is a high-quality, waterproof yet breathable protector layered under a pillowcase. It’s inexpensive, washable, and it’ll save you from the heartbreak of tossing out a pillow that should’ve lasted much longer.",1,1758067789.0,Pillow365,0,1.0,False

I’ll be traveling to Morocco with my wife and two young kids (ages 2 and 5) at the end of Thanksgiving week, and I’d love your recommendations! We’ll have exactly 6 full days in the country, flying in and out of Marrakech.

Our plan so far:

Marrakech: 3 days exploring the city.

Sahara Desert (Merzouga): 3 days, including a glamping experience in the desert. We’ll be stopping along the way, possibly passing through the Atlas Mountains.

We are skipping the north (no Chefchaouen/Blue City) and not doing the coastal city (Essaouira).


What I’m looking for:

Family-friendly riad recommendations in Marrakech – spacious enough for 4, comfortable, and good value for money. Budget is around $1,000–$1,200 for 3 nights. I'm currently considering Riad Nayanoura near the Medina

Food + cafes: Best restaurants with outdoor seating, vibrant spots for tea/coffee, and fun, cultural vibes we can’t get in the U.S.

Hidden gems: Cool stops along the way to Merzouga, unique activities, or underrated spots people often miss.

Kid-friendly tips: Anything that helps make the trip smoother with little ones.


Basically, I’d love to hear about the coolest things you’ve done in Marrakech, the desert, or along this route—whether restaurants, activities, or cultural experiences.

Thanks in advance for any advice!

If your idea of ""high-stakes gameplay"" is trying to finish a cargo run before you hear footsteps coming down the hall, then you might be in the right place.

We're a small but growing community of gamers, mostly dads, who love Star Citizen but have accepted that our reaction times have been nerfed by sleep deprivation. We've built a casual, no-pressure environment for people who have jobs, families, and other real-life commitments that always take priority.

**Who are we?**

We're an organization and Discord community built on the simple principle that gaming should be a relaxing escape, not another source of stress. We get that you might have to go AFK with zero notice because a kid is awake, the dog just threw up, or your spouse is giving you *the look*. No one will ever give you grief for it here.

**What we do in Star Citizen:**

* **Everything, slowly:** Industrial runs (mining/salvage), bounty hunting, bunkers, exploration, and the occasional ""let's see if we can land three Rocs in a C2 without everything exploding"" shenanigans.
* **Helping New Players:** The 'verse is confusing. We're happy to show you the ropes without any pressure.
* **Group Events (that are 100% optional):** We'll try to get together for things like Jumptown or Xenothreat when it aligns with our schedules, but there are no mandatory ops. Ever.

**Who we're looking for:**

You're probably a great fit if:

* You're a parent or just someone with a busy adult life.
* Your prime gaming hours are late in the evening.
* You want a chill, mature group to hang out with and talk about games, dad jokes, and whatever else comes up.
* You're looking for a group that values teamwork and fun over hardcore min/maxing.

Our Discord server is active for Star Citizen, but we play other games too. It's become a solid place for like-minded people to just connect and decompress.

**Requirements:**

* Be a decent human being. No drama, no toxicity.
* Have a mic for comms.
* Patience. Both for the game and for your fellow org mates who might have just spilled coffee on their keyboard.

If this sounds like your speed, come say hello in our Discord and see if it's a good fit.

[**https://discord.gg/EZnjewZHSF**](https://discord.gg/EZnjewZHSF)

1nixtw7,https://i.redd.it/gmdbgkp07mpf1.jpeg,Gold & Greed Homonym Clue,"In the doc Justin says to “watch and LISTEN” (emphasis mine). One logical way to hide a clue while speaking would be to use homonyms.

If English is your second language like it is for me, here is the definition of homonyms: 

each of two or more words having the same spelling or pronunciation but different meanings and origins. The example I am pointing out here is “sense” and “cents.”

In episode 2 (about 36:52) while describing the when he told Brandon about 9 Mile Hole, Justin states that Brandon’s reaction was “ hmm, that actually might make CENTS.” I believe this is a call back to a stamp in the Forrest Fenn book, “Once Upon a While” on story starting on page 52, “Divorce Logic”. The picture above, you can see Forrest Fenn switched the idiom “My Two Cents” to “My Two Sense.”

If you’re interested in the chapter, here is the context of the stamp in the picture above:

Divorce Logic

Back in the mid 1980s, I met a nice married couple at an opening in our art gallery. They were in their twenties, and people smiled at the sight of them walking around, holding hands, and munching on the finger foods we had near the wine cooler. In subsequent weeks I saw them infrequently around town, whispering to each other and holding hands.
I don't remember her name, so for some subliminal reason I'll call her Angel. She was walking toward me one day as I departed the bank on Palace Avenue, Her eyes were red, her hair was a gnarled muddle, and she was sobbing uncontrollably. I was startled by the sight of her.

We stopped to talk, and as she smeared a hankie across her face, she explained what a bad person her ex-husband was and that she would never recover from what he did to her. ""It's been two months, you know."" No, I didn't know, but that was okay.
After a long coffee respite at the Plaza Cafe, her emotions subsided somewhat. I learned that Angel was a professional potter who was trying to support herself in a failing market. I felt terrible, and wondered what I could do to help.

Finally, it came to me. I told her to go and make her divorce in the form of a pot because we were going to have a funeral for it. She started laughing and hugged me, and then laughed and hugged me some more.
The spell of doom was broken and she hurried away to her studio.

Well, ten days later, I was digging a hole at the north end of Room Block 2 at San Lazaro Pueblo. It was beside a prehistoric path that led down to an ancient clay mine. Angel was sniffling into her hankie. It had been an awkward 45 minute drive.

She had made the ugliest pottery-thing I have ever seen. It was about 18 inches high, 10 inches across, and was littered with dismal, black figures with jagged edges. The iron nails that she had intermittently driven into that poor vessel were destroyed and crumbling as a result of the high-temperature firing. Angel had written her ex's name in big black letters, but I am sure it was misspelled. ""Ferd,"" it said. I wondered what that was all about.

After she threw some personal things into the pot, I put the lid on, placed it reverently into the ground, and covered it up with dirt.
Then she started piling rocks on the grave... and kept piling them on.
I suppose maybe she was afraid that somehow her divorce would get out of the hole.

I decided to leave her alone to conduct the funeral, and walked back to wait in the car.
Well, I've never heard such carrying on. It was so loud! There was yelling and sobbing, singing and screaming, and spiteful maledictions.

A few of the words she spat had definitions I was not even cognizant of. During one phase of the tantrum, I heard her scream ""FRED!"" — and tha's about the same time the blossoms started falling from a nearby cholla cactus.

I quickly rolled my car windows up and considered the notion that maybe I should have been a therapist instead of an art dealer. f

It is fun to notice how quickly attitudes can change when the right stimuli is introduced to a situation. I can imagine that down through history, more than one fracas has been started because some big-shot's coffee wasn't hot enough, or someone's chicken got stolen.

If you read this far, so what? What’s the clue referring to? One might believe this is a Lincoln National Forrest reference - for example. Not saying it is but sharing to see what it might inspire or provide for you all. Cheers. 🍻 ",2,1758066734.0,beyondthemapsedge,6,1.0,False

In today's world, we are more in contact with the internet feed (content) than we are with people. That's why I strongly believe that we are getting shaped by the content we consume.

For the last couple of years, I've been analizing my behaviour and daily habits. I noticed I usually have two types of working days: fully proactive and fully numb (I'm not counting the days where I mindfully decide to relax and enjoy my day).

The difference between those two modes is huge. When I'm proactive, I start my day with plan. I have some ""healthy"" breakfast, like eggs, cheese, and some small amount of meat, I start working. I finish my tasks. I organize the coffee break with some friends. After that, I continue working on another task. Usually I go to the gym, after working hours. Than I have decent launch/dinner, probably some rice and meat. And after that, I usually chill or do some research on the internet.  
On the other hand, when I'm numb, I do a lot of sugary snacks. I postpone my work a lot, I watch plenty of Youtube. I mess up my ""healthy"" diet routine. And I finish my day without energy, and not knowing what I did the whole day.

These two types of working days are coming in seasons for me. I have couple of weeks in one mode, another couple of weeks in another.

The key difference for me is my non-fictional reading habit. Once I'm reading, I feel my mind is primed for the productive day. My focus is on point, and I can strive for being proactive and decide what I really want from my day. If I leave this part to the internet, it will serve me all sorts of things which will be great distraction for my mind.

But reading self-help books is only a part of solution for me. I started noticing that as soon as finish with one particular book, I usually lose focus from the next one, and I fall down into my non-proactive mode.

That's why I started to read more mindfully, and focus on extracting notes from those books. So I can revisit them on the daily basis. This helps me keep my focus on everything I was reading, and I swap my bad habit of watching Youtube or any random feed, with revisiting old notes I took. This is really helping me stay focused for the last couple of months.

I was using regular notebooks for this, but I had issues with itthem because they take additional space, and they are not always with me. So I switched using the app called Bloomind. Of course you can use whatever suits you, but having those notes close to me, all the time, is kinda game changer to me. Because I didn't magically erase my bad habit of scrolling, I replaced it with something that keeps me focused on my goals and knowledge I want to intake.  
  
I hope this post will get someone to start thinking more mindfully and carefully about the content they let inside their world. It's the one thing that we are constantly bombarded with, and it reshapes our priorities and thinking. So I really hope more people start controlling what is served in front of their eyes and ears.

The difference is one was a civil rights leader that in my opinion did a lot of good for America, even though his messages have been massaged by the government over the decades. The other inspired and moved millions of people, especially young people, to positions of subjugating minorities and women, calling for rights to be stripped from other Americans, and only very recently getting on the side of maybe ethnic cleansing isn’t always a good thing.  They were both figureheads of a movement that shaped America though, so that’s where the comparison would stand.
>>Both were imperfect men, and I think both would fully admit that.  I do think people are taking sides on the Kirk thing though, either whitewashing him or dragging his name through the mud, both unnecessarily.  He definitely had strong opinions, but everyone calling him hateful is misinformed. Regardless, no one deserves to be violently murdered in front of their wife and toddlers.  If he had such abhorrent views, why did our governor sit down and do a podcast with him? Something isn’t lining up.
>>>Charlie Kirk called for the death penalty for gay people, said Black people were stealing jobs from white people, said Islam was a cancer that was incompatible with civil/western society, etc...........

They behave in a way no one else does and i feel like the work place would be better without them.

It's simple things. When you're opening a door and there are people behind you, it's polite to hold the door so it doesn't slam in their face. Maybe even hold it open so people can walk through first. When you do the latter, literally everybody looks at you smiles and says thank you. Throw a dart on any combination of age/race/gender/job title and every single person would acknowledge it. Except them. They will walk through the door without looking or acknowledging like it is something that you owe them. They don't clean up after themselves. Making tea or coffee, they will leave a giant spill by the machine and walk away. If they make a mess eating food, they will not clean it up.

They will cut in line nonstop. Everyone's at work, no one wants a confrontation so people usually don't say anything. And that is taken advantage of. Although I do notice, they don't do it to black people. Or to me. I'm also an immigrant, I have no problem saying something. Which is another thing, they fold immediately when confronted. They will act in the most brazen, inconsiderate way because they know most people won't say anything. Confronted, that behavior quickly evaporates. 

At work, honestly, it's 50/50. Either they are good at their job or absolutely useless and incompetent. They love ass kissing. Unless you're the subordinate, then it's constant chest puffing and rank pulling. You probably won't be a subordinate though. Once they get in a position of power, they only hire people from their country. Like clockwork. I don't even know if this post will be allowed, but yeah, I'm kind of sick that this group and this group only can't follow basic workplace etiquette. ",10,1758065109.0,offmychest,14,0.63,False

1nix6dr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1nix6dr/my_butt_has_quit_its_full_time_job_any_advice/,My butt has quit it's full time job. Any advice?,"Hello all! I come to you in a time of great need. I (24 F) have suddenly stopped pooping. I need some answers, some insight, anything really. I've never had bowel problems before so I'm lost in the dark. I'm not looking for an IBS diagnosis here, just if anyone had any advice.

Now, I'm being a bit dramatic here, but for the last few months (let's say 4 months) I have had an awful relationship between me and my bowels. I can poop a little bit on occasion, every few days I will strain so hard to expel a tiny, hard pebble. Otherwise, I take a laxative if I haven't pooped in several days, and those usually work fine (dulcolax, although it keeps me up all night because the process hurts so bad).

I am also bloating like crazy. After I take a laxative and have my bowels cleared out, the second I take a bite or a sip of something, I blow up like a balloon, pregnant looking almost (I am not pregnant, took many tests). It feels and looks awful, and is even starting to affect my intimate life with my partner. With the massive solid logs of dookie sitting in my intestines, bedroom stuff starts to get painful.

The strangest part of it all is that I have no idea what is causing it. I just woke up one day and lost my ability to poop normally, nothing changed in my life, nothing changed about my water intake or my diet or exercise, just poop stopped coming. I do everything (mostly) right in terms of poop. I drink lots of water, I eat my fiber in my fruits and veggies, I exercise daily, I use a squatty potty, I have a coffee every morning which also used to make me poop. Not even Taco Bell crunchwrap supreme could save me...

My job is the same, my stress levels are the same, everything is the same! I'm so confused and frustrated as to why my poop hole decided to quit it's full time job, no three weeks notice. Plus the awful bloating on top of all that. I should also note that I'm not gassy, I toot much less now actually, and none of them smell (they used to rival biochemical weapons).

Before anyone comments, I have made a doctors appointment, but I wanted to come on here and see if anyone has had the same odd experience as me, every other post I've read was ""drink more water, eat more fiber, call the doctor, exercise, take a laxative"" to which I've done all of those things with no change to my issue. The result of my doctors appointment was them telling me to use restorlax and Metamucil, then call them if it doesn't work. They said they ""aren't worried"", but hey, I'm worried!!! Poop has taken over my life!!! I feel terrible, I look terrible, I've started losing my appetite over the fact that I know the food is just going to sit in my intestines and make me feel heavier and sluggish. It hurts, I feel sick, and this crap stinks, literally.

Other important info would be that there is no history of Crohn's or similar diseases in my family, and my normal pooping habits used to be once daily, feeling relatively emptied. 

For now, I am going to try my doctor's suggestion of restorlax daily until I'm emptied, and then daily Metamucil.

Any insight or kind advice is much appreciated. Has anyone else here just stopped pooping suddenly? With absolutely no explanation? ",4,1758065017.0,ibs,3,0.84,False

**Link:** [**www.amazon.com/dp/B0FR8GV7PJ**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FR8GV7PJ)

**Blurb:**

Magic is real, and Reggie Hickson just got invited to be a wizard school summer camp transfer.

Reggie was a self-made businessman who'd pulled himself and his oddball dad out of poverty through sheer determination and the glory of YouTube tutorials. Pretty impressive, honestly. That was until a three-inch tall sprite emerged from his coffee mug and told him he was a wizard. Scratch that—a warlock. Apparently there's a difference, and that difference involves stuff we probably shouldn't go into in this good Christian blurb.

Now he's at Thistlewick School of Wizardcraft and Witchery, surrounded by monster girls from a magical land called Everafter who are all conveniently inexperienced with boys for women averaging a century or more in age. First, he meets Tizzy, an adorable lisping jackalope girl, but she's just the first of many monster cuties that he ends up entangled with. Sphinxes, valkyries, fairies, oh my! It's a good thing stamina is one of Reggie's ""warlocky"" strengths.

Oh, and he has less than a week to brush up on two years of magical curriculum and pass the placement exam or he'll be held back when the semester starts while his new lady friends move on to senior year.

No pressure or anything.

Summoner Summer Camp is a progression-filled romp about a guy trying to ace his exams while his overeager cabinmates treat him like a walking mana dispenser. Do not read while in line at the bank.",17,1758064859.0,haremfantasynovels,1,0.95,False

No. But there are less than maybe 5 qbs across the NFL that could have success with this team(much less consistent success) and I'm tired of people thinking that we can just pick up some other qb and become a winning team all of a sudden.

Married with no kids but we do have the World’s Best Sphynx Cat named Obi. We’ve lived all over the US and Oregon, and having been in PDX again for a couple years have just bought a home here in Cedar Hills.

After all the moves, I find myself at a really awkward age to be essentially friendless. My existing friends live time zones away, and I have to make some local ones. Being childless might present the first challenge. (No hesitation making parent friends, though!) Also, most social visits seem to hinge on a bar or restaurant trip (which, I could do with fewer, and that is a bit unusual—or so it seems).

Bumble BFF made me some good matches since last year, but they somehow are all kind of a commute, and sadly, that’s more of a wedge than I thought. My current situation could *really* use some dude friends / couple friends right here in Beaverton. Even in Cedar Hills specifically, if possible—such a great neighborhood, and I (call me naive) would love the ability to just walk down the street to hang out. It seems perfect for that, but I’m not getting many conversations started just walking around here yet. But generally, just hoping to get to know some of my Beaverton neighbors better.

I hesitate to call myself an introvert, because for me, there’s nothing better than a real conversation. I also love music (indie/postpunk/electronic), coffee, an occasional beer, pets, video games (Steam Deck rules!), board games, talking about anything tech, psychology, surreal films, generative art, cooking, hiking, running, web development. Above all, I appreciate people who can laugh through the utter absurdity of life. This is what keeps us resilient!

As mentioned, couple friends would be nice to have, too! My wife (50F) has several of these interests, and also plants, home design, and minimalism.

If this is interesting, it would be great to do a coffee meetup in Cedar Hills to start an IRL sync. Let me know if you’re up for it!",34,1758064241.0,beaverton,9,0.9,False

Today wasn't great and I need empathy.,"I am one of the ones that had a single mom that did drugs, partied, neglected me, allowed me to raise myself (and her), and hit and used terrible words towards me.  Blah blah blah. I've processed and I love my mom and miss her (she passed). She had a bad life and we (""us"" as in Gen X) were the last generation raised without any guardrails, no real guidance for parents on how to parent.  My family, going back three generations were all abandoned by their mothers and raised by Grandmothers (so she probably considered it a win that she was even there).

But, there are still things that remain. Like grounds in a cup of coffee.  I am remodeling and then moving. My husband (a millennial),  a very simple guy when it comes to possessions, has been handling most of the packing and prep while I have been sequestered in our new addition. A very small 400 square foot granny unit.

I've been giving up my possessions over the years since my first marriage. At first out of necessity, then because my second husband prefers minimalism. then it was because I was trying to deal with empty nest - and now today - seeing everything I own stacked in the garage - years of my art, book collections, my kids things, my mom's things, I broke. I hate moving. It scares me.

Growing up, I never lived in one house for more than a year. My school district would change with each move. And because my mom worked, I had to learn to walk to school, memorizing the route as young as six. She would follow me in her car until I could do it. I would have reoccurring nightmares of not finding my way home. Even now,  I will wake up and not be sure how to find the door to the bathroom.

Each move always came as a shock - as I remember it. Boxes would appear, we would drain her water bed down and then fill it up, cat and dog put in apple boxes so they wouldn't run away - she had it down to a science, a routine.

In my own life, I sought connection and stability over love and repeated this relationship by marrying an abuser. He had money and I stayed because it was only me he was hitting and more than anything I wanted my kids to have stability. Then he began to hit them. I left.

Upending life again now is really hard - I can endure almost anything, even abuse - to have stability.  I have no reservations about my move - I just wish these feelings weren't so pervasive, so difficult to overcome, to get out of my own way.

The last decade has been hard- trauma, chronic health issues, solo parenting, financial strain- so I never fully processed how draining she was. I always thought she texted too much. She reported her day to me (I’m getting coffee, I’m eating lunch, I’ve had 7 phone calls at work, etc.) But she built up the frequency with time and there were so many things that demanded my immediate attention that I never pulled these fleeting annoyances to the forefront of my mind. And I wondered if I was being fair. I never want to be that friend who has no time for people just cuz I’m going through something. Plus, I’m sure I’m annoying at times, too. So, I tried to be enagaging but the more time went on and the more vulnerable I became as traumatic events and health issues unfolded, the more she flooded me with minutia.

Attempts to set boundaries or shift the dynamic went nowhere. If confronted, she’d play the victim. When my life got especially heavy this year- declining health, a death in the family, a cancer scare- she listened less and talked more. Her “support” was canned (“I’m sorry, that sucks”) while she cycled through the same repetitive topics and fantasies, like stating we wanted to live together despite me saying no many times. Every time she'd bring it up, it was like I'd never said no before. It sometimes feels like talking to an NPC. I also noticed she had this habit of conflating our identities even though we’re not the same kind of person and don’t even look alike. It feels like she lives in some internal delusion and I’m just a character in her fantasy that she projects onto.

Two weeks ago, I finally snapped after she ignored my need for rest after a biopsy- a procedure she showed no real care or concern for. She kept texting me random stuff and I didn’t respond. So, she asked how I was and I told her I was in pain and needed rest. She immediately sent a barrage of texts and photos about her day as though she was just waiting for me to wake up and respond so she could flood into my phone and mind with her own stuff. I told her she was self-absorbed and went into detail about why I was done. To be clear, this was not the first and only warning. I’d been pulling back for some time and had told her I needed more space in my life. But the more I took space, the more she attempted to occupy it with conversations becoming more and more one-sided until I was receiving ever increasing details that were increasingly banal and unnecessary (i.e. telling me details about going to the bathroom!). I started to realise it was deliberate.

Since pulling back, I feel like a fog has lifted. She’s already trying to push us back into old patterns, repeating behaviors I directly called out. I feel I’ve given her more attention and patience than she ever gave me. But she’s pushing to talk and a part of me wonders: do I owe her a final chance to respond, or is it fair to just disengage?",2,1758064033.0,AmItheAsshole,11,0.63,False

I think this is nice as it adds a pop of colour without being too OTT: https://www.dunelm.com/product/bonnie-scallop-natural-border-wool-rug-1000229263?defaultSkuId=30922131&rugSize=160cm+x+230cm+%285ft+x+7.5ft%29&colour=Sage

1niwlk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/GithubCopilot/comments/1niwlk8/extension_ask_me_copilot_tool_the_best_knowledge/,[Extension] Ask Me Copilot Tool - the best knowledge base is you!,"**Copilot keeps stubbornly “fixing” my code… so we built a VS Code extension to make him ask me instead**

I was sitting with a colleague, watching Copilot work. For the tenth time in a row, it was trying to fix the same file - failing again and again, just because of a silly import error.

Instead of stopping, it just kept banging its head against the wall.

And I noticed something deeper: when Copilot runs into trouble, it often loses context, leaves errors unresolved, and eventually stops progressing.

A human developer would simply pause, rethink, and ask: “Hey, what should I do here?”

Copilot doesn’t. And here’s why - his system prompts are designed in a way that makes this problem worse:

* He’s in a hurry. The prompt literally pushes it to “do everything quickly,” which leads to reckless fixes. If a library can’t be connected, Copilot may just rip it out and rewrite half the project.
* He must be independent. The design says “do as much as possible on your own.” So if you step away for coffee, you might return to a project that’s been heavily (and wrongly) refactored.
* The user is always right. Copilot will happily obey any nonsense you type, even if it makes things worse.

That means the usual workflow - spot an error -> tell Copilot about it -> expect it to learn - doesn’t really work well.

So we asked ourselves: We already have MCP servers for knowledge bases, codebases, docs…

Why can’t I, the developer, also act as a knowledge base — but not as a “user,” more like another trusted utility? If I stop them and send new instruction - it can lose context more quickly.

That’s why we built a tiny extension. Really tiny, offline and you can do the same by yourself in few hours. 

Here’s what it does:

* If Copilot fails once or twice - it escalates and asks you, the expert.
* If Copilot finishes a task - it asks you to check the result.

The effect? Suddenly Copilot feels less like a stubborn assistant and more like a genuine coding partner.

  
I’m pretty sure there’s a 99% chance something like this already exists, but I just couldn’t find it. If it does — please drop me a link, I’d really appreciate it!

Another question for you: how have you dealt with these Copilot quirks? What approaches actually work to make it help rather than get in the way?

For now, we’ve just hacked together a quick extension — maybe it’ll be useful to someone.

  
But you have to add in prompt - Always ask expert in case of ... (And it will good work with Claude Sonnet 4, with free models... they are very stupid to use tools)

  
So, main point - some times Copilot works fine if you just a tool for him, not a user, try it in other case, and you will see the difference.",5,1758063527.0,GithubCopilot,2,1.0,False
1niwkuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1niwkuc/34f_us_for_your_new_nerdy_best_friend_inquire/,"34F, US, For your new nerdy best friend inquire within!","I'm rather nerdy. I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1niwjz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1niwjz1/i_have_strong_feelings_for_my_co_worker/,I have strong feelings for my co worker,"I’m [20M] going out with a work colleague [23] of mine. I’ve known her since around February, and she’s a very sweet and friendly girl. That last point is actually what concerns me the most. Usually, she’s the kind of girl who rejects any guy who even asks for her Instagram, and among her followers there are only girls—except for me and a friend of mine. In fact, she often tells me about guys who approached her and how she turned them down. Since they know where she works, many often come just for her, but she keeps ignoring them. Once she told me about a guy who asked her out for coffee, and she basically told him to fuck off.

We often have eye contact, even intense, and she’s very touchy only with me. Lately, our relationship has been growing and she’s started opening up to me about personal things in her life. The other day, jokingly, she said, “Today I feel like arguing with someone, I’m angry and I don’t even know why.” I played along and answered her ironically in a harsh way, and she said, “I could never get mad at you.” Also, we often hang out together and I always take her places. During work breaks, if I don’t smoke a cigarette with her, she pretends to get offended (again, jokingly).

The issue is that, since she’s extremely friendly with people she trusts, I’m afraid she might only see me as a best friend rather than a potential boyfriend. But at the same time, this doesn’t really explain why she keeps insisting on telling me about how she rejects other guys. She often tells me that I’m a very mature person and that I’m different from all the other guys.

TL;DR I really have strong feelings for her but i don’t know if she has the same feelings as me.",2,1758063417.0,dating_advice,8,1.0,False
