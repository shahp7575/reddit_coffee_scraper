**Why This Pick?**

This season, the Flames have been their best at home – plain and simple. And to be honest, their “best” hasn’t been great. Calgary has only won 2 of its last 5 road games, and both wins were against incredibly mediocre teams. Dallas on the other hand has won 6 of their last 7 outings, including their last 3 straight home games (two of which they won by 3 or more goals). I’m going after plus money here friends – give me the Stars to cover the PL.

1j4myn2,https://i.redd.it/lhb8wqjkuzme1.jpeg,Understanding the Kaldipress,"Preground (to the setting of aeropress) coffee from Blue Tokai and my new Kaldipress 🩷

Had a couple of questions. Would love it if you guys could help me. 

One level scoop (the one that comes with Kaldipress) is 11-12 gms. What water: coffee ratios should I go for? For this one, it was 12gms coffee with 150ml water. 

Once I pour water and stir for 10 seconds, what should be the wait time before I use the plunger? 

I use both the metal and paper filters. Yet, after 10 seconds of stir and a 2-minute wait time, 70% of the coffee has already dripped into my cup. I use the plunger only for the remaining 30%. Just wanted to know: is this how it's supposed to be?

The Kaldipress manual says to stop the plunger after hearing the hissing sound, which I get about halfway down the chamber. Most aeropress videos tell you to press almost to the bottom. Which one should it be? 

Feel free to share any other tips you guys have for Kaldipress. I've used it 4 times and twice, the taste was unnaturally bitter. What could I be doing wrong? 

Thanks! ☕

Imagine a world where judges consult algorithms over coffee breaks, deciding the fate of defendants with a quick CPU cycle. That's the legal sci-fi we're already part of, thanks to AI's infiltration into everything, from kitchen gadgets to courtrooms. But fear not, Virginia's got your due-process back!

Delegate Cliff Hayes is spearheading a bill to ensure AI doesn't go rogue in judicial matters. The message? AI might predict future crimes Minority Report-style, but humans still hold the gavel for now. The bill mandates that any AI-driven court decision undergoes human scrutiny and allows objections should the machine misfire.

Here's the kicker: If this bill gets the governor's nod, AI's role will be tethered, barred from autonomous action. But in an era where machines dream of electric sheep, is this cautious optimism or a drag on progress? What do you think—can AI truly serve justice, or is it merely a step towards robotic retribution? Share your thoughts and legal tales in the comments!",1,1741233819.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

I woke up and started typing away. Granted it's not much but I thought i would put feelers out there to see if there is any interest in something like this. 

This would be my first attempt at a cheesy rom-com? If that's what it is 🤷‍♀️ 

Im calling it: How My One Night Stand Turned Into Surviving A Zombie Apocalypse 

Oh, there is about lesbians soooooo if that's not your thing... sorry (not sorry) I also apologize for the bad formatting on my phone.

Well, enjoy! I will be ignoring my phone until tomorrow since I fear rejection and all that good stuff 😅




“See you Friday, Jason!” I yell over my shoulder as the elevator door dings open. A crowd of suits awaits me inside, all glued to their phones like they’re avoiding the world. I receive a few cordial nods and half-hearted smiles as I enter through the doors. Just another day at Wilkins & Lawson law firm.

I lean against the elevator wall as it descends, my mind completely checked out. Dinner plans? Thai? Maybe. All I know is that I am definitely not cooking tonight. My phone buzzes. Ugh. Probably another ‘urgent’ work email. They will just have to figure, whatever it is, out without me. It’s my first few days off in months and I certainly don’t mean to work through it.

A devilish smirk tugs at my lips as I swipe away the email. A few notifications from the dating app catch my eye. Now those, I will respond to. My thumb hovers over the screen, curiosity pulling me in.

Outside the firm, the chill September air bites at my face, coursing through the streets as the city bustles around me. The usual rush-hour madness. Cars blaring horns, people speed-walking like a fire is lit under their ass. This town is always fast-paced but todays feels urgent? I don’t know, maybe I’m just whipped after the hell this week has been. I dig around in my bag for my keys, almost dropping them. Smooth.

By the time I pull onto the highway, it’s already too late. Great. Gridlock. I check the time—seems a bit early for this heavy of traffic. It must be a wreck or something. With a labored sigh, I turn on the radio, searching for something to drown out the sounds of New York’s traffic.

Static. Commercials. Some random talk show chattering on about emergency broadcasts. My finger pauses. Wait, emergency broadcasts? God, what now? It’s always something. Probably just another drill. I flip through stations until I finally land on an ‘80s station. Better than nothing.
“And I’m hungry like the w—” The music cuts off abruptly, replaced by a panicked voice. “-We interrupt your entertainment broadcast for this urgent mess… static… Citizens are urged to stay… static… This is not a test. Avoid… static… public—”
I turn the radio off. 

Nope. Not today, world. I have better things to worry about than whatever faux- doomsday warning that was. Might as well see if anyone on the dating app is interesting tonight.
I start swiping through profiles. Half-naked guys trying way too hard, a few women who look suspiciously like stock photos. Typical.
One-thousand percent, no. Seriously? This guy has MAGA in his profile. Gross.

No. Dave and Joanna want a third? Hard pass.
No. Your profile pic is literally just your cat.
Maybe… ew, no. Cute guy, but taxidermy? That’s a nope from me.

Oh, hello, gorgeous red-head.
I stop on a profile. Luckybhan90. Her picture shows a statuesque woman with long red hair, green eyes and a smile that says, ""I’m trouble, and you’ll like it."" 

My heart feels like it could beat right out of my chest. Perfect. Just my type.
Her profile bio reads: “34. Taurus. On holiday from Belfast. Looking to sate my hunger for adventure while I’m stateside. NOT searching for ‘the one.’ Here for a night, not a lifetime.”

Well, that’s certainly direct. And I like that she’s not from here. For such a big city I feel like options are horribly thin. ""I hesitate for a second before swiping right. Is it wise? Meeting a stranger in a strange city at a fancy hotel? But it’s been ages since I felt this spark of spontaneity. Who am I kidding? 

With a sigh and a mischievous grin, I swipe right. My phone buzzes immediately—match. Guess it’s meant to be. A little adventure never hurt anyone...right?""

Luckybhan90: Hey, gorgeous. I was hoping we would match. I must say, I love a woman in a suit.
She was referring to a photo of me and one of my colleagues at a company party from a while back. It’s formal attire at the firm every day, but I managed to put in a little extra effort that particular day. It may just be the only photo of myself I actually don’t mind.

Traffic finally moves a little, so I toss my phone over to the passenger seat. I make a quick detour to the new Thai place. As the smell of takeout fills my car my stomach growls like I haven’t eaten in days. Which, honestly, feels accurate.

As soon as I get home, kick the door shut and put my briefcase on the table. The couch practically screams my name as I dig out the container of Pad Thai and my phone. Another message lights up the screen.

Luckybhan90: So, xLawless, what are you looking for? Coffee? Dinner? Sex? Or perhaps I could talk you into a combo package.

I grin and take a bite of food, quickly typing back.
Me (xLawless): Considering I’ve already had my coffee and am currently eating dinner… I’d say I’m left with only one option. My place or yours?

I pause, wondering if I should be more careful. Fuck it. I really don’t care. No red flags yet. Just… red hair.

Luckybhan90: I’d argue that’s the best option. My place. I’m staying at a hotel downtown—plenty of bright lights and witnesses in case you try to murder me or something. I’ll send the address.

I laugh, shaking my head.
Me (xLawless): Oh, trust me, after the week I’ve had, I don’t have enough energy for murder. So, lucky you. I’ll head your way in about an hour.

Luckybhan90: Save what energy you do have then. And lucky me, indeed.

I chuckle, tossing my phone aside and leaning back into the couch. My mind briefly flicks back to that emergency broadcast—what if something really is going on out there? Nah. Just another dramatic commercial, I’m sure. Right now, there’s Pad Thai and a gorgeous red-head waiting. The world can end later.

The hotel is nicer than I expected. I think in the back of my mind I was expecting something more along the lines of “what can I get for forty bucks a night?” ""The lobby is grand, all high-vaulted ceilings and Italian marble, but something feels... off. The lights seem dimmer than they should be, and I notice a line of people crowding the reception desk, only no one’s there. The usual murmur of conversation is replaced by anxious glances and quick, hushed voices. It feels like everyone’s waiting for something, or someone, to tell them it’s all going to be fine.""

Odd. No one seems to be working reception, yet the lobby is close to looking like a can of sardines.
I open my phone re-reading the message stating room number, 1215, before hitting the button for the twelfth floor on the elevator’s panel. Mirrors, all round me. I check my reflection in the mirror. I could have put more effort into my outfit. Then again, I didn’t dress to impress. If that were the case, I would have stayed in my designer suit I had on at work today.  Hoodie, black jeans, Jordan’s. Good enough.

As the elevator doors open, I step out in just enough time for a small family to run inside, frantically hitting the lobby floor button. The adults were panicked and disheveled. Their clothes and other personals barely zipped inside their suitcases. Their two young children crying. I caught just enough of a glance at one of the children’s shirts covered in… wait, was that… blood? What the hell? No. Kids are messy. Could be anything. 

I stopped at the end of the hallway, in front of room 1215 and took a breath. I knocked twice, softly. The door swayed open, and there she was:

Luckybhan90 - the real woman behind the screen, tall and toned, wrapped in a tight tank top and boy-shorts, her damp red hair hanging loose from what was clearly a recent shower. She had one hand grasping a bottle of wine, with two glasses propped confidently between her fingers. 

And she was beautiful. Like really, seriously beautiful. The kind of beauty that is actually capable of knocking the wind from your lungs. Her pictures didn’t come close to doing her justice.

She narrowed her eyes and gave me smirk. "" I’m glad to see you didn’t waste any effort on an outfit that won’t matter"" she said, as her eyes flicked over my casual clothes. She winked, stepping aside to let me in. ""Come in, make yourself comfortable. I'll pour us a drink. Oh, and don't mind Nox. He will judge you, but he won't bite—unless I tell him to."" I can already tell that smirk of hers is going to be trouble.

Until just now, I hadn't even considered the accent before now but hearing her speak… Hot. Redhead. Irish.

 Good lord.

The couch is occupied by a hulking, all-black German Shepherd with eyes so sharp they feel like they’re seeing through me. His ears twitch as he follows my every move, a low, almost inaudible growl rumbling in his throat. For a split second, his gaze flickers to her before landing back on me, like he’s waiting for some unseen signal to either trust me or attack. Luckybhan gives him a dismissive wave, ‘Don’t mind Nox—he’s a bit dramatic.’ But I can’t shake the feeling that I’m the one who’s not supposed to be here. 

He looked as if he was waiting for an excuse—any excuse—to determine whether I was friend or dinner. If anybody's killing somebody tonight, it's probably the dog.

I went to the kitchen counter, casually leaning against it—mostly to keep a safe distance from the four-legged demon standing guard over the couch. ""Honestly, I'm just glad to be out of work clothes. I feel like I never have a chance to wear anything actually comfortable,"" I said, watching her pour the wine. ""Your profile said you were on holiday. So, what made you decide to visit New York? I can’t imagine the city having better views than back home.""

After handing me a glass of wine, she leaned back against the fridge, her vivid green eyes holding my gaze before she responded. ""I beg to differ,"" she said with a slow, teasing smile. ""There's a beautiful view right in front of me."" Damn. Smooth.
Her gaze lingers on me, warm and intense, and I feel heat rising beneath my skin. She downs her wine slowly, her eyes never leaving mine, a faint, playful smile tugging at her lips. 

My heart pounds as her hand brushes against mine, fingers slipping through mine, firm yet soft. Her touch leaves a tingling warmth that spreads like wildfire. My breath catches, and I wonder if she feels this too. Then, before I can think, her lips press against mine, soft but electric, igniting something I didn’t know I’d been holding back.

For a second, I hesitate, wondering how fast things are moving, but the look in her eyes wipes away any doubt. I can feel her heartbeat quickening under my fingers as my hands slide to her waist, gripping her hips. She leans in harder, and I lose myself in the heat between us, feeling everything else slip away.

I instinctively put my hands on her hips, tightening my grip as she pushes her body into mine, our tongues dancing as one. She bites down on my bottom lip, tugging gently before pulling away with a smirk. She takes my hand, leading me into the bedroom.

She wastes no time giving me a gentle push onto the bed, straddling me as she works her hands under my shirt to unlatch my bra. Within moments, my shirt and bra had become one with the floor. I run my hands up the side of her neck and pull her face to mine. 

Her touch is soft and knowing as she caresses my breasts. I quickly reach down and pull of her shorts revealing nothing underneath. Just her bare, beautiful body. I grip the inside of her thighs and she kisses me more fiercely as I work my fingers inside of her. She lets out an intoxicating moan and digs her nails into my back. 

In the other room, Nox's bark pierces the air, sharp and urgent. I freeze, startled, and she pulls back, biting her lip in frustration. ‘Nox, you cock block!’ she mutters with a sigh, glancing at the door. But Nox’s bark grows louder, his nails scratching against the floor as though warding off an invisible threat.

She let out a frustrated sigh and said “I am so sorry. I don’t know what’s gotten into him. I’m going to check on him and be right back. Those pants of yours better be off when I get back.” She shot me a wink as she left the room. 

A few long moments passed before I finally decided to go and check on them in the other room. I saw her trying to console Nox as he was now growling at the door. “Is everything ok?” I spoke softly as to not draw attention to this very pissed off looking dog. She stood and turned towards me “I have no idea what’s with him tonight. He only ever acts like this while we are working, when he’s about to attack.” 

“Wait, when ‘we’ are working? What do you so for wor…” My question was cut short when something massive crashed against the door startling both of us and causing Nox to bark even more aggressively.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j4mthq,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1j4mthq/this_side_of_styx/,This Side of Styx,"Darkness...real goddamn diabolical darkness exists. You'd understand too if you had seen it looking at you from underneath the crack of a door - eyes bulging like to balloons pressured to bursting and what remaining teeth cracking and breaking.

The sad reality is that I have forgotten my wife's face and her voice; but, twenty-six years later, I still remember every detail of that goddamn thing. If I could forget it, I would.

Good riddance.

But duty and a promise to the man who helped me stop it the first time prevents me from doing that. It has a new herald - I've seen the signs - and one of you is that creature's marked one. So, I am diving back into that horrible night so that maybe you will recognize the signs in yourself. If you do, contact me. We will step over the river together.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

“Do you believe in darkness, sheriff? In my younger years, I believed in the undeniable truth that darkness and light coexisted, woven into the very atoms of the universe. There was good and there was bad. Period. And, if a person could but walk the straight and narrow path, they could be considered a hero in their own right. After all, that was what made me idolize those flights of fancy printed colorfully on pulp pages.”

*Click*

I sighed, dragging on my Camel and the cigarette was half ash already. The old lady wouldn’t have liked me smoking again, but under the circumstances, I think she would have understood.

I stared at the tape recorder in my hand, avoiding the photos in the file. I couldn’t look at them again. Instead, I took another puff of the cancer mist before exhaling.

Yeah, Betsy *would* have understood.

I crushed the cigarette onto a newspaper clipping of the so-called miracle doctor - then lit another.

*Click*

“It was not until I was older that I found the shadow between the two -the gray, if you prefer- was a much more prevalent state than light and darkness, good and bad, or hero and villain. But now? Now I am convinced that I was incorrect. Darkness, true darkness exists. You will see it, sheriff, between the stars, deep beneath the waves, and in the hearts of even those you claim as innocent. There are no ‘victims;’ just lesser shadows overpowered and consumed by a greater blackness.”

*Clcck*

“Goddamn monster,” I grumbled to myself before setting the recorder on my desk. It was a device wholly outdated, but the town barely paid my salary.

Miracle man of the valley.

Everyone in Styx knew of or knew the doctor. He was a bright spot that brought attention to a sleepy town where the buildings and people were slowly aging into oblivion. Unfortunately, now it looked as if his reputation was about to grow and so would the attention on my small little town.

I looked at the monitor. The grainy TV feed didn’t hide the doctor’s stare. His eyes, sharp despite the blur, seemed to lock onto mine through the screen. There was a sharp, salty smell all of the sudden.

I shivered with the chill traveling down my spine.

Still looking directly at the camera, the doctor smiled with his perfect pearl white teeth and took a sip of water from the paper cup before crumpling it in his hands. The jingle of his cuffs and chains filled the small room and was loud enough that I heard it through the paper thin wall next to me.

“Sheriff Grady,” he called in a singsong voice loud enough to be heard through the wall, “smoking is a filthy habit.”

I sighed and rubbed my temples, ready to be done with the shrink. The state trooper couldn’t get here soon enough. I had fourteen peaceful years as sheriff without anything more dangerous than the McCaffery boys drinking, driving, and smashing mailboxes with a bat. Now? Now there was blood in the water; sharks were circling toward us with press passes and cameras; and bodies were piled into a grotesque mound in the morgue beneath my feet.

“You aren’t gonna go back in there, are ya?” Henry asked from the kitchen doorway, voice low. At least, I hoped it was low enough.

Henry walked across my office, which was little more than the kitchen of the converted house that contained both my “office” on the first floor as well as the town mortuary in the basement. As the mortician and backup deputy whenever I needed it, Henry knew the doctor’s handiwork probably better than me.

Henry leaned against the teal painted cabinetry and yanked bloodied rubber gloves off his hands before. He had been hard at work on the Johnson boy’s body. Or what was left of it after the doctor had finished with it.

“The coffee is stale,” he said to me, but that didn’t stop Henry from drinking it.

“Heat it up, then.”

“No reason,” Henry replied, downing the remainder of the mug like a shot. “I doubt we’re getting any warmth tonight.”

I just grunted and pulled out the old Jack from my desk. He held his cup up for some, and we made a silent toast to the dismembered boy below.

I shivered and wrinkled my nose at the smell of an incoming tide.

“You get anything out of him?”

“Nothing useful.” I blackened the other eye in the clipping with the cigarette butt before using Henry’s empty mug as my ashtray. “The good Dr. E. J. Christiansen is a narcissist. He talks like he wants to be one of those killers getting interviews on the evening news.”

Dr. Christiansen spoke like what my pa would have called ‘a damnable flapping asshole of a pretentious prick.’ One of my father’s pearls of wisdom would have made me smile in other circumstances. Not now.

Either way, it was as if the miracle doctor seemed to hope his over-familiarity with an earmarked thesaurus might make him a little less forgettable. But he could throw all the fancy words and phrases he wanted into this diatribe, but I planned to forget Dr. Christiansen as soon as the man was stuffed into the darkest corner the county jail had to offer. The inmates would take care of the child murderer after that.

At least, I hoped so.

I looked at the TV showing the doctor who was still handcuffed and chained in the “interrogation” room. That room used to be a kid’s bedroom. Now a monster sat inside it. That wasn’t lost on me.

“Any news on how long the staties would take to get here?” I asked.

Henry shook his head and said, “Not a peep. But it might have to do with the buster of a storm we got brewing out there.”

“Storm?” I strained my ears, but it seemed quiet outside.

“Been all over the local radio,” Henry responded. “Popped up out of nowhere and is raging in Helena. Already killed two at least.”

“Someone we know?”

“Old Henderson and his boy coming back from fishing.”

“Damn.”

“Swept them and their truck right down the edge of the valley and wrapped them around a tree,” Henry said. “Probably wouldn’t have been known about neither if Clive hadn’t been a couple of hundred yards behind them. Said it was like a giant hand had swatted them off the road like a fly. Told Clive they would have to store the bodies in the Helena butcher freezer. We don’t have the room.”

“Damn,” I repeated dumbly before lighting another cigarette. More bodies of people I knew growing cold before the sun set on that awful day.

*Click*

“A torrent is approaching, Sheriff Grady,” the untouched cassette recorder played, making us jump. “The depths are rising, and not even Noah’s vessel would endure what has awakened.”

“Christ,” I hissed, feeling my heart pounding and what little hair I had left standing on end. I smashed the stop button angrily. “Piece of junk.”

“Is all well, Sheriff Grady?” the doctor called through the wall. I looked at the TV and saw that he was smiling ear-to-ear.

“Bastard,” I growled. I stood and popped my back before picking up the recorder and Colt 1911. “Well, if this storm is as bad as you say, I might as well get the rest of the interrogation done.”

“Leave it for the staties, Grady.”

“The quicker the damn doctor confesses, the quicker he can see the chair,” I told him, holstering the pistol in my side sling. “I don’t have anywhere else to be, but you go home to Kris and the boys.”

“Leave you here alone with him? Not a chance,” Henry scoffed. “Besides, her mother is there to help with the twins. Kris won’t be alone.”

I nodded, happy that I wouldn’t be solo for this even if I was too hard headed to admit it to Henry. The idea of it just being the doctor and me was terrifying. If I’m being honest, that was one reason I had stopped the interview short earlier. Even having Henry only a flight of stairs away was too far when I had to sit across from a demon wearing a muddied, bloodied suit.

Taking a deep breath, I grabbed the file and returned to my seat across from the doctor. After flipping the cassette in the recorder and clicking in two buttons, I looked up at the doctor. He was smirking at me.

I wanted to hit him. Hard.

Leaning forward, I enunciated clearly, “June 13th, 6:52 p.m. Continuing interview of Dr. Emmanuel Judah Christiansen.” With the preamble out of the way, I sat back and sighed. “Where were we?”

“Are you well, Tom?”

“Sheriff,” I snapped like a whip. “It’s Sheriff Grady to you, Christiansen.”

The doctor sucked on his teeth before giving a deep chuckle. Predatory. He was the cat. I the mouse. Watching me with those hungry eyes, the doctor tapped on the table with long, thin fingers. They were the fingers of a city boy, clean and pristine, that had never seen an ounce of hard, manual work.

Until today. Until the butchery of the Johnson boy.

I was sick to my stomach and avoided looking at the closed file now on the table.

“I apologize, Sheriff Grady,” the doctor said with a surprising amount of warmth. “I was under the mistaken perception that we were on a first name basis after all the conversations we had after your lovely wife…”

“Stay on topic, doctor,” I snapped at the bastard shrink. “You already admitted to killing the Johnson boy-”

“Denying it would have been futile given the blood on my hands.”

“-his parents, and three others who tried to detain you. So, now I just need to know why,” I finished, ignoring his interruption.

“Why.” Christiansen nodded as he said the word. A look of deep thought gave him the appearance of serenity, which I admit shook me more than I’d have liked. The monster felt no remorse for what he did.

“Yes, *why*?” I repeated. I swallowed the bile building in the back of my throat. “*Why* did you take Ryan Johnson, a boy of twelve, and impale him with a meat hook? *Why* did you wrap his intestines around his throat like a noose? *Why* did you fill his stomach with sea salt and brine? *Why* cut out his tongue? His eyes? *Why* carve that symbol into his forehead? *Why* is a demon like you alive and that little boy lies on the slab next to his parents? Why?”

My voice had been rising till it had turned into a deep roar, and it wasn’t until the last word that it had returned to a normal level. That was a lie.  In truth, my tone was no longer a battle cry for justice. Instead, it was a whimper of hopeless desolation.

I felt sweat dripping down my forehead and neck. Realizing I was standing, I took a deep breath and sat back into my chair. In the commotion, I failed to notice that the doctor held something in his long, slender fingers.

How?

Looking quickly at the closed file, I found it open and the crime scene polaroid of the body no longer hidden behind witness statements. I looked back at the monster across the table from me. How had he done that?

Impossible as it was given the only water within two hundred miles was the lake, I was in that moment overwhelmed by the smell of seawater.

He was humming a haunting tune as his dark eyes searched the photo like it held a hidden truth. Maybe it did. I wondered if the question of “why” would be answered if he found it.

“Why,” the doctor said slowly before looking up to meet my eyes.

There was a moment where I felt the leviathan presence ready to drag me down and then…it was gone.

In a brief flash, the doctor’s eyes widened in alarm, tears formed in his eyes, and his chest heaved with panicked breaths. “Why is this happening to me?!”

I slid back my chair from the table as the doctor lunged to his feet. Luckily, his chains that were linked to the iron loop drilled into the floor did their job, and he fell back into his chair hard enough to upset it. The doctor went sprawling on the ground in a whimpering mess as blood dripped onto the hardwood from where the cuffs had tore skin.

“Christ damn, shit damn bastard!” I said as I fumbled the Colt from its holster, leveling it with shaking hands.

“Help me, Tom,” he cried from where he lay. The doctor’s bloodied fingers crinkled the picture, and he began smashing his forehead into the floor. Whack, whack, whack.

“Jesus, Grady!” Henry said, shouldering me as he rushed from the door to the doctor. “Help me before he kills himself!”

I dropped the pistol onto the table and darted forward, grabbing the doctor’s other arm and yanking his torso back to keep him from concussing himself further. Henry growled and had to readjust his grip from the slippery blood dripping down the doctor’s arms. At the same time, I hooked one arm under the doctor’s arm and gripped the collar of the tattered suit jacket with my other hand. Even with both of us, the doctor was able to repeat his headlong assault against the floor two more times.

“Calm down!”

“Kill me!” the doctor cried, spitting teeth and slop from his bloody mouth. “Kill me before *he* takes me again!”

Darkness.

The lights in the rooms flicked off completely. The air conditioning unit circulating the stale salty atmosphere through the vents had gone quiet, and I heard the blaring of the tornado sirens echoing through our small town. A moment later, the emergency lights kicked on as the generator in the morgue below took over.

Bathed in the yellow glow, the doctor went limp in our hands, his bloodied fingers still clutching the crumpled photo. Henry and I barely had time to catch our breath before the stench hit - wet sand, rotting wood, the stink of something dredged from the deep.

There was a sound of static before the radio in the kitchen cut on with the broadcast warning: “-baffling as it is, a cyclone seems to be forming overhead. Scientists are at a loss but warn residents that the high winds and flooding-”

Then came a *snap*\*\*.\*\*

The doctor was motionless except for his hands, which were contorting into every shape imaginable. There was a sickening, wet crunch as one hand slithered free from the cuff, skin peeling, bones crushed to a bag of meat and broken bone. The other pulled against its shackle, tearing flesh down to the gleaming white beneath.

 Heavy wind hissed through spaces in the attic like a death whistle, and a loud growl of thunder or something worse shook the building.

The doctor moved.

Defying all logic, he was able to launch from our grasps, striking and destroying a leg of the table like a matchstick. It collapsed on top of him with the paperwork detailing his heinous acts scattering around the room.

His face concealed from our view by the wooden tabletop, the doctor seemed to collect himself. When he spoke again, the previous emotion had been replaced by an incredibly cold pressure.

“Why, you ask, Sheriff Grady,” he chuckled from beneath the table debris. “The answer to your ‘why’ is twofold. First, happenstance and fortune delivered anguished Ryan to my door while necessity and devotion carved him with the knife.”

I reached for my colt but found the holster empty. “Fuck.”

In the emergency light, the doctor’s body twisted unnaturally. His legs flopped uselessly, as if the bones inside no longer obeyed him. His torso corkscrewed and snapped, leaving his waist to be the divide between where his back stopped and his groin began.

I gulped in horror as his bone-pulped hand flopped against the side of the tabletop more liquid than solid, but still gripping, still pulling. Pieces of white poked through the skin, leaving tiny faucets of blood across its surface.

Despite the ruined hand, he still managed to drag himself forward.

“Holy hell!” Henry gasped, staggering backwards until his back slammed against the wall.

“The second reason why…their screams were a symphony to me.”

The voice was different now - richer, layered, with something old echoing beneath it. The doctor’s eyes glinted as he pulled himself further into the light, his lips peeling back in a grin.

“Steel yourself, Sheriff. You prodded the abyss.” His voice dropped to a whisper. “And here… here there be monsters.”

The doctor let out a sharp, barking cackle that made my body go cold and my jaw lock. I was up in an instant and Henry was right behind me, pushing down against me to get farther ahead in his flight.

On all fours, like a dog, I scrambled toward the door. A bullet pierced the wall directly above me, but my mad dash allowed me to escape into the hallway beyond. As soon as I got to the other side, Henry slammed the door shut and threw the locks closed.

Another shot was followed by the doctor’s maniac cackle; but the second was much more damaging to us than the first since it only embedded itself into the thick oaken door. As for me, I pushed myself to my feet and rushed toward the front door. Throwing it open, I was met with an insurmountable torrent of wind and rain.

The hurricane was on our doorstep with all of its fury. The rain hit like needles and the wind lifted me off my feet. The flood lights shown with all their might against the oppressive darkness, and I could just barely make out my Ford and Henry’s Corolla at the edge of it, but both vehicles went rolling as a powerful gust drove through.

With my heart in my boots, I put all my weight behind the door and closed it. The sound of the storm muffled somewhat but that just made it easier to hear the doctor singing a shanty in the room deeper in the battered house.

*“Oh, the black tide swells and the dead men call,*

*Through waters cursed where no stars fall.*

*A shadow stirs in the fathoms deep,*

*Where lost souls wail and the drowned ones creep.”*

The doctor let out a gravelly laugh that gnawed away at my soul. Taking a deep breath, I walked slowly down the dark hallway toward the light coming from the kitchen. Each step seemed to drive my stomach deeper into my chest but better to be in the light…or that’s what I told myself.

Henry was sitting at the table with his head between his hands. Hearing me approach, the younger man looked up at me with the same panic that was undoubtedly plain on my own face. I took the seat across from him even as we both still heard the doctor singing in the next room.

*“A thousand arms, all slick with grime,*

*They grasp and pull beyond all time,*

*No prayers nor steel can cut them free,*

*Once ye’re caught, ye cease to be!”*

That is when I saw the doctor’s finger snake through the bullet hole and begin chipping away at the drywall.

The monster was coming, and it sang:

*“Some are torn and ground to meat,*

*Some are swallowed, whole and sweet,*

*Some go mad and leap below,*

*Laughin’ as the black tides flow!”*",1,1741233496.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I always knew I was depressive, but I never knew how to take the course of action and actually get help for it up until I was introduced to my school's mental health worker. I talk to her but it doesn't really help me like I wanted to. 

I've been seeing this mental health worker for months now, but over the months, it's only seemed to get worse. Worse attendance. Worse grades(Failing classes). And overall just everything is spiraling downhill and out of control.

This all has really frustrated my mom. Though, I get where she's coming from, I feel like she takes it too far sometimes. I mean to the point where she's saying things like im the biggest burden god has ever put on her and that stupid, ""What did I do to deserve a daughter like you"" line. No matter how much I try to ignore it, it still hurts, and I feel like it hurts more than it should. At first my mom would only target me, but it slowly turned into my siblings as well. 

I have a younger brother and a younger sister. Both of them being still in school as well, but they do way better than me, and you'd think that'd make my mom/parents somewhat proud, bit that's not the case at all. Nothing is enough for them.

It's gotten to the point where even in dreams, my mom says the most hurtful things, and overtime, I've just started getting extremely fed up with it.

I was a very well behaved and responsible kid growing up and I used to beam with praise, but as my mental health declined, so did my obedience. All the chores are still put onto me(<--important). With all the stress of having to keep everything neat and tidy while also having to stress about grades and trying to get myself back in my feet somehow does not work together one bit. All the stress makes my mood swings even worse and the urge to violently outburst only gets stronger.

Finally. Today, I was just sitting on the couch. I has just finished eating and putting away some laundry. I barely even sat back before my mom told me to go put the clothes in the dryer. I was already agitated at the fact that I had to stop in the middle of eating just to put clothes away, but for some reason, her telling me to put the clothes in the dryer caused me to snap, and without thinking I had kicked the coffee table out of my way to stand up, but the bowl that was on it shattered completely. My mom started screaming at me and came at me to hit me, but I shoved her off and started screaming back. This made her shut up immediately, and she was stared at me as I kept screaming and screaming. I was basically just letting everything pour out at the point until I finally stopped and when I did, she started screaming at me again and she called my dad to tell him everything I said and I started getting yelled at by him over the phone as well. Then my mom said some shit about pulling me out of school as a whole. I was sobbing, and then a few bullshit words were exchanged before she stormed upstairs. My little sister knocked on her bedroom door and my mom's response what to leave her the hell alone because she's not our mother anymore because we don't care about her and that she apparently makes everything worse. I feel guilty and a shit ton of regret. I want to apologize, but I also just want to go away. She's currently crying in her room, and I don't know what the hell to do. I don't  think she's going to talk to me or my siblings for months or st least a little while, and it's all my fault. I feel like i made things worse for everyone, and I'm just exhausted.. I wish thus was a dream but it's very much reality. I feel so stupid, and I just want to make things right, I just don't know how to.",1,1741232831.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1j4mll3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1j4mll3/avoidant_discard/,Avoidant Discard,"TLDR: how do I heal from/understand an avoidant discard, and how am I supposed to believe they actually did love me?

 I genuinely don’t understand how to process this. I (28F) started seeing a guy (32M) back in late December. Everything went super well - no love-bombing or any red flags, but just a really strong but steady connection. He was sweet, kind, gentle, and we shared a lot of the same values and even background. He has kids (which I can’t have biologically) who he loves very much. 

After about 6 weeks of dating, we woke up here at my house and I could tell immediately something was off. He didn’t say good morning; when I went to make his coffee, he oddly said that I should put the coffee in one of his own mugs even though I’d already put it in a travel mug for him (cue me knowing something was off), but he still gave me a long hug and said I love you before he left (we’d only said that for about 2 weeks).

Then the drop in communication comes - though he promised it had nothing to do with me. Then I don’t hear from him and have to ask about Valentine’s plans three days beforehand after about a week of not hearing from him. He said he couldn’t and when I finally got him on the phone to tell me what was going on, he told me he couldn’t date anymore and that I was basically a burden to him because of my health issues (that I never asked him to help me with) and that if he stayed with me, he’d just be more depressed and wouldn’t be happy in the long run because of my needs.  

I let it be for a few days and then sent him a text, not expecting him to respond, saying kindly but firmly that the reasoning didn’t make sense and wasn’t a real reflection of what happened but that I recognized his avoidant tendencies (that he’d said were secure now) were back and would respect that. Then he does respond, saying that I’m correct re: avoidance and that he was wrong and regrets how he phrased the breakup, he’d love to see me but just didn’t know how to be in a relationship while he was struggling with depression, etc. Says he’ll come see me the next day. And guess what? Nothing. So I lay out my feelings that I did love him and would be happy to work through things but it had to be his choice. 

Heard nothing. Asked for clarification. Repeat x2. Now I texted him to ask where to send his stuff back and see I’m blocked from his phone (I’d already blocked him from social media the day of the breakup) and I just don’t understand. How can you go from saying you love someone to this? He’s on TikTok making his videos, doing his thing, etc. 

I feel so stupid for believing he did love me and for allowing myself to put my guard down with him. I feel ashamed of who I am with my complex life and health. It hurts so badly that he could just seemingly use me for attention/validation and then wipe his hands when he doesn’t want it anymore. Am I misunderstanding something? I felt things with him that I never had in other relationships, and he said the same (and I believed him because it lined up with everything else he’d said), and it’s so painful to feel this way and still love him but know I’m blocked and he wants nothing to do with me.

1j4mkv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1j4mkv7/aio_starbucks_employees_pushing_for_tips/,AIO Starbucks employees pushing for tips,"So I just started drinking coffee again and have been through Starbucks drive-thru daily at multiple stores.

Day 1 at store #1 the guy took my card and asked me how much I want to tip before he would swipe it.

Day 2-6 at store #2 different employees presented me with the credit card machine and told me to first click one of the buttons (tip options) and then stare at my selection

Day 7 at store #2 new guy hits the button before presenting the machine to me. I find out days later when the transaction cleared he clicked the button to tip 20%!!

I worked in the service industry for 15 years and understand the importance of tipping a server or bartender properly.

This Starbucks situation is wild. I am thinking these people might make 100-200 bucks in tips a day on top of their wage. They are not providing a service beyond what their employer is paying them for. But they are pressuring customers to pay more.

1j4mhpq,https://i.redd.it/hgkel4qupzme1.png,So I've sat with DD Born Again after seeing both episodes twice. Spoilers abound.,"I don't think I like it very much....ouch. 

Let's start with what I liked.

The acting, duh. Charlie Cox and Deborah Ann Woll are gut wrenching in the opening 15 minutes. 

The look of the show, despite being not at all connected to the previous locals or set pieces from the Netflix show, is pretty decent. There's a slight color correction going on that's just enough to set a really gloomy mood, without veering off into Zack Snyder-esque desaturated gray puke. It does wonders for the tone. 

I like Cherry, or at least I'm ready to like him when they give him something to do. His dynamic with Matt seems strong and their history (that we completely skip over, more on that to come) seems to be a really interesting one. An ex cop turned pi who knows Matt's history and found out his secret during his darkest moment is a cool foundation for a relationship. It's too bad we haven't seen any of that yet, I guess I'll hope for a flashback or two? Maybe Cherry is the one who talked Matt out of being Daredevil. 

I'm ready to be invested in this defense of Hector/White Tiger. Matt seems to be anti vigilante now, or at least a couple lines of dialogue seem to indicate that. Regardless of how I feel that particular aspect has been developed, that conflicting with him defending a vigilante he knows is innocent of murder could be really interesting. I hope it ends up informing Matt's view of himself as DareDevil and isn't just a side quest. 

Okay so now the bullshit. 

That opening dialogue was *horrendous.* We have precious *minutes* to spend with these characters and what you decide to give us is hint hint wink wink nudge nudge type meta dialogue about nostalgia and hope for the future? That was so incredibly forced and cringe. Why can't we just spend time with these characters actually *being themselves* for a few minutes, since that's apparently all we're going to get?

I don't like the buildup to Foggy's death. It's incredibly rushed and not built up enough at all. Remember in season 3, how much they built up to the death of Karen, just to fake us out? A scene with her confronting Fisk, a backstory episode and several minutes of tension when Bullseye is sent to the church to find her all made it feel like she was in real danger. If they hadn't *heavily* marketed the shit out of Foggy's death everyone would be fucking rioting right now. The only reason they pulled that shit by hinting at it in the trailers and talking about ""shocking things happening early on"" is because they knew it felt like it was coming out of nowhere and felt the need to get out ahead of it.

I also don't know how I feel about Matt deciding to toss Bullseye off the roof. I will fully admit my bias as a DareDevil comics fan has conditioned me to see Matt as a hero who struggles constantly with the desire to kill his enemies, so initially I was okay with it. But the show has worked pretty hard to test Matt's values and by the end of season 3 he comes out on top and pretty triumphant as a hero. I don't like them undoing that immediately. If you want Matt to break his rule, you're going to have to work equally as hard to build up to it and really break him down as a character. That feels like an incredibly tall task, considering how low Matt had fallen in season 3 and how high he rises by the final episode. 

I don't like the time skip. They pulled a fucking Endgame again. They did something shocking and then completely skipped all of the consequence and fallout just to shove a new status quo in our face and expect us to not ask questions. Why would Karen not talk to Matt? Matt lied to her, multiple times, ignored her after revealing he was still alive and treated her like a complete dick in season 3. Their arc in that season was all about testing the bounds of their friendship and Karen deciding that she wasn't going to let anything come between them. So you tell us she just ghosted Matt without showing us any of the drama that led to it? 

Why is Fisk out of prison? What happened to spending his miserable life in a cage? What happened to going after Vanessa for the murder of Nadeem? Why is Matt just casually inviting Fisk to a cup of coffee? We really needed some justification as to why Fisk is just allowed to be a free man, let alone elected as mayor. 

Where are the side characters? I get Mahoney and Ellison, they aren't necessarily essential, although at least mention them to keep some sense of continuity maybe? But what the fuck about Marci and Sister Maggie? Sister Maggie is Matt's fucking MOTHER and he hasnt gotten to have a relationship with her at all. And Marci? She was the assumed soon to be fiance of Foggy and their relationship was one of the highlights of season 3. I understand if you can't get the actors back but no dialogue referencing them or addressing their absence? The side characters in DareDevil made up a wonderful supporting cast and completely ignoring them is exceptionally lame. I hope I'm wrong and they bring them in or at least talk about them in the coming episodes but I'm not holding out hope. This issue is compounded by the fact that the new side characters are pretty awful, again with the exception of Cherry and maybe Hector. McDuffy is annoyingly smug and we've been given no real reason to want to like or empathize with her. Heather Glenn is also unimpressive so far, although I suppose she could improve. It's just disappointing when you remember the Netflix show and how strong pretty much every character introduction is. These new side characters kinda blow. 

The fight scenes suck so far. The opening in Josie's bar is *okay* but the cgi was very noticeable and the smoke was there only to obscure the action and make it borderline impossible to follow at times. The stairwell scene still alludes me, I've seen it several times and I still can't piece together what the fuck is happening. Also, why does Daredevil transport outside of the building? Just so he can have the really dumb cgi entrance a few seconds later? The fight inside the apartment is worse. I'm sure the choreography would be fine if I could fucking follow it through the 20 something cuts. Get this taken ass level of editing out of my DareDevil goddamnit. At one point when he slams the guy down on the table there's THREE cuts, all showing wildly different angles and all within a second. I don't care about a bone break, if I can't see what the fuck is happening then sorry I'm unimpressed. I've eaten really well for three seasons and I'm not settling for that bullshit. I really hope the fight scenes show some major improvement in later episodes. 

Overall I just feel like I was tricked. There's almost no sense of continuity that makes this feel like a continuation. I really wonder how much of this is still a result from the previous material that was already there before the writers strike. It doesn't matter if you bring Foggy and Karen back if they're gone almost immediately. And to just ignore all of the previous side characters and feature none of the previous sets or locals hurts the feeling of continuity immensely. There's some inspired stylistic choices and cinematography, and there's some story threads that could go somewhere so I'm willing to give it a chance. But they really need to explain what happened during the time jump and explain what the fuck happened with Foggy. And to be honest, I have every reason to believe they probably will because the way that sequence plays out makes it seem like they have more to show us about his client and how Bullseye got involved. Especially since Redhook is mentioned as something to do with Foggy's client and then is brought up again in Vanessa's meeting. I think there's something more going on there. Not off to a great start, could be worse but I'm not giving it a pass just because it's better than most of modern Disney Marvel. The bar is high, there's no excuses. The show runners have a responsibility to deliver on par with the Netflix show and so far this ain't it. 

Sorry for the long winded rant, I know there's already a couple threads discussing it, but I needed it out of my system. 

Small question for anybody who's seen it, is Matt's new law firm set up in his old apartment or am I crazy? They say several times he's not in hells kitchen anymore but that set looks so much like his old apartment. ",2,1741232384.0,MauLer,4,1.0,False

I’ve been shortlisting folks for our team—React JS devs, Python + DSP experts, DevOps gurus—you name it. And before you ask, no, I haven't suddenly become an HR fellow. I’m just a lead architect doing the initial filtering on resumes.

So dear cocos, the salary range is enough to make anyone spill their chaya! A 3-4 year experience candidate is getting ₹13-24 LPA, and for those with 7-9 years? ₹25-45 LPA! And these are not folks from the fancy top-tier ""nammude oru MNC"" companies—just solid, hardworking people from decent firms. Some in Bangalore (obviously), some in Maharashtra, some in Kolkata.

Now, why am I giving these numbers? Because every other day, someone comes and says, ""Eda, I’m planning to migrate to Europe. Life is so much better there!"" And of course, no doubt—better air, better work-life balance, no random 11 PM production issues. But if your grand plan is to earn in euros, return to India, and become a “rich” man, pinne oru karyam parayam… Being rich in India today is like asking ""Porotta with beef or with chicken curry?""—totally subjective and depends on whom you ask!

So before you book your ticket, get your Schengen visa, and dream of sipping coffee in a Paris café, do the math. Because sometimes, paisa ivdeyum kittum, and you don’t need to struggle with European winters or 6 PM dinners.

1j4mh3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1j4mh3z/therapy_felt_like_a_waste/,Therapy felt like a waste.,"25f.

No one tells you what a waste of time therapy feels like when you're healing and have nothing to show for it.

No one tells you about how lonely your 20s are. When everyone has kids but you. I'm chronically ill, and everyone I know is at this point. I'm the only one who has the energy to talk, no one else ever does. I have no expectations for anyone, nor do I think I'm entitled to anyone's else's time. I try not to ever complain about anything, I try to fill my days with my own Hobbies. I'm always the one to listen, but no one listens to me. Everyone's sick and tired, or busy or chasing their children around, or mostly only have the space for themselves and their own friend groups, or their partners.

I've never had friends. I grew up with none, having been bullied and also abused/neglected by my own family. I had a few internet friends as a child, some took advantage of me and how naive I was, and I wasn't always kind, if not mostly because I wasn't yet able to break the cycle.

I spent 5 years in therapy... and now have no one. My family couldn't care less if I disappeared and even encouraged it, it's always been this way. Medication doesn't work. I have no friends, and the few people I talk to 1x a month or so always have their own thing going on, or they're always sick, or too exhausted, or are spending time with anyone else but me.

I feel ashamed to say I have empathy fatigue. It feels selfish and mean, but I've gone from ""I understand!"" ""I know you can't help it!"" ""I'll always wait for you!"" to ""Okay, whatever."" ""Hit me up when you're feeling better."" ""Bye."" and even turning straight up cynical. I hate this side of myself, but somehow therapy made me fairly antisocial. No one ever checks on me. No one gives me grace. No one notices I'm even here, so a part of me says ""then why should I care?"" ""Go get therapy yourself."" ""Go ask your boyfriend/mother/father/google,"" and the guilt from thinking it consumes me.

I try to be kind. Chronic illnesses are now common and they aren't anyone's fault. I pretty much never expect a text back, but it does get exhausting. I have no community of my own, but end up as everyone else's community. I am the village. I have to help, listen, learn... but no one ever will for me. No one CAN.

I've started to resent my pets. I care for them because I couldn't imagine being cruel enough to surrender them or abusive to let them go hungry or anything ever, but a little piece of me HATES them. They aren't human. My dog especially has been nothing but a ""job"" to me. He is reactive, sickly (chronic illnesses too, controlled) and an anxious wreck, and what was once a confidence-building experience has turned into an eye-rolling, expensive chore. I know it's the depression talking, but it's getting harder to hold it together every day.

Recently I logged out of all of my social media. No one checked on me for a month except to ask me if I knew something that they probably could've googled anyway.

I'm also so tired of hearing ""be your own best friend.""
You can only be alone for so many years before human nature takes over and your need for community, care, socialization etc. Takes over. You can only do so many things by yourself, take yourself out on so many outings before you give up. Maybe I don't want to be my only friend anymore. Maybe the coffee outings, spa days, nails, restaurants and movies alone are stale. Maybe video games don't please me anymore.

I've given up on ever being even minimally liked or wanted. I get that this is the norm for adulthood. I've accepted it, but that doesn't mean I don't cry every night. I spend hours out of the day forcing myself to do Hobbies and join local groups and volunteer crap and just cry, cry, cry. I try to make it about everyone else, but as selfish as it is, when is it ever going to be about me?

When is it my turn? Why is it NEVER my turn?
I tried to be better.
I know I'm a terrible person, but I did try.
I just wanted it to be my turn, once

We started casually dating and over the time got serious. I met him when I joined the institution where he was studying at and at that time he was single.

The problem:

Incident 1: He had a classmate, 24F ""Susan"" ,whom he had a crush on for a year before he met me. She had left the institution to do a one-year project abroad and he took a gap year and their communication ceased. During this time, we started hanging out and had our first kiss in June 2024. The day after our first kiss, BF and I were having dinner ,when out of the blue he spotted her. Susan had came back to collect her degree. He just abruptly left the table mid-conversation, went to her and came back all smiling. He told me that he had asked Susan out for coffee and was planning to confess to her about his ""past feelings"", which he had no more. I felt bad because we were just having ""the talk"" about making things serious 5 minutes ago and now he had asked Susan out on a coffee. I didn't say anything at that time but it stung. They went out for a coffee date the next day and after he came back he told me that he couldn't confess to Susan. I guessed he just chickened out. After this she went back to her home and they didn't talk and we eventually got exclusive.

Incident 2: I had completely forgotten about Susan and our relationship was going better than ever. Then he went home on a break for 20 days in December 2024 and the day he came back he was showing me something on Instagram when I saw that his top search was Susan. I felt weird and confronted him. He pretended to forget why he had searched her and then gave me a half assed explanation about viewing her story. He then told me that he'll unfollow her ""if I wanted"" and I said yes. He wasn't too pleased about it.

Incident 3: In February 2025, Susan came to the campus for a day to attend a sports event. I was with him when we crossed paths with her all of a sudden. He introduced me to her as his girlfriend but was very awkward in front of us. Later he told me that he wanted to make her jealous by showing me off and this statement rubbed me the wrong way. I told him to inform me if Susan contacts him during her stay in the campus and he got angry and called me ""controlling"".

Incident 4: When I had asked him about his relationship with Susan, he told me that he had a crush on her in 2020 during the pandemic, when they had classes online and they used to text each other. When they finally met in 2022, his crush had faded away and he didn't care about her anymore. I had naively believed in him ,until I discovered their chats yesterday. He gave me his phone to play a game as mine was down and jokingly said that I can check his chats. Then he went to take shower. My curiosity got the better of me and I read his chats with Susan. 
He used to relentlessly text her till December 2023 and flirt with her. He always told me that I'm the first woman that he has asked out for walks/movie nights and I saw that it was a blatant lie. He used to ask her out for movie nights at his room, call her to have dinner together and ask her out for walks. She had ignored all his advances. 

The part that hurt the most was that he used to save food for Susan and wait for her in the dining hall even when she refused to come.  He never did these for me during our initial days. I was the one who always made plans, called him, waited for him and he used to ignore my plans. He said cheesy things to her about her smile being the most beautiful and all that although he proudly told me that I'm the first woman that he has said all these to.

Now I am hurt, not because of his past, but because of his lies and his attitude around her. Our relationship is really good now and he does everything for me but I just feel like a second option. He also doesn't talk to Susan anymore. I don't want to destroy my relationship over this seemingly insignificant thing but I can't seem to get it out of my head. And he also gets defensive and dismissive when I bring up Susan. I asked him today about Susan again and gave him a chance to set the record straight but he again lied to me about the timeline. I didn't tell him that I had read their chats.

1j4mdy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/1j4mdy2/exercise_bulimiai_think/,Exercise Bulimia(I think),"So a few months ago I was put on some meds for an unrelated mental health disorder that made me gain a good amount of weight and gave me an appetite I couldn’t control because the medication zombified me. It took away all my motivation for the gym, work, social life; everything really. I hated it and eventually against medical advice, I stopped taking it. 

Fast forward to now, I was prescribed a different medication that causes weight loss, doesn’t zombify me, in combination with a weight neutral medication which uplifts my moods and gives me a ton of energy. This incredibly increased my quality of life, and I started to feel normal and happy after a while. That was, until the weight started dropping. 

At first it was scary, because I’m doing MMA and I want to be muscular and fit enough to compete properly. But the compliments I get on my physique the leaner I get kept fueling me to just ignore it honestly. I couldn’t care less whether or not I wasn’t hungry and didn’t give a shit about the fact that I’d get nauseous every time I did try to eat(I’d get hungry to the point I was starving but the moment I but into food I felt like I wanted to throw up). I gave up after a while. I started embracing the weight loss, intaking only just enough protein to keep my body from going into muscular dystrophy and counting each and every calorie. I eat fruits, drink protein shakes then chug water to piss out the sodium. Chug black coffees to piss out the water. And cut all the weight off me as quick as I can in cycles. I’ll eat lean protein and then go walk it off on the treadmill right after, lift, and uber home. Things like that. I live at the gym after meals. Before meals. My meals either need to be earned, or worked off. There’s no allowing them to exist without the gym anymore. 

I workout twice a day, literally. I’m in the fucking gym TWICE A DAY. I do cardio TWICE TO THREE TIMES A DAY. Burn easily 4 figures of calories every day. And don’t even eat that many. But I lift, and only intake protein and fruit. And whenever I do overeat, I feel so guilty I rush to the gym, step onto a treadmill, and cry and won’t step off of it until the number passes the meal I took in. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t know how I fell down this rabbit hole so bad. 

Today, I ate into the 4 digits of calories. Almost up to >!2k!< for the first time in a month. And I can’t get to the gym now because it’s closed. I know I already burned 850 calories today, and lifted weights, so I’ll probably be fine and only absorb protein and very minimal carbs or fat, but I still feel so guilty and like such a disgusting pig. I’ve lost 35 pounds in 2 months.  Idk how much more I can lose without doing constant water weight cuts using diuretics and pushing my body half to death and almost passing out at work/school. Even then there’s only so much I can do. I want to die. I just want to go to the gym, I just want to work this meal off. I hate that I ate. ",2,1741232039.0,EDAnonymous,1,1.0,False

She's very polite during the first few times I interacted with her, I mostly asked her questions about her hobbies, music, and work. we only go deep into one topic if I keep asking about it. I mostly keep the conversation going as I seem to be the one interested and she might not be, I kinda understand because although we have seen each other, she and I have never interacted with one another personally (met her at my mom's gathering with her friends)

There are times wherein I felt like I might have been texting her too much, especially since she is always busy with work. I have since learned to give her space and mostly text her only to ask about specific things happening in her country and how she is, I don't ask much questions regarding hobbies etc. anymore because she might be busy with work and I thought of keeping most of my questions until we meet agaiin personally.

1j4md8j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j4md8j,My Questions About Sho's Foodtruck,"I don't remember in the story and I'm too lazy to replay it but how much is the food from the food truck? I don't recall Subaru ever paying but Ritsu himself said that it's a business, Ritsu also stated that Darkwick clearly trusts Sho since despite being a first year and being from a house full of dissidents as well as delinquents he was allowed to run a business. Sinostra is also a house filled with criminal records but the Casino's profits go both to the Captain and Vice Captain and some go to Darkwick since the profits are the reason it was allowed, but the 
Casino's profits or ownership isn't limited to one ghoul it is still ownership of Sinostra. Mystery Diner isn't owned by Jabberwock it is already a building that existed and Ren only works part time, so why is Sho the only person who is allowed to own a personal business? Does it have to do with the special mission Hyde gave him? Why does Darkwick trust him so much? Clearly Hyde pulled some strings considering he's Sho's brother, I do remember something though when Sho asked for Subaru's Wickchat number he said that he'll let him know when the food truck will be opened and since he's the first customer the meal will be on the house. So it is a business I guess they just don't show when someone pays or I may be misremembering, it must be cheap though considering the long line of students. Also aren't ghouls supposed to be cannibals? I guess in TDB it's different because in Tokyo Ghoul (why is it always Tokyo) ghouls cannot survive without eating human flesh and they can eat but cannot digest human food, but they can consume water and coffee (I'm looking at you Ritsu). 
From my research of the actual term of ghouls:
;In folklore, a ghoul is a demon-like being or monstrous humanoid, often associated with graveyards and the consumption of human flesh. In the legends or tales in which they appear, a ghoul is far more ill-mannered and foul than goblins. The concept of the ghoul originated in pre-Islamic Arabian religion. 
;In some accounts, the person rises as a ghoul after death. In others, he or she becomes a ghoul after dining on human flesh -- a cultural taboo often linked to monstrous transformations. In either case, the transformation is permanent and linked directly to the state of the soul or psyche.
;The ghoul is said to lure unwary people into the desert wastes or abandoned places to slay and devour them. The creature also preys on young children, drinks blood, steals coins, eats the dead, and takes the form of the person most recently eaten.

Most of these are from Wikipedia but most of their transformation does have to do with consuming human flesh, honestly the description fits Edward Hart more and the luring into desert Sinostra.

I have been on a few dating apps (which is how I met my ex-wife). This time around, it feels different. I’m dealing with woman who were married for 25 yrs….or have been single for at least 12yrs and very independent. I was married for the past 15 and all of my friends were her friend’s husbands which ended upon divorce. It made sense at the time. Now, I’m frustrated starting over. I work, go to the gym, hikes, dinners, but all on my own. Some people say I need to spend time alone and learn about myself. Change my hobbies. I hate it. I’m lonely all the time. The dating apps were fun, but got very expensive…. Yes, I should have met them for coffee and then decided if I wanted to move forward, but at 51 I should have my stuff together so I decided to do dinner instead. I had a great time with the 5 dates I’ve been on so far, so no complaints. But, I really don’t want to rely on apps to find my next and last partner. How do I find someone? Travel solo? Hang out at bars? Join a singles church group? I don’t know. I’m lost. Any ideas? ",0,1741231970.0,dating_advice,6,0.5,False

I've been working in bakeries for my entire adult life. I have always been pulled to return to college and finish becoming a pathologist assistant, but I'm about to turn 35 and going back to school in your 30's is easier said than done so I've left it on the back burner. Five months ago I sprained my left wrist at work, I was on workers comp for four months. In those four months I decided I was going to leave the industry, I was going to finish college and finally build a life that could sustain me into the future. But then I chickened out and went back to my job. When I was finally able to return to work I sprained my right wrist two weeks in. It was unbelievable. Now both my wrists hurt and I am being screened for rheumatoid arthritis and can no longer do any work that requires me to do heavy lifting or bending of my right wrist. So no more kitchen work for the foreseeable future.

I was hoping I could move into a FOH position at my job, since I was a manager in my department and had been there for three years before I got hurt, but after a meeting with the owners it's clear they are almost certainly going to tell me on Friday that they have ""no work available for me."" They won't fire me, they'll likely suggest an unpaid leave, which is just a soft firing to try to get out of having to pay for unemployment. I'm now applying to minimum wage positions because I can't do the jobs I'm qualified for due to my injuries. I was making 21 dollars an hour at this job so this will be a huge income dip. I'm also losing my health insurance. 

While on workers comp I've been thinking for MONTHS about just moving out of the city and moving back in with my mom and my two brothers so I can focus on going back to school full time and graduating without having to pay 1k in rent every month on top of the rising costs of literally everything else. They live in the suburbs in the home I grew up in and they're right down the street from a train station so it would be extremely easy for me to still access the city from there. I would even be attending college in the city (after a year of community college) so I would still be there five days a week once I transfer from community college to a university.

I've lived in the city since my early 20's. The last three years I've lived alone in a studio, and I've loved living alone, I have CPTSD (and OCD, clearly) and living alone has been the first time I've felt like my nervous system is actually regulated, but honestly I just feel like living in the city is unhealthy for me at this point. It's very crowded, there are people everywhere, minimal access to greenspace (real greenspace, not a patch of grass with benches), and when I'm not working I almost never leave my apartment. I am actually averse to leaving my apartment for anything but work. I've had so many scary and dangerous experiences with unstable people lately (I was even physically assaulted in my own apartment building in December) that I'm always on high alert everywhere I go now. Every time I take the train in the morning to go to work I witness aggressive or violent behavior because unhoused people live and do drugs on the trains. I don't like leaving my apartment, I don't like going outside, there are just too many people and I'm so overwhelmed and overstimulated. I do live in a great major city with lots to do, but I don't want to go to bars or shows or really do **anything** here. I miss being in the woods, I miss being in nature, it really hurts my soul at this point.

The thing holding me back from moving back home is I had a very traumatic life and there is a lot of trauma held in those places and in the house that I would be returning to. I'm terrified of my own feelings. I'm terrified I'll go back there and crumple and be so unhappy that I'll feel like I'm dying. I'm afraid the worst case scenario will happen and I'll regress and basically go insane. I haven't lived at home since my early 20's (plus a stint where I was staying there on weekdays when I was 27) and I'm older now, I know it would be different, it's the same place but a different time and a different path, but I'm so afraid of how I might feel. My fear of my own feelings has held me back for so long.

This morning I finally bit the bullet and sent an email to my landlord asking to cancel my new lease (I'm set to move April 5th, they set me up with a building transfer after I was assaulted). At first I was so excited, so proud of myself, I was finally doing the scary thing! I was finally moving forward and really changing my life for the better! But then a couple hours and a cup of coffee later I had a massive panic attack and thought ""OH GOD, THIS MUST BE A SIGN, THIS IS MY BODY TELLING ME GOING BACK TO THOSE PLACES IS NOT SAFE"" and I emailed my landlord and pretended I sent that email on accident, that it was an old draft that I sent by mistake.

But now that it's many many hours and a long crash out nap later, I regret THAT decision. I don't *want* to get some shitty minimum wage customer service job just so I can pay a landlord 1,000 dollars a month for a 400 square foot studio, I don't *want* to go to community college here where I'm always afraid someone is going to fuck with me or hurt me. But I don't *want* to trap myself somewhere I might have trauma responses either. It's the what if's, what if I hate living with my mom? What if I feel uncomfortable 24/7 there? What if I regret it and freak the fuck out once I'm there? What if I can't tolerate it? What if what if what if, it's just this never ending fear of discomfort. I'm just so exhausted and lost. I want this change so badly but I can't trust myself. I've been stuck in place because of my fear for so long and I just keep getting older. If you read all of this, I honestly might owe you money because this was so much. I hope anyone can help me. I'm just so lost. I wish I wasn't so afraid.",2,1741231833.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

To give an example recently she had gone out to eat with her girl friends and spent about 4 hours out with them. I have no issue with her being out at all, she told me it was out to coffee, but it then turned into going back and forth between her cousins house. I have access to her life360 so I technically see where she is all the time. The issue is that I don't want to be tracking her. I would much rather her shoot me a text telling me her plans change or something along those lines. I myself follow this same procedure and I have come to her multiple times asking if she could do that for me. Unfortunately for me she forgets to everytime. We both get nervous when the other doesn't communicate and I make sure she doesn't feel that stress when I'm out by shooting her a small text. She on the other hand doesn't do that and constantly gives me what I call ""excuses"" but to her are reasons she doesn't need to respond. They would be like ""I was busy talking with someone"" or ""I was charging my phone"". It's gotten to a point now that instead of me calmly asking her uf she could do these things for me, I have been getting increasingly upset and angry with her. Honestly I've said some mean things at this point but I just don't know how to communicate anymore if everytime she has a reason on why she won't do what I am asking of her. I have repeatedly pointed out that I try to accommodate her needs, but she just doesn't seem to want to do the same for me.

This is just one example, anytime we have a disagreement and I tell her something I need she always has an excuse that she seems to think is valid. Am I overreacting? Should I just let her do her thing and suck it up?",2,1741231596.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False

Am i being slowly controlled day by day ?,"Hi All, I'm confused about my husband’s behavior, more so in the recent days and need some third party unbiased opinion on this.

A little background:

So I (36F) and husband (36M), met on matrimonial application an year ago. This is a 2nd marriage for both of us after tumultuous firsts. I was working and living in Europe , while my husband stays in the states for 10+ years now. Both of us belong to central India, and come from same Indian cultural region, but my family is financially better off than his. I mention this because growing up maybe his view on patriarchy and feminism may vary given their social status.

We decided that I would be the one to leave my job and move to the states for the following reasons… my husband was in line for a US greencard ( which we both have now received) and his job opportunity in Europe were limited. Also , he was well settled here in the states , had a house car etc all set, while i lived in a rented apartment in non-english speaking country although i had a good job.

First his pro points : He is a sincere guy , he was genuinely interested in me , came to Europe twice with a special visa just to meet me. He is financially stable, keeps his house clean and organised, doesn’t smoke and drinks occasionally. Even though i am not working in the states yet, he takes care of the majority house work and takes care of me financially. Also , there have been no violent outbursts that i have seen in him so far even when we have big fights. I think he genuinely loves me , and is protective of me , and that protective streak is where we have most fights on. He is very pedantic and since and has a PHD in physics.I mention this because he does extensive research for each and everything.

Now the things that have raised doubts in my head : When we both were getting married, he got cold feet … I attributed it to his past bad experience with marriage. He also made clear several times , that I am making this move from Europe to US for myself , and giving up my job is completely my decision and he is not to be held responsible for it. This was a big fight between us and even ended up postponing our marriage date by a week. He apologized and I took him back and married him.

We were clear that we both want a child , and given our age we started trying as soon as possible. We were lucky and I am now 4 months pregnant. So far I have had a normal pregnancy.

I could not work due to not having my work authorization , and my husband filled all the paper work diligently on time. I received my work authorization around 2 months ago, but husband said dont rush into a job in 1st trimester and take some rest. I have been working since past 12 years and it seemed like i could rely on him and take this as a lighter time during my pregnancy.

But now I started learning driving in the states ( i can already drive in India ) and he is not comfortable for me to learn driving now, since well I'm pregnant.

He is not comfortable with me swimming, since the water Chlorine levels are pretty high and my affect the baby.I have checked with the doc, and they all say swimming is excellent during pregnancy.

He doesn't want me to have tea or coffee , since they have chemicals which may harm the baby.

He was on fence about me working out, so that it doesn’t put too much strain in the 1st trimester.

Like i said i am pretty independent, and i took multiple flights last year within Europe and to US. But since I have moved here, we have only taken short road trips around the area, since now we are down to one earning, and also it may be stressful for the baby.

What has really irked me , is he asked to have the delivery back in India ( even though I was diligently following the no-flight rule ). He said so , so that we might have enough help and support of relatives and it would be easier ...according to him. I am not sure if it was coming from a space of control , or wanting his parents more involved after the baby comes or genuine concern for me !?? I hated this idea and rejected it outright.

FYI , I am very paranoid about patriarchy and in laws, since that was the reason for the breakup of my last marriage.

I am not able to understand , if he is overly cautious about the pregnancy or he is just using it to control my life hence forward? I feel like I'm slowly loosing my power.

But I decided to experiment last night. 

So far, I believe I successfully lucid dreaming frequently using a grounding blanket. I then decided to pair my binural brainwaves app with my bone conductive headphones  to sleep with 6.3 hz playing. 243L 249.6R

I first started to run my noticing exercises. Seeing shapes and blobs and the next thing I knew I Was dreaming. I was aware of the transition but at some point late into the dream I was gaining awareness. I could tell I was in a dream. An active actor in the play I was witnessing. I aware of me surroundings. Aware of who and what I doing and willing made actions and thoughts the same way in waking life. 

The last scene I remember in detail was I was moving into a two story house. It felt dated, old, like an old well lived In 1960s house. No new renovations just scars of a cheap flip. Painted over textures. Old flooring design. Me and some people I felt that I knew were moving In and settling in. For some reason I was excited of the bathrooms. One was pink and a super weird layout but I was really excited that there was a powder room downstairs and 3 full baths upstairs. 

I continued to explore the house and found a closet door that had steps going down into what I thought was a basment.  
I told the people I would be down there exploring and head down. As I got closer down I started to see bounds of black trash bags andnd a little bit of debris. Trashy for sure and all of a sudden I fall into this trash pile. I look up from where I had fallen. And could see a pull down ladder that can come down. 

While looking around I could tell this was a concrete underground  warehouse. Concrete walls all around  scaling hundreds of feet 
Concrete flooring. Dome forecast flight Illuminatibg the area. Some on, most broke or off. In the distance I could see darkness scaling up the walls but what ever was lit was still dimly lighting the areas. 

The rest of the warehouse was filled with false houses, shacks, shed, mounds of dirt. It like I found a fake town. I do recall see a wood fenced area like maze. Possible something like a paintball arena or something.  I walked towards a wall lined with shacks half sticking our of the wall. In it I could screen illumating the inside but it was give the impression that the background could change. It would play this stary night horizon background desert scene. 

Another short walk around I find an couch all dirty , patchy, and holey ripped next to a coffee table and tube TV. On the table was a black berry. I picked it up and started to see horror related themes, games and such. Had modern horror games installed on it. Kept seeing monsters with dark hollow white dot eyes on the phone bit that point I started to get scared. 

I also noticed schematic for some kind game asset called the get bent pistol. Picked it up. Looked like something I would see in team fortress 2 like literally a just bent barrel mauser pistol game asset. 

In another moment I force myself to wake  thinking I may be late getting to work. 


May need to have more discussions with people. I k ow I can remember Dreams in high detail. Some from even a loooooong time ago.

May be a dumb question, but how important is a grinder to people like us? I understand people notice the difference as their taste matures, is this something we can wait on or is it worth the investment up front? Most of the coffee stores in our area can grind coffee for you, or at worst we can get pre ground.

1j4m0lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1j4m0lk/health_concerns_from_a_student/,Health concerns from a student,"Background: sophomore studying finance and currently doing 2 internships, involved in clubs, trying to maintain a good GPA, networking in my free time, and lately been getting a ton of interviews. 

During this school year, I’ve been grinding for work experience to try to get myself the best job possible out of college. It’s been hard juggling a lot at the same time but I’ve been able to do it, unfortunately my body can’t handle it…
This past week in class, my heart started pounding fast and hurting a bit, I started to randomly feel very anxious, sweating a little and feeling like I couldn’t breathe. I spoke with a professional and they said I need to stop working so much and relax/unload my heavy workload. 

I want to be the best student and actively trying to be involved as much as possible, but how much is too much? I wake up sometimes with my heart pounding thinking I missed a networking call or an interview.

question 1: are clubs that important? I have 4 internships and going for a fifth this summer as a sophomore.
 I’m a member of 2 career related clubs which are fun because they’re low commitment but in the process of joining more involved clubs that look really interesting but extra work which but feel like for my health I shouldn’t at least for this semester. 

Question 2: how do I maintain my health for a financial career path? I try to exercise when I can and giving up coffee temporarily (I usually only drink one medium roast in the morning). 

I don’t get stressed over the work itself but more about the different types. What does stress me out the most is when I just want to study and pay attention to my classes but then I realize I have to get on a work call in 15 minutes or have an assignment due the next day. 

Is dropping a competitive club and not extending my internship at a search fund a fine move to make? 

I want to focus on my classes and get myself back together health wise but afraid that I might put myself behind career wise. ",2,1741230842.0,FinancialCareers,5,1.0,False

Just wanted to reach out because I had a situation that I don't know whether I should just forget about or wait on. I bumped into someone I've known for 10 years a few months ago at a singles event...she's actually the HR recruiter that helped me get my first job out of school. She'd been in a relationship/married for as long as I knew her until she got divorced last year. Through that time I never viewed her as someone I'd date but always respected her, we'd occasionally get coffee to keep in touch, discuss other jobs, and even went to an event she spoke at because I really liked the topic and her insight. We ended up briefly catching up at the singles mixer and she gave me her Instagram to keep in touch.

She suggested grabbing a coffee to catch up but she lost her job and her mom had a stroke so she had to postpone and has been focused on that so I didn't feel it was appropriate to ask her out. I occasionally shoot messages to her to see how her and her mom are holding up. I asked to hop on a call to catch up and we just chatted about life and I asked how dating is going. She mentioned she's put dating on hold recently because she feels she isn't the best version of herself right now and she's found it really draining after a divorce to learn to date. She's also said she's focused on applying to and getting a job while dealing with her mom's situation so I didn't end up asking her out because it just didn't feel right.

Should I reach out to her again later to check in and see how things are to ask her out or just forget about it and assume she isn't interested in me? I guess I'd be kicking myself if there's a chance that she'd be interested and I just assumed she wasn't without asking. I can live with things being awkward and being rejected but I can't with question marks.",1,1741230815.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1j4lx8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1j4lx8l/wife_probably_had_yearslong_emotional_affair/,Wife probably Had Years-Long Emotional Affair.,"I’ll try to be as concise as possible, but there is a lot of nuance to it.

For context, we live in LatAm, and English is my second language.

Wife (F38) and I (M38) got married 10 years Ago (Dec14) but have been together since 2010. We took a couple of months off work so we could spend some time together after the wedding to have a longish honeymoon. About a month and a half in, she receives an email while she is taking a shower, titled “What a Sad Tragedy”. Fearing the worst, I opened the email. It came from what I could only assume was an Ex boyfriend. It said something along the lines of “I just found out you got married. I should have never pushed you away. I only hope you give me an opportunity to talk to you again.”

I brushed it off, mainly because before getting married I was also contacted by a couple of exgirlfriends. One to congratulate me, one expecting me to tell her I was marrying my second option. Crazy. I thought no more of the email my wife received, but the name of the sender stayed with me because it is not very common.

Fast forward 10 years. We have two kids; the oldest one is special needs. We have had a bad relationship for years. The stress of our special needs son weights heavy on us.

On January 16th 2025, her business is getting audited. She gets upset every time I ask about her finances and how she runs her business. But that day she leaves her laptop open while she is upstairs with our kids. I snoop in, trying to find out how exposed she is by this audit. Then, I see a contact on her computer she instant messaged that day. I click on it thinking it is her accountant. He sent a picture of a man on a suit. She responded with an emoji heart, and a message saying, “I am busy, I’ll call you later”.

First red flag🚩: It was obvious to me she had deleted all previous conversations with him.  
The only other reference I find of him, is she talking about him to one of our friends who sells retirement plans and insurances. She contacted our friend back in October, 4 months ago.

Second red flag🚩: She is introducing AP, to our friend, but she claims she does not know him, she says it is just a random client of hers. But I search her client list, and he is not there.

Then I remember the name.

So, I go upstairs and ask, “Who is Ambrose Wilfred?”(Fake Name)  
Third red flag🚩: She panics and answers “Who?” feigning ignorance. “Who is Ambrose Wilfred?”. After a few seconds that felt like a year, she answered “He is someone from my past. Someone who has been in my life, and today I just told him he looked handsome”. If she told him he looked handsome, it was over a call, not in a text.

I don’t remember much after that. It was like a bucket of cold water.

Fourth red flag🚩: Trickle truth begins. She tells me he just contacted her 2 weeks ago. I tell her not to lie, because she was already talking about insurance and portfolio investments to him. She changes her story saying “Ok, it was a couple months ago”.

Fifth red flag?🚩: I ask her “what is him of yours?”. And she could not answer me. “Is he a friend?” “No” Ex-boyfriend?” “No” “Lover, FWB, affair partner?” “No, no, no”.

Sixth red flag🚩: I ask her ""can I see your phone to see how you contact him?” She says “Sure, go ahead.” She thought I would only search her instant messages. But I went for the call logs. They were calling each other dozens and dozens of times. There was one day they called each other 35 minutes in three different calls. Not even when I was working abroad would she call me that often, for that long. I felt weak, I could not scroll all the way down. Remember, we have a special need son. Our days are so busy just trying to take care of his needs. How did she find the time to call him of that long?!

seventh red flag🚩: She tells me she spoke to him only to confide to him when we were having marital problems.

I ask: “Are you having sex with him?” “No, you have been my one and only. I have not seen him since before we became bf and gf. He lives in a different state.” This is the one thing I believe.

“Are you having an EA with him?” “No, I never told him that I love him or that I like him. We started talking because he was kidnapped last year” “And you believe him?” “Yes.” “Let me guess, after he told you he was kidnapped, he also told you that being in danger really ‘put into focus the people who are important to you’”. Silence.

We fight for the next couple of days. She kept saying she did nothing wrong, she kept saying that she didn’t realize what she was doing could be misconstrued as something malicious.

We have a showdown that weekend. I ask her if he is married. She says yes. “How long has he been married?” She thinks he told her he has been married for 14 years. “14 years?! So, he sent you that initial email being a married man?! What a tool!” When I first read the email, I thought it was just a bitter exboyfriend. But no. Age has shown me that players and serial cheaters actually reach out for married woman because there are less strings attached there. My past relationships contacted me before the wedding, but he contacted her after the wedding. A married man, reaching to a married woman about how bad he wants to talk to her. And he is 9-10 years older than her!.

I tell her that in order to move forward she had to:

1. cut the narrative that she didn’t know she was doing something wrong.
2. She had to contact AP’s wife and tell her everything. (She never accepted to do this)
3. She had to come clear as to when they started talking again.

Next day she tells me that the earliest call she could recover using ordinary android tools, was from April 2024. I believed her at the time.

Fast forward to valentine’s day. She has been a sweetheart since D-day. In trying to fix things, on Valentine’s days I give her flowers, and a couple of gifts so that the kids can give to their mother. She gets me a Starbucks coffee and a balloon. I tell her that what I really want is to share a bottle of wine and talk more about the incident. She still doesn’t think there was an affair. I ask about 50 questions that were haunting me for about a month. But three things stood out:

1. If he was “Kidnaped” around October, what were you guys talking about in April? She didn’t remember.
2. At some point she said “I don’t have a clear timeline of the time we spoke over the phone. Some years we only spoke over the phone once”. The wine in her didn’t even let her register what she just said. They had been in contact for years.
3. She still could not bring herself to call him a friend  or lover.

I did not let her know about her slip. But it kept bothering me that weekend.

Finally, that Sunday, I confronted her about her lies. IF she didn’t remember what they talked about in April, it was because they didn’t start to reconnect in April. They had been talking for years.

The next Monday, she finally admitted she had an EA, mainly because a guilty free spouse does not delete conversations. But she maintains she only lied about dates. She is still saying he is nothing to her, not even her friend.

I feel like I am drowning. She of course says I am drowning in a glass of water. IF it were not for our special needs son, I probably would have left already.

Edit: Today she finally admitted they were actually flirting, after denying it for month and a half. 

I am hurt and I don’t know how to move forward.

I am so dissapointed she fell for this old guy (he is 9 years older than her), ugly, married, obvious womanizer. ",13,1741230557.0,survivinginfidelity,10,1.0,False

24M here. So the other day while scrolling on grindr this random guy messaged me and we talked, we did send nudes but it was mostly flirty, he gave me his insta and we agreed to go for coffee. So that was 2 days ago, he is perfect, Law student and one of the best in his year, he is also a TA at uni. So the date was great we cuddled and kissed and just talked for 2 hours because he had class afterwards. I ended up walking with him to his uni a few blocks away and droped him off there.

So he did mention wanting to go out more and has replied to my messages, but its rather cold, I am associating this to him being too focused with uni work, because he always messages me when he gets home from uni and before bed so there is a short window where he is active.

Anyway am I overthinking things too much and giving excuses to myself or is he not into me? do you guys got any advice on this?",1,1741230483.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Whoa.  Today has been intense in the sadfishing/emotional manipulation department.  We all grieve differently because our grief is not linear.  Your journey and triggers are likely different than mine.  

In one day, we are to praise Kylea for using sweetened vanilla almond milk instead of ice cream base in her blended coffee, bringing her mom a bean burrito (best daughter ever?), delaying the purchase of a custom-ordered sectional (although we repeatedly heard new furniture was best for all 3 pets), show empathy about her deceased grandmother's figurine (representing Grams & Gibson together in heaven), validate Kylea & Joe for blowing bubbles in honor of their alleged pregnancy loss 2.5 yrs ago, and of all days... Joe's memorial tattoo appt is May 2025 in honor of his deceased parents.  

This. Is. Trauma. Dumping. 

Imagine if we all clogged our social media feeds with this type of content.  How would your friends, family, and even acquaintances react?  👀 

Connecting this back to the pets: Why didn't we see proof of Birdie's play date with Ray Ray & Olive?  Did she go for a walk at the mall or park?  Did anyone pet the cats today?  When are their birthdays again?

Hi! I just applied to this apartment and am debating if I want to move forward. my main issue is envisioning where to store things since it's a small space. Namely, I'm struggling to picture where I'll put my coffee maker and a microwave, both of which I need, as well as my air fryer. I'm open to adding shelves to the wall, buying furniture, etc., i just don't want it to feel cluttered and crazy when you walk in.

Additionally, there's no coat or shoe closet, so I'm trying to envision where I can store those things. Any ideas? I have no photos of what the past tenant did. Could I add some sort of closet unit in the livingroom? if so, where?

For furniture, I'm thinking my couch would go to the right when you walk in, projector above couch to project on the wall above fireplace and serve as a TV, and then a small tulip table with chairs by the windows, as well as my record player by the windows.

Open to any and all opinions — hard to imagine moving forward with signing the lease when I can't envision where things will go.

last issue is that I do not love the chandelier nor the ceiling fan, anyone savvy with this type of thing and know if I'd easily be able to remove and replace and then restore them when I move back out?",1,1741229353.0,DesignMyRoom,1,1.0,False

My girlfriend (32usa) and I (32usa) will be visiting vietnam in April. We are both pretty experience riders in the u.s, i am a mechanic and we both own multiple motorcycles. It has been a dream of ours forever to ride bikes up the coast in vietnam. 

Our plan is to fly into Saigon, stay in hostels for 2 days, then fly to danang and rent bikes for 2 weeks, eventually ending our trip in Hanoi 2 weeks later. Various stops along the way. Probably turn them in when we get to Hanoi, as Im not comfortable with the extreme urban traffic of hcm and hanoi. 

After doing some research, it appears usa IDP is not valid in vietnam. I have read control stops are rare, and to carry 200-500k coffee money for the locals. Is it advisable for us to do some pretty lengthy country riding, eg, danang to hoi an to hue to ninh binh and then up to ha giang, sa pa etc? How has the controllers been lately? Again, we are both experienced riders. We have travel insurance, but i dont think that will apply to motorcycles as idp is not valid from our country. 

Thank you for your consideration, we are very excited to explore vietnam and immerse in the culture.

I failed to realize that because I was in such a huge calorie deficit (eating around 700 calories below my maintenance per day or even more), that even though I felt like I was drinking a lot of water and eating a lot of veggies, it still didn't compare to my usual intake. At this point, I hadn't pooped for around a week.

I woke up around 9:15 AM, and I was in the restroom by 9:45 AM ish. When I tried to poop, it was excruciatingly difficult. I felt like I was about to throw up, and my leg wouldn't stop shaking. I tried every method I read online, such as the stool method, rocking back and forth, making mooing sounds, etc. By around 10:15 AM, I couldn't stand it anymore (my stool was literally lodged in my rectum and gave me the feeling of not even being able to relax), and I took two pills of senna with water. Then I resumed sitting on the toilet for a while, and at some point, I decided on manual extraction. I literally reached up into my butt and began pulling out pieces of my stool. Disgusting, I know, but I had to relieve the pressure in my rectum. Now I was finally able to relax a bit, and I left the toilet to go lie down on the floor. I also ate around half a cup of raspberries at this point for the fiber, but I don't know if it was actually effective or not.

Around 2:00 PM ish, I put in a suppository (I'm not sure which brand, but it definitely wasn't dulcolax). P.S. don't be scared of putting it in, I barely felt anything. I stayed lying on the floor, and I drank around 3 little cups of coffee and 2 cups of water. I left in the suppository for around an hour, and when I finally went to the restroom to poop, a big chunk of stool came out, but I still felt extremely constipated, and I knew there was still stool left inside. Once again, manual extraction. Then I went to lie down again, and here I drank some miralax mixed in water. Fast forward another hour, and my last piece of stool finally came out!

My biggest takeaway from this experience was: don't focus only on protein, and make sure you get enough fiber. Also, HYDRATION HYDRATION HYDRATION! I noticed that my stool came out a lot easier when I felt the need to pee. I don't know if it was my combination of the laxatives or the water + coffee that helped my stool finally come out, but hopefully this provided some insight to anybody suffering from the same problem!",1,1741228499.0,Constipation,0,0.67,False

Anxiety and dysautonomia are related in a number of ways:

Anxiety and dysautonomia can share symptoms such as a racing heart rate, rapid breathing, and pounding heartbeat. This can make it seem like anxiety is more common in people with dysautonomia, but research suggests that anxiety isn't actually more prevalent. 

People with dysautonomia often experience anxiety and other difficult emotions due to their symptoms and the challenges they face. 

Dysautonomia can cause high functioning anxiety because it's a condition that affects the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which regulates unconscious body systems like breathing and digestion.

Dysautonomia:                                                                        
People with ME/CFS experience a range of symptoms associated with dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, also known as Dysautonomia. The most common types of dysautonomia include Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), Orthostatic Hypotension (OH), and Neurocardiogenic Syncope (NCS), also known as Vasovagal Syncope (VVS).

[Autonomic Dysfunction](https://mecfssa.org.au/resources/autonomic-dysfunction#:~:text=Symptoms%20of%20Autonomic%20Dysfunction,sexual%20dysfunction)

Ask for a referral to a Neurologist or an Electrophysiologist. They'll evaluate you for dysautonomia.

[Dysautonomia International is a great resource for diet changes and strategies](https://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=44)

Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS):                           
MCAS is an immunological condition in which mast cells, a type of white blood cell, inappropriately and excessively release chemical mediators, such as histamine, resulting in a range of chronic symptoms, sometimes including anaphylaxis or near-anaphylaxis attacks. Primary symptoms include cardiovascular, dermatological, gastrointestinal, neurological, and respiratory problems.

[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome](https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-treatments/related-conditions/mcas)

>H1 and H2 histamine receptors are two main classes of histamine receptors that are involved in many different bodily functions:                                             

>●H1 histamine receptors.                                                   
These receptors are found in many tissues, including immune cells, smooth muscle, and endothelium. They play a role in regulating vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, and atrial muscle contractility. H1 receptors are also involved in cellular migration and nociception. Antihistamines that bind to H1 receptors are often used to treat allergies and allergic rhinitis, such as hives, itchy skin, itchy eyes, runny nose, and sneezing.  

>Commonly used H1 antagonists currently available in the United States are cetirizine, levocetirizine, desloratadine, loratadine, and fexofenadine.                                                   

>●H2 histamine receptors.                                                  
These receptors are mainly found in gastric parietal cells but are also present in vascular smooth muscle, neutrophils, suppressor T cells, the CNS, and the heart. H2 receptors are primarily involved in stimulating gastric acid secretion, which is closely linked to the development of peptic ulcers. H2 receptors also modify airway mucus production and vascular permeability. Antihistamines that bind to H2 receptors are often used to treat upper gastrointestinal conditions caused by excessive stomach acid, such as gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) and peptic ulcers. 

>Commonly used H2 antagonists currently available in the United States are cimetidine, famotidine
and nizatidine.

>Mast cell stabilizers are medications that can help treat a range of symptoms by limiting calcium flow across the mast cell membrane. This prevents the release of vasoactive substances and degranulation. 
Mast cell stabilizers are often prescribed in combination with histamine blockers. These medications include Cromolyn, Ketotifen, Lodoxamide, 
Nedocromil, Pemirolast, and Epinastine hydrochloride.

>Other medications used are included here:[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/mast-cell-activation-syndrome)

It may be a Histamine Intolerance (HI) instead or MCAS. Because histamine intolerance involves the mast cells, it is often confused with mast cell activation. The difference, however, is that with MCAS, mast cells secrete multiple mediators in addition to histamine—whereas in histamine intolerance, the mast cells release only histamines and nothing else.

If your Allergist is unable to perform the necessary tests, you may need a referral to an Immunologist. Or ask for a referral to a Hematologist who specializes in MCAS.

Many people recommend an elimination diet or a low histamine diet. 

[Mast Cell Activation Syndrome and Diet](https://patient.uwhealth.org/healthfacts/8114)

I would research H1 and H2 histamine blockers. There are plenty that are available over the counter. It's recommended to take double the normal dose. Split these dosages to morning and evening. Many people have recommended cetirizine or Xyzol for H1 and famotidine for H2. 

My symptoms didn't completely line up with MCAS initially. My symptoms have continued to get worse with dry, itchy, watery, and goopy eyes and reactions to certain foods after eating. I started drinking my favorite hazelnut coffee I haven't had in nine months because I switched brands. Now I'm having MCAS symptoms. I'm itchy, sneezing, and have a runny nose after eating or drinking things that don't agree with me. I'm allergic to the fillers in my thyroid medication.
I was taking Cetirizine for H1 and Famotidine for H2. One dose of each morning and evening. It caused worsening tachycardia and adrenaline or histamine dumps. I was also extremely nauseous. That never happened before. I switched to taking one dose of each Cetirizine and Famotidine in the morning only. I had to stop taking them all together. I learned that in some people, MCAS symptoms are too severe that OTC medications don't work. And/or we're allergic to the fillers in the OTCs. That's what happened to me.

I wrote a post about Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) and Histamine Intolerance (HI). It has more detailed information.

https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/s/zLEFEKyEm6

Adrenaline dumps can also trigger histamine dumps.
While not directly causing a ""dump"" in the same way, adrenaline release (an adrenaline ""dump"") can indirectly trigger a histamine release in the body, meaning that experiencing a surge of adrenaline can potentially lead to increased histamine levels, which could manifest as histamine-like symptoms in some individuals; this is because both systems are involved in the body's stress response. 

I take Fluvoxamine 25mg for ME/CFS symptoms, Diazepam for Dysautonomia, Fluticasone and Hydroxyzine for MCAS, and Omeprazole for Gerd (it's a PPI that also acts as a mast stabilizer). I hope you find some things that help manage your symptoms. Hugs🙏",1,1741228441.0,u_SophiaShay7,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j4l3na,https://i.redd.it/y8ebsbkyczme1.jpeg,State of the Rotation 🇺🇸,"My fellow coffee drinkers,

We stand on the brink of a revolution. For too long, hipster roasters, overpriced cafés, and Big Coffee have scammed us with bad roasts, ultra-processed low-grade beans disguised as “specialty,” and pure sugar-water tonics masquerading as coffee. They convinced people that button-smashing baristas in denim aprons, serving over-extracted sludge, are the peak of a “local coffee experience.”

Wrong.

With Rotation, we take back control. No more getting stuck with a bad bag. No more freezing terrible coffee, lying to ourselves that we will “drink it later.” Rotation is about freedom. 🇺🇸 Small bags, big taste, variety, and the power to drink only the best after sampling it first.

The Lies of Coffee Matrix, Elitist Hipster Roasters, HBS MBAs and the Gatekeepers of coffee.

For years, these groups have charged outrageous prices for coffee that tastes like disappointment. They distract us with seasonal marketing nonsense while pushing burnt or under-roasted beans, fake Reddit psyops, and subscription traps.

No more tricks. No more being forced to buy full sized bags before knowing if they’re actually good. No more listening to pretentious Redditors who blindly buy the same brands everyone else posts.

They want you trapped!! Locked into endless overpriced subscriptions, overpaying for mediocrity, waiting for a “better roast next time,” or being told to “upgrade your gear” as if that’s the problem.

Enough.

Financial Coffee Freedom Starts With Rotation

Bad coffee is not just a waste of taste—it is a waste of money. With Rotation, you skip the bad beans and spend only on the best. And if you sample something terrible? At least it was only a cup’s worth, not a full bag.

This is how we reclaim our tastebuds from overproduced, overpriced bags that add $5 just for a gimmicky sticker set, forcing you to buy six mid-tier bags just to qualify for “free shipping.”

No more paying for garbage. No more regretful sips.

We Respect Great Baristas and Roasters, but the Mediocre Ones? No More Passes.

The best baristas and roasters know their craft. They roast and pour with precision. They care—so much that you can taste it.

But the bad ones? The ones who had their parents bankroll their café, then act like making coffee is some tortured art project? The ones who use their business as an excuse to “travel and connect” with third-world farmers but never actually sell enough coffee to support them?

And don’t get me started on the ones who roll their eyes when you ask for an extra cup of ice or water, or those who guilt-trip you into “charity” at checkout.

No more automatic 30 percent tips for mediocrity.

Freedom of Choice and the Rotation Community

This movement is not about coffee snobbery it is about choice. Whether you drink hype-beast beans, some ones you found in a grocery store to exotic Best of Panama Geishas, intricate pour-overs, aero pressed or cold brew that has been steeping for a week, you are part of this.

We do not judge. (I do.)
We do not shame. (I will if you are half-steeping your coffee greatness.)

We drink what we want, when we want, at peak freshness, with variety, and just pure goodness.

But with small bags and deep 27s.

The Coffee Revolution Starts Now

We are skipping the bad beans and breaking free from the coffee matrix lies.

We will make coffee fun and hype again, but one 50g pack at a time.

Rotation is the future, and the future tastes amazing.

And If We Take This to Another Level? The Power Is in Our Hands.

We can work directly with savage cultivators who share our “f* the matrix” attitude and turn nobodies into Cup of Excellence winners.**

We can launch massive co-roasting spaces.
We can open “free” coffee cafe across the USA.
We can throw the best music and coffee parties, host massive 100+ person tastings, and build real-life coffee meetups.

We can do it all.

But first, we start mobbing together. We get our numbers up to 10,000 Rotations. We start making waves.

Thank you, and may your cups always be full with Rotation always on deck in your kitchen.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mochi ice cream is a unique and delightful treat that combines the chewy texture of mochi with creamy ice cream. While it's already a delicious dessert, making your own mochi ice cream at home opens the door to creativity and fun. Here are three creative hacks using a microwave to elevate your mochi ice cream experience.

### 1. Quick Mochi Preparation

Making mochi from scratch might seem daunting, but using a microwave can simplify the process greatly. Here’s how to prepare your own mochi dough:

1. **Ingredients:** You will need 1 cup of sweet rice flour (also known as mochiko), 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 cup of water, and cornstarch for dusting.
2. **Mix it up:** In a microwave-safe bowl, mix the sweet rice flour and sugar. Gradually add the water while stirring until you get a smooth batter.
3. **Heat it:** Cover the bowl with a microwave-safe lid or plastic wrap. Microwave the mixture for 1 minute. Stir, then microwave for another minute. For best results, heat it for 30 seconds one last time. The mixture should be sticky and slightly translucent.
4. **Cool and Shape:** Let the dough cool for a few minutes, then dust your hands and a clean surface with cornstarch to prevent sticking. Divide the dough into small pieces and flatten them into circles, making sure to keep the thickness even.
5. **Wrap the Ice Cream:** Place a scoop of your favorite ice cream in the center of each mochi disc. Pinch the edges together to seal, ensuring no ice cream is visible. Roll them gently in your hands to shape them neatly.
6. **Freeze:** Place the filled mochi on a parchment-lined tray and freeze for at least 2 hours before enjoying.

### 2. Mochi Ice Cream with a Flavor Twist

Enhance your homemade mochi ice cream by adding unique flavors to the dough. You can mix in different ingredients directly into the mochi dough before microwaving:

1. **Matcha Magic:** Add 1-2 teaspoons of matcha powder to the sweet rice flour mixture to create a green tea mochi. This will give the dough a beautiful color and a slightly earthy flavor that pairs wonderfully with vanilla ice cream.
2. **Chocolate Delight:** For chocolate lovers, add 2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder to the dry ingredients. This can turn your mochi into a rich chocolate pastry, perfect for enveloping mint or coffee ice cream!
3. **Fruit Flavors:** Mix in a few tablespoons of fruit puree or juice, like strawberry or mango, to provide a fresh and fruity taste to the mochi. You may need to adjust the water content slightly to maintain the right consistency.

### 3. Gourmet Toppings and Add-Ins

Once your mochi ice cream is ready, take it to the next level by adding delicious toppings and fillings!

- **Drizzle of Chocolate:** Melt some chocolate in the microwave (about 30 seconds at a time) and drizzle it over the mochi ice cream for a rich, decadent finish.
- **Crushed Nuts:** Sprinkle finely chopped nuts, such as almonds or pistachios, on top of your mochi ice cream. This will add crunch and enhance flavors nicely.
- **Fruit Garnishes:** Fresh fruit slices or a dollop of whipped cream can elevate your mochi. Serve your mochi alongside strawberries, raspberries, or even a few pieces of kiwi for a refreshing touch.
- **Flavored Sprinkles:** Use colorful sprinkles or edible glitter to make your dessert visually appealing, perfect for parties or family gatherings.

These hacks not only make it easy to prepare mochi ice cream using the microwave but also allow you to experiment and personalize your flavors. Enjoy your time in the kitchen, and indulge in the delicious world of homemade mochi ice cream!

24M here. So the other day while scrolling on grindr this random guy messaged me and we talked, we did send nudes but it was mostly flirty, he gave me his insta and we agreed to go for coffee. So that was 2 days ago, he is perfect, Law student and one of the best in his year, he is also a TA at uni. So the date was great we cuddled and kissed and just talked for 2 hours because he had class afterwards. I ended up walking with him to his uni a few blocks away and droped him off there. 

So he did mention wanting to go out more and has replied to my messages, but its rather cold, I am associating this to him being too focused with uni work, because he always messages me when he gets home from uni and before bed so there is a short window where he is active.

1j4kwvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/JazzBass/comments/1j4kwvr/open_jams/,Open Jams,"Just wanted to get some feedback and advice regarding preparation for attending open jams.Have  been playing electric bass for about six years but never played an open jam; actually never had too much experience playing with other musicians, just to tracks. Ideally I would like to practice/play in a studio environment but it seems like the only opportunity to play with other musicians are these ""open jams"" in a coffee house/cafe, small local bar..etc where they would possibly accept an electric bass player for jazz.I am fortunate enough to live in the NYC area but many of the open jams there are really for advanced musicians....super intimidating.

It seems like a daunting task to learn the chord progressions of so many standard jazz songs from memory (I refer to iReal for chord progressions) and the fact that I have little experience playing with other musicians makes it even more intimidating. Actually I never even committed standard jazz/blues chord progression bass lines to memory, I just play to song tracks.  If you played a track I could compose and create a bass line without a problem with maybe some light reference to the chord progressions. So my question is.....what preparation is necessary to start playing open jams? Committing a large amount of jazz standards to memory? Commit at least 6-7 standard jazz/blues bass line progressions to memory? Thank you for the advice and help.",2,1741227489.0,JazzBass,0,1.0,False

2. H&S roasters, I think they would be the best representation of the ultralight roasts

3. Brandywine, They are actually close to me and I have tried a bag of their before, and loved it! 

4. Hydrangea, had head good things and seem to be really fruity!
