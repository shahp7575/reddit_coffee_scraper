it’s honestly kind of depressing how much we’ve outsourced our courage to algorithms. it feels like asking someone for their number in person in 2026 is almost an invasion of privacy or something? like if it’s not through a screen, it’s ""too much.""  
  
sometimes i wonder if we’re all just waiting for the same thing but we’re too scared to be the one who breaks the silence. we keep complaining about apps being a wasteland, but the second we’re in a room with a real human, we just stare at our coffee and hope they happen to have a profile we can swipe on later.  
  
does anyone else feel like they’ve lost the ability to just... exist in public and be open to meeting people? or have we all just collectively decided that offline dating is dead and we’re sticking to the screen?",1,1771445488.0,TheDatingTea,0,1.0,False

It wasn’t a hot day. It wasn’t a cold day. But it also wasn’t just right. To be honest, he didn’t know what kind of day it was. He had been in bed for two days straight and didn’t plan on leaving that space any time soon. He lay there, fully stretched out over the frame of the bed. Stinking, but his senses were blissfully unaware of it. 
Walter has lost his wife. 
Did you know that a person could die from heartbreak? Not even as a dramatic way to put into a poem, no, actually die? Walter once read that somewhere and even if that headline was lying, he knew that he must be close now. Torn asunder, that’s how he felt. At the same time he also felt numb. 
He thought about just not going to his job anymore. But then, thinking big picture, he could spend even less time in bed when he gets thrown out of his apartment. 
Oh yes, his apartment. He moved. Thats what they wanted him to do. Move, change scenery, makes it easier to forget. He tried that. He really did. But everytime he went to the pier or some nice coffee place, all he could think about was how nice it would be if she was here to enjoy it. 
It was sudden and he was angry at her, at the time. They had a fight about their usual stuff. He was too suffocating, she was not loving enough. And it was never productive, he saw that now. They were just hurling these things against each other without trying to reach a conclusion. One accusation was answered by another accusation and so on. Now he misses their shouting matches. He could really get fired up during them, felt like all his neurons were firing and remembering everything from the past in that single moment, all the times she did him wrong. Twisting these things and spinning them to hurl another good accusation at her. Then she would throw something good his way, something that would trip him up. He hated it in those moments, but later he appreciated it and respected her intellect. These fights, they stimulated him more than anything else in their lives. Made him feel alive. 
He misses these matches and at the same time wishes he had just once said “I'm sorry honey. I am really trying but can’t seem to get it right. I think I need more of your help on this. I want this to work, so please, help me with that.”. Just once … Nelly. 

Nelly’s husband knocked at Walter’s door. Walter stood up reluctantly and opened, ready to shoo away whoever knocked. 
The husband’s fist connected cleanly with Walter’s jaw as if guided by some divine spirit. It knocked Walter to the floor. He could feel loose bits in his mouth while it flushed with blood.
“Finally found you, motherfucker.” He dragged Walter by his hair and neck further into his apartment. Walter felt humiliated, struggling and still not being able to do anything against this treatment.
“Thought I wouldn’t find your messages to her, huh?” He saw the fist coming, tried to shield himself, but it was useless. It hit his nose like he didn’t even try. The pain shocked him , made his vision blur. He gasped for air but his crushed nose didn’t let him catch enough.
“Thought she wouldn’t tell me how you followed her around? How you stalked her?”, he stomped onto his ribs. 
“I know she was running from you that night!”, another sharp kick into his side. Walter had even more trouble breathing now. Each inhale felt like forcing a knife into his own chest. But her husband continued kicking and got his liver. Sharp pain flowed through Walter, who wished he would just lose consciousness. 
“You little rat”, the husband picked up a bust that Walter used for decoration. He found out Nelly's husband doesn’t help decorate and leaves it all to Nelly. Walter thought she would like it, once she was in his apartment. 
The husband raised the bust over Walter head. 
“I ha

There is nothing wrong with rushing into it but I know so many people who regret it that I feel those who might think they need to get laid just to get laid and have the right to say your not a virgin it’s not worth it, it doesn’t have to be with a partner it can be a close friend, just wait until your with someone who can make it meaningful and don’t be selfish, make it meaningful for them too, remember your not the only person sex is a 2 (or more) person thing and all parties need to be equally provided for, I know too many girls who got with guys and they were selfish and didn’t do anything for the girl, and there are girls who get upset at guys for not being able to satisfy them, it takes time and experience be patient with each other, experiment but don’t force it, and please for the love of god to all those guys who don’t treat girls properly, foreplay is important, it doesn’t even matter if you cum fast you can still treat her the way she treated you.

And for all those who do this and don’t have regrets good, love life as you should.

Side note stop buying coffee, it’s not worth it, buy a coffee maker at home, I got one that was pod and carafe, it’s not hard to make your own coffee if you like iced coffee get some milk, sugar maybe some syrups, instead of spending 5-10$ a day on over priced coffee you spend maybe 100$ a month on the same product home made.

Also for those who drive, don’t get a big truck because it’s cool, think about it logically, get a smaller car with gas mileage, I know too many people who got big trucks and struggled with keeping up with gas because they were not able to work as much as someone who’s full time.

Also don’t rush to get a credit card, you are likely immature and unable to manage it, instead stick with debt and use the debit as a credit card, if you need better credit score instead of taking out credit, buy stuff in installments, but only things you can actually afford, I don’t have a credit card but I pay for my stuff in installments of 4 it builds my credit but I only buy what I can actually afford, if you don’t have the money to buy it straight out, don’t buy it, unless it’s a car or something else important like that.",2,1771444662.0,teenagers,1,1.0,False

1r8dezg,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1r8dezg/sciencebased_psychological_tricks_to_make_anyone/,Science-Based Psychological Tricks to Make Anyone OBSESSED With You,"Look, I've spent way too much time analyzing why some people just walk into a room and everyone gravitates toward them while others try so hard and get nothing. After going deep into social psychology research, reading Robert Cialdini's work, watching Charisma on Command breakdowns, and studying how human connection actually works, I figured out something crucial: likability isn't about being fake or manipulative. It's about understanding how human brains are wired and working WITH that instead of against it.



Most people think being likable means being agreeable or funny or impressive. Wrong. Dead wrong. The real secret is triggering specific psychological responses that make people feel good around you. And yeah, there's actual neuroscience behind this stuff.



\## Step 1: The Name Hack That Hits Different



Using someone's name in conversation isn't just polite, it literally activates their brain differently. Dale Carnegie wasn't bullshitting when he said ""a person's name is the sweetest sound in any language"" in How to Win Friends and Influence People (still the GOAT book on this stuff after 80+ years). 



Neuroscience shows that hearing our own name triggers the medial prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain associated with self-representation. Translation? When you use someone's name, their brain lights up like you just gave them a compliment.



But here's the key: don't overdo it like some creepy salesperson. Use it naturally when greeting them, when asking a question, or when showing appreciation. ""Hey Sarah, what do you think about this?"" feels way more personal than ""What do you think?""



The psychology: People are hardwired to care most about themselves. When you acknowledge them by name, you're signaling ""I see you as an individual"" not just ""random person #47.""



\## Step 2: Shut Up and Actually Listen (No Really)



Most people don't listen, they just wait for their turn to talk. And others can FEEL that energy. The Charisma on Command YouTube channel breaks this down perfectly, showing how charismatic people like Chris Hemsworth or Jennifer Lawrence actually pause, process, and respond to what others say instead of just loading their next story.



Try this: When someone's talking, focus 100% on what they're saying. Not on your phone. Not on your response. On THEM. Then ask a follow-up question about something specific they mentioned. 



""Wait, you said you're into pottery now? How'd you get into that?""



The psychology: This is called active listening, and it triggers the reward centers in people's brains. When someone feels genuinely heard, they associate those positive feelings with YOU. Research from Harvard Business School shows that asking questions releases dopamine in the other person's brain, same chemical involved in pleasure and reward.



Also, people who ask more questions, especially follow-up questions, are rated as more likable. It's not rocket science, it's just rare.



\## Step 3: Mirror Their Energy (But Make It Subtle)



This one's called mirroring or the chameleon effect, and it's been studied to death. Basically, subtly matching someone's body language, tone, or speaking pace makes them feel more comfortable with you on a subconscious level.



If they're leaning back and relaxed, don't be all up in their face with intense energy. If they're excited and talking fast, match that vibe. If they're speaking quietly, bring your volume down.



The psychology: Research published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology found that people who were subtly mimicked rated their interaction partner as more likable and the interaction itself as smoother. Your brain interprets similarity as safety and connection.



But don't be weird about it. Don't copy every single gesture like a mime. Just vibe with their general energy.



\## Step 4: Give Them the Spotlight (Ego Fuel)



Here's something most people screw up: they think being interesting makes them likable. Nope. Making OTHERS feel interesting is the real move.



Let people talk about themselves. Ask about their projects, their opinions, their stories. When they share something they're proud of, show genuine interest. ""That's actually impressive, how long did that take you?""



The psychology: Harvard neuroscientists found that talking about ourselves activates the same pleasure centers in the brain as food or money. It literally feels good. When you give people that opportunity and actually care about their answers, they'll associate you with positive emotions.



There's a reason The Like Switch by Jack Schafer (former FBI behavior analyst) emphasizes this. He used these techniques to recruit spies. If it works on trained intelligence operatives, it'll work on your coworker.



If reading through all these books and research sounds overwhelming, there's a personalized learning app called BeFreed that pulls from all this psychology research, expert insights, and books like the ones mentioned here. You just tell it your specific goal, like ""I'm an introvert who wants to be more magnetic in social settings,"" and it builds a custom learning plan with audio lessons you can adjust from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. 



The knowledge comes from vetted sources, psychology research, and expert interviews in communication and relationships. Plus you get a virtual coach that actually understands your specific struggles and adapts as you learn. Makes the whole process way less intimidating than trying to read every social psychology book out there.



\## Step 5: The Vulnerability Card (Strategic Honesty)



People don't connect with perfect. They connect with real. Sharing something slightly vulnerable, admitting you don't know something, or being honest about a small struggle actually makes you MORE likable, not less.



Brené Brown's research on vulnerability shows this perfectly. When you show you're human, others feel permission to be human around you too. That builds trust stupid fast.



But here's the line: share something relatable and slightly vulnerable, not your deepest trauma to someone you just met. ""Man, I totally bombed that presentation"" works. ""Here's my entire therapy session"" doesn't.



The psychology: This is called the pratfall effect. People who show minor flaws or imperfections are rated as more likable than those who seem perfect, because perfection creates distance and makes others feel inadequate.



\## Step 6: Smile Like You Mean It (Facial Feedback Loop)



Real talk: genuine smiles are contagious and they activate mirror neurons in other people's brains. When you smile authentically (and yeah, people can tell the difference), the other person's brain automatically mimics that emotion.



But a fake customer service smile? People clock that immediately and it creates distrust.



The psychology: Studies show that genuine smiles, called Duchenne smiles (where your eyes crinkle, not just your mouth), trigger positive responses in others. Your brain can't help but respond to someone who seems genuinely happy to see you.



Even better, smiling actually makes YOU feel better too because of the facial feedback hypothesis. Your facial expressions influence your emotions, not just the other way around.



\## Step 7: Remember the Small Shit They Tell You



Someone mentions they have a big meeting Tuesday? Check in with them Wednesday and ask how it went. They said they're trying to quit coffee? Notice when they order tea instead.



This isn't stalker behavior, it's showing you actually pay attention. Most people are so focused on themselves they never do this, so when YOU do, it stands out like crazy.



The psychology: This demonstrates attentiveness and care, which are foundation blocks of trust and connection. When people realize you remember details about their life, it signals ""you matter to me"" without having to say it directly.



\## Step 8: Validate Their Feelings (Not Just Their Opinions)



When someone shares something they're frustrated or excited about, acknowledge the EMOTION, not just the facts.



Instead of ""Well, technically your boss was right,"" try ""That sounds really frustrating, I'd be annoyed too.""



You're not agreeing or disagreeing with the situation, you're validating that their emotional response is legitimate.



The psychology: Emotional validation is one of the most powerful tools in human connection. It makes people feel seen and understood on a deeper level. Research shows that feeling understood is one of the top predictors of relationship satisfaction, whether romantic, friendship, or professional.



\## Step 9: Find Common Ground Fast



Humans are tribal. We like people who are similar to us. So find something, anything you have in common and mention it early.



""Oh you're from Chicago? I lived there for two years."" ""You listen to that podcast too? The episode on XYZ was wild.""



The psychology: This is called the similarity-attraction effect. We're hardwired to trust and like people who remind us of ourselves because evolutionarily, similarity meant safety. Shared interests, backgrounds, or experiences create instant rapport.



\## Step 10: End Interactions on a High Note



Don't overstay your welcome. Leave conversations when they're still good, not when they've gotten awkward or run out of steam.



The psychology: The peak-end rule shows that people remember experiences based on their peak moment and how they ended, not the average of the whole thing. If you end on a positive note, that's what sticks.



""This was great, let's continue this later"" leaves them wanting more instead of ""finally this conversation is over.""



That's it. No magic, no manipulation, just understanding how human brains actually work and using that knowledge to build genuine connections. Try this stuff and watch how differently people respond to you.",1,1771444502.0,SocialBlueprint,0,1.0,False

I 27F had my first proper coffee for the first time, bit embarrassing to never have one before now at my age but it's all good.

Like my mind was clear and silent, I didn't even get a song in my head, I've usually always got one going.

The problem is, I messed up with consistency. We had plans a few times, and I ended up rescheduling or not locking things in properly. Most recently, we were supposed to go out tomorrow and I still hadn’t even picked a place. I had also cancelled the last two dates before this. From her perspective, I get why it looks like I’m not that interested or not serious.

On top of that, I think she might believe I’m talking to other women or not taking her seriously because of the way I text or the kind of reels I send. That’s honestly not the case.

Lately she’s been distant, and she basically said she’s not sure we should see each other anymore. She seems (is) upset and isn’t really responding now.

We did talk at one point about meeting for coffee and she even sent me her class schedule, but right now she’s not replying.

I genuinely like her and I know I met her at a time when I wasn’t as put together mentally as I should’ve been. I also realize I might have over-texted at times and then been inconsistent with actual plans, which probably confused her.

My question is:

Should I give her space and wait for her to reach out?

When she became my supervisor, that created a strained relationship between us. She became more negative towards me and starting showing favoritism towards my teammate, and eventually helped her get promoted to a position that without my knowledge was a position we could be promoted to, all behind the scenes.

After hiring some more team members, she started warming up towards me more, taking me out for coffee, wanting to know what's going on in my life, etc.

On my last day of work she said I hope we can be lifelong friends. I thought was a bit of a stretch and just something you don't really tell people. I have also been hearing from some old coworkers that are now my friends that she's been creating more and more of a toxic work environment.

Yesterday she texted me and said she'd love to meet up for coffee, and suggested a date and time. She didn't ask so it felt very ""supervisor"" -like. I really have no desire to meet up with her. I don't feel good keeping this relationship going, esp now that I left and am trying to move on from a toxic work environment, that was hugely created by her.

Not looking for medical advice, just wondering if anyone relates. I started Aduvanz (lisdexamphetamine/Vyvanse) in August and landed on 50 mg. It worked great with minimal side effects (mostly low appetite). No anxiety, no sleep issues, could drink coffee and exercise without problems.

Since January, though, it feels like my nervous system is overstimulated. I’ve had anxiety, a sense of doom, slightly elevated heart rate, harder heartbeats, and occasional palpitations. Coffee now makes me feel awful. I also notice intense hyperfocus where I’m working until 6–7pm for no reason and struggling to switch off, which feels stressful rather than productive.

It’s not every day, but it happens often and didn’t occur earlier on this dose.

I’ve lost 5–7 kg and wonder if weight loss can change how a dose feels? I’ve also developed more reflux over the past few months (belching, heartburn, increased sensitivity to acidic food and coffee).

1r8d4z5,https://www.reddit.com/r/anxietypilled/comments/1r8d4z5/hello_part_2/,Hello? (Part 2.),"Chapter 3: The Journey to the Cabin.

I set out on my hike to the cabin. The pull along cart I was given, well. it wasn’t the best, but it worked. It had an awkward handle to hold on to, that made a little difficult to pull. but thankfully it had big wheels and handled the weight of a year’s worth of supplies without much issue. But could be better. The trail was mostly flat and smooth, nothing too challenging yet. Thankfully.

From the station to the cabin, I had about a five hour hike ahead, giving me a chance to preview the area I’d patrol.

A nice introduction to everything.

I passed a few small creeks Rich had mentioned, stopping to note some landmarks like some distinctive rocks and trees, the water flow, and small animals going about their day. Nothing unusual for the woods.

After about two and a half hours in, I needed to take a break, the cart's weight was starting to wear down on my legs, a hard reminder of my last two years glued behind a desk. I stopped and pulled out a snack and a thermos of water from my backpack. I sat down on a rock next to the creek and enjoyed the views while eating a candy bar. Taking in the sights and sounds of nature, as I'm writing down more notes and eating. I suddenly noticed something odd.

All the normal woodland noises, wind rustling leaves, birds chirping, animals scurrying, all started to fade ever so gradually, until it was eerily quiet.

No birds, no critters, not even the creek beside me.

And then, very faintly, something whispered through the air, growing closer until it was right by my ear, a gentle “Hello?”

My heart skipped. I froze, the candy bar halfway to my mouth. “I’m hearing things. No way that was real."" I thought. But the voice had been so clear, very soft, an almost curious voice. like it was testing me. I glanced around, I saw nothing, but trees and the trail, not a soul in sight.

My mind raced. Why would something out here say “Hello”? I remembered the woman I spoke with on the phone, Jonah’s offhand mention at the gate, Josh’s vague warning, and Rich’s intense stare when he drilled the rule into me.

They all acted like saying “Hello” was life or death, but no one explained why. Was it some local superstition? A park tradition? Or something else entirely, something tied to this unnatural silence?

I swallowed hard, feeling exposed. I hadn’t said “Hello” when I stopped here, and now the woods felt… watchful. “Okay, fine,” I muttered to myself, following their instructions. “Hello? Sorry I didn’t say that earlier. I'm new around here.”

As subtly as the silence had crept in, the sounds returned: wind, water, birds, squirrels. All normal again. I exhaled, tension easing, but questions gnawed at me. What was that voice? Why did saying “Hello” seem to reset the world around me? It wasn’t just politeness, there was weight to it, like a key to something I didn’t understand.

I made a mental note to press Josh or Rich later, though their cagey responses so far didn’t promise answers.

“Okay, I have to remember to say ‘Hello’ anytime I enter a new area,” I told myself. “Apparently, something out here needs to hear it.” But what? And why did it feel like the woods were listening, waiting for me to slip up?

I finished my candy bar, packed up my trash, checked my map and compass, and continued for the remaining two and a half hours.

After what felt like forever, I finally reached the cabin just before nightfall, with the sun low enough to cast a golden glow on a small, picturesque log cabin, like a postcard scene.

Trees formed a canopy overhead, a clean walkway led to the door, birds and animals bustled, wind and water whispered sweetly. It was simply perfect.

I pulled the cart to the front door, then I start to search for a lockbox Rich mentioned, around back, hanging under a foundation leg i. I went around back and retrieved the key where Rich said it was. Then I returned to the front door and as I go to unlock the door, it happens again.

The silence crept in slow.

birds stopped, animals hushed, the woods goes quiet, and I start to hear the same sound when the voice went by my ear. My stomach twisted. Not again. Was this going to happen every time I forgot their damn rule? Was there something out here enforcing this ritual, waiting for me to acknowledge it? I didn’t know if I was being paranoid or if the woods were playing tricks, but I wasn’t about to test it.

“Hello out there!” I called, louder than necessary, my voice echoing slightly.

The sounds returned, just like before. I stood there, key in hand, staring into the darkening forest.

“Why does this keep happening?” I muttered. “What’s causing it? And why the hell does something out here say ‘Hello’ first?”

I wanted to chalk it up to exhaustion or my imagination, but the voice on the trail felt too real, too deliberate. It wasn’t human, not quite, but it wasn’t an animal either. It felt… expectant. Like it was part of some unspoken pact I’d stumbled into. I shook my head. “Only time will tell, I guess.”

I opened the door, dust billowed in the fading sunlight, visible through the windows. Clearly, no one had been here in a while. I stepped in and said, “Hello, I’m new here! I’ll be staying for a while, hope that’s okay?” My voice sounded small in the empty cabin, but I wasn’t taking chances after the trail. If saying 'Hello' kept the silence at bay, I’d do it, even if I didn’t understand why. Maybe it was just a quirk of the job, but the way Rich’s eyes had bored into me when he said it made me think there was more to it, something he wasn’t telling me.

Nothing responded, so maybe the “Hello” I said outside sufficed. I began unloading the cart, brought everything inside, and got settled in. I checked the computer, tried to figure out the old oven (knobs worn, hard to read temp and timer), I inspected the bathroom (shower with running water, but toilet was an outhouse-style seat over a deep hole, no strong smell, given the vacancy). After unpacking into drawers and the closet, it was dark out. I radioed Rich and logged today’s findings.

“This is Cabin 12 to Outpost Chance. Anyone copy?”

After a moment, Josh replied. “This is Ranger Josh with Outpost Chance. You make it to 12 alright? Over.”

“Yes safe and sound, I just finished getting settled in. Over.”

“Good. Glad you’re safe. What do you think of it, Alex? Over.”

“So far, so good. Gorgeous views, plenty to explore. The Cabin’s a little more Rustic than your dad let on, but it’s home now. I’ll make the best of it. Over.”

“Yeah, it's a bit run-down, and could use some updates. But it’s a roof and a bed. So make it home. How was the walk? Over.”

Rich said report anything, but not to discuss the 'Hello' rule. How do I explain the silence and faint voice? I needed answers. “On my way, I stopped halfway for a break—”

Josh cut in before I could finish, “Did you make sure to, well, you know? Over.""

Knowing he understood, I pushed for clarity. “Not at first. I sat down to rest, ate a little bit and suddenly everything went dead quiet. Then I swore I heard a faint ‘Hello’ go by my ear. I said it back, and everything went back  to normal. The same happened when I reached the cabin, but I remembered in time. Josh, what’s the deal? Why does something out here say ‘Hello’ and need to be told it back? What am I dealing with? Over.""

He let out a sigh, his voice sharp with urgency. “Make sure, I mean 100% sure, you say it! Every time you enter your zone. No matter what. Just do it and trust me, okay? Over.”

I didn’t fully trust him, not when no one would explain, but what choice did I have? “Okay, I trust you. I’ll keep it up. But besides that, the walk was uneventful. Copy that? Over.”

“copy, have you filled out your report yet? And is everything working? Power, water, fridge, oven? Or does anything need repairs? Over.”

“All good. The Oven’s a bit tricky cause the knobs are a bit messed up. but I'll make it work. And I'll have my report soon, before bed. How Copy? Over.”

“Copy. And Drop the extra radio lingo, no need. But good to hear. Make sure to radio in if you need anything. Oh, also get up sometime tonight for a quick peek outside. The Fire crossed our line unexpectedly. Over.”

“Can do. An Alarm is set for three hours from now. I’ll radio in if it’s important. Over.”

“Sounds good. I’m signing off. Sleep well, stay safe. Josh out.”

“Night, Josh. Alex out.”

I turned off the radio, grabbed a snack, and  sat down at the computer to log my report, omitting the silence and voice, but including notes and observations. Submitted it to the board's and Rich’s email.

Now With that done, I checked out the games on here. There was three. Tetris, Spider Solitaire and Texas Hold ’em. Better than absolutely nothing, I guess.

I started to play the poker game, turned on some music from my phone. And got lost playing for awhile. Then after some time. Without warning, silence fell. Absolute quiet, no music, no outside sounds, not even my own breath. fear hit, as I did begin to hear... multiple loud knocks at the door… Followed by a deep, gentle… “Hello?”

End of Chapter 3.

Chapter 4: The Knocking.

Loud, continuous knocking shook the door, followed by a deep, gentle “Hello?”

“What the fuck?” I thought, heart pounding.

Rich had said no one was allowed in zone this time of the year. And especially with the fire going on near by. staff only he said.

But possibly a lost hiker, maybe? Or even one of the guys messing with me?  I didn’t know, but the knocking grew louder, harder, insistent.

I stood frozen, glancing at the machete by the desk. Better be safe than sorry. I slowly get up to grab it, then tucking it behind me to avoid scaring a potential hiker, and I then crept to the door. Just in case, I called out, “Hello?”

The knocking stopped. Dead silence.

I gripped the knob, turned it slowly, and pulled the door open. Nothing. Not a soul, not even a footprint in the dirt.

The woods stared back at me, still, like they were holding their breath. I ran back inside and grabbed a flashlight from the desk and back outside to check around. I circled the cabin, staying close to its walls. Crickets chirped, owls hooted in the distance, all was peaceful, normal. But something felt wrong, like the silence was waiting to return.

“What the actual hell was that?” I muttered to myself. I headed back inside. I locked the door, checked every window and made sure they were all locked. and shut off the lights. It was nearly 1:30 a.m. I’d done my nightly check outside, as Josh had asked basically. and everything seemed fine except for the visitor there.

I was exhausted and needed to sleep. So I went to get ready for bed. I brushed my teeth, washed my face, grateful for the heated water. As I was leaving the bathroom. The toilet caught my eye as I passed. It was too deep, not like a normal outhouse style toilet. too dark, not dark in the it's just black down there. I mean dark like a bad presence was down there. like it led somewhere beyond dirt. I shivered, avoiding it.

I got changed into my sleep clothes. I then got into my sleeping bag, the bed seemed comfy but well worn, its sheets being clean are questionable though. The cabin was pretty chilly, so the sleeping bag a smart choice on all accounts. I zipped myself in tight. got comfortable, and passed out quicker than I thought. the woods now peaceful and sweet sounds lulling me to sleep. A good night, despite everything.

The next morning I woke up around 8:30 a.m. and surprisingly slept fairly well. I unzip my sleeping bag, the cold air biting me. Getting out of my sleeping bag took serious effort, who likes waking up freezing?

I got started on my morning routine. Get the coffee going, brush my teeth, put on clean clothes, have my coffee, and be ready for the day and my new life ahead.

(Several months pass)

Time had flew by out there.

When I arrived, it was starting to get chilly, leaves just starting falling. And now, a blanket of snow draped over everything, turning my zone into a breathtaking winter wonderland. The beauty of these woods never ceased, but I couldn’t shake the memory of that first night’s visitor or the way the silence felt alive, just waiting.

I spent my days out patrolling, mapping out important landmarks, the creeks near by, all the trees and what one's may fall at any time. I noted all the animal patterns. a massive buck with an impressive rack leading a herd deer, the squirrels scurrying about and playing. I saw a colorful duck flying overhead one day, with a unique neck band. Never seen one like it before.

I snapped a cute photo of two chipmunks sitting on a snow dusted log, snowflakes falling gently past them.

My reports to Rich and headquarters were detailed, sent via the cabin’s ancient computer. I was beginning to get pretty damn good at Texas Hold ’Em in my downtime, I started one of my puzzles and I'm almost done with one of my books. the oven’s worn knobs still baffled me, not sure what the temp actually is or anything like that, I've just been cooking by turning it on and wait for it to warm up, and then cook by guesswork and pull it out before it gets to burnt.

No more silence or ghostly visitors since that first night. I said “Hello” every time I stepped outside, entered a new area, or returned to the cabin. It was second nature now, a ritual to keep whatever called these woods home at bay.

Things felt and were normal...for a while.

Then one morning, I woke up late, around 10 a.m. Something was wrong.

Silence. Absolute, suffocating silence.

No animals outside, no wind rushing by, nothing at all.

“Maybe I’m still half asleep,” I told myself, heading to the bathroom. I peed, couldn’t hear myself go. I brushed my teeth, washed my face. no sound of water, no clink of the sink. It was like the woods had swallowed sound itself, just like that first night.

Had I forgotten to say “Hello” at some point yesterday and it's just now going silent? I didn’t think so, but I wasn’t taking chances. “Hello!” I called, waiting for the woods’ sounds to return, like before.

Nothing. No noise came back like the times before, just absolute deafening silence.

I couldn’t even hear my own voice, haven't had that happen before.

Panic crept in. I threw on a pair pants, a tee shirt, and some slippers I brought, stepped outside, and yelled, “Hello!” Still nothing. Just silence.

“Oh shit, this can’t be good.” I hurried back inside, went to the computer, and emailed the station.

""Rich, Josh, you two there? I just woke up and I can’t hear anything. What’s going on?”

A few minutes later, Jonah replied.

""Alex, it’s Jonah. Rich and Josh are out meeting with the neighboring rangers about some downed trees blocking the road coming in to the park. I’m watching the station while they're gone. Have you been making sure you're saying ""Hello""?""

“Yes, every damn time I move or breathe! I’ve been religious about it. Are you saying it?” I typed, frustrated.

He replied “I've been here for Four years and have never slipped up once. But the station’s safe space, The fence keeps it out. So I can hear just fine. Are you sure you’ve been saying it?”

“YES, I SWEAR! But If I'm making sure to say it out here. Then why is this happening?”

Jonah took a while to respond.

""Well, a year ago, during the off season. A homeless man wandered into the park, no one knew he was here, until the Silence hit.  we only knew what was happening cause Rich went to check the gate due to a brunch falling on it and noticed, after an hour of searching we came up with nothing. the Police were called and a massive search began. After a few days they found him. he couldn’t speak, just stared blankly. The police took him and after 3 days, the silence lifted. We never learned why it did""

My stomach dropped.

""So, then someone is probably out here? Like a hiker or something? And why didn't he speak?""

Jonah replied. “No clue, he couldn't even write or do anything at all. It's like he was in shock. But If there's someone new in the zone, it stirs things up and it won't stop until they are found and told to say 'Hello'.""

“Alright so should I head to the station to meet with you and then we both go search together?”

“No, I can’t leave. Rich’s orders: someone stays for radio and messages. Start at your cabin, search east heading toward the station and I'll be waiting for you.""

Great. I had to find a lost person in this silent hell, alone, without hearing. Whatever was out here didn’t just want ‘Hello’ it needed it, and someone’s silence was breaking everything.

""Okay, I'll pack a few things and start east. What’s the safe code? I'm not going out there without the Shotgun.""

""We're not allowed to give it out to anyone in the cabin unless it’s an absolute emergency.”

“THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE FUCKING EMERGENCY JONAH! GIVE ME THE DAMN CODE!”

“Okay fine. 2709. there's Shells inside a bag inside. Be safe, bring your radio in case you find someone. If you’re not here by nightfall, I will come out looking.”

“I’ll do my best, hopefully I'll hear from you soon"" I replied.

I threw on my cold weather gear, packed some food, water, an extra jacket, flashlight, batteries, and the radio. I opened the safe, loaded the 12 gauge, slung the ammo bag over my shoulder, grabbed my map, and headed east.

As I went out into the woods, the silence felt heavier, like it was watching me. I had 10 miles to cover before dark, hoping to find whoever was causing this and stop it, for their safety and all of ours.

Five miles in, around 2 p.m., I made good time despite the silence. Dark clouds rolled in, and snow fell hard, blanketing the trail. I neared a pond I’d marked, expecting it frozen, empty of all animals and life right now.

I was wrong.

The massive buck I’d noted was thrashing in the pond, breaking ice, covered in blood. Along the bank, laying all Around it, the bodies of his herd lay scattered, torn apart. The silence wasn’t just quiet it was driving the woods to slaughter.

“What the hell is going on?” I thought, frozen, watching the buck’s frenzied destruction.

It then suddenly stopped, it turned towards me, it saw me, and then charged at me.

here's what i learned from actual experts and research that changed everything:

your needs always come last

this one hit different when i read ""Set Boundaries, Find Peace"" by Nedra Glover Tawwab. she's a licensed therapist who's worked with thousands of clients struggling with this exact issue. the book won multiple awards and became an instant NYT bestseller for good reason. Tawwab breaks down how childhood conditioning and societal expectations (especially for women but affects everyone) wire us to believe our worth = how much we sacrifice. insanely good read that made me realize putting yourself first isn't selfish, it's survival.

the neuroscience backs this up too. when you constantly suppress your needs, your brain's stress response stays activated. cortisol levels spike, immune system weakens, mental health tanks. dr. gabor maté talks about this extensively in his work, how chronic self abandonment literally manifests as physical illness.

practical shift: start with micro decisions. want coffee but your friend suggests tea? get the coffee. sounds trivial but these tiny acts rewire your brain to prioritize your preferences. the finch app is actually perfect for this, it gamifies self care habits and sends gentle reminders to check in with yourself throughout the day.

you feel guilty saying no

this book will make you question everything you think you know about guilt. ""The Disease to Please"" by harriet braiker (clinical psychologist, 20+ years experience) explains how people pleasing is basically an anxiety disorder in disguise. your nervous system perceives saying no as genuine danger because rejection = social death in evolutionary terms. your amygdala freaks out, floods you with guilt and fear, makes you cave every single time.

but here's the thing, every time you say yes when you mean no, you're teaching people your boundaries don't matter. you become the person everyone expects infinite energy from. brené brown calls this ""over functioning"" and it destroys relationships because it creates resentment on your end and entitlement on theirs.

try this: when someone asks something, buy yourself time. ""let me check my schedule and get back to you"" gives your rational brain space to override the anxiety response. practiced this for months and now saying no feels neutral instead of catastrophic.

the therapy in a pocket app (formerly known as youper) uses CBT techniques to help challenge those automatic guilt thoughts in real time. it's like having a therapist available 24/7 to talk you down from people pleasing spirals.

you don't even know what you want anymore

spent so long accommodating others i genuinely forgot what i enjoyed. sounds dramatic but research shows this is textbook codependency. melody beattie's ""Codependent No More"" is the bible on this, sold millions of copies since the 80s for good reason. best book on understanding how you lose yourself in other people's needs, wants, problems until your entire identity revolves around being useful.

beattie explains how codependency isn't about loving too much, it's about loving yourself too little. you outsource your self worth to others because you never developed internal validation. the solution isn't to stop caring about people, it's to care about yourself with the same intensity.

start asking yourself constantly: what do i actually want right now? not what should i want, not what makes me look good, what genuinely feels right for me? journaling helps but talking out loud works better because it forces specificity.

if you want something more structured that connects all these insights, BeFreed is a personalized learning app that builds adaptive plans around your specific struggles. type in something like ""stop people pleasing as a recovering perfectionist"" and it pulls from psychology research, therapy frameworks, and expert interviews to create audio lessons tailored just for you. built by a team from columbia and google, it lets you adjust the depth from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with real examples. the voice options are honestly addictive, there's even a sarcastic tone that makes heavy topics way more digestible. been using it during commutes and it's helped connect the dots between all these books and actually applying them to my specific patterns.

the insight timer app has tons of guided meditations specifically for reconnecting with yourself. sounds woo woo but there's solid research showing regular meditation strengthens the insula, the brain region responsible for interoception (sensing your internal state). basically helps you tune back into your own needs and feelings.

the uncomfortable truth

people will be upset when you start prioritizing yourself. they got comfortable with your over giving. that discomfort is necessary. healthy relationships adapt and respect your boundaries. toxic ones fall apart because they only functioned through your self sacrifice.

took me two years of consistent practice to stop automatically putting everyone first. still catch myself slipping sometimes. but the difference is i actually have energy now, genuine desire to help instead of compulsion, relationships based on mutual respect not one sided depletion.

you can't pour from an empty cup but more importantly, you're not supposed to be a cup for everyone else to drink from whenever they want. you're a whole person with needs, wants, limits. treating yourself like you matter isn't selfish. it's the most radical thing you can do.",1,1771443753.0,MenWithDiscipline,0,1.0,False

What do you guys think?,"I (M, 26) recently decided to use Tinder for the first time. I met this really cute, interesting guy (31) there and we hit it off, added each other on IG and started texting. After a week, we met at a coffee shop and have been going out a few times since. I really like him, he's cute and polite. There were a few things I didn't like about him from the start, but I won't get into that since it's honestly really shallow stuff.

We had our last date on Valentine's Day, had dinner and we also had sex, which was honestly really awkward, but I guess I could chalk that up to first time nerves, and us not really knowing what gets each other's motor running. What alarmed me somewhat was that he got to talking about his family and background, and he shared that his parents are Jehova's Witnesses and are not accepting of his sexuality at all. He isn't a part of the religion anymore but still lives with his parents and sort of lives by their rules and expectations.

He mentioned he had a boyfriend before, so I asked how that played out with his parents, and he said that his parents didn't know about his boyfriend, that his boyfriend wasn't allowed to go to his house or be in any way acknowledged by his family, and this raised some concerns for me, to be honest.

I come from a Christian family, so I don't know if me being hesitant is hypocritical, but my family has always been very accepting, and they love me just the way I am. They all know I'm gay and if I have a boyfriend, they expect to meet him and include him in our family, in a way, and I would like to be a part of his family as well eventually, or at the very least not hidden from them.

I do like this guy, but I wonder if this is a situation that could lead to trouble or resentment in the future and am questioning if it's worth it to carry on with this, especially since I'm not that emotionally invested yet.

Amtrak, for example, has their private, internal real-time tracking, and general purpose, less accurate, updates-every-few-minutes public tracking via a web page.

He forgot where he put the remote. Forgot the name of the neighbor’s dog. Forgot that I take my coffee black now, not the sugared mud I drank in college.
He did not forget my birthday.
Every year at 6:12 a.m., the exact minute I was born, my phone would buzz.
“Happy birthday, bug,” he’d say, voice still thick with sleep. “I was there when you came screaming into this world. Figured I should be there every year after.”
Even when the forgetting got bigger.
Even when he called me by my mother’s name.
Even when he asked if I was still working at the video store that closed in 2009.
He never forgot 6:12.
The year he moved into the care facility, I drove him there in silence.
He stared out the window like a child being taken somewhere he did not agree to. When we stopped at a red light, he looked at me and said, very clearly, “Do not let me disappear.”
It was the last clean sentence he ever gave me.
Inside, the place smelled like lemon disinfectant and overcooked vegetables. A woman at the desk spoke to him in a voice usually reserved for golden retrievers.
He squeezed my hand once before they wheeled him away. Not hard. Just enough.
That night, I lay in bed and set an alarm for 6:12.
I do not know why. Habit, maybe. Hope is just a more polite word for denial.
The phone did not ring.
My birthday came three months later.
By then, he had stopped recognizing me altogether. I was “that nice young man” who visited on Sundays. Sometimes I tested him, holding up old photographs.
“Who’s this?” I would ask, pointing at a picture of him lifting me onto his shoulders.
He would squint. “Looks happy,” he would say.
Yes, I wanted to scream. He was.
At 6:12 a.m., my phone buzzed.
I jolted upright so fast I pulled the charger from the wall.
Unknown Number.
My heart thrashed like it was trying to escape my ribs.
I answered but could not speak.
Static. A shuffling sound. Then
“Happy birthday, bug.”
His voice.
Stronger than it had been in months. Clear. Anchored.
“I was there when you came screaming into this world,” he said, and I could hear the smile. “Figured I should be there every year after.”
I pressed the phone so hard to my ear it hurt. “Dad?”
There was a pause. Paper rustling.
“If you are hearing this,” he continued, but now the rhythm was wrong, careful, deliberate, “then I forgot.”
Air left my lungs in one violent exhale.
“I knew it might happen,” he said. “So I asked the nurse to help me record this while I still, while I still knew things.”
Another pause. I could hear him breathing. Counting.
“I do not know who you are right now,” he admitted softly. “But I know you mattered enough to scare me.”
I folded forward, forehead against my knees.
“You were the best thing I ever did right,” he said. “If I forget your face, that is my brain failing. Not my love.”
A swallow. A small, embarrassed laugh.
“Do not let me disappear,” he said again. Not confused this time. Intentional.
The message clicked off.
6:14 a.m.
I visit him every Sunday.
He does not know my name.
But sometimes, when I stand to leave, he grabs my hand before I can step away.
“Bug,” he says.
Just that.
Like his mouth remembers what his mind cannot.
And every year at 6:12 a.m., my phone rings.
Not because he remembers.
But because he knew he would not.

Her voice had that specific tone, the one she uses when she needs something but won't say it directly. ""We need you here,"" she said. Not ""are you okay."" Not ""I'm scared."" Just, we need you here.

I told her I'd think about it.

She went quiet for a long second. Then: ""What's there to think about? He's your father.""

And I thought about a gas station off Route 9. I was seven years old, standing next to a trash can that smelled like old coffee, watching their car pull back onto the highway without me.

Here is what people don't understand about parents who do things like that. They don't think they're cruel. They genuinely believe a terrified child standing alone at a highway gas station for 45 minutes is a teaching moment. My mother came back, leaned out the window, and said, ""Did you learn your lesson?""

I said yes. I said whatever I had to say to get back in that car.

But here's what I actually learned. Not the lesson she intended. The real one.

I learned that the people assigned to protect you are sometimes the exact people you need protection from. And I learned that the moment you understand that, at seven years old, something in you has to grow up very fast and very quietly, because there is nobody coming to save you. You have to save yourself.

That knowledge doesn't leave. It shapes everything. How you form attachments. How much you trust people who say they love you. Whether you believe safety is real or just temporary.

Psychologists call this disorganized attachment. When the source of fear and the source of comfort are the same person, a child's nervous system gets stuck in a loop it was never designed to handle. You want to run to them and away from them at the same time. And for a lot of people, that loop runs quietly in the background for decades before they even realize it's there.

That wasn't the only incident. I want to be clear about that.

There was the time my mother told me I was ""too sensitive"" for crying after she said something cutting in front of her friends. There was the ongoing way my father would go completely silent for days, no explanation, and I would exhaust myself trying to figure out what I'd done wrong. There was the way every household rule existed only when it was convenient for them, and disappeared the moment enforcing it required effort.

It was never one thing. It was a thousand small calibrations that taught me my feelings were an inconvenience, my needs were negotiable, and love was something I had to earn and could lose without warning.

I didn't have language for any of this until my late twenties. I thought it was just how families were. I thought I was the problem.

A lot of adult children of emotionally immature parents think that. Because emotionally immature parents are very good at making the child feel like the source of conflict rather than the target of it.

I spent most of my twenties trying to maintain a relationship with them anyway. Showing up for holidays. Answering the calls. Doing the emotional labor of pretending our dynamic was normal because the alternative, admitting it wasn't, felt like losing my entire foundation.

That's another thing people don't talk about enough. Why adult children of difficult parents stay in contact even when the relationship consistently costs them. It's not stupidity. It's not weakness.

It's grief. You're grieving the parents you needed and didn't get, and staying in the relationship is a way of not fully accepting that those parents don't exist. Every visit is a quiet hope that maybe this time it'll be different. Maybe this time they'll see you. Maybe this time it'll feel like enough.

It almost never does.

Last year I started going to therapy. And I mean actually going, not the three sessions I did at 24 where I cried once and then convinced myself I was fine.

My therapist asked me early on to describe my childhood in three words.

I said, ""Walking on glass.""

She nodded like she'd heard that exact phrase before. And then she asked me something that I haven't stopped thinking about. She said, ""When you were standing at that gas station at seven years old, what did you tell yourself about why it was happening?""

I said I told myself I must have done something really bad.

She said, ""Right. Because that's less frightening than the alternative.""

The alternative being, they chose to leave. And the reason didn't have anything to do with me at all.

Back to the phone call.

I told my mother I wasn't going to come.

She escalated immediately. I was selfish. I was cold. After everything they'd done for me. Did I have any idea what they were going through. Did I not care about my own father.

I let her finish.

And then I said, ""Do you remember leaving me at the gas station when I was seven?""

Silence.

""I stood there for 45 minutes. Alone. Next to a highway. I was seven years old and I didn't know if you were coming back.""

She said, ""That was a long time ago. You were being impossible that day.""

I said, ""I was seven.""

She said, ""You always do this. You always bring up the past to hurt us.""

And there it was. The exact move. The reframe. The way the conversation about their behavior becomes, somehow, a conversation about my behavior. About how I'm weaponizing history. About how I'm choosing to hold onto things instead of letting go.

I've watched that move my entire life and I never had the words for it until recently. It's called DARVO. Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. It's a deflection pattern common in people who cannot tolerate accountability. The moment you name what they did, they turn it around so that naming it is the offense.

I told her I wasn't going to keep having this conversation in circles.

And I hung up.

My father recovered. He's fine. I know because my aunt texted me.

My mother has not called back.

I thought I would feel more conflicted about it. I don't. I feel quiet. Not happy, not vindicated, just, quiet. Like a noise that has been running in the background for thirty years finally stopped.

I'm not going to pretend this was easy or that I handled everything perfectly. I have spent a lot of years making myself smaller to keep people comfortable. I have apologized for things that weren't my fault. I have answered calls I shouldn't have answered and attended events that cost me more than anyone could see.

I have also, maybe for the first time, enforced a boundary and not immediately dismantled it when someone got upset.

My therapist says that's progress. I'm trying to believe her.

So I guess the question is, am I the jerk for not going? For choosing not to perform concern I don't have? For finally, at this point in my life, deciding that I don't owe someone access to me just because they share my DNA?

Or is there something I'm not seeing here?

1r8d01n,https://www.reddit.com/r/B2BEventMarketing/comments/1r8d01n/heres_how_to_turn_postevent_conversations_into/,Here's how to turn post-event conversations into qualified B2B leads,"You have a stack of business cards, a spreadsheet of names, and a dozen post-event coffees scheduled. But most of those conversations fizzle. Why? Because post-event follow-up is treated like a transactional chore instead of a continuation of trust.

People who showed up did so because they had context, curiosity, or a problem in mind. That context evaporates fast. Follow-ups that ignore why someone engaged at the event end up in the same black hole as an unopened newsletter.

What’s really going on beneath the surface
Attendees make decisions emotionally first and logically second. At events they feel momentum: a problem is framed, a speaker validates pain, peers nod. Your job after the event is to preserve that momentum and convert it into a clear, low-friction next step.

Most teams treat post-event outreach as hygiene: send a deck, capture leads, call the list. That focuses on volume and activity, not on relevance, timing, or trust. The psychology says people respond to timely, context-rich, and easy asks. Give them that, and they convert.

Practical breakdown — what to change right now
1) Capture context, not just contact details.
When you collect leads, capture the reason they stopped by. One line: what problem they’re chasing or what session they liked. Use that line as the lead of your first outreach. It makes the message feel bespoke and reminds them why they engaged.

2) Prioritize qualified momentum over raw numbers.
Sort follow-ups by signal: intent expressed, quality of conversation, role fit. Spend most live touchpoints on high-signal prospects. For lower-signal ones, use content-based micro-commitments like a 5-minute case study or a short product walkthrough to test interest.

3) Make the next step tiny and valuable.
People are busy. Replace “let’s schedule a demo” with “can I send a two-minute summary of how X could reduce your Y?” Small asks win. If they take it, you’ve earned permission for a deeper conversation.

4) Use content as proof, not filler.
Send short, event-tied assets that demonstrate outcomes: a one-page use case, a 90-second customer quote video, or a recorded panel highlight. These reduce risk for the prospect and provide talking points for future conversations.

5) Track show-up to the next-step as your real metric.
Measure how many event conversations lead to meaningful actions within 30 days. Not total leads, but qualified next-step show rates. That immediately shifts the team toward quality and timing.

A different way to think about events
Treat events as systems that generate relationships and content, not single moments that produce leads. The goal is to convert contextual momentum into small commitments, then scale those commitments into qualified pipeline.

This is the approach I use in practice. It’s also the mindset behind how MyWebGlory approaches event marketing — focusing on context, relevance, and staged follow-up rather than brute-force outreach. https://mywebglory.com/blog/event-marketing-playbook

If you want to raise conversion from post-event chats, start by changing what you measure and what you ask for. Small shifts, better outcomes.",1,1771443581.0,B2BEventMarketing,0,1.0,False

Been going on for around 8 years. In researching, I have thought most of the time that it has been something with the immune system as alcohol temporarily makes things all better (described below). 

I have gone down the SIBO route multiple times and been tested twice (four years apart) and both were negative all the way.

I've been doing more research lately and a damaged vagus nerve could be the culprit. Anybody else have these symptoms? Anything work for a cure?

1. Started back in 2017 after one night I did a few bumps of blow. Not a regular user at all, don't know if this is just a coincidence. 
2. I hack up frothy sputum. Basically clear spit with a lot of small bubbles. Worst in the mornings but have to clear my throat throughout the day. Most of the time is white. Sometimes first hack in the morning is brown but other than that its white.
3. Frothy sputum is also very bad when exercising or driving (weird I know). Have to hack up same nasty bubbly/frothy spit while on runs or driving winding roads.                                                       
4. Very hard to hack up at times, makes me gag a lot. Have to hack hard to get it up my throat
5. Can hear quiet bubbles popping in the back of my throat, mostly at night or in the morning.
6. Hard to drink water and makes me hack up the spit almost every drink. Drinking alcohol or coffee helps calm my stomach down. After one drink, I don’t hack anything up until morning. Drinking seems to temporarily cure everything. I don’t hack up spit and can eat whatever I want.
7. If I drink all weekend, my stomach is great and even good on Monday (even when I don’t drink), then Tuesday it goes back to being bad.
8. Slowly gained weight from 2017 even though I regularly exercise (hard cardio).
9. Feel very bloated every time I eat, unless I’m drunk. Not very hungry unless I’m drunk.
10. I urinate a lot and with not very much urine each time.
11. Symptoms gradually got worse from 2017 to now.
12. Tried numerous diets. They help lose weight but not with the frothy spit issue.

* Alcohol Free
* Gluten Free
* Dairy Free
* Meat and veggies only
* Acid Watchers Diet

1. Tried all sorts of probiotics and they didn’t help.
2. Tried atrantil and milk thistle right now, haven’t helped much.
3. Took fluconazole antibiotic thinking it might be Candida overgrowth. That didn’t help.
4. Took rifaximin antiobitc for SIBO, that also didn’t help.
5. Never had Heartburn (maybe 1-2x in my life).

I’ve loved hair and makeup for years, but I’ve never really been consistent with doing it daily. Lately I realized that even though I know I look fine naturally, I don’t always *feel* put together  and I kind of miss that feeling.  
  
My mornings are pretty relaxed: I wake up about two hours before leaving, shower, have coffee, eat breakfast, get dressed, and go. The problem is my hair (I’m growing out a perm) usually looks messy, and I leave with a bare face. Natural is totally okay… it just doesn’t feel like *me*. I actually enjoy my simple makeup routine  I just struggle to commit to doing it.  
  
I’ve been thinking about building the habit and came up with a few ideas:  
 • Setting a 15-minute timer for a quick routine (tinted moisturizer, brows, mascara, blush, lip balm)  
 • Prepping the night before  laying out products, outfit, and an easy hairstyle  
 • Low-maintenance hair options while growing out a perm (heatless curls, sleek buns, claw clips, smoothing serum)  
 • Treating it as self-care instead of an obligation  
 • Starting 3–4 days a week instead of aiming for every day

1r8cu89,https://i.redd.it/m61moz152bkg1.jpeg,Neighborhood Deep Dive: German Village - Columbus's Historic Charm,"If you've spent any time researching Columbus, you've almost certainly heard of German Village. It's one of the most iconic and historic neighborhoods in the city, located just south of downtown. As a realtor in Columbus, I get asked about German Village constantly, so I wanted to provide an honest, in-depth look at what it's actually like to live there.

# What Makes German Village Unique?

First and foremost, it's the history and the bricks. The area was settled by German immigrants in the mid-1800s, and they built a dense, walkable community of brick homes and businesses. Today, it's one of the largest privately funded historic districts in the U.S. The vibe is charming, quiet, and incredibly picturesque.

Key landmarks that define the neighborhood include:

•Schiller Park: A 23-acre park that acts as the neighborhood's beautiful green heart.

•The Book Loft: A massive, 32-room independent bookstore that's a destination in itself.

•Walkability: You can easily walk to some of the city's best restaurants, coffee shops, and unique local stores.

# The German Village Housing Market

The charm comes at a price. German Village is one of the more premium markets in Columbus. The housing stock is almost exclusively historic single-family homes, with some condos mixed in. You won't find new builds here.

Here's a snapshot of the market from January 2026:

•Median Sale Price: Around $533,000.

•Price Per Square Foot: Averaging $425, which is up significantly year-over-year, indicating strong demand for the type of homes here.

•Days on Market: Homes are selling in about 60 days on average.

The market is what I'd call ""somewhat competitive."" Well-priced homes in good condition still sell quickly, sometimes with multiple offers, but it's not the frenzy we saw a few years ago. Buyers have a bit more time to think.

# Who Is It Good For?

In my experience showing homes here, German Village is a perfect fit for:

•Professionals who want walkability: If you work downtown and want to live in a vibrant, walkable community, it's hard to beat.

•History and architecture lovers: If you appreciate the character and craftsmanship of historic homes, you'll be in heaven.

•Those who prioritize community: The German Village Society is very active, and there's a strong sense of neighborhood pride.

•People who don't need a big yard: Yards are typically small, brick-paved patios, designed for low maintenance.

# The Potential Drawbacks

No neighborhood is perfect, and it's important to go in with eyes wide open. Here are the most common complaints I hear from residents and clients:

•The Brick Streets: They are beautiful, but they are hard on your car's suspension. Seriously. It's a real consideration.

•Parking: It can be a major challenge, especially for guests. Many homes don't have dedicated off-street parking.

•Grocery Shopping: There are no large grocery stores within the neighborhood. It's a short drive, but not as convenient as in other areas.

•Cost: It's a premium neighborhood with a premium price tag, and the historic homes can come with higher maintenance costs.

•Urban Living: While generally safe, residents note an uptick in car break-ins, which is a reality in many dense urban neighborhoods.

# Nearby Alternatives

If you love the vibe of German Village but it's not quite the right fit or price point, you might consider:

•Merion Village: Located just to the south, offering similar historic homes at a more accessible price point.

•Victorian Village: North of downtown, another historic neighborhood with beautiful architecture and a slightly different feel.

# My Final Take

German Village is an incredible place to live if you value history, character, and walkability above all else. It offers a lifestyle you can't find anywhere else in Columbus. However, you have to be prepared for the quirks and costs that come with it.

1r8cu6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/PakistanAutoHub/comments/1r8cu6r/4x4_advice_greatly_needed/,4x4 advice greatly needed.,"Hey everyone. 
I hope you all are well, 
There is a vast amount of knowledge on here, so I was hoping to tap into some of that. 

I have recently moved from overseas to Karachi. I  Will be here for a year or so before I shift back. 

In that time I would like to continue my vehicular obsession and explore Pakistan and all this beautiful country has to offer (especially Northern and balchochistan depending on safety). Also to do some healthy off roading and stream crossings like in the recent Kharari 4x4 tour. 

I have narrowed down my search for a suitable vehicle to either a Hilux Rocco or GR. 

I understand there are differences within the interior in terms of seat shape, cushions and materials of the GR. Would you guys say its better? If so in what way?

I am not too interested in the monotube dampers of the GR as I intended to upgraded straight to an Iron Man suspension set up all around with light leaf springs and new shackles and bushings etc. 

Looks wise I have no need for hammer bumpers or anything like that. I really prefer the oem/original look of the hilux. Fresh detailed and ppfd and then coupled with some more capable tyres  providing a package with subtle looks and some reliable (fairly comfortable) off road/road trip ability. 

I believe the Hilux UTE is known well enough throughout the whole of Pakistan, so repairs and /or maintenance should not be an issue almost anywhere. Would you guys say thats fair?

My particular issue arises, whereby I dont want to buy new, but have a healthy budget of 1.25 to 1.35 for a Rocco and 1.4 to 1.55 for a GR. 

I visited Khalid bin Walid road, only briefly. 2 dealers, both of whom seemed shady and cars not as described. Then as we were thinking to get some coffee a man was being badly beating by 5 other men  on the opposite side of the road. 

No idea what was happening, and I hope this is not indicative of the used car dealers in general. 

I guess what I am asking for is help with 3 points.  

1. Where can I buy a decent, well looked after/loved hilux in Karachi where the mileage hasn't been tampered etc. Which to buy Rocco or GR?

2. Are there any other cars you guys would recommend that are fairly newish/reliable and easy to sell quickly in a year or so. That would fit my criteria, in a similar budget?

3. Any buying tips in general. Happy to pay for a Pakwheels inspection etc, if these are any good?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hey, sorry to make you worry, but, yes I'm fine. I had to skip town, that's why I went dark for a week. Shady looking people started hanging around my usual haunts. Could be nothing, but I wasn't going to chance it. I appreciate the offer, but I don't need my conscious being weighed down by pulling someone else into the middle of it. Better to leave it like this; unattached and excusable as some mental patient posting online. 

Closest I've ever came to a church were soup kitchens, you know? I always used to think the food in those places would be slop but it's better than the TV dinners I used to eat. Ironic, really; only started eating well after I lost everything. I'm ready to continue, either way. Where did I leave off?



Right, 001's final interview. Don and another supervisor witnessed it and were shaken by the actions of 001. Though out of amazement, rather than fear or concern.



""Holy hell, Fritz!"" the other supervisor yelled as I walked in. ""You must have some special link with 001, because that was amazing!""



""He's right, man!"" Don called, jumping up from his seat, excitedly. ""I dunno what all that was, or what it was about but, shit, it was crazy!"" I didn't say much of anything, walking in. Just stared emptily as I took a seat, completely sunken into my thoughts. ""Fritz, are you okay?""



""Huh? Yeah, yeah... just trying to process.""



""What did those pictures show?""



""I don't know. One depicted the Machine. The other two I haven't a clue.""



""So not another portrait of 001's muse?"" the other joked. ""It's a shame we couldn't submit those new ones.""



""Speaking of, what happened to them, Fritz? We didn't get a good look."" asked Don. I thought back to those sheets of crayon-lathered parchment just... trying to anchor and accept that what I saw happened. It didn't burn, it just fell away into dust. The most frightening part was the idea that he could do something like that for all those years. ""I've no idea. They were just there and then... vanished.""



""Like invisible?""



""No, complete disintegration.""



""Why would 001 do that?""



""'Why'? I'm still on the 'how'. To think he could do something like that...""



""Would have been one hell of a report. Then again, I think it already is. I'll do the paperwork for this one, Don; Gonna love telling people what happened! See ya, Fritz, good work as always."" The other supervisory walked out of the room humming an excited tune. We both nodded farewell. ""Welp, another good job, Fritz. Our employers-that-be will surely find the report interesting. Is there even a promotion you could take this time?""



""Unlikely. But who knows.""



""You're not interested in a promotion, buddy?"" I wasn't. How could I be? I was haunted by these strange happenings, by 222, 246, and after that, I would also be haunted by 001. A month's worth of nightmares. Not to mention that the strange break-ins started picking back up. No missing guns, but almost everyone's office or desk were broken into. This time, some things missing.



Folders, paperwork, ID cards, and other various tools and stationary. Security had been scrambling all around the facility for months. I believe the big wigs were breathing down head of security's neck about it, especially then. The guards were constantly rotating shifts and stations around the clock, more like a massive patrol. It's possible that what happened that day transpired due to the gaps in the patrol and the infiltration of security.

That day... No matter how much alcohol I could scrounge up over the years, I could never drown it away. That day, a large group of supervisors gathered within a supervisory room, Amanda, Don and I among them, watching Sarah interview 013 again. The supervisors had all gathered amongst themselves, talking, theorizing, discussing the answers 013 gave her.



""He's completely flipped the script,"" said Amanda, talking to Don and I. ""He's gone from interdimensional explorer to... to...""



""A zealot?"" I interjected.



""Yeah!""



""Did anything happen to cause this?"" Don asked, sipping on a mug of coffee. A cup had been gnawing at my mind since I stepped foot in the room. I don't know why I didn't just make one, almost every supervisory room had one. I'm glad I hadn't.



""Only when Sarah asked about his religion. After that, every question was answered in some conjunction with his god.""



""And you're sure 222 is his god?"" Amanda asked, glancing at me.



""It's in the file, and I still have the footage backed up."" Amanda crossed her arms and stared as the screen relayed 013's answer of his god having no desire for food or delicacies and so neither did they... to a question of his favorite kind of food. ""Do you think 222 has some... I don't know, psychic connection to certain entities?"" Don scoffed audibly at the suggestion.



""I mean it!""



""Wouldn't some of us be effected, if that were the case, Amanda?""



""What if some of us are? These break-ins could be evidence of such manipulation.""



""I think you watch too many movies, girl,"" Don laughed. ""It's not realistic.""



""is anything here realistic? Fritz, you've seen what 001 is capable of. Is mind control really so farfetched?""



And she was right. I've seen drawings get made in a nanosecond, incomprehensibly fast movement, and items turn to dust, all from one creature, no less. Was mind control so wild of a thought?



On the screen, Kazab was on a sermon while Sarah tried not to look bored. The croaking way of speaking he did only extending the speech's length. My eyes looked back at Don and his coffee. And I caved. I shot up and turned to the back of the room saying, ""I can't stand it, I need a mug.""



""Getcha sum, Fritz,"" Don responded back. sliding past the crowd of other talking eggheads, I got to the back where a small table stood with a dingy coffee maker next to a very tiny sink installation next to it. The drawers had the necessary materials to make anyone a cup. We just had to wash any that we used.



I never got my coffee. Because the seconds after I went to fill up the pot with water, my memory gets fuzzy. A series of loud pops had erupted the room followed by horrid screams, and I had instinctually dropped to the floor in a panic. Looking behind me, I saw a figure run into view from the way of the room's entrance, holding something. Before I could register the face, another sprang out and tackled him to the floor from the same direction, making him drop whatever he had in his hands.



As my mind began to properly register my surroundings, I began to shake as my breathing became rapid . Blood and bodies strewn around the floor. The faces of colleagues I've never gotten to know, burning into my mind in lifeless shock. I looked at what they dropped. A gun; one of security's guns. I heard someone yell, ""Stay down, mother fucker!"" looking over, I see a disheveled security captain, pinning someone to the ground on their stomach.



I then remembered my friends, that they were still near the monitors when it started. I clumsily shuffled my way up and hobbling over the bodies. Before I did, an intercom blared:



""Attention all faculty members. Please be aware that all containment chambers and questioning rooms have been unlocked and opened as per emergency protocols. Please make your way to the nearest exit or emergency room until a rescue team comes to your aid. Thank you.""



""Jesus Christ, they didn't...,"" came the security captain. The man under him laughing like a madman, now. I ignored him, clumsily moving my jelly-like legs, crawling to where my friends were. I saw Don as he grumbled up to a sitting position. He was gasping wildly, shirt and coat stained in spilled coffee and blood. I reached out and grabbed hold of him, losing my stability and collapsing, slightly,  before him.



""Fritz? Fuck, man, are you alright? Did he get you too?""



""N-no,"" I breathed. ""Check yourself, adrenaline might be hiding the pain. In fact, come here."" He yanked me closer by the fabric of my shirt around my shoulder and looked me over. Lightly patting various areas around my limbs and body for any entrance wounds.



""Shit, man, you got lucky. Where's Amanda?"" After asking, the look on my face must've shown that I had already spotted her, as his eyes widened moments after asking. Just a meter behind him, I saw a messy, torn up, pile of auburn hair, laying lifeless on the floor. multiple holes trickling down her back, her spilled blood slowing without the force of a beating heart.



I crawled past Don, sliding over someone's leg, until I sat next to her body and pulled her into my arms. A bullet left a messy hole beside her temple; bits of her skill shattered around it. She held the same shocked expression as the others. I just stared. And wept. Feelings and pent up emotion bursting out into a frantic, quiet sob like a hurt child.



Give me a few minutes.





...





During this, the security captain grabbed a knocked over chair and tied the man responsible in it with one of the blood-stained coats of the dead supervisors and his own belt. Don slid over next to me and wrapped an arm around my shoulder. Allowing himself to release his tears with me. I looked up at the monitor, which had a bullet in the right corner, making a large portion of it black, white, or blue. The bottom left that still showed some of the feed, hinted at an equally horrible fate for Sarah. The bottom half of 013 stood near the entrance. a set of woman's legs dangling in the air, struggling and going limp.



Then the legs move violently past 013's and off screen, with 013 walking out of the chamber. ""Mr. Fritz!"" I heard as my body shook violently. I turned to see the dirtied captain with his hands on my shoulders. I just stared up at him, possibly just as dirty.



""It's one of yours."" Confused, I turned towards the man in the chair. Sitting there, mumbling to himself in Arabic and smiling.



It was Joseph.



I gently lifted Amanda off of me and placed her onto the floor. I then pulled myself up, using the desk and made my way to him. The Captain walked alongside me, preparing to catch me if I stumble. I stood before this man, a jumble of emotions and unsure of what to do. Joseph didn't move, only continued mumbling. Then the Captain's foot kicked the chair's edge, jostling it and the one in it.



""Hey! Eyes up, shit-stain, your boss is here."" Joseph looked up, a look I've not seen on anyone else. Some sickened sense of joy. ""Mr. Fritz! You made it!"" he giggled, breathlessly. ""Allah was right about you! You are very lucky.""



""Allah? The fuck are you on about?"" I stared at the giggling fool before me until it clicked.



I mumbled, ""222."" My voice raspy and hoarse. ""I don't think Allah likes you very much, Mr. Fritz. He says you've been disrespectful to him far too much.""



""Mr. Fritz?"" The Captain asked, looking at me. ""He thinks 222 is God,"" I answered without emotion. ""Fuck me. You think your god is that abomination? I don't remember any depictions of him being a giant lizard, you fucking retard!"" The Captain's foot slammed into Joseph's chest, knocking him and the chair onto its back. Joseph gasped desperately for air. ""You killed these people for a fucking oversized gator!?""



""I do... as Allah... commands."" I see the Captain's dirty face turn red. ""You killed these people because that same lizard SAID to!?"" The Captain delivered a hard kick to the side of his face. Something cracked and blood spattered over the wall and floor. But he didn't stop. he kept kicking and kicking; and I didn't stop him. I could've. But I didn't. I wanted him to pay for what he did.



The Captain stopped and spat on the, now motionless, body. Then walked over to pick up the dropped gun, checking it's magazine and replacing it. ""For fuck's sake, Captain,"" came Don. I turn to see him trying to pull himself up the same way I did. I then noticed the holes in his left thigh. I quickly retrieved the Emergency Aid kit and began treating the woods as best I could.



""Sorry, sir. Him and those he's with turned some of my men over to their side and killed a lot of the others. It's all gone to shit, and I plan to do the same to each one. Now if you're done balancing on your high horse, Fritz, help the man to his feet, I'm contracted to get any personnel out in cases of emergency."" I looked at Amanda's body. ""Leave her, Fritz. We can't take her,"" Don said somberly. ""We'll come back, I promise.""



I nodded and helped him to the door. The closer we stepped the more I heard all the noises of horror. Distant screams, scraping, and gunfire. Hell had spilled out, and we had to brave the inferno.

1r8cqw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1r8cqw4/not_always_able_to_sleep_so_easily/,Not always able to sleep so easily,"I'm on my longest streak in years. However since the later part of 2024, I experienced some horrible insomnia from time to time, I recall back then barely sleeping for 3 days at all and juggling work at the same time.

Things have improved somewhat and for the most part since then, I've had periods of good sleep.

I'm convinced this is due largely to the SR, as I never experienced anything even close beforehand. I did have insomnia occasionally when on SR some years ago in India, when living in an Ashram, but it was never as bad as I've had it in the past year+. Now, what measures have I taken?

- Generally avoiding full on meals too late, although I get some evenings where I just can't help it, it's a mixed bag sometimes it's ok, other nights it keeps me up

- I do like spicy food with chillies, so have minimizeed that

- Make sure I'm hydrated properly by the evening, although I forget or get lax some days, so trying to be consistent. It can also make me need the toilet too much if done at the wrong times

- Meditation, I'm into Hinduism and some other spiritual things and it can help to calm the body and mind

- Exercise, if I'm honest this might be my issue, I don't get consistent exercise, I work an office job and also have a tendency to gaming and series watching etc.

- However on the above I have managed to avoid screens some evenings, which can be helpful. Trying to find the balance with this as I'd like to do some screentime. All in all it seems if I'm still awake passed 1am I start buzzing again

- General diet, mostly healthy I'd say, don't eat too much junk food, sugar and other such things. I'm vegetarian and eat a mix of grains, legumes, lentils, pules, vegetables, fruit and dairy generally. This can include hot milk, but this can make me feel very hot at times and has disturbed my sleep before 

- Reading, before trying to sleep can often cause drowsiness. However I've sometimes experienced feeling totally wide awake again after putting the book down. I can almost literally feel some sort of pulsing about my forehead when I can't sleep 

- Sauna / steam room, if done right can promote sleepfulness but my body seems to get dehydrated very easily, and I've sometimes not been able to sleep after due to extreme dry throat and feeling hot, so it's tricky. If anyone is familiar with Ayurveda or TCM, I think I have a pitta/excess heat body type

- Coffee, I often have coffee at the office, but it might be best I drop it all together. But I'm often stuck in a loop of feeling tired everyday and needing the coffee to perk me up for work. I feel kinda OK even after a bad sleep as I feel I have excess energy from the SR, but the issue is the brain fog. Also just in general, I do sometimes worry of potential health effects of so many bad sleeps. In general the most I usually get is 6 - 7 hours, I often can't seem to sleep more than maximum 8 hrs, even if exhausted the day before.

I hope someone out there can relate and or give some tips. It's been tough at times,. but I want to keep going with the SR. Some nights I just feel absolutely wide awake, when at least I think I should be tired.",3,1771443013.0,Semenretention,2,1.0,False

Those were the first words I heard from the girl I would fall in love with.

I was waiting for a cup of coffee from my local grocery store. “Come on,” she said, and gestured to follow. 

I don’t know why, but I did.

I followed her for five blocks before I told her, “I think I’m going to be late for work.”

“Shhh,” she held her finger right up to my lips. “This is going to change your life.”

The little food truck she took me to did have the best coffee I’ve ever tasted.

“You can thank me by buying me dinner, Joey,” she said.

I agreed. How did she know my name?

We were on our third date waiting for the Spin-Dip when she told me. “You still don’t remember me?”

I scavenged my mind and it hit me.

“Oh god. Kindergarten.”

“Don’t you remember? You called me Smelly Kelly?”

“I am so sorry. I was just a stupid kid. I didn’t mean to call–”

“Oh it was twenty years ago. I have held a grudge, but I think you can make it up to me.”

The spin-dip came out, and Kelly spent five minutes talking about how subpar it was. I loved listening to her go on like that. ‘Not enough garlic powder, too much onion powder. The spinach was old.’

“How do you know so much about food?”

“I’m a chef.”

“Really?”

She told me all about it. Her brief stint in a Michelin star restaurant, why she left (the abuse), all the places she worked since.

“I’m a private chef now. Work for one client. Real exclusive like.”

“What does that pay?”

“Two hundred thousand a year.”

“Shut the fuck up.”

“I’m serious. I’ll prove it.”

For our fourth date, I stood outside what must have been the most expensive house I had ever seen in my life. Behind a giant fence, were elaborate hedge sculptures, elegant fountains. The works.

“Are you sure it’s alright we do this?” I asked her.

“Come on! Live a little dangerously.”

She explained that she had funds to purchase this rich dude all his meals. She was simply going to buy enough for me too and give me a taste of super wealthy extravagance.

“But what if he finds us? Won’t you get fired?”

She looked at her watch. “He’s never here during the day. It’ll be fine, I promise.”

She opened the front door with a key, and my jaw practically hit the floor. I can’t believe people live like this. My one bedroom apartment was starting to seem depressing.

In the kitchen, Kelly began preparing me a five course meal. Her specialty, she said. She kept glancing at her watch. “The timing is important,” she told me.

She was captivating to watch. A ballet. Before I knew it, she put down a single spoon in front of me.

“Amuse-bouche,” she said. “Eat it in one bite.”

I had no idea what I was looking at, but put the spoon in my mouth. The flavors and textures were incredible. Salty, savory, with a bright hit of citrus at the end. I’m no foodie, but it was delicious.

“If I told you how much what you just put in your mouth cost, you would shit.”

I didn’t want to know.

Every course after that was better than the last. A salad with an herbaceous dressing. A cold, rich soup that was smoky.

The main dinner was some fish imported from the other side of the world. Flown all the way here just to tantalize my taste buds. The best carrots I’d ever tasted (I thought I didn’t like carrots \[how wrong I was\]).

“The piece-de-resistance!” She half-yelled. “Dessert!”

She got out what looked like a cooler, wrapped and wrapped with duct tape. When she opened it, fog oozed out. Dry ice. Whatever was in there was dead cold.

She looked me in the eyes, “This is my own recipe, with a secret ingredient, and you must eat it in one bite. It must be freezing cold, less the olfactory elements overpower it.”

She quickly spooned up a single scoop of ice cream, an off yellow, still so cold it was misting, and shoved it in my mouth. I could tell you nothing of the flavor, because it was so cold it burned my mouth.

I tried to spit it out, but Kelly used both hands to cover my mouth, and demanded I swallow it.

I did, and it burned all the way down.

“What the hell was that about,” I said, coughing from the pain.

Her watch alarm went off. “You’ll understand. Just trust me.”

A booming voice sounded from somewhere in the house, “Kelly.”

Oh god. The owner was here.

There was no time to hide. Like magic the owner appeared before me. He was deathly pale, and had two prominent incisors slipping out from his lips.

“Ahh,” he said, “my dinner is ready.”

He picked me up with one hand. Struggling was pointless. He sunk his teeth into my neck. I could feel the blood spilling out of me. As he took deep drinks, he described the meal I’d just eaten in order.

“And you smoked the leeks, yes, I can taste it in his blood. Kelly, you’ve really outdone yourself this time.”

“Just wait until dessert,” she said.

“Ah. You know I have a sweet tooth.”

I was beginning to lose consciousness when the man holding me up exploded. Putrid blood and ashes covered me. I was weak, and worse, stunk to high heavens.

Kelly helped me get to my feet, “Alright, let's get you to a hospital. You need a transfusion.”

“What just happened?”

“I hid garlic in the ice cream. Clever, don’t you think? And now we’re even for all that Smelly Kelly business.”

“Our next date,” I whispered, “I get to pick where we go.”

1r8cjoe,https://i.redd.it/79dwyy0h5akg1.png,From Desk Job to Dynamic: Simple Mobility Exercises for the Modern Man,"Imagine this: You're John, a 42-year-old software engineer. Your day starts with coffee and ends with a stiff neck, a nagging ache in your lower back, and shoulders that feel perpetually hunched. Sound familiar? For many men, the demands of a modern desk job mean hours spent sitting, leading to more than just discomfort – it can significantly impact overall health and well-being. But the good news is, simple, evidence-based mobility exercises can help transform your work day from rigid to revitalized.

# The Silent Threat of Sedentary Work

Prolonged sitting, a hallmark of many contemporary professions, is a major contributor to a range of health issues. Beyond the immediate stiffness, it can lead to chronic pain in the neck, shoulders, and lower back, and reduce overall joint flexibility and range of motion \[mskdoctors.com\]. The risks extend further, increasing the likelihood of conditions like cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and even erectile dysfunction in men \[menshealth.com, heart.org\]. Notably, research indicates men may face a higher incidence of health problems tied to sedentary office work \[nih.gov\]. Your body is designed for movement, and when it doesn't get enough, muscles can weaken, posture can suffer, and even bone mineral density can be negatively affected over time, with some studies showing specific associations in men \[sedentarybehaviour.org\].

# The Dynamic Benefits of Movement

Integrating regular movement and mobility exercises throughout your workday offers profound benefits. These aren't just about feeling better in the moment; they contribute to long-term physical and mental health. Evidence suggests that regular stretching can significantly reduce musculoskeletal pain and discomfort by up to 72% in office workers \[activtherapy.com.au, researchgate.net\]. Beyond pain relief, you can expect:

* **Improved Posture and Spinal Alignment:** Counteracting the slouching often associated with desk work \[sportandspinalphysio.com.au\].
* **Enhanced Flexibility and Range of Motion:** Keeping muscles and joints healthy and preventing conditions like arthritis \[ideafit.com\].
* **Boosted Circulation and Energy Levels:** Delivering essential oxygen and nutrients to your body and brain, reducing fatigue and increasing alertness \[drinkhydrant.com\].
* **Prevention of Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSIs):** Protecting wrists, hands, and shoulders from conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome \[ccohs.ca\].
* **Reduced Stress and Improved Mental Well-being:** Short breaks with stretching are linked to decreased anxiety, improved mood, and enhanced brain health \[nih.gov, kaiserpermanente.org\].

# Simple Moves for a More Mobile You

The key is consistency, not intensity. Aim for short, frequent movement breaks—even 1-5 minutes every 30-90 minutes can make a significant difference (\[mskdoctors.com\], \[hyperhealth.com.au\]). Some experts suggest a ""20-8-2 rule"": sit for 20 minutes, stand for 8 minutes, and move for 2 minutes \[taylordergo.com\]. Hold each stretch for 10-30 seconds, never stretching to the point of pain.

Here are some exercises you can easily incorporate:

**Desk-Based Stretches (Seated):**

* **Neck Tilts & Rolls:** Gently tilt your head side-to-side, bringing your ear towards your shoulder. Perform controlled half-circles with your chin from shoulder to shoulder. (5-10 seconds per side) \[webmd.com\].
* **Shoulder Rolls:** Roll your shoulders forward and backward in circular motions to release tension. (10-15 seconds each direction) \[fellowes.com\].
* **Seated Spinal Twist:** Sit tall, place one hand on the opposite knee, and gently twist your torso towards the backrest. Repeat on the other side. (15-20 seconds per side) \[mskdoctors.com\].
* **Seated Hamstring Stretch:** Perch on the edge of your chair, extend one leg with your heel on the floor and toes up. Lean slightly forward from your hips. (20 seconds, 3 times per leg) \[mskdoctors.com\].
* **Wrist & Hand Stretches:** Extend an arm, palm up or down, and gently bend your wrist to stretch the forearm. Rotate wrists in both directions. (15-20 seconds per stretch) \[ccohs.ca\].

**Full-Body Movement (Standing or Off-Desk):**

* **Quick Walks:** Take a 5-minute walk around the office or use stairs every hour to boost blood flow and reduce stiffness \[who.int\].
* **Hip Flexor Stretch:** From a lunge position, gently push your hips forward to stretch the front of your hip. (20-30 seconds per side) \[mskdoctors.com\].
* **Cat-Cow Stretch:** On hands and knees, alternate between arching and rounding your spine to mobilize your back and improve posture. (8-10 repetitions) \[helenhayeshospital.org\].
* **Chair Squats:** Stand in front of your chair, lower yourself as if to sit, then rise back up without fully sitting. (10-12 repetitions) \[nhs.uk\].
* **Wall Angels:** Stand with your back against a wall, slide your arms up and down like a ""snow angel"" to open the chest and strengthen postural muscles \[delawarefitfactory.com\].

Beyond these, consider incorporating strength training and aerobic exercise into your weekly routine, aiming for at least 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity and muscle strengthening two or more days a week \[nhs.uk\]. Ergonomic adjustments to your workstation, adequate hydration, and balanced nutrition are also crucial components of a holistic approach to workplace wellness \[fellowes.com, bupa.co.uk\].

# Take Charge of Your Well-being

Even small changes can lead to significant improvements in your physical and mental health. By proactively integrating simple mobility exercises into your workday, you can combat the negative effects of prolonged sitting, reduce pain, boost energy, and enhance your overall quality of life. Start today—your body and mind will thank you.

1r8cinw,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1r8cinw/the_psychology_behind_top_1_men_9_habits_that/,The Psychology Behind Top 1% Men: 9 Habits That Actually Work,"Look, I've spent years studying what separates guys who are crushing it from those who are just... existing. Read countless books, listened to hundreds of podcasts, dove deep into research papers. And here's what pisses me off: most advice out there is recycled garbage. ""Wake up early."" ""Work hard."" Blah blah blah.



The real habits of top 1% men? They're way more nuanced than that motivational BS you see on Instagram. These aren't feel-good platitudes. These are battle-tested patterns I've noticed after analyzing what actually separates peak performers from everyone else. So buckle up, because some of this might sting a little.



\## 1. They Guard Their Attention Like It's Gold



Top performers treat their attention like the most valuable resource on earth. Because it is. Your attention is literally your life. Where it goes, your energy follows, and where your energy goes, your results follow.



These guys are ruthless about what gets their mental real estate. They're not scrolling Twitter for hours. They're not letting every notification hijack their focus. They use tools like Freedom or Cold Turkey to block distracting websites during deep work sessions. They set their phones to grayscale to make them less addictive.



Cal Newport's book Deep Work breaks this down perfectly. Newport is a computer science professor at Georgetown who's written multiple books while never working past 5:30 PM. His secret? He's maniacal about protecting chunks of undisturbed focus time. The book shows you how attention fragmentation is killing your productivity and gives you a blueprint to reclaim it. If you want to join the top 1%, this book will rewire how you think about focus.



\## 2. They Obsessively Manage Their Energy, Not Just Time



Here's something nobody tells you: managing your calendar means nothing if you're burned out. Top 1% guys are energy management freaks. They know when they're sharpest, when they crash, and they structure their days around their natural rhythms.



Most high performers do their hardest cognitive work in the morning when cortisol and willpower are highest. They save admin stuff, emails, and meetings for when their energy dips. They also prioritize sleep like it's a performance drug, because it basically is.



Tony Schwartz and Jim Loehr's book The Power of Full Engagement is a game changer here. These guys trained Olympic athletes and corporate executives, and they argue that energy, not time, is your most precious resource. The book gives you specific strategies to manage physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual energy. Read this and you'll understand why some guys can outwork everyone while others are constantly exhausted.



\## 3. They Build Systems, Not Goals



Goals are overrated. There, I said it. Top performers don't just set goals and hope for the best. They build systems that make success inevitable. A goal is ""I want to lose 20 pounds."" A system is ""I prep meals every Sunday and hit the gym Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 6 AM, no exceptions.""



James Clear talks about this brilliantly in Atomic Habits. Clear is one of the most followed productivity writers out there, and this book has sold millions of copies for a reason. He breaks down how tiny habit changes compound into massive results over time. The chapter on identity-based habits alone is worth the price. Instead of saying ""I want to run a marathon,"" top performers say ""I am a runner"" and let their identity drive their behavior. This book will completely change how you approach self improvement.



\## 4. They Say No to Almost Everything



Average guys say yes to everything because they're afraid of missing out or disappointing people. Top 1% men are selective as hell. They understand that every yes is a no to something else. When you say yes to that random coffee meeting, you're saying no to deep work. When you say yes to that social event you don't care about, you're saying no to recovery time.



Warren Buffett once said his success came from saying no to almost everything. Steve Jobs talked about how focus means saying no to good ideas, not just bad ones. Top performers are ruthless about protecting their priorities.



Essentialism by Greg McKeown is the bible for this mindset. McKeown shows you how to figure out what's truly essential and eliminate everything else. The book teaches a disciplined approach to doing less but better. If you're stretched too thin, overwhelmed, or feeling like you're spinning your wheels, this book will give you permission to cut the BS and focus on what actually moves the needle.



For anyone who wants to go deeper on these concepts without carving out hours to read, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers that turns books like the ones above, research papers, and expert interviews into personalized podcasts. 



You tell it what you're working on, like ""I want to build better habits as someone who gets easily distracted,"" and it pulls from its massive library of performance psychology resources to create a custom learning plan and audio content just for you. You can adjust the depth from a quick 10-minute summary to a 40-minute deep dive with examples, and pick different voices, including this surprisingly addictive smoky one. The app also has a virtual coach avatar you can chat with to ask questions or get book recommendations based on your goals. Makes it way easier to stay consistent when you're commuting or at the gym.



\## 5. They Lift Heavy Weights



Physical strength builds mental strength. Period. Top 1% guys don't just go through the motions at the gym. They lift heavy, they push themselves, and they use physical training as a form of mental conditioning.



There's something primal about moving heavy weight that changes how you carry yourself. It boosts testosterone, improves mood, increases discipline, and gives you tangible proof that you can do hard things. Plus, it makes you look better, which affects how people treat you whether we like it or not.



If you're not already lifting, start with a simple program like Starting Strength or StrongLifts 5x5. Track your progress using an app like Strong or JEFIT. Watching your lifts go up every week is addictive and builds the kind of momentum that bleeds into other areas of your life.



\## 6. They Invest in Their Mind Like It's a Business



Top performers read. A lot. Not fiction for fun (though that's cool too), but books that expand their thinking, teach them new skills, and give them frameworks for success. CEOs like Bill Gates and Elon Musk are famous for reading multiple books a week.



But here's the thing, they're not just consuming information. They're applying it. They take notes, they implement ideas, they discuss concepts with others. Reading without action is just entertainment.



Use apps like Readwise to save highlights from books and get them sent to you daily for spaced repetition. Or try Kindle with the note-taking feature so you can review key insights. The goal isn't to read 100 books a year. The goal is to absorb and apply what you read.



\## 7. They Control Their Morning Like a Ritual



How you start your day determines how you live your life. Top 1% guys don't roll out of bed and immediately check their phones. They own their mornings with intentional routines that set them up to win.



This might look like meditation, journaling, exercise, reading, or planning their day. The specific activities matter less than the fact that they're proactive, not reactive. They're not letting emails, news, or social media dictate their mood before they've even gotten dressed.



The Miracle Morning by Hal Elrod breaks down a simple framework: Silence (meditation), Affirmations, Visualization, Exercise, Reading, and Scribing (journaling). You don't have to do all six, but the book gives you a structure to build a morning routine that actually sticks. Elrod's story is wild too. He was declared dead after a car accident, rebuilt his life, and now helps millions of people transform theirs.



\## 8. They Embrace Discomfort on Purpose



Comfort kills ambition. Top 1% men deliberately seek out discomfort because that's where growth lives. They take cold showers, do hard workouts, have difficult conversations, and put themselves in situations that scare them.



This isn't about being a masochist. It's about training your nervous system to handle stress and expanding your comfort zone. The more you voluntarily embrace discomfort, the less life's inevitable discomfort rattles you.



David Goggins talks about this in Can't Hurt Me. Goggins went from an overweight exterminator to a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and ultra-endurance athlete. His philosophy is brutal: most people operate at 40% of their actual capacity, and you don't know what you're capable of until you push past extreme discomfort. The book is part memoir, part kick in the ass. Read it when you need to remember you're tougher than you think.



\## 9. They Track Everything That Matters



What gets measured gets managed. Top performers are data-driven about their lives. They track their workouts, their finances, their habits, their sleep, their mood. Not in some obsessive way, but because tracking creates awareness, and awareness drives change.



They use apps like Way of Life for habit tracking, MyFitnessPal for nutrition, Sleep Cycle for sleep quality, and spreadsheets for financial goals. When you track something, you can't lie to yourself about whether you're actually doing it.



This habit alone will separate you from 99% of people who just vaguely hope they're making progress. Numbers don't lie. If you're serious about leveling up, start tracking the metrics that matter to your goals.



\## The Bottom Line



These habits aren't sexy. They're not complicated. But they work. The gap between the top 1% and everyone else isn't talent or luck. It's consistent execution of fundamentals that most people know but don't do.



You don't have to be perfect. You don't have to adopt all nine habits overnight. Pick two or three that resonate and commit to them for 90 days. Track them. Measure progress. Adjust as needed. Small changes compound into massive results when you're consistent enough.



The top 1% aren't superhumans. They just refuse to settle for mediocrity and they're willing to do uncomfortable things consistently. The real question is: are you?

So some heating with wood and cedar logs will create the low humidity conditions. It gets down to 62 when no one is home and up to 68 when everyone is home. Higher if I have a fire going. West windows direct after sunlight all autumn and winter. In the frost free season they get hung outside  in  direct east sun the bright indirect the rest of the day. They get no natural water from rain but I do have buckets by my rain chain  so they get nice pure water all spring and summer . I fertilize monthly 20-20-20 half strength and water when I heft the pot and it feels dry. Then water thoroughly until it runs out of the saucer. Drain after about 30 minutes and enjoy them enjoying life. The little guys I just got at Hy-Vee … kind of pineapple mango color and a red one that had red tinged clades. 

I recycle the light fluffy mix from annual pots, situated in full sun and fluffed until dry and solarised. Then it gets stored in a plastic  bagged lined box that is open at the top, in an unheated northern Wisconsin garage. I mix a cup of sand per 2-3 gallons of that fluffy stuff. A coffee filter in the bottom, a couple of green maple leaves, a thin layer of sand, plant, fill in with my mix and water well. ( the coffee filter and leaves keeps everything from running out the drainage holes until the roots stab slide the soil. )When it dries enough it gets a full strength dose of root stimulator.  After a month half strength doses of 20-20-20. This is what works for me. I’m no zygocactus expert but mine do well and if any of that helps you, fabulous.

I’m a 20-year-old film student shooting a music video right here in downtown Vancouver, and the track is the dreamy, soulful banger “Love Me Not” by Ravyn Lenae. It’s got this perfect mix of groovy drums, dreamy vocals, and emotional push-pull that screams for expressive, stylish choreography.

I’m on the hunt for passionate choreographers and talented dancers who:

•  Live in/around Vancouver (or can get here easily)

•  Have availability for an initial casual meeting soon to chat ideas

•  Are excited to collaborate on something fresh and help bring this track’s moody, romantic energy to life visually

This is a low-budget/indie student project, but it’s a real chance to:

•  Build your reel/portfolio with high-quality footage

•  Get credited + tagged in the final video (which I’ll push on socials/YouTube)

•  Network with other local filmmakers, artists, and dancers

•  Have fun creating something cool in our beautiful city!

No prior music video experience required — just creativity, reliability, and enthusiasm for the song. (Bonus if your style leans contemporary, interpretive, or has that ethereal/urban edge that matches Ravyn’s aesthetic.)

If this sparks your interest, drop me a DM (or comment below) with:

•  A quick intro about yourself

•  Your experience/level (beginner to pro, all welcome!)

•  Availability for a meet-up/coffee chat

•  Any links to your work (Instagram, reel, etc.)

Let’s make something beautiful together. Can’t wait to hear from you! 🎥💃🕺

1r8cga0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PureCycle/comments/1r8cga0/an_important_note_on_pct_inventory/,An important note on PCT Inventory,"The TOPPAN announcement dropped one week before the call. ED is giving us a soft signal that management is comfortable going into the call with positive momentum. If January had been a disaster operationally (IMO) we'd be unlikely to see a new partnership announcement the week prior. They'd save it for the call as a cushion.

By my calculations, $PCT had potentially as much as 30 million pounds of pellets in inventory entering December. 

My assumptions (feel free to throw yours out):

**Q1 end inventory:** 14M lbs (confirmed on the Q1 call)

**Q2 + Q3 net inventory build:** \~8–12M lbs (production of \~7.2M lbs in Q3 alone consistently exceeded implied sales volumes based on low single-digit quarterly revenue at \~$0.60–0.70/lb ASP)

**Q4 production add:** \+16M lbs (management guided 60–70% utilization; at 60% of 26.75M lb quarterly capacity = \~16M lbs)

**Less Q4 base resin sales:** (\~2M lbs, driven primarily by Emerald Carpets at \~1.25M lbs/quarter plus negligible spot sales, as management has been holding inventory for branded compounding  


Assuming the compounding facility came online in December, if the company were to compound that inventory at 30% that would give them **100 million pounds of total sellable compounded product** from its inventory alone.

4Q will be what it is, but this is what I would like to hear DO say on the call next week:

* “**Since the beginning of 1Q26**, the facility has produced approximately X million pounds.”
* “Compounding operations began in December and are running at Y% utilization.”
* “We have shipped X pounds year-to-date.”
* ""Average selling price for compounded product in January was approximately $X/lb""

  
Since ED joined, PCT has consistently held earnings calls early in the second month of the quarter. The February 26 date is far enough into 1Q26 to have a clean January close, and January is the only data point that actually can signal commercial-scale compounding capability. Management has every incentive to lead with the forward data if it's strong.

The warrant overhang is a binary outcome. A strong January operational print with a few new logos (coffee lids?) could supersede the 4Q narrative and enable a rerate.

For my bear frendz: If management does not volunteer production volume, shipment data, and at minimum directional 1Q26 commentary, it's a big tell.

1r8cfdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagofood/comments/1r8cfdk/prequel_cafe_is_the_neighborhood_coffee_shop_ive/,Prequel Cafe is the neighborhood coffee shop I've always wanted,"Friends, Redditors, Chicagoans. The light and warmth of False Spring has melted the coldness of my heart. My conscience is laid bare. I cannot gatekeep my favorite Chicago coffee shop any longer.

On this subreddit and beyond, I frequently see conversation centered around the search for the seemingly impossible idea: the neighborhood coffee shop that actually feels like it wants you there. I actually think we have an incredible coffee shop scene and organizations that really try to do that well. However, I rarely find a place that fits seamlessly into my rotation of ""hangout spots"". You have a favorite that you're thinking of, I'm sure. But today, I am going to tell you about mine: Prequel Cafe in West Town.

I believe a favorite coffee shop is deeply personal. We all have different things we look for. I'm in my 30s, a remote worker, artsy, and just amateur enough at cooking & making coffee to have annoying opinions about it. I don't work my 9-5 at coffee shops, but I frequent them on weekends for personal projects and to get out of the house. I like a calm ambiance, comfy vibe, and apt space to work. Of course, the coffee/offerings have to be damn good.

I don't have a specific list of boxes in mind, but if I did, Prequel would check all of them. I've actually seen chatter about them here before, and I don't have to tell you that their coffee + pastries + food are amazing. That's kind of a given. I do what to point out some things that I feel go unnoticed that are paramount to how quality they are. This stuff may not matter to you, and that's fine, but I need to give them their props.

**Whole commitment to the vision, and attention to detail.** They have two locations: one on Chicago & Damen, and another new shop on Division & Damen. The Chicago Ave location is tailored toward sitting in, getting work done, and sitting awhile. The second location on Division is smaller, and designed specifically with takeout in mind. They actually think about what they're trying to do with each location and really commit to it fully. I'll use the Chicago Ave location as the main example.

There are smaller tables, a larger table in the front, and an entire bar in the back with some more tables. The bar is my favorite place to sit. In other shops it can feel like you're banished to the bar as some sort of cramped humiliation ritual when every other seat is full. Not here. The seats are perfectly spaced - you have enough room to move your arms around without coming into physical contact with another person. The bar itself is really deep-set so you have space to lay out stuff in front of you, instead of horizontally. Each seat has a plug built in to the bar AND a bag hook (!!!!). The stools are large and have great back support. The infrastructure and design of the place actually encourages you to stay awhile. Plus, folks in larger bodies will feel much more comfortable. They didn't just put out a ton of stools to maximize space - they thought intentionally about each customer's comfort.

**They appreciate aesthetics as play, and incorporate that into their brand.** Non-brainrotted creative professional translation: they have fun with their graphic design and art direction. Yes, I am a millennial, and as such I am drawn to a nicely designed visual brand like a fly on shit. Prequel has that and more though. I can tell the owners are artists, or deeply appreciate the arts. Each location is really nicely designed with earth tones, plants, custom art, and a lot of natural light. It's just pretty and calming.

I believe quarterly, they rotate their menu and paper branding. If I haven't made it out in awhile, I actually find myself looking forward to how they've designed their menu since I last saw it. It's a small detail, but that's my favorite type of detail. They also frequently change their cardboard sleeves/paper cup designs/bag logos, etc. and I save them for my junk journal, ha. Their merch is actually something you'd want to wear and style, too. I just love this element. It's whimsical and fun. And that matters to me.

**Great food menu with a variety of breakfast + lunch options.** You get more than some outsourced food here – no hate, I love a Beacon Donut and Cafe Tola empanada. But there's something special about a place that has full control over their menu concept. They have sweet pastries, savory pastries, and bagel sandwiches. I believe one of the owners is the baker that develops all of the recipes & makes them in house. Everything I've had has been insanely good. Special shout out to the breakfast sandwich, quiches, and the chive & cheddar biscuit. I could eat like 100 of those things.

Anecdotally I think they have at least 3 seasonal drink specials going at any given time. They're always pretty unique but have a consistent palette if that makes sense? Their signature is the Brown Sugar Cardamom latte, and I'm a fiend for anything brown sugar-y/spicy/maple-y. So it matches my tastes particularly well. Their drink flavor profiles pair so well with their food. You can tell they really approach it holistically with intentionality.

The employees are all wonderful, kind, and just the right amount of attentive. The energy of the place is just really special. If you're in the area, or you aren't, this place is worth a visit. I'd say the only downside is that they close on the earlier side - 2:00pm I believe - but are open early.

Thanks for letting me gush about my favorite shop! Go check em' out!",16,1771442309.0,chicagofood,8,0.73,False

I'm 17 right now, but in a month I will be 18 years old. For context, I don't live with my father, only with my mother and uncle(my mom's brother). I feel like I'm playing minesweeper in this house irl. The most unpredictable thing can make my mom angry with me. A dish I didn't wash properly? She'll get offended. That I won't open the door for her when she comes home with the shopping because it's morning and I'm sleeping? She'll be mad all day that I didn't do it. I ask her to buy me something that is a basic need(Medications) Or just anything? She'll snap at me that she's not going to the store now (even though I didn't want her to, she'd just buy it the next time she went shopping). She blames me for having to take care of something for me, e.g. regarding my health or school. 


And I know why she does it. She's working, it's hard for her, and she comes home tired. And I understand that, and I try to help her as best I can.

He’d learned not to trust distance. Distance softened things—made rubble look like fairytale hills and graves like shadows.

He called it keeping them alive. She’d be in the armor bay about now, probably arguing with a scribe twice her age about shock absorbers no one else bothered to read.

Dogmeat sat a few steps away from the rail, pretending not to watch him. The dog had mastered the art of looking unconcerned while knowing every little emotion.

Nate thought back to the first time he stood on this deck—a lifetime ago—when the Brotherhood still felt like someone else’s legend. Back when he believed command was a straight line: orders given, orders followed, problems solved with enough fortitude and ammunition.

He knew how simple-minded that seemed now.

Leadership wasn’t a straight line. It was a ledger—names on one side, choices on the other—and he could never quite balance the numbers.

Paladin Vance’s helmet.

Flash limping out of a corridor that should have killed him.

Heather’s hands steady while the world shook itself apart.

A radiation storm rolled in like a phantom, shifting the wind. Somewhere below, Ironward would be cleaning weapons they hoped would not be needed tomorrow. Nate knew they wouldn’t be. Tomorrow was a day of celebration—his promotion—but even heavier, a day of grief for Paladin Vance.

Life kept rolling through his memories.

Nate exhaled slowly and let his gaze drift back to the horizon.

“War never changes.”

Memory didn’t arrive clean. It never did—especially with wounds this deep. It came in small waves: smells first, then sounds, then the shape of a room he hadn’t stood in for two hundred years.

Cut grass.

Warm pavement.

A hot cup of joe.

He was back in a world that still believed in tomorrow.

Codsworth floated in from the hallway with his cheerful wobble, polishing a plate that truthfully didn’t need polishing.

“Good morning, sir! Weather’s clear, the paper’s on the step, and young Master Shaun appears to be plotting a revolution.”

From the living room came baby laughter that made Nate’s heart flutter. Shaun sat in a castle of pillows clutching a plastic toy soldier. He looked up and smiled with the full, blind trust of someone who believed the world would always be there.

Nate lifted him easily, feeling the impossible lightness of him—the warm weight that fit exactly into the curve of his arm.

“Big day ahead?” Nate asked.

Shaun answered in vowels and certainty.

Nora leaned in the doorway watching them, coffee in hand, wearing that quiet expression she only used when she thought no one was looking.

Ordinary morning.

Ordinary life.

On the counter lay Nate’s jacket—clean, unscarred, a name stitched straight as if the future still cared about neatness. He had been a soldier then too, but a different kind. Parades instead of patrols. Training ranges instead of ruins. He believed nothing could come between him and this life. He thought he had done his part to keep it safe.

Outside, a neighbor’s dog barked at nothing. A delivery truck idled at the curb. The whole street sounded like it planned to stay that way forever.

Codsworth hovered closer, lowering his voice like he was sharing state secrets.

“Shall I press the suit for later, sir? Can’t have America’s finest looking anything less than presentable.”

Nate laughed.

“Later, buddy. We’ve got time.”

That stuck with him even two hundred years later.

We’ve got time.

Then the nightmare began.

Sirens—faint at first. Polite. Like a reminder someone might ignore.

Shaun crawled into Nate’s arms. Nora went still at the table. Codsworth paused mid-polish, sensors turning toward the window.

“Is that… scheduled?”

The TV flickered to a news reporter, voice breaking.

“We have… yes… confirming nuclear hits in Washington… oh God.”

The screen died in a flash.

Training woke in Nate’s bones before fear reached his thoughts. He held Shaun tighter.

“Get the bag,” he told Nora.

Outside, neighbors were panicking. The once-calm street was now chaos—people tripping, cursing, trying to outrun something they couldn’t.

Shaun pressed his face into Nate’s shoulder, hiding from a fear he couldn’t understand.

Nate stepped onto the lawn and felt the day tilt.

This was the last moment that belonged to him.

The sirens tore straight to his bones.

The hill above his neighborhood seemed too small to hold the end of the world. Families spilled toward it—people half dressed, suitcases packed with things they’d never need, a man still wearing shaving cream on one side of his face. Soldiers shouted orders that tore through the wind. Somewhere a car horn screamed and never stopped.

Nate kept Shaun tight against his chest and moved with the crowd, Nora close at his shoulder. Training kept his steps steady even when the rest of him wanted to run.

A young soldier barred the path, voice cracking under his helmet.

“Vault residents only! I need authorization!”

Nora pushed forward, papers shaking in her hands.

“We’re on the list. Please—our son—”

The soldier scanned the page, then Nate’s face, then Shaun’s clenched fist.

“Go,” he said, stepping aside. “Go now.”

They crossed the line and the world behind them grew louder, smaller. The elevator swallowed them with a groan of old machinery. Families pressed shoulder to shoulder, carrying everything they thought mattered in bags already slipping from their hands.

The doors closed.

The platform dropped.

Nora leaned her forehead against Nate’s shoulder, breathing shaking.

“We made it,” she whispered.

He wanted to believe her.

The vault taught them how to be safe the way cages teach birds how to be quiet.

White halls. Smiling technicians. Promises spoken too cleanly—like everything had been rehearsed.

“Just a routine procedure,” a man in a lab coat said, guiding them toward chambers that looked like coffins pretending to be beds. “We’ll screen you for radiation. Quick and easy.”

Nate stepped forward, uneasy humor trying to stand where fear already lived.

“Must be some new tech.”

The chamber door sealed with a soft, final sound.

Cold climbed his spine.

He knew immediately something wasn’t right.

He woke to screaming.

Not his own—someone else’s, ragged and human. Frost peeled from the glass in thin white feathers. Red lights strobed down the corridor.

Across the chamber Nora was awake, eyes wide, Shaun crying in her arms.

Two masked figures stood over her. A third man—long scar cutting across his eye—waited just behind them.

“Hand over the child.”

“No—he’s ours—”

The glass between them might as well have been an ocean. Nate pounded his fists against it, words lost in the frozen air.

“Please comply.”

A flash.

The sound was too small. Too small to end a life.

Nora folded. Shaun vanished, crying, into hands that didn’t know his name.

The scarred man stepped close to Nate’s chamber and stared through the glass like Nate was a tool on a shelf.

“At least we still have the backup,” he said.

Then the world went quiet except for Nate’s breath and the thin whine of failing machines.

He screamed until the cold took that too.

The next time he opened his eyes, the vault was dead.

Dust hung in the air like tired ghosts. His chamber released with a reluctant sigh and he crashed to the floor on legs that didn’t remember him.

Nora lay where the past had left her.

He knelt because standing felt like betrayal.

There were no words big enough, so he carried her silence instead.

Somewhere deeper in the vault a door waited to open onto a century he hadn’t agreed to live in.

Nate rose slowly.

He had one name left in this world.

Shaun.

The vault door opened like it was angry to be disturbed.

Gears older than memory ground against each other, and daylight—thin, sickly daylight—spilled through the crack like something unsure it was welcome here. Nate stepped forward on shaking legs and crossed the threshold into a new century.

The world outside had forgotten how to stand.

Houses crouched like wounded animals. Trees stood bare as wire. Even the air tasted wrong—dry and metallic, as if the sky had been left in the sun too long. Nate said Shaun’s name out loud just to hear something human.

The word had nowhere to land.

His neighborhood waited where it used to be, but it wore the wrong face. Lawns had turned to brittle paper. The road was cracked into a map that led nowhere.

Home was where it had always been.

It just didn’t recognize him anymore.

Nate walked the path he had taken a thousand times before—past the porch where Codsworth used to polish nothing, past the window where Nora had laughed at his bad coffee. Each step felt like trespassing on a life that had already been buried.

“Codsworth?” he called.

His voice sounded too small.

The robot drifted out from behind a house, paint faded, thrusters whining with age. For a moment neither of them moved, as if both were afraid the other was a mirage.

“Sir?” Codsworth said, disbelief shaking his circuits. “You’re… you’re late for breakfast.”

The joke landed on a grave.

Nate swallowed and asked the only question that mattered.

“Shaun. Did you see where they took him?”

Codsworth’s lenses dimmed.

“Sir… the world has been most… confusing. I’ve been keeping the floors tidy. Just in case.”

Two hundred years, and the house had kept waiting.

It was only Nate who returned.

He left before the walls could start talking back.

The roads taught him new rules quickly.

Water could kill. Silence could lie. Shadows moved when they shouldn’t. He learned to listen to the way wind touched a doorway, to the language of loose cans and broken glass under hostile feet. Hunger became a constant companion.

At night he dreamed of a small fist clenching a plastic soldier.

By day he followed rumors the way a man followed smoke, knowing it might only lead to another fire—friend or foe.

People spoke of monsters wearing the shapes of men. Of machines that thought they were alive. Of a place called Diamond City where the past tried to pretend it was the future.

And quieter than everything else, he heard of a small detachment of soldiers in shining armor who arrived like thunder and left like smoke.

The Brotherhood of Steel.

Nate carried the name with him the way he carried Shaun’s—carefully, as if either might break if spoken too loud.

He wasn’t looking for heroes.

He was looking for a door that led to his son.

One morning he found a radio signal bleeding through the static—calm voices holding a police station together with willpower and bullets. The message repeated like a heartbeat.

Cambridge. Assistance required.

Nate checked the charge on a laser rifle he barely remembered picking up and started walking.

His world ended without asking him.

He would find a new calling anyway.

The road to Cambridge smelled like wet copper and old rain. Nate followed the signal through streets that had learned new names for fear. Gunfire stitched the distance—short, controlled bursts answering something higher and colder. The police station rose out of the rubble like a stubborn, ugly tooth, lights flickering behind boarded windows.

Before he found the fight, it found him.

A pack of zombie-like abominations sprinted toward him. Nate fired once, twice—his weapon coughed and died in his hands.

“Great timing,” a voice called from his left. “Your gun picking today to retire?”

A woman knelt beside a half-gutted generator like she was talking it out of dying. Grease on her cheek, hair pulled back with zero ceremony. She tossed him a fusion cell without looking.

“You keep forcing it,” she said, “and you’ll be holding half a rifle and a lot of regret.”

Dogmeat trotted straight to her and sat, tail sweeping the dirt.

She finally glanced at Nate and smirked.

“Dog’s got better taste than most.”

The abominations pressed closer. She rolled her shoulders, pulled a battered laser pistol, and added, “You planning to die polite, soldier, or you want some help?”

They fought like people who understood different halves of the same language. Nate moved with old discipline; she moved like someone who survived by being smarter than bullets.

When the last abomination dropped, the station doors burst open and Brotherhood armor filled the street like walking thunder.

Danse stepped out and Nate understood immediately why there were whispers about the Brotherhood.

The power armor didn’t look worn so much as experienced. Plates of T-60 overlapped like the scales of an animal that had learned to survive cities scorched by nuclear fire. Hydraulics breathed when the Paladin moved, and every step carried a quiet confidence—like the suit already knew it would win.

Heather gave the armor a slow, professional once-over.

“Torque on those knee servos is too high,” she muttered. “And your coolant lines are begging for therapy.”

“The armor functions within acceptable parameters,” Danse said.

“Yeah,” Heather replied, “so do headaches.”

Danse took one look at Nate, then at the woman wiping her hands on a rag.

“Civilians should clear the area.”

Heather raised an eyebrow.

“Civilians just saved your hide, tin can.”

Nate almost smiled.

“Name?” Danse asked.

“Heather,” she replied. “Mechanic. Trader. Professional miracle worker.”

Danse studied Nate next—the stance, the way he held the rifle even broken.

“You’ve seen training.”

“Long time ago,” Nate said.

Danse nodded once, as if that explained everything.

“We could use both of you.”

Heather leaned closer to Nate.

“Careful. Last guy who said that tried to pay me in optimism.”

Dogmeat sneezed in agreement.

Smoke hung heavy around the station like fog. Danse moved through the courtyard counting what survived—ammo, armor plates, people. Nate helped drag a busted turret clear of the doorway while Heather argued with a scribe about power routing like the fight had only interrupted her schedule.

Danse finally stopped in front of Nate and studied him the way a mechanic studied a tool he didn’t buy.

“You didn’t run,” the Paladin said.

“Didn’t seem helpful.”

Heather snorted behind them.

“High praise from the tin priest.”

Danse ignored her.

“Why were you answering our signal?”

Nate wiped ash from his hands and didn’t dress the truth up.

“My son was taken. I’m following anything that points forward.”

For a moment the Paladin’s helmet tilted, and Nate felt seen instead of measured.

“We have a lead,” Danse said. “But we need to reach the rest of the Brotherhood. Arch-Jet Systems. It could have the transponder we need.”

He looked Nate in the eyes.

“One mission. You walk beside us, we’ll talk about uniforms after.”

Nate thought of Shaun’s name echoing in an empty vault. Thought of how far rage made a man walk.

“Point the way.”

Danse nodded once.

⸻

Arch-Jet rose out of the rubble with its windows punched blind and its smokestacks leaning. Warning signs peeled from the doors promised safety in three languages that had all died together.

Danse checked his rifle at the threshold.

“Interior will be tight. Stay on me. Don’t get curious.”

Heather tapped a pipe with her wrench.

“This whole building is curious. In the way a grenade is curious.”

Dogmeat whined at the dark and went in anyway.

Inside, the air tasted like pennies. Posters on the wall showed rockets climbing toward futures that had already been cancelled. Nate followed Danse through corridors that swallowed sound, learning how fear wore different shoes than he remembered.

The first synth stepped out of a maintenance hatch like it had been waiting for a cue.

Danse dropped it in two shots.

“Just like the readings,” he said. “The Institute is here.”

He kicked the metal body aside.

“These abominations need to be destroyed.”

The factory woke up.

Rifles cracked. Lights died. Heat rolled out of the engine chamber and turned the air into something you could cut your hands on. Nate fired until the weapon felt grown to him, until the difference between aiming and surviving stopped mattering.

Heather kept them stitched together with wire and profanity.

“Left corridor—no, your other left—if you die I’m charging your ghost!”

Synths poured in, wave after wave. Danse searched, cursed under his breath, and moved like he refused to give the building permission to beat him.

“It’s not here!” he shouted as a round snapped past his shoulder. “They moved it!”

They fought through smoke and metal until Danse finally spotted it—buried behind a scorched console like the factory had tried to hide it.

“Got it!” he barked.

Outside, the world felt colder after all that fire.

Heather leaned against a console, hair half up.

“Next job,” she said, “we pick a place that hates us less.”

Danse removed his helmet and studied Nate.

“You came for your son,” the Paladin said. “Not for us.”

“Still true.”

“That’s acceptable.” Danse nodded toward the station far in the haze. “The Brotherhood needs men who walk for reasons heavier than orders.”

Heather kicked a loose bolt across the scorched pavement.

“Careful,” she told Nate. “He’s about to offer you something that seems too good to be true.”

Danse ignored her with practiced patience.

“You’ll start as Initiate. No power armor. No promises. You earn the rest with your choices and actions.”

Nate thought back to the vault—of a small fist around a toy soldier, of a name that had nowhere to land.

“Where you point,” he said.

Danse gave a single nod.

“Ad Victoriam.”

⸻

The memory let go. It felt like a lifetime ago even though it had only been months.

Nate stood on the observation deck again with Boston spread beneath him like a map that refused to stay folded. His battle coat rested heavy on his shoulders, smelling of oil, rain, and things he didn’t dare name out loud.

Dogmeat pressed against his leg, anchoring him to the correct century.

Heather joined him with two cups and a careful expression.

“You were gone a while,” she said.

“Factory miles.”

They listened to the Prydwen hum. Below them Ironward moved through another ordinary day—Brick arguing with a scribe, Flash laughing too loud at a joke no one heard, Scope counting clouds like they owed him something.

Nate watched the empty space at the edge of the formation.

Heather followed his eyes.

“He would’ve hated this ceremony,” she said softly. “Too many speeches. Not enough problems to solve.”

Nate nodded.

“Danse never trusted days that didn’t shoot back.”

The name sat between them like a helmet on a crate.

Heather set the second cup beside his hand.

“You did right by him,” she said. “He’d be proud of how far you’ve come. Even if right felt ugly.”

Nate didn’t answer. He touched the frayed Ironward patch at his sleeve—the scar Brick admired, the story Flash said had run out of room—and remembered a voice cutting through smoke, steady as a promise.

New paint now.

Same weight always.

Footsteps approached from the stairwell—calculated, measured.

Elder Maxson stopped a respectful distance away, coat moving like a flag that chose a man instead of a country.

“Paladin Nate,” Maxson said, letting the title settle, “it’s time for your promotion to Sentinel.”

Heather let out a breath she’d been pretending not to hold.

Nate looked once more over the crooked skyline, at a world that kept surviving out of spite when it should have died.

He thought of a factory full of fire.

Of a friend who wouldn’t see the next sunrise.

Of a son’s name that had changed shape with the years.

He turned from the rail and met Maxson’s eyes.

“I’m ready.”

The Elder studied him, then nodded once.

“See that you remain so.”

Ironward waited at the foot of the stairs like a family pretending not to be proud.

Nate started down toward them.

The war hadn’t changed.

After consuming dozens of books on social psychology, body language research, and evolutionary biology, I found something wild. It wasn't confidence, looks, or charisma. It was something way more specific and ridiculously simple to implement once you understand the science behind it.

The shift? **Open body positioning combined with deliberate stillness.**

Here's what most people get wrong. They think being attractive means being animated, constantly smiling, or filling every silence. But research shows the opposite. When you hold still with open body language, your nervous system literally signals safety to others. Their brain reads you as non-threatening yet confident, which is basically the holy grail of human attraction.

**The Science Behind It**

Dr. Amy Cuddy's research at Harvard (yeah, the TED talk lady) found that expansive, open postures don't just make you FEEL more confident, they make others perceive you as more trustworthy and competent. But here's the kicker most people miss: combining that openness with stillness amplifies the effect by like 10x.

Think about it from an evolutionary standpoint. Fidgeting signals anxiety. Crossed arms signal defensiveness. But someone who can hold space calmly? That person seems secure. Your primitive brain interprets this as ""this person has resources, status, and isn't threatened by their environment."" Instant attraction trigger.

I tested this religiously for three months. At coffee shops, work meetings, dates. The difference was genuinely insane. People started approaching ME instead of the other way around.

**How to Actually Do This**

* **Stop fidgeting completely.** No phone checking, no hair touching, no pen clicking. When you're talking to someone, plant yourself. Feet shoulder width apart if standing, or sit back fully in your chair. Your body should look like it belongs exactly where it is.

* **Uncross everything.** Arms, legs, ankles. Keep your torso facing the person you're engaging with. This signals openness and interest without you having to say a word. The book **""What Every BODY is Saying""** by Joe Navarro (former FBI agent, this dude literally interrogated criminals for a living) breaks down how crossed limbs create literal barriers that people subconsciously pick up on. One of the most fascinating reads on nonverbal communication I've encountered.

* **Use deliberate pauses.** Most people rush to fill silence because it feels awkward. Don't. Let there be a beat before you respond. Hold eye contact for an extra second. This conveys thoughtfulness and comfort with yourself, which is magnetic. **""The Charisma Myth""** by Olivia Fox Cabane talks about how presence, not performance, creates charisma. She worked with executives at Google and Stanford, and her whole framework is about being fully present rather than trying to be entertaining.

* **Lower your movement speed by 20%.** Seriously. Rushed movements scream anxiety. Slowing down slightly makes you seem more intentional and grounded. Notice how really charismatic people move, they're never frantic.

**Track Your Progress**

I started using the **Finch** app to build this as a daily habit. It's a self care app where you care for a little bird, but you can set custom goals like ""practice open body language for 10 minutes today."" Sounds silly but the gamification made me consistent, which is literally the only thing that matters for behavior change.

If you want to go deeper but don't have the energy to read through all these body language and social psychology books, **BeFreed** is an AI learning app that's been useful. You can type something specific like ""I'm naturally reserved and want to master body language to feel more magnetic in social settings,"" and it generates a personalized learning plan pulling from books like the ones above, research papers, and expert insights on nonverbal communication. 

The cool part is you can customize the depth, from 10-minute summaries when you're busy to 40-minute deep dives with real examples when something clicks. Plus you can pick different voices (the smoky one is weirdly addictive for commutes). It's built by former Google AI folks, so the content quality is solid. Made it way easier to actually internalize this stuff instead of just skimming and forgetting.

Also started journaling in **Notion** about interactions where I noticed people responding differently. Writing it down made me realize how much my OLD body language was sabotaging me. I'd been unconsciously crossing my arms in like 90% of conversations.

**The Weird Part**

After about six weeks, I noticed something unexpected. I actually FELT calmer. Turns out your body and mind have this bidirectional relationship. When you physically embody calmness, your nervous system follows. It's not fake it till you make it, it's literally rewiring your stress response.

**""The Body Keeps the Score""** by Bessel van der Kolk (trauma researcher, this book won a bunch of awards) explains how our physical posture directly impacts our emotional state. Heavy stuff about trauma, but the applications for everyday body language are huge.

One more thing, pair this with actually listening when people talk instead of planning your next response. The combo of open stillness plus genuine presence is stupidly powerful. People will literally tell you that talking to you feels different but they can't explain why.

The shift isn't complicated. Your body is already communicating constantly, you're just learning to make it say something better. Stop moving so much, open up your posture, and watch what happens.

I’m 21 years old Malaysian male,turning 22 this upcoming November. Around late 2023 I came to Singapore studying diploma in culinary art, as I wasn’t really a hard working student. O levels results wasn’t good but wasn’t THAT bad as well but I decided to not go further studying on A Levels, therefore why i chose culinary.Interned at a few diff restaurants and just last year worked full time as a barista in a donut shop. Didn’t feel like staying there as i’m just living life in a circle of loop, repeatedly doing the same things and my contract got terminated due to frequent lateness to work + store manager didn’t really like me so. Recently just got employed to work as a bubble tea barista where I have to work 6 days a week( The previous job was 5 days a week with higher pay) and I’m starting to burnout.Started really regretting choosing F and B as my career and feels like it’s too late to leave the industry for now. My parents told me that I choose this route to go for therefore I have to continue it, but Im really starting to get tired of working 60 hours a week and in this current moment of time, I don’t know what do I want. So I’m leaving this here in hopes that anyone of you guys can give me any advices , such as jobs that I can go for,for someone who’s highest education Level is O Levels and past job experiences are all restaurants/ coffee shops because it’s starting to really eat me out mentally and physically.Thank you so much and have a great night to everyone",1,1771441351.0,SGExams,1,1.0,False

 anyways, i was at the metro station and a guy comes up to me running and stands in front of me and said ""hi"" in a very mesmerized way😭😭 i say hi too and then he asks me if im indian and i say yes. then he asks what i do like he thought i had a job but i told him im a student and he was basically 4-5 years older than me. 

he proceeds to ask me some more stuff about my college and where i grew up and all to which i don't think i answered. he asked if i would go for a coffee RIGHT NOW. i obviously denied😭 basically it should've ended there but after that this dumbass WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE. 

i started walking because he wasn't leaving and he started following me and this dunbfuck started touching me on the arm saying ""come on yaar let me take you on a small coffee date"" i then even told him i have a boyfriend so that it would be his final cue to LEAVE. and any normal person would do that. but guess what this dumbfuck does. 

he asks me show PROOF of me having a boyfriend he's like ok then show me a photo of him😭😭 LIKE GIRL WHAT. who tf does that. i was obviously like im not showing you anything and i continued walking ignoring him and even told him im a fucking minor he's too old to be doing this imagine how dumb he is. 

he followed me all the way to the scanner thingy of the line i was taking mind you it was a whole ass skywalk and another floor above and HE WASN'T EVEN GOING BY THAT LINE. 

before the security check i called him ""tharki"" and THAT HURT HIS EGO out of all the things bro😭😭 he got so offended by that he was like ""kya bola🤨🤨"" and then i said it louder again and he said wow you have no respect or something like that and finally left🙏🏻

seriously like it didn't occur to me to cause a scene because it was the first time someone was actually harrassing me so i didn't realise it but it was NOT okay for him to touch me and come so close to me for like 10 minutes. ",5,1771441282.0,AskIndianWomen,6,1.0,False
1r8bya7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1r8bya7/is_it_sinful_to_be_a_person_who_likes_and_wants/,Is it sinful to be a person who likes and wants solitude?,"Hi guys. 

I (24F, Married, 2 kiddos) am a VERY antisocial kind of person. I enjoy being at home. I enjoy being alone (by myself or with my family) I’m terrible with my phone and honestly don’t want to reply to anyone who messages me, besides a select few people. 

Anyways, I started going to church back in Aug 2025 and it’s been great. Everyone there is so kind and very loving. I’ve met moms around my age and a little older that have been very supportive and I enjoy talking to them while I’m there. They all asked for my number and they all have it. But again, I suck with my phone. 

Making plans to hang out is hard. I have terrible anxiety and can’t tell the difference between going for coffee and getting sent to the guillotine. 

I’d really rather not. BUT I did end up going over to one of the mom’s houses after church last week with my family for dinner. So at least I’m trying? 

Anyways the moms in this group have been friends for ages and they all seem to thrive in a group setting. Hanging out often, Bible study, dinners, texting, calling, etc… But I don’t thrive in that setting and I never have. It drains my battery almost immediately. I was added to a group chat this morning and they’re all going around chatting about prayer requests and other things, my phone is buzzing every couple of minutes and I honestly do not want to reply. It makes me uncomfortable. 

It’s not that I don’t like these girls. It’s not that I don’t want to get to know them better. It’s just the fact that I’m not a socially outgoing person. 

I don’t want to come across as rude but I also don’t want to pretend to be something I’m not. I’d rather be completely real with them than let them believe that I’m the opposite of who i actually am. (If that makes sense) 

Anyways I feel guilty about it sometimes and I’ve heard how important it is for the church to get together, so I’m over here thinking that my lack of people skills and joy for solitude is a sinful thing. Idk, this could all sound like a bunch of BS that makes no sense but that’s just how I’m feeling. 

Does anyone have any advice?

I’ve been into hair and makeup for about 15 years now casually, but never every day, and I’ve realized I don’t feel as feminine and “pretty” as I used to. I know I’m a beautiful woman, but I want to \*feel\* that way too. 

How are yall getting yourself to do your hair and makeup every morning? How early do you wake up compared to when you need to leave? I’m not a morning person, but I do get up 2 hours before I leave, I usually shower and then sit and drink my coffee, eat breakfast about 40 minutes before I leave, and then I get dressed and go. But because of this routine my hair is always looking a mess (I’m growing a perm out currently which is also making my hair worse), my face is bare (which is okay, but it’s not feeling like me anymore). I have a simple makeup routine id like to do, and I frankly just need to make myself do it.

I’m a 28M currently in Kochi, originally from Hyderabad, surviving on optimism, meditation, and well-seasoned vegetarian food.

Stats for the curious:  
• 5'8"", \~70 kg, medium lean (built more for long walks than lifting bikes)  
• Calm, sober, low-drama energy — basically human chamomile tea  
• Product designer by profession, overthinker by passion  
• Fluent in English & Hindi, learning Malayalam… slowly… like very slowly  
• Can sit quietly for 20 minutes meditating but will laugh for 2 hours at a bad pun

Personality highlights:  
• Equal mix of deep conversations and extremely silly humour  
• Will discuss meaning of life and then argue seriously about best dosa texture  
• Vegetarian — I don’t force it on others, but I *will* emotionally bond with paneer  
• Peaceful hangouts > loud chaos  
• Gives safe, non-judgmental vibes (friends say I look like I remind people to drink water)

Looking for something casual, fun, respectful — good conversations, shared laughs, maybe coffee, walks, or just existing peacefully in the same space. No pressure, no expectations, just see if the vibe exists.

1r8bpqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1r8bpqq/my_33m_gfs_32f_drinking_habits_led_to_breakup_but/,"my (33M) gfs (32F) drinking habits led to breakup, but I am second guessing everything","We were together for 10 months. During that time I kept noticing she gets blackout drunk when she drinks. Not to the point of passing out, but to the point of completely having altered personality and no memory of anything the next day. At first I chucked it off to her having recently started drinking again after 10 years of abstinence, because 10 years prior shit hit the fan with her drinking habits (late teens, early 20s). She thought she can drink safely and moderately now. So after 10 years of sobriety, I figured she doesn't know her limit. Plus it was summer, so I chucked it off to summer vibe.

But over time a pattern was noticeable. She would change moods in a heartbeat. She would go from angry to horny and back. It was impossible to keep up. She would become mean and insult me. For example, if she became horny but all I could see was a drunk woman and didn't feel like having sex, she would get mad, leave the house, throw some tantrums, threaten that there are guys who will if I wont, etc. She would also pick fights out of nowhere. One time we were about to go to sleep when she just imagined I ""was looking at some woman"" the day before and was mean about it. The whole thing was nonsense. The next morning she would have no recollection of it and would apologize and say she won't do it again.



I started telling her when sober ""I don't like it when you drink, you become someone else, I would prefer if you didn't drink like you didn't for 10 years"". She would agree that its a waste of whole day being hungover and would apologize for being mean, but claimed she has no recollection of that. These kinds of fights were becoming often.

  
After summer there was a nice period where we didn't go out as much and had less opportunity to drink. I almost forgot about that problem. But there was another problem. She was reluctant to meet my friends. Claimed she is introverted and has social anxiety. But there are a few really close friends of mine, also couples, and it didn't make sense to keep her hidden forever. 

  
One time we had friends over, she gave me a beer and had a beer for herself. Next thing I know, my beer is gone, and theres a few more bottles of beer on the table. When I said ""where's my beer? you must be drinking them in one gulp!?"" she got mad and ruined the evening with her behavior. She ignored my friends, didn't participate in activities anymore, went on balcony to smoke, etc. Cue another fight and another talk tomorrow about her drinking habits.

  
I can't even remember all those kinds of events. It became something predictable to me. I became almost immune to those fights, I was just going through the motions ""ok now she's leaving...ok now she's back...now she's yelling, now she's insulting my friends, now she's dancing and asking me to have sex...."". I started to lose patience so I would sometimes try to nip that in the bud by being rude myself.  Other times I would just read a book while she's having a meltdown.

  
One major event happened on a friend's birthday party (same friend from before). In a group of 10 people, where she only knows 2, she was the only one to get drunk. She got so drunk, her head was just hanging above the plate on the table and she couldn't talk. When we left I scolded her saying ""you embarrassed yourself and me. This is the first impression you are leaving for those people"" etc. We got into a huge fight with her classic exiting and entering the house, insulting, etc. I just tried to go to bed but she was relentless. At one point I yelled ""get in or get out, just leave me alone"" and she started hugging me and crying saying ""I won't leave you alone"". 

  
The next day and over the course of some time I kept telling her I've had enough. I do not have it in me to live another one of those scenes. If she has another drink, I am gone.

She said ""you cannot expect me never to have another drink, not even for cheers at some events."" and said I am pressuring her. Said it would be better to just leave her next time she does it than to announce it like this. Said that she can drink moderately and she will never repeat those kinds of scenes again. I said I don't believe she can drink moderately and I won't risk it. If she has another drop, I'm gone.

  
Then there was another major gathering where she, even in the morning while driving there (I'm driving), had some liquor. I was not happy about it, but I got a little soft because I understand she is under pressure because of the gathering with her anxiety and all. She had some drinks, but did not get drunk and the event went fine.

A week after that we went to another couple because they are inviting us to their wedding and she never met them. They offered some drinks, she chose wine. I watched her drink 4 glasses by the time I had one glass of beer. I started pointing it out to her that she needs to slow down and mind her drinking. She did not like that. She ended up getting drunk there.

On the way home I started saying ""you did it again. what did I say will happen if you do it again? do you want to break up? do you just want to push me to do it?""

  
She just started dancing drunkenly in the car, insulting my friends, telling me to shut up, etc. When she got mean, and knowing what's in store for me for the rest of the evening, the words ""that's it. we're done, you will take your stuff and go home tonight"" just came out of me.



She started slamming the doors, throwing stuff around the house, started saying some guy will pick her up. When I said ""I am taking you home right now"" she said ""I will leave when I feel like it"".

At that moment I just saw my entire evening in a glimpse and decided I will not live out another one of those endless traumatic scenes. I took my phone out and dialed 911. Told them ""I have a weird situation. My ex refuses to leave my house"". When she heard I'm serious, she started hitting me and kicking me. I told the cops ""as we speak, she is hitting me, hurry up"". After I hung up, she continued to kick me. I forcibly took her out of the house and locked the doors.



Then she started slamming on the doors with her hands and feet and endlessly ringing the doorbell. She did not say a word, she was a zombie. She was just kicking the doors for like 10 minutes. At that point I knew there's no going back. The whole neighbourhood is witnessing this. I started recording it for police and to share it with some people to keep me in check. There is no more ignoring this. We are not going to forget about this in the morning like always. This time there will be consequences.



Then she left and stopped the first car that drove by. It was accidentally a guy I know, but she doesn't. She asked him to drive her home. During the trip she even accused him of ""wanting to fuck her"" which I'm afraid was more of an invitation than anything. Like I said, she gets extremely horny drunk and from the stories she told me about that 10+ years earlier, many people were happy about her drinking.



Then she came back to my house and started endlessly ringing the doorbell again. Then the cops showed up and handcuffed her and took her to the station where she spent the night. I did not intend on her spending the night in jail. I thought cops will come and she will fear the authority and leave, but because they have it on recording that she hit me, it had to be jail.



The next day she called me and cried and apologized and all that. I told her it's the end, I cannot save her. I took all her stuff back to her apartment so there is nothing for her to come back for.



We met a few days later out of my weakness. She said she is done with alcohol for life, that this was a wakeup call she needed, that she will change her ways, that she is ready for a life in line with her age, that she wants to be clean, focused, have a family, etc. I said I don't think she'll change. She tried once 10 years ago and again slipped. Next stressful moment will reset her habits again, I cannot risk it. We both cried and I told her she needs to give up on me.

  
There you have it. And after all this, I am still second guessing myself, wondering if I can give her another chance, maybe she will get her act together after this.

  
Even without alcohol she was picking stupid fights, kept the house a mess, showed no real capability for responsibility, etc. We fought daily. All my friends hate her now and do not want me to entertain the idea of getting back to her for one second. I have a hard time dealing with her promiscuous past, mostly alcohol driven.

  
But on the other hand, when things were great she was a sweetheart. I never doubted her love for me, that she is dedicated to me, that she prioritizes me. I felt loved and I loved her. She's extremely funny and we could talk about anything. I loved just going for coffee with her. Lots of great memories between us. The fights she would pick could also be quickly resolved. I wonder if I didn't have the right approach, didn't support her in the way she needed. I miss her.

  
TL;DR: Girlfriend's drinking habits (or alcoholism) led to our breakup, but I am second guessing myself.",3,1771440762.0,AlAnon,3,1.0,False

Like half an hour for lunchtime at work always stressed me out. Like there is no way I can finish lunch within half an hour!

Same with coffee. Like I’ll make coffee and drink it and it can take me up to an hour to finish the coffee! It’s crazy!  When I eat alone at home, dinner may take a total of two hours!

Started this because I was tired of feeling winded after walking up a flight of stairs and my gym routine was basically non-existent. Wasn't planning on any crazy transformation or anything, just wanted to stop smelling like an ashtray and feel less like garbage. So I decided start of new year is a good time for a change, I know it is a stereotype, but like easier to track the dates from 31.12. then from random day in a year you know😂.

The first week was rough as expected – I was irritable, my focus was gone, and I kept reaching for my pocket for a lighter that wasn't there lol. But around day 12-13 I started noticing some weird stuff:

* **Breathing:** I can actually take a deep breath without that weird ""crackle"" in my chest.
* **The Gym Thing:** I actually wanted to go to the gym instead of making excuses. My cardio isn't amazing yet, but I'm not gasping for air after 5 minutes on the treadmill anymore.
* **Taste/Smell:** Food tastes... aggressive? I didn't realize how much I had dulled my senses.
* **The Morning Cough:** That gross ""smoker's cough"" I had every morning just... vanished.
* **The Money:** I checked my banking app and realized I saved enough to buy a solid pair of new lifting shoes. I didn't realize how much I was literally burning away.

Still think about having a smoke sometimes, especially after a stressful meeting or when I'm out for a coffee. But it's not that desperate craving anymore, more like ""eh, maybe I would"" and then I remember how much better my lungs feel in the mornings now.

Anyone else notice the gym thing? Like I'm not suddenly an athlete or anything, but I actually show up consistently now instead of skipping because I feel ""heavy"" and lethargic.

1r8blyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wildcampingintheuk/comments/1r8blyr/cooking_on_a_jetboil/,Cooking on a Jetboil?,"There are a couple of firemaple Jetboil-style stoves on Vinted for very reasonable prices, and a few used but very good-condition actual Jetboils for very good prices.

Has anyone tried actually cooking with a Jetboil-style stove? I understand that they are primarily just for boiling water, but I like to cook when I’m out.

I have a lot of campsite experience cooking with fire; I have very limited experience cooking “wild” with a backpacking set-up.

My average camp looks like this:

Hike, stop for a brew, hike, (if there’s a pub, grab a pint), hike, set up camp. Cook dinner, make a hot drink, sleep, sometimes breakfast, and sometimes just coffee. (Depends on if I need to leave fast or have time to relax.)

For multi-day hikes (still haven’t tried that yet), I’m planning on giving myself a wash down with a microfibre towel and some hot water (I don’t like using baby wipes for a wash; I actually don’t feel cleaner, lol).

So most of my needs are boiling water efficiently and quickly, which these systems do.

My cooking experiences so far have been:

small burner (MSR Pocket Rocker) cheap alu pans.

Boils water, no problem. Fast and works.

Cooking: very difficult to regulate temperature, just kind of get all or nothing with the burner.

Horrible to cook with, big hot spot on the pan, and no heat around the edges.

Trangia 25 with spirit burner.

So far, I’m the most happy with this set-up, not the lightest, not the heaviest, works well, but what I don’t like is getting fast direct heat when I need it.

I can cook on it, but it takes longer, which I am happy to do while at camp.

I say this experience is similar to using a crappy old electric hob, very limited heat control, and very slow to change temperatures.

Horrible for getting water fast, pans and set up is overkill to use for just water boils. Very in-efficient for just boiling water, which is the majority of my needs but not all of them.

So my current thinking is a Jetboil thing and a slightly thicker, decent alu frying pan???

Frying pan can be lost in my pack but the Jetboil or Jetboil type can be handy and ready to go in a second.

Back to OP question, has anyone tried cooking on a Jetboil or Jetboil-style stove?",5,1771440534.0,wildcampingintheuk,16,0.86,False

1r8blau,https://www.reddit.com/r/schoolfundraising/comments/1r8blau/workplace_fundraising_ideas_employees_will/,Workplace Fundraising Ideas Employees Will Actually Join,"**Blog Summary:** *Looking for fun and engaging workplace fundraising ideas? This guide explores creative, easy, and impactful work fundraiser ideas that employees will actually want to join. Learn about fundraising activities that are perfect for offices and companies looking to make a difference while building team spirit.*

If you're organizing a fundraiser at your office, we all know that the event's success is often determined by one thing: how many people show up. While raising money for a cause is important, creating an environment where employees actually want to participate can be the most challenging part. Many people have a full plate, and without the right motivation or exciting incentives, your fundraiser could be met with a lack of enthusiasm.

Luckily, with the right approach, your workplace can host a fun and impactful fundraiser that employees will be excited to participate in. We're here to help you brainstorm workplace fundraising ideas that can drive engagement, foster teamwork, and make a real impact.

Let's look at some of the most successful, easy-to-implement ideas that will actually get employees to join in and support your cause.

# Key Highlights

* Fun, engaging fundraising activities employees will enjoy
* Easy workplace fundraising ideas that require minimal resources
* Office and company fundraiser ideas that encourage team participation
* Creative ways to raise money while fostering a positive work culture
* Interactive suggestions to keep employees motivated and involved

# 1. Themed Dress Days or Casual Days

It's a universally beloved idea: themed dress days. These can range from simple “casual days” where employees pay a fee to wear jeans, to more creative and fun themes like ""Superhero Day"" or ""Throwback Thursday"" where everyone dresses in costumes or retro outfits. It's a great way for employees to express their creativity and escape the daily grind.

**How to Make It Work**: You can host these dress-up days for a special cause, such as a specific charity or community initiative. To raise funds, simply charge a small donation to participate. You can also organize themed days around different causes: a pink day for breast cancer awareness, a green day for environmental initiatives, or a pajama day for children's charities.

**Why It Works**: It's one of the easiest and most affordable fundraising activities for work. It gives employees the chance to engage in a light-hearted way while supporting a cause they care about. Plus, it's an easy way to engage both introverts and extroverts without putting them out of their comfort zones.

# 2. Charity Walks or Runs

Getting employees outside and moving is a great way to bond as a team while raising money for a good cause. Charity walks or runs are among the most popular work fundraiser ideas, combining physical activity with the opportunity to support a meaningful cause.

**How to Make It Work**: Plan a walk or run around your office or local park. Employees can sign up to participate and raise donations before the event. Offering prizes for the person who raises the most money or for the person who wears the most creative costume can increase engagement.

You could also make it a virtual event, encouraging employees to walk or run at their own pace and track their progress with fitness apps.

**Why It Works**: Charity walks or runs engage employees who value health and wellness. It's a fun and social way to raise money for charity, especially if you make it a competitive event. It can also attract employees who may not typically engage in traditional fundraising activities.

# 3. Bake Sale or Food Truck Frenzy

Food, food, food! Who doesn't love a tasty treat to break up the workday? A bake sale, like a [cookie dough fundraiser](https://bigfundraisingideas.com/cookie-dough-fundraisers), is a tried-and-true fundraising idea, but you can easily elevate it by inviting local food trucks to your office for a fun and festive atmosphere. Employees can purchase food while contributing to a good cause.

**How to Make It Work**: Employees can volunteer to bake items or donate ingredients, and the sale can be held in a common area or the cafeteria. You could also partner with local restaurants or food trucks, who might be willing to donate a percentage of their sales for the day.

For a twist, you can hold a baking contest and have employees vote for their favorite baked goods. The “winners” can be announced during the event and may receive a small prize or bragging rights.

**Why It Works**: Who doesn't enjoy indulging in delicious food, especially when it's for a good cause? This fundraiser also attracts employees who might not usually get involved, as food always has a universal appeal.

# 4. Silent Auctions

If you're looking for a more structured and impactful fundraiser, a silent auction can raise significant funds while allowing employees to get involved in a fun, competitive way. This idea works particularly well for larger companies with a generous employee base.

**How to Make It Work**: The key to a successful silent auction is to gather appealing auction items. Ask employees to donate items or reach out to local businesses for products or services that could be auctioned off. Make sure to create a visual display that allows employees to view the items up for bid easily.

For extra engagement, create themed baskets (e.g., a spa package or a “game night” bundle) or auction off experiences (e.g., a lunch with the CEO or a day off).

**Why It Works**: Silent auctions bring out employees' competitive spirit in a friendly way. They also have the potential to raise a lot of money for your chosen cause, and employees feel excited about having the chance to win something in return.

# 5. Raffles and Prize Drawings

Another simple yet effective fundraising idea is a raffle. Employees love the chance to win prizes, so offering raffle tickets for a donation is a great way to raise money. You can even make it more fun by adding multiple rounds of raffles throughout the day with different prize categories.

**How to Make It Work**: Sell raffle tickets leading up to the event or on the day of. For each ticket purchased, employees can enter a drawing for prizes. Be sure to secure a variety of prizes that appeal to a wide audience, including gift cards, tech gadgets, or experiences (like a concert or theater tickets).

**Why It Works**: Raffles require little preparation and have a broad appeal. The chance to win something tangible is a huge draw, and the entry fee is often low enough to encourage broad participation.

# 6. Office Olympics or Competitions

For employees who love a little friendly competition, Office Olympics is a fun and energetic way to raise money while promoting teamwork and camaraderie, making it an excellent option for companies with larger office spaces or for employees looking for an active way to contribute to charity.

**How to Make It Work**: Organize a series of quirky, competitive events, such as chair races, ping-pong tournaments, or relay races. Employees pay an entry fee to compete, and the winners may receive small prizes such as trophies or gift cards. You can also make this a team-based event where departments face off against one another.

**Why It Works**: It's a fun, interactive way to bring employees together. Plus, the competitive nature keeps employees motivated, and it's an excellent opportunity for them to showcase their skills or just have some fun.

# 7. Virtual Fundraising

For remote teams or hybrid workplaces, [virtual fundraising ideas](https://bigfundraisingideas.com/online-fundraisers) are a must. Virtual events allow employees to participate in fundraising activities no matter where they're located. This option is becoming more popular as more companies shift to remote or hybrid work environments.

**How to Make It Work**: Virtual fundraisers can range from online trivia nights and virtual talent shows to fitness challenges where employees track their steps or workout times. Set up a donation page (via platforms like GoFundMe, JustGiving, or PayPal) to collect contributions.

**Why It Works**: Virtual fundraisers offer maximum flexibility, enabling remote employees to participate in fundraising efforts. They also open the possibility of global reach if your company has an international workforce.

# 8. Lunch or Coffee Break Fundraisers

A simple yet effective way to raise funds is to organize lunch or coffee break events where employees can come together to enjoy a special treat while donating to a cause, which is an easy and cost-effective fundraising idea that requires little effort and is highly inclusive.

**How to Make It Work**: Employees can pay to have a special catered lunch, or a food truck could park outside the office for an afternoon. During coffee breaks, employees can donate to enjoy free coffee and pastries. Another idea is to host a ""Coffee for a Cause"" where a portion of each cup sold goes to charity.

**Why It Works**: This is an easy and low-cost way to bring people together for a good cause. It's also a great opportunity for employees to bond over shared interests and enjoy a well-deserved break.

1r8bkc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1r8bkc0/my_doctor_husband_lied_about_my_baby_to_make_me/,My Doctor Husband Lied About My Baby to Make Me Abort,"Chapter 1

Right after my prenatal appointment, I scrolled past a help post in my city’s subreddit.

“My wife finally got pregnant after all that struggle, but my sugar baby—the college student I’m bankrolling—doesn’t like the idea of me having a baby with someone else. How can I persuade my wife to terminate the pregnancy?”

The comments were a wall of outrage, but the OP liked one reply.

“This is easy. Just tell your wife the baby has severe defects and won’t survive after birth.”

I usually just lurk and watch the drama, but I still couldn’t hold back, so I replied, “You people are disgusting—aren’t you scared karma’s going to come for you?”

The second I hit send, my husband, Andrew Whitaker, the hospital’s OB-GYN department chief, walked up holding a fake prenatal report.

“Honey, our baby has severe defects and won’t survive after birth,” he said, grief written all over his face. “We need to terminate the pregnancy as soon as possible. I already scheduled the procedure for tomorrow.”

\*\*\*

When I saw Andrew gripping that report and looking devastated, the hand I’d just used to type my comment jerked hard.

It had to be a coincidence, right?

Andrew and I dated for four years and had been married for five years.

For nine years, he’d doted on me—gentle, attentive, and protective in every way.

But the year we got married, Andrew was diagnosed with severe low sperm count (male-factor infertility), and our odds of conceiving naturally were basically nonexistent.

My mother-in-law fell apart on the spot; the Whitakers had been a one-child line for three generations—she couldn’t let it end with her son.

Andrew seemed to go gray overnight.

After that, we started the long, brutal road of trying for a baby.

As the hospital’s OB-GYN department chief, he tried everything, choking down those bitter fertility meds every day and enduring so many injections that his back was a patchwork of bruises.

Every time a sperm collection failed, he’d look at me with red-rimmed eyes and whisper, “I’m sorry.”

My mother-in-law even bounced from church to church, on her knees all night, begging God for a grandchild to carry on the Whitaker name.

The night IVF finally worked and I got pregnant, the steady, unshakable man I married held me and sobbed like a little kid.

“Lena, thank you for giving me hope,” he said. “From now on, I’ll love you and our baby with my life.”

And he meant it, because he loved me and the baby down to his core.

If someone so much as brushed my stomach by accident, he’d panic and drag me to the hospital for a full workup.

If my mother-in-law’s soup was even a little too hot, he’d blow on every spoonful and feed it to me like I might break.

Baby clothes and supplies filled an entire room, and every single thing was the best he could find, handpicked by him.

A man who cared about carrying on the family line more than his own life, and a husband who treated this baby like treasure, wouldn’t cheat behind my back and try to end the child we fought so hard for, would he?

I took a slow breath and looked at Andrew, testing the waters as I asked, “Honey, could they have gotten it wrong?”

“Everything looked normal at our earlier appointments.”

Andrew let out a sigh, his eyes red-rimmed. “Some problems don’t show up until later.”

He handed me the report, pointed at a line, and said, “Look here. The baby’s heart is severely underdeveloped, and there are multiple organ malformations.”

“In a case like this, even if the baby is born, the chances of survival are basically zero.”

His voice caught, and the hand holding the paper trembled like he was in real pain.

But my eyes locked onto the scar in the web of his right thumb, and ice slid through my veins.

Because that scar was identical to the one in the OP’s profile picture.

If I remembered correctly, he’d gotten it three months ago.

I was two months pregnant then, and after one appointment, we were heading home when an unleashed big dog suddenly came at me, teeth bared.

Andrew didn’t hesitate for a second; he shoved himself in front of me and fought the dog with his bare hands.

In the end, it clamped down and tore a chunk from the web of his thumb.

Blood poured down his wrist, and Andrew needed seventeen stitches.

I’d cried so hard I could barely breathe, but Andrew just smiled and comforted me, “Don’t cry. As long as you and the baby are safe, even if this hand ends up ruined, it’s worth it.”

That scar used to be proof of love, and now it stabbed straight through my chest.

Without thinking, I reached out and brushed my fingers over the mark. “Does it still hurt?”

Andrew froze, then instinctively curled his hand back. “It stopped hurting a long time ago. Why are you asking all of a sudden?”

I lowered my gaze and said softly, “I just remembered what happened back then.”

“You were so good to me and the baby.”

Andrew smiled indulgently and clasped my hand tight. “Silly wife. Am I not good to you now?”

“Since you got pregnant, I’ve sworn to myself I’d risk my life to protect you and our baby.”

His eyes went red again, and he said with heartbreaking sincerity. “And because I want to protect you both, I can’t let you give birth to a baby who won’t survive.”

“I can’t bear to watch you suffer for ten months, then stand there helpless while your baby dies in front of you,” he said, voice breaking. “That would hurt worse than killing me.”

What a considerate reason.

What sincere words—too bad every bit of it was fake.

I met his gaze and tried one last time. “But we waited five years for this.”

“You took countless shots, swallowed endless meds, and you were willing to lose your hand to protect this baby.”

“Can you really let go of our child?”

Something flickered in Andrew’s eyes. “Of course I can’t. I’m the one who wants this least of all.”

Then, in the next breath, he hardened his face and said, “But Lena, I’m your husband and the baby’s father. I have to be responsible for both of you.”

“If this baby is born, all it will bring you is endless pain. Listen to me, terminate the pregnancy.”

“We’ll have another baby later.”

Chapter 2

I couldn’t tell whether he truly meant it, or whether his acting was just that good.

By the time he finished, Andrew was crying.

Warm drops dripped onto the back of my hand, and my whole body jolted.

I didn’t understand.

He’d always loved me, and he’d always loved this baby, so why would he cheat, and why would he want to terminate the pregnancy?

I was just about to speak when his phone rang.

The moment he saw the caller ID, panic flashed across his eyes.

He looked at me guiltily and blurted, “That’s the hospital calling. It might be an emergency.”

“Think about the baby, okay? I’ll be right back after I take this.”

He walked to the far end of the hallway and answered with his back to me, like he didn’t want me to hear.

But in front of him was a glass window, and in the reflection I could see him clearly.

As he spoke to the person on the other end, his face softened into pure tenderness.

I knew that expression too well.

He’d looked at me like that when he traveled across the country just to see me, when he stayed up for days taking care of me while I was sick, and when he knelt at our wedding and made his vows.

He used to stare at me with that same dazed devotion.

Now I knew he was using it on her.

Watching him like that made my head swim.

Andrew was famous in our circles for being the loyal, devoted husband, the kind people pointed to as proof good men still existed.

He was young, successful, and handsome, and girls were always throwing themselves at him.

Even the hospital director’s daughter had chased him openly, and she’d practically announced that if Andrew would be with her, she’d hand him the entire hospital—keys, title, and all.

But Andrew never budged, not even a fraction.

He even ended up offending her and nearly got blacklisted in the medical world.

And through all of that, he’d still looked me in the eye and said, “I can lose the whole world, but I can’t live without you.”

So I couldn’t stop wondering.

What kind of woman could make a man who treated loyalty like a religion change his heart?

What kind of woman could make him throw away the baby we’d waited five years for, just to make her smile?

While I was lost in thought, Andrew ended the call and came back, his voice steady as he asked, “Honey, have you decided about the baby?”

I gave him a long, loaded look, then nodded. “Yeah. We’ll do it your way.”

Andrew looked relieved and rubbed my head. “I’m glad you came around.”

“Don’t worry. I’ll do the procedure myself.”

“I promise we’ll have another baby.”

Hearing that made me think of the day I found out I was pregnant.

He’d promised me just as sincerely then, “Lena, I swear I’ll use everything I know as a doctor to keep you and the baby healthy and pain-free for life.”

What a joke.

The man who once swore he’d keep me and our child safe for a lifetime could now look me in the eye and plan to end our baby’s life with his own hands, all for another woman.

I didn’t want to look at his fake grief for another second, so I only said, “I’m tired. I want to go home.”

“I’ll take you,” he said immediately.

I shook my head. “No need.”

“With the procedure coming up, you probably have a lot to prepare. Go ahead and handle it, and I’ll just grab a rideshare home.”

Something flickered in Andrew’s eyes, and he said earnestly, “Lena, marrying a thoughtful, understanding wife like you is the biggest blessing of my life.”

If I hadn’t seen that post, and if that sugar baby—the college student he was bankrolling—didn’t exist, I might’ve actually been moved by the sincerity in his eyes.

But now, looking into that gaze that seemed full of love, I only felt bitter irony, because love really could be faked.

I didn’t answer, and I turned to leave without another word.

But I didn’t go far.

I went downstairs to the café, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly.

A few minutes later, Andrew changed out of his white coat and hurried out of the hospital.

I set my coffee down and followed him.

He looked almost giddy.

He walked while talking on the phone, gesturing wildly like he was announcing good news to whoever was listening.

I trailed him to a luxury condo complex near the hospital.

The second he reached the bottom of one building, a girl came sprinting out and launched herself into his arms.

The moment I saw her face clearly, my eyes flew open.

How could it be her?

Chapter 3

So that was it.

I kept thinking Andrew loved me and this baby enough to risk his life, so how could he suddenly start cheating and keeping a mistress?

It was because of her.

My breathing locked in my throat as I stared at them, and everything clicked into place.

Now I finally understood why one sentence from that girl was enough to make Andrew push me into terminating the pregnancy without hesitation.

I couldn’t bear to watch them being intimate, and I fled like a coward, rushing home.

When I got there, I sat on the couch for a long time, unable to calm down.

Her face kept flashing in front of my eyes, over and over, until I realized this was far more terrifying than I’d ever imagined.

My hands shaking, I pulled out my phone and called several people in a row.

Half an hour later, my parents, my mother-in-law, and my husband’s sister, Madison Whitaker, all showed up in a panic.

“What’s going on, Lena?” my mom asked the moment they sat down, her face tight with worry. “You called us over so suddenly—did something happen?”

I looked at the four of them and told them everything—Andrew had been cheating, and he’d tried to trick me into terminating the pregnancy.

My mother-in-law shot to her feet, furious. “That animal.”

“How could he do this to you and the baby?”

“Don’t be upset, Lena. I’m going to go teach him a lesson right now.”

My mom grabbed her arm and stopped her, then asked me carefully, “Lena, could there be some misunderstanding here?”

My dad nodded too. “Everyone’s seen how much Andrew loves you and this baby. How could he possibly cheat?”

Madison chimed in, still in disbelief. “Yeah—you’re the only woman my brother has ever loved.”

“He values you and the baby more than his own life. How could he lie to you just to please some other woman and trick you into terminating the pregnancy?”

I knew they wouldn’t believe it.

So I pulled up the photo I’d secretly taken when I followed Andrew and turned my phone toward them. “What if it’s her?”

The instant they saw the girl’s face, all four of them went pale.

“How is this happening?”

“Why is it her?”

My mother-in-law’s lips moved as if she couldn’t even find air, her eyes filled with shock and horror.

Madison looked like her soul had been ripped out of her body, the certainty draining from her face as she whispered, “So it’s her.”

“No wonder my brother wanted you to terminate the pregnancy.”

My parents went weak all at once, their voices trembling. “It’s over.”

“It’s all over.”

Chapter 4

In that moment, the way my parents, my mother-in-law, and Madison looked at me was full of despair and pity.

It was the kind of look you give someone who’s already a dead woman walking.

Just then, Andrew suddenly came home.

He was carrying a bag of warm cinnamon-sugar roasted pecans, my favorite.

Seeing my parents, his mom, and Madison all there, Andrew froze. “Why is everyone here?”

Then, as if it clicked, he answered himself, “Is it because of the baby?”

“Mr. and Mrs. Hart, I know you can’t bear to let the baby go,” he said, voice tight. “Believe me, I can bear it least of all.”

“But the baby has severe defects, and even if we carry to term, the baby won’t survive after birth.” His eyes reddened as he forced the words out. “I can’t make Lena suffer through ten months of pregnancy and then watch our child die in front of her, because that’s cruel to her and to the baby.”

“I already talked to Lena,” he continued, steadying himself. “We’re terminating the pregnancy tomorrow.”

“I’ll do the procedure myself,” he said, like he was making a vow. “I’ll make sure nothing goes wrong.”

Everyone in the room knew he was lying, but no one called him on it.

We all stayed silent.

After a moment, my mother-in-law finally spoke up, like she couldn’t hold it in anymore. “Andrew, can you cancel tomorrow’s procedure for now?”

Andrew frowned, confused. “Why would I cancel it?”

“Mom, Lena barely worked up the courage to agree,” he insisted. “If we don’t do it tomorrow and she spirals, what if she can’t let go later?” He pressed harder. “Better to rip off the Band-Aid.”

Madison was on the verge of tears. “Andrew, if you don’t cancel it, you’re going to regret it.”

Andrew looked at her in disbelief. “How would I regret it?”

“This is for my wife,” he said, almost offended. “I have no reason to regret it.”

Then he turned to me, because I’d been silent the whole time, and his voice softened with concern. “Honey, why do you look so pale?”

“Are you feeling sick?”

Looking at him with that worried face made my chest feel tight.

“It’s nothing,” I said. “I’m just scared.”

That part was true.

I just wasn’t scared of tomorrow’s procedure.

Andrew pulled me gently into his side, his voice impossibly gentle. “Don’t be scared. I’m here.”

“Once you’re in the OR tomorrow, you’ll take a nap and it’ll be over.”

No.

He had no idea what tomorrow’s surgery really meant.

My mother-in-law and Madison tried to say more, but my parents cut them off and hurried them out.

Before they left, my parents turned back and looked at me one last time, their eyes full of complicated emotions.

Andrew didn’t notice any of it, because he was drowning in his own joy that the procedure was finally happening.

He was in such a good mood he even cooked, making a whole spread of dishes he knew I liked.

That night, Andrew held me tight and fell into a deep sleep, and even in his dreams he kept calling my name.

Early the next morning, Andrew and I went to the hospital together.

Before long, I was wheeled into the operating room.

The moment the anesthesia slid into my body, my awareness blurred fast.

Through heavy eyelids, I saw Andrew in surgical scrubs leaning over me, comforting me in a low voice. “Lena, don’t be scared. I’m here.”

“Didn’t you always want to see the northern lights?” he went on softly. “Once you’re recovered, I’ll take some time off and take you there.”

“And that necklace you’ve been eyeing forever,” he added, like he was spoiling me. “I already ordered it, and after the procedure, it’ll be waiting for you.”

He kept talking about our future, and I couldn’t stop two tears from sliding down my cheeks.

There wouldn’t be a future.

Andrew, this ending was already set, and I couldn’t outrun it.

And neither could you.

The second Andrew’s scalpel cut into me, the operating room doors slammed open with a violent crash.

Right after that came a frantic shout, “Dr. Whitaker, something terrible just happened!”",4,1771440439.0,Novelnews,16,1.0,False

1r8bfel,https://i.redd.it/eh4w0fuzsakg1.jpeg,Every Transaction Tells a Story: How Unified is Turning Revenue Into Real-World Impact,"# Micky Irons: Why I Built a Humanitarian Fund Into Unified’s Revenue Model

**By** [**Micky Irons**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mickyirons/)**, Founder of** [**Unified**](https://unified.vip/) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mickyirons/) · [X](https://x.com/Micky_Ironss) · [Google](https://share.google/oAQevr9Qo8nVkgN5u)

*Unified is committing 10% of gross revenue — not profit — to the Unified Humanitarian Fund. Here’s why I made that decision before writing a single line of code, and how quadratic voting puts the power in the community’s hands.*

Most tech companies treat philanthropy like a PR exercise. A splashy donation here, a hashtag campaign there, a corporate social responsibility page buried three clicks deep on their website. It looks good in an annual report. It changes very little on the ground.

When I founded [Unified](https://unified.vip/), I made a decision before writing a single line of code: giving would not be an afterthought. It would be baked into the architecture of the business as a non-negotiable system expense. Ten percent of our gross revenue will flow directly into the Unified Humanitarian Fund (UHF). Not ten percent of profit, which companies can creatively minimise. Ten percent of *revenue*. Every pound that comes through the door, a tenth of it goes straight to the people and places that need it most.

This isn’t charity. It’s infrastructure.

There’s a quote from [Jeff Hoffman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffhoff/) — entrepreneur, NASA advisor, and Founder & President of [World Youth Horizons](https://www.worldyouthhorizons.com/) — that has stayed with me since the earliest days of building Unified: *“Your success is someone else’s miracle.”* That idea shaped everything about how I approached the UHF. If we’re building a platform that touches every part of someone’s daily life — their travel, their finances, their health — then the success of that platform should ripple outward. Not as an afterthought, not as a tax write-off, but as a fundamental feature of how the system works.

# What Is the Unified Humanitarian Fund (UHF)?

The Unified Humanitarian Fund is a humanitarian engine built into the core of the [Unified platform](https://unified.vip/). Unlike traditional corporate giving programmes that fluctuate with shareholder sentiment, the UHF is designed as a fixed operating expense — as permanent as server costs and salaries. It will activate the moment Unified begins generating revenue, with quarterly distributions governed entirely by the community.

The fund operates across four focus areas, each addressing a critical global need:

**Emergency & Disaster Response** receives 40% of the fund. When earthquakes strike, when floods displace communities, when conflict zones need medical supplies — this is the money that moves first. This is also the only category where funding can be released outside the quarterly cycle, because catastrophic events don’t wait for a voting round.

**Educational Access** receives 35%. This will fund programmes that connect underserved communities to learning — from building physical schools to deploying internet infrastructure in rural regions. The types of projects we’ll be funding include connecting schools to the internet, providing hardware and teacher training, and establishing STEM scholarship programmes.

**Healthcare & Wellness** receives 15%, targeting initiatives like teletherapy platforms for underserved regions and community health programmes in areas where access to medical professionals is scarce.

**Environmental Sustainability** receives the remaining 10%, targeting projects like large-scale reforestation with satellite monitoring and carbon offset initiatives.

# Why Micky Irons Chose Revenue Over Profit

This distinction matters enormously, and it’s one I feel strongly about as a founder.

Companies that pledge a percentage of profit retain enormous discretion over how much actually reaches the fund. Accounting decisions, reinvestment strategies, and creative expense allocation can reduce “profit” to a fraction of what a company actually earns. Revenue is honest. It’s the top line. It doesn’t bend to creative accounting.

Across all of [Unified’s](https://unified.vip/) various revenue streams, 10% of what the platform generates will be earmarked for the UHF. There will be no board vote. There will be no quarterly review to decide whether this year’s humanitarian contribution is “feasible.” It’s baked into the operating model — a structural commitment, not a discretionary one.

For users, this means that every interaction with Unified will have a humanitarian dimension. Your daily coffee run will contribute to disaster relief. Your holiday booking will help fund a school. The platform will track this for every user — showing your personal contribution, the projects your activity has helped fund, and the tangible impact those projects deliver.

# How Quadratic Voting Changes Humanitarian Governance

Here’s where Unified’s approach becomes genuinely different from anything else in the tech industry. The UHF won’t operate like a traditional corporate foundation where a small committee decides where the money goes. Instead, we’re using a governance mechanism called quadratic voting to let our community direct the funds.

Every quarter, verified nonprofits submit project proposals to the fund. The community reviews them during a two-week due diligence period, and then $UNI token holders cast their votes. But this isn’t a simple “one token, one vote” system — and that’s by design.

In quadratic voting, the cost of each additional vote on a single project increases exponentially. One vote costs one token. Two votes cost four. Five votes cost twenty-five. Ten votes cost one hundred. The formula is simple: the cost equals the square of the number of votes.

Why does this matter? Because it prevents wealthy participants from dominating outcomes. Someone with 100 tokens can either place 10 votes on a single project or spread 5 votes across four different projects for the same cost. The system naturally incentivises broad, diverse participation rather than concentrated influence. It amplifies passionate voices while ensuring that collective preference — not individual wealth — determines where the money flows.

This is a governance model with serious academic backing, originally proposed by economist Glen Weyl, and it solves one of the oldest problems in democratic decision-making: how to balance intensity of preference with equality of voice.

# Blockchain-Verified Transparency: Trust Through Visibility

Every UHF transaction will be blockchain-verified. Every funded project will report against defined milestones. The entire fund will be independently audited annually by PwC. Users will be able to view a real-time Impact Dashboard on the [Unified platform](https://unified.vip/) showing exactly where the money has gone, complete with photo and video documentation from funded projects, beneficiary testimonials, and progress tracking against deliverables.

I built this level of transparency into [Unified](https://unified.vip/) because the humanitarian sector has a trust problem — and the solution isn’t asking people to trust harder. It’s making trust unnecessary by making everything visible.

The UHF will begin distributing funds quarterly once Unified starts generating revenue. Each quarter, the community will vote on which projects receive funding, and every transaction will be trackable in real time. In the event of a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, emergency funding can be released immediately — outside the standard quarterly cycle — because some situations simply cannot wait.

# The Business Case for Built-In Social Impact

Let’s be direct: the UHF isn’t just the right thing to do. It’s a competitive advantage.

Consumer research consistently shows that people — particularly younger demographics — prefer to spend with companies that demonstrate genuine social impact. But “genuine” is the operative word. Consumers have become sophisticated at spotting performative giving. A percentage-of-profit pledge with no transparency mechanism and no community governance is, increasingly, not enough.

The UHF will give [Unified](https://unified.vip/) users something tangible: a personal impact dashboard that shows exactly how their platform activity translates into humanitarian outcomes. It will transform passive consumers into active participants in global development. And because the quadratic voting system gives users real decision-making power over where the money goes, it creates a depth of engagement that traditional loyalty programmes simply cannot match.

People won’t just use Unified. They’ll shape where its humanitarian resources are deployed. That’s a fundamentally different relationship between a company and its users.

# What Unified’s Digital Operating System Means for the Future of Tech and Philanthropy

We’re building [Unified](https://unified.vip/) as a Digital Operating System — a platform that unifies travel, finance, and health management into a single, intelligent experience. The UHF sits at the heart of that vision because I believe technology platforms have an obligation to do more than optimise for shareholder returns.

The 10% commitment is permanent. It scales with our growth. As Unified’s user base expands and revenue increases, so does the fund — which means every new user doesn’t just benefit from the platform, they amplify its humanitarian impact.

We’re not asking our users to donate. We’re not running a charity campaign with an end date. We’re building a company where impact is a structural feature, not a marketing story.

Every transaction on Unified tells two stories: the one about what you did for yourself, and the one about what you did for someone else. That’s how technology should work.

1r8bdtj,https://i.redd.it/gil0gcjrsakg1.jpeg,A working-class immigrant’s experience in the Netherlands,"This post reflects my experience as a manual labor migrant in the Netherlands. It is not written from the perspective of a corporate professional or a highly paid expat, but from someone who arrived without serious savings, connections, or a career that easily transfers between countries.

I am not trying to blame anyone, or present myself as a victim. I am not looking for sympathy, simply describing what the process looked like from the position of someone doing low-skilled manual work as an immigrant.

If someone in a similar position reads this and it helps them make a clearer decision, or prepares them better than we were prepared, then sharing it was worth it.

My wife and I moved from Hungary to the Netherlands two years ago. We had a stable life at home. I worked in oversize transport logistics, a field I genuinely enjoyed. My wife worked in retail. We were not desperate, but we believed we could build something more stable in the long run.

Housing was the first reality check.

We rented a single room next to a bar. We thought it would be temporary. It was not. We stayed there for all the two years. The house had other tenants, but the real issue was the bar. Six or seven nights a week it went on until around three in the morning. Loud bass through the walls, shouting, people arguing outside. After a full workday and roughly three hours of commuting, evenings were mostly about waiting for the noise to stop, few hours of sleep and we had to go to work again. 

We kept applying for apartments. Whenever we were invited to a viewing, we sent all documents immediately. With two minimum wage incomes and my zero hour contract, we were simply not strong candidates.

I was working at a coffee roasting company. At first I was genuinely excited. The brand talked a lot about ethics and sustainability. The work itself was physical and repetitive. Deliveries to cafés, grinding beans, labeling, folding thousands of boxes by hand. I did not mind that part.

Over time, what became harder to ignore was the internal culture. There was a strong emphasis on values externally, but internally there was constant micromanagement and communication was not always clear. Recognition did not match the effort on the production floor. It often felt like the office and the floor operated in different worlds.

I focused on moving forward. I worked five days a week and attended Dutch classes after work for months. I wanted to pass the required exams and return to my original profession. I went to interviews once my language improved, but I had no luck.

Sleep deprivation slowly started to chew us up. My wife continued working retail, but the constant fatigue and pressure wore her down. She reduced to four days a week to cope, and over time she also developed an unhealthy relationship with alcohol as a way of handling the stress.

I eventually stopped the language course because I could not focus anymore. During that period I gained a significant amount of weight and I began experiencing panic attacks. It became clear that the situation was affecting us more deeply than we initially admitted.

Before the second year, I pushed for a proper 40 hour contract. After repeated requests, signing an interim version that did not fully reflect what we had discussed, and waiting about three months, I finally received the corrected contract and a small raise. It was not life changing, but it felt like progress. The workload increased. Our living situation did not improve.

There were mornings standing on the train platform after broken sleep when my thoughts were not in a good place. We spoke less with family because it was tiring to keep saying everything was fine. Outside of work, life became very narrow.

Certain patterns at work became clearer. Advancement was not always about competence. Information was sometimes held back. Not everyone behaved that way, but the atmosphere made it noticeable.

The one thing that shifted my mental state was enrolling in motorcycle lessons. Once a week I had something that was mine. It caused some friction at work because I was no longer completely flexible, but it gave me a sense of direction again. I started training physically as well, although that left even less time for anything else.

At work, the time was slowly approaching when we should have been discussing my contract for the following year, but nothing happened. There was always too much work, never time to talk about it. I had already decided I would not put myself in that vulnerable position again and sign anything in advance.

Still, we never actually discussed the new contract. With less than a week left before it expired, I started pushing my manager to sit down and talk. He kept brushing it off, saying we would discuss it later because we were too busy.

Then, two days before my contract ended, right before Christmas, he told me we could sit down if I wanted, but not to talk about the contract, because that had already been settled. According to him, we would only be discussing the plans for me for the next year. In the office he explained that weeks earlier, while I was folding boxes and he happened to walk past me, he had casually mentioned that my contract would be renewed. From his perspective, that counted as the discussion. At that point it was clear to me that we had very different expectations about how something like this should be handled. I told him I did not consider the contract properly discussed or agreed upon. Since it was about to expire and there had been no formal conversation, I informed him that I would not be continuing after the end date. This conversation made it clear that we needed to rethink our future.

We moved back to Hungary.

I returned to oversize transport and realized how much I had missed it. My wife found another retail job with a more relaxed atmosphere.

In many ways, our life looks similar to what it was before we left. The difference is how we see it now. We appreciate the basics much more, like being able to sleep at night, feeling that our work actually matters and not being treated as cheap, replaceable labor filling a gap.

The conclusion I draw from it is that without enough money, connections, or the kind of strategic edge that competitive systems reward, moving upward is much harder than people assume. You can keep hoping indefinitely that something will change just because you work hard and persevere, but in reality you simply end up grinding yourself down slowly and quietly.

We do not regret going. It was a life-changing experience that helped us realize how privileged and stable our situation at home had actually been. In many ways, we also underestimated what it takes to build a new life from the ground up.

The Netherlands is organized, efficient, and well structured. Infrastructure works, public transport is reliable, and systems generally function the way they are meant to. There is a reason so many people build successful and fulfilling lives there. Our story simply reflects what it looked like from our particular starting point.",631,1771440055.0,Netherlands,79,0.96,False

he proceeds to ask me some more stuff about my college and where i grew up and all to which i don't think i answered. he asked if i would go for a coffee RIGHT NOW. i obviously denied😭 basically it should've ended there but after that this dumbass WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE. 

i started walking because he wasn't leaving and he started following me and this dunbfuck started touching me on the arm saying ""come on yaar let me take you on a small coffee date"" i then even told him i have a boyfriend so that it would be his final cue to LEAVE. and any normal person would do that. but guess what this dumbfuck does. 

he asks me show PROOF of me having a boyfriend he's like ok then show me a photo of him😭😭 LIKE GIRL WHAT. who tf does that. i was obviously like im not showing you anything and i continued walking ignoring him and even told him im a fucking minor he's too old to be doing this imagine how dumb he is. 

he followed me all the way to the scanner thingy of the line i was taking mind you it was a whole ass skywalk and another floor above and HE WASN'T EVEN GOING BY THAT LINE. 

before the security check i called him ""tharki"" and THAT HURT HIS EGO out of all the things bro😭😭 he got so offended by that he was like ""kya bola🤨🤨"" and then i said it louder again and he said wow you have no respect or something like that and finally left🙏🏻

seriously like it didn't occur to me to cause a scene because it was the first time someone was actually harrassing me so i didn't realise it but it was NOT okay for him to touch me and come so close to me for like 10 minutes. ",2,1771439946.0,mumbai,5,0.63,False
1r8bbwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoSinglesOver30/comments/1r8bbwz/help_save_dating_and_humanity/,Help save dating (and humanity) - story/advice/discussion/rant,"So, after getting out of a 20+yr relationship 3yrs ago (no I didn't cheat, physically abuse, or act with jealousy or controlling behaviour), I am admittedly extremely out of practice. In fact, I never initiated the dating, I just waited for a girl to make the first move, so I'm lost because there's no comparable high school scenario to meet and get to know people now. Then I try dating apps and I'm shocked to see the whole scene is 99+% bots/scammers. Then, as I expected, of the remaining \~1%, it's like <0.1% (conservatively) that a person would like and be liked, but then it appears all men are being stereotyped as ""not nice"" based on past experiences with other men? So I decided to do some ""research"" and read some of the posts in the Woman Dating sub which not only confirmed my suspicions but it seems they basically suggest a majority of woman would rather be alone than risk having a relationship with a ""bad"" guy. Doesn’t that seem like a form of discrimination, similar in spirit to racism? Don't get me wrong, I totally get how absolutely psychotic and dangerous some/most people can be (both men **and** women), but surely there is an alternative so as to not deny people the benefits of a deep connection (not intimacy). We can't all get dogs/cats. It just seems like people are so jaded by past relationships or even stories of other's relationships, that they and their friends project onto them the worst possible interpretation onto their actions. It's like being in court where everything you say will be twisted to be interpreted as negative, and then it's over before it even began. One girl shared her story of how she and her ex's relationship ended (it was rough), and I said something in an *attempt* to console her, and bam, ghosted. Lol, what? If you look at it a different way, there are so many ""bad"" things I could've said/done to justify ghosting, yet this absolutely innocent act was all it took.

In that same sub, one of the rules is literally ""*This is not the place for ""Not All Men."" Go play Devil's Advocate somewhere else*"", and it's like, are you really that jaded that you don't want anyone to be happy so you only allow negative speak of men? Wow, I guess misery loves company, but this is like groupthink fueled by confirmation bias, operating within an echo chamber that enforces female celibacy favoritism and male negativity.

I read in one of the posts there someone said something along the lines of ""men over 40 can hide who they truly are at this age for a long time"", and it's like okay, fair point, but so can women? Regardless, how do you propose we distinguish between the good/bad potential partners then, because this isn't sustainable from a species standpoint. At first I thought, well if it's the intimacy angle (understandable), then would taking that off the table for a year (or whatever pre-determined time) help? But then I thought, there are bigger issues as I alluded to above which aren't addressed by this, and since everyone lies, there is only one way I can think of to resolve it. A court approved polygraph test. Before it is shot down, it's important to note that while asking 1 question isn't definitively accurate, studies show when a person is asked 3 questions about the same topic, it increases to 85–92% accuracy. Better than nothing?

We could take it a step further and get each other's medical records if that helps? A letter from a potential partner's therapist detailing their objective opinion on the person's safety as a partner. Or even their clinical medical file and recent blood work as mental health is affected by physical health. But really, how far are we going to go here? I mean, all the above seems reasonable for later stages of the relationship like moving in with someone, but how about stage 1, just talking and getting to know each other to see if we're even compatible? This brings me to another rule in this same sub that is mind boggling. It literally shames women for grabbing a coffee or going for a walk to chat and get to know someone. I can't wrap my head around this one, because it's obviously not a safety concern if it's in a public place, so then is it a form of financial discrimination, as in buy me dinner or nothing? Kind of hard to talk and get to know someone when going rock climbing, or watching a movie, or skiing, etc. If the argument is that chatting can be done ahead of time via text or phone, no, that doesn't apply because there is no body language which is an integral part of communication, especially since you cannot interpret tone through text and this applies to a lesser extent over the phone. Case in point, my anecdote mentioned above.

At the end of the day, while asking for a polygraph or medical records seems a bit extreme, isn't avoiding relationships altogether similarly excessive? Can we not discuss and brainstorm ways to resolve this issue rather than leave it as is? Would the above not be a viable solution to remove/reduce some of the fear/anxiety around dating, or are there any other suggestions? While handing over all this information to every potential partner seems like a serious data privacy issue, perhaps a dating 3rd party that acts as an intermediary between the two parties and confirms the facts (ie. no psychiatric meds) is what is required. Potential business opportunity for any venture capitalist?

The working week is almost over (yay!) and it feels like now is the perfect time to begin my quest to find someone new to hopefully start building something with throughout the weekend and beyond!

I’m 34, male and from the UK. London to be a little more precise! I work as an aircraft engineer. I know this isn’t the most interesting job in the world, but it does allow me to travel a fair bit.  

Random info about me - I’m convinced I’ll eventually die due to one of the Big 3 Cs: coffee, cheese, or chocolate. No regrets, honestly! Away from that, in terms of hobbies I like the following:

- Travel (I get great travel benefits because of my job, so this is always something that I try to make the most).
- Keeping fit and healthy (I do find this a bit of a chore, but it definitely helps me stay mentally positive!).
- Visiting new restaurants and other places to eat (This is something I absolutely love doing. Trying dishes from different cultures is probably my number one ambition in life!)
- Theme parks (There are some great ones in Europe, but one day I dream of visiting some of the American parks too!)

I think that will do for now…If you think that I’m maybe worth a message, then please feel free to drop me one.

1r8bbct,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagoapartments/comments/1r8bbct/renter_beware_tenants_at_upshore_residences_form/,Renter Beware: Tenants at Upshore Residences form union after building's $39M loan default comes to light and foreclosure looms,"I am a current resident and I need prospective renters to know what they are walking into before they sign a lease here. This is long but every word is relevant. Grab a coffee.

**The tl;dr**

If you are searching for apartments in Uptown Chicago and this building came up in your search: do not sign a lease at Upshore Residences or Upshore Chapter until this situation resolves. Financial instability, four management companies in three years, documented retaliation, hostile management, a pattern of targeting vulnerable residents, and suppressed reviews are not a foundation for a home.

If you are a current resident at 4555 N Sheridan: we have a tenant union. Find us. Chicago's RLTO is one of the strongest tenant protection laws in the country and you have more rights than Willow Bridge wants you to know about.

We are organized, we are growing daily; this is our home and we're not going anywhere.

**The revolving door of management**

Since August 2023 this building has had FOUR different property management companies. Four. In less than three years. That alone should tell you everything, but let me continue.

The latest, Willow Bridge Property Management, took over on January 7, 2026. Within weeks: trash rooms overflowing, the front door FOB system broken and being phased out entirely, leaving residents with no reliable way to enter their own building. During the coldest week of the year, with wind chills hitting -40 degrees, tenants were locked out at all hours hoping security would eventually let them in. In a neighborhood with multiple mental health and drug rehab facilities on the same block, being stranded outside at 2am in those temperatures is not an inconvenience. It is a safety crisis. Maintenance requests go unanswered. The dog run is smeared with feces and unusable by residents.

**The building is headed toward foreclosure**

The developer, CRG, has been delinquent on a $39 million loan since August 2024. Which explains why our building lost gas service for a week. Neither the owner nor the managers were paying bills. They tried to sell the building in 2023 and couldn't find a buyer. The loan matured in October 2024 and was moved to special servicer Situs Holdings. This is a building where corporate ownership is actively trying to cut costs on a failing investment and residents are paying the price.

**Management is hostile and inaccessible**

Since Willow Bridge arrived, the new on-site manager, Catherine, has made herself largely unavailable to residents, remaining behind a closed office door rather than engaging with legitimate concerns. When residents do manage to get a response, multiple tenants have reported that complaints are met not with solutions but with aggressive and verbally abusive behavior. This is not a management team that views residents as people to be served. Their strategy appears to be harassment and intimidation as a substitute for accountability.

**A pattern of targeting specific residents has developed**

We have observed a concerning pattern in which the residents who appear to be on the receiving end of management's most aggressive behavior are disproportionately Black and LGBTQ+ residents. We are documenting these incidents carefully.

The most recent example: a resident was in the rooftop skylounge, a common amenity available to all tenants, when management sent a security guard up to inform him he was no longer permitted to use the space. No explanation was given. No lease violation was cited. Just a security guard delivering a message that a paying tenant was suddenly unwelcome in his own building's common area. The resident had been having his nails done. Management couldn't be bothered to come up herself or provide any reason whatsoever. Just intimidation, delivered by proxy.

If you are a prospective renter and fair housing and an inclusive environment matter to you, this pattern should be disqualifying.

**They retaliated against organizing tenants**

When residents began organizing and I distributed a letter to all 149 units suggesting collective action, Willow Bridge's response was not to fix the trash or the doors.

First, four days after the letter went out, I was informed that the lease I had signed with the previous management company in December had suddenly ""gone missing"" and that I would need to re-sign a new lease with Willow Bridge or vacate. I have forwarded that matter to my attorney.

Then, rather than address me directly, the building manager had Willow Bridge's lawyer send me an email in response to the organizing letter. Not to tell me to stop. Just vague promises that things would be better at some undetermined future date. This is consistent with how management operates here: the building manager will not engage with residents directly, will not come out of her office, and will not handle conflict herself. She sends lawyers and security guards instead.

Under Chicago's Residential Landlord and Tenant Ordinance (RLTO), forming a tenant union is explicitly protected activity and retaliation within one year creates a legal presumption of unlawful conduct. We have attorneys involved.

**They are suppressing Google reviews**

Residents have been leaving one-star reviews documenting real conditions at this Uptown Chicago apartment building. This week those reviews disappeared. All of them. And here's the kicker: in response, a neighbor who had been watching from the sidelines joined our tenant union specifically because of it. Every petty move they make recruits someone new.

**They changed the building's name to bury the reviews**

The building opened in 2019 as Upshore Chapter. It is now being marketed as Upshore Residences at 4555 N Sheridan Road, Uptown Chicago. If you are searching for reviews of this building, search BOTH names. This appears to be a deliberate attempt to bury negative feedback under a fresh coat of branding.",36,1771439909.0,chicagoapartments,2,0.98,False

1r8b9kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1r8b9kp/my_mom_turns_into_a_worm_when_she_cries/,My Mom Turns Into A Worm When She Cries,"The State of Massachusetts by Dropkick Murphy blares from every speaker in the Toyota Tacoma, and I avert my eyes from my mom's cheerful amusement. I can see her in the rearview mirror, singing and drumming on the top of the steering wheel, and I turn away to gawk at the blue paint on the outside of the truck and the blurry images of passing woodlands. We have been driving this good ole boy around for almost twenty years now that I know of. It’s me, Nick, my older brother, my mom, Syd, and our dog D. Breeze. D sat in the back seat with me and half of our luggage and all our belongings. D’s  big droopy face hung out the window, his cheeks flung back, and his tongue panting to the side. I reached my hand over the boxes between us and scratched his velvet hide. D was a big dog, and the only reason he fit in this truck was that he was only 6 months old, his entire body already taking up half the back of the seat. 

Syd is an oddly cheery woman and has been since I’ve known her, at least. Even after dad died and we turned into what she calls ‘free spirits, ’ she is still wonderfully positive about everything. Syd can’t keep it together most of the time, and we move around a lot, which we are doing right now. Town to town, city to city, sometimes just county to county. We were just always moving. Everything was always in a rush, too, like the world was on fire. I gotta give her some credit, we make it almost a year in most places. Then something tragic happens, and I watch Syd and Nick run around all frantically getting our apartment, trailer, duplex, all packed up, and then we were out the door as soon as we could grab as much as we could. The only consistent thing that stayed with us so far was Mr. D. He’s only been around for six months. I’m not mad at my mom. I love her more than anything. But how can I really be anything other than worried for her? My mom was a very private woman when Dad was around. She happily hung around the family most days, but then she’d get hit with some kind of mental dilemma, and she would disappear for days at a time inside her room. With dad gone, helping Syd with her mental health and financial support, we had to turn to odd, weird jobs here and there wherever we landed. Then it only took one bad thing to happen for us to sprint away. It was weird too, every time we moved, I never knew the reason, and no one has told me why. Nick knows. Mom told him a long time ago why we move so frequently and never get to know anyone. 

We had driven for days until we hit our first destination. Some washed-up, piece of shit, one-hitter motel.  My mom babbled happily along to the clerk as she pulled out crinkled wads of cash. We were never living in a place long enough to get set up with what my mom calls ‘money scammers, ’ so electronic payment was never an option for us. She kept up the chatter for what felt like forever before trudging us up to the second balcony of the broken-down establishment. I looked down at a corner room where I saw a lovely woman, in a skimpy dress, stiletto heels, take a big wad of cash, all bundled up tightly, from some happy looking mother fucker half dressed. The exchange was over, and the man disappeared, and I watched the young woman take off her heels and then wait for her ride. I didn’t get to see who picked her up before we got to our two queen room. Once we put down everything we had already carried up, we went back down for a second, third, and fourth load. If it wasn’t locked in the room with us, it was locked inside the truck. When everything was settled for the night, I watched Nick disappear into the bathroom, and Syd sat cross-legged on the bed closest to the door flipping through the provided channels. 

The next morning, first thing: getting money. Syd took Nick and me downstairs to the manager’s little hidey hole that could only hold a desk and a chair. Nick and I waited outside the office for an hour while Syd spoke and spoke, on and on, to the manager. Our new employer, Kim, was showing all of us to the work center, which was a closet next to her office. I looked at all the cleaning supplies and knew my mom had sold me for cheap labor. Nick and I always got caught in my mom's scams. Crazy enough, believe it or not, the first room we went to clean was that corner room that I happened to watch just the other day. I shuddered as I picked up stained sheets and watched as discolored lace panties fell out of the bundle and onto the floor. I looked down at the undergarment and felt more relief than disgust. I just knew it didn't matter how low we got in life, Syd never resorted to things like that. I have watched her sell a piece of furniture she refinished from the dump to some chump for hundreds of dollars. She got away with this with her ‘authentic letter’ provided with the rare ‘antique’. Syd was clever like that and quick on her feet. 

When Syd wasn't making us money, however, she kept herself locked in the bathroom. If we had to use it, we had to find another one that wasn't already in use. She used to do it when Dad was alive, and the habit still clung to her now. Just disappearing sometimes for days at a time into one secluded location. Always alone. At first, I was ignorant of why she was in there, but then I began to hear the crying and knew that my mother was finally taking down the charade and taking in her reality as it was. Removing the weight and letting it fall to the floor with a huge thud. I let her be. I never asked about it further. I just assumed Syd was kind of depressed. I felt bad for her, but more than anything, I was concerned for her. She never let me in. I would sometimes see Nick enter the bathroom. I could hear him talking to her, but I could never hear the replies. When he would leave, he would inch out of a crack in the door and always run into me. I would stare up at him, always waiting for an answer, and always, he pushed past me with nothing to give. We cleaned at that motel for a few days, and I began to pick up on the locals' routine around here. 

There was a brief guy, the old man who came out of 1C with his cup of coffee and his whitey tighties. A little newspaper kid comes around here in his beat-up rusted Corolla and gives the old man a rounded-up paper, and the balding man takes it, taps it against his white-haired chest in salute, and walks back into his room every morning at six a.m. Then, there was the woman I named Linda. She is a frequent visitor to 9G, the corner room downstairs. Always the same skimpy dress and stilts, walking in with a different guy each time. She always came around at 9 or 10 in the morning. Watching her, I got the sense we all had our repetitive motions: her ritual visits, my family’s endless moves, looping circles like tapes stuck on the same song. Then there was Carl. That was actually his name. He starts at the office at 5 in the morning with his little hand weights and his sweat suit, and he speed walks the entire motel all morning, chatting up everyone he runs into. When you talk to him, he is always jogging in place, and you can always watch the small lift and fall of his blonde toupee as his steps go up and down in rapid moments. I don't know what the exercise was doing for him; I never saw his beer belly lift even an inch since I saw him. Sometimes I wonder if Carl is running from something too, circling the building over and over but never quite escaping. I watched the waistband grow, however, and I think the poor man just needs to work on his diet.

Nick took the truck every day to a few jobs he could catch in the nearest town, which was miles away. One day, he came back from some kind of weird job that paid him 500 dollars. He told Syd and me that all they did was inject him with a little bit of ‘something’, and he got the money and left. That was a bigger scam than even my mom could pull off. Having live lab rats come to you, baiting them with the finest cheese available to the low living things. Syd happily took the money and added it to our coffee tin.

Day 1: We were all happy until we weren’t. That night, Nick clutched his stomach at dinner, face chalk-white and breaking out in a thin, cold sweat. I watched him pick at his food, hands trembling, pushing the fork around like it was too heavy to lift.

Day 2: By morning, the pain had sharpened. He doubled over after trying to stand, and when he made it to the bathroom, we heard the retching through the thin motel walls. I caught a glimpse of him hunched on the tile, knuckles white against the porcelain rim, and the air was hot with the smell of bile.

Day 3: His skin turned a sallow shade, veins standing out blue against his arms. He lay sprawled in bed, shuddering with fever. I pressed my hand to his forehead and yanked it back—it felt like it could scorch my palm. He barely managed a few words.

Syd drove him to the nearest clinic with every dollar we had, trying to get him some medical help. They only came back with a still very sick Nick and a bottle of antibiotics. 

Day 4: Nick was basically in a comatose state, his only movements including multiple trips to the bathroom and leaning over the edge to barely miss the trash can. His breath rattled in his chest, and his lips were pale and cracked. By that night, his eyes wouldn't fully open, and all I could do was wipe sweat off his brow and hope he could feel me there.

Syd kept him hospitalized in our room the best she could and made him as comfortable as she could, and she did all of this stoically. Her face didn’t distort with sorrow or worry, and her lips did not tremble with even fear. She was calm, put together, and well-managed. I watched her for a couple of days, going through this robotic routine that involved the bathroom as much as she could with Nick being sick. Then one day, while she was trapped in her little prison, sobbing harder than I have ever heard. Nick grabbed my arm, and he pulled me down to his head. He looked me in the eyes with so much consequential dread. 

“You have to go comfort her.” His tone was weak but serious. 

“You want me to do it?” I was more perplexed than ever. I had never seen my mom upset over anything in my entire life. Now he was asking me to step into what seemed to be a more tragic breakdown than all the rest. 

“You have to love her as much as you can, and you have to care for her, show her your concern and sympathy. Let her know she isn't alone.” Nick instructed all of this with an insistent tone. 

“Of course I will do that.” How silly was it that he really had to ask me to do that for our mother? 

“Love her. Just please love her.” He was begging me at this point with tears brimming in his eyes. 

I didn't understand what was so serious about consoling my mother. I knew she was depressed, and I wanted to be there to help. Finally, I was able to be with my mom, sharing a tender moment of grief and releasing the flood of tension. Nick squeezed my arm tight before he let me go.

As I walked toward the bathroom, the sharp hum of the old ceiling light filled the narrow hallway, washing everything in a dull yellow glare. The air was thick and still. I paused outside her door, letting the silence settle around me for a second, giving myself a breath. The muffled sound of Syd’s crying was almost lost in that hush. I softly knocked. All I got in reply were heavier sobs.

I pressed my knuckles against the bathroom door, feeling its cold metal chill seep into my skin. My hand was unsteady, trembling ever so slightly as I let the moment weigh on me. “Mom, I'm gonna come in.” I wanted to introduce myself and not just barge in there.

With so much care, I began to open the door, but something was behind it, making only a crack visible for entry. I took a deep breath, squeezed my body through the crack, and witnessed the clog that had prevented me from a full entry. I don't know what it was, but it couldn't have been Syd. Sprawled across the tiles was an enormous, pale worm, thicker than any snake, its body twitching with unsettled tension. Its flesh had a raw, bruised look, dimpled with small, puckered holes that seemed to breathe, pulling the air in and shuddering it out in short, desperate gasps. For a moment I was transfixed, feeling a hot pulse of pity beneath the revulsion. It looked exhausted, exposed, curling in on itself like it desperately wanted to be hidden. Then the smell crashed into me—the sour, close heat of boiled cabbage and something sharp and chemical, stinging my eyes and scraping the back of my throat. I had to shove out the door and vomit, doubled over with my hands on my knees, shaking. As I tried to gather myself through dry heaves, I heard my brother yell at me.

“Go love her.” He was desperate. 

I wiped my eyes and held my breath, hoping that the small barrier would be enough to keep me from inhaling the stench of boiled cabbage and cat urine. I crept back into the room and took a full look at the slithering thing on the ground in front of me. It was large, that was for sure, and so thick I could sit on it comfortably if I wanted to. But with the small fleshy pores all tiny and placed over every inch of the slimy peach exterior, boiling and oozing out a secretion that was both liquid and solid. The substance that leaked from the orifices of this monster was grey, and it bubbled and emitted a faint hissing sound. For a split second, it was like I saw my mother and not the creature—her grief so big and warped, it almost took on its own form. I watched as the front of the monster, I assumed to be the front, rose up, almost meeting the ceiling. I had to love her. I walked forward and wasn't even close to wrapping both arms around her body. The thick slime oozed onto me as I heaved deep breaths in and out of my nose, trying to remain calm. Then I felt a hand touch my back, and I seized up. I whipped away from the beast and watched as a human arm quickly got sucked back into the fleshy, gooey glob. The wail was like no other, and it vibrated the room. Her loose skin trembled against her shiny body, and her pores let out deep breaths.

I needed to love her. I put my arms around her again and held as tightly as I could, and I felt the worm squirm and wrap around me. It’s thick saliva that ruptured from the little holes covering its body, stuck to me, and almost suctioned to my flesh. The effluvium coming from this thing I was pressed into was worse than ever before, and I had to swallow back vomit as it threatened to leave my throat. I squeezed my eyes closed as what was supposed to be my mother engulfed me in her loose, wet skin. I felt like I was sinking into a mattress, but I kept getting sucked in more and more. I had to turn my head to the side in order to breathe as I fought against the capture of my mom. She sucked me in so close I couldn't move an inch of my body. I felt her squeeze on and off with the sucking of an everlasting tune in these moments of misery. Her head leaned on top of mine and fell down to the back of my neck, where I could hear a gurgling noise. While trying to breathe, I tuned in to a song being softly sung to soothe myself. Dropkick Murphys, of all things, to sing at a time like this. But whatever works for now. I stood like that with her for hours and then felt her slither off my body and curl up into itself. I took that as a plea to leave, so I carefully walked out of the bathroom. 

I went, and I sat down next to my brother, whose raspy breathing was only getting worse. The room finally fell quiet. I didn't know what to say or what to ask. I was covered in grey, stinking ooze, and my hair was thick from the snotty slime. I didn't notice I was shaking until my brother put his hand on top of mine. He pulled me down, and I lay down beside him. He held me even when I was putrid and revolting; he didn't care.

“We have to take care of her.” Nick let out a deep wheeze. He then cleared his throat of all the gunk that was gathering in his membrane. “Sometimes it gets too hard for her in some places, and sometimes we go because she just said so.” He cleared his throat again, trying to get some normalcy back into his tone. “We just have to love her. That’s all she needs, and she will be fine. Just don’t stop loving her.” 

I closed my eyes, lying down next to my brother, and I couldn't help but think about what was going to happen to Syd once the two of us were old enough to go on with our lives. She was going to get old, and she couldn't keep jumping from one place to another until she inevitably died. I vowed to myself that night that I would love my mother, and I would do it through her life. I took on the responsibility of keeping back the beast, and it hung heavier on me than a weight. I knew what I was getting into, but I didn't want my brother to have to do it. I think he's done enough. I'm scared to see my mom cry again. The way her pores siphon like a tube latched to my skin, trying to pull out the love from me physically. I woke up to pressure on my side of the bed and turned my head to see Syd, clean, put together, and happy. 

“I love you, Mom,” I said it out loud so she could really know she was loved. 

“It’s the only thing that keeps me sane.” She laughed, but there were remnants of tears on her cheeks. “I don't know what would happen if I ran out of love.” She whispered more to herself than to me. 

I wouldn't let that happen. I was always going to be there to love her and bring her back. I was going to stick around and make sure she stayed human. I would hate to see her just stay a worm forever. ",1,1771439804.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I’ve explored a lot of the cafés around here to get outside of my house, but I’m getting bored of going to the same places all the time. Does anyone have some good recommendations for places to work? I’m talking cafés, casual coffee shops/bakeries, etc. I love libraries, but they’re a bit too quiet for my taste. I need some white noise to realky lock in.

I’m looking for places with reliable outlets, as my computer battery dies pretty quickly. I don’t need reliable Wi-Fi as I usually connect to my hotspot due to my job restrictions. So any places with decent food/drinks, good vibes, and somewhat reasonable parking nearby are welcome. Preferably nothing too deep into the valley and nothing south of downtown LA, simply because it’d be a bit too far for me to go during the workday. Somewhere I can get to in less than 30 minutes is ideal. I love Pasadena and Highland Park if anyone knows those areas well. ",3,1771439777.0,AskLosAngeles,10,1.0,False
1r8b91w,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1r8b91w/my_mom_turns_into_a_worm_when_she_cries/,My Mom Turns Into A Worm When She Cries,"The State of Massachusetts by Dropkick Murphy blares from every speaker in the Toyota Tacoma, and I avert my eyes from my mom's cheerful amusement. I can see her in the rearview mirror, singing and drumming on the top of the steering wheel, and I turn away to gawk at the blue paint on the outside of the truck and the blurry images of passing woodlands. We have been driving this good ole boy around for almost twenty years now that I know of. It’s me, Nick, my older brother, my mom, Syd, and our dog D. Breeze. D sat in the back seat with me and half of our luggage and all our belongings. D’s  big droopy face hung out the window, his cheeks flung back, and his tongue panting to the side. I reached my hand over the boxes between us and scratched his velvet hide. D was a big dog, and the only reason he fit in this truck was that he was only 6 months old, his entire body already taking up half the back of the seat. 

Syd is an oddly cheery woman and has been since I’ve known her, at least. Even after dad died and we turned into what she calls ‘free spirits, ’ she is still wonderfully positive about everything. Syd can’t keep it together most of the time, and we move around a lot, which we are doing right now. Town to town, city to city, sometimes just county to county. We were just always moving. Everything was always in a rush, too, like the world was on fire. I gotta give her some credit, we make it almost a year in most places. Then something tragic happens, and I watch Syd and Nick run around all frantically getting our apartment, trailer, duplex, all packed up, and then we were out the door as soon as we could grab as much as we could. The only consistent thing that stayed with us so far was Mr. D. He’s only been around for six months. I’m not mad at my mom. I love her more than anything. But how can I really be anything other than worried for her? My mom was a very private woman when Dad was around. She happily hung around the family most days, but then she’d get hit with some kind of mental dilemma, and she would disappear for days at a time inside her room. With dad gone, helping Syd with her mental health and financial support, we had to turn to odd, weird jobs here and there wherever we landed. Then it only took one bad thing to happen for us to sprint away. It was weird too, every time we moved, I never knew the reason, and no one has told me why. Nick knows. Mom told him a long time ago why we move so frequently and never get to know anyone. 

We had driven for days until we hit our first destination. Some washed-up, piece of shit, one-hitter motel.  My mom babbled happily along to the clerk as she pulled out crinkled wads of cash. We were never living in a place long enough to get set up with what my mom calls ‘money scammers, ’ so electronic payment was never an option for us. She kept up the chatter for what felt like forever before trudging us up to the second balcony of the broken-down establishment. I looked down at a corner room where I saw a lovely woman, in a skimpy dress, stiletto heels, take a big wad of cash, all bundled up tightly, from some happy looking mother fucker half dressed. The exchange was over, and the man disappeared, and I watched the young woman take off her heels and then wait for her ride. I didn’t get to see who picked her up before we got to our two queen room. Once we put down everything we had already carried up, we went back down for a second, third, and fourth load. If it wasn’t locked in the room with us, it was locked inside the truck. When everything was settled for the night, I watched Nick disappear into the bathroom, and Syd sat cross-legged on the bed closest to the door flipping through the provided channels. 

The next morning, first thing: getting money. Syd took Nick and me downstairs to the manager’s little hidey hole that could only hold a desk and a chair. Nick and I waited outside the office for an hour while Syd spoke and spoke, on and on, to the manager. Our new employer, Kim, was showing all of us to the work center, which was a closet next to her office. I looked at all the cleaning supplies and knew my mom had sold me for cheap labor. Nick and I always got caught in my mom's scams. Crazy enough, believe it or not, the first room we went to clean was that corner room that I happened to watch just the other day. I shuddered as I picked up stained sheets and watched as discolored lace panties fell out of the bundle and onto the floor. I looked down at the undergarment and felt more relief than disgust. I just knew it didn't matter how low we got in life, Syd never resorted to things like that. I have watched her sell a piece of furniture she refinished from the dump to some chump for hundreds of dollars. She got away with this with her ‘authentic letter’ provided with the rare ‘antique’. Syd was clever like that and quick on her feet. 

When Syd wasn't making us money, however, she kept herself locked in the bathroom. If we had to use it, we had to find another one that wasn't already in use. She used to do it when Dad was alive, and the habit still clung to her now. Just disappearing sometimes for days at a time into one secluded location. Always alone. At first, I was ignorant of why she was in there, but then I began to hear the crying and knew that my mother was finally taking down the charade and taking in her reality as it was. Removing the weight and letting it fall to the floor with a huge thud. I let her be. I never asked about it further. I just assumed Syd was kind of depressed. I felt bad for her, but more than anything, I was concerned for her. She never let me in. I would sometimes see Nick enter the bathroom. I could hear him talking to her, but I could never hear the replies. When he would leave, he would inch out of a crack in the door and always run into me. I would stare up at him, always waiting for an answer, and always, he pushed past me with nothing to give. We cleaned at that motel for a few days, and I began to pick up on the locals' routine around here. 

There was a brief guy, the old man who came out of 1C with his cup of coffee and his whitey tighties. A little newspaper kid comes around here in his beat-up rusted Corolla and gives the old man a rounded-up paper, and the balding man takes it, taps it against his white-haired chest in salute, and walks back into his room every morning at six a.m. Then, there was the woman I named Linda. She is a frequent visitor to 9G, the corner room downstairs. Always the same skimpy dress and stilts, walking in with a different guy each time. She always came around at 9 or 10 in the morning. Watching her, I got the sense we all had our repetitive motions: her ritual visits, my family’s endless moves, looping circles like tapes stuck on the same song. Then there was Carl. That was actually his name. He starts at the office at 5 in the morning with his little hand weights and his sweat suit, and he speed walks the entire motel all morning, chatting up everyone he runs into. When you talk to him, he is always jogging in place, and you can always watch the small lift and fall of his blonde toupee as his steps go up and down in rapid moments. I don't know what the exercise was doing for him; I never saw his beer belly lift even an inch since I saw him. Sometimes I wonder if Carl is running from something too, circling the building over and over but never quite escaping. I watched the waistband grow, however, and I think the poor man just needs to work on his diet.

Nick took the truck every day to a few jobs he could catch in the nearest town, which was miles away. One day, he came back from some kind of weird job that paid him 500 dollars. He told Syd and me that all they did was inject him with a little bit of ‘something’, and he got the money and left. That was a bigger scam than even my mom could pull off. Having live lab rats come to you, baiting them with the finest cheese available to the low living things. Syd happily took the money and added it to our coffee tin.

Day 1: We were all happy until we weren’t. That night, Nick clutched his stomach at dinner, face chalk-white and breaking out in a thin, cold sweat. I watched him pick at his food, hands trembling, pushing the fork around like it was too heavy to lift.

Day 2: By morning, the pain had sharpened. He doubled over after trying to stand, and when he made it to the bathroom, we heard the retching through the thin motel walls. I caught a glimpse of him hunched on the tile, knuckles white against the porcelain rim, and the air was hot with the smell of bile.

Day 3: His skin turned a sallow shade, veins standing out blue against his arms. He lay sprawled in bed, shuddering with fever. I pressed my hand to his forehead and yanked it back—it felt like it could scorch my palm. He barely managed a few words.

Syd drove him to the nearest clinic with every dollar we had, trying to get him some medical help. They only came back with a still very sick Nick and a bottle of antibiotics. 

Day 4: Nick was basically in a comatose state, his only movements including multiple trips to the bathroom and leaning over the edge to barely miss the trash can. His breath rattled in his chest, and his lips were pale and cracked. By that night, his eyes wouldn't fully open, and all I could do was wipe sweat off his brow and hope he could feel me there.

Syd kept him hospitalized in our room the best she could and made him as comfortable as she could, and she did all of this stoically. Her face didn’t distort with sorrow or worry, and her lips did not tremble with even fear. She was calm, put together, and well-managed. I watched her for a couple of days, going through this robotic routine that involved the bathroom as much as she could with Nick being sick. Then one day, while she was trapped in her little prison, sobbing harder than I have ever heard. Nick grabbed my arm, and he pulled me down to his head. He looked me in the eyes with so much consequential dread. 

“You have to go comfort her.” His tone was weak but serious. 

“You want me to do it?” I was more perplexed than ever. I had never seen my mom upset over anything in my entire life. Now he was asking me to step into what seemed to be a more tragic breakdown than all the rest. 

“You have to love her as much as you can, and you have to care for her, show her your concern and sympathy. Let her know she isn't alone.” Nick instructed all of this with an insistent tone. 

“Of course I will do that.” How silly was it that he really had to ask me to do that for our mother? 

“Love her. Just please love her.” He was begging me at this point with tears brimming in his eyes. 

I didn't understand what was so serious about consoling my mother. I knew she was depressed, and I wanted to be there to help. Finally, I was able to be with my mom, sharing a tender moment of grief and releasing the flood of tension. Nick squeezed my arm tight before he let me go.

As I walked toward the bathroom, the sharp hum of the old ceiling light filled the narrow hallway, washing everything in a dull yellow glare. The air was thick and still. I paused outside her door, letting the silence settle around me for a second, giving myself a breath. The muffled sound of Syd’s crying was almost lost in that hush. I softly knocked. All I got in reply were heavier sobs.

I pressed my knuckles against the bathroom door, feeling its cold metal chill seep into my skin. My hand was unsteady, trembling ever so slightly as I let the moment weigh on me. “Mom, I'm gonna come in.” I wanted to introduce myself and not just barge in there.

With so much care, I began to open the door, but something was behind it, making only a crack visible for entry. I took a deep breath, squeezed my body through the crack, and witnessed the clog that had prevented me from a full entry. I don't know what it was, but it couldn't have been Syd. Sprawled across the tiles was an enormous, pale worm, thicker than any snake, its body twitching with unsettled tension. Its flesh had a raw, bruised look, dimpled with small, puckered holes that seemed to breathe, pulling the air in and shuddering it out in short, desperate gasps. For a moment I was transfixed, feeling a hot pulse of pity beneath the revulsion. It looked exhausted, exposed, curling in on itself like it desperately wanted to be hidden. Then the smell crashed into me—the sour, close heat of boiled cabbage and something sharp and chemical, stinging my eyes and scraping the back of my throat. I had to shove out the door and vomit, doubled over with my hands on my knees, shaking. As I tried to gather myself through dry heaves, I heard my brother yell at me.

“Go love her.” He was desperate. 

I wiped my eyes and held my breath, hoping that the small barrier would be enough to keep me from inhaling the stench of boiled cabbage and cat urine. I crept back into the room and took a full look at the slithering thing on the ground in front of me. It was large, that was for sure, and so thick I could sit on it comfortably if I wanted to. But with the small fleshy pores all tiny and placed over every inch of the slimy peach exterior, boiling and oozing out a secretion that was both liquid and solid. The substance that leaked from the orifices of this monster was grey, and it bubbled and emitted a faint hissing sound. For a split second, it was like I saw my mother and not the creature—her grief so big and warped, it almost took on its own form. I watched as the front of the monster, I assumed to be the front, rose up, almost meeting the ceiling. I had to love her. I walked forward and wasn't even close to wrapping both arms around her body. The thick slime oozed onto me as I heaved deep breaths in and out of my nose, trying to remain calm. Then I felt a hand touch my back, and I seized up. I whipped away from the beast and watched as a human arm quickly got sucked back into the fleshy, gooey glob. The wail was like no other, and it vibrated the room. Her loose skin trembled against her shiny body, and her pores let out deep breaths.

I needed to love her. I put my arms around her again and held as tightly as I could, and I felt the worm squirm and wrap around me. It’s thick saliva that ruptured from the little holes covering its body, stuck to me, and almost suctioned to my flesh. The effluvium coming from this thing I was pressed into was worse than ever before, and I had to swallow back vomit as it threatened to leave my throat. I squeezed my eyes closed as what was supposed to be my mother engulfed me in her loose, wet skin. I felt like I was sinking into a mattress, but I kept getting sucked in more and more. I had to turn my head to the side in order to breathe as I fought against the capture of my mom. She sucked me in so close I couldn't move an inch of my body. I felt her squeeze on and off with the sucking of an everlasting tune in these moments of misery. Her head leaned on top of mine and fell down to the back of my neck, where I could hear a gurgling noise. While trying to breathe, I tuned in to a song being softly sung to soothe myself. Dropkick Murphys, of all things, to sing at a time like this. But whatever works for now. I stood like that with her for hours and then felt her slither off my body and curl up into itself. I took that as a plea to leave, so I carefully walked out of the bathroom. 

I went, and I sat down next to my brother, whose raspy breathing was only getting worse. The room finally fell quiet. I didn't know what to say or what to ask. I was covered in grey, stinking ooze, and my hair was thick from the snotty slime. I didn't notice I was shaking until my brother put his hand on top of mine. He pulled me down, and I lay down beside him. He held me even when I was putrid and revolting; he didn't care.

“We have to take care of her.” Nick let out a deep wheeze. He then cleared his throat of all the gunk that was gathering in his membrane. “Sometimes it gets too hard for her in some places, and sometimes we go because she just said so.” He cleared his throat again, trying to get some normalcy back into his tone. “We just have to love her. That’s all she needs, and she will be fine. Just don’t stop loving her.” 

I closed my eyes, lying down next to my brother, and I couldn't help but think about what was going to happen to Syd once the two of us were old enough to go on with our lives. She was going to get old, and she couldn't keep jumping from one place to another until she inevitably died.

Syd drove him to the nearest clinic with every dollar we had, trying to get him some medical help. They only came back with a still very sick Nick and a bottle of antibiotics. 

Day 4: Nick was basically in a comatose state, his only movements including multiple trips to the bathroom and leaning over the edge to barely miss the trash can. His breath rattled in his chest, and his lips were pale and cracked. By that night, his eyes wouldn't fully open, and all I could do was wipe sweat off his brow and hope he could feel me there.

Syd kept him hospitalized in our room the best she could and made him as comfortable as she could, and she did all of this stoically. Her face didn’t distort with sorrow or worry, and her lips did not tremble with even fear. She was calm, put together, and well-managed. I watched her for a couple of days, going through this robotic routine that involved the bathroom as much as she could with Nick being sick. Then one day, while she was trapped in her little prison, sobbing harder than I have ever heard. Nick grabbed my arm, and he pulled me down to his head. He looked me in the eyes with so much consequential dread. 

“You have to go comfort her.” His tone was weak but serious. 

“You want me to do it?” I was more perplexed than ever. I had never seen my mom upset over anything in my entire life. Now he was asking me to step into what seemed to be a more tragic breakdown than all the rest. 

“You have to love her as much as you can, and you have to care for her, show her your concern and sympathy. Let her know she isn't alone.” Nick instructed all of this with an insistent tone. 

“Of course I will do that.” How silly was it that he really had to ask me to do that for our mother? 

“Love her. Just please love her.” He was begging me at this point with tears brimming in his eyes. 

I didn't understand what was so serious about consoling my mother. I knew she was depressed, and I wanted to be there to help. Finally, I was able to be with my mom, sharing a tender moment of grief and releasing the flood of tension. Nick squeezed my arm tight before he let me go.

As I walked toward the bathroom, the sharp hum of the old ceiling light filled the narrow hallway, washing everything in a dull yellow glare. The air was thick and still. I paused outside her door, letting the silence settle around me for a second, giving myself a breath. The muffled sound of Syd’s crying was almost lost in that hush. I softly knocked. All I got in reply were heavier sobs.

I pressed my knuckles against the bathroom door, feeling its cold metal chill seep into my skin. My hand was unsteady, trembling ever so slightly as I let the moment weigh on me. “Mom, I'm gonna come in.” I wanted to introduce myself and not just barge in there.

With so much care, I began to open the door, but something was behind it, making only a crack visible for entry. I took a deep breath, squeezed my body through the crack, and witnessed the clog that had prevented me from a full entry. I don't know what it was, but it couldn't have been Syd. Sprawled across the tiles was an enormous, pale worm, thicker than any snake, its body twitching with unsettled tension. Its flesh had a raw, bruised look, dimpled with small, puckered holes that seemed to breathe, pulling the air in and shuddering it out in short, desperate gasps. For a moment I was transfixed, feeling a hot pulse of pity beneath the revulsion. It looked exhausted, exposed, curling in on itself like it desperately wanted to be hidden. Then the smell crashed into me—the sour, close heat of boiled cabbage and something sharp and chemical, stinging my eyes and scraping the back of my throat. I had to shove out the door and vomit, doubled over with my hands on my knees, shaking. As I tried to gather myself through dry heaves, I heard my brother yell at me.

“Go love her.” He was desperate. 

I wiped my eyes and held my breath, hoping that the small barrier would be enough to keep me from inhaling the stench of boiled cabbage and cat urine. I crept back into the room and took a full look at the slithering thing on the ground in front of me. It was large, that was for sure, and so thick I could sit on it comfortably if I wanted to. But with the small fleshy pores all tiny and placed over every inch of the slimy peach exterior, boiling and oozing out a secretion that was both liquid and solid. The substance that leaked from the orifices of this monster was grey, and it bubbled and emitted a faint hissing sound. For a split second, it was like I saw my mother and not the creature—her grief so big and warped, it almost took on its own form. I watched as the front of the monster, I assumed to be the front, rose up, almost meeting the ceiling. I had to love her. I walked forward and wasn't even close to wrapping both arms around her body. The thick slime oozed onto me as I heaved deep breaths in and out of my nose, trying to remain calm. Then I felt a hand touch my back, and I seized up. I whipped away from the beast and watched as a human arm quickly got sucked back into the fleshy, gooey glob. The wail was like no other, and it vibrated the room. Her loose skin trembled against her shiny body, and her pores let out deep breaths.

I needed to love her. I put my arms around her again and held as tightly as I could, and I felt the worm squirm and wrap around me. It’s thick saliva that ruptured from the little holes covering its body, stuck to me, and almost suctioned to my flesh. The effluvium coming from this thing I was pressed into was worse than ever before, and I had to swallow back vomit as it threatened to leave my throat. I squeezed my eyes closed as what was supposed to be my mother engulfed me in her loose, wet skin. I felt like I was sinking into a mattress, but I kept getting sucked in more and more. I had to turn my head to the side in order to breathe as I fought against the capture of my mom. She sucked me in so close I couldn't move an inch of my body. I felt her squeeze on and off with the sucking of an everlasting tune in these moments of misery. Her head leaned on top of mine and fell down to the back of my neck, where I could hear a gurgling noise. While trying to breathe, I tuned in to a song being softly sung to soothe myself. Dropkick Murphys, of all things, to sing at a time like this. But whatever works for now. I stood like that with her for hours and then felt her slither off my body and curl up into itself. I took that as a plea to leave, so I carefully walked out of the bathroom. 

I went, and I sat down next to my brother, whose raspy breathing was only getting worse. The room finally fell quiet. I didn't know what to say or what to ask. I was covered in grey, stinking ooze, and my hair was thick from the snotty slime. I didn't notice I was shaking until my brother put his hand on top of mine. He pulled me down, and I lay down beside him. He held me even when I was putrid and revolting; he didn't care.

“We have to take care of her.” Nick let out a deep wheeze. He then cleared his throat of all the gunk that was gathering in his membrane. “Sometimes it gets too hard for her in some places, and sometimes we go because she just said so.” He cleared his throat again, trying to get some normalcy back into his tone. “We just have to love her. That’s all she needs, and she will be fine. Just don’t stop loving her.” 

I closed my eyes, lying down next to my brother, and I couldn't help but think about what was going to happen to Syd once the two of us were old enough to go on with our lives. She was going to get old, and she couldn't keep jumping from one place to another until she inevitably died. I vowed to myself that night that I would love my mother, and I would do it through her life. I took on the responsibility of keeping back the beast, and it hung heavier on me than a weight. I knew what I was getting into, but I didn't want my brother to have to do it. I think he's done enough. I'm scared to see my mom cry again. The way her pores siphon like a tube latched to my skin, trying to pull out the love from me physically. I woke up to pressure on my side of the bed and turned my head to see Syd, clean, put together, and happy. 

“I love you, Mom,” I said it out loud so she could really know she was loved. 

“It’s the only thing that keeps me sane.” She laughed, but there were remnants of tears on her cheeks. “I don't know what would happen if I ran out of love.” She whispered more to herself than to me. 

I wouldn't let that happen. I was always going to be there to love her and bring her back. I was going to stick around and make sure she stayed human. I would hate to see her just stay a worm forever. ",1,1771439739.0,Nonsleep,0,1.0,False

Saksi sa lahat ng sakit na pinagdaanan ko at lahat ng panloloko nya ang bestfriend ko. Galit na galit din sya sa ex ko kasi ginago ako ng ganon ganon lang at lalo na dun sa babae kasi nakita nya kung paano ako nasaktan ng sobra.

After almost 3 yrs, finally nakamove on na din ako. Sobrang OA pero ganon katagal ako bago nakamove on. Tapos out of nowhere chinat ako ng bestfriend ko na chinat daw sya ng ex ko, saying na namimiss na daw ako at balak akong parang ligawan ulit. Pero sabi ko non hindi na, lalo na at sobrang sakit ng ginawa nya pero ang sabi nya sa bestfriend ko hihintayin nya ako ulit. 

Ilang months ang lumipas, naging busy na ako sa life kaya parang almost a month din kami hindi nagkausap ng bestfriend ko. Kasi ganon naman talaga yung ibang mag bff diba. Madalas ako inaaya ng bestfriend ko mag coffee date, kaso hindi matuloy tuloy kasi nga super busy ko. 

Tapos bigla na lang after namin magusap non about sa coffee date sana namin na di matuloy tuloy nakatulog na ako sa pagod. Tapos ewan ko sobrang random, napanaginipan ko yung bestfriend ko na may kasamang lalaki na pakiramdam ko familiar, naweirduhan ako kasi  nbsb yon. Pero nung nagising ako ewan ko parang ang bilis ng tibok ng puso ko, pero pinagsawalang bahala ko na lang kahit pakiramdam ko may mali.

Then one day, nagopen ako ng social media and then boom. Para akong nabuhusan ng malamig na tubig tapos biglang nagloading utak ko. Nakita kong yung bestfriend ko at yung ex ko ay magkasama at magjowa na pala sila hahahaha. Wala akong kaalam alam. Kaya pala feel ko may kakaiba sa panaginip ko hahahaha. Hindi ko na kinausap ang bestfriend ko dahil after nilang iannounce na official na sila ay hindi na din sya nagparamdam sa akin. Wala din akong narinig na kahit anong paliwanag mula sa kanya. Pero sa loob loob ko ay napakarami kong tanong. Nakakatawa kasi parehas pa kami ng first boyfriend luh hahahaha.

Months after chinat ako ng isang relative ng ex ko at sinabing ikakasal na daw yung ex ko dahil buntis na yung gf. Sinabi ko sa relative ng ex ko na bestfriend ko yung pakakasalan, gulat na gulat sya at hindi makapaniwala at sinabing paano daw nagawa yun ng ex ko at ng bestfriend ko sa akin, sana ako na lang daw nakatuluyan. Hindi na ako nagreply.

Lumipas ulit ang ilang buwan, nakita kong ikinasal na pala sila. Ganoon pa din, kahit anong balita ay wala ni katiting akong narinig sa bestfriend ko. Paliwanag o sorry, wala. As in wala, na para bang hindi kami magkakilala. Masakit sakin yon syempre kasi noon usapan namin gagawin naming abay sa kasal ang isa't isa. Saksi sya sa lahat ng yugto ng buhay ko, alam nya lahat ng sakit na pinagdaanan ko sa ex boyfriend ko at kung gaano ako nahirapan makausad.

Hanggang ngayon ay hindi pa din kami naguusap ng bestfriend ko. Hindi ko din alam kung valid ba yung naramdaman kong sakit at tampo noong naging sila, at ngayon asawa na nya. Although wala naman na akong pakialam na sa ex ko, pero sa bestfriend ko ako nanghinayang. ",7,1771439737.0,ShareKoLang,5,0.77,False

I take them at 6am, 10am and 2pm.

  
I’m emotionally flat, achy and not coping with the insomnia. My workouts suck (I’m not taking any pre workouts with stims and have cut down to one small coffee per day at 4:30am) and I’m having a fuzzy feeling headache that comes and goes every day. I’m feeling absolutely no increase in focus or brain chatter.

  
I know it takes a while but I’m feeling disheartened and it’s probably because of the insomnia. I slept badly before starting dex and I take a bunch of doctor approved stuff that helped me enormously - I was sleeping the best I have in 20+ years. 

I have my 6 week review in about a month but the psychiatrist said if I have any issues I can call for a 15 minute zoom to talk about it.

  
Should I persevere for longer? Will things improve after the 2 week mark? I don’t want to give up too soon but all I’m experiencing is negative after negative and not seeing any positives.

I’d go out on dates, party, drink, and do whatever I wanted - whenever I wanted. Dating is awful these days. I got fed up with social media multiple times and would deactivate socials one by one. Eventually I’d reactivate them and be back to the ‘normal’ if there is such a thing.

Fast forward to April 2024, I went on a date with a guy who I felt was too good to be true. (Met on fb dating so my mind was ready to see where things go sour.) we had a great time. I truly enjoyed his company. We wound up going on a second date the next day for coffee. Everything just felt so good and natural.

My gosh, his eyes, smile, and sense of humor. 

Spoiler; we’ve been dating for almost 2 years now. Our relationship has had more ups than downs, he’s taught me how to better communicate, how to love gently, and so much more. He’s given me the opportunity in life to be a mother to his babies, help them learn and grow, and even have coffee or donut dates with. 

I feel I’m becoming the best version of me, because of him. I feel like his creativeness has intertwined with mine, and helps me grow. I’ve taken over his house with my things and shoved him into a corner with the spiders. But with everything, he’s loved me through it all. 

I thought I was living it up partying, drinking, and just being free. I feel I’m my happiest now because I get to wake up and fall asleep next to him, make breakfast and dinner, help with the babies that sometimes drive me insane, and most of all, he loves me for my goofy self.

yo, figured i'd share some info on parking for the lunar new year festival at santa anita park on 02/22. it is going to be the year of the horse so you know the place is gonna be packed with people and traffic will be a mess on huntington drive and baldwin ave.  
  
honestly before you deal with the massive lines at the gates you should check out Prked. it is an app where you can rent driveways or garages from people who live right next to santa anita park. it is way cheaper than the official venue parking and it lets you skip the nightmare of exiting those huge lots after the event ends. plus a short walk is way better than sitting in your car for forty minutes trying to get out of the dirt lot.  
  
if you decide to go with the official lot just know that the main entrances are off huntington dr at gate 3 or off baldwin ave at gate 8. they usually charge around twenty or thirty bucks for the closer spots and maybe less for general but the lines get backed up all the way to the 210 freeway. try to get there at least an hour before the 10:30 am start time because baldwin ave basically turns into a parking lot itself. gate 5 on colorado blvd is sometimes open too and can be a sneaky way in if the others are jammed.  
  
some people try to park at the westfield santa anita mall across the street to save money but i would be careful with that. security is usually on top of it during big festivals like this and they might tow if they see you walking across the street to the track instead of going into the mall. if you do use the mall maybe grab a coffee or something first so you look like a customer but it is still risky.  
  
residential streets nearby are also tricky because many of them have permit only signs especially on the south side of huntington dr and the streets near holly ave. if you do not have a permit you will definitely get a ticket from arcadia pd. another move is taking the metro l line to the arcadia station and then grabbing the shuttle or a quick uber but even those get stuck in the traffic on the way in.  
  
the traffic flow usually gets really heavy right around noon so if you are not parked by then you are going to be waiting a long time in your car. baldwin and colorado blvd are usually the worst spots for congestion. just plan ahead so you do not miss the lion dances and the food stalls. hope this helps you out.",1,1771439494.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1r8b41i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r8b41i,Pojagi curtains for a home office,"Hi sewing friends! My partner and I bought our own (small) home this year and we both work from home. His office is in a little nook (originally a breakfast nook) off our kitchen, so he needed some visual separation from me when I’m cooking/making coffee and he’s in the zone. 



I settled on wanting Japanese Noren curtains (two flat rectangle panels, and not all the way to the floor) to let light in and let our dog walk under the curtain :) After exploring ideas on Etsy and Youtube for a while, I wanted to try my hand at the Korean Pojagi technique—a reversible patchwork quilting technique that reminds me so much of stained glass. 



For details about how to do Pojagi, I used these two videos:

[https://youtu.be/UgXY8Fb7HTs](https://youtu.be/UgXY8Fb7HTs)

[https://youtu.be/X5ViW5mraYM](https://youtu.be/X5ViW5mraYM)



This was such a cool & beautiful technique that let me be super creative! There’s no pattern to it, though I supposed you could use one—you just starting sewing pieces of fabric together, then sewing larger chunks together, then repeat til you have the size you want and then you finish the edges. It took a lot of trial and error when laying out the big chunks to decide how exactly I wanted them laid out in the curtain. Pojagi essentially uses flat felled seams to connect the fabric pieces, then I used a folded hem to finish the edges. I also sewed a curtain rod pocket at the top to hang them from a rod. 



The colored linen squares were already in my stash—I had ordered linen color samples for a project years ago and hung on to all of them in case I ever had a use for 2x2” squares of linen, lol. I picked up 3 yards of white linen for the rest and used about 2.5 yards.
