1had6wk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1had6wk,Any barista or coffee enthusiasts can comment on Bacha Coffee?,"I passed by the shops all the time in Singapore and just refuse to fork out for that extravagance. I succumbed to it a month ago and gotten one of the ‚Äúfine-flavoured‚Äù type because it simply smelled so good. And just for the sake of proving a point. I feel that it‚Äôs just a brand that tends to gaslight tourists. And I know it somehow gets a bad rep among locals as well. 

I asked two of the retail guys if they know when were the beans roasted. One mentioned the ones of the wall are always roasted 3-4 days ago, which to me sounded bs because how on earth can you empty out so many beans in a few days. And we‚Äôre talking like a few hundred flavours. Another guy mentioned he used to be a barista, simply said ‚Äúit‚Äôs trade secret, so nobody knows.‚ÄùWhich actually leaves a question mark about the brand.

So I brought home and made some espresso, it was tasteless. It‚Äôs just some ambiguous flavouring. Or maybe it‚Äôs just a lack of skill on my end. That 250g box cost me SGD44 (~USD33).

and i dont want to lose my teeth i want to have good dental hygiene again i even hide my teeth when im out in public and dont smile anymore and stuff and i want that to stop

my finger and feet nails are so long and disgusting my toenails even started breaking om the nail bed bc they got to long and always hitted the front on my shoe and i wanna be pretty again i thought about getting my nails done or getting press ons or doing something simple myself but honestly whats the point when i cant even clip them in a timespan of like 1 1/2 - 2 months

I created my own AI coloring page generator: [kolors.page](https://kolors.page), and I wanted to post about it here. I know there are many coloring page sites out there and plenty with free pages, but none of them really cut it for me. So, I made my own because it was a simple project, and I wanted to show my daughter what I can do.

I wanted a tool where she can go on her own, find a drawing on the MAIN page, and print it in under 30 seconds (4-year-old attention span!). I build AI tools for a living, so I had to incorporate an AI generator, using FluxDev, which is slightly more expensive than what I've seen for coloring pages so far. But I wanted it to be dirt cheap and good quality.

I tested it with friends and family. Those who involved their kids had a blast, and I received pictures during their coloring sessions. Those adults who did it on their own tried it once and stopped. So this tool is ""forbidden"" for adults to use on their own :-)

I added a mic feature for kids to say what they want and be autonomous in generating and printing pages. I also added an idea generator in case some adults break the rule or we hit a little blank page syndrome.

Most importantly, I generate a lot for the kids at home, and I share the nicest ones for free on the main page. Those who want to generate can do so for, I think, a very affordable price to cover my costs and buying me coffees and treats for the kids.

This project helped me uncover the AI adoption issue I had with my main AI projects, which is the blank page syndrome and imagination, and I've revised my strategy to build those business tools now.

We were not together at the time, and I only recently found out about this.

Anyway, recently he told me his mom and aunt were discussing his spending habits. Tbh my boyfriend is the most frugal person I know. He hates spending money and even getting him to go out for coffee can be a challenge, even though he has plenty of savings and makes about $200k a year. I should also mention that I pay for my own coffee on the rare occasion we do go out for one.

Back to his mom and aunt. My bf told me they were upset to find out he bought birthday decorations for a friend‚Äôs party he would be hosting at his place, saying that he didn‚Äôt need to waste his money and hosting was enough. 

This perplexed me, but I just let it go at first. This isn‚Äôt the first he told me about their involvement in his finances. A few days later the topic came up again because he said his mom was upset about him buying some Christmas presents for a few family members. My bf‚Äôs family doesn‚Äôt celebrate Christmas, but in recent years he‚Äôs found joy in participating in gift exchanges like white elephant and secret Santa with friends, so he thought he‚Äôd buy a few small things for family, too. Well, his mom wasn‚Äôt having it and apparently bickered about it throughout dinner the other night.

I asked him what was wrong because he seemed down when I saw him, and he told me what happened. He said it makes sense his mom‚Äôs upset because he technically borrowed money from her for the house down payment (so he could pay in cash in a very competitive market, otherwise he wouldn‚Äôt have had to borrow any). 

After hearing him out I asked if his mom would continue to be involved in his purchasing decisions if we were to get married and combine our finances. He said he didn‚Äôt know, so I asked if he‚Äôd be willing to set a boundary with his mom in the future about discussing finances, if we were to get married. He said he‚Äôd have to think about it, but my initial impression is that he doesn‚Äôt want to upset his mom by placing such a boundary.

Am I overreacting to be upset by this? 

For context, in case this matters, I am also doing well financially and do not rely on my bf.",1,1733759325.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

1hacmpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hacmpn/various_symptoms_possibly_related_to_wisdom_teeth/,Various symptoms possibly related to wisdom teeth,"For a few years now I've had to deal with both teeth grinding at night and constant tinnitus that I think may be caused by my wisdom teeth, which grew in diagonally when I was a teen but never bothered me until recently. I can't even say for sure if they're really the cause because my jaw joints only rarely feel uncomfortable, and the teeth themselves don't hurt at all. I wear a cheap moldable mouth guard every night to prevent my teeth from wearing away completely.

This year, however, things have gotten alarmingly worse for unknown reasons. I've been woken up by brain zaps in the middle of the night, and headaches are more frequent, sometimes lasting all day. Just this past month my skull bones have started popping randomly if I move my head the wrong way. I have to be extra careful when positioning my head on my pillow to prevent these things, but it's never guaranteed.

I've been wanting to get my wisdom teeth removed for years, but I'm way too poor to afford the surgery. I keep hoping maybe Medicare or something similar will cover it, but every time I try to sign up I never receive any e-mail or letter confirming that I have it.

It doesn't help that I'm often stressed or anxious about my health, my finances and the state of the world most days. On top of that, I have very distracting (but unrelated) joint pain all over 24/7 despite being only 35 years old, pain that started as far back as when I was 12. Aspirin has never worked for me. I'm overweight, not very strong, and I feel tired all the time.

I'm scared, especially because I don't know what's happening to me. I'm worried that I'm going to clench my jaw so hard that something inside my head just breaks while I'm sleeping... and to be honest, I'm worried that I'll suffer some serious damage someday, possibly very soon.

I'm 35M, white, 5'10"". I haven't weighed myself in years, but I would guess I'm somewhere around 165-170 lbs. The only thing I would consider a drug that I consume regularly is caffeine- I have one cup of coffee every day, two on rare occasions.",1,1733759141.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Incorporating antioxidant-rich foods and drinks into your diet is a powerful way to cleanse the body, improve overall health, and even support prostate care. Antioxidants combat harmful substances in the body, improving quality of life by supporting everything from the nervous system to digestion. Here's a list of 12 high-antioxidant drinks to include in your daily routine for better health and prostate care.

[Antioxidant-Rich Prostate Care - Drinks to Boost Your Health](https://preview.redd.it/wzzdhxxffu5e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=19f48bc348500e2f4fab406f4eac9b9ea3649f04)

# 1. Green Tea

Green tea is a renowned source of antioxidants, particularly catechins. These compounds have been extensively studied for their potential to prevent various cancers, including prostate cancer. Regular consumption of green tea also supports cardiovascular health and enhances metabolism.

# 2. Pomegranate Juice

Pomegranate juice boasts three times the antioxidant activity of green tea. Its unique compounds protect against cardiovascular diseases by preventing plaque buildup in the arteries. Research indicates it may also reduce the risk of breast, colon, [and prostate cancers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Energy_Health/comments/1h8pmnt/discover_the_power_of_flowforce_max_the_ultimate/).

# 3. Coffee

Coffee beans are rich in antioxidants, ranking high among popular beverages. Drinking black coffee can reduce the risk of heart disease and fatty liver disease while providing additional health benefits such as improved metabolism and liver support.

# 4. Tomato Juice

Tomato juice is packed with lycopene, a powerful antioxidant known for reducing the risk of cancers like lung, breast, and prostate. Lycopene helps neutralize free radicals, reduces inflammation, and supports healthy digestion and liver function.

# 5. Acai Juice

Acai berries, derived from a palm tree native to the Amazon, contain exceptionally high antioxidant levels‚Äîthree times more than blueberries. This juice promotes skin vitality, lowers cholesterol levels, and combats premature aging.

# 6. Blueberry Juice

Blueberry juice is a rich source of antioxidants, offering significant heart health benefits. Its properties help reduce the risk of cancer and diabetes while scavenging free radicals to prevent oxidative damage.

# 7. Grape Juice

Grape juice balances bad cholesterol, reduces blood triglyceride levels, and flushes harmful toxins from the body. Its antioxidant properties also lower the risk of heart disease and other chronic conditions.

# 8. Cabbage Juice

Cabbage juice is a favorite among health enthusiasts. It detoxifies the body, enhances blood circulation, and accelerates metabolism. High in fiber, it supports weight loss, particularly around the belly area, while promoting overall vitality.

# 9. Orange Juice

Rich in vitamin C, orange juice acts as a powerful antioxidant that fights free radicals and boosts immunity. Regular consumption helps manage diabetes, reduce cholesterol, and protect against cancer and other diseases.

# 10. Coconut Water

Coconut water is an excellent source of antioxidants and essential minerals like zinc, copper, and calcium. It strengthens the immune system, supports hydration, and offers protection against oxidative stress. However, it should be consumed in moderation due to its sodium content.

# 11. Cranberry Juice

Cranberry juice is widely known for its antioxidant and cleansing properties. It helps remove toxins and free radicals, supports digestive health, and is beneficial for preventing urinary tract infections. Its anti-inflammatory effects also reduce cancer and diabetes risks.

# 12. White Tea

White tea contains the highest concentration of catechins, powerful antioxidants that protect against cell damage and aging. It supports cancer prevention, reduces inflammation, and delays the effects of aging. White tea‚Äôs high antioxidant content makes it a potent ally in prostate care.

>The prostate and urinary tract are warm and moist environments, perfect for fungus and mold to grow and thrive. This causes an infection called ‚ÄúFungal Prostatitis‚Äù, which eventually leads to an inflamed prostate.

>üîë Solution: [FlowForce Max is a ‚Äúprostate-shrinking soft candy‚Äù that helps clear out the fungus that actually causes BPH, both from the prostate and the urinary tract](https://freedom-man-wind.blogspot.com/2024/12/discover-power-of-flowforce-max.html).

>We made sure the formula has great bioavailability so that every ingredient could get delivered to the urinary tract fast, resulting in rapid relief.

By integrating these antioxidant-rich drinks into your diet, you not only enhance your overall health but also take proactive steps to support prostate care. Each drink brings unique benefits, from reducing cancer risks to improving metabolism and immune health. Start including these beverages in your daily routine to cleanse your body, protect your cells, and boost your vitality.

Part 4,"Haven't really been feeling myself, but I wanted to keep you guys updated. You can check out part 3 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/IZBYj6vmOH)

I began ending my days by flipping through my brother‚Äôs journal. The words were clear, but their meaning was elusive, like trying to grasp smoke. Each page felt heavier than the last, tangled in metaphors and poetic musings that hinted at something just out of reach. I read anyway. It felt like an obligation, a way to understand him. But the deeper I went, the more I felt the sting of guilt.

The signs had been there‚Äîhis late-night calls, the silence when I asked about his work‚Äîbut I ignored them. I told myself it was just his way of being distant, that it wasn‚Äôt my place to press. Now I couldn‚Äôt stop wondering: If I‚Äôd asked more questions, would he still be here? Or had I always been too late?

When Caitlin‚Äôs stream would start, I found a strange sort of escape. Her countdown timer would blink on the screen, and my heart would race. I‚Äôd sink into the couch, laptop on the coffee table, and watch as her stream lit up the night. It was a ritual‚Äîa way to unwind, though it came at the cost of sleep.

Her streams followed a familiar rhythm. She‚Äôd start with lighthearted chatter, calling out usernames, and I‚Äôd stay quiet, letting the initial banter wash over me. But every now and then, her gaze would shift, and I‚Äôd swear her eyes caught mine through the screen. My username would appear, playful words teasing me to join the conversation.

At first, I resisted. I wasn‚Äôt the type to seek attention, but Caitlin had a way of pulling me in. Her questions felt personal, her tone inviting. And for a brief moment, I felt like I mattered‚Äîlike I was part of something bigger.

The riddles became my favorite part of her streams. I told myself I didn‚Äôt care about being clever, that I wasn‚Äôt there to impress anyone, but when she posed a challenge, I couldn‚Äôt help myself. Her teasing jabs, playful yet pointed, only fueled the desire to answer correctly. It wasn‚Äôt just about solving the riddle. It was about being seen by her.

Her voice lingered long after the streams ended, a quiet hum in the back of my mind. Her laugh, her smile‚Äîthey followed me through my day, reshaping my thoughts without my permission.

At the workbench, surrounded by tools and wood shavings, my focus wavered. I found myself daydreaming of her, picturing her walking into my workshop, her eyes lighting up at the sight of something I‚Äôd built. I imagined her asking questions, wanting to learn more about what drove me to create. It was ridiculous, of course. But in those moments, the fatigue of the day felt a little lighter.

Eventually, those daydreams crept into my work. I started altering my signature‚Äîa small ‚ÄúC‚Äù carved after my name, a quiet acknowledgment that, if Caitlin ever noticed me, I‚Äôd be ready.

The long days began to blur. My mistakes piled up‚Äîimproper cuts, wasted materials, and a workbench cluttered with frustration. I told myself I‚Äôd clean it once the job was done, but the mess grew with every project.

One day, while nailing a shelf into place, my hand slipped. The wood split, and the nail bent. I removed it and stuffed it into my pocket, promising to fix the damage later. But as I held the broken board in my hands, I felt a surge of disappointment that I couldn‚Äôt shake.

That night, I tried to read my brother‚Äôs journal, but my mind was too tired to make sense of it. Instead, I lay down for a quick nap, fighting the guilt of setting aside my responsibilities. I told myself I needed the rest, that watching Caitlin‚Äôs stream was still part of my search. Her presence in the journal made her a clue, one I couldn‚Äôt ignore.


---

I woke hours later, disoriented. The room was dark, and a wave of unease prickled through me. I checked the time‚ÄîCaitlin‚Äôs stream was about to start. I hadn‚Äôt missed it.

The laptop glowed on the coffee table, her countdown timer flashing on the screen. My pulse quickened as I whispered the seconds down. But something felt... off.

When the stream began, Caitlin‚Äôs usual warmth was gone. Her smile, once so inviting, felt hollow. Her energy, always so infectious, was muted. She went through the motions, but her heart wasn‚Äôt in it.

The stream dragged on, and I couldn‚Äôt sit still. For the first time, I wondered how I‚Äôd ever been able to watch for so long. She must have had a bad day too, I thought. She wasn‚Äôt untouchable‚Äîshe was just another person.

That realization stung. I‚Äôd turned her into an idol without even realizing it. My daydreams felt foolish now, even shameful. I forced myself to finish the stream, not out of desire, but as penance for putting her on a pedestal she didn‚Äôt belong on.

Then something changed.

As I rubbed my eyes, trying to stave off the fatigue, I noticed my other hand in my pocket. My fingertips brushed against the nail I‚Äôd stashed earlier. Its cool, solid presence was comforting, grounding me in a way I couldn‚Äôt explain.

The laptop‚Äôs hum pulled my attention back to the screen. Caitlin had slumped forward, her gaze fixed on the chat window. Her eyes were bloodshot, her expression hollow. She looked... broken.

The chat buzzed with demands for her attention, fans begging for recognition, oblivious to her pain. Without thinking, I typed: ‚ÄúAre you okay? Get some rest.‚Äù

Her eyes flicked to the screen, locking with mine. For a moment, she held my gaze. Then, in a quiet, almost defeated voice, she told us she was ending the stream.

The video cut off abruptly, leaving the screen dark.

In the silence, her final words echoed in my mind, sharp and cutting.

‚ÄúWell, aren‚Äôt you a clever one?‚Äù

1haca2y,https://i.redd.it/kudmiji9du5e1.jpeg,Is Cumberlands Coffee any better since they stopped charging 99 cents for any size? ,"Not sure this is specifically an Upstate question and complicating things it is probably a subjective question, as I'm sure someone or some segment of people absolutely love Cumberland coffee. But since people are usually team Stewart's or team Cumbys I figured it was worth asking. 

I just looked at my price for a cup of tea from Cumberland, and it is $1.81 for a large. Not critiqueing the price, but I do remember when before Covid for as long as I can remember it was 99 cents for any size. Which I always thought was weird, because I'm sure many a person just got a large because why not or to share with a car mate. So Cumberland had to be losing money even if using the absolute worst quality coffee. 

I haven't had Cumberland coffee in years (iced was always worse than the hot) because i found it absolutely terrible. Did they improve it with the price increase? I know the last time I had any Cumberland coffee was 2022 and it was an iced and I regretted it as soon as I walked out, I drank a few sips and tossed it. It is basically water and once the ice melts a little it is brown water, and if you even add an eye dropper of milk it taste like brown milk water. This was I'm pretty sure after the price increase but it's now almost 3 years later and I would assume they swung the other way and are losing sales in the coffee if it remains that bad. 

To be fair I don't love Stewarts coffee but it's absolutely drinkable and I probably have it once or twice a week, especially the decaf when I want a warm drink after some outdoor activities. I don't usually add sugar but if they have the eggnog out I use that instead of milk, eggnog coffee is the best. I do, however, love stewart's brewed tea when I want some caffeine. 

I always assumed you got what you paid for, but now that Cumberland is more in line with most places, did they improve it?

(and to answer the obvious question, why don't I just try it, because I'd rather burn a $1 or use it as toilet paper than waste it on undrinkable coffee). ",3,1733758199.0,upstate_new_york,6,0.71,False

**Aka Akasaka on the Conclusion of „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë**

**With the conclusion of „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë, Aka Akasaka reflects: ""There are plenty of things I like. But above all, the weight of responsibility...""**

The hugely popular manga „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë has ended in issue 50 of ""Weekly Young Jump"" on November 14, after 4 and a half years of publication. We spoke with Aka Akasaka, the main creator, about his thoughts regarding the conclusion.

**Interview Excerpt**

**‚Äì„ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë's publication has ended after approximately 4 and a half years. How do you feel right now?**

*Aka Akasaka*: I want to take it easy for the time being. There are other things I want to add to my daily routine.

**‚ÄìDoes that mean you couldn't enjoy life during publication?**

*Aka*: Compared to when I was making ""Kaguya-sama wants to be confessed to: The Geniuses War of Love and Brain"" (Kaguya-sama for short), this was way better. I had no life during that time (laughs). Now, by putting all my effort solely into writing, I've slowly started to think ""I can focus on my life a bit more"". Currently, I'm even thinking ""I want to do some farm work too"".

**‚ÄìYou've said you were sure „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë would be a big project from the beginning. Could you clarify this? Did things go as you expected until the end?**

*Aka*: Yes, the ending went as I expected. But there are parts of „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë that I had and had not decided at the beginning.

I used to be the type of writer who could plan everything from the start and follow through with it, but I changed after ""Kaguya-sama"". There are occasions when a character's hidden side, which even the writer hadn't noticed initially, would suddenly come to light. And I wanted to be the kind of writer who could treat such discoveries as important aspects of the character's personality.

As a result, it became impossible for me to decide every single aspect of the story beforehand. I thought of „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë as a manga in which I placed huge importance on the characters despite having already decided on its ending. Perhaps this has become a quirk of mine?

**‚ÄìA prime example of this is ""Mem-Cho"", correct? It's well known that you took a liking to her after seeing Mengo-sensei's drawing and promoted her from a minor to a main character. Are there other characters that underwent similar ""changes of plan""?**

*Aka*: That would be Aqua. He became quite subtle with his emotions. Initially, Aqua was someone who would act with his heart on his sleeve, but in the second half of the story, he turns into someone who never reveals his emotions, keeping them secret even from the readers.

**‚ÄìIs this the result of realizing the character possessed more depth than initially thought?**

*Aka*: It was more like ""Plenty of experiences ended up giving birth to plenty of emotions"". Through those experiences, his inner emotions became messy. It wasn't entirely kind of me not to show this to the readers, but that was one of the things I wanted to do with „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë.

**‚ÄìIn the past few years, we've had several big hits like ""Evangelion"", ""Attack on Titan"", and ""Jujutsu Kaisen"" reaching their conclusions. I consider „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë to be a hit alongside them. Was there anything about ending such a successful manga that worried you?**

*Aka*: I think there has been an increase in manga that end up being quite short. In this industry of fast consumption, there is a strong desire to let ""interesting works"" conclude as such. Being able to end my work at my own pace and in my own style makes me appreciate the current times as an artist.

Though, for „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë, I wished I could continue the manga as long as the anime is airing (laughs).

**‚ÄìThat's unexpected (laughs).**

*Aka*: But I had to consider Mengo-sensei too. I believe both of us want our readers to continue reading our subsequent works, so we had to maintain the quality until the very end.

**‚ÄìIn a previous interview, you mentioned feeling awkward about keeping Mengo-sensei bound to „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë for too long, is that correct?**

*Aka*: Of course, that aspect was important too. Mengo-sensei draws by herself. The project's beginning involved me bowing my head and asking her for a favor. In part, I feel „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë was a selfish desire of mine.

For that reason, I wanted to end it on a high note. I've always had the feeling that ""I want to deliver a good ending for both the readers and Mengo-sensei"".

**‚Äì„ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë has become a cultural phenomenon due to its anime adaptation and the opening theme ""Idol"" by YOASOBI. What are your thoughts on witnessing such a phenomenon?**

*Aka*: „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë was my first work after I announced my decision to stop drawing and focus on writing. Honestly, it got me thinking, ""It will be tough to do better than this"". As a result, the hurdle for my next project got so high that I even thought, ""Can I even overcome this?"" (Laughs). Growing crops might be a better option‚Ä¶

**‚ÄìNo, growing crops is good, but I want to see what you have next in store.**

*Aka*: Okay (laughs).

**‚Äì(Laughs) Has this cultural phenomenon had any influence on „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë itself?**

*Aka*: Of course, I think it has had an impact. In the first place, when I started „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë, I had this idea in mind: ""I want to do this with someone"". In fact, there are parts of „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë's production that embody this aspect of ""working with others"" - the anime and the opening song being two examples. I keep in mind that many groups are involved with „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë, working together as one.

You could even say that one of the themes present in the story is ""Working with others""... at least in part. I was depicting the miscommunication in an industry where you need to rely on others for projects like manga, anime, plays, and other things that ""You can't do alone"", as well as the interactions between favorites and fans.

**‚ÄìDid this desire of working with others come from your experiences when drawing ""Kaguya-sama""?**

*Aka*: I think I grew up a little through ""Kaguya-sama"".

When a work starts to spread, it's not just the manga itself, but also the various marketing and advertisements, as well as the work of the publisher, which contribute to its spread.

It made me realize my limits and the importance of working together with other people. That was a big experience.

**‚ÄìThe one closest to you in all of this was fellow ""Oshi no Ko"" creator, Mengo-sensei. Have you talked with her about the ""Oshi no Ko"" phenomenon?**

*Aka*: Sometimes we end up having conversations about it when we meet in person. Both of us have different ways of perceiving ""Oshi no Ko""'s success. It's just that such success brings us ""joy"" and ""fear"" at the same time, yet I feel both of us mainly focus on the ""fear"" part in our conversations.

Of course, there are plenty of things we're happy about, but ""the weight of responsibility got even heavier"". That, I believe, is a mutual sentiment I have with Mengo-sensei.

**‚Äì One of the aspects of „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë that left an impact on the public was the number of times it depicted social media scandals.**

*Aka*: When making „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë, I had in mind the idea of ""Presenting a modern type of show business"". And it had a big influence. For example, many older manga already presented plenty of ""show business"" types, so giving a modern touch to our manga helped differentiate Oshi no Ko from the rest.

I've also included some personal experiences in the story. For example, since the chances mangakas have to meet their fans are mostly limited to signings and other events, their mental image of fans is mostly shaped by what they see on social media.

And many idols who use social media share a similar experience. Not to mention YouTubers and many other modern professions. For them, ""Fans = The people they see on social media"", so I gave more attention to showing that side.

**‚Äì „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë was your first work after deciding to focus on writing, but what were some things that were only possible because you were working alongside Mengo-sensei?**

*Aka*: The reason why it became such a success among young readers, without a doubt, is thanks to Mengo-sensei. Her art is the biggest example of something I could never do on my own. That's why I can say my desire for „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë to be something ""I want to do with someone else"" came true.

It was a work which truly represented the definition of what a collaboration should be.

**‚ÄìHow was the experience of having the storyboards and final drawings made by someone other than yourself?**

*Aka*: Mengo-sensei and I have similar tastes, but since we're different people, there will be parts where we aren't fully in sync. But since I want to create storyboards which could leave an aftertaste hinting at our creative differences, it was incredibly easy for me to do so.

Besides, I was given plenty of opportunities to learn from her. For example, how to apply detailed compositions, and how to present the manga's atmosphere and tempo to the readers.

The abilities and trump cards that experienced mangakas have are comparable to a certain extent, thus, it becomes a matter of personal preference as to when and how they play these cards.

In that respect, when working with Mengo-sensei, there were many occasions where she decided ""I'll play this card"" and surprised me. That's where I was influenced by her.

**‚ÄìWith the arrival of the final chapter, what type of work do you feel „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë has become in the end?**

*Aka*: That's something that I, myself, have been reflecting on. ""Just what is „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë?""

**‚ÄìYou wondered about that precisely because its serialization is coming to an end, correct?**

*Aka*: The meaning of „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë, the thing I decided I wanted to express through this work, has been decided since the beginning. That is ""Miscommunication"". In other words, ""What does it mean to get involved with other people?""

Particularly, in the relationships between idols and fans which „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë depicts, there are many twisted aspects that run counter to what is natural. How does one deal with such twisted things with a healthy mind? I guess, depicting that is, in other words, ""Depicting communication"".

Besides, as a creator, I naturally also have the feeling that ""If my readers can bring any of this back into the real world, if it's useful to them in any manner, I'll be glad"". I had tried the same thing with ""Kaguya-sama"".

**‚Äì Certainly, ""Kaguya-sama"" may have been comedic, but the ""miscommunication"" was there right from the beginning.**

*Aka*: ""People that can't properly hold a relationship because of communication"" are an aspect which I've consistently wanted to include in my stories, so, in the end, I think it all comes down to that. And it's present in „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë, the communication in the entertainment industry, the miscommunication between idols and fans, and the like.

I wrote this with a ""Wish"" that these people can gradually get better at communicating with each other with the right approach. That's what I think Oshi no Ko is about.

**‚ÄìWe could say that this is one of your peculiarities as a writer. But, what exactly made you decide to tackle such a theme of ""Human communication"" so seriously?**

*Aka*: I believe that I'm not good at communicating with others, but the people around me often tell me that I am, in fact, good at communicating.

**‚ÄìI agree. I don't have any problems talking to you in person.**

*Aka*: When I was in high school, I frequently did something similar to what Akane Kurokawa (one of the main characters of „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë) does.

**‚ÄìEh?**

*Aka*: Like trying to analyze other people, and study their behaviors.

**‚ÄìAh! Akane Kurokawa used this analysis to profile other people and incorporate it into her acting, correct?**

*Aka*: I'd use this to learn things like ""Ah, when this happens, that person feels uncomfortable or unpleasant"". And this saved my life back then.

So, I want to share part of my experience with readers. Basically, ""This made my life a bit easier, so I hope it can also help other people with similar problems"".

**‚ÄìEven if it is in manga form, it's as if you were passing the baton you received to the next runner.**

*Aka*: For that reason, when creating manga, I picture myself in my mind as ""the good guy"", in the sense that I make manga with good intentions. Of course, there is a certain pretentious side to that, but I create manga because I have such a desire.

For example, if by my depiction of the inner workings of the entertainment industry, any reader starts to reflect ""This is certainly a problem, we should pay more attention to it"", I'd be glad. For me, the feeling after finishing reading is important, thus, I hope I can instill a good action in those who read it, even if it is just a small one. I wish to make the world happier with manga, even if it is just a tiny bit.

**‚ÄìYou could say it is a work with many ""wishes"" in it.**

*Aka*: That's right. Of course, there are people that may find it unpleasant to portray the insides of the idol's industry.

But, if I can depict what many idols want to say but can't, and if this helps their situation even a little, I'm fine with causing a bit of discomfort.

**‚ÄìLastly, may I ask about the kind of jobs and stories you want to work on in the future?**

*Aka*: Oh yeah! I'm tired so I want to take a small break.

**‚ÄìBut of course. (Laugh)**

*Aka*: (Laugh) However, no matter how much I want to take a break, I still want to create new stories. Even now, I still have ideas that get me thinking ""Hey, isn't this quite good?"" popping out all of a sudden. I love ""Scum's Wish"", which is the title of one of Mengo-sensei's works. I've wanted to make a story with a title that evokes a similar feeling for a long time.

On that note, recently, a nice title came to mind.

It will be a story that started from its title, but at the same time, it also contains my desire to create manga. I'm preparing some other storyboards which I'll be working on as well.

**‚ÄìOh, you sure have piqued my interest.**

*Aka*: My intention is to continue working as a writer, so I have the strong desire of creating something that matches the quirks of the collaborating artist.

**‚ÄìYou announced your transition from being a mangaka to focusing only on writing stories for manga in 2022, when Oshi no Ko was being serialized and Kaguya-sama had just ended serialization. This announcement became a huge talking point at that time, but can I get some words from you about this decision again now?**

*Aka:*¬†I had a strong desire to create many stories. When I was spending time drawing, I would often think, ""I want to create new storyboards.""

**‚ÄìIt's not rare for manga to have separate writers and artists, but declaring the intention to not draw caused a big impact.**

*Aka:*¬†Time was the primary reason, but at the same time, there are many people more skilled than me in drawing. I still draw when I feel like it, but these days, it is more of a hobby to me.

**‚ÄìHow did your colleagues react to it?**

*Aka:*¬†Whenever a fellow mangaka asks me ""Why did you announce that?"" I would answer with ""Because I don't want to draw"", and the conversation would end there. (laughs)

**‚ÄìYour fellow professionals generally don't talk about it‚Ä¶ (Laugh)**

*Aka:*¬†But, in that sense, I also just don't relate to the feelings of people who want to make their own drawings. What made me start as a mangaka was my desire to write stories. Conversely, I'd like to ask other mangaka, ""If someone told you that you could focus only on story writing in manga, would you?""

**‚ÄìYes, I'm curious about what the answer would be.**

*Aka:*¬†I think my announcement caused such a reaction because mangakas, for the most part, like to draw. Probably, they are the type that need to both create the story and draw it to feel satisfied. I, on the other hand, am the type that can just look at my storyboard and think ""This character is so cute.""

**‚ÄìI see.**

*Aka:*¬†My message to the chief editors at Shueisha was straightforward: ""I won't draw anymore"" (Laugh). ""If that's fine with you, let's keep working together.""

**‚ÄìIt has been roughly 2 years since the announcement, do you think it was the right call?**

*Aka:*¬†Yes, I do. It made things easier for me, the chief editors, and the industry in general. Now, they don't have to worry about giving me illustration work (Laugh).

**‚ÄìThat's right (Laugh).**

*Aka:*¬†And, focusing solely on the story made things so much easier. Drawing requires constant improvement. Not to mention studying and replenishing materials. The scariest part is that the evolution of new art styles is always changing, and the number of skilled artists keeps growing. The effort needed to keep up would make me worry a lot, and definitely has more costs than benefits.

**‚Äì I believe that being a writer also requires constant improvement. Do you consider these skills to come more naturally to you compared to those of an artist?**

*Aka:*¬†That's right. Not only do I find it more fun, but it's also something I want to do. Part of me feels like: ""If I always continue to draw, I'll gradually not want to improve any further."" Therefore, I want to work with someone who will give their 100% in drawing. Of course, it's not enough to just be good at drawing; they need to be good at drawing manga.

**‚ÄìTaking that into consideration, since you had this desire to write since the beginning, does that mean that you drew ""Kaguya-sama"" reluctantly?**

*Aka:*¬†Actually, I had thought ""I'm not cut out for manga."" But, in order to become a writer, I had to take that first step as a mangaka. I mean, if someone with no achievements walked into the office and said ""I'm a writer, please get me a really good artist,"" that's not going to happen.

**‚ÄìThat surely looks to be the case.**

*Aka:*¬†After I had a few works under my belt, I thought ""Now is the time,"" went to Shueisha and said ""Please, let me work solely as a writer,"" and I got rejected. That's how ""Kaguya-sama"" started.

**‚ÄìWhat an amazing story considering the huge hit Kaguya became. So, was it because of the success of ""Kaguya-sama"" that you were able to focus on writing?**

*Aka:*¬†Correct. If it wasn't for ""Kaguya-sama,"" „ÄêOSHI NO KO„Äë couldn't have turned out the way it did. For that reason, I have no regrets for drawing ""Kaguya-sama,"" nor do I hold any grudge against the chief editors of Shueisha. I'm so glad I did that. I was so anxious about whether I would even be able to do it, and actually managing it was an incredible experience.

**‚ÄìWe've talked about improvement, but I consider research to be a cornerstone for any author. What part of life has given you the most input?**

*Aka:*¬†The internet. To start, aren't there many things in which men and women have completely different views? That's why, to see both perspectives, I would often look at sites where women would gather to express their real thoughts. Such research had a huge impact when creating ""Kaguya-sama,"" a story with a female protagonist. On the internet, I could find opinions which women wouldn't generally say face to face, in an unfiltered manner. I don't think I would have been able to make ""Kaguya-sama"" without this.Previously, I said that ""Doing something similar to Akane Kurokawa made my life easier,"" and this might be the best example of it. Until then, I wasn't able to picture how other people thought, but with the information I found on the internet, I could begin to assemble hypotheses like ""So, this is how people are,"" and turn this into manga.

**‚ÄìSo your research came mostly from the internet, and the communication and unrestricted expression found there. That's unexpected.**

*Aka:*¬†When I create characters, I put a big emphasis on ""How did their personality turn out this way?"" In that sense, depicting episodes from my past and elaborating on my own secrets are things that I like doing.

**‚ÄìYou are currently 36 years old, and yet, you have already finished 2 popular publications. May I ask if you have any specific technique to come up with such hits? Is there any specific working routine?**

*Aka:*¬†There is no routine, more like ""I'll do it if I'm in a hurry"" (Laugh)

.**‚ÄìSo you're the type of guy who is inspired by the deadline (Laugh).**

*Aka:*¬†Also, there are occasions where I just forget things or can't focus. Researching about this peculiarity, and learning how people in a similar situation dealt with it, was very important. And through that, I learned when to say ""It can't be helped = Give up"" or ""I can deal with it.""

**‚Äì""Analyzing and making hypotheses"" also came in handy for this, huh?**

*Aka:*¬†Yes, especially when I physically deal with it. Something like ""If I can't get work done at home, then I'll go outside."" I mean, you can't play games if there aren't any games around. Sometimes, I also pay a visit to Shueisha; that's another way of dealing with my problem. I think it's good to count on other people's help, and I try to physically deal with my peculiarities as much as possible.

**‚ÄìThe environment you are in has a strong influence on you, huh?**

*Aka:*¬†I try to honestly accept, understand, and deal with my weaknesses. Thanks to that, I managed to reach 35 years of age.

**‚ÄìThere has been a lot of talk about the effects of the rough environment of weekly publications. Is there anything about your health you are careful with?**

*Aka:*¬†It's not exactly a conscious effort, but my body literally can't cope with burning the midnight oil anymore (laugh). I sleep once it gets dark. I've also been sleeping earlier. After all, Shigeru Mizuki-sensei once said ""Sleep to not die young,"" so I've made it a point to always get proper sleep.

**‚ÄìYou can't stay up at night like in your 20s, but that's a good thing, huh?**

*Aka:*¬†Correct (Laugh). Stopping with the energy drinks was also a huge change. I still drink a bit of coffee, but since I realized too much sugar isn't good for me, water became quite tasty.

**‚ÄìThere is a big difference between energy drinks and water, huh?**

*Aka:*¬†To deal with this, I buy a bunch of water and unflavored sparkling water packages, and the housekeeper puts them in the fridge. On that note, being able to rely on housekeeping services is a big thing for me. I'm unable to do housework, so I've given up on doing it myself and started to employ housekeeping services. I changed my thinking to ""I work to earn the money to hire housekeeping services."" I'm very glad I was able to resolve these various problems that bothered me.

**‚Äì""Understand your particularities, and physically deal with them."" That's powerful advice for anyone, huh?**

*Aka:*¬†I agree. I used to say ""I can do this"" back then, but I gradually learned to say ""I can't."" When I am late, instead of saying ""I will arrive in 5 minutes"" and then take 10, I first say ""It will take 10 minutes"" and try to get there in 5.

**‚ÄìThat's quite important (Laugh).**

*Aka:*¬†For me, part of becoming an adult is to stop overselling yourself. That way, you avoid disappointing others. Yet, if it's for a manuscript, I will still say ""It's okay, I'll do it by tonight"" from time to time‚Ä¶ (Laugh).

**‚Äì(Laugh). Lastly, as a 36 year old, is there anything you want to do before hitting 40?**

*Aka:*¬†Working out. I have tried many times in the past, but was never able to keep going. It's something I really want to do. I'm dumbfounded by my total inability to control myself.I feel that if I manage to work out, it will be the moment my peculiarity finally changes. That's the ""me"" I want to become. That's my ultimate goal.

I know I didn‚Äôt. Personally I never had one as a kid and if I‚Äôm being honest I never knew anyone that did. My son Christian is 7 and since he was a toddler he has always had a big imagination. From your typical Nerf battles to booking an entire pay-per view for his wrestling action figures, Chris always found a way to keep himself entertained. He really is such a good kid, he always means well. Although Chris is a sweetheart, let‚Äôs just say he is a little socially awkward. He struggled making friends, even in preschool he generally kept to himself. So you can imagine my excitement the one day he came home from school and said he made a new friend. I was so proud of him, this was a big step for the little guy. Even though he was only 7 I thought it was great that he finally was getting along with another kid. 



Ever since we moved Chris had been struggling even more than normal. Maybe it was the new environment that he wasn‚Äôt used to or maybe it was the whole ‚Äúnot fitting in‚Äù thing. Hearing crying and sniffling in the middle of the night became the normal for a few weeks. It truly broke my heart. But hearing about this friend Chris made, maybe it would help him to get better. He really did deserve to be happy. We had downsized and moved to a smaller town because I lost my job. My wife Alyssa was now the sole breadwinner. While that was not ideal the best I could do now was to be a good father and husband while I looked for a new job. 



The day Chris came home to tell me about his new friend I was browsing the internet searching for a new job. It had been another unsuccessful search. Chris busted through the front door out of breath. 



‚ÄúDaddy!! I did it! I made a friend! His name is Richie! He is the coolest! He has this super awesome Yo-yo that he showed me! DAD‚Ä¶I NEED IT FOR CHRISTMAS!!‚Äù 



I laughed and said ‚ÄúAlright buddy slow it down it‚Äôs only September! But tell me more about this new friend you made.‚Äù



‚ÄúDad he is so funny, everyone at school loves him and I know you will too!‚Äù



‚ÄúWell DUDE he is gonna have to come by one day so we can all eat pizza and watch some wrestling!‚Äù



‚ÄúOH MY GOSH THAT WILL BE SO AWESOME!!‚Äù



Chris excitedly ran to his room and I yelled down the hall ‚ÄúGet started on your homework and let me know if you need any help!‚Äù 



I haven‚Äôt been this happy in weeks. As a dad and husband you just want your family to be happy. After seeing the look on my son‚Äôs face, I couldn‚Äôt help but to smile from ear to ear. When my wife came home I couldn‚Äôt wait to tell her the news. I know it may not sound like the biggest deal to you but that little boy is our world and seeing him down in the dumps really crushed us. Alyssa was just as excited as I was that Chris seemed like he had finally settled in. She went to his room to hear the news straight from him. I was sitting there eavesdropping when I heard Alyssa yell out ‚ÄúBabe?!‚Äù In a worried voice. 



I made my way towards Chris‚Äô room and once I got through the door my wife was pointing at Chris. With a smile on her face she said ‚ÄúHoney, who is this big boy and what has he done with our little baby?!‚Äù 



Chris chuckled and said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still me Ma, I just wanna look cool like Richie!‚Äù Chris was digging through his closet trying to find his favorite Ninja Turtle sweatshirt.



That night before bed my wife and I shared a look. We were happy, the first time we‚Äôve been happy since we had to move.

We shared a kiss and went to bed.



For the next week or so Chris would come home as happy as can be. He would tell me about what he was learning in school and how Richie was just the ‚Äúbestest‚Äù friend. He would tell me about all the new toys Richie had and how he would let Chris play with them. I told Chris if they ever planned on hanging out outside of school I would need to meet his parents. Chris said he knows that but not to worry because Richie told him his parents said they weren‚Äôt allowed to hang outside of school. I thought that was strange but just chalked it up to Richie‚Äôs parents being strict. When I mentioned to Alyssa about Richie not being able to hang outside of school she told me not to worry about it. She told me Chris was happy, WE were happy, and things were finally going smooth. She was right, Chris was fitting in and our home life as a family was great because of it.



As the school year went on I did notice something. It was pretty obvious because we were tight on cash, ya know due to the whole ‚Äújobless‚Äù thing. Chris would come home from school and almost weekly would have some sort of new toy he was playing with. A hot wheels car, Hess truck, airplane, wrestler, basketball. All things we didn‚Äôt buy him. Whenever I asked him about it he would always tell me the same thing. ‚ÄúRichie let me borrow it!‚Äù While I didn‚Äôt think it was necessarily strange for kids to share toys. I did think it was strange that it was almost every week. Where is Richie getting these toys. It was a relatively small town and to my knowledge it wasn‚Äôt a particularly wealthy area, so I doubted someone could afford all these toys.



When I brought up the toy situation with Alyssa she did seem a bit concerned. She was wondering the same thing I was. Where were these toys coming from.



‚ÄúOkay this is gonna sound bad. Do you think Chris is taking these toys from the school or maybe even a student? Is Richie even real?‚Äù As the words left my mouth I realize it sounded much worse than what I had imagined. Chris was a bit of a different kid, sure. But he wasn‚Äôt a liar. At least I didn‚Äôt think so. Maybe I was jumping to conclusions. Take a look from my perspective though. We are hearing all these amazing things about ‚ÄúRichie‚Äù. Chris has never once mentioned him coming over, sleeping over, or even going over to Richie‚Äôs house. He didn‚Äôt talk about any other friends or students. He came home with a different toy almost weekly and always had the same excuse as to how he got it.



Alyssa looked at me with worried eyes. ‚ÄúGod, I hope not. Things were finally starting to look up.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell I am going to ask him about it and see what he says.‚Äù



As I made my way down the stairs to Chris‚Äô room I thought I heard something. It sounded like muffled talking coming from his room but I couldn‚Äôt quite make out what was being said. I stopped in my tracks and thought for a second. What if Chris was struggling so much to fit in he made Richie up. What if Richie is what Chris wants a friend to be. What If Richie is Chris‚Äô imaginary friend. My heart sank. I hoped that wasn‚Äôt the case but that would certainly explain some things. The lack of other friends, the fact that Chris never asked if Richie could come over, and now the talking. What if Chris was talking to his imaginary friend. What do I say, what do I do? Will this just be a phase? I didn‚Äôt have the answers. Standing around in the hallway wasn‚Äôt going to get me any either. I knocked on Chris‚Äô door and walked inside.



‚ÄúHey dude, how‚Äôs school going?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs soooo good dad‚Äù



‚ÄúOh yeah why‚Äôs that? Let me guess, Richie?‚Äù I said with a forced smile



‚ÄúYeah! He is the best! He is always giving me stuff, like these toys!‚Äù



‚ÄúI wanted to ask you about that Chris, are you um, are you sure Richie is giving you these toys?‚Äù



‚ÄúWhatcha mean daddy?‚Äù



‚ÄúAre you taking them from the school maybe? Another kid? You know, just borrowing them of course.‚Äù



Chris sat there for a second and seemed to be thinking. ‚ÄúNo dad, Richie is giving me these toys. I told you that! What did ya forget or something?‚Äù He started giggling.



I smiled at him and thought about how happy he was. I gave him a big hug and left his room. I spent the whole night just thinking to myself, what am I gonna do about this? 



It had been a few days since my little talk with Chris. He hasn‚Äôt mentioned Richie any more than usual and he hasn‚Äôt come home with any new toys. I had finally had luck with job searching. Funny enough as I was scrolling through endless pages I came across a job listing at Chris‚Äô school. It was for a janitor. I know it doesn‚Äôt sound like the most glorious job but I knew any amount of extra income would help. I applied and quickly received an email from the school to set up an interview for the next day. I knew Alyssa would be happy and I figured Chris would be too. Even though I would be working, at least it was at his school where I could see him throughout the day. If I‚Äôm being honest a little piece of me was eager to see if ‚ÄúRichie‚Äù was in fact a real kid and not some made up imaginary friend. 



I waited on the front porch to meet Chris as he got off the bus. We lived close to the school but just far enough away that he still required a bus. As Chris got off the bus I can see he had his head down. I met him in the street and asked what was wrong. When he looked at me I could tell he had been crying. He hadn‚Äôt cried in weeks, it had me worried.



‚ÄúChris what happened?! Are you okay?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo.‚Äù



‚ÄúTell me what‚Äôs wrong kiddo.‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Richie dad, he is leaving. He said he was moving and today was his last day.‚Äù He said as tears started to stream down his face.



‚ÄúOh man, I‚Äôm so sorry buddy. Come here.‚Äù I hugged him tight. I took his backpack off his shoulders and we continued towards the house. Chris didn‚Äôt leave his room for the rest of the night. He didn‚Äôt eat dinner. He just cried. When Alyssa came home I broke the news to her. She was upset but had hopes that Chris would be able to make some new friends. 



Alyssa was in the shower when I decided I would go check on Chris and say goodnight. I made my way down the stairs towards his room. I stopped moving when I heard Chris talking. I couldn‚Äôt quite make out what he was saying through the door but as I got closer to his room the words became more clear.



‚ÄúC‚Äômon Richie do you really have to go. We had so much fun. You are my best friend and I really wish you could just stay with me.‚Äù



Before I knocked on the door an odd feeling came over me. This all but proved that Richie wasn‚Äôt real. Who could he be talking to. He didn‚Äôt have a cell phone. Richie wasn‚Äôt in the house. I proceeded to knock on his door and enter the room. There was Chris, sitting on his bed, walkie-talkie in hand. Not knowing what else to say I asked him.



‚ÄúWho are you talking to?‚Äù



‚ÄúRichie, daddy, I was telling him I don‚Äôt want him to leave.‚Äù



‚ÄúRichie gave that to you? Richie is real?‚Äù



‚ÄúRichie is my friend dad, of course he is real.‚Äù



I took the walkie-talkie from his hand and pressed down the button.



‚ÄúHello!.. Who‚Äôs there?! ‚Ä¶ Is this Richie?! ‚Ä¶Answer me!‚Äù



There was no answer. No noise from whoever had the other walkie talkie. Silence. I proceeded to ask Chris about Richie.



‚ÄúRichie gave you this? Why? Does he live close by?‚Äù



‚ÄúI dunno, he gave it to me a while ago. We talk on it all the time.‚Äù



That must‚Äôve what I heard the other night. Chris was talking to Richie or whoever it was that had the other walkie-talkie. Richie must live close by. He has to be close to have a strong enough signal to talk to Chris. I took the walkie-talkie away from him. I kissed him on the head. Told him I loved him and that I would be taking him to school tomorrow. I didn‚Äôt even get to tell him that I was going to hopefully be working at his school. 



The next morning I made some eggs for me and Chris. I asked how he was feeling and he just shrugged. I assumed he was upset about Richie moving and he was angry that I took the walkie-talkie away. Regardless it was time to head to school. Once we parked I grabbed Chris from the backseat. He looked at me strangely.



‚ÄúDad whatcha doing? You‚Äôre supposed to drop me off.‚Äù



‚ÄúI know bud but today is different! I may get a job at your school, I‚Äôm here to talk to your principal! I may become your new janitor! Now I know-‚Äú I was cut off by Chris‚Äô cries. He ran into the school with tears streaming down his face. Did he really not want me to work at the school? Was it embarrassing to have your dad here or was it embarrassing that I may be a janitor? Either way I hurried to the principal‚Äôs office, I didn‚Äôt want to be late for the interview. I walked into the office right on time and spoke to the secretary. 



‚ÄúHello, I‚Äôm here to see Mr. Golding. I have an interview today.‚Äù



‚ÄúAh yes, you must be here for the janitor position that opened up. I‚Äôm really gonna miss the old one.‚Äù She chuckled. ‚ÄúI really never met a sweeter man. Anyway right this way Mr. Golding is waiting for you inside.‚Äù



I walked into the office with my head held high. I needed this job so I was there to impress. Mr. Golding was seated behind the desk but stood up as I walked into. He reached out a hand and I graciously excepted.



‚ÄúHello Mr. Golding, it‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to interview for this position.‚Äù



‚ÄúOf course Mr. Williams thank you for coming for the interview so quickly. We need to fill the position ASAP. As you can guess a school can get quite messy.‚Äù 



‚ÄúI could only imagine. My son, Chris is a 2nd grader here and he is always making some sort of mess.‚Äù 



‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm being honest Mr. Williams after looking over your resume you are definitely more than qualified to work here. You seem like a man with a good head on his shoulders, you were punctual, and if I‚Äôm being honest because Richard left us so suddenly we are a bit desperate to fill his position. So if you would like it the job is yours!‚Äù



A giant smile spread across my face. The tension instantly released from my shoulders. I finally got another job. I was beyond happy. I quickly accepted the job without hesitiation.



‚ÄúThank you so much Mr. Golding! I promise you won‚Äôt regret this. You don‚Äôt understand how badly I needed this job!‚Äù



‚ÄúMr. Williams welcome aboard! I have the master keys here in this drawer let me just grab them.‚Äù Mr. Golding reached into his bottom drawer and pulled out a large set of keys. ‚ÄúEvery key is labeled, the Janitor‚Äôs equipment is in a supply container in the back of the school. Thank you for taking the job on short notice!‚Äù



I couldn‚Äôt believe how fast of a process that was. I figured there was going to be at least 1 more interview. The fact that I could start right away was all the more reason to be excited. I looked at the keys in my hand while walking down the hallway and decided I wanted to check out how the previous Janitor kept the equipment. As I approached the supply container I froze in place. In my excitement of getting the job I completely brushed past the fact the Janitor‚Äôs name was Richard. This couldn‚Äôt be THE Richie that Chris was talking about, could it? No, that didn‚Äôt make any sense. It had to be a coincidence. Richard is a common name. Plus this was a school. No way none of the teachers or students didn‚Äôt notice anything out of the ordinary. As I inserted the key into the lock my hands were shaking. I didn‚Äôt do a very good job of convincing myself that a grown man did not befriend my son. I twisted the key and removed the lock. 



What I found inside activated a concoction of feelings in me I had never felt at the same time. Rage, anguish, hate, nervousness, sadness all in one. The walls were lined with Children‚Äôs movie posters. Action figures spread about the small coffee table inside. Nerf guns laid on a dusty old couch. That‚Äôs when I saw it. A fucking walkie-talkie. The same walkie-talkie that Chris had the night before. Whoever this sick bastard was, was talking to my fucking 7 year old son. Tears started coming down my face like someone had turned on a faucet. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I was frozen in time. I started ripping the place apart. I don‚Äôt know if it was out of anger or if I was looking for something specific. I did not care I was just moving. Toys, snacks, candy. What the fuck. The last drawer I opened I truly wish I hadn‚Äôt. I was staring down at pictures. Pictures of my son. My son and this sick fuck ‚ÄúRichie‚Äù. Taking selfies together like it was some sort of fucked up prom picture. I had to leave. I ran to Chris‚Äô class picked him up and headed straight toward the exit. While holding my crying son, I began to breakdown. Chris whispered in my ear.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never be as cool as Richie.‚Äù

I‚Äôve had lessons with various instructors, some of them are really great and teach well, but a few have made me feel very uncomfortable.

Thankfully, I haven‚Äôt experienced any inappropriate physical contact, but I‚Äôve heard comments from different instructors that made me feel uneasy and distracted during lessons, including remarks about girls in bikinis, comments on my body proportions, suggesting I should become a model because it‚Äôs ""easy money,"" saying I look mature for my age, or offering to buy me coffee if they win 4D.

These comments make it hard for me to focus on driving, and sometimes I just want the lesson to end as quickly as possible. I‚Äôm sharing this because it feels like no one around me really understands how this affects me, and I‚Äôm curious if others have had similar experiences.",7,1733757699.0,drivingsg,3,1.0,False

1hac2r9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1hac2r9/why_does_the_sour_quality_of_sour_patch_kids/,Why does the sour quality of sour patch kids taste different and more bearable than the sour quality in most other sour foods? (It‚Äôs not just the added sugar),"I dislike sour foods and find many foods unbearably sour, including balsamic vinegar, pickles, fruity bright coffees, most salad dressings, lemon/key lime pie, hibiscus tea, all fruit tea, rhubarb, kimchi, and kombucha, all citrus, peaches, plums, grapes, kiwis, apples, passionfruit, and all berries. 

However, sour patch kids are delicious. And it's not only because of the sweetness overpowering the sourness because I've tried adding sugar to fruit and it's still too sour. And my inability to bear the sourness of very sweet lemon pie cancels this hypothesis. It feels like the sour quality itself of sour patch kids is different from the sour quality of the foods I listed above.  

So what makes sour patch kids an exception? Is there a chemically manufactured component that makes the sourness of sour patch kids bearable? 

I'm hoping there's a food science-based answer to this, like, ""citric acid is more potent in the wild than when manufactured.""",2,1733757644.0,NoStupidQuestions,3,1.0,False

1hac1mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1hac1mr/tips_and_advice_for_teenagersyoung_adult_from_a/,Tips and Advice for Teenagers/Young adult from a guy in his 20s,"Hey kids how are you doing? I still believe it was yesterday I was old as you but then life happened and now am half way into the 20s, and every new birthday feels same. Like year changes but not my face or anything. 

I wanted to write this to guide young teenagers here, I wish someone had told me all this when I was your age but sadly no one came through. So I will try to help you guys with stuff

1. Do **not take your teachers seriously** (especially those in school), **most of those who take teaching as profession don't take it up with passion and so for them it is a chore, t**hey are inadept in handling young adults and their advices can often have counterproductive results, take their advices from one year and drop them of the other
2. Some **teachers will change your life (their will be very few),** stick to them throughout your life cause their experiences is insurmountable 
3. What **matters after a while in life is personality**. A good personality can take you places even without academics but only academics won't drive you far enough
4. Marks **are not everything and not your license to be arrogant, being humble is most respected trait**
5. But do not let anyone make you feel **inferior**, if they do then you have all right to be arrogant and pompous over your marks 
6. **Health is wealth**\- smoking and drinking is not worth it, a good body is 1000 times better 
7. Take time **to do a lot of stuff and learn new stuff,** eventually people in 20s who have stuff to do are the happiest of the lot 
8. **Peer pressure is real,** you may not know **when you are being driven by your peers so saying ""no"" to something uncomfortable** \>>> indulging in something you don't want to
9. JEE and NEET are important but again nothing as important as **friends, good friends take you places. Ability to network takes you places**

Now suggestion only for boys who wanna find their girl

1. See **don't let society, parents, relatives misguide you-** the truth is finding a companion in life is first and foremost priority apart from getting well settled, dating is something you should do and it should be as much as part of life as anything else. Let me be frank and say those who don't sort dating in their teens find it troublesome at my age and are often regretting not so doing back as teenager 
2. Doesn't mean you give up **on studying all together but do both.**. spare an hour/two for personality development and dating a day. 

Now how to find girls

See now I cannot give u surrogate suggestions but if you want guerrilla suggestions then this is what works

1.  **Confidence**: Girls love guys that are confident and comfortable in their skins, this means ability to say no, have passion, have courage and ability to guide their way through
2. Girls **generally date boys that are well liked by their friends and peer,** it is often a popularity thing so one sure way to her heart is for her group of friends to like you
3. **Good haircut, Good clothes, Good smell, Good shoes, Clean face and skin, Low body fat and an athletic body is the way to go**
4. There is no use **being desperate, what drives many girls crazy is your ability to handle a ""no"".. if you walk away after a no you earn her respect, if you pester her- you lose your respect**
5. The only solution to **asking her out is asking her out fair and direct and then taking her answer well- but drop words** like coffee/doing Homework together and not something big that freaks her out. 
6. Girls **talk among themselves about everything so yeah she want to date more than you do and already know who likes her who does not so not point beating around the bush, so be clear of your intentions** 
7. No one is not **handsome/attractive**\- do whatever i said in point 3 and you are good to go
8. Have genuine **passions and hobby**, know what you like by doing several things and then be crazy about it (like 1-2 hours a day apart from your studies) 
9. Be visible in **school/college, let people know you through your work and achievements-** do not be overtly active on college groups with lots of people and within toxic environment. **Nothing speaks louder than success, especially the one that comes without noise**

Finally few final points (mainly for boys)

1. Wear leather jacket (okay this was my high school dream) 
2. M**ost high school relationships will fail but doesn't mean they are not worth it, nothing brings maturity faster than girls. Unkept and unserious guys turn all serious and focused with their girls** 
3. The best way to deal with **bullies is not care of them, if they torment you a lot, go to the authorities**
4. People are **better during teens and turn nastier in 20s, so yeah it won't get better but you will learn as you go**
5. What sticks **along are memories, I don't remember any of my marks (except Boards) but I remember the time I spent with my friends- don't sacrifice this for a fleeting future** ",9,1733757562.0,TeenIndia,7,0.91,False

It‚Äôs addressed to me, complete with my full name, address, phone number, and email‚Äîbasically my whole bio.

When they sent me a picture of what we got, I almost died laughing‚Äîa third-rate fake teeth whitening serum. Like seriously? Do I look like someone trying to audition for a Colgate ad?

Here‚Äôs the kicker:
	1.	The product‚Äôs MRP is ‚Çπ1999 (yeah, right), but it‚Äôs listed on Flipkart for ‚Çπ250. Guess they thought adding a ‚Çπ449 stupidity tax would make it legit.
	2.	The package had no sender address and no invoice. And yet, the champs at Delhivery decided, ‚ÄúYup, looks legit‚Äîlet‚Äôs deliver it!‚Äù
	3.	When I contacted Delhivery to complain, their response was basically, ‚ÄúWhy are you even calling us? We‚Äôre just here to deliver crap, not care about it.‚Äù Useless shitbags.

From the back of my head, I can‚Äôt help but wonder: is Delhivery running these scams themselves? I mean, why else deliver a package with zero details? Is this their new business model?

Honestly, I‚Äôm more concerned about how these scammers got my data. Did I sign up for a shady offer? Did Flipkart accidentally leak my details? Or is this just the new norm in 2024?

So yeah, ‚Çπ699 gone, parents annoyed, and me now the proud owner of a serum I‚Äôll never use. Has anyone else dealt with something like this? Any tips on how to make these scammers and couriers regret their life choices?

I‚Äôve been TTC for two years. I‚Äôm currently 31, was diagnosed with Stage 4 endometriosis and my fertility specialist recommended IVF right away back in March. I was hesitant because to me, it just felt like an invasive procedure with lots of shots and doctors visits, so she agreed to let me try IUI. Surgery was also recommended but I was scared of this too and felt like I could manage the 2-4 really crappy days of my period that were the worst.

After two failed IUI rounds my partner and I decided to give it a break, focus on us getting married and trying to get healthy.

I stopped smoking weed completely, gave up coffee, drank a fertility tea on the days of my period (Jamaican dog blood), and committed to acupuncture weekly. When I told my acupuncturist that we would do IVF if we can‚Äôt conceive naturally she really upped our work together and fit me in her schedule weekly. I also got the inito fertility tracker to get real results around my peak ovulation and to confirm a successful ovulation. 


I would say 6+ months of no smoking, 4 months of no caffeine, 3 months of the tea, and a solid 1.5 months of weekly acupuncture and one tracked cycle on inito, we finally did it. My fianc√© has said all along he felt like if we took a more natural approach eventually it would happen for us, but being stage 4 I didn‚Äôt have a lot of hope. I recognize every situation is different, and what works for one person won‚Äôt always work for the next, but I just wanted to share what worked for me. I‚Äôve never had a positive pregnancy test in my entire life so this was shocking and unbelievable and incredible all in the same moment.

1habvhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1habvhr/aita_for_staying_friends_with_my_best_friends_ex/,aita for staying friends with my best friend‚Äôs ex boyfriend?,"i (17f) have been friends with my girls for my whole life basically and last year i got really close to my best friend (16f). i introduced her to my guy friend (17m) who she had a pretty big crush on. i‚Äôm not gonna go into the details here, but they dated for some time and then broke up. during this time i was talking to his best friend (16m) and, as an avoidant attachment girl, this was the first time i actually felt something real for someone. i loved talking to him so much, we would use each other‚Äôs slang, i got so happy and excited whenever he texted me or whenever someone mentioned him in any context. he was the only person i could imagine an actual future with. even though i‚Äôve talked to a lot of guys, this was the first time i actually liked someone to the point i wasn‚Äôt going to run from a relationship. peak period of life, when they were together and we were talking. but things started changing after one time we were out on a ‚Äòdouble date‚Äô, and he was ignoring me the whole time. which was his thing, because he always ignored me in real life, but over text it really felt like we were something. anyways this time i had enough, my feelings did an 180 and i started being colder towards him because obviously i was mad at him for ignoring me. and soon after he stopped texting me (not immediately, but every time he did i was cold to him), i stopped texting him and whatever it was we had ended. now this left me broken for months. i tried moving on but genuinely couldn‚Äôt. i told everyone (my best friend too) i was over him after a few months to not seem pathetic. i‚Äôm still not over him, even though at this point we‚Äôre fully no contact (we weren‚Äôt, but every single time we talked it was super short and he‚Äôd leave me on seen, and now we haven‚Äôt talked at all for a month). but i can‚Äôt escape him which is driving me crazy. anyways, after my best friend and her boyfriend broke up i was there for her, as well as all the girls in the friend group. and not just us but also my ex situationship as well. after his best friend broke up with her, he started texting her and she says he ‚Äòhelped alot with getting over him‚Äô. anyways this was 5 months ago and to this day they‚Äôre still talking. now obviously i am hurt, because she‚Äôs my best friend and she‚Äôs texting the guy i was, maybe still am, in love with, and she knows exactly what i felt for him so she can‚Äôt play the ‚Äòi thought he was just another guy to you‚Äô card. she says they‚Äôre nothing more than friends and while i do believe that it doesn‚Äôt make it any easier. i would be somewhat okay with this if she STOPPED BRINGING HIM UP. like i will just be going about my day and she‚Äôll text me ‚Äòoh me and xx are talking and guess what he told me‚Äô ‚Äòdid you know he does this‚Äô ‚Äòcan you settle a debate for us‚Äô ‚Äòguess what he just told me‚Äô. I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW. if i‚Äôm going to ever get over him i need no contact. i don‚Äôt want you bringing him up every 5 minutes. i‚Äôm jealous, obviously, and i might still be in love with him. but okay whatever. i think the reason she is doing this is on purpose and it‚Äôs because i‚Äôm still friends with her ex. like we‚Äôve been friends for 5 years, i can‚Äôt just drop him like that. and it‚Äôs not like he did something absolutely terrible, he broke up because he lost feelings. if he did something really bad to her i would drop him yes. but since he didn‚Äôt, i don‚Äôt see a reason to. the thing is i don‚Äôt talk about him with her, unless she asks, and if he talks shit about her i defend her and tell her what he said. i don‚Äôt agree with what he‚Äôs saying, but i don‚Äôt want to drop him and choose sides just because they broke up. am i the asshole for that? i‚Äôm trying to be respectful but what she‚Äôs doing to me is driving me insane. it‚Äôs not like me and him are best friends or anything more than friends god forbid, but since we live in the same part of town we go get a coffee from time to time. (not just the two of but also another guy who i‚Äôm closer to). i feel like she‚Äôs mad at me for that and is talking to my ex situationship as revenge. she didn‚Äôt know him before all this and it‚Äôs a completely different story. i don‚Äôt care if she talks to him as long as she keeps me out of it and i keep my no contact going. i genuinely don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs in the wrong here and it‚Äôs driving me crazy hearing her talk about him and bring him up every chance she gets.

1habvby,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1habvby/guys_how_would_you_handle_this_over_a_decade_of/,"Guys, how would you handle this? Over a decade of love and betrayals. ","F.29. 
In high school, I fell in love with Rick, my first love. We dated for six months, but I broke it off despite still loving him, feeling too young and reckless. The real reason was that Rick deflowered one of the girls I knew and I didn't wanted to be another one in his books ya know. (I was a very proud 15yrs girl).
After the breakup, Rick was devastated but moved on quickly. 
I masked my feelings, and eventually, we both started dating other people. 
Still, we remained close, secretly loving each other, and reconnected multiple times.

I had my first sexual experience with another guy my age(at 18).

Later, Rick and I became intimate, reigniting our bond. (We were more like a situationship at this point). Things unraveled in our final year on high school. On a trip to the seaside, I discovered Rick was also intimate with Penny, another girl in our group. Shortly after, at a post-exam party, I caught my best friend, Lena, and Rick kissing. I later found out they were intimate that night‚Äîit was Lena's first time. The double betrayal shattered me.

Lena apologized, saying she was too drunk, too horny and too stupid, and I forgave her, but our friendship was never the same. 
 
6 years passed after highschool and Rick and I rekindled our relationship, dating for three years. (He was the one reaching out, saying that I m like a magnet to him etc) However, unresolved trust issues (from our school years) and immaturity led to another breakup. 
I still regret ending it and wonder what might have been. But we were too afraid of each other to fully love each other. 

Years have passed, and Rick is now engaged, from what I heard. We don't keep in touch. 

Though I‚Äôve let go of the hope of a reunion with Rick, I feel unresolved about the past.
I tried reaching out to him a couple of years ago and we talked a bit via messages, but he declined my offers to meet over coffee. 

At the begging of this year, I reconnected with another friend (a guy Rick is good friends with) and we dated for 3 months. 
I broke up with him because I wasn't in love. 

In June of this year, Rick's mom reached out, asking to meet for coffee. I visited her (we were alone) and we talked and laughed. 
We keep in touch. 
About a week ago she called and told me that she spoke with Rick about our meeting. Apparently Rick was very happy that me and his mom met.
She then told me that Rick told her that I was dating his friend. 
I told her that it wasn't serious.

I don't know why I am writing this.
Maybe because I m feeling lonely, and my mind wonders what it would have been if me and Rick were more mature, or just luckier.
He was my best relationship, so far.

We both made mistakes, bigger or smaller, but I always had an open door for him to talk, to meet.. I always was open to listen to him when he came back. 

But he s not willing to meet me the only time I asked him (outside of our relationship)

Order was $55.......I have a $5 tip. Perfectly reasonable. Enjoy your tip. I am done with the assenine culture. It ends here. $5 Protest tip on all meals, no matter what the order comes out to. And Tip Jars? $1. That's what you are getting sweetheart for ringing up my coffee when you flip that stupid screen around. $1 if I even feel like giving that away!

# 1. Understanding the Importance of Coffee Table Maintenance

# The Coffee Table as a Reflection of¬†You

A coffee table serves both functional and aesthetic purposes in your home. It‚Äôs where you entertain guests, unwind with a book, or simply enjoy a cup of coffee.

# Key Insights from Influential Articles

1. Personality and Design Choices: The choice of coffee table can indicate your personal style. For instance, a sleek, modern design may suggest a preference for minimalism, while a rustic, vintage piece might reflect a love for history and tradition.
2. Introvert vs. Extrovert Styling: According to De Casa Collections, introverts may prefer a serene, uncluttered table with a few meaningful items, while extroverts might opt for vibrant colors and engaging decor to spark conversation. This distinction highlights how coffee table styling can cater to different personality types.
3. Lifestyle Representation: The Luxury for Men article emphasizes that the decor on your coffee table can communicate your lifestyle. Items like travel souvenirs, art books, or plants can reveal what you cherish and value in life.



# Personalizing Your Coffee Table¬†Decor

# 1. Choosing the Right Coffee¬†Table

The foundation of a well-styled coffee table begins with selecting the right piece. Consider the size, shape, and material of the table. A versatile option like the Enrico Rectangular Coffee Table in Walnut can suit various decor styles.

A coffee table that fits your living space not only enhances the room‚Äôs functionality but also aligns with your personal aesthetic.

# 2. Layering and¬†Heights

Creating layers with different heights adds visual interest to your coffee table. Use stacks of books, decorative boxes, and vases to establish varying levels. For example, placing a tall vase next to a low bowl can create a balanced look that is both inviting and dynamic.

# 3. Reflecting Your Interests

Showcasing your hobbies and passions is a great way to personalize your coffee table. If you love art, consider displaying an art book or a small sculpture. If you‚Äôre a traveler, incorporate souvenirs or photographs from your journeys.",1,1733756946.0,u_OJcommerce,0,1.0,False

Part of the reason I stopped was to stop other bad habits, like gambling. I had done a great deal of damage to myself financially because of alcohol. Sober I would never think about gambling. I know with all my heart that it is a trap. The odds are against me. When I decided to drink I was also putting the odds against me.  The odds of me doing something stupid, saying something stupid, making a fool of myself rose exponentially when I decided to drown my sorrows with alcohol. 

I have almost no regrets.  My heart is lighter. My conscience is clear my future is bright. I look forward to the small things again. Morning coffee. Morning frickin coffee. It helps to put me in a good mood and it helps me become sharper. Compared to alcohol? My cognitive abilities declined very rapidly.  My speech became aggressive.  Either that or I became more relaxed. It was such a gamble on how i would be. 

My bank account is full. Ive saved a decent amount of money. Three months worth of bills. And it is going to grow. It will grow because I trust myself now..whereas before I was beholden to the whims of alcohol. 

  I'm resilient. I'm courageous. I am not what I've done....I am actively writing my story. I'm 35 years old..still a young man. I laugh like a child and I sleep like baby.  I am so so happy to be writing this. And I will write another one at 90 days.

I'd been struggling with disease progression (its year 15) while taking the max metformin dose of 2000 mg.  Doc added Jardiance 10 mg, which worked well in getting my numbers down, especially after returning to carb counting and intermittent fasting.  However, my stomach reacted poorly to the combination of metformin and Jardiance in the morning....and no, I cannot give up my morning coffee.  I realized I could switch to extended release, reduce my daily pill count and lower cost by switching to Synjardy XR so it seemed a win-win.  The thing is, doc prescribed the 5/1000 version of Synjardy XR and told me to take one pill once a day.  Her logic is that the second 1000 mg metformin pill I had been taking was because regular metformin only lasts 12 hours.  She acknowledged the lowering of Jardiance but I suspect she wants me to manage my diet better as I have been successful in doing so over the years. Three days in though and my evening sugars are rocketing to 250 after my dinner and snack.  I can get back into range if I eat on a 18:6 fasting schedule and eat less than 50 carbs a day but that's a challenge to do 7 days a week.  It was easier to do in the early years but its harder and harder as life goes on.  Anyone else switch from regular metformin/Jardiance to the Synjardy XR, and if so, how were you dosed?  How'd did your sugars react?   ",1,1733756448.0,diabetes_t2,0,1.0,False

1hablbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hablbn/sydneys_by_the_sea/,Sydney's by the Sea,"I had many fond memories of Sydney‚Äôs by the Sea. And though I could hear the sirens in the distance, and I knew they might be looking for me, I was going to take my time. I was going to see what I could see.

When I arrived I hadn‚Äôt expected the door to be intact. It was unlocked, so maybe that‚Äôs why. Because anything trying to come inside already had an open invitation. I locked it behind me, for whatever good that would do.¬†

The years had not been kind to Sydney‚Äôs house, but they were kinder than they‚Äôd been to most empty places. There were still spots of drywall clinging to the wooden skeleton underneath. The roof was intact, keeping the wet ocean air at bay. Vandals, squatters, and various creatures had all been inside, but they‚Äôd left enough behind to give me what I‚Äôd come for. I wanted to remember Sydney, just for a little while.¬†

The hallway leading to the living room greeted me not with pictures on the walls, but with graffiti that heralded doom. Every possible variety of ‚Äúgod save us‚Äù ‚Äúrepent now‚Äù and ‚Äúthe end is here‚Äù was scrawled on the walls. The living room had brown and muted pink wallpaper that, in another time, would have been lovely, but was too antique for our tastes. We‚Äôd always meant to tear it down, but we never got around to it. Time had completed the task for us though. There were only a few strips still left clinging to the slowly rotting walls.¬†

Sydney and I had only lived here for three months before things went bad. But that was enough time to make memories. Probably more good memories than I'd made at any other point in my life. Everything was going right for us, in every possible way. We were finally doing what we wanted with our lives, deeply in love, and on the cusp of fame on top of it all. That excitement and terror made everything in our lives seem so much more vibrant.¬†

The living room had only been half ransacked. There's hadn't been much of value for anyone to take. Well, nothing that had value anymore. The shelves by our smashed TV still held a handful of movies and CDs, but the books were mostly gone. As I started rifling through them I caught the scent of sea air. I froze and listened intently to see if someone had opened a door or window. But the sirens didn‚Äôt sound any closer, and the house was silent of both creaks and footsteps.

On our falling shelves there were still thirteen copies of our CD left. We'd gotten a whole box for family and friends, more than we could use, even with our rapidly growing social circle. I picked up the cleanest copy and wiped it with my filthy shirt, smearing the grime away from Sydney's face. They'd airbrushed out that little mole on her left cheek, and the eyes looking back at me were a lighter blue, but it was still her. It had been so long. God I missed her.¬†

I slipped the CD into my jacket. It used to be a nice jacket, but a life on the run had necessitated change and I'd cut the inside layer open for storage. Now it held all the essentials; water, bandages, food, my knife, and now Sydney.¬†

I made my way to the kitchen; more graffiti, more holes in the walls, and the scent of sea air only grew stronger. The cabinets were still mostly the baby blue we‚Äôd picked out, underneath the dust, dirt, and of course, the blood. The tile floor was mostly intact, harder to destroy than wood and drywall.¬†

The kitchen had never been somewhere I‚Äôd felt comfortable, but I had been trying. It hadn‚Äôt been a room I‚Äôd had at most of the places I‚Äôd lived. Well if you can even call it living. Sometimes I feel like the only times I‚Äôd really been living instead of existing were the brief years I‚Äôd gotten with Sydney. We‚Äôd gone to school together for the seventh and eighth grades, then my world went dark. It reignited when I met her again a decade later at twenty-three. And when I lost her for good, it was back to the darkness, the emptiness.¬†¬†

I felt like the kitchen, more than any other place in the house, represented the massive divide between us. For me, eating had always been an act of survival, something to be done in haste when the opportunity presented itself.¬† For her, it was so much more. She‚Äôd grown up with family dinners, holiday feasts, and takeout movie nights. When Sydney cooked she‚Äôd always chop up something green to garnish or sprinkle fancy sauces on top of everything. For her, food had always been there, and since she knew it *would* always be there she could take her time. I tried to learn to do that too. I tried so hard to exist in her world. I feel like if I‚Äôd had just a little more time, maybe I could have succeeded. Or I at least could have gotten better at pretending.¬†

I started digging through the cabinets. The unessentials were still there, gadgets that only served one purpose; a garlic roller, a tortilla press. Her little box with frosting tips and food coloring was completely untouched. I poured out some bright blue on my finger and licked it up, taking that bit of her with me too. I pocketed a few bottles. I could hear the sirens closer now, and I still had time to get away, if I wanted to. But I wasn‚Äôt sure I did. I deserved it after all, for what I‚Äôd done to Sydney.¬†

I moved down the hallway. The bedroom was hard to look at. Our bedsheets were still there but torn and stained. The blankets were gone. We had bittersweet memories here, but mostly good near the end. I‚Äôd always had nightmares, but she‚Äôd made them better. I‚Äôd stopped waking up as much, knowing she was next to me. I think we‚Äôd finally hit the point where I could sleep through the night when things went to hell. Our sex life had only gotten better in the new house too. Before that, we‚Äôd had to sneak around her roommate's schedule, as going back to the place I was staying at was out of the question. I wondered who else had made love on our bed since the house had been abandoned. Carved into the headboard was the sentence ‚ÄúBaby, it was real and we were the best.‚Äù

I‚Äôd always hoped I‚Äôd end up with Sydney and the fact that it had happened, even only briefly, still amazed me. Hers had been the first hand I‚Äôd ever held, her lips the first I‚Äôd ever kissed. We‚Äôd only been kids when she moved away, so we hadn‚Äôt been each other‚Äôs first loves, but that had never mattered to me. I‚Äôd had plenty of girls throw themselves at me over the years, but always for the same reasons. The girls interested in me could always tell that there was something wrong with me. But that was okay because that was what they wanted. They‚Äôd seen the bruises on me growing up and pitied me. Or as an adult, they‚Äôd seen me struggle through the most basic of human interactions and wanted to help me. They wanted someone mysterious, maybe even dangerous. They wanted to touch my scars and ask me about them in hushed voices in bed. But as the mystery and the danger vanished, they lost interest.¬†

That had never happened with Sydney. I‚Äôd known her only before things had gotten bad, and only again after they started to get slightly better. Sydney had known me happy and wanted that again. As children, we‚Äôd planned for the future together. With my poems and her voice, not to mention her beauty, we‚Äôd be unstoppable. It was just a silly childhood fantasy, one you‚Äôre supposed to forget about when you start to really plan your life. But for me, it was all I had. That dream of our future together got me through those disgusting next few years.¬†

The door to our office was closed but with a hole big enough to walk through. Was it really still a door at that point? I decided it was, and I reached in to unlock it, opening the door properly. Sydney‚Äôs sound booth in the corner had been similarly broken, shards of glass at the edges of the window the only thing separating it from the rest of the room. On the other end of the office, the pictures above my desk had been mostly left up, but washed out by the elements. The scent of the sea was stronger here, and I could hear the waves of the ocean now.¬†

Sydney didn‚Äôt, and would never know that it wasn‚Äôt an accident that we met up again as adults. The second I had my life together enough that I felt like I wouldn't scare her off I found her. I practiced over and over again saying in the mirror ‚ÄúOh my gosh Sydney, is that you? It‚Äôs been so long.‚Äù Practicing my words was nothing new for me, I did it any time I knew what the world was going to throw at me; ordering coffee, interviewing for a job, and saying hello to people I sort of knew. I always had to practice, and by the time I found Sydney again, I was getting good at it. I almost felt like I could speak to people without practicing first, and not mess up my words, or stutter, or forget what to say. Almost.¬†

She‚Äôd remembered me, and the one thing that I‚Äôd been born lucky with had been my looks. I was handsome enough to get the benefit of the doubt. I swept her off her feet. She‚Äôd put enough of herself on the internet that I knew all of her favorite things; her favorite foods, her favorite books, her favorite shows. I‚Äôd listened to her sing over and over again online, but I still acted surprised the first time she sang for me again after our reunion. Not only had she remembered me and our silly little dreams as children, but she wanted to see if we could still make it happen. She was so beautiful, she might have made it even without me, but I was happy to be along for the ride. And fuck we‚Äôd gotten so close before everything went so horribly wrong. We were hitting the point in our lives where our biggest worries had been how to stay humble, and where we wanted to go on our next vacation.

At least one of Sydney‚Äôs fans had walked through the house after it was left to rot. Near my desk, they‚Äôd spray-painted a heart around the poster of our first EP and wrote underneath it ‚ÄúI loved you, Sydney.‚Äù I know this place had technically been both of ours, but I‚Äôd never been able to think of it that way. This was her house, I could never own something so beautiful.¬†

The last room in the house wasn‚Äôt really a room anymore. It had been our back porch, but the screen was all gone. Only jagged wooden slats remained, and the tile floor, which had stayed almost perfectly intact. I‚Äôd spent much of my childhood and young adult life living in forgotten, rotting places, and that was how it always went. The soft and delicate features of a building died first, torn apart and destroyed by animals, people, and the elements. Anything intricate would mold and rot and collapse. Only stone, cement, and brick stayed for any length of time. Wallpaper, art, and decorations; those were not things that lasted.¬†

I used to hear Sydney‚Äôs singing when I went to sleep, now all I hear is her screams.¬†

In the old world, buildings like Sydney‚Äôs abandoned house were a rarity, a curiosity, at least in our country. Abandoned places were torn down eventually, and replaced with new ones. Now, in this new world, these were the only buildings we had. I sat on the steps of our back porch and watched the new world from where Sydney and I had watched the fall of the old one.¬†

It had happened so quickly, that we didn‚Äôt have time to prepare. Though truthfully I don‚Äôt know how we would have. I couldn't tell you how long ago it was, time becomes different on the run. But we‚Äôd sat here the first night *they* came, and listened to the screams from the city across the bay. TV was gone, the internet was gone. It was every man for himself within hours and no one knew what was happening.¬†

The first attack came from our neighbor who‚Äôd always had eyes for Sydney. We let him in, he was human after all, in a world rapidly being filled with things that were not. But he only wanted to take Sydney for himself, as if she were merely a thing to be possessed in this new world. We didn‚Äôt have a gun so I‚Äôd killed him with a knife. Truth be told it was easier killing my fellow man than killing the creatures that came in next, but only because they were stronger.¬†

The binoculars we‚Äôd used were still on the ground, I was shocked no one had grabbed them. They were one of the few things we‚Äôd had in this house that still had value in this new world. I picked them up and looked out across the bay at the city's new inhabitants.¬†

Half the skyscrapers had burned down, and curled across the top of one was a sleeping dragon. Something purple with a dozen legs was crawling out of another building, looking for survivors with each window it punctured. On the ground below a giant with one eye sparred with a unicorn, or maybe they were playing. I hadn‚Äôt yet seen the creatures turn on each other, but perhaps they would when they ran out of us. On the beach closest to the bay a pack of centaurs kicked around a human head, laughing and whinniying as they ran. If I was close enough to hear them, they could probably smell me. But that was fine, I was done running.

When the world ended we‚Äôd only made it out because our boat had enough fuel to get us to the forest down the coast. We survived in those woods for nine months. In the time it takes to grow a new life, we clung to this old one. I remembered those months more vividly than any other time, we were always on the brink of death, but I‚Äôd had Sydney all to myself.¬†

The creatures stayed in the cities at first. There were so many different kinds, but what united them all was a taste for human flesh, and a determination to wipe us out. They started finding us exponentially more as time went on, and they ran out of easy prey. I tried to teach Sydney to kill, but she never took to it, even with our lives on the line. I knew she was a lost cause when she wouldn‚Äôt even spear a mermaid I‚Äôd caught for her in a net. It was such an easy kill. She still ate the meat though, surviving but not wanting to see how.

During those nine months, I started to wonder if I‚Äôd ever really loved her, or if I‚Äôd just loved the idea of her, the things she could give me, and the life I could have with her. Her smile, her laugh, her spark, all vanished as time went on. I wonder if maybe everyone becomes that way given enough stress. If we‚Äôre all just empty husks without our possessions, our houses, our food. Maybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so good at surviving here, I‚Äôd already had that all taken from me before.¬†

Our neighbor wasn‚Äôt the only human threat I‚Äôd taken out. With society gone other people, particularly the men, became monsters too. The night Sydney finally died I thought that‚Äôs what we were in store for.¬†

They‚Äôd all appeared around us in a circle, a group of men at the edge of the woods. The ones we could see in the firelight were shirtless, possibly naked. But they were still human, and I thought that perhaps we could reason with them, we were becoming a rare species after all.¬†

But they ignored my questions, my demands, my threats, and as they got closer I saw why. They were only human from the waist up. With whinnies, neighs, and snorts they rushed us. I bashed one in the knee, giving me an out from the circle, and Sydney tried in vain to stab one, but she was too weak, too afraid to commit to the kill. One of the centaurs reared up on its back two legs, and stomped on her with his front hooves. The others were excitable, braying and grunting through human mouths. Sydney begged me to help her as I backed away. Maybe I could have, I‚Äôd killed so many people, so many creatures since this all began, and I'd gotten quite good at it. But the odds had never been that bad. And part of me knew, that without Sydney, I could survive much longer. She wasn‚Äôt made for this world.¬†

The other centaurs surrounded her and started stomping too, and as Sydney screamed and her bones crunched, I ran. In the end, I did survive better without her, but I wasn‚Äôt living.¬†

I could hear the sirens nearly at the house now. They'd been tracking me for days. I‚Äôd never seen how they killed, but I was sure it would be just as horrible as all the other monsters of this new world. I stayed on the back porch and waited for them. I didn‚Äôt want to go back in the house, it hadn‚Äôt been mine, not really. I took out one of the bottles of food coloring from my jacket, and on the wall behind me in red, I wrote simply ‚ÄúI was here.‚Äù That seemed like the only thing I could say about my life.¬†

As the sirens‚Äô song grew louder I set down my knife and waited for whatever fate had in store for me. I‚Äôd had enough of this life, and it had had enough of me. I was ready to die, and I couldn‚Äôt think of a better place to do it than Sydney's by the Sea.",5,1733756374.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1habktu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1habktu/this_is_my_story/,This is my story,"**Let me share my story with you.**  

The whole thing started in the middle of September:    
I was going about my usual routine at home when I suddenly had to lie down on my couch. My pulse skyrocketed, and my blood pressure shot up to 150/100. I couldn‚Äôt eat, felt dizzy, and could only wait for it to stop. After a few hours, the episode passed, but I felt utterly drained for days. This happened about twice a week for a while‚Äîand only in the evenings! My doctor prescribed some light medication, which helped for a bit. Around this time, I also quit coffee and caffeinated beverages.  

**October:**    
At the beginning of October, the symptoms occurred in the morning for the first time, which was a worsening trend since it had previously only happened in the evening. I immediately sought out a private cardiologist. I found one, hopped in the car, and went to see what was going on with my heart. The doctor conducted a thorough checkup and concluded that my heart was fine, attributing the symptoms to stress. He switched my medication. After that, the symptoms stopped occurring in the morning.  

One new symptom I noticed was that being in a warm room became uncomfortable. I also started coughing, which worsened when I lay down. Over time, the cough disappeared, but the evening episodes continued sporadically.  

**November:**    
Around November 20th, I noticed my stomach flaring up and felt a sharp sensation in my chest. I suspected it might be reflux and realized that all my symptoms seemed to originate in my stomach. I began paying close attention to my body and discovered that certain foods triggered the symptoms.  

During this month, I visited another cardiologist, who again confirmed that my heart and other vital signs were in good condition. I also saw another doctor about the stomach burning, and she prescribed **pantoprazole**, which I was instructed to take in the morning and evening.  

**December:**    
The stomach symptoms worsened. I experienced constant burning in my stomach, could barely eat, and always felt a lump in my throat. I lost 3 kilograms. (I‚Äôm a very thin person‚Äî185-190 cm tall, and I usually weigh around 68-70 kg. Now I‚Äôm down to barely 65 kg.)  

Three days ago, I told my doctor that pantoprazole wasn‚Äôt helping. He switched me to **esomeprazole** (Actavis, 40 mg), to be taken in the morning and evening. He also checked my organs and said everything seemed fine, concluding that I likely had gastritis and needed to visit a gastroenterologist.  

At this point, I felt horrible. I had no appetite for days and had to force myself to eat. My stool was strange‚Äîyellowish and contained undigested food particles. Yesterday, I even felt some burning around my intestines.  

Today, I visited a private gastroenterologist. I researched this doctor beforehand and saw that he had good reviews, so I trusted him. I shared my entire story, and his response was that my organs seemed fine without conducting any further checks. He suggested that my symptoms were **psychosomatic** and recommended regular, intensive exercise.  

He also advised me to quit esomeprazole immediately, explaining that the dose prescribed to me was excessive and typically reserved for patients with serious conditions like cancer, ulcers, or severe bleeding in the vomit or stool.  

**In conclusion:**  
My gastroenterologist believes that I am under significant stress and that managing it will alleviate the gastritis symptoms.  

  

I am going to start exercise today will see how things going.

","I (17M) have been friends for six years now with my best friend (17F) and we‚Äôve always been part of the same group until some months ago. In August‚Äôs first week it‚Äôs festive in my city and there‚Äôs concerts, traditions etc. But as she sometimes is kind of too much (for example, when something is funny to her she scream-laughs quite hard, what makes everyone listen) and with alcohol is kinda worse, so a friend from our group (18F) and I decided to just hang out without her, just one day of the seven we would go out with her and that‚Äôs all. 

The problem is that the day we hang out with her, when she had to go back home as she lived closely she went home alone, which at first she didn‚Äôt seem to care but actually she got bad, but a lot. And I mean, I get it, a woman alone in the streets going back home at night it‚Äôs not a fun experience and I blame myself for that. So we got into a big argument and end up forgiving me. Now, we haven‚Äôt hang out since that day, we only went to have some coffee for like two hours on a thurdsday and that‚Äôs it. She‚Äôs found a new group as hanging out with me has been difficult because I‚Äôm studying my last year before college and haven‚Äôt been on my best moment (insecurities and overthinking, basically), and when I‚Äôm not okay I tend to avoid everyone, to aisle myself from everything. 

So, some days ago she told me she hang out with some friends and that she had so much fun, and that they had invited her to a bar they own yesterday, which I asked her if I could go because this last months I‚Äôve felt kind of alone and empty. Yesterday was one of the best nights of my life, I was shy with all of her friends and didn‚Äôt talk much because of the respect it gave me being in a place where they all had already the confidence of being (bc it is theirs ofc) but still had so much fun. We talked, played some table games and watched a movie. What made that night amazing is that while I was there with them, I forgot about all the problems in my life.

I'm sorry for the long text I'm struggling to succinctly outline my thoughts/needs.

I've done the work and we are clear and free of him and I'm in the process of mentally unpacking just how bad it was/ could've been. I have a therapist and am well emotionally supported now. 



Me mid 30s F he is early 30s M. Two(teenage children to a different father).
Abusive and violent relationship from 2016-2022

 I've just learnt that statistically an abuser is more likely to kill their partner when they (the abuser)identify as suicidal. 

X would frequently talk about wanting to end his life and say how little I cared about him wanting to die. I cared very much but I felt so overwhelmed and stuck between wanting to help him and being told that I was the cause of his problems. I would try to exit the relationship as he'd said I was the one hurting him but then he would say that me leaving was worse because I had done all this damage and I had no intention of helping or putting it right- but nothing I did and no matter how much i changed(including not ""bothering him"" for days/weeks at a time) would change his belief that i was intentionally harming him.
The frequency and intensity of his suicidal threats meant i had to state that he was not to comit suicide at my home- which I only said because i was so scared that my children would find him- he agreed (bus I suspect he only agreed as he knew he was going to ignore my rule)but would constantly criticise me for being cold and uncaring.

I've belatedly realising that he could've been spiking my drinks? When I was home he would insist on making me strong coffees... during our time together I often felt overwhelmed with fatigue and dizziness and extreme bouts of dihearea. 
X was a long serving member of St John's ambulance and an ex student paramedic. He often armchair diagnosed people and generally felt himself to be very medically competent. His arrogance could sometimes be an issue which meant I would try to keep him out of any of my/my kids medical appointments and dealings. He was frequently wrong and wouldn't concede his position in the face of evidence.
Obviously it wasn't always terrible. There was huge amounts of love bombing and trauma bonding. I'm ashamed to say I did think him wanting to be a paramedic was a green flag and made me blind to a lot of his behaviour.

Relevant past experiences;

2018 X was due to pick up my children from school as a favour(he had volunteered to help)to me whilst I went to have a hair cut (my first haircut since 2006). He didn't pick the kids up nor did he say that wasn't collecting them. I was 20miles away when the schools contacted me to ask why the children hadn't been collected. I called for help and the kids were collected by family. X had let himself into my home prior to school pick up and left his mobile phone- he had also taken a length of rope that I owned for some tents. He smashed up the kitchen and my livingroom. I was so worried I called the police thinking only of his safety- I left my home and waited outside for the police and ambulance-I was scared he'd killed himself either inside my home or gone elsewhere. After the police had checked my property they pointed out that he'd stabbed a kitchen knife deep into a door and had put an axe on the kitchen countertop. Concerned the police asked if I was safe but I wasn't thinking clearly and (foolishly)only cared for his safety( I now know this is by design, and I still feel huge shame for having this man near me and my children for so long).

Early 2019 I was told he restrained my youngest child in a dangerous way- the incident happen when I wasn't in the room and X insisted that my son and my sons school were lying in order to discredit him. 
X and I parted ways for a time but he used the incident to insist he was being attacked and this was an attack on his potential future career(despite being asked to leave his EMT degree in 2016). He felt he was very much the victim in this matter.

In 2019 I was admitted to hospital with Cdiff. three days prior to me being admitted he insisted that my cdiff could be treated by my doctors surgery and that I didn't need to go to hospital despite my doctors surgery insisting I need to to go to a and e the day they inspected me. I was severely dehydrated and very weak. He badgered me that taking a taxi was a waste of money and left the house frequently meaning that I couldn't leave to go to the hospital as my children were still too young to be left without care. I knew driving myself was too dangerous and that I wouldn't be able to walk from the carpark to an and e. It took three days of constant persistence to get him to agree to care for the kids or to drive me in. In the end I arranged care for them with their father and grandmother and booked a taxi. He insisted on driving me into hospital in my own car but halfway to the hospital (the hospital was a 10min drive away) he became angry and although I sat in silence he worked himself up to rage and slammed the breaks on in my car in the middle of the road. Turned the engine off and got out and walked off leaving me stranded. Exhausted and weak I decided to drive down a residential road nearby and book a taxi the rest of the way to hospital. I didn't bother calling him as I used to have done because I knew he would ignore my calls. I was reprimanded heavily by staff and was in hospital for over a week. He did not speak to me whilst I was there. It was this incident that started me thinking that he may want me dead- but I felt that this belief was too dramatic; and I was still very confused. X believed at the time that I was the abusive party and I was scared that I was in fact the problem.

From 2020 I had disfiguring ankle and foot swelling that was completely inexplicable- since our break up the severity of the foot swelling has dramatically decreased and I now only have occasional mild flare ups when the weather is hot. My liver was sited as a possible cause but there is no cirrhosis.

Around 2021 I was hospitalised as I had terrible chest pain which was guessed at being caused by Covid as I had tested positive whilst being checked. I had no overt covid symptoms but my breathing was shallow and I felt confused. No blood tests were done as they believed the cause of the shallow breathing and chest pain was due to covid- over the few days I was in hospital I made immediate progress despite still being covid positive.

After moving to a shared home in the summer of 2021 he started making these deposits of items he said he was planning to use for self harm or suicide. It started with a stashing large quantities of aspirin. He actively disliked taking by mouth medication so realistically I've realised that the aspirin may not have been for himself. Boxes of his aspirin would go missing from time to time which I never questioned but upon reflection he would certainly not be taking it, because he would make such a large ordeal of having to take any form of medicine that he'd certainly advertise the fact extensively before and after taking it. He would state myself or the children had impacted him and was now sick as a result of us doing *something* or not doing anything etc. 
As 2021 progressed I started finding  carrier bags hidden around our home and vehicles containing aspirin, Stanley knives and long lengths of rope. When I first found one of these bags I was understandably confused and asked as I hadn't connected the dots that It was for suicide so I asked him about it. He was extremely angry with me for moving it and said it was a suicide kit. He took the bag and I suspect he put it back but some were different. Over the next year I found around 7 of these bags the locations were out bedroom, the kitchen, my car, and his car. When I would find one I would silently take it when I went out of the home and dump it in a bin far away from the property as he would check the bin. The first few times he would go to the stash site and notice it not there and he would become angry but not say why. He once later during an argument said he knew I was stealing them. I did lie and I feigned ignorance- I'm glad I did.

So my questions- 
Is there any way to test for malicious overdose? I suspect it could've started from around 2020- to when we broke up in 2022.

If I could prove it, how would I even try to tell the police about it??

Thanks

Since I‚Äôve gotten her though, I‚Äôve HAD to use a slow feeder, as when she was younger she would inhale her food so fast she‚Äôd throw up. Using the slow feeder isn‚Äôt a big deal though. 

What I‚Äôm wondering, is pretty much every day I rotate between how she‚Äôs fed because it seems to keep her occupied and give me time to do shower/have coffee/eat whatever before we do a walk or to transition to evening chill time.

It took less than a month for me to get it back (a miracle ü•≥), but I'm going to note down some things I did/experienced as it helped me a lot when seeing stuff like that in this community (thank you, ily)!

Also how do I know when my 'extreme' hunger is over, because my hunger cues are still whack, I still feel like I can eat a horse, and my only fullness cue is when I physically can't eat anymore üò≠

Lengthy post incoming (sorry)!

A little background:

* I lost 4kg/8lbs in two months (was at a healthy weight throughout), skipped two periods before deciding I needed to fix this shit.
* I had no other signs, my hair/skin/nails were HELLA healthy - they were literally glowing and the best they've been lol, and my motivation/activity/sleep levels didn't change at all.

Notes on recovery:

* After deciding to pause my weight loss journey, I went from eating 1400-1600 to hovering around my assumed maintenance (around 2000 cals) for 2 weeks
* First signs I noticed was libido, acne, and cramping in my stomach and lower back (which I'd never experienced before)
* I did gain 1kg/2lbs during this but I'm thinking it was mostly increased amount of food + water weight as I felt extremely bloated and constipated throughout
* My 'extreme' hunger kicked in last week (around 3000 cals) which was hella scary, both in terms of seeing the scale (went up 2kg/4lbs) and the amount I could and was eating (the comments on my previous post were VERY helpful, thank you!!)
* I literally felt my throat clear up, like I'd actually come up for air after being underwater, it was so weird
* I guess this was going 'all-in'? I didn't directly succumb to my cravings (chocolate mostly) but made sure I had meals and even seconds of nutritious foods, before having my cravings if I still wanted them.
* My caffeine intake didn't change, if not increased - idk I LOVED and still LOVE coffee
* I've always avoided dairy bc they cause stomach issues, but had greek yogurt to get at least some protein
* I did take natural laxatives (chinese herbs are actual magic) only when I was (literally) so full of shit
* My stomach would be physically so full and hurt but my mind would still be hungry, I literally had to stand up and walk for a bit before eating again. I felt SO gross üò≠
* I had some discharge for 3-5 days before it went away (completely normal a week before my period), so I was kinda sure I would get my period the following week
* **TMI:** The day before my period came (so yesterday) I had really bad stomach aches and was fighting for my life in the bathroom üíÄ, probably from the huge jump in the amount I'd been eating which shocked my stomach. I ate close to 4000 cals that day and even though I was mentally hungry, my stomach was so painfully full and making weird gurgling noises that I literally had to stop and put myself to sleep. I was also so puffy and bloated all day.
* This morning I woke up starving (which was insane considering how much I ate the day before üíÄ), puffy but not as bloated, and libido through the roof, but she was back!!!
* I still am experiencing 'extreme' hunger which I'm trying to regulate and differentiate it from stomach cramps by eating meals (or multiple) every 2-3 hours instead of going through my whole kitchen in an hour.
* I am scale-wise weight restored (will prob edit this in a few days to see), but still don't know how much 'fat' I've actually gained as my body still looks the same (other than my face feeling so puffy and round).
* The voice in my head is still there telling me that I'm eating way too much and that I'm going to balloon up and become Violet from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but I'm trying to get past it!

This community has been so comforting during my journey and I hope this could help even a little bit!

It‚Äôs simple, easy to remember, and honestly, it works (most of the time, anyway). Here's the breakdown:

* 10 hours before bed: No more caffeine. It takes around 10 hours for caffeine to fully leave your system, so if you're a coffee or soda lover, make sure your last cup is at least 10 hours before you plan to sleep.
* 3 hours before bed**:** Stop eating heavy meals or drinking alcohol. Digestion and booze can mess with your sleep cycle. You don't have to starve, but try to keep it light.
* 2 hours before bed**:** Shut down the work brain. No emails, no work stress. Give your mind some buffer time to relax.
* 1 hour before bed**:** No screens. I know, I know‚Äîthis one is hard. But phones, TVs, and laptops emit blue light that can mess with melatonin production. Pick up a book, do some light stretches, or listen to a podcast instead.
* 0**:** Hit snooze exactly *zero* times in the morning. I used to think I was winning by sneaking in those extra 5-10 minutes, but apparently, it just confuses your body and makes you feel groggier.

1habaqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1habaqd/aitah_for_telling_my_friend_to_stop_complaining/,"AITAH for telling my friend to stop complaining, he made his choice","I 34m, broke up with my ex of 7 years about a year ago.

It wasn‚Äôt a hard break up, we saw it coming, we‚Äôre still close friends. But still, after 7 years it was a tough adjustment.

That‚Äôs where my friend John 35m comes in. Essentially after my break up, we hung out and played video games together every night almost. I‚Äôve thanked him for being there for me.

The problem started after 6 months, I started to hit the gym again, I invited John to every single gym session. He would reject me every single time.

I started going out to bars/clubs again to hang out with other friends and to casually date around. I would invite John every single time I would go out, he would reject me every single time.

Eventually, I started to only hang out with John around once a week via video games. Last week he accused me of being a bad friend and only using him to feel better. 

I tried to be patient and I told him, look at our text messages over the last couple months. You said no every single, multiple times a week, to us hanging out. 

He starts saying that he‚Äôs not comfortable doing that stuff since he‚Äôs been depressed for a long time, ever since his 3 year long relationship with his one and only GF ended almost 10 years ago. (That‚Äôs another story, she was a narcissist, had BPD, did her best to manipulate him and isolate him from his family, cheated on him a bunch etc)
He then goes to on to say that our break ups aren‚Äôt the same, that I‚Äôm charismatic, tall and handsome hence why I have no problems moving on.

I had 0 sympathy for the ‚Äúwoe is me‚Äù speech. This man is 6ft tall for the record, but his posture is horrible. He has an extremely well paying job that he‚Äôs been doing for over 8 years now, he has rejected 4 promotions, his firm stopped offering them to him, also over the years we‚Äôve had mutual female friends ask about him but he‚Äôs shut that down every single time.

I told him I sympathize, I told him all of the above. I told him he‚Äôs letting life fly past him and we could start fresh tomorrow and hit the gym first thing in the morning, I would coach him and we can grab a coffee after before we head to work.

He stayed silent and I told him I‚Äôll text him in the morning, letting him know I‚Äôll pick him up. Morning comes, I‚Äôm at his house and he rejects me at the door again. Citing his former complaints again.

So I told him, you made your choice and I can‚Äôt listen to you complain every single time. I‚Äôm done being rejected by you. Whenever you‚Äôre ready start fresh again, shoot me a text, I‚Äôll always answer it, but I can‚Äôt keep initiating so I‚Äôll take a step back from the friendship. 

He didn‚Äôt say anything but texted me later saying that he was there for me but I couldn‚Äôt be there for him. I just told him reread the last 6 months of texts.

So am I the asshole, I feel guilty going LC with him since he was there for me every single day for months but on the other hand, he‚Äôs holding himself back.

Also nobody else chimed in, our friend group did not split in half, because I‚Äôm not a bot and we‚Äôre old enough to talk to each other about this, as this is an issue between two people. ",1,1733755567.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False
1habait,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1habait/very_mixed_messages/,Very Mixed Messages,"So, really long story. I‚Äôm a married man in my mid-40‚Äôs and I‚Äôve gotten quite close to a married woman I know from the gym. Neither of us are ‚Äòhappily married‚Äô, but we both have children and ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô marriages. We started chatting there, mainly on the treadmill, got to know each other and one day found ourselves at an event together. Turns out we had a great deal of fun, so we followed it up several weeks later by attending a wine tasting dinner together. We were both pretty drunk by the end of it and things got a little out of hand, nothing too serious but more than was appropriate.

The next morning I was feeling a lot of regret, thinking that I had ruined the friendship. As it transpired, I was surprised that this woman wanted to get closer, despite insisting nothing could ever happen in a romantic sense. Despite what she would say, her facial expressions told a very different story. We went out for a couple of lunches, had long text conversations daily, were walking or training together and having coffee pretty much every day, then she decided to cut things off despite still being cordial. She wanted to keep some connection, just at arm‚Äôs-length. When I would grow frustrated and ignore her, she‚Äôd come closer. When I gave her just a bit too much attention, she‚Äôd pull away. This kept going for months, although slowly she was drifting away.

More recently, she‚Äôs showing interest again and we‚Äôre hanging out at the gym and having coffee sometimes. We were at a group dinner on Thursday, then kicked on for drinks. Her and I were the last two to leave, despite her saying the day before that she would need to go home with another woman who was at the dinner so I shouldn‚Äôt expect her to stay late. She got in trouble at home for coming back well after midnight, I‚Äôve now seen her every day since for walks/coffee and today for a drink in the afternoon. Even the drink arrangements were odd, as she initially said yes, then no, I told her I was already on the way and she said it was too rushed and she didn‚Äôt have time so I turned around and went home, only for her to turn there expecting to see me. Totally bizarre! She messaged me and I drove down to meet her, although she‚Äôd left too and had to turn back. We had fun once we met, but the flakiness is just weird.

Anyway, any thoughts on what she is thinking? I‚Äôve been clear from the outset that I have no expectations for this to be a physical relationship, although I also haven‚Äôt ruled it out if it is something she wants and would be comfortable going that way. I just love her company and catching up somewhat frequently is enough, but I can‚Äôt help but think she‚Äôs torn between wanting more but not wanting to betray her morals.

We moved in not long ago and are at a loss. It all started when we were given a very similar [couch](https://www.rhlee.com/auctions/26681/lot/25847-brown-leather-sofa-with-dark-nail-head-trim-68-3122)  from my parents when we moved into our house. We were initially looking at buying a Crate and Barrel couch or similar but then with faced with saving close to $3K we took their couch and it's two partners - two loveseats that are oversized (they cannot fit in this space without it looking terrible). The issue is, I have no idea how to style it, I also am a first time homeowner, and all the decisions are quite overwhelming. I do not want the room to look like it's out of the early 2000s. 

We are both into more MCM/meets some boho/ LIGHTLY southwest vibes so this could land somewhere in there I think with the right rug and coffee table?

Here(https://imgur.com/Tgdzx1K) is the old listing photo of the living room. None of that furniture is there (thank goodness!) but the set up is very similar. 

The door in the photo leads to our side entrance/that is the main entrance. We do have a dining table that we were planning on putting where the old owners had theirs. We also do have a small bench set up by the door, and coat hooks up above. Already regretting that, since we see all the clutter - and almost wish we would've gone with something closed off.

Thoughts on the room overall? Our current rug under the couch is a brown/red/white and doesn't look right and really drags everything down. The floor is pine, and transitions to an almost terracotta tile from the entry to the other section which is the kitchen. It is all a little too open and I have tinkered with the idea of building out a divider from living room to the dining area/kitchen to give some visual separation. Additionally each of those windows does have cellular shades built in. To the left of the photo there are two smaller windows, which we need to find curtains for.",0,1733755220.0,DesignMyRoom,0,0.5,False

The principal character is a girl who was found in remote woods near the Canadian border by a hunter and his dog, abandoned...probably because she was born with six functional arms. And other 'extras,' but that's what you'd notice first...

Question 1: There was a post here recently about someone claiming to have difficulty obtaining a birth certificate and passport due to uncertain circumstances of his birth. That would be a useful plot point if it's a legitimate concern. Would the circumstances of abandonment (no witnesses to the birth, date/time uncertain, she might have been smuggled in from another state or even across the border from Canada) plausibly lead to difficulties with issuance of a birth certificate/passport/citizenship, etc.?

Question 2: In the story, her adoptive parents (she was legally adopted by local residents after being found and treated) have taken pains to make sure that she is NOT a public figure...refusing all interview requests, eschewing publicity, etc. So, after that initial burst of notoriety, she grows up in small-town obscurity. But, then, on her eighteenth birthday, three freelance journalists show up at her after-school job with hidden cameras. They want to get a long-form interview with her on video, and then they want to shop it around to the highest-bidding media outlets now that she's legally old enough to move out of her parents' umbrella, and they're prepared to do it on the sly figuring that they can settle any legal/permissions questions afterwards for comparative pennies. Her job is at a combination coffeehouse/soda fountain (Coffee 'n Cream), so it's a public location with no restrictions on cameras posted. What key phrases might the journalists (they're kind of sleazy) slip into the conversation so that they can later argue that the interview was authorized and that they have the right to market and sell it without further compensation to her? Something like, ""Mind if I ask you some questions?"" and so forth (They **don't** reveal their identities or true purpose).

Ralph sat back in his plush leather chair and felt a satisfying, perfect softness supporting his tired back as he took a deep breath of relief and sipped his glass of expensive whiskey. The evening view of the gleaming city lights from his new office penthouse was definitely spectacular. He nodded to himself with approval, it'd been a great idea to build this second location now that he was transitioning out of the industrial/building sector and into the more lucrative section of household commodities.

He'd hatched the plan one morning as he was sweetening his coffee with an artificial sweetener. Couldn't this simple idea of substitution be applied on a more massive scale? In more markets than simply food? Surely there were other situations where you could get away with having something that wasn't the real thing to supplant or be a temporary stand-in for the real thing?

Throwing out some feelers via his industrial contacts, he got in touch with a research group that was looking for funding. After explaining his idea in general terms, their founder, a woman named Theresa, assured him that they'd have a working prototype of a product in six months.

As time went on though, he started feeling uneasy about the lack of communication. So he schedduled a meeting with Theresa in his office and that same morning she showed up, at seven o clock, on the dot.

Looking at her across the desk, he saw that she was still wearing a lab coat, which looked the same as the day he'd met her. He wondered if she ever took that thing off. She met his gaze with a slightly amused smile of her own, as if she deep down knew what he was thinking of her.

""So."" He started, not sure how he was going to begin. Then his instincts kicked in. ""It's been months and I haven't heard a shred of information about your progress. You refuse to say what kind of project you're working on, only that you assure me that it's going to revolutionize a part of the industry. I'm afraid that isn't good enough. My investors are getting nervous.""

The last bit of was a lie of course, because the rather paltry sum he'd invested had come from his own pockets. But an investment needed some kind of assurance after all. Thinking back to his tour of their facilities, he couldn't remember what they had talked about, only that the details seemed to apply to his general ideas. He shook his head and looked up from the table at her.

He felt a chill down his spine as it felt like she hadn't moved even the slightest bit since she'd sat down.

With a reassuring tone of voice, she replied, ""I completely understand where you're coming from Mr Lester. Perhaps this will put your mind at ease. You see, at Demarcation, we pride ourselves in our ability to finish what we started. As a show of faith, we'd like to offer you this.""

She produced a briefcase that she put on the table and opened, facing him. It was filled to the brim with money. He stared at it in surprise before tilting his head to look at her behind it.

""Money? I don't understand.""

Her smile widened just a bit. ""It's simple, this is your investment in its entirety, plus a bonus of 15%. Should we fail to show you a functioning prototype of any kind at the end of our agreed-upon period, you keep all of this money and still make a profit.""

He blinked and screwed up his face in disbelief. ""What? That's... you're serious aren't you?""

She shrugged, her facial expression suddenly unreadable. ""We are. Feel free to examine the money, I assure you, it'll be to your satisfaction.""

And that's how the meeting ended. Naturally, he'd taken the case of money to the bank under the pretense that he believed it to be counterfeit. However, even the most in-depth analysis failed to detect anything wrong with it. So, with a sense of elated happiness, he stored the whole thing in his safety deposit box and relaxed while he patiently waited for the results.


* * * *

Then about two and a half months later, he got a call from Theresa, inviting him to a test demo of the product that they'd produced. The code name ""Nu-lite"" seemed ambitious and as he arrived at the facility, he had no idea what to think of any of it.

As they led him into a big warehouse, his jaw dropped at the scene in front of him. The entire interior had been converted into what looked like a city street at night. Complete with buildings, cars, crosswalks, mailboxes, the works. His mind reeled at the level of detail they'd put into it. Every window looked meticulously arranged, even the pawn shop window which had that kind of desolate feeling to it wherever you went. The residential windows had flowers, curtains, and lighting. It was all extremely convincing to the point where he got startled as Theresa touched him gently on his arm. He stared at her for a moment, not sure what to think of any of this. What was this?

She smiled at him, but her smile never seemed to reach her eyes. ""I'm sure you're feeling a bit surprised by all of this. Let me explain. Do you see that lamppost over there?""

And as he looked at it, he had the startling realization that the light was somehow unusual. But he couldn't put his finger on it until he realized that it seemed like the cone of light coming from it wasn't entirely three-dimensional. It somehow looked... flat?

Walking from the dimly lit area of the double doors, he found himself enveloped in darkness and even though he could see the cone of light, he still couldn't almost see himself. It was as if the light was there, but at the same time wasn't. Stepping into the cone of light, he could see that all around the cone of light, there was only darkness. The effect was mesmerizing as he stepped in and out of the light. From the outside, he could see the area was well-lit, but as he stepped inside, he couldn't almost see anything outside of the cone.

""So, can one of you more... technically minded people run this by me again?"" He said, looking lost.

A younger, female researcher stepped into the light, startling him. Her round gold-rimmed glasses gleamed convincingly in the light as she smiled faintly. ""Sir, it's rather simple, our new product, tentatively named 'Nu-lite' isn't actually light at all.""

""It isn't?"" He said, now feeling even more confused.

""No, it's just the... hmm, perception of light you see. The device above you isn't actually producing photons at all. It's merely projecting a reconstituted version of this scene into your mind, allowing your brain to believe that this area is, in fact, lit. However, since the human visual cortex is limited, I'm afraid we haven't worked out the kinks yet in allowing this... err uh... un-light if you will, to propagate beyond the cone itself.""

He adjusted his tie, feeling even more concerned about the fact that his mind might be told to see things rather than seeing them. Then he ventured another question, ""so what's stopping us from making a kind of lamp that lights everything then?""

Her smile faded a bit, a thing he didn't like at all as she said with forced enthusiasm, ""ah, that wouldn't... I mean, it's not."" She looked at him with a briefly troubled face before she concluded, ""it caused hemorrhaging in the test subjects when we tried cones bigger than this Sir. I wouldn't recommend it.""

He looked up straight into the lamp itself and marveled at how he didn't have to squint at it. The light was warm, comfortable, and perfectly tuned. He shrugged, ""well, we'll just have everyone sign a disclaimer and a warning NDA. It'll be fine.""

About a year later, the first NuLite (tm) lamps were ordered by a middle-sized municipality looking for a gimmick to put them in the media spotlight. As the news spread about this revolutionary new technology, voices both for and against this new technology were raised in the media. Most of the voices against were silenced when it became public knowledge that this new technology required only a fraction of the power of even the most efficient LED light.

Six months later they had not only recouped their investment, but were making bank as orders were even coming in from overseas. It seemed the whole world was interested in slashing energy costs despite the obvious limitations of the product. There was even talk in the scientific community that this might be a Nobel prize-worthy invention.

A lazy Friday afternoon as Ralph was taking a snooze in his office (he loved his comfy chair) his phone on the desk rang. Rousing himself from a disjointed dream, he picked up the phone and automatically announced his corporation's name and his own as he spoke.

""We have another invention ready to demonstrate."" Theresa's voice said in a flat tone of voice.

It took him a moment to recognize her as he replied, ""Ah, Theresa, a new demo? What do you mean?""

""Sir, did you not say that you had a vision for a world with more things... substituted?""

He found himself nodding. ""Yes, YES!"" Then he excitedly added, ""But I was thinking that we would take it step by step, have a meeting, discuss terms and ideas and projections perhaps.""

""Yes, we can certainly do that if our new product doesn't meet with your approval. You see, we were so intrigued by your idea of substitution that a few of us hatched another idea and cobbled together something interesting for you. I think it'll be a hit.""

He felt the excitement rise in him as he realized that he may have struck a gold mine with this partnership. ""I'd love to see what you've got made up. When can I be there?""

Theresa's voice took on an almost seductive quality as she said, ""how about my place? I'll treat you to a dinner you'll never forget.""

Feeling bewildered, Ralph stammered, ""I-I... yes? Sure, but what does that have to do with the demo?""

He could hear the smile in her voice now, ""The dinner is intimately connected to our new product. You'll see soon enough. I'll pick you up at ten PM.""

And with that, she hung up on him. He put down the phone and buried his face in his hands, what the hell was she on about? A dinner demoing a new product? What would it possibly be? Was she coming on to him? No, he was sure she was as stone cold as a rock face on Uranus.

He snapped out of his confused thoughts when he realized with a start that she didn't have his home address. And he certainly wasn't going to stay in the office until ten o clock, he had planned to leave at three! But as he phoned her number, there wasn't even a dial tone or a notice that the number itself was out of order, there simply was nothing.

Hanging up the phone, he spent a few minutes wondering if he was going to have his driver drop him off at the demo warehouse. But ultimately when his stomach growled (as he'd slept through lunch and then some) he decided that if she didn't have the good sense to have a working phone or to verify details like that, she could face the consequences of that herself.

A few hours later, he was back home again in his expansive mansion, now feeling reinvigorated after a decent meal and some drinks with the boys at the club. Relaxing on his favorite sofa, he tried to watch a courtroom drama show, but the whole time his thoughts kept drifting back to the mystery behind Theresa and her company. Dozing off, he was awakened by his butler a few hours later at precisely ten PM.

""Sir, I'm sorry to wake you, but a woman is requesting your company outside the compound,"" the butler said apologetically.

He looked up at the butler in disbelief. ""A woman? At this hour? I'm not..."" and here he remembered the ""date"" and nodded as he added, ""Ah yes, tell her I'll be right out.""

Throwing on some of his best clothes in a blur, he hurried out to the gates of his expansive garden until he saw her through the bars. As the gate opened, he found that she was leaning against a small car that appeared to be an old Lada, but it didn't quite look like one somehow.

He smiled sheepishly at her as he realized that while he had dressed up, she was still wearing that same old lab coat as always.

""I'm very sorry, but I didn't think to give you my home address you know?"" He said, feeling an odd, misplaced sense of shame. Then he added, ""by the way, how did you find out where I live? This address is secret for a reason you know. I paid good money to have this anonymized.""

She gave him the tiniest of smiles as she got into the car and opened the passenger side door for him. ""We have an extremely good information network. That's all I'm allowed to say. Partner confidentiality and such. I'm sure you understand.""

As he got into the car, although it looked old, he noticed that it didn't have that tell-tale musty smell that all cars developed after a while. As she sped away into the night though, his thoughts turned to the dashboard which had a configuration he'd never seen before.  He gave her a look which she didn't return as her eyes seemed glued to the road ahead of them.

""Wow, I've never seen a dashboard like this before, what does all of this stuff mean?"" He ventured, trying to make some casual conversation.

Without tearing her eyes off the road for even a second, she replied, ""It's a prototype that I'm testing out as a matter of fact. You could call it a true concept car."" And here for some reason, she giggled a bit to herself in a shrill way that sent chills down his spine.

A few moments of silence passed before she spoke again. ""Have you ever considered how mechanical an old combustion vehicle such as this is? All those bolts and things rattling, engine roaring, tires making noises against the road?""

Ralph shrugged as he didn't have anything substantial to say. ""I guess? I never thought about it that way. Why do you ask?""

""Well, this car isn't mechanical you see,"" she said with a neutral face. ""Do not be alarmed at what happens next,"" she added before she pushed a button on the dashboard.

At first, Ralph thought he'd gone completely deaf when she'd pushed the button, and he yelped a bit in surprise which calmed him down. That's when he realized that she'd somehow completely quieted down the car. Not just silenced or muted the sound, but completely suppressed it.

""How... how did you do that? That's not physically possible."" He said with chills running down his spine.

She smiled a bit and took her hands off the steering wheel that vanished into the dashboard. It was only then that he noticed that all the windows had turned completely opaquely black.

""It's another idea we hatched, we call it the ultimate car, because it's built with a revolutionary new technology that allows us to bend the laws of physics in new and interesting ways."" Here she looked at him and smiled in an almost loving way as she added, ""your vision made this real Ralph, it's so beautiful and we owe this all to you. But, we can talk more about this new product over dinner. After all, you haven't seen the actual product yet. This is just a beta product at this stage, we need more refinement, adaptation, accessibility, and intimacy with it. Now, shall we head up to my apartment?""

He stared at her crestfallen, ""What? We've arrived?""

She nodded enthusiastically. ""Yes, actually we arrived when I activated the suppressor device which had a lot of fascinating effects which I'll detail to you later. We can safely exit the vehicle now."" And with that, she opened her door which caused all the windows to resume their transparency again.

As she opened the door, the din of the late-night traffic suddenly seemed to fill the car's cabin again and for a moment, Ralph felt like it was extremely loud. When he stumbled out of the vehicle and looked at it, it seemed like just some old beat-up car. He shook his head in amazement, never judge a book by its cover!

Looking around at the neighborhood, he realized that it was in a more run-down part of the city and he recognized it as being on the other side of town. He looked at his watch; 10:18 and laughed nervously to himself. That drive would have taken two hours with the traffic at this hour and she'd somehow done it in eighteen minutes?!

""Are you coming?"" She said, making him look up at her as she was now standing at the top of the stairs leading to the apartment building.

""I ... yes, but... how?"" He said, pointing at the car in disbelief.

She laughed which sounded incredibly insincere as she looked at him with an odd smile. ""Like I said, I will explain all of the fantastic features that this type of vehicle offers at a later date. But yes, it can do things regular cars could never do. My advice is that you find it acceptable and move on. Preferably to my apartment where I can serve you a fantastic dinner.""

Mentally shrugging to himself, he realized that the only way to avoid going completely mad would be to simply take her word for it. She was the expert after all and everything about it was way over his head anyway. He walked up the stairs and into the run-down lobby of the building and soon enough he found himself in her apartment.

As she closed the door behind him, he noticed that she wasn't locking it, which was an odd thing to do at this time of night. He shrugged it off as he hung his overcoat on an elegantly decorated coat stand. Turning around, he found himself standing in an apartment that was the definition of elegance. Beautiful 1950s curtains framed the windows to the street which made the outside neon lights seem almost nostalgic. Walking into the living room, he found it to have an odd mishmash of different eras that still seemed to somehow fit together. In a corner, a small poker table was set up with what looked like Tudor-era chairs. Cramped in a corner was a wase that looked very expensive as it was made out of the most delicate fine china. The flower sticking out of it was nothing short of breathtaking as it had an almost iridescent quality to it.

The more he looked around the room, the more confused he got. By his estimate, this room alone must have cost a fortune to decorate in this way, assuming that all of it wasn't just cheap replicas. As he ran his finger over the table, which had inlaid gemstones that looked very authentic to his trained eye, he felt his mind wanting to scream and jump out the window.

Drawing in a sharp breath, he suddenly became aware of her standing in the doorway, smiling that unnerving smile of hers.

""Dinner's ready."" She said with a matter-of-fact voice as she ventured back into the kitchen area.

Getting up, he realized that he was very hungry and when he entered the kitchen, he saw that it was done up in a classic IKEA style which compared to the living room, made it look extremely sterile somehow. The smell coming off the plates that were filled with big steaks, perfectly oven-baked potatoes, and a big bowl of gravy made his mouth water. Sitting down by the table, he realized that now, more than ever, her lab coat seemed to be incredibly out of place.

Following his gaze, she looked down at herself and chuckled. ""Ah yes, I wear my coat so often that I sometimes forget that I should maybe change into other things. Just a moment."" She said as she got up from her chair and left the kitchen.

A short while after, she came in and now she was wearing what seemed to be just a simple white T-shirt and some faded jeans. She smiled at him as she sat down again at the table. ""Compared to you, I'm under-dressed, but I hope you won't mind. This is what I feel is acceptable to wear after a long day at the lab.""

""Oh, no no, it's my fault, I should have realized this wasn't a formal affair. I guess I'm a bit out of touch these days,"" he replied to her as now he felt like the odd one out. Why had he decided to wear this to what would be something akin to a date? It didn't make sense.

Then as she poured red wine from a beautiful hexagonal decanter and sat down again, they both started in on their meal.

As he bit into the steak, Ralph could tell that it was definitely expensive. While it looked mundane, it had a quality of chew and flavor that was just incredible. The gravy and potatoes were the same kind as well. Perfectly cooked, savory, and with just the right amount of seasoning.

When he took a sip from the wine, he wasn't surprised when it turned out to be of a vintage that tasted better than the sip of Domaine de la Roman√©e-Conti that he'd bought for an extreme sum once. It was simply beautifully put together. When she asked him a question, he first didn't hear it as his entire awareness was completely focused on the meal.

He looked up at her, ""Sorry, I didn't catch that.""

""Are you finding the meal to be to your satisfaction?"" She said with a face that had her trademark inscrutable facade plastered all over it.

""Yes, absolutely,"" he replied emphatically, ""I haven't had a meal this good in over a decade. This is extraordinary.""

She nodded with a satisfied look on her face. ""Good, what you're eating is actually a reconfigured matter-substitute made out of bricks of bio-matter."" Then she smiled as she leaned in and added, ""don't worry, it is not the carcasses of dead humans.""

When he realized her joke, he laughed unexpectedly and looked down at his food, it seemed to be perfectly what it was. But some kind of bio-matter? He looked up at her again and said, ""then what is it?"" with a voice that sounded a bit more anxious than he'd liked it to be.

Laughing at him, she exclaimed, ""It's grass actually! And I know what you're thinking, humans can't digest grass now can they? But we found a way to make that kind of bio-matter compatible with the human physiology. Besides, grass was the only biological matter that offered the malleability that we required for the creation process of the final product.‚Äù

""What do you mean?"" He said, not feeling entirely like he was understanding her.

""Simply put, we've recorded the mental and sensory imagery of a person eating this dinner to make a sort of substitution that we then apply to the bio-bricks that reshape them into matter that will produce the required sensation when they're consumed.""

""So, this dinner isn't real?"" He said with a strange feeling in his chest.

""No, it's quite real, but you're not actually eating a steak. You're eating a synthesized matter construct that produces the flavor that's expected of a good steak. Nutritionally though, it certainly isn't the same of course. But in terms of flavor, it's perfect.""

""What's the difference?"" He said as he sipped his wine, savoring it.

""Essentially, while you might be thinking a meal like this would put a lot of calories into your system, in reality, you're eating basically what amounts to a single leaf of lettuce in terms of nutrition."" She said with a pleased smile on her face as she finished off her glass of wine.

""And the wine?"" He said, feeling bewildered.

""It's a liquid form of the same product, however, we haven't been able to replicate the sensation of alcohol impairment just yet. For now, though, it will taste just as any alcohol-infused beverage should taste, but it will not have an effect on your system.""

He looked at his wine glass and tried to wrap his head around it. Here he was, sipping what to him felt like the most expensive wine in the world. But in reality, it was just... liquid grass?

""This is incredible Theresa, do you realize what you've done here? You may have changed the face of modern society if we can make a breakthrough with it. So, how many dishes do you have prepared so far?""

Her face grew very serious as she said, ""For now, only this dish, the necessary process for manufacturing the bricks was the tricky part. However, finding the perfect 'donor' for the dish itself was very difficult. You see, we need to have people with a perfect sense of taste and enjoyment of a certain dish if we are to make the perfect substitute dish template.""

He leaned towards her excitedly as he said, ""I can help with that! I know plenty of people in the food industry who--""

She shook her head dismissively, ""no, we don't need famous people or people with their own agendas. We have found a suitable candidate once and I have faith in our recruitment process. While I appreciate your offer for assistance, we will manage this on our own.""

He found his mouth feeling dry as she merely stared at him now, completely still. After a tense few minutes of silence, he nodded at her. ""Alright, we'll play it your way. After all, your results are changing the world here. But, just one question, so you say that this tastes like fatty food, but you can't live off it?""

Her face remained serious. ""No, in fact, we need to be very clear in our product information that this does not replace food in any shape or form. It's merely a substitute. A human that would eat this exclusively would starve to death eventually.""

He nodded at her, already mentally imagining all the warning labels that would come with this food. Then he thought of something and said, ""So, what do you suggest we call this product?""

She waved dismissively at him and said, ""you can figure that out by yourself, you're the person who does the marketing. Just ensure that the name doesn't make people associate it with actual food. That should be enough.""

And with that, they wrapped up their meal, and twenty minutes later, he waved goodbye to her as she drove off in her strange experimental car. As the vehicle slowly moved down the street, he kept looking at it, wondering if it would do something strange when she'd no doubt put it into the strange noiseless state. But as it kept slowly going down the road, he eventually lost sight of it in the darkness, headed inside, and promptly went to bed.

The day after, he woke up ravenously hungry and as he feasted on a breakfast of pancakes, he realized that the ""food"" from the previous night had a serious drawback to it. But then he giggled to himself like a boy about to make some mischief when he remembered those horrible-tasting dinner replacement packs. With a few modifications and adjustments, they'd be the perfect match for the person wanting to live cheaply. You'd be able to eat the finest, most unhealthy-tasting fast food you ever wanted, but what you'd then eat later in the day would be a shake of actual nutrients that would satisfy your body‚Äôs needs. It was indeed a gold mine in the making!

The rest of the year was a blur as they launched their food substitute called GastroSubst which was marketed as a ""Gastronomical Experience"" rather than food. During all interviews, Ralph constantly had to remind everyone that this was not food, it was not a dish, it was not a dinner, it was a substitute that mimicked the experience of eating food. But it was absolutely not food.

During this time, they also launched ""The Concept of a Car"" or The COAC as it was nicknamed quickly after a lot of car enthusiasts bought it and extolled its virtues to everyone. And of course, a lot of them forced open the hood of the car, only to find that the innards had completely melted. All of the attempts at returns of those vehicles were met with a swift lawsuit from Demarcation Incorporated as they had breached the terms of service for their concept of a car.

At this point, Ralph started to notice more and more that there were articles highlighting some of the dangers of the products themselves. One video clip that he found was of a guy who had stolen two of the NuLite fixtures from street lamps. In the video, the man said that people needed to know the truth as he angled both lights towards a single source which was a cage containing a rat.

Ralph shook his head during the explanation as he knew fully well that NuLite ""light"" didn't show up on any recordings as it didn't exist in the physical sense. But his ridicule quickly turned to a deep-rooted sense of fear as the man on the video proceeded to explain that as well, pointing to two LEDs on each light that would indicate if the light was on or not.

Then he exited the room and the camera above the cage focused on the rat while keeping the diodes in full view. When they both turned green, the rat first started moving erratically, then it stopped as its eyes began to bleed along with its ears. It seemed to cough a bit before it flopped over on its side and stopped moving. Feeling sick to his stomach, Ralph closed the video and sat at his desk trembling. NDAs and instructions were one thing, but if the wrong department got wind of this, he might be facing lawsuits from god knows how many people who‚Äôd been stupid enough to repeat this experiment as a dare. Not to mention the potential terrorism applications.

No, he had to nip this in the bud immediately. A few calls later he had a name and for the next couple of days, he hammered out an agreement with the person in question. Then, after a few million dollars had changed hands, the issue was truly and well buried. For now.

But he knew this was just a stopgap measure as there were obviously more such incidents just waiting to happen. He resolved to contact Theresa about it as this was something that they needed to work out. In a worst-case scenario, they'd do a recall, but the financial implications of such a wide recall with a media fallout made him feel like throwing up.

Weeks passed with no more incidents and soon enough Ralph felt like maybe the worst of it was over. After all, there were plenty of products out there that were dangerous if misused right? And they had printed warnings in BIG RED LETTERS in all documentation sent to the customers. Legally speaking, they were fully covered as the blatant misuse of their product wasn't their problem. And how would it work if everyone selling dangerous products were liable for misuse?

At this point, he was even second-guessing his buy-out of that guy with the rat, but he justified it with the thought that he'd just spent some money to avoid negative publicity.

Then the big discussion about GastroSubst started in the media and the politicians got involved. First, the accusation was that the product was addictive, but after some well-placed lawsuits and an inquiry by the federal department of health, it was shown that the product wasn't at all addictive. However, subsequent studies done by the scientific community even helped boost sales a bit as it was shown that the reason people preferred GastroSubst over regular food was that it tasted so good that they couldn't live without it. The discourse in the media continued with voices claiming that GastroSubst was ruining cooking culture around the world since nothing could compete with its perfection. Then the media violently swung the other way when one of the biggest antagonistic voices, a certain Berthold Brent was shown to have several GastroSubst fabricators in his home, and also a lifetime supply of the bricks required to make the food.

Sales soared again after that, with people seemingly having accepted it as a part of life. Besides, nothing could match the culinary experience of it with the same price tag. Rich people of course still spent money on real food, but they were among the elite, so it was just viewed as an eccentricity. Amid this positive blitz, he still had a very bad day when he read a statement from the daughter of an old elderly woman who had starved to death, eating only GastroSubst.

According to the article, the daughter had regularly checked up on her as she was suffering from bouts of dementia that required her to help out. But when the daughter got sick for a few weeks and couldn't visit her on the daily, her mother stopped communicating with her. Fearing the worst, she made her way to the apartment to find that her already malnourished mother had simply starved to death. Of course, she blamed the brand, saying that she'd tried to get her mother to stop ""eating that damn fake food crap"", but she'd still been unable to dissuade her from eating a specific recipe that the mother said reminded her of her younger, happier days.

There was of course no media blitz this time, mostly because the public had simply accepted the reality of the product. Besides, Ralph‚Äôs attention had already shifted else as there were reports of people using the Concept Cars and vanishing suddenly. They‚Äôd left, but then never shown up where they were supposed to go. But it wasn‚Äôt until the governing body for automobile safety opened up an official inquiry that again sent sales into turmoil that Ralph decided that enough was enough.

He tried for a week to reach them over the phone, over email, and then sent them a sternly worded letter through the regular mail, requesting a meeting to ""address the very serious issues with several of the substitution products.""

When the letter went unanswered, and no calls came back he made his way down to the warehouse where the first demo had been run. When he stepped out of the expensive car, he told his driver to wait. But now, the building seemed different somehow until he realized that the fa√ßade was completely changed. Instead of the sleek surface and sign detailing Demarcation Incorporated, he was staring at a run-down factory front. Going inside, he still saw the same big empty area as before, but there wasn‚Äôt a trace of any of the buildings, or the road that had all been authentic.

Feeling panic now, he rushed out into the car and told his driver to step on it and gave him the address to Theresa's apartment, knowing full well that it was unlikely that he'd find anything there either. A few hours later, he managed to get the janitor to let him into the lobby which was as shabby as it had been before. But when he got up to the floor where she'd lived, the janitor (after being handed a few hundred dollar bills) opened the door and said that the previous tenant had broken the lease at least a week ago.

Staring into the apartment, he suddenly felt an intense need to throw up. Because in the middle of the living room area was the body of Theresa, splayed out on a scuffed sofa. However, when he walked up to her and carefully touched her face, the entire shape collapsed into a skin-colored dust.

Mixed in with the dust, he could make out a calling card which he lifted with fingers that felt like they were a million miles away. It was a simple white card with an old-style typewriter font written on it. It simply said:

    DEMARCATION INCORPORATED
    Proxies, copies, substitutes for all!

    We hope you have been fully 
    satisfied with this OrganoPerson

    For business inquiries 
    please call us at our
    usually listed number


As he fell to his knees, he whimpered a bit, because now he knew his life as it had been was completely over. They'd rake him over the coals, make him their patsy, and probably throw him in jail where he'd rot until he died of old age, or worse.

The thought that came to him made him giggle hysterically, then his giggle turned into a deranged laughter as he found it so ironically hilarious.

**Obviously, he just needed a substitute for himself!**

END

Author's note: Sometimes you write an ending and you find yourself knowing more than your audience does. So, you ask yourself, would this story be better if I included this in the ending? Would the reader be more or less satisfied knowing this? 

But I know there are definitely two wolves here. One wants the information, a story without a satisfying climax is not a story that's good. The other (which is the camp I fall into myself), sometimes finds that a story with less information stimulates the mind, making you think about what it could be. The so-called ""post-processing"" and discussion with other people about the themes in the story are almost more enjoyable than the story itself. 

So, I put this choice to you dear reader, and it's a faustian one. Is the added ending more satisfying? You don't know of course. I don't know either and I'm not going to make that choice for you. So, either you stop reading now and close the tab in your browser, or you scroll down and keep reading.

Tick Tock.

***Extra ending begins***

He heard the sound of footsteps behind him, and a familiar voice rang out. ""Was she to your satisfaction?""

Wiping his tears, he got up and turned around and there she was, same as ever, Theresa. She smiled at him with what seemed like genuine affection as she stepped forward, eyeing his face intently and nodding to herself.

""Theresa!"" He exclaimed, at a loss for words. 

Her smile didn't waver for a second. ""'Not quite, I'm an improved model.""

He felt the anger rising inside of him as he spat out, ""you're not fucking real, you're‚Ä¶ just like all the other mindfucking crap that your shitty corporation makes. Fuck with our heads, make us see and hear and do things that aren't real, is that what it's all about for you? No care if someone dies? If someone suffers?""

She smiled, and this time it felt genuine to him. ""Oh, but you didn't care at first, did you? Our test researcher, that sweet little thing with the glasses? Tailored towards being slightly attractive and innocent. Young-sex-submissive vector. She even produced a stammer, indicating insecurity. It was meant to induce follow-up questions, producing a moral response. You never asked about that person experiencing the aneurysm, and you never asked what happened with our donors either for the GastroSubst program.""

Feeling dizzy, he tried to steady himself as his entire body was shaking. ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ happened to them?‚Äù

She leaned against the door frame as she giggled in a happy, carefree way. ‚ÄúWhy they all died of course. A necessary trade-off to make a superior product. You knew at some level, but as long as the money rolled in and the customers were happy, you didn‚Äôt want to know.‚Äù

""But‚Ä¶ but why? Why make products that kill people? Food that doesn't feed you, cars that make you vanish, lights that burn out your brain, why?""

She sighed in the way a teacher sighs when a student fails to understand the simplest of lessons. ""That wasn't on purpose, it was just one of those issues we could never work out. You see, you humans are so fragile. You have no idea how little it takes to kill one of you. A misplaced neuron here, a misstep in a hormone balance, lack of nutrients, exposure to even the slightest of pressures, you just‚Ä¶ die. It's very unfortunate, but since you keep making so many more of you, it's no concern of ours.""

His voice was hoarse now as he ground out, ‚Äúwhat happened with the people in the cars? You did something to them didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù

She shook her head with an apologetic smile. ‚ÄúNot at all, we DID warn you that the compartment needed to be perfectly isolated when traveling using our special technology. But like you humans do, you didn't listen. And well, ever seen an egg explode in a pressure chamber? Same thing, but with a lot more red and mushy bits.""

""What the hell are you?""

She looked up at the ceiling as if trying to pierce it with her gaze. ""I'm technically nobody. I don't exist in the physical world as you know it. You've already realized this by now. The entity that controls me has as much common with you as you'd have with an ant. But imagine if you could talk to an ant, do experiments, figure out solutions for them, and see how they use those solutions in their everyday life, would you all do that as well? And how would you feel if a bunch of ants died because they didn't heed your warnings? Wouldn't you be slightly annoyed? Angry even?""

He felt his knees grow weak again as he said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs inhuman!‚Äù

Upon hearing that, her grin got wider and wider until it felt like the whole world was composed of just her mouth. Then she said with the voice of thunder that tore through his brain like a hailstorm of bullets. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not wrong.‚Äù",1,1733754814.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1haau2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/MauLer/comments/1haau2w/something_people_dont_understand_about_droids/,Something People Don't Understand About Droids,"One of the biggest misconceptions in Star Wars (by design, I'll get into it) is that droids don't actually have personalities. They are built to accomplish tasks, and are so far advanced that the way that people interact with them is similar to how we interact with employees because that's usually more efficient and effective than pressing buttons.

It's weird to explain, but just think about how much easier it would be to make your morning coffee if instead of pressing buttons on a coffee maker you said: ""Hey, buddy, make me a cup of coffee. You know how I like it,"" then the coffee maker confirmed it with ""I'll do that for you, my friend,"" and it made the coffee, then gave it to you.

It's an idea that appeared in THX-1138 that in the future it will just be completely normal to treat machines as people even if it seems strange, or even depressing, to think about it right now. We can't imagine literally talking to our computer like it is a friend to order something online, but in the future our children might consider it completely normal. Heck, at a certain point in the future it might be normal to not have any human friends and interact almost exclusively with machines.

Basically, droids in Star Wars act similar to how AI acts these days, acting like a real person but functionally just responding to what people request of them. A droid might only be built to serve drinks in a bar, and be programmed to engage in conversations with people, but functionally they only serve drinks and have a pre-loaded list of ways to respond.

So, why do droids in Star Wars, especially C-3P0 and R2D2 have personalities? Well, R2D2 doesn't really have a personality, he just responds to things and performs tasks. The intention of R2D2 is that we're supposed to interpret what he does as though he has a personality. So, if someone asks ""How are you doing, R2D2?"" he'll respond with holding out a lighter and flashing a 'thumbs up' sign because that's how he was programmed to respond. If someone asks him to do something that goes against what he was told to do, he'll shake his head because that's one of his programmed responses, that's why he was built with the functionality to do those things in the first place.

What about C-3P0? Well, in A New Hope it is established that C-3P0 is broken. He is a defective droid who follows his programming, but the responses he generates are defective. He needs to be repaired, but the repairs never happen.

What about in the Disney universe or the Clone Wars universe? Well, the droids not having a personality but acting as though they do was mainly a George thing because he was pretty interested in that idea, so it's mainly only a thing in the Lucas movies, and pretty much everywhere else the people involved are unaware of that idea or have no idea how to make it work like George did, so, in most Star Wars canon with droids that idea is mostly ignored in favour of just having the droids have personalities with little thought going into the mechanics behind it.

It's something I find very frustrating when talking about the droids in Star Wars because something that will inevitably come up when I say ""What's interesting about R2D2 is that he actually doesn't have a personality,"" which will be countered with ""Uhhhh, what, yeah he does,"" and I'll say ""No, he doesn't, but you're supposed to think he does, which is the point. It's like how we'll sometimes look at a robot vacuum and act like it has a personality. The idea is that in the future, every droid is programmed to respond to things in a way that seems to convey personality, and people treat them like they're people because they're so used to it. The audience thinking that R2D2 has a personality is the point,"" and they'll say ""No, it's obvious that R2D2 and C-3P0 have personalities,"" which I'll respond to with ""Yeah, but, C-3P0 is broken. They say it in A New Hope.""

I was listening to EFAP's Star Wars Outlaws coverage with them bringing up how R2D2 has more of a personality than Nyx, and I was like ""Oh no, not them too.""",0,1733754266.0,MauLer,5,0.47,False

We got together for a coffee once and he seemed interested, texting me right after saying how attracted he is to me etc. I‚Äôm a single mom and getting our during the evenings is tough for me but this is the only times he has really invited me out. I have asked numerous times about getting together during the day time and it hasn‚Äôt worked or I get no reply. 

Over the past week there has been a big drop in communication. Which I‚Äôm fine with because frankly, if I‚Äôm not valued enough for a quick text here and there then I‚Äôm moving on anyways. I have no interest in chasing somebody. Since I thought we had really hit it off I figured I‚Äôd let this guy know where I stand. I sent a msg pretty much saying I had been open about my interest in an actual connection with somebody and don‚Äôt really have patience for surface level bs. And I said if he‚Äôs not interested that‚Äôs totally fine like I won‚Äôt be hurt or mad and would wish him all the best. He responded saying it had been a hard week for him and he was having a shitty day and would address my message the next day. Which was kinda odd because it didn‚Äôt need addressing, I don‚Äôt need reassurance of any kind. I was more or less saying here is what‚Äôs I‚Äôm about, take it or leave it. If you take it, I require more effort, if you leave it, all the best. Anyways, I barely heard from him the following day and my msg wasn‚Äôt responded to, which again I was fine with but since he said he would address it, I expected he would. 

So I‚Äôm pretty much done with this but when I do hear from him again what should I say? I want him to think about me at some point and realize he missed a good opportunity. 

AITA for even wanting to do that? I‚Äôm honestly just so sick of people wasting my time. It‚Äôs like people prefer a life behind an online persona and connection isn‚Äôt even real anymore. I‚Äôm always clear about my interests and intentions and expectations, I‚Äôm tired of people wasting my time. I‚Äôm good looking, had a good job and I‚Äôm a good person. I do t understand why everyone is so messed up and why there seems to be this general fear of not being honest. 

Like if he lost interest, why not say so, like a big boy lol. I‚Äôm not bothered really because I‚Äôve clearly avoided a mistake, but I want a good reply for scenarios like this. ",2,1733754125.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

I WFH so I‚Äôm with the puppy a lot but have been diligent in putting him down for ‚Äúnaps‚Äù by crate/ playpen training for about 30-120minutes about 3/4 times throughout the day while I‚Äôm in the other room. Typically he either falls right asleep or whines for about 1 minute when I do this and leave the room but then calms quickly and falls asleep. 

My partner and I have had this puppy just about a month and have not left him totally home alone for longer than 90 minutes. 
All in all our puppy was doing really well being left alone in his crate in another room for those ‚Äúnap‚Äù periods and was doing well being left totally alone when we would run out for coffee or groceries or something. 

However, This week has been hell. We cannot isolate when it changed but Monday I left for about 40 minutes to run and errand and he was fine; no whimpering, no barking, just quiet lamb chop time for the entirety of my absence (we have a puppy camera).

Tuesday, I ran out to the grocery store (literally a 25 minute ordeal) and the ENTIRE TIME I was gone, he was panting, pacing, shrieking. 

Now, If our puppy is left alone for even a minute he starts panicking and barking and panting and shrieking. It is so heartbreaking! 

We‚Äôve dialed it back and have him in his crate rather than playpen when we leave and are back to only leaving for about 5/10 minutes at a time but he‚Äôs still freaking out even in those short increments. We have read really mixed training recommendations and are not sure what to do! We really don‚Äôt want to worsen his separation anxiety but we also want to get him used to being alone.
