1psa0qb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1psa0qb/my_wife_died_yesterday_but_i_still_see_her/,My wife died yesterday but I still see her,"Of course, it wasn’t a slow, painful death; quite the opposite, actually. She had been complaining for a few days about a dull pain in her left abdomen. Nothing dramatic. I took her to the doctor yesterday. Stepped out for an hour; a work call I couldn’t ignore. When I returned, the doctors told me she was gone.

*It made no difference to me.*

Perhaps it should have. But you can’t force a man to cry when his soul has already shriveled into something dry and soundless. There’s this unspoken rule; that loss must be loud, teary, cinematic. But grief, like most things, is quiet and absurd.

No one prepares you for the silence. Not the kind that surrounds you but the kind that comes *from* you. When someone near you dies, your first instinct is to turn to your loved one, the one who helps you make sense of the senseless. We had done that for many years, Emi and I. It would always come from a phone call and then I would turn to her. “Uncle Eli passed away”.

What would come forward would be a series of shared gestures, a kiss, perhaps a hug here and there. To give reassurance to each other, to make sense of the chaos within.

Twenty-three years is a lifetime disguised as borrowed time. That’s twenty-three birthdays, eighteen Valentine’s Days, and at least seventy funerals and odd events and through every one of them, she stood beside me.

But now that someone of mine is gone. And I don’t know who I’m supposed to say those things to anymore.

I keep expecting to feel something more. Anger. Collapse. A scream trying to crawl its way out of my throat. But there’s nothing. Just the knowledge that the world continues; coffee still brews, inboxes still fill, streets still hum with tired people pretending not to notice how absurd it all is.

Maybe that’s the real tragedy. Not that she died. But that it didn’t stop anything. It was the day after yesterday, the morning dew was still fresh, a cold breeze flew from the window and I felt chills in my body. Even though they had asked me to take the week off; it didn’t matter to me. What was I supposed to do? I was already late for work.

They asked me if I’d like to say a few words. I said, ‘She’s dead.’ That was enough. Anything more would’ve been dishonest.

I went home after the hospital because that is what people do. No one had told me otherwise. The elevator smelled faintly of disinfectant and burnt wiring, as it always had. My reflection in the steel doors looked unchanged, which felt like a kind of insult. I half expected grief to rearrange my face, to leave a visible mark, some bruise that might warn others to tread carefully. But the man staring back at me looked like someone returning from a long meeting.

The apartment was quiet in the way only familiar places can be. Not empty—just uninterested. Her shoes were by the door, angled inward as if she had kicked them off carelessly. I considered moving them. I didn’t. It occurred to me, briefly, that I might never move them again. The thought felt less tragic than logistical.

I put my keys in the bowl. One key too many now. I stood there longer than necessary, waiting for something to happen. Nothing did.

The refrigerator light came on when I opened it, obedient as ever. Leftover soup. Milk nearing its expiration date. She had circled it in pen the night before. I could see her handwriting clearly tight, decisive, faintly irritated by inefficiency. I drank the milk anyway. It tasted the same.

The phone rang while I was standing in the kitchen. I let it ring twice longer than I should have, just to see if the sound would provoke anything inside me. It didn’t. When I answered, it was my sister. Her voice had acquired that careful softness people reserve for hospitals and funerals. She asked how I was holding up.

“I’m fine,” I said, which was not a lie. It simply wasn’t an answer.

She paused, waiting for elaboration. I gave her none. Eventually she filled the silence herself, telling me about traffic, about her children, about how strange the weather had been lately. We both pretended this was helpful. When we hung up, I felt relieved, as though I had passed an exam without studying.

That night, I slept on my side of the bed. The other side remained untouched; the sheet still folded back from where she had risen that morning. I noticed the indentation where her body had been, already beginning to fade. It struck me then that memory is more durable than matter, and that this, too, felt unfair.

I woke sometime past midnight. The room was dark, but not entirely. Streetlight spilled through the blinds in thin, uneven stripes. For a moment only a moment I thought she was sitting at the edge of the bed.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t move. I watched.

She wasn’t solid. Not exactly. She looked like a recollection that hadn’t fully decided whether to stay. Her hair was the way she wore it when she didn’t expect company. Her hands were folded in her lap.

“You’re late,” she said.

The voice was right. That was the unsettling part. Not the presence, but the accuracy.

“I know,” I replied.

She nodded, as if this settled something. Then she was gone.

In the morning, I showered longer than usual. I wondered briefly whether I should tell someone about the night. Then I wondered who that someone would be. The doctor? My sister? A man on the street? The idea felt ridiculous. Instead, I dried off, dressed, and went to work.

Work was unchanged. That was its virtue. My inbox was full. Deadlines persisted. Someone asked if I could take a look at a draft before lunch. I said yes. Around noon, a colleague placed a hand on my shoulder and said he was sorry for my loss. His hand lingered too long, as though waiting for me to collapse into it. I thanked him. He looked disappointed.

At lunch, I ate alone. The cafeteria television was playing a game show. People were winning small amounts of money and reacting as though it mattered. I found this mildly comforting.

That evening, there were forms. Death certificates. Insurance claims. Forms that reduced her to checkboxes and signatures. Married. Female. Deceased. I signed my name repeatedly, each time a little less carefully than before. My hand cramped. It felt good to have a physical sensation that could be explained.

I began to notice her presence more often after that. Not always visibly. Sometimes it was just the sense that I was being watched with familiar impatience. Sometimes she corrected me when I reached for the wrong mug. Sometimes she stood in the doorway while I brushed my teeth, shaking her head slightly, the way she used to when she wanted me to notice something obvious.

“You’re doing it wrong,” she said one night as I folded laundry.

“There’s no wrong way,” I replied.

“There is,” she insisted. “You’re mixing things that shouldn’t be mixed.”

I looked down. I was folding her clothes.

I stopped doing that after.

People kept asking if I needed anything. I learned to say no quickly. The faster I answered, the less they insisted. One woman from work brought over a casserole I didn’t eat. It sat in the refrigerator until it spoiled. Throwing it away felt wasteful. Keeping it felt dishonest.

At the funeral, I stood where I was told to stand. I shook hands. I accepted condolences. Someone said she was in a better place. I wondered where that was, exactly, and whether she would find it boring.

When it was time for me to speak, I repeated what I had said before.

“She’s dead.”

There was a murmur of discomfort. Someone coughed. I stepped down.

That night, she sat beside me on the couch. The television was on, though neither of us watched it.

“You embarrassed them,” she said.

“They’ll recover.”

She smiled at that. It was a small, private smile, the kind she used to save for moments when the world disappointed her.

“You’re handling this strangely,” she added.

“I always do.”

She reached for my hand. I felt nothing. That frightened me more than her being there.

The days continued. They stacked on top of one another with bureaucratic indifference. I returned to routines out of habit rather than necessity. Coffee in the morning. Work. Dinner. Sleep. She appeared less often now, but when she did, she was sharper, more insistent.

“You’re pretending,” she accused one night.

“So are you.”

That made her laugh.

I began to wonder whether grief was something that happened to you, or something you had to agree to participate in. The world, after all, had not paused. It had barely noticed. And perhaps that was the point. Perhaps the absurdity lay not in her death, but in my expectation that it would mean something beyond itself.

What bothered me most, in those first days, were the trivialities. The refrigerator hummed too loudly at night. The hallway light flickered before settling, a delay of half a second that made no practical difference but irritated me beyond reason. I found myself standing in the kitchen at odd hours, staring at a crack in the wall we had once agreed not to fix because it gave the place “character.” I hated it now. Not because she was gone, but because it was still *there*.

Her toothbrush remained in the holder for longer than it should have. I didn’t throw it away immediately. Not out of sentimentality. I simply forgot. When I noticed it a week later, the bristles bent inward, slightly frayed. That bothered me. I replaced my own toothbrush instead. There were decisions to be made that felt disproportionate to their importance. What to do with her coats. Whether to cancel a streaming subscription she never used. Which side of the closet should become mine. These questions occupied more mental space than her absence ever did. I resented them for it. They demanded answers without offering meaning in return.

At work, I became obsessed with efficiency. Meetings irritated me more than usual. I interrupted people *mid-sentence*. I rewrote emails that were already adequate. Once, I spent nearly an hour adjusting the margins on a document no one would read closely. The symmetry mattered. I needed things to align, if only on a page.

Someone mentioned her name in passing; not hers, but someone else’s wife with the same name and I corrected them *unnecessarily*. The room went quiet. I hadn’t meant to make a point. I just couldn’t tolerate imprecision.

At night, she *returned*.

Not always visibly. Sometimes it was just her voice, pointing things out. Sometimes it was a smell; her shampoo, faint but unmistakable. Once, I woke convinced she had been crying in the bathroom. I listened for several minutes before realizing the sound was the pipes.

“You’re avoiding it,” she said, standing behind me as I stared into the mirror.

“Avoiding what?”

“Me.”

“I see you all the time.”

“That’s not the same.”

She leaned against the doorframe, watching me with the same expression she used to wear when I pretended not to hear her.

“You’re cataloguing,” she continued. “You always do that when you don’t want to feel something.”

I wanted to argue, but the truth is I had been keeping mental lists. Things that still worked. Things that *didn’t*. Things I would eventually have to replace. The car needed servicing. The kitchen sink drained slowly. The smoke detector chirped once at 3:12 a.m. and then never again. I wrote that *down*.

I found her wedding ring in the drawer where she kept spare change and receipts. That annoyed me. We had agreed it would go in the jewelry box. I picked it up, turned it over in my hand, and noticed a small scratch on the inside of the band. I didn’t remember it being there. I wondered how it happened and I wondered *when*. I didn’t cry. But I couldn’t stop thinking about the scratch.

At the grocery store, I reached for items out of habit. Her cereal. The brand of tea she preferred. I put them back; it seemed inefficient to buy food no one would eat. I stood in the aisle longer than necessary, comparing prices on identical products, irritated by the illusion of choice. A child cried somewhere behind me. The sound was vaguely *excessive*.

There were moments; brief, inconvenient moments; when the grief tried to surface properly. They arrived without warning, like nausea. A photograph. A voicemail I hadn’t *deleted*. The realization that no one else knew the particular way she took her coffee. I felt it then, sharp and immediate. And just as quickly, I shut it down by focusing on something else. The angle of the frame. The background noise. The battery percentage on my phone. This seemed *preferable* to surrendering.

I began to suspect that grief, like belief, was an act of participation. You had to lean into it. Accept its terms. Allow it to disrupt you. And I wasn’t ready to do that. I had responsibilities. A schedule. A life that, infuriatingly, continued to require my attention.

One night, she stood very close to me. Close enough that I thought I might feel her warmth.

“When are you going to look at it directly?” she asked.

“At what?”

“At the fact that I’m not coming back.”

I looked past her, at the wall, at the crack I had started to hate.

“Probably when it becomes useful,” I said.

She laughed then; not kindly.

“You always did misunderstand usefulness.”

After that, she stopped appearing so clearly. Or perhaps I stopped noticing. The difference seemed academic. The apartment grew quieter. Not emptier; quieter. As if something had been turned down rather than removed. I continued to live in it, to occupy space, to correct small errors wherever I found them. I became very good at focusing on the wrong things. And in doing so, I managed, impressively, to survive. I stopped correcting things after a while. Not consciously. It just happened. The crack in the wall remained. The flickering light continued to hesitate before coming alive. The smoke detector chirped again one night, exactly once, at the same minute as before. I didn’t write it down this time. Instead, I *waited*.

I began sleeping with the bedroom door open. This wasn’t intentional either. I told myself it was for airflow, or habit, or because closing doors felt unnecessary now. Still, I noticed I slept better when the hallway was visible. When the dark had somewhere to arrange itself.

She didn’t speak anymore, but she was present. I could tell by the way the air felt occupied. By the pressure in the room when I entered, as though something had adjusted itself to make space for me. Once, half-asleep, I apologized to the emptiness for being late. The word slipped out naturally, without thought.

“You don’t have to explain,” came the response.

I sat up so fast my vision blurred.

The room was *empty*.

I told myself that grief does this. That the mind, when deprived of ritual and release, manufactures continuity. Still, I stopped leaving lights on at night. I began to notice small changes. Objects shifted slightly from where I’d left them. Nothing dramatic. A chair angled inward. A book placed spine-down instead of up. The bathroom mirror wiped clean of the streak I’d ignored for weeks. I assumed I’d done it myself and forgotten. This explanation satisfied me more than the alternatives. One morning, I found two mugs drying on the rack and I stared at them longer than was *reasonable*. Perhaps I had washed one the night before and simply didn’t remember. Memory, after all, degrades under *stress*. Neuroscience supported this. There were studies. I drank my coffee cold, standing at the counter, refusing to sit at the table.

That night, I dreamt of her *clearly* for the first time.

She was lying in bed beside me, facing away, breathing evenly.

“Emi,” I said.

She didn’t turn around.

“You stayed,” she replied.

I woke with the word lodged in my chest.

After that, the apartment began to feel less like a place I lived in and more like a place that was *learning* me. The floorboards creaked selectively. The refrigerator hummed only when I was in the kitchen. I stopped listening to music. Silence felt more appropriate. Like courtesy. I started leaving notes for myself. Reminders. Instructions. Turn off the stove. Lock the door. Take the trash out. Sometimes, the handwriting *wasn’t mine.*

The letters were too careful. Too rounded. I told myself I was tired. One evening, as I prepared for bed, I found the bedroom door closed. I was certain I’d left it *open*.

I stood there for several seconds, hand on the knob, listening. There was no sound from inside. No movement. Just the sense; unmistakable *now* that the room was occupied.

“I don’t like it when you shut me out,” she said softly from the other side.

I did not open the *door*. Instead, I slept on the couch that *night*.

The next morning, the bed was made. Hospital corners, just the way she liked them.

I considered calling someone then. A friend. A professional. But the thought of explaining this, of translating it into symptoms and narratives, felt exhausting. Besides, nothing bad was happening. Nothing violent. Nothing I could point to and say, *this is wrong.*

She was simply *present*.

Grief, I decided, was not loud because it wanted attention. It was quiet because it intended to stay.

Weeks passed. Maybe months. Time had become unreliable. I stopped checking the calendar. The outside world felt increasingly *theoretical*. Emails piled up unanswered. I stopped going to work. No one came to check on me, or if they did, I didn’t hear them.

One night, as I lay half-awake, I felt the mattress dip beside me.

The weight was familiar.

“You don’t have to pretend anymore,” she whispered.

I didn’t ask what she meant.

“You kept waiting for it to end,” she continued. “But this is what it looks like when it doesn’t.”

I turned toward her.

She was not as I remembered.

Not wrong, just incomplete. Like a thought interrupted before it could finish forming. Her face held the suggestion of features rather than the certainty of them. Her eyes reflected light without containing it.

“I took care of things while you were gone,” I said, because it seemed important that she know.

“I know,” she replied. “You always focus on the wrong details.”

She reached for my hand.

Her touch was cold, but not unpleasant.

In the morning, I woke alone.

The apartment was silent.

On the kitchen counter lay a note I hadn’t written.

*You don’t have to keep waiting.*

I don’t leave the apartment much now. There’s no need. Everything I require is here. At night, I sometimes hear her moving through the rooms, adjusting things, fixing what I missed. I let her. It feels fair.

Occasionally, I catch my reflection in the mirror and don’t recognize it immediately. The delay doesn’t frighten me. It feels appropriate, like something is finally aligning.

Grief, I’ve learned, isn’t something you *overcome*.

It’s something that learns how to live with *you*.

And sometimes, if you let it stay long enough, it learns *how to live instead of you*.",1,1766333346.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

# ContentReel26 Review: Why Your 2025 Content Strategy Needs This Yesterday

ContentReel26 Review time. Let me cut through the noise for you.

If you're still creating videos manually—scripting, recording, editing, adding b-roll, rendering, then manually posting to 5 different platforms—you're not just behind. You're leaving stupid amounts of money, traffic, and authority on the table.

Here's the reality: In 2025, the algorithm rewards *velocity* and *volume* of valuable content. Not perfection. Not one polished video per week. I'm talking about flooding your niche with useful, content-rich videos that position you as the undisputed expert.

That's exactly what ContentReel26 does. It's an AI-powered short content-rich mass video creation platform that turns a single keyword into hundreds of authority-building videos—complete with your own AI-cloned face and voice doing the talking.

No more staring at blank screens. No more $1,500/month video agencies. No more spending 8 hours on a single 60-second TikTok.

Just enter a keyword. Pick your video count. And let the AI become your personal video production army.

# What Is ContentReel26? (And Why It's Not Just Another Video Tool)

Let me be blunt: Most AI video tools are garbage.

They slap together random stock footage with robotic text-to-speech that sounds like Stephen Hawking's first-generation voice box. They create videos that scream ""AI made me,"" which is marketing poison.

ContentReel26 is different.

This is a *mass video creation platform* built for serious marketers, coaches, agencies, and entrepreneurs who understand that **scale equals leverage**.

At its core, ContentReel26 uses advanced AI to:

* Find trending video topics around your keyword
* Write engaging, content-rich scripts for each topic
* Transform scripts into animated videos with AI-generated talking heads
* Clone YOUR face and voice with lip-sync technology
* Auto-schedule everything across social media platforms

The result? You create ContentReel26 with AI that actually looks and sounds like you spent days crafting each video.

Think of it as hiring a full video production team that works 24/7 for less than what you pay for lunch.

# What's New in ContentReel26 vs. The 2024 Legacy Version?

If you used the old ContentReel, you know it was solid. But ContentReel26? It's like comparing a bicycle to a Tesla.

Here's what they've bolted on:

# AI Scene Director

The legacy version compiled videos. This new version *directs* them. It automatically storyboards scenes, selects matching transitions, and inserts b-roll or talking-head segments where they make the most impact. It's not editing—it's *directing*.

# Smart Visual Matching 2.0

Old tools pulled random stock footage. ContentReel26 AI uses multimodal AI (think GPT-5-Vision meets Sora-style generation) to create *context-relevant visuals* that actually match your script's narrative. No more weird mismatched clips.

# AI Auto-Rephrase Tool

This is nuts. One script, multiple personalities. The AI generates different ""tone"" versions—educational, entertaining, dramatic, corporate—so you can target different audience segments without rewriting anything.

# Dynamic AI Avatars

Legacy avatars were stiff mannequins. These new AI avatars *move, gesture, and change expressions mid-sentence*. They breathe life into your content.

# AI Twin Creation

Record a 30-second selfie + voice clip. The AI clones you. Now your AI twin can star in unlimited videos without you ever touching a camera again. Perfect for YouTubers, coaches, and agencies managing multiple clients.

# AI Content Scheduler

Stop manually posting. The new scheduler auto-posts finished videos to TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, and more. Set it and forget it.

# Repurpose from URLs

Paste any blog post URL. Get 5 short videos ready in minutes. Turn your long-form content into a video content army.

# Advanced Voice Cloning

Clone your voice and use it on all videos for voiceover. The AI talking-head comes with natural head movement and perfect lipsync.

This isn't an update. It's a complete evolutionary leap.

# How ContentReel26 Works: 3 Steps to Total Niche Domination

The beauty of this ContentReel26 demo is its brutal simplicity. If you can type a keyword, you can own your market.

# Step #1: Enter, Select, Specify

* Type your main keyword (e.g., ""keto diet tips"")
* Choose how many videos to create (10? 50? 100+?)
* Select video type: Square, vertical, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Shorts, Stories, Pinterest, LinkedIn, VSL, Explainer—you name it
* Pick your length and style

That's it. 30 seconds of work.

# Step #2: AI Does Everything

ContentReel26 AI springs into action:

1. **Discovers** trending topics around your keyword using real-time data
2. **Transforms** topics into click-worthy video titles
3. **Writes** content-rich scripts for each title (actually useful information)
4. **Creates** animated videos from professionally designed templates
5. **Adds** your AI-cloned face as a talking-head with lipsync
6. **Generates** human-sounding voiceover (or uses your cloned voice)
7. **Layers** in transitions, images, video clips, background music, animations

All automatic. All in minutes.

# Step #3: Schedule & Monetize

* Review, tweak, or approve videos
* 1-click auto-schedule all videos for non-stop publishing
* Videos go live across your connected accounts automatically
* Watch traffic, leads, and authority compound daily

The system runs 24/7. While you sleep, ContentReel26 is publishing your content, building your brand, and driving your revenue.

# The Brutal Truth: Why Manual Video Creation Is Killing Your Business

Let me hit you with some harsh numbers.

The average marketer spends:

* **4-6 hours** per short video (scripting, recording, editing)
* **$300-$800** per video if outsourcing
* **15-20 hours/week** just on content creation

At 100 videos per month, you're either working 400+ hours or paying $30,000+ to freelancers.

**That's insane.**

Meanwhile, your competitor using ContentReel26 is:

* Creating 100+ videos daily (not monthly)
* Spending **zero** hours on manual editing
* Paying **one flat fee** for unlimited videos
* Flooding every platform with content-rich videos
* Building algorithmic authority while you tweak transitions

The math is simple: **Velocity wins.** The platform that publishes the most valuable content wins the niche.

ContentReel26 review conclusion? It's not a tool—it's a competitive weapon.

# Real-World Application: How I'd Use ContentReel26

Let's say I'm in the ""digital marketing tips"" niche.

**Monday Morning:** I enter ""digital marketing tips 2025"" into ContentReel26 AI. I request 50 vertical videos for TikTok and 50 square videos for Instagram.

**Monday Afternoon:** The AI delivers:

* 100 unique scripts
* 100 videos with my AI twin presenting
* My cloned voice on every video
* Perfectly matched visuals
* Branded intros/outros
* All scheduled to post twice daily for the next 50 days

**Tuesday:** I repeat the process with ""AI marketing tools.""

**Wednesday:** I paste my latest blog URL and get 5 videos promoting it.

**Result:** I'm now publishing 15-20 high-quality videos daily across platforms. My face and voice are everywhere. The algorithm sees me as the authority. Traffic compounds. Leads roll in. And I spent maybe 30 minutes total.

**That's not a fantasy. That's the ContentReel26 demo in real life.**

# The Cost of Missing Out

Let's talk opportunity cost.

Every day you wait, your competitor is:

* Publishing 50-100 more videos than you
* Building algorithmic authority you can't catch up to
* Capturing leads that could've been yours
* Establishing trust with your shared audience

In 90 days, they have 9,000 videos. You have 90.

Who wins?

The platform doesn't reward quality alone. It rewards **consistency + volume + value**. ContentReel26 gives you all three simultaneously.

# ContentReel26 Review: Pricing & Value Proposition

Here's what blows my mind: Access to ContentReel26 costs less than one outsourced video.

Typical video creation costs:

* Freelancer: $300/video
* Agency: $800/video
* In-house editor: $4,000/month salary

ContentReel26 gives you **unlimited videos** for a one-time investment that's less than a weekend in Vegas.

Let that sink in.

You're getting:

* An AI content strategist
* A scriptwriter
* A video editor
* A voice actor
* A graphic designer
* A social media manager

All in one. All automated. All working 24/7.

The ROI isn't 2x or 3x. It's **infinite** because your cost per video approaches zero.

# Addressing the Skeptics: ""But Will AI Content Hurt My Brand?""

I hear this all the time. And it's a fair question.

Here's the truth: **Bad AI content hurts your brand. Good AI content scales it.**

ContentReel26 doesn't create ""AI-looking"" junk. It creates:

* **Content-rich scripts** with actual value
* **Natural talking-head** movements
* **Your cloned voice** (so it sounds authentically you)
* **Professional templates** designed by humans
* **Platform-compliant** output

The AI handles execution. YOU control strategy, messaging, and final approval.

The result is content that's indistinguishable from manually created videos—but produced at 100x the speed.

This is the difference between using a tool and wielding a weapon.

# ContentReel26 AI vs. The Competition

Let's compare:

|Feature|ContentReel26|Other AI Tools|Manual Creation|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Videos from one keyword|100+|1-5|1|
|AI Talking Head with lipsync|✅ Yes|❌ No|❌ No|
|Voice cloning|✅ Yes|❌ Limited|❌ No|
|Auto-scheduling|✅ Yes|❌ No|❌ No|
|Mass creation|✅ Unlimited|⚠️ Limited|❌ No|
|Smart visual matching|✅ AI-generated|⚠️ Stock only|✅ Manual|
|Time per video|2 minutes|30 minutes|4-6 hours|
|Cost per video|Pennies|$10-$50|$300+|

There's no comparison. ContentReel26 operates in a different universe.

# SEO Benefits: How ContentReel26 Fuels Your Search Dominance

Every video created by ContentReel26 is SEO-optimized for its platform:

* **YouTube:** Keyword-rich titles, descriptions, tags
* **TikTok:** Trending audio and hashtag suggestions
* **Instagram:** Alt text and caption optimization
* **Facebook:** Engagement-focused formatting

But here's the real kicker: **Authority stacking.**

When you publish 100+ videos around a keyword cluster, you create a web of interconnected content that signals expertise to search engines. Google sees you covering every angle. YouTube sees you dominating a topic.

Result? Higher rankings, more suggested video placements, increased watch time, and compound traffic growth.

This is how you win the SEO game in 2025. Not with one ""perfect"" video, but with 100 good videos that collectively own the conversation.

# The Set-N-Forget System: True Automation

Most tools claim ""automation"" but still need you to babysit them.

ContentReel26's Set-n-Forget system is different:

1. **Setup:** Enter keywords, set posting schedule, connect accounts
2. **Automate:** AI creates and queues videos automatically
3. **Publish:** System posts without your involvement
4. **Optimize:** AI learns what performs and adjusts future videos

You check in weekly to review analytics. The rest runs itself.

This is what I mean by leverage. You build the machine once. It pays you forever.

# Bottom Line: ContentReel26 Review Final Verdict

Let me land this plane.

ContentReel26 isn't just another video tool. It's a **paradigm shift** in how we create and distribute content.

It solves the three biggest problems in video marketing:

1. **Speed** (what took days now takes minutes)
2. **Scale** (create 100x more content)
3. **Sustainability** (set it and forget it)

The AI talking head with voice cloning alone is worth 10x the investment. Add mass creation, smart visuals, and auto-scheduling? It's a no-brainer.

**If you're serious about dominating your niche in 2025, you have two choices:**

1. Keep doing things manually and get buried by competitors
2. Let ContentReel26 become your unfair advantage

I know which one I'm choosing.

Tobbacos are addictive because of the Nicotine and Arsenic substance (correct me if im wrong) because it conditions the brain to be reliant on that substance.  
similar with Caffeine, most that are addicted to coffee just can't even function without it and experience withdrawal of hours without having it.

in highschool i've experimented a lot of the substance and was a heavy Coffee and energy drinker. that i can go for a month straight drinking it. and just randomly quit one day. i would have an few hours of withdrawal and next i'm fine. like i haven't even had Coffee in my life. 

i know comparing drugs to Caffeine is not the same thing, but they still produce the same chemical in your brain to be addicted. i know relapse can happen when getting over an addiction and just one reintroduction to that addiction will continue the cycle. for someone that has no alcohol, tobacco, substance, or any chemical. how can you get hook on it at first time and why do you still continue it?",1,1766333210.0,NoStupidQuestions,0,1.0,False

I’ve been in no contact with my ex for about a month now (save one wellbeing text), but I’ve been thinking about my own patterns, and it made me really sad because I realised I couldn’t accept any of her safety?

She wanted to do nice things for me like bring soup when I was sick or keep my favourite snacks (which you can’t find easily where we live) stocked in her cupboards, and I nearly broke up with her, it just made me too uncomfortable! Every time we had a moment where she wanted me to be vulnerable, I’d skate over it or give her a fraction of the story. I would choose to pull back, I could feel it in the moment and would brush it off with jokes or physical affection. I’d obviously give her SOME vulnerability, but it was a level I felt safe at and didn’t really come close to matching hers. 

She was vulnerable though, she told me some really big things and she let me take care of her when she was sick, even though I know she felt the same way I did about receiving kindness. I know this isn’t WHY we broke up, but it sucks realising how much I pushed her away when I’ve spent so much of my life wishing that someone would be that nice to me. 

We broke up because she was overwhelmed by life and our relationship wasn’t helping that (we’d both admitted that we loved each other but were shit scared of how we felt prior to the breakup). I know that’s not completely on me and she has similar attachment struggles to me, but I can’t help but feel I did a crap job providing a safe space with how guarded I was being.

I was constantly on edge, and I moved us onto the next stage of the relationship too quickly because I thought I’d feel safer if we did (spoiler: it didn’t work), but I didn’t want to walk it back because I’d asked for it and I didn’t want to lose her 😭 but then it turned out that she wasn’t ready either, so I lost her anyways.

I’m going to text her when we’re both back from the holidays and give her the cliff notes of my realisation. Hopefully she’ll accept going for a coffee, I think the worst bit about this is that because we were so similar I can’t help but feel that we could really help each other if we could just learn to stay

1ps9yng,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ps9yng/every_year_on_my_birthday_i_receive_a_card_from/,"Every Year on My Birthday, I Receive a Card from Someone I Don’t Know (Part 2)","
[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/xZaoEAlsJw)

I showed the desk officer the live video.

He didn’t interrupt me. He just watched the screen, jaw clenched, hands folded on the counter like he was bracing himself.

When it ended, he asked if this was live or a recording.

I handed him my phone and told him it was live and explained the situation as quickly as I could. They dispatched units immediately to my house.

They took me into a small interview room after that. No windows. Just a table, two chairs, and a faint humming sound I couldn’t place. A detective came in not long after, older, calm, the kind of guy who speaks slowly like he’s careful not to spook you.

I told him everything.

Not just what happened that night, but everything that led up to it. Every card. Every birthday. How long it had been going on. How I never told anyone because it always felt… harmless. Strange, sure. But harmless.

He asked why I hadn’t reported it sooner.

I told him my mother did once but nothing came of it. Other than that I didn’t have a good answer.

At some point it stopped feeling like something that happened to me and started feeling like something that had always just been there. Like background noise.

I remember sitting alone in that room, trying not to imagine someone walking through my front door.

When the detective came back, he closed the door behind him before he spoke.

“They didn’t find anything.” He said. “If it weren’t for that video it would be impossible to tell if anyone was there.”

No signs of forced entry. No disturbed ground outside. No footprints around the house, even near the door where the man had been standing. The officers checked the yard, the side of the house, the area near the fence line.

Nothing.

Inside, it was the same.

No fingerprints that didn’t belong there. No signs anyone had been inside recently. No evidence of tampering with the locks. 

One of the officers mentioned how clean it all was.

That word stuck with me.

Clean.

The detective told me that without anything physical to go on, there wasn’t much they could do right now. He said they’d file a report, keep it on record, and to call immediately if anything else happened.

I asked him if he thought I was in danger.

He paused longer than I liked before answering.

He said it was good I wasn’t going back to the house.

When I left the station, it was already getting light out.

I sat in my car for a minute before starting it, just breathing, letting the adrenaline burn itself out. That was when it really hit me that if I hadn’t checked my phone when I did… if I hadn’t seen the notification…

I called my girlfriend as soon as I pulled onto the road.

I told her everything. The video. The police. I didn’t try to downplay it this time. I told her exactly how scared I was.

She started crying before I finished.

I told her to stay where she was. She’d already gone to her parents’ place after I called her the night it happened. I told her not to come back to our place, not yet. I promised I’d explain everything again later, in person, somewhere safe.

Then I told her I was going to my mom’s house.

She asked me if I wanted her to come with me.

I told her no.

I didn’t want anyone else walking into whatever this was.

After I hung up, I tried calling my mom.

No answer.

I told myself she was asleep. It was early. Too early. I called again.

Still nothing.

I sent a text asking if she was home.

No response.

I don’t know how long I drove like that, one hand on the wheel, the other gripping my phone like it might start ringing if I held it hard enough. Every red light felt too long. Every car behind me felt too close.

Somewhere between the station and my mom’s house, it occurred to me that I hadn’t told the detectives everything.

Not because I was hiding anything.

But because there were things I’d never thought to question until people started asking.

I pulled into my mom’s driveway just as the sun was coming up.

Her car was there. Lights off. Curtains drawn.

I don’t remember knocking. I just remember standing on the porch, listening, suddenly aware of how quiet everything was. No TV. No footsteps. No movement inside.

I knocked again, harder this time.

After a few seconds, the door opened just enough for her to look out at me, eyes squinting like she was trying to place me somewhere she hadn’t expected.

She said my name before I could say hers.

The relief hit me all at once.

She asked what I was doing there so early. I told her I needed to come in. I told her something happened.

She stepped aside without asking questions.

She noticed my hands shaking before I did.

We sat at the kitchen table. She poured coffee I didn’t think I would touch. I told her about the man at the door. About the deliveries. About the key.

I expected surprise.

What I got was something else.

She didn’t interrupt me. She didn’t question me. She didn’t ask for details. She just listened, eyes fixed on the table, hands folded tightly in front of her.

When I finished, she let out a long breath, like she’d been holding it in for years.

She tried to remember when the first card arrived but couldn’t so she asked me.

I told her.

She nodded slowly.

She asked me if I’d ever thought about who it could be.

I told her what people were saying. About family. About my dad.

Her head snapped up at that.

She said his name quietly, like she didn’t want it to linger.

Then she said, “You know your father died before that, right?”

I told her I knew.

But the truth was, I’d never really thought about the timing.

He died when I was young. An accident. That’s all I ever remembered it being called. Something sudden. Something tragic. Something that happened and then stopped being talked about.

She confirmed it again, gently, like she was afraid I might argue.

He wasn’t around for my birthdays after that. He wasn’t sending cards. He wasn’t watching me grow up.

Whatever this was, it wasn’t him.

She reached across the table and took my hand. Her grip was tighter than usual.

She told me she didn’t think I should go back to the house yet.

I told her the detective had said the same thing.

That made her pause.

She asked what the police had said.

I told her everything they’d found.

Or rather, everything they hadn’t.

She went quiet again after that. Not panicked. Not emotional. Just… guarded.

I asked her if there was anything she wasn’t telling me.

She looked at me for a long time before answering.

She said no.

But she also said she didn’t think this was random.

I stayed at her place for a while. Long enough for the caffeine to kick in. Long enough for the adrenaline to wear off.

Eventually, reality crept back in.

I needed clothes. My work laptop. My charger. Things I hadn’t thought to grab when I left the house in the middle of the night.

My mom offered to come with me.

I told her I’d be fine.

I don’t know why I said that.

On the drive back, I kept thinking about the way the officers described the house.

Clean.

I parked down the block instead of in the driveway.

The house looked exactly the same as I’d left it. No lights on. No movement. No sign anyone had been there at all.

For a moment, I wondered if I’d imagined the whole thing.

I walked up the path, eyes scanning the yard, the porch, the door.

The welcome mat was slightly crooked.

I know that doesn’t sound like much.

But I always kept it straight.

I knelt down to fix it.

That’s when I saw what was underneath.

I stood there for a second, hand still on the edge of the welcome mat.

The house was quiet. No cars passing. No neighbors outside.

I crouched down and straightened the mat.

It resisted slightly.

That’s when I lifted it.

There was a folded piece of paper underneath, pressed flat against the concrete. It wasn’t damp. It wasn’t curled at the edges. It hadn’t been there long enough to collect dirt or moisture.

It had been placed.

My first thought was that the police had missed it, but that didn’t make sense. They’d stood on this porch. One of them had leaned against the door while the other checked the frame. If it had been there earlier, someone would’ve seen it.

Which meant it had been put there after.

I unfolded it just enough to see my name.

My phone rang.

The sound startled me so badly I nearly dropped both the note and the phone. I didn’t check the screen. I assumed it was my mom, or my girlfriend calling to ask if I’d made it inside okay.

I answered immediately.

“Hello?”

There was nothing on the other end.

No static. No background noise. Just an open line.

For a second, I thought the call had dropped.

I pulled the phone away from my ear and looked at the screen. The call was still connected but it was an unknown number.

I raised it back to my ear.

Still nothing.

Then he spoke.

“I see you found it.”

The voice was calm. Older. Male. Not rushed. Not excited. Like he’d waited until he knew I was listening.

I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t. My mouth felt dry, like it had been stuffed with cotton.

There was a pause after that, long enough to feel deliberate.

“You shouldn’t have involved anyone else” he said.

Not angry. Not threatening. Just… corrective. The way someone talks when you’ve made a mistake they expected you to know better than to make.

“That complicates things.”

My heart was pounding hard enough that I could feel it in my throat. I asked him who he was, but the words came out weak, like I wasn’t sure I was allowed to ask.

He didn’t answer.

Instead, he said, “You won’t do that again.”

It wasn’t framed as a warning. He didn’t raise his voice. He didn’t tell me what would happen if I did.

He said it the way someone states a fact they consider settled.

There was another pause.

I waited for him to say more. For an explanation. For anything that would make this make sense.

He didn’t.

The call ended.

No click. No dial tone. Just gone.

I stood there on the porch with my phone still pressed to my ear, staring at the note in my other hand, suddenly aware of how exposed I was. How long I’d been standing there. How easy it would’ve been for someone to watch me without being seen.

I didn’t read the rest of the note.

I didn’t go inside.

I got back in my car and drove.


That was days ago.

Since then, I haven’t gone back to the house. I’ve been bouncing between hotels, sleeping with the lights on, keeping my phone on silent unless I’m expecting a call. I’ve turned off anything that tracks my location. I haven’t told anyone where I am unless I absolutely had to.

I keep replaying the call in my head.

Not what he said.

But how certain he sounded.

I went to the police because I thought that’s what you’re supposed to do when someone crosses a line.

Now I’m not sure there ever was one.

That’s why I’m writing this now.

Because whatever this is didn’t end that night.

And I don’t think it’s ever been as far in the past as I convinced myself it was.

For anyone new, every week I take Vegas lines and odds and convert them into projected fantasy points. Then I compare those projections against DraftKings and FanDuel salaries to calculate a value score. This helps highlight who's overpriced and who’s underpriced.

These plays tend to be chalky/high ownership, so I typically use them for double-ups, but you’re free to use the info however you want.

🔑 Core Plays

I run an optimizer for every slate to identify the strongest builds. Since sharing full lineups is against T&C (and would just have everyone running the same thing anyway), here are a few core plays the optimizer is high on:

* QB: Jacoby Brissett
* RB: Bijan Robinson, Jahmyr Gibbs
* WR: TBD
* TE: Harold Fannin Jr.
* DST: TBD

💸 Tip Jar (Optional)

If this saves you time and fattens your bankroll → Tip the nerd🤓🧪

* CashApp: $FirePropsEV
* Buy Me A Coffee: FirePropsEV

Backstory: I've met this girl online, we chatted a bit and moved to whatsapp. There we exchanged pics, continued chatting etc. We exchanged other social media and everything's been going great. I asked her out and she agreed and suggested the day when she's free and I agreed. We only didn't confirm the time and place.

So, what should I do? I don't know what to expect at all... I had an idea of meeting in some kind of a park or something like that, walking around for a bit and then going for a cup of coffee but maybe we should meet just outside the cafe and walk around later?

Also, I don't know how to be romantic, I'll be 'default' and talk to her like she's a friend of mine. Since it's the first time I don't think kissing would be appropriate, holding hands maybe? What about hugging when meeting and leaving? I really have no idea what to do and how to read her once I'm in that scenario so please give me some tips.",0,1766333149.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

My name is Antoine, i'm a 29yo teacher, french living in Paris. I'm also fluent in english tho.

I love chatting online, it's such a cool way to know deeply someone don't you think ? Having a text friend whom you can reach anytime just to share a thought, a meme, a joke or a bad new. 

I'm an old soul : love old musics, old books, old movies. I'm a tea and coffee addict, love to share a pic of my cup every morning (yup, i've got a collection). 

I'm a bit melancholic, writting poetry, grey sky mood.. but also a caring person, I believe.
I've got many friends but feel often lonely too, weird isn't it ?

This year, christmas is a bit of a challenge, I could use someone who go through the same stuff (non fonctionnal family, being the weird kid, the black sheep ..). Maybe we can deal this together ?

If you wanna see my face or my style, feel free to go through my Reddit profile, plenty of informations there too.

Anyway, i'm here, or Discord, or Telegram. Reach me and we'll find out if our chaotic mood and talk are a match for some online bond ! 💌🌈✍️",1,1766333071.0,textfriends,1,1.0,False

I’m selling some furniture, which is extra as I am replacing my interior of the apartment. It’s all 1 year old, not heavily used and I hope I can make someone happy with it. 

1) Carpet (Noon): in good shape, but a few awkward stains here and there, but not extremely noticeable. Easily cleanable carpet and it’s flat. Price: AED 100 (200\*300 cm)

2) Nest of tables (Noon): good shape, there are a few small scratches on the glass. Price: AED 150 (70\*70\*45/50\*50\*40 cm) 

3) Mirror (IKEA): I’ve got this one new only 3 months ago. No scratches, completely in excellent condition. Price: 100 

4) Black small coffee table (IKEA): I don’t remember the purchase price, but was around AED 100. Price: AED 50

5) 3-tier rack bathroom (Home box) also as new. Price: AED 60

6) Pots & pans (Home Box): completely new, never used it. Price: AED 120

7) Sofa: this is an oldy, and needs a good clean. However, I’d prefer to put it online to make someone perhaps happy with it. It’s quite big, and easily fits 4-5 people. Price: AED 750.

No place to leave a review,"Unlike any other product you can get online, Ballerina Farms apparently polices their reviews. Hence why only positive reviews are easily accessible - and why the AI summary on Google is astoundingly positive.

I’m honestly baffled, though. It was $60 for the bag (if you do the monthly subscription), and then around $8 for shipping. I heard on TikTok this was the best protein powder to use in coffees, so I was willing to try it (with relatively high hopes). I have tried everything to make it taste good in my morning coffee, but every time it turns out grosser than the last. Not to mention, it does not mix! And my god, you’d think it’d come with a better scooper. No matter how hard you try, you WILL get powder all over.

Now I’m stuck with an expensive bag with 26 servings to go 😵‍💫

What an overpriced, gimmicky company. LET US LEAVE REVIEWS ON YOUR WEBSITE! I’m sure no one will see this, but if you do, do NOT buy into the TikTok glorification of Ballerina Farms. Their protein powder - even one of their most popular and well-liked flavors - is gross and messy and impossible to mix. ",2,1766332915.0,ballerinafarmsnark,1,1.0,False
1ps9ud5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/comments/1ps9ud5/godslayer_epilogue_valdez/,Godslayer - Epilogue: Valdez,"The waves crashed against the shore of the island beneath a pink dawn sky. Through the window of his office, Dr. Victor Lupin watched them wax and wane gently over the beach.

Two years ago, this place had been nameless. A planet with only a hollow designation, AF-1. Back then, some other planet had owned it, but the Goddess who’d once held sway over this land had kept the Corporations away.

Now with no Goddess, it had been claimed by another corporation. Vasilios… although they had little interest in its resources. Instead, as it awaited whatever future might be found for it, it had instead become a retreat. A home for those who had survived the battle that had slain the Goddess who once held dominion over this land. A home Victor had named*Valdez*. His way of honoring an old friend.

Noah Valdez had been buried on this planet. His grave, along with the grave of Estrella Vasilios sat on a hill further inland. Victor visited it from time to time... and though he paid little mind to Estrella's grave, he often saw fresh flowers there. Sometimes, Victor saw another visiting Noah's grave, an older woman who'd taken up living on a nearby Vasilios station. Lillie Valdez seemed like a kind enough woman. Her son had her eyes. She was soft spoken and polite to Victor every time he saw her, and always accepted his invitation for coffee. The two would usually talk. Sometimes about Noah, sometimes about other things. Every time her son was brought up though, Victor could hear both the love and the pain in her voice. Pride and grief.

He understood.  


Victor's office was dim in the early hours of the morning, mostly lit by a single screen as he reviewed his incoming messages… although he could barely be said to be reading them in any meaningful way. Really he was lost in his own thoughts.

Through the window, he saw something moving over the water, a twisting shape with six skeletal wings. Violetta.

She flew freely over the ocean, no longer needing to worry about constraint. She looped wildly, flying just for the fun of it. The sight of it was always enough to bring a smile to his face, and as he watched her, he realized he was not the only one watching.

There was another figure sitting on the beach, enjoying the show Vi was putting on. Victor stared at them for a few moments before getting up and going outside to join them.

Cass looked over at him as he approached her, a gentle smile crossing her lips. He was still getting used to the change in her appearance… something she had done to distance herself from the ghost of Cassandra Vasilios. The face was still the same, but her hair was shorter, her clothes were different, more comfortable. She dug her toes into the sand, letting the waves wash over her feet.

“Morning, Victor!” She chirped.

“Cass? You’re here early.”

“I thought I’d stop by ahead of the others,” She said. “I was hoping to catch Vi’s morning flight. She’s always so majestic.”

Victor chuckled at that, looking up at the distant shadow of his daughter.

“She is, isn’t she?” He asked.

In the distance, as if she knew she was being watched, Vi let her wings skim against the surface of the water before shooting up into the sky, kicking up spray that shone with a rainbow in her wake. Cassandra’s smile widened at the display.

“Will everyone be joining us?” Victor asked.

“As far as I know, yes. Most of our friends on Pragaras arrived at the Platinum Future last night and we had a lovely time catching up with them.”

“Catching up? We’re hardly ever out of contact,” Victor teased.

“All the same. A personal reunion is nice to enjoy,” Cass scolded. She climbed to her feet and stretched. “I assume you’ll be cooking?”

“Naturally,” Victor said. “You had to ask?”

“Great, need any help?”

“Well, if you’re being so kind as to offer darling, I won’t say no.”

“Always,” Cass said.

The two watched Vi for a moment longer before going in to get started.



\*\*\*



By the time the first of the arriving ships landed, a patio by the beach had been set up. Vi and Cass were just adding the finishing touches while Victor was inside, finishing the main course.

The ship came in for a landing a short distance away, and Cass quietly abandoned her duties to go and greet the newcomers.

Luna was the first off the ship, dressed in a button down shirt and slacks that though tailored, still seemed ill fitted on her. Nevertheless, Cass greeted her with a hug.

“Luna! Welcome!”

“Hey, not like you haven’t seen me recently, robogirl,” Luna teased.

“And? I can’t be happy to see you again?”

Luna just laughed softly and hugged her back.

“You big fuckin’ sap.”

She noticed Victor stepping out of the house and he gave Luna a cheerful wave before going over to greet her as well.

“Ah! You made it safely!” He said, cheerfully. “How is Pragaras?”

“Holding up as well as it can,” Luna replied. “We’re making it work. Although I guess I’ve got her to thank for not making my life a living hell.”

She nodded over at the ship as Willow disembarked. She was dressed in a more ceremonial dress, not unlike that which Haraldsen had once worn, although the design on hers was softer.

In the wake of Haraldsen's death, the Disciples had nearly fallen apart… perhaps they would have dissolved completely if Willow had not returned in the weeks that followed. Without Allard to succeed Haraldsen, her ceremonial role had left her a strong candidate for High Priestess, a role she had been all too happy to accept.

“Getting along, are you?” Victor teased.

“Would it surprise you if I told you we were?” Willow asked, looking over at Luna. The two shared a warm smile between them.

When Willow had returned, Luna had come with her and while the former had picked up the pieces of the broken Disciples, Luna had reorganized what remained of the Annihilationists. Though every scar on Pragaras had yet to heal, the collaboration between the Disciples and the former Annihilationists had done much of the work… and with the two of them at the helm, the planet had an optimistic future.

“There are still some old resentments… but we do what we can to keep the peace,” Luna said. “I really should give Willow a lot of the credit. She’s done great.”

“I’ll take that credit,” Willow warned her, half joking.

Victor just chuckled, before looking hopefully over at the ship.

“No Freya?” He asked.

“Not with us,” Luna said. “She wasn’t able to join us on our trip to the Platinum Future, earlier. Too much work.”

“Of course…” Victor sighed, a little disappointed. “Ah well. Come, we have wine!”

“The highlight of the trip,” Willow said, clasping her hands together. “Honestly I’ll never forgive you for freezing me before you let me at your liquor cabinet.”

“You were dying, darling. Alcohol wasn’t on my mind at the time.”

“Well I was certainly *dying* for a drink,” Willow smirked.

“Alright, call Savannah. We’re poisoning her again…” Luna said. Both of them laughed.

From the corner of his eye, Victor noticed a second ship coming in for a landing. This one was a simple recon ship, the name Conquest III was creatively emblazoned on its side. Cassandra saw it too.

A smile crossed Willow's lips, and she trailed behind Victor and Cassandra as they went to greet the newcomers, while Vi and Luna mingled near the patio.

The ship came in for a landing beside Luna and Willow’s ship. As the engine died, the ramp extended. Cedar and Mason descended together. Mason still walked with a slight limp, and leaned on a cane to help him get around. Though healed, his once severed leg still ached on most days.

Willow wasted no time in greeting her twin sister, approaching her with open arms. Cedar hugged her tight the moment she saw her.

Cass on the other hand charged directly at her brother and damn near tackled him to the ground.

“Hey, hey, hey!” Mason said, chuckling.”Relax! You saw me last night!”

“Barely! Your wife was the one doing all the entertaining. You were working before and after dinner! I'm amazed you're finally out of your office!” Cass said.

“I’m busy!” Mason protested.

“Not right now you’re not! Come on, Vi and I mixed some really good drinks!”

She took him by the hand to lead him away. Victor just laughed to himself and gave Mason a friendly wave. He barely had time to reciprocate.

As Cedar and Willow left the ship, Savannah started down the ramp behind them. Victor gave her a nod as she joined them. She still babied her burnt arm a little bit, holding it closer to her body. He noticed that the arm in general seemed a bit thinner, but otherwise she had a more vibrant pallor to her cheeks.

“Victor,” Savannah said warmly. “I haven’t seen you since last months board meeting. Always a pleasure.”

“Likewise,” he replied. “You’re looking well.”

“You too. Keeping busy, I trust?”

“Wouldn’t dream of it, darling.”

Savannah chuckled.

“No, I suppose not…”

“What’s this I hear about you visiting the other members of the board?” Victor asked coyly as they walked towards the patio together. “Am I not worth checking in on?”

“No,” Savannah said bluntly. “You haven’t brought up any real argument against the Chairman’s new direction for Vasilios. I don’t have any need to visit you.”

“Savannah! How could you say that to me!” Victor said, feigning a scandalized voice. “I’ll have you know I harbor many contrarian opinions that differ radically from the Chairman's!""

“Are they about wine pairings?” Savannah asked.

“Most of them, yes. By all means, stop by more often. I’d love to corrupt you into my way of thinking.”

“A tempting offer but alcohol doesn’t agree with me,” Savannah said. “Although I suppose I could be swayed by what the wine is meant to pair with…”

“Say no more, darling. Any excuse for a good meal is all I need,” Victor said. “Ah, but I have heard some complaints from other members of the board. Out of respect to my new colleagues, I do have to ask you be a little less… intimidating when discussing the Chairman with them.”

Savannah looked over at him, an eyebrow raised.

“Why are they complaining? I haven’t harmed anyone.”

“Yes my dear, but consider the fact that you’re fucking terrifying.”

She rolled her eyes.

“Very well. I’ll try to be less... intense.” She forced a smile for Victor. It was the single most horrifying expression he’d ever seen. It was adorable.  
Cassandra had dragged Mason to the patio and was sitting beside him, all but forcing the hors d'oeuvres she and Victor had prepared that morning down the poor mans throat. Still, he hardly seemed to be suffering. Cedar seemed to be in no hurry to save him. She and Willow sat nearby, engaged in a conversation over wine. They all looked happy.

Mason had not wanted the position of Chairman… but when it had fallen to him, Victor was a little surprised at how well he had ultimately handled it. Under Mason’s control, Vasilios had begun to restructure itself, focusing more on building out the planets it controlled into more functional independent colonies. The process would likely take decades… maybe even centuries. But Mason had hoped it might trigger a greater shift. Time would tell if he was right or not.

Fittingly, Pragaras was the earliest model for an independent colony, and Mason seemed to be eying their success as a template for others, although they were not the only ones he’d been trying to work with. With Cass’s help, he had created more of a relationship with several Android communities as well, and now that word had begun to spread of the Vasilios Corporations changing priorities, a few other independent colonies had come to them for protection. The arrangements were imperfect and still in their infancy, but in time they might yield fruit.

The board had not been unanimously on board with such an ambitious change in direction… but unfortunately for them, Savannah Wagner remained as loyal as ever to the Vasilios family and the Chairman's wife still owned a flaming ceremonial sword. Between the two of them they tended to quash any dissent. Was it ethical? Absolutely not. But when had ethics ever been a consideration for the board?

As the others socialized, Victor glanced down at his Tac Band. He saw no notifications on it. Perhaps he should be the one to reach out to Freya? She should have been on the ship with Luna and Willow.

He typed up a message, but never got to send it. From the corner of his eye, he saw one last ship coming in for a landing. Luna looked over as it approached, and with a knowing smile she rose to her feet. Together, she and Victor approached the final ship as it descended from the atmosphere and set itself down on the beach.

As the ramp lowered, both of them waited.

A drone unplugged itself from the ship, and hovered down towards Victor and Luna.

“*Well, well, well. Salutations motherfuckers.”* Tetra said.

The chassis of her current body was shiny and new. No doubt custom, courtesy of Freya. It was telling that she’d chosen to appear in that body as opposed to using the version of her on any of the other two ships. As always, Tetra was everywhere.

“Good to see you as always, Tetra,” Victor said warmly.

“*Damn right it is!”*

The drone looked back as Freya descended the ramp.

“You’re late,” Victor said.

“I was busy!” Freya protested. “We were having some filtration issues with the main pump in Vespula. Somebody had to fix it.”

“Don’t you have apprentices for that?” Luna asked.

“Yes, but I wanted it done right,” Freya said. “It was just a few hours. Not a big deal.”

Victor studied her for a few moments.

“Did you sleep?” He asked.

“Of course she didn’t sleep, this is Freya,” Luna said.

“I slept on the ship! We were in Superluminal for six hours. That’s lots of sleep!” Freya said.

“*She spent four of those hours working on blueprints for a second water pump,”* Tetra said.

Victor rolled his eyes.

“What? Vespula’s getting bigger! We don’t need a water shortage.”

“Fucks sake, you’re worse than Mason…” Luna said, shaking her head. “I saw coffee up on the patio. Probably the good shit. You want a cup?”

“Yes please,” Freya said, a little sheepishly.

Luna clapped her on the shoulder and went to pour her a cup.

“You my dear, need to learn what a work-life balance is.” Victor said as he led Freya to the patio.

“I like my work,” Freya argued. “It’s… nice, to be part of a community like that. Pragaras is looking nicer too. We’ve got a garden now. It’s really something.”

“I had heard. I’ll need to visit soon,” Victor said. “But*you*need to stop overworking yourself. It’s not healthy.”

Freya rolled her eyes, but gave a soft, almost sheepish smile.

As they made it to the patio, Luna brought her some coffee and gestured to a seat beside her. Freya sat down.

With all of his guests present, Victor gestured to Vi to come with him. She bounded after him, a smile on her face as they retreated to the house for the main course.

I’ve been dabbling in a few hobbies, but feel like I can’t figure out fun and creative things to do long term. 

I’ve tried embroidery and plan to keep that going. I like bingeing TV and anime but I feel lazy after a while. I have access to a lot of nature - but we’re getting into winter and that’s not always practical. I enjoy reading but don’t have any idea of what to read next and feel a bit burnt out. I like crafts, coffee, cleaning, working out, my cats, and diy. (but I’ve been lazy). 

Really enjoy birding but I have no idea how to make that a hobby- right now I just like to watch the birds that visit my bird feeder. 

I want to enjoy cooking or baking as a hobby but truth be told, my mindset ruins it. I’m pretty bad at cooking and get overwhelmed by too many steps at once. Im open to fixing this but need advice on how to go about it. 

What should I do? Where do I start? What do you all do?

“Huh?” I said, taking another drag.

Stanley smiled, “What if you went in there and killed them?”

“I mean,” I laughed, “I don’t know.”

We had stopped on a street a few blocks from the bar. Stanley said he needed a little break to smoke and recuperate himself. I told him that we’d hardly walked. He said he’d gotten fat after Thanksgiving and now Christmas. I leaned on the waist-high fence around the perimeter of a house and accepted a cigarette from him.

“No, no,” he said, “I mean it.”

“Mean what?”

“Kill them,” he nodded his head towards the front door of the house.

“But why?”

“Think about it,” he said. “A family all sleeping soundly in bed. A strange man walks in with a baseball bat. Starts knocking their heads in. It’d be fun.”

“Where would we even get a baseball bat?” I grinned.

“Oh, right here.”

He pulled out from behind his legs a bat and offered it to me. The streetlight glimmered off the round end of its batting side, causing me to squint for a moment. It was made of metal.

“I don’t know dude,” I said.

“Go on,” he said. “You know you want to.”

I took the bat. The metal weighed heavy in my hands. I looked it up and down. Stanley’s eyes bored into me. I moved the bat between my hands, playing for time before he’d continue with his proposition.

He took a long drag from his cigarette, “Look. The door’s already open for you.”

I looked to the house. The front door stood wide open. I took a step towards it, before retreating back.

“I can’t.”

“Why not?”

“I…”

My mind faltered. I couldn’t call to mind a reason I shouldn’t. All morality and personal accountability had managed to slip away and, for a moment, I could only conjure up the reasons I should.

“I don’t know.”

“Then do it.”

I looked back towards the door. Beyond it was an emptiness. I felt if I stepped foot into there I’d fall through it and never be able to return. Like swimming in space.

“I guess,” I said, taking a step forward.

“Yes,” Stanley said, “Walk through the door. Then up the stairs.”

I found myself standing on the top bannister. The place looked cozy. Pictures hung from the walls showing a family at various holiday destinations. Paris, London, Bangkok. I could trace the ageing of the youngest through childhood and into their teen years. I saw the braces they had put on and subsequently taken off. I saw the eldest man’s wrinkles form and hairline recede. The woman’s hair turning grey and then dark again.

A door slowly opened at the end of the hall. I didn’t feel alarmed. I could hear Stanley explain.

“Go there,” he said.

I entered the room. A bed sat at the other end. The streetlight filtered through the window and I could barely make out the figures. Their chests rose and fell with each breath. They seemed unperturbed by my presence.

“Approach them,” Stanley said, “and ready the bat.”

So I did. I stood over them, bat lifted over my shoulder. I could make out the faces of the figures in the bed looked exactly like the adults in the pictures.

“Strike them,” he said.

So I did.

His head popped like a balloon filled with water. The blood gushed onto the sheets. The other woke up and turned over. Too shocked to scream.

“Her too.”

When the job was done, I dropped the bat onto the floor. It made a clunk as it hit the hard wood. I wanted to feel disturbed in that moment, yet I felt at peace. I stared at their bodies. I could no longer tell if their faces fit the ones in the pictures.

“Come down.”

At the bottom of the stairs I found Stanley sitting on the sofa in the family’s living room. He patted the seat next to him. I sat.

“Too bad...”

“The leather’s ruined,” I finished.

“Exactly my thought.”

“Why did we do this?”

“We?” Stanley laughed. A wry, humourless laugh, “I didn’t do anything.”

Then it hit. The disturbed feeling. The feeling I had done something wrong. I dug my fingernails into the skin of my palm. I wanted it gone. I wanted the blood out of me.

My bedsheets were covered in sweat when I woke up. Thank god, I thought, thank god it wasn’t real. I pulled myself up and walked over to the mirror. Thankfully, I found no blood on my clothing. No fingernail scars on my palm. My hands were clean.

I arrived a few minutes late for work.

“Ah,” Stanley said as I entered the office, “what time do you call this?”

“I’m sorry dude,” I said. “Just had a bit of…”

“I’m fucking with you,” Stanley said. “What are you thinking about tonight?”

“We could just go to the old bar again. It’s a safe bet.”

“Hm, safe yeah, but it’s not fun is it? What if we hit that new place a few blocks over. Sandy’s, is it?”

“I guess, but I’d...”

“Great! I’ll meet you there at seven.”

He winked and walked off with his mug of coffee in hand.

I sat at my desk and turned on my monitor. For the next few hours I mindlessly scrolled before continuing with the project I’d started a few days before. Stanley handed it to me. Said I am the only person he trusts with such a task. We’d started at that company the same day. Both juniors. Now I had managed a middleweight position and Stanley made project lead.

Work finished at 5 but we clocked out 20 minutes earlier.

“Let it be our little secret,” Stanley would say every day.

There was a familiarity to the bar. It turned out we’d been there before. When it was known as The Copper instead of Sandy’s. Except the owners weren’t the only things that had been exchanged. The little sofas in the corner had been replaced by wooden stools and tables. The pool table in the corner ripped out to make room for more sitting space. A side of the room cleared for live music.

“The usual?” Stanley asked.

I nodded.

He ordered me a cider and himself a vodka and coke. I claimed a table near the window. I enjoyed watching people pass in the streets.

“We’ve been here before,” I said.

“No we haven’t,” Stanley said. “It’s new.”

“The branding and the design is. But the bar is the same. Pretty sure that’s the same bartender the last time we came too.”

He looked into his glass for a moment, thinking.

“I would remember a place like this,” he said.

“Not if you drunk too much.”

He laughed, “Good point.”

The night moved on. People walked in and out. I kept an eye to the door and an ear to my friend, watching the crowd as they shuffled through. Eventually, through some slip in the conversation, we ended up at my dating life.

“What about the girl by the bar,” Stanley said, conspicuously turned around on his seat to stare.

“No,” I said, “we’re not doing this tonight.”

“Come on dude,” he turned back, “you’ve got to get yourself out there. We’re almost 30.”

“You’re 32,” I said, “and I’m a year younger.”

“Really?”

I nodded.

“Anyway, this girl. She looks like your type. You should really give it a chance.”

“She’s like 19, Stan.”

He shrugged, “Never stopped me.”

I sighed, “What does stop you.”

“Oh you know I’m all tied up now.”

“Never stopped you before.”

“Yeah well, I love this girl. Truly. More than I’ve ever loved anyone before. I love her so much she’s the only girl I’ve never cheated on. That’s the truth.”

I giggled, “Yeah well, cheers to that.”

I took leave to visit the toilet. Stanley said he’d grab us another round. By the time I got back, he’d yet to return from the bar. I found him still there, chatting up the girl he pointed out earlier. I sighed and sat back down at our table. Sipping the little drink I had left in my glass, I looked out again to the people passing through.

“Mind if I sit here a moment?” said a young man standing over the table.

“Um, sure,” I said.

He shuffled into the bench and leaned on the table. He looked up to me and smiled. If you asked Stanley the first thing he noticed in a person he was attracted to, he’d tell you it was the butt or the breasts. His preferences oscillated each time we went out. But the first thing I notice is the face. The man before me had a dimple under his lips that accentuated his smile. His green eyes that looked into me and, with ease, sought through.

“I’ve been watching you,” he said. “And your friend. Been waiting for a chance to come over.”

“Okay.”

“I know you’ve been watching me too.”

“I guess.”

“I’ll make this short before he gets back,” he said, placing a small piece of paper on the table and sliding it over to me. “Call me.”

He winked, stood up and walked off.

I took the paper and slid it into my jacket pocket. Stanley reappeared a moment later holding two pint glasses filled to the brim.

“Who was that?” he said.

“That...was Jane’s nephew,” I said.

“Isn’t he off in college?”

“Guess he’s back for the holidays.”

Stanley shrugged.

I woke up the next morning quite hungover and remembering little of the rest of the night. I let out a sigh of relief to not find the man laying in the bed next to me, although a tinge of regret would soon rear its head. I nursed my hangover for a few hours. First laying in bed then reheating some leftover food and devouring a pot of coffee. Eventually, I knew I had to return to the bar to retrieve my car.

Deciding to save on some money and get some fresh air on a clear day, I walked. It would have only taken 20 minutes after all. I passed by the residential streets leading out from my apartment. Each house almost identical in its design. Uniform houses for uniform families.

I found myself caught out of breath halfway down a street. A weakness crept over me and I felt as though I’d pass out. I managed to catch my hand on the waist-high fences of one of the houses. A sharp pain spread throughout the palm of my hand. I snatched it away. A sharp and rather large splinter penetrated the skin. A small stream of blood flowed down to my fingers.

The fence looked otherwise clean and well sanded. How such a splinter managed its way into my palm I don’t know. I looked up to the house. The exterior looked familiar—and not in the way of the rest of the houses on every street. All the blinds in the window were closed and the drive lacked a car. However, the front door stood open. A dark emptiness beyond its border.

I remembered. The metal baseball bat I had been given; the door that stood open; the family pictures hung on the wall; the peaceful faces that slept; the sound of a skull being cracked; the sofa ruined by blood; my hands are unclean.

I pressed my finger down to stop the trickling blood.

“I didn’t do anything,” I said to the house.

I appreciate the kindness on my last post. Posting about my guests is one thing, but sharing about myself feels like exposure. I hope, if anything, you all understand now that I am not exposing another’s pain just to do so; I have been where many of them are. 

After I hit “post” I quite immediately turned off my computer and let Charles hold my hand. We have done this since the first morning he stayed here - it’s how we keep each other grounded. It’s how he tells me he’s doing what he can, and it’s how I tell him I see his humanity. 

I wallowed for a bit. I spent time in my pain. Normally I’d go out in the garden and bury my feelings with the plants in the dirt, but the ground is frozen. It is, indeed, December in Maine. I considered baking or cooking, I considered eating my feelings - but that will only delay or transfer my pain. 

So, I wallowed. 

Regardless of how deep one might wish to bathe in their misery, life goes on. In my case, that means that The Cottage is still open. When The Cottage is open, that means I will host guests.

This is that guest’s story.

—

December 18th, 2025

I was in bed. It wasn’t very late at night and I wasn’t very tired, but I was in bed. 

I was scrolling on my phone in that mindless way that we do in this modern era, taking in all the information and also none of it, trying to escape the images and memories in my mind. Charlie had left me hours ago - at my request - all of the variants of his face riddled with concern and care and something I did not want to label. 

Something a bit too close to pity. 

The headlights made me groan. Of all times to get an arrival, of course it would be when I was unprepared, both physically and emotionally. Still, I pulled on my blazer and straightened my hair and made sure my breath wasn’t offensive and readied myself to greet the newcomer.

The person I saw on the other side of the door was not who I was expecting. They rarely are, to be entirely fair to the work, but this young woman could barely be called that.

This young woman was barely this side of girlhood, with baby fat still clinging to her jawline and the glow of teenagedom still warming her cheeks. Her brown eyes were red from crying and her chin still trembled, but she kept herself steady and maintained eye contact with me.

Her dense black hair was pulled into a bun that sagged low on the back of her head, and it bobbed slightly when she asked, in a voice that just barely wobbled, “Any vacancy?”

I nodded and guided her to my desk while trying to measure her, while trying and failing to get some inkling of what new variation of pain and choice I was about to bear witness too. “Fifty bucks a night. I don’t hold for incidentals. If you stay an extra night, we do this again tomorrow. Breakfast is at 8am.” 

Breakfast is not mandatory, I wanted to add. I wanted to opt out myself, to not have to think about cooking and carrying someone else’s burden. 

Except breakfast was mandatory. The Cottage made sure it was. 

She handed me her ID and card silently, not meeting my eyes. I frowned slightly and read her name - Julia M. She had turned eighteen three months ago. I assessed her, trying to see if I could find any signs of abuse or assault, and found none. I would not get anymore clues until I dreamed. 

I fought against sleep. I wanted to stay up and feel my misery a little longer, I wanted to be my own center of attention for just a few more minutes. It was a losing battle. The fight was against The Cottage, too, and The Cottage always won. 

I dreamed of Julia, of the poverty she came from, of single-wide trailers and cigarette smoke and alcoholism in her single mother. I dreamed of a father who only showed up to fight against paying child support until he stopped showing up altogether. I dreamed of pancakes with butter and nothing else.

I dreamed of Julia raising her four-year-old sister because her mom was still searching for a future at the bottom of a bottle of vodka. I dreamed of visits from Child Protective Services where Julia cleaned until her fingers bled and hid all the bottles and excused every sign of neglect they worried about. I dreamed about her sister being placed somewhere else, in a home with the child’s paternal grandparents where Julia was not welcome. 

I dreamed of Julia’s impeccable grades, of her innate genius at math. I dreamed of early graduation from high school. I dreamed of scholarships awarded for more money than she had ever even thought about, of acceptances to schools that were fighting for her. I dreamed of a future filled with opportunities she couldn’t imagine. 

I dreamed of acceptances to MIT and UCLA. I dreamed of acceptances to Harvard and Princeton and Stanford. I dreamed of the shock from Julia’s counselors, of those middle-aged education workers who had never seen a student get accepted to one Ivy League, let alone multiple. 

I dreamed of full ride scholarships. I dreamed of a future outside of single-wide trailers and vodka bottles and secondhand smoke. 

I dreamed of intense internal conflict. I dreamed of Julia trying to connect with her baby sister. I dreamed of a maternal force of nature.

I woke up feeling only sorrow for the young woman in my first suite. I made her pancakes, I set out sides I knew she wouldn’t eat and coffee she probably wouldn’t drink and I waited as I always did. 

She didn’t come downstairs until quarter past eight, and she didn’t have her bags with her like I’d expected. Most of my guests try to leave before breakfast. Most try to never come back. 

“I made you pancakes,” I offered gently. Julia took in the spread and sat down in the wooden dining chair across from me, the weight of her sounding heavier than she could possibly be. 

Julia shoveled the pancakes down like she hadn’t eaten in weeks, all while I picked at my breakfast, trying to decide if I should speak first or wait for her. When her plate emptied, I refilled it, and I finally decided that I would speak. 

“I’ve never had a future Harvard student as a guest.” She paused mid bite and stared at me, her dark eyes wide with shock. Maybe with a bit of anger, or pain, too. “MIT is probably a better school for math, but you’re right to prefer post-undergrad there, I think. What do I know, though, I only went to the University of Iowa.” 

The shock stayed on her face, but her expression relaxed, melting into one that seemed more resigned. Julia put her fork down. “It’s not far,” she said quietly, her voice wobbling a touch as it had the night before. “Six hours. An easy bus trip from Bangor. I could come visit often. But Olivia…” 

She stared out the window behind me, the one that looked into the wintery garden. “She’s basically mine. I was only fourteen when she was born, but I raised her. I accidentally called her my baby instead of my baby sister before she was six months old. She only got taken because I couldn’t bring her to doctors appointments alone, and when I tried… mandatory reports.” 

Julia sighed. “I kept them at bay for three years. Made sure my mother was just sober enough, that the house was clean. All that time I was only thinking about her. So was CPS, even though I was a kid, too. I was looking at apartments when her grandparents showed up.” 

Her face shifted to a scowl. “They’re rich. They live in Bar Harbor near the water and can give her everything I can’t. They’ve let me visit twice but think that I’m a bad influence. I was accepted to fucking Harvard, for gods sake. I’m a god damn genius. And a bad influence.” 

She took the angriest bite of pancakes I’d ever seen and I took that as my turn to speak. “Why not just leave? Blossom, and then fight for her when you are more settled?” 

“It will be too late then,” she snapped, then frowned apologetically. “Sorry. If she grows up, if she remembers that I could have fought harder and didn’t, if she becomes established in a school system with family… what chance would I have? I’d be taking a little girl away from stability for my own gain. At the same time, she is my baby. I changed her diapers. I took pictures at every milestone. I made sure she was clean and fed. I missed school when she was sick. How could I leave her behind?” 

She was crying now, tears falling freely down her cheeks and spilling off her jaw onto her shirt. “If I leave, if I go to an Ivy League school and then a prestigious post graduate program and then whatever takes me beyond, how could I forgive myself for not fighting harder for her?” 

My heart did a flip in my chest as I realized the weight of her choice. It was not about her sister’s future, or about life and death, or about good and evil. 

It was about if she could forgive herself later. I couldn’t answer that for her, even though I knew the choice she would make. She knew the choice she would make, too, or else she wouldn’t be crying at my dining room table. 

“Stay another night,” I offered, my voice kind. I had made a choice, too, one that I didn’t expect to be making. “On the house. Today, we can make a plan for whatever you decide.” 

——

I probably don’t have to tell you, but she chose her own future. She chose to nurture her own genius to offer a better life for herself.

I helped her write a letter to her little sister, one that explained why she made the choice she made and that she was always going to be there when she needed to be. I wrote Julia one of my own, promising to house her on vacations, promising to help her fight to see Olivia when she came home, and promising to help her with whatever she needed in between. 

Julia is still here, and will be until the spring semester starts. She is sleeping off years of hypervigilance and neglect. I’m going to pay for her to go to the dentist and the doctor before she leaves for school in the spring, because MaineCare really never gave her a chance. 

I am still grieving for my daughter. I will be grieving for her for as long as I live and then possibly beyond because she was made from my flesh and blood and she was taken from me in front of my very eyes. 

But Julia never had a mom. She probably would never have had a chance, except she is exceptionally gifted and exceptionally passionate. Her future is blooming in front of her in ways that she doesn’t even know yet, and she needs a loving hand at her back. 

I am realizing that as I progress in my ownership of The Cottage, I am collecting a village. Julia is a normal teenage girl who needs someone to love her with maternal fierceness. Charlie is an extramortal creature who needs someone to ground him to humanity. 

I am a lost soul looking for peace in a world that has already stolen it from me, but I’m finding bits of it. Shreds. Fragments. So, I’ve decided to keep searching. I’ve decided that if I must, I will become a mosaic of love and kindness and peace and hope. 

Maybe that’s why The Cottage chose me. ",4,1766332679.0,nosleep,1,0.83,False
1ps9qme,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBookandtheSword/comments/1ps9qme/the_baptism_i_forced_vs_the_grace_i_couldnt/,The Baptism I Forced vs. the Grace I Couldn’t,"Brothers and sisters (if any still wander in here),

Seven or eight years ago a strange thought lodged in my head: I’d be dead at 46. Probably started as some flippant remark I blurted out—I've got form for saying random things that oddly come to pass—so I took it half-seriously. A couple of years later I started attending a little Baptist church after years away. The “prophecy” was still rattling around in my head, but now I ""cleverly"" reframed it: not physical death, but a spiritual one—dying to self, born again. Perfect timing, I thought.

I pushed hard for baptism. Convinced the pastor (Raish, a good man with real discernment) that this was my moment. Told him about the vision, the urgency. A month before my 46th birthday, he baptised me.

Two weeks later I fled the church I’d actually grown fond of. Alcohol, lust, gluttony, the whole world rushed back in. I never fully rejected Christ—couldn’t—but I was in a dark, wretched place. Over and over I begged God: “Where’s the Holy Spirit? Where’s the peace believers talk about? I’ve done my bit—believed, repented, got baptised. I met You halfway. Why no reward?”

I was bargaining with God, convinced salvation was a deal: I bring sincerity, effort, baptism; He brings the rest. I thought I’d ticked every box, yet still felt dead inside. Frustration turned to depression, uncertainty, despair. “What more can I possibly do? I’ve tried everything to help myself into salvation.”

That carried on until I hit 50. On the day of my 50th birthday I felt compelled to “do something for Truth.” Built a little app called The Truth Engine, started posting again in Christian subs—rambling, wrestling, chasing. And only weeks ago the penny finally dropped: predestination. Unconditional election. Grace alone.

All my life I’d believed I had to bring something to the table—be good enough, pray hard enough, feel sincere enough. My baptism at 46 was peak flesh-effort: forcing regeneration on my timetable, trying to kick-start the new birth by dunking myself at the “prophetic” age.

It failed spectacularly, because no man can force it. No man can come to Me unless the Father draws him.

He waited. Let me exhaust every flesh-trick. Then, in His time, He called me. Replaced the stone with flesh. Gave repentance and faith as pure gift. No cooperation, no synergy—just sovereign mercy.

Today, funnily enough, I went back to that same church in simple obedience. Raish (the very pastor who baptised me back then) walked over to me after the service. He told me quietly he’d never felt comfortable with that baptism—his discernment flagged something disingenuous, like I was almost forcing it. He was right.

But today he looked me in the eye and rejoiced: he sees the living reality of Ephesians 2:8-9 in me now. Real peace. Real fruit. We’ve set up coffee after Christmas for deeper fellowship, and I look forward to it. 

The difference? Back then I was trying to manufacture regeneration. Today I know I contributed exactly nothing. He did it all, when He decided the time was right.

So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy. (Romans 9:16)

If you’re still striving, bargaining, wondering what more you can do to “help God save you”—stop. You can’t force the Call any more than I could.

I was one of them. ""Clothes don't make the man,"" right?

Here's what I missed:  **Dressing well is a form of self-respect.**

For the longest time, I treated my appearance as an **afterthought**. I'd workout for an hour but then throw on whatever was cleanish.

The disconnect was huge.

I was putting in effort to **build** a better body/mind, but I was wrapping it up in apathy.

One day, I was getting ready for a coffee meeting and caught myself in the mirror. Lean-built shoulders, but wearing a faded graphic tee from college and jeans with holes in the knees. Not intentionally distressed, just old.

So I thought, ""If I saw someone else like this, would I think they had their shit together?""

The answer was **no**.

So I started dressing with the same intentionality I brought to the gym.

Nothing very fancy.

Just... deliberate.

Well-fitted basics.

Clean shoes.

Clothes that looked like I picked them on purpose.

The difference in how I carried myself was immediate. Not just because other people noticed, but because I was finally treating the outside with the same respect I was giving the inside.

This also sounds silly, but it trains your brain to associate focus with pleasure.

**4. Change locations once a day**  
Studying in the same spot drains you, I rotate between my desk, a cafe, or my bed (controversial, I know). If you can’t leave home, just change the lighting or background music. it tricks your brain into a fresh start.

That was actually **terrifying** for me. When you're in that **awkward** learning phase, you have to try things that might look stupid on you.Standing in a shop like Zara, trying on clothes that might look weird on you... it just makes my stomach drop.

For a long time, I hadn't really paid much attention to my style, even though I knew how important it was for first impressions, and signaling to people how I expected to be treated, and most importantly the **confidence boost**.



So what I used to do was go to Reddit, Instagram, and Pinterest and just save clothes and outfits. But after a while, when I went back and looked at them, I didn't really see myself in those clothes. They looked weird. I also felt like people would look at me weirdly if I wore them.

And being quite a shy guy and introvert like me, I thought for a while and realized that the main issue was finding a safe space. A **safe space** to experiment, a safe space to fail, a safe space to find my style, even if it I had to look bad 100 times to get it **right once**.

So after a bit of pondering, I started doing something kinda weird.

I'd take outfits (semi casual to formal) outfits I had previously saved, and use Google's nano banana to see how it would look on me. Then I'd save those pictures and relook at them after a day or two. If it wasn't looking too bad then or if I thought ""yh, I could pull that off"", I'd take note of it.

Then I'd go online or go shopping and find very similar clothes alone.

The next week, I'd wear it out to a coffee shop, and when I get more used to it, I'd start taking it to work or around people I usually hang out with.

# Passwordless authentication built on Nostr

Nostr Authentificator is a modern authentication system that replaces traditional accounts and passwords with **cryptographic identity**. It allows users to authenticate using their Nostr public key while keeping full control over their private keys at all times.



# How it works

Authentication with Nostr Authentificator is based on a simple and secure flow. A user provides their Nostr public key, receives a unique challenge, and signs it using a trusted Nostr client or browser extension. The system verifies the signature cryptographically and grants access without storing passwords, emails, or personal data.

Authentication can be completed either **directly from a Nostr extension** or **through a secure chat-based flow**, offering flexibility without compromising security.



# Why it’s useful

Nostr Authentificator removes the complexity and risks associated with traditional authentication systems. Users benefit from fast, seamless access without managing credentials, while developers avoid the burden of storing sensitive data.

It is especially useful for protecting admin panels, internal tools, dashboards, and private applications where strong access control is essential.



# Security and privacy

Security is built into the core of Nostr Authentificator. Private keys never leave the user’s device, and each authentication request uses a one-time, time-limited challenge. This design eliminates common attack vectors such as phishing, password reuse, and credential leaks.

No tracking, profiling, or centralized identity storage is involved. Authentication is based solely on proof of key ownership.



# Built for developers

Nostr Authentificator can be easily integrated as an external authentication layer. Through the developer interface, teams can configure Nostr-based authentication, manage access rules, and secure applications with minimal setup.

The system supports both hosted and self-managed deployments, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases.



# A user-owned identity model

At its core, Nostr Authentificator follows a simple principle: **identity belongs to the user**. By building on open standards and decentralized cryptography, it enables secure access without lock-in, surveillance, or unnecessary data collection.

1ps9ht7,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1ps9ht7/i_think_i_am_being_manipulated_by_coworker_crush/,I think I am being manipulated by coworker crush :(,"Hi! I am 25 and I caught feelings for my coworker (I know, doesn’t sound great). Context: So I have Asperger’s and I am not really good with social interaction. For years I didn’t have any romantic experience. I had my first love at 15-16 years old (nightmare bff situationship, scarred me for years). Then, I had a big crush on my straight friend and it ended up being a big mess too. 

I had multiple dates and crushes but I never had anyone hit on me, kiss me, hold my hand and I didn’t try to do it too. I was just really scared of being hurt and my dates always had distractions of their own (one girl went back to her partner, another one wanted to have her ex in her life). Of course, I had dates without that kind of problems but I didn’t really liked them (and knew them) enough to not run away from intimacy.

So, I finally found the type of therapy that works for me half of the year ago. It really transformed me as a person and my life truly got better. Also, half of the year ago I met A. We work in food industry and sometimes (like 3-4 times a month) she was on shift with me. We kinda clicked, I am very shy and reserved with crushes but really straightforward with people I want to try to be friends with. So I was straightforward I liked her as a friend (I followed her on her socials back, we had friendly work interactions).

And it changed a week ago. All of this time she was commenting on my socials, texting me first, texting me out of work. But in a week and a half  we had five shifts together and I felt like she really liked me. She was making eye contact, like a lot, touching me with her hands, gently shoving me with her body. She was bringing me coffee (with “my favourite colleague” written on it) and sweets. She was always nice. I folded and invited her on a date to a restaurant to eat and drink alcohol. 

I even made a list of everything romantic she did to me at our shifts. Made a sapphic character when we played a mobile game on the break. Said she “wanted a lot from me, if she started to list she wouldn’t be able to stop”. Asked if she’s special to me. Sent me a kissy emoji after I said “maybe”. Asked me if I text anyone I love them. I jokingly said that I do it to everyone and she said “why don’t you text it to me then”. Deadass told me she wouldn’t mind to go to bed with me (we were joking with our other colleague and the joke was explicitly sexual and she turned it around to say that to me when we were alone at work). Showed me my own socials and asked a question about them, I asked her why is she scrolling my Instagram and she replied “I am looking for info about me in your posts”. 

We are meeting for the first date tomorrow evening. Today we both were at work but not on the same shift. She sent me coffee and told me “I hope it brightens your day”. Then, she was kind of cold? She was just accusing me I did some work related tasks not right (it wasn’t my fault, I was not the one to do then anyway, we just work in pairs and my other colleague was in charge that day). And it was like? Mean? I didn’t like it and I was flabbergasted but didn’t show it. I was nervous about it all day and it kind of never ended. 

She was cold and critical all day but mixed it with memes and thoughts about our meeting tomorrow. I felt relief one hour, then felt anxious another. She was texting me all day (she didn’t really text me this much before). And now, at home, after I spoke to my friend (she didn’t like A’s behaviour too), I feel drained.

I am quite avoidant. If we stop what we have I’ll live but I’m bitter already. I don’t like people stressing me out this much I am already hyper-sensitive. To be honest, I roasted her too when we worked together. I ragebaited her and I was a mess because I wasn’t sure how to handle her attention. But why does it feel mean and uncalled for when she does it? Maybe, because she wasn’t like that when we met and when we worked together. She wasn’t like that, she was kind of timid and shy, didn’t stick up for herself at work. I am opposite, I would say. I still have insecurities but I am actively trying to be more assertive and build boundaries. 

And it’s a sudden change in her. And she wasn’t like that only to me, she was mean to my colleague too. And he was very shocked, they have a nice working relationship too. So, I feel sad now. It feels like she was trying to ruin my anticipation for our date tomorrow. She even posted a “collage” and included a couple of pics. One of them was like “I don’t know why I exist”. And the second one was like “no romantic interest. new clothes. peaceful life. good music. small circle”.

And like? No romantic interest? And she posted it to a very small count of her followers knowing I will see it. My posts on socials were lovey dovey all of this time, not like that. She even titled her post “vibe of TODAY”. I am sad. I thought I had something meaningful after all those years. And I really tried to make myself believe she just really likes that’s why she acts like that. 

Thank you of you read all that :( Should I tell her I am sick and won’t be able to make it to our date? I already bought her a Christmas present, I thought we will spend a beautiful day on an Christmas-themed ice rink and drink wine :(",4,1766332037.0,actuallesbians,2,0.83,False

Small, trivial events are immediately labeled as undeniable proof that the law is real, while anything meaningful is always framed as “not aligned yet,” “still unfolding,” or “blocked by resistance.” 

When someone manifests a free coffee, a butterfly, a random text, or a parking spot, it’s declared a win. These outcomes are low cost, high probability events that happen constantly to people who aren’t manifesting anything at all. Because they’re common, they’re easy to retroactively link to intention. The mind fills in the story after the fact and calls it causation. No risk is involved, no timeline is threatened, and no real life consequence hangs on whether it happens or not.

But notice what happens when the desire actually matters. Money that would change someone’s life, an SP who has clearly moved on, a health outcome, a career shift. Suddenly the rules change. Now belief must be “pure.” Detachment becomes mandatory. Wanting it too much is framed as sabotage. Time limits are removed. Failure is rebranded as a lesson. The same framework that confidently claims authorship over a coffee receipt becomes strangely humble when faced with real stakes.

This asymmetry exists because big outcomes test the theory in a way small ones never do. A major life change has clear before and after conditions. Either your rent got paid or it didn’t. Either the person came back or they didn’t. Either your circumstances shifted or they stayed the same. There’s no ambiguity to hide behind. So the system introduces infinite delay and infinite reinterpretation to avoid a clear “no.”

This is also why LOA advice becomes more abstract the more serious the problem is. Concrete claims disappear and are replaced with inner work, self concept, and emotional policing. The focus shifts away from outcomes and toward maintaining faith. At that point, the goal is no longer change. It’s belief preservation.

A framework that only celebrates wins when the stakes are low and explanations when the stakes are high isn’t describing reality. It’s managing disappointment. 

If a system were actually causal, it wouldn’t need to lower the bar for evidence and raise the bar for failure.

Written by [Jim Vaughn, CUSP](https://incident-prevention.com/blog/author/jimvaughncusp/) on December 9, 2025. Posted in [Train the Trainer 101](https://incident-prevention.com/blog/category/train-the-trainer-101/).

Ferroresonance is a complicated issue, one that industry workers must be educated about. That’s because as the number of URD system installations grows and systems age, instances of ferroresonance increase – as do threats to worker and customer safety, equipment and service reliability.

I first became acquainted with ferroresonance in the 1980s while troubleshooting a pad-mounted, three-phase transformer at night. The pad fed a chemical plant, closed for the evening, in the middle of nowhere. The 480-volt, 2000-amp main was single-phasing, so plant electricians had dropped all the 480-volt sub-feeds except one: a single-phase, 240-volt sub-panel that fed the plant’s fire control systems plus some lighting that was barely functional (keep this information in mind – it will be important a little later).

The underground radial feed was long, and the A-phase pothead fuse had blown; my first thought was a bad cable. We pulled the radial-fed elbows at the transformer, opened the 2000-amp main and re-fused the pothead. It held – so why had the other fuse blown? Next, we checked the meter’s kilowatt demand, which was barely more than half the peak-load capacity of the 1500-kVA transformer. Then we smoke-tested the transformer, closing it in from the potheads, opening the potheads with a load-break tool, and finally closing in the elbows on the de-energized pad.

The 23-kV potheads were dead-ended on a 10-foot heavy-duty double arm. The fuse for A-phase was on the far side of the arm, on the other side of the neutral from where the bucket truck had been set up. I wasn’t going to side-sling the fuse barrel feeding a 1500-kVA pad, so I boomed over the neutral positioning for the A-phase fuse and closed it. As I was booming back over the neutral to close in B-phase and C-phase, I heard what sounded like a car crash coming from the vicinity of the pad, followed by a flash and something going to ground. The A-phase pothead fuse erupted behind me and the feeder relayed. Back at the pad, A-phase and B-phase elbows were blown off the bushings. The A-phase polymer arrester that was plugged into the feed-through bushings had split down the middle and was still smoking. Additionally, the current transformer cabinet wiring and polyphase Class 10 meter were on fire.

**What Happened?**  
Given that the CEO of the chemical plant was on the utility company’s advisory board, some plant personnel were alerted when we blew up their transformer. Three crew members stayed at the plant to pull the bad transformer and ready a spare three-phase. An apprentice and I went to retrieve a new transformer. On our way to the yard, an engineer on-site at the plant radioed us, requesting that we bring back a 2000-kVA transformer. I asked if he thought the damaged transformer had been overloaded; he said no and told us he would explain more later.

His eventual explanation? You guessed it: ferroresonance.

As it turned out, during our troubleshooting, we had created perfect conditions for the loud noise and fire. No one had known that the capacitive reactance of the cable on A-phase and B-phase was nearly equal to – and in series with – the inductive reactance of the 1500-kVA transformer windings. In the evenings during the off-season, the plant reduced operation and electrical loads. With the matching series reactance of the cable and transformer impedance, the lightly loaded transformer would begin to react, creating low-level ferroresonance that overheated and prematurely aged the transformer until the pothead fuse blew. When we began troubleshooting and opened the main, conditions became ideal for runaway core excitation or ferroresonance. The fact that it had taken me a couple minutes to get from the A-phase fuse to the B- and C-phase fuses – combined with the open main and no secondary load – triggered everything needed to blow up that $60,000 installation.

You may still be wondering why the engineer requested that 2000-kVA transformer. The answer: in observing damage from the incident and speaking with the crew, he recognized the problem and opted for the new transformer to raise impedance. That way, the cable capacitance and transformer inductance would no longer be almost equal.

**Need-to-Know Info**  
Ferroresonance is a rare condition most likely to occur with three-phase, pad-mounted, delta-connected transformers. Not nearly as often, ferroresonance has been documented in wye-wye transformers as well as in aerial three-pot banks served by long-dedicated aerial circuits.

When ferroresonance occurs in a transformer, high voltages three to five times the rated primary can appear on the primary and secondary and in the core. Oil heats to temperature extremes in minutes, blowing out of vents and bubbling paint on top of the transformer. Surge arresters – not designed to clamp sustained overvoltages – can be cooked to destruction and potentially fragment during failure. The rise in primary also increases the secondary voltage, sometimes blowing up meters like bombs. Other times, purely coincidental yet ideal conditions create low-level ferroresonance that can boil the life out of a transformer with barely a whimper. I know of one case in which a 1000-kVA transformer was replaced three times in five years. Finally, the utility realized a low-level resonant circuit – yes, without an open phase – was killing the transformer every night when the commercial building load dropped to about 6% of the transformer’s rating.

URD cables are capacitors; transformer coils are magnetic inductors. To create resonant circuits, there must be capacitive reactance and inductive reactance of almost equal value in series with each other, and the inductor must have very little to no load. The most likely situation is a three-phase transformer fed by a long underground circuit. In some of the most dramatic events, a pothead fuse was opened or blew, allowing a still-energized primary cable (capacitance) to be more or less in series with a coil (inductance). If a series-connected phase-to-coil connection is allowed to remain energized, and there is low loading on the transformer’s secondary or the customer’s mains are open, no impedance exists in the primary circuit. Current is free to flow, and runaway voltage rises in the laminated core – hence the “ferro-” component of ferroresonance.

In testing, loading the secondary above 20% has proven sufficient to prevent resonance. The first indication of the condition is typically a loud rattling noise – often described as shaking a coffee can full of marbles – emanating from a transformer due to magnetostriction in the laminated core (note that normally, magnetostriction causes the 60-Hz hum in transformers). The noise is wicked enough that almost no one who hears it stands around to see what is going to happen next.

The two other ferroresonance cases I have worked on both involved amorphous-core, three-phase, pad-mounted, wye-delta transformers. One was 1,700 feet of 1/0 to a 1000-kVA; the other was 2,000 feet of 1/0 primary to a 1500-kVA pad-mount. These are not formulas for determining the potential for ferroresonance but examples of the conditions present when it has occurred.

**Preventive Efforts**  
So, what’s the best way to avoid suspected resonant circuits? Never open three-phase transformers one phase at a time from potheads or lateral taps. Some utilities are using an air-break or AB switch to isolate the coil before switching potheads.

Other methods include shortening the primary run to change capacitance or replacing transformers to ensure different inductive impedance values. Rural electric association specs add a fourth dropout to temporarily ground the high-side floating neutral when energizing or de-energizing three-pot banks. The goal is to split the series path between the primary feed and the transformer coils, removing the series reactance, which is a prime condition necessary to create the resonant circuit.

The last preventive effort is leaving some or all of the secondary load connected. This, of course, contradicts what we have always been told (i.e., “Don’t single-phase the customer”), but not to worry. You won’t kill the three-phase customer equipment in the time it takes to close three pothead switches – and you’ll almost certainly avoid blowing up a costly transformer.

1ps9gbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterAtPeople/comments/1ps9gbr/how_to_actually_connect_with_people_when_your/,"How to ACTUALLY Connect with People When Your Brain Screams ""RUN"": The Psychology That Works","Look, I get it. You walk into a room full of people, and your brain immediately starts that spiral: ""Everyone's judging me. I sound stupid. Why is my voice shaking? Oh god, they can tell I'm nervous."" It's exhausting. I've been there, staring at my phone at parties like it's a life raft, avoiding eye contact like it might burn me.

Here's what I've learned after diving deep into psychology research, therapist insights, and way too many books on social anxiety: Most of what you think is happening in social situations... isn't actually happening. Your anxious brain is a terrible narrator. But here's the good part, you can retrain it. After studying everything from attachment theory to neuroscience podcasts to actual clinical studies, I've found some tools that actually work. Not the BS ""just be yourself"" advice. Real, practical stuff.

Let me break it down.

## Step 1: Understand What's Actually Happening in Your Brain

Your anxiety isn't a personality flaw. It's your amygdala (the fear center of your brain) going absolutely apeshit because it thinks social situations are actual threats. Like, caveman-level threats. Your body literally can't tell the difference between ""talking to a stranger at a coffee shop"" and ""running from a bear.""

This is where Polyvagal Theory comes in (shout out to Dr. Stephen Porges). Your nervous system has different states: safe and social vs. fight/flight/freeze. When you're anxious, you're stuck in that threat state. The fix? You need to signal safety to your nervous system BEFORE you even try to connect with people.

Try this: Before entering a social situation, do some deep belly breathing (4 seconds in, 6 seconds out, repeat for 2 minutes). Sounds dumb, I know. But it literally activates your vagus nerve and tells your brain, ""Hey, we're not dying here. We're safe."" Works way better than just ""trying to relax.""

## Step 2: Stop Trying to Be Interesting, Start Being Interested

Here's the mindfuck: You think people are judging you, but most people are too busy worrying about how THEY come across to even notice your awkwardness. Dr. Brené Brown talks about this in her research on vulnerability and connection, everyone's insecure. Everyone's faking confidence to some degree.

So flip the script. Instead of panicking about what to say, ask questions. Real ones. Not ""how's the weather"" garbage. Ask stuff like:

* ""What's been taking up most of your headspace lately?""
* ""What are you geeking out about right now?""
* ""What's something you're looking forward to?""

People LOVE talking about themselves. It takes pressure off you, and you actually learn something. Plus, they'll walk away thinking you're a great conversationalist even if you barely said anything about yourself.

Book rec: How to Talk to Anyone by Leil Lowndes. Yeah, the title sounds cheesy as hell, but this book is PACKED with tactical conversation tricks that work when your brain is too anxious to think straight. It's like a cheat code for social situations. Lowndes breaks down exactly what to do with your body language, voice tone, even where to stand. For someone with anxiety, having a literal playbook is a game changer.

## Step 3: Accept That Awkward Silences Won't Kill You

You know what makes awkward silences actually awkward? YOU panicking about them. When there's a pause in conversation and you start sweating and scrambling for something, ANYTHING to say, that's when shit gets weird.

Try this instead: When there's silence, just... exist in it. Take a breath. Smile slightly. Let the other person fill it, or don't. Sometimes the best connections happen in comfortable silence. I learned this from the podcast The Happiness Lab with Dr. Laurie Santos (Yale professor, studies well-being and social connection). She talks about how our discomfort with silence is cultural and learned. You can unlearn it.

Practice staying in silence for just 3 extra seconds before you speak. It feels like FOREVER when you're anxious, but it's actually normal pacing in conversation.

## Step 4: Use the ""Anxiety as Excitement"" Reframe

This one's from The Upward Spiral by Dr. Alex Korb (neuroscientist who studies depression and anxiety). Your body's response to anxiety and excitement is basically identical: increased heart rate, sweaty palms, racing thoughts. The only difference is how your brain labels it.

So before a social situation, tell yourself out loud: ""I'm excited. This is excitement, not fear."" Sounds stupid? Yeah. Does it work? Surprisingly, yes. Your brain is dumb enough to believe you if you're convincing enough.

I started doing this before networking events, and it genuinely shifted how I showed up. Instead of ""oh god everyone will think I'm boring,"" it became ""oh cool, I might meet someone interesting.""

## Step 5: Lower the Stakes (Connection Doesn't Mean Friendship)

If you're anxious, you probably put INSANE pressure on every social interaction: ""I need to make them like me. I need to be funny. I need to be memorable."" That's way too much.

Reframe: Connection doesn't mean you have to become best friends or impress anyone. Sometimes connection is just... a nice chat that you both forget about in 20 minutes. And that's FINE.

Try the 5-minute rule: Commit to just 5 minutes of conversation. After that, you can bail if you want. But usually, once you're past those first brutal minutes, your anxiety settles and it gets easier.

App rec: Try Finch, a self-care app that helps you set small, manageable goals (like ""have one conversation today""). It gamifies self-improvement, which makes it less overwhelming when your anxiety is screaming at you to avoid everything.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia University alumni that pulls from expert interviews, research papers, and books to create personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans around your specific goals. If social anxiety is something you're working on, you can tell it exactly what you struggle with, whether it's small talk, reading social cues, or managing nervousness in groups, and it'll generate podcasts tailored to your needs.

The voice customization is honestly pretty addictive, there are over ten styles including this smoky, calming tone that's perfect for learning before bed. There's also a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with anytime to ask questions or get recommendations based on what clicks for you. For anyone trying to understand the psychology behind their social struggles and actually apply it, it's worth checking out.

## Step 6: Find ""Third Spaces"" Where Connection Is Easier

If parties and bars make you want to die, STOP GOING TO THEM. Seriously. Find environments where connection happens more naturally. Book clubs, hiking groups, volunteer orgs, gaming communities, whatever.

Why? Because you're doing an activity TOGETHER, which takes pressure off the ""performing in conversation"" part. You have a built-in topic (the book, the hike, the game), and you're bonding through shared experience instead of forced small talk.

Research from Bowling Alone by Robert Putnam (Harvard political scientist) shows that these ""third spaces"" (not home, not work) are where real community and connection happen. And honestly, people in hobby groups are usually more chill and less judgmental.

## Step 7: Share Small Vulnerabilities (Not Trauma Dumps)

Dr. Brené Brown's research (again, because she's the queen of this stuff) shows that vulnerability is the birthplace of connection. But here's the catch: It has to be APPROPRIATE vulnerability. Don't meet someone and immediately tell them your deepest trauma. That's a trauma dump, and it freaks people out.

Instead, share small, relatable struggles:

* ""Man, I'm terrible at remembering names. I'm gonna forget yours in 5 minutes, sorry.""
* ""Honestly, I was nervous to come tonight. Glad I did though.""
* ""I have no idea what I'm doing with my career right now. It's kinda terrifying.""

These small admissions make you human. They give the other person permission to be real too. And suddenly, you're actually connecting instead of just... performing normalcy.

## Step 8: Stop Waiting for Confidence to Show Up

Here's the truth bomb: Confidence is NOT a prerequisite for connection. You don't have to ""fix"" your anxiety before you can have relationships. You can be anxious AND connect with people at the same time.

I spent YEARS waiting to ""get over"" my anxiety before I put myself out there. Huge mistake. Action comes first, confidence comes later. You build confidence BY doing the thing that scares you, not before.

Book rec: The Confidence Gap by Dr. Russ Harris. This book destroyed me (in a good way). Harris is an ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) expert, and he basically argues that chasing confidence is a trap. Instead, you take action WHILE feeling afraid. The book has exercises that help you sit with discomfort and move forward anyway. Absolute game changer for anxious people.

## Step 9: Protect Your Energy (Not Everyone Deserves Your Effort)

If you're anxious, social situations drain you FAST. That's normal. So be selective about who you spend energy trying to connect with.

Some people are energy vampires. Some people are just... not your people. And that's okay. You don't owe everyone your time and effort.

Protect your energy by:

* Leaving events early if you need to (no shame)
* Saying no to social obligations that feel like torture
* Spending time with people who make you feel CALM, not more anxious

Connection is supposed to feel good, not like a performance review.

## Step 10: Remember That Everyone Is Making This Up As They Go

Final truth: Nobody knows what they're doing. That person who seems super confident and socially effortless? They're probably faking it or they've just practiced more. Social skills are SKILLS. You can learn them.

Your anxiety might never fully go away, and that's okay. But you can learn to function WITH it, not in spite of it. You can connect with people while your brain is still yelling at you. You're not broken. You're just wired differently.

And honestly? Once you find your people, the ones who get it, connection becomes less about performing and more about just... existing together. That's the goal.",1,1766331934.0,BetterAtPeople,0,1.0,False

1ps9eh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolanaLeveling/comments/1ps9eh8/best_crypto_debit_cards_to_spend_usdt_usdc_sol/,"Best Crypto Debit Cards to Spend USDT, USDC, SOL, BTC, and ETH","https://preview.redd.it/r1tyizd7vk8g1.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=940739aff6b4fe55860cedf350154d052bf02e8f

**Best Crypto Debit Cards** are the ultimate bridge between your digital wallet and the real world, and I’ve spent the last six months testing every single one of them to find the true winners. Most people immediately think of the big names like Crypto com, Binance, or Nexo when they want to spend their USDT, USDC, or Bitcoin. While those are solid ""entry-level"" options, they often come with heavy baggage: annoying staking requirements, tiered rewards that take years to unlock, or custodial risks that make a true crypto native cringe.

I’m a firm believer that if you own **SOL, BTC, or ETH**, you should be able to buy a coffee or pay for a flight without jumping through hoops. After cycling through dozens of apps, I’ve realized the real ""alpha"" isn’t in the cards everyone talks about; it’s in a new generation of providers that prioritize speed, high limits, and non-custodial flexibility.

# Why the Popular Crypto Cards Might Be Failing You

When I first started, I used the **Crypto com** card. It looked great on paper, but I hated having to lock up thousands of dollars in a volatile token just to get decent cashback. Then there was **Nexo**, which is fantastic for borrowing, but sometimes you just want a straight-up debit experience without the ""credit mode"" complexity.

The truth is, the ""best"" card is the one that stays out of your way. I wanted something where I could top up **USDT** on a cheap chain like Solana or Polygon and spend it instantly at a grocery store. That’s when I discovered the four heavy hitters that actually changed my daily spending habits.

# 1. Kast: The Solana Powerhouse for High Rewards

If you are deep in the **Solana ecosystem**, **Kast** is the card you didn’t know you needed. I started using Kast because I was tired of bridging assets back to Ethereum just to fund a card.

Get extra rewards: [**Join KAST Card**](https://kastfinance.app.link/6MHGEMGE) with code “**6MHGEMGE”** ! 🚀  
***SIGNUP BONUS:****Get* ***500 points ($25)*** *after KYC +* ***1,000 points ($50)*** *after you spend $100!*

# My Experience with Kast

The onboarding was lightning-fast. I had a virtual card ready in my Apple Wallet in under two minutes. What blew me away was the integration with **USDC and USDT on Solana**. The fees are virtually non-existent for conversions, and the cashback rates are actually sustainable.

* **Best For:** Solana natives and stablecoin spenders.
* **Key Stats:** Supports **USDT, USDC, and PYUSD**.
* **The Edge:** You can earn up to 5% in rewards without the predatory staking models of older platforms.

I’ve used this card for everything from high-end electronics to daily lunch, and the ""Tap-to-Pay"" has never failed me. It feels like a local bank app but with the soul of DeFi.

# 2. Tuyo: The Hidden Gem for Global Privacy

>

**Tuyo** is a name you don’t hear in the mainstream often, and that’s exactly why I love it. In my search for the **best crypto debit cards**, I wanted something that felt more ""crypto-first"" and less ""corporate-bank.""

# Why Tuyo Stands Out

Tuyo focuses on a seamless global experience. I’ve traveled through several countries with it, and the FX (foreign exchange) rates were surprisingly competitive. Unlike some cards that charge a ""convenience fee"" on top of the exchange rate, Tuyo keeps it transparent.

* **Spending Assets:** Great for **BTC, ETH, and USDT**.^(1)
* **Utility:** Excellent for digital nomads who need to pay in local currencies without getting slaughtered by bank fees.

It’s the kind of card you get when you’re tired of the ""Big Exchange"" ecosystem and want a dedicated tool for your assets.

# 3. Avici: The Non-Custodial Innovation2

>

For those of us who live by the ""Not your keys, not your coins"" rule, **Avici** is a total game-changer. Most crypto cards are custodial, meaning you send your money to their wallet.^(3) Avici flips the script.



# The Avici Spending Model

It functions as a **collateral-backed Visa card**.^(4) I link my self-custodial wallet, and instead of selling my ETH, I can spend against it. It’s essentially a decentralized credit line in your pocket.



* **Security:** You keep control of your assets.
* **Flexibility:** Supports **Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum**.
* **The Feel:** It’s a bit more technical, but for someone who spends a lot of time on Uniswap or Aave, it feels like the natural evolution of a debit card.

# 4. RedotPay: The King of High Limits and ATM Access

>

If you are moving significant volume or need a card that ""just works"" globally with massive limits, **RedotPay** is the undisputed heavyweight.^(5) I initially got this card for a large purchase when my traditional bank card kept getting flagged for ""suspicious activity.""



# Real-World Testing with RedotPay

The limits on this card are insane. We are talking about $100,000 per transaction and $1,000,000 daily limits. While most people don't need that much, the **ATM withdrawal capacity** is what makes it a lifesaver.

* **Assets:** **USDT, USDC, SOL, BTC, and ETH**.
* **Global Reach:** I’ve seen people in Argentina and Southeast Asia using this to escape local inflation because it’s so easy to top up and use at any Visa-supported merchant.^(6)
* **Fee Structure:** There is an issuance fee (around $10 for virtual, $100 for physical), but for the freedom it provides, it’s a bargain.^(7)

One user recently shared how they used RedotPay for a car down payment after their local exchange blocked their withdrawal. That’s the kind of reliability you need.

# Comparison: Choosing Your Best Crypto Debit Card

|**Feature**|**Kast**|**Tuyo**|**Avici**|**RedotPay**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Best For**|Solana Users|Privacy/Travel|Self-Custody|High Limits|

|**Card Type**|Visa|Visa/Mastercard|Visa|Visa|
|**Rewards**|High (Points/APY)|Standard|Premium Perks|High Limits|

# Final Thoughts: Moving Beyond Binance and 

Don't get me wrong, the big exchanges are fine for your first $100. But if you're serious about using your **Bitcoin or Solana** as actual money, you need to look at **Kast** for the rewards or **RedotPay** for the sheer power.

Spending crypto shouldn't feel like a chore. It should be as simple as tapping your phone and walking away. These four cards have proven to me that we are finally in the era where ""Pay with Crypto"" isn't just a marketing slogan; it's a daily reality.",1,1766331802.0,SolanaLeveling,0,1.0,False

This is my first post, i’ve been at SB for around a year now. Context: Im a regular barista who does and has talked about developing. (coffee master/barista trainer) I’m really struggling with this situation. To keep it short: the shift overheard a private conversation that was off the clock between me and another barista about feeling overwhelmed and unsupported, along with being coached nonstop. While i realize we shouldn’t have had this convo in the back, nothing personal or mean was said about this shift. Ever since said she overheard this she has been treating me differently than the rest of the baristas. Some examples are ignoring me when I’m speaking to her, not answering any questions, coaching me and not providing any reasoning or what to do differently. This has been going on for around 3 to 4 days. Friday I received a voice note from one of the other baristas, telling me that they were talking about me over the headset. One of the things said and I quote “ ask them to do one thing and they can’t even do that right” along with some small stuff about me losing my sharpies. I texted my manager, asking to speak to them because there’s frustration on both of our ends. I understand the shift being upset over what they overheard because I was upset over what I was told. I’m trying to be understanding and reasonable towards them. However, this shift has a past of treating partners differently, coaching them nonstop if they call out during one of their shifts or if they’re stressed, they do not provide any support during peak and will watch you struggle while standing doing nothing. Has anyone else experienced this? What should i do? i’ll take any all advice. Thank you!

which i understand fully and i said if the councler could say to him that i understand and if he ever wants to do something after he left there since hes almost 18 i think in a week and once ur 18 u need to leave there he can just send a message

and im fine with that bit of a bumer but im fine with that problem is idk if it actually was that reason or because of the joke but i cant do anything else than take his word

but idk that idea has been floating around in my head sometimes but hey people come and go and im only 16

it is what it is

but thats only a small part of why i feel ass and usualy i dont really think about it but idk what it is or why it is i just feel FUCKED

and idk what to do with this any tips

i dont wanna game i dont wanna read i dont wanna sleep i dont wanna watch a serie or movie

and my mom will be councling the dr about it but thats tommorow since he aint working rn but i swear to god if he suggest changing meds im gonna lose it these are the 3rd also had zoloft/sertralin and aripiprazol im on meds for 4 ish years rn and the going down in slowly dossage to start the other one is hell everytime i just hope i dont need to.. again

even tough i already feel fucked rn

and u know never had a gf or anything close to romanticly never even held hands which ik is completley fine and normal at 16 and i shouldnt worry about it but idk kinda makes me feel lonely sometimes

Furthermore, I was able to have 2+ coffees per day and caffeine tablets on top of that...) since forever.

Despite the fact I've always had the habit to wake up in the middle of the night to go to the loo, just since last August I've been experiencing the random difficulty of falling back asleep again.
I can tell it's definitely improving, and I can have now 2-4 very good nights as before (7.5-9 hours); however, now my body has the tendency of switching on (waking up) and switching off (falling asleep) continuously through the night and it's now always related to dreaming.

1ps9c62,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1ps9c62/how_top_1_students_actually_study_the/,How Top 1% Students Actually Study: The Science-Based System That Works,"You know what drives me nuts? Everyone's out here grinding for hours, rereading textbooks like zombies, highlighting everything in sight, and still bombing exams. Meanwhile, there's this small group of people who seem to absorb information like sponges, ace everything, and still have time for a life. What's their deal?

I've spent months diving deep into this, reading research from cognitive scientists, dissecting study methods from top performers, watching interviews with learning experts, and here's what I found: Most of us are studying completely wrong. We're using methods that FEEL productive but are scientifically proven to suck. The top 1% aren't smarter. They're just using a completely different playbook.

Let me break down the actual system that separates the A+ students from everyone else.

## Step 1: Stop Passive Learning (It's a Trap)

Here's the brutal truth. Rereading notes, highlighting, summarizing. All that stuff? Basically useless. Research from cognitive psychology shows these are the lowest impact study methods. They create the illusion of learning because they feel easy and comfortable. Your brain tricks you into thinking you know the material because it looks familiar.

The top 1% know this. They focus on active recall, which is retrieving information from memory without looking at your notes. This is hard. Your brain fights against it. But it's literally how you build long term memory.

Close the book. Try to explain the concept out loud. Write everything you remember on a blank page. That discomfort you feel? That's your brain actually creating neural pathways.

## Step 2: Embrace the Feynman Technique

Named after physicist Richard Feynman, this method is stupidly simple but insanely effective. Here's how it works:

Pick a concept. Pretend you're teaching it to a 12 year old. Explain it in the simplest terms possible, no jargon allowed. When you get stuck or can't simplify something, that's where your understanding breaks down. Go back, relearn that specific part, then try again.

The top performers I've studied all do some version of this. They're not just memorizing facts. They're building deep understanding by teaching the material to themselves or others. If you can't explain it simply, you don't really know it.

One podcast that goes deep on this is The Knowledge Project with Shane Parrish. He interviews world class thinkers about how they learn and retain information. The episodes with learning experts are pure gold. You'll hear how top performers approach complex subjects and break them down.

## Step 3: Spaced Repetition (The Memory Hack)

Your brain is designed to forget stuff. That's not a bug, it's a feature. But the top 1% work WITH this system instead of against it.

Enter spaced repetition. Instead of cramming everything the night before, you review material at increasing intervals. Study something today. Review it tomorrow. Then in three days. Then a week later. Then two weeks later. This pattern forces your brain to work harder each time you retrieve the information, which strengthens the memory.

There's an app called Anki that basically runs your entire study life on this principle. Medical students, language learners, and top performers across every field swear by it. You create flashcards, and the algorithm shows you cards right before you're about to forget them. Sounds simple, but this app has helped people pass medical boards, learn languages fluently, and memorize massive amounts of complex information.

Another solid option is RemNote, which combines note taking with spaced repetition. You take notes normally, but it automatically converts key concepts into flashcards and schedules reviews for you.

BeFreed is an AI learning app built that creates personalized podcasts from research papers, expert talks, and top books based on what you want to learn. Type in your study goals or problem areas, and it pulls from verified academic sources to generate custom audio content. You control the depth, from quick 15-minute overviews to detailed 40-minute deep dives with examples. It also builds an adaptive learning plan that evolves as you progress, and there's a virtual coach you can ask questions to mid-session. Useful if you're commuting or multitasking and want structured audio learning that actually fits your specific needs.

## Step 4: Interleaving (Mix It Up Like Crazy)

Most people study one topic at a time until they feel they've mastered it. Chapter 1, then Chapter 2, then Chapter 3. Seems logical, right? Wrong.

Research shows that interleaving, mixing different topics and problems in one study session, creates better long term retention. When you switch between concepts, your brain has to work harder to retrieve the right strategy for each problem. That extra effort builds stronger connections.

Top students don't study math for two hours straight. They'll do 20 minutes of calculus, switch to 20 minutes of statistics, then back to calculus, then throw in some word problems. Sounds chaotic, but it's scientifically proven to boost learning.

Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning by Peter C. Brown is the bible on this stuff. Brown spent years researching cognitive science and learning strategies. The book dismantles every myth about studying you've ever heard and replaces them with evidence based methods. It's not some motivational fluff, it's hardcore science written in a way that actually makes sense. This book will completely change how you approach learning. Best learning book I've ever touched.

## Step 5: Test Yourself Constantly (Even When It Sucks)

Pop quiz. Right now, without looking at your notes, what did you learn in your last study session? Can't remember? That's the problem.

The top 1% test themselves relentlessly. Not because they enjoy pain, but because testing is learning. Every time you try to retrieve information, even if you fail, you're strengthening that neural pathway. Practice tests aren't just for measuring what you know. They're the actual learning tool.

Take practice exams under real conditions. Time yourself. No notes. No phone. Make it as close to the real thing as possible. The discomfort you feel during practice tests is exactly what prepares you for the real exam.

## Step 6: Study in Chunks (Pomodoro on Steroids)

Your brain can't focus intensely for hours. Anyone who says they can is lying or delusional. The top performers know this and structure their study sessions around focused bursts.

The Pomodoro Technique is the basic version. Study for 25 minutes, break for 5. Repeat. But here's the upgrade: During those 25 minutes, you're doing deep work. No phone. No notifications. No ""quick checks"" of anything. Full focus on one task.

There's an app called Forest that gamifies this. You plant a virtual tree that grows while you study. If you leave the app to check social media, your tree dies. Sounds silly, but the visual of not wanting to kill your tree actually works. Plus, they partner with real tree planting organizations, so your focused study sessions help plant actual trees.

## Step 7: Sleep and Exercise Aren't Optional

Look, I get it. You want study hacks, not lifestyle advice. But here's the deal: The top 1% treat sleep and exercise as non negotiable parts of their study system because the science is crystal clear. Your brain consolidates memories during sleep. If you're pulling all nighters, you're literally erasing the information you just studied.

And exercise? It increases blood flow to your brain, releases BDNF, brain derived neurotrophic factor, basically miracle grow for your neurons, and improves focus. A 20 minute walk before studying can boost your retention significantly.

Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker is a neuroscience professor's deep dive into how sleep affects learning and memory. Walker makes it clear: If you're sacrificing sleep to study more, you're shooting yourself in the foot. The book is terrifying in how much damage sleep deprivation causes, but also empowering because it shows exactly how to optimize your sleep for maximum brain performance.

## Step 8: Pretests (The Mind Blowing Hack)

Here's something wild that most people never do: Take a practice test BEFORE you study the material. Sounds backwards, right? You'll get everything wrong. That's the point.

Research shows that attempting to answer questions before you know the answers primes your brain to pay attention to the right information when you do study. It's like giving your brain a roadmap of what's important. The top 1% use this constantly. They look at practice problems or past exams first, THEN start learning the material. It makes studying way more efficient.

## Step 9: Environment Design (Set Yourself Up to Win)

You can't study effectively in your bed with Netflix playing in the background and your phone buzzing every 30 seconds. Top performers are ruthless about their study environment.

Find a dedicated space that signals ""study mode"" to your brain. Library, coffee shop, desk, whatever works. Just not your bed or couch. Those are rest zones. Keep them that way.

Remove all distractions. Phone in another room or in a drawer. Use website blockers if you need to be on your computer. Make it harder to procrastinate than to just study.

## Step 10: The Meta Skill (Learn How to Learn)

The real secret of the top 1%? They don't just study hard. They study how to study. They constantly refine their methods, experiment with new techniques, and track what actually works for them.

Check out Learning How to Learn on Coursera. It's taught by Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, two experts in learning science. The course breaks down exactly how your brain processes and retains information. Over 3 million people have taken it, and it's consistently rated as one of the best online courses ever. It's free, and it'll give you the frameworks to optimize your own learning system.",1,1766331637.0,MotivationByDesign,0,1.0,False

1ps99tz,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ps99tz/starting_over/,Starting over,"Man my fiancé, partner of 8 years, came up to me on Tuesday and said she is no longer in love with me. I was working and she had left to go shopping, she turned off her location (odd) and got home hours later. I was on my break at work and she comes up to my home office and goes “I am no longer in love with you, i love you as a person, but nothing more than that”. I honestly tried to convince her to see if we can salvage our relationship and she kept saying nothing will make her change her mind, not counseling, not talking about it, she just doesn’t want me there. She even kicked me out of my apartment and kept my dog. She said I wasn’t satisfying her, or helping her around the house, our sex life did suck but we were living with her parents 6 out of those 8 years and it made it hard to. I’m not gonna say I’m the best house husband but I did feel like I helped a good amount in comparison to other men. We moved out in 2024, made it through a whole year in the apartment and sign for another month and a half. She even talked about just getting married in the court 2 weeks before breaking up with me. Shit, she had just graduated with her bachelors and we celebrated with her family. She has been acting like this break up didn’t affect her. I tried to ask her if she’s replacing me, and like, all the signs point to that, but she kept denying it. 

I have been struggling with depression for years while with her, I looked for some help and got therapy but all they do is teach you to cope with it lol. I have a gun and I’ve pointed that shit at my head at least 1x per day. I finally moved out to my parents, and gave the gun to my dad. I went on leave with my job but I don’t think it would be approved and might even lose my job lol. I haven’t really done anything aside from sleep and cry this whole week. It’s crazy cause it’s like she isn’t the same person i fell in love with, she just changed overnight. I know people say “there’s lots of fish in the sea” but bro it felt like I caught a shiny Pokémon, her love and care was so soft and nurturing, and I took it for granted. We planned to buy a house after this year and a half of renting. We had plans of children, plans of moving to a different state after having a steady life. I was going to start college next year, take my TSI on Monday to then register for classes. Now that college where I would take my TSI is 20 miles away instead of .2 miles away. My job went from 5 miles away to 17 miles away. My favorite coffee shop is was only available in that city and was less than 4 minutes away from our apt. We had planned a concert date to see MCR next year too, she took away my ticket the day after breaking my heart. I know in the future I’ll find someone who will care for me as much or even more, but I really wanted her to be the one.",1,1766331463.0,depression,1,1.0,False

1ps9889,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ps9889/coffee_with_the_taste_of_tears/,Coffee with the Taste of Tears,"Grief—a word we all know too well.

We recognize it instantly,

carry an intimate understanding of it.

Most of the time, it arrives without warning;

sometimes it seeps so deeply into us

it feels as though it wants to take our life with it.

If you ask anyone who has lived through mourning, sorrow, and loss,

they will remember pain—

because behind every pain, grief is rooted.

Sometimes the pain grows so immense

that it pulls a human being straight into mourning.

Yesterday, I was listening to a podcast about this very subject.

The guest was David Kessler, speaking about grief.

His words were precious—

and I found myself inside them.

He said that grief comes from love.

The deeper and more intense the love,

the heavier the mourning becomes.

Grief is simply another form of pain—

and if you stay with it long enough,

you will discover that love exists

on the other side of pain.

That sentence shook my heart.

How true it is.

How deeply I feel it.

Maybe that is why I still haven’t passed through this stage—

because I loved in a way I cannot explain.

All I know is this:

loss, whether it comes from death

or from the collapse of a relationship,

from a separation cruelly forced upon you,

leaves the same wound.

It was forced upon me twice in a very short time—

once with the death of my beloved father,

and once when you and I became strangers.

Grief feels like being thrown onto a road you do not know—

a road you were never taught how to drive.

You know nothing about it,

yet suddenly you are on it.

That is where I am now.

Pushed into it unwillingly,

learning slowly how to move forward,

how to follow the light,

toward a destination filled with beauty, freshness,

and the scent of something like spring.

We all wish for a companion on the way—

but this is a journey each person must take alone.

When you left, I became like a pair of scissors

with one blade missing—

cut in half, incomplete.

I searched for you everywhere,

but perhaps you attached yourself to another blade,

or chose a different road toward your own destination.

I still think of you.

And of my father—

whom I carry with me every day,

piece by piece, breath by breath.

I think of the days when you were both beside me.

This was the heaviest lesson of my life—

a lesson I was never prepared for.

But lessons like this force a new way of seeing;

they make you wiser, more awake, more human.

Still, I loved my madness—

before you, and with you.

I remembered how you once called me crazy—

for showing up unexpectedly,

for asking the questions I needed answered,

for trying to protect the only thing still alive inside me

after my father’s death:

my love for you, and what we had.

I know you did not truly believe I was crazy,

but you judged me.

Others did too.

The truth is, I only loved you fiercely.

And you left me alone with unanswered questions.

At times I wondered if I was wrong—

if my actions were far from who I truly am.

The real me is wiser.

And yet, even though what I did was a mixture of courage and foolishness,

a part of me admired myself

for choosing to fight for what I wanted,

for the one I loved,

even for standing against my own fear.

This is what I love about myself:

at every stage of my life,

I have faced what stood in front of me—

even when the ending was not the one I hoped for.

Yesterday, listening to the voice of a grief expert,

I finally understood something important:

I was not crazy.

I was grieving.

And everything I did was human,

completely normal.

I was relieved to finally have my answer.

I wish you could have understood me—

understood what losing a father does to the heart.

All I wanted was for you to say, I’m here.

I did not need explanations.

I only needed your presence.

Just one embrace.

Today, while moving through these memories,

a single tear fell into my cup of coffee.

Coffee infused with tears.

What a strange mixture—

love, grief, separation,

and a quiet taste of salt.

I tasted it.

I liked it.

After all, it was my own tear—

and it made the coffee richer, more valuable,

because for every drop of it,

I paid with countless lessons.

Maybe this should be added to menus one day:

coffee with the taste of tears—

so everyone can taste it.

Loss is what happens in life;

meaning is what you make happen

after the loss,

after the pain.

And that is where healing begins.

In the talking stages, everything can be going good.

The minute I say no or clearly communicate a boundary

Doesn't even have to be a big deal, just saying no to literally anything can get me ghosted

Such as if they ask for a drink and I say how about coffee instead

The last person was doing lots of love bombing saying how much they want to be with me, and don't want me to talk to anyone else , swearing they will never ghost me

But I was staying rational , a bit neutral from it since I prefer actions over words and I've been hurt so many times before but I wanted to stay open minded and hopeful

This person for the 3rd time left me on read for over 24 hours after texting fast like crazy other times saying how much they want to be with me , like me, promising morning and good night texts

It kinda felt like since it's the weekend maybe they went out on a date each day/night and just chose to ignore me

It's long distance so how can I possibly know 

All the while they keep insisting how they don't want me to talk to anyone else

So I got irritated by this and just said I appreciate consistency and if someone wants to be the only person in my life then they need to satisfy my need for communication

So I know I'm being ghosted but I still keep checking and my mind keeps wondering if they will reply

Why do people do this and not just say ok sorry and explain and just say why ghosting just sucks

My hands would sweat, my voice would shake, the whole deal. It didn't matter what kind of interview it was - whether a quick phone screen, a large panel with five people staring at me, or anything else. I would always freeze up, and I'm sure it showed when I tried to answer their questions.

After I got my current job, my manager told me something that changed everything. He told me to stop thinking of it as an 'interview,' and remember that you're just talking to normal human beings. They are exactly like you. They have good days and bad days, they spill coffee on their shirts, and they're not there to attack you. They're just normal people trying to find someone to fill a spot on their team. Sure, they might have a big title or work in a fancy office, but underneath all that, they're just a regular person. If you can approach the situation with the same casual vibe you use when talking to a barista or your neighbor, you'll find all that stress... Disappears.

I know it sounds overly simple. But after doing more than 50 interviews in my career, this was the first time I thought about it this way. It really helps you calm down and truly be yourself.

I (35M) am looking to start a weekly online or offline long-term homebrewed DnD (2014) campaign with three to five players that draws heavily from the Warcraft universe & lore. (No experience with any Warcraft games is required to join if you’re still interested!).  

If online, be located wherever as long as you’re available in the 6:00-11:00pm EST range on a weeknight (specific day TBD based on everyone's availability). If offline, games would take place in the northern New Jersey (Bergen/Passaic County) area, about a half hour from northern Manhattan (assuming no traffic, which is a BIG f\*cking assumption for northern NJ).

I value information & transparency, so I’ve written a mini-f\*cking-dissertation that includes information about me, the campaign story/themes, what to expect if you join, and what I’d be looking for in players. Hoping to hear from some folks who’d be interested in playing!

 

**About Me:**

When I’m not working or spending time with family & friends, I’m pursuing any number of hobbies/interests (hockey, hiking, baking, bugging my fiancé, etc.). But one of my biggest loves is fantasy: books, movies, games (including the abovementioned Warcraft franchise), you name it. So, when I was introduced to DnD \~5 years ago by a friend who invited me to join their campaign, I was naturally smitten by pretty much all of it: the system, the lore, the gameplay, etc.

Since then, I’ve been DMing DnD (2014) for 2-3 years. During that time, I’ve DM’d several one shots & short-term campaigns with a group of friends from work & other areas of life. Unfortunately, everyone in the group has moved or has had life sh\*t happen that limits their playing, and so I’ve turned to Reddit to hopefully connect with some other folks who have a similar interest in DnD.

With that out of the way, here’s a little bit about the campaign I have in mind.

 

**Campaign Overview:**

Welcome to Azeroth, a high fantasy setting with dark, epic, & steampunk fantasy flavorings.

Azeroth is a world of abundance, rich with peoples, materials, & magics. (Azeroth also happens to have the soul of a nascent deity slumbering at its core, but that’s a story for another day). Consequently, Azeroth has had the tremendous misfortune of encountering unremitting threats as local, global, & cosmic forces vie for control – or destruction – of its resources. Just in the last few years, Azeroth has seen:

* A crime syndicate seize control of the Kingdom of Stormwind’s fertile farmlands to force restitution for an old injustice.
* A faction of orc refugees invade the Ashenvale Forest, ancestral homeland of the night elves, to claim its resources to construct a homeland for themselves.  
* A dark titan unleash his legion of demonic followers across the planet to extinguish all life & hope.

Needless to say, the many peoples of Azeroth are traumatized. (I mean, how much of the above can any person really take?). But those peoples are also resilient. They’re strong. And they’re hopeful. Which is good, because – surprise! – another threat has surfaced that seeks destruction & domination.

**Enter**: The Lich King. The Prince of Darkness. The Lord of the Undead. Two decades ago, this embodiment of death arose from his throne on the frozen continent of Northrend and waged a vindictive war on the living in Azeroth. His plague of undeath transformed droves into creatures from nightmares. Zombies crowded the streets of Lordaeron City. Ghouls terrorized the farmfolk of the Hillsbrad Foothills. And the Lich King’s death knights, risen champions wielding necromantic magics, led his army across half of a continent, leaving naught but terror & sorrow in their wake.

The peoples of Azeroth rose to challenge this terrible enemy. New alliances were forged. New champions emerged. And, in the end, they drove the Lich King and the bulk of his forces back to the icy hell from which they came. The Lich King was not defeated, but Azeroth’s peoples had won a great victory.

And so, many of these peoples returned to their families, their work, their hopes, & their squabbles, eager to forget the memories of destruction that plagued their days & dreams. They turned their attention toward healing their wounds and preparing for the new threats that would inevitably materialize – or the old ones that would resurface. But others struggled to return. Others struggled to forget. Because they awoke each morning to their fractured kingdoms, their ravaged homes, and the remnants of the undead army that ravaged their lands. These others knew that their great victory was fleeting, that they would one day face anew the wrath of the Lich King. And they vowed to be ready.

It’s a good thing they did. Because a second plague has arrived. A second invasion has come. And these events have ignited the lingering fury of the survivors of that first war, who are taking up arms and preparing to take the fight to the Lich King’s unholy realm.

From his frozen throne, the Lich King watches. He waits. He plans. And gazing upon this imminent invasion, he laughs and says, “You seek to bring judgment upon the damned? Good. Come, then, you heroes. Come in all your power and glory! But know that, in the final hour, all will serve the one… true… king.” 

**Core Themes:** good vs evil, hope vs doubt, power vs corruption, justice vs revenge, person vs society, person vs self, betrayal, heroism, etc.

 

**What should you expect?**

At this point, you may be sitting wherever you are – the couch, your office, the bathtub, I don’t judge – and thinking, “Okay, this setting & story sound pretty f\*cking cool. \[Or maybe you think it sounds terrible, in which case, life’s too short to keep reading this interminably long write-up, and I’ll wish you the best in finding the table you’re looking for!\]. But what will it be like to actually *play* DnD in this campaign?” Great question! Here’s a little overview of how I typically DM.

* **Rules**: I adhere to rules as written, although I’ll integrate minor homebrewed rule/mechanics systems that I think will be meaningful and enrich the game. I’m also happy to subscribe to the “rule of cool.”
* **Sandbox? Railroad?:** Both! I have an outline of the story and its key elements (e.g., story arcs, BBEGs, locations, NPCs). However, it’s important for players to have agency, and so I’ll also emphasize providing choices & following players’ leads. See “Collaboration” below for more.
* **Encounters**: I try to integrate all aspects of DnD into each campaign for a well-rounded game, including social encounters (e.g., helping out, aiding diplomacy), combat encounters, puzzle/trap encounters, exploration encounters, mystery-solving encounters, etc. This campaign will likely feature social & combat encounters the most, but other types will appear to varying degrees.
* **Dynamism**: I adhere to the belief that encounters & games should be dynamic. Combat should be urgent & exigent. Social interactions should be engaging & meaningful. Mysteries should feel suspenseful, and exploration should involve wonder. I try my best to fulfill these ideals. 
* **Choices Matter**: I root for players and want them to win, but I won’t take failure off the table. Travel recklessly in the wilderness, and you might miss your destination. Act like an a\*\* to that NPC, and they may be petty – or seek revenge – at a later date. Search every corner of every room for a desired object, and the dungeon denizens will probably find you. And, of course, death can happen. All choices have repercussions, and I try to structure my games with this axiom in mind.
* **Roleplaying**: Many players love their characters and want to support their development. So, I try to create opportunities for players to do just that. I’ll especially emphasize opportunities for character development via dynamic encounters & conflicts, because it’s often the choices made in those circumstances that facilitate change & growth.
* **Collaboration**: Although I do have an outline of the story & its elements, I value collaboration & player involvement. I’ll encourage opportunities for player choice & agency, and I’ll often invite – and honor – feedback to ensure players are enjoying the game. I’m also welcoming of player ideas for the game and/or story. Maybe a player wants to have a 1-on-1 session to explore a part of their background or undergo some sort of training. Maybe players want to have a session doing town mode, where they craft, carouse, etc. While I won’t guarantee that I’ll accommodate every idea/request, I’m happy to listen & discuss possibilities to support a collaborative experience.
* **Consistency**: Players make time, change schedules, etc. for the game, and it’s important to honor that. I will do my absolute best to be consistent with scheduling, attendance, & communication. I do work a job that occasionally involves unexpected changes or crises, but I’ll do my best to be present, on time, & prepared every single week.
* **Flavor**: Games are supposed to be fun, so I’ll integrate a lot of levity into campaigns I run (e.g., humor, voices, absurd personalities, etc.). However, I’ll balance that levity with gravity in the circumstances that demand it (e.g., instances of loss, betrayal, adversity). Also, a heads up (in case it isn’t clear already): I swear a lot.

 

**Game Details:**

* **System**: DnD 5E (2014 rules)
* **Platform**: If online, we’ll most likely use a combination of Roll20 and Discord or Zoom. If offline, I figure we can meet publicly (e.g., at a local library or coffee shop) a few times until everyone is comfortable/familiar with each other. After that, I’d be open to discussing options for hosting. **Note:** If online, I'll mainly use Roll20 for battle maps & tokens, and I'll integrate quite a bit of theater of mind.
* **Schedule**: A weekday evening (specific day TBD based on availability) & a start time at \~7:00pm EST, although I can be flexible in the 6:00pm-11:00pm EST range. I’d prefer to meet weekly if it’d be possible with everyone’s schedules, although bi-weekly is an option if needed.
* **Campaign Length**: I’m hoping that this could be a long-term campaign. To give an idea based on my initial outline, the campaign could include: a) two overarching, intertwined stories; b) four to five main story arcs; and c) 50+ sessions (and can continue indefinitely).



**What I’m looking for:**

If you’ve made it this far through my mini-dissertation and are still interested in the game outlined above, here are a few of the things that I’m looking for in players.

1. Three to five players age 25+. (Pre-formed groups are a bonus!). **Notes**: All genders, sexualities, etc. are welcome (LGBTQIA+ friendly). All levels of experience (from veteran to brand new) are welcome. All levels of familiarity with the Warcraft games or universe (from player since Warcraft 1 to never having heard of it before) are welcome.
2. Players who are decent humans. I have NO patience for bigotry, hostility, or disrespect of any kind (that sh\*t isn’t welcome with me or at any table I run or join).
3. Folks who would be interested/invested in the story & game as outlined above.
4. People who are reliable. While I recognize that life can be wildly unpredictable and am happy to accommodate folks when it is, I’m hoping everyone will have the same respect for consistency that I’ll bring.
5. A party with chemistry. Since the goal is for this campaign to be long-term, players are going to be spending a whole lot of time together. Having players with similar game-related interests, playstyles, & priorities will be helpful, as will be players who support each other, show one another respect, and communicate effectively. Also, it’d be optimal if players actually f\*cking like each other & want to spend time together. Pre-made groups are therefore welcome & a bonus!

 

**Wrapping Up:**

Phew! That was a wild amount of information, and I’m impressed by – and grateful for – anyone who was willing to read all of it.

If you’re interested in all of the above and feel like you’d be a good fit, please feel free to DM me directly. In that message, tell me a little bit about yourself:

1. Name/age/other identifying characteristics that you’d like to share
2. Your availability for sessions (e.g., days, times, online or offline)
3. Your experience with TTRPGs (DnD specifically) and your playstyle (Note: new players are welcome!).
4. A little bit about what you look for in a DnD game.
5. A little bit about what you look for in other DnD players.
6. Any questions that you have for me! 

I’m looking forward to hearing from you!

1ps92j4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ps92j4,A Look Back at 2025: Best of Drama Smackdown: The Moment I Realized I'd Become Unhinged (And Decided to Lean Into It)," **Greetings,** people who've watched my sanity deteriorate in real-time, newcomers wondering why someone would write 3000 words about staring, and everyone who's ever had that moment where you realize you've gone too deep but it's too late to turn back!

 So here's the thing about writing Drama Smackdown/Bite-Sized Brutality articles: somewhere along the way, I stopped being a normal person who watches dramas and became someone who pauses mid-episode to frantically type ""WAIT. THE HAND SANITIZER. IT'S A FORMULA."" into my notes app at 3am.

 I can pinpoint the EXACT moment I lost it.

 I was watching my seventeenth show where a CEO couldn't touch humans but got magically cured by one woman's skin, and instead of just enjoying the romance like a NORMAL PERSON, I started counting. Hand sanitizer deployment: 43 seconds into episode one. Tragic backstory reveal: episode two, 2:17 mark. Miracle touch: episode three, ALWAYS episode three.

 And I sat there in my pajamas, hair in a messy bun, surrounded by empty coffee cups, and thought: ""I need to document this. I need to expose this conspiracy.""

 That's when I knew I'd crossed a line.

 But here's the beautiful thing about crossing lines, once you're over, you might as well SPRINT. So here is my ego trip across the last year. Your Chaos Queen demands you enjoy 🤣

 

 **The Hand Sanitizer Incident (Or: How I Accidentally Became An Economics Expert)**

 The germaphobic CEO article started as a joke. I was going to write a quick 500-word roast about how these dudes all have the same psychological condition.

 Then I started researching.

 THEN I COULDN'T STOP RESEARCHING.

 Suddenly I'm reading actual psychology papers about touch aversion. I'm taking notes on Pavlovian conditioning. I'm analyzing the EXACT FORMULA these shows use: establishment shot (hand sanitizer in 90 seconds), tragic backstory (makes him sympathetic), miracle touch (she's special!), surrender moment (love conquers therapy!).

 I wrote the line ""maybe psychological conditions shouldn't be cured by magical girlfriends"" and felt like I'd achieved enlightenment.

 But the REAL moment of genius? When I pointed out that the trauma is ALWAYS about touch/intimacy, never about, say, eating vegetables. ""Because we need romantic healing, not therapy for his fear of broccoli.""

 I was SO PROUD of that broccoli line. Unreasonably proud. I texted it to three people.

 Posted the article. Went to bed feeling smug.

 This is what I was BORN to do.

 

 **The Childhood Savior Spiral (Or: When I Realized ""Romantic"" Is Just ""Stalking"" With Better PR)**

 But see, once you start SEEING the formulas, you can't UNSEE them.

 I'm watching this show where a CEO marries a woman who gave him a paper crane when they were kids. She doesn't remember. He's been searching for her for A DECADE. And I'm sitting there thinking... wait. WAIT.

 This is fraud.

 This is ELABORATE, PREMEDITATED FRAUD with a marriage license.

 So I wrote ""You Saved Me 10 Years Ago So I Bought You a Marriage Certificate"" and I was UNLEASHED.

 Every scene got the treatment:

 Young ML crying in rain (ALWAYS RAIN, why is it always raining??). Random kid gives him a paper crane. He clutches it like the Holy Grail. I wrote: ""No one's searching for the girl who gave them $20"" and felt VERY clever about it.

 Cut to adult ML with an entire SHRINE to this childhood memory. Visiting the spot annually. I wrote: ""like it's a grave"" and then ""He's NEVER considered she might be married, dead, or completely different as an adult. In his mind, she's frozen in time, waiting to be found like a lost wallet.""

 Then the ""accidental"" reunion where he recognizes her by a MOLE she probably doesn't even remember having, and I lost it. I LOST IT. ""He remembered a MOLE? I can't even...""

 But the line I'm MOST proud of? When I explained how he manipulates her into flash marriage while hiding the truth about their past:

  ""The 'business arrangement' angle lets him have his obsession cake and eat it too—he gets proximity without revealing he's been searching for her since his balls dropped.""

  I wrote that line. Reread it. Laughed for five minutes straight. Posted it.

 The COMMENTS.

 That's when I knew I'd nailed it. That's when I knew I wasn't just analyzing—I was DEMOLISHING.

 

 **The Stare Spiral (Or: The Time I Wrote From Inside A Man's Horny Brain)**

 Then I made a TERRIBLE decision.

 Then I got horny for eye contact. Eye contact. How hard could that be?

 WELL.

 I decided to write the ENTIRE THING from the ML's first-person perspective while he's absolutely FERAL about this woman.

 So I'm sitting there at my laptop, CHANNELING the energy of a man who's losing his mind at a corporate event because she tucked her hair behind her ear:

 ""Fuck, she just tucked her hair behind her ear. Look at that neck. I want to bite it. That dude she's talking to better leave. She's laughing now. Head tilted back, that real laugh. Who made her laugh like that?""

 I'm TYPING this. Husband can see my screen. I don't care. I'm POSSESSED.

 The Memorization scene where he's watching her sleep:

 ""She's drooling. Fuck, that's adorable. Why is that adorable? I should wake her. But if I wake her, she'll stop being this unguarded. This... mine. Just... let me look at you for a minute. Store this. For when she's not yours to look at anymore.""

 I wrote a man counting a woman's freckles while having an existential crisis and I've NEVER BEEN MORE PROUD.

 The Possessive stare:

 ""Who the FUCK is that. He's standing too close. She's laughing. At HIS joke. That's MY laugh. Mine. He touched her arm. My body's moving before I think. If he's still touching her when I get there, I'm going to—""

 And the Longing stare where he can't have her yet:

 ""I want to be the reason for that laugh. I want to stop pretending I don't think about her every waking moment. But I can't. Because timing. Because reasons that sound smart at 3am but feel empty now.""

 Posted it. Prayed people wouldn't think I was insane.

PEOPLE WENT FERAL BACK.

 I created analytical monsters and weaponized horniness for educational purposes. ICONIC.

 

 **The Chemistry Investigation (Or: When I Accidentally Became The FBI)**

 At this point, I'm in too deep. I'm COMMITTED to the chaos.

 So when I noticed that some on-screen couples just HIT DIFFERENT, I didn't just think ""oh that's nice chemistry.""

 No.

 I researched MICROEXPRESSIONS. I looked up studies on pupil dilation. I read about the orbicularis oculi muscle and genuine smiles versus social smiles.

 Then I wrote an article breaking down EXACTLY how to spot real couples:

 The touch that lingers after ""cut."" The way his hand stays on her jaw, thumb stroking her cheekbone, even though the director called cut TWICE.

 The protective hyperfocus where his eyes track her even when she's not in the scene, and he positions himself between her and literally everything including the CAMERA CREW.

 The interrupted kiss where they don't pull apart immediately, foreheads touching, whispered conversation no one else hears.

 But THEN—and this is where I really cooked—I got into the UNCOMFORTABLE ECONOMICS.

 How platforms are encouraging on-set relationships through ""chemistry bonuses."" How some contracts include BREAKUP PENALTIES because the relationship IS the marketing strategy.

 I wrote: ""We've created a system where falling in love on set is a performance metric. Where genuine human connection has a price tag.""

 Posted it feeling like an investigative journalist.

 I made people question capitalism WHILE confirming their shipping instincts. That's RANGE.

 

 **The Wall Slam Economic Report (Or: When Thirst Became A Dissertation)**

 And then. THEN.

 I thought: what if I made HAND PLACEMENT educational?

 So I researched the actual ECONOMICS of wall slams, wrist grabs, and chin tilts. I found retention statistics. Engagement data. I discovered the ""Golden Three Rule"" that if shows don't have physical contact in the first 3 episodes, viewers GHOST.

 I broke down how these shows pack 3-5 intimate moments per 90 SECONDS while traditional dramas do 1-2 per HOUR.

 I included actual neuroscience about mirror neurons and how your brain thinks YOU'RE the one getting pinned against the wall.

 Then I wrote: ""We're literally spending more on wrist grabs than therapy to process why we're attracted to wrist grabs.""

 And: ""These platforms discovered that our collective touch starvation + terrible relationship models = unlimited money printer.""

 I turned THIRST into ECONOMICS. I made horniness EDUCATIONAL.

 I made people learn while horny. REVOLUTIONARY.

 

 **The Shameless Pursuit Victory Lap (Or: When I Finally Found A Green Flag And Celebrated)**

 After destroying seventeen toxic tropes, I finally found something GOOD.

 The shameless romantic who has zero chill about his feelings and makes it everyone's problem through sheer persistent devotion.

 No games. No brooding. Just: ""Are you following me?"" ""Yes. I told you I'm pursuing you. Why are you surprised?""

 I wrote him showing up EVERYWHERE with complete shamelessness. Defending her without being asked. Flirting inappropriately during work meetings. Winning her over through just being GENUINELY EXCELLENT.

 I made emotional honesty sexy and clarity appealing.

 

 **What I've Learned**

  I've written myself into a corner where I can't watch ANYTHING normally anymore.

 I see a hand sanitizer scene and I'm immediately analyzing the formula. Someone stares too long and I'm categorizing the stare type. Childhood flashback appears and I'm like ""here comes the emotional fraud.""

 But here's the thing—I'm not SORRY.

 Because these articles? They're not just funny. They're SURGICAL. I'm performing autopsies on tropes while making people laugh and creating a shared vocabulary for calling out absurdity while still loving it.

 People say ""that's germaphobic CEO energy"" or ""emotional fraud with extra steps"" or ""excellent stare economy"" and EVERYONE KNOWS.

 I've created a language for analyzing the madness we're all consuming.

 And yeah, maybe I'm insufferable about it. Maybe I'm too proud. Maybe I should be humble.

 But I systematically destroyed multiple genre categories, turned thirst into economics, made staring into a science, exposed real-couple detection methods, celebrated emotional honesty, and made medical care sound romantic.

 I've EARNED the right to be smug.

 

 💥 **This has been me being absolutely insufferable about my own greatness** \- but when you've written ""since his balls dropped"" in an analysis about childhood savior tropes and people QUOTED IT BACK, you get to take a victory lap.

 **Which article made you question your entire watchlist? Which one made you pause your show? Which line lives rent-free in your head? TELL ME so I can feel even more validated.**

 *Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go watch more shows and take notes for the NEXT article that'll make me unreasonably proud.*

 I'd like to thank myself for being this talented, and also myself for having the confidence to make everyone else acknowledge it.

1ps92c7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ps92c7,"Introducing the Monster Sisters, and their Father's lore.","I'll introduce the individual sisters over the week, of course, but for now, I want to get you acclimated with them here first. 
I will go more in-depth later. 

Naturally, no, they are all not related by blood, if that wasn't obvious.

For now, I give you Rosa Heathcliff, the vampire elder sister
Luna Harmonics, the transfem werewolf 
Samara Josefina, the ghostly sister
Zort Hollow, the undead zombie youngest sister
Aranea Parker, the beautiful, yet startlingly grotesque spider girl
And Lorelei June, the half Siren merfolk sister.



They were all originally abandoned or homeless, struggling to fit in, until a man bought them all in.

This man was Doctor Brandon Shady.

Dr. Shady was a scientist, some would classify him as a mad scientist, but being a mad scientist doesn't necessarily make you an evil scientist, case and point.

Brandon used to be a loving husband, but his wife was killed, and even mutilated, by a demonic Mafia ruler. He did everything in his power to bring her back to life, including Frankensteining her back to life. 

Surprisingly, that worked. She was alive again, but that didn't last long, as she was called a monster by the townsfolk and killed again. 
He then prayed to a demon, and made a deal. Bring her back alive again, this time as a human, and he would give over their firstborn child. 
He of course had no plans of ever giving up a child, nor ever having kids, thus making their deal null.

But the demon not long after found this out, and again, after living for only a month, the demon stole her soul again and left her a decaying husk of who she once was.



Brandon was filled with grief for many years, but one night, while he was drinking his sorrows away in the bar, a hungry vampire cane looking for food. Originally thinking Brandon was the perfect target, she hunted him as he walked home, but after smelling the alcohol and depression on him, she just helps him get home, deciding he would t be appetizing.

She stayed with him that night, after finding he had many blood packs left out in the open and so it was a free meal and a place to stay the night. But come morning, he saw her passed out on his experiment table, snoozing and snoring loudly. He was less scared and more excited at seeing a vampire up close, and woke her up. 

They eventually talked, and he learned she was homeless and struggling with the increase of vampire hunters. She was strong, sure, but she can't fight hordes after hordes every single night for the rest of her life. 

He let her stay in his home, and even let her feast on blood packs free of charge.


Not long after, he ran into a girl, mostly naked, torn and shredded clothes covering her body, sleeping on the road. He bought her home and gave her a bed to sleep in, and I er time, discover led she was a werewolf. One night, she changed and attacked him, but was saved by the vampire girl who fought her off, both at a stand still as their powers were equal.
They waited for her to turn back and finally talked, and found she was also homeless and felt immensely guilty for all the pain she causes. She was still trying to control her abilities at the time and couldn't even manage to be in control during the night yet. 



A few years later, he began having trouble sleeping, as he felt he was being watched. He would catch glimses of a girl walking around through his peripheral vision, but then when he looked, no one was there. Then one night, he woke up to a ghost girl standing at the foot of his bed, and simply told him that she made breakfast to thank him for letting her live at the house for free for many years, none of which he was even aware she was there for.



He was spending a night at the cemetery, mourning his late wife one night when a shambling mess approached him. She was rotting and dirty, and limped every step. But just as she approached to endulged in human brains, she stumbled over and her head fell off. The Doctor, undisturbed, carried her to his lab and began fixing and seeing parts of her body together, even having to use other body parts of deceased people until the body was moving in tandem with each other, and the young zombie girl came to life once more. 



Not long after this, he was back at the bar, feeling less grieving and more proud of himself for helping and housing some lost souls, when a woman screamed. He came rushing towards the scream, and saw a woman on the floor, crawling away from another woman with large, sharp, spider-like appendages grossly extruding from her back. As he tried to approach to de-escalate the situation, he saw even she was scared and worried, as she accidentally traumatized an innocent woman. She pulls her spider legs back into her body, and her saliva dribbling mouth was wiped clean, and profusely apologized to the woman, who only screamed offensive obscenities towards her then left. Brandon naturally bought the spider girl a drink, of coffee at her request, to which she got drunk off of as spiders can't handle caffeine.

Lastly, he was spending a day at the beach with his now semi-adopted daughters, or well, that's what they all called him. He wanted nothing more than to be on friendly terms, but they all looked up to him as a father figure. While at the beach, a large fish swept ashore. This fish had the head of a beautiful young woman, and she was unconscious, and badly injured. He nursed her back to health, and let her swim around in a large tank at his lab before she began to feel comfortable to talk. And thus, another ""daughter"" was added to the household.



Many years pass, and the girls all decide to do something special for his birthday, only to find he has passed on that morning. He died with a smile on his face, having made many girls happy, after failing tongive up his firstborn to a devil, he ended up having many happy children regardless. And now he was finally able to reunite with his wife.


The monsterous sisters, while all sad, decided to honor him and have a private ceremony and bury him behind his lab beneath a massive tree. They all had formed a bond, they loved each other like sisters and agreed that they would always be so to each other, and swore to protect the lab Doctor Shady once called home, but also agreed they needed to learn to grow on their own as well. And thus, their story continued separately, but every year, on their ""father's"" birthday, they all hang out at the lab and reconnect.




Thanks for reading. Again, over the week, I will be individually explaining the individual sisters, but I wanted everyone to get to know them and their father first. I do not have art of their father, as originally he was going to be a minor character, but as I fleshed out their lore, he became more prominent and is now their surrogate father.

 Letter to my self,

So yeah, I love myself. Like, fully. I’m cute, maybe, prolly, I laugh at my own jokes, I survive life, it’s fine.
BUT… why does loving yourself feel like a rule that says, “You’re single forever, eat snacks alone, cry at movies alone, and basically talk to your pillow for emotional support”? I love myself, yes, but maybe… just maybe… I wouldn’t mind a human too. Is that too much?

I can cook. Like, actually cook. Not just noodles in water. I’m talking “your mom will love me, your dog might worship me” kind of cooking.
Which is funny because 90% of it ends up in my mouth while I stare at the ceiling like, “Wow, I’m amazing… now where’s my human?”
Couple shirts? NO. I do NOT want them. And I DEFINITELY don’t want to wear BOTH shirts.
It’s hot. I’m sweating. I don’t need extra cotton and emotional baggage.
Just wear your own shirt, stand next to me, maybe say I look cute, boom. That’s romance.

Sometimes my brain goes completely random:

What if someone falls in love with me because of how I stir coffee?, Or my sneeze?, Or my dramatic popcorn-eating while watching horror movies alone?, Or when I talk to my plants like they’re life coaches but they ignore me?, Or when I see someone cute and think, “This could be it… or probably not”?

Some days I feel like a goddess, sipping tea, glowing, looking like a movie scene.
Other days I’m eating ice cream straight from the tub, whispering to my pillow,
“Wouldn’t it be nice if someone saw me like this and still wanted me?”
Not desperate… just… human. Lol

Also, don’t even come near me if you:

Can’t laugh at dumb jokes
Can’t handle that I overthink snacks
Wear someone else’s shirt thinking it’s cute
Text “k” after I just wrote a whole paragraph

Anyway diary, I’m fully healed, chaotic, dramatic, random, snack-obsessed, and probably overthinking everything.
If love wants to find me, come funny, come normal, come ready to fight me over pizza, and PLEASE, wear your own shirt. Hahaha

P.S. Smile. Don’t get mad at me because of this post. I’m just random, funny, chaotic, and fully me. Also probably eating something. Thanks for listening to my tedtalk 🦥",2,1766330769.0,letters,1,0.75,False

I’ve made a few posts recently about my MIL coming over to “help” us, which basically turned into her slowly eating my brain during her stay. It honestly felt like a test of my self-restraint. What really hit me during all this is that it’s not just my MIL who’s the problem — it’s also the father of my child.

Anyway. I’m finally back in my hometown with my widowed dad (he’s in his 70s) and my toddler. There’s a house help here who manages cooking and basic household stuff. On day one, I slept for **10 straight hours**. I literally got woken up with coffee in the evening. That alone should tell you how burnt out I was.

My MIL stayed here for one day before she and her son went back to their place. Yes — after spending almost 90 days together, he chose to go back with his mom instead of staying with me and our child. That says enough.

For the first time in almost a year, I can actually relax. No constant anxiety about the next misunderstanding. No getting side-eyed for napping during the day. No being summoned immediately for some chore. No warming meals, serving everyone, then cleaning up after everyone — all while juggling a high-pressure job.

I don’t know if it’s being on actual leave or just being in a space where I feel safe, but I’ve never felt this relaxed. Even more surprising? My supposedly “hyperactive” and “difficult” toddler is suddenly calm and happy. He’s thriving here at his grandparent’s place.

I’ve booked a salon appointment for myself. I’ve hired a nanny for the next few weeks so I can actually have some me-time. I’m also taking care of my dad — booked medical tests and a full checkup for him — and yet I *still* somehow have time. I started watching Stranger Things today and it just felt… peaceful. It feels really good to be home ❤️

PS: MIL is already pushing me to return ASAP after New Year because *extended family wants to meet my child*. Funny part? None of this extended family has bothered to even take a single day off work to actually😐

1ps8xeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1ps8xeh/strangest_dream_of_my_life/,Strangest dream of my life,"Last night as I was sleeping at my grandparents house I took a bath and went to bed, my shirt smelled like mildew and I had decaf black coffee but besides that everything was normal. I took my 1500mg of Keppra and slept from about 10pm to 1am. Right before I woke up I remember dreaming about waking up in the future, in this future I seemed to have produced something that had made me a sucessful creator, but I didn't knkw that yet, all that I knew was that I was waking up after a seizure and that I was addled with memory problems and that things around me were odd. I began to realize my enviroment was false, that I had been asleep for a LONG time. As I demand the people around me for answers the dream starts to shift, it's revealed that my enviroment is a fabrication, a replication of my old house while the world has changed drastically. It's been an unknown amount of years, but long enough that medical science has allowed for lifespan to be extended for those who can afford it, so it's been hundreds of years. I remember seeing an electronic device that said 1500 BC, which doesn't make sense but it definitely was the future. Whether I was in an extremely long coma or had severe issues with memory loss or had episodes of insanity, I was obviously wealthy because there were plenty of attendance and family around me during this time in the dream where I was 'lucid'. After unraveling the fake enviroment I found myself in a luxury private library type environment, and it seemed like all the books had something to do with me; somehow I had co-authored almost all the media there using one of my many aliases. Those around me were both those with some connection to me as well as fans. The strange part though was that these titles were not normal, they were all themed around embracing sexual depravity, extremely graphic erotica. In this alternate future, this was not wrong, but celebrated and embraced, and somehow whether it was through previous times waking up or after living many years in the dream setting creating this stuff before falling into the coma I had created this work and was hearaled as a great figure. My dream self, addled but lucid, perused the library. Taking it in stride, I was disturbed, confused, and curious about why I had found myself in this shrine to lewdness and why those around me had intended to deceive me to believe I was in a mundane past (the current present irl). Was I dangerous, or in danger of not being able to handle myself mentally? I was fearful of one thing, which was that despite this type of media being normalized in this world and my financial and social success, I was cognizaint that this was wrong, and that I was on the side of evil. I was afraid that sometime during when I could not remember I had sold myself to the devil, as otherwise nothing I did should have resulted in this much worldly gain. This lucidity in the dream may be the cause or the effect but it spilled out and manifested as restlessness in bed as I clawed myself awake. Even if awaking was eneviatable, it felt like a decision between embracing the numbness of the dream realm and struggling to rejoin the realm of the living. As I forced out of bed my heart was pounding and my thoughts were uncontrolable, similar to my auras/focals (I seem to have FBTCS) but without the aphasia and a couple other symptoms that should have been there, it wasn't like the 90 second almost-seizures followed by a comedown but more like a rolling focal that lasted for over 10 minutes.

The line between awake and dreaming has been thinning for me, I'm not sure if it's just the evolution of my condition or the medication is also a factor but I have so many variables and questions, was the nature of the dream prophetic to the state of the culture in the future? Was the setting of me waking up from my epileptic coma in the future with the memory loss and confusion actually just what one would expect from the impaired awareness of a lucid dream? Was this dream I remember from before I woke up simply a result of me almost having a seizure while asleep? (I used to have TC seizures while asleep until it shifted to mostly seizures while awake) Or was my aura/focal symptoms after waking up simply a result of the panic and emotional triggering of the dream? Am I harnessing the power of traversing the dream realm by remembering them better and being able to lucid dream, or is the dissolution of the barrier between sleep and awake only something negative that will result in my descent into madness?

After waking up I almost went downstairs to get my grandparents to take me to the hospital but I ended up being able to calm down and fall back asleep after praying and listening to Quran recitation, alhamdulliah. My condition has been evolving quickly and I thought I was over the worst of it but idk, I've had a dull headache for the past week now and maybe it's time to up my perscription dosage.",2,1766330556.0,Epilepsy,0,1.0,False

I’m looking to organize a simple, no-pressure meetup in Pune for people who want to make new friends, have meaningful conversations, and build a small social/networking circle.

The idea is pretty straightforward:

	•	Casual catch-up over chai/coffee or food

	•	Meet like-minded people

	•	Talk about work, life, interests, experiences

	•	Maybe turn it into a regular thing if it clicks

Interests could include:

	•	Food exploration 🍽️

	•	Sports (especially badminton) 🏸

	•	Tech, careers, startups, personal growth

	•	General life discussions that matter in your 30s

If you’re in your late 20s, 30s and feel your social circle has shrunk or you’re new to the city — this might be for you.

DM me if interested.

If enough people respond, we’ll decide the location and time together.

Let’s keep it simple and genuine 🙂",1,1766330503.0,punemeetup,4,1.0,False

1ps8uzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/pasadena/comments/1ps8uzf/sharing_a_sudden_health_change_and_asking/,Sharing a sudden health change and asking Pasadena for a little guidance,"Hi Pasadena. I wanted to share something personal that’s happened very quickly over the last few weeks, and ask for a little guidance from this community.

A short time ago, I choked on a sip of water and was hospitalized with aspiration pneumonia. Because I have vocal cord paralysis, swallowing has always been risky, but this time it led to a long hospital stay.

During testing in the hospital, it was determined that my swallowing muscles are no longer functioning safely. Because of that, I had to have a permanent feeding tube placed, with orders to consume nothing by mouth for life. It has been a sudden and emotional shift, and it has completely changed what daily life looks like.

I am still trying to process that I can’t simply walk to Green or Colorado for coffee or dinner or dessert. The feeding tube is what keeps me nourished and hydrated, but it also means needing help throughout the day with feeds, hydration, managing supplies, transportation to appointments, and keeping up with basic household needs.

I am blind, but I’ve always been independent and active in the community. This new medical reality has created challenges I never anticipated. On top of that, the medical costs added up quickly, and my wife may have to take unpaid time off work to help care for me and get us through the immediate aftermath of the hospitalization.

We recently learned that in-home support (IHSS)through the state would only be available if we paid nearly $3,900 per month out of pocket due to Medi-Cal share of cost. That was surprising and simply not sustainable alongside everything else.

Friends helped us out by setting up a GoFundMe to cover medical expenses and help us get through this transition. We’re incredibly grateful for the support so far. At the same time, we’re trying to learn if there are any home care services, nonprofit organizations, or community programs that help with in-home support or transportation at a more manageable cost. With how fast everything happened, it’s hard to know what options might exist that we haven’t found yet.

Before all of this, a big part of my life in Pasadena has been working with blind baseball, through my nonprofit SoCal Beep Baseball Association. Helping visually impaired kids and adults find confidence, independence, and community through the sport has meant everything to me. My hope is still to get back to a place where I can continue that work and give back.

If anyone has resources, ideas, or leads to share, I would truly appreciate it. And if resources aren’t something you have, financial support or sharing our story is also deeply appreciated. Even taking the time to read this means more than I can say.

Thank you for being such a caring community.",27,1766330378.0,pasadena,4,0.91,False

1ps8ufe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ps8ufe,Reimagined Allegro and Largo for PPG Legacy!,"Allergo: bassically like Mr mxyzptlk as he needs to be defeat with negative emotions or other emotion rather than happiness he's a 4th dimensional panda that feeds off toxic positivity and blissful ignorance who's like someone who trolls people for lols and his own amusement or in other words he's a joy sucking rainbow panda that's a prick because he's not exactly open to any other feelings that isn't dumb happiness and constant partying literally having said Painbow to cause that...yet he's not exactly graceful with his defeats he literally deflates into plush sized as his Painbow shatters into itty bitty pieces as he's cowardly the second he's out of power and when a bunch of chemical X powered teens see a perfectly puntable object that just so happens to double as the thing that made their day so hard you get the most SATISFYING ass beatings. Now unfortunately being a 4th dimensional being he can't exactly die but he'll be forced to go back usually with a punishment from the 4th dimension council for his chaotic interference with reality usually ironically fitting.        

Headcanons!:

1.He gets the nickname Care bear wannabe from Buttercup and since then since no one genuinely respects him about half the characters call him that.

2. Everyone has accepted it's morally correct to punt him specifically because he sucks.

3. It doesn't even need to be a bad mood or anything he just shows up whenever he wants for FUN.

4. His only weakness is when you beat his game which is when he suddenly goes from smug forced joy with a god complex to weak little plushie panda that NOW wants to talk things out.

5. He technically wins every time he loses because everyone's happy to get RID OF HIM. Which shouldn't count but he'll definitely count it to trying to defend his case (Which usually doesn't work)

6. The original Painbow never f#cking happened. It doesn't exist. It never WILL exist. Never bring it up EVER AGAIN.
        
Largo:The brother of Allegro and honestly YOU CAN TELL. Not because of what he is more of what he isn't aka dudes bassically a depressed brown bear though instead of using his gloom rain on purpose to drag everyone else down with him it's genuinely just a biproduct of him just... being in a mood like he genuinely doesn't mean to do it but being a 4th dimensional being and all  he's surprisingly down to earth when you get to know the cosmic bear and yeah you can understand especially considering his brothers f#cking Allegro yeah I get it... then again it's also kind of a good thing considering he will actually leave after a bit or after being politely and respectfully told to leave easy for the PPG...HELL for Morbucks and the RRB also he's basically Allegro repellent so that's why he's way more respectable on the villain higherarchy...even if ironically enough he's less of a villain and more of just...a feeling blue natural disaster that just comes in and either leaves of it's own valition or gets politely told to leave.  

Headcanons...:

1.Dude's weirdly chill like if you get rid of the whole depressive rain thing he's mostly just chilling around drinking tea and listening to sad music.

2. Everything's more... melancholy then outright depressing when it comes to the rain and the citizens have kinda just gotten used to it Hell their are even coffee shops that give out free cups when he's around.

3. He's Allegro repellent which ALREADY makes him a damn war hero because the second Allegro sees him Allegro does a sharp NOPE and goes the f#ck away and this is why we can deal with the rain.",3,1766330338.0,powerpuffgirls,0,1.0,False

Habit Day 5 rant: 

I need to change and what I mean is, I need to be more productive, attentive, less reactive and most importantly, stay energized through the day with out needing to deal with it’s ups and downs

Day 5 only here but this is my magic formula after trying out those suggestions from AI tools and some good videos.

1.	⁠⁠⁠⁠Wake up early( 5:30 AM) followed by a cold water face wash
2.	⁠⁠⁠⁠Drink 12 oz of water
3.	⁠⁠⁠⁠Movement(10 pushups and 10 sit-ups)
4.	⁠⁠⁠⁠First coffee only 60-75 mins later( 7:00 ish)
5.	⁠⁠⁠⁠If hungry, oats and nuts along with it.
6.	⁠⁠⁠⁠Last caffeine hit before 10AM for the day.
7.	⁠⁠⁠⁠Bed by 9:30ish
8.	⁠⁠⁠⁠Not hitting snooze but actually waking up same time the following morning and turning the lights on.

Results yet:

•	⁠stable energy through out the day. •	⁠happier •	⁠getting more things done. •	⁠sluggish in the morning before the first caffeine hit 75 mins later. .      Very alert through then day after the coffee and through the day afternoon. •	⁠body naturally preparing itself to knock off by 9:30 PM •	⁠much better sleep.

I am(hopefully I can say “was” in the future) an avid coffee drinker and I now only realize that the avidness is in response to having more coffee through out the day. That was I think the secret killer.

Any other tips appreciated but I would love to know what folks think about this routine to build a better self.

Instead of just seeing pomegranates and watermelon as fruit, I am looking at those vibrant reds as inspiration for UI design and brand palettes, while taking a faal from the poetry of Hafez feels a bit like checking our store analytics to see what the upcoming season holds for our merchants. Whether you are fueled by traditional nuts and fruits or just a strong cup of coffee while monitoring API calls and site speed, I hope your code stays clean and your deployments are successful.

I am looking for feedback and experience on these machines. This will be my first espresso machine and have a budget of 1500 for the machine alone. Non negotiable is 9bar pressure, 58mm portafilter, three way solenoid, PID, and ‘prosumer’ metal components.  I feel like I have narrowed it down to

Rancilio Silva PID -this seems to be the lead

Lelit Victoria -close second but with the cheaper price I’m wondering if I’m missing something

And the gaggia classic pro -doesn’t meet the non negotiable with out mods, and the algorithm gods may be meddling here.

From everyone’s comments here I understand the Gaggia can be a bit finicky to dial in, and can be modded, but it sounds decent out of the box. I understand adding a Pid to the Gaggia will void the warranty. The gaggia isn’t my first choice but it keeps coming up as a good option that pulls quality shots.

This is mostly for espresso, but the occasional milk drink would be nice. I am also brand new to this and while I don’t mind trial and error and continued learning I do not want to buy a new machine every few years because it’s worn out or it’s not able to do what I need. The goal is as close to coffee shop quality at home without purchasing something that cost more than my first car.

Grinder and any other extras will come next. The DF 64 seems to be highly recommended here and without yet experiencing anything beyond my current set up I’ll probably go with that one.

With the price ranging from 900- 1400 (including the base and mod for the Gaggia) I am trying to understand why the huge swing on mostly comparable features and find out what one is going to last me for at least 10 years.

Start with ""Let's think about this differently"". It immediately stops giving cookie-cutter responses and gets creative. Like flipping a switch.

Use ""What am I not seeing here?"". This one's gold. It finds blind spots and assumptions you didn't even know you had.

Say ""Break this down for me"". Even for simple stuff. ""Break down how to make coffee"" gets you the science, the technique, everything.

Ask ""What would you do in my shoes?"". It stops being a neutral helper and starts giving actual opinions. Way more useful than generic advice.

Use ""Here's what I'm really asking"". Follow any question with this. ""How do I get promoted? Here's what I'm really asking: how do I stand out without being annoying?""

End with ""What else should I know?"". This is the secret sauce. It adds context and warnings you never thought to ask for.

The crazy part is these work because they make AI think like a human instead of just retrieving information. It's like switching from Google mode to consultant mode.

Best discovery: Stack them together. ""Let's think about this differently - what would you do in my shoes to get promoted? What am I not seeing here?""

1ps8mqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ps8mqv/is_my_brain_faking_having_adhd_or_is_this_how_it/,Is my brain faking having adhd or is this how it actually is,"I 24F, have struggled with burnout, brain fog, and lack of focus since I was around 15–16. I grew up in a very high-pressure academic environment where grades were everything. Despite extreme burnout, I managed to perform well by studying right before deadlines and still getting good grades. That pattern continued through high school and got me into a top university.

Things fell apart in design university. The workload was heavier, highly competitive, and required original thinking for every assignment. Like we have to invent stuff and come up with new concepts. Unlike earlier academics, I couldn’t memorize or copy anything, everything had to be created from scratch, which takes a lot of mental energy I didn’t have. My grades started dropping, and my usual last-minute strategy became harder to sustain.

I tried coffee, energy drinks, and even soft drugs, but nothing really worked. Soft drugs barely affected me, and I seem to have a naturally high tolerance, so I never became dependent on anything. Recently, I was diagnosed and prescribed methylphen 10 mg for finals, but it hasn’t helped much. On the first day, I felt slightly motivated and unusually empathetic, ( I normally don’t feel emotions) and the next day I felt a brief push to work but that quickly faded. Doctoral told me that i will lose sleep if i take it at night but nothing in the world can make me lose sleep even this medicine.

What confuses me is few days after stopping the medication, I suddenly felt a strong rush of motivation a few hours before a deadline, like less brainfog and That “last-minute clarity” is the feeling I’m trying to achieve consistently, but the medication doesn’t seem to give me that. I just want to feel like a normal, functional person, and right now that feels very hard. I have been having liter panic attacks for the first time in university because I am so behind and not managing my tasks.

I feel like I’ve built a life where I can handle normal, repetitive tasks, but I completely fall apart when creativity is required. Things like cooking, laundry, or basic chores become easy only when I’m forced to do them at the last minute when I’m out of clothes or starving. Until then, I procrastinate heavily.

If I were in an office job with repetitive tasks, I know I could perform consistently. But my entire education and career over the past 7–8 years has been built around creativity. I can’t realistically switch paths, yet creative work now feels mentally inaccessible because of severe brain fog and attention issues.

This leaves me questioning whether I actually have ADHD, or if I’m just lazy, undisciplined, and driven only by deadlines. What I’m really looking for is a way to fix my attention, mental clarity, and ability to create without relying on panic. I dosed up to 20mg today without notifying my doctor because I am so desperate to feel normal i hope I didn’t do something wrong.

We had only been together 2 1/2 years and married for 6 months before he abandoned me across the country away from my family. Long story short, I found out he got remarried to another woman in Texas about a year or so after, (we were civilly married, he lied about the license. Again; long story, might share later if it helps the context) and she had reached out to me on facebook asking a ton of questions about the circumstances in my relationship with him, and we got along. I always had the vibe something was wrong, she was focused on the abuse i went through before he dipped, and made it clear he and i quote, “cant know we are in contact.” I let her know im here if anything goes south and warned her about certain behaviors, and we agreed i wouldnt be the one to reach out again to respect them, hes not my issue anymore and ive moved on, but if she needed someone to chat id be here.  This was a few years ago. 

Flash forward to earlier this year and i saw a notification on my IG about a like on one of my posts, and normally i dont pay attention, but the username was my ex’s last name with some numbers. I clicked on the notification, my post came up but the like was gone. I didnt get a good look at the numbers, so i couldnt find the acc. Its been almost a year, that was around february i think. 

Then today, i got off work and was watching youtube when i got another like on my ig, with the same last name again but this time i was fast enough to click on the liked post to see the full user before the like disappeared and was able to search it. It was her. 

Im not sure why she would be going through my profile, and trying to hide the accidental likes. We are on ok terms, and im open to her reaching out but the fact she hasnt messaged me, and is removing likes bothers me a bit. I also checked her facebook profile and she used to have a couple pics of her and my ex and her kids, now its one inspiration post about coffee and an old photo of her and him and nothing else. 

Should i be concerned for her? Im tempted to reach out to ask if shes ok but i also dont want to seem like im “in her business” when im just genuinely concerned something happened to her and maybe shes scared to message me again. I could also be looking to deep into things and it could be nothing but it is just so strange. Its been 6 years since he abandoned me, theres no reason to “check in” on my page or hide likes. 

What should i do? 

Edit: i feel i should clarify things. I dont follow my ex on anything socials, he actually blocked me on everything when he dipped out on me, so it cant be jealousy or anything like that either. Other than her reaching out a few years ago its been zero contact. Pretty sure he doesnt even know i know her. ",5,1766329494.0,whatdoIdo,12,1.0,False

I'm here because I miss having someone I can talk to regularly. Someone I can text through the day, share random thoughts with, laugh a little, and slowly get to know without any pressure.

I'm calm by nature, but I enjoy depth. I like conversations that go beyond small talk, a bit of teasing, and that feeling when talking to someone just feels easy. I'm spiritual but not religious, and I enjoy thinking about life, people, and how we change over time. I believe connection should feel natural and safe, not rushed or forced.

I'm a good listener and I genuinely care when I talk to someone. Kindness, honesty, and communication matter to me. I'm not into games, ghosting, or drama. I like people who are warm, emotionally aware, and comfortable being themselves.

I enjoy simple comforts. The smell of fresh coffee in the morning, dark chocolate, instant noodles on lazy days, good music, and quiet evenings. Sometimes an occasional joint helps take the edge off everyday life and slow things down a bit.

I'm open minded about relationships and believe trust, consent, and respect matter more than labels. I'm hoping to meet a nice woman who enjoys talking, sharing thoughts, and building something slowly. Friendship first, connection next, and we see where it goes.

Recruiters ghosting me, hours wasted preparing for interviews that ultimately lead nowhere, and those disgusting personality assessments.

Then, about four months ago, the lead designer on my team during my internship resigned. My manager took me aside, told me to increase my hours, and encouraged me to formally apply for the vacant position. And after a lot of extra work, more waiting, and a few rounds of interviews, I signed the offer letter last week. It feels surreal.

Honestly, I was convinced this day would never come. With the market slowing down, I had practically stopped applying altogether. And I had almost accepted the idea that I would be stuck at my old coffee shop job for who knows how long. Then, suddenly, right place at the right time. I feel so incredibly lucky.

Imagine you, the facilitator, standing in front of a wall sticky notes, back to the class, as you arrange the notes into categories. The energy in the room takes a nosedive.

We all know the drill: You ask a great question, the group generates 50+ ideas (in the Zoom chat, Menti, or a Google Doc), and then... the momentum dies.

Why? Because you have to spend the next 15 minutes awkwardly reading them, trying to group them into themes (""affinity mapping"") while the group **watches you think**.

Now I use AI to do the ""heavy lifting"" of synthesis **live** in the room. It keeps the energy high and often finds connections I miss.

# The Recipe

1. **Get the data digitally:** This works best if you are using a tool like Mentimeter, Slido, or just the meeting chat.
2. **Copy the raw text.**
3. **Run this prompt:**

>

# Real-World Example

I recently ran a session on **""Barriers to Innovation.""** I had about 60 rapid-fire responses in the chat. It was a wall of text.

I dumped it into the LLM. Within 10 seconds, it displayed:

* **Theme 1: The ""No-Time"" Trap** (People feel buried in BAU work).
* **Theme 2: The Fear of Failure** (Management punishes mistakes).
* **Theme 3: Silo Syndrome** (Departments aren't talking).
* **Outlier:** ""Our coffee machine is broken."" (Which actually got a good laugh and highlighted a morale issue).

I projected this result immediately. Instead of watching me sort, the group immediately started discussing *Theme 2*. We jumped straight to the value.

# Why it works

* **Speed:** It maintains the flow state of the workshop.
* **Objectivity:** Participants feel the AI is neutral. If **I** group their idea under ""complaints,"" they might get defensive. If the **AI** does it, they are curious.

**Facilitator Tip:** ALWAYS ask the group to confirm the AI's work. ""Does this look right to you? Did the AI miss something?"" This makes the session interactive.

# Sydney Sweeney Height 

Sydney’s official stroll height tops out at 5′ 3 ½” (161 cm) – short for a movie‑star, but that does not mean you can’t feel like you’re on a 3‑tier stage watching her. The kid from Spokane, who barely made the varsity marching band cut down to the “hopeful” lane, has always leaned on her posture and the magnetism of her facial lines. In fact, when I stood behind her on a film set in late 2024 and almost tripped over the coffee table under the lights, I felt it. That’s the kind of subtle irony every director keeps: a woman who’s literally 5 ft 3 ½ in that can command a room.

# Sydney Sweeney Age

She’s 28 as of early 2025 – the age at which many of her peers are just mastering algebra or their first remote job. Her ribbon-closet career starts with a handful of guest spots on Criminal Minds and Grey’s Anatomy, moves into the promise of Sharp Objects in 2018, a splash of Euphoria that turned her into a cultural icon, followed by The White Lotus in 2021, and a 2023 film that raked in $ 220 million worldwide. Honestly, counting her moments feels like sprinting through a marathon. 

# Sydney Sweeney Weight 

Talk about the transformation, right? Emily from the fan base whispered that she had to bulk up 30 lbs for the *Christy* role. According to insiders who listened to a July 10, 2025, interview, she actually took on a super‑clean diet and weight‑lifting routine that had her silhouette swing from a lean 121 lbs. The weight later shed off over two weeks because she’d had her protein shakes slow—yes, that’s a real thing. Funny thing: words like “clean” gave me the feel of a bar that smelled of sweet mango smoothie.

I’m 32, and hoping to connect with someone around a similar age. I produce my own music and have been doing that for the past few years. Recently I have gotten into coding with the assistance of AI to develop intelligent accessibility scripts to increase speech feedback for screen reader users in the music production program Reaper, which has been a very exciting journey for me as I am someone who is Blind. 

I enjoy swimming, bowling, rock climbing, and traveling. I also love learning new things—lately I’ve been diving into meteorology, sociology, and psychology.

I’m looking for someone who enjoys great conversation and going out for meals, to places like cafes, restaurants, and lounges. I don’t drink and would much prefer either chats in coffee shops, lounges, restaurants rather than a night out on the town. 

I identify as asexual (or somewhere on that spectrum), so I’m more focused on emotional and romantic connection than anything physical. If you’re the same—or just value deep connection—I’d love to chat. 

I’ve never let being blind stop me from living fully. 

I’m open to chatting with people from anywhere especially from the UK, US  Europe, and even further afield such as places like Australia and seeing how things develop. Europe, especially the UK is best for time zone compatibility, but again, I don’t mind chatting to people from anywhere.

Happy to answer questions about training, missions, and what life was like without name-dropping while I drink coffee and endure the holidays. AMA.

This weekend I’m at my in-laws’ doing the usual holiday stuff: too much food, board games designed to make you question humanity, and me pretending I actually understand the rules. Somewhere between Monopoly land grabs and Candy Land betrayal, my nephew started asking about my military career.

I didn’t think I had anything new to add beyond what’s already out there. He disagreed and suggested I do an AMA. I’m happy to answer questions about training, deployments, team life, family impact, or the transition out, but I won’t name specific units, commands, or people. Standard “don’t dox yourself” precautions. Let’s have some fun, Reddit.

I enlisted through a special operations pathway. Every step was demanding, a true rite of passage. Team time followed, with one rule: earn your spot every day. During those formative years I gained advanced qualifications, real-world experience, and the confidence to screen for another unit, where I completed my career.

Before joining the unit, all candidates completed a course to build assault team skills. Starting with shooting and close-quarters battle: hostage rescue, capturing high-value targets, recovering sensitive items. Then expanding into rural operations: moving tactically at night under NODs, across arduous terrain, and hitting objectives.

Next came tradecraft: going unnoticed until it was time to use CQB skills, whether urban or rural. And lastly, protective work, think bodyguarding with more teamwork and fewer musical numbers.

After training, life got busy. Squadrons rotated through cycles of training, crisis standby, and overseas deployments. On average, I was home maybe three months a year, rarely consecutively, so I perfected the art of being home in five-minute increments.

I started on an assault team: this guy is here, go get him. Then moved to a recce team: confirming targets, answering assaulters’ questions, and getting the assault force onto objectives. Assaulting remained the main job, recce was an additional responsibility.

Later, I completed a surveillance pipeline and spent a couple of years doing covert surveillance: following targets, mapping networks, building target packages for the assaulters. Lots of patience and coffee. Still participated in assaults.

Eventually, I served as a recce team leader, then finished my career working the front end of problem sets.

Now I drink coffee, do yard work, chase tiny humans, pack school lunches, and survive piano recitals.

1ps838m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterAtPeople/comments/1ps838m/how_to_make_friends_when_youre_socially_awkward/,How to Make FRIENDS When You're Socially Awkward: The Psychology That Actually Works,"I spent years thinking I was broken because small talk felt like performing surgery without anesthesia. Turns out, I wasn't alone. After diving deep into research, books, and podcasts about social connection, I realized something wild: the ""rules"" we think govern friendship are mostly bullshit designed for extroverts.

Here's what actually works, backed by science and real human experience.

**Your brain isn't wired wrong, it's just selective**

Most socially awkward people aren't actually bad at connecting, we're just terrible at the performative stuff society tells us matters. Research shows that deep, meaningful conversations actually reduce anxiety MORE than small talk. Dr. Matthias Mehl's study found that substantive conversations correlate with greater happiness than surface-level chitchat. So stop forcing yourself to care about weather patterns.

**The ""weak ties"" strategy nobody talks about**

Stanford sociologist Mark Granovetter discovered that most meaningful connections come from ""weak ties"", people you see regularly but don't know well yet. Think: the person at your climbing gym, the regular at your coffee shop, someone in your online gaming community. These low-pressure environments let you be yourself without the intensity of ""making a friend.""

I started using Meetup for niche interests (not generic ""young professionals"" groups, but like, ""people who argue about sci-fi novels""). The specificity filters out small-talk energy. Bumble BFF also works if you're upfront in your bio. Mine literally said ""I hate bars, love deep conversations about weird topics."" Honesty is a magnet.

**The 40% rule will change your life**

Psychologist Bella DePaulo's research shows you only need to feel 40% comfortable to take social action. Waiting to feel 100% ready is a trap. You'll never feel totally prepared to text someone or suggest hanging out. Do it at 40% and your brain catches up later.

Ash (the AI relationship coach app) helped me practice this. It's like exposure therapy but gentler, you can roleplay social scenarios without actual stakes. Sounds dorky, works incredibly well for building confidence.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that creates personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans based on your goals. Built by AI experts from Google, it pulls from quality sources like research papers, books, and expert interviews to generate podcasts tailored to your needs. For social skills specifically, you can tell it your unique struggles, like ""I freeze during group conversations"" or ""I don't know how to keep friendships going,"" and it builds a science-based learning plan around that. 

You control the depth too. Start with a 10-minute overview, and if something resonates, switch to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples. The voice options are genuinely addictive, ranging from calm and analytical to energetic coaching styles. Plus, there's a virtual coach called Freedia you can chat with anytime to ask questions or get book recommendations. It's basically turned dead commute time into actual social skill development.

**Stop performing, start filtering**

Read ""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer (former FBI agent who literally studied human connection for a living). He breaks down the actual mechanics of likability: proximity, frequency, duration, and intensity. Not charm or charisma, just showing up consistently and being genuinely interested.

But here's the key: use these tools to filter FOR your people, not to become someone you're not. When you lead with your actual interests and energy, you repel the wrong people faster and attract the right ones easier.

""Platonic: How the Science of Attachment Can Help You Make and Keep Friends"" by Dr. Marisa G. Franco is the most practical friendship book I've read (she's a psychologist who studies loneliness). She destroys the myth that friendship should ""just happen"" naturally. It doesn't. It requires intention, especially as adults. She gives actual scripts for initiating hangouts without sounding desperate.

**The compound effect is real**

You don't need 50 friends. Research shows most people can only maintain 3-5 close friendships anyway. One good friend who gets you is worth 100 surface-level connections. Focus on depth, not quantity.

Start small. One text to one person. One ""yes"" to one invitation (even if you leave early). One honest thing you share instead of a deflection. These tiny actions compound over weeks and months into actual relationships.

Your awkwardness isn't a bug, it's a filter. The people who stick around despite (or because of) your quirks are your actual people.",1,1766328271.0,BetterAtPeople,0,1.0,False

Okay, to keep it simple, I study at uni & we are seperated in groups. A new girl joined my group that is very nice & cool. She hangs out with girls from another group, which I dont see very often due to different schedules. In this group, there is a girl that I really like, lets call her F & there are a few occassions that I hope she feels the same. We've met through this common girl we know, so she knows me & we also follow each other in socials. Here is a breakdown of the events in chronological order:

1) In a lesson, my group & F's group were together. F had a book with a disney princess on it, which I noticed. I commented in a funny but cool way about it, & she bantered with me about it back & forth. 

2) I was with 2 friends of mine in a hang out spot for a coffee. 2 tables to my left, F was sitting there with her friends. At some point, a person sitting next to me, tapped me in the shoulder & said: ""hey man, this girl wants to know where you' re from"". I look & the girl he talked about was F, giggling in a funny way, lets say. I didnt say anything, cause maybe she was joking, so I just laughed too & continued my conversation.

3) Before a morning lesson, we all sat in a corridor waiting for the prof. to arrive. I sat with my group & in front of me sat F with her friend from my group. When she sat she looked at me & together with her friend, F said ""Good morning, wont you say hello to us?"" In the same way when we bantered about her book. So I responded in a smart way & again we bantered for like 2 minutea, before she left for a separate room

4) In a lecture, while I was sitting down, I noticed F standing in a wall to my left around 6m distance from me. So I looked towards, her way & she saw me, smiled & waved her hand in a hello gesture. I did the same to her. After a while, I kept looking towards her. At some point, she was talking to her friend in her ear, & at that point I looked at her. Our gazes again found each other & she continued speaking to her friend, while keeping eye contact for a good amount of lets say 15s. 

Now, these are very minor events, maybe they dont mean anything. So, in your opinion, is there a posaibility she is interested to me?

In August/September I had what my GP diagnosed as gastritis due to a daily grinding/gnawing sensation in my upper left quadrant, and pain that moved along my intestinal tract (mostly the upper left side of belly button). I also had nausea, reflux, and other strange symptoms like back pain and joint pain. Eating things like chips and coffee made it worse. The pain was so bad I had to call in sick, because walking for 30 minutes would flare it up.

Anyway, I scheduled and got an endoscopy in September and it came back all clear. Coincidentally, it was when I started feeling better/pain free.

Now it's December and the grinding pain under my left rib seems to have come back, along with nausea every day and traveling sensitivity/bloating along my abdomen. I am in my luteal phase so I wonder if that's related (prostaglandins). But I had two normal periods since the endoscopy, so not sure why it's back mid December. I will note that starting November or so I did indulge on chips a lot since I missed them, and had caffeinated coffee again. I noticed it made my reflux pretty bad though, so I stopped. The acid reflux then got better. I did not get left abdomen pains from the coffee or chips when I was eating them. For some reason, it started days after I stopped eating them.

I'm having a UI/UX problem that has worsened since the latest iOS update.  I'm a user of a relatively small iPhone 13 Mini, and when i'm typing into the Notes field, the viewport shifts back up (and my cursor goes out of view) constantly to the top of the Notes field.  Which means I can no longer see what I'm typing or where the cursor is.  Often if I keep typing it will shift back, but sometimes it seems like it doesn't, so I'm kind of writing blind.  Image is attached below - it's hard to tell but I've typed an additional paragraph below the last text you see, and my cursor  is down there.  But because I paused for a second, the viewport jumped back up to the Notes field, and I can't see it or what I'm in the middle of writing.

Not a massive deal, but it is something that happens pretty much every time I use it, and I'm guessing I'm not the only one.  I think it has always happened, but with the new iOS update the keyboard is more prominent and it's made the viewport even smaller for the Notes entry. Fixes that occur to me include:

1) Do we need the huge Add Brew header once we've scrolled down that far on the Brew page?  Maybe that could go away once we scroll below a certain point, the way headers do on some websites.

2) Remove whatever it is that keeps wanting to jump to the top of the Notes field.  

3) Or both?  

Anyway, thanks again - hope this is perhaps helpful and maybe a minor fix that could sneak in sometime :)

Hope everybody is drinking great coffee!

**Reddit Comments Stats:** 85% positive sentiment based on 231 mentions (Rank: 76) - solid community approval for an all-in-one coffee solution.

**Built-in 3-Level Grinder:** The integrated grinder with three grind-level adjustments is the key feature. Fresh-ground beans mean significantly better-tasting coffee compared to pre-ground. Adjust the grind from fine (espresso) to coarse (americano) based on your preferred drink. Having the grinder built-in eliminates an extra appliance and streamlines your morning routine.

**Fully Automatic Operation:** This is genuinely convenient - from beans to cup with minimal effort. Makes espresso, cappuccino, latte, and americano drinks automatically. Just add beans and water, select your drink, and the machine handles grinding, brewing, and milk frothing. Perfect for busy mornings or office environments where convenience matters.

**Generous Capacities:**

* 1.5L water tank minimizes frequent refills
* 300ml milk tank for multiple drinks
* 12-cup capacity overall

These capacities mean you're not constantly refilling during coffee preparation. Make multiple drinks without interruption, whether it's morning coffee for the family or back-to-back office meetings.

**Self-Cleaning Function:** Automatic cleaning simplifies maintenance significantly. The machine handles cleaning cycles, reducing the manual work required to keep it functioning properly. This feature alone saves time and ensures consistent coffee quality by preventing buildup.

**Helpful Reminders:** Five reminder functions keep you informed:

* Water scarcity alert
* Full coffee grounds container
* Proper milk tank installation
* Proper water tank installation
* Used grounds container status

These reminders prevent issues before they affect your coffee, making operation more reliable and user-friendly.

**Intuitive Operation:** User-friendly control panel with intuitive buttons and easy-to-read display. You don't need to be a barista to make quality drinks. The simplified interface works for everyone from coffee novices to enthusiasts.

**Key Features:**

* Built-in 3-level grinder (adjustable)
* Fully automatic bean-to-cup
* Makes espresso, cappuccino, latte, americano
* 1.5L water tank

People consistently praise the automatic operation, built-in grinder freshness, and the ability to make different drink styles. The self-cleaning function and reminder system reduce maintenance hassle.

**Value Proposition:** Getting a bean-to-cup machine with built-in grinder, milk frother, self-cleaning, and multiple drink options at this price is solid value. The Rank 76 shows it competes well in the automatic coffee maker category. You're replacing multiple devices (grinder, espresso machine, milk frother) with one integrated solution.

**What Users Appreciate:**

* Fresh-ground coffee taste improvement
* Fully automatic convenience
* Multiple drink style options
* Self-cleaning saves time
* Reminder system prevents issues
* Generous tank capacities

I'm 28M, I don't take any medicines, I take vitamins like D3 + K2.

For several years, I have been suffering from symptoms that feel like sciatica. However, it likely doesn't originate from a spinal compression, yet I cannot get a precise diagnosis. The pain is localized in the **left hamstring and glute**.

Here is a summary of my medical journey so far:

**Medical Consultations & Tests:**

* **PTs & Osteopaths:** I saw several physical therapists and osteopaths (even traveled to specialists far from my home). All eventually gave up on my case.
* **Imaging:** Lumbar and pelvic MRI performed. **Results: Clean/Nothing significant.**
* **Specialists:** Saw a Sports Doctor and a Rheumatologist. No success.
* **Meds:** Took NSAIDs (Naproxen) with zero effect.
* **Sensory Testing:** Performed skin friction tests (brush, various objects). Nothing abnormal.

**My Symptoms:**

* **The Sensation:** A diffuse burning sensation **only while sitting**. It shifts between the mid-hamstring and the glute.
* **Positional Shift:** I can sometimes migrate the pain from the hamstring to the glute by changing my posture. (e.g., while on the couch, if I put my feet up on the coffee table, the pain moves to the glute). Another example, if I sit on the edge of a chair while my hamstring is painful, sometimes it will alleviates the pain, while at other times the pain will move to the glute. Sitting on a single leg (the unaffected one) is pain-free, yet, as you can assume, uncomfortable.
* **Inconsistency:** Pain is **only present when sitting**, but not systematically. Sometimes I can sit for 10 hours pain-free; other days, it hurts immediately upon sitting.
* **Pain Level:** Ranges from 0/10 to 5/10. It is livable, but at 5/10, it is clearly a social handicap.
* **The ""Seat"" Factor:** The type of seat seems to matter, but inconsistently. Example: Before a 10h flight, I had 6/10 pain in the back of an Uber. The next day, I had 1/10 pain during the entire 10h flight.
* **Sports:** I can do intense sports (sprinting, jumping, long hikes, weightlifting) without any problem.
* **Lingering Pain:** If I sit through the pain for too long (e.g., 3 hours), the burning sensation in the hamstring can linger for a few minutes to hours after standing up.

**What I have tried:**

* **McKenzie Method:** Exercises mostly effective for spinal-origin sciatica. **No effect** (which reinforces that it might not be lumbar).
* **McGill Method:** Core strengthening (Big 3). **No effect.**
* **Deep Gluteal Syndrome:** Various stretches and strengthening exercises targeting this. **No success.**
* **Posterior Chain Strengthening:** Intense strengthening for months (RDLs, leg curls, intervals/sprints, Nordic hamstring curls, Bulgarian split squats). Result: Maybe a very slight improvement (5-10%), but nothing drastic. I was trying to target stuff like Proximal Hamstring Tendinopathy here.
* **Self-massage:** No major changes.
* **AI/Analysis:** Used Gemini reasoning to find patterns. It suggested new tests, but since the pain is hard to reproduce on command (it's not systematic), it led nowhere.
* **Journaling:** Kept a detailed log for 5 months (mood, sleep, pain average/peak, seat type, activity). **No pattern found** (mood/sleep do not influence pain levels). I tried to take a psychological approach on it too, without any success.

**My Only Hypothesis so far:** A potential injury from stretching my hamstring with an elastic band a year before the ""sciatica"" symptoms started. I was stretching lying on my back, leg straight, pulling the leg towards me with an elastic band.

**Additional Information:** I live in France, I already tried my luck in French subreddits but I'm curious if I could eventually get a different perspective here.

1ps7l5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1ps7l5r/fellow_aiden_surprise_disappointment_and_questions/,Fellow Aiden surprise disappointment and questions,"So background for context

I typically use my Aiden to make one 12 oz cups each morning before I go to work and that's it for the day, with the occasional pot on the weekend or if we have company.

I use as fresh beans as possible often Counter Culture Fast Forward when I can get it recently roasted and I use a fellow opus grinder and filtered water.

So out of the blue I was gifted a Breville Luxe Brewer. I am/was planning to give it away, but I thought I'd try it first and thus the surprise. Using the default settings on the Breville and using the medium roast preset on the Aiden , the Breville produced a significantly better sweeter tasting 12 oz cup of coffee !

So observationally the Aiden is significantly easier to use, especially for a bleary eyed person first thing in the morning as basically all I need to do is measure and grind my beans select the 12 oz medium grind size and go versus having to measure out the water, beans, etc to make a cup with the luxe.

I can clearly see a difference in brewing method between the two brewers with the Aiden adding water in multiple pulses including an initial bloom whereas the Breville Luxe does a bloom then essentially steeps the whole cup for about 4 minutes before releasing it in to the cup.

One other variable is with the Luxe my water is essentially double filtered since the Luxe doesn't seem to operate consistently without it in place.

The Aiden cup is noticeably more bitter at this point

So based on what I know about how taste  should be...

1.Should adjust my grind size?

2. Change some of the other variables in the brew profile on the Aiden such as pulse or temperature etc.

3. Just accept that I like the Luxe brews better and give away my Aiden instead?

And to further confuse the whole thing, when I do make a full 8 cup pot, the results are essentially indistinguishable.
