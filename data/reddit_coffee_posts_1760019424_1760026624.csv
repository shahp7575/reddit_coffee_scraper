## Day 1 - Thursday

I've always been able to see them.

The stains, I mean. Not the ones everyone else sees—coffee rings on countertops, mud tracked across floors, the everyday grime of living. Those are nothing. Surface imperfections. What I see runs deeper.

The stains I see are on people.

Dr. Reeves says it's a gift. She's been my therapist for six months now, ever since the incident at work when I tried to explain to my supervisor why I couldn't shake hands with certain clients. How could I explain that some people are so contaminated that touching them would transfer the filth? That I could see it spreading across their skin like oil on water, dark and iridescent?

""You have a heightened sense of perception,"" Dr. Reeves told me during our first session. ""Some people are more attuned to the... imperfections in others. It's not uncommon in individuals with your level of intelligence and sensitivity.""

She understood. Finally, someone who understood.

I work as a medical researcher—or I did, before the leave of absence. My specialty is infectious diseases, which makes perfect sense when you think about it. I've spent my entire career studying contamination, transmission, the way disease spreads from person to person like invisible fire. Is it any wonder I developed the ability to see it with my naked eye?

Today, I saw her again. The woman from apartment 3B.

I live in a modest building downtown, the kind where people nod politely in elevators but never learn each other's names. Perfect for someone like me who values cleanliness and order. But she moved in three weeks ago, and from the moment I saw her, I knew she was severely contaminated.

The stain covered her left hand and was creeping up her forearm. Dark purple, almost black at the edges, pulsing with a sickly light only I could perceive. I've seen this pattern before—it indicates a deep corruption, something that's been festering for months, maybe years.

She smiled at me in the hallway. Actually smiled, as if she didn't know she was rotting from the inside out.

""Beautiful day, isn't it?"" she said.

I managed a tight nod and hurried past, my skin crawling. Didn't she realize? Couldn't she feel it?

That evening, I sat in my apartment with my cleaning supplies arranged on the coffee table. Bleach. Industrial-grade disinfectant. Rubber gloves. Scalpels sterilized in boiling water. My tools.

Dr. Reeves says the cleaning rituals help me cope with anxiety. She's right, but not in the way she thinks. The rituals aren't just coping mechanisms—they're preparation.

I've cleaned three people so far. Three successful decontaminations.

The first was almost accidental. A homeless man I'd seen near the subway station, his entire body covered in stains so thick he looked like a shadow. I followed him one night, meaning only to observe, to understand the progression of the contamination. But he cornered himself in an alley, and I saw my opportunity.

It was harder than I expected, the cleaning. Messier. But when I was finished, when I'd scrubbed away every trace of the stain, I felt a profound sense of accomplishment. Peace. I'd removed a source of contagion from the world.

The second and third were easier. A clerk at the corner store whose neck bore a spreading stain like a bruise. A jogger in the park with contamination creeping across her collarbone. Quick, efficient cleanings. No one even noticed they were gone—these people were so stained that the world had already begun to erase them.

But the woman in 3B... she's different. The stain is advanced, yes, but she still functions normally. Goes to work. Comes home with groceries. Waters the plants on her balcony. It's fascinating and disturbing. How does she not know?

I need to help her. That's what this is—help. Dr. Reeves would understand if I could explain it properly. This isn't violence; it's medicine. I'm a doctor of sorts, treating a disease no one else can see.

Tomorrow, I'll introduce myself properly. Establish trust. You can't clean someone who's running away.

## Day 3 - Saturday

Her name is Monica Hastings. She teaches elementary school. Third grade.

I know this because I've been listening through the walls. My apartment shares a layout with hers, bathroom to bathroom, bedroom to bedroom. Sound travels. She talks on the phone a lot—to her mother, to friends, to someone named Derek who might be a boyfriend.

She talked about her students today. How one of them drew her a picture of a rainbow. How another is struggling with multiplication tables. She laughed. An easy, genuine laugh.

The stain has spread past her elbow now. I can see it even through her sleeve when the light hits right. How much time does she have? Days? Weeks?

I've been studying my previous cases, reviewing my notes. I keep meticulous records—dates, observations, contamination patterns, cleaning procedures. Everything documented in the locked filing cabinet in my bedroom. Scientific rigor is essential.

Case #1: Subject exhibited late-stage contamination. Full-body coverage, approximately 70%. Cleaning conducted in alley behind Seventh Street. Duration: 47 minutes. Subject ceased struggling after 8 minutes. Post-cleaning analysis: Contamination successfully removed. No reinfection detected at disposal site.

Case #2: Subject exhibited mid-stage contamination. Isolated to neck and upper chest region, approximately 15% coverage. Cleaning conducted in stairwell of parking garage. Duration: 31 minutes. Subject remained unconscious throughout procedure. Post-cleaning analysis: Contamination successfully removed. Subject's skin returned to normal coloration within 12 minutes of cleaning completion.

Case #3: Subject exhibited progressive contamination. Shoulder and clavicle region, approximately 20% coverage. Cleaning conducted in park maintenance shed. Duration: 38 minutes. Subject regained consciousness briefly during procedure—required additional sedation. Post-cleaning analysis: Contamination successfully removed. However, noted increased difficulty in achieving complete decontamination. Possible resistance developing in contamination strain?

Monica—I can call her Monica now, in my head—will be Case #4. But she requires a different approach. The contamination is severe, but she's embedded in society. People know her. Expect her. I'll need to be more careful.

I've been taking my medication regularly, as Dr. Reeves prescribed. Quetiapine. 300mg twice daily. It's supposed to help with the ""perceptual disturbances,"" as she delicately puts it. But I've been cutting the dose in half. The medication dulls my sight, makes it harder to see the stains clearly. How can I help people if I can't properly diagnose them?

Tonight, I knocked on Monica's door. Brought her cookies—store-bought, wrapped in plastic. Can't risk homemade contamination.

She answered wearing a green sweater, jeans, bare feet. The stain had darkened another shade.

""Oh! You're from down the hall, aren't you? 3F?""

""3D,"" I corrected. ""I wanted to welcome you to the building. I realize I've been... unfriendly. In the elevator.""

Her smile was warm, grateful. ""That's so sweet! Please, come in for a minute?""

I hesitated. Entering a contaminated space is risky. But reconnaissance is necessary for proper cleaning protocol.

Her apartment was surprisingly clean. Organized. Books on shelves arranged by height. Plants healthy and well-tended. A puzzle half-completed on the coffee table—a landscape, mountains and sky.

""I love puzzles,"" she said, following my gaze. ""Something about finding where pieces fit. It's soothing.""

I nodded, cataloging everything. Exits. Windows. Layout. The bathroom would be best—tile floor, shower for drainage, door that locks. But I'd need to get her there, which requires trust.

""You're a researcher, right?"" she asked. ""I heard you on the phone once—the walls are thin, sorry! Something about epidemiology?""

""Infectious disease pathology,"" I said. ""I study how diseases spread. How to contain them. Cure them.""

""Wow. That must be intense. All those germs."" She laughed. ""I'm paranoid enough about what my kids bring home from school.""

If only she knew. If only she could see what I see.

We talked for twenty minutes. She's originally from Ohio. Moved here for the teaching job. Broke up with Derek three months ago. Has a cat named Schrödinger—""Schrodi"" for short—who was hiding under the bed, shy with strangers.

When I left, she thanked me for the cookies. Touched my arm briefly.

I felt the stain trying to transfer, like static electricity. I scrubbed my arm for forty minutes when I got home, until the skin was raw and red. But I didn't see any contamination. I'm immune—I have to be. Otherwise, I'd be contaminated too, and I'm not. I'm clean. I've always been clean.

Dr. Reeves says I should keep a journal of my thoughts. Write down when I'm feeling anxious or overwhelmed. Process my emotions.

So here it is: I'm feeling purposeful. Determined. Monica is counting on me, even if she doesn't know it yet. I'm the only one who can save her.

The cleaning will happen soon. I just need to choose the right moment.

## Day 7 - Wednesday

Something's wrong with my perception.

I saw Mr. Chen from 2A today, and for just a moment, I couldn't see his stain. I know he has one—I documented it three weeks ago, a small patch on his right temple, barely noticeable. But today, nothing. Clean.

Then I blinked, and there it was again. Darker than before. Spreading.

The medication. It has to be. Dr. Reeves keeps calling, leaving messages. ""You missed your appointment Monday. We need to discuss your treatment plan. It's important you don't adjust your dosage without supervision.""

But she doesn't understand. I need to see clearly. The stains are real—I have proof.

Don't I?

I went to the filing cabinet tonight, to review my cases. The documentation is all there. Dates. Times. Observations. Except... some of the details don't quite match my memory. Case #2—I wrote that the subject was male, approximately 40 years old. But I remember her. The female clerk from the corner store. Her name was Sarah, or Susan, or...

No. No, I'm just tired. I've been working long hours, preparing for Monica's cleaning. Stress causes memory confusion. That's normal.

I saw Monica again today. The stain has consumed her entire arm now, creeping across her shoulder toward her chest. It's moving faster than the others. She has days, maybe hours.

She was coming home from school, carrying a box of art supplies. She saw me in the lobby and smiled. Always smiling, even as the contamination devours her.

""Hey! I've been meaning to ask—do you want to come over for dinner Friday? I'm making lasagna. It's my grandmother's recipe.""

Friday. I calculated quickly. The building empties out on Friday nights. Fewer witnesses. Better timing.

""I'd like that,"" I said.

She looked genuinely pleased. Touched my arm again—the same spot as before. I felt the electricity, the attempted transfer. But I'm strong. Immune.

""Great! Around seven? Fair warning: Schrodi might actually make an appearance. He's been warming up to the idea of civilization.""

When I got back to my apartment, I prepared. I have a kit now, developed through my previous cases. Portable, efficient. Plastic sheeting. Heavy-duty garbage bags. Rope. Duct tape. Sedative—rohypnol, acquired through... creative means. Cleaning supplies. The scalpels.

And a change of clothes. Always bring a change of clothes.

Dr. Reeves called again tonight. I let it go to voicemail.

""I'm concerned about you. Your supervisor from the lab called me—did you know they've been trying to reach you? Apparently you haven't been to work in three weeks. They found some... concerning items in your workspace. Please call me back. We need to talk about what's real and what's—""

I deleted the message.

What's real is the stain on Monica's arm. What's real is that I'm the only one who can help her. What's real is that I've done this before, successfully, and I can do it again.

I have to. She's running out of time.

## Day 9 - Friday

Everything is ready.

I showered twice. Dressed in dark clothes—practical, easy to clean. My kit is in a backpack, innocuous. I took half a quetiapine before I left, just enough to steady my hands but not enough to blind me.

Monica's door at 7:00 PM exactly. She answered in a blue dress, her hair down. Pretty. She would have been pretty, I mean, if not for the stain. It's covered half her chest now. I can see it pulsing through the fabric.

""Perfect timing! Come in, come in.""

The apartment smells like tomatoes and garlic. The puzzle on the coffee table is finished now—the mountain landscape complete. Schrödinger, a gray tabby, watches me from the back of the couch with yellow eyes.

We make small talk. She pours wine—I accept but don't drink. Need to stay sharp. She tells me about her week. A student got in trouble for gluing another student's book shut. Parent-teacher conferences are coming up. She's nervous about one particular parent, a father who ""gives off weird vibes.""

I understand weird vibes. I give them off too, apparently. My supervisor said so, in the email I received three weeks ago before I stopped checking work correspondence. ""Creating an uncomfortable environment for colleagues."" ""Inappropriate discussions of contamination."" ""Mandatory psychological evaluation.""

They don't understand. They can't see what I see.

Dinner is good. I eat, even though my stomach is tight with anticipation. Monica is a good cook. Kind. Normal. In another life, we might have been friends.

But the stain is eating her alive, and I'm running out of time.

After dinner, she brings out dessert—chocolate cake. We eat at the counter. I see my opportunity.

""Could I use your bathroom?"" I ask.

""Of course! Down the hall, first door on the right.""

I go, carrying my backpack. She thinks it's odd, maybe, but doesn't comment. In the bathroom, I unpack quickly. Rope. Tape. The sedative, already measured into a small vial. I flush the toilet for authenticity, run the water. Then I prepare.

When I come out, Monica is at the sink, washing dishes. Her back to me.

The stain is so dark now it's almost three-dimensional, rising off her skin like smoke.

I move quickly. Quietly. The sedative vial in my hand, approaching—

And Schrödinger screams.

Not a meow. A full-throated, guttural scream of warning. Monica spins around, sees me, sees what I'm holding.

""What—what are you—""

""I'm trying to help you,"" I say. The words come out pleading. Don't they understand? Any of them? ""You're contaminated. I can see it. You're rotting, and I'm the only one who can clean you—""

She backs away, hands up. ""You need to leave. Right now.""

""You don't understand! The stain—your arm, your chest, it's spreading! If I don't clean it now, you'll be completely consumed—""

""There's nothing on my arm!"" Her voice is shaking. ""You're sick. You need help. Please, just leave, and I won't call the police—""

But I can't leave. Don't they see? I'm so close. I can save her. I've saved others.

Haven't I?

I lunge forward. She screams. Schrödinger attacks, claws raking my face. I stumble. Monica runs for the door, but I'm faster—I've done this before—I grab her arm, the contaminated arm, and—

It's warm. Normal. Just skin.

For a moment, just a moment, I don't see the stain at all.

And in that moment, I see her face. Really see it. Not a subject. Not a case number. Monica. A teacher. A person who makes lasagna and completes puzzles and names her cat after physics jokes. A person who is terrified of me.

I let go.

She runs. The door slams open. She's screaming in the hallway. Doors opening. Voices. Someone shouts about calling 911.

I stand in her apartment, surrounded by the evidence of a normal life, and look down at my hands.

They're covered in blood. Not Monica's—she's unharmed, I barely touched her. It's my blood. From Schrödinger's attack. From where I've been scratching at my own arms without realizing it.

My arms are raw. Infected. The skin red and weeping.

Stained.

Oh God. Oh God, what have I done?

## Day 10 - Saturday

The cell is small but clean. White walls. Metal toilet. Bench bed. A window with reinforced glass showing a square of gray sky.

They found my filing cabinet. My documentation. Case #1, #2, #3. Except they're not calling them cases. They're calling them murders.

The detective who interviewed me showed me photographs. Three bodies. A man. Two women. Their names. Their faces.

I didn't recognize them.

Or I did. I don't know anymore.

""You documented everything,"" the detective said. ""Time of death. Methods. Locations. The most detailed confession we've ever seen, and you didn't even know you were writing one.""

""They were contaminated,"" I whispered. ""The stains—""

""There were no stains. These were healthy people. A homeless veteran. A single mother. A college student. You killed them, and you—"" he paused, searching for words. ""You called it cleaning.""

Dr. Reeves came to see me this afternoon. She looks tired. Sad.

""The quetiapine,"" she said quietly. ""You stopped taking it, didn't you? Or reduced the dose?""

I nodded.

""It was managing the hallucinations. The delusions. You have schizophrenia—we've been treating it for six months. You were responding well to the medication. But when you reduced the dose...""

""The stains came back.""

""There are no stains. There never were. Your brain is processing sensory information incorrectly, creating patterns that don't exist. It's a symptom. A treatable symptom.""

I want to argue. Want to insist that I saw them, that they were real. But I keep thinking about that moment in Monica's apartment. That moment when I looked at her arm and saw only skin.

What if that was the real vision? What if everything else has been the hallucination?

""The three people,"" I said. ""Did I... did they...""

""They suffered,"" Dr. Reeves said gently. ""I'm sorry. But they're gone. You took them from their families. From their lives.""

A homeless veteran. A single mother. A college student.

People. Not cases. Not subjects.

People.

I close my eyes and try to remember their faces. But all I see are stains. Even now, even knowing what I know, when I look at my hands in the dim light of this cell, I see darkness spreading across my palms. Contamination. Rot.

The guard outside my cell—I can see it on him too. A spot on his neck.

But I know now. I know it's not real.

Don't I?

Tomorrow, they'll restart my medication. Higher dose. More monitoring. Dr. Reeves says it will take weeks, maybe months, for my perception to stabilize. To start seeing the world as it actually is, not as my fractured mind paints it.

I want that. I want to see clearly.

But there's a part of me—a quiet, insistent part—that whispers: What if you're the only one who sees the truth? What if everyone else is blind, and you're the only one who can see the contamination spreading through the world like a disease?

What if the real delusion is thinking you're delusional?

I don't know anymore. I don't know what's real.

All I know is that I tried to help. I tried to clean. I tried to save people from something only I could see.

And in doing so, I became the contamination I was fighting.

The stain I see most clearly now is the one on my own hands. My own soul.

And no amount of scrubbing will ever wash it clean.

## Day 47

Dr. Reeves sits across from me in the interview room. Same kind eyes. Same gentle voice. I'm on 800mg of quetiapine now, along with other medications whose names I can't pronounce.

""How are you feeling today?"" she asks.

""Clearer,"" I say. And it's true. The stains have faded. Not gone entirely—I still see shadows sometimes, flickers at the edges of my vision. But they're dimmer. Translucent. Easier to recognize as unreal.

""That's good. That's progress."" She makes a note.

 ""Have you been thinking about what we discussed? About how your delusions developed?"" 

I have. We've gone through my history. The childhood obsession with cleanliness. The rituals. The way my mother used to call me her ""little doctor,"" always washing my hands, organizing toys by color and size. The stress of my research job, studying diseases, death, contamination. How it all fed into my fracturing mind.

""I thought I was helping,"" I say. ""I really believed...""

""I know you did. That's the nature of delusion. It feels absolutely real. More real, sometimes, than reality itself.""

I nod. But there's something I haven't told her. Something I'm afraid to say because I don't know if it means I'm getting better or worse.

The stains are gone from most people now. The guards. Other patients. Dr. Reeves herself. But when I look in the mirror—the small, unbreakable mirror bolted to my cell wall—I still see it. On me. Spreading across my face. My arms. My chest.Am I seeing a real stain now? Real guilt, real corruption of the soul, manifesting in a way only I can perceive? 

Or is it just another hallucination? Another lie my brain tells itself?I don't ask Dr. Reeves about it. Because I'm afraid of what the answer might mean.Instead, I take my pills. 

Attend my sessions. Behave well so maybe, someday, they'll let me have a trial instead of just keeping me here forever.And at night, in my cell, I scrub my hands under cold water until they're numb.Some stains, I'm learning, you can't clean away.

Some stains go all the way down to the bone.And the worst part—the part that keeps me awake, staring at that gray square of sky through reinforced glass—is that I still don't know if I'm seeing clearly now, or if I was seeing clearly then.What if the medication is the real contamination, clouding my vision, making me blind to the truth I once perceived?

What if I really was helping, and now they've made me forget how to see?

I look at my hands in the darkness.Clean, the doctors say.

But I know better.

I can still see the stain.",1,1760026442.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1o2a81l,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1o2a81l/new_to_tea/,New to tea,"Well, I'm new to tea other than Lipton tea bags, which I rarely make or drink. Since I'm getting older, and I guess tea has health benefits including possibly helping my blood pressure, I've made the decision to give tea a good try. I am a black coffee lover, but I've never gotten too involved with tea.

  
I just purchased a Breville compact infuser, some Rishi English breakfast tea for mornings (along with my coffee, I'm not ready to give that up) and some US Wellness Chamomile tea for the evenings. I bought a lot, a pound of each, but while I use this I'm looking for other tea's that are easy to get (preferably on Amazon) that may be good. I will say that I have had one cup of each that I purchased now and I find them both to be fairly pleasant.

I guess from what I've read I should be looking into some green tea as well? My main goal is health benefits and blood pressure reduction, since my diastolic pressure is a bit high. The plan is to sweeten with honey, for it's benefits as well. 

I guess I'm just asking for tea wisdom. Lay it on it me you have any tips or suggestions!",1,1760026442.0,tea,0,1.0,False

Want a quick way to blow $4,500 and get nothing to show for it except disappointment and aggravation? If so, read on!

It seems online companies continue to find new and increasingly clever ways to scam us out of our money. I joined **Tawkify** after becoming weary of the dating apps. I was hopeful it would be an E-ticket to meeting a good match.

For background, I'm a 62-year-old female in the Pacific Northwest: attractive, energetic, educated, funny, financially secure, and a business owner, as well as a mother of two wonderful grown children. I hoped to meet someone who also possesses these qualities and is kind and smart. I don't care if my match is tall, has hair, is handsome, or is body beautiful, but they have be great. Character matters more than anything.

Although my matchmakers were lovely people, the company appears to charge thousands of dollars but fails to deliver on its promises. My first date was fine, (we met for dinner in Portland) and we agreed to see each other again, but after a little texting, he never scheduled a second date. My second date (for coffee) was the longest 30 minutes of my life with a man that I can only describe as a turd. I had to use every conversational skill I have to get complete sentences out of him. Excruciating. I just had my third date (online) with a man who sounded like he'd be a perfect match. The thing is, I don't think he was a real dater. I think Tawkify keeps a ""stable"" of people who are not their clients, but will agree to match and go on dates. I wouldn't be surprised if some of these people were compensated for their time to go on dates that will never result in anything.

I should also mention that between date one and date two, I got a medical diagnosis and put my membership on hold until I got things settled. I was assured that pausing was fine, and they wished me the best. When I tried to resume my membership, they said my membership was complete and offered me nothing. I had to escalate my case to management and provide supporting emails to get them to do the right thing.

Bottom line: Don't waste your time or your money on **Tawkify.** You're better off joining a meetup group, taking a class, joining a pickleball team, or even going to a bar. I learned the hard way and feel scammed out of $4,500. Hope this helps you on your way. Thanks for listening.",1,1760026421.0,datingoverfifty,0,1.0,False
1o2a7nx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o2a7nx,Enjoy the Leftovers! This Boss Just Graduated to RUN Silicon Valley,"Chapter 1  
  
  
At the company dinner, my fiancé's little assistant Olivia picked up a buffalo wing, took a deliberate bite right in front of everyone, then casually dropped it onto Kai's plate.  
  
  
He didn't even flinch—just picked it up and kept eating.  
  
  
That night, I didn’t even wait for him to speak.  
  
  
“The engagement’s off. Consider yourself officially dumped.”  
  
  
He rubbed his temples, looking annoyed: ""Seriously? Over a damn chicken wing?""  
  
  
""The one still glistening with her saliva,"" I shot back.  
  
  
""Jesus Christ, Lia, no wonder they call you a jealous witch—you freak out over the tiniest things!""  
  
  
""Whatever. You wanna call it off? FINE by me. Just don't come crawling back to me later!""  
  
  
He was dead certain I was too in love to actually walk away.  
  
  
Little did he know, my love had already died—every time he flirted with that dumb assistant just buried it deeper.  
  
  
Go enjoy your chicken wings, you CHEAP bastard!  
  
  
We're fucking DONE!  
  
  
That same day, I told my parents I wanted to call off the engagement.  
  
  
Mom and Dad were surprised but respected my decision.  
  
  
After that, Kai went into full cold-war mode with me.  
  
  
Phone number blocked, social media deleted, gaming friends removed...  
  
  
This was his go-to move every time we fought.  
  
  
He was confident I couldn't live without him, that I'd come crawling back like always.  
  
  
But this time, I stared at that ""Add Friend"" button and for once, didn't press it.  
  
  
A week later, the company group chat lit up with an announcement:  
  
  
""Today is CEO Reynolds's birthday. He's treating everyone. Mandatory attendance, no sick days allowed.""  
  
  
I didn't want to make things awkward for my coworkers, so I went.  
  
  
The moment I walked into the private dining room, there was Kai at the head table with Olivia whispering in his ear.  
  
  
Their heads were so close their lips were practically touching, completely shutting out everyone else in the room.  
  
  
A second later, they both burst out laughing at their little inside joke.  
  
  
I couldn't watch anymore. Found a corner table and sat down.  
  
  
Everyone started giving Kai their birthday gifts. I ignored the whole show and focused on my wine.  
  
  
Then a shadow fell over me. I looked up to see Kai's stupidly perfect face staring down at me.  
  
  
Same old irritated expression I knew so well.  
  
  
""Lia, where's my present?""  
  
  
In the past, I would've started planning for Kai's birthday months in advance.  
  
  
The most memorable one took me over six months—I hand-built a scale replica of the flying house from ""Up,"" his favorite Pixar movie.  
  
  
When those balloons lifted off, he said we'd be like Carl and Ellie, together till we were old and gray.  
  
  
I believed every word. Didn't realize his promises wouldn't even last three years.  
  
  
Facing his demanding stare, I just shrugged: ""I forgot.""  
  
  
My attitude clearly pissed him off. He completely lost it.  
  
  
""Lia, are you done with this tantrum yet?""  
  
  
""You're seriously gonna drag this out for a whole week over something so stupid?""  
  
  
I noticed Olivia's lipstick smeared on the corner of his mouth and felt sick to my stomach.  
  
  
""I'm not throwing a tantrum. I meant what I said about calling off the engagement.""  
  
  
Kai's expression froze for a split second, but the moment Olivia grabbed his hand, he was back to his arrogant self.  
  
  
""Oh Lia, maybe you're being just a bit unreasonable? I was just trying not to waste food—it's environmentally conscious. But if my presence bothers you so much, I can just grab some leftovers from the break room next time.""  
  
  
Olivia's fake innocent act immediately made Kai go into white knight mode.  
  
  
""Oh Liv, don't say that. You deserve the best of everything in this world. Lia's the one who shouldn't be at this party. Who does she think she is? Everyone has to cater to her drama?""  
  
  
""Kai, don't say that! Lia might be a bit dramatic, but she's still your fiancée. You should sweet talk her when needed. I really don't want you two fighting over me.""  
  
  
""Sweet talk? If my parents weren't begging me to go through with this merger marriage, I wouldn't even be with her. Getting pissed off over every little thing—it's fucking exhausting.""  
  
  
Olivia walked over and patted my back with fake concern.  
  
  
""Sweetie, girl to girl? You're being kind of extra right now. Poor Kai has been losing sleep over your drama.I think you two aren't compatible personality-wise, but you're still engaged for business reasons. Maybe you should compromise a bit?""  
  
  
I slapped her hand away and smiled coldly.  
  
  
""Olivia, you know what I really admire about you?""  
  
  
""How you're such a fucking disaster at everything but excel at being a homewrecking bitch.""  
  
  
Her smug mask slipped instantly.  
  
  
Kai went nuclear.  
  
  
""Lia, who gave you the fucking right to attack Olivia like that?""  
  
  
""Attack? She's got the same jewelry you bought me and flaunts it around the office. She spreads gossip about our fights in the break room. And how the fuck does she know about that birthmark on your ass?""  
  
  
""ENOUGH.""  
  
  
SLAP.  
  
  
Kai backhanded me right there in front of the entire executive team.  
  
  
My ears started ringing and everything went fuzzy.  
  
  
But I could still clearly see every face in that room—some pitying, some disgusted, all of them staring at me like I was pathetic.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
When my hearing cleared, I caught Kai's loud announcement:  
  
  
""Starting today, everyone better like our couple photos. Hit a thousand likes, and I'll dump Lia and marry Olivia tomorrow.""  
  
  
With that, he grabbed Olivia's hand and stormed out without looking back. Right before leaving the private room, Olivia shot me a smug, triumphant look.  
  
  
After they bounced, people started clearing out.  
  
  
Some were straight-up gloating: ""Girl thought she could act all high and mighty. Well, look how that worked out. Karma's a bitch, right?""  
  
  
Others tried playing advisor: ""Look, swallow your pride and just apologize. You really want him to actually marry his assistant?""  
  
  
I knew this whole social media stunt was just Kai's way of forcing me to crawl back and beg.  
  
  
But this time? Fuck that. I'd rather die than grovel again.  
  
  
The room that had been buzzing with birthday energy was now just me and empty champagne glasses.  
  
  
I grabbed the leftover bourbon and knocked it back. The burn hit my throat and chest, making my eyes water.  
  
  
Two decades of history, and this is how we end? Honestly, it's not as devastating as I thought it'd be.  
  
  
Moving clear across the country to Seattle for the Vanderbilt arrangement—at least Kai won't be able to mess with my head anymore.  
  
  
Though I have no idea why tears are streaming down my face right now.  
  
  
Back home, I started throwing stuff into suitcases.  
  
  
Kai and I went way back—like, sandbox and juice box back. We'd spent most of our lives attached at the hip.  
  
  
That kind of history meant I had a shit-ton of memories to sort through.  
  
  
This little red paper flower was from kindergarten—Kai's first gold star. He ran over with his gap-toothed grin to give it to me.  
  
  
I can still hear five-year-old him saying: ""I wanna give Lia all the best stuff ever.""  
  
  
This photo was from my traumatic first period experience. Kai secretly took a picture of my horror-movie-level panic face.  
  
  
Thirteen-year-old me, who completely zoned out during health class, was convinced I was dying. I dramatically told him to live his best life after I was gone.  
  
  
He could get a girlfriend, I said, just not one prettier than me.  
  
  
Poor guy was totally lost until he realized I'd just gotten my period.  
  
  
He sprinted to CVS for pads, then we spent an hour watching YouTube tutorials on how periods work.  
  
  
He roasted me for not paying attention in sex ed. I got so embarrassed I chomped down on his arm.  
  
  
Years later, he told me that bite didn't hurt at all—but it was the moment he stopped seeing me as just his annoying little neighbor.  
  
  
We became official after that, but different colleges meant four years of FaceTime dates and Greyhound bus trips.  
  
  
Our entire relationship became a collection of boarding passes and gas receipts.  
  
  
Four years straight, 120,000 miles—that's how far we'd travel just for weekend visits.  
  
  
Back then, I was his entire world. He never bitched about those brutal eight-hour drives.  
  
  
My fingers found the small velvet box with our promise rings inside.  
  
  
I moved back to Silicon Valley right after graduation, just for him.  
  
  
The day I got back, he dragged me to this fancy jeweler in Palo Alto.  
  
  
I still remember what he said sliding that ring onto my finger:  
  
  
""Lia, once this ring goes on, you're stuck with me forever. You're never getting away.""  
  
  
Turns out, he'd be the one running away in the end.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
The day Olivia interviewed at the company, she bombed spectacularly. Kai was visibly disgusted with her performance.  
  
  
I didn't think twice about this candidate who clearly lacked both education and skills.  
  
  
But somehow, she got hired anyway. Not just hired—she somehow clawed her way up from nobody to Kai's executive assistant.  
  
  
I first realized something was seriously wrong when I spotted our matching promise ring on Olivia's finger.  
  
  
At first, when I confronted him, Kai would patiently explain and try to make me feel better.  
  
  
But over time, he just got annoyed with my questions.  
  
  
The more I held back, compromised, and tried to please him, the more blatantly he favored Olivia.  
  
  
Company dinners became all about Olivia's food preferences.  
  
  
Olivia worked maybe half-days while spending the rest of her time partying with Kai.  
  
  
Meanwhile, Kai dumped all of Olivia's actual assistant work on me.  
  
  
He started mentioning her more and more around me.  
  
  
First it was unconscious praise and admiration.  
  
  
Then he started comparing us—telling me I wasn't as thoughtful as her, not as considerate.  
  
  
The breaking point came during a company afternoon coffee break. Kai mentioned his latte tasted amazing.  
  
  
Olivia said she wanted to try it, so Kai handed over his cup without hesitation.  
  
  
She put her lips right on his straw and took a huge sip.  
  
  
Then Kai took the cup back and kept drinking, right over her lipstick mark.  
  
  
In that moment, my heart felt like it was being crushed by invisible hands—sour and painful.  
  
  
After that, Olivia's boundary-crossing got worse and worse.  
  
  
Worried about Kai getting sunburned, she'd rub sunscreen all over his body with her own hands.  
  
  
When I'd pack Kai lunch, she'd make lunch too.  
  
  
She'd always eat mine first, claiming she loved my cooking, then make Kai eat hers instead.  
  
  
Even my birthday celebration got canceled because Olivia had a cold and needed Kai's attention.  
  
  
But whenever I complained about any of this, Kai would snap:  
  
  
""Lia, you've got such a dirty mind. Liv works so hard for me—I'm just looking out for my employee. Don't project your sick thoughts onto her.""  
  
  
As time went on, he sounded less and less convinced saying it.  
  
  
The final straw was a major industry event. The organizers required plus-ones, but Kai never told me. He took Olivia instead.  
  
  
I only found out when multiple people asked if we'd broken up.  
  
  
When I confronted him, Kai was even angrier than me: ""I was just helping Liv network and develop talent for the company. Why are you being so petty?""  
  
  
That time, we had the longest cold war yet.  
  
  
So long I actually thought we might be done for good.  
  
  
Until his late-night text: ""Baby, my stomach really hurts.""  
  
  
All my fake indifference crumbled instantly.  
  
  
And so the toxic cycle started again—me questioning, him getting mad, me appeasing, him forgiving.  
  
  
I snapped the ring box shut and tossed it in the trash.  
  
  
Deep in my drawer was an apology letter eighteen-year-old Kai had written after missing one of my texts.  
  
  
Back then, he actually gave a damn about me.  
  
  
Now all he cared about was Olivia.  
  
  
I pulled out the letter, tore it into pieces, and threw them away.  
  
  
After clearing out decades of memories, the house felt empty.  
  
  
My heart felt just as hollow.  
  
  
The company group chat was still blowing up with photos of Olivia celebrating Kai's birthday and making him laugh.  
  
  
Knowing how much Kai favored her, my coworkers were kissing ass left and right:  
  
  
""OMG, Kai and Liv are such a perfect match!""  
  
  
""This is the kind of girlfriend you want—not some bitter, jealous bitch like Lia who's always throwing tantrums.""  
  
  
""Lia only got where she is because of daddy's money. Liv earned her position. There's no comparison.""  
  
  
I was done watching this shit show. I called my lawyer and told him to pull all my investments from Reynolds Corp.

1o2a6zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/discogs/comments/1o2a6zo/the_economics_of_a_used_record_or_why_your_50_lp/,The Economics of a Used Record (or: Why your $50 LP now costs $200),"I’m not a dealer. I’m a european collector who occasionally sells a record to make room for the next one.

Here’s how the “magic” happens:



In 2020 I find a record online for **$50**. That’s the baseline — the “value.”

Shipping was **$30** for three records, so let’s call it **$10** for this one. Add another **$10** for customs and taxes.

Once it arrives, I catalog it on Discogs, check the exact pressing, grade it, write a description — that’s 5 to 15 minutes of my life gone.

When it sells, I need a sleeve (**$0.50**), a proper mailer (**$2.50**), and at least **15 minutes** to print the invoice, write the address, and drop it at the post office.

So I’ve spent **$70** total and about **half an hour** of work.

Let’s say my time is worth a modest **$40/hour** (no overhead, no social insurance, just coffee). That’s another $20.

Now the record has cost me **$90** in real terms.



But since then, the **USD dropped 20%**, so that’s **$108**.

Then DJT slaps on a **39% import tariff** to my country — so it’s **$150** before I even think about selling.

Discogs and PayPal want **12.64%** in combined fees, applied to the total (record + shipping).

Let’s say shipping is **$25** — that means my selling price needs to be around **$197** just to *break even.*

1o2a6x1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o2a6x1,Brilliant but hard to get to know- Singapore 5-day trip,"You ever really admire someone’s brilliance but still have a hard time connecting on a emotional level? Kind of how i feel about singapore. 

Visited Singapore for 5 days last November. 

Growing up, my only image of Singapore was that classic lion fountain by the bay. 

And when i started work, it became my favorite stopover spot because of Changi airport, which deserves all the hype. Pictures dont do it justice. The Jewel waterfall, the sky garden (but skip the maze and bouncenet = overpriced), the insane shopping mall, the massage chairs. Literally spent half a day there just wandering, eating until i felt like a bloated cow lol There’s a reason it’s been named the world’s best airport 13 years in a row.

I felt that’s exact precision and pride carries through the whole country. Even if Singapore isn’t #1 in something, you can feel the drive of it. 

But the wildest part is remembering that just 50–60 years ago, this place was basically a fishing village with just 2 Mil population. from third world to one of Asia’s economic powerhouses in one life time. 

Lee Kuan Yew’s leadership definitely shaped that , equal parts admirable and intense capitalist authoitaian. It’s awe-inspiring and, honestly, a bit sad realizing how rare that kind of foresight and execution is not every world leader.  (Def cheek out the national museum of Singapore- had a lot of pictures of 60-70 years ago, crazy contrast) 

I had tons of fun, but every night when i was journal, Singapore gave me a weird emotional contrast. Impeccably clean, insanely efficient, incredibly fun, yet something about it felt a bit too smooth to grip onto. Does that make sense? 

All that said, I had a blast. On to the gooood stuffs highlights. 
- The hawker culture and food is unmatched . Ahhh especially the Hainan Chicken Rice (海南雞飯).
- Peranakan Museum ended up being one of my favorite stops. It’s often skipped, but the beadwork and cultural blend of Chinese and Malay and indo heritage was just beautiful
- Haw Par Villa was hands down the quirkiest experience. Imagine an outdoor museum of Chinese mythology with a literal “hell exhibit.” Creepy and lots of accidental hilarious statues

Highlights from the trip:

- National Museum of Singapore, Fort Canning Park
- the insane Orchid Garden 
- Cloud Forest + Flower Dome + Marina Bay Sands light show
- Exploring Chinatown, Little India, and Kampong Glam. Highlight!!  all so distinct yet harmoniously blended
- Hawker food, Malatang from Tang Tang in Parklane Mall (I got addicted. lol)
- Peranakan houses along Joo Chiat, The Intan, and Chijmes for coffee + tea
- Jewel at Changi Airport— skip the hedge maze, but the sky garden is a must.

We just moved out of a unit that we lived in for two years in the state of Alabama. This unit is owned by a larger rental company who owns the entire apartment complex (and many others in our city), not a singular landlord. 

Upon move-out, they sent us a bill for $1300 for, in their words, “we found small rips in the vinyl flooring in the living room. As a result, a charge for vinyl replacement will be included on your final move-out statement.” I’ve attached photos of the small rips (most likely from our couches or coffee table I am assuming over these two years). They are claiming the rips cannot be patched and the entire flooring must be replaced. We are wondering:

1. Are we liable to replace the entire flooring in the living room? Landlord said they are charging us for the depreciated value of the floor and not the new flooring. They then lied and said that vinyl flooring can’t be patched, and when we told them vinyl flooring absolutely can be patch repaired, they backtracked and said that it wouldn’t uphold their “aesthetics” of the apartment.

2. If we are not liable, how do we proceed? They are also offering to go through our renter’s insurance, but I don’t know if that would be beneficial or fair — I called insurance and the agent said this issue isn’t covered, we have a $500 deductible, and the landlord would most likely also keep our $250 deposit.

My girlfriend (26F) and I (30M) have been together for almost two years. We’ve had some rough patches, and about two months ago we broke up for two weeks before deciding to get back together and try again on healthier terms.

When she moved back to my country after living abroad for two years, she often stayed at my parents’ house (where I live) because she didn’t like being at her mom’s place. I didn’t mind at all — I was happy she wanted to be with me, while also keeping a healthy balance between together time and alone time.

Eventually, she got her own apartment thanks to an inheritance she receives monthly. I even advised her to stay with her mom a bit longer to save money, but she said she needed her peace. She’s in a more privileged financial position than me — I make more money from my actual job, but she has her inheritance and does small, unstable jobs here and there.

One thing that’s always caught my attention a little: I’ve paid for *all* of our dinners, dates, coffees, outings, etc. She’s invited me maybe three or four times in nearly two years. Sometimes when she pays, she even asks me to cover my half. She knows I don’t make a lot, yet I still make the effort to take care of her financially when we go out.

When I stay at her place on weekends (and occasionally on a weekday), I barely use anything — I don’t eat her food, I don’t use her toiletries, and if I drink a soda, I replace it. I always pay for our weekend takeout and lunches and dinners for both of us. 

Recently, she’s been complaining about having less money because of some bad financial decisions. During an argument, she said she wanted me to “provide more” and “validate her” (she identifies as having an anxious attachment style). Then she told me she’d like me to help pay her *light bill* — about $100 a month — since I stay over on weekends.

That really threw me off. I don’t live there, I don’t keep any clothes or personal stuff there, and I already pay for every meal we share. I told her that staying over should be because she *wants* me there, not because I owe her for it. Ironically, earlier this year she was upset that I didn’t stay over *enough*. Now that I do, I’m suddenly expected to pay a bill?

I know her attachment style makes her crave reassurance and validation, and I’ve really tried to give that to her. But I’m starting to feel like it’s never enough — that she’s blurring emotional needs with financial ones.

**TL;DR;** : Girlfriend complains that I am not supporting her and should pay for her light bill. Is she being ungrateful in our relationship?",2,1760026180.0,relationships,5,0.75,False

Today’s one of those times.
So, very recently, my friends and I started something that’s really close to our hearts, a run club called Awaara. By now, you might’ve already heard the name floating around.

Till now, all our runs were free, but this time, it’s a paid one and I know what many of you are thinking that “Who pays to run?""
But here’s the thing, it’s not about running. Running is honestly the last thing we prioritize.

Awaara has always been about meeting new people. This Sunday, we’re meeting at Third Wave Coffee, where we’ll share breakfast together and if you know their prices, you’ll know ₹249 is honestly the best deal possible.
We’ll also have a live jamming session right after, so it’s not just a run… it’s a whole vibe.

If you’ve seen other run clubs in Bengaluru, you’d know how expensive and corporate they usually are. Awaara was built differently... for students, by students, a space where college folks can just be themselves, meet like-minded people, and start their Sundays with good energy and good company.

And, I get it not everyone loves running. That’s completely fine. Even if you just want to hang out and meet new people, come straight to the cafe.
But trust me, running together feeling that morning breeze, laughing with people you’ve just met, it hits differently. You’ll only understand this if you come.

I genuinely request you people to come and experience it just once. You'll get to know why we call it Awaara.

The arrangement started because I was in the process of a divorce and didn’t want anything with strings or complicated. It started where I was just one of her regulars. 

I had a few other girls I talked to that didn’t last very long, but this one was very reliable. I could have a good conversations with, and we had a connection on some level. 

Over the course of me seeing this SB, I knew that she had other clients, but that didn’t bother me because I didn’t have feelings. 

Things progressed to where she was my full-time SB, and I would see her 3 to 4 times a week. Sometimes this would be food or coffee or talking or other activities again during this time, I knew that she saw other people after a while though I said I started getting feelings for her and said that if I’m going to see her 3 to 4 times a week then why don’t we just be in a full-time relationship and she cuts out all her others. 

Also, during this time, she would never do overnights at her place, even though I came over to her place very often. 

It just so happened that I had a mutual friend or maybe a mutual acquaintance, who also knew my SB in real life. This individual told me that my SB had a long-term boyfriend. This boyfriend lived with her and we just leave whenever I came over. I confronted her about this, because I noticed this guy was there pretty often and would leave whenever I came over and she said oh he’s just a friend. He’s like my best friend.

Over the last couple weeks, I told her that I was going to leave her because I was looking for something real now that my divorce is finalized, I gave her the first option to make our relationship official and she said that she had feelings but that she couldn’t give up her other clients.

So I told her, if she cares about me what she says she does then why doesn’t she see me for free? She countered back with that she would see me the same amount of times on a reduced allowance, but that she still needed to make money. 

Do you feel that she is just saying this to keep me around because I’ve been a reliable provider for her or might she actually have feelings? Do you think this boyfriend is an actual boyfriend or is it just a friend? ",1,1760025830.0,sugarlifestyleforum,14,0.67,False

Am I naive to agree? Or selfish to feel it’s unfair?","Yes I know how I may be coming across right now. To give more context, we had been experiencing a pretty horrible rough patch after we had our second child just over a year ago. 

Having a second baby while our first was still relatively young was always important to my ex, admittedly I had pushed back a little longer then expected - not because I didn’t want this too, but because I wanted to make sure we were in a secure enough position to support us having a good life. I eventually landed on the conclusion that there would never be the perfect time and completely let go and fell pregnant not long after right at the height of my career. After my paid parental leave was up this meant my partner for the first time in 13 years was now solely supporting me. 

As someone who from a very young age had to fight to make a career and home for myself out of literally nothing, having to be taken care of by someone else left me feeling extremely vulnerable. For some reason I couldn’t get it out of my head that I was being a burden. This lead me to constant approval seeking behaviours, and eventual self abandonment and shrinking myself down to nothing because for some reason I just feel like a burden and would over extend, over give, never ask, always say yes to ‘make up’ for having to support me. 

It meant that even though all I wanted was to enjoy our new baby together, as soon as my ex’s parental leave was up he decided to join a gym and go everyday for two hours, or take himself out to coffee, or go for a nap at the beach. He would finish at 11-12 most days, sometimes earlier, and there was always, always something he needed to do / get before eventually coming home just before I have to start the evening routine. Despite always talking about how lucky he is that he gets to finish early and spend all the daylight hours with his baby while she’s so young and how we will go on lots of walks, beach days ect - I realised after 4 months that not once did he ever sacrifice his time to himself to spend time as a family, let alone for me to be able to go to the gym, a walk or spend an hour to myself every now and then. I was so focused on supporting his mental and physical health that mine ended up being completely neglected. 

I eventually started to feel like he was avoiding coming home, and I asked if once everyone and then we could do something together and was met with anger and defensiveness. He did eventually apologise as he was feeling protective of his gym progression in particular and agreed to make time once a week or so. Then another two months passed and no changes. I eventually started to feel insecure and needing reassurance which i used violating his privacy and going through his phone all the time. It only lead me to see that it was a sea of content seeking out of sexual content of other women through instagram, reddit, and onlyfans. I would question him (really just wanting reassurance that it was nothing to worry about), he would become explosive and cruel, telling me to get a hobby, to go back to work, that I don’t do enough around the house and that he’s done supporting my ‘ass’- bare in mind i never asked for so much as a coffee - ME, who never had to rely on anyone for anything, who unconditionally supported him during career pivots, who was the higher income earner before having HIS baby would be reduced to nothing but an insecure little burden. 

I can’t tell you how much this wore me down. The cycle of contradictions, being isolated, fighting, being put down, being desperate for his reassurance/approval, sweeping it all under the rug so we can make up and go back to normal. 

I started to find myself using more sex and opening up to all his fantasy’s as a way to try and feel connected and have my emotional needs met.

Eventually a year of the same cycle continued, and i started to develop high functioning post natal depression and completely lost my sense of self. I got to leave the house only handful of times which by the time it happened I had to force myself as I just didn’t want to be seen, or out of what became to feel like my ‘safe bubble’ at home away from anything. By the time my leave was over, the emotional damage was already so bad that about 2 months back finding my feet again, all it took was a sarcastic response (as a first) to his belittling of me for him to call it quits and he decided to up and leave me to live back at home. After fighting to keep my walls down despite everything this absolutely broke me. 

Ever since I’ve been the sole parent at home day in, day out juggling work and children while he picks the kids up for a play date a few days a week until I finish work after his finished with his own activities, then I just carry on with the evening routine while he goes back to his parents. Showing up no matter how much pain I’m in, while he’s free to just live out his days the way he wants with no responsibilities felt like a kick in the gut. 

Now fast forward and after some space he wants us to try again, but then after sex (yes I know) it changed to him continuing to live at his parents as while I maintain the load at home with the children so because he needs to find himself again and so we have more time to work on ourselves individually. 

At first I was so wrapped up in every word he was saying and don’t get me wrong, I wholeheartedly agree that we need to work on our self’s as individuals before beginning anything. But where is the time for me to have even a little fighting chance to get back to myself? All I do is work and by the time I’m finished I’m straight back into being a mother to two young children. How can I possibly re-discover myself and prioritise my mental health when all I am is a mother? I just can’t help but feel like he wants to have his cake and eat it too but maybe I’m being selfish. I don’t know how to approach this without sounding bitter because once again it feels like I am being shown that i don’t matter and that I just have to try and shape myself to be better for him without being given the same fighting chance.

Sorry, this is mostly just a rant and most of it is my fault but I’m just feeling sorry for myself and needed to rant about this situation.

I had my first seizure a few months before I graduated high school. I  wasn’t planning on going to college and instead try to get an internship or job overseas. Because of the seizure I  went to college. I went two years without one and also started college for a cultural studies degree mostly because I love learning about different cultures and traveling. I went to a small college three hours from home so my parents could help if anything happened, and I had local support if needed. This college is religious so a lot of the people who get my degree go on to be overseas missionaries. 

After freshman year, I went on a short missions trip abroad since I wasn’t having seizures and loved it. But by the end of sophomore year, my seizures returned about once a month. I had to quit my jobs and switch to campus work since I couldn’t drive. I did other cultural volunteer work and such despite this but it was in country. 

My parents moved to my college town junior year, but I continued living independently. My mom worked at my college and most students whose parents work there live at home. Meanwhile, my degree had unstable faculty…no professor my freshman year, a poor substitute junior year, and a new professor senior year. The degree requires an overseas internship to experience ministry and cultural immersion. I couldn’t go abroad due to seizures, so my senior year I proposed an alternative: work at a new local Colombian cafe, learn Spanish, interact with the community, and complete all required paperwork. The professor agreed since I couldn’t go overseas. 

During this internship, I lived on my own, got rides when needed, built relationships with coworkers and locals, and managed focal seizures. I  didn’t have any full in seizures! My fiancé and I were planning our marriage and where to live, which kinda tied directly to this internship since i could continue the job after the internship. I emailed my professor later in the summer apologizing for my late work but my professor told me I had failed because the papers weren’t done on time. I didn’t really know it had ended. 

He told me to talk to the dean and the dean suggested redoing and asked about going overseas. I explained my situation, he questioned how my local internship counted toward ministry or cultural experience and said I should think about getting a different degree since I  can’t go overseas because of epilepsy. He basically said “everyone else who gets this degree is a missionary overseas but you’re not so why are you in this degree?” I emailed my professor some info and he later emailed:

“I understand some of your situation, and it seems that you do better in a classroom setting. The internship is a test of your ability to work and live independently, to show personal rigor and to accomplish goals. Your previous internship did not produce those outcomes.

This internship requires a 20-page paper before you begin the internship.
It requires 3 hours of formal language learning given by a qualified tutor/teacher.... this is not trying to pick up some Spanish in the kitchen.
It requires regular newsletters to a group of prayer partners and supporters. Our current intern has sent out 4 in the past 45 days.
It requires a prayer journal where you are making at least 3 entries a week. It takes discipline to do this. I read this journal at the end of the internship.
It requires a defined ministry, not just making coffee and talking to a guest here and there. Are there events at Papis that invite people to listen to music and to a talk about life or some topic that can be explored? This is typically what coffeehouse ministries do.
It requires a mentor overseeing all of these things.
And then there are final evaluations by the language teacher, the mentor and an exit interview, and a paper.

In your past attempt, none of these requirements were met. If you were to try this again, I would require every one of these to be fulfilled. That is simply the program.

I'm sending the syllabus and guidelines again.

Please think and pray about this.

I don't know what courses would be needed to complete another degree. I would recommend you do on-campus classes. For where the Lord has placed you now, that avenue toward graduation might be more fun and be a more fulfilling conclusion to your time at college”

I’m frustrated. “The internship is a test of your ability to work and live independently”

I’ve been living independently for four years and this internship was all me living independently.

“It seems that you do better in a classroom setting”

I’ve failed classes and struggled with due dates, but I was excited to do the internship because classroom work makes my seizures worse due to stress. He doesn’t even know if I do better in the classroom (which I don’t) because he’s had 3 classes with me!

I feel like my effort has been dismissed. I worked long hours, managed two jobs, and still tried to complete all requirements, but now I may have to redo the internship in a way I literally cannot due to my epilepsy, or change my degree entirely.

TL;DR: Had to switch an overseas internship for epilepsy and did one locally with permission. Professor failed me for missing paperwork and now wants me to redo it like everyone else or change my degree.

1o29oh0,https://i.redd.it/1vhep3zoy3uf1.png,​5 Micro-Habits That Will Make You Unrecognizable in 6 Months,"It’s not about massive life changes. It’s about the tiny, almost invisible choices you make every single day that build an extraordinary life.
​(Aquí deberías insertar una imagen de alta calidad y sin derechos de autor. Busca en Unsplash o Pexels algo que represente crecimiento, un camino, o una transformación, como un amanecer sobre una montaña).
​We all want to change.
​We dream of being more productive, healthier, smarter, or happier. So, we set massive goals. ""I'm going to write a novel."" ""I'm going to lose 50 pounds."" ""I'm going to become fluent in Spanish.""
​For a week, we're superheroes. We wake up at 5 AM, eat salads, and study until our brains hurt.
​Then, life happens. We get tired. We get bored. The sheer size of the goal crushes our motivation. We fall back into old patterns and end the year feeling exactly like we started.
​I was trapped in that cycle for years. Until I realized the secret isn't in the giant leaps. It's in the micro-habits.
​These are tiny, almost effortless actions that, when done consistently, compound into massive results. They fly under the radar of your brain's resistance to change.
​Forget becoming a new person overnight. Instead, try these five micro-habits. In six months, you won’t just be better—you’ll be unrecognizable to your past self.
​1. The 5-Minute Swap: Trade Scrolling for Learning
​The Problem: We instinctively reach for our phones during any moment of downtime—waiting in line, during a commercial, or right before bed. We spend hours scrolling through content we won’t remember tomorrow.
​The Micro-Habit: Identify your biggest time-wasting app (be honest: it's probably TikTok, Instagram, or X). Now, move its icon to a different screen. In its place, put a learning-focused app (like Kindle, Medium, Duolingo, or Blinkist).
​The next time your thumb automatically opens that spot, you'll see the learning app. Commit to using it for just 5 minutes. That’s it. Read two pages of a book. Do one language lesson. Read one short article.
​The result: In six months, you could have read several books or made significant progress in a new language, all by reclaiming dead time.
​2. The ""Do It Now"" Rule: Conquer Any 2-Minute Task
​The Problem: Our to-do lists are filled with small, nagging tasks: wash that one coffee mug, answer that simple email, take out the trash. We procrastinate on them, and they create a constant, low-level hum of anxiety in our minds.
​The Micro-Habit: If a task takes less than two minutes to complete, do it immediately. Don't write it down. Don't schedule it. Don't think about it. Just do it.
​Finished your coffee? Rinse the mug now.
​See a piece of trash on the floor? Pick it up now.
​Remember you need to text someone back? Do it now.
​""The smallest action is always better than the grandest intention.""
​The result: Your physical and mental space becomes decluttered. You build momentum and create a powerful identity as someone who takes action.
​3. The Gratitude Filter: Reframe Your First Complaint
​The Problem: It's easy to default to complaining. The coffee is cold. The traffic is bad. The internet is slow. This negative mindset colors our entire day and drains our energy.
​The Micro-Habit: The very first time you catch yourself about to complain each day, stop. Take a breath. Then, force yourself to find one thing you are grateful for in that exact situation.
​""The traffic is terrible..."" -> ""...but I'm grateful I have a car and can listen to this great podcast.""
​""This project at work is so frustrating..."" -> ""...but I'm grateful to have a job that challenges me.""
​This isn’t about toxic positivity. It’s about training your brain to stop seeing problems and start seeing possibilities.
​The result: You slowly rewire your default emotional state from frustration to appreciation. This has a profound impact on your happiness and resilience.
​4. The ""Next Physical Action"" Note: From Dreamer to Doer
​The Problem: Big goals are paralyzing. ""Start a business"" or ""Get in shape"" are so vague that we don't know where to begin. So, we do nothing.
​The Micro-Habit: For any goal, big or small, ask yourself: ""What is the very next, tiny, physical action I can take?"" Don’t map out the entire 100-step plan. Just identify the first step.
​Goal: ""Write a book."" -> Next Action: ""Open a new document and write one sentence.""
​Goal: ""Run a marathon."" -> Next Action: ""Put on my running shoes and walk out the front door.""
​Goal: ""Start a podcast."" -> Next Action: ""Google 'how to record a podcast on your phone'.""
​The result: This habit dissolves overwhelm. It makes any goal feel achievable by breaking it down into a single, manageable action. It builds a powerful bias toward starting.
​5. The Connection Query: Choose Depth Over Likes
​The Problem: We are more connected than ever, yet many of us feel deeply lonely. We trade meaningful conversation for passive ""likes"" and shallow comments.
​The Micro-Habit: Once a day, send a text or message to a friend or family member with the sole purpose of making them feel seen. Don't just send a meme. Ask a genuine, open-ended question.
​Instead of ""What's up?"", try ""I saw [this thing] and it made me think of you. How have you been feeling lately?""
​Instead of just liking their photo, try ""That trip looked amazing! What was your favorite single moment from it?""
​The result: You actively nurture your most important relationships. This small investment in human connection pays the highest dividends for your long-term happiness and well-being.
​The Future is Built on Micro-Decisions
​You don't need more motivation or a magical productivity app. You just need to get 1% better every day.
​These five habits aren't life-shattering on their own. But practiced over six months, they will compound into a person you barely recognize—a person who learns continuously, acts decisively, thinks positively, makes progress, and feels deeply connected.
​Start with one. Just one. The journey to an extraordinary life begins with a single, micro-step.
​If you found this valuable, a few claps 👏 would mean the world. Follow me for more practical ideas on personal growth and intentional living.

It’s been sitting with me for a long time.

We were together for three years. Everyone thought he was the nicest guy polite, smart, well-spoken. My parents liked him. My friends said he seemed mature. I believed it too, at first. He never yelled at me. Never hit me. So for the longest time, I convinced myself it wasn’t abuse. He even used to say it himself, anytime I got upset, I’ve never touched you. Don’t act like you’re some victim.

But the damage was there. Just harder to name.

He never wanted me to go anywhere without him. He said it was because he missed me. At first it felt sweet like he just loved being around me. But over time, it turned into him getting annoyed when I saw my friends. If I made plans without asking, he’d go cold. Like silent treatment cold. One time I went out for coffee with a coworker a girl, not that it should matter, and when I got home, he was sitting in the dark and just said, Glad you made it back. That was it. The next day, he ignored me completely.

I ended up slowly cutting people off without even meaning to. I was so exhausted trying to keep the peace. He had this way of making me feel like everything I did was somehow selfish or inconsiderate. He’d say things like, I guess your job matters more than I do, or, You always have time for other people.  So I started giving all my time to him. And even then, it was never enough.

The part that really messed me up was how he twisted things. He’d say something mean, and when I reacted, he’d say I was being dramatic. Or that I always take things the wrong way. Once, during an argument, I was crying  like properly shaking and he just laughed and said, Wow, you love playing the victim. That moment still plays in my head more than I’d like to admit.

But he never hit me. So I kept thinking, Is this really abuse? Or am I just taking it to heart?

The turning point came after we had a fight because I made him late for a dinner with friends. I know it sounds small. But he was so cold, so cruel about it like I had done it to spite him. He didn’t speak to me for two days. I ended up apologizing, crying, just to get him to hold my hand again. That night, I looked in the mirror and didn’t even recognize myself. I looked tired, hollow. And I felt so small.

It still took me months to leave. But when I did, it wasn’t dramatic. I packed a bag while he was at work, left a note, and never went back. He texted me once a few weeks later, Hope you’re happy now. I never replied.

It’s been almost a year. I still second-guess myself. Still find myself apologizing for things that aren’t my fault. But I’m slowly learning that I don’t have to shrink to be loved. That I can take up space. That silence is not peace. That not being hit is not the same thing as being safe.

I don’t know who needs to hear this, but if you’re confused right now if you’re trying to justify someone’s behavior because they’ve never touched you please know that emotional abuse is real. It’s valid. And you deserve better.

1o29m8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1o29m8x/what_firms_should_you_target_first_for_networking/,What Firms Should You Target First for Networking & Applications? A Guide For 1L's,"**Hiya recruits!** 

Every year around the start of recruiting season, there is the same wave of posts and DMs:

“There are *so many* firms. Where do I even start?”  
“Do I network with all V100/AmLaw200 on my list?”  
“Is there a ‘priority order’ for networking with firms? Because there is no way I'm going to be able to network with all of them and still do well in school”

Extremely fair questions! 

And the truth is, **yes**, there’s a method to the madness. You don’t need to network with *every* firm (and certainly not right away), but the *order* in which you focus your time **can** make a difference in how much face time you have with each firm through the process, and more importantly, make a difference as you try to suss out which firm is a better fit for you at the end of the day.

Ultimately, some firms move lightning-fast. Others wait months. Some hire mostly from your school; others rarely do. 

**The key is to build early relationships where your effort will statistically pay off the most.**

So with that in mind, here's how to think about *who to prioritize first* 👇

# 🕐 1. Firms That Move or Offer Early

Every cycle, a handful of firms start reviewing, interviewing, and even **offering** before others have fully opened their portals. These are the firms you want to have on your radar *now*, not later.

For example, in previous years we've seen **Sidley, Ropes, Kirkland, Latham** (among others) both interview and fill classes wildly early. They don’t always advertise it — but they start reviewing quickly once apps hit their system.

If you need help to know who the early movers, remember you can check the [application tracker/database](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1jsztlb/the_big_law_offer_and_timeline_tracker_a_database/) and sort to see who has has **given offers earliest** in previous years. 

Any firm that moves early is a good signal for where early networking can make a difference.

# 📈 2. Firms That Recruit Heavily from Your School

Not all firms recruit equally from every school. Some have *deep pipelines* — they trust your school’s performance, have classes with many of those students, and have a reliable GPA benchmark for offers.

Targeting these firms early means you’re building on **home-field advantage**. Even a single coffee chat can help when they’re already predisposed to your school’s candidates.

Again, if you need help to know who recruits from where, the **two ways to do this** is a) ask your career services, and b) if they're less than helpful, you check the database and filter by firm and school.

# 🌎 3. Firms That Recruit Heavily from Your Region

Geography still matters a lot in recruiting — especially early-cycle 1L and 2L outreach.  
  
Especially in non-primary markets, (think Atlanta, Houston, Seattle, etc.), firms with major offices in those cities are more likely to prioritize students with local ties.

For example, DWT's Seattle office will give a bump to students from UWashington.

Generally, recruiters and attorneys respond better when they see you’re applying with a purpose (“I grew up here, have family here, went to school here, plan to build my practice here, etc.”) versus a spray-and-pray approach.

# ⚖️ 4. Firms That Hire at the Median GPA Range

This one’s easy to overlook but super important.  
  
Right now, no one knows where their grades will land — but data will tell you which firms hire across a *wider GPA spectrum* versus those that only dip into the top 10–15%.

So even if you end up doing great (fantastic, huge brownie points), it’s smart to **lay early groundwork** with firms that are statistically friendlier to median-range GPAs at your school (just in case you end up at median, which is statistically likely). It keeps your options open once grades hit.

If you need help with this too, again you can ask your school for historical GPA data (and if they don't provide it for you), you can also use the database GPA filters show exactly which firms have hired from your school’s **median and above** range in previous cycles.

# ⚖️ 5. Bonus: Firms That Align With Your Practice Interests

If you already know you’re drawn to a particular area (say, energy, tech transactions, or white-collar litigation), prioritize firms with visible strength there. You’ll have more to talk about, and your outreach will feel more authentic.

Even a small touchpoint (“I read your firm’s client alert on SEC enforcement trends”) signals effort — and effort sticks.

# 🧭 TL;DR

Start your early networking with:  
✅ Firms that move fast or offer early  
✅ Firms that recruit heavily from your school  
✅ Firms that recruit in your region  
✅ Firms that hire within the median GPA range  
✅ Firms aligned with your interests

You don’t need to hit *every* firm ever — just be intentional about *which* ones come first. It’s not about doing more outreach; it’s about doing **smarter** and **higher quality** outreach.

1o29kgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASMRScriptHaven/comments/1o29kgk/a4a_fortunetellers_reading_for_a_curious_stranger/,[A4A] Fortune-Teller’s Reading for a Curious Stranger 🔮✨ [Tarot Cards][Fortune Teller][BF ASMR][GF ASMR][GF Roleplay][BF Roleplay][Halloween][Wholesome][Mystical],"Hello! I wrote this one for myself, but I liked it well enough that I wanted to share! Feel free to personalize this for whatever gender you'd like, or keep the pronouns gender neutral - whatever feels best for you. 

OK to use for monetized platforms like YouTube, but please do not put behind a paywall of any kind. Credit and link back to me, please. I'd love to hear these if you end up covering it!

**SYNOPSIS:** You are a fortune teller, and a curious visitor has stopped into your shop. And then promptly insults you. Psychics aren't real! But you decide to be gentle with them and give them a love reading. And then... a little crush forms, and you ask them out!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Oh, hi! Don’t just stand in the doorway, come in! 

Yeah, I know. The sign outside looks like something a shopgirl made for a bake sale in 1969, but I promise, you’re in the right place.

 This is, in fact, a fortune-teller’s parlor. A real one. Not a tourist trap. I have the gift of foresight. 

No - not every psychic is a scammer! I’m a bit offended at the claim, actually. Do you always insult people in their place of business?

It’s okay. Some of them definitely are scammers. I’ve been to a few of them. But some people also have a gift. I don’t know if I understand mine, exactly, but I try. 

And your curiosity led you here. Why don’t you keep an open mind and you can decide for yourself if I’m a grifter and a shape shifter.

 Here, sit. The chair is a little wobbly, but I like to think it adds character. And besides, if it collapses under you, that’s just the universe saying, “try a new angle.”

You’re probably nervous. Most people are when they come in here. They think I’m going to tell them something terrible, like “beware the man in the red hat.”  But that's just good life advice. Beware the man in the red hat!  
  
But anyway,  relax. I don’t do doom or gloom. I only do… well, let’s call it narrative foreshadowing. And tonight, your story is about love.

See this crystal ball? Isn’t she gorgeous? She’s like a snow globe, but instead of plastic reindeer and glitter, she shows me truths. You can look too, if you like. Don’t worry, she’s not shy. Go on, lean in. See that little shimmer? That’s your future. She’s going to tell me what’s in store for you. And I’ll act as the medium. 

*(soft shuffle of tarot cards)*

And these. These are my cards. Old friends, really. They’re dramatic, sometimes a little bossy, but they’ve never led me astray. 

And between the cards and the crystal, we’re about to get a very, very good picture of you.

You, by the way, have excellent energy. Did you know that? I don’t say that to everyone. You walked in and I thought “oOh! This one has the kind of heart people write songs about.”

*(cards lay out, four distinct taps)*

Let’s see what the universe has to say. Past, present, future. Old story, current chapter, next big twist. That’s how it works. And don’t worry, like I said, I have a strict “only good news” policy. Life is hard enough without scary fortune-tellers.

*(turning over first card)*

Ah, the Two of Cups. Look at that. My favorite card, because it’s basically shorthand for “two people meeting who just… fit.” Like puzzle pieces, or salt and caramel, or, you and someone you haven’t quite met yet. Or maybe you have met them, and you don’t know it yet. Or maybe they’re in the room with you right now.

Alright, let’s see what story the cards want to tell about you. We already have the Two of Cups, which is our big headline. That’s the kind of card that likes to announce itself with confetti and a marching band. It says, “Guess what? Something wonderful is going to happen. Someone wonderful.”

*(card turned over, a soft tap on the table)*

Here in the past position. The Hermit.

Okay, don’t panic. This doesn’t mean you’re destined to live alone in a cave with only a lantern for company. It just means you’ve been on your own, figuring things out. Maybe you’ve been a little shy about love, or cautious. Like you’ve lost your heart by burying it deep beneath an iron sea. 

Maybe it hasn’t come easily. The Hermit says you’ve been searching for something… but more importantly, you’ve been learning what you need. And I think you’ve found it.

*(gentle pause, voice lowers with warmth)*

You’ve found… that you deserve someone who sees you. Someone who makes you feel less like a question mark and more like an exclamation point.

*(shuffles another card, taps table again)*

Now, ah, here we are. Present card. The Lovers. I mean, come on. That’s almost too on the nose, don’t you think? But here it is anyway, bold as brass. And what it says is: you’re ready. No more caves, no more waiting. The world is basically nudging you… almost pushing you towards connection. And it looks good on you, by the way.

I can practically hear the soundtrack swelling in the background. Some 80s ballad, probably. You’ll find her and you’ll stand outside her door, and blast (insert artist of your choice) or Vampire Weekend out the boom box to get her attention. You won’t leave until she comes downstairs. 

Yeah, that Stubborn kind of love. 

Don’t worry, I won’t sing it at you. Unless you want me to.

*(last card turned over)*

And the future…. 

The Star! My favorite. The Star is about hope, renewal, and trust. The Star is what happens when you’ve been through the storm and you finally look up and realize the sky is clear and endless.

When the stars exploded billions of years ago, they formed everything that is this world. The moon, the trees, everything we know is stardust. So don't forget. You are stardust

Yes, that’s a Richard Linklater quote.

Wait you don’t know him? Side note - go check out Waking Life. I think you’ll really like it. 

But that line is from my favorite movie. No I’m not going to tell you what it is. You think I’m just going to hand you everything on a silver tray? Try again. 

Anyway, the star is the universe’s way of telling you: love isn’t just coming, it’s going to heal you. It’s going to feel like light in places you didn’t even realize were dark.

So here’s your fortune: you’re not only going to fall in love. You’re going to be loved back. 

Completely. Fiercely. Kindly. It will feel like all of the love you’ve given has come back to you in the form of one person. Someone who will live and die for you, because that is their way. 

*(small pause, sound of speaker gathering the cards together, then leaning closer)*

And you know what? I believe them.

You know, the funny thing about these readings is that the cards tell me the story, but the crystal ball… she shows me the details. Like a trailer for the movie of your life. Sometimes it’s a little fuzzy, like watching TV through bad reception. But tonight, it's super clear. Crystal.

I see you. And someone else. There’s laughter. A lot of it. I’m getting flashes of different scenes. 

You’re walking side by side down a street with leaves scattered everywhere. October, definitely October. 

You’re holding a coffee in one hand, and their hand in the other. And you can’t stop smiling, because being together feels effortless. Like breathing. Love is like oxygen, you know. A many splendid thing. 

I see a non-traditional wedding. One where the dog is the ring bearer and there’s a guardian spirit in the form of a mountain in the background. It’s fall. Or winter. Or spring. There’s an old lodge, and a handful of close friends. One of whom they call brother. 

Your best man has a semicolon tattoo on his wrist. Their brother’s husband. 

Am I getting a little too Brother Father Oscar on you? I’ll reel it back in. *^((Author's note - this is an Arrested Development reference. If you don't get it or don't like it feel free to remove the last two lines))* 

*(taps gently on the glass, a little chuckle)*

I see you sharing secrets late at night, the kind you never thought you’d say out loud. I see you being loved for exactly who you are, without editing yourself from fear or compromising on what you want. 

It’s a very, very good fortune.

*(leans closer, conspiratorial whisper)*

And…alright, don’t tell anyone I said this, but sometimes the crystal ball gets personal. It nudges me. 

Tonight, it’s saying something like… “maybe you should stop waiting for fate, and start making your own.”

So. Here’s me doing something wildly unprofessional. 

Ech hem!

I think we’d get along. Really well. Would you… want to go out with me sometime? Nothing fancy. Just a cup of tea, maybe a walk. You, me, and a sky full of stars.

The ball seems to think it’s a good idea. And who are we to ignore the musings of a crystal ball?

There. That’s your fortune. Love, laughter, and someone who sees you. 

And maybe, if you want, a first date.

*(cards gather softly, candle flickers, fade out)*

I'm starting a campaign to receive support for my creative work and am trying to find the best platform for both one-off tips/donations and membership tiers.
My main concern is privacy. I've read that platforms using direct payments (like Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee) might end up sharing my legal name and/or residential address with supporters via the payment processor (e.g., PayPal or Stripe) on the transaction receipt.
Since I want to protect my personal information as much as possible, I'm reaching out to this community for advice:
Is this Ko-fi/BMC privacy concern accurate? Do supporters genuinely see my actual legal information (name, address) on the PayPal or Stripe transaction statements when they send a tip?
Which platform (Patreon, Buy Me a Coffee, or other) offers the best protection by acting as a payment intermediary to ensure my private legal data doesn't get shared with supporters?
Are there any known workarounds for Ko-fi/BMC (e.g., using specific PayPal/Stripe account settings, like a business account) to hide this sensitive information?

We have been there for each other through many life events. We also regularly go months without talking, then when we see each other pick up right where we left off. In May her mom passed away. A mutual friend reached out and told me. I immediately texted her “Hey. I heard that your mom passed. I love you. I’m thinking about you. If you need anything I’m here.” She replied “I love you 💜” Two weeks later another friend came into town to see her and we all went out to brunch and the farmers market. I hugged her and asked how she was doing but didn’t specifically bring up her mom’s passing. We went to brunch again alone after that in June. We spoke about her mom more and how she was able to go spend some time with her before she passed. 

I haven’t seen her since then. I was accepted into a rigorous 2-year academic program that started in August. I have been very busy with school and work so I didn’t think anything of it. I got a coffee with another mutual friend yesterday who told me Sandy had said that I didn’t reach out after her mom died and I don’t talk to her anymore. I am not sure how to proceed. I’m more concerned that she feels that way about me than anything else. I reached out to her after speaking with our friend and said “Hey! I miss you. Hope you’re doing alright. Want to get together this weekend?” She replied “Hi. I’d love to but I’m out of town. Maybe we can do something later on.” I replied “Sounds good. Let me know when you’re back in town. Safe travels.” So everything still seems “normal.”

This friendship is important to me and I am not good at navigating conflict. I don’t want to create drama where there is none but I also don’t want to leave my friend feeling like I don’t care. Is there a way to bring this up naturally? Or should I just tell her what our friend said and apologize for leaving her feeling that way? ",1,1760024675.0,friendship,2,1.0,False

Here’s what I ate today:

Breakfast: 2 Weetabix with 250ml semi-skimmed milk

Snack: 1 banana + 2 boiled eggs

Lunch: Salmon fillet, small portion of roast potatoes, boiled veg


Snack: 30g Protein Works whey with 250ml semi-skimmed milk

Dinner: Same as lunch (salmon, roast potatoes, boiled veg)

Evening snack: 1 slice of toast with peanut butter

Hydration: ~3L water, 1 coffee


Totals (approx):

Calories: ~1,600 kcal

Protein: ~125g

Carbs: ~130g

Fat: ~58g


I train 3–4x a week (weights) and walk a fair bit during the day.

1o29912,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/1o29912/weeks_of_pain_suddenly_instant_relief/,"Weeks of pain, suddenly instant relief","Reinjured my back dead lifting, I pulled my lower back center, in three days that pain shifted to my left side and full blown sciatica and L5-S1 where I’ve always had issues. 

I kept moving and it progressively got worse until I couldn’t walk and each morning before work, I would wake up 2hrs before and force circulation through light impossible walking and exercises. 

My doctor gave me 5 days of a steroid, which was the only thing that helped, I still was in pain 2hrs in the morning and then night time was tragically painful but throughout the day I could walk. 

I also take an anti inflammatory and Pregabalin which on their own had very little noticeable effect. 

The night before my last steroid pill, I needed to be on my feet for an event for 12hrs. The entire time I was in a back brace sucked in with misery. 

The next morning, brutal pain, crawling to the kitchen on my hands and knees to make a coffee. I lied back down with my heating pad and someone was at the door and I got up leading with my WEAK side and felt “something” much higher in my back get pulled or moved and I felt instant relief, 95% better. For years, I couldn’t sneeze without feeling my back, and all the sudden no pressure, no pain. 

I’m on day 2, and still feel great but I am truly terrified of ruining this feel and it coming back. 

Has this happened to anyone? Should I be as scared as I am? Can this happen? I’m sure the discs are still bulging but something really changed and I’m really scared to push or find the pain again. 

Any recommendations? Has this happened to anyone?

I don’t want to give any advice since I think this is very unique but I would say that fasting really helped me, I ate as little as possible (lots of high protein yogurt) and I made sure not to bloat or over eat. My core is weak af and being 40lbs overweight definitely had its impacts. 

I know people are against back braces but I do think a prolonged gentle walk and daily routine with a back brace may have help correct my posture. 

I’m really unsure, but I’ll take my second day of relief and be happy for a moment but I just wanted to know if anyone has had a similar experience to give me hope that I can hold onto the relief. ",2,1760024280.0,Sciatica,0,1.0,False

 Dates back to Jan 2023, we were in the same college and this guy (let’s call him Isaac) hit me up on insta with a “hi do you go to this college too?” We had a lot of mutual followers so we started texting each other, realized we had a lot of similar interests so the conversations just went on and on. He said that he finds me really cute and is interested in knowing me more. I was his bestfriend’s roomie’s friend so he knew I existed. 

After a few weeks he was like “can I take you out for dinner?” and I said “yes but later.” We spoke to each other for close to 3 months out of which he prolly asked me out 6-7 times from breakfast to dinners to drives and I kept on postponing all of them (I had severe social anxiety back then which I communicated to him) 

He confessed his feelings that he really likes me, wants to be w me, cannot go a day without speaking to me, he wants to make me his. I told him I like him too. He even showed upto my dorm building late at night and go like “I’m here”  and I’d not go meet him lol and there was a point where he was like “just be upfront that you don’t wanna be w me, don’t play all these games” I was like bro I fr wanna meet you but I’ve anxiety, just give it some more time. 

I think he started to get tired because he’d constantly nudge me about if we’d ever see each other and the nail on the coffin was when I heard from a close friend that he was “investigating” about me by essentially asking this girl to find info about me cos he thought I was ‘sus’ and wouldn’t meet him for months so he’s worried I’m hiding something like a secret bf and I’m v antisocial so he doesn’t know much about me. I confronted him about it and the he straight up denied but he was caught red handed w evidence and he said if it’s an issue for me, he can leave as he’s tired of it going nowhere for months and he’s not interested in dating anymore. I said ok cool. Suddenly he lost his cool and he started abusing me. He was like he forced himself to like me, he was convincing himself that I’m the one for him but I’m nowhere close to what he wanted, I’m a loser, I live under a shell, people who think they know me don’t acc know me because I don’t know who I am or what I want blah blah it went on and on. He blocked me everywhere from insta to Spotify - this was March 2023. Removed all my friends months later. Would block and unblock me. Watched my stories from his spam account. It was a very emotional time for me, I didn’t realize how much I liked him until he was gone, I spent months crying over him and how we ended. 

Months later (December 2023) I reached out to him by saying hey we’re both international students and college is ending in a few months and we’d never get to see each other again. Do you wanna meet and talk and sort the fight out because we ended on really bad terms? I’m chill if you’re not up for it too, no pressure. Good luck. 

He surprisingly replied very earnestly, spoke to me like there was no drama at all, like we were old friends and was like ya let’s grab coffee blah blah. He dragged it for a month, he’d say yes and disappear, and I was like bro I don’t think this is happening so I’ll just tell you what I’d have otherwise preferred to tell you in person and I gave him an apology, explained my pov, my issues, called him out for his antics, and finally said a goodbye. He was like he wasn’t able to meet me cos he’s got a gf, they’ve been together for a month or so (idk why he even agreed to coffee or even responded in the first place to begin with in that case) and it’s inappropriate to talk to me, said sorry and was like I think you’re a good person blah blah. I left it on read and that was the last time I ever spoke to him. A month later I unsent all my messages to him and closed the chapter. This was January 2024 and marks the last time I ever spoke to him. 

I also cut off my best friend during that time because she was genuinely very toxic towards me and treated me in a horrible way and she immediately went and befriended him after lol. She was very public about it and she wanted to rub it on my face that she’s a part of his circle now. 

Anyway, Isaac saw me on campus and would keep staring at me but we never acknowledged each other. We both graduated in May 2024 and I thought that was that. Months after graduation he liked an old message of mine and turns out it was accidental as he was lurking through old chats (why would a guy w a gf even open an old chat? Idk) He’d view my stories despite him not following me so I made my account private. 

In October 2024, my ex bestfriend (the one I cut off) sent me an email, messaged me on WhatsApp using a new number, and messaged me on insta using a new account only to ask me to meet her because she really wants to talk to me. I wanted to respect what we had in the past so I met her and during the 2 hour conversation, she brought Isaac’s name up 3 times despite me telling her that I don’t want to talk about him. Towards the end of the conversation, she said “I know you don’t want to talk about Isaac but I just wanted to let you know we’ll be getting engaged in the future. He’s been flirting with me a lot, his family sent my family a proposal for marriage, they’ve been so persistent, Isaac is smitten by me and won’t leave me alone…” I was genuinely shook like what even? But I knew she wanted a reaction out of me so I kept a straight face and said “congrats!” I left sometime later and she messaged me multiple times asking to hang out  but I politely declined. 


Anyway, I left all that behind. It’s been almost 2 years since I last spoke to him. I joined hinge recently, started chatting w this guy who went to college in Canada. I was really open with him and told him that I never dated before, I spoke to a guy online for a couple months and it went nowhere, I went on a few days with this other guy but we weren’t compatible. He was very understanding and was like he dated 3 girls. After chatting for a week, we were in the middle of planning when to meet - he seemed really into me. He wanted to show me around, was making plans of me meeting his friends, figuring out a good first date spot. 


All of a sudden, he doesn’t talk to me for a day and he comes back to say “my friend Isaac told me that he knew you and spoke to you for a while. He’s my childhood friend, idk it feels weird now” I was like I didn’t know they were friends as his profile had zero trace of him and told him I never met Isaac, we’re not in touch, we texted years ago. He was acting a little uncomfortable so I told him that Isaac was getting engaged to my own ex bestie who I was friends with for years so that shows we were never a thing. The guy was dumbfounded and said “idk where you got that from but Isaac was dating this other girl until earlier this year. Someone lied to you” 

I gave him my side and told him that I don’t mind speaking to him if it’s weird for him.  He was like I’m sorry but it’ll just get too complicated. I bid him goodbye and removed him.

The thing is after ALL this drama… I never even met Isaac. I technically don’t “know” him. I just don’t know what to think. AITJ in this story? ",0,1760024228.0,AskMenAdvice,23,0.33,False

I saw the Good Earth Coffeehouse near the 6th Ave LRT station and figured I’d grab another coffee while using their washroom. Before ordering, I politely asked the barista if I could use the restroom (it was literally right beside her). She said, *“It’s not public — you’ll have to ask security across the hallway for the code.”*

So I hurry to the security desk, barely holding it together, and the guard says, *“It’s not for public use.”* I explained I wasn’t loitering — just a working guy with a genuine emergency. After repeating myself, visibly fed up, he finally took pity on me, walked me to a washroom, and unlocked it.

I get that there are issues downtown — people misusing washrooms, safety concerns, etc. But come on… it was 8 AM, I was dressed formally, and it was a *coffee shop*. If this is what someone in my situation has to go through, imagine how much worse it could be for others — especially women, seniors, or anyone with medical conditions.

1o296w1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1o296w1/eating_causes_seizures/,Eating causes seizures?,"Hello all, first post here. English is not my first language, so bear with me.


I've had small ""seizures"" (if you could call them that) for last 10 years if I drank too much coffee/tea (above 10 grams per day): first a feeling of deja vu, followed by a brief/light blackout and having hard time speaking for a couple of minutes at most. No problem with consciousness, only can't ""remember"" the right word for the object/concept I want to mention. I've had no real problems with them until this year.


About 8 months ago I've had two very bad seizures during my sleep which made me bite my cheeks, fall from bed and so on. I thought I drank too much coffee along with not enough sleep etc. But then I noticed that when I ate certain foods (e.g. vinegar, pickles, pastries, tacos) I started seeing ""flashing lights"" in my eyes, especially when I first woke up. Then again noticed that if I ate foods waited a day or two in the fridge (rice, eggplant etc) or drank herbal teas they gave me a very bad mood almost immediately. Bad mood went away again almost immediately next day, after toilet (sorry for details). 


In the following months, I had bad seizures again (one of them being 3 in one night, 5 in total following each other) and I noticed I had them after drinking coffee and eating above mentioned foods the same day (especially pickles and pastries). They first gave me mood disorders (e.g. getting unreasonably angry/sad, or waking up with loud laughs in the morning without any reason), followed by seizures at most after a couple of days. 


I talked to six different neurologists. All of them basically said the same thing *""We know that drinking alcohol or too much caffeine may trigger seizures; but eating food or drinking herbal teas should not do so. Food does not trigger seizures, absence of it does.""*. On the other hand all of them were sure that these seizures were epilepsy (they checked my EEG and MRI after hearing the symptoms). 


What's going on? Could it be that I have something different? A brain ct scan said I've had chronic ischemia; an abdominal ultrasonography said hepatic veins were plump(?); a lung ct scan said I've ground glass dansities which might be vasculitis. I have problems with blood flow all over my body (especially in the hands and feet). Could something else be going on, what else should I consider?

1o294d4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1o294d4/were_my_boundaries_crossed_tw/,Were my boundaries crossed? [TW],"M33 here. Diagnosed with CPTSD and I often find it difficult to even recognise my own boundaries or needs and end up fawning. I'm currently working on it in therapy, but obviously still have work to do.

I've been seeing a 42-year-old woman and we had three dates over the span of the past months. We connected on a dating app where she stated that she was looking for sex, no strings attached. Our first date started in a park, she was attractive. She then invited me to her place, had wine ready, was warm and caring. I enjoyed the attention but never felt romantic feelings. It was also the first time dating someone older than me, I usually date people around my own age.

Our third date last week felt very different. She prepared a full dinner even though I told her I wasn't hungry. I thought she was cooking for herself, so I didn't stop her, but then she barely ate herself. We drank wine and talked. She said she'd looked up my band online, called me magical, gifted me a pair of gloves. In hindsight she knew way too many details and was making waaaaay too much effort for a casual date.

Again, I felt flattered instead of seeing the red flags. I interpreted the caring energy as kindness, maybe she was a bit lonely. At that point we had been talking for hours. I honestly was there for the sex so I tried to kiss her, but she didn't seem to be into it like during the previous dates. I figured maybe she just wasn't in the mood and respected her cues. I thought maybe it was time to go home. At this point she had been controlling the events of the whole evening.

Eventually she started making out, led me to her bed. We were both quite tipsy. When we were naked she said: ""We can have sex without a condom, I'm on birth control and just got tested... unless you have a lot of sexual partners"". I said we probably shouldn't but she said that it would be okay. After a few minutes, I asked again: ""Are you sure this is a good idea? I think I should get a condom"". She seemed annoyed and replied that it's impossible for her to get pregnant, but if I might have STDs, I can go and get one. In that moment, something switched in me and I felt like I had no choice but to continue? I was tipsy, and I felt like I couldn't disagree, and getting a condom would have felt admitting that I have STDs or creating a conflict. I had no more trains home so I had to spend the night there. So I just froze and let it happen and felt awful and disgusted afterwards. Because I could have physically stopped her, I'm twice her size, but somehow I didn't? I didn't say no, but I also never said yes.

I usually make sure a partner is always super comfortable and ask for enthusiastic consent at every step, so this has shaken me. I feel like I should have prevented it more, especially as a man.

When I tried to sleep, she kept talking and touching me even after I said I wanted to rest. In the morning she cooked breakfast although I said I wasn’t hungry. The next morning she asked me if I want to meet her for coffee to talk about us.

Am I making it a bigger deal than it is? As a man, I'm really doubting myself.",3,1760023987.0,CPTSD,2,1.0,False

I'm very aware these things have a few mg of caffeine but I really didn't think such a small amount would effect me?

Appreciate any advice.","My husband and I bought our first home 6 months ago and I’ve pretty much only ever felt worse about it since buying it. We’ve been married now for just over 1 year, but together for 6. I think we’re at a particularly low point at the moment because we’re in the middle of a kitchen renovation in which we took out everything except the drywall. For context I’m 29 and my husband is 32. We really wanted to be in a specific location in a really desirable neighborhood. Average home price is over a million here and it’s a lot of historic homes. Located in Denver, CO.

I feel like my husband and I had such different priorities when buying. He was super excited about our lot size and all the potential the home has. I just really wanted 3 bedrooms and a double sink in the main bathroom. When we first toured the home all I could see was cosmetic issues. The home was built in 1937 and previous a rental for over a decade. Old peeling poorly applied white paint everywhere. Only 2 bedrooms, 1 tiny bathroom on the main level and 1 basement bathroom. Nice big backyard but terrible dead landscaping with no grass, just weeds. A few nice trees. When we saw it I told my husband I didn’t like it. I said it needed so much work. But my husband was super excited about it and said it was the one and that we could fix it up. I feel like I ignored my gut and was afraid it was the best we could get for our budget in this neighborhood. It wasn’t cheap either but we could afford it, and it was in an excellent location. It also appraised for 20k more than we paid so that was nice. 

6 months later it’s ours. And boy is it ours - our problem. All the things I hated when we first toured are glaring in my face every day. We’re currently deep into a kitchen renovation so I think that’s a big part of why I feel so shitty right now. 

I absolutely love our location I know this home isn’t all bad. We walk to shops, restaurants, coffee shops. We’re so happy in this location. My poor husband doesn’t deserve my contempt for this home I just can’t help how I feel. It’s his first house too and he’s happy here. I’m just miserable with how small it is. Tiny bathroom we squeeze past each other in, tiny closets. He knows it’s not a forever home (without popping the top) but he wants us to live here for 5-8 years. I can’t even picture having kids here and the thought of having to move with young kids sounds miserable. I feel like we’re sinking every spare penny we have into this house and blowing so much money. It’s painful to think about. 

I just feel like he totally ignored so many practical things needed in a home to raise a family in and bulldozed my opinions and pressured me into this house. He insisted it was a great home, he was so excited about it, and I was scared to take that away from him. Now we’re in it and with the economy and housing market we’re in it for the long haul probably. My husband and I have had a few fights over it, he says when I criticize the house it makes him feel bad about how hard he works for us. And I feel terrible too but the fact remains the house is too small. After one bad fight he said we can expedite renovations of adding a third bedroom but I know that will be an insanely high cost and who knows if it’s realistically going to happen. I don’t want my marriage to fall apart over this stupid house. 

The house has a lot of positives and I’m trying so hard to focus on that but I’ve been wanting a guest bedroom for my entire adult life and I didn’t get that. I feel like we’re sinking so much money into this house and a similar house to ours specs wise went on the market for 100k less than we spent. 

I could just really use some words of encouragement right now. I know this is Reddit so I’ll get called childish and ripped to shreds for this but I can’t help how I feel and there’s gotta be people who’ve been in similar situations who can relate.

I (37F) just celebrated my bday last night. Hubby took me out and we had a great time. Our 1st anniversary was last month. I got sick and ended up getting up early at like 5am. While making coffee, his work phone went off 3 times with texts. So naturally I went to go check it. I found new messages from a girl that looked like a response to messages that weren’t there. So I ventured into his deleted texts and found dozens of different people who he was texting/sexting and planning meet-ups with all while he’s been “at work”. I went upstairs immediately and he was awake, on his phone and I demanded to see his phone. He was shocked and asked me “why, what’s wrong?” And wouldn’t give me his phone. And I kept asking calmly for his phone. Finally I asked him “who is idania?” And told him again to give me his phone. He handed it over and I don’t think ge realized that deleted doesn’t mean permanently deleted. Guess what I found? I couldn’t even count. There were so many women. Back story: our sex life has been suffering because we bought a business last year before we got married and he basically runs it - never wants me to go work there (now I know why), and comes home so late that we just aren’t intimate. It has been an ongoing fight for me with him, and the harsh reality slapped me in the face this morning. From texts, to phone calls that I obviously have no access to, to exchanging pics, etc. my whole world has been turned upside down.

He swears up and down that he never met up with any of these women and that this was all “innocent” (don’t worry, I corrected him), and told me he wasn’t sure how to tell me but before he met me he was a sex addict. So this has been going on since we met. He said he’s disgusted with himself and he wants help. After being lied to for so many years, I don’t feel like I can trust him or believe the words he says. I’ve been noting but the most loyal girlfriend, fiancé, wife, and all I got was this bullahit in return happening behind my back to explode in my face.

I was a RN in Canada, had a great job lined up in Dubai, and left it all to be with him because he was really everything I wanted. Little did I know about this skeleton in his closet.

I didn’t bring my license here. I do have a little side gig but it’s not enough to live off of. If I go back to Canada, I think I’ve been out of practice so long that I would need to go back to school.

I’m so lost. I feel like I’m in a tornado and I can’t see. I need advice.


TL;DR: I found out my husband has been cheating on me with multiple women. I feel like I need to leave. I don’t have an exit plan and need advice.

1o28vjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSU/comments/1o28vjs/feedback_on_parents_weekend_at_sdsu/,Feedback on Parents Weekend at SDSU,"I just got back from visiting my daughter for Parent's Weekend. In general, I'm pretty impressed with SDSU and their ability to create community despite it being a large public university. I also was impressed with the students and how supportive and kind they seemed to each other. However, I wasn't that impressed with parents weekend. I've talked with SDSU administrators who are open to revamping parents weekend. 

So reddit?  What ideas do you have to make SDSU parents weekend better? Also, do you like or dislike some of the ideas I have below? Particularly as it relates to engagement and interaction with SDSU in general and as an academic institution in particular. 

My experience at parents weekend was:

1. getting dragged to fairly disorganized fraternity tailgate parties

2. attending a great football game, but with the home side seats mostly empty (the end zone sections were full because that was the best pricing options that parents selected the most)

3. Going to the official SDSU brunch with pretty bad spinach mini quiches, great coffee and a great lecture about the history of SDSU, which was very interesting

4. Going to a sorority event, which was a lot of watching our daughter take pictures with friends

5. Doing stuff on our own with our daughter around San Diego

6. Free kayaking/paddle boarding at SDSU boating center in Mission Bay, which was relaxing and enjoyable

7. One of the best things we did was an event on Shellfish as part of San Diego Climate Week with 8 rapid fire presentations about the health of shellfish and how shellfish can be a sustainable staple protein in our diet

It was great to see our daughter and meet her new friends, but overall the weekend was less than it could be. Besides the lecture, I don't feel I really engaged with SDSU.

Some ideas I have are:

1. ask professors to volunteer to have parents attend their classes on Thursday or Friday

2. a lecture just for parents on Friday on AI or another current topic and it could be a panel not a lecture

3. Matches against some of the club teams like soccer or lacrosse or ultimate frisbee or golf - I imagine a lot of parents would enjoy it and I felt pretty inactive all weekend. I'll go out on a limb and say that I bet parents could hold their own with the SDSU mens/womens club soccer teams respectively but even if we couldn't it would be fun for all. Another idea is a run with the running club for parents. I asked the running club about this because they were at the student organization expo we passed and they liked the idea. I doubt though they got any new student members, which was the point of a student org expo.

4. SDSU theater/ballet/orchestra performance scheduled for parents weekend. I was really surprised this wasn't on the agenda.

5. Campus scavenger hunt with things like the brick oven from the original downtwon buildings or the benches made in the 30s by the Work Progress Administration or a picture of the only national championship an SDSU team has won (it's volley ball 50 years ago) or around San Diego like the Lationo murals under the highway or the suspension bridge near Balboa Park. 

6. Trivia event about SDSU 

7. Community service event

8. Getting rid of most of the presentations on student life or entreneurship or Student Disability services - these were largely the same as admitted student weekend events where they are more appropriate. Parents weekend should be less talks about services and more interactive events. I don't think the presentations were well attended.  I mean isn't everyone who is interested in the Weber Honors College already a part of it? How does having an open house for Weber on parents weekend enrich parents weekend?

I could be out and about and out of nowhere suddenly feel like I've got the worst hangover of my life and be on the floor feeling sick, for about 3/4 hours.. sometimes even throwing up it's so bad. 

I usually just have a morning coffee but after an incident following a trip to the coffee shop I've made the connection.. every time this has happened I've met someone for a coffee, had an energy drink or had multiple coffees/cokes on that day! 

So that got me thinking.. do I have a caffeine sensitivity and can it really make me feel this bad? 

I stopped caffeine 2 weeks ago and the first few days were rough but then I felt pretty good after that.. but this past week I had a couple of moments feeling weak and sick again. 1 time I tried a decaf tea in the morning and the other time was about 2 days after having a hot chocolate.. I'm very aware these things have a few mg of caffeine but I really didn't think such a small amount would effect me?

Apologies for the yap, just putting everything out there to see if others have had a similar reaction and if even a incy bit of caffeine can still make you feel sick?

1o28thp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterOpening/comments/1o28thp/reveal_how_well_tillbrook_plexiglass_cleaner/,Reveal How Well Tillbrook Plexiglass Cleaner Works on Surfaces,"Testing out the Tillbrook Plexiglass Cleaner was surprisingly satisfying. I picked it up hoping to find something that could tame the chaos in my home, especially on those acrylic bits, display cases, and other shiny surfaces that constantly seem to attract fingerprints and smudge marks. The bottle itself feels durable and well-sized, and that 32 oz capacity? Oh, that’s just perfect for someone like me, who likes to deep-clean and wrestle with surfaces like there’s no tomorrow. Honestly, it’s like having a sidekick that’s always ready for battle.

**Ease of Use and Application**  
Using this cleaner felt like a breeze. The sprayer nozzle delivers a fine mist, covering a decent area of the surface without over-saturating it. I tested it on a plastic coffee table, my laptop screen (very carefully), and even some metal frames around the house. No streaks, no weird residue to rub off afterwards — just clean, reflective surfaces. Even my colleague, who’s got a borderline obsession with keeping his car spotless, borrowed it and reported back with glowing feedback after spritzing his dashboard and fiberglass exterior. Clearly, this cleaner doesn’t play favorites; it’s meant for nearly any non-porous surface you can think of.  

[Check Tillbrook Plexiglass Cleaner price on Amazon.](https://go.senaar.com/p/b0ddzyvtyt/)

**Strengths**  
A big win for me is the streak-free result. Shiny surfaces often scare me because they show every single imperfection after cleaning, but this cleaner tackled smudges and greasy spots without hesitation. The anti-static property stood out, too. After cleaning my acrylic shelving unit, it seemed to repel dust for an extra few days. Couple that with its non-toxic and scent-free formula, and you’re looking at something safe enough to use around pets, kids, or my ridiculously curious little nephew visiting over the weekend.

- Leaves no streaks or smudge marks  
- Designed to be non-toxic and scent-free  
- Handles various materials (acrylic, fiberglass, metal, glass, ceramics, marble, etc.) exceptionally  
- Made in the USA to uphold ethical environmental standards  

**Negatives**  
While it’s a highly capable cleaner, there’s one noticeable downside. The sprayer can occasionally feel a bit too sensitive, making it harder to control the amount dispensed on smaller surfaces. I also wish the bottle design offered clearer measuring indicators, so it’s easier to know how much product interest remains.

- Sprayer might feel over-responsive for smaller areas
- Lacks precise measurement indicators on the bottle  

**Build and Durability**  
Okay, let’s talk durability. The bottle and nozzle design feel pretty sturdy, even if you’re the type who likes to drop things (like me). Between my kids snagging it to spray down gross tablet screens and my friend keeping it in the car trunk for road trips, it stood up to multiple uses. Bonus points for how compact it is relative to the amount of cleaner packed in—compact but effective has never looked better.

**Competing Products**  
Now, if I compare this Plexiglass Cleaner to some of the bigger names in household cleaning, I’d say it more than holds its own. Brands like Rejuvenate and Weiman often dominate the market for acrylic and glass cleaners, but this one surprised me with its wide surface compatibility. While Rejuvenate is excellent for streak-free performance, it doesn’t replicate the anti-static magic that I noticed here. On the flipside, Weiman sometimes edges ahead in terms of fragrance variety, but Tillbrook’s scent-free approach wins over those averse to chemical smells. Between price and efficiency, this one walks the middle ground quite comfortably in terms of value.

**Smart Spending**  
Given that the cleaner handles everything from plastic furniture to car exteriors without faltering, I’d say you’re getting decent bang for your buck here. The versatility it offers saves me the trouble of buying half a dozen specialized surface cleaners. Sure, it’s not the cheapest option out there, but the performance justifies its price without a doubt. If you’re like me and like your purchases to pull double or even triple duty, it’s hard to find a better fit.

**Current situation:** like everyone else in this channel, would like a conversation companion on this adventure called life.

**About me:** I'm simplistic, yet optimistic. If I forget my wallet, I have my phone. If I forget my phone I have my wallet.   
I drink my coffee black, take my bourbon neat and my steaks medium rare.   
I smile at the smell of fresh cut grass and woodsmoke.   
The sounds of the city can be equally satisfying as crickets in the country.   
Random facts fill my brain for useless, but usually awkward moments in the conversation. 

In this moment, I want to be the person that sits next to you at a bar or coffee shop, strikes up a conversation and time passes surprisingly slowly. I hope that you're able to smile in a way you haven't in a long time. I hope you have a sigh of relaxation and a moment of quiet peace.

by Preston Dennett

All UFO encounters are interesting, but perhaps the most fascinating is when UFOs land and humanoids come out! Here are ten cases of UFO landings from across the world including the United States, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Spain, Norway, Finland, Scotland, France and England. They span over a period of five decades. They involve a wide variety of humanoid figures. Many are multiple witness cases. Almost all of them involve some form hard evidence such as landing traces, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, psychic effects and physiological reactions. Some include government involvement and even disturbing threats from apparent men in black.

JUL 23, 1947, PITANGA BRAZIL: Topographer Jose C. Higgins hears a high-pitched hum. Suddenly a metallic craft lands next to him and out come three beautiful ETs wearing weird spacesuits. Jose founds himself surrounded by them. To his relief, they appear to be friendly. Feeling fear, he retreats and watches them from a distance as they begin playing like small children.

AUG 1960, NEWCASTLE, NSW AUSTRALIA: Helen Aldridge is awakened by a buzzing noise coming from outside her home. Looking out the window, she sees a craft shaped like a toy top landing in her backyard. Out steps a humanoid dressed in an olive-green jumpsuit. To her shock, it climbs over her fence and approaches right up to her window.

JUL 31, 1966, PRESQUE ISLE STATE PARK, PA: When their car gets stuck in the sand, Gerald LaBelle goes for help, leaving behind Betty Klem, Doug Tibbets, Anita Haifley and her two children. Without warning, a UFO lands in the forest next to them. Police arrive and leave with Doug to investigate. At this point, a huge hairy humanoid emerges from the forest and attacks the car. Before long officers from Project Blue Book arrive to investigate.

AUG 29, 1967, CUSSAC, FRANCE: When 13-year-old Francois Delpeuch and his little sister Ann-Marie (age 9) go to retrieve the family cows, they come upon a huge glowing sphere and four small humanoids walking around beneath it. When they approach for a closer look, the strange beings notice the two children and begin floating one by one back into the craft.

FEB 5, 1971, KINNULA, FINLAND: Two forestry workers (Peter Aliranta and Esko Sneck) get the shock of their lives when a UFO lands next to them in the forest. A small 4-foot-tall being emerges and approaches Peter. When the being turns around to enter the craft, Peter rushes forward and grabs the ET by the foot. It’s a decision that he will regret for a long time.

NOV 14, 1976, WINCHESTER, ENGLAND: Joyce Bowles is driving home. Her friend Edwin Pratt is in the passenger seat. They are concerned to see a UFO dropping down from the sky ahead of them on the road. Suddenly their car steers itself off the road. When they finally get it to stop, they see a UFO blocking the roadway and humanoids looking out the windows at them. Then one emerges from the craft, walks right up to them and stares at them fixedly. Their strange adventure has only begun.

MAY 18, 1977, ELGIN, SCOTLAND: Karen McLennan and Fiona Morrison (both 10-years-old) are playing near their homes when they hear a soft humming noise in the woods. They go to investigate and come upon a landed craft. Standing next to it is a tall slender man dressed in a silvery jumpsuit. As the man walks towards them, the girls flee. When they turn around, they see the craft flying off. But when they get home, they learn there are more witnesses. And then the threats start coming in.

SEP 18, 1978, SAN GIORGIO DI NOGARO, ITALY: Railway employee Giorgio Filiputti only wants to enjoy a quiet day of fishing. But it’s not to be. He hears a strange noise and an odd breeze. Going to investigate, he comes upon a landed craft. A weird 4-foot-tall humanoid looks surprised to see Giorgio approach. He stares at Giorgio and begins to work on apparently repairing his craft.

NOV 24, 1978, GERENA, SPAIN: When four young men go hunting along the Guadiamar River, they get a lot more than they bargained for. Seeing strange lights in the forest, they come upon a landed UFO and a 7-foot-tall humanoid. The strange figure starts walking towards them. When it gets too close, the men run away in a panic. Later, strange land-traces are found.

JUL 25, 1981. STJORDAL, NORWAY: Hjordis Hokstad wants only to enjoy her morning coffee and watch the wild deer in the field behind her house. Instead she sees a landed UFO and a weird humanoid wearing a spacesuit walking around the craft. She grabs her binoculars and gets a nice close look. Little does she know, her neighbor is watching the whole thing from his house.

There is no more room for denial. The evidence for the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials is here for those with the courage to examine it. We are not alone! We are only one of many different humanoids in a universe teeming with intelligent life.

My problem I have is that the **shots are pulling way too fast** (10-15 seconds) and the **pressure doesn't go past 3** (far from the ideal 9 bar). There isn't any crema on my espresso either. Since I was using a dual-wall basket in the Breville, I used to always get crema, but I know this is an adjustment now that I'm using a single-wall basket.

I am using 17g of coffee, which I get every 3-4 weeks from a local café that grinds it finely for me, knowing my type of machine. I also have a calibrated tamper. I let the machine heat up for 15-20 minutes before making my coffee.

I thought this might get resolved by getting a grinder, since maybe the grind at the café wasn't fine enough. However, I got too excited and bought the first Baratza Encore I found for 125$ on Facebook Marketplace. Then, I realized I should have gotten the ESP version. I haven't used it yet. I know I can add a shim to it in order to get a finer grind.

So I'm wondering, **is it worth keeping the Encore or should I get the ESP?** And more importantly, **how can I make my espresso taste better/get the pressure up to 9 bar on my Lelit?**

Thank you!",13,1760023015.0,espresso,23,0.93,False
1o28ojp,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeadvice/comments/1o28ojp/disappointed_in_myself_academically/,disappointed in myself academically,"I am extremely disappointed in myself academically.  I am a freshman in university and I am afraid to admit that I am struggling to keep up.  I did dual enrollment college classes all throughout high school and currently have my associates degree.  I am not new to the workload and the time it takes to do assignments but for some reason I am struggling here.  I am living on campus in a dorm with total freedom to do whatever I want and I think that may be the issue here.  I find it so hard for me to say no to my friends when they want to hangout which results in me not finishing my assignments and I end up doing them all last minute instead of when I first get them.  I think a big issue for me is that I am not able to seperate school from home.  When I did dual enrollment classes, my commute to my local cc was roughly 20 minutes so in those 20 minutes before and after classes I was really able to decompress before I got home so I didn't feel the urge to doom scroll or do other things when I got home because I was just in the car for twenty minutes thinking to myself and calming down.  Now that I am living on campus, I only have a five minute walk from classes to my dorm so I often find myself doing anything but schoolwork.  I am going home this weekend and I am going to take the time to relax and really work on studying for my classes and doing my assignments.  I have tried studying outside of my dorm as well but everytime I do, I end up being found by my friends and being sidetracked.  I have a car on campus so I am going to try to go off campus to study in a coffee shop to hopefully get away from being found.  I am struggling to tell people 'no' when they want to hangout due to my major fomo and fear that they may no longer want to be friends if I tell them 'no'.",1,1760022998.0,collegeadvice,0,1.0,False

I had to quit coffee and tea because of allergy issues, also can't do the caffeine. So I was very excited to find a drink mix that I love so much that's moderately healthy. However I'm broke as fuck and cannot afford to buy it from there every single time.

 Dates back to Jan 2023, we were in the same college and this guy (let’s call him Isaac) hit me up on insta with a “hi do you go to this college too?” We had a lot of mutual followers so we started texting each other, realized we had a lot of similar interests so the conversations just went on and on. He said that he finds me really cute and is interested in knowing me more. 

After a few weeks he was like “can I take you out for dinner?” and I said “yes but later.” We spoke to each other for close to 3 months out of which he prolly asked me out 6-7 times from breakfast to dinners to drives and I kept on postponing all of them (I had severe social anxiety back then which I communicated to him) 

He confessed his feelings that he really likes me, wants to be w me, cannot go a day without speaking to me, he wants to make me his. I told him I like him too. He even showed upto my dorm building late at night and go like “I’m here”  and I’d not go meet him lol and there was a point where he was like “just be upfront that you don’t wanna be w me, don’t play all these games” I was like bro I fr wanna meet you but I’ve anxiety, just give it some more time. 

I think he started to get tired because he’d constantly nudge me about if we’d ever see each other and the nail on the coffin was when I heard from a close friend that he was “investigating” about me by essentially asking this girl to find info about me cos he thought I was ‘sus’ and wouldn’t meet him for months so he’s worried I’m hiding something like a secret bf and I’m v antisocial so he doesn’t know much about me. I confronted him about it and the he straight up denied but he was caught red handed w evidence and he said if it’s an issue for me, he can leave as he’s tired of it going nowhere for months and he’s not interested in dating anymore. I said ok cool. Suddenly he lost his cool and he started abusing me. He was like he forced himself to like me, he was convincing himself that I’m the one for him but I’m nowhere close to what he wanted, I’m a loser, I live under a shell, people who think they know me don’t acc know me because I don’t know who I am or what I want blah blah it went on and on. He blocked me everywhere from insta to Spotify - this was March 2023. Removed all my friends months later. Would block and unblock me. Watched my stories from his spam account. It was a very emotional time for me, I didn’t realize how much I liked him until he was gone, I spent months crying over him and how we ended. 

Months later (December 2023) I reached out to him by saying hey we’re both international students and college is ending in a few months and we’d never get to see each other again. Do you wanna meet and talk and sort the fight out because we ended on really bad terms? I’m chill if you’re not up for it too, no pressure. Good luck. 

He surprisingly replied very earnestly, spoke to me like there was no drama at all, like we were old friends and was like ya let’s grab coffee blah blah. He dragged it for a month, he’d say yes and disappear, and I was like bro I don’t think this is happening so I’ll just tell you what I’d have otherwise preferred to tell you in person and I gave him an apology, explained my pov, my issues, called him out for his antics, and finally said a goodbye. He was like he wasn’t able to meet me cos he’s got a gf, they’ve been together for a month or so (idk why he even agreed to coffee or even responded in the first place to begin with in that case) and it’s inappropriate to talk to me, said sorry and was like I think you’re a good person blah blah. I left it on read and that was the last time I ever spoke to him. A month later I unsent all my messages to him and closed the chapter. This was January 2024 and marks the last time I ever spoke to him. 

I also cut off my best friend during that time because she was genuinely very toxic towards me and treated me in a horrible way and she immediately went and befriended him after lol. She was very public about it and she wanted to rub it on my face that she’s a part of his circle now. 

Anyway, Isaac saw me on campus and would keep staring at me but we never acknowledged each other. We both graduated in May 2024 and I thought that was that. Months after graduation he liked an old message of mine and turns out it was accidental as he was lurking through old chats (why would a guy w a gf even open an old chat? Idk) He’d view my stories despite him not following me so I made my account private. 

In October 2024, my ex bestfriend (the one I cut off) sent me an email, messaged me on WhatsApp using a new number, and messaged me on insta using a new account only to ask me to meet her because she really wants to talk to me. I wanted to respect what we had in the past so I met her and during the 2 hour conversation, she brought Isaac’s name up 3 times despite me telling her that I don’t want to talk about him. Towards the end of the conversation, she said “I know you don’t want to talk about Isaac but I just wanted to let you know we’ll be getting engaged in the future. He’s been flirting with me a lot, his family sent my family a proposal for marriage, they’ve been so persistent, Isaac is smitten by me and won’t leave me alone…” I was genuinely shook like what even? But I knew she wanted a reaction out of me so I kept a straight face and said “congrats!” I left sometime later and she messaged me multiple times asking to hang out  but I politely declined. 


Anyway, I left all that behind. It’s been almost 2 years since I last spoke to him. I joined hinge recently, started chatting w this guy who went to college in Canada. I was really open with him and told him that I never dated before, I spoke to a guy online for a couple months and it went nowhere, I went on a few days with this other guy but we weren’t compatible. He was very understanding and was like he dated 3 girls. After chatting for a week, we were in the middle of planning when to meet - he seemed really into me. He wanted to show me around, was making plans of me meeting his friends, figuring out a good first date spot. 


All of a sudden, he doesn’t talk to me for a day and he comes back to say “my friend Isaac told me that he knew you and spoke to you for a while. He’s my childhood friend, idk it feels weird now” I was like I didn’t know they were friends as his profile had zero trace of him and told him I never met Isaac, we’re not in touch, we texted years ago. He was acting a little uncomfortable so I told him that Isaac was getting engaged to my own ex bestie who I was friends with for years so that shows we were never a thing. The guy was dumbfounded and said “idk where you got that from but Isaac was dating this other girl until earlier this year. Someone lied to you” 

I gave him my side and told him that I don’t mind speaking to him if it’s weird for him.  He was like I’m sorry but it’ll just get too complicated. I bid him goodbye and removed him.

The thing is after ALL this drama… I never even met Isaac. I technically don’t “know” him. I just don’t know what to think. AITJ in this story? ",4,1760022507.0,AmITheJerk,3,1.0,False

For some backstory, he has had an addiction to porn since he was a teenager. It almost ruined his relationship with me in the past. I looked through his phone one night and saw what he had been looking at (it was on Reddit). When I confronted him he kept lying and making excuses for 3 days before I got him to admit to everything. He said he didn’t want to do it and that he had an addiction. When I told him that if he ever looked again I would break up with him, he said he wouldn’t even think about it. This was a little over a year

A few days ago I woke up to him watching it next to me in the bed. When I asked him what it was he hid his phone and laid on top of it saying he was embarrassed and that it was nothing. After about an hour of me pleading, begging, and threatening him, he finally told me that he was watching porn. He said he was only watching animated things so it didn’t really count. I had to convince him to have him show me what he was watching… it wasn’t good. I wanted to go through his Reddit. In the past that is where he would get access to everything. 
Well he lied. He wasn’t just watching animated porn. He was following all types of r/louges, looking up porn artists, commenting on slide shows of women he found attractive to try and find other things from them, posting random women, and he had bought Reddit premium. The account he was using had a 1 year anniversary notification and he had previously told me that it was a recovered account from when he was a young teenager. 
Now I am not a Reddit user. I made this account a year ago when he first lied to me to catch him lying about how Reddit worked. This means that he either made that account shortly after, or that account is the one he was looking at a year ago. 

He told me that he was going to tell me. He said that he looked because he had lost his job and wasn’t in the best head space. He had lost his job only 3 months ago. I found proof on the account that showed he had made a post back in May. 

When I mentioned all these facts to him he finally admitted that he had been watching for awhile. Everytime I grabbed his phone he would get defensive and say “why don’t you trust me”. Everytime I asked him in passing if he was still looking he would say “of course not. Why would I when I have you?”.

He has been lying and manipulating me for months. 

For the past few days I have been crying in the shower, not wanting to see him, and have hardly been eating. He’s gotten me flowers, coffee, and said he’s sorry more times than I can remember. He said he’s would go see his therapist and he never wanted to hurt me and he never wanted to look in the first place. He said it wasn’t the women that turned him on but just the thought of porn. He said that every time he finished he felt horrible and wanted to tell me. 
When I asked him “why shouldn’t I break up with you”, he said “because I made a mistake and I want to prove to you that I can fix it and that I don’t look every again”.

The kitchen becomes a bustling hub of activity as three generations of family recipes come together. Kaye and her brother Todd split the main dishes: a big roast turkey and stuffing, macaroni and cheese (Kaye's favorite food in the world!), sweet potatoes, and gravy made from scratch. Kaye’s mom Jean always makes her famous green bean casserole, a recipe that's been part of family gatherings since Kaye was small. These dishes share the table with roasted vegetables, homemade cranberry sauce, and the same beloved apple and cherry pies that Kaye's grandmother used to bake. Kaye’s dad Frank is in charge of decorating the table, starting with the red and yellow flowered tablecloth that belonged to his mom. Then, as we all gather around the table—children squirming in their seats and adults smiling over the feast—we take turns sharing something we’re thankful for. It’s a moment of heartfelt connection, with stories of gratitude sparking laughter and sometimes a tear or two. Afterward, we all find our way to the couches, sinking into the cushions with full bellies, sharing more family stories and reliving cherished memories. At some point someone puts a movie on, and we end the day with most of us dozing off under blankets, kids sprawled everywhere, the smell of pie and coffee still hanging in the air while the house buzzes with the warmth of being together

Purina faces rising competition from raw and cooked products. And these aren't small companies either. [Butternut Box | B Corp](https://www.linkedin.com/company/butternut-box/) has raised £400m from private equity and it turns out that the cooked food trend is now a reality among consumers.   
  
Who would have thought that fresh food would be more popular than ultra processed kibble, huh?   
  
Aside from private equity being more dynamic than Purina, [Royal Canin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/royalcanin/) have also released a cooked food (Pretty bad btw, I call it a bunch of rice with vinegar, go look at the ingredients), and have also ''worked'' with fresh food companies such as [Marleybones](https://www.linkedin.com/company/marleybones/), who initially thought that DTC was the game to play but are now going into retail. Anyhow, Mars is also playing ball in the fresh food market.   
  
Who could have predicted that churn in pet food actually matters? CAC always needs to be smaller than LTV. Link in comments.   
  
Purina also faces deep structural challenges that stem from people actually waking up and smelling the coffee. When the most recommended Veterinary Diet (Purina HA) contains sugar, it does NOT take a genius to politely decline the bag of food your vet has told you to buy.   
  
The one thing I would ask Mr Lopez is, will you have the balls to remove sugar from your dog and cat products? Sugar in pet food is disgraceful, awful, reprehensible, shameful and indefensible.

I returned the first one because it made a dripping noise in the vaporizer area when I turned off the machine. In the silence you could hear drops falling inside. I returned it and bought another one and I still hear the same noise, so I understand that it is a normal thing for the machine.

Now my problem is that I can't make coffee CDs, they come out very sandy, and sometimes I find water inside the grounds container. Only CDs come out when I make a double espresso with maximum aroma. When I make a simple espresso, the shot comes out gritty and broken and watery. In the first one I didn't have that problem but in the second I can't adjust the grinding level or configure it so that it comes out properly.

They came out of nowhere after I tried ADHD medications. Even though I was fine after a few weeks of taking the meds so I don't actually know the cause. 

They are continous but I've seen that some medications (like Tylenol), coffee and hormonal changes before my menstrual cycle makes them worse

I've seen many cardiologists and they conclude everything was fine with my heart and couldn't even see the PVCs in the holter test. I've seen a gynecologist and basically told me that my issues are not related to my menstrual hormones (but he didn't ran any tests to verfied that). I got tired of the public health care system and went to a private endocrine. They ran some hormonal tests (thyroid) and everything was fine. Finally she told me that I could have some issues with sugar and I started a diet (with my endocrine doctor permission) without sugar, refined flours and all those stuff.

I tried for a week and realized that my PVCs were a little bit better. 

It's been hard because most food contains things that can level up the glycemic index. So I have not been able to reach an entire month without tasting something with sugar that triggers my PVCs really badly.

Anyways, I had to miss some days at uni because of how badly my PVCs were the last two times I ate something with sugar (accidently). So I went to my regular doctor so she could write me a note to give to my teacher.

Basically my doctor told me that is very likely that I don't have those issues with sugar and I should be able to eat honey and other stuff. I told her how badly I felt after eating things that contain good sugar (like vainilla)  and she basically didn't listen. She told me to take some bromazepam because is very likely that they are caused because of anxiety even though I didn't told her that I had anxiety (Which I don't really have).

I've seen many people here that have had a good experience taking bromazepam, but I read how addictive it can be. Even though my doctor told me it wasn't. I have had very bad reactions taking other regular medicines, but I wonder if it could help me. I haven't seen big changes with the diet I'm following but I guess I have to wait more time. 

I'm not trusting too much this doctor because she was very tired when I saw her and it feelt like she didn't actually understand the issues I have or heard anything I have to say and also was very invalidating towards my endocrine doctor.

But should I try with bromazepam?

A little bit ago, I was able to obtain my CSO as well. 

Working in oncology, obviously patients are incredibly scared/frustrated and looking for control. With the narrative around carbohydrates in modern diet/fitness culture, I find so many of my patients come to me with INCREDIBLY strong opinions and end up following diets like the Budwig diet. (For those unaware, won’t go into all details but they involve coffee enemas) 

I always struggle with the frustration around when approaching the dangers to these diets, a patient will just shut down and in some instances will actually laugh at me. I’ve been very cognisant of my approach and have tried to be very gentle/ not just trying to make them feel like I’m being judgemental. I find myself just wishing I could not even talk to them because I know how they’ll be.

1o288k3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o288k3,"22F, UK","hi everyone! i’ve been observing for a while so thought I’d give this a shot :)

Area of work: 
I’m in the military - I’ll leave it as that publicly! I’m also studying a degree in International Relations alongside my job. 

Hobbies/Interests: I’m an avid gym goer and love playing sport, I love the outdoors - cycling, hiking, surfing (pretty badly) kayaking & paddle boarding. I love to travel, learn about new topics, read, write and listen to music. I love exploring new cities and finding cute cafes to drink good coffee! (With oat milk of course) 

My Christian journey: 
I grew up in a Christian household, attending a Church of England church. Although I loved it, I didn’t have a personal relationship with God. During my teens, I walked away from God and lived for myself. It wasn’t until Covid lockdown in 2020 where I was at rock bottom, and realised I needed the Jesus who I’d grown up being taught about! I became a Christian for myself, and I’ve never looked back! I did a DTS with YWAM when I was 18 (perhaps controversial to some but I had a good experience) and then did a Bible school with YWAM not long after. I wouldn’t say I’m a particular denomination but I love Jesus and I want to follow Him more each day. I moved recently for work, so I’m attending two churches - Anglican and evangelical - until I decide where to go long term :) 

Who are you looking for?
A man who loves Jesus and seeks to love others. Someone with emotional and intellectual maturity, someone with integrity, who loves to laugh and go on adventures! Someone who is kind, takes care of themselves physically and mentally, likes sports / outdoors, someone who has a lot of drive, high achieving and is proactive. 
Bonus points if you own Birkenstock Bostons!

Here are some things you can do in order to survive:   
  
\- Make yourself a destination. Have different products, different brands, different treats...be different.   
  
\- STOP stocking who does not support you. [Forthglade Natural Pet Food | B Corp Certified](https://www.linkedin.com/company/forthglade/) is an excellent example of this. If a customer can buy Forthglade from their local supermarket, why would you stock it? You are killing yourself softly. What you need is returning customers TO YOUR STORE. Stocking something like Forthglade is suicidal.   
  
\- Move with the times. We started stocking [Different Dog](https://www.linkedin.com/company/different-dog/) because that's where the puck is going. [Butternut Box | B Corp](https://www.linkedin.com/company/butternut-box/) is killing pet shops, kibble companies and raw dog brands. To fight against it, consider stocking a cooked food.   
  
\- Take a stance. If you sell Wagg, Felix and Purina...are you really passionate about pets? Why would you sell sugar to dogs and cats? We created the ''wall of shame'', where customers are told that we leave money on the table by not stocking these brands, but that we take pride in selling what we sell. It works for us.   
  
\- Buy in bulk (if you can). Lately, the only way to make money is to buy offers when you can. Save up, and when offers come pounce on them.   
  
We are being fucked by Butternut and other VC-backed DTC companies, by business rates, VAT, wages, Veterinarians selling Purina HA with sugar in it, by your local supermarket selling [Scrumbles](https://www.linkedin.com/company/scrumbles/) and Forthglade...

Was suspecting I might have MS - was sent for a brain scan and it was clean.  Now that doesn't mean I 100% don't have MS but it is much less likely...which should be a good thing right?  I don't want MS (or anything else) but I do wish I had a more concrete answer than burn out or it's all in my head for how I have been physically feeling for the last month + years.  I feel so selfish and insane for not just feeling pure relief...even though I would be the first person telling a friend that their feelings make sense and it's ok to feel conflicted about big things like this and so what if it is ""just"" burnout...that is legit and deserves care and patience.  

Ugh it's such a cliché - easy to dish out advice.  Hard to take it.  Especially one's own advice.

So I am here venting/journaling/being seen - since well...that would be one of the things I would recommend a friend do and is part of my pre- set plan for days like these.  But for the record, I feel like an embodiment of that cartoon of the dinosaur who is grumbling about drinking water, going for their walk, doing the right thing but not being happy about it.  I hope that artist knows how much that cartoon saves me.

Ok I know I need to be gentle with myself and that my reaction is normal and will take time to move through and I can't be perfect...but I wish the whole processing part would just ""hurry up"".  I really could stand to skip the need to ""not deny/suppress but not give into"" the feeling angry and resentful at everyone which seesaws into self-recrimination.  I am tired of doing the work and the disrupting of self-harming thoughts in ways that are not  harmful.  I know it's the right thing to do and man does my autistic side love following the rules...but the whole thing is exhausting and my ADHD side is intensely skeptical and keeps whispering that just getting really drunk or trying pot for the first time in 2 decades or maybe cutting or possibly ecstacy or sex with strangers would be - if not more effective - way more fun and satisfying.

I also hate the bagillion self care options.  Part of me is like ""yes I have a pre- made plan for moments like this that does work...but maybe I should give myself a treat and just chuck it or change it on the fly.  Maybe that would ""fix me""!!!"" (it won't...last me has proved it time and time again and future me will regret it).

Ok so plan.  

0. Talk to husband who just came down and drink coffee together.  

1. Once I post this / finish talking to husband (who is nursing his own ills today but seems much better!  Yay!)  Do a tapping meditation to help me feel safer and clearer.

2. Following my ""last things first/ eat the frog / deal with what's spinning"" principle for days like this: I will next do whatever I need to do to email work to update them.  Talk myself through the fear/can't get started/ask for help if that doesn't work/set a damn timer/write a stupidly broken down list/do the minimum/be factual/admit if I am unsure or need more info.

3. Evaluate where I am at and make a plan for the rest of the day which includes: rest, a shower, silence, bare minimum connecting with my mom and two friends who I know are worried about me, doing the dishes, and putting away the groceries we ordered (I selected the time that worked best for me), greet my kid when they are home from school. 

Ok thanks for reading.  Here I go.  I hope you have a good day and can be gentle with yourself...because if you can do a bit of it...maybe I can too.

We've got this.  I am sure we can get through today....and then tomorrow...and then well I guess we'll see what's next.

Also it’s very long… there’s a tdlr at the end but it doesn’t really show the whole thing and no one really needs to even read this but I needed To rant  

I had my first seizure a few months before I graduated high school. After that I didn’t have one for two years. I went to college during those two years and was going for a cultural studies degree since I love learning about different cultures and traveling. It’s a religious college so the degree was kinda for people who want to be a missionary but I wasnt necessarily planning on doing that. I hadnt planned to go to college because before my seizure and COVID I planned to try to get some sort of internship or job overseas. Because of the events I went to a small college 3 hours from home so that my parents could visit if anything drastic happened. We also had lived in that city before so I had people who could help me if I needed anything. 

The summer after freshman year I went on a sort of missions trip to a country for three weeks and me and two other girls lived there and got to learn some of the language, interact with locals, meet missionaries there, and just live life in that country on our own.

End of sophomore year I started having seizures again. About once every month. Had to quit my jobs and get a job on campus since I couldnt drive. That summer I went to a bigger city near us and worked with an organization that does stuff with different cultures in the city. I couldn't drive but I made a way to everything since the city was bigger and I was able to do things. 

My parents moved to my college town my junior year and my mom got a job at my college. My college is small so if your parent works there you get free tuition but not room and board since they kinda expect that you’ll live with your parents? I did not because I like being on my own and my parents like me being independent. 

Throughout this time in my college the professor for my degree left my freshman year, we didn’t have one for a semester, for a semester and a half we had a guy who wasn’t even a professor and not a good teacher at all (basically just there to teach from the books but didn’t have any other information for us), and my senior year we had a new professor. My degree requires an overseas internship your junior year where you’re basically a missionary in a sense but you’re really just following around missionaries in that country, learning the language, and living life there. The other requirements of the internship are things like a 20 page paper about the country that you’re supposed to do before you leave, another paper, a journal, updates, and then like an evaluation done by your “mentor” at the end. Because we didn’t really have a professor my junior year I couldn’t really go. I am also not good with actual school and struggle with due dates and getting stuff turned in so I failed a few classes and was behind. 

So, my senior year (this last year) the new professor and I decided I  could do my internship over the summer. This professor doesn’t really know what he’s doing. Because of my epilepsy and continual seizures my parents and I decided It would be best that I dont go overseas and try to find something else because most people wouldn’t even host me if they have to worry about me seizing. I talked to the professor and gave him a proposal to what I could do instead. I would work at a new Colombian cafe opening by a Colombian  woman and her mother and volunteer work three days a week and get paid one day a week. I would be able to learn Spanish, interact with the community, and other things that the internship requires in a way. I would also do all the paper work but would need to do the 20 page paper while doing my internship since I was starting the internship sooner than I could write a 20 page paper. He agreed and told me to write the paper about our town?? 20 pages on a town… not about Colombia or anything like that but the town… anyway, I lived on my own, fed myself, got rides to work from my bosses mom who only speaks Spanish, made relationships with the people I work with and kind of with some of the customers. During this time I had some focal seizures but that was it. My fiancé and I were also trying to plan getting married and where we would live since hes from Canada and needed to get a job for opt to live In the us with me. Because I already had this job we thought it would be best to live in this town. Basically my internship thing decided where we were living for the next year or so. 

I wasnt exactly sure when my internship ended since my professor never really kept up with me but towards what I thought Was the end I emailed him saying my papers and everything were almost done and that I’d get them done that week. He replied that it had already ended and because I didn’t get the papers in I failed the internship. He said I could Talk to the dean and see what I could do so I did. 

The dean said I could redo the internship but when I told him what I did for it since I  couldn’t go out of the country he acted surprised and didn’t see how that could be connected to ministry or different cultures at all. He asked if ik planning to live out of the country at any point and I said maybe but that right now my husband and I (we got married at this point) needed to stay here because of his visa and because we have no money. He said something like “this degree is really about going overseas and being a missionary. Have you considered switching degrees?”

I have ONE online class left along with my internship which is a whole semester and do not want to keep going to school. I don’t like school. I was basically having seizures because of stress from school. 

I told him I didn’t really want to keep going to school and that I want this degree since the other degree he mentioned was one in bible theology. My school we get double majors in bible theology and whatever other major you get. So if I graduate I would Already have a major in that and I wouldnt Want a double major in bible theology. Whats that going to help me with? At least cultural studies could help me get a job in something that’s not just religious?

I said id talk to my professor again and I emailed him asking about redoing my internship in the same place since Im still working here and my husband and I are basically living here because I had this job and he got his job because I had this job. We even got an apartment close by so I could walk. I told him if that wouldn’t work I could maybe write a report or do other things like a presentation on the other ministry things I’ve been involved in and the other cultural/missions trips I’ve been on. 

He emailed back saying he would talk to the dean and then emailed me this:

“ I understand some of your situation, and it seems that you do better in a classroom setting. The internship is a test of your ability to work and live independently, to show personal rigor and to accomplish goals. Your previous internship did not produce those outcomes.

This internship requires a 20-page paper before you begin the internship.
It requires 3 hours of formal language learning given by a qualified tutor/teacher.... this is not trying to pick up some Spanish in the kitchen.
It requires regular newsletters to a group of prayer partners and supporters. Our current intern has sent out 4 in the past 45 days.
It requires a prayer journal where you are making at least 3 entries a week. It takes discipline to do this. I read this journal at the end of the internship.
It requires a defined ministry, not just making coffee and talking to a guest here and there. Are there events at Papis that invite people to listen to music and to a talk about life or some topic that can be explored? This is typically what coffeehouse ministries do.
It requires a mentor overseeing all of these things.
And then there are final evaluations by the language teacher, the mentor and an exit interview, and a paper.

In your past attempt, none of these requirements were met. If you were to try this again, I would require every one of these to be fulfilled. That is simply the program.

I'm sending the syllabus and guidelines again.

Please think and pray about this.

I don't know what courses would be needed to complete another degree. I would recommend you do on-campus classes. For where the Lord has placed you now, that avenue toward graduation might be more fun and be a more fulfilling conclusion to your time at this college”

I am upset. Probably more than I need to be. It felt like he diminished the work I had already done and adding in things that he doesn’t even know about me. 

“The internship is a test of your ability to work and live independently”

Ok??? Ive been doing that!! Ive barely lived at home the past 4 years?? I’ve BEEN living independently. Except now I have a husband. 

“ it seems that you do better in a classroom setting.”

I’ve had 3 classes with this man! One of them I was retaking because I FAILED it. I  do horrible in classroom settings which is why I  was so excited to do this internship before seizures stopped me. 

Im so annoyed at myself and the situation. I should’ve just done better and worked harder on the papers and I could’ve passed without all this extra stuff but instead I was lazy. I mean… I was working 9 hour days 4 days a week and the other days I was doing another job so that I  could have money to  rent an apartment and eat food but still… I shouldve been able to do the work I needed to 

TL;DR:
Had to change an overseas internship for my degree because of epilepsy and did one locally with the professors permission. Professor failed me because of my missing paperwork and now basically says the internship I did wasn’t right and I shouldve done something closer to the “real thing.” Wants me to redo it the same as everyone else (even though I cant) or basically change my degree. Feels like all my effort means nothing and im not going to be able to graduate without changing my degree.",1,1760021389.0,rant,1,1.0,False

The 4 pillars I practiced
1. Micro-exposure, daily: Order coffee, ask one extra question, initiate one hello. Tiny reps, every day.
2. Breath reset on cue: 4-7-8 breathing before and during conversations to drop heart rate quickly.
3. Script then shed: Start with simple scripts for intros and transitions. Once you’re calmer, go off-script.
4. Recovery reps: If you stumble, use a fast reset line like “Sorry, lost my train of thought” and keep going. Don’t spiral.

Example micro-challenges
- Day 1: One cashier conversation, one open-ended question
- Day 7: Ask a colleague for their take on a topic
- Day 21: Join a short group chat, contribute once

What changed
- Fewer physical anxiety spikes
- Faster recovery when I stumble
- More natural flow, even with strangers

How can I get him to be comfortable sharing that with me?,"I know a lot of the posts here are about infidelity and big issues and mine seems silly but comparison, but I cannot get my BF to take his shirt off especially during sexy times. He’s very sensitive about his stomach and I find it ruins intimacy.

I met my BF through our gym. We would partner up for workouts and I found him to be so fun, so funny and charming. We would grab coffee afterwards and chat for like an hour. It all felt effortless. Seven months in and it still feels that way. There was always clearly something between us but he never made the first move. Tired of waiting, I asked him on a date. I guess caught off guard, he agreed to a date, and we went to dinner. It was amazing and we never stopped seeing one another. After our first date he texted me right away, booked new dates. He made how he felt very clear and I found his straight forwardness really refreshing. He’s everything one could hope for in a romantic partner, a person and just an all-around great guy. The only “issue” in our relationship is his steadfast refusal to be fully naked. Before we became intimate, he made “jokes” about his body that I took as jokes. He joked about having a small penis and being grotesque under his clothes. It took longer than expected for us to wind up having sex and I thought maybe he wasn’t joking. I could sense a lot of… fear(?) when we did get into bed and noticed lights went out, blankets on and the tshirt remained on. The sex has been amazing, but he still will not remove his shirt. He says it’s because he looks like a freak without a shirt.

The lengths he goes to remain unseen are astounding. If he jumps into the shower, he locks the door and when he comes out, he wears a shirt. He won’t change fully in the gym and will put a sweater on over his sweaty clothes and change at home. Even when we’re intimate, there are always some clothes on. I asked him about the doctor, and he says he will only see his doctor (a male provider) and will not allow any other person to be in the room.

He’s a well-built man with broad shoulders and nice muscles. He’s tall. He’s kind of an amazing physical package. He should be proud, but he isn’t. He has scars on his stomach. The first are from burns as a child. The other is a Mercedes Benz logo shaped incision scar from when he donated a piece of his liver to his niece a few years back. I’ve seen it once and find it very alluring. It’s manly and rough, but he yet refuses to take his shirt off.

I know some people really hate exposing their stomach, and I would never get annoyed about wearing a shirt at the beach or in a sauna. But in a dark room with your girlfriend during sex, I’d imagine it’s okay to bare yourself. He’ll always keep a T-shirt or tank top undershirt on. It looks weird.

On one occasion we had a bit too much to drink, and he took his shirt off and finally saw what he was hiding. He has a hairy chest and scars, and it was so freaking hot. The burns are indeed very visible but certainly not grotesque or scary. The incision is pretty pronounced and will never go away, but he also saved his niece’s life. When I met her, she pulled up her shirt to show me her scar and was still so proud of her uncle. It was so sweet. I wish he’d show that off with pride. I like to tell people he saved a life (I saw a photo of him in the hospital immediately after the surgery and it looked like he was hit by a truck. Tubes in his nose and arms and stomach. From his description, donating a liver is no walk in the park).

I’ve asked him a few what it’ll take to get his shirt during intimate times and he said he doesn’t want me having to see his scars or be reminded of them. I can tell you that seeing a white tank top or a t-shirt is way, way less sexy. There seems to have been some sort trauma from a past girlfriend that he’s made reference to so I can empathize. But I hate the shirt. I also feel like he doesn’t fully trust me and I know it’s my issue, but I feel a bit hurt by it… like, why won’t he trust me? We’ve been very physically intimate, but the shirt is a mood killer.

I know it sounds dumb but I'm at a loss. He knows I'm not going to dump him over this but I also liked the time his shirt was off. He should be proud, he looks good, he's in great shape and yeah he has scars they make him who he is.

tl;dr bf has two sets of scars on his stomach and he's very self-conscious. He has no reason to be self-conscious but as a result wears shirts all of the time - even during sex. I find it hard. We are such a good team and I really want to find a way to rid ourselves of the tank tops and undershirts for good.",1,1760021022.0,relationship_advice,9,1.0,False

Had about 45hrs lessons and zero private practice

Had a protein bar before hand and 2 strong coffees. About 6 cigarettes... 

Immediately started following satnav then test maneuver was forward bay park.

Faults were (from what I remember) 
Speed - Entered a 20 at 25 and took a little bit too long to slow
Gears - I think because I stalled but recovered well so only 1 minor 
Use of mirrors - pulled up on the left and checked mirrors once I stopped (silly mistake)
Positioning - took a late merge in to right hand lane but it was clear so no impact on others just should have done it sooner 

Can't believe it, thanks to everyone in the group I've been stalking daily on tips etc. 

Also not sure if it actually helped but I read it on here previously, I wore new perfume and basically every time I got a waft I checked all mirrors... 

Good luck to everyone due to do your test, if I can pass you can, let the nerves subside and remember they just want to see you can safely drive it's not an intense horrible exam, your wouldn't be letting you do it if he thought you were a shit driver, And yes wait time is forever for a new exam but you are closer than ever before, waiting a few more months is nothing in the long run (thinking this helped take the pressure off a bit)

Out and about. And you tend to notice things. What I did notice was a definite uptick in strangeness around town. What we would call head-da-ball-ness. I'll give ye a snapshot.... 

Exhibit A: one Sat morn, was sitting havin coffee outside Arch Coffee in Arundle Sq. There was a fella waiting for bus. Or so I thought. Every so often he was go across & start talkin to ppl outside Cafe nero. He would be about early 60's. Holding a Cafe nero Cup. When finished talkin he'd go back to bus stop. Then I spotted him taking a bottle of whiskey outta his shopping bag \[half empty\] & mixing with 7up. A bus came along he didnt get one. I was there for about half n hour. He was still there as I walked past him. It was 11:00am. On a Saturday morning. And there was a lot of children around.

Exhibit B; outside Trade coffee shop on Quay. Another saturday. Guy walking down Quay. Stick, Shades. And big headphones. Walking slowly. Thought he was blind. Then I saw him bend down & pick up cig butts. Didnt think anymore about it. Then about a week later was drving home from work. Stuck in traffic by Regs Tower. When what dya know but Mr Shades+Headphones is walking between the 2 lanes of traffic coming the other way! When there was a break in traffic he goes over towards a bench by the river and starts beating it with his stick and starts roaring n shouting. Mini meltdown. Meanwhile a group of tourists coming down off the plaza stop open mouthed & walk back the way they came. He sits down on bench. Screaming at any cars that pass. Unreal.

Exhibit C; a few wks ago walking thru the Park one morning on way to work. Schools are back. Plenty of people around. I could hear some talking loudly. At first I thought someone was on the phone. Then I spot where the voice is coming from. Guy in his say 30's walking through the grass carrying a folded up pop up tent. Having a full blown conversation with an imaginary friend. Really engaged in the conversation. TBH it was frightening. Some of the stuff he was saying. ""You think I am a fool, I'll show em..What do you think.. yeh I agree.. I'll do something about it soon"". Believe me he wasnt faking it. An old couple walking behind me immediately left the Park at next exit. Last I saw of him was him walking up Water Street towards DLS College.

All these incidents took place in broad daylight. At first I thought I was reading to much into it. But Ive seen it many times & when I told a few ppl they said they also have seen very odd behaviour all around the place. Some worse. Some not so. But it seems to be par for the course now. Not quite accepted but ignored. Pushed to the margins but not dealt with. Having lived in Waterford for 50yrs+ plus I would not like to see it become unsafe, sketchy & grim.

EDIT: Oh my gosh you guys THANK YOU for so much feedback!!!



*(Please forgive the formatting, I tried my best on my phone)*

My wife and I are from the southern half of Illinois and she has a birthday coming up. I have been to Chicago once but she has never been, so I’m trying to plan a surprise birthday weekend that hits a mix of quintessential Chicago attractions and other things that she will enjoy.

A bit about her: she isn’t big into sports, nor is she the type to spend hours and hours in an art or history museum reading plaques and such. She is relatively active and enjoys the outdoors, so walking and more engaging attractions are what I’m going for. Her FAVORITE food is pasta, but she also loves Ramen and Nashville Hot Chicken.  And boba, she loves boba. She enjoys romantic restaurants but is also BIG on saving money and being frugal, so no crazyyy expensive dining. Neither of us drink.

So, my plan is to take the Amtrak up on a Friday morning and back home on Sunday evening. I don’t have the hotel lined up yet, but am looking at several options based on location of our activities. Also, I plan on getting the CityPass tickets, as you’ll see that many of the things I have planned would be covered by this. All times below are approximate!

**Friday**

*Arrive at Union Station (around 11:00 AM)*

* Uber or walk to hotel in River North / Loop to drop off bags (I’ll call and confirm we can do this beforehand)

*Lunch (12:00–1:15 PM)*

* Eataly Chicago, 43 E Ohio St, this looks like a fun place to kick things off and have a bite

*Afternoon (1:30–5:00 PM)*

* Chicago Architecture River Cruise, included in the CityPass and a must-do from what I’ve seen
* Afterward, stroll the Chicago Riverwalk and grab boba or coffee at Möge Tee or Hello Jasmine
* Continue walking to Millennium Park — see Cloud Gate (The Bean), Crown Fountain, and Lurie Garden.

*Dinner (6:30 PM)*

* Lou Malnati’s, 439 N Wells St, this may get replaced by whatever catches her fancy, but seems like a pretty basic deep dish place.

*Evening (8:00 PM onward)*

* Navy Pier & Centennial Wheel, if we have energy/time, I think she’d enjoy ferris wheel.
* Optional drink or dessert at Offshore Rooftop, mostly for the vibes and experience

**Saturday**

*Morning (9:00AM – 12:15 PM)* 

* Shedd Aquarium
* Adler Planetarium
* I think she’d enjoy these two the most, MSI may not be up her alley. Both of these included in CityPass.

*Lunch (12:45 PM)*

* Niu B Ramen, close to the aquarium/planetarium and our next stops

*Afternoon (2:15–5:30 PM)*

* The Art Institute of Chicago, I know I said she doesn’t like art museums but this just looks incredible. Included in CityPass.
* Mindworks, she really enjoyed the Netflix show “100 Humans” and this looks like a cool stop IF WE HAVE TIME
* Skydeck, obvious Chicago staple, but honestly I’m fine with doing Mindworks and skipping this. Included in CityPass.

*Dinner OPTIONS (7:00 PM)*

* Quartino Ristorante, looks exactly like what she usually enjoys
* RPM Italian, a little more celebratory and romantic
* The Dearborn, if American food sounds better this evening
* ABA, farther away and maybe not what she likes but looks great
* Any other options?

**Sunday**

*Morning - Early Afternoon (9:00 – 11:45AM)*

* Lincoln Park Conservatory & Zoo – both free and seem like something we’d enjoy seeing after a nice breakfast and coffee
* Optional detour to Nature Boardwalk or North Avenue Beach for more skyline photos if weather and time allow, we’ll see when check-out is

*Lunch (1:15 PM)*

* The Budlong Hot Chicken OR
* Parson’s Chicken and Fish OR
* Fry the Coop

Anddddd that’s it! We’ll head home after that. I’m planning as much as I can so that she feels like it is a full-featured trip, but many of the attraction/dining may change based on how we’re feeling or what she’s in the mood for.

Any obvious problems? Any suggestions? Thank you all SO MUCH!!!",9,1760020448.0,AskChicago,48,1.0,False

we were having a team lunch, we were a party of about 15 people. the waiter took our orders and the entire time my colleague (who was on a strict diet hence she brings her own food to work) had her packed lunch on the table. After the waiter served the food, they told my colleague she can't eat her food there and she was asked to leave.

we were all shocked and because people's food already arrived, we couldn't leave the resto and she had to go (we accompanied her nalang since the place was like P400 for adobo flakes anyway.. how stupid lol).

We tried to do something about it though, tried to explain na she was on a diet and there are 10+ other people ordering anyway and we basically filled the entire resto by ourselves and they replied na ""respeto lang po"" like ok i see youre doing your job but like it made me think.. is it really that deep

it's a small business too.. i'm sure we weren't the only customers they lost due to that stupid policy. i messaged them about it and i explained how really.. we just wanted to enjoy a meal on our colleague's birthday. they might want to reconsider the policy since it leaves bad impressions on their business. i even gave them the benefit of the doubt na it may be much more than just a business strategy for them (like idk.. controlling the environment for their food / coffee WHICH I TOTALLY WOULD UNDERSTAND) but they just said 'it's standard.'

lowkey i really hope i'm not coming across as entitled here but it's so sad lang to think na some people who have diet restrictions due to their health are not welcome in some spaces. i just hoped for some understanding and wala parang 'go eat somewhere else' vibes sila.. eh yung bacon nga nila P200 tapos 5pcs lang mukha pang makunat huhuhuhu",1,1760020426.0,DontEatHereManila,0,1.0,False

I ordered their [Original](https://www.soulisticstore.com/products/freeze-dried-original-arabica-instant-coffee) variant and honestly... didn’t expect much. But when it arrived, I made a cup the next morning and it just hit different.

The aroma reminded me of small roasteries - rich but not overwhelming. It dissolved so cleanly, no floating bits or bitter smell. The first sip felt smooth, earthy, and almost *quiet*, if that makes sense.

Some just want privacy from trackers, others use them to watch shows from other countries, and some just want protection when they connect to public Wi-Fi. Personally, it feels less about hiding my IP and more about knowing my online activity isn’t being watched too closely. It gives a bit of peace of mind, even if you’re not doing anything sketchy.

I’m curious to know what makes other people use one. Is it for work, gaming, school, or just for casual browsing? Everyone has a slightly different reason, and that’s what makes this topic interesting to me. Some use VPNs every day like they can’t go online without it, while others just turn it on when they travel or use coffee shop Wi-Fi.

One thing I keep seeing on Reddit is people recommending “free VPN for Mac” like it’s the best option. I get that a lot of Mac users want something lightweight that won’t slow their system, but free VPNs often come with trade-offs like limited servers or weaker privacy policies. I’m wondering if people suggest them more for budget reasons or if there’s actually one that performs well enough to rival paid ones.

I’d really like to hear honest opinions. Do you think free VPNs for Mac are worth using, or is it just a shortcut people keep suggesting because it’s convenient? It’d be nice to figure out whether going free is a smart move or something that sounds good until you start noticing the downsides.",1,1760020241.0,ComputerHardware,0,1.0,False
1o27gvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o27gvd/i_shouldve_never_went_moose_hunting/,I should’ve never went moose hunting,"I'd recently won a lottery tag for a moose. In Alaska, you can't just decide to hunt moose...you have to enter a drawing system, and they only give out so many permits each year. After years of applying and never getting drawn, I finally got lucky. My name came up. I was excited as hell.
I've hunted deer, elk, turkey, duck, and the occasional hog, but the moose...that big, hulking behemoth...was the last North American game animal left on my list.
I wouldn't call myself the best hunter on God's green earth, but I'm decent enough to tag a couple of deer every year. It keeps my freezer stocked and cuts down on grocery bills, which, up here in Alaska, seem to climb higher every damn week.
And honestly? I just enjoy it. The peace and quiet. The crunch of snow or branches beneath my boots. The smell of pine. The way the world turns orange as the sun starts to rise. The white sheet of snow covered everything like a fresh canvas.
I got up earlier than I normally would for any other hunt. Even before the alarm buzzed at 4:30 AM, I was already halfway awake...too excited to sleep.
I made myself a quick breakfast. While digging through the freezer for some sausage, I noticed a couple of packs of ground venison left from last season. After today, I figured I'd be restocking...hell, I might even need to buy another freezer with all the meat I was planning to bring home.
While I ate, I pulled up the maps and checked the terrain I'd be hunting. I marked out a route that I hoped would lead me right into a moose's path. The plan was to park at the end of an old logging road I'd scouted earlier in the year. It was overgrown and barely traveled...a dead-end spur that cut into the forest like a scar and stopped just shy of a frozen creek bed. Perfect for staying off-grid and getting away from any weekend warriors crowding the main trails.
Once I finished, I suited up in my winter gear. I doubled up on thermals...because out here, you never know. I grabbed my rifle case, pack, and a thermos full of strong coffee, then stepped out into the dark morning cold.
The ATV was already strapped down in the truck bed. I'd loaded it the night before, along with my quartering kit: a couple of sharp knives, a folding bone saw, nitrile gloves, paracord, and a set of heavy-duty game bags. I also threw in a tarp to keep the meat clean while working. No chainsaw this time...I didn't need it. A handsaw would do the job if I had to cut through bone or thick brush.
I've heard too many stories about hunters getting only a few cuts off a moose before the wolves moved in. That wasn't going to happen to me.
I made it to the end of the logging road just before first light. The place was exactly how I remembered it...tight trail, no signage, nothing but the sound of snow hitting my windshield. I backed the truck into the clearing at the very end, where the road just stopped cold in a wall of trees. It felt like the edge of the world.
I unloaded the ATV, set my backpack down next to the field gear, and took out my rifle. I slung the strap across my shoulder.
The ATV gave me some trouble...no surprise with the subzero temps...but after a few tries and some choice words, it rumbled to life.
My plan of attack was simple: drive a mile or two down the trail, park, and hike a 900-yard radius around each stop. If I didn't see anything, I'd hop back on the ATV and repeat the process farther down the line.
At my first stop, I cut the engine and climbed off. That's when I noticed it.
Something felt… off.
I couldn't explain it at the time, but there was this stillness...an absence. No birds chirping. No squirrels chittering. No wind in the trees. Just the faint hiss of falling snow and the sound of my boots crunching in the powder.
It made me uneasy.
Now, I've hunted in quiet woods plenty of times. Still mornings are common up here, especially when the snow comes soft. But this was different. This wasn't just quiet. It was like the whole forest was holding its breath.
The sky hung over the treetops in a flat, steel-gray wash...sunless, cold, almost metallic. The kind of light that doesn't cast shadows, just makes everything feel dulled and distant. Even the snow felt heavier underfoot, like it was muffling all sound.
I scanned the area as I walked...looked for what I should've seen. Fresh moose tracks...big ones, the size of dinner plates. Ragged tips of willow or alder saplings where they'd been chewed down. Rubs on trunks, scat, maybe even a wallow or bedding spot tucked under the spruce.
But there was nothing.
No tracks. No breaks. No browsed tips. Just untouched snow and stillness.
At one point, I thought I heard a twig snap off to my right. I froze. Listened.
But it was gone. Just more of that heavy, dead silence.
The kind that starts to get under your skin.
Looking back, maybe I should've turned around right then. Gone home. But I told myself I was overthinking it. Overcaffeinated. Running on too little sleep.
I checked my GPS and pushed forward with the plan...another mile or two, search the area, move on. Rinse and repeat.
Four hours passed, and I hadn't seen a single sign of life. Nothing. 
The only sound was my own footsteps...and even that felt like too much noise.
And it wasn't just quiet around me...it was like the quiet was pushing inward. Pressing on my ears. On my ribs. Like something just beyond the tree line had stopped moving and was watching. Waiting.
I'm not ashamed to say it started getting to me.
I'm the kind of guy who puts on a movie or music if things get too quiet. I don't like that isolated, trapped feeling. But I'd left my headphones at home...figured the ATV was loud enough already, and the last thing I needed was to scare off a moose with AC/DC echoing through the trees.
I'd parked at the end of the logging road, just like I planned. The goal was to make a big loop...shoot early, get the hard work started while I still had daylight. If I could quarter it and haul the meat back to the truck before nightfall, I'd spend the rest of the day on prep.
But nothing was moving.
And the quiet? It wasn't letting up.
I'm a single man...for now, at least. I work general maintenance out at Eielson Air Force Base, just outside Fairbanks. Not the most glamorous job in the world, but I do it well enough, and it pays decent...especially when it comes to funding my hobbies.
I've been hunting since I was a kid. My old man started taking me out when I was maybe ten. I started with snowshoe hares and spruce grouse, then graduated to caribou and elk by the time I hit sixteen. I learned early how to gut, clean, and pack an animal...how to use every part of it, not just the cuts you see in a grocery store. Where I'm from, hunting isn't just a hobby...it's a way of life. Something passed down.
I'd call myself an ethical hunter. I don't take shots I don't intend to eat. If it doesn't feed me or someone else, I leave it be.
That said, yeah...I mount some of my kills. Not for bragging rights, really. More like a kind of respect. Honestly, and I don't usually admit this to anyone, but after I get something mounted...deer, elk, whatever...I'll pour myself a glass of whiskey, sit down with it, and say a few words. Something like, ""Thanks for feeding me. Hope I earned it.""
Being single, and hunting as much as I do, I usually end up with more meat than I need. I keep what I can use, vacuum seal it, label it by cut and date. The rest? I hand off to coworkers or a few of the airmen I know who could use it. I figure if I'm gonna take a life, it damn well better feed someone.
Most days, work on base is quiet. HVAC checks, busted lights, frozen pipes in the winter...especially in the old buildings. I keep the generators running, patch holes, fix whatever's broken. I'm not military, just a contractor, but I've been there long enough to know most of the faces. A few of the younger airmen stop by my place for a drink sometimes, swap stories, ask about hunting or fishing. The base can feel isolated if you don't find something to ground you. For me, it's the outdoors. Always has been.
This was as far out as I planned to take the ATV. I parked it at the base of a hill and figured I'd start working my way back around.
Still nothing.
I checked my phone. It was just past eleven. The snow had started to pick up...not a full whiteout, but thick enough to make me uneasy. Visibility was dropping. My boots were starting to sink a little deeper with every step.
Then I saw it.
A track.
And not just any track...a moose track.
Finally, I let out a breath I didn't know I'd been holding. Maybe this hunt wasn't a total bust after all. I knelt down for a closer look.
That's when I noticed something... off.
The print was too big. Moose tracks usually measure about five to six inches across. This one was closer to seven, maybe even more. And the shape...at first glance, it looked like a standard split hoof, but the edges were too sharp, almost claw-like. I told myself it was probably just an illusion...maybe the snow had melted weird, or maybe it had been pressed too deep and distorted.
But still... It was strange.
I followed the tracks. Another odd thing...they didn't meander like moose usually do. Moose tend to wander, grazing along the way. But this trail moved in a wide, arcing pattern, almost deliberate. Like it had a destination in mind.
I followed it for a good three-quarters of a mile, maybe more. No scat. No signs of browsing. No broken limbs. Just prints.
I should've turned back. But I told myself I'd already come this far.
Eventually, the trail cut across a steep hill. I picked my way along the slope, boots sliding a little in the fresh powder. Just past the crest, there was a small stand of spruce...and that's when I saw him.
The bull.
A massive bull moose, standing broadside about 300 yards out. He was partially obscured by the trees, but I could see enough. The antlers were the most impressive I'd ever laid eyes on...wide, thick, and twisted like old driftwood.
And tall. Taller than any moose I'd ever seen in the wild...or in photos. A normal bull, including the antlers, stands maybe seven feet. This one was at least eight and a half, maybe nine.
I let out a low whistle under my breath.
""Oh, you're definitely going on the wall,"" I thought, unslinging my .338 Win Mag.
Might sound like overkill to some, but this rifle was passed down to me. It's old, a few scratches on the stock, but it's never let me down.
I raised it to my shoulder and peered through the scope...
...and everything stopped.
The wind, what little there was, died instantly. No flakes falling. No branches creaking. Even the soft groan of trees shifting in the cold went silent. The air felt wrong...pressurized, still, like the moment before a thunderclap.
It was the kind of silence that doesn't feel natural.
It feels like the woods themselves are holding their breath.
I scanned the bull through the scope.
The body looked normal. Heavy, muscled, dark brown hide. But the head...
God, the head.
It looked almost right...but not quite. Like someone had sculpted a perfect moose head from memory, but missed something. Too smooth. Too symmetrical. The kind of wrong your brain doesn't catch at first...but once it does, it won't let go.
Then I looked at the antlers.
Each tine bent slightly inward, unnaturally curved. And the color... they weren't the pale bone-white or velvet-brown I was used to. They were dark...almost black, with a hint of crimson. Like they were wet. Like they were bleeding.
I stared. My pulse ticked up. Every instinct I had told me to walk away.
But I pushed the feeling down. Maybe it was sick. Maybe I was doing it a favor, putting it out of its misery. I figured I probably wouldn't be able to salvage much meat...but I'd at least get one hell of a mount for the den.
I adjusted my aim, settling the crosshairs just behind the front shoulder. If I hit the lungs or the heart, it would drop clean.
Finger on the trigger.
Breath held.
Ready to fire.
I had my finger on the trigger, just about to squeeze, when the bull's head snapped toward me.
And I don't mean it turned...I mean it snapped, like something grabbed it by the jaw and wrenched its skull around in a single, violent motion. One second it was facing forward, the next it was staring directly at me.
I flinched but didn't pull away from the scope.
What I saw...
God, I'll do my best to explain it.
Now that I had a full view of its face, I could see just how wrong it was. The jaw looked like it had been wired shut, but pulled too tight...so tight the lips were curled inward, distorting the snout like something that had been forcibly sealed.
But it was the eyes that froze me.
They weren't just black...they were empty. Like the entrance to a bottomless cave. No light. No soul. Just void.
Then I noticed it...a thin, vertical line running from the top of its skull down to the bottom of its jaw. Not a scar. Not a seam. Something else.
And then the whole damn head split in half.
Not just the jaw. Not just the face.
The entire head, from antler crown to throat, tore open down the middle like someone had unzipped it. Bone cracked. Flesh peeled. A wet, sinewy tear as the two halves pulled apart, flopping open to either side like wings made of skin and antler.
From inside that split head emerged a second mouth...a massive, glistening maw where no mouth should've been. It yawned open slowly, revealing rows of needle-thin spikes. Not teeth. Not even bone. They looked like obsidian spears...long, wet, and curving inward like they were made to pierce and drag.
At the base of the throat, something moved...tendrils or feelers, twitching and tasting the air like a deep-sea thing.
I stood frozen.
Every part of my brain screamed: Run.
But my legs wouldn't move. My hands wouldn't lower the rifle. I was staring at something I couldn't process...something so utterly wrong that my mind didn't know where to put it.
Then it began to rise.
The moose stood up on its hind legs...not rearing, but rising like it was becoming something else. The hooves split open, clawed digits unfolding like knives from sheaths. The legs moved apart, arms now, elbows where there shouldn't be any. It hunched like a T. rex, lurching forward in a way that mimicked a man...badly.
It took one step toward me.
Instinct took over. I squeezed the trigger.
The .338 Win Mag roared, the recoil slamming into my shoulder. The shot echoed across the forest like thunder, and for a split second, I thought I had it.
But the creature didn't fall.
It didn't even flinch.
The bullet hit it center mass...I was sure of it...but it just stood there, swaying slightly, as if I'd thrown a pebble at a mountain. No blood. No wound. Nothing.
Then it tilted its head at me, and I swear I could feel it... laughing.
Not making a sound, but the way it moved...like it was amused. Like I was a child who'd just tried to hurt something infinitely beyond my understanding.
That's when pure, animal terror took over.
And that's all I needed.
I broke from the scope, slung my rifle, and ran.
I tore through the small grove of spruce, boots slipping in the snow, branches whipping at my arms. My breath fogged in the cold, sharp and ragged in my throat.
That's when it let out a sound.
Not just a noise...a cry.
It echoed across the treeline like something from another world. My whole body went rigid mid-stride. It started low, like a bellow, then twisted upward into something high-pitched and shrill...almost like a woman screaming. Except no woman, no person, could ever make a sound like that.
It hit me like a wall of ice. My heart stopped, then kicked back in, hammering against my ribs.
And then I heard them.
Footsteps.
Not light, panicked footfalls...heavy ones. Rhythmic. Ground-shaking. Something massive, crashing through snow and brush. Closer with every beat.
I did the one thing you're never supposed to do.
I looked back.
Just a flash...dark shapes between trees, something tall and wrong moving through the forest. In that instant...between the sound, the glance, and the blind panic...I caught my foot on something under the snow.
And then I was falling.
The world flipped sideways. Snow. Trees. Sky. Then pain. My body slammed into the slope, bounced, skidded, cracked off rocks, hit roots.
I couldn't even scream. The wind was gone from my lungs after the first hit.
I must've rolled fifty feet...maybe more.
Then I hit a tree face-first, and everything went black.
I woke up.
God knows how long I'd been out...long enough to have a dusting of snow settled on my jacket and face. The cold was biting now, not the crisp kind I was used to, but the kind that gnaws at the bones.
My head throbbed. My ribs lit up like fire every time I tried to breathe. Felt like at least one was cracked...maybe more. My right hand was swollen, already going stiff. I couldn't move it without pain shooting up my arm like lightning.
For a minute, I didn't move at all. Just lay there, dazed, staring up at the gray sky bleeding snow.
Then I remembered.
The thing.
That thing was still out there.
And it had seen me.
I sat up slowly, every muscle screaming in protest. Snow shifted off my shoulders and legs as I forced myself upright and looked around.
No sign of it. No sound. Just the hush of falling snow.
I did a quick pat-down with my left hand...awkward and clumsy. My rifle was gone. Strap must've snapped during the fall. Probably left behind halfway up the hill. No chance I was going back for it.
I reached for my phone and pulled it out of my chest pocket.
Smashed.
Screen spiderwebbed. Buttons unresponsive. It looked like someone had taken a hammer to it. No signal. No emergency call. No flashlight. Nothing.
Perfect.
The snow was falling harder now...fatter flakes, faster pace. Visibility dropping again. Wind picking up.
I still had my knife, at least. Small comfort. Better than nothing. But if that thing came back? I might as well be holding a butter knife.
Then I remembered...the GPS.
I fished it out with numb fingers. The screen was cracked, but still working. Time said 3:10 p.m.
That meant I'd been out cold for hours.
I hit the map button. My saved waypoint blinked in the corner...where I parked the truck.
5.3 miles away.
Shit.
The battery light on the GPS was already flashing red. I stared at it, willing it to last just long enough. Just long enough to point me in the right direction.
I didn't dare start the ATV. Too loud. If that thing could move as fast as it looked, it'd be on me before I even turned around.
No. No engine. No trail. I had to go on foot.
As much as it killed me to admit it...I'd have to trek back to the truck. On foot. Injured. Armed with a knife.
The choice was simple: lay down and die, or survive.
And I'm not the kind of man who gives up.
Not out here. Not like this.
I turned off the GPS to save what little juice it had left, found my bearings, and started walking.
Every breath was painful...tight, shallow gasps that made my ribs scream. The cold wasn't helping. Each inhale felt like ice carving its way through my lungs.
My right hand throbbed with every heartbeat, swollen and useless. I cradled it against my chest, trying not to jar it as I moved. Every step was a test of balance and will.
I did my best to stay quiet. No snapping branches. No heavy footfalls. Just slow, deliberate movement through the snow. I couldn't risk making noise...not now. Not when I didn't know if that thing was still out there, listening.
The only silver lining...if you could call it that...was that my winter gear had probably saved my life during the fall. Layers of insulation had kept me from being shredded by rocks and branches, and they were keeping me from freezing now. Barely.
I remembered the HotHands I'd packed. Clumsily, I fished one out of my jacket pocket with my good hand. It took longer than I'd like, but I got it open, crushed the packet to activate it, and tucked it inside my inner coat lining.
Within minutes, warmth started to bloom against my chest. Dull. Faint. But it felt like fire.
It was the best thing I'd felt all day.
The questions came then, circling my thoughts like vultures.
Will I survive?
What was that thing?
Where is it now?
I couldn't understand why this was happening. Why me? What were the odds? Out of all the hunters, all the people wandering the Alaskan backcountry, I had to be the one to cross its path.
I kept walking.
Not fast...couldn't afford fast...but steady. One careful step after another, teeth gritted against the pain, eyes scanning the forest for movement.
And then, just for a moment, a memory surfaced.
My dad's voice.
Not loud. Not clear. Just the echo of something from years ago.
""Walk like you've got the weight of silence on your shoulders,"" he used to say. ""If the forest hears you, it'll never show you what you're looking for.""
I remembered him crouched beside me, deep in the brush outside Fairbanks, showing me how to step over dry twigs, and how to watch for loose snow. I was twelve. Maybe younger.
I'd always thought he meant it about animals...about moose and caribou and wolves.
But now, I think maybe he meant something else.
Time didn't mean much anymore. Could've been ten minutes or an hour. The sky was the same color as the snow, and the snow just kept falling.
And then...
I heard it.
Distant at first.
Thump.
A pause.
Thump. Thump.
Footsteps. Heavy ones. Deliberate. Too slow for a bear. Too rhythmic for a moose. It wasn't crashing...it was searching.
My chest tightened.
I hadn't heard a single animal since morning. No birds. No squirrels. No wolves. Just this thing. The forest was holding its breath again.
The sound grew louder.
Closer.
And I was still too far from the truck.
Fear hit me like a wave.
My heart started pounding so hard it felt like it was rattling my broken ribs. Every beat sent a spike of pain through my chest.
I was sweating...sweating...despite the snow falling all around me. The cold didn't even register anymore. Just the heat of panic. Of being hunted.
The footsteps grew louder. Slow. Heavy. Measured.
Thump.
Pause.
Thump-thump.
Getting closer.
I was alone. Unarmed. Bleeding. And whatever this thing was, it was still out there. Still moving toward me.
I drew my knife with my left hand. It felt small. Insignificant. I gripped the handle so tight my knuckles ached. Like that would help.
I had to hide.
I don't remember making the decision...just the movement. My body moved on instinct. I slid off the trail and slipped into a low thicket of spruce brush. The branches snagged at my coat, but I kept pushing, until I was crouched low in the center.
It was slightly warmer in there, shielded from the wind. The snow didn't fall as thick under the cover of the needles. But it was cramped. I couldn't move without brushing branches. Couldn't breathe too loud without fogging up the air around me.
That's when I realized...I was breathing too hard.
Short, rapid breaths. Panic. My chest rising and falling like a damn piston. I clamped my elbow over my mouth and nose, trying to stifle the noise. I tried to make myself smaller. Quieter. Gone.
The footsteps were close now.
Too close.
Thump.
Crack.
Thump-thump.
It was just on the other side of the trees.
Then I heard it make a sound.
Low at first. A deep rumble, like a growl buried under its breath. But it didn't rise. It didn't escalate. It just hovered there, buzzing through the air like something half-growl, half-purr.
It was hunting.
I didn't know how it hunted. Sight? Smell? Sound? Maybe all three.
I couldn't risk assuming anything. I didn't even blink. I just listened. Every second stretched out like a minute.
And still, it came closer.
I prayed that it hunted by sight.
Not smell. Not sound. Just sight.
I didn't know how it saw anything with its damn face peeled open like that...but if I stayed still, if I didn't make a sound, maybe it wouldn't notice me in the brush.
I could hear it moving through the snow now, slow and steady. Closer. The crunch of ice beneath its weight was soft but distinct...measured, like a predator on the final approach.
Then it stopped.
Right outside the bush.
I could feel its presence before I saw it...like the air had thickened, turned electric. My skin crawled. My lungs burned. I didn't dare move. Not even to blink.
And then, through the thicket, I saw it.
Its massive head lowered just beyond the branches...split wide, still in that nightmarish state. I couldn't see its eyes...not in the normal place. All I could see were the teeth. Those black, glistening spikes curling inward, and between them, twitching along the gums, were thin feelers...like antennae, or worm-like tendrils, brushing the air around them.
They moved like they were tasting.
Smelling.
Scanning.
Then it shifted, and I saw more.
Three fleshy stalks rose from the top of its skull, extending like antennae. At the end of each was a round, faceted orb...like a fly's eye, but wet and dull gray, twitching in different directions independently.
My blood ran cold.
So much for hoping it couldn't see.
And with those feelers...God, it might not even need eyes. Maybe it could taste me on the wind.
I didn't move.
Didn't breathe.
Just hoped the bush's scent and the cold air were enough to mask me. That its senses...whatever the hell they were...would pass right over me like I didn't exist.
It swayed slightly, side to side, one of the stalk-eyes tilting downward toward where I crouched.
That's when I felt it.
Breath.
A thin stream of air rolled over my face...hot, wet, wrong. It reeked of decay, like something rotten hiding beneath the snow. My eyes stung from the stench, and every muscle in my body screamed to recoil...but I couldn't.
Don't breathe. Don't blink. Don't move. Not even an inch.
The words looped in my head like a metronome.
Don't breathe. Don't blink. Don't move.
Don't breathe.
Don't breathe...
It swayed again. Closer.
The brush quivered from the motion.
And I kept repeating it. Over and over. Like a prayer to a god I wasn't sure was listening.
Don't. Breathe.
That's when I noticed it...something rising from its fur like smoke. At first, I thought it was steam from the cold air, but this wasn't natural. The haze shimmered faintly, like heat ripples above asphalt, though the air was freezing. It had a greasy, almost chemical sheen to it.
It took me a second to understand...it was releasing its scent.
The stench hit me so violently it felt like a living thing. A putrid cocktail of decomposing flesh, ammonia, and something worse...something human. Bile, maybe. The scent of a dying gut. I gagged hard, my stomach clenching like it was trying to crawl up my throat. I jerked back involuntarily.
That one small sound...that single motion...was all it needed.
Its head snapped toward me.
Those empty voids where eyes should be burned through the branches, locking onto mine.
I froze.
It had done this on purpose. The stench was bait...an invisible net to make me flinch.
It began to move toward me, slow and deliberate. Every step it took was silent, but the forest around it seemed to recoil, as if the trees themselves wanted no part of what was coming. A trail of drool stretched from its jaw to the frost-covered ground, glistening in the dim afternoon light.
This thing didn't just want to kill me...it wanted me to know I'd been hunted.
I didn't move. I didn't blink. I couldn't.
It loomed over the bush I was hiding in, body stretching and contorting in a way that defied anything I'd seen in nature. A clawed limb reached down...hooved and jointed wrong, like it had been built rather than born. The claw hovered, trembling, an inch from my face.
I should've stabbed it. Or at least screamed. But I didn't.
Because I knew, deep down, none of it would matter. If I fought back, I'd die slower. This wasn't some predator...it was something older, something that existed for pain.
And then, salvation came from the deep.
A growl rolled through the woods like distant thunder. Low, primal, unmistakable.
A bear.
A real one. The kind that bleeds and breathes and sleeps. I recognized the timbre immediately...a sound every hunter fears, but tonight it was a godsend.
The creature froze, the haze around it thickening like it was holding its breath.
Another growl...closer now. More aggressive.
The creature turned its head, then its body, drawn away from me by the challenge.
Without thinking, I ran.
Branches slapped my face. Thorns ripped through my sleeves. I ran until my legs went numb, until my lungs clawed for air, until my boots barely touched the earth.
Behind me, the forest erupted.
The bear roared...once. Then there was silence. A wet, horrible silence, punctuated by the crunch of bone and the tearing of meat.
I ran faster.
I don't know how long I ran...ten minutes? Thirty? Time stopped meaning anything. The forest was endless, a looping nightmare. Every shadow looked like claws. Every sound was it.
But eventually, the adrenaline began to crack. Pain surged in...knees, chest, hands. My legs gave out beneath me, and I collapsed against a tree.
Breathing hurt. The air stabbed into my lungs like knives. My ribs ached. Blood ran sticky down my forearms.
And for the first time since this hell started... I thought about giving up.
Everything I knew told me I was finished. I was a human on empty, and this thing? It was a force of nature. An apex predator with a hunger for suffering.
I stared into the darkening woods and whispered, ""This is it.""
My hand fumbled through my pocket and pulled out my GPS. My fingers were numb, blood-slicked, shaking. I stared at the tiny screen and made myself a deal...the kind of deal you only make when your soul's already halfway out of your body.
""If it's more than two miles..."" I whispered aloud, voice cracking, ""...I stop. I sit right here. Let the cold take me. At least I'll go out with silence.""
I held my breath and turned the device on.
7:06 PM.
Distance to truck: 1.9 miles.
I broke.
Tears erupted from me, loud and choking. I wasn't even crying from relief...I was crying because I wasn't allowed to give up yet. The universe had shoved hope back in my lap, cruel and bright like a match in the dark.
I was close. So goddamn close.
But the terror crept back in like a fog.
What if it followed me?
What if it let me get this far?
What if it wanted me to feel hope before it took me apart?
The forest seemed to lean in closer, listening. Every rustle felt like a breath on my neck.
Then I heard it.
Those same footsteps. Heavy. Deliberate. Rhythmic.
I didn't think. I didn't breathe. I just ran.
My lungs were on fire, and the cold had turned my tears to ice streaks on my face, but I ran harder than I ever had. My boots barely gripped the earth. Every few steps I thought I'd collapse, but somehow my legs kept moving.
""Just a little more,"" I muttered, again and again. ""Just a little more, just a little more, please...""
Then I saw it.
A flash of faded blue in the darkness...my truck.
I screamed, half laughter, half madness. I yanked the keys from my pocket and dove inside, slamming the door shut behind me. The engine turned over with a painful cough, then roared to life. I cranked the heat and peeled out, tires flinging gravel into the trees behind me.
I didn't care how hurt I was. I didn't care how bad my hands were bleeding. I was leaving this place. Now.
The plan was simple: follow the dirt road for two miles, take a right for twenty, then a left...and I'd be gone. Home. Safe.
But just before I reached the first turn, I saw them.
Three massive shapes, standing motionless in the middle of the road.
Moose.
I slammed on the brakes, stopping just two feet from the nearest one. My heart pounded in my ears like gunshots.
Then I looked up into the rearview mirror.
And everything stopped.
It stood behind the truck...coated in gore, its body steaming in the cold night air. In one grotesque hand, it held the severed head of the bear like a trophy, its mouth hanging open in a final, frozen scream. The creature tilted its head at me, as if asking:
You see now? Look what I did. Look what I can do.
I screamed and hit the gas. I didn't care if I plowed through moose or crashed into a tree...I had to move.
But I didn't.
The truck wouldn't move.
I looked forward again.
The moose were no longer moose.
They were those things, twisted into new shapes...bone and fur and claw...arms hooked around the hood, keeping me in place like a child's toy.
And then I heard it again.
The footsteps.
Getting closer.
Then…
A breath on the glass.
It was here.

1o27fj5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o27fj5,Follow Up To Brake Motor Saga,"For your enjoyment while you sip your morning coffee, here's the resolution to my brake motor saga, covered in these posts:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/VWiD4Owners/comments/1mfxheb/2021\_id4\_went\_insane\_on\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/VWiD4Owners/comments/1mfxheb/2021_id4_went_insane_on_me/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/VWiD4Owners/comments/1nnv8cu/id4\_rear\_brake\_motor\_issue\_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/VWiD4Owners/comments/1nnv8cu/id4_rear_brake_motor_issue_update/)

My local VW service center replaced the rear brake motor. When I got the car back, that wheel was red hot and had a burning smell. The car was also sluggish. I took it back and they said they ""could not replicate the issue"" after driving it 100 miles. They released the car back to me and it immediately started happening again as I drove it off their lot. This entire saga took over two months.

I gave up on that service center and took it to one 45 minutes away with a better reputation. They identified root cause. When the first place put in the new brake motor, they installed the ""rear adjuster fork"" backwards. This caused the heat and friction, and also damaged the surrounding parts (brake drum, shoe, other hardware). See attached pics of ""good"" versus backwards fork.

After some back and forth with VW Customer Care (corporate), the first service center is agreeing to cover all repair costs ($1,800). Now just waiting for the fix.

So happy to have an end in sight for this saga which started in early July. I was ready to sell back the car at one point. My wife and I just felt completely hopeless and it was an extremely dangerous situation. A couple threats of legal action might have been mentioned along the way.",8,1760020143.0,VWiD4Owners,1,1.0,False
1o27fdp,https://i.redd.it/a67888igj3uf1.png,Shopper School #4,"What to Expect in a Mystery Shopping Task: From Start to Submission 

If you’ve ever wondered what mystery shopping actually feels like, beyond the buzzwords and vague promises, this post breaks it down. No fluff, no hype. Just the real steps you’ll go through. 

**🧾 Step 1: Accepting a Task** 

You’ll start by browsing available assignments on a platform (desktop or app). Tasks are usually listed by location, payout, and deadline. 

Example: “Visit Costa Coffee on High Street between 2–5 PM. Order a drink and evaluate staff friendliness.” 

You’ll see the pay, any reimbursement, and how long the report is expected to take. 

Tip: Don’t accept tasks you can’t complete on time. It affects your Shopper rating. 

**📍 Step 2: Doing the Shop** 

This is the actual visit. You go in as a regular customer, no weird disguises or scripts. 

Follow the instructions carefully. You might need to: 

Time how long it takes to be greeted 

Check if promotional signage is visible 

Ask a specific question (e.g., “Do you have any dairy-free options?”) 

Important: You’re not there to catch people out. You’re observing, not judging. 

**🧠 Step 3: Taking Notes (Discreetly)** 

You’ll need to remember key details: 

Staff names (if visible) 

Cleanliness levels 

Any issues or standout moments 

Some shoppers jot down notes on their phone pretending to text. Others write things down right after leaving. Whatever works, just don’t be obvious. 

**🖥️ Step 4: Submitting the Report** 

Once you’re done, you’ll log into the platform and fill out a structured report. 

Expect questions like: 

“Was the staff member wearing a name badge?” 

“How would you rate the overall experience?” 

“Describe any issues you encountered.” 

You’ll usually upload a receipt or photo as proof. Reports are time-sensitive, submit within a few hours or by end of day. 

**💸 Step 5: Getting Paid** 

After your report is reviewed, payment is processed. Your payments are usually sent out in the following months as clients take time to review reports. 

No, it’s not instant. 

Yes, you can track it. 

No, you won’t get rich.  

But it adds up if you’re consistent.

this is why we are alive 

Though we have these moments inconsistently, 

isn’t it so nice to have them at all? 

  


Yes, good things don’t last forever 

But they don’t stay gone either 





I’ve learned patience for others 

but I must learn patience for myself as well

Learn that hurt still hurts 

even if it’s not the worst kind in the world

are not things that need to be earned

it is to feel

I tried all medications, but consistency never got me. Inositol, vitamin D, metformin, GLP-1, but never lost a single weight till this day.
I started go to gym 1,5 years ago and still never lost a weight. I go to tennis class but got even sadder after looking at my body, comparing myself to other people at the class.
I saw people lost weight by doing all of that, but it never happened to me.
My eating habit is the problem. I can’t get away from sweet after experiencing minor inconveniences. Or just random cravings, even in the morning.

 Dates back to Jan 2023, we were in the same college and this guy (let’s call him Isaac) hit me up on insta with a “hi do you go to this college too?” We had a lot of mutual followers so we started texting each other, realized we had a lot of similar interests so the conversations just went on and on. He said that he finds me really cute and is interested in knowing me more. 

After a few weeks he was like “can I take you out for dinner?” and I said “yes but later.” We spoke to each other for close to 3 months out of which he prolly asked me out 6-7 times from breakfast to dinners to drives and I kept on postponing all of them (I had severe social anxiety back then which I communicated to him) 

He confessed his feelings that he really likes me, wants to be w me, cannot go a day without speaking to me, he wants to make me his. I told him I like him too. He even showed upto my dorm building late at night and go like “I’m here”  and I’d not go meet him lol and there was a point where he was like “just be upfront that you don’t wanna be w me, don’t play all these games” I was like bro I fr wanna meet you but I’ve anxiety, just give it some more time. 

I think he started to get tired because he’d constantly nudge me about if we’d ever see each other and the nail on the coffin was when I heard from a close friend that he was “investigating” about me by essentially asking this girl to find info about me cos he thought I was ‘sus’ and wouldn’t meet him for months so he’s worried I’m hiding something like a secret bf and I’m v antisocial so he doesn’t know much about me. I confronted him about it and the he straight up denied but he was caught red handed w evidence and he said if it’s an issue for me, he can leave as he’s tired of it going nowhere for months and he’s not interested in dating anymore. I said ok cool. Suddenly he lost his cool and he started abusing me. He was like he forced himself to like me, he was convincing himself that I’m the one for him but I’m nowhere close to what he wanted, I’m a loser, I live under a shell, people who think they know me don’t acc know me because I don’t know who I am or what I want blah blah it went on and on. He blocked me everywhere from insta to Spotify - this was March 2023. Removed all my friends months later. Would block and unblock me. Watched my stories from his spam account. It was a very emotional time for me, I didn’t realize how much I liked him until he was gone, I spent months crying over him and how we ended. 

Months later (December 2023) I reached out to him by saying hey we’re both international students and college is ending in a few months and we’d never get to see each other again. Do you wanna meet and talk and sort the fight out because we ended on really bad terms? I’m chill if you’re not up for it too, no pressure. Good luck. 

He surprisingly replied very earnestly, spoke to me like there was no drama at all, like we were old friends and was like ya let’s grab coffee blah blah. He dragged it for a month, he’d say yes and disappear, and I was like bro I don’t think this is happening so I’ll just tell you what I’d have otherwise preferred to tell you in person and I gave him an apology, explained my pov, my issues, called him out for his antics, and finally said a goodbye. He was like he wasn’t able to meet me cos he’s got a gf, they’ve been together for a month or so (idk why he even agreed to coffee or even responded in the first place to begin with in that case) and it’s inappropriate to talk to me, said sorry and was like I think you’re a good person blah blah. I left it on read and that was the last time I ever spoke to him. A month later I unsent all my messages to him and closed the chapter. This was January 2024 and marks the last time I ever spoke to him. 

I also cut off my best friend during that time because she was genuinely very toxic towards me and treated me in a horrible way and she immediately went and befriended him after lol. She was very public about it and she wanted to rub it on my face that she’s a part of his circle now. 

Anyway, Isaac saw me on campus and would keep staring at me but we never acknowledged each other. We both graduated in May 2024 and I thought that was that. Months after graduation he liked an old message of mine and turns out it was accidental as he was lurking through old chats (why would a guy w a gf even open an old chat? Idk) He’d view my stories despite him not following me so I made my account private. 

In October 2024, my ex bestfriend (the one I cut off) sent me an email, messaged me on WhatsApp using a new number, and messaged me on insta using a new account only to ask me to meet her because she really wants to talk to me. I wanted to respect what we had in the past so I met her and during the 2 hour conversation, she brought Isaac’s name up 3 times despite me telling her that I don’t want to talk about him. Towards the end of the conversation, she said “I know you don’t want to talk about Isaac but I just wanted to let you know we’ll be getting engaged in the future. He’s been flirting with me a lot, his family sent my family a proposal for marriage, they’ve been so persistent, Isaac is smitten by me and won’t leave me alone…” I was genuinely shook like what even? But I knew she wanted a reaction out of me so I kept a straight face and said “congrats!” I left sometime later and she messaged me multiple times asking to hang out  but I politely declined. 


Anyway, I left all that behind. It’s been almost 2 years since I last spoke to him. I joined hinge recently, started chatting w this guy who went to college in Canada. I was really open with him and told him that I never dated before, I spoke to a guy online for a couple months and it went nowhere, I went on a few days with this other guy but we weren’t compatible. He was very understanding and was like he dated 3 girls. After chatting for a week, we were in the middle of planning when to meet - he seemed really into me. He wanted to show me around, was making plans of me meeting his friends, figuring out a good first date spot. 


All of a sudden, he doesn’t talk to me for a day and he comes back to say “my friend Isaac told me that he knew you and spoke to you for a while. He’s my childhood friend, idk it feels weird now” I was like I didn’t know they were friends as his profile had zero trace of him and told him I never met Isaac, we’re not in touch, we texted years ago. He was acting a little uncomfortable so I told him that Isaac was getting engaged to my own ex bestie who I was friends with for years so that shows we were never a thing. The guy was dumbfounded and said “idk where you got that from but Isaac was dating this other girl until earlier this year. Someone lied to you” 

I gave him my side and told him that I don’t mind speaking to him if it’s weird for him.  He was like I’m sorry but it’ll just get too complicated. I bid him goodbye and removed him.

The thing is after ALL this drama… I never even met Isaac. I technically don’t “know” him. I just don’t know what to think. AITAH in this story? ",0,1760019948.0,AITAH,2,0.5,False

An older man walking his dog stopped nearby and noticed I looked upset. He didn’t say much at first  just handed me a napkin from his pocket for the coffee stains and said, Rough day? I nodded, and he smiled and said, Good. That means tomorrow’s due to be better.

He didn’t try to give advice or make small talk. He just stood there a minute, let his dog sniff around, and then said, Hang in there, kid, before walking off.

1o27air,https://www.reddit.com/r/GastricBypass/comments/1o27air/4_months_postop_update_and_hard_truths/,4 Months Post-Op Update and Hard Truths,"So today's the 4 month anniversary and thought I'd share an update. I'm a 32 year old woman and my highest weight was 292. I was down to 272 by June 9th, my surgery date, due to simply tracking what I was eating plus the pre-op diet. I had a super easy recovery and although I only took two and a half weeks off of work, I could have gone back sooner physically. 

Now, I'm at 237.7 this morning. My weight loss has been very slow after I switched to regular foods. I've lost almost 35 pounds post-surgery and only 5 of that has been in the past month. 

So far, I can eat just about anything. Potatoes don't sit particularly well, as does white rice (weirdly brown rice is fine), but I haven't had any dumping (my surgeon's PA said this is actually fairly rare). I've cut out the Starbucks chai I used to have once a week or so because it's SO much sugar, but I do occasionally have the ""Skinny Chai"" concentrate from them, or I'll just make chai with a splash of sugar-free brown sugar cinnamon coffee syrup. I am generally hitting protein goals, although I am sick of keeping track. Sometimes a girl just wants a bowl of tomato soup for lunch and doesn't want to add protein! 

I was exhausted about a month ago and got all my bloodwork rerun - I was low in B12 and got diagnosed with fatty liver disease (they don't call it that anymore, but that's what it is). I'm now taking supplemental B12 which helps with my exhaustion. What doesn't help is that I work two jobs and I'm a PhD student. Which brings me to my self-love hard talk.

I haven't been exercising because after I come home from my regular job, I either pass out from exhaustion, need to read or write for my PhD program, or prepare to teach/grade for my second job. Other, less legitimate excuses I've used is that I cannot afford a gym membership and 7-8 months out of the year in central Florida it's too hot to just walk outside. 

But the honest truth is, I haven't been prioritizing it. Usually at work for my lunch break I'll either putz on my phone or do PhD reading, or I'll just work while eating. Today I decided I'd take my ""lunch break"" at 9:30, and went out for a 25 minute walk around campus since it's relatively nice out. It felt good to get out there and walk. It's my plan to try to do this twice a week. I also bought some resistance bands during the Prime sale and I plan on doing exercises while watching TV at least once a week. I know it's not the 150 minutes I'm supposed to do, but I figured it's a) better than nothing and b) if I'm consistent with that, I can potentially add in more time/sessions. 

I am concerned that the 55 pounds I've lost might be the majority of what I've lost, but I know it's still relatively early. I know I'm off ""track"" based on the Get-2-Goal app, but I also know things I need to change. How are y'all June surgery babes doing? ",3,1760019812.0,GastricBypass,0,1.0,False

I think love lives in the little things: laughing until it hurts, holding hands on late-night walks, or splitting dessert while pretending we’re “too full.”

About me:

Food is my love language. Cooking, trying new spots, or just indulging in comfort food all make me happy.

I’m a lover of stories: books, anime, games, and travel. Basically anything that lets me escape into a new world.

I’m a huge nerd for Tokusatsu - if it’s got heroes, suits, and over-the-top explosions, I’m there cheering like a kid again.

I collect physical media because Wi-Fi can fail but my Blu-rays won’t.

I’m laid-back, affectionate, a little goofy, and believe love should be both playful and meaningful.

What I’m hoping for:
Someone kind, thoughtful, and down to build something lasting. I imagine stargazing together, rainy afternoons curled up under a blanket, and mornings that start with coffee but somehow turn into adventures. Bonus points if you don’t mind my bad puns or will hype me up while I try to bake cookies that may or may not come out edible.

• Mabango
• Clever
• Taller than me (I’m 5’5 ft)
• Cute and appreciates chubby ladies
• Pogi, or at least has that quiet charm 😌
• Around 23 to 30 years old

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
The Los Angeles Dodgers are the undisputed favorites here, with moneyline odds hovering around **-205** (implied probability: \~67%) across bookmakers like FanDuel and BetMGM. The Philadelphia Phillies, meanwhile, sit at **+160** (\~38%), a price that screams “gamble on us and we’ll haunt your dreams.” The total runs line is **7.5-8**, with the under priced slightly lower, suggesting bookmakers expect a pitcher’s duel. But let’s not forget the spread: the Dodgers are -1.5, a line that feels like a “win by at least two or we’ll send a bill to your house” kind of demand.

Yoshinobu Yamamoto (2.49 ERA) vs. Aaron Nola (6.01 ERA)? It’s like pitting a precision-guided missile against a guy who forgets to reload his slingshot. Nola’s ERA is so high, it could double as a rollercoaster. The Phillies’ “piggy-back” plan with Ranger Suarez? Sounds like a toddler’s nap schedule—confusing, chaotic, and unlikely to yield results.

**Digest the News: Pressure Cookers and Clutch Wizards**  
The Dodgers have a knack for turning ninth-inning collapses into comebacks, like a Netflix series where every episode ends with a twist. They’ve already pulled off two Philly escapes, including a 5-3 thriller where they erased a 3-0 deficit. Now, they’re back in their cozy Dodger Stadium bubble, where the air is thick with championship vibes and the coffee is brewed with confidence.

The Phillies? They’re in a must-win scenario, which is baseball’s version of a “do or die” reality show. Their starter, Nola, has been a pumpkin on the mound this season, and their piggy-back strategy feels like a Hail Mary from a team that’s already fallen. Oh, and they’re playing in L.A., where the crowd’s cheers are so loud, they could probably start a conga line without anyone realizing the game is over.
