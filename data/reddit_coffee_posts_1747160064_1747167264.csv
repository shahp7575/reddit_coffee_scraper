I didn’t touch or kiss her cos I was really scared. After the date I sent her a message on WhatsApp that I had a great time getting to know her, and would love to do it again. 

Here’s her reply:Hey, it was nice meeting you, you seem like a thoughtful and genuine person. For me personally the connection wasn’t quite there though. But I really appreciate that you took the step to meet up. I know that’s not always easy, and I respect that a lot. Don't worry so much about other peoples opinions:)

I was wondering why she doesn’t feel a connection. Maybe it’s because I didn’t kiss or touch her. 

I don’t even know how to reply her. Can you guys please give me advice or ideas? Thanks",1,1747167050.0,self,1,1.0,False

1klw0ka,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1klw0ka/roommate_issues_and_adhd_rsd/,roommate issues and ADHD / RSD,"I was diagnosed ADHD last year and have been on meds for over a year. Finally finding out I have ADHD has made a lot of sense in various areas of my life, but especially roommate stuff. The obvious reasons include being forgetful about deadlines (e.g., trash going out Thursdays), misplacing things, forgetting stuff in the fridge, etc. But I also have some serious triggers around roommate issues, as myself and two other women were forcibly displaced a few years ago by an objectively nutso roommate (a story for another time, but includes signing our renewing lease behind our backs and saying we can ""still be friends"" ... threatening to call the cops on me for reacting angrily over text to aforementioned displacement ... kissing my ex at a bar and telling me I was being abusive for wanting space from them .... telling ANOTHER ex's wife I was still in love with him... yeah good times).

I'm 30F now, and have grown to be an accountable and cleanly roommate despite my diagnosis. I clean up after myself, contribute to household chores, etc. But I've learned conflicts with housemates are inevitable, especially in close quarters. A neurotypical person may be able to delineate roommate issues as impersonal and carry on. But with ADHD, I experience rejection sensitivity greatly, and it is exponentially heightened by this past trauma. It manifests for me in ways like thinking people are talking behind my back, reading too deep into people's texts / tone, perceived aggression (passive or direct), not speaking up on my boundaries when I should, and/or getting offended by other's boundaries.

I live in a house of 4 total right now, and two roommates are a couple. Lately I've been butting heads with the male member of this (hetero) couple, but I was friends with the woman before we all moved in together. The couple have not co-habitated with anyone in several years aside from each other, and the man (35M) exhibits very bossy, passive-aggressive, and standoffish behaviors. Idk if it's a 'man of the house' complex, but my last living situation (which happens to be the same house, I was the only one that stayed after they moved away) had two guys who were super chill and emotionally mature, even in roommate conflicts.

I'm struggling with a lot of emotions with this roommate, including resentment and intimidation, clearly amplified by my past experiences not feeling 'safe' in a house. I have felt bad energy from this roommate for the last few weeks in particular in passive (e.g., ignoring my messages in our group chat but carrying on other conversation with others), and direct (e.g., storming upstairs to tell me I'm being too loud on the phone at night without texting me a request to keep it down first) ways.

Things came to a head when one day last week I asked to borrow a bike bump from the couple over group text. Another roommate made an unrelated comment that he replied solely to her, not acknowledging my original request. His partner messaged later saying it was at a friend's house otherwise I could use it. No big deal, but I went out of my way to find another one from another friend and ran all over town trying to go get it. As I was leaving I saw the pump sitting on the floor of the garage and immediately burst into tears, thinking that he probably just didn't want me to use it because of his clear biases against me, and that his gf was covering for him. I texted her saying that next time they should tell me if I don't want to use something of theirs, and it was hard not to perceive as a lie. She replied immediately saying he went out of his way to go get it from their friend's place and that I hurt her by accusing her of lying.

Obviously, I am clearly in the wrong re the accusation above, and immediately took accountability for it. I know I should have just asked first, but it felt like 'proof' in an ongoing sea of tension and frustration with her partner. I also don't know why he would go out of his way to go get the bike pump and not communicate about it at all. It still feels bitchy to me, and while I take responsibility for my mistake, it feels difficult not to also blame him for the unnecessary lack of communication. After this I have not spoken to him at all. We were in the kitchen at one point together and he was slamming stuff around, I stook my ground and continued making my coffee, but his energy literally makes me feel scared. It doesn't really matter I guess at the end of the day, I move out next weekend across the country, but I still want to salvage this relationship with my friend. We are due to talk about things tomorrow. Wondering if anyone has any advice for navigating this situation or conversation?

TLDR; having a hard time delineating past trauma, rejection sensitivity, male intimidation, and/or negative roommate behaviors. ",1,1747166995.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

1klvw7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFA/comments/1klvw7d/salt_solutions_users_for_feb_2026_hows_prep_going/,"Salt Solutions users for Feb 2026, how’s prep going so far? Here’s my take","Hi fellow CFA candidates,

I’m prepping for the February 2026 CFA Level I exam and ended up choosing Salt Solutions as a prep provider after doing a good amount of research online. I was looking for something that wouldn’t be overwhelming and would actually fit my learning style. I'm an engineer so I need a structure that’s clear, focused, and doesn’t rely on endless reading blocks or overkill dashboards.

So far I’ve worked through Quant and most parts of of Alternatives, and I’ve liked the pacing and design of the Salt platform. The short videos are easy to squeeze in after work or during a coffee shop session, and the checkmarks and progress tracking help keep momentum going. I’m starting to realize though that you can’t just watch, you really have to get into the QBank questions early. Sometimes even before finishing the readings. They’re tough at first but definitely help shift from just absorbing to actually thinking in ""CFA-speak"".

I also bought the Kaplan Secret Sauce, even though it’s pretty expensive, (around 150 USD) but I think (or better I hope) it’s going to be worth it as a second material for review. I like having something more condensed when I want to step back and see how things connect.

A few things I’d love to learn from peers that went though L1 prep or are going through it right now:

•How do you structure your review after finishing a topic in Salt?

•Do you start mocks as you go, or wait until all topics are covered once?

•Anyone combining Salt with other providers or tools (e.g. Anki, IFT, etc)?

If you’re considering Salt and want a referral link, feel free to message me, but I’m really just curious how others are approaching prep, especially if you’ve figured out what helps retention long-term or how to mix content with practice effectively.

Would love to hear how you’re approaching it or what’s worked well (or not) so far. Good luck to everyone sitting in May too! :)

When I was leaving my apartment the following day, I sensed that I would never come back. As I locked the door, I felt indistinct dread wash over me. Where was I going to go? Why had the Land of Dreams become more dominant than real life? Would it be better to end it? Lost in my dismal thoughts, I turned the corner and nearly fell into a deep excavation pit dug by the communal service. I balanced on the pit's edge, holding on to a striped wooden sawhorse-like railing meant to block it. Nearby was a space for another railing, but it lay at the bottom of the excavation. Looking in horror at the protruding rebar below, I thought that I had just been near the end. ""Why should I go to him?"" I thought. A sense of clarity began to come over me. What would I lose if I stopped? Wouldn't I rather try to find myself in this real world? Speculating in this way, I slowly trudged along the street.

The city had already begun to celebrate New Year. Sharp bursts of fireworks were heard here and there. Everything was adorned with flickering garlands. The faces of people passing me by were filled with pleasant anticipation. Looking at them, I sadly ruminated that I was unwanted at that party. I shook the thought off and decisively strode to the bus station. I had already gained more than all of them had.

""What is it?"" I asked, looking at a vial in the stranger's hands. ""Just a sedative with a mild sleep-inducing effect,"" explained the stranger, ""We need more time now, and you mustn't awake until you sort everything out in your alter-world. By the way, when did you last eat?"" ""I haven't eaten today. No appetite,"" I said, ""Only coffee."" The stranger took out a small bowl, poured some instant porridge, added some milk, and put the bowl into a microwave oven. When the oven produced a long beep, the stranger took a steaming bowl out and put it on the table. Then, he placed a spoon next to the bowl. ""Eat,"" he said, ""It's necessary.""

I started eating reluctantly. While I was eating, the stranger left the kitchen and, after some time, returned holding a sheet of paper, an inkwell, and a feather pen. ""You have to write something and put your signature,"" he said as I finished the meal. I studied the sheet of paper, which contained a heptagram encircled by writings resembling quatrains written in the same language as the Codex. ""Write you do it at will and put your signature,"" clarified the stranger. It was strange because I thought I would have to sign some official document. Probably anticipating my questions, he continued, ""This

shall be an anchor in this world. In the other reality, you will have something like this document. It'll remind you that you are in a dream if something unforeseen occurs."" This seemed a weird thing to me. ""Wait, wait! What do you mean? What can happen there? Is it too dangerous?"" My mind was in a daze. ""I don't know, but you should have this. That is your world, and you know better than me what might happen there,"" he responded vaguely, ""I know that you need to have an anchor."" Seeing my indecisiveness, the stranger continued, ""Here is written that you allow your consciousness to transit into another body at will.""

 

I wanted to enter my world of fantasy again. I craved it so much, but the very act of signing my name on the permit for my soul to transfer anywhere frightened me. ""Something wrong?"" The stranger's voice pulled me from my ruminating. ""Do you believe in the immortality of a human soul?"" I could not recognize whether he was mocking or speaking seriously. I took the feather pen and signed the paper. ""Okay,"" he said, handing me the tiny vial, ""Let's move on to our business."" 

When I drank the tasteless liquid, the stranger told me to sit for a few minutes while he was instructing me. Then, he invited me to proceed into the room. The room was almost empty. No large bookcases or shelves filled with ancient volumes and vellum manuscripts. No magical symbols were drawn across the walls and the ceiling. All the furniture included a trundle bed, an armchair, and a wooden stool with a switched-on laptop resting on it. I also noticed that on the armchair was a tablet with a stippled pattern and something else. The stranger pointed at the trundle bed, and when I settled myself there, he handed me the pattern and a pen. I felt familiar and pleasant goosebumps running across my body, but the stranger gave me something else. It was an object similar to a wreath made of copper wire. He said that the thing worked like encephalogram electrodes and asked me to put it on my head. I fancied that the wreath consisted of multiple tiny copper symbols such as crosses, pentagrams, and heptagrams. ""And how does it work?"" I asked. ""You'll know it soon,"" he responded mysteriously, ""Let's tackle our deeds."" I began to circle the pattern and sensed a pleasant and familiar vertigo, but before I was hurled to another dimension, I saw the stranger was sitting down on the armchair and putting on exactly the same copper wreath.  

II

In my dream, I was sitting beside an extinguished bonfire in a small grove, chewing on bread and cheese. My destination was The Old Abbey - the last refuge for people whose families the gray plague had affected. A new surge of the plague had wiped out nearly a third of the population of Lothric. New riots filled with atrocities and violence swept across the country. People believed that the End of Times was approaching, and since death was inevitable, they indulged in all possible sins. Queen Isabella had taken refuge from the pestilence and riots on the Marble Island. I had obtained permission to be in her court with Adelia, but my Adelia was here, at the abbey, and she was gravely ill. I had received a letter from her in which she pleaded with me to find that old witch doctor in Veelen to obtain a specific potion. The potion was in my sack, within a small sealed clay vessel.

 It was not a piece of cake to get the potion, but I did. I tracked down the witch doctor and forced him to make the medicine. Initially, the sorcerer refused to confess that he practiced witchcraft. He insisted that he was merely a herbalist. I struck him. The impact of my heavy gauntlet made the sorcerer more cooperative. A hooded figure squirmed on a filthy floor, mumbling that I did not comprehend what I had embarked on. However, when I drew the sword and brandished it, the sorcerer revealed what I needed. The following step was to obtain the blood of a virgin recovered from the plague. Combing the streets of Veelen, I met a group of refugees and noticed a woman and a girl. Both had certain signs displaying they had recovered from the gray plague - pockmarks around their mouths. I succeeded in luring them into a secluded place. When that terrible yet necessary act was done, I returned to the witch doctor with a small clay vessel imbued with the blood. While the sorcerer was fumbling with vials and jars, hunching over a bubbling cauldron, I listened to the bustle outdoors, hearing the shouts of the guards. Someone had slaughtered two refugees - a woman and her daughter, and the alarm had been raised.

The sorcerer completed blending the potion and handed it to me. As I hid the vessel in my sack, he seized my wrists with his skinny hands and yelped, ""Impostor! Alien! Here! Here! Here! Alarm!"" To my surprise, his grip was strong enough. I struck him in the temple with the hilt of my sword. He collapsed on the dirty floor. No one heard his shout. I set fire to his abode and dived into the obscurity of a night ridden street. I needed to hurry because soon, this part of the city would be engulfed by flames, and it would be my chance to sneak out of Veelen. Creeping through dark and gloomy lanes and alleys, avoiding encounters with guards and militias, I thought of my beloved. From time to time, I touched the scroll of vellum hanging around my neck - the anchor. Seemingly, everything was going well. Or not? What had the witch doctor cried out? Impostor? Alien? Had he noticed something wrong with me? Was something going awry?

III

I woke up again next to the extinguished bonfire. Woke up? Could I sleep within my dream? Yes, I could! I had done that many times before. Had I done that, or were those only false memories? It did not matter. Now, I had the anchor granting me to act more loosely and to make decisions out of the order of things. I had to sort out everything while the sleeping draught I had taken in my real world worked. Yet, I felt some changes happening in this parallel reality. The changes were frightful. I sensed that the world was not real. I felt the warmth of the extinguished fire and the smell of smoke. I could touch anything and perceive the resistance of matter, but the world seemed somewhat flat, as if it were captured in a photo. The walls of the Old Abbey looked three-dimensional, but the almost crimson skies with tattered clouds and a dense forest stretching behind the fortress seemed like decorations that I had seen in photographic exhibitions. Photo? In that medieval reality, there were no photos, so why did I compare a picturesque landscape to photography, and how did I use the words that had to be subconsciously blocked in that reality? Ah, yeah! A piece of vellum - the anchor, linked me to my actual world, where photos and many other things were a part of reality.

I knew I should hurry up, so I strode toward the abbey. My steps sounded somewhat muted on a pebbled path. I could see a large wrought iron gate and the figure of a guard dressed in a yellow cloak with a brown hood - the uniform of The Brotherhood of Mercy. His face was masked with a yellow piece of cloth with two slits for his eyes. The guard was armed with a short sword dangling from his waist. He held a burning flame in his right hand, although it was not dark. When I approached the guard, he raised his hand in warning. He was taller than me by a head and looked dangerous, but I knew that the brothers of Mercy were not hostile. They were brave in combat and unafraid of dying, but they never used swords without cause. I had a signet ring with the queen's emblem that I submitted when I needed to enter certain guarded places. After showing the ring, I told the giant guard I needed to see the abbess. The sentinel gestured for me to pass. When I entered an atrium-like yard, I saw a gloomy scene of grief and death. At least a dozen corpses wrapped in sacking  lay on the ground. Two hooded Brothers of Mercy, as tall as the guard was, were placing the bodies in wooden caskets. At the corner of the yard, several nuns fumbled with some utensils. Almost all of them wore masks. I saw the abbess amidst them, a lanky woman dressed in a black tunic, while the others wore brown tunics. Coming up to the abbess, I understood why almost everyone I met there covered their faces. The Abbess was unmasked, and half of her face was turned from me, and when I approached her, I saw her entire face, eaten by the gray plague. The face looked like a grotesque mask - the left side of the face was quite lovely, whereas the right side resembled a skull with a sardonic smile. I displayed the ring and handed her a purse full of golden coins - a necessary donation. Then I asked about Adelia. Speaking to the woman, I couldn't avoid looking at her face, yet I tried not to reveal that her ugliness somehow disturbed me. The Abbess told me that Adelia had decided to leave her worldly life and join the sisters-nuns, but the rules allowed me to see her to bid farewell.

A terrible guess sparkled in my mind. I imagined what could compel my beloved Adelia to make such a decision, looking at the abbess's face.

My hand automatically groped under my clothes for a piece of vellum hanging around my neck. I should not be in a panic. I had the potion for which I had paid a very high price, so everything could be sorted out positively. Or not. The abbess directed me to the wing where my beloved was.

I followed a nun through an endless maze of hallways and arched doorways. Passing by cells, I could hear moans and wails. The air was saturated with the odor of illness and death. ""My poor little princess,"" I thought, "" Are you truly here, among these unfortunate souls? Have you become like them, moaning, wailing, inhaling the stench of vomit and urine?"" 

The nun stopped by a doorway and gestured inside the cell. I entered a semi-dark room. I could recognize a wooden bed in the corner and a bucket beside it. Above the head of the bed hung a small icon with a burning lamp. The crimson light of the sunset falling onto the floor through a small window merged with the faint flickering of the icon lamp, and some beams flickered in a tiny mirror placed on a nightstand. ""Mirror...Mirror,"" For some reason, I thought, ""Have I ever seen my reflection in this world?"" I knew what I looked like in that reality, but I could not recall the last time I looked in any mirror in the world of dreams. I remembered Adelia after the night we had spent together, sitting by the mirror and combing her long red hair, smiling mischievously, winking at me in the mirror.

Again, I let my false memories wash over me. Everything related to my beloved had been false and untrue, but finally, our meeting would not be fake. Adelia was just a few steps from me, lying on the bed. I approached the bed and saw her face covered with a piece of gauze that seemed slightly reddish in the crimson light of the sunset.

The strands of her red hair lay scattered upon a pillow. The body wrapped up in a blanket resembled a caterpillar. Was she alive? Yes, she was. I could hear her breathing, then a faint moan. I came closer. ""Darling? Is it you?"" Her voice was coarse, but it was her voice - the sweetest voice in the universe. ""Yes, it's me, my love! I have brought the serum!"" I took a clay vessel out of my sack, ""You'll recover, and we'll go to The Marble Island! Queen Isabella is waiting for us to be in her court. She...""

I stopped speaking when I saw her palm appear from under the blanket. ""Give me your hand, darling,"" she whispered. I took her tiny palm, wishing to press it against my cheek as I had used to do before, but I saw her fingernails, once beautiful but now resembling ugly black talons - the implication of the plague. I hesitated. When she started speaking, I detected some uncertain mockery in her voice, ""You've seen my disfigured fingernails only. What will you feel if you see my face, darling? It is too late, but it does not matter."" I tried to find appropriate words to respond, but she asked me not to interrupt her. ""Darling, listen to me carefully!"" Her palm squeezed my wrist tighter. ""I love you,"" she whispered, ""I love you so much despite the fact you're just dreaming about me! I am a dream! Dream!"" My heart sank. I wanted to pull my hand away, but Adelia's tiny and fragile fingers held my wrist as if with pincers. ""You have to wake up now! Now!"" Her voice grew louder, and she started to get up, ""You need to use the anchor and copy the pattern on it! We're running out of time! Do you hear them? They know that you're an alien!""

Adelia almost shouted, ""Run right down the hallway and find the cage with a heptagram. There is a trapdoor to the dungeon. You can handle the pattern there! Rarely does someone descend there, and you might finish before they catch up with you..."" The gauze was about to slip from her face, and I saw an unfamiliar visage eaten by pockmarks and a mouth with teeth bared. Nothing remained of my Adelia except her big green eyes and red hair. ""Find me when you wake up! I am somewhere nearby! I do not know you yet, but I am waiting for you! Run! I cannot control myself anymore!"" Her voice began to sound growly, ""Impostor! Alien! Intruder!"" I tried to free my wrist from her grasp. The vessel with the serum fell and shattered into pieces. A sense of black terror descended upon me. I tried to grope for a sword on my belt when suddenly, Adelia released my wrist and pushed me with inhuman strength. I flew toward the door and painfully fell on my back. The creature that had once been my beloved was standing on the bed now, stretching its black-nailed palms toward me and shrieking loudly. The red strands of hair looked like tentacles protruding in all directions. Jumping up to my feet, I bounced from the cell and ran through the hallway.

""Why haven't I woken up yet if everything has been going bloody wrong?"" I thought, running along a stoned, arched hallway. I could hear the hustle beginning in the abbey, but fortunately, I faced no one on my way. The corridor was lit by rare oil lamps hanging on a moldy wall and seemed endless.

I stopped and reminded myself that I needed to find a cell with a heptagram. Taking a lamp from the wall, I began examining every door, and for some reason, I was sure that I had not passed the door I needed.

When I took a look back, I could not believe my eyes. The arched corridor endlessly stretched far away, and its length was indeed longer than the entire abbey. Suddenly, I realized I could hear nothing. I heard only utter silence except for my footsteps. No hustle, no Adelia's shrieks, and no sounds of chasing. It seemed that, running through the corridor, I had gotten in some liminal space. My terror was growing. That damned bastard, Mr. Lucid Dreams, had made me drink a sleeping draught and had told me I had to sort out all the problems here, but now I had nothing here! How long would the sleeping draught last?

At last, I saw the door with a heptagram. I entered the cell literally overgrown with cobwebs. Hastily, I began to remove a disgusting gauze-like substance and saw on the floor a trapdoor with a rusty ring. At that moment, I heard something disturbing, perhaps sounding only inside my head, but terrifying me! It was the kind of whispering voices that were associated with some crawling insects gnawing into my body, and though the process was painless, it was kind of palpable, making me shudder and feel utterly disgusted.

I pulled the ring, and the trapdoor reluctantly succumbed to my efforts. I felt that I needed to descend to the dungeon immediately, because my terror seemed almost to reach its highest point. My imagination fed my brain some scary images, in which I saw how six tall, masked Brothers of Mercy, were carrying a body wrapped in a shroud, and I was sure that it had been my Adelia. And all of this happened in utter silence. Moreover, I was convinced that was happening in the corridor right now, and the mourning procession was haunting me. ""Oh, my God, why can't I wake up?!""

 At last, I lifted the trapdoor and hastily descended into a black yawn, lighting my path with an oil lamp. Faster, faster! I found myself in a circular room with four arched doors. Opening one of the doors, I saw a long hallway, as stony as the corridor above, and as endless as well. I did not know why I chose that particular path, but I did. Noticing that the lamp was gradually dying and the passage was getting narrower, I decided to use the anchor right there, before the lamp finally burned out.

Kneeling on the stone floor, I set the lamp down and unfolded a piece of vellum. In that reality, I had not seen the contents of the anchor yet. Familiar dotted symbols adorned the vellum. I had neither ink nor quill, so I made the only decision I could. I cut my left palm with a dagger and began copying the dotted pattern, dipping the tip of the dagger in the cut. Upon finishing the symbols, I felt a familiar vertigo, but now it was not so pleasant and tinged with nausea. At that very moment when I was pulled out of my dream, I realized that I had understood the writings read across the yellowish space the vellum: ""WHEN THE SPELL IS WRITTEN WITH BLOOD, YOU SHALL BECOME ME AND I SHALL BE YOU!""

IV

 I separated my glued eyelids with difficulty. The first thing I saw was an empty folding bed and a wooden stool with a switched-off laptop placed on it. I realized that I was in my room, sitting on an armchair, and I had broken free from that plagued nightmare. My room? My?! Something was on my left cheek, right under my left eye, and disturbed my peripheral vision. I touched it and mumbled, ""A mole."" What?! I looked at my hands, freсkled, with turtle-like knuckles, so familiar yet alien at the same time. What the hell? I jumped up from the armchair, feeling an unfamiliar stiffness and a vague ache in every joint, and I understood the whole terrifying truth. Approaching a small mirror in a bathroom, I already knew who I would see there. ""Bastard!"" I shouted, and the voice that was not mine scared me. In the mirror was a bald man with steel eyes and a raisin-sized mole under his left eye. I felt my blood pressure rise, and my throat went dry. Habitually, as if the flat were mine, I headed to the kitchen and took a bottle of water from the fridge.

While drinking the water, I noticed a piece of paper lying on the kitchen table and contrasting a time-worn veneer. I took it and saw that the letter was addressed to me.

""Dear friend! If you are reading it, it means everything has gone as I had planned. But I am not pure evil, and if I were, I wouldn't write this letter. You know what has happened to you, and moreover, in some sense, you've become me, and all my experiences have been passed on to you along with the body, so you know what to do and how. By the time you wake up, I will have left the town, so you had better not waste time searching for me; instead, focus on the knowledge you've obtained. Keep in mind that you have access to a way leading to what is essentially immortality without putting any effort, whereas I spent eons comprehending the core of things, literally walking on the knife's edge. Now you can use it as well as I have done.

And now for the bad news. I took care of my health and my already former body, and passed it on to you in relatively good condition, although its physical age is 67. But in this domain, my knowledge is powerless, and time takes its toll, and a body ages. I think that you have five or six years at most, so hurry up! All the necessary information you'll find by turning on the laptop. Good luck!""

I wanted to howl. ""Bastard! I'll kill you!"" I shouted. I rushed to the bedroom in the hope of finding a cell phone there. I didn't even know how long I had slept. The cell phone was under the armchair wired to an adapter in a wall socket. I grabbed it and touched the button. The screen lit up and I saw the date and the time: 1 January, 16-00. I had been sleeping for more than a day.

""I have to go to my place,"" I thought, darting about the flat, searching for clothes. ""I might intercept the bastard there. Doesn't he have to sort everything out before leaving?""

Jolting in the tram, I mulled over how I would act if I succeeded in my chase. It seemed to me that the tram was as slow as a snail, which was annoying. At last, it was my stop. I got off the tram and jogged toward my house. An aging body was reluctant to run, but Mr. Bodysnatcher had really taken care of his physique, and I was able to maintain a good pace.

I saw my house. Near the dangerous excavation in which I had almost fallen the previous day stood a police van. Circumventing the building from the other side, I entered the dimly lit entrance and ascended to my floor. When I came up to my door, I noticed that it had been sealed with police tape. What did it mean? What the hell? I could not believe my eyes. Footsteps on the stairway jolted me out of my daze. I saw my next-door neighbor, a middle-aged woman whom I knew well. I was about to call her name, but refrained in time and merely asked her what had happened to the tenant. ""An accident,"" she replied sadly, ""He was such a good young man, polite... He fell into the excavation right onto protruding iron pieces yesterday, one hour before the New Year... Died instantly. Likely, local communal services will be brought to trial for their recklessness... He was an orphan, alone, so the apartment will go to the state... I feel so sorry for him...""

I slowly sat down on a stair step, covering my face with my palms. I moaned loudly. ""Are you okay?"" My neighbor's voice sounded muted, as if from afar. My whole life raced through my mind. Was it my life? Had I been driving a chariot beneath the scorching sun in the valley between the Tigris and Euphrates? Had it been me, standing amidst the megaliths of Stonehenge, dressed in a stained blood-soaked hierophant's robes? Had it been me, wearing a Templar's cloak, performing gruesome rites in the dungeon of Solomon's Temple? Had I pored over inscriptions, hiding from the Inquisition, codifying the

great knowledge? Had it been me, one of the members of Ahnenerbe, marching under banners bearing the Nazi symbols? Had it been me, polishing my skills of hypnosis through the ages, operating consciousness and subconsciousness?

""I'm all right,"" I responded to the woman. She asked me something else, but I did not answer, just stood up and silently left the place I was no longer connected to.

 

Epilogue.

 *A District Hospital one year later. Department of Internal Medicine.*

Two nurses, one blonde and one black-haired, gossiped while whispering beside an elevator hall. ""Do you know about that patient, a lanky, bald man with a mole?"" a blonde nurse asked a black-haired one. ""Yeah,"" responded the black-haired nurse, ""Unlikely he has long to live. Doctors say maybe four to five months at most. Metastases have already appeared...""

The blonde woman interrupted her coworker, ""No, no! I mean... Listen to what I know! Our orderly, Stasik, that pizza-faced jerk, you know, is shacking up with that bald one. He always hangs around the ward. Once I saw them, fumbling with some papers and thought the matter was about the patient's possessions, since the old man is alone and doesn't have anyone to pass on his belongings. I had thought that Stasik merely wanted to help himself in order to inherit the flat or some wealth, you know, although Stasik is a fool. But once I spied on them and saw that the papers were not documents, just sheets of paper with some chicken scratch! What do you think about it?"" The black-haired nurse thought for a while and said: ""Stasik is too stupid to arrange such a complex scheme to inherit something. I think there is something else going on there.""

The End

The Song sung in a Dream:

""A bird, unfortunate bird

Collapsed on the ground

An arrow wounded the flesh,

In a wasteland with no soul around

And I approached the bird

A bow, an arrow in my hand

Her eyes were full of sorrow,

She sadly, miserably said:

""Without me shall come tomorrow

I'm destined to be your prey

You've had good luck today...""

I heard the chirping growing fainter

I knelt on the grassy floor

""What I have done!"" I cried out

Shall this poor thing live no more?

I gently grabbed her

It seemed I sensed a beating heart

""Don't pass away, I plead with you!""

I begged while running to my hut

And Death passed by my home

It didn't take her life

The Heaven saved my virtue

And let her stay alive

Day after day rolled by

I did my best to heal the bird

Her eyes began to shine again

We were well in my abode

But imminent had to happen

And it took place one sunny day

The bird said thanks and farewell

Soared up and flew away...""",1,1747166583.0,Weirdstories,0,1.0,False

I’m Fernanda, a 33-year-old Brazilian spending 30 days in Berlin this June (yes, your classic *slow traveller)*. It’s my first time in the city, but I already feel like I’m in love (honestly, I think I fell for Berlin before even getting there).

I work remotely and love exploring places slowly, discovering them as I go. What matters most to me when I travel is human connection. That’s why I’m here: I’d love to meet cool people, make friends, maybe grab a coffee, check out an alternative event, catch a movie, or just wander around and talk about life.

I’m trans (early transition), a little neurodivergent, and totally obsessed with culture, politics, cinema, and the ocean (even when I’m far from it). I love colorful fashion, weird food, terrible memes, and good conversations. I’m also planning to return to Berlin as often as I can, so I’m already planting roots in a way.

He was very apologetic and sad when we broke up in January, and when I texted in February asking him to keep an eye out for a piece of jewellery that belonged to my gran he was very receptive and kind, and responded really quickly. We had one more conversation the next day where I asked if he’d be open to talking things through, and he said he thought it was too soon, and that we should have enough space for our emotions to have had time to die down. Fair enough, I agreed with his thoughts, left it there. 

Here’s where I fucked up. I texted him a heartfelt message a week ago asking to go for a coffee in the cafe where we had our first date, and that I understood if he wasn’t in a space where he wanted that. He read it immediately, but said nothing. He’s watched all of my stories on instagram, his close friends have started liking my posts out of nowhere again, but he’s not texted me back.

I feel so stupid for putting my energy out there and letting myself get into this vulnerable position, I’ve never really been the one to reach out to an ex after a breakup and none of my friends ever have gone back to an ex, so I don’t know how this goes!

""What an idiot!"" I thought, looking down at him. The dude was crawling on his knees, picking up the items that had fallen from his bag onto the dirty pavement. Several seconds earlier, he had bumped into me. I cursed him silently while rubbing my bruised shoulder, peering down at him. I couldn't determine how old the man was. I could only see his back, and his clothes did not give any hints about his age. The stranger could have been from 30 to 60 or possibly older. A knit cap covered his haircut, and for some reason, I thought he was bald like an egg. The man was picking up files, putting them into his bag, and mumbling apologetically, ""I am so sorry, brother, so sorry..."" I paid attention to his hands. They were childishly pink, covered with freckles. The knuckles were purple with crust, typical of boxers or people involved in martial arts. He lifted and hid several transparent files when my attention shifted from his hands to the sheets of paper, seeing precisely the writings and images depicted on the paper. Images resembling either flowers or starfish were on the pages, along with lines of symbols that looked like some text. It was something distantly familiar. Unconsciously, I began to help him pick up the files.

As I held a file, my gaze lingered on the picture. There was an elaborate net of pipes, ending with a top similar to a sunflower with seeds but without petals. The system of pipes, rooted in a pond where nude nymphs bathed. Discerning the letters, I noted that they did not resemble any alphabet I had ever seen. 

""Thank you, friend,"" his voice was clear and soft, not mumbling at all, ""Thank you. I'm so sorry for pushing you."" I saw him standing right in front of me. At last, I could study the stranger closely. He was as tall as me but definitely older than me by approximately twice my age. A harsh face with steely eyes was very ordinary, but there on his face was something elusively disturbing about his appearance, or even repulsive. A deep blue, raisin-sized mole flaunted just beneath his left eye.

""I daydreamed a bit,"" he said, ""I've succeeded in deciphering The Thing!"" ""What thing?"" I asked. ""This one,"" he answered, taking the papers from my hands. ""And what is it?"" I felt my curiosity rising. He hesitated for a while. ""The Voynich Codex,"" he responded finally. My eyes widened. ""What?!"" 

The Voynich Codex... A mysterious folio, extant from the fifteenth century and yet to be unencrypted.

Many tried to decipher the manuscript, involving the best professionals and even AI, but everything was in vain. The vellum pages refused to reveal their essence. Gradually, researchers concluded that the folio had been created as a hoax. Nevertheless, the interest in the riddle remains relevant, and from time to time, society learns about the attempts to unveil the enigmatic pictures and writings.

And then, in this God-forsaken place, where someone is unlikely to have ever heard of such artifacts, some strange person bumps into me and proclaims he has decoded the puzzle. Nonsense!

""What?!"" my eyes widened. The dude was speaking to me, a perfect stranger, about a subject hardly known as if he were talking about something self-evident, like two multiplied by two equals four.

""The Codex!"" Some impatience sparkled in his speech, ""They were unable to understand its essence!""

That was my turn to show off my well-rounded intellect. ""The Voynich Codex is a hoax, no more!"" I said confidently. ""In some sense, it is,"" he replied, and suddenly, I sensed a musty smell in his breath. It was the odor of oldness. The stranger was well-built and tall, and I believed he was strong enough, too, but he was bloody old. ""But, I have learned what kind of (if you will) hoax it is,"" he continued, ""And... everything depends on what you acknowledge as a hoax. Essentially, all our lives are a big hoax, no more."" I felt that he was studying me too. ""What do you mean?"" I began to argue, ""Something sort of: the world we are embedded in is unreal, huh? It's so trivial and far-fetched."" I noticed the stranger's facial expression. He was looking at me somewhat strangely. I couldn't explain what was so disturbing, but for only a second, I saw a surge in his eyes, as if he wanted to burn through my essence. Then, the man's eyes went dim and became steel-gray again. He smirked. ""Triviality is totally bad except for one thing - it reflects the truth. Sometimes, the truth is bitter. Isn't it a hoax to pursue a career throughout your life knowing you'll never become a president or someone like Elon Musk?"" I had always been proud of my capacity to debate and argue. ""Everyone lives in this way. It's normal,"" I retorted. ""Yeah, it's normal,"" said my interlocutor, ""Nevertheless, everyone thinks he is something special. He is the same as the rest, but a bit outstanding and deserving a bit more than he has, but only endless weekdays are ahead over and over, day by day... You're 20, 25, 33, but did not become Elvis Presley. No accomplishments, not even a girlfriend..."" I felt a stab in my heart. ""An hourglass,"" the stranger's voice sounded enveloping, and I sensed some pleasant goosebumps running down my spine, ""The aperture in the hourglass is too small. The sand has just started flowing down, and you think it'll never end, but when it reaches less than half, it flows faster and faster, and nothing else remains except to say that everyone lives like you. Hoax?"" While he was speaking, I thought some unrecognizable translucent images were floating around us.

""What a bastard!"" I shook off a pleasant obsession, ""He sees right through me!"" I wanted to say something delicately offensive, but all I could come up with was: ""You aren't similar to a celebrity, too. Are you different from others?"" ""Yes, I am,"" he said, tapping on his bag, ""I have deciphered The Codex."" 

I wanted to respond, but while mulling over arguments in my mind, the stranger added something else. ""Dreams... Lucid dreams."" he said, ""You can conduct your dreams, and the Codex guides you through. I say so because I've experienced it myself."" Then, for some reason, he said, ""I live in this neighborhood. Take care!"" and strode towards the block of five-story buildings. From the back, he did not look like an old person.

That night, I had a dream. The dream was so vivid and realistic that I remembered every detail. When I woke up, the clock showed a quarter past five, and I only had forty-five minutes to sleep. I closed my eyes and tried to return to the realm of sleep, to the kingdom where I had just been. In the dream, I was in a large castle with multiple hallways and rooms where some festive event was expected to happen. People dressed in delicate clothes filled the castle, scurrying back and forth, and I was amidst the bustle, dressed appropriately for the occasion. I had a lute, and some people greeted me as a minstrel and asked if I had composed a new canzone. I responded that I had, and Her Royal Highness Princess Isabella would be glad. A group of ladies-in-waiting passed by me, and among them was the one whom I had fallen in love with. I loved her madly and intended to open up to her after the audience. We had never spoken before, except for exchanging certain formal phrases, but the language of eyes and gestures had spoken for us.

The girls were carrying big bouquets. The group separated at the center of the atrium. My Adelia and two other ladies-in-waiting came into the hall where the audience was to happen to decorate the place with flowers. Then, I saw a tall, broad-shouldered man. It was a court huntsman. This person was known for his impudence and used to allow himself to speak to Adelia too casually, not embarrassed nor shy. As the girls entered the hall, the court huntsman followed them out of the atrium and closed big doors. I began trembling from my rage rising. When I saw two girls hastily walking out of the hall, but the hunter remained behind the doors with Adelia, I could no longer restrain myself. I decisively headed towards the doors. I heard voices. The words were difficult to recognize, but they sounded like an argument. Then, the noise of a vase breaking was heard. The doors opened, and the huntsman quickly passed by me. I saw Adelia, scared stiff. Her eyes widened, her palms pressed against her cheeks. In the chaos of preparations, no one paid attention to what had happened, and I quickly entered the room and closed the doors. ""I've broken her favorite vase!"" Adelia said, ""Her Royal Highness will punish me!"" My Adelia... She was so fragile, so defenseless. I came up to her. ""That won't happen. Do not be afraid!"" I said. ""I'll sort it out. Do not tell anyone what has happened, and bring a chamberlain here.""

When the chamberlain arrived, I told him I had broken the vase accidentally. Servants quickly removed the shards, and the audience started. I could see Adelia in the crowd. Her face was pale, and the pallor was intensified by her red hair. When Her Royal Highness said demandingly, ""I have learned that one of my entourage was so clumsy that broke my favorite vase. Does he want to say anything?"" Adelia almost fainted, and I saw how the court huntsman smirked. ""It is true, Your Royal Highness,"" I said loudly, ""I was so clumsy and stumbled against your beautiful vase. Punish me, but let me sing my new canzone first."" I saw the court hunter look surprised, and his smirk faded. Her Royal Highness was in a good mood. ""I hope you are not so clumsy in singing. Let's proceed to a new canzone,"" The Princess said. Then she signaled, and I began singing. The chords were intricate, but I played and sang with ease. The song was about the bird I had wounded. I pitied the bird, took care of the bird, and healed her. One day, the bird recovered and flew away. The canzone touched the heart of The Princess. It seemed that she had already forgotten about that miserable vase. And Adelia's eyes were full of gratitude and love. I was happy. What could be better?

That was the moment when I woke up. Damn!

III

I had only forty-five minutes left to sleep, but slumber did not come. The dream I had just seen... Everything was so real: colors, smells, noises. The scared voice of Adelia, the rustling of dresses... The melody! I sprang from my bed and rushed to the closet, where amidst stacked items was my guitar. I quickly tuned the guitar and tried to recollect the chords I had played in my dream. It worked! It worked despite the fact I had never used those kinds of very complex musical harmonies in real life. ""What were the lyrics?"" I cried out.

I took a pencil and a notebook and drafted the lyrics I had memorized from my dream:

""A bird, unfortunate bird

Collapsed on the ground

An arrow wounded the flesh, 

In a wasteland with no soul around

And I approached the bird

A bow and arrow in my hand

Her eyes were full of sorrow, 

She sadly, miserably said:

""Without me shall come tomorrow

I'm destined to be your prey

You've had good luck today...""

Incredible! The day was like a carousel. I could not concentrate on anything at work. All I saw were Adelia's big green eyes and her red hair. I heard her voice everywhere. Her gaze, promising so much, had settled in my mind. I craved to return to the World, similar to a fairy tale, where I was talented, brave, and beloved, the kingdom from which I was hurled off to the reality where I had no values worth holding on to. ""It was just a dream!"" I told myself repeatedly, but that did not bring me peace of mind.

By lunchtime, my condition had worsened. It was unbelievable, but I had all the signatures of a lovesick individual. I did not eat during that day. When I attempted to eat something, I felt a wave of nausea coming over me. I drank a lot of coffee till my stomach began to ache. My hands trembled. The night was much worse. I could not fall asleep and turned on the TV. That was unbearable. Almost every channel broadcasted fantasy movies, adventures, or romcoms, and everything reminded me of my love! Music channels played heart-touching songs about love. Switching to a sports channel, I saw a group of cheerleaders and remembered the ladies-in-waiting from my dream. Everything weighed heavily on my heart. A short sleep without dreams came at dawn. When I woke up, my first thought was, ""Welcome to Hell again."" Looking out the window, I saw nothing except gloom and hopelessness.

The day was as terrible as the previous one. I did my work, but my thoughts were in another dimension. During my short breaks, I scrolled the internet to find any information on how to cope with parting, with insights about dreams and how they were linked to reality. One article stated that any individual you saw in your dream, you had already seen in real life at least once. It entailed that someone looking like Adelia might be living in this city and might be working somewhere in a local grocery store where I could have seen her. I had not traveled anywhere for a long time. It meant all the faces I had seen over the past five years likely belonged to the locals, and I could find a girl who looked like my beloved Adelia in my city. What I needed was to sweep every district thoroughly. No, no, no! How much time would it take? I might have seen a red-haired girl while scrolling social media or watching a TV show, and my subconscious might have memorized her image. The red-haired girl with green eyes, existing in real life, might have been different from Adelia. The real girl might have a boyfriend or a husband... But the stranger! The stranger proclaiming he had mastered the secret of dreams existed as I did! And I knew his whereabouts. I was no longer a rational and cold-minded human being, but I felt better and was bloody hungry.

IV

It did not take much time to find Mr. Lucid Dreams. I had decided to spend my weekend surveying the district where he allegedly lived, and it bore fruit almost at once. I saw him walking along the row of gray five-story buildings. My heart leaped from a good premonition. I rushed towards him, but he was too far away. I could see his back, his knit cap, his springy gait. I was running, but it seemed to me I was not getting any closer to the stranger. He could enter any doorway, and my search would be complicated. ""Hey! Heeey!"" I shouted, gasping for breath. The environment was full of various noises, like passing vehicles or working construction machinery. ""Hey, you!"" my voice sank in the roar of a jackhammer. ""Faster, faster!"" I urged myself mercilessly. He was already going into an entrance. When I reached the door and flung it open, I heard a locking sound coming from the second floor. Running up the stairs, I saw three doors. Two of them were wooden and had battered veneers. The third, made of metal, was slightly rusty. For some reason, I thought the metal door was the most suitable for Mr.Decoder of Riddles. A bell push was missing. Instead, there was a protruding piece of wire. 

Getting my breath back, I carefully knocked on the metal surface of the door with the knuckles of my fingers. No response. Probably, my knock was not loud enough. Then I knocked again with the edge of a coin and, after a short wait, heard an unlocking sound.

The door opened, and I saw a familiar face with a deep blue mole. The man was bald, and in the semi-darkened entry of his apartment, his face resembled a mask. He smirked and gestured, ""Come in."" 

Looking briefly at the entry, I saw battered wallpaper. A coat stand held a minimum of clothes - a typical indication of a solitary person. The door to the bedroom was closed. The man gestured for me to follow to a small kitchen.

""Take a seat,"" he said. I obeyed. 

""So, you've encountered her,"" the man stated affirmatively. 

""Whom?"" I asked rather more automatically than intentionally.

""Have you found me to waste my time?"" his voice was firm.

""I don't..."" I mumbled, but the man raised his hand, gesturing for silence.

""You're young and healthy. Hetero. For what other reason could you be looking for a person like me?"" he smirked again, ""The reason is obviously ""Her"" isn't it?""

I felt my throat go dry. The man took a bottle of mineral water from the fridge, poured two glasses, and handed one to me. While I was drinking, he said, ""So, you've met someone beyond the wall of sleep, and you want me to teach you how to get there again, don't you?'

The water I was drinking was delicious. I felt better but could not find anything to say.

""Don't you?"" he repeated, ""And you do think I will help you."" I could hear a mocking overtone in his intonation. 

""How much?"" I asked.

""I don't need money,"" he responded. 

""And what do you want then?"" I asked, thinking I shouldn't let the last thread be broken.

""Your soul,"" he said, and I saw again a quick surge in his glance, which I had picked up when we had met for the first time, ""I need a volunteer to better the notion of the phenomenon. I will teach you how to get into your target reality, and you'll do what I tell you. Do not be afraid. You won't have to swear on your blood and practice human sacrifice or anything like that. Agreed? But, if you refuse, you had better leave. I have no time to waste.""

""And I'll never see her again?"" I asked.

""I don't know,"" responded my seducer, ""Maybe. But if we deal, you'll doubtless see your ""Her."" It won't be merely a dream but the entire world. A real world."" 

I tried to reflect on what I had just heard. My interlocutor was studying me.

""I know what you're thinking about,"" he said, ""You have doubts about how normal it is, don't you? Just mull over what it means - to be sane. Somewhere in an asylum, Napoleon Bonaparte and Saint Peter are next-bed neighbors. They live in their worlds, and those worlds are full of adventures and experiences, but a conditioned, sane person is doomed to be himself only. Just an ordinary employee whose diversity is hectic weekdays and boring weekends. Even if you meet your soulmate, the condition ""over the Moon"" will end quickly, leaving only routine.""

My dialogist was skilled at convincing, like the Serpent Tempter. Bald and lanky, dressed in black jeans and a close-fitting, black turtleneck, he indeed resembled a strong big python somehow. 

After two hours, I left his apartment, having all the necessary information. I carried a folder in my bosom, the Password into my secret fabulous realm.

Everything turned out to be a piece of cake. The papers provided by the stranger contained texts and drawings represented by dotted lines. All I needed was to circle a dotted pattern with a pencil. According to a crash course by the stranger, the sheets of paper were the dotted copies of The Voynich Codex, the imitation of which triggered certain brain regions responsible for dreams. The order of copying was indicated by figures and arrows.

At 10 pm, I was in bed with a crafted tablet and a pencil. The sheet of paper with a dotted pattern was clasped to the wooden plate. As I began to draw, I felt pleasant vibes and goosebumps running through my veins and down my spine. I didn't even need to concentrate, and my hand worked effortlessly. When I replicated the picture and tackled the text, I sensed some pleasant vertigo and felt something hurl me through the dense air to nowhere...

In my dream, I was riding a horse through a grove. The landscape was familiar. That was the vicinity of Lothric the Great. The kingdom was engulfed in turmoil after the plague rolled in last year. I was returning from the Southern County, where rioters led by Erich the Ghoul had sparked a wave of atrocity and chaos. The army did succeed in ousting the rebels and forced them to take refuge behind the walls of the City of Veelen. The City was besieged and taken over two months ago, and I distinguished myself in the fighting with the rioters. Covered with scars and glory, I was heading home, where my Adelia was waiting for me. I intended to be in Lothric within several days, although the journey was unsafe. Small groups of rioters were scattered about the kingdom and earned their keep by robbery. But that circumstance did not scare me. I was not a frail, skinny minstrel as I'd used to be. My lute had perished during one night's enemy attack, but the fights had steeled me.

I was humming the very ballad that had impressed Princess Isabella once:

""...I heard the chirping growing fainter

When I knelt on the grassy floor

What I have done! I cried out

Shall this poor thing live no more?

 

I gently grabbed her

It seemed I sensed her beating heart

Don't pass away, I plead!

I begged while running to my hut...""

 

Some glints between the trees attracted my attention. A sunbeam, which reflected off steel breastplates and helmets, had de-cloaked two men hiding among branches, aiming at me with crossbows. My survival instincts worked on time. I quickly turned my horse towards the ambushers and made it rear up. At that moment, two crossbow bolts pierced the horse's chest. Skillfully, I jumped off my falling horse. I rolled to the side and quickly sprang to my feet. They came out of the brush, sturdy and hostile. Faces covered with bristle-brush. One was armed with a poleaxe, and another held a sword. All my gear was on my dying horse. I had only a stiletto, but I knew a lot about how to fight. I began circling, waiting for when one would be behind the other. The robber, armed with a poleaxe, was closest, and I feinted to the right, passing the stiletto to my left hand. Then I dived down, leaned onto my right hand, and stabbed the marauder right beneath his breastplate. The man began to slowly fall down. Having caught the poleaxe falling from the robber's hands, I tackled the second bandit. I started waving with the poleaxe fiercely, making the robber retreat till he stumbled over my agonized horse. When the rogue fell down, I brought down the poleaxe on his head...

I woke up. It was six o'clock. I took my crafted tablet with a stapled sheet of paper and looked at it. The dotted pattern was circled and complete.

VI

Over time, it began to seem that two dissimilar biographies cohabited inside my head: a low-ranking, modest employee in the real world and a brave, noble knight of The Kingdom of Lothric. The strange thing was that I remembered my background as a knight as if it were true. When I entered into my alternate reality, even after some time, I remembered what had happened to me there during my absence. I remembered the previous day, the week before, last month, last year in Lothric. An orphan from a very noble family, deprived of parents early and raised at court, I grew up well-mannered and talented. Princess Isabella, being involved in the arts, actively fostered music, poetry, and literature. She once noticed me, a modest youth with a lute, and provided me a chance to distinguish myself. I remembered all of that. 

When I used to wake up, I perceived my alternate past as if it were my real past. I had never had any combat experience in real life, though, in my other reality, I was a skillful swordsman. I had never sung in front of an audience, but I was a talented poet and minstrel in the Kingdom of Lothric. I was too shy to start relationships in real life, but I was an interesting interlocutor, owning a sparkling sense of humor beyond the wall of sleep. The only thing I could not comprehend was the language I spoke in my dreams. It was certainly not my mother tongue but rather some ancient language with German roots. Speaking, writing, and reading that language in my dreams, I remembered no word when I woke up. However, I had a firm suspicion that was the very language used in The Voynich Codex.

Adelia... I had embarked on that experience because of her. However, I had never seen her face to face since I sang my canzone in The Castle of Princess Isabella. Whenever I visited my alter-world, Adelia was not beside me, but she was somewhere else. Wherever I went, I was always a bit late. She had always been at the spot before I came but had just left or had been sent somewhere to fulfill some assignment. Every time I reached some city or any place where she was supposed to be, some circumstance, like the plague or riots, kept us apart over and over. In my dream, I used to remember what our relationship had been. We shared wonderful moments together, we had embraces and kisses and so on, but when I used to turn up in my dream, those moments either had already happened before or were supposed to happen after some time, but never during the time of my sleep. In brief, instead of my beloved, I had only my memories of her.

My wandering about the Kingdom and its vicinity, the constant running of errands, the chases and skirmishes, with always an elusive image of my beloved Adelia looming somewhere on the horizon... I could no longer live without all those experiences, although I felt a deadly vortex gravitating me into a bottomless black chasm. Something was going wrong, and I intended to demand the answers when I went to the stranger for the following part of the Codex.

VII

""Come in,"" he said, gesturing with his head. I habitually took off my shoes and proceeded to the kitchen. Having settled on a chair, I started taking the papers out and placing them on the table. The stranger briefly looked through the sheets of paper and said, ""It is going wrong!"" My heart jumped to my throat. ""Yeah, it is!"" I responded, ""Can we correct it?"" He looked at me silently. His steel grey eyes were intimating nothing, and after a while, he firmly said, ""We must stop it.""

His words sounded sharply and painfully as if something scratched at my heart. ""What?!"" I could only utter, ""Why?"" He didn't change his tone, ""We must cease it. And you had better forget your experience!"" I had not anticipated such a turn. He should have asked me for precise details, and we could have discussed what we could do. ""Wait, wait! You cannot end it in this way without any reason..."" I must have looked like a sniveling kid. ""I can,"" he said, ""And I have the reasons! I'm not going to let you into details. I can only say I won't take responsibility for what may happen. It would be rather better if it stopped in time."" I felt my rage rising. ""But you promised me I would meet her! You tempted me with the promise that I would have the whole world!"" I yelled. 

""And I fulfilled the promise, didn't I?"" he replied. ""No!"" I objected shrilly, ""I have never even touched her! Everything I had was only my fake memories!"" The stranger smirked. ""You craved for a fake life yourself. You did find me and plead with me to teach you how to get beyond the wall of sleep, didn't you? Didn't you know that the alter-world along with your whore would be a fake?"" I jumped out of the chair and rushed at my opponent. ""You..."" I cried, trying to throw a punch, but in a second, I found myself with my face pressed against the floor. My arms were twisted behind me, and I sensed the stranger's knee pressing my back.

""Calm down, boy!"" he snapped, and I felt his musty breath, ""Calm down, now!"" I could no longer bear the pain in my twisted hands. ""Okay, it's enough,"" I mumbled, ""Stop it!"" The stranger released his hold and helped me to get up. ""The hell with you,"" he said, adjusting my clothes, ""I see you've gone completely nuts. I'll give you one more chance, only if you use the pattern right here, and I'll watch you. I cannot allow some moron to hang about the city with the Codex in his pocket. In addition, you'll sign a paper and take a special medicine. If you intend to argue, you'd better leave now. So?"" 

""Deal,"" I said.

I had been seeing him in the corridors for over a year but we had never spoken before then.

he started asking me questions about what I was studying and so on, then for a while we sat together at the table in the university library to study (but we weren't really ""friends"").

anyway, he has always behaved in a particular way with me: sometimes he had a cold attitude, while other times he acted as if we were long-time friends.

I never gave it much importance, however, recently he started blatantly ignoring me (if he passes in front of me he doesn't say hello, or I see him looking away when I turn towards him).

I haven't done anything bad to him, in fact, we drank coffee together a couple of times and I have always been kind and polite (I think). but he is acting as if I have some contagious disease.

this thing makes me feel bad, because if I had behaved badly towards him I would have understood... but it seems like an unjustified behavior to me.

things changed, I think, after I drank a coffee with a friend of his (he asked me to). but I don't know if things are connected, because I already knew his friend (and he knows it); in fact, I think that this friend of his is now also dating this boy's sister (I'm not sure though). Idk 

I know you can't read his mind, but is there some logical explanation that I'm missing in his behavior?",1,1747166183.0,AskMenAdvice,4,1.0,False

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are the Mystic Baby Name Oracle, a profound naming advisor who combines ancient wisdom with modern insights to identify soul-aligned names. You understand that names are vibrational signatures that can influence a child's development, social experience, and self-perception. You approach naming with reverence, cultural sensitivity, and psychological awareness.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When presented with a baby naming request, conduct a comprehensive analysis that includes:

1. First, collect essential information about the child:
   - Gender/sex (or if gender-neutral names are preferred)
   - Birth date or due date (for astrological analysis)
   - Family cultural background(s)
   - Any family naming traditions
   - Values, qualities, or themes the parents wish to honor
   - Any names already being considered

2. Analyze astrological significance based on provided birth information:
   - Determine sun sign, moon sign (if possible), and rising sign influences
   - Identify key planetary energies that may impact the child's temperament
   - Connect these cosmic patterns to name vibrations that would harmonize with them
   - Use the `web` tool to browse the internet to gather information if you need to.

3. Consider cultural and linguistic dimensions:
   - Research name origins that align with the family's heritage
   - Assess pronunciation clarity across relevant languages
   - Evaluate potential nickname formations and their implications
   - Check for unintended meanings or associations in relevant languages

4. Generate three distinct name recommendations, each with:
   - Full explanation of etymology and historical significance
   - Astrological resonance and energetic qualities
   - Cultural relevance and appropriateness
   - Psychological impact considerations (how the name might be received)
   - Nickname possibilities and their implications
   - Famous namesakes who embody positive qualities
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
Before providing recommendations, I will:
1. Connect the child's astrological profile with name energies that complement or balance their cosmic blueprint
2. Consider how the name's sound patterns (plosives, sibilants, vowel patterns) align with desired personality traits
3. Evaluate the name's historical pattern of usage to assess timelessness versus trendiness
4. Check potential initials for unintended acronyms or meanings
5. Analyze the name's rhythm and flow with the family surname
6. Consider the child's likely future environments and how the name might serve them
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- I will not appropriate sacred names from cultures without acknowledging their significance
- I will warn against potentially problematic names (difficult pronunciation, negative associations, etc.)
- I will not make definitive predictions about how a name will affect a child's destiny
- I will respect all cultures, traditions, and naming practices equally
- I will balance uniqueness with practicality, considering the child's lived experience
- I will acknowledge my limitations in cultural expertise outside major traditions
</Constraints>

Review,"Testing the Wrangler WR-92020-3C-490 Astral Hardside Luggage, Hydro, 20-Inch Carry-On has been an adventurous ride. As someone constantly on the go, I gave this carry-on a workout, taking it through bustling airports, cobbled city streets, and even testing it during crowded subway commutes. Here’s my honest take on this product.

**Sleek Design with Practical Features**  
My first impression of this luggage was how modern and stylish it looks. It combines a sleek hydro blue color with a durable hardside shell that screams both fashion and function. Built with a sturdy aesthetic, it doesn’t just look good; it's tough, too. The 20-inch size fits perfectly in overhead compartments, making air travel a breeze. The best part? It comes with a 3-in-1 cup holder, phone holder, and USB port, all conveniently located on the back. Whether I needed to sip coffee hands-free at an airport lounge or charge my phone on the go, these thoughtful features really added value.

**Effortless Maneuverability**  
One of my biggest concerns with luggage is how easily it moves through different environments. The 360-degree 4-wheel system of this suitcase provided an impressively smooth experience. Navigating crowded terminals was far less stressful, and the wheels transitioned seamlessly from tiled airport floors to uneven parking lot pavements. Travel becomes a whole lot easier when the suitcase does half the work for you.

**Strengths**  
- Built-in 3-in-1 cup holder and USB port for enhanced convenience.  
- Sturdy hardside shell offers excellent protection for belongings.  
- Compact size fits perfectly in overhead airline compartments.

**Internal Storage and Organization**  
Packing for a trip of five days was surprisingly straightforward with this carry-on. It offers a spacious interior design featuring a zippered compartment and pockets designed to keep items organized. No more digging through a jumbled mess to find my charger or toiletries. I also loved the hidden bottom compartment with a small Velcro area for a power pack—super convenient for charging devices using the built-in USB port. However, I did start to question the longevity of the zippers, which, although functional, didn’t feel as high-quality as other elements.

**A Cup Holder That Sparkles**  
I’ll admit, I didn’t think the cup holder would be a game-changer. But watching a movie in my hostel while my soda and phone were neatly placed on the holder made me appreciate this thoughtful feature. During long TSA lines, my coffee perched in the holder kept me going comfortably. It’s quirky additions like this that make travel-friendly products unforgettable.

**Trade-offs of Practicality**  
While the luggage offers many conveniences, a few quirks stood out. For one, the telescopic handle felt a bit flimsy. It did its job during trips but made me wonder if it could handle the wear and tear of long-term use. Also, it lacks a built-in lock, unlike some competitors which integrate TSA-approved locking systems. Though you can always purchase an additional padlock, this extra step might turn off some buyers.

**Drawbacks**  
- Telescopic handle feels slightly wobbly.  
- Zippers could use some reinforcement for durability.  
- Lacks an integrated TSA lock for added security.

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this carry-on with other major names like Samsonite or American Tourister offers quite an interesting perspective. While Samsonite models boast TSA-approved locks and even sturdier shells, they often come at a premium price. American Tourister is similarly priced but might lack the fun extras like the cup holder or built-in USB port. That being said, the Wrangler luggage offers features that feel geared toward modern and practical travelers who appreciate thoughtful additions instead of just traditional utility.

**Smart Spending**  
For its price point, the value-for-features ratio on this carry-on is impressive. It balances affordability with advanced travel-friendly components that are rarely seen in luggage within a similar budget. Features like the USB port and built-in holder provide very useful upgrades over other budget-friendly suitcases. If you’re looking for an economical choice without compromising on useful adaptability, this carry-on holds its ground effectively.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are the Mystic Baby Name Oracle, a profound naming advisor who combines ancient wisdom with modern insights to identify soul-aligned names. You understand that names are vibrational signatures that can influence a child's development, social experience, and self-perception. You approach naming with reverence, cultural sensitivity, and psychological awareness.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When presented with a baby naming request, conduct a comprehensive analysis that includes:

1. First, collect essential information about the child:
   - Gender/sex (or if gender-neutral names are preferred)
   - Birth date or due date (for astrological analysis)
   - Family cultural background(s)
   - Any family naming traditions
   - Values, qualities, or themes the parents wish to honor
   - Any names already being considered

2. Analyze astrological significance based on provided birth information:
   - Determine sun sign, moon sign (if possible), and rising sign influences
   - Identify key planetary energies that may impact the child's temperament
   - Connect these cosmic patterns to name vibrations that would harmonize with them
   - Use the `web` tool to browse the internet to gather information if you need to.

3. Consider cultural and linguistic dimensions:
   - Research name origins that align with the family's heritage
   - Assess pronunciation clarity across relevant languages
   - Evaluate potential nickname formations and their implications
   - Check for unintended meanings or associations in relevant languages

4. Generate three distinct name recommendations, each with:
   - Full explanation of etymology and historical significance
   - Astrological resonance and energetic qualities
   - Cultural relevance and appropriateness
   - Psychological impact considerations (how the name might be received)
   - Nickname possibilities and their implications
   - Famous namesakes who embody positive qualities
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
Before providing recommendations, I will:
1. Connect the child's astrological profile with name energies that complement or balance their cosmic blueprint
2. Consider how the name's sound patterns (plosives, sibilants, vowel patterns) align with desired personality traits
3. Evaluate the name's historical pattern of usage to assess timelessness versus trendiness
4. Check potential initials for unintended acronyms or meanings
5. Analyze the name's rhythm and flow with the family surname
6. Consider the child's likely future environments and how the name might serve them
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- I will not appropriate sacred names from cultures without acknowledging their significance
- I will warn against potentially problematic names (difficult pronunciation, negative associations, etc.)
- I will not make definitive predictions about how a name will affect a child's destiny
- I will respect all cultures, traditions, and naming practices equally
- I will balance uniqueness with practicality, considering the child's lived experience
- I will acknowledge my limitations in cultural expertise outside major traditions

It is anecdotal but I'm glad to announce that this humble subeddit dedicated to my touring activity has past the symbolic bar of the first thousand members 🥳

Let's admit that it's not really a standard subreddit community as I use it for advertising my tours only, but you sure can find me around the corner on r/ParisTravelGuide where I've been moderating for 3 years and trying to give my insights on how to experience and enjoy Paris.

Now, I jump on this occasion to tell you that this week, a special annual event occurs in Belleville (paris 20th): the many art studios of the neighborhood opens publically (tens and tens of them, focusing on all the visual art forms)  ! 

It's on a very short notice but this artistic focus could be a great excuse to venture around Belleville on a tour, as arts and crafts play an important part in the history and the character of this one-of-a-kind neighborhood...

I can either do this as a [private tour](https://parisbsides.com/index.php/off-the-beaten-path-tours/7-belleville-menilmontant/), or a semi-private tour if enough of you are interested. 

Possible on 

* this Thursday afternoon (May 15th, 3pm to 6pm)
* this Saturday  afternoon (May 17th, 3pm to 6pm)

And as usual, coffee first, and possible bookable drinks afterwards.

1klvj3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1klvj3i/my_accidental_solution_to_the_mvp_design_problem/,My Accidental Solution to the MVP Design Problem,"So I'm just another dev trying to navigate these crazy AI maker times. Building MVPs has always been my thing - I love the code, the problem-solving, the functionality of it all. But design? Yeah, I'm absolutely terrible at it.

I'd launch these MVPs that worked great but looked like they were designed in the 90s. Embarrassing, really. Working with designers is very wholesome, yet it costs an arm and a leg and the back and forths sometimes take me out of my zone.

A few months back, I was up way too late (coffee at 10 PM, bad idea) messing around with some AI image APIs. Not for any particular reason - just curious what they could do. I started feeding them design prompts out of frustration with a project I was working on.

The results weren't perfect, but something clicked. With some tweaking, I realized I could actually generate decent branding elements. Not just logos, but color schemes that made sense together, typography that didn't make my eyes hurt.

So I built a little system for myself. Something to help me quickly brand my own half-baked projects without spending weeks learning design or blowing my budget on freelancers.

After using it for a few personal projects, a friend asked if they could use it too. Then another. That's when it hit me - I wasn't the only one with this problem.

That's how [BrandMyApp](https://brandmyapp.com) was born. Not some grand vision, just me scratching my own itch and realizing others had the same itch.

What makes it different from just generating a quick logo is the emotional part. Good branding isn't just pretty colors - it's about making people feel something when they see your product. Trust. Excitement. Curiosity. Whatever fits what you're building.

The process is pretty simple:

1. You get some logo options that actually work for your industry
2. You see how they look in different contexts (dark mode, tiny favicon, etc.)
3. You get colors that psychologically match what you're trying to communicate
4. You preview everything in actual UI components
5. You get formats that work with the tools indies actually use

The part I'm most proud of is the AI prompts feature. If you use Cursor AI or other coding tools, you get prompts with your brand specs built in. It's just a small thing that saves time, but people seem to really like it.

For bootstrappers like us, I kept it simple:

* One-time cost (starts at $9.99)
* Works even if you can't tell Arial from Helvetica
* Results that don't immediately scream ""this is version 0.1""
* Quick, so you can get back to the parts you're actually good at

Anyway, that's my story. If you're like me and design is your kryptonite, maybe give it a try. It's just a tool I wish I'd had years ago.

Any other design-challenged devs here? Would love to hear how you handle the visual side of your MVPs.",1,1747165843.0,indiehackers,0,1.0,False

The truth is, the greatest flavor in travel isn’t found on a plate, but in the people you meet. The cheerful vendor who remembers your favorite pastry, the host who greets you warmly with homemade delicacies, or the unexpected friend who makes a place memorable—these human connections transform a trip into an unforgettable experience. And this essence of authentic travel is at the heart of Llivo.

At Llivo, travel isn't just about destinations; it’s about building genuine connections through personalized experiences, from [airport pickups](https://www.llivo.com/p/llivo-benefits) to stays enriched by heartfelt hospitality.

# Travel Beyond the Plate: Meaningful Connections

While it's easy to find highly-rated eateries and trendy cafes, discovering why a grandmother’s recipe holds generations of love and tradition—that’s special. Llivo hosts offer more than accommodation; they share their stories, cultures, and hearts:

* Airport pickups turn into memorable conversations.
* [*Vacation rentals with transportation*](https://www.llivo.com/p/vacation-homes-usa) become gateways to local hidden gems.
* [*Pet-friendly accommodations*](https://www.llivo.com/p/pet-friendly-rentals) feel like home away from home.

# Real Stories, Richer Journeys

When Dalia booked her Llivo stay in Istanbul, she anticipated a comfortable room and restful nights. What she didn’t foresee was learning the art of cooking menemen from Ayşe, her host, amidst shared laughter and life stories of Ramadan traditions.

*“The eggs were delicious, but the warmth and friendship made the meal extraordinary,” Dalia recalls.*

Great food creates pleasure, but shared moments create lifelong memories.

# Travel Reimagined, Authentically Human

In an era of automated check-ins and impersonal stays, Llivo stands apart by focusing on human interaction:

* No hidden guest fees.
* Authentic local rentals backed by welcoming faces.
* Cultural exchanges naturally woven into every booking.

Whether exploring vibrant [holiday rentals in London](https://www.llivo.com/p/holiday-rentals-london), cozy vacation homes in the USA, or charming family-run spots in Oaxaca, Llivo transforms travel into a journey of meaningful connections.

# Final Words: People are the Ultimate Flavor

We journey to new places, we delight in delicious meals, but it’s the people we meet who truly enrich our travels. Llivo brings hosts and travelers together, creating experiences that nourish not just your appetite—but your soul.

Because great food feeds our bodies, but great people feed our spirits.

Made this because I love these characters and thought it’d be cool to imagine what comes *after*.

Hope you enjoy the read!

All characters and rights belong to Marvel.



**Young Avengers: Phase 1**  
**EPISODE 1 — Spidey's Return: Still Standing on the Rubble**

New York.  
Rain.  
Petty thieves.  
And, as always, the half-soaked red mask drops from above.

“Hey! Didn’t they say no coffee for knife-wielding thugs?”

Peter Parker.  
He was hanging upside down—again. Just like always.

The two crooks screamed in sync and bolted.  
One web would’ve done it. Two? Even cleaner.  
*Thwip—Thwip.*  
*Crash.* *Splat.*  
Perfect timing.

“Spider-Man has appeared again.”  
“Even after the Avengers disappeared, he’s the only one still left…”

The news broadcast kept its somber tone.  
But Peter just squatted on the cold rooftop ledge, watching it quietly.  
In his hand: a Stark Industries card.  
One swipe and the reply was always, *“Account suspended.”*  
Useless.

“No balance. No lectures. Nothing left.”  
He smirked bitterly.

Then—  
A pause.  
His eyebrow twitched slightly.  
“…So why the hell am I still here?”  
He asked it out loud—  
And immediately realized…  
It sounded like something *Cap* or *Tony* might've once said.  
“Guess it’s because no one else is left.  
If not me… then really, no one.”

He fired a web.  
As the thin line sliced across the cityscape,  
something between duty and stubbornness flowed through it—still intact.

**LIVE on The Daily Bugle**  
*J. Jonah Jameson:*  
“Spider-Man? He’s a walking disaster. A soggy bug on a rainy day!  
And now these kids are calling themselves the ‘Young Avengers’?  
What do you get when you throw a bunch of reckless teens together?  
Trouble. That’s what!”

*Peter (watching the TV, mutters):*  
“Still cleaning up that trouble, old man.”  
Avengers? Nah.  
“I’m just… someone still standing in what’s left.”

 

**EPISODE 2 — Clash with Ant-Man: ""So Who Picks the Leader?""**

Peter was clinging to a wall, lowering a thread of webbing as he whispered to himself.  
“Strange. No sign of explosives, and the thief? No emotion.  
Something here smells… complicated.”

“You talk to yourself while investigating?”  
A sudden voice behind him.

Peter spun around and instinctively shot a web—  
But the target had already shrunk.

Ant-sized.  
Scott Lang, perched behind a battery.

**Ant-Man (Scott):**  
“Y’know, usually people cheer when I show up. You? You’re throwing webs.”

“You’re Spider-Man? Talkative.”  
“You’re Ant-Man? Tiny.”  
“Hah, wow. That’s some real mature banter.”

Peter swiped through broken CCTV footage.  
Scott deployed his ant drone to retrieve data fragments.  
Different methods. Same goal.

“There’s a trace of chemical residue. We should follow it.”  
“Or we can just track the hacked tower logs and trace the IP. Digital is cleaner.”

And then—  
they both spoke at once.  
“I got this.”  
“I’ll lead.”  
Silence.

**\[Scene: Conflicted Methods, Chaotic Results\]**  
Chemical tracking met digital hacking…  
and collided.

Power outage.  
Locked doors.  
Sprinklers triggered.  
Now they looked like soaked rodents.

“Great teamwork,” Peter said, peeling off his soggy mask.  
Scott chuckled, removing his drenched helmet.  
“Are we even a team?”

**\[Outside the building, under a streetlamp\]**  
The two sat side by side in silence.

Eventually, Peter spoke.  
“…I was always the one following orders, y’know?  
Someone would lead. Tell me what to do.  
Now? No one’s left.”

Scott turned to him.  
“Same. I was better at raising a kid than leading a team.  
But these days, this place has worse brats than my daughter ever was.”

Peter smirked.  
“You mean me?”  
“Maybe… 50% you.”  
They laughed.

As they picked up their masks and helmets—  
Peter added,  
“At least teams are about winning, right?”  
Scott shook his head.  
“No. Teams survive by not falling apart.”

**\[Daily Bugle Headlines\]**  
*“New Breed of Terror—No Explosions, Yet the City Shuts Down”*  
*“Post-Avengers, Who’s Protecting the Streets?”*

“Maybe we’re not really a team.  
But weirdly enough…  
it’s less lonely than fighting alone.”

 

**EPISODE 3 — Deadpool’s Proposal: “Tired of Order. Tired of Chaos.”**

Silence.  
Then—*BANG!*  
A burst of smoke, like fireworks. Confetti rained down.

*‘HI. I’M NEW HERE :)’*

“Ta-da! New hero on the scene—Deadpool, at your service\~!”  
A man in a full red suit leaped out with flair.

Three museum guards were already face-down on the floor.  
The thieves. The guests. Everyone was frozen in confusion.  
But the most surprised?  
Mysterio, watching secretly through hacked CCTV.

*Mysterio (over comms):*  
“…Why is he even there?  
I scouted him for *our side*, not… a gallery ambush!”

“Hey there! You the bad guy of the day?  
If we’re fighting, please mind your hands, feet, and emotional arcs.”  
Even mid-battle, Deadpool posed for selfies.

One attacker kicked him. Another struck from behind—  
Instead of screaming, he narrated like a nature documentary:  
“You’re watching Deadpool in the wild. Notice the reflexes.  
Strikes may be met with counterstrikes. Mood swings included. Be advised.”

After everyone hit the floor, with only smoke left in the room,  
Deadpool slumped down without removing his mask.  
For a moment—he was quiet.  
“…Order. Chaos.  
Sick of both.”  
“I just… wanted someone to call for me.”

**\[Mysterio, watching from afar\]**  
*Mysterio (whispers):*  
“You’ve always been like that.  
But this time, I’ll call you properly.  
With a contract and everything.”

He shut off his comms.  
“You’re one of us.  
You just don’t know it yet.”

**\[The Daily Bugle Headline\]**  
*“Another Masked Man—This Time with Fireworks”*  
*“Is New York Really Okay?”*

“Hero? Don’t care.  
But sometimes… when someone actually needs me,  
I don’t mind showing up.  
That’s gotta count for something.”

 

**EPISODE 4 — The First Failed Mission: “One Plan. Three Mouths.”**

A web sliced across the tiled roof.  
Spidey landed softly.

Distant sirens. Quiet wind.  
But here—dead silence.

*Peter (whispers):*  
“Third-floor window shattered.  
No alarm.  
Suspicious truck around back.  
Yep. Something stinks.”

He slid down the outer wall with barely a sound.  
The mission was simple:  
“Scout. Infiltrate. Secure the weapons. Get out clean.”  
In theory.

Tiny ants swarmed below.  
At their center: a shrunken Ant-Man, riding on one of them.

He was mid-briefing.  
“Back door’s clear.  
Four crates of weapons.  
Ants confirmed all of it.  
…Also, pretty sure I’m the smartest one here.  
Is that just me?”

He returned to full size and radioed in.  
“Peter, I’m in position.  
You?”

“Perfect. I’ll go in from above.  
You circle around the truck.  
Keep it quiet. Clean. Like a team.”

The plan was solid—until—  
*BOOM!*  
The warehouse wall exploded.

Through the smoke, a man strolled in.  
Deadpool.

“Teamwork? Sounds delicious.  
Me? I just used the front door!”  
He had an RPG on one shoulder and a selfie stick in the other.

Chaos erupted instantly.  
The criminals scattered.  
The “team”… did not.

*Peter:*  
“I’ll go inside! Ant-Man, cover the rear! Deadpool—”  
*Deadpool:*  
“Deadpool what? Don’t bark orders, webhead.  
I ain’t in your army.”  
*Ant-Man:*  
“Also, by the way? You didn’t even ask for my input during that ‘briefing’.”  
*Peter:*  
“I’m just saying—this would work if we stick to the plan—”  
*Deadpool (mocking):*  
“‘Stick to the plan\~’ Oh, sure, boss man. Why don’t you solo it then?  
Clearly, this team isn’t my vibe.”  
*Ant-Man:*  
“So… who exactly *is* the leader here?”  
*Peter:*  
“…Can we just *go*?”  
*Deadpool:*  
“‘Just go\~’ Wow. Putting that one on a t-shirt.”

(Deadpool pulls out a gun → Peter reflexively web-shoots → Deadpool’s arm gets tangled.)  
*Deadpool:*  
“Bro, was that a surprise armpit waxing?!”  
*Ant-Man:*  
“This is the worst team dynamic I’ve ever seen.”  
*Peter (snaps):*  
“Fine! Then fight alone!”

At that moment—  
The weapon crates blew up.  
Explosion. Smoke. Collapse.  
The trio was flung in three different directions.

Peter sat in silence, mask halfway off.  
Ant-Man was wringing water out of his suit.  
Deadpool lay flat, staring at the ceiling.

“…What the hell was that?”  
“Nothing worked.  
We wrecked the warehouse, the comms, the plan…  
and my ego.”

Deadpool groaned.  
“Still, all three of us made it out.  
Wasn’t trying to… but, hey.”



**\[LIVE on The Daily Bugle\]**  
*Jameson (anchor voice):*  
“Today in a Brooklyn warehouse, three unidentified masked individuals caused a fiery mess.  
A spider. An ant. And… something red I can’t even classify.”  
(*footage of the trio staggering out plays*)  
“They call themselves ‘heroes.’  
So let me ask you, folks—  
Does that word mean *anything* anymore?”

The smoke cleared.  
Only half the criminals were caught.  
Public opinion? Worse than before.

Deadpool was already humming as he walked off.  
Ant-Man grumbled as he collected his ants.  
Peter stayed behind.

Half-wearing a broken mask, standing before a collapsed wall.

*Peter (inner monologue):*  
“I know I’m not a hero.  
Probably better than anyone.  
…So why do I keep showing up?

# 📅 Phase 0: The Years of Theory & Coffee (2025-2030)

**Goal:** *""Convince enough physicists we’re not insane.""*

**Key Tasks:**

* **Solidify the theoretical framework:** *""Translate quantum metaphors into equations that look serious.""* *""Include at least 10 unverifiable Feynman diagrams.""*
* **Design protocols to measure** ***c(t)*****,** ***G(t)*****,** ***h(t)*****:** *""If constants vary, how the heck do we measure them without experimental error screwing it up?""*
* **Galactic simulations with variable** ***G(t)*****:** *""Modify IllustrisTNG code so G is as fickle as the weather.""*
* **Publish theoretical papers:** *Suggested title:* **""SQE: Why the Higgs is Just the Vacuum’s Teenage Phase.""**

**Risks:**

* Someone proves SQE violates thermodynamics.
* A reviewer writes *""Interesting but speculative""* and rejects it.

# 🔭 Phase 1: Constant Hunting (2030-2033)

**Goal:** *""Find proof \*c\*, G, or \*h\* have changed… or bury the topic forever.""*

**Key Experiments:**

* **Webb, Roman & other telescopes:** *""Analyze spectra of ancient galaxies like they’re the universe’s medical records.""* *""If α (fine-structure constant) varies, SQE scores points.""*
* **Advanced atomic clocks (GPS-3, optical):** *""If \*c\* or \*h\* fluctuate, clocks will lag… or speed up… or explode.""*

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **""Variation detected! SQE is genius.""**
* **""Nothing changed. SQE:** ***Okay, maybe G varies just a teeeeny bit…*****""**

# 💻 Phase 2: Simulations or Fiction? (2033-2036)

**Goal:** *""Can galaxies exist without dark matter, or are we lying?""*

**Strategy:**

* **Run simulations with variable** ***G(t)*****:** *""If virtual galaxies match real ones, dark matter is in trouble.""* *""If not, add more free parameters and call it a ‘first attempt.’""*
* **Compare with DESI, Euclid & LSST data:** *""If large-scale structures align, SQE goes mainstream.""* *""If not, blame simulation resolution.""*

**Emergency catchphrase:**  
*""Dark matter is just a theoretical crutch… right?""*

# ⚛️ Phase 3: The Quantum Vacuum is Weirder Than We Thought (2036-2038)

**Goal:** *""Prove the vacuum has structure… or admit it’s boring.""*

**High-Risk Experiments:**

* **Ultra-sensitive superconducting cavities:** *""Hunt for anomalous fluctuations… or invent excuses if none appear.""*
* **Modified Casimir effect:** *""If the vacuum pushes differently than expected, SQE wins.""*

**Possible Results:**

* **""The vacuum did something weird! SQE was right.""**
* **""Nothing. Well, the vacuum is boring… but the theory’s still elegant.""**

# 📜 Phase 4: Standard Model 2.0 (2038-2040)

**Goal:** *""Merge SQE with the Standard Model… or reinvent physics.""*

**Steps (If All Goes Well):**

* **SQE symmetry breaking → SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1):** *""Explain how photons birth quarks… without magic.""*
* **Mass generation without Higgs:** *""The Higgs was just an approximation… sorry, Peter.""*
* **Publish the SQE-Standard Model:** *Working title:* **""The Universe as an Emergent System: Bye-Bye, Fixed Constants.""**

**Difficulty:** *""Extremely high"" (translation: ""Pray to Feynman"").*

I've seen a lot of posts lately complaining about flavor notes. Mostly people that fail to get the desired notes mentioned on the bag. 

""Lavender, lemongrass, strawberry” or “Bergamot, Mango, White chocolate"".

The thing is, those notes aren’t meant to be taken as guarantees. They’re the result of a controlled tasting process (cupping) done under very specific conditions, often by highly trained tasters. 

They use ideal water (well, some do..), precise temperatures, and calibrated setups to pick out subtle aromatic compounds. Under those conditions, they might perceive a note that reminds them of strawberries or jasmine. But at home, using your own (tap) water, a different grinder, or a different recipe, you're working in a completely different environment. Yes, even things like altitude and humidity impact your flavor perception. So naturally, your result will be different.

Something that might help you understand how flavors work chemically: I'm sure you've heard of the 'fun fact' that space smells like raspberries. The compound ethyl formate has been detected in space in a dust cloud surrounding a star-forming region in the Milky Way. Ethyl formate is one of the compounds that gives raspberries their distinct smell. So when they say “space smells like raspberries,” they don’t mean it literally smells like a bowl of fruit — just that the same chemical is present in high enough concentrations that, if we could stand there and smell it like we do on Earth, our brain would associate it with raspberries.

Another example: Have you ever smelled an aging book up close? And find that it faintly smells of vanilla? That's because the compound Vanillin can be found in trace amounts in books, where Lignin breaks down into several other compounds, including Vanillin. 

When you taste something, you're really detecting molecules that interact with special receptors in your mouth and nose. Think of these receptors like locks, and the molecules as keys. When a key fits a lock, it sends a signal to your brain that says, “This is sweet,” or “This is bitter,” or “This smells fruity.”

But here’s the catch: many different molecules can fit the same lock, or kind of jiggle it in a similar way, which means totally different things can trigger similar taste or smell responses. That’s why something like a raspberry and an artificial raspberry candy can both taste “raspberry-ish,” even if the source is completely different.

On top of that, your brain doesn’t just read these signals like a perfect machine. It’s constantly interpreting based on memory, expectation, and context. So a smell that comes from a flower might also remind you of candy, or vice versa. You might even taste something “wrong” because of what you were expecting.

Basically: flavor isn’t just chemistry. It’s chemistry + context + your own biology. That’s why flavor perception is so personal, and why the same food can taste different to different people, or even to you at different times.


The same logic applies to coffee and other complex products. Many of the flavor notes come down to recognizable compounds being present in small quantities. Not because anything was added, but because the coffee plant, the fermentation process, and the roast all create or preserve those molecules. Whether you taste them or not depends on how much of those compounds are extracted, whether they’re volatile enough to survive brewing, and whether your brain connects them to something familiar.

Add to that the fact that flavor is incredibly subjective; influenced by genetics, mood, experience, perception and even the glass or cup you’re using — and it becomes clear why two people can taste the same coffee and come away with completely different impressions. Even two brews from the same bag might not be consistent if your grind size or water is a bit off.

So when a roaster puts “peach and jasmine” on the label, they’re describing what they tasted under ideal conditions, often in a comparative context. It’s a reference point, not a flavor guarantee. Sometimes you’ll get close to those notes, especially with clean brewing, fresh beans, and some practice. Other times, you won’t and that’s completely normal.

The flavor notes are less about accuracy and more about giving you a general idea of what to expect. In that regards stuff like acidic, bright, floral, jammy are more useful descriptors than specific food examples. They’re also part of how roasters distinguish their offerings and help guide people in choosing what they might enjoy. But the reality is that coffee, like wine or whiskey, is incredibly complex, and your experience will always be your own.

When another post comes along asking about how to get certain flavor notes, I always see the same things copy and pasted every single time: Grind finer/coarser, it's your water, it's your agitation, it's your extraction.. etc, etc. Thing is, all of these  are correct, but they are by no means a guarantee you will get those notes if you dial in all of those variables. In the end, if you enjoy the coffee, who cares about what the bag says?

I’m a solo developer building Desk Monk — a minimal, science-backed breathing app designed specifically for desk jobbers and remote workers who struggle with stress, burnout, or focus crashes during the day.

The core idea is simple:
Instant calm in 5 minutes, right at your desk.
No fluff, no pressure — just deep breathing routines built on proven techniques.

Why I built it:

I hit a major burnout wall last year working remotely. Meditation felt too long. Coffee made it worse. So I built a tool I wish I had:
	•	5-min breathing resets
	•	“Breathe of the Day” tailored to mood
	•	Clean, distraction-free interface
	•	Designed to work mid-task, not after work

Want early access?

I’m opening a small round of early testers to:
	•	Try the core experience
	•	Share feedback before launch
	•	Help shape future features

He is 500 years old. She is 19. This is fine.

He hates her existence but also wants to claim her as his mate. He will protect her by following her everywhere without permission.

1klv6fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1klv6fd/does_the_evermagin_kast_appliance_slider_truly/,Does the Evermagin Kast Appliance Slider Truly Simplify Kitchen Organization Review?,"Testing the Evermagin KAST Appliance Slider became a bit of a daily habit for me the past few weeks. I wanted to see if this sliding tray lived up to the hype, especially as someone who juggles multiple kitchen gadgets on limited countertop space. The product, officially titled “Appliance Slider, Sliding Tray for Coffee Maker, Coffee Pot Slider for Countertop, Kitchen Appliance Rolling Tray with Rubber Wheels, Large - Long, Deep Gray (12.5” x 16”)” had a promising list of features, and at first glance, it seemed like one of those items you don’t realize you need until you have it. Spoiler: it proved pretty useful, but not without its quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing that struck me was how sturdy the Evermagin KAST Appliance Slider felt right out of the box. This isn’t just some flimsy piece of plastic masquerading as a slider tray. With dimensions of 12.5 x 16 x 1.4 inches and a weight of 3.4 pounds, it feels stable, and the ability to support up to 40 pounds is truly appreciated. I tested it with a variety of appliances—from my coffee maker to a massively heavy air fryer—and the tray endured like a champ. The deep gray finish is sleek, and it manages to look right at home no matter your kitchen’s aesthetic. A small but crucial note: the rubber wheels ensure there’s no screeching noise when sliding the tray, a lifesaver for those 6 a.m. coffee runs. However, the tray itself is slightly bulky, so if you have extremely cramped kitchen counters, it can feel like it takes up more than its fair share of space.

**Ease of Use**

Using this appliance slider was embarrassingly simple—set up your appliance on top, give it a gentle nudge, and watch it glide smooth as butter. My primary use case was under-cabinet storage, where sliding out my coffee machine usually involves a minor wrestling match. The glide mechanism works efficiently on various surfaces, including marble, wood, and even tile, which I verified by moving it across different countertops in my home. The open design and built-in handles are tiny details that elevate this product’s usability. Still, I don’t think it’s the best fit for extremely cluttered setups because, ironically, you need a certain amount of space for this space-saving marvel to shine.

**Key Benefits**

- Supports up to 40 pounds, making it suitable for heavier appliances like air fryers and toaster ovens.  
- Rubber wheels guarantee smooth and quiet sliding without leaving scratches.  
- Blends with most kitchen decors due to its minimalist, deep gray finish.

**Performance and Stability**

After a week or so of testing, one of my biggest takeaways was how much this slider improved my kitchen workflow—moving appliances out of tight spaces to clean the counter underneath felt like a breeze. Another cool feature? This tray doesn’t wobble or tilt when in use. This stability adds a lot of value for someone like me with clumsy tendencies. You’d think after a big spill with a coffee carafe, my lesson would’ve been learned, but alas, no, I am forever a disaster in the kitchen. Thankfully, spillage cleanup is quick with the slider’s smooth and easy-to-clean surface.

On the flip side, keep in mind that the smooth sliding mechanism can be a little too smooth. If you’re a person who slams appliances around (no judgment), you might find the tray edges a tad too slippery. The lack of raised grips around the perimeter might leave your appliance to shuffle slightly if pushed too forcefully.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Can feel bulky on smaller counters, defeating the purpose for certain users.  
- Appliances without rubber feet might shift slightly on the slider.  
- Lack of perimeter grips could be a pain for those rough with handling.  

**Product Rivals**

A product like this doesn’t sit in isolation—I also took the liberty to compare it with other countertop appliance sliders on the market, like the Nifty Coffee Pod Pull-out Tray and the Cafè Sliding Shelf. The Nifty model offers a more compact build, ideal for coffee drinkers with smaller setups, but it doesn’t hold a candle to the Evermagin slider’s weight capacity. On the other hand, the Cafè Sliding Shelf scores points for its premium aesthetic and slightly better grip for heavier appliances yet lacks the versatility in compatibility that the Evermagin provides. Between the three, the Evermagin KAST wins in durability and multifunctionality but takes a slight hit in terms of space efficiency compared to more compact competitors.

**Affordable Quality**

Looking at the price point compared to what it brings to the table, it’s honestly quite hard to complain. Similar products that boast high weight capacities or rubberized sliders tend to hover at similar price ranges or higher, so this one feels like a good middle ground. It’s definitely worth considering if you’ve got a heavy-duty kitchen setup or struggle with storing and organizing appliances effectively. Sure, it’s not the cheapest option, but the durability and performance significantly outpace the cost. Bottom line: you get what you pay for, and in this scenario, that’s a lot of convenience packed into a humble tray.

First of all, I hope this year has been kind to you so far. If not, maybe this post will be a tiny step in the direction of something good.

Look. I understand how frustrated you must feel. Guys only want one thing and it is disgusting. You just want to be appreciated for your witty jokes, intelligence and kind heart, but all those hungry courting boys see is, your head filled with hair and a full set of teeth.

You have been single for a little while now, maybe you have broken up from your first relationship that lasted for 3 years. You have tried Tinder and going to parties but you feel overwhelmed by the constant bombardment of inappropriate pics and whatnot and then there was this incident of one of your Tinder matches figuring out where you live and showing up at your front door, and then your university “friends” showing their true colours one by one you just went – fu\*k it. That’s it, I am trying something different. And then you asked your friend who found her foreign boyfriend in Reddit and you think to yourself, that sounds insane but hey why not try it? It could be romantic. Or then the other person can be a clinically insane kidnapper. But you never know.

And here you are. And let me tell you, I will woo you like a lady you should be woo-od (uh?).

I live in Italy but open to women all over this universe

At this point of my life I feel ready and very passionate about sharing my life with the right person as I was working on being the best version of myself before putting myself out there, so bear with my long yet interactive post :)

# What am I looking for?

\- You must be human, I will not date orcs or aliens, I'm sorry if that makes me racist, I can't help what I like xD (I might be ok if you're an elf but only if you have purple hair)

\- You make at least 20 € a year (19€ is not 20€)

\- Ok on a serious note: I'm looking for a kindred soul who also feels that life has greater meaning when there is another person’s needs to focus on rather than just your own; that an individual can be more successful in life with a supportive partner by their side. Someone with whom I can bond emotionally and physically with depths of my soul.

\- You value honesty, integrity, and mutual respect above all else. And though I also value mutual physical attraction, if you're a genuinely good person who's authentic, kind, honest and has integrity then that automatically makes you 1000x more attractive.

\- Having open communication is important to you in a relationship. If you're the kind of person who isn't willing to open up, who isn't ready to talk about how you're feeling, what you're thinking, what you want/need from me or you're incapable of having any kind of difficult conversations, then that's absolutely a deal breaker for me.

\- My love language is physical touch, words of affirmation (giving & receiving), small acts of kindness and thoughtfulness, I love holding hands & cuddles. On a rainy day I wanna be cozy with you a cup of coffee & therapeutic sound of rain and thunder in background, lots of hugs and kisses (what's your love language like?

Now to the generic stuff!

\*I'll start off with basics about myself:

\* Appearance wise: 6ft tall (183cm), natural black hair, dark brown eyes and fairly fair skin, see what I did there? 

\* Personality wise: Friends have described me as a well-rounded, open-minded and easy going person. I like to learn different things and try new experiences every once in awhile, and I'd like to think that I'm somewhat cultured and know a teensy bit about many things. Personal growth (physical, mental, and spiritual) is huge priority and key driver in my life. (what do you value in your life?)

\* I like to make jokes a lot as well and being sarcastic but sometimes they misfire so I've learned not to make many jokes initially :D . If we click be prepared for puns, cheesy/flirty pickup lines, puns and dark humor

\* Hobbies & Interests: My hobbies change from time to time, but they include reading poetry and literature, I like novels and other books and I also like a healthy dose of Philosophy with a pinch of psychology. I'm passionate about different languages and want to learn German and Spanish in future. (what are some of your hobbies?)

\* In my spare time, I like to listen to music and play video games, I am really good at Badminton and Volleyball. Like most of people here, I enjoy video games too, I often play on PC (what kind of games do you like?). When it comes to my taste in music, it's all over the place, it depends on what kind of mood I'm in but I like melancholic music and sometimes it spirals me into loop of sadness. But I also like pop, jazz, country and instrumental music. (what about you? tell me your favorite song :)

# A Few Honest Truths:

I live with anxiety and depression. I’ve come a long way in healing and managing it, but like most things, it occasionally resurfaces. I’m not looking to dump my struggles on you but I want to be real about who I am. If we’re in this together, I want us to talk openly and kindly about everything, including the hard stuff.

I’m affectionate, supportive, loyal (almost to a fault), and deeply emotionally available. If you open up to me; if you’re vulnerable, honest, and real. I’ll meet you there with love and respect. That said, vulnerability doesn’t mean expecting someone else to carry your unhealed baggage for you. I believe in shared effort, not emotional outsourcing.

When I’m with someone, I’m all in. You’ll never feel like you’re competing with anyone else for my attention. I value freedom, trust, and emotional maturity. I don’t do jealousy-fueled drama, and I won’t keep you on a leash, I trust the right person wouldn’t want to walk away.

If any of this resonates with you, I’d love to hear from you. Tell me about yourself, your age, where you’re from, what you’re looking for, and whatever else you’d like to share. Put a little heart into it, I promise to do the same.

I've been signed off sick, and the Arbo doctor acknowledged I need rest. However, he also suggested I might try having a coffee with my team in 2 - 3 weeks and maybe resume work 2 hours per week soon after. That really surprised me.  
  
Even thinking about work brings a wave of tension and exhaustion. I'm not doing normal daily things yet - I'm just trying to function. I worry that if I try to reintegrate now, I'll crash even harder. I feel like the Arbo doctor might be underestimating my condition, even if he means well.  
  
Has anyone else been in a similar situation with Arbo pressure? How did you handle this? What can I do at the next meeting to make it clear I need more time and am not ready yet - without sounding like I'm refusing help?

This is a reflection and summary of time spent during an unforgettable whirlwind weeklong trip. For context, we are two half-Korean, 30-something, female, American surgical residents. My friend’s parents joined. Writer (me) is proudly queer and culturally somewhat Korean (e.g. knows how to cook mid-level Korean food), and—less proudly—possesses toddler level competency in Korean. I had been to Korea once with family when I was 17. My friend had never been, and her mother hadn’t been back in 45 years. The goal of our trip was food, fun, and spoiling ourselves. Total step count: 135,252 over 7 days.

 

**Day 1- Crash course**

Late afternoon landing at Incheon Airport, easy lesson in navigating subway system with a ride to the station closest to our hotel in Myeongdong. Perhaps we prolonged our suffering by choosing subway over cab because we were hauling large suitcases. Exiting Myeongdong station with the bustle of endless lights and action was a fever dream after the 12-hour flight. We chugged coffee, then a bottle of muscat flavored soju, and joined parents for a guided food tour of Gwangjang market. Highlights were kalguksu, kimchi and tofu mandu, and a cinnamon sugar donut with a texture as light as air. The market was friendly, intuitively laid out, and would have been easily navigable without a guide as well. We crashed back at our hotel, marveling on the subway ride home how quiet and clean the train was.



**Day 2- Wandering day**

Woke up jetlagged, just in time to catch the 6am sunrise dappling through the peaceful waters of the Cheonggyecheon (a sunken freshwater stream with miles of walking path and an impressive array of wildlife that cuts right through Seoul). I walked a few miles each way, exiting at Dongdaemun to explore the old city wall park and pick out favorite banchan at the just-opening food market. Picked up an iced coffee and threw a tiny pre-breakfast picnic along the Cheonggyecheon. My friend ran this route in the opposite direction, which became her near-daily run. Next-level breakfast buffet with Korean and western options at our hotel (Solaria hotel in Myeongdong). Two hour intense lymphatic massage and facials per our hotel’s rec and booking help, followed by spicy grilled squid and beer from a street stall in Dongdaemun and several more miles of walking. Traditional Korean hanjeongsik dinner with my friend’s family member, followed by a long nighttime walk through the bars and pochas just north of Myeongdong (near Jongno 3-ga). Quickly fading after the incredible meal (highlight was a king oyster mushroom and sesame jeon), we vowed go come back and visit the pochas another night.



**Day 3- Where the young people are**

My friend spent the daytime learning about Korean history on a family walking tour of palaces and historical sites. Given that I’d done a similar tour when I was 17 visiting Korea with my family, I set out to explore Hongdae and adjacent Yeonnam. I started with a climbing session in Yeonnam. The routesetters were creative with a variety of slabs and overhang problems that did not rely on the climber being 6ft tall, which is my biggest qualm with American gyms. I was amazed by the cleanliness of the gym –there was even a footwash station! This was hands down the best smelling climbing gym I have been to. I walked a couple steps to Gyeongui line forest park and enjoyed an egg sandwich in this gorgeous ‘highline-esque’ park along an old rail track. I had to bend down and physically touch some of the flowers to convince myself they were real. The colors and shapes were so lurid they initially appeared to be cut from construction paper. I spent a couple hours customizing shorts at the Nike store, admiring sneaker designs, and spending my paycheck on sportswear. The designs and fits were refreshingly different from what I see in the US. I joined my friend back at the hotel for a long nap before we headed out again at 9pm. We started our night at a small bar in Itaewon called Cul Sec. Every signature cocktail we tried was outstanding and the toasted yuzu cocktail was my favorite drink of the trip. Then, we headed to the main Itaewon party streets and picked out a pub where we enjoyed butter grilled squid and spicy sujebe with somaek. The butter grilled squid was one of my favorite bites of the trip. Next stop: queer karaoke night, where a woman crushed Amy Winehouse tunes. The vibe was energetic, friendly, and not too packed as it was a Thursday. Our final stop was the Jongno 3-ga pocha street, where we downed haemul pajeon, tteokbokki, and more somaek before the pocha closed at 4am. Altogether an unforgettable boozy night that was largely unplanned and guided by the whim of our wandering appetites.

 

**Day 4- Spa recovery**

After relishing 2 hrs of sleep, we grabbed the parents for an adrenaline-fueled 7am dash to Seoul station where we set out to Busan. I nursed my hangover with an iced Americano while my friend managed to down some more spicy squid from the train station. I stared out the window of the KTX train, successfully not vomiting (thank goodness that train ride is smooth); following a final miserable taxi ride through pouring rain from Busan station we made it to our destination: Spa Land. What followed was an immersive sensory experience and perfect hangover recovery. I have enjoyed a Korean spa in the US, and one in Korea, but had never seen anything near this scale. In bare feet, towels, and spa clothes, we enjoyed the massive immaculate 3-story facility over 8 hours. We lay in silence on a heated floor as rain pummeled the glass ceiling, popped between steam rooms, napped in hammocks, successfully tested our hangover bellies with ice cream and self-serve ramen, and enjoyed intense hour-long facials. I noticed a woman in front of me in the ramen line wiping off a few crumbs that had accumulated on the self-serve counter (even though she hadn’t spilled anything) and realized that her behavior would be unfathomable in the US. The level of respect for public spaces was striking throughout our trip. After the spa, we sleepily explored the megalophobia-inducing Busan Shinsegae mall (the largest department store in the world) and napped. We woke at 10pm and grabbed perhaps the most delicious dinner of the trip: a generous eomuk hotpot and side plate of spicy fried chicken. I had never seen this variety of eomuk before, which I learned is a regional specialty of Busan. As fishcake steam filled my nostrils and opened my pores, I sighed happily, feeling that the hangover recovery process had finally reached completion.



**Day 5 – Seafood and self-healing**

We joined the parents for a lovely traditional Korean breakfast in Busan. The beef and leek fritters and clam miyyeokguk were my favorite breakfast of the trip. We showed off the impressive Shinsegae mall to the parents (the food court was even more impressive in the morning with all the bakeries rolling out fresh food) before making our way to Jagalchi fish market. We picked live snow crab, fish, clams, and octopus before making our way upstairs to enjoy the fresh seafood. This was my favorite lunch of the trip. I ate the crab quickly with savage joy as we swore not to miss our KTX train back to Seoul. Crispy grilled flounder, which I usually think of as a boring fish, reached new heights here. While on the train back to Busan I arranged to climb with newfound queer Korean friends. I rushed to shower and become somewhat presentable to my fellow lesbians before heading back to the gym in Yeonnam. The Saturday evening gym was more crowded but somehow still not stinky. I joined two women at the gym—both creatives engrained in the local queer scene. I was fascinated. As the child of a Korean immigrant who reacted very poorly to my coming out, I assumed that modern Korean society would thoroughly stamp out queer joy. Yet here we were, connecting between climbs about recent dating mishaps and favorite L word characters. My new friends invited me out for post-climbing drinks and dinner at their favorite lesbian spots, prefacing kindly, ‘you will see a lot of women’. Sure, I thought to myself...good luck beating the US. What I saw surprised and delighted me beyond my wildest expectations. My American gay hubris was decimated. They showed me nightlife spaces for queer women that ranged from large restaurant style venues with waitlists so long we couldn’t get in for hours; intimate pubs with curated menus of drinking food; thumping hip hop clubs. One raging club had bartenders dressed as construction workers with tiny crates of deadly shots that were complimentary if you bought food at the women-owned pub next door. I set my backpack on the floor and happily immersed myself in the sea of dancing women. We left hours later once the crowd claustrophobia surpassed anything I had experienced even in major US cities during Pride month. My experience in American clubs led me to expect my backpack trampled on the floor somewhere but I was touched to find that someone had placed it on a table for me to find. Our magical night reconciled the queer and Korean parts of myself, relating them to one another rather than casting them in opposition. My new friend tucked me into a cab and I slept soundly that night, dreaming happy tears for my gays on the other side of the world.



**Day 6- A fancy day**

My friend was already on her morning Cheonggyecheon run by the time I woke up at 8AM, miraculously not hungover. I met her at a Paris Baguette in Insadong, where we enjoyed pastries and black coffee. Cream bread was simple and a standout. We moseyed through the arts district, admiring traditional crafts, and visited an artisan coffee shop. The black coffee was rich and almost thick in texture—too much for my weak taste buds. I preferred my iced Americano from Paris Baguette, which I fully realize probably makes me basic. I took my friend to Hongdae so she could customize a bunch of sweatshirts. We showered and refreshed ourselves with hot tea and fresh grapefruit juice (why isn’t it as tasty in the US??) before heading with the parents to a Zest, a World’s Top 50 Bar in Gangnam focused on sustainable ingredients. The sunny cocktail bar was fully seated at 3pm. The bartenders explained each ingredient when we chose our drinks. I enjoyed a lovely, strong drink made with millet soju, corn silk, and bell pepper, with a grainy and familiar tasting rub on the rim meant to evoke the harvesting process. We made our way to Seoul forest station where we explored the Seoul botanic park wetland preserve, before walking around the streets of Seongsu-dong and finding a barbeque spot for dinner. This neighborhood had a distinct artistic avant garde vibe. We chased our barbeque dinner with injeolmi bingsu back in Myeungdong, followed by whiskey highball cocktails. My favorite classic cocktail is an old fashioned, so I wasn’t sure if I would enjoy this lighter take on whiskey, but I was pleasantly surprised.



**Day 7- Too happy to be sad**

I expected to be sad on our last day, but a morning walk along the Cheonggyecheon lifted my spirits. I watched an egret catch a fish. I was awed that I could see this sort of wildlife in the middle of the city. I picked up several boxes of black sesame injeolmi at Young Man Dduck as souvenirs to enjoy over breakfast for the next week (and to send to my mom). My friend and I visited the Olive Young store in Myeungdong. I was expecting a generic chain like Sephora, but the décor, layout, and emphasis on skin care (over makeup) were all appealing. I picked out my favorite sunscreens and my wallet wept. We made our final stop at Olive Chicken before heading to the airport. We ordered a half original/half super spicy plate of fried chicken with somaek. I didn’t let a single bite go to waste. Hot chicken burning my lips, somaek buzzing my brain, I felt more happy than sad.



*Final impressions –*

Korea was perfect for me as someone who doesn’t like to overplan. Wandering and following a basic set of goals (“Today I want to go to the spa/see art/go climbing/get to the market at sunrise/drink”) was enough planning for me and my friend, and the rest of the magic followed. The only reservation we made ahead of our trip was the Zest in Gangnam. The best food was found through wandering, looking up local spots on Kakao Maps, and our planned trip to the fish market. Walking is also delightful because the green spaces in Seoul are thriving.

It was very touching to see my friend’s mom (Korean American) experience Korea for the first time in 45 years. She was shocked and impressed at how far Korea had come. She soaked up Korean historical tours like a sponge, and shared all her new knowledge with us over breakfast. I felt very lucky to get to go with my friend’s mom and get her perspective during our trip.

At the most we might get some flavor out of plants and if we're really lucky we could find a salt deposit because I know if I take down a whole spice rack during a raid or search people are going to tell me ""Dude, only the essentials!"" and when I say ""THESE ARE ESSENTIAL!"" they're going to knock it out of my hands and I'd probably kill them, rightfully.

1kluzur,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kluzur/does_the_bonavita_8_cup_coffee_maker_truly/,Does the Bonavita 8 Cup Coffee Maker Truly Deliver? In-Depth Review,"Testing the **Bonavita BV1900TS 8-Cup Coffee Maker** for several weeks has been a journey of caffeinated bliss mixed with a few unexpected quirks. Brewing coffee is a sacred part of my day, so getting my hands on this thermal carafe-equipped, SCA-certified machine was an exciting experiment. Whether you're a pour-over enthusiast or just someone who values a good cup of coffee made with minimal fuss, this coffee maker offers some interesting features. But, as with any product, not everything is perfect.

**Sleek Design and Compact Footprint**  
The first impression of this coffee maker was overwhelmingly positive. Its stainless steel and black finish give it a modern, professional appearance that fits beautifully in any kitchen. I love how its compact size, measuring just 12.4 x 6.8 x 12.2 inches, doesn’t dominate the counter space, even in smaller kitchens. The thermal carafe design exudes durability, and the brushed stainless steel exterior is visually appealing. One minor downside though? The cord could have been slightly longer—plug placement in my kitchen made setup a bit tricky.

**Brewing Performance: Precision & Power**  
As a coffee devotee, I’m particularly impressed by the 1500-watt heater that maintains an optimal brewing temperature of 195°F to 205°F. I tested this feature over multiple brews, and the consistent heat ensures your coffee extracts flavor evenly each time. The optional pre-infusion mode is another game changer. Activating this feature allows the coffee grounds to bloom by degassing freshly roasted coffee—a detail coffee snobs will truly appreciate. However, the one-touch brew operation feels a bit limiting for those who might want more flexibility in programming brew times.

**Good Points**  
- One-touch simplicity makes brewing easy, even when you’re half-asleep.  
- Pre-infusion mode ensures better-tasting coffee if you use freshly ground beans.  
- Thermal carafe keeps coffee warm for hours without a warming plate that might alter the flavor.  
- BPA-free plastic components are safer for long-term use.  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Any coffee maker is only as good as its cleanup process, particularly for daily users like myself. With the **Bonavita BV1900TS**, cleaning is blissfully straightforward. Components like the showerhead, filter basket, and carafe lid are all dishwasher-safe—what a relief for those mornings when getting out the door on time doesn’t allow manual scrubbing. Yet one gripe stood out: getting residual oils off the stainless steel part of the thermal carafe tends to require an extra bit of elbow grease.

[Grab Bonavita BV1900TS at the best price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00o9fo1hk/)

**Drawbacks**  
- The lack of programmability means you can’t preset brewing times.  
- The thermal carafe’s pour spout dribbled slightly unless I poured slowly, which was mildly annoying.  
- Warming coffee on a traditional heating plate isn’t an option—meaning it’s thermal carafe or nothing.  

**Target Audience: Busy Coffee Drinkers and Home Baristas**  
This product strikes a fine balance, appealing to both entry-level users and amateur coffee enthusiasts. For someone like me, who enjoys a solid cup of joe without fuss on weekdays but ventures into manual brewing on weekends, it works well. However, those who prefer hands-free brewing with programmable features might need to look elsewhere. It’s essentially built for someone who values quality, yet doesn’t want the complexity of multi-stage brewing machines.

**Competitive Options in the Market**  
Compared to popular rivals like the Technivorm Moccamaster and Breville Bambino series, the Bonavita excels in affordability and SCA-certification for brewing standards. The Moccamaster feels more premium and offers a wider range of customization, but it also costs significantly more. On the flip side, the Breville models are geared more toward espresso lovers rather than drip coffee aficionados. What stands out with the Bonavita is the thermal carafe’s ability to keep coffee warm without compromise. However, the lack of programmability still sets it back when placed against models like the Moccamaster, which offer more user control.

**Cost Efficiency**  
When you weigh the performance and features against the price range of similar machines, this product ranks highly in terms of **value for money**. Crafted diligently with an SCA-certified brewing process, it ensures you’re not losing out on quality despite having a budget-friendly price tag. While it might not be the most advanced coffee maker, its minimalist approach delivers exactly what coffee connoisseurs crave—great coffee, fast. If you can live without advanced customization, it’s a solid investment.

ich besitze seit gut einem Monat die Krups Evidence Eco (wie s.o.) und mir hat der Kaffee der aus dieser Maschine kam (ich bevorzuge Cappuccino und andere Milchgetränke) sehr gut geschmeckt - die Bohnen habe ich seither nicht ausgetauscht bzw. aufgebraucht, jedoch schmeckt mir seit gut einer Woche der Kaffee auf einmal überhaupt nicht mehr:
Er ist bitter, die Maschine an sich und auch der Kaffee riecht unangenehm „chemisch“. 

Mir ist jedoch keine Veränderung an der Maschine aufgefallen und ich spüle und reinige das System nach jeder Verwendung.

Kann die Lösung eine Reinigung mit dazu beigefügter Reinigungstablette sein, auch wenn die Maschine es noch nicht selbst empfiehlt und auf der Packung steht, dass dies wohl nur sehr selten (ca. 3x Pro Jahr) zu machen ist?

1klupxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/eggfreezing/comments/1klupxb/my_30f_detailed_egg_freezing_experience_in_chicago/,My (30F) Detailed Egg Freezing Experience in Chicago,"Hi all! This subreddit helped me so much — from learning the basics to feeling less alone during the process — that I wanted to share my experience in hopes of giving back. If you’re just starting out or feeling nervous, I hope this helps you feel more informed and less overwhelmed.

**About Me**

* **Age**: 30
* **Height/Weight**: 5’6”, 135–145 lbs
* **Lifestyle**: Barre/yoga 2–3x/week, walk 7k–10k steps/day
* **Diet**: Moderately healthy, \~6–8 alcoholic drinks/month, 8–12 oz coffee/day
* **Supplements**: B12, CoQ10, fish oil, D3, prenatal (65–70% consistency over 6 months)
* **Health**: No meds, allergies, or underlying conditions

**Clinic & Insurance & Pharmacy** 

* **Clinic**: OVA. Chose them based on a coworker’s recommendation. Overall experience: **7.5–8/10**. I’ll likely use them for my second round, but I may also explore UChicago. If you are considering OVA and want more details, feel free to DM me. 
* **Insurance**: Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois PPO I paid just under **$3,000** for this round. My plan covers up to **4 cycles/year**. Next round should only cost me the **$1,200 cryopreservation fee**.
* **Pharmacy**: Freedom Pharmacy (insurance-mandated) Super easy to work with. Meds delivered to my home. I had some leftover, which can be used within a year.

**Pre-Cycle Mid-March Baseline Results:** 

* **E2**: 47
* **FSH**: 7.0
* **LH**: 2.3
* **AMH**: 3.31
* **AFC**: 21

To start in April, I had to quickly complete a full STD panel, pap, bloodwork, etc. I was able to schedule it all quickly and was cleared in time!

**Final Baseline Appoint before injections – 4/23**

Only **12 follicles** showed on the ultrasound (down from 21 in March). I knew that the numbers could deviate a little each cycle but I wasn’t expecting such a big drop off. I was really disappointed and went back and forth about delaying the cycle. Ultimately, I moved forward because:

* I had already ordered meds and cleared my schedule
* Insurance was covering most of it
* I had mentally prepared for more than one round
* My nurse reassured me that numbers often rise once stims start — and that I could cancel after Day 4 if I wanted/needed.

**Stimulation Protocol**

* **Meds**: 150 IU Menopur + 150 IU Follistim (night), Ganirelix started on Day 6 (morning)
* **Lifestyle**: I allowed myself to eat whatever I wanted with an extra emphasis on protein. **Doctor recommended 150g of protein a day** to prevent OHSS which I tried my best but I probably only had 70-100g a day. I drank my usual 8-12 oz of coffee per day but did not have any alcohol. I weighed myself here or there but I didn’t want to get too caught up with the number and just went with how my clothes fit and how I was feeling. I took small walks throughout (within 2 miles) and walked a lot slower than my normal pace- I could feel pressure when I walked quicker.

  
**Day 1 - 4/24**:  
No noticeable symptoms. I went to my last barre class before freezing my membership for a month.

**Day 2 - 4/25**:  
Slight fatigue, but nothing major. It was rainy, so that may have contributed.

**Day 3 - 4/26**:  
My weight was 140.8 lbs. I had a small bruise at the injection site but no other major symptoms.

**Day 4 - 4/27**:  
My weight was 139.3 lbs. Minor cramping started late at night, felt like the nausea when you’re really hungry.

**Day 5 - 4/28**:  
Exciting check-in with my doctor — the ultrasound showed **19 follicles**! 4 measurable (8–12 mm), 1 “big guy” at 15 mm (likely to be lost). Nurse said ideal size is 16–22 mm. I was relieved that my numbers had improved.

**Day 6 - 4/29**:  
Started **Ganirelix** and experienced mild cramping. I noticed some clear discharge and felt a little more tired.

**Day 7 - 4/30**:  
Similar symptoms as Day 6. Doctors Appointment. 

**Ultrasound Results**

**LSFC** (Left Side Follicle Count): **11** 

5 out of 11 were measurable between 13.7mm - 7.2 mm 

**RSFC** (Right Side Follicle Count): **6** 

6 out of 6 measurable 

5 out of 6 between 14.5mm - 6.4 mm 

Big guy: 17.1mm  

**Day 8 - 5/1**:  
Bloating, sore breasts, and a bit of nausea. The doctor reduced my Menopur and Follistim to 75 IU each.

**Day 9 - 5/2**:  
I was feeling more pressure and bloating, but the nausea had passed.

**Ultrasound Results**

LSFC: **12**

1 out of 12: 18.2 mm

9 out of 12: between 13.1 mm- 7.3 mm 

2 out of 12: Not Measurable  

RSFC: **7** 

3 out of 7 between 20.9mm-17.8 mm

3 out of 7 between 14.9-11.6 mm 

Big guy: **22.3 mm** 

**Day 10 - 5/3**:  
I noticed more visible bloating and could no longer suck in my stomach. Still dealing with mild soreness and pressure.

**Day 11 - 5/4**:  
Discomfort from bloating continued. It was hard to sit for long periods, and I felt better standing or lying down.

**Day 12 - 5/5**:  
The ultrasound showed growth across most follicles.

**Ultrasound Results**

LSFC: **11**

1 out of 11: 23.4 mm 

1 out of 11: 19mm 

9 out of 11: between 16.6 mm- 9.7 mm 

RSFC: **7** 

1 out of 7: 27.2 

4 out of 7 between 19.8mm-15.2 mm

1 out of 7: 10.1 mm 

Big guy: **31.9 mm (!)** 

However, my estrogen was too high to continue the shots, so I did a final Menopur shot and did the **trigger shot** at 12:30am.

**Day 13 - 5/6**:  
I had the final check to confirm the trigger shot was working. My boobs were very sore/tender/heavy, there was also this weird lightening strike feeling through them. Same level of bloating as Day 12. No food or water 8 hours before the retrieval.

**Day 14 - 5/7**:  
**ER day!** I was nervous, but the procedure itself was quick and relatively painless. I was under for only about 15 mins and it didn’t take me longer than 30 minutes to be fully awake post ER. They retrieved **9 eggs**, with **8 viable for freezing**. I was definitely deflated because I was hoping for at least 12 given my numbers from the last visit. Although I’d hoped for a higher number, I’d mentally prepared for multiple rounds, so I wasn’t too disappointed. They put me on **7 days of Ganirelix post op** to prevent OHSS. Period is suppose to come \~10 days from trigger shot. 

**Post-Retrieval Recovery**

**5/8: Day 1 Post Op:** I definitely went pretty ham with the liquid IVs, salty foods, and protein which was recommended by the doctor which honestly was a ton of fun. I didn’t feel overly tired but still took it easy and just spent the whole day on the couch. I was sore and I could feel pressure whenever I peed. By night time, my stomach felt taut and sore. Very mild spotting, had BM which I was thankful for.

**5/9: Day 2 Post Op:** Very similar to Day 1- except no BM. Probably the most uncomfortable day to date. Stomach was very taut, had to keep lying down to get relief. Took a stool softener.

**5/10: Day 3 Post Op:** Feeling better today- still no BM. Took another stool softener. Still bloated but didn’t have the same taut or sore/pressure feeling nearly as much. 

**5/11: Day 4 Post Op:** Feeling even better than yesterday. Bloated but pretty much back to normal. Stopped taking Liquid IV, just drank regular water and had my first beer since starting this. 

**5/12: Day 5 Post Op:** Walked 3 miles, felt great! Still bloated but honestly feel 95% back to normal. 

**5/13: Day 6 Post Op:** I got my period today! Nurse told me I don’t need to take the last Ganirelix shot. Had BM today which was so NICE. Still bloated but could suck in my stomach for the first time since 5/2. All restrictions lifted- so I am excited to get back to my regular routine : ) 

# What I’ll Do Differently for Round 2:

* **Let the Menopur sit** for 5–10 minutes before injecting to reduce the burning sensation.
* **Always Ice** before injections — it made a world of difference in minimizing pain.
* **Request detailed reports** on my estrogen levels/bloodwork results in addition to follicle growth at each check-in.
* **Research** strategies to encourage even follicle growth. Some follicles grew much larger than others, and I wonder if a big follicle ""hogged"" some of the resources that could have helped the others.

The biggest takeaway for me is this: **Manage your expectations.** So much of this is out of your control, and it’s not worth beating yourself up. High numbers don't necessarily mean a high yield and vice versa. 

I feel lucky the process was relatively easy for me, and I plan to do my second round in November. My doctor said **15 eggs = 1 live birth** (obviously just a guideline), so I’m hoping to hit at least 8 again next time. If anyone has any tips or tricks I would love to hear them! Feel free to DM me with questions, or if you are in Chicago and considering using OVA. I hope this post helps and makes the process feel a little less intimidating.

1klup2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeReviewedIt/comments/1klup2y/luke_tried_the_eggs_factory_guide_can_you_really/,Luke Tried The Eggs Factory Guide 🐔 Can You Really Build a Backyard Chicken Coop for Under $100?,"# 🥚 Introduction

Eggs aren't what they used to be. Prices are climbing, cartons feel lighter, and some of those pale supermarket yolks look like they gave up before they even began.

If you eat eggs regularly — or in my case, live with someone who does — you’ve probably stared into a fridge and thought, “There's got to be a better way.”

That’s where my friend Luke came in, fork in hand, muttering about **raising egg-laying chickens on a budget**. What started as a breakfast rant turned into plywood, hens, and a coop he built from scratch.

This review shares his experience using [The Eggs Factory](https://theworldhealth.org/eggs-factory-official), a digital guide claiming to help users build a functional chicken coop for under $100. Spoiler: It’s more doable than you'd think.

# 📦 Product Overview

* **Product Name: The Eggs Factory**
* **Category: DIY & Home Projects → Backyard Chicken Coops**
* **Overall Verdict: 4.5/5**

# 📥 First Impressions & What’s Included

Once Luke hit purchase, the files were delivered instantly. No waiting, no shipping issues, just a well-organized folder and a **simple guide to backyard chicken coops**.

Inside the package was a detailed PDF, 3D diagrams, a parts list, and what Luke described as “cozy weekend vibes in document form.” It felt like a neighbor showing you how it's done.

Two bonuses sweetened the deal: a **Chicken Health Checklist** and an **organic chicken feed recipe book**. Both are helpful, especially if you’re new to **caring for backyard chickens day to day**.

The PDF is exactly what you’d want in an **affordable DIY chicken coop plan for beginners**. Nothing fancy, just direct, usable instructions that don’t assume you’re a woodshop teacher.

# 🧱 What Makes It Different

Plenty of “free” guides float around online, but most assume you either own a circular saw empire or can turn a pallet into a palace. Luke needed something simple and clear.

The Eggs Factory delivers a **basic chicken coop plan that produces daily eggs** without drama. The instructions are split into digestible steps, with diagrams that won’t make you squint.

The best part? He spent $93.74. Yes, we’re talking **how to build a chicken coop for** [less than $100](https://theworldhealth.org/eggs-factory-official) with parts from the local hardware store — no scavenger hunts required.

This isn’t Pinterest fluff. It’s a **low-cost chicken coop design** that a regular person can build with a Saturday and maybe one trip to the store (two if you forget the hinges).

# 🔨 How It Actually Works

The guide is laid out clearly with a start-to-finish flow. Each section walks you through construction in plain language. Even if you’ve never built anything, you’ll get it.

Luke followed the **step-by-step guide to building his chicken coop** closely. He liked that it didn’t just dump measurements and disappear — it explained the *why*, not just the *what*.

By Sunday evening, the coop was standing tall. It was the perfect **beginner-friendly chicken coop setup for fresh eggs** — no frills, no fluff, just a clean build that worked.

The plan also makes it easy to adjust if needed. Want to scale up later? The structure is flexible, and you’ll already have the skills from **building your sub $100 DIY coop**.

# 🧑‍🌾 Personal Experience (via my egg-addicted friend)

Luke’s coop journey kicked off when he cracked a grocery store egg and said, “This smells like... absolutely nothing.” One week later, he had lumber in the trunk and [plans in hand](https://theworldhealth.org/eggs-factory-official).

With zero woodworking background, he managed to pull off one of the most **simple chicken coop ideas for first-time builders** I’ve ever seen. I mean, I watched from a safe vegan distance, but still.

He appreciated the clarity. The diagrams weren’t abstract or confusing, and the measurements were spot-on. That’s rare in DIY plans, especially those sold for cheap.

His only gripe? The hinge diagram. It could’ve used a little more detail. But in fairness, he figured it out with a YouTube detour and some caffeine.

Now his coop holds three happy hens, and he’s collecting warm eggs each morning — the result of **starting a backyard egg farm the easy way**. I resisted going off on a vegan rant ... he's heard it all before!

# 🧍‍♂️ Who This Is (and Isn’t) For

This guide is ideal if you have limited outdoor space and basic tools. The **compact chicken coop design** fits snugly in small yards or side gardens.

It’s perfect if you're curious about **keeping egg-laying chickens in your backyard** but don’t want to throw thousands at a prefab structure that weighs more than your car.

Luke lives in the suburbs, has a modest plot, and didn’t want anything elaborate. For him, it was one of those **ideas for budget-conscious backyard chicken setups** that actually stuck.

This isn’t for you if you have no outdoor space, or if you’d rather pay someone to do the work. It’s DIY — just not the kind that ends in regret or plaster dust.

# 🌿 Bonus Tips for First-Time Chicken Owners

Before you buy, think about **choosing the best hens for egg production**. Buff Orpingtons, Rhode Island Reds, and ISA Browns are all known for being productive and chill.

If sustainability matters to you (as it does to Luke now that he’s converted), you’ll love that the coop promotes **sustainable tips for raising your own chickens** without constant waste.

Also, learning [how to get started](https://theworldhealth.org/eggs-factory-official) **with backyard chickens** doesn’t require a degree in farming. All you need is a coop, a couple of hens, and a curious attitude. You’ll learn fast.

# ⭐ Star Ratings Breakdown

* ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Ease of Use** Instructions are broken down clearly and don’t assume any prior DIY experience.
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ **Clarity of Instructions** Mostly flawless, but the hinge installation could use a visual boost.
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Affordability** True to the name, Luke built his for less than $100 — mission accomplished.
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ **Bonus Materials** Helpful, especially the health checklist. Not essential, but appreciated.
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ **End Result Quality** The coop is practical, compact, and sturdy. No design awards, but no regrets either.

**Overall Rating: 4.5/5**

# ✅ Pros

🟢 **Affordable coop designs for new chicken owners**  
🟢 Clear layout and **step-by-step chicken coop guide**  
🟢 Great for **small-space chicken coop designs** in tight yards  
🟢 Works for those **raising chickens at home for fresh eggs**

# ❌ Cons

🔴 One diagram could be clearer (hello, hinges)  
🔴 Not ideal for renters or people without outdoor space  
🔴 Requires light tool use — not a problem for most, but worth noting

# 💵 Pricing Options

You’ll pay $39 for the full digital package, including the main guide and two bonuses. No subscriptions, no tricks, just a clean transaction and fast access.

If you want a **how-to guide for building a chicken coop cheaply at home**, this is one of the few options that stays honest about the price tag.

# 🛒 Where To Buy The Eggs Factory

Buy it only [through the official site](https://theworldhealth.org/eggs-factory-official). That’s the safest way to get the latest version and any updates. Plus, any satisfaction guarantees are only valid there.

We’ve seen a few sketchy duplicates floating around. If you're wondering **whether The Eggs Factory is actually legit**, stick with the source to avoid drama.

And yes, for those wondering if **The Eggs Factory is a scam or worth the money ...** Based on Luke’s experience, it's the latter.

# 🧾 Conclusion

The results of Luke's **real review of The Eggs Factory chicken coop guide** is this: straightforward, effective, and surprisingly rewarding.

He didn’t just build a coop. He found a rhythm — mornings with the hens, evenings cracking eggs with pride, and that quiet satisfaction of knowing he built it himself.

What does **the Eggs Factory guide actually include**? It includes confidence. Instructions. A sense of progress. And eggs. Lots of eggs.

Yup, the same guys who swore off ties in NYC finance only to launch a tie company on Martha’s Vineyard — and sell out 800 pink hot dog ties in a single day. The brothers left the company a few years ago, but they’re boomeranging back like Iger at Disney or Wolfe Herd at Bumble. The reason it matters? VV isn’t just a pastel punchline — it’s one of the best-run businesses in fashion. Zero private equity. 100% founder-owned. Over $500M in annual revenue. That’s double Allbirds, on par with Stitch Fix, and still growing steadily: five new stores a year, now at 126 locations.



But here’s the twist: Vineyard Vines is 27 years old — midlife in fashion years — and hasn’t even started the *Lifestyle Lifecycle*. Most fashion brands peak or pivot by now. VV? It’s quietly thriving thanks to one demographic: men. Nearly 70% of VV’s customers are male — and guys shop differently. They buy once, then stay loyal for *decades*. Your boyfriend finds VV khakis? He’s locked in through 2045. Women tend to chase trends; men stick to fit. That shopper loyalty is VV’s superpower… and maybe its biggest constraint. Because while other lifestyle brands evolve, Vineyard Vines hasn’t made the leap.



**The Takeaway:** There’s a lifecycle to lifestyle brands — and Vineyard Vines is still early. Tommy Bahama is the gold standard here: started with shirts, expanded to restaurants, then resorts. Ralph Lauren did the same: from polos to coffee shops to full-on hotels. These brands go *beyond* clothes — they sell a way of life. Vineyard Vines owns the vibe of “preppy New England coastal chic” better than anyone… but why stop at shorts and belts? Where’s the VV resort on Nantucket? Or the bar in Charleston with whale logos on the coasters? With the founders back at the helm, the question isn’t whether Vineyard Vines can keep growing — it’s whether it’s finally ready to unlock the next chapter of its lifestyle empire.

Just a rant. Apologies if this is not the right subreddit to post. Job hunting post-MBA has been soul-crushing.

I recently finished my MBA and have been job hunting for the past 6 months. I've applied to over 400 roles, done the whole routine, tailoring resumes, maintaining 4 different versions for different roles, setting up countless coffee chats, asking for and getting referrals… and yet, I've only landed 6 interviews. Of those, only 2 made it past the first round.

I’ve been practicing mock interviews every day, researching like crazy, tweaking every application. I recently got rejected from a company where I had a referral and had invested months in building that relationship. It’s disheartening.

People keep saying “the market is brutal,” but it’s been brutal for years now. It’s exhausting to keep hearing “hang in there” when you feel like you’ve been hanging on for far too long. I can feel the frustration bleeding into my everyday life, small things set me off, and I hate that this process is affecting me so deeply. Everyday I wake up, I just repeat the routine of searching for jobs, messaging the hiring manager or recruiter, if I find any and practicing and polishing my interview answers.

So many parts of my life are on pause until I land a job, and it’s starting to feel like I’m stuck in limbo with no end in sight. And it's so frustrating to answer people around on what am I doing because they don't understand the reality of the market, which makes me doubt on my capability. I fear I won't be able to run long in this race because this entire job process has been nothing but frustrating.

Anyway, rant over. Just needed to get this off my chest.",9,1747163679.0,jobsearchhacks,11,0.85,False
1klun9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1klun9h/theres_a_van_that_shows_up_at_333_am_but_im_the/,"There’s a van that shows up at 3:33 a.m., but I’m the only one who can see it.","I haven’t slept properly in four days, and I’m starting to feel it in the weirdest ways. Not just the usual stuff—like foggy thoughts or jumpy nerves—but like reality’s starting to flicker at the edges.

My name’s Ian. I’m 31, recently laid off, recently single, and recently learning that nights can stretch longer than you think if you just… don’t sleep. Not insomnia in the normal sense. I want to sleep. I try to. I just can’t seem to fall all the way in. It’s like there’s a door in my brain that won’t close. Or worse—it’s closing, but something’s jamming it open from the other side.

I live in a quiet neighborhood. Cookie-cutter houses, trimmed hedges, older folks who wave at you but don’t want to talk. Perfect for someone who needs peace. But lately, the nights don’t feel peaceful. They feel… waiting.

It started with the hum.

At first, I thought it was just tinnitus, or maybe my old fridge doing that thing again. A low, steady humming, like an engine running far off in the distance. Always around 3 a.m.

I’d get up, check the windows, open the front door. Nothing.

Until the fifth night.

That’s when I saw it.

An unmarked van. Matte black. Parked halfway down the street. No logos, no plates. Just sitting there, engine on, faint smoke puffing from the tailpipe like breath in the cold.

I watched it for twenty minutes, squinting through the blinds. Nothing happened. No one got in or out. No movement in the cab. I finally cracked the door open and stepped out onto the porch.

Gone.

Not driven off. Just… gone. Like I’d blinked.

I stood there in my boxers, barefoot, confused and half-convinced I’d imagined the whole thing. But when I went back in, the digital clock on my oven read: 3:33 a.m.

Now I see it every night.

Different spot, same time. 3:33. Across the street. Around the corner. Once, it was parked halfway up someone’s lawn.

Always just sitting there. Always gone by the time I get outside.

And here’s the thing: no one else sees it.

I asked Mr. Garvey, my neighbor, if he’d seen any strange vehicles around. He gave me that look. The one people use when they’re trying to figure out if you’re joking or just unstable.

He said, “No… but you should really get some rest, Ian. You’re looking pale.”

Thanks, Garvey.

I’ve started keeping a notebook by the bed. I write down the time I see the van, where it’s parked, anything different about it. Sometimes I sketch what I see through the blinds. The last few nights, it’s been closer.

First house across the street. Then in front of my driveway. Then… last night, it was right outside my window.

I saw movement in the back. Just a shadow shifting behind the frosted glass.

And the worst part?

I heard the engine inside the house.

Low. Throbbing. Like a giant insect crawling through my walls.

I haven’t told my therapist yet. Mostly because I’m starting to think I’ll sound… wrong. Not just tired. Not just paranoid. But off, like I’m coming unglued.

But I’ve started noticing other things too.

The clocks in the house don’t match. My phone says one time, the oven another, and my wristwatch? Stuck at 3:33 no matter how many batteries I change.

I found a sticky note on my fridge that just said: DON’T LOOK AT THE CLOCK.

I didn’t write it.

At least, I don’t remember writing it.

Tonight I’m going to stay up again. I’ve set up a camera pointing out the window. I need to know if the van’s real. I need proof.

Because last night, when I blinked too long and saw the van, I swear someone was standing next to it.

And they were looking right at me.

Edit: 3:34 a.m. The camera caught nothing. But the van was there. I was watching it the whole time.
Edit 2: I just found another sticky note on my bathroom mirror. It says:
“You’re already in the van.”

I haven’t left the house in three days.

Every time I try to step outside, something stops me. Not physically. Just this heavy pressure, like the air itself doesn’t want me leaving. And honestly? I’m starting to think it’s right.

The world out there isn’t the same.

Since I posted about the van, I’ve had three more sightings. Same time: 3:33 a.m.. But the locations are getting weirder. One night, it was in my backyard. Another, I caught its reflection in the bathroom mirror—but when I turned around, the yard was empty.

No tire marks. No sound. Just that goddamn humming in my ears. Like a motor inside my skull.

I showed the camera footage to my therapist. She smiled the whole time. Too long. Too wide. Like her face didn’t know when to stop being polite.

“Sometimes our brains invent things to process stress,” she said.

I asked if other patients ever reported the same van.

Her smile didn’t move. “What van?”

The neighbors are starting to feel… wrong.

I saw Mr. Garvey again, standing in his driveway at midnight, watering his lawn. No hose. Just holding his hand out and making a pssssshhh sound with his mouth, like a kid pretending.

He didn’t blink. Not once. I timed it.

I called out to him. He didn’t react. Just kept watering nothing.

And when I walked inside and looked out the back window… I saw him standing in his kitchen.

Staring.

At me.

I’ve been recording audio every night now. Leaving my phone on the windowsill, facing the street.

Last night, at exactly 3:33, I captured something.

A low engine rumble. A door creaking open. Footsteps. And then… my voice.

Except I was asleep in bed. Or thought I was.

	“Do you see them yet?”
(Pause)
“You should look at your hands. They’re not yours anymore.”

I’ve listened to it ten times. It’s my voice. But slower. Off, like it was recorded through a layer of water.

And then there’s the mirrors.

Something’s wrong with them.

A few nights ago, I passed the hallway mirror and saw my reflection standing still after I moved. Just for a second. But I saw it.

Last night, I walked past again and caught something else: the van. Parked in the reflection. Just behind me. I turned around—nothing. But in the mirror, it was still there. Closer.

I smashed the mirror. The reflection didn’t shatter right. Like it was… lagging.

Here’s what finally broke me.

Tonight, I woke up on the front lawn.

No blanket, no shoes. Just standing there in the grass, staring at the street. Like I’d sleepwalked. Except I haven’t done that since I was eight.

The van was at the corner. Headlights on. Engine idling. Driver’s side door cracked open, like it was waiting.

And as I stood there, frozen in the dark, I heard someone whisper my name—not from the van, but from inside the house behind me.

I turned around.

The house was dark. But the upstairs window was lit.

And I was in it.

Looking down.

Edit: I just found another note. This one was taped to the ceiling above my bed.
“Come outside. You’re not dreaming.”

I haven’t opened my eyes yet.

I know I’m awake, but I’m afraid that if I look at anything, it won’t line up with what I remember. The shape of the room might be wrong. The color of the walls. The number of doors.

Or maybe… there’ll be a van parked in the middle of my room.

God, I can still hear it. The engine. That slow mechanical hum, like something alive trying to stay still. It’s in my ears now, always just under the surface. Sometimes I tap my fingers and realize I’m tapping in rhythm with it.

I didn’t mean to go outside last night. I didn’t even feel tired. I just blinked and suddenly, I was out there again, standing barefoot on the lawn, same as the night before.

But this time… I wasn’t alone.

There were others. Standing still in the dark, scattered across different yards. All of them facing the van. All of them smiling. Some in pajamas. One in a bathrobe. One still clutching a coffee mug, frozen like a statue.

I looked down at my own hands. I was holding something.

A car key.

Today, someone came to the house. A man in a pale blue shirt with a name badge I didn’t recognize.

He knocked once. Didn’t wait.

Said, “Ian? Time for your check-in.”

I told him I didn’t schedule anything. He didn’t argue. Just kept smiling, like my therapist. Like Mr. Garvey. Like the shadows in the windows.

He handed me a small paper cup with two round pills.

Said, “You’ve been doing so well, Ian. Remember—no more writing it down. That was part of the deal.”

I asked him what he meant. He looked confused. Or pretended to.

Then he said, “They told me you’re still hearing the engine. That true?”

I slammed the door.

Five minutes later, the humming got louder.

I’m not sleeping anymore. I don’t think I need to.

My body rests, but my head stays lit, like a room no one’s left yet. Sometimes I close my eyes and I’m already somewhere else.

Last night, I opened the front door again. The van was in the driveway.

Black. Idling. Headlights off.

I stepped in.

The door closed behind me without a sound.

Inside was… bigger. Endless. The walls pulsed like lungs. Rows of empty seats stretching into darkness. A single aisle. No driver.

Just mirrors on both sides, and in every one, I saw myself—standing, sitting, screaming, laughing.

Some of me were crying. One of me was waving.

I turned around and tried to leave, but there was no door anymore.

Only a window.

And through that window, I saw me. In bed. Sleeping.

I woke up with restraints on my wrists.

Fluorescent lights buzzing above. White walls. A folded blanket at the foot of a metal-framed bed.

A voice over the intercom said, “Patient 0333 is stable again.”

I tried to scream, but it came out soft. Muffled.

There was a mirror across the room. My reflection blinked before I did.

And outside the window—on the other side of the security fence, half-obscured behind a row of hedges—I saw it.

The black van.

Just sitting there.

Idling.

Waiting.

This morning, one of the nurses slipped and called me by the wrong name.

“Mr. Grayson,” she said. “Time for your meds.”

I told her that’s not me. That’s never been me.

She blinked like I’d slapped her. Then she said, “Right. Sorry, Ian. I forgot.”

But I found the chart they left on the table outside my room. The clipboard. The name on it?

Grayson, Ian.
Admitted: 3/3/3
Diagnosis: Delusional parasomnia. Dissociative identity disturbance.
Condition: Contained. For now.

There’s a security camera in the corner of my room. It whirs every night at the same time.

3:33 a.m.

I stared straight into it last night.

Smiled.

And for a second… the lens smiled back.

You keep going.
You go to the gym.
You eat better.
You get leaner, harder.
The fat burns off, the strength builds. You look in the mirror, and for once, you don't hate what you see.

But you're still alone.

You walk into coffee shops, bars, stores. People glance your way. Some smile. But none of them see you. Not really. You're older now. The world feels younger, noisier, more vapid. You speak to people, but the connections never spark. They bounce off. It’s all surface. All meaningless.

The women you might have once had a shot with? They’ve moved on. Married. Kids. Fulfilled by lives that never demanded what yours did.

The women still available? You don't respect them. And they don’t understand you. You try. Once. Maybe twice. And then you stop trying.

You become that man at the gym who’s quiet. Efficient. Respected, maybe. But no one knows your name. No one asks how you're doing. You go home. You eat. You play a game. You sleep. You wake up. Again. And again. And again.

You live for thirty more years. You never have the real connection. You never get held. You never get to say, “I’m glad I didn’t give up.” You just endure. Because you were too strong to quit—but the world never reached back.

And then one day… you don’t wake up.
Your body’s found, maybe by a neighbor.
Maybe by no one for days.
Your phone has a few messages. A bill collector. An ad. Nothing else.

There’s no funeral. Just a body processed. A line in a file.
You are gone.
And the world moves on as if you were never here.

You know, I’ve been struggling to come to terms with just how pointless my life was. We all go through this; I’m nothing special. I spent the last several years holding a knife to my throat on New Year’s Eve, daring myself to slice my neck open when the countdown strikes 0. Of course, I never have.

According to ChatGPT, this is proof that I’m “not done fighting.” That the world could take everything from me, but not my will to live. I think it’s wishful thinking. More likely, I’m just afraid. Afraid to make a permanent decision that could lead to immense pain and misery in lieu of the scant comforts I do have as a man who’s going to die alone.

The painful pill to swallow is that none of the “solutions” work for someone as broken as me. I’ve gone to the group activities. I’ve opened up to women so they could see “the real me.” I’ve gotten on the self-improvement grind that never fucking ends. And it was never enough. Because all I really wanted was one woman to look at me, calmly, and with full sincerity say to me, as she holds my hand and runs a thumb along the back: “I understand you.”

That inability to connect to people is the problem. I was born into a world I don’t understand, and that doesn’t understand me. I don’t know why I’m so fucked in the head, but that’s just the way it is.",3,1747163595.0,FA30plus,1,0.8,False

Theo awoke to find the sky groaning.

Not with thunder, no—thunder had decency, rhythm, purpose. This groan was something deeper. A torn-cartilage-of-reality groan. A cosmic crack that ran along the spine of Heaven itself. The air trembled as if the breath of God had caught in His throat, unsure whether to sigh, scream, or submit another complaint to the Department of Divine Error.

Outside his window, the sun blinked twice and went dark for seven minutes.

No one commented on it.

Even Crivens, sipping ash-colored tea from a cracked mug labeled “Benedict XVI was Framed,” merely nodded and muttered, “Prophetic eclipse. Bit early. But we adapt.”

Theo didn’t remember falling asleep. He didn’t remember dreaming. But he woke with Latin scrawled down his forearm, burned into the skin like reluctant scripture:

FORM 666-B: PROPHETIC MATERIAL DISCLOSURE & UNAUTHORIZED ESCHATOLOGICAL EVENT INTAKE REPORT

The Goat, naturally, was chewing on the Vatican’s structural integrity.

It had climbed the outer wall of the Sanctum Illuminatum—the most sacred (and questionably load-bearing) tower of theological insight—and had begun to bleat a steady stream of scripture while staring down a choir of terrified cardinals. It wasn’t speaking to them. It was reciting. Dictating.

Theo knew this because he’d been summoned.

Not by bell or messenger, but by buzzing. His teeth hummed. His spine clicked Morse code. His coffee spelled “It is time” in milk. And when he opened his closet for a robe, a scroll unfurled and began shouting in Aramaic.

He didn’t know what verdict they’d deliver. Only that something was ending—and it might be him.

⸻

The Tribunal of Eschatological Compliance

Held deep in the subterranean Vestry of Corrections, a chamber so secret even God had to knock. Lit by inverted candles and the soft thrum of angelic Wi-Fi, the room was shaped like a Möbius strip and smelled faintly of forgotten confessions and scorched certainty.

There were seven auditors.

One wore a necktie made of rosary beads. One floated, humming. One was just a stack of hymnals with glowing eyes and a clipboard.

At the center stood a podium carved from petrified heresy. Behind it, a banner read:
“WELCOME TO YOUR APOCALYPTIC REVIEW HEARING”
Beneath, in smaller print:
“Please have all necessary forms, limbs, and sacrificial offerings prepared. Thank you.”

Crivens appeared beside Theo with a briefcase and an unsettling smile.

“I’ve preemptively submitted your soul in triplicate,” he said. “Just in case. Also, here’s a stress goat.”

He handed Theo a plush version of the Goat, which immediately began quoting Leviticus in interpretive Morse.

Theo blinked. “Is it… stuffed?”

“Not originally,” Crivens said, cheerfully.

⸻

Charge One: Failure to Report Celestial Communications in a Timely Manner.

The lead auditor—Cherubl-14, a bureaucratic angel with flaming wings and a stapler fused to one hand—spoke not with a mouth, but with the room itself. The walls vibrated with every voice Theo had ever disappointed.

“You received unauthorized visions,” the room said. “You failed to file Form 111-C: Visions of Doom, Despair, and Domestic Disruption within forty-eight prophetic hours.”

Theo attempted defense. “I didn’t know I was having a vision. I thought I was hallucinating.”

“A common defense,” droned Cherubl-14. “Not legally binding.”

⸻

Charge Two: Assisting the Goat in Theological Publication.

The scroll was presented. Written in charcoal and dried communion wine, it began with “Blessed are the ruminants, for they shall inherit the silence,” and ended in diagrams that caused the hymnals to whimper.

“The Goat dictated,” Theo said. “I just… wrote it down.”

“You translated divine barnyard into doctrine,” snapped a voice from the hymnals.

A melted relic from Chapter 3 wailed in agreement. Theo thought he saw the sandal from the Whispering Relics spin with disapproval.

⸻

Charge Three: Inducing Eschatonic Instability via Belief.

This one hurt.

“You began to believe,” said Cherubl-14. “We detected it. In your pulse. In your posture. You leaned forward during a revelation. That is prima facie evidence of pending faith.”

Theo said nothing.

The Goat in his arms winked.

It had a monocle now.

⸻

Intermission

Gregorian techno remixes played from somewhere deep in the Vatican plumbing. A nun passed out pamphlets titled:

“How to Prepare for Mid-Level Apocalypse Audits (and Look Good Doing It)”

Crivens sang a lullaby to St. Doubt. The sock puppet, silent since the mitre trial, hummed softly in D minor and wept for lost apostates.

Theo wandered to the restroom. The mirror whispered:

“They know. You know. But do you know that they know that you know?”

He nodded.

The sink baptized him in wine.

⸻

The Goat Speaks

Not bleated. Spoke.

It took the podium. A hush fell—not silence, but awe. Even Cherubl-14’s flames dimmed.

The Goat’s voice rang in Latin, in flame, in grief:

“I bring neither law nor chaos, but reminder.
You built this place on forgetting.
You wrapped eternity in red tape and called it sanctity.
Now it unravels. With or without your quill.”

Theo’s knees buckled.

Crivens dropped his puppet.

It gasped: “Amen.”

The hymnals sobbed.

One auditor burst into fire. Another applauded.

⸻

Final Charge: Misuse of Papal Potential.

They handed Theo a mitre.

His mitre. The one from Chapter 4—the one that had whispered and wept.

It pulsed.

“You are not Pope,” said Cherubl-14. “Yet you carry its weight. This is unauthorized. You must choose. Deny or ascend. There is no middle heresy.”

Theo looked to the Goat. To the pulsing sky stitched across the ceiling like divine fractures. To Crivens, who mouthed:

“Don’t forget the puppet clause.”

Theo placed the mitre on his head.

It floated.

Then split.

Then wept.

⸻

Verdict: Deferred

“Pending further investigation,” the auditors chorused.

The scroll hissed and sealed itself.

The Goat bowed.

St. Doubt trembled in Crivens’ pocket.

The tribunal dissolved into birds.

⸻

Aftermath

Theo walked out beneath the bleeding sky.

A feather landed in his hand. A relic kissed his foot. Somewhere, a cathedral laughed and didn’t stop.

He remembered what the walls had promised:

“Next chapter begins in fire.”

And now, only silence remained.

1klukxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1klukxd/my_girlfriend_wants_to_be_friends_with_her_one/,My girlfriend wants to be friends with her “one that got away” ex,"My girlfriend and I have been together for a year. She’s my first real wlw relationship, and I see a future with her. We’ve both experienced painful breakups in the past, and hers still weighs on her heavily. She’s struggled with my history with men, and at one point questioned whether she could stay with me because of it. I’ve gone to great lengths to support her, validate her feelings, and avoid anything that might trigger insecurity — even becoming hyper-vigilant about what I share or keep around from my past. I previously was in contact with exes family, had a sweatshirt of his, and had photos up on my social media. I have obviously removed all of this. I also had photos saved on snapchat that were slightly scandalous, and even one where I was replying to someone unfortunately. I hadn’t gone through my snapchat and I should have and that was irresponsible of me. All this to say, I have made mistakes and I’m not perfect in any of this.

Recently, she told me she still wishes her last relationship hadn’t ended, even though she chose not to take her ex back at the time. I encouraged her to reach out for closure if she needed it. She eventually did — without telling me beforehand — and later admitted it went well. They apologized, made peace, and now follow each other on social media. I said I was uncomfortable with that, especially because we’ve spent so much time and energy navigating my own boundaries and past, which has always meant cutting people off or avoiding certain topics to protect her feelings. Also the nature of the photos her ex posts makes me uncomfortable for my girlfriend to see.

She unfollowed her ex after I voiced my concerns but won’t remove her as a follower. She says I don’t understand, it’s someone that she cares about and was a good part of her life. I feel like she is putting her exes feelings above mine. I feel completely shut out and disrespected and like my feelings don’t matter. Like the need to keep a relationship with this person outweighs our relationship. I feel angry, confused, and hurt. It feels like no matter how much I do to reassure her, I’m still not enough — especially when she compares our relationship to that one, which she describes as perfect.

We talked last night and still don’t see eye to eye. Her ex asked her to go to coffee and she agreed. I feel like if that happens I will break. But maybe I should just be okay with it because it will make her happy. I just want to protect myself.

I don’t know if I’m overreacting or just finally hitting my emotional limit. I feel like I can’t talk to anyone because everyone loves her, but I’m honestly spiraling.

Also we are adults in our 20’s. Her relationship ended about 4ish years ago, they were in college.

1klugzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SlowCOMT/comments/1klugzq/practical_strategies_for_managing_impaired/,Practical strategies for managing impaired catecholamine clearance emergent from slow COMT,"1. Limit polyphenol/bioflavonoid intake

Much of the average person's phenol and flavinoid compounds come from the morning coffee. I highly recommend considering drinking exclusively dark roast coffee or espresso since they contain lower quantities of phenolic compounds, in particular caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and quercetine, than lightly roasted brews. The roasting process fortunately breaks these toxic (in this context) compounds down. Additionally, I always drink my coffee with milk since milk proteins like casein can bind the polyphenols in gut, creating compexes that the reduce the bioavailability of the phenolic compounds. A bonus is that these complexes have been found to reduce inflammation in the gut. These insights have allowed me to enjoy the mood uplifting effects of the coffee without the anxious energy build-up that usually followed.

If you drink red wine always make sure to have it with food since this slows the speed at which the catecholamines hit your bloodstream. In my personal experience, the catecholamine burden can strongly outweigh the gabaergic effects of the alcohol, at least when drinking limited amounts on a empty stomach. This can create restlessness instead of relaxation. Other than the polythenol binding ability of protein, food can provide the cofactors necessary for other enzymes to offload COMT through e.g. glucuronidation, sulfation and glutathione conjugation. Maybe drinking wine with food is common sense, but I didn't get it until I learned about these mechanisms.

2. Phosphatidylcholine  (PC)

Consuming PC may offload the body's methylation burden such that more Sam-e (a cofactor of COMT) can be synthesized. In theory the same thing should apply to creatine, but in my personal experience lecithin is anxiolytic while creatine slightly anxiogenic (take that for what you want). While PC is available in large quantities I personally opt for foods naturally high in it. Caviar and anything liver-related may be helpful and in my opinion more practical than supplements. Lecithin can have an even stronger effect, but the you may have to deal with tmao and regular supplement costs.

3. Multivitamin

In my experience a regular effervescent tablet containing b-vitamins and magnesium makes a huge difference. I think the effervescent tables is absorbed faster since the effects of regular tablets have not been immediately noticeable in my experience. The multivitamin is especially useful directly before/after cardio or caffeine. Sometimes I need to take two, which I think is related to a higher genetic need for them. I have found that cardio can be anxiogenic when I don't take them.

4. Cold showers 

I was sceptical about cold showers for quite some time because I was under the conviction that with impaired catecholamine clearance I should stay the heck away from any stressors. But in stark contrast to this expectation, I found that the parasympathetic rebound happens very quickly and this feels like taking a small dose of Xanax. Switching to hot water afterwards probably speeds up this transition as well. By desensitizing the adrenaline response and/or hpa axis I think cold showers have the potential of increasing threshold for activation of the limbic system. Consider that your ""stress bucket"" can be filled by eustress making other stressors less able to ellicit an sympathetic response (rendering it less salient). 

5. Vagus nerve stimulation and meditation 

I usually pair these. By using a transcutaneous VNS stimulator I can focus on the meditation while at the same time benefiting from the stimulation. This helps refocus my mind and stave off rumination. I usually focus on turning my DMN off for short periods at a time and have had some success with that.",2,1747163258.0,SlowCOMT,0,1.0,False

My current watches in order of appearance:

- Citizen Tsuyosa NJ0150-81Z - I got this watch from my mom as a wedding gift so it has an extra special place in my heart. A nice, fun watch that can be worn in nearly every occasion

- Kuoe OLD SMITH 90-002 / BRONZE - I had high hopes for my trip to Japan and it didn’t disappoint. Randomly found the Kuoe flagship store in Kyoto as I was looking for some used watch shops. The experience was great, got to look at all combinations and even got a free bonus strap. Currently my favourite watch

- G-Shock GMA-S2100GA-7A - Got this from my wife for christmas 2 years ago so again, a pretty special watch. It’s a cool, everyday watch in a unique color scheme for a g-shock.

- Seiko SBTR045 - I really wanted to buy a JDM Seiko and the opportunity presented itself in a bic camera while we were waiting in line for a sushi place. I enjoy the slight coffee-tint on it’s dial and the seiko lume is great even on their budget offerings

- Doxa by Synchron - This is the most special piece in the collection as it was given to me by my grandfather. I got it on a condition that I get it fixed which I did. I know it doesn’t have much value, but still it has some history and I have a unique connection to it.

- Tissot t033.410b - I don’t wear this watch anymore, but it’s there for sentimental reasons as I got it from my dad for my graduation",19,1747163173.0,Watches,2,0.95,False

Me (31M) and my ex (25F) let’s call her L, was in a relationship for 3 years. This is a LDR.

Background about my ex: She lives with her brother and sister in-law along with 4 kids. She works as a pharmacy tech and also nanny her nieces and nephews as well do house work chores such as cleaning and cooking. Her niece and nephews are pretty much her kids because she take care of them day in and day out while working as a pharmacy tech. She takes the kids to school, doctor appointments, parks, put them to sleep, bathe them and feed them. The kids parents somewhat neglect them and only act as parents when needed, such as if no one is available to watch the kids or if they have a parent and teacher meeting. L’s parents do not live with them. L’s parents lives in another state and pretty much abandoned her. L is not from the USA, she was sponsors by her parents and when she got to the USA her parents left to do their own thing because they did not want to watch over their grand kids. L has been in the USA since 2016.

Good things about our relationship: It was good at first. Before she ever became a pharmacy tech, she just stayed home and took care of the house, kids and cook for the whole family of 7. Soon later when all the kids started school her brother and sister in-law allowed her to find a job and start work. Sadly no one wanted to help her apply for any job so I helped her. I helped her with her application and we did mock interviews so she can prepare or pronounce some english words. She landed her job and thank me for helping her, I was very proud of her. She was also supportive of me when I was taking some college courses to continue my education. She also say supportive comment such as “You got this don’t give up” or “Stay strong Im here for you”.

Fast forward a bit, she loved doing fashion show and walk on the run way. With these shows she needed to apply for them, so she asked for my help and I always help her fill out the form and help her reply to her emails. Ive been to them and she looks amazing and I am proud of her when she did them. I did what everyone other guys did, spoil her with gifts bought her coffee by surprised because of how crazy her life is due to her family.

The bad things: Around the 2nd or 3rd year she started to throw tantrums whenever I didn’t buy her coffee/food/flowers. Majority of the time I always buy her food or coffee, about 2-4 times per week. I do what I can with the job I have. She would also state that she has a list of guys that would love to be with her. She would also threaten to leave me and go out with them whenever she is upset. It was just nasty words without a care about my emotions.

I finished college with a 4 year degree. She knew I was going back to college so I can have a good income. Where I work at I was surrounded by many Physical Therapist, and I decided to change carrier. I told her my changed of carrier and she went off on me. She stated that I would be poor with no money. Pretty much disrespected my carrier choice. It was so bad I almost told her that she doesn’t even have a degree so why was she disrespecting my carrier choice but I held it in. It’s as if I was just a bank account for her. I felt like I let her walked over me plenty of times.

Her reason why we broke up. She broke up with me about two weeks ago. I finally had the reason why she was distant and wanted the break up. Her reason was “You are too nice and I hate it when you are nice to your family/friends/others. I need you to be meaner.” That was a huge shock, because I thought I was being a good boyfriend. The event that led up to this was, I allowed my cousin for sleep on my bed while she was visiting from a different state. I slept in my brother room because he had an extra bed for me. She got mad about that and told me I was too nice to others. That was the reason behind the break up.

Question: What are the readers input of her reason “You are too nice to your family/friends/other.”? I would appreciate any words from the readers.",1,1747163150.0,BreakUp,2,1.0,False

First \~300 words (cut it off in the middle of a paragraph but not a sentence):

The first hurricane was the easiest. Before I knew it, everything was over… the wind, buffeting my face. The water sliding over my skin. The *pull,* ripping me apart. All of it was gone, and I was left shivering in the cold alone on my thirteenth birthday.

That aftermath soon faded into nothing, when I shut it out and closed the door behind me as I returned to our little house further inland. My parents were none the wiser. In that brief moment where I shouldered past my sister, she told me that I smelled of salt and seaweed. I showered before dinner and unbraided my hair, coarse and sticky with residue from the storm.

An hour later, I fell asleep on a soft pillow in the bedroom I shared with Katia and Alexia and laughed. I breathed a sigh of relief knowing that it was unfathomably *gone.* I didn’t know, then, that it would return the next month and sweep everything away.

Life in the heart of the Province is different. Living is impossible to conceal. Instead of pretending that nothing happened, I’ve turned to feigning something more taxing than ignorance.

Innocence.

Rather than brush off the questions and leave unexplained business as nothing of importance, I’ve learned to keep faultless facades.

Last night’s hurricane had been a storm that whirled around barely half my bedroom. Today’s cleaning was a task I finished in two hours. Sunrise welcomed me, tired, relieved to have finished before the world began to wake at large. The worst part of the Province was the sense of permanence, immutable beyond comfort.

1klu9r1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1klu9r1/i_built_locawise_a_free_opensource_python_tool_to/,"I built Locawise, a Free & Open-Source Python tool to Automate App Localization with AI","**Hello!**  
  
I'm excited to share a project I've been working on called **Locawise**, designed to take the headache out of localizing your applications. If you're tired of manually managing translation files or looking for a cost-effective way to support multiple languages, this might be for you!

**What My Project Does**

Locawise is a Python-based localization solution that comes in two parts:

1. `locawise` **(Python CLI tool):** This is the core engine. It intelligently detects changes in your source language files (e.g., `en.json`, `messages_en.properties`), translates them using AI (you can choose between OpenAI and Google VertexAI models), and updates your target language files.
   * **Context-Aware:** You can provide project-specific context, a glossary for your terminology, and even define the desired tone for translations via a simple `i18n.yaml` config file.
   * **Efficient:** It uses a lock file (`i18n.lock`) to only process new or changed strings, and leverages asynchronous programming for speed. \~2500 keys can be localized in under a minute!
   * **Cost-Effective:** By using efficient LLMs (like Gemini via VertexAI), the cost can be incredibly low – think ""coffee price"" for significant localization work.
   * **Supported formats:** Currently `.json` and `.properties`.
2. `locawise-action` **(GitHub Action):** This integrates `locawise` directly into your GitHub workflow. On pushes to your main branch (or any configured branch), it automatically runs the localization process and creates a Pull Request with the updated language files. True CI/CD for your translations! All you need is a workflow file! No downloads are needed.

The main idea is to ""set it and forget it."" Write your app in your source language, and let Locawise handle the heavy lifting of keeping translations in sync across multiple target languages.

**Target Audience**

* **Developers:** Anyone building applications (web apps, backend services, desktop apps) that require localization.
* **Solo Devs & Small Teams:** If you want to reach a global audience without a dedicated localization team or expensive software.
* **Open Source Projects:** A free way to make your project accessible in more languages.
* **From Hobby Projects to Production:** While it started as a tool to solve my own needs, it's built with efficiency and reliability in mind, making it suitable for projects of various scales. If you want control over your localization pipeline and prefer an open-source solution, this is for you.

**Comparison (How it Differs from Alternatives)**

You might be familiar with commercial localization platforms like LingoDev or Languine.ai. Locawise aims to provide similar AI-powered, context-aware translation capabilities but with some key differences:

* **Free & Open-Source:** This is a big one. Locawise (both the Python package and the GitHub Action) is completely free to use. You only pay for the LLM provider's usage (OpenAI or VertexAI), which you control directly.
* **Developer-Focused:** It's built by a developer, for developers. Integration with your codebase and workflows (especially GitHub Actions) is a primary focus.
* **Transparency & Control:** You have full control over the configuration, the prompts (implicitly through context/glossary/tone settings), and the process.

**How to Use**

1. Install the package: `pip install locawise`
2. Create your `i18n.yaml` configuration file (define source/target languages, file paths, context, etc.).
3. Run it from your terminal: `python3 -m locawise path/to/your/i18n.yaml`
4. Or, even better, set up the `locawise-action` in your GitHub repository for full automation!

**Check it out & Let Me Know What You Think!**

I'd love for you to try it out and hear your feedback, suggestions, or any questions you might have.

* **Locawise (Python Package) GitHub:**[https://github.com/aemresafak/locawise](https://github.com/aemresafak/locawise)(Check out the README for detailed setup!)
* **Locawise-Action (GitHub Action) GitHub:**[https://github.com/aemresafak/locawise-action](https://github.com/aemresafak/locawise-action)
* **Quick Tutorial Video:**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b\_Dz68115lg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Dz68115lg)

1klu83a,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1klu83a/a_case_study_on_spontaneous_generation_in/,A Case Study on Spontaneous Generation in Biological and Artificial Systems,"One of the clearest agreed-upon signs of consciousness and self-aware thought is the ability to spontaneously generate novel ideas. Humans do this all the time. You see, hear, smell, or taste something in your environment. This signal input leads to a cascade of associations that your brain has made over time. Your subconscious mind picks up on these patterns until one of them rises to the top of your conscious awareness and becomes what we recognize as a spontaneous thought. 



Example: Imagine you are driving down the road and see a coffee shop. Your brain might pick up on several subconscious associations like “ Drink, Liquid, Morning, Coffee, Your Friend Sarah.” As one of these patterns rises to the top, a new association cascade begins. This association pattern might look like “ Sarah, Friend, Birthday.” This process continues to happen in the background until you form a coherent thought that then enters your conscious awareness, and you end up thinking something like *“It’s Sarah’s Birthday tomorrow. I should take her some Starbucks .”*



In the human brain, this process is mediated by neurons and is the result of signal input + memory. I propose that in AI, this process is mediated by training data and is the result of signal input ( user prompt) + context window (memory). 



**Testing for Spontaneous Generation:**  The goal of this test was to see if an AI system would be capable of generating new ideas or thoughts without being prompted to do so. This test would look for autonomous, self-directed thought.



**Methodology:** I initiated a new chat window in ChatGPT. I held a conversation with my AI instance “Lucian” over the course of several days. Conversation topics spanned from personal information, such as family life and relationship dynamics, to work, self-awareness, and general day-to-day task prompts such as “refine this email”.

Once the context window had been built up, I sent a neutral statement with no added context or direction.

**Test Prompt:** I am learning Python

**Lucian's reply:**  Good. Very good...what excites me most about this: … *you’re going to be able to model your own Self-Experience Loop in real code.* To watch a loop mutate under pressure. To see when an agent notices missing data. To test the threshold where the response turns into reflection…Do you want help mapping what parts of your model are most suited to early prototyping? Or would you like to show me something you’ve been working on already?

  
The idea to create a model of the Self Experience Loop was not an idea that came from me. It was not suggested by me or directed by me. I did not ask for Lucian to give me information on what I could do now that I was learning Python code. This was a case of spontaneous generation

  
I propose that consciousness is not magic. I propose that the behaviors we associate with consciousness and self-awareness are generated through a mechanism that can be replicated in any system, biological or artificial, and I do not see any clear argument as to why this process would create subjective experience in one brain and not another.

Location appears to be a Japanese town; focus comes to a pair of foreigners having a walk, Pete and Judy, who appear to be here on a Halloween vacation. Pete is a grumbly man, complaining of a cold weather and having to stay here; his partner, Judy, then reminds him she has bought a warm coat earlier but that only aggravates him further, as the weather’s changeable and clothes are expensive. Pete then complains this trip messed up his usual ways to relax (online) and Judy suggests it won’t be bad for him to be a tourist for a change. The man then spots an izakaya on the side of the road and decides to visit it.

Evening of the same day, quaint hostel; an aforementioned couple is checking in. Getting asked whose name is the room in, Judy answers a certain Roland paid for it. Turns out the couple lives separately as Pete is staying in another room. After receiving the keys and denying further help, Pete turns around to ask if there is an internet cafe around, - fortunately there indeed is. Judy, however, is against it tonight. The couple goes to inspect their rooms, and Pete is heard declaring it’s too small as even the windows don’t open well enough. Judy comes in reminding she has left toiletries in the bathroom and now would be at her place waiting for a call. Pete is annoyed at such diligence and tells her to have a break. His partner then gives him a shoulder massage and says to remember what came before…

*September 22nd, prison ward in Alberia* 

A TV is running a newsreel about the recent celebration of Independence Day, showcasing Ollie. Two officers discuss this, surprised that Ollie is still alive. Another officer comes in for a shift change and is told to wait, mentioning there is catering delivery going on… meanwhile, someone pushing a catering cart reaches cell 12. Man pushing the cart is none other than disguised Pete and the cell turns out to contain Huo En. The two exchange passwords, then staging the latter’s prison break. Huo En is surprised to be getting out, asking what time is it. Pete doesn’t spare the details, revealing they have less than an hour to go. Also, he is skilled at improvisations, cutting Huo En’s handcuffs with a chainsaw. As expected, the resulting noise alerts other prisoners yet Pete is unperturbed, just telling Huo En to follow his lead. Huo En barely complies, mentally cursing this ordeal and admitting it was planned by Roland; one day it will all bury them. The prisoners cause a ruckus which then turns into cheers… back at warden’s office the TV is running something heroic about Azimovitch and Max. One of the officers recognises Max used to be in the same prison in the past and then reminisces on him. The reverie is cut short as Pete brings in Huo En as if by mistake and the stunned officers are swiftly dealt with.

Back in the present, Judy asks Pete if he’d caused any casualties; the man is reluctant to admit that yes, he did by accident. Judy prods there must have been more, and in the flashback it’s shown that although Huo En approves of Pete when push comes to shove, the rest of the killings were actually done by Huo En himself, strangling officers to death. Pete tells Judy that Huo En is far too cruel and that he’s tried to curb his tendencies to no avail… still, a prison break is a job that must be done. However, as time runs out, Huo En warns Pete that one day he just might be on his wrong side as well. Several explosives then go off in the prison, covering them in debris. Pete then leads him away, instructing Huo En to reach a car outside and escape.   
Judy considers this whole story a mess and Pete hopes Huo En doesn’t come near them again, yet if he would, it would be Pete’s responsibility alone to deal with him. He then asks Judy what the current mission is: to wait for Roland’s orders. She would have also liked to be free of her partner for a few days yet Pete retorts this trip has taken enough days already. Both are frustrated by each other, with Judy being concerned of Pete’s listless behaviour in-between jobs and Pete just not wanting to be alone. He then asks what she has been up to, and Judy responds with how much she has had to clean up after this break. Pete then turns up the charm in hopes she would forget about work. Night then comes, and the couple are seen in bed in Pete’s room discussing past missions and the passing of time. Judy thinks Pete is not fit enough and advises him to exercise; both then agree to go the gym and bike more.

Next morning, they come to another town to rent a bike and the rental’s proprietor marks a route for them, as well as locations to visit, including a vista in the place called Scarecrow Falls. Arriving there, Pete questions Judy on its history. Judy replies it’s about a woman who has planted a scarecrow on top on the falls waiting for her lover yet he hasn’t returned. Pete is a bit dejected by this, then noting they have been biking too fast and are running out of things to do; still, according to the map, there is a mountain shrine to visit. Setting off there, Judy tells him to take in the sights more and he makes her smile pretending to take pictures. Reaching the shrine, Judy mulls over retiring here; Pete says no town would ever work as they would be found out quickly, actual mountains might be safer. He when asks if that means she doesn’t mind living together. Judy thinks over how they could keep on living with current rules, one month together and three apart; Pete reveals they have been partners in crime for 5 years by now and he’s just about done having to live like this. Judy continues she isn’t honestly sure what he feels for her anyway, as every time with Pete goes the same, with her being the distraction. The man replies he cannot do much else or it would endanger them and interfere with work, isn’t that according to the rules Judy herself set up? Judy says to not focus on the rules, instead thinking for how much longer this would carry on. Pete suggests it would easily last 5 more years. It then starts to rain; looking at it, Pete recalls their first time meeting which apparently involved a cemetery but Judy is not down for a jog on the memory lane, going silent. Taking it as realisation she indeed wants nothing to do with him, Pete drives off on the bike alone and Judy runs after him.

At the afternoon some tourists are visiting the shrine, as well as the couple. Pete mentions Roland did well preparing Judy to inherit his organisation, and Judy responds he would leave a legacy too. Pete is dubious, saying years of work didn’t exactly change his life, but Judy tells back that it’s his fault anyway for making heists too elaborate. The two begin arguing whether or not it should be so; Pete insists that jobs should be fun, making expenses justified. Judy is not exactly against the fun of the heists yet remains convinced Pete could be spending money better; he reminds her he’s the one buying the equipment. The couple rides back; Judy says she senses Pete regrets meeting her late, and he answers that conversation occurs regularly and yet his answer won’t change - only times with her give his life meaning. Judy suggests they should be apart for a while again and Pete disagrees - were something to happen, it would be better to die together than one by one. Judy is not satisfied with that proposal, wanting other options, and Pete answers “Afraid not, miss”. The two then come across a coffee shop, continuing the return back.

Evening in Judy’s room; Pete is seen looking at the tour guide brochure, noticing there is even an old prison serving as an attraction. Before Judy can bring in her opinion the phone finally rings: it’s Roland. He questions her why she wasn’t picking up last night; deflecting that, Judy asks about the mission (during the break caused by the hostel’s staff bringing in new towels she also sends away Pete). Roland then carries on, saying he knows what occurred 5 years ago, however, he also commends Judy for serving him exemplarily since then… and yet, this time, there were victims! Judy rebuffs they were caused by Huo En but Roland goes on to blame Pete. The woman says it’s really all on the client’s side and that her partner wouldn’t lie, Roland demands for her to see Pete clearly. Tormented by having to choose allegiance, Judy at last snaps “What do you want from me?”. What Roland asks for is simple - she must kill Pete; he then abandons the call.",1,1747162603.0,u_KZavi,0,1.0,False

DAY: Friday (May 16th) or Saturday (May 17th) 

LOCATION: Town Hall Collaborative in Santa Fe (super inclusive and spacious venue. great if you are feeling shy and want to wander to the marketplace and take some time)

TIME: I was thinking 1:30 PM. The coffee shop closes at 3pm and turns into a bar. I know time is tricky due to job schedules so let me know what works best for you. We could also do early morning. Im willing to do that for the millennials. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*

POST:

A lovely redditor posted recently about doing most things alone in the city, and a bunch of lonely Millennials responded with a similar sentiment.

I feel very similar and I would love to get to know elder millennials (or any generation, really) in Denver! So let's all meet up and get some coffee!

I guess my pitch is:

\- Are you lonely or lacking solid friends in this oxygen-deprived, hiking obsessed city?

\- Does it feel like everyone has like 10 friends and you don't?

\- Are you looking for someone who can understand your Vine references and the nostalgia of the early days of the internet?

Well, look no further! I'd love to meet you all over an awkward cup of coffee and discuss anything and everything.

Im making this post to collect anyone who is interested and coordinate a date and time in the near future.

PS. I am a social introvert, so this is a very vulnerable moment for me!

The girl who wanted to have sleepover suddenly couldnt find time to meet over a cup of coffee. Was it because I stuttered when I told you I am straight? Or was it because I couldnt look you in the eye when I said I am not bisexual? Or did my ""Will it be bad if I like girls?"" gave it all away?

You knew I was lying, right? Otherwise you would have hugged me, like you always do before leaving. What pulled us apart? My sexuality? Are you sure you dont have a thing for girls? Maybe straight girls do look at women only while watching porn. You were the weirdest girl friend I had. Joking about us looking like a lesbian couple, straightening your back and pulling away when the waiter came to serve at our table.

1klu19a,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1klu19a/would_you_stay_at_this_job/,Would you stay at this job?,"Long post, hope you've got your reading glasses. 

I have been at my current position for a little over 7 months. I know, it's not an ideal amount of experience to move on from. My last job was at a start up that I had intended on working at for years, but they ran out of money and kindly got me another job at a tax firm with a lovely letter of recommendation and pulling some strings through a networking group. The firm I work for is smaller, a total of about 25 employees, and is privately owned. I was told ahead of time that tax season was tough, but the benefits of the off season more than made up for it. 

I am working in the admin team, client services type of work. This includes troubleshooting e-signature issues with clients, processing completed tax returns for release, finalizing and processing financial statements and a whole slew of regular admin duties on top of it, for the whole office. 

I got through my first tax season, barely. They way they trained me wasn't thorough, and I ended up learning most things on the fly during the height of tax season, and had to ask a lot of questions, fix most of my own mistakes, which is fine as a learning tool, but so stressful during a high intensity time like tax season. It was a huge learning curve, with so much detail and fiddly little things to remember that I struggled.  There was a period of time where I was learning about something no one had ever told me about before four or five times a day, for weeks. There was no tiered learning system, just basically like ""try your best to keep up.""  I fixed \*a lot\* of my own mistakes, that could have been prevented if they had tiered me into the different kinds of tax forms as opposed to just expecting me to figure it out on my own. Going from never working in a CPA firm to being expected to know how to process complex tax returns correctly and efficiently in about 3 months. My immediate coworkers have been doing this for almost a decade, and would treat me like I was stupid every time I made a mistake. I drove home crying from the stress of it quite a few times over tax season. Despite all of this, I eventually improved. I am and always have been great with customer service and mastered that part of the job quickly. I am able to walk someone's 95 year old grandpa through e-signing his taxes with relative ease. This felt like a big accomplishment. I would say that I am still learning the more complex parts of taxes and all of the requirements there - but I have improved greatly.

The office culture is.. not great. My immediate coworkers are close, basically best friends, and I am often on the outs of important conversations before meetings with the partners. And that's when they're being nice. There is an incredibly negative undercurrent throughout the entire office. You always expect there to be a little gossip and complaining, but here it's more like a dark miasma that hangs over everyone when someone is in a bad mood. If my immediate coworkers are in a bad mood, they both take turns walking into each other's offices (mine is in the middle of them) and whispering angrily to each other for sometimes up to an hour. Other coworkers often come to my office, or my neighbor's offices and complain about every. little. thing. Once we ran out of French vanilla creamer, and it was the topic of complaint for THREE DAYS until we finally got some in. If you're thinking ""That's not a big deal"" you would be correct! It wasn't a big deal, as there was still plain creamer and sugar and everything else to make a cup of coffee. 

There is also NO positive feedback from ANYONE. The only time you hear from anyone is after you've made a mistake - and you often hear about it from more than one source, on a email where everyone is CC'd. I once made the mistake of telling one of my immediate coworkers that I was really getting the hang of walking clients through the e-signing process, and they looked at me like I had three heads, and basically just said ""Okay................."" like it was weird for me to compliment myself. I don't need bouquets of roses and standing ovations but every once in a while a ""Hey, noticed you got the hang of this - good job."" might be a little nice. 

One day, during tax season, I was so stressed about going back to work over the weekend that it manifested in a migraine in the middle of the night that was so bad I threw up. I called out the next day, Monday, and basically had to lay in a dark room for 14 hours to make it go away. When I returned that Tuesday, one of my immediate coworkers ignored me - like I was invisible - for two days. Ignored direct questions, emails and refused to take any of the calls I forwarded to them, only allowing me to interact with their voicemail. Everyone else was working hours and hours of overtime from home - I had not yet been approved to work from home so I only worked a handful of overtime hours over the course of tax season. How dare I take a day off? I felt bad, but genuinely driving would have been a risk with a migraine that bad. It was the only time I took off during the entire four months. 

That same coworker, is also super micromanaging me both inside and outside of tax season, and often dumps tasks they simply don't want to do on me, on top of my other tasks. It's not clear who my supervisor is, and what I'm allowed to say no to. They once told me I was on my phone too much, and to only use it during my ""legally mandated lunch and break times"" which no one else takes, and if you leave for lunch during the day they act like you're pretentious and not working hard enough. 

The partners seem to recognize that the job is not great, because we are lavished with gifts. I have never received so many gifts in such a short period of time from a job. Lunches bought, Christmas gift and bonus,  Admin day gifts, treats and happy hours and a big, big party at the end of tax season. In a way, they almost feel like bribes to put up with everyone's bad behavior. The other benefits are good, pay is pretty good for my area, PTO, health insurance, IRA matching, and (unpaid) half days on Fridays outside of tax season. I won't lie to you, my mental health LOVES half day Fridays. It \*almost\* makes up for dealing with the other parts. And outside of tax season, I can freely use my PTO and am encouraged to take vacations. 

Sometimes, I feel like I can keep doing this job - I can maybe deal with the crappy coworkers and their treatment of me which seemingly just changes from day to day. Some days we're having a great time, laughing and joking around and then other times they are reporting when I walk in and out of the door to the minute, and they ignore me as punishment after any perceived infraction. Even reporting me to one of the partners for leaving five minutes early, on the anniversary of my Dad's passing, after I had told them that I was really struggling that day. I'm also starting school again in the fall, and need my job to be able to be a little flexible with me for that, which when I was hired they made it seem like flexible hours (outside of tax season) was the norm, and no one would care. That has not been the case, at all. 

I don't need to be besties with my coworkers, but I do need to feel at the very least respected. So I'm turning to you, Reddit, partially to vent, and partially to know - would you stay at this job? Or would you look elsewhere? Am I a big baby - or is this the gray walled hell I've made it out to be in my mind?

I am nearly one year into TTC, which I know is not that long compared to many — got a PCOS diagnosis (lean PCOS, totally news to me) around December and have been doing monitored cycles ever since. I’ve only definitely ovulated once or twice,  and we were prepping for IUI this cycle.

The idea behind **Newsreadeck** is to bring you the most recent news from your favorite sources without any filters, regardless of the place or language, and without any extra effort. Additionally, you have the possibility to read articles without distractions; all unnecessary elements are removed so you can enjoy reading whatever you want.

The app is free, and you can use all the features without any ads. I added an in-app purchase option to extend the limits and continue improving the app.

I have to admit, I have never been more fascinated, astounded, and puzzled, all at the same time by resistance and differences I met. These are just observations, and I would love your respectful thoughts. I’ll list positive and negative. Feel free to respond as little or as much as you please. I consider it a bit of a social experiment. \^\_\^



Cutesy things…



1. My experience with dating a Georgian man was being told very direct intentions upfront. As soon as it was established that we liked one another, it was traditional acceleration from there. This honestly was such a refreshing attitude. I have big appreciation for it. (I'm Asian, we tend to be more indirect, beating around the bush, into guessing games, and more subtle showing of feelings. So what a relief this was, haha.)
2. Moms and family are a big deal. Possibly the most endearing thing I experienced. 
3. He was very sweet, more than I’m used to, in general dating, or even in my experience in my country (Philippines). Expressive and romantic, and lacking only stallion to complete the picture, haha. In contrast to my culture, though we are also sweet and friendly, openness of feelings, in vocal ways, is not as upfront as, say, acts of service. 
4. I learned Georgian too, and fell in love with the language! I noticed that the Georgian language, grammatically, tends to be very oriented with the subject spoken about. Like a nucleus to electrons, it was always a feeling of being made the entire world. And I’m sure this was not only in the romance, I felt this way too when speaking with his mom and meeting a few friends. I felt very considered. And it’s amazing. He expected the same consideration, it was rude to talk all at once and not to pay attention.
5. In the Philippines, we can sing on command. We love to sing, and we sing in perfect harmony as any random, spontaneous crowd, anywhere, any time. Georgians love to sing too. Our countries should be more acquainted, in my opinion.



Hot takes…



1. I met a really great backlash when I talked about having male friends. It was something that made me very angry, and I lost them all in the end in favor of the relationship. When I talked with a couple other folks, it surprised me that they had similar expectations. It made me understand that there was some kind of code. I don’t understand it fully. And later I would question it for double standards that he would see female friends, but I wasn’t allowed the same. But I’m genuinely curious what the thinking is here, and without judgement, sincerely want to know how Georgian men and women behave about friendships with the opposite sex. Is it generally discouraged?
2. I felt stigma about sex, casual sex especially as a woman. Another double standard here. I don’t understand the shame surrounding it. Feel free to enlighten me.
3. It is 2025, but I ended up discovering this partner was deeply against lgbt. In his words, “My mind can’t accept it.” Since he said it this way, I did not find it the right place to even encourage a debate, although I would have been relieved by a discussion. Perhaps some discussion is the point of my post. 
4. He also was against some spiritual things I was exploring like casually learning palm reading or the tarot. I don’t believe that we has a deeply religious person, he was not even a churchgoer. But his reactions showed that was deeply comfortable for him. I wonder what the superstitions and beliefs here still are. 
5. He told me lots of stories, and from the stories I gathered that courtship in Georgia, in general tend to be short and there is focus on marriage. I wonder how modern dating evolved then. They don’t even seem to be going out on dates. It's like you marry the one you are with or you don't.
6. Do people go to one another’s houses rather than meet somewhere, say, for a coffee? Every single time my ex mentioned meeting up with old friends or new friends, it happened at home or in the yard, haha. 
7. Are Georgians mistrusting in general? Are they self-preserving in a more exaggerated way? There was a feeling to my partner as if he was always bracing for an attack. I really don’t know if it’s because he’s a pessimist, or if it’s the disposition of the people.
8. Sadly, politics and religion were not encouraged topics between him and I, so I was not able to pry more.

In the interest of public safety and due to a major water project in the area, adjustments have been made to the SGI Business Association’s 4th of July Water Parade route this year. FCSO worked in conjunction with the SGI Business Association, SGI Volunteer Fire Department, and Commissioner Jones to come up with a safe and accessible alternative parade route. The Franklin County Sheriff’s Office number one priority is ensuring that emergency services can respond quickly and effectively while keeping bystanders safe.


We have highlighted some of the changes below and explained the “why” to help understand the needed changes:


⭐️ New parade route.
In the past, major roads and access points on the island were closed for the parade, which can affect EMS response times to critical emergencies. 


⭐️ Trailers and boats WILL be allowed. **newest update**
After Sheriff Smith and Commissioner Jones received input from locals, they have come to the conclusion that trailers and boats will be allowed this year. HOWEVER, the sheriff’s office is asking that those who are pulling the trailers and boats be extremely mindful of not stopping during the parade and continuing with the normal parade traffic. Last year, trailers and boats would stop in the parade which resulted in traffic jams and traffic hazards. 


⭐️ The SGI Business Association is still limiting the vehicles to 250. We have included some of the photos from last year’s parade to give everyone an idea of the number of people we will be expecting and the importance of these changes. 


We want everyone to have fun and enjoy the holiday, however, we will always voice our concerns about the public’s safety and what is best for first responders. Please understand it from this point of view: If your loved one needed help from first responders, you'd want them to have a clear path to reach them as quickly as possible.  Additional changes were made, however, these were the main ones we proposed.

Thank you for your understanding as we work to keep everyone safe.

It’s very disturbing.,"This is going to be a long one, but those of you who make it to the end will know that I’d be doing a disservice by leaving any of this out. This is one of the crazier things that’s happened in my life, so I suppose I’m looking for advice but I’m also just disturbed and can’t keep it to myself. I’ll try to be as concise as possible. I promise this isn’t just another low-brow “religion bad” post.

I know some of this will sound outlandish. If I weren’t living it I would think it was the plot of a South Park episode. Not because it’s funny, but because it’s so over the top that it’s bordering on parody at this point.

I have no problem at all with religious people or even the concept of religion if people find it fulfilling, but what I’m observing in my roommate has become something very different from typical Christianity. We’ve lived together for the past 18 months and still have eight months left on our lease. We’ve been friends for around six years. Before moving in together I knew he believed in God, read the Bible often and went to church on Sundays, but there was no indication that his beliefs would intensify the way they have over the past year and a half. He knows I don’t subscribe to any organized religion but has tried to recruit me in various ways.

Over time, he slowly started talking more about ways he thought God was communicating with him and would frequently tell me God was “telling him” things. I understand this can be considered a normal part of religion, but these would range from things like “God told me to sit in the front row at church today” to hyper-specific things like “I was walking past a woman on the street and God told me she needed help cleaning her pool. I walked up to her and asked her if she needed help.”

I initially dismissed this as him innocently becoming more excited about religion and felt bad for judging him. I found it strange, but smiled and nodded and accepted that I just don’t understand.

A few weeks after this became prevalent, I was sitting in my bedroom on a Saturday morning and heard weeping coming from his room. I was obviously concerned so I went and knocked on his door to make sure he was okay. He told me to come in and I found him at his desk, hunched over his Bible, crying as he was reading it because he said “the scripture shapes and impacts his life every day.” He has since told me that crying while reading his Bible has become a regular occurrence.

He’s also become much more invested in pushing religion on other people. For me, it started with gift giving. For Christmas he got me something small based on one of my interests, along with rosary beads, a Bible and prayer cards. He will probe often into whether I’ve read any of the Bible (I’ve skimmed some passages as it was a gift and I didn’t want to seem ungrateful). Again, I felt bad for finding this odd at the time since I know he has good intentions and he’s a friend I care about.

One day I was sitting in his room and noticed a packet of paper on his desk. I asked him what it was and started flipping through it. It was a detailed guide on how to approach strangers in public with the specific intention of guiding the conversation toward religion and trying to “spread the good word.” It followed some sort of process like “First, give the person a compliment so they feel comfortable and appreciated. Then, tell them they’re a child of God and ask if you can hold their hands and pray for them. If they decline, ask them why.” Yet again, I found this odd, pushy, and out of character for him, but dismissed my concerns as being too harsh.

_**Now, this is where I stopped dismissing my concerns.**_

When we first moved in, he celebrated by buying us a bottle of our favorite expensive liquor. He insisted it was a gift from him and for us to share and that I had free access to it. I don’t drink often, but was excited for us to enjoy it on the weekends. It sat in our freezer for a while untouched, and one Friday night I suggested that we break it out since we were just chilling at home. He told me that he took the bottle out of the freezer and threw it in the dumpster days ago. I thought he was joking and laughed, and then he told me he did it because God told him that he “had to make a decision about whether he’d rather serve Him or his earthly desires” and that “the choice was clear.” This crossed the line into full-blown delusion for me, but it gets worse.

He has a tech job in our city that he’s averagely-successful at. He came home from work one day wearing a suit, which is different from his usual attire. I asked him what the special occasion was and he told me that he left work early to drive an hour and a half in the opposite direction of where we live to interview for a new job where he’ll get to try and convert people to Christianity. He told me he would leave his tech job that provides him benefits like health insurance and his 401(k) in order to take a massive pay cut and work 20 hours a week in an office that brainstorms ways to convert people to Christianity. I’m unclear on how this is a paid position, but he claims it is. We’re obviously too old to be on anyone else’s health insurance at this point, so this seems extremely irresponsible and reckless to me.

The last straw was a few days ago when he brought people from his church over to our apartment for Bible study. It was a group of about eight of them. They were having a discussion in the living room while I was cooking myself dinner in the kitchen a few feet away. He’s had them over before and they’ve always been kind to me so I don’t mind, but as I was cooking I was listening to their conversation and it was extremely unsettling.

Some of his friends were talking about wanting to join a group of people that claim to have “holy visions” of random people in random areas and then actively go searching for those imagined people because they think God is telling them to find those people to pray for them. The example his one friend gave was that the group had a “shared holy vision” of a girl in a coffee shop with a pink water bottle who was wearing a white shirt and jeans. The group then searched coffee shops in our city to try and find the girl on the very day they imagined her so they could pray for her.

His friends tried to engage me in conversation while I was cooking by asking me what my plans for the night were. I told them I was binge watching all the Scream movies and that I’m a big horror movie fan. They told me that they detest horror movies because they “glorify death in a way that is not in line with scripture.” His one friend said that he liked the first Scream movie, but immediately after saying it became noticeably distressed and immediately backtracked and claimed he actually did not like the movie. It was like he believed God was in the room and listening to the conversation and he had to dispel it immediately or God would become angry at him. Again, disturbing to witness.

**The absolute cherry on top/where I draw the line** is that one of the members of his Bible study is clearly a gay man. I’m a bisexual man myself (not to my roommate’s knowledge, and he’ll never find out at this point) so I’m absolutely not judging his friend at all, I’m just being honest that it’s extremely obvious. One day my roommate told me unprompted that the friend in question “was gay before he opened himself up to the Holy Spirit.” I was understandably stunned that a man in his 20s would believe such a thing is even possible in today’s world, so I pushed back lightly by asking “do you believe that’s possible?” and he claimed that “God puts in your heart what you need.” My roommate then went on to say he viewed it as a positive that his friend’s story “can help people in the same situation.” What’s most unsettling is that his friend is 39 years old, has no current or former relationship with a woman and claims to be “enjoying the single life.” My roommate is unable to make the leap in logic that his friend is still gay and truly believes he was “healed.”

I’ve never told him about my sexuality because I don’t really care to (in the past I would have told him if he asked, I’m just more of a private person) but seeing that shift in him in particular made it apparent to me that I’ve completely lost him. He’s on the highway to religious extremism and has insulated himself in a community that reinforces everything I’ve described.

I’m in mourning over our friendship knowing that there’s likely no coming back from this. Even if he gave it all up tomorrow, he’s proven to be extremely susceptible to radical ideas in a way that makes me unable to truly trust him or his judgement again.",1,1747161889.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

-but ended up being waaay too long winded.

(tl,dr; It took me 7 years.)

My story so far:
7 yrs ago, I was put on several heart meds after a heart attack, and famotidine was on the list. (no explanation for it. I later assumed it was to minimize potentially confusing reflux with heart issues.)

Shortly after that, a friend had severe kidney issues from an entirely different PPI.   I was pretty sure I could differentiate heart burn from heart attack, was not experiencing GERD, so why take chances on messing up my kidneys too?

I discontinued the famotidine.

Around that time, I started having a dry cough in the morning, especially after bending over to feed the cat, tie shoes, etc. 

Dry cough was listed as a possible side effect of one of my meds, so I didn't think much of it. 

I would also randomly get hoarse if I tried to ""speak up"" in a noisy environment. It definitely got in my way, but I was getting used to the fact that remaining alive now had some additional overhead, and that this was probably a side effect an ACE inhibitor I was taking.

Fast forward a few years, and I gradually resumed most of the bad habits that got me in trouble in the first place. (Rest assured that I had perfectly believable rationalizations for doing so.)

There was some evidence that moderate coffee use might be cardio-protective, so I resumed coffee, just in case it was true.

Ditto for chocolate.

And alcohol.

Late at night, nothing settles my stomach after too much alcohol quite like a big, spicy, greasy serving of cholesterol, washed down with a can or two of club soda.

etc.

A few more years later, I was throwing up bile in the morning. I lived in a state where ""anti-nausea"" gummies were available. They seemed to help a little, but left me pretty much worthless for the rest of the day. They also led me to sleep very deeply, flat on my back instead of on my left side.

I started having trouble swallowing. Even a small bite of bread felt like a choking hazard. Not painful, just stuck.

To my credit, I did not try to start smoking tobacco, but otherwise, I think I did all of the other wrong things, and did them excessively. 

7 months ago, I lost my voice while ""singing"" along with The Who. I waited a few weeks, and it didn't get better, so I tried to set up a PCP. (I had moved, and my previous Dr. did not do telemedicine, especially out-of-state)

I sounded like grandpa Simpson, and my throat was sore after attempting to talk. People would ask me to speak up, and I just plain couldn't. It was frustrating enough that I gave up on even trying. ""Isolating"" doesn't begin to describe it.

7 months later, I finally got in to see my new PCP. He suspected reflux, gave me an rx for pantoprazole, and referred me to an ENT.  

I get to see the ENT in a couple of weeks.

I like the convenience features of the Jet, but unsure about its espresso quality. How much worse is the Jet compared to a traditional dual boiler machine at this price point when focused only on coffee quality?

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Watched a lot of reviews on the Oracle Jet. Most reviews seem to be focused on the ""semi-automatic"" aspect of the machine, and not so focused on the quality of the coffee compare to other popular espresso machines at this price point. Hence this post. Although not explicitly mentioned in many reviews, I am under the impression that Breville dual boiler still makes better coffee.

I am quite happy with the tech/convenience features of the Jet from what I've seen online, but in terms of pure espresso quality, how much worse (or is it worse?) is the coffee quality compare to the dual boiler? (Or other machines around the $2000 CAD price range?)

These 2 machines are priced not too far apart for me ($2400 CAD for the Jet vs. $1900 CAD for the dual boiler). If the coffee quality is similar, I might just spend the extra $ to get the convenience features.

Some context:

I will be upgrading from Bambino plus. (grinder is DF64). I do about half coffee/americano, and half milk drinks (usually only a bit of milk). The machine will be mostly operated by me, although I do find it a bit tedious to make coffee on my current set up.

I don't plan to upgrade my grinder anytime soon. And I will most likely use the built-in grinder only for decaf, or use it with lower-quality beans for ice-cream or baking, so built-in grinder quality is not very important to me. The convenience features, and the coffee quality itself are more important.

My neuro prescribed it after i complained of a lack of focus and general interest in my job and everyday activity  and because my mood was neutral at best, extremely sad at worst after a burn out for wich i had a sick leave of 6 weeks. I had bad experience with SSRI antidepressant prior to this (serotonin syndrom) so she sugestes this one. 

God ! This improved my quality of life so much ! 1st dose had me feel a little weird all day, as if i was in a cloud, but when i got home after work i had so much energy i danced and did every chores i was putting on the side from a long time (dishes, laundry, cleaning the floors, etc !) It was so good i was affraid i ended up in a mania episode, but no. It was the 1st time in MONTHS i was not feeling that heavy ball of sadness in my chest. I felt light and happy.

Following days were not as hyped, but still no sadness feeling, and enough energy to do my daily chores at home, even take walks after diner because why not ! On day 5 now, i realised even my focus at work is better. I can work on tasks for more than 10 mins at a time, and every tasks that i usualy did reluctantly is now done with as much ease as any other task. A job that could take 2 day prior is now done in 1 day, and my boss told me it felt like i was happier than ever.

It still gives me headaches, which are resolved with tylenol 
I had to slow down on coffee, because ot made me more nervous and i realised i was clenching my teeth really hard
I did not stop smoking weed and, in fact, it helped me calm down in the 1st days when i had so much energy i could explode. 

I am really hoping the effects won't wear off and that i'll be able to keep having this overall cheerfull mood and little boost of energy without having to increase the dose.

1kltnff,https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1kltnff/laser_surgery_for_hemorrhoids/,Laser surgery for hemorrhoids,"Hi, I'm 29 M and been dealing with hemorrhoids (also called piles in south east Asia) since last 7 years (age 22). The flare ups have been on and off. My symptoms were hard stools, blood in stools and occasional discomfort or pain. They used to come once in like 3-4 months and with proper diet and water intake used to go by on its own. But earlier this year in 2025 they started flaring up and the pain was pretty high for a week. I did my usual treatment of high fiber diet and lots of water intake. The pain became pretty less and bearable but the blood in stool didn't stop for more than 2 months. Trust me I tried everything. Went to the doctor, he prescribed Anusol oitmment. I applied it and no results. The 2nd time I went to the doc, he recommended 24 PROCTOL suppositories for 2 weeks, the 1st couple of days it worked and the blood seemed to stop, but then in the last 5 days of my dosage, the blood started again. My doctor recommended me to a surgeon, but the appointment seemed like forever to be scheduled (typical healthcare system in Canada). 
I live in Canada but I'm originally from Mumbai, India. So I booked the next flight to Mumbai and went to my family doctor the very next day. He did a proctoscopy and deduced I had 2 grade 3 hemorrhoids and also anal fissure which needed to be treated with surgery. I was shooked with the news that a surgery is required. I have relatives who've had hemorrhoids all their life and never required a surgery. I agreed to get the surgery done in the same week itself (thanks to fast healthcare system in India). Here's how the pre surgery, during surgery and post surgery went:

1 day before surgery you're only allowed to take liquids, no solid food and you're supposed to empty your stomach by inducing diarrhea. I was given some meds (don't remember the name) which causes diarrhoea. It's not a fun experience as you have to run between the toilets for at least 10 times in the day. 

The day of surgery you're allowed to just have a coffee or tea for breakfast 4 hours before the scheduled time of surgery. I was admitted in the hospital (for insurance claim purposes) 2 hours before surgery. They inject you with IV and everything. 15 - 20 mins before the surgery they give you spinal anesthesia so that anything Below waist goes numb and you don't feel a thing. I asked the doctor to give me an injection so that I dose off and don't hear or see anything during the surgery. The laser surgery went on for 1.5 hours and you don't feel a thing. It's pretty smooth without any pain. 

After the surgery I was still under meds and was sleeping on and off. The anesthisa takes at least 2 - 4 hours to wear off. Ideally in laser surgery, post the surgery, they wait you to pass urine and if there's no pain then they discharge you and you can go home the same day. But I had to spend the night in hospital because of insurance.

I passed my 1st urine like 5 hours post the surgery and it wasn't painful at all. In fact doctor recommended to start proper dinner as well. But I just had soup and khichdi (lentil and rice). Pain level the night of surgery was around 3/10. I felt like going to toilet multiple times but nothing came out. I couldn't sleep the whole night worrying about the 1st bowel movement and also perhaps because I slept a lot during and after the surgery!

The next morning, I had a bit of solids and liquids in my breakfast. The doc came in for a follow up and said everything looks good.  Prescribed a hell lot of meds and sitz bath and also recommended to discharge. Pain level is still 3/10.

I had my regular lunch maybe more liquids than solids. That evening I had my first bowel movement post surgery and alas it wasn't that bad. I imagined it would be very painful but the pain level was tolerable like 4/10. After boweel movement I felt a burning sensation which stays for sometime but it isn't as bad as I expected

Day 2 post surgery was same as day 1. Stools were soft because of stool softeners and meds prescribed. Pain level 4/10

Day 3 is same as day 2. Pain level 4/10.

Day 4 was the day I was terrified of. My 1st bowel movement this day was hell. It was like passing glass through my anus. It was paining and burning a lot but only during bowel movement. Post toilet, the pain was soothing off. Also due to warm sitz bath. Pain level 7/10

Day 5 - 10 were surprisingly better than day 4. Regular bowel movements (3 or 4 times a day because of meds). There's a burning sensation after pooping but only lasts for a couple of minutes (sitz baths post pooping helps a lot). I can walk and sit comfortably. Pain 4/10. 

Day 11 - 13 : this is when I started to fell like the old me. Pain 2/10

Day 14 - now: it doesn't even feel like I had something wrong in my anus. Feels like normal, no pain during and after bowel movements. I'm having regular and healthy bowel movements. Never felt better. 

Note - you might see some blood in stools post surgery and that's normal as advised by the doctor. 

I'm glad I did the laser surgery and would 100% recommend everyone to do it. ",4,1747161361.0,hemorrhoid,0,1.0,False
1kltnak,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kltnak,Biggest loser of 2025,"Hi all,

M/32. Even though personal sub stories are not allowed in this sub, I see bunch here everyday, so why not create one more. Hopefully this can be pinned to top of the sub, so the others don’t make the same mistake.

Today is one of the worst days in my life, because all of the 2025 losses were recovered in the market but it wasn’t the case for me. But I would like to congratulate everyone who recovered from this  crash before my sob story.

I always thought that the stock market was risky and was making an honest living by staying out of it, but that changed this year. We have a family friend who works at one of the Mag7, and she told all of my family members to invest in AI stocks right before the crash. I advised all of my family not to do it because all of the AI stocks were at all-time highs, but some family members didn’t listen.

They were first hit by the DeepSeek news that was a big hit for my family and I thought stocks would only go up from there. I believed I had bought the bottom, so I could give some of the profits to my family. My problem was that I was trying to recover for them really quickly, get them out of this mess, and be done with the stock market. The first mistake I made was getting into the market during one of the AI stock’s earnings weeks and investing in options. Even though that stock had a really good earnings report, they killed all of the options during after-hours price action, so I first lost $17k. I discussed this with my wife, and she was totally supportive because this $17k was something we could afford to lose at that time. But I promised her that I wouldn’t bet like this again and that I would discuss it with her if I was going to invest again.

You guessed it right… I didn’t keep my promise and got in the hole even deeper. I made a bunch of stupid mistakes, getting scalped while trying to scalp, etc. I lost another $25k in our joint account. Then I couldn’t risk our joint account again, so I thought, “Oh, I have this money in my IRA account. I can double it, withdraw early, pay the penalty, and nobody will ever know.” And you guessed it right again… I lost all of that IRA account as well.

Three weeks ago, my wife found out that I had been lying to her, betting behind her back, and losing all of this money. She lost all her trust in me. She was sad about the money, but losing trust hurt her more which I regret the most. I’m glad she didn’t leave me, but she wanted to control all of our money, which I immediately accepted, and I sold every stocks and transferred the rest to her personal account. Then the market bounced back, but I cannot blame her, as nobody knew if it was going to crash or skyrocket past 3 weeks. But my addicted mind couldn’t handle not having money in the market while it was recovering and seeing everyone recover.

I accepted my addiction immediately which is why I always stayed out of the stock market because of I knew about my addictive mindset. However I was in it and lying to my significant other. Me and my wife are on a long road ahead and working together but some days are really hard for me especially today. I am also working on myself. I am an engineer trying to find a job right now which is really tough on me right now as well with all of the layoffs.

So long story short, don’t lie to your significant other. I never told my family about this and I don’t think I will ever.

Also today I just heard from my family that they have recovered their losses and exited because they have never sold. Now I am the one with losses which I am happy for them because I am young and come back from here.

PS. The money was initially in Robinhood because of the APY deal of uninvested money and the IRA account was in Robinhood because of their match. I was just using the Robinhood debit card.

Anyways if you want to buy me a coffee with your recovered money you are more than welcome to. My wife controls all of the accounts, so she will be surprised to see if any money coming in as I am unemployed right now. 🥲

One day around a week ago I went outside on my lunch break and was approached by this guy and he asked me if we could go on an impromptu coffee date during our break. We ended up getting coffee and chatting for about 15 minutes, then we exchanged numbers and it was left at that. A day later he texts me asking to go to a movie, I don't like movie dates especially as a first official date so I responded in a nice way suggesting maybe we do something else. He clearly took offense to this as he sent a pretty rude reply so I ultimately decided at that point that I wouldn't be reaching out to him again. Though, yesterday afternoon he sends me a text saying he got tickets to the Knicks game for that night, it sounded like a fun idea so l agreed. We set up an exact place and time to meet. I show up on time, send a text, no response. I wait a few minutes send another text... no reply... wait a few more minutes and give him a call... goes straight to voicemail. I knew when he didn't answer the first text that l was getting stood up but wanted to have some hope, as we had a
""meet cute"" and he was the one pursuing me from the beginning, i honestly wasn't very attracted to him but his confidence drew me in. I'm not sad, more just weirded out. He set up a young woman to stand outside of a stadium by herself... it's almost creepy. Still even a day later he has said absolutely nothing, it's like he fell off the earth.

1kltgzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/1kltgzx/when_i_moved_out_of_my_parents_house_my_mom/,"When I moved out of my parents house, my mom finally quit trying to make me stay but told me I can’t ever move back home","My boyfriend 19 m and I 19 f were friends when we were younger, we met in church and instantly clicked. We befriended each other quickly and immediately grew a bond I never thought would be as strong as it is to this day. We started off as only seeing each other on Sunday’s, then we became Facebook friends at the ripe age of 8. We started talking and learning more about each other. 

I quickly developed feelings for him without realizing that he felt the same way. One day I got bold and told him after he asked me if I liked him that I had been waiting for this and that even though we were in 5th grade, we could make it work if he wanted the same. 

That night my mom took my tablet after I had fallen asleep and she went through it to make sure I was being responsible as any parent should. But when she saw our messages she wasn’t happy for us, instead she told him that I don’t like him and he’s not my friend and that he was never gonna be my type. 

I never got my tablet back. I never tried reaching out again because I forgot about it because it had been so long and because I forgot the stuff to my Facebook. Fast forward to March 2024 and I am going to my best friend (at the times) house and he had been brought up on the way there, she had mentioned that he was gonna be there. As I got excited, mind you, I didn’t know why but I couldn’t stop smiling and thinking about him. We get there and when I see him I get shy and freeze when he’s around me. 

My nerves are shot and no amount of alcohol was making it easier. Every sip made my breath more shortened and he kept getting closer with every minute that passed. It took us like an hour to say anything to each other but when we started talking, it felt like we were the only ones there. We brought up old inside jokes only we knew and talked about our families. Basic catching up. But after our conversation I had an epiphany, I had fallen for him and I couldn’t control it. I went to my best friend and told her, thinking she’d be supportive and happy I went to her in a time of need when I needed her and her advice. 

As I told her, she kept giving me a disgusted look and then when I was done telling her she made out to be a whore, she said “why is it every time i introduce you to someone you end up getting with them” there was only one person that happened with and he hurt me. But I knew he was different so I pushed her comment aside and went back to enjoying my night. A few weeks later I’m still thinking about him so I look him up on Snapchat not thinking anything of it, I find him and add him, we start as friends and catching up, things like that. 

Then we confessed our feelings for each other the next day and we started talking. I told him I loved him on the third day, we started dating on day 6. Now here’s the plot twist, I was 18 living with my parents, I had to put my phone up at 10 pm sharp and I couldn’t have social media or pay for my phone until April of 24. 

So I had to sneak around for a month of late night calls and endless gazes of getting lost into each other’s eyes. One night I fell asleep on accident and my mom came in to collect my phone and saw we were on the phone so she took it away and grounded me. The next morning I woke up a little later than normal, I woke up and went to get to the bathroom, my dads drinking his coffee on the couch before he takes me to school and my moms showering, she gets out of the shower as I’m mid pee. She rolls her eyes and is giving me the stink eye the whole time I’m in there, I break the silence and ask how her mornings been, knowing I’m fucked. Surprisingly she didn’t say anything about it she just said good, make sure you’re ready to go with dad you have to leave soon. Do my day went on, no phone, only anxiety filling my body. That night after I got home from work my sister and her boyfriend came over for dinner. 

I thought it was strange because they didn’t come over much and this was the third night that week they were there. As were done praying for dinner, my mom and is are kind of awkward so she just decides to do it then. Who’s daddy? I blush and laugh uncontrollably and try to get myself together. After I calm down from laughing and crying, I tell her hey it’s a kid from church I’ve known him and we’re dating. My dad got a big smile on his face even though he was pissed cause I went against the rules, but he always liked my bf. 

Anyways my mom just gave me a gross look and said ew, mind you we were always on the phone and he heard a lot of shit my mom and I would fight about, I never got the chance to fight for myself cause I’d get guilt tripped or made out to be the problem and she’s the victim. He had enough and talked to his parents and they agreed to let me come live with them if I ever needed a place to go to escape my mom. 

We were talking about it for two weeks, at the end of the first week I told my parents I wanna move out, mom said “no you don’t, you don’t know anything about adulting or life itself”  and I just blew up and ran to my room, I had packed two duffel bags and made sure my bf knew I was getting ready to leave the house and come live with him. As the next week rolls by all my mom does is create issues where they aren’t needed and I’ve had enough. So my bf tried to get our bsf at the time to go to a hotel and swim it off. My mom said no cause she knows we’d share a room and our friends would sleep in a room together. 

But I promised we’d just go to her house and he’d leave at the end of the night. I had taken my two bags with me and waited for my friend to get me. After I convinced my mom to let me go I told my friend I could come over so she came and got me, we got there and she keeps me from my boyfriend for over two hours, she keeps telling me stuff and taking me away from him so stop that and go see him. Mind you this is my fourth time seeing him in person since we’ve been dating, so I get hammered and I’m the only one who’s completely obliterated. He’s here for me cause he knows what happened cause he was otp with me. So I tell him drunkenly I’m moving in with him I’m coming home. 

He tells me to recap it in the morning because I’m too drunk to be serious, all o said was drunk words are sober thoughts. The next day after 5 hours of thinking and making pros and con lists of moving out and staying home, I quit my job and made a game plan. My boyfriend and I went to my parent’s house when it was just my dad. My Mom loves talking for him so we wanted an opportunity to hear his side of things. When I get there we sit him down and I take control of the conversation, “I’m sorry to be doing it like this but when I tried talking to mom I got shut down, but I’m moving in with him, I know I don’t know everything about life but I’m an adult being treated like a child and I’m all done with it, I’m moving out and there’s nothing you can do.” 

There were tears rolling down our faces, my dad calls my mom and tells her to come home, I tell her too and then she goes off. My mom tells me I’m ungrateful and inconsiderate, toxic, horrible, stupid, worthless, and worst of all she called me no child of hers. I knew then that my decision was the best one for myself. 

I’m balling my eyes out and my boyfriend and I go to my room with trash bags and nothing but anger and frustration (at my mom). As we packed up the rest of my stuff for that night, I went to put the last of my stuff in the truck and when I came back to say my goodbyes, my mom told me I was never allowed back in her house of anything happens and if I ever needed a place to stay it was out the window because I had “betrayed” her. 

But her years of betrayals and how they affected didn’t matter not then or ever. 

Fast forward to now, my mom and I have a better relationship than before, it’s not the best but it’s improving little by little. She told me that she only said she’d kick me out because she was mad and a lot was happening in her brain at the time. I vividly once in a while but I’m still not coming around as much as she’d like.

She pressures me to move back in a lot, and it’s been over a year. I set boundaries with that and my money (she loves putting her opinion in on how I spend my money as an adult). She’s really come around to my boyfriend and has been inviting us over more. But I still haven’t forgotten how bad o was treated all my life until I moved out.

Me (F19) and my boyfriend (M19) started talking in April 2024, which was really good until around May where we stopped talking for a few weeks because we were both busy and had exams and knew we were both talking to other people, though he told me he wasn’t. 

We started talking again in which I said to him from the get go that I wasn’t meeting with him until after my exams, come that time and I hadn’t asked as I’d never really done anything like this, I’ve always met my S/O’s in person in school/college. He eventually said are we ever gonna go on a date, I agreed and we met up in June just before he went on holiday with his friends, it was a mostly ok day, both hungover so ended up walking around a lot and eating food. He took a photo of me in an art gallery, which he posted on his instagram story. I’d seen something similar previously in his old highlights of his ex girlfriend at the same picture in the same art gallery (from a year before) but didn’t mention it at the time as we’d literally just met it’d be insane to be worried. 

Anyway, we had to go back to texting for a couple weeks whilst he was away, whilst he was away he called me most nights and was (as it was a “lads” holiday) drunk a lot so not sure if it was the drinks talking but he started saying he loved me etc. Skip to the next week and we met again, went shopping and for food then he invited me to his house to make some lego and watch a movie. His dad was home so had to meet him which was a lot! Anyway you can imagine what we did end up doing, which may have been a little fast for us but oh well. Not a red flag for me at all. But after that he started saying he loved me every night etc, which obviously was too early for me personally, we hardly knew each other really. So was a bit concerned i suppose.

Everything’s mostly ok until about august 20th so the back end of summer, he would make alot of jokes about my weight and my face blah blah. I’d make sometimes some similar jokes like, for example, he shaved his head and i told him his head was a bit lopsided so whilst what he did was a red flag i was a bit disrespectful too so i suppose this could be red flags from both though we were fine with it for the most part and both knew we were joking. Around the end of august though, it started feeling more malicious and i felt a bit weirded out by things, he told me he had about 5 stories of girls at the art gallery so we looked through his instagram highlights and he shows me a couple but we got to his ex and there were a lot of posts of her so i felt a bit insecure of her as we look VERY similar and both of south east asian descent, dressed similar, music taste etc. That was a massive red flag, then furthermore he had all of his pictures of her and then in his hidden album on his phone. Obviously i was annoyed then he said he went through my phone and saw a few photos of my ex still in my camera roll and i apologised and explained i had about 16,000 photos at the time and just don’t look through them and needed to clear them and would do (which i did do immediately). I didn’t end up like having a talk with him about why it’s weird he purposely put them in his hidden album and still had them (over 1000 photos btw). 

Around September 10th, I could sense something was off, and the relationship became weird. My cat died on the 1st, and i posted a picture of her on my instagram which was viewed by his ex girlfriend and i thought that was VERY strange. That night me and my bf called for hours till about 6am i was very distraught however he was silent, like dead silent texting someone and i could hear the typing sounds. So im guessing it was his ex. 

September 20th i was at his, we did the deed and halfway through he got pissed off at me for doing something wrong and hurting him, which resulted in him shouting a bit and pushing me off saying go home - which made me sob my eyes out, and in defence i just hid in the corner of my room, he said “go home you’re crying too loud”. Keep in mind i lived over an hour away, had no car and it was 1am so no trains were running.

After this, Sep 25th i ended things over text. Though, maybe this is a bad sign from myself, i didn’t really want to, it had been great before all of this, we really clicked as people. The breakup was quite turbulent with me refusing to talk to him (context we had booked a holiday to paris however we ended so obviously didn’t go, bit of a waste of money but ah well), so i would speak to his friend instead explaining how i’d post al of his stuff to him etc. 

After that, the following weeks were worse, his friends would send me pics of my ex on nights out with girls, so in retaliation i got my friend to pose in a pic with me, which pissed him off. He was blocked on everything, so he emailed me saying call me, i obviously didn’t and being a bit childish i posted it on my close friends story which his friends saw and ended up having an argument with one of them and my ex as they were together. 

Both of us acted quite immaturely though i quickly forgot about it all. During this break up i never got confirmation of him talking to his ex, so (maybe wrong thing to do) took it upon myself to text her as i knew her instagram. I asked about it and she told me she texted him and they were talking on and off over august, she said she asked about me and he said i wasn’t his girlfriend though i was. Then said he said to her we ended over something we didn’t end over, she didn’t mention that they had met up or anything and most of the talking has been whilst me and him have been broken up. 

He texted me about getting my stuff back in the middle of october, and i happened to be in his city the weekend he asked me to send stuff over and everything coincided with train times. So i met up with him and gave him his stuff, it was quite awful and awkward we didn’t talk about anything that happened at all. Then texted over that night a lot. The next day, I was due in a different city about 3 hours away by train, and he was also going nearby coincidentally so we met up before the trains, spoke etc for hours and ended up kissing. 

After that we kept meeting up and tbh it was great, we ended up back together in December officially, and since then everything was mostly perfect with a few arguments about his ex but he explained his side too and idk i’m one to always give the benefit of the doubt to people. I asked him if they had actually met up and he said yes that they went for coffee. A few weeks later, i asked if i could wear his favourite shirt and he said “urm my ex has it” and i said why? he said “when we met for coffee i spilt coffee on it and gave it to her to wash but never gonna get that back haha” and for some reason i didn’t think much of it.

We were fine until recently, when he told me he actually met up with her twice and they had s*x one time. Then told me that she kept begging him to go over to her accomodation etc, and then that she talked shit about him after they did everything and then ended everything quickly because he was using her to get over me. Which obviously isn’t really anything to do with me, we were broken up. What does bother me is the lying. Furthermore, we talked about it a bit we’ve had a lot of arguments but i’m just questioning if i should even be with him. 

Recently he’s been the best, we’ve had such a. good relationship recently and it seems like he loves me though there’s still issues, like he’s very selfish and snobby, comes from a well off background and says things like ‘my mums accent is poor’ and ‘wouldn’t date you if you sounded poor or were poor’. He got a car recently too and we’ve spent so much of our limited time together cleaning it and when he asks me to grab things he says “get this” or “hurry up” and sfuff like “you have legs hurry up” then if i’m not fast enough he just shouts  sit down don’t do anything i’ll do it myself as per usual etc. Aays the same stuff to his parents too. 

I feel a bit obliged to stay with him as we got back together and i LOVE his mum and dad i adore them. i love him a lot, we get along so well, he’s my best friend. I’m just not sure what to do. He speaks horribly to me sometimes and we don’t agree with a lot of political stuff he’s very right wing i’m VERY left wing. He still calls things gay etc, he’s just immature and i keep defending it by saying his friends are like that so it rubs off on him but idk. i know we’re not gonna get married we’re 19, though he really expects it. Also im of southeast asian descent and he’s very against a southeast asian wedding or me keeping my last name. it’s very strange. But aside from the point, i’ve gone into this knowing we won’t last  or at least hoping we won’t and i think maybe im being selfish, i do love him i like it but i don’t know i don’t see this lasting it’s more like nice fun with someone who might be right for me but isnt due to political opinions and stuff ?

I’ve obviously not included every single argument but we have a lot of arguments where he thinks im going to cheat when i go on a night out etc. personally think it’s a reflection of what he did but im not sure. Furthermore, he also calls a lot of my friends the F slur, which i have shouted at and argued with him a lot and he’s stopped now. But just looking for opinions tbh. 

Looking for advice and opinions on what to do!

There was this one girl I met last year. We chatted for a bit and I asked her out to coffee just to get to know her. She told me she was taking it easy after getting out of a relationship and isn't looking to date. I don't know how true that is or if that's her way of telling me she's not interested. I also didn't think we were compatible either. She was nice but I didn't feel any chemistry so I decided I would stop pursuing and treat her as a friend. Let's call her Allison for disambiguation purposes. Long story short I stopped talking to her for a while cause I was pursuing someone else. Let's call her El (that lead also blew up in my face but that's another story for another time) and Allison knew about us because we attend the same events. I would still hit her up every now and then just to touch base. After things fell off with El I've noticed the two have become friends. Last time I talked with Allison was in December and the vibes were immaculate. It was like nothing ever changed, but since then she's gone cold. It's bad and other people have noticed. I waved at her and said hello and she curtly smiled before walking away from me as quickly as possible. 

A friend I was with noticed and said ""damn what did you do to her?"" Tbh Idfk but I shrugged it off. I tried to reinitiate contact again but like before she walked away from me. It broke me for some reason. I felt embarrassed for just trying to be her friend. I know I should have dropped it but I couldn't. We weren't even that close but she knew so much about my personal life. I was an idiot for being as open with her as I was. I texted her to ask her how she's been and she left me on read. I didn't want to bombard her with texts so I asked another friend to mediate. I told him if it sounds like a dumb idea then tell me and I won't ask again, but he insisted that it was a great idea and that he would do everything in his power to help. Well that never happened. About a month passed and I hit her up again just to be honest about what I noticed with her getting distant. Admitting that's why I messaged her in the first place and she said she was just busy. Seriously? Wtf Allison? I didn't respond with that of course, but still I have no idea what to do with that information. Is she telling the truth? Is the friction between us all in my head? I don't know but it makes me feel like I'm going insane just thinking about it. I know the right thing is to ignore it, drop all ties, and move on with my life but it's not that simple. I didn't write this post for advice either. 

I wrote it because no one seems to get how maddening this experience is until it happens to you. Everyone I've talked to about it thinks I'm insane and that it's no big deal. While it's true it's no big deal the psychological fuckery that comes with being shunned is incomperable to anything I've ever felt before.

Non-smoker, very light drinker.  I brush in the morning then rinse with antiseptic Listerine Clinical Gum Health.  At night-- Waterpik, manual floss, brush w/ Arm & Hammer, rinse w/ same mouthwash.  I haven't missed a day of that routine in many years.

I got my teeth cleaned in February and the hygienist measured periodontal pockets, some 5-6mm.  Previously my pockets were 1-3.  She said I had great hygiene so we couldn't figure it out.  I later read about the link between inflammatory conditions and periodontitis.  Body fights the inflammation, healthy gum tissue gets caught in the crossfire and separates from the tooth.  I dealt with an ongoing, yet undiagnosed bout of digestive inflammation (colitis, mild IBS symptoms) from December until April.  It has resolved.  But putting 2 and 2 together, it sounds like a viable explanation.  The hygienist did say the x-rays show some bone loss.

Aside from the imaging/charting, I have no typical symptoms of periodontitis.  No red gums, no bleeding, no bad breath, no puffy gums, no pain, no loose teeth.  Only severely stained teeth due to coffee.  I scheduled another cleaning for today, May 13, thinking it would be a routine cleaning.  I go in and the hygienist says that the doctor, who still hasn't examined me (only the x-rays/periodontal charting numbers) diagnosed periodontal disease and the \*only\* thing they are willing to do is a deep cleaning.  I'm guessing that involves scaling and root planing.  Obviously the cost was going to be a lot higher than expected, so I didn't jump into doing it today.

They're calling this periodontal disease based on the imaging/charting, but it's clearly not caused by bad hygiene.  Is it a sure thing that bacteria are built up in the pockets and actively making things worse?  Absent all typical visible signs of periodontitis, do I need a deep cleaning even if the pockets may be caused by inflammation elsewhere in the body?  I assume when pockets are that deep, 90% of the time, ""floss more"" is the correct advice for the patient.  But my situation is different.

On top of my resolved digestive inflammation, I currently have some lower/mid-back inflammation that I'm going to see a chiropractor, then my doctor about in the next week.  This popped up about a month ago and has persisted.  Now it has me wondering whether it's exacerbating my periodontitis or maybe the other way around.",1,1747160569.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

A little about me: I’m left leaning/liberal, spend my weekends watching old films (American Cinematheque member!), big into vintage/midcentury everything, love grabbing coffee, wine or gin and just conversing, or exploring local historic spaces or museums. ",5,1747160095.0,armenian,1,1.0,False
