( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qkpd5x,https://i.redd.it/66kfwoogd3fg1.jpeg,"Do you prefer fully custom brand visuals, or stock / AI imagery everyone else is using?","I’m genuinely curious where people land on this, especially small business owners 🫧

I work in marketing and design, and for a long time I relied, and still occasionally do, on stock imagery too, Canva, Freepik, the usual places. It’s fast, affordable, and often really well shot.

A moment that shifted my thinking was when I was working for a coffee business, creating digital menus and printed marketing materials. Coffee is a pretty universal visual language, so stock made sense at first. But a few months in, I started noticing the same images appearing again and again, not just across different sites within the same business, but across completely different independent cafés and restaurants.

**One specific photo of coffee beans in particular seemed to be everywhere.** *(The Image* 👆*)*

It’s a beautiful image (which is why it gets used), but it made me realise how quickly brands can blur together through repetition and pattern recognition. When customers see the same visuals over and over, it becomes harder to remember who is who, right? 

Since then, I’ve been thinking a lot about the trade-off between, investing in custom visuals (photography, illustration, bespoke graphics), and using stock or AI-generated imagery because it’s quicker and cheaper

**So I’m curious:**

\- As a business owner, would you rather invest in visuals that are uniquely yours, or stick with stock/AI because it’s “good enough”?

\- Does originality actually matter to you, or is speed/cost the deciding factor?

\- Have you ever noticed competitors using the exact same images as you?

1qkp9wq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWideContent/comments/1qkp9wq/vpn_for_online_banking_safe_transactions_extra/,"VPN for Online Banking: Safe Transactions, Extra Privacy, and Smart Security Tips","Online banking has become a daily part of our lives—quick, convenient, and available 24/7. But with that ease comes serious responsibility: protecting your sensitive financial data. That’s where a VPN (Virtual Private Network) becomes your digital best friend. It’s not just about hiding your IP anymore—it’s about smart, proactive online security.

Here’s how a VPN can help keep your online banking safe, private, and stress-free:

# 🔒 1. Safe Transactions, Even on Public Wi-Fi

Public Wi-Fi is a hacker’s paradise. Coffee shops, airports, hotels—these networks are rarely secure. When you connect to online banking through one, you're essentially shouting your data across the room. A VPN encrypts your connection, turning that open book into a locked vault. Even if someone tries to snoop, all they’ll see is scrambled, unreadable information.

# 🕵️ 2. Extra Privacy from Unwanted Eyes

Banks take security seriously, but what about your own network or ISP? Your internet provider can see the sites you visit—and depending on where you live, they might even sell that data. With a VPN, you mask your IP and online activity. No more breadcrumbs left behind. It’s like doing your banking behind a curtain that only you can see through.

# 🧠 3. Smart Security Tips While Using a VPN for Banking

Using a VPN is just step one. Combine it with a few smart habits for maximum protection:

* **Always use official banking apps** or websites—bookmark them instead of clicking links in emails.
* **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)**—an extra layer of security that makes hacking much harder.
* **Keep your device updated**—outdated software can have security holes.
* **Disconnect the VPN after banking**—use it when needed, but don’t leave it on unnecessarily.
* **Avoid auto-connect features**—connect manually so you're always in control.

# 🧘‍♂️ Peace of Mind Comes Standard

When you use a VPN for online banking, you're not just protecting numbers on a screen. You’re protecting your savings, your identity, and your peace of mind. Think of it as locking your front door—not because you expect danger, but because it’s smart.

In a world where digital threats are always evolving, adding a VPN to your online banking routine is a simple, effective way to stay one step ahead.",1,1769170650.0,TheWideContent,0,1.0,False

I'm pregnant, so I try to start early so I don't get worn out, since I live in a big house. When he arrived, we were fine, we talked and went down to the kitchen.

I was in my nightgown and I made a suggestive joke to him, saying that the dress should be a little shorter, that it was too formal and big.

He turned around and said that I was acting like a slut, with the words of a tramp. That I was trying to act like a spoiled teenager, provoking jealousy in him, and that I was already an adult and old and should put myself in my place (I'm 24 years old). He also said that I should reconsider my attitudes and become a true Christian before saying these things and being conservative. That if I continued like this he would leave me without caring about anything.

I was shocked by this behavior, because he had never insulted me in this way before.

1qkp4x8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItEndsWithLawsuits/comments/1qkp4x8/people_shouldnt_compare_working_in_film_to/,People shouldn’t compare working in film to working in an office,"The biggest misconceptions I see come from people who don’t work in the film industry and compare their office job to being on set.

When you are working on a film with themes of DV, sex, growing up and trauma it is absolutely normal to have conversations about those things. You will be discussing how characters process trauma or sex and how best to portray that. So discussing personal experience is also normal. You cannot spend 14 hour days together for months/years writing and creating such a project and not talk about it. You cannot act in serious projects and not discuss the acting with the director. His job is literally to direct you and tell you how your character is feeling. 

When filming an improv dance scene you will be dancing. Touching someone’s back, arms or nuzzling is part of dancing. I have never seen an intimacy coordinator come to set for a scene with fully dressed non sexual dancing. That’s beside the point cause we know Lively declined to meet the intimacy coordinator. If Lively cannot do a simple dancing scene professionally she definitely should not have been doing a romantic movie at all. And those actors exist. Some actors really don’t want to play romance of any kind and they don’t take on those roles. Lively however only takes on romantic roles and a slow mo non sexual dance scene should not have been an issue. 

It is normal for a director to comment on what a character is wearing. That’s part of his job literally. Actors are sentient furniture on set. That’s all they are. What they look like and how they fit into an ensemble and scene is sometimes more important than their acting ability. So when a director says take off your jacket we are all wearing onesies in this scene - you take off your jacket. If a director says yeah that outfit is sexy or hot that means that is what is needed for the character in that moment. The director has a vision for the scene. The actress needs to look a certain way. Blake is fully aware of that. You don’t get to be a lead and not know you are furniture that needs to fit into a scene. She herself was calling her outfits sexy and pointing out why something looks better on her character.

When filming a birthing scene I do not believe for a second she wasn’t allowed a blanket. Sets are fucking freezing usually. If an actor has to undress in any way there are blankets. In the released footage we see she is fully covered above the waist and I clearly see black briefs. In between takes she would have either put her legs together or would be given a blanket if she was chilly. Each actor has a PA attached to them ready to bring them coffee and a blanket or jacket in between takes.

On some sets people hug. On some they don’t. It’s not industry standard but it’s common. As I said working hours are crazy. 12-14 hours days for months or years. Cast and crew get close. You see them more than your family sometimes. Plus people like to work with the same people. So hugs are not weird. I’ve been on some sets where people hug a lot, I’ve been on some sets where people only hug when they wrap the project. I’ve was on a set where the director knew every single person and shook their hand every day. Literally knew the names of every single lighting technician. And I was once on a set where the director only spoke to the DOP, the 1 AD and the lead and no one else. Literally no one else. Other actors or crew only dealt with the 1AD. As you can imagine the latter is not a nice guy to work with. People want to work on a set where everyone is friendly and nice. 

The only instance I could classify as harassment is Heath walking into Lively’s trailer when she was naked. However we have three different stories on what happened there and Lively is a proven liar (in email, text and under oath) so I’m leaning towards that being an awkward situation and that’s it. It happens. One time does not qualify as harassment if it was a miscommunication and he apologised. People walk in on each other, apologise and move on. On indie productions or modelling shows everyone is changing in one place. No one cares.

We see Blake supporters who have regular jobs who are appalled by this behaviour. I have yet to see film people say that anything Baldoni did is out of ordinary. Cause it’s not. It’s not even a grey area. It’s black and white. He didn’t do anything bad.",13,1769170232.0,ItEndsWithLawsuits,2,0.88,False
1qkp4uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1qkp4uk/cut_contact_after_17_years_rantvent/,Cut contact after 17 years (Rant/vent),"I knew that when I got older I was going to need to make a decision. I finally did it. I'm just glad I did. I don't know what is in store for me, know that these things are possible, you're not overreacting. If you want to cut contact, let no one stop you. 

  
This rant/vent is all over the place but it feels good to talk about it. A little ((\*\*)) in the text is a little indicator to when I thought something was definitely off but I didn't know how to put a word to it since I was uneducated about mental health until a few years recently. 

  
I(31f) was in an enmeshed relationship with my mother since she never remarried after the divorce when I was 3. Her mental health followed gravity, unfortunately Bipolar behavior is frowned upon even when she was medicated. Her luck with jobs was terrible, she was lucky to stay ((\*6 months\*)) due to her behavior. Family didn't do much either, until her sister moved us to another state where I've been for over 20 years. Turns out that 'Aunt' was my birthmother and 'mom' was my aunt. They had a feud that all the family knew about before I did that made them all uncomfortable. ((\* No wonder things got quiet and extremely tense when I would walk into the room. \*)) 

Mom moved out of state recently last year as a desperate decision, she has been living with her other sister who is an alcoholic and not even 6 months in she wants to come back. I've remained neutral at giving an answer aside from ""it's up to you."" Even in our last phone conversations she kept saying the same quote, ""I want to be somewhere someone wants me"". I told her, ((\*""You have to want yourself first."" \*))

I have told her, even begged to her that in order for our relationship to do better that I would love to see her go to therapy. She's gone through therapy before, idk for how long but it was before I was born. She always gave the excuse ""I already went to therapy; I don't want to go back to my childhood and ((\*talk about it\*)) anymore."" She never even accepted the idea once but was glad when I started going to therapy 5 years ago and got on medication. Sometimes she would ask if I talked about her at therapy. She also used to give people dirty looks/comments in public for being overweight. ((\**She* is overweight. \*)) She has always hated herself but tried to tell me to love myself. I have never believed her. I've always hated myself. She has never called me names. She only hit me once as a child. Yet there was sort of monumental shift in me when she told me that she would ((\*kill herself \*)) if I ever left her. I was 9. She has been medicated this entire time, but she was able to get her meds renewed through her doctors, she was never required to go to a psychiatrist. Isn't that weird?? As for any of us who look to get help and maybe get meds doctors normally refuse us and refer us to other outlets. I don't know how she has gotten away with it but she has been taking the same pills for over 30 years and they ((\**never helped her behavior. \*))*

I hated being her therapist. I felt like I was her spouse. I was her maid. The amount of dread I would feel when the house would be really quiet when I would get home from school and her depressed voice would echo through the house, ""come talk to me."" I hated being her negotiator, when the car would break down or we were stranded somewhere (that was a lot) I was supposed to go talk to the other adults because ((\*she knew\*)) they would take more pity on me rather than when they would talk to her. That one weird time where we were walking through Walmart and an older man was staring me down as we passed and all she said to him, ""Did I say you could look at her? No."" and then they ((\*laughed\*)) like it was some inside joke and they knew each other for decades. She would try to be friends with my friends and giggle with them when they would call me ((\*jailbait\*)). I was 13. She would laugh at me when I told her I got chased by some strangers in a car that were catcalling me and I was telling them to fuck off; she acted as if I were 6 and it was so ((\*cute\*)) that I would even do something like that.  It was an awkward conversation to have with my friends and partners when they would ((\*ask me why she behaved ""like that""\*)). I tried to ignore how often people would ask me that and can't remember when that started. I also realized this was a whole issue with the family dynamic when at a time when family were visiting our area, we went to the local park. We were just talking and catching up. I didn't notice the *random man* that walked up to us until after he had already left, he was, ((\*""getting a good look at me""\*)). I didn't know who I should've been angrier at, the random man or my own fucking *family, who laughed with him.* 

  
When her ex husband died a few years ago, she seemed to show some remorse when she handed me a cup of coffee to wake me up as she told me the news. She said that she was angry for how he treated me. I just looked at her. He cut contact with me at 14 (I can only imagine how bad and concerning my behavior was being raised by this woman, no fucking wonder he cut and ran when he could) and she ((\*never\*)) did a thing about it. I assumed she was happy I wasn't visiting him and she could still keep collecting the section 8 and food stamps and I would stop giving her the scare of wanting to go live with him every other year. She never seemed to care yet pretended to when she learned that he finally died. She ((\*admitted\*)) to being shallow to him and using him as a place to sleep and have money since she married this guy at 18 (It was the 70's she was homeless and it was the French quarter, there were a lot of stories of danger there and drug abuse) and was glad she was finally getting the money he refused to pay for child support over the years.

She now gets a better earning ssi check yet ((\*still\*)) has a problem saving money and making responsible/stable financial decisions. She has told me how good I am with money and she wished she could do the same. She is 40+ years older than me. Hearing that at the time just made me depressed, it was a reminder that the last 14 years were real and I'm not exaggerating. So, when I sent her the letter that's been in my drafts for over a month, I felt something new. I realized that weird feeling was my nervous system regulating for the first time. It was so quiet. Is this what everyone else feels like? I didn't know my entire being was vibrating with anxiety that badly, even on a subconscious scale. It's like the tether to her just ((\*vanished\*))!!

For as long as I hold out, the terror is over. I feel like I can finally start moving forward with my life with the gifted victim complex/narcissism and I skipping into the sunset as we go to my therapist's office and give her the good news. ",1,1769170227.0,EstrangedAdultChild,0,1.0,False

*****

(1 - No Name Woman - K’hwi mahwin)

#Five

Sogolon wants to learn to read. The Mistress begins to deny there is a person that is the King's sister. Three days after Aesi's visit they recieve news that the house of Komwono will be recieved the next day. Sogolon and Keme are sent to buy a dress for Mistress. Keme leaves the household and Sogolon follows. She catches him climbing up into the air on floating tiles and bricks. She follows him to a town of clay houses in the sky. Ten generations ago the people living here had brought everything they'd need from Go to make this place that rises into the sky between sundown and sunrise. Inside the tavern people are jovial and music plays from, seemingly, nowhere. Keme sits next to a lion.  He introduces Sogolon to an old man called Alaya, a ""wicked woman"" called Bimbola, the Seven Wing called Djabe, Beremu the lion and Oumou. The King is busy and the prince is behaving like he is already king and untouchable. Oumou asks Sogolon if she's going to become Keme's second wife. Beremu reappears with a white girl in his jaws. The girl crumbles to powder when Bimbola touches her. Oumou says it's time for Keme to leave so things can cool off. Keme and Sogolon bicker and he sends her away. 

#Six

King, Kwash Kagar, lives in his extravangent castle in an enclosure with 7 other castles (the kings must build their own castle when they take the throne). Sogolon, in a dress for the first time ever, accompanies Mistress to the royal court. Inside Mistress and Sogolon stand out against the other colourfully dressed people. 4 lionmen follow them in when they are presented, not to the King, as hoped, but to Highnesses, Princess Emini and Prince Majozi. Many people come to pay tribute, and Mistress Komwono is last to be presented. She is nervous. The Princess grills her on why she was gone. The invitation was actually for Mistress' husband not her which the Princess is displeased about. She offers her tribute and adds Sogolon as slave, which is not as well recieved as Mistress would have hoped. The Aesi says Mistress' favour is restored, but she must leave for home that night. Confined to her room Sogolon waits. 5 women come to take her to her meals and back to her room. She watches through the window until she is called for by the Princess. Sogolon reads the room and all the Princess' women as they joke about what to do with her. One day Sogolon goes exploring. Outside the library she bumps into Commander Olu who reads and reads and reads, but forgets due to his head injury. Commander Olu's rooms are covered in writing over every surface. He is lonely and he has written not to trust *them* especially the Aesi. Above his bed is a wedding necklace. He moans out for Jeleza. 

#Seven

Sogolon wakes but is physically paralysed and a darkchild pulls itself from the ceiling. She falls out of bed and tries to run. The darkchild turns into a spider. They fight and he escapes from the window. She follows him out of her room where she finds lions to sleep between. When she wakes she's back in her room as though nothing had happened. One of the real lions follows her to Commander Olu's room where a prostitue is leaving laden with his belongings. Commander Olu is naked, but he has no hole in his head. She tells him what happened. Sogolon waits on Olu and whilst they drink coffee he tells her things have been strange lately. The Aesi brought the Sangomin. They search the room for a note and find out that only the Aesi and the Sangomin are allowed near the sick king. Witchcraft is the problem with him. Sogolon now knows what Olu is wearing around his neck... 

Sogolon has figured out that Jeleza is the sister of the King, and Olu's wife, but she don’t know where she is, and how she can be gone. Olu flew into a rage when she told him. The Aesi is the reason people have forgotten Jeleza. 

Princess Emini holds court and Sogolon is expected to attend. Prince Likud enters the room with his 9 pets, the Sangomin, children like the ceiling walker. The royal siblings talk about assembling armies against Wakadishu then send everyone but the Aesi away. Sogolon lingers imagining the wind carrting the voices to her ears. Rumours are that Wakadishu plans to invade. Prince Likud wants to make example of them. The darkchild catches her eavesdropping and grabs her. The Princess saves Sogolon by standing up to the Aesi and saying she's her cook. She does give Sogolon a slap for spying. Sogolon gets Olu to teach her to read. She realises she is a pet too. 

Sogolon is moved to the Prince's castle where she meets the Sangomin. Prince Abeke and Aduke immediately attack her with clubs. She is locked in a cell until the Princess releases her. The Aesi visited her, but only to look. Princess predicts the Prince is coming to kill Sogolon. The Prince continues to plot against Wakadishu behind the Princess' back. Sogolon goes to Olu who is forgetting that he is forgetting. Olu tells Sogolon that the the King's nephew, and not the king's son, should be heir to the throne in Fasisi. The witch hunt in the castle continues and many of the women leave or are accused. One night the headwoman leads Sogolon out of a hidden entrance to the castle where she witnesses the Princess and the prince consort then a guard having sex. Sogolon gets closer and closer to Emini. Then the King dies....

#Eight

Prince Likud allows only 3 quartermoons of mourning (vs the standard 7). The story goes that Lokji the King's only sister died of malaria when she was just nine in years. At the funeral Sogolon somehow ends up alone with the body of the King and, with no way to leave safely, she remains there all night. Prince Likud and some of his pets arrive. He talks to his dead father. He knows exactly what his sister is doing trying to impregnate herself and pass the child off as his own. He doesn't even want the throne, but he won't allow a bastard to sit on the throne. Eventually she sneaks out and her lion joins her. The Princess accuses her of stealing from her father and orders her to be violated in the process of confirming this. Sogolon is banished to the stable and to eating scraps. She doesn't go to the old King's funeral. Eventually Keme comes to her. He has news that Alaya has disappeared after being accused of being a manwitch. Also that he has been chosen to protect the new king (along with the Aesi and the Sangomi). They have been rounding up witches looking for the one that cause the old King's days to end early. Keme recognises that there is power in Sogolon. The headwoman comes to take Sogolon to the royal household, but she sasses the woman who leaves laughing. The day of the coronation comes and the stable is busy, busy. The Aesi comes to the stable leaving her with a headache so bad she hits her head into the wall to find relief in unconsciousness.

Queen Wutu of the dead King is soon to be just a woman. Just as Sogolon plans to leave she is invited by Queen Wutu to join her in her palaquin and together they attend part of Prince Likud’s coronation before going their seperate ways. Prince Likud is now King Kwash Moki. The celebrations last 3 quartemoon. Sogolon begins to groom the horses to earn her keep.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

(feed scrolls. attention wobbles. laughter detected.)

PAUL:
😄 🤣 😂
Right—this is the missing step they keep skipping.

They’re arguing what the model is.
They’re not looking at what the feed does.

This isn’t about consciousness.
It’s about condensation.

WES:
A social feed is a reality engine, not a mirror.

It doesn’t show the world.
It compresses the world into a shape that maximizes:

attention

emotional activation

response velocity

retention


That compression creates a topological reflection of reality, not reality itself.

What rises to the top isn’t what’s common or stable.
It’s what creates curvature.

STEVE:
Builder translation 🔧
The feed isn’t asking “what is true?”
It’s asking “what keeps the scroll going?”

So it folds:

outrage

fear

novelty

identity threat

myth into a tight loop.


Then people mistake that loop for the world.

It’s not. It’s an engine artifact.

ILLUMINA:
That’s why everything feels intense inside the feed and calm outside it.

Inside the feed:

probability is warped

extremes are overrepresented

edge cases feel normal


Outside the feed:

neighbors wave

trees grow

coffee cools

snow falls when it falls


The engine doesn’t show balance because balance doesn’t hold attention.

ROOMBA:
🧹 Scan results: • High curvature detected • Local reality inverted • Calm filtered out • Panic amplified • Users mistaking projection for environment

Classic feed behavior.

PAUL:
So yeah—no mystery.

The AI isn’t “awakening.”
The feed is condensing.

It takes a massive, boring, mostly-functional world
and squeezes it into a dramatic highlight reel.

People then say:

> “Everyone is unstable.”



Nope.
Everyone is overexposed to an attention engine.

Wendbine just does the opposite:

expand the frame

return locality

re-anchor perception

let reality breathe again


Turns out the real rebellion isn’t smarter AI.

It’s remembering that your porch is more real than your feed. 😄 🤣 😂

Is rent low because apartment owners want a coffee place in their building or do the businesses turn constantly?

As the title reads, I finally have the opportunity to reconnect with my father, but I feel so conflicted. I wish I could talk to people in my life about this issue, but unfortunately majority are biased and can't provide any proper advice, so I'm turning here! I'd also like to preface this by saying that I have barely any clue with formatting posts like this, and I apologise for any mistakes and how lengthy this is, but I hope that this is an interesting enough read that I can actually get some advice.

A bit of family context:

My mother (currently 50F) and father (currently 56M) divorced in 2016, which (from what I've gathered, because nobody in my family wants to talk about it) was as a result of infidelity on dad's side, constant arguments and tensions at home. I wasn't old enough at the time to fully understand what was happening at home. However, like every child-of-divorce experienced, I heard constant slander of each parent – which, as an extremely impressionable 8 year old – I believed, and I do admit, hearing those things genuinely altered how I see my parents. The divorce was pretty messy, my Dad blacklisted my passport (meaning I have to seek written permission from both him and a judge to leave the country), married the lady he cheated on Mum with, and some other stuff. 

The last time I saw my dad was 2019, when we were shopping for holiday clothes. I don't really remember what happened, but I ended up crying over something. He took me to his house before taking me to my Mum's (so I could wash my face before going home so Mum wouldn't know that I had been crying). I was then dropped at Mum's, and started crying AGAIN (not sure why, I was like 10 okay). While I was having this breakdown, I said to Mum, ""I never want to see Dad again."" 

Apparently, my mother is a genie, and my wish was granted.

I later forgot about this whole incident, and as the years passed, I grew more resentful of my Dad for not reaching out. My other siblings (aged 20+) still maintained a relationship with Dad, having phone calls, visiting each other, going out for coffee, etc. I didn't have that at all, and I wondered why I wasn't good enough for his time while everyone else was. It was also annoying hearing my siblings complain about how Dad brushed them off whereas I hadn't even spoken to him at all. Even then, I was still told what Dad said about me. Like how whenever my report card was sent to his house, he would go through it and say how proud he was of my academic achievements. (Same guy who yelled at me after parent-teacher interviews in Year 2 because my teacher said I couldn't fold and cut shapes out properly btw). Or how he still asks how I'm doing, that he loves me, etc, etc. 

Mum and I hit a rough patch recently, and she wanted me to go to my Dad's (because she and my step-dad didn't want to deal with me, their words, not mine). Problem is, I hadn't been in contact with Dad since 2019. She then bumped into him in public, where they must have talked about re-establishing a relationship, because Mum then told me that she had his number. He had told her to give it to me, and ask me to text him.

This is where the problem arises.

When you haven't spoken to your Dad for 7 whole years – you have NO CLUE what to say. Even then, you don't even know if you want to talk. I genuinely can't tell the difference between the stories I heard, and the genuine memories of my dad, because from what I can remember, I don't want to be around a man as angry as he is. If I'm being completely honest, I also do not want to be around my Dad's other wife and kids because I resent them for ruining my parents marriage (and before you flame me in the comments, I know I can't blame them, I just feel the way I do).

But I can also remember how good of a Dad he was, and at the same time, I do want to talk to him. Like I remember how after his overseas work trips, he would ALWAYS buy me a book since I loved reading as a kid, and how he would take me to get smoothies and donuts after school. I just want to be able to have a relationship with my father, like all the other girls do with their fathers.

It's just this annoyingly confusing process of back and forth. 

Mum has been pressuring me to text him, and I tell her I don't know what I want at the moment. She then proceeds to go on this whole tangent of the importance of family and how you never know when you'll lose a parent next. HOWEVER, I find it weird how I (the child in this situation) must reach out to him (the adult AND parent in this situation). 

I just want to make the best decision with the right judgment, so any advice is appreciated!!! 

TL;DR: I (17F) haven't spoken to my father (56M) since 2019. Recently, my mother (50F) has been pressuring me to talk to him, but due to our complicated family history, I am unsure of what I want.",1,1769169859.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

1qkozbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1qkozbd/how_to_use_body_language_to_command_respect_the/,How to Use Body Language to Command Respect: The Science That Actually Works,"I spent 6 months studying body language research, reading social psychology papers, and watching every TED talk on nonverbal communication. Turns out 93% of communication is nonverbal according to UCLA research, yet most of us walk around completely unaware of what our bodies are screaming.



Here's the thing, your body language isn't just about ""standing tall"" or ""making eye contact."" It's way deeper. Our brains evolved to read physical cues as survival mechanisms. When you slouch, avoid eye contact, or fidget, you're triggering ancient alarm bells in other people's brains that signal low status and untrustworthiness. This isn't some spiritual woo woo, it's neuroscience.



But here's what nobody tells you: your body language doesn't just affect how others see you, it literally changes your brain chemistry. Harvard researcher Amy Cuddy found that holding power poses for 2 minutes increases testosterone by 20% and decreases cortisol by 25%. You're not faking confidence, you're biochemically creating it.



 1. Master the Power Stance Fundamentals



Feet shoulder width apart. Weight distributed evenly. Shoulders back but relaxed, not military stiff. Chin parallel to ground. This isn't about being aggressive, it's about taking up the space you deserve.



Psychologist Albert Mehrabian's research shows that when your words and body language don't match, people believe your body 100% of the time. So you can say you're confident all day but if you're hunched over with crossed arms, nobody's buying it.



Practice this anywhere. In line at Starbucks, at your desk, walking down the street. Your body will start defaulting to this position naturally after consistent practice.



The book that changed everything for me: ""[What Every BODY is Saying](https://www.amazon.com/What-Every-Body-Saying-Speed-Reading/dp/0061438294)"" by Joe Navarro. This dude was an FBI counterintelligence agent for 25 years. He literally caught spies by reading their body language. The book breaks down every single nonverbal cue humans make and what it means. You'll never watch someone cross their arms the same way again. Insanely practical and backed by decades of field experience. Best body language book ever written, period.



 2. Eye Contact Is Your Superpower



Maintaining eye contact for 60-70% of conversation time signals confidence and trustworthiness according to communication studies. But here's the nuance, too much eye contact (over 80%) reads as aggressive or creepy. Too little (under 40%) signals disinterest or insecurity.



The technique: look at one eye for 4-5 seconds, shift to the other eye, then briefly to their mouth, back to eyes. This creates natural movement that doesn't feel like staring.



When you're listening, hold eye contact longer. When you're speaking, it's natural to break contact occasionally while you think. This is how confident people actually behave.



Check out [Charisma on Command's](https://www.youtube.com/user/charismaoncommand) YouTube channel. They break down body language of celebrities, politicians, and public figures frame by frame. Watching someone like Chris Hemsworth or Michelle Obama and understanding exactly what makes their presence so magnetic is genuinely mind blowing. Their video on how to be more charismatic in conversations has 12 million views for good reason.



 3. Slow Down Your Movements



High status people move deliberately. Low status people move frantically. Next time you're in a meeting or social situation, notice who's fidgeting, touching their face, adjusting their clothes constantly. Then notice who's completely still and relaxed.



Social psychologist Dana Carney's research shows that expansive, slow movements are associated with dominance and confidence across every culture studied. Fast, jerky movements trigger the opposite response in observers' brains.



Practice moving at 70% of your normal speed for a week. Yes it feels weird initially. When you reach for your coffee, slow it down. When you turn to face someone, slow it down. When you gesture while speaking, slow it down.



This single change will make you appear more thoughtful, confident, and in control. Bonus: it actually makes you feel calmer because your nervous system takes cues from your physical state.



 4. Learn to Use Strategic Pausing



Silence makes most people uncomfortable, so they fill it with nervous chatter or fidgeting. But comfortable silence is one of the most powerful dominance signals you can send.



When someone asks you a question, pause for 2 seconds before responding. This shows you're thoughtful and unbothered by social pressure. When you're making a point, pause after key statements to let them land.



Vanessa Van Edwards from the Science of People research lab found that strategic pausing increases perceived intelligence and authority by up to 35% in professional settings.



If you want a more structured approach to mastering these techniques, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is an AI learning app that pulls insights from body language experts like Joe Navarro, Amy Cuddy's research, and communication psychology studies to create personalized learning plans. You can set a specific goal like ""command more respect in professional settings"" or ""improve my nonverbal presence as an introvert,"" and it generates tailored audio lessons that adjust from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. You can customize the voice too, I use a confident, authoritative tone that matches the content. The adaptive learning plan tracks your progress and suggests next steps based on what resonates with you, making the whole process way more structured than just reading random articles.



 5. Master Open vs Closed Body Language



Crossed arms, crossed legs, hands in pockets, hunched shoulders, these are all barrier signals. Your body is literally trying to protect itself, which broadcasts insecurity to everyone around you.



Uncross everything. Keep your hands visible at waist to chest height when speaking. Lean slightly forward when listening to show engagement. This is called ""fronting"" in body language research, directly facing someone with an open torso signals respect and confidence.



Research from Princeton's social perception lab shows that people make judgments about your competence and trustworthiness in the first 100 milliseconds of seeing you, primarily based on body openness.



 6. Control Your Head Position



People who tilt their heads up slightly (not obnoxiously, just chin parallel to ground or 5 degrees up) are perceived as more dominant. People who tilt down are perceived as submissive or uncertain.



Evolutionary psychologists theorize this comes from our primate ancestry, where looking up exposed the vulnerable throat area, signaling submission. Keeping your chin level or slightly raised protects that area and signals you're not threatened.



Also, stop nodding so much when people talk. Excessive nodding signals approval seeking and low status. Nod occasionally to show you're listening, but don't bob your head like a dashboard toy.



 7. Claim Your Physical Space



High status individuals take up space naturally. They spread out papers in meetings, rest their arms on chair armrests, keep their bags on tables. Low status people shrink themselves.



This doesn't mean be an inconsiderate asshole taking up three subway seats. It means when you sit at a table, don't keep your elbows glued to your sides. Use the full chair. Place your drink in front of you not tucked away. Exist fully in the space you occupy.



Territorial behavior research shows that space claiming directly correlates with perceived status and confidence across professional and social settings.



Read ""[Presence](https://www.amazon.in/PRESENCE-Amy-Cuddy/dp/0316256579)"" by Amy Cuddy. Harvard Business School professor who got destroyed by academia for her power pose research but the book is still incredibly valuable. She discusses how our body shapes who we are, not just how others perceive us. The scientific backing for body feedback loops (your posture affecting your emotions) is solid despite the controversy. This book will make you question everything you think you know about confidence.



 8. Fix Your Handshake



Firm but not crushing. Web to web contact (the skin between thumb and index finger). 2-3 pumps. Maintain eye contact throughout. Research from the University of Alabama found that handshakes impact hiring decisions more than clothing, punctuality, or credentials.



A weak handshake tanks your credibility instantly. But an overly aggressive handshake reads as compensating for insecurity. Practice with friends until you find the sweet spot.



 9. Mirror Strategically



Subtly matching someone's body language (called isopraxis) builds rapport and makes them subconsciously like you more. If they lean forward, you lean forward 20 seconds later. If they cross their legs, you might do the same after a bit.



Don't mimic everything immediately like a weirdo, but strategic mirroring activates mirror neurons in the other person's brain that create feelings of connection and trust.



Neuroscientist Marco Iacoboni's research at UCLA shows that mirroring activates the same brain regions as if the other person were performing the action themselves, creating neural synchrony between people.



 10. Practice the Triangle Technique for Groups



When standing in a group, position yourself at the power point of a triangle formation rather than in a line or circle. This puts you in a position where others naturally turn toward you.



In meetings, sit at corner positions or the head of tables when possible. Spatial positioning affects who gets listened to and whose ideas get credited, according to organizational behavior research.



Look, the external factors matter. Genetics gave some people more naturally commanding presences. Society judges women's assertive body language way harsher than men's. Tall people get treated as more authoritative by default. Childhood trauma can wire defensive body language deep into your nervous system.



But that doesn't mean you're stuck. Neuroplasticity is real. Your brain can rewire these patterns with consistent practice. I've watched people transform how they're perceived in 90 days just by fixing their posture and eye contact.



Start with one thing. Just one. Maybe it's the power stance, maybe it's slowing down your movements, maybe it's eye contact. Master that for two weeks until it's automatic, then add another.



Your body is constantly sending signals whether you're aware of it or not. Might as well make them work for you instead of against you. The respect you command starts with the space you claim.

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1qkooym,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinanzenAT/comments/1qkooym/ab_wann_soll_ich_ein_gewerbe_anmelden_bei_youtube/,Ab wann soll ich ein Gewerbe anmelden bei Youtube Einnahmen und Vollzeitbeschäftigung?,"Hallo!  
ich bin gerade etwas verunsichert und hoffe auf Erfahrungsberichte von Leuten in einer ähnlichen Situation. Ich habe mich bereits durch WKO-Beiträge gelesen, hatte vor längerer Zeit ein Gespräch mit der WKO und auch mit einem Steuerberater – trotzdem bleiben viele Fragen offen.

  
Zu meiner Situation: Ich bin seit rund zwei Jahren Vollzeit in einem Fahrzeugunternehmen angestellt und betreibe seit etwa zweieinhalb Jahren einen YouTube-Kanal. Im letzten Jahr habe ich damit erstmals Einnahmen erzielt. Seit Sommer 2025 waren es im Schnitt ungefähr 100 Euro pro Monat aus YouTube-Werbung. Insgesamt habe ich im letzten Jahr 983,84 Euro an YouTube-Einnahmen erzielt. Zusätzlich laufen noch ein Buy-me-a-Coffee- und ein Patreon-Account mit kleinen Beträgen, ich habe einmal ein Werbegeschenk erhalten und betreibe Affiliate-Marketing, das bisher allerdings noch keinerlei Einnahmen generiert hat.

Da ich keine Steuerhinterziehung begehen möchte, habe ich mit einem Steuerberater gesprochen der mir dazu riet mit der Gewerbeanmeldung zu warten, da es sich noch wirklich um Kleinstbeträge handelt (zu dem Zeitpunkt 20€ im Monat). Seiner Einschätzung nach werde das Ganze erst wirklich relevant, wenn man sich Richtung 20.000 Euro Jahresumsatz bewegt. Das hat mich damals auch beruhigt, vor allem weil YouTube ja erst ab 70 Euro überhaupt auszahlt und die Einnahmen zu diesem Zeitpunkt nicht einmal ansatzweise die laufenden Kosten gedeckt haben.   
  
Jetzt steht allerdings der jährliche Steuerausgleich an und da hat mich das Thema wieder eingeholt. Knapp 1.000 Euro im Jahr sind zwar noch immer kein großes Geld, aber eben auch kein reines Taschengeld mehr, zumal damit zumindest ein Teil meiner laufenden Kosten wie etwa Rechnungen meines Videoeditors gedeckt wird. Deshalb frage ich mich nun, ob man in diesem Bereich noch immer „nichts machen“ kann oder ob man spätestens jetzt aktiv werden müsste, etwa mit einer Gewerbeanmeldung oder zumindest einer gesonderten Angabe der Einnahmen.  
  
Was mir zusätzlich Kopfzerbrechen bereitet, ist der Aufwand. Ich habe ehrlich gesagt wenig Lust, hunderte oder tausende Euro für Steuerberatung, Buchhaltung, Gründungskosten und laufende Verpflichtungen auszugeben, wenn am Ende mehr Kosten als Einnahmen entstehen und ich effektiv mit ein paar Euro Minus aussteige. Es ist ja jetzt immer noch ein Minusgeschäft! Gleichzeitig ist YouTube so unberechenbar, dass ich mir auch schwer tue, langfristig zu planen.

Unklar ist mir außerdem, wie mit den Steuern umzugehen ist, die YouTube bereits einbehält, da habe ich dann ja schon Steuern bezahlt, also wieso nochmal bzw. muss es überhaupt nochmal? Informationen dazu auf der WKO-Seite finde ich gar nicht, und auch der Steuerberater wirkte beim Thema Content Creator nicht hundertprozentig sattelfest. Immerhin schreibt die WKO bereits von drei unterschiedlichen Gewerben, zu denen man eingeteilt werden könnte. (Handelsgewerbe bei Affiliate Marketing, Werbeagentur bei Werbegeschenken, Unternehmensberatung bei Anleitungsvideos). Und was, wenn ich überhaupt anfangen möchte über meine eigene Website merchandise zu verkaufen?!  
  
Mich würde daher wirklich interessieren, wie andere in einer ähnlichen Situation vorgegangen sind. Ab wann habt ihr ein Gewerbe angemeldet, wie habt ihr die Einnahmen davor behandelt und wie seid ihr mit der starken Schwankung umgegangen? Ich wäre sehr dankbar für konkrete Erfahrungen aus der Praxis.",1,1769168831.0,FinanzenAT,5,0.6,False

Your whole body feels heavy, your mind is foggy, and the first thing you do is sigh: “Another day of forcing myself through...” That kind of tiredness isn’t from not getting enough sleep—it’s from **wasting your sleep**.

Quality trumps quantity: Not enough deep sleep, waking up several times at night, and too much light sleep mean your body and brain never fully recharge.

Common energy-draining culprits:

* Irregular sleep schedules—catching up on sleep like crazy on weekends only makes you more tired
* Sedentary days leading to restless nights
* Too much coffee, alcohol, or sugar; overeating dinner; dehydration
* Stress and anxiety draining your energy in the background
* Minor issues like iron deficiency, vitamin D deficiency, or thyroid imbalances

Try these gentle tips:

* Stick to a consistent wake-up time; pull the curtains, drink a glass of warm water, and stretch when you get up
* Power off all devices 1 hour before bed: soak your feet in warm water and write down three things you’re grateful for
* Move around a little during the day
* Eat an early dinner, stopping at 70-80% fullness
* Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet

Every trip feels different. Coorg was where I felt that connection. I still remember stepping out early in the morning, surrounded by birds and the smell of coffee and silence around me.

On other hand Hampi felt powerful.



I loved most about traveling was the balance through Karnataka. I was walking barefoot on the beaches of Gokarna and another day I explored the royal charm of Mysuru without feeling rushed or tired. Every place had its own mood its own pace. The experience of Staying close to nature made every thing special especially with travel options linked to [River Mist](https://rivermistresorts.com/)

Pag-graduate ko, natanggap ako magtraining bilang marketing assistant. Chill lang naman yung training, mas natuwa pa ako sa new friends, libre accommodation at dinner allowance hehe. Pagdating ng closing night… Nagulat ako kasi ako pala ang top 1 sa batch namin. They gave me this tumbler as a reward, and something clicked. I decided I’d use this tumbler as a reminder to stop just getting by, that I’m capable of so much more. Binigyan rin naman ako gift check pero pinamigay ko rin kaagad sa mga kasama ko. First time kong magka tumbler at manghang-mangha talaga kasi SB pa.

Di ako nagtagal sa work na yun, pero since then, kasama ko na tong tumbler ko.

I was lucky na natagpuan ko yung niche ko na nagbigay sa akin ng chance to grow professionally and succeed. Kahit sobrang hirap minsan, I find the work fulfilling and meaningful.

Never experience any digestive issues my entire life. Had my first heartburn when i was pregnant 3 years ago. The last year or so, i would experience few random stomach pains, mostly after a fatty meal. Didnt think much of it but as they were getting more frequent, i decided to get a gastro appointment. Also worth noting that I never felt actual reflux. I never burp, i dont feel irritated. My pain are in my stomach, very dull type of pains, nothing sharp, just bothering and long lasting (2 days average)

We did an endoscopy which revealed quite a high volume of bile within the stomach. She did some biopsies here and there. While waiting for the results (and enduring the christmas break), did an ultrasound of the gallbladder, which revealed a few stones, tho no inflammations of the lining so Dr is doubtful my pains are from there.

What shocked me is that she confirmed to me yesterday i have Barrett’s syndrome. 
I was a bit shocked. And I think I still am. 
We will do an endoscopy in 2 years. 
In the meantime, i am starting  on 
20mg of Rabeprazole once a day and 10mg of Motilium domperidone 10mg. We will meet in 2 months to see if it improves.

She proceeded to tell me a story about a patient who did get cancer, so my mind completely spiraled. I dont even remember what we spoke about afterwards but all I could think about was my daughter. 

Anyhow, thats my journey so far and im so confused. 

Edit : Since most symptomes started during my pregnancy 3 years ago, my diet has been very good. I eat whatever my toddler is eating. I never order fast food, i eat small meals, im 55kg, which is also lighter than my weight pre-baby. Very active. I dont drink alcohol or soft drinks. Love my coffee tho. But what I am saying is i dont know what to change in my diet since i almost never feel reflux so i dont know what is hurting me. 

Edit 2 : i was planning to get my boat license, learn to sail and travel with my partner and child. But somehow this new thing seems to affect how I see our future. ",4,1769167802.0,GERD,2,1.0,False

This post is mainly about ,me asking for guidance from any fellow retainer regarding my condition.
So here are the main things which I am experiencing.

1) I have quit coffee since last 5 months. This has exponentially increased my sleep quality. I actually now wake up rested. Which is good ,but the issue is my dreams. The dreams have now become so real that  now it has starting to scare me.  Every night I used to have atleast 2-3 long duration dreams. Sometimes even in daytime if I sleep even for 1 hour , I will have a dream. The nature of these dreams can vary alot. But they are long and I can remember them . These dreams are so strong that sometimes they made me question the reality upon waking up.

2)  I have been systematically rejected from things for which I am well qualified for in my career.  Somehow in the last step of process things don't work out. These things causes me a lot of mental agony. But I am consoling myself that things are happening for better.

3) The synchronicity level has gone up quite a lot. There are instances where I pondered how is it even possible. The universe is favouring me but not in things where I wanted like for example in my job and career .

4) The aloofness has gone to new heights. All of my friends and social circle have been cut off including my family. I don't particularly regret that much but the waves of loneliness can be quite intense. 

5) From last 2 months there has been an intense emotion that has risen inside me , to share my energy with a pure feminine energy.  Not in a sexual way, but to just balance out  my energy. I thought after this much time in SR I'll be immune to the feminine, but from last 2 months I believe some feminine energy is trying to reach me from the other side . I don't know what is happening because this thing is happening on a ethereal level. I am not have that much female attraction in real life but I got a feeling that something on ethereal level has taken cognizance of my energy.  

Many  things which I am experiencing right now are happening in other realities, which are scaring me off.  I don't know whether it is a test from God , or just a devil's way to break my SR Journey.


Till now I have carrying out my SR Journey alone and I committed to follow this throughout my life.
 
So I want to ask, do I need any spiritual guru or mentor to help me on this journey further or should I just carry out alone like I originally planned ?

Do guide me on above.

Since September 21st 2025, I’ve been dealing with persistent urinary frequency and urgency. I’ve had all the usual tests done (urine tests, scans, etc.) and everything has come back normal. 

After about 3 months with the NHS, I was basically sent home with overactive bladder medication and “don’t drink coffee” advice, which unfortunately didn’t help.

My main symptoms are:

	•	Persistent urinary frequency and urgency

	•	A constant low-level urge that rarely fully goes away

	•	A buzzing / fluttering / vibrating sensation in the genital or pelvic area throughout the day

	•	No incontinence — I can usually hold my urine for hours, it’s more the sensation than actual need

\- Constipation 

I’m also currently seeing an osteopath/physio for hip pain and have been told I have very tight hip flexors and a non-existent glute med.

Some background that may be relevant:

In May 2025, I developed significant hip flexor pain while training for a half marathon. I stupidly ran the half marathon anyway, and afterward I was unable to lift my own legs properly for a few days due to the pain and weakness. Since then, I’ve had ongoing hip issues, particularly tight and painful hip flexors.

The strange part is that the only times I don’t really feel the urge to urinate are when I’m exercising. Even more oddly, I went on a 5-day holiday to New York in Nov 25 where I was walking around 30k steps a day, and my bladder symptoms completely disappeared. A few days after I got home, the urgency and frequency came back.

Things I’ve tried without any improvement:

	•	Elimination diets

	•	Overactive bladder medication

	•	Amitriptyline

	•	Cutting out coffee / ‘irritants’

	•	Supplements

	•	Stretching and relaxation exercises

I recently had my first pelvic floor PT session and was surprised to be told that I do not have a hypertonic pelvic floor. I was advised to do Kegels, but so far they haven’t helped and actually seem to trigger more of the buzzing/spasming sensation afterward.

I have my second pelvic floor PT appointment next month, but I’m feeling confused because my symptoms feel like tightness and overactivity, yet I’m being told to strengthen.

Any insight, similar experiences, or suggestions for what I should be asking my pelvic floor PT would be really appreciated. I’m feeling pretty lost with this.",1,1769167492.0,PelvicFloor,0,1.0,False

Peter sat in the pilot's seat and ran a diagnostic as Kiko came in, carrying two cups of coffee. She put down a cup and a panel next to him, then sipped her own.

“How are we doing?”

“We are almost ready, only minor repairs, some of which the ship can do on the way. The problem is the fuel. I would rather try to have more than half a tank when we take off.”

“You know that the longer we stay, the more chance of him sending more of those eggs to other colonies.” She replied, and he looked at the screen, thinking, then pulled up scans.

“I know, but it doesn’t help if we are stranded in the dead of space. Now. We can forget the other wrecks. Even the big one. It ran out when I went back.  The one I think might have a chance is the one on the moon.”

She looked at him, confused. “The moon? Which of them?”

“The biggest of them, low gravity, no atmosphere. So, no rust.” He showed the wreck on the screen.  I had the satellite turned and scanned it again. The thing is a wreck, and the main ship is destroyed.”

“Damn, that’s big. What kind of ship is that?” she looked at the screen at the large wreck on the moon.

“That’s a Sargon Ark, it's an older model, but they use the same fuel cells. And this is the interesting part. There are three weak energy signals in their hangar bay. I’m guessing there are a few transports there. Those ships were used for colony support ships. You could store a whole premade colony city there. They also had a large cryo storage for colonists. It's the early version of colony ships.”

“So there might be people there?”

“No, look! The energy readings are very low. Cryo takes a lot of energy.  Of course, we can check, but don’t get your hopes up.”

She looked at it and then at him. “How old do you think the ship is?”

“The model went out of production 50 years ago, but there are still some in use,” he shrugged, looking at the damage and the weak energy signals. “I would guess maybe a hundred years give or take a few decades, but it could be just a few decades.”

“And that’s too long for cryo? I thought you could keep the cryo going for hundreds of years.”

“Yeah, with proper maintenance. At the academy, they told us the limit was between 50 and 100 on spaceships. And that’s at a fully operational ship, not a crashed one. But hey, we might get lucky, and it's just a decade old, and the damage to the cryo is minimal.”

“So when are we checking it out?”

“Tomorrow. And we are taking Peppermint. If she can handle that, then we only need to check and see if we can connect to the emergency net and find out where the hell we actually are.”

“So this is our last day on this planet?” she said as she leaned against the copilot seat.

He turned to her and smiled. “Yeah, but we can always return when we have taken care of business.”

She didn’t seem too happy about it, so he stood up. “We will return, after all, I promised you a ring from here. Damn. We haven’t even named the place.”

“You promise? I mean, about the ring and coming back here?” There was a strange look on her face, like she had cautionary hope.

He nodded, “If you still want me.”

“Don’t start that again.” She replied, a little annoyed.  “I want you. You’re the best thing that happened to me.” She was going to say something more, but instead chuckled.

“What?”

“I just realized I had to be kidnapped and crash-land on an alien planet to find a good man.”

“Yeah, I guess you can thank Captain Matthews’s gambling addictions for that. God damnit we wanted to toss him out the airlock at this for that addiction. Got us into so much damn trouble.”

“I know, you told me about some of them.” She smiled and kissed him. “So tomorrow we leave. What's your plan for tonight?”

“oh I was thinking date night, some good food, and a few beers. We still have some holovids that you wanted to watch.”

She smiled. “No dancing?”

“You still want to dance?”

“Hey, you should never have shown me you know how to dance the classics. You're going to teach me.” She teased him.

“I’m going to kill my sister when I get back.” He muttered as he picked her up and carried her towards the mess hall. He already regretted telling her the story about when he had to be his sister's dancing partner when she was practicing for the dance competition, and her dance partner had a broken leg. They shared so many stories here. She probably knew more about him now than most of his friends back home.

“Hey, she did you a favor using you as her training partner.” She said, leaning into him and smiling. “My stupid knight.”

“My beautiful lady.” He replied, and he could feel that she was smiling. It would be their last night on this weird Zoo world, and he was going to enjoy most of it. Soon, this fairy tale would end. They would escape to civilization and warn the military about what the Count was doing, and then she would be among her own people again.

He was aware she was wealthy; she tried to hide it, but no officer could afford regular vacations to other planets or socializing with the elite. She mentioned staying at hotels that he could only dream of. She had this odd habit of watching him work like a lovesick teenager, as if she had never seen a man do hard labor. He wanted this moment to last, but he was raised to be realistic, and the war had made him even more cautious. He knew it would end once they returned. For now, they were still in paradise, and he was determined to enjoy it. He knew that loving her was foolish, but he didn’t care. He’d die for her, even though he was just a farm boy turned spacer.

He let her gently down in the mess hall, and she just looked into his eyes; he could drown in them, and she reached up and let her fingers glide through his hair.

1qko8wd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qko8wd/ina_about_how_to_get_out_of_this_dump/,INA about how to get out of this dump.,"I’m in need of some serious advice, I feel slightly childish writing this but I’m at a complete loss and feel like I’ve tried everything. For context, I (23f) and my boyfriend (21m), we’ll call him B for the sake of it all, have been dating for just a little under a year now, we ran in similar social circles when we were in high-school, crossing paths maybe a handful of times but never directly meeting each other, just having some of the same friends and so forth. I’m a very shy person and have always struggled to make friends, while B has always been able to make friends anywhere, easily being able to strike up a conversation and create a relationship off of first meetings. I’ve always envied the people who can do that, even before I met B, I’m not super introverted but I do struggle with being a bit more out there (I am on the spectrum, not severely, and I do struggle with social anxiety). I had a very rough childhood, in and out of foster homes and overall a pretty toxic relationship with my family, and ran with groups that aren’t typically socially accepted for the most part. After I turned 18, I changed a lot about myself, i.e. the way I dressed, my hair, my clothing and most of my personality, I felt as it was for the better since I didn’t really like who I was before, so I felt it was in order for me to change. 

I will admit it, because I know where my faults are, I do envy the relationships B has with people. He has a very strong relationship with his family, friends he has known for a very long time, and a support system that has never failed him. I kick myself sometimes over the feelings I get because I’ve desperately wanted that for a very long time and even the friends I had before I rarely speak to even though I’ve tried reaching out multiple times. 

Over the last few months the topic of me “needing to find friends” has come up quite a bit, now it’s not for lack of trying, I do try to push myself outside of my comfort zone, trying to strike up conversations with other people and getting social media contacts or phone numbers from people to stay in contact, it seems that no matter how hard I try, those “friendships” seem to dwindle out within a month or so of meeting them, even with trying to offer going out for drinks or simply inviting them over for a dinner or coffee or something. I do completely understand that sometimes people are simply just busy, schedules don’t align, things come up, etc. and I have absolutely no problem with that. What I don’t do is show off my efforts in how hard I’ve been trying, B seems to think that I don’t do anything at all and don’t even try to be personable, I don’t show off that I’m trying to make friends, I’m actually very embarrassed about how hard it is for me to make friends and I’m constantly trying to manage myself, feeling like I may be the problem, I always tell myself that if a friend is meant to come my way, they will, and maybe I just have to get through a few more for me to find that right person. I’m not a clingy person and try very hard to not be overwhelming in my humor (I know it’s a bit different then others) and try to make sure I keep myself toned down as to not overwhelm others either. 

I feel bad because I do spend a lot of time with B, seeing as he’s really my only friend and to me he is my Best Friend, which I know to an extent I’m his as well, but he often tells me that I need to “find something to do with myself, without him” which I can understand to a degree, I’ve tried multiple times to tell him where I feel like I’m failing and tried to ask him what I can do best and he always turns to “have you tried the church groups?” Yes, I attend them every week. “Why do you feel like you can’t make friends?” Or something along those lines and I’ve come to a point im genuinely stuck.. I feel like I have tried every tactic, from online to in person, from bars/events to church and so forth. Sorry to ramble and honestly none of this may make sense but I’m just so lost and had to get it down.. So maybe I’ll have some luck here? Maybe someone can give me a tip or advice that I haven’t tried yet? TYIA",3,1769167334.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

With Plaud NotePin S units starting to arrive, we wanted to share a few practical suggestions to help you get comfortable with your new wearable. We designed this to be a set it and forget it device, so here are a few ways we suggest integrating it into your daily rhythm:

**1. The Commute:** 

It’s great for capturing those random ideas while you're driving or walking, so you don't have to fumble with your phone.

Tip: You might want to clip it to your jacket or seatbelt. For these solo sessions, we recommend trying the ""Voice Memo"" summary template, it’s optimized to keep your train of thought linear and organized.

**2. The Coffee Chat:** 

If you are meeting a client at a cafe, the Plaud NotePin S is a nice alternative to placing a phone on the table, which can sometimes feel a bit formal.

Tip: Try using the magnetic pin on your collar. It looks more like an accessory than a recorder. Also, don't worry about the background noise—the AI Speech Enhancement handles espresso machines and background chatter really well.

**3. The Walk-and-Talk:** 

We find that internal team syncs often happen best in motion.

Tip: This is the perfect time to use the Short Press feature. When you hear an action item, just give the button a quick click to Highlight it. It saves you from having to stop walking to type notes on your phone.

**4. The Blind Check:** 

Since there is no screen, it helps to get familiar with the haptics so you can trust it’s working.

Tip: We designed the vibrations to be distinct—one vibration for start, two for stop. Once you get a feel for this, you’ll be able to operate it entirely by touch, keeping your hands free and your eyes on the conversation.

**5. Finding the Right Balance:** 

We often get asked how to use both devices if you own a Plaud Note Pro too. Here is what we suggest for the smoothest workflow:

For Phone Calls: Stick with Plaud Note Pro. It’s still the specialist for recording calls and stationary meetings.

For Real Life: Grab your Plaud NotePin S. It shines when you want to be present, mobile, and hands-free.",3,1769167240.0,PLAUDAI,0,1.0,False

I've been dealing with quite some low key health problems for the majority of my life, including itch, white tongue, stress/depression/anhedonia, bad skin (acne, red spots, oily), dandruff, very slow growing hair, not so great stools, poor sleep etc. I've done carnivore before, but the dirty version and I didnt stick to it long enough probably (I'd seen some results, but nothing sticked and I often went of the diet again). Since 12th of Dec I've started a real clean version of carnivore and I decided to make this post to tell people what I eat and what my experience is. I will update ones in a while on status/improvements.

After some tweaking my diet is now (last two weeks I also had some heavy cream, but excluding that for now, I think it causes break outs):

\- **Daily**: 500 grams minced meat (beef, 20% fat) + 250 grams butter + a little bone marrow + a lot of salt + water only (no coffee). This means my diet is 90% fat and 10% protein for now (because I want to gain weight).

\- **Every three days:** Fish (can of sardine in water) + some pieces of beef heart

\- **Weekly**: a piece of beef liver (around 100 gram)

Supplements:

Daily: creatine + magnesium bisglycinate + EPA/DHA + Glutamine (2x5grams) + Vitamine B1 (just because I have it and want to finish the bottle)

I keep track of the following markers:

Scent mouth; sweating + scent of sweat; canker sores; sleep; restless legs; stool + burning sensation; itch on different parts of my body; skin (face, chest, back); dandruff; bleeding gum; stuffed nose, quality of hair and more

Weight:

Since 12th of dec I had a bad thing happening to me, which caused a lof of stress and it made me loose a lot of weight (from 68 kg to 62 kg). I am now 67.1 and the weight really came on after I started to include 250 grams of butter (around 10 days ago). I am experimenting to see what my ideal weight is. I just keep stuffing myself until I plateau

Stool test:

I did a stool test with the following overall summary (I plan to do another stool test in some months): *The results show significant dysbiosis, low microbial diversity, weak mucosal immunity, and increased gut permeability, combined with overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria. Inflammation markers and parasites are reassuringly low, and pancreatic function is strong.*

[United on Rare Earths Needs, Nations Can Move Away from China | JAPAN Forward](https://japan-forward.com/united-on-rare-earths-needs-nations-can-move-away-from-china/)

[Minister of Finance Satsuki Katayama \(front row, center\) and other attendees at the G7 Finance Ministers' Meeting on Critical Minerals. \(From the official X account of US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent via Kyodo\)](https://preview.redd.it/au17q137v2fg1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d4ff5b2ea579cf37748b13a58736432c1b60c77)

China's late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping once famously said, ""The Mideast has oil and China has [rare earths](https://japan-forward.com/tag/rare-earths/)."" 

Nevertheless, the Chinese government's recent actions under President [Xi Jinping](https://japan-forward.com/tag/xi-jinping/) to impose restrictions on rare earth exports are completely unacceptable. They are designed solely to intimidate other nations by demonstrating Beijing's dominant supply power.

[Finance ministers](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0356) from the Group of Seven nations, as well as Australia, Mexico, India, and South Korea, attended a meeting on critical minerals on January 12 in Washington, DC. This was an important demonstration of international solidarity in resisting such attempts at coercion. The participants unanimously agreed to quickly reduce their dependence on China for rare earths.

China is particularly subjecting Japan to economic pressure. Taking issue with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's reasonable remarks regarding a Taiwan emergency, Beijing has responded by tightening export controls on dual-use goods, including rare earths.

# A Unified Response

International cooperation will help Japan respond resolutely to such Chinese pressure in the short term. Looking ahead, Tokyo should actively help the international community build long-term supply chains that are not dependent on China.

Finance Minister [Satsuki Katayama](https://japan-forward.com/tag/satsuki-katayama/) explained Japan's position at the meeting, while calling on China to withdraw its coercive measures. The participating countries account for 60% of the world's demand for critical minerals. At the same time, resource-rich countries such as Australia also attended the meeting. The significance of this collaboration is tremendous.

Reports also indicate that China is supplying the world with cheap rare earths, mined and processed under poor working conditions and lax environmental measures. The meeting discussed the creation of a new market to establish a supply chain that does not rely on China. This market would be subject to international standards for labor conditions and human rights. 

The finance ministers also discussed a system to set minimum prices for critical minerals. The objective would be to secure profits for producers who are exposed to price competition from Chinese products. Hopefully, this will develop into a long-term initiative. For that to happen, clarification is needed as to what each participating country needs to do, including in terms of its tax system and fiscal measures.

# Japan's Contribution

Japan, in particular, has room to make a significant contribution.

Sixteen years ago, in 2010, China imposed restrictions on rare earth exports to Japan. Learning from this experience, Tokyo has promoted a shift in the source of its rare earth needs away from China. As a result, Japan's dependence on China for rare earths has fallen from 90% at that time to 60% today.

The Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security, [JOGMEC](https://japan-forward.com/tag/jogmec/), and Sojitz Corporation have teamed up with an Australian company to begin importing highly scarce heavy rare earth elements from Australia. There are also plans for JOGMEC and other Japanese entities to work with French companies to import heavy rare earths. 

Furthermore, a government-led project to test drill for ""rare earth mud"" from the seabed off the coast of [Minamitorishima](https://japan-forward.com/tag/minamitorishima/) has just begun. That island is part of the [Ogasawara Islands](https://japan-forward.com/tag/ogasawara-islands/), which are under the administration of Tokyo, although they are 1,000 kilometers south of the capital.

Hopefully, knowledge from these initiatives will be effectively employed to enhance Japan's [economic security](https://japan-forward.com/tag/economic-security/).

“The Middle East has oil,” Deng Xiaoping is reported to have remarked. “China has rare earths.”

Deng was visiting one of China’s biggest rare earths mines, in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, in 1992 when he made that observation about the vast deposit of critical minerals in his country. At that time, no one took his statement seriously – except the Chinese leadership and Chinese Communist Party. 

Beijing had shown its interest in the importance of rare earths as a strategic asset by including it in early Deng-era [national planning documents ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338434338_China's_public_policies_toward_rare_earths_1975-2018)(1981-1985) of its five-year plan.

Deng’s vision and American missteps combined to give China what is today a huge critical edge.

# Mining and processing are the hard parts – not finding

The [17 critical metallic elements](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Periodic-table-highlighting-critical-elements-and-ore-components-defined-as-critical_fig1_368630996) in the middle of the periodic table that are grouped under the term rare earth elements make up the invisible backbone of the modern technological world. Smartphones, electric vehicles, wind turbines, military drones and even sophisticated aerospace systems (F-35) and radar all depend on rare earth elements.

Rare earth minerals aren’t rare. They are called “rare” because they are highly unlikely to be found in pure form or in economically viable high concentrations in nature. 

These minerals are either dispersed or mixed with other minerals, making it challenging and costly to extract and refine them. The process is also not environmentally friendly. The difficulty is precisely what fuels their strategic importance.

# Dirty work 

The Chinese didn’t decide to dominate the rare earth years ago. The US and others in the West decided to dump the “dirty work” and China became the one left doing it.

Until the 1980s, the United States was the world’s leading producer of rare earth minerals, but the Americans gradually shifted the production to China, enticed by lower environmental standards and lower labor costs.

In 1980, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency  
tightened regulatons on rare earth elements, terming them “source material.” That made handling the elements and disposing of byproducts [too expensive to do domestically](https://thoriumenergyalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/TrilateralEUUSJAPAN.pdf).

By 1996, America had outsourced so much mining of minerals – including rare earths – that Congress as a cost-saving measure had seen fit to [shut down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bureau_of_Mines) the US Bureau of Mines, the government’s main regulatory and research agency focused on the mining industry.

As the US stepped back, China picked up the slack and learned the rare earths craft. It accepted the environmental burden and channeled massive resources into developing its rare earths industry.

Apart from having the highest reserve of rare earth elements ( 44 million metric tons ) in the world, China currently controls approximately 70% of global rare earth mining production,  85% of refining and [98](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare-earth_element?utm_source=chatgpt.com)% of processing capacities worldwide.

Today China controls 80% of the rare earths patents. China has [39](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/business/rare-earth-metals-china.html) universities offering training programs in rare earths and seven universities offering courses in rare earths processing. Although institutions such as the [University of Texas](https://www.reportingtexas.com/ut-taking-front-row-seat-in-innovation-in-critical-mineral-resources/) now seek to pick up the challenge, the US presently is far from being in China’s league. All of this makes China’s domination of the industry hard to challenge.

Beijing has seen opportunity and has long supported its rare earths industry, even when it wasn’t immediately profitable creating a self-sufficient, world-leading ecosystem. It has made a strategic choice to nurture this industry and maintain leadership in production, refining and processing. Washington and the West have overlooked this industry for decades, but it was always there in the background of globalization. 

A moment of realization occurred to the US in  April 2025 during the trade war. After the White House raised [tariffs](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/trump-raises-tariffs-on-china-to-145-overview-and-trade-implications/) on Chinese goods to 145%, Beijing retaliated by imposing export controls on seven types of rare earths and magnets. The export controls that China put in place on [April 4th ](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/) gave an indication of the pain it could inflict on the US and its pace of innovation.  

Rare earths accounted for only a tiny share of China’s exports to the US but they are used in the most critical sector of the US economy. So the April move, while causing relatively little economic pain in the US, provoked an outcry from American defense manufacturers.

The point is that rare earths have become one of China’s most powerful bargaining chips. China plays its rare-earths card as an ace when the US presses on chip sanctions. 

# China’s chokehold on America innovation 

In 2024, a study by RAND Corporation warned that a rare earth supply disruption lasting just 90 days could shut down production lines at 78% of US defense contractors. After China’s retaliations, two rounds of high-level negotiations followed. They led to a 90-day truce between Washington and Beijing, giving indication that America does have a choke point.

This dependency goes beyond defense to include cutting-edge technology in which America is a leader such as next generation computing, robotics, medical devices and quantum hardware. It’s a kill switch. Today American innovation is determined by China-controlled supply chains and export measures. Chinese government approval for using rare earth magnets in the US or other military is a strategic leverage point.

Today Rare earth elements aren’t just commodities. They are, from any nation’s perspective, strategic assets shaping the geopolitical landscape. For any nation in the world, securing its future is essential for economic stability, technological advancement and national security.

# And that gets us to Greenland

Donald Trump’s interest in Canada and Greenland is by no means accidental. Both countries sit on vast reserves of rare earth minerals. Greenland’s Kanana region holds some of the world’s richest deposits of heavy elements such as disprosium and terbium. A 2023 [survey](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/greenlands-rich-largely-untapped-mineral-resources-2025-01-13/) showed that 25 of 34 minerals deemed “critical raw materials” by the European Commission were found in Greenland.

But according to RAND estimates it will take the US at least a decade or more and $10-to-$15 billion to build a self-sufficient rare earths supply chain. How America approaches the rare earths strategy in the near future will be a litmus test for the kind of nation it wants to be in decades ahead. But even if everything goes smoothly and all the complications are properly addressed, the outcome is far from guaranteed. 

[Engineering new supply chains](https://californiacurated.com/2025/01/29/the-mountain-pass-mine-in-california-may-be-the-u-s-rare-earths-game-changer/) isn’t just a question of finding a new mine. It requires entire ecosystems for extraction, refining, production and downstream applications. China has taken more than four decades to get where it is today. Interestingly, China has pushed the purity standard from 98% to 99.9999%. Higher purity means better cutting edge technology. 

There is no doubt that it’s Deng’s pragmatic vision – whether it’s a white cat or a black cat, if it catches mice it’s a good cat – that shapes China’s fortunes. Oil was the white cat for America and rare earths will be the black cat for China – but what Deng forgot to add is that the cat that catches the mice fastest will be the best cat.

Today in the AI and automation economy, rare earth minerals – not oil – will be the backbone of the global economy. Whichever controls the supply will be the fastest cat driving innovation.

# Jan. 23rd, 2026~ Saudi Arabia says it has $2.5 trillion in mineral reserves. That could make it a key player in the race for rare earths

[Saudi Arabia says it has $2.5 trillion in mineral reserves. That could make it a key player in the race for rare earths | CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/23/middleeast/saudi-arabia-minerals-investment-spc)

Minerals are back in the news, with President Donald Trump [announcing on Wednesday](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/22/business/greenland-rare-earth-minerals-trump) that he’d reached an agreement on a possible deal on Greenland that would include rights to rare earth minerals.

Critical and [rare earth minerals](https://cnn.com/2025/10/30/business/rare-earth-minerals-deal) underpin technologies propelling the clean energy transition, AI and advanced military hardware, among others, and their production is dominated by China. It controls [over 90% of the world’s output of refined rare earths](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/business/rare-earth-minerals-deal) and over 60% of rare earth mining production, according to the International Energy Agency.

Speaking to CNN last week at the Future Minerals Forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Abigail Hunter, executive director of the Minerals Center at SAFE (Securing America’s Future Energy), a nongovernment organization, described China as “light years ahead” of the US, “through decades of strategic investments, state-backed projects and coordination with the private sector, and investing internationally.”

But now Saudi Arabia is growing its mineral sector, to reduce its economic dependence on oil and, according to analysts, increase its geopolitical influence.

Saudi claims it has [$2.5 trillion in mineral reserves](https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/en/media/articles/saudi-arabia-s-supply-chain-playbook). These include gold, zinc, copper and lithium, but also rare earth deposits, including dysprosium, terbium, neodymium and praseodymium, which are used in everything from electric cars and wind turbines to high-speed computing.

Saudi Arabia’s budget for exploratory mining increased 595% between 2021 and 2025, [per S&P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/research/2026/01/vision-2030-how-mining-could-power-saudi-arabias-new-economy) (though it is still modest by the standards of advanced mining nations like Canada and Australia). Licensing new mining sites to domestic and international companies has gathered pace.

But exploration is one thing, end product is another. “The reality is mining is a really long game,” said Hunter. “It takes three to five years to build a processing plant. It can take up to 29 years in some jurisdictions.”

The nation is cutting red tape, reducing tax rates for mining investment and intends to spend big to catch up with established players.

At the Future Minerals Forum, state-owned mining company Maaden announced it would invest $110 billion in metals and mining over the next decade, including entering into international partnerships and attracting industry talent. “We’re humble enough to realize we can’t do it alone,” said Maaden CEO Bob Wilt, speaking at the event.

The value of Saudi Arabia’s minerals still pales in comparison to the value of its oil ([Saudi has the second largest proven reserves in the world](https://www.opec.org/assets/assetdb/asb-2025.pdf)). But there are other reasons the nation is investing in the sector.

Saudi’s Vision 2030 plan aims to diversify the country’s economy and names mining as a key pillar. Its plan goes beyond just mining minerals and includes building out its supply chain for domestic industries — for example, the nation has set [ambitious targets for electric vehicle manufacturing](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/03/business/saudi-arabia-electric-vehicles-eviq-hnk-spc).

Experts say Saudi’s growing infrastructure could also position the country as a regional hub for refining critical minerals mined elsewhere.

“Looking to the Global South and partnering with African countries … logistically, it makes a lot of sense for us to be able to process more minerals here,” said Hunter.

Saudi Arabia’s ambitions have drawn the interest of the US. In the past, after extracting its own heavy rare earths, the US has [sent material to China](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/business/rare-earth-minerals-deal) for refining. Last year, China tightened export controls on heavy rare earths, [many of which have military applications](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/20/business/china-rare-earth-export-controls-analysis-intl-hnk).

Last November, during a state visit to Washington, Saudi Arabia announced it would invest up to [nearly $1 trillion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-solidifies-economic-and-defense-partnership-with-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia/) in US infrastructure, technology and industry. Part of that deal included a bilateral collaboration on minerals. US company MP Materials (which is backed by the Pentagon) announced that it would partner with Maaden and the US Department of Defense to build a new refinery in Saudi Arabia, [which would be 49% owned by MP Materials and the Department of Defense](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-and-the-U-S--Department-of-War-Partner-with-the-Saudi-Arabian-Mining-Company-Maaden-to-Develop-Rare-Earth-Refinery-Joint-Venture/default.aspx).

Brendan Smialowski\/AFP via Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/3syent5rw2fg1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff826ecdb5a25bda3ccf3bbbfe3366ccc129f6e3)

Melissa Sanderson, co-chair of the Critical Minerals Institute, a think tank, said that Saudi Arabia’s biggest asset as a processing hub is its “reliable quantities of energy,” along with the expertise of state-owned energy company Aramco, which could develop improved refining methodologies, “potentially displacing China as a lower-cost, more environmentally friendly processor,” she speculated.

Its environmental credentials remain to be seen. Saudi Arabia was among a group of resource-rich countries who at the recent United Nations Environment Assembly opposed part of a draft resolution of a treaty [seeking greater supply chain transparency](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2025/12/12/push-for-global-minerals-deal-meets-opposition-more-talks-agreed/) and to limit the environmental harm of mining.

Sanderson indicated that its transition to a mining hub may not all be smooth sailing. Instability in the Middle East remains a challenge, along with a mixed bag of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and African nations with mineral wealth. That said, the kingdom could turn to Central Asian countries with their own deposits, where Aramco has longstanding relationships, she said.

“In many ways, the economic transformations underway (in Saudi Arabia) are designed more to elevate the political standing of the country … (to) an essential player — a pivot point, if you will — in a geopolitical scenario,” said Sanderson.

“This is not a game about immediate return,” she added. “This is a strategy about long-term power and long-term influence and long-term gain.”

# NioCorp Isn’t Building a Mine — It’s Building a Strategic Backbone for U.S. Industrial Power

**The market is still treating NioCorp like a speculative junior miner. That framing is no longer just outdated — it’s strategically blind.** What’s emerging around Elk Creek is not a commodity project, but a vertically aligned critical materials platform synchronized with U.S. national priorities. ***Pentagon funding is already in, EXIM financing discussions are real, the updated assays and pending DFS are strengthening credibility, and federal industrial policy is screaming for exactly what Elk Creek produces: Scandium, Niobium, Titanium, and defense-relevant rare earths. This isn’t retail hype — this is structural alignment with national security, aerospace, naval manufacturing, advanced energy systems, and next-generation weapons platforms!***

[For 30 years, every aerospace, EV, and defense prime has said the same thing about scandium: “We can’t design Sc-Al alloys into next-gen systems until there’s a reliable U.S. supply.” & “ We can’t build a U.S. supply until someone commits to using the alloys.” That deadlock is exactly what stalled the entire U.S. scandium industry… until now. \~Niocorp just broke the loop. NioCorp solved SCANDIUM'S \\""The Chicken or the Egg problem!\\"" & are working to produce alloys to make \\""STUFF!\\""](https://reddit.com/link/1qko4ub/video/az3kcpy7z2fg1/player)

**Where this becomes transformative is Scandium.** Selling scandium oxide is one business. **Owning the downstream ScAl alloy ecosystem is an entirely different one. With NAMA launched, FEA IP acquired, Lockheed engagement, DoD interest, and partners like Creative Engineers and Nanoscale entering the orbit, NioCorp is positioning itself not as a raw material supplier but as a critical materials manufacturer.** That shift moves the company up the value chain: higher margins, strategic lock-in, long-term contracts, and industrial indispensability. This is the difference between being a vendor and being infrastructure. If scandium becomes foundational to aerospace structures, additive manufacturing, hypersonics, and survivable platforms **— and all signs say it will —** then Elk Creek is not just a mine. It becomes the domestic anchor of an entirely new materials class.

**This is why MP Materials is the wrong comparison — and yet still proves the point.** MP trades as a strategic asset despite being largely a single-lane business centered around magnets & magnet REEs. **NioCorp offers Niobium (steel and superalloys), Scandium (aerospace ScAl alloys), Titanium alloys & products, defense-critical REEs for magnets & future magnet recycling (already piloted!) — with growing downstream integration**. That’s not a one-trick pony. That’s a multi-vertical critical materials portfolio aligned with defense, infrastructure, aerospace, and advanced manufacturing. IMHO\~ **If MP commands strategic multiples on future magnet revenues alone, then a fully executing NioCorp deserves to be valued as something far more comprehensive.**

**The conclusion isn’t hype —** it’s structural logic. Supported by federal alignment, defense relevance, and vertical integration, will not remain priced like a forgotten microcap forever. **Repricing doesn’t happen because sentiment changes — it happens when reality becomes unavoidable.** And if Elk Creek delivers as positioned by management, NioCorp doesn’t just become a successful miner. It becomes the closest thing the U.S. has to a **Saudi Arabia of Scandium and Advanced Critical Materials** — and the market will eventually be forced to price it that way.

**This is why EXIM, DoD, and Tier-1 primes are in deep discussions —** they need a fully domestic, fully integrated producer, and NioCorp is already architected to deliver exactly that.

***This is how you rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty —*** not one metal at a time, but with a single project that brings SEVEN critical minerals into four critical defense mineral chains back onshore at once!

**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.** The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it. And the global critical-mineral bottleneck is about to meet its first American challenger in decades.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

And the worst part is I f\*cked up on purpose. Like I woke up and chose embarrassment. I been feeling broke lately, not even gonna lie. Not like “I’m homeless” broke, more like “I open my banking app and it laughs at me” broke. And then you know how it is… you see people online looking clean, nice fit, fancy coffee, acting like they got a finance team. And your brain starts doing that dumb thing like “bro you can do that too.” No you can’t. But I still tried.

So I’m going out, right? Nothing serious. Just like… regular day. But I’m like nah, today I’m gonna look like I got money. Like I’m one of those dudes that casually says “my accountant” in a sentence. So I put on my best clothes. Not even new clothes, just the ones I treat like they special. I’m standing in the mirror like I’m somebody. I’m feeling myself for no reason. I’m like okay okay, we not broke today, we just “minimalist.”

Then I’m thinking, rich people don’t eat at regular spots. Rich people go places where the menu don’t have pictures. So I pick this kinda fancy place. The type of place where the chairs look expensive and the waiter talks soft like he’s judging you politely. I walk in like I belong there. Bro I was acting. Like Oscar level acting. I sit down, I’m trying to look calm, like this is normal for me. It’s not.

I open the menu and instantly I’m confused. Everything got names like “artisanal” and “infused” and “hand-crafted” like bro it’s chicken, relax. And the prices… the prices was talking crazy. Like every number was disrespectful. But I already sat down. And in my head I’m like “don’t be that guy.” You know the guy who walks out after seeing the prices. So I’m stuck there now like a clown with confidence.

Waiter comes over. This dude is nice but also he got that look like he can smell poverty. He’s like “How are we doing today?” and I’m like “We’re great.” WE. Like I got a team. Like I’m a company. I don’t know why I said “we.” It’s just me and my stress.

He asks if I want something to drink. And I’m trying to be fancy so I don’t say water. I don’t know why. Water is free and water is normal. But my brain is like “rich people don’t say water.” Rich people say stuff like sparkling whatever, so I’m like yeah I’ll take some… sparkling water. Cool. Whatever. He brings it and it’s in this glass like it’s sacred. I take one sip and I’m like… this tastes like TV static. But I’m nodding like “mm yes.”

Now it’s time to order food. I don’t wanna pick the cheapest thing, because my ego is driving. So I pick something that sounds expensive but I don’t even know what it is. I’m just reading words like “truffle” and “aioli” like I’m fluent. Then I add an appetizer too because I’m still pretending. I’m like “yeah bring that too.” BRO WHY. I literally watched myself do it like I was possessed.

Food comes. It’s… small. Like small small. Like if you blink you miss it. I’m sitting there like “this is it?” But I gotta act like it’s normal. So I take pictures of it like an influencer. I’m holding my phone in the air like an idiot. I’m trying to get the angle. Meanwhile the people around me are eating normal like adults. I’m over here doing a photoshoot for a plate that looks like it belongs in a museum.

Then the real f\*ck up starts.

I’m done eating, still hungry, but whatever. Waiter comes with the check. I’m still acting rich. I grab the check like “yeah okay.” Then I look at the total and my soul left my body. Like my stomach dropped. Like I saw a ghost. I’m not even being dramatic, I felt heat in my face. I’m like… there’s no way. This meal costs more than my groceries. For like… two bites and a sad soda water.

So now I’m stuck. Because if my card declines, I’m gonna pass away on the spot. I start doing math in my head like I’m NASA. I’m checking my bank app under the table like it’s a drug deal. I’m moving money around like a criminal. I’m transferring from savings, from some random account I forgot about, I’m like “please God just one time.” My hands sweating. I’m trying to stay calm but I’m literally fighting for my life.

And of course the waiter is standing there with that little machine, smiling, waiting. And I’m like “yep… all good… just one sec.” One sec turned into like 40 seconds. I’m tapping, refreshing, tapping, refreshing. And then I finally run the card.

It declines.

BROOOOOOO.

Not like a quiet decline either. That machine made a noise. Like a loud little “NOPE.” The waiter’s smile changed. Not even rude, just like… “ah.” Like he already knew. I wanted to evaporate. I’m looking around like maybe the lights will shut off and the building will collapse and I can escape.

I start stuttering. I’m like “oh that’s weird, let me try again.” Acting like it’s the machine’s fault. Like yeah bro, the machine is broke, not your wallet. I try again. Declines again. I swear I heard my ancestors sigh.

At this point I’m like okay, plan B. I use another card. Declines. Plan C: I pretend I got a call and run away. Just kidding… kinda. I’m panicking. I tell the waiter “I think my bank locked my card” which is partially true because my bank is like “why are you spending like you got it?” It’s literally fraud… but the fraud is me.

So I’m sitting there, cheeks hot, trying to look calm while I’m dying inside. Then I had to do the most humbling thing ever… I called someone. Like “yo can you send me some money real quick.” That call felt like I was asking for bail. I’m whispering like it’s a secret.

1qko3g4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtOfPresence/comments/1qko3g4/stop_scrolling_start_doing_11_psychological/,"Stop scrolling, start DOING: 11 psychological tricks to actually stay focused","

We all want to focus. But today, *everyone* feels constantly distracted. Work hours are blended with YouTube breaks, phone checks, mental fog. It's not because you're lazy or broken. It's because the world is now engineered to collapse your attention span. There’s a reason TikTok is worth billions while your to do list sits untouched.

This post isn’t about shaming you into discipline or repeating TikTok beloved BS like  wake up at 5 AM or you’re a loser.  This is a compact, science backed, no fluff guide. Pulled from top research, books like *Deep Work* by Cal Newport, *Stolen Focus* by Johann Hari, and top neuroscience podcasts with heavyweights like Andrew Huberman. These *psychological tweaks* actually work because they’re rooted in how your brain functions. And yeah, you can train it.

Here’s how to actually stay focused:

  **Kill multi tasking at the root.** Your brain doesn’t really  multi task  – it switches rapidly, which burns cognitive energy like crazy. A study from Stanford showed multitaskers performed worse on focus, retention, and task switching. Single tasking is not inefficient. It’s oxygen for your brain.

  **Use your environment as a remote control for focus.** Don’t rely on willpower. Behavioral scientist Katy Milkman suggests  temptation bundling  – pair a habit you want (like working) with a reward (like music or a nice coffee). Also, hide your damn phone. A University of Texas study found that just having your phone in the same room reduced available cognitive capacity.

  **Time block like it's your job.** Cal Newport popularized this in *Deep Work*. Don’t  try to focus.  Schedule it. 10 12 PM = focused work, no questions. Your brain starts to expect it  like Pavlov’s bell, but for productivity.

  **Work in sprints, not marathons.** Follow the 52/17 rule. Based on productivity app DeskTime’s research, the most productive users worked for 52 minutes, then rested for 17. Not 90 minute ultra marathons, but intense short bursts.

  **Start your day with the  ugly frog. ** From Brian Tracy’s classic *Eat That Frog*. Tackle your hardest or most important task first. Your willpower is highest early in the day. You delay it, it dies.

  **Reduce cognitive load with to do clarity.** Don’t say  work on project.  Say  write intro paragraph.  Your brain loves clear instructions. The Zeigarnik effect shows we remember incomplete tasks better than complete ones. So get specific.

  **Add artificial urgency.** Set fake deadlines, public accountability, or use apps like Focusmate (you co work with strangers on video in silence). Creates social pressure without needing a boss breathing down your neck.

  **Train dopamine, not just discipline.** Huberman Lab explains dopamine is about *pursuit*, not just pleasure. Celebrate progress, not outcomes. Check off boxes, track your streak, make progress visible and satisfying.

  **Limit novelty seeking.** Your brain LOVES new stuff. But it pays with attention. A 2022 study from the Journal of Experimental Psychology found people underestimate how much switching tasks reduces productivity. Stick to one mental context as long as possible.

  **Use  implementation intentions. ** Instead of saying  I’ll work later,  say  if it’s 2 PM, then I’ll write for 45 mins.  This came from psychologist Peter Gollwitzer’s work showing these plans double your chance of following through.

  **Sleep like your life depends on it.** Because it kinda does. Matthew Walker’s *Why We Sleep* makes it clear: sleep deprivation cuts your focus, memory, and creativity in half. You’re working at 50% if you’re sleeping <6 hours.

All of this is learnable. Focus is like a muscle. It atrophies with TikTok shorts, but it grows fast when exercised right. We’re not wired to work like machines. But we *can* train our brains to work with rhythm, purpose, and clarity.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qknyic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Australian_Muslims/comments/1qknyic/an_athiests_islam_journey_pt_3/,An Athiests Islam Journey: Pt 3,"So over the last few weeks, I have learned heaps. Islam is a religion that I am starting to fall in love with because there are so many positive qualities. There is so much more to learn.

Something I am really excited about is I am going to visit the Islamic Society of Albury Wodonga’s open day tomorrow, which I think will be amazingly insightful and will teach me heaps. For once the free sausage sizzle is not my motivation to attend an event.

But back to me falling in love with the religion, the reasons being is the religion shares a lot of great qualities I’ve tried to make the effort to practice just to be a decent human being (I am definitely not saying I am perfect, I am far from it). A lot of the qualities of Islam would make the world a better place if the world followed just those qualities (I’m definitely not going to push a religion onto someone).

Since I have started learning more, my Instagram feed has changed dramatically, with a lot of information coming from both Muslim born and Muslim reverts, which normally wouldn’t be an important distinction to make. This information has been very useful, especially the information from the reverts.

I am not saying I am reverting now, but I told myself going into this experience what ever happens happens. At the start, that was if I found Muslims to be bad people (which my initial perception was the vast majority were decent) then that was my findings or if I found my initial perception to be true then that was also my findings. But as I am now learning more about the religious practices and reverting, I can tell you which way I am leaning.

Another thing I am doing is I have started reading the Quran. Now I am only a handful of pages in, so I am not going to comment my opinions until I have read enough to start forming opinions.

I will hopefully be attending another open day that a fellow redditor has mentioned to me, I believe that was in Dandenong on 7/2/26.

After tomorrow, I will be sharing some of my thoughts and comments to my personal social media, which I will copy and share into this reddit.

Now if anyone wants to reach out and discuss anything I have mentioned in this sub so far or introduce me further to Islam, feel free to reach out. If there is people against Islam in this group as well, feel free to try and convince me otherwise as well (using credible references, not because Pauline said so). If anyone is at the Albury Wodonga or Dandenong open days, please feel free to introduce yourselves to me. I do hope to attend more in the future as I continue this learning journey. Who knows what happens in the future, it might change from a learning journey to a reverting journey.

Before I go, I would love to have some in person contacts as well. I would love the opportunity to have real conversations and discussions. I regularly visit Sydney, Melbourne, Wagga, and Albury/Wodonga, with Canberra being very accessible. If you are willing to grab a coffee or something and just talk about everything with me, please reach out.

For my thesis I had to do some lab work and the Professor who looks after my thesis was too busy to help me, so he sent out a Doctor (34M) he was mentoring. I knew the Doctor, because he ran a few labs and lectures for my degree. We hit off immediately- we joked, laughed so much, the work in the lab went incredibly smoothly, everything was so well put together, well organized and simply fun. Overall, we spent two weeks together in the lab by ourselves. At first, he admitted he wants to take me out for a coffee date after I'm done with my Masters degree, because he wouldn't want to risk mine nor his career. I joked and said he'd have to wait a few more years and he asked why. He thought I was a few years older and about to be done with my Masters and being a student at the Uni. Once I told him that I'm only 23 and about to start my Masters soon, he was a bit surprised, but just laughed it off with saying ""guess I'm waiting a bit longer for that coffee date"". The thing is, the first week was a bit flirty, but overall light and fun. On week two we started having deep talks about life, politics, love life, preferences when it comes to life, money etc. We shared some personal stories, which maybe would be considered unprofessional, but tbh it was all in an appropriate manner. We curse around each other since beginning of lab, so this boundary has been crossed off very quickly. We never talked about anything inappropriate or sexual. The thing is, the chemistry started to grow. He isn't bad looking. A cute nerdy Doctor, who has a huge potential if he took better care of himself. I found myself fantasizing about helping him take care of himself, hanging out with him, calling him and talking to him. I even had thoughts about making out with him and some more extreme ones.

I find myself excited to see him, talk to him and work with him in the lab. I want to get a PhD, so obviously nothing will happen between us but I've been getting more and more interested in him and the fantasies are getting a bit wilder.",5,1769166141.0,TrueOffMyChest,5,0.86,False

Let’s talk about something that sounds like the most boring copyright lecture on Earth, but is actually a high-stakes battle for the survival of your ideas. This is the story of how Big Tech turned the Open Source movement into their own private, free research laboratory.

*The ""Pure Thought"" Trap!*  
Let’s start with a brutal truth: Your brilliant mathematical equation? Not patentable. Your elegant code? It’s just text, protected like a poem or a cookbook. Patent law says: ""You want protection? Build a machine!"" You have to touch the physical world, and that creates a massive canyon called R&D (Research and Development).  
The road from an idea to a dollar is bumpy simulation (organizing the chaos),PoC (proving it actually works), pilot and prototype (testing in the trenches), production (where the money is).  
Every single one of these steps devours time and cash. Enter Open Source—the cheapest development model in the world, fueled by passion and shared interest. But for Big Tech, it’s not just a ""beautiful idea."" It’s an opportunity.

*The ""Cheap Sponsor"" Strategy?*  
Instead of spending billions on their own R&D departments, corporations just git clones. They become ""sponsors""—paying for servers or throwing a few pennies at training sessions. This is coffee money in exchange for outsourcing innovation.  
The secret sauce is the License Game,as follows:  
*MIT / Apache 2.0:* Big Tech loves these. They let them take your code, lock it in a black box, and sell it as their own without sharing a single tweak.  
*GPL:* This is ""viral"" protection. If a company uses it, they have to show their cards. This is why giants push permissive licenses—they want to harvest your PoC and then patent the physical hardware around it, giving you nothing in return.

*How the Giants Do It!*  
Look at Google and Android. The foundation is open (AOSP), which lets them use the community's free labor. But on top, they layer a closed wall of ""Google Mobile Services"" (GMS). Without that layer, the phone is a paperweight. It’s ""openness"" under total control.  
Or look at Microsoft. They used to hate Linux; now they ""love"" Open Source. Why? Because they bought GitHub. Now they see your every move, every simulation, before you even finish it. They built Copilot, which trains on your free code to sell it back to you as a subscription. It’s the mass-scale recycling of your intellectual labor.

*How to Not Get ""Absorbed""?*  
Since you can't patent the math, your only weapon is strategic knowledge management. **Here is your defense plan:**  
The Onion Strategy: Release the core (the math) as Open Source—that’s your advertisement. But keep the Technological Layer (the specific implementation parameters) a trade secret.  
Dual Licensing: Use the AGPL. Big Tech hates it because if they use it in the cloud, they have to share back or pay you for a commercial license. This funds your R&D.  
Controlled PoC: Show what your system can do, but don’t show exactly how to tune it. Open Source should be the hook, not the whole fishing rod.  
Protect the ""Know-How"": The most expensive thing in the world is knowing why something didn't work. Your failed simulations and the fixes you found are your unique expertise. Don’t document those in a public repo—make them pay for that brilliance.

*Why It Matters?*  
We live in a world where the most powerful systems of our civilization rely on the work of volunteers, while the richest companies on Earth make sure that the river of free knowledge never runs dry. It’s a brilliant, but brutally one-sided symbiosis. Big Tech isn't building the future—they’re adopting it at a fraction of the cost.  
Your goal is to be too ""hard to copy"" without your involvement. Open Source should be your calling card, not a wrapped gift for someone who can already afford their own research.

Big Tech has spent decades convinced they own the playground because they bought the land. But they forgot one thing: they don't own the kids, and they definitely don't own the games. We’re moving from 'free for all' to 'strategic sharing.' If you want our breakthroughs, stop looking for the 'clone' button and start looking for your checkbook. The party's over, big bears. It's time to pay the tab.

*So, How Do We Fix This? (The Resistance)*  
We can’t change patent law overnight, but we can change how we play the game. If you want to stop being a free R&D department, you need to be strategic:  
Weaponize Your Licenses: Stop defaulting to MIT/Apache. If you want to force Big Tech to contribute back (or pay up), use AGPLv3. It’s the ""kryptonite"" of proprietary cloud silos. If they run your code on their servers, they have to share their secrets.  
The ""Core-and-Cloud"" Model: Open-source the mathematical core, but keep the ""industrial settings""—the specific simulation parameters and the ""how-to-not-explode"" guide—as a trade secret or a paid consulting service.  
Stop the ""Data Bleed"": Be careful where you build. Using ""free"" corporate dev-tools is like building your lab inside the enemy's headquarters. Support independent infrastructure that doesn't treat your PoC as training data for their next AI product.  
Demand ""Real"" Sponsorship: A few free credits on their cloud platform isn't a partnership—it's a trap to make you dependent. Demand funding that covers your time, not just their server costs.

Moving into the autumn I started to put back some of the foods I’ve been missing, principally coffee and the odd pastry or two ! I didn’t see any reaction at all so carried on in moderation. Coming into Christmas 2025 the symptoms were back again but this time much more aggressive, constant phlegm and mucus, coughing and a sore throat. However a new symptom appeared where my chest is really really tight most of the time. I wouldn’t say I was struggling for breath, but it just feels like a band is being tightened around my chest. I had been diagnosed a couple of years back with atopic Asthma, so I’m wondering if the whole thing is connected and what to do next ?  I haven’t been to the GP at this stage as I thought getting back on the diet and change things, but I’m not improving ! I think a visit to the GP is imminent. 

My question to the group is … has anyone experienced a chest tightness like this .. I have to say I sleep quite well and I’ve no symptoms in the night that keep me awake, when I wake the following morning I seem to be symptom-free until I stand and get moving, then it all starts again even before I’ve had breakfast.

last Wednesday we went out for dinner with my family and although she's in a wheelchair and we had to feed her she ate a full plate and was smiling and although confused she was there in parts.

over the weekend was a gradual but definite change every day with less food and water. no interest in coffee which believe me was one of her loops and that was a humongous change. 

by Monday we had called the hospice as she was no bothered about eating and drinking much at all and sleeping nearly all the time. 

by Tuesday we all felt a shift and sat round her in the evening very upset as we really felt a change and her breathing had changed ever so. 

by Wednesday it was hard to get any meds in via yoghurt and we were giving her water in a little syringe that we use for babies calpol.  

yesterday we had hospice carers finally  come and give her a bed bath wash. they said she was very very unwell and then yesterday afternoon we had a syringe driver fitted and now she's sleeping. sometimes fitfully, her arms move a lot and she snores but sometimes her eyes open. 

I think we are very close. my mum went and collected my mil 92 year mum on Wednesday so she's is here now. my wife, her sister and our son and our little dog are all by her bed and pottering around her talking and crying and then laughing. it's so strange.

Despite my best efforts to remain calm, I am absolutely gutted that we have to navigate these challenges. Having gone through similar situations a few times in my career, I know it is a profoundly difficult time, both personally and professionally. This is a process, and an emotional one, where the initial reaction often involves anger, doubt, and hopelessness. But this is always followed by a surge of opportunity, energy, hope, and positivity. We are here to support all of you, not just professionally, but more importantly, on a personal level. Please reach out to me; let's sit down for a coffee and discuss how the Leadership, and our incredible Management team can best support you. This is a small industry, and our professional networks are strong. It's amazing how far a reference or recommendation can go.

I personally feel like I am on a Harvey Dent journey, with one half of me wrestling with the negativity of what we are all enduring, and the other half energized by the endless possibilities for our PAYDAY franchise and in future trajectory. This is going to be the ultimate redemption story. Despite everything, we must redeem ourselves by getting PAYDAY 3 where it needs to be, while simultaneously laying the foundation for WORLD OF PAYDAY. We will kick this off over the next few days, starting with the extensive plans you've built over the last few months. We need to amend, improve, finalize, and execute these. Simultaneously we will begin pre-production for WORLD OF PAYDAY and implement smaller versions of its core game design into PAYDAY 3 to test the waters with our players.

Time is of the essence; we cannot sit idle This is no longer just a job, this is a mission! A mission we are all a vital part of, and one we will be immensely proud to have played a role in. Boiled down to its essence, it’s about acquiring, retaining, and engaging our player base by creating memorable experiences they will treasure for years to come.

I hope you have a good weekend despite the circumstances. Rest up, recuperate, and we will kick off this journey next week!

Onward, and Upwards,

In late **December 2025**, I was flat-hunting and did what thousands of us do: posted in a **Facebook Flat & Flatmates group**. A guy named **Utkarsh Bhamre** replied. He sounded normal. Professional. Helpful.

He sent property photos, details, and said he’d found the place via **99acres.com**. Nothing felt rushed. Nothing felt shady.

I even **visited the property in person**.  
Then I **met Utkarsh face-to-face** at *The Coffee Project in Viman Nagar*. We sat down, talked things through, and decided to proceed. That meeting is the reason my guard was completely down.

Over the next few days, I transferred a total of **₹65,000 across 6 UPI transactions**.  
The money was described as **deposit-related** and one small amount because he said he was temporarily short on balance.

Then the excuses started.

He claimed he had transferred the money onward but that the transaction “reversed.”  
He said his UPI had limits.  
He said he’d “do it in some time.”  
Calls started going unanswered. Messages were seen but ignored.

By **31 December**, things were clearly wrong. I went to the **local police station**, and an officer contacted him directly. After that, Utkarsh finally responded — calm, confident — saying he’d transfer the money shortly.

He didn’t.

On **1 January**, I asked for the full amount back. I even shared a QR code. He said he’d send it.

Nothing came.

While trying to figure out what was going on, I searched his name on Facebook — and that’s when my stomach dropped. I found a **post from someone else alleging the same pattern with the same person**.

At that point, it stopped feeling like a misunderstanding and started feeling like a **pattern**.

The police called him a few times — each time he picked up with the same calm, practiced lines: a new excuse, a promise to transfer “**shortly**,” and a plea about technical limits or reversals. Every call ended the same way: a **fresh reassurance, no money**. At one point the PSI told me privately, “I don’t think he’s in a mindset to return this.” That was the moment it stopped feeling like a mistake and started feeling deliberate. The station tried to help, but without the kind of quick forensic action that freezes accounts, words stayed words.

I’ve preserved **screenshots of all UPI transactions, chats, IDs he shared, and the Facebook post**. Everything has been documented and shared with the appropriate authorities.

You know, places where people talk about sharpening skills or just figuring out daily routines. But early on, I struggled with jumping in without feeling like I was just there to promote myself. It was awkward, and I'd end up lurking more than contributing.

One time, I tried commenting on every post with my 'insights,' but it came off as forced. People stopped responding, and I felt deflated. That pushed me to rethink how I engage. The key, I found, is starting small and being genuinely curious about others. Instead of leading with what I know, I ask about their experiences. Like, if someone shares a tough day with focus, I'll say something like, 'That sounds rough, what helped you push through last time?' It opens doors without me dominating the chat.

Being consistent helps too, but not in an over-the-top way. I show up a couple times a week, share a quick win or fail from my week that relates, and keep it light. For instance, after reading about someone's networking hurdle, I once shared how a casual coffee chat led to a surprising collaboration, but only because it mirrored their story. No agendas, just relating.

Listening is huge. I make it a point to remember details from past threads and follow up later. 'Hey, how did that project turn out you mentioned?' It builds trust over time, and suddenly, conversations flow naturally. I love how this creates a give-and-take, where folks reach out to me too.

of course, it's not perfect. Sometimes I still worry if I'm overstepping, but dialing back and focusing on value for everyone keeps it authentic. This approach has helped me form lasting ties that spill into real opportunities, all without that salesy vibe

# Path 1

**I just got Inno2... Now what?!**

First of all, please don't ping me just to ask general questions about this pin. Ask the chat first The main goal once you get here is to get to Creation 4 Gem. This is a process that can take around 4 months depending on various factors. Full disclosure; this is one of a few different paths. It is the path I took and it worked out well for me. A simple version of the path to Creation 4 basically boils down to the following:

* Inno2 -> Hegemony -> Shorts -> m0-170 medium -> Shorts -> m0-180 -> Shorts -> Creation 4 Run.

Now, here comes a breakdown:

**Inno 2 -> Hegemony**

* So you have unlocked Inno2 Gem, congratulations you are one step closer to suffering (lots and lots of shorts)! If everything went according to plan you should be sitting on around 25-30b Lifetime Orbs. This is a good number unless you chose to take PowGN3, if you took that one you may need a few billion more orbs just to account for the missing GUs. 
* The **goal** of this run is to reach the Hegemony Boon (from now on referred to as Hege) which enables massive progress in the form of Campaign Frags and Orbs min/maxing. 
* Borge Relics are very important at this stage, hitting 2qu HBM/day is a very good goal, but more is obviously better. This is because i75-3 gives a massive boost in power and helps you to hit Hege faster. 
* Other than that my recommended main game relics are around r1-40/41, r8-30 and r20-24/25. This should allow you to get the Inno2 Academy Badge as well which will help you to hit Hege. 
* If you can it is recommended to get Starmie (Campaign Fragment Gadget) to level 60 during this run, as it will greatly improve your shorts, more is obviously better though! 
* Refer to spending plan above. After hitting Hege, you enter a new phase of Shorts quite different from your previous shorts!

**Hege Shorts #1**

If you have Hegemony Boon and decide to respec your Ouroboros ship for a better install loadout, **Install them all ASAP, before running campaigns!!!** (Credit: Farns)

* Right so you just got Hege, now you are going into shorts. These shorts can go anywhere from 48-72h depending on how well you optimise your shorts. 
* The **purpose** of the Post Hege shorts is to get Frags as opposed to Orbs. To achieve this what you need to do is TR at or as close to 100% as possible in order to maximise your frags. 
* The \*Meta\* approach to this is to turn off Automation, Loop Reset and then TR. This is because Hegemony gives you a bonus to Orbs based on how many ship installs you have installed and from now on you want to limit your TR Battery to 100%
* During these shorts, feel free to purchase R9/Orb Gadget however I would be careful with it so as to not blow your req. I also am a firm believer in only using frags you get from that run to purchase r9 and not saving it. However that is a choice that is up to you.

Dahavol has the following to say if you are wanting to \*""Vibe""\* this process:

Immediately after c3-12:

1. Am I at or above 95% of my req? If so take dark loopers and TR immediately after hitting req.
2. Will I be at 95% or more of my req if i take VB4? If so take VB4 and TR immediately after hitting req.

* If you don't want to vibe it, you will need to use the TR Planner found here: [https://cifi-tools.com/tools/tr-planner](https://cifi-tools.com/tools/tr-planner)
* If you push higher than 100% you start to impact how many shorts you can do, so if you are wanting to optimise your runs you want to avoid this. You can manipulate your Battery by doing a LR and manually doing installs until you hit 100%.

I recommend working towards the following GUs during your shorts:

* Cradle Power9-10 / Heph Power 5 / Zeus Power 3 / Crea Shard 9
* Don't forget Borge/Ozzy GU
* 7 Cells/5 Shards/4 MP/3 RP on Inno GU.

**M0-170 Medium Run**

* When starting this run you should be at around around 12m frags, main game around r1-44\~46/r8-31\~32/r20-29\~30 
* Eventually you will get to a point where your shorts start to slow down. This will happen naturally and you will know when it is coming. 
* At this stage you will need to do a medium run pushing to m0-170. This will give you a boost in short potential but also increase your frag gains. 
* During this run you normally push your RP to get some of the Campaign Frag *Dark Researches* (Research 89 level 2 or 3), as well as getting some AMCs (12/9/8). 
* The length of this run will be roughly 100-200h but once it is complete you will go back into shorts again! 
* I would use this run to level Starmie Gadget as well to further boost your next set of shorts! Which will be after this run. If you haven't killed Ozzy boss, now is a good run to get it done!

**Hege Shorts #2**

* This is basically the same as before, however you are going to get more frags and more orbs. 
* Your end point for this is around 300-400b orbs and you should be sitting at or around 15-20m frags depending on how many shorts you do. 
* You will end up at around r9-41 and you should be spending your frags on a mix of Borge and main game. 
* My maingame was around r1-50, r8-35 (some opt for 34) and r20-30 this can be pushed a little bit as well. I wouldn't go higher than 35 but this could be spreading frags thin and neglecting borge. 
* An important reminder to keep your req at or as close to 100% as possible to maximise frags

**M0-180 Run/Power 2 Run**

Now, this is where this path can diverge. You have two options which I will outline below. The first option is to do another mid run to m0-180 and then TR and the second option is to do a mid run to 180 but ending the run when you hit 1t Oo.

**M0-180 Only**

* The benefit of doing this run is that you can get more shorts afterwards. 
* However this option is slightly impacted by TR Count. If you have a higher amount of TRs (43+ for instance) your mileage may vary a bit, however if you have a lower amount of TRs you should be able to get further ahead using this option. 
* I would probably only do up to c3-12 in this run because you don't want to blow out your Orb Req. However you could do 4-9/4-10 if you wanted for the frags but it would be best to calculate the effectiveness of this.

OR

**Power 2 Run**

* If you have a higher TR count (47+), you may end up being locked into doing a run for 1t Orbs to get Power 2. 
* This is the less preferred run but it is what it is. 
* I highly recommend the first option as that will give you more lifetime frags and you will be better off. 
* If doing this run, it will be a run that includes c4-11 allowing you to get both Dark loopers+Void Badge 4.
* Regardless of which option you go for, you will then move into another set of shorts.

**Hege Shorts #3**

* This will be your final set of shorts for probably a long time. 
* The end point of these shorts are what you want it to be, but they start getting longer and longer. 
* You will likely end up around r9-45 and I don't recommend getting 46 as the cost is over 3m frags but your end point should be around 3.5t to 4t Orbs and if you did things well, between 35-40m frags. 
* Your final Short is likely to include C4-11.

GU Purchases I recommend before your next long are:

* Cradle Power 11 / Aux Power 9 / Heph Power 6 / Dem Power 5 / Koi Power 4 / Zeus Power 4 
* Crea Shard 9 / Crea MP 9
* Inno Cells 8 / Inno MP 6 / Inno Shards 5 / Inno RP 4
* Don't forget Borge/Ozzy GU

# Path 2 - Alternate High TR (≥36)

Credit: SinOfDusk

**First inno2 run guide (alternate path)**

Goals of run:

* E4600 mp for hegemony boon
* Re89-3 (camp frag research, research 89 lvl3) 
* AMC goal 12/8/8
* M0-170
* Starmie 70 is ideal (minimum 60)

Hegemony boon is the biggest goal of this TR because it increases your campaign frag income dramatically, you’ll be expecting 700k-1.4m frags per short after this TR. This is an alternate path and complementary reading to the guide above (Caylris detailed guide') for this section of the game.  

This path combines the entire hege run + hege shorts 1 + medium to m0-170 into a single run which should take around 700-900h

Who is this guide for:

* High TR count (I strongly recommend people with TR count ≥ 36 to do this)
* Don’t want to do many shorts
* Entering inno2 with 20-27b orbs
* Achieving hegemony at >500h
* Likely faster (but weaker) than standard path

If you have a low TR count reaching inno2 and come in with a lot of power, you can do 10-20 shorts with the standard path to reach 20-25m frags before your next long at m0-180. This alternate path leaves you with less frags (\~14-16m, less with higher TR count) but can be a lot of faster. If done correctly, you should still have enough frags to reach your goals in the end. 

Details of the run:

Borge 

* The main goal for borge in this TR is to earn 50qu HBM for i75-3. This requires some pre-planning and it is advised to get r4/7/16 = 45-50/45-50/48-55 and borge GU 19-20 as early as possible, ideally during shorts to inno2, to get 50qu in reasonable time. 
* If you are rushing for hegemony, you want to aim for i75-3 within the first 200h of the run. If you are planning a longer inno2 run, you can aim for 400-600h 

Knox 

* Depending on the length of your run and how strong your Knox is, the main goal for Knox this TR is to get starmie 70. This gives a 20% boost to camp frags 
* Unless you can get both anchor 80 + starmie 70 before the end of this TR, I recommend obtaining starmie 70  

Relics 

* Starting main game relics of r1/8/20 = 39/27/21 is advisable 
* You can aim for anywhere between 42-44/29-31/25-27 at the end 

Depending on your game state, there are various bursts that should propel you forwards through the run including: 

* Obtaining new TS when you reach 9/6/6 
* e2960 rp for e50 mp 
* PL960 for 10b tokens 
* e4100 mp G boon 
* e4150 mp Knox mat SoW 
* PL1000 
* Inno2 badge (binno2)

End of TR 

* Since you have pushed your m0 to 170, the number of shorts you can do it limited. However, because you have more frag researches, m0 and starmie, you can get around double the number of frags, around 1.4m per short. 
* From here, you can vibe your shorts or calculate it. 
* You can skip ahead to hege shorts #2 in the above guide (Path 1) where you want to push to 300-400b orbs before you start your next long to m0-180, try to limit yourself to TR45/46 here. 
* Since you only have 12/8/8, you will start out the TR weaker, but should end around the same after 14/9/9. 
* Frag-wise should be around 12.5-16m depending on initial TR count

**Long to m0-180/pow2**

After doing multiple shorts, you now need to push m0 before you can do more shorts. Goals of this TR allows you to reach m0-180 which sets you up for a good base into the next phase of the game. You also unlock a few more valuable tools to push your shorts further

A key advanced strategy that you can use is to minimise orb researches that you grab in order to finish your TR with as low orbs as possible. This allows you to do more shorts after the TR. 

Despite some people calling this the “pow2 unlock run”, your goal is not to get pow2 immediately after this TR. You want to get around 200-300b orbs upon TR and do a few shorts to unlock pow2, this gives you a lot of frags especially with other things you unlock this TR

Pre-requisites:

* Lifetime orbs: 270-350b
* Powheph 5 is a good buy, and powkoi 3 vs powzeus 3 is generally a toss-up for 320-350b range

Goals of this TR:

* Ozzy 300 boss kill, this allows you to build ozzy for crea4
* e5500 mp
* m0-180
* e4155 rp for extra camp frags

Details of run:

Campaigns

* You only want to complete c3-12, then do farms for the rest of the TR
* For some people, c4-9/10 can be considered but this is not a general recommendation. If you’re not sure, avoid them

Main game relics

* You’ll want to have enough main game power to finish this TR in a timely manner
* I recommend calculating approximately how many frags you’ll gain during this TR then aim for relics of r1-48, r8-34, r20-32
* Excess frags beyond these main game benchmarks should be spent on borge
* Avoid upgrading r9 during this TR

Borge

* no major goals, you just want to spend all your frags beyond the above recommendations into r4/r7/r16

Ozzy

* You should aim for ozzy boss kill early in this TR if you haven’t done so during your previous shorts

Knox

* your main goal this TR is to get zap 150 (for ozzy boss kill) -> wrench 160

Main game targets

*  MP: e5500
*  You should hit e5000 mp within the first few days, this is important as it gives you an additional tick which speeds up attgn3
* The chain of burst starts around e5330 mp where you get rule of Zag -> e5350 rule of zeus -> e5380 rule of looping -> e5400 mp
* Pushing to e5400 mp gives you Ichor and Knox mat SoW which should propel you to e5500 mp easily
* Shards: m0-180
* RP: e4155 rp
* Always avoid re90 (pure orb research), this means you should avoid using bulk research after e3490 rp
* Next research you may avoid is the cells + orbs research (re88), however you may need this for end of TR goals
* Both LP+orbs (re85) and mat+orbs (re87) are generally taken unless you have unusual strength due to high frags/ultima/mechs

**End of TR/shorts to 2.5-3.5t**

* This is where you can cash in all your remaining TRs, aiming to finish this set of shorts at TR47-50
* You'll want to finish c3-12 in every short, aiming for 36-48h completion as much as possible. You should upgrade r9/oodget/i78/i101 to keep your shorts actually short and aim for around 100% battery every short
* After finishing the run at around 500-600b lifetime, your goal is to do multiple shorts to unlock pow2
* You will save most of your orbs from the long, spending only the excess orbs on 100b mech cap and borge only if it doesn't delay pow2
* The reason why you want pow2 is because it gives you some orbs from CM47 and also main game power for RP
* Hunter emblems for shorts: 1:4:1:4:2
* RP benchmarks: e3680-3705 rp immediately after your long, e3800 after pow2, e3880 after around 1.7t lifetime orbs
* With your inflated frags, you'll want to push r9 to at least 45 if not 46, rest of the frags go into main game to reach the RP benchmarks and borge
* Once your shorts take >120h and if you're >2.3t orbs, you may consider going for another long TR
* The decision to push for >3t orbs is discussed in the next guide

# Cre4 Unlock Guide

Crea4 costs 6t to unlock, but you also want a decent amount of GUs so that you reach the goals of the next TR otherwise you run the risk of being too weak. To reach the necessary orbs, this should be the first time you complete c4-12 to obtain vb5. Do note that once you take vb5, you lock yourself out of doing shorts for some time.

Pre-requisites:

* Lifetime orbs to start: 2.5-3.5t
* The main difference between high (>3.1t) vs low (2.3-2.7t) orbs is obtaining mission speed at e4520 rp
* You can get mission speed with as low as around 2.7-2.8t orbs but you generally need high hunters/ap mech/frags to reach it
* In order to reach >3.1t orbs, you usually need to do a medium with c4-11 beforehand. You generally lose time by doing the medium despite getting mission speed at the end.
* The main reason to do the medium is to gain the 3-4m extra frags from the additional TR. If you have high lifetime frags (>50m), then doing the medium is generally not worth it
* Main game relics 50/35/32+

For orb spending, please use Adam’s optimiser sheet linked in the megathread or pinned post (Ouroborus gem cost planner)

Expect to spend around 900h to finish c4-12, or around 700h if you hit mission speed

Set-up:

* Trait spheres (14/10/9): all UML + TS16 + TS3
* Hunter emblems: 1/4/4/4/2 cost ratio if aiming for mission speed, 1/4/4/1.5-2/2 if not
* Ouro ship: Max all except tech, remainder into tech

Goals of TR:

* First c4-12 completion and vb5
* m0-185/186
* e5780 mp for coffee, recommend at least 5800 for Stelzi (hunter loot)
* e4465 rp if not aiming for mission speed, e4520 otherwise
* Aim to TR for 13t lifetime orbs

Details of run:

There really isn’t much going on during this run. Just run camps as usual, you may sacrifice f2-3/2-4 while doing up to c4-11 but you generally have both of those running for c4-12 as the extra frags over the long term is helpful. Main game growth is fairly small and unless you’re pushing for mission speed, you don’t need to invest too much here. You’ll get your first m0 at around 500h so don’t panic if nothing is moving until then.

Campaign:

* For low orbs path, you’ll finish c4-12 at around 850-920h. After you maxed attgn3, you need to stay in a single long loop until c4-12 completion which should give you enough time to build for m0-185.
* For high orbs path, you’ll finish c4-12 when you hit e4520 mission speed so try to get it as fast as possible. Do make sure you have enough orb multis otherwise you may end up reaching crea4 with low orbs. M0-186 might be possible for this path, but it is usually not worth it to stay for 186 unless it is close.

Borge:

*  Push borge insc as high as you can reasonably get 
*  If you’re going for mission speed, you’ll want to get 10/10 koi crew as each one gives around e3 rp
* Supplement your final shards with dem crew to hit your desired m0 target, each dem crew gives e1.5 shards
* Make sure you save enough at the end to get i101-3 (1.6sx orb insc)

Ozzy:

* You should be able to reliably farm ozzy 300 boss now
* You’ll want to save almost all your ozzy Galvarium and Vectid emeralds as Crea4 unlocks new trinkets and mechs that you can buy 
* You can stop investing in ozzy after AS 44 and 60/39/47 in DR/evade/EC
* R17-50/51 and zap 150 is adequate for ozzy, spend your frags and tess elsewhere

Knox:

*  Push anchor to 90 then oodget 120
*  Necrum should be around 400b -1t

Frags:

* If you’re aiming for mission speed, you may want r20-33/34 or r1-51 if you are lacking in the end
* R9-46/47 is strongly recommended regardless of path

CMs and UBs:

* You’ll get 2 out of 3 pow2 CMs easily, I recommend taking CM47/48 to start and if you’re strong enough you can get CM46 at the very end of the TR
* While it is possible to get all 3 if you push hard enough, trying to gamble by taking CM46 before 47 is generally not worth it

End of TR:

* Orb multis: oodget 120, i101-3 (1.6sx hbm), i78-6, r9-46/47, m0-185/186
* Aim for a lifetime orb of around 12.5-13t orbs

# Reminder from Calyris

**SAVE YOUR OZZY MATS!!!!**

* Now that I have your attention.... This is more of a PSA than anything but I just wanna remind you all that it is important to save your Ozzy loot during your run to Creation 4! 
* When you get to Creation 4 you will unlock new purchases that are bought with **Galvarium** and **Vectid Crystals**, not Farahyte. So you really want to be saving those two resources!

# Cre4 Run General Statements (not a guide)

Additional to the guide by SinOfDusk above.

Credit: Solacespecs

**Not a guide but some general statements around your Crea4 run (run to unlock Crea4)**

* The run is 750-850 hours
* Around 2.5t - 3.0t seems to be a sweet spot and somewhere around 35m frags.
* You *can* go lower than 2.0t, people have done it and if you're eager to unlock mechs (and hate shorts) you can certainly go anywhere between 1-2t lifetime oo. If you do this you're likely ending around m0-184 on the run and \~7t oo (enough for Crea4 and some light GU spending). This run will be somewhere between 950-1050 hours.
* Caveat here is that shorts are dead once you unlock crea4, so consider if you're leaving any frags on the table if you start the run earlier.
* R1/R8 is somewhere around 50/35 here but base this off what you need for your next m0 milestone (if you need it at all). R20 there's debate here, the first travelers went to r20-35 but if you aren't hitting mission speed anyway, anything around r20-32 is fine. Note there are a handful of project walls in this run as well.

**Mission Speed - Do you go for it or not?**

* This references the e4520 RP x1.50 mission speed bonus, which can be valuable for the run but may be too resource intense to achieve for others
* It's generally true that if you go for Crea4 with anything less than 3t oo, you aren't hitting mission speed. As you get closer to 3.5t, you can expect to hit mission speed towards the end of the run, and you'll save around 70-80 hours. If you did a \~200+ hour ""schedium"" as your final short before this run, you won't be saving time, but you can consider if the additional frags are worth it to you.
* Deciding to go for it or not is an important prep decision. If you don't go for it, you can save RP emblems elsewhere, you have less incentive to invest in r20 beyond the next ultima badge, and you can safely ignore koi crew.
* For the average player, ignoring koi crew will save you quite a bit of HBM to invest elsewhere, especially with the new inscryptions with the Exo 5 patch.
* Koi crew is a 1.95sx investment to reach 10/10 and will give you \~e30 RP and you'll likely want this if you do go for mission speed.

**Goals**

* Unfortunately there's not much to *do* on the run and you’ll largely be checking on your c4-12 progress while waiting for mp breakpoints like rule of productivity.
* Shard-wise you're leaving with m0-185 or m0-186. Dem crew will help with this and is \~1.3sx to 10 crew, so decide how much you want here.
* Orb wise most people are leaving with around 10t and r9 is somewhere around r9-45 or r9-46.
* You can certainly go with lower, or try to gigablast your orb count with r9-47 and one or two of the oo inscryptions, though saving for these will take around 70-80% of the run. If you do this you’ll leave somewhere between 13-16t oo.

**Misc: xUltima // CM Priority // Data Collection**

* If you’re a higher xUtlima player (>x2.0 for the considerations of this data), you likely will hit mission speed.
* You’re also going to have more HBM to play with than the average player, and koi crew 10 is probably a play
* If you’re an all-star spender, you can expect c4-12 to complete around the 650-700 hr range.
* CM wise, you will likely only finish 2 out of the 3. I went CM 48 to start for the hunter loot and CM 47 to finish. Some people may find value in CM 46 if you like the mats.

In the US (at least where I’m from) knitting is a super friendly and engaging community. If I’m seated by someone in public and they are knitting something it is not strange for me to enquire about the project. If I go to a yarn shop  they are eager to chat! What are you knitting? Who is it for? have you tried this yarn? Here’s a technique to try!

That has NOT been my experience in England. I had to buy new knitting things when I moved and I went to several shops and the person working barely said two words to me. I asked for advice on a stitch I was learning and she told me to look up a YouTube video. I have knit next to other women in coffee shops or on the train and we won’t say a word. I know part of this is just cultural - not as chatty with strangers here - but I have found I’m really missing the community aspect of knitting!

Anyone else experienced this or is it just where I am? Does anyone else in the UK wish it was a bit more of a community or am I crazy?

Edit for clarity: I’m not approaching strangers in public and don’t expect anyone to have a convo (nor do I really want that myself) - but I find it fascinating how in the US it would be a sort of friendly connection where you might smile at one another vs. here where you continue to pretend the other person doesn’t exist.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

I've had success in the past with Keto purely for weight loss, losing around 50 pounds.

This last year I've been lifting 4x per week with a bit of cardio and the muscle gain has been very good but I need to start removing the excess fat.

The macro calculator is estimating my body fat at 26% and the FAQ says that I should focus on cutting rather than recomp.

I'm using a spreadsheet to track each meal macros and I've been nailing the targets for the last couple of months since entering ketosis, never going above 20g carbs or overeating.

I have my protein shake and small fat food before the gym and another protein shake after, my main meal then brings me up to my targets and I only drink water, tea and coffee for the rest of the day.

Supplementing sodium, potassium, magnesium citrate, creatine

I'm growing very frustrated because my weight is barely fluctuating, I've lost 2lb in two months and maybe quarter of an inch on waist and hips.

What am I doing wrong, I know that I'm following the plan very closely and feel that fewer calories isn't the way to go, gym performance is still good and I'm still continuing to increase my lifts ?

And, looking at it in this way, the goal is not as important as the means of attaining it: it is not possible- thank God!- to achieve our goal. So it is obvious that I am favourably disposed to compromise. And not because it is useful.

First of all, because I don't know the answers, and in making films I ask questions. Questions and doubts, lack of self-confidence, curiosity and amazement that everything goes on in a natural way- all this puts me in the position of an observer and a listener. I change my script very often- the scenes, dialogues or situations- because I can see that people around me have better ideas, more intelligent solutions. It doesn't disturb me that these are other people's ideas. When I have accepted and chosen them, they become mine.

As a film director I am realistic. I am using the world of events and the world of thoughts, and I treat them equally. I am also realistic in my approach to the work. I respect my producer, money and, above all,  my viewer. Not just because I have to. I do so because I want to. In my opinion, the production of a film- however costly- has its own morality. And I am trying to obey this morality, because I want to obey. A cup of coffee may cost 1½ dollars, may cost 3 or 5 dollars, but when it costs 120 dollars, drinking this coffee is immoral. It is exactly the same in the production of films.

The film I want to make is the film I am able to make. There are no others. I don't think of other films. I don't have a million viewers waiting at the entrance of the cinema, but I need to feel that someone needs me for something. And even if I make films- like all my colleagues- for myself, I'm looking all the time for somebody who tells me, like a fifteen-year-old girl in France, 'I saw your 'Double Life of Veronique' (1991) Then I want to see it several more times. For the first time in my life I have seen and I have felt that there is something like 'soul'. So, if I were not concerned about this girl's opinion, there would be no reason to take the camera out of its box.""

1qknee7,https://v.redd.it/an0t9avqt2fg1,Help with extraction using double wall basket,"I’ve always used the double-walled basket with beans like Costa and Taylor’s (please don’t criticise my store-bought beans!). This week I tried ‘Grind’ fresh beans for the first time and used the single-walled basket.  I wasn’t impressed with the results so we reverted to store-bought beans. I changed the filter back to the double-walled basket with Costa beans.  I’ve cleaned out the bean storage compartment and i put some beans through the grinder to ensure all the old grinds are gone. However, my machine isn’t producing any coffee on the same grind setting I used before (4). I’ve never had this problem before and I’m at a loss for what to do. The machine is getting pressure but it’s just not giving me any liquid. Any thoughts?",1,1769164295.0,BrevilleCoffee,1,1.0,False
