Marcus Holbrook's question hung in the crisp Alaskan air like frozen breath as he adjusted the straps on his Gregory pack. 

The weight distribution felt off. 

Twenty-three years of backcountry experience told him something was wrong with how Dave had loaded their gear, but they were already eight miles into the Chugach range.  
  
Dave Chen fumbled through his hip belt pockets, producing a canister of Counter Assault. 

""Got mine. You?""  
  
""Yeah, somewhere."" Marcus scanned the ridgeline ahead. Late September meant the grizzlies were hyperphagic, gorging themselves stupid before winter. 

The dwarf birch had already turned crimson across the valley floor, and fresh snow dusted the peaks above treeline. 

""That traverse looks sketchy.""  
  
The outcrop jutted from the mountainside like a broken tooth, maybe forty feet of exposed granite with a narrow game trail scratched across its face. Below, nothing but air and angular talus for three hundred feet.  
  
""We could backtrack,"" 

Dave suggested, though his tone said he'd rather eat his own boot. They'd been planning this route to the remote Eklutna Glacier for six months. 

Dave had even taken time off from his surgical residency at Providence Alaska Medical Center, no small feat considering his attending was a legendary hardass.  
  
Marcus studied the traverse again. The rock looked solid enough, weathered but not friable. He'd done worse in the Tetons. ""Nah, we're good. Just watch that loose stuff on the left.""  
  
They'd met four years ago on a Search and Rescue call near Crow Pass. Some Instagram influencer had tried to ford Eagle River during spring runoff wearing nothing but Lululemon and optimism. 

Marcus had been volunteering with Alaska Mountain Rescue Group; Dave was the trauma resident who'd stabilized her in the field after the hypothermia set in. They'd bonded over shared disgust at tourist stupidity and discovered a mutual addiction to suffering in beautiful places.  
  
Marcus led out onto the traverse, testing each foothold. The granite felt reassuringly rough under his Sportiva Trangos. Behind him, Dave's breathing quickened. The doc was solid on technical rock, but exposure always made him twitchy.  
  
""Looking good,"" Marcus called back. ""Just keep three points of contact.""  
  
Fifteen feet out, the game trail narrowed to maybe eight inches. Marcus pressed his body against the rock face, shuffling sideways. His pack scraped against granite. A chunk of lichen flaked off and spiraled into the void.  
  
""How's it look?"" Dave's voice carried that forced calm he used when suturing particularly gnarly lacerations.  
  
""Bomber. Just don't look down.""  
  
Which was, of course, exactly when Marcus looked down.  
  
The talus field seemed to shift and swim three hundred feet below. Vertigo hit him like a sucker punch. His left foot slipped on a patch of verglas, that treacherous thin ice that forms when moisture freezes on rock. Time dilated. His brain processed the physics with crystalline clarity: momentum plus gravity plus forty-pound pack equals extremely bad day.  
  
His right hand clawed for purchase. Fingernails bent backward against granite. His left foot pedaled air. The pack's weight pulled him outward.  
  
""MARCUS!""  
  
Dave's scream dopplered past as Marcus pinwheeled through space. The world became a blur of sky, rock, sky, rock. His tactical brain noted absurdly specific details: a golden eagle riding thermals to the south, the exact shade of blue-white on a hanging glacier, Dave's horrified face peering over the edge.  
  
The first impact came at maybe twenty feet. His left hip glanced off a protruding ledge, spinning him backward. The second hit was worse. Both feet struck an angled slab simultaneously. 

The force traveled up his legs like twin lightning bolts. He felt more than heard the wet crunch of breaking bone, a sensation like stepping on rotten kindling.  
  
Then he was airborne again, cartwheeling through space in a grotesque parody of a gymnast's routine. The talus rushed up to meet him. His pack hit first, probably saving his life by absorbing some impact. His helmeted head snapped back. Stars exploded across his vision.  
  
When the world stopped moving, Marcus found himself sprawled across a jumble of angular granite blocks. His legs were twisted at angles that definitely weren't factory standard. Pain hadn't arrived yet; shock was still running interference. 

He could taste copper and smell his own piss.  
  
""Marcus! MARCUS!"" Dave's voice echoed off the cirque walls.  
  
Marcus tried to respond but only managed a wet cough. Blood spattered the granite. Fantastic. He catalogued sensations with the detached interest of someone watching a nature documentary. Probable concussion from the head snap. Ribs definitely broken on the left side; breathing felt like sucking air through a coffee stirrer. And his ankles...  
  
Christ, his ankles.  
  
The pain arrived then, a symphony of agony that started in his feet and crescendoed through his entire skeleton. Both ankles were comprehensively fucked. The left one bent inward at an unnatural angle, the foot rotated almost backward. The right wasn't much better. Even through his boots, he could see the deformity.  
  
""Don't move!"" Dave shouted. ""I'm coming down!""  
  
""No!"" Marcus managed to croak. ""Call... SAR...""  
  
Silence from above. Then: ""The satphone's in your pack!""  
  
Of course it was. They always put their emergency gear with whoever was leading. Standard protocol that now seemed monumentally stupid.  
  
Marcus heard scrambling on the traverse, loose rock clattering down. ""Dave, don't... don't be an idiot...""  
  
But Dave was already committed, practically running across the narrow ledge. Later, Marcus would wonder if his friend would have made it if he hadn't been panicking, hadn't been a trauma surgeon who knew exactly how bad bilateral ankle fractures could get in the backcountry.  
  
Dave's foot hit the same patch of verglas.  
  
Marcus watched his friend's expression shift from determination to surprise to terror in the space of a heartbeat. Dave's arms windmilled frantically. For a moment, he seemed to hover, suspended by pure will.  
  
Then gravity collected its due.  
  
Dave's fall was shorter but no less violent. He bounced off two ledges before landing in the talus field thirty feet from Marcus. The impact sounded like someone dropping a sack of meat from a loading dock.  
  
""Dave?"" Marcus's voice came out as a whisper.  
  
A groan answered him. Dave rolled onto his side, revealing a face painted with blood from a gash above his eyebrow. He pushed himself to sitting, favoring his left shoulder.  
  
""You okay?"" Marcus asked, which was possibly the stupidest question in the history of human communication.  
  
Dave crawled over, leaving a blood trail on the granite. His hands moved with practiced efficiency, checking Marcus's pupils, palpating his skull, running along his spine.  
  
""Don't move your head,"" Dave instructed, voice steadier now that he had a patient to focus on. ""Any numbness? Tingling?""  
  
""My feet are fucked, Dave.""  
  
""I know. Let me see."" Dave carefully unlaced Marcus's left boot. Even that gentle movement sent lightning through Marcus's nervous system. When Dave peeled back the sock, both men sucked in breath.  
  
The ankle looked like someone had stuffed a softball under the skin. Purple-black bruising was already spreading. Bone fragments tented the skin in two places. The foot hung at a ninety-degree angle to the leg.  
  
""Pilon fracture,"" Dave muttered. ""Probably bilateral. Tibial plafond is completely destroyed."" He moved to the right ankle, which wasn't much better. ""This one's dislocated too. Probably fractured talus, maybe calcaneus...""  
  
""English, Doc.""  
  
Dave met his eyes. ""Your ankles are fucked.""  
  
""Yeah, got that part."" Marcus tried to shift position and immediately regretted it. His ribs screamed protest. ""What about the satphone?""  
  
Dave glanced at Marcus's pack, which had somehow stayed attached despite the fall. He carefully worked it free, trying not to jostle the injuries. The main compartment was torn open. Gear had scattered across the talus: energy bars, water filter, first aid kit...  
  
And the shattered remains of their Iridium 9575.  
  
The satellite phone looked like someone had fed it through a wood chipper. The antenna was bent double, the screen spider-webbed, the battery compartment split open. Dave pressed the power button anyway. Nothing.  
  
""Fuck."" Dave's single word carried the weight of their situation. They were fifteen miles from the nearest trailhead, in a cirque that saw maybe a dozen visitors per year. No cell coverage for fifty miles. The nearest civilization was Eklutna Village, population 70.  
  
Marcus watched Dave's face cycle through the stages of grief at land speed. Denial: frantically pressing buttons on the broken phone. Anger: hurling a rock at the cliff face with a primal scream. Bargaining: checking his own pack for the cell phone they both knew wouldn't work here. Depression: slumping forward with his head in his hands.  
  
""Hey,"" Marcus said. ""We're not dead yet.""  
  
Dave laughed, a sound with no humor in it. ""You can't walk. Hell, you'll be lucky if you walk again period. I've got a separated shoulder and probable concussion. We're in grizzly country with no comms and nobody expecting us back for five days.""  
  
""So we're having a Tuesday in Alaska.""  
  
That got a real laugh. Dave started triage, operating on muscle memory and adrenaline. He splinted Marcus's ankles using trekking poles and duct tape, a field expedient solution that would have horrified his attending physicians. Marcus screamed twice and passed out once. When he came to, Dave was rigging a shelter using their rain flies and paracord.  
  
""How's the shoulder?"" Marcus asked through gritted teeth.  
  
""Separated AC joint. Grade 3 probably."" Dave demonstrated limited range of motion in his left arm. ""I can work with it.""  
  
They took inventory as the sun tracked toward the western peaks. Two sleeping bags, both torn but functional. Six days of food if they rationed. Water filter intact. First aid kit mostly scattered but recoverable. Bear spray times two. No working communications.  
  
""We need to talk about extraction,"" Dave said, breaking open a packet of ibuprofen. The standard 200mg tabs were a joke against their current pain levels, but it was what they had.  
  
Marcus dry-swallowed four tablets. ""Nobody's coming for five days minimum. Sarah thinks I'm in Denali doing guide recon."" His girlfriend was used to him disappearing into the wilderness. ""Your people?""  
  
""I told the hospital I was going backpacking. Didn't specify where."" Dave grimaced. ""Dr. Harrison is going to have my ass for missing rounds.""  
  
""Pretty sure that's the least of our problems.""  
  
As if to emphasize the point, a sound drifted across the cirque that raised every hair on Marcus's neck: the distinctive woof of a grizzly. Not close, but definitely interested.  
  
Dave immediately reached for the bear spray. ""How far?""  
  
Marcus tried to pinpoint the sound. Twenty-three years in Alaska had taught him to read the acoustic landscape. ""Maybe three hundred meters. Probably caught our scent.""  
  
They'd both bled considerably. In the backcountry, blood was a dinner bell.  
  
""Fire?"" Dave suggested.  
  
""Not above treeline. Nothing to burn."" The cirque was all rock and low alpine plants. ""We need to look bigger. Make noise.""  
  
For the next hour, they maintained a careful watch while Dave finished setting camp. The shelter was a masterpiece of field engineering: low profile to handle wind, angled to shed rain, with their packs positioned as barriers. He'd even managed to excavate a shallow depression to protect Marcus from the elements.  
  
The grizzly never showed, but they heard it twice more, circling their position. Testing.  
  
Night fell like a hammer in the Alaskan mountains. The temperature plummeted twenty degrees in as many minutes. Dave helped Marcus into his sleeping bag, a process that involved considerable swearing and a few tears. The ankle manipulation sent fresh waves of agony through Marcus's system.  
  
""I need to reduce these fractures,"" Dave said. ""The longer we wait, the worse the swelling gets.""  
  
""You ever set bilateral pilons in the field?""  
  
""There's a first time for everything.""  
  
""That's not reassuring, Doc.""  
  
Dave's headlamp illuminated his exhausted face. Blood had dried in rusty streams from the gash on his forehead. ""Look, I can try to reduce them now while you can still feel your feet, or we can wait until compartment syndrome sets in and you lose them anyway.""  
  
Compartment syndrome. When swelling cuts off blood flow to the extremities. Marcus had seen it in avalanche victims. The tissue death was irreversible.  
  
""Do it.""  
  
Dave raided both first aid kits, laying out their meager supplies. No morphine. No lidocaine. Just ibuprofen, a few benzos for altitude sickness, and Marcus's flask of Maker's Mark.  
  
""This is going to hurt,"" Dave warned.  
  
""No shit.""  
  
Marcus took a pull of whiskey that burned all the way down. Dave positioned himself at Marcus's left foot, studying the deformity. In the hospital, this would involve X-rays, anesthesia, a team of orthopedic specialists. Here, it was just Dave's hands and whatever gods looked after idiots in the mountains.  
  
""On three,"" Dave said. ""One... two...""  
  
He pulled on two.  
  
The pain was transcendent. Marcus's vision went white. He felt the bones grinding, tendons popping, the entire architecture of his ankle rearranging. His scream echoed off the cirque walls. Somewhere in the distance, a wolf answered.  
  
When Marcus's vision cleared, his foot was pointing the right direction. Mostly.  
  
""One down,"" Dave said shakily.  
  
The second ankle was worse. Dave had to pull twice to overcome the muscle spasms. Marcus bit through the leather of his belt. When it was over, he lay gasping like a landed fish while Dave retaped the splints.  
  
""We need antibiotics,"" Dave muttered. ""Those open fractures are going to get infected.""  
  
""We need a lot of things.""  
  
They huddled in their bags as the temperature continued dropping. Marcus shivered uncontrollably, shock and hypothermia tag-teaming his system. Dave pressed against him, sharing what warmth he could.  
  
""Tell me about Sarah,"" Dave said, trying to distract them both.  
  
""What about her?""  
  
""You guys serious?""  
  
Marcus considered. He'd been dating Sarah Koskinen for two years. She was a bush pilot out of Talkeetna, flew climbers into Denali. Tough as nails, beautiful in that understated Nordic way, and pathologically independent. ""I don't know. Maybe.""  
  
""That's a ringing endorsement.""  
  
""Says the guy who hasn't had a relationship last longer than a surgical rotation.""  
  
Dave chuckled. ""Fair point.""  
  
They talked through the night, voices creating a barrier against the darkness. Told stories about other epic failures in the mountains. Debated whether the Seahawks would ever not suck. Analyzed the metaphysical implications of breakfast burritos. Anything to avoid discussing the obvious: their odds of survival were dropping with every hour.  
  
Dawn came slowly, pale light creeping across the eastern peaks. Marcus hadn't slept. The pain was constant now, a full-body throb synchronized with his heartbeat. His ankles had swollen to twice their normal size despite the compression.  
  
Dave looked haggard. The blood on his face had dried to rusty brown. His left arm hung useless at his side.  
  
""Morning rounds,"" he said with forced cheer. ""How's the pain?""  
  
""Somewhere between stepping on Legos and being drawn and quartered.""  
  
""So improving.""  
  
Dave checked the splints, frowning at the swelling. The skin was tight and shiny, bruising spreading up both calves. ""We need to elevate these.""  
  
They spent the morning rigging a system to keep Marcus's legs raised. Dave scavenged their scattered gear, recovering most of the food and medical supplies. The satphone remained spectacularly dead.  
  
""I could hike out,"" Dave suggested over a breakfast of energy bars and instant coffee.  
  
""With a separated shoulder and concussion? Through grizzly country?"" Marcus shook his head. ""That's how we end up with two dead idiots instead of one.""  
  
""So what, we just wait?""  
  
""SAR will start looking when we don't check in. Five days.""  
  
""You could be septic in five days. Or hypothermic. Or..."" Dave gestured at the vast wilderness surrounding them. ""Eaten.""  
  
As if on cue, movement caught their peripheral vision. A grizzly sow emerged from behind a granite buttress two hundred meters away, followed by two cubs. Second-year cubs, maybe 150 pounds each. Big enough to be dangerous, small enough that mama would be psychotically protective.  
  
""Don't move,"" Marcus whispered.  
  
The sow raised her massive head, testing the wind. Even at distance, they could see the distinctive shoulder hump, the dished face. She huffed, a sound that carried clearly in the still air.  
  
Dave had the bear spray ready, though they both knew it was mostly psychological comfort at this range. The sow could cover two hundred meters in about fifteen seconds. The spray had an effective range of maybe thirty feet.  
  
The cubs play-fought, oblivious to the tension. Their mother watched them, then swung her head back toward the humans. She took two steps forward.  
  
Marcus felt his heart rate spike. Adrenaline was a hell of a painkiller; his ankles temporarily faded to background noise. ""Make yourself big. Noise.""  
  
They yelled simultaneously, Dave waving his good arm while Marcus threw rocks. The sow huffed again, gathering her cubs with a series of grunts. She gave them one last look that clearly communicated ""you're not worth it"" and ambled back the way she'd come.  
  
""Jesus,"" Dave breathed.  
  
""Welcome to Alaska.""  
  
The rest of the day passed in a blur of pain management and micro-logistics. Dave rationed their food and medications. They collected water from a seep in the rocks, purifying it with their filter. Every small task took three times longer with their injuries.  
  
By afternoon, Marcus was running a fever. The open fractures were already showing signs of infection despite Dave's efforts at field sanitation. Red streaks crept up from the wound sites.  
  
""This is bad,"" Dave said, no longer trying to sugarcoat. ""Without antibiotics...""  
  
""I know.""  
  
They'd both seen enough wilderness medicine to understand the progression. Infection. Sepsis. Organ failure. The body consuming itself in a futile fight against bacterial invasion.  
  
That night was worse than the first. Marcus's fever spiked to 103. He drifted in and out of consciousness, mumbling about Sarah, about climbs from decades past, about his father who'd died when Marcus was twelve. Dave stayed awake, monitoring his friend's vital signs with increasing alarm.  
  
The wolves came at midnight.  
  
Not the solo scout from the night before, but a pack. Five, maybe six animals materializing from the darkness like smoke. Their eyes reflected green in Dave's headlamp.  
  
""Marcus."" Dave shook his friend. ""Marcus, wake up.""  
  
Marcus surfaced from fevered dreams to see death arranged in a semicircle around their camp. The wolves were bigger than he'd expected, probably MacKenzie Valley wolves from interior. The alpha was massive, maybe 140 pounds of muscle and instinct.  
  
""They know we're hurt,"" Dave whispered.  
  
It was true. Predators could sense weakness like sharks scenting blood. Two injured humans were just another protein source.  
  
The alpha took a step forward, lips pulling back from impressive dentition. The other wolves flanked out, textbook pack hunting behavior.  
  
""Spray?"" Marcus croaked.  
  
""Got it."" Dave held a canister in each hand despite his bad shoulder. ""This is going to get sporty.""  
  
Marcus forced himself to sitting despite the screaming protest from his ribs. Movement was good. Movement suggested they weren't quite carrion yet.  
  
""Hey!"" he shouted, voice cracking. ""Back off!""  
  
The alpha tilted its head, evaluating. These humans were making noise but not running. Injured prey usually ran. This was outside normal parameters.  
  
Dave started singing, of all things. ""Sweet Caroline"" at maximum volume. The absurdity of it, Neil Diamond versus apex predators, made Marcus laugh despite everything.  
  
The wolves circled closer. Twenty feet now. Well within charge range.  
  
""When I say run,"" Dave muttered between verses, ""we're going to-""  
  
The alpha charged.  
  
One hundred forty pounds of evolutionary perfection launched forward. Dave triggered the bear spray, sending a cloud of capsaicin into the night. The wolf hit it head-on and veered off, sneezing and pawing at its face.  
  
The other wolves scattered, then regrouped. They'd learned. The next approach would be from multiple angles.  
  
""How much spray?"" Marcus asked.  
  
""Half a can. Maybe less.""  
  
Not enough. Not nearly enough.  
  
Marcus grabbed a trekking pole, using it as a crutch to lever himself upright. The pain was extraordinary, but adrenaline was a hell of a drug. He stood swaying, probably looking like the world's most pathetic scarecrow.  
  
""You crazy bastard,"" Dave said.  
  
""Crazy's all we got left.""  
  
The wolves circled again, more cautious now. The alpha's eyes streamed from the capsaicin, but its focus never wavered. These humans were acting wrong. Injured prey didn't stand and fight. But the pack was hungry, and winter was coming.  
  
""We need fire,"" Marcus said.  
  
""With what? There's nothing-"" Dave stopped. ""The whiskey.""  
  
Marcus's flask was still half full. Not much, but 90 proof alcohol would burn. Dave splashed it on a pile of energy bar wrappers and synthetic fabric torn from their destroyed packs. His lighter sparked once, twice...  
  
The makeshift torch flared to life. It wouldn't last long, but fire was humanity's oldest friend. The wolves immediately backed off, instincts older than memory taking over.  
  
""Yeah!"" Dave waved the burning fabric. ""How do you like that?""  
  
The alpha snarled but retreated. The pack melted back into darkness, conceding this round. They'd be back. Persistence hunting was their specialty. But for now, the weird bipeds had won.  
  
Marcus collapsed back to the ground, ankles shrieking. The adrenaline crash was brutal. His fever spiked higher, reality blurring at the edges.  
  
""Stay with me,"" Dave said, checking his pulse. ""Marcus, you need to stay awake.""  
  
But consciousness was a ship sailing away, and Marcus was too tired to swim after it.  
  
He dreamed of Sarah. They were flying her Super Cub over Denali, the mountain massive and implacable below. She was laughing at something he'd said, blonde hair escaping from her headset. The engine note changed, became growling, became...  
  
Marcus woke to sunlight and Dave shaking him frantically.  
  
""Thank Christ,"" Dave breathed. ""I thought...""  
  
""Still here."" Marcus's voice was a whisper. His throat felt like sandpaper. ""Barely.""  
  
""Your fever broke around dawn. I was about to start CPR just to have something to do.""  
  
Marcus tried to laugh but only managed a wheeze. Everything hurt. His ankles had swollen to the point where the skin looked ready to split. The infection was winning.  
  
""How long?"" he asked.  
  
Dave understood. ""We're on day three. Two more until someone misses us.""  
  
Two more days. Might as well be two years.  
  
They spent the morning in a pain-and-exhaustion fugue. Dave managed to trap a pika, the tiny rabbit-like creature providing maybe three ounces of meat. It tasted like survival.  
  
The wolves returned that afternoon, maintaining a respectful distance but clearly waiting. The grizzly family made another appearance. Ravens circled overhead, nature's cleanup crew anticipating a meal.  
  
""Starting to feel like a wildlife documentary,"" Dave observed. ""When Meals Go Wrong.""  
  
""Dibs on Morgan Freeman narrating my death.""  
  
""Screw that. If I'm dying, I want Samuel L. Jackson. 'These motherfucking wolves in these motherfucking mountains.'""  
  
They giggled like idiots, exhaustion and stress fracturing into hysterical humor. It felt good to laugh, even if it made Marcus's ribs scream.  
  
That night, the temperature dropped below freezing. Their sleeping bags were rated to 20 degrees, but that assumed full mobility and proper shelter. Dave had done his best, but the makeshift bivvy could only do so much against the Arctic wind screaming down from the north.  
  
Marcus shivered uncontrollably, his body burning precious calories trying to maintain core temperature. Hypothermia was winning the race against infection.  
  
""We're going to make it,"" Dave said, pressed against him for warmth.  
  
""Liar.""  
  
""Yeah, but I'm a good liar. Comes with the medical degree.""  
  
They talked about inconsequential things. Dave's plan to specialize in wilderness medicine. Marcus's dream of putting up a new route on Denali's Cassin Ridge. The best pizza in Anchorage (Moose's Tooth, no contest). Anything to keep their minds off the cold seeping into their bones.  
  
Dawn of day four arrived with fresh snowfall. Six inches of pristine white covered their camp, beautiful and deadly. The temperature had dropped another ten degrees.  
  
Marcus couldn't feel his feet anymore. That was either very bad (frostbite) or very, very bad (the infection had cut off circulation entirely). Dave's left arm had turned purple-black where the separation had damaged blood vessels.  
  
""I need to check something,"" Dave said. He dug through Marcus's pack with his good hand, throwing aside gear with increasing desperation. ""I know I saw...""  
  
He pulled out a stuff sack, triumphant. Inside was Marcus's emergency bivvy from his glacier travel kit. The one he'd meant to remove after his last Denali trip but forgotten.  
  
And inside that...  
  
""No fucking way,"" Marcus breathed.  
  
A second satellite phone. Older model, a Iridium 9505A. The brick-sized unit Marcus had bought years ago as a backup and forgotten in the bottom of his glacier kit.  
  
Dave's hands shook as he pressed the power button. Nothing. The battery was probably dead after months of neglect.  
  
""The solar charger,"" Marcus said. ""In my repair kit.""  
  
Dave found the small solar panel, another piece of forgotten gear. His fingers were numb with cold as he connected the cables. The charging light blinked on.  
  
""How long?"" Marcus asked.  
  
""Maybe an hour for enough juice to make a call. If it even works.""  
  
They waited in tense silence as the weak autumn sun fed power to the ancient battery. The wolves watched from a nearby ridge. A golden eagle circled overhead. The mountains remained supremely indifferent to human drama.  
  
After forty minutes, Dave tried the phone. It powered on with a cheerful beep that sounded like angels singing.  
  
""Holy shit,"" Dave breathed. He dialed 911 with shaking fingers.  
  
Static. Then: ""911, what's your emergency?""  
  
Dave almost sobbed. ""This is Dr. David Chen. We're in the Chugach Mountains, approximately..."" He rattled off their GPS coordinates from muscle memory. ""Two injured hikers. One with bilateral ankle fractures and sepsis, one with separated shoulder and head trauma. We need immediate medevac.""  
  
The dispatcher was professionally calm. ""Sir, can you confirm your location?""  
  
Dave repeated the coordinates. ""We're in a cirque on the north side of Bashful Peak. My companion is critical. Septic shock imminent.""  
  
""Understand. We're dispatching Alaska Air Guard. Can you mark your position?""  
  
""Roger. We have orange bivy sacks for signaling.""  
  
""Estimated arrival ninety minutes. Can you hold that long?""  
  
Dave looked at Marcus, who was drifting in and out of consciousness. ""We'll hold.""  
  
The connection dropped, but the message was sent. Help was coming.  
  
The next ninety minutes were the longest of their lives. Dave spread out everything orange or reflective they had. Marcus fought to stay conscious, knowing that slipping away now would be giving up.  
  
They heard the helicopter before they saw it. The distinctive whop-whop-whop of a Pave Hawk echoing off the granite walls. Then it appeared, a beautiful olive-drab angel banking hard around Bashful Peak.  
  
The PJs were everything their reputation promised. Two pararescue jumpers fast-roped down while the helicopter orbited. Within minutes they had IVs running, real pain meds flowing, Marcus packaged for transport.  
  
""You guys picked a hell of a place to break,"" the lead PJ said, prepping the hoist. ""Another day and...""  
  
He didn't finish. Didn't need to.  
  
They lifted Marcus first, the rotor wash creating a localized blizzard. Dave went second, finally allowing himself to feel the full extent of his injuries as the adrenaline faded.  
  
As the helicopter banked toward Anchorage, Marcus caught a glimpse of their camp from above. It looked impossibly small, a tiny speck of human stubbornness in an ocean of indifferent wilderness. The wolves were already investigating the abandoned gear.  
  
""Hey,"" Dave said over the intercom. ""We made it.""  
  
Marcus managed a thumbs up with his IV hand. They'd made it. Broken, bloodied, and hypothermic, but alive. The mountains had thrown everything at them, and they'd survived through equal parts preparation, medical knowledge, and sheer stupid luck.  
  
That forgotten satellite phone. If Marcus had cleaned out his pack properly, they'd be statistics. If Dave had fallen a few feet differently, they'd both be dead. If the weather had been worse, if the wolves had been hungrier, if the infection had spread faster...  
  
But that was wilderness travel in Alaska. You stacked the deck in your favor as much as possible, then rolled the dice and hoped the house didn't win. This time, humanity had squeaked by.  
  
The Anchorage skyline appeared through the helicopter windows. Civilization. Hospitals. Antibiotics. Marcus looked at Dave, who was already arguing with the flight medic about treatment protocols.  
  
They'd have scars. Marcus would need multiple surgeries, months of rehab. Dave's shoulder would require reconstruction. But they'd heal. And eventually, inevitably, they'd go back to the mountains.  
  
Because that's what humans did. They survived impossible things through cooperation, preparation, and bloody-minded refusal to quit. They learned from their mistakes, updated their gear lists, and went back for more.

The helicopter descended toward Providence Hospital's landing pad. Sarah would be waiting, warned by the rescue coordinator. She'd probably punch Marcus first, then kiss him. Dave's attending would be furious about the missed shifts until he heard the story.  
  
They'd become another tale told around campfires and climbing shops. The two idiots who forgot to split up their emergency comms, remembered their backup phone, and lived to laugh about it. Their story would join the canon of near-misses that taught the next generation what not to do.  
  
Marcus felt the drugs pulling him under as they touched down. The last thing he saw was Dave giving him a shaky thumbs up as the trauma team swarmed the helicopter.  
  
They'd made it.

Our *African Kahawa Blend* is the result of a remarkable chain of care, skill, and purpose:

* **Hand-picked cherries** by smallholder farmers who know their land like family
* **Traditional hand-processing** that coaxes out complex flavors
* **Sun-dried on raised beds**, then eco-sorted to minimize environmental impact
* Roasted in small batches to **highlight natural sweetness and bold character**

The flavor? It’s a journey—*chocolate, toffee, raisin and red fruit*, with a floral finish that lingers like a good memory.

We’re incredibly proud to partner with farms that practice *ethical labor, sustainable agriculture, and reinvest in their communities*. This isn’t just good coffee—it’s rooted in something bigger.

If you’ve brewed with beans like this before, we’d love your take: ☕️ What’s your go-to method for bringing out nuance? 🌍 Any origin stories or farmer highlights you geek out on? 💡 Suggestions on how we can tell these stories better?

We're offering **10% off with INSTANT10** \+ **free U.S. shipping** if you'd like to try a bag. Happy to answer questions about sourcing or the roast curve too!  Come see us at: [signalfirecoffeecompany.myshopify.com](http://signalfirecoffeecompany.myshopify.com) .

She even tried to get me to show up once I’d found out about the meeting and, like, shake his hand. Positively diabolical. 

There SO much more to it than that, but now… I’m about to end things. We’ve gone back and forth and round for round over the last few days… she says she still loves me but said she doesn’t think she can control herself and can’t say she won’t do it again. “Sorry. I’m just being honest. That’s what you want, right?”

She said, “it was never even about him. If it wasn’t him, it probably would have been someone else.”

So fine. I talked to a lawyer. I understand what my responsibilities will be (legally) and I plan to serve her. 

But I’ve basically been in committed relationships for nearly 30 years. First my ex and then, with a short gap, my current partner. I’ve never really been… alone. 

And I turn 50 in three months. 

So… for those who have… please offer some guidance: How DO you survive infidelity? Because based on the conversation we had last night, I’m done. My ONLY priority now is my son and not falling into greater depression than I already struggle with. 

Thanks.

The name is misleading as I wouldn’t consider this an amber fragrance. It is a more of a leather and sandalwood “bomb” to my nose. In the opening I get a burst of berry, plum, slight coconut and coffee. Settles down into dry leather pretty fast. The floral notes of rose and jasmine slowly develop mixed with more leather and woods. The dry down is smoke! Woods, leather, slight amber mixed with vanilla, tonka, musk and smoke. Smells like a slightly sweet campfire. The sandalwood really rounds it out. Definitely one for the senses. The longevity is amazing. Feels very masculine. Probably better saved for cool autumn winter weather. In the heat of the summer the scent lands a little flat. My first purchase of Alambar by Laboratorio Olfattivo is much more what I consider a true amber scent. Both fragrances are potent and unique. I look forward to trying more scents from this brand.

I was hooked. My husband was an alcoholic. We had a son together. He wasn't there for me financially or emotionally. I had a lot of anger. No one ever showed up for me in my life. I was always there for everyone else. After 3 years I gave up and we got divorced. I went to nursing school. Coffee seen me through school. Nursing is 12 hour shifts with lots of stress. I ended up on nights for 18 years. Coffee kept me showing up. My second husband was an alcoholic and abusive. He did horrible things to my kids when I worked nights. I didn't know till my 3 year old told me. I was devastated. Coffee kept me from fulIy losing my mind. I still had to work and care for my kids. I did a lot of therapy as did my kids. I also had to face that I was abused as a child. I never addressed my codependency. After 6 years I met another alcoholic and let him moved in. I continued to drink coffee and started smoking and drinking alcohol again.  I hit bottom 4 years ago. I was going to divorce my husband. He lied about drinking and gambling our whole relationship.I decided to stay and work on my recovering from codependency. It is almost 4 years.

1lkyhvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1lkyhvq/aio_i_think_my_grandfather_is_trying_to_poison_us/,AIO I think my grandfather is trying to poison us?,"We have a pretty colorful relationship with my grandfather. 8 years ago, we started building a new house for my grandparents. We were supposed to renovate and live in the old house. However, my grandma died, so my grandfather decided to just stay in his old house and left us the new house on his plot. We moved in. There was no fence, just two houses with separate gates and a shared garden.

Everything was nice, but around three years ago, my parents and my grandfather started arguing. He stopped coming around for Chrismas, stopped talking to me, and stopped asking my mom to drive him to his appointments and called a cab instead. He was always a little wussy. For example, if my mom was two minutes late because she had to drive my sister to school, he would throw a fit and wouldn't talk to her for weeks.

All hell broke loose when my parents decided it was time to separate from him and divide the plot legally. At first, there wasn't even supposed to be a fence, it was purely for legal reasons. My parents and my grandfather couldn't come to an agreement. My parents wanted to just make a straight line that followed the small fence along the gate, which would give us maybe an extra two meters of space. The alternative was a pretty weird division that, although would make it a real 50/50, created a weird zigzag design. 

My parents paid for all the legal fees, they didn't want a dime from my grandfather. For context: my grandfather gardens a lot. It's something he's done for years, and my mom has caught on to his hobby and started her own garden, right next to his. He has some kind of pesticide spray. Many times, our fruits and vegetables died because of that.

One time, when my mom was home alone, he came to her with an axe he used to chop down wood and tried to hit her with it when she opened the door for him. (She suffered no damage, except some psychological stuff.)

Fast forward to now, my mom picked up some zucchini for dinner today, and it was extremely bitter. I don't mean this in the way that dark chocolate might be bitter, or coffee. It tasted like dishwasher tablets. I only lightly touched the zucchini with my tongue, and I felt like I swallowed battery acid.

There were some climate changes in my area recently, and I've read it might impact the taste, but to this degree??? It was the worst thing I've tasted. Something that leads me to believe it was actually my grandfather and not just moody temperature was that not all zucchini tasted like piss. There was one that was absolutely normal, not even slightly bitter. Furthermore, there is a pear tree right next to the fence. On our side, it looks perfectly fine, beautiful green leaves, lots of fruit. On his side, yellow leaves, no fruit, rotten.

Am I overreacting, maybe it's really just the weather that impacted the taste? If someone knows a little about gardening, or had a similar situation happen to them, please let me know.",4,1750939781.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

At first, I liked the name and the idea of immortalizing the poor animal, but now I think it's kind of prophetic. 

The mission started two months ago, and at first, everything seemed normal. We are a team of experienced astronauts from different nations — ten men and five women. Our station is bigger and higher up than the ISS, so it can hold more people. We are supposed to stay on the station for five years — longer than anyone ever has. NASA, working with a few other countries, wants to see how well human bodies can adapt to space conditions for long periods of time. One day, our research might help with missions to other planets or perhaps even colonization. This is the official purpose of our mission. There’s another task we were given, which is a bit more secretive. The station is equipped with newer, stronger technology that can send and receive signals from space. They still hope to hear from faraway civilizations. 

We all got to know each other before the mission and spent months training together. All of us had been on the ISS before, so the adaptation process seemed simple. There was a lot of work, like maintenance and daily reports back to Earth, but overall, our life was simple, almost peaceful. 

Everything changed on a random Friday of the third week. I was working with the “Long-Distance Communication Array,” which we jokingly called “Ray.” I was in the room with Greg Swanson, a 45-year-old American engineer who was the most skeptical about the existence of extraterrestrial life. He had spent his entire life working for NASA and believed that if aliens did, in fact, exist, we would have already known about them. But he was the best in his field, and the pay was good, so he agreed to go on the mission. All the money was being sent to his wife and four children. Usually we ran all the waves we received through sonification process. We were listening to the usual silence through “Ray” until… 

BOOM 

The sound was so loud I had to cover my ears. I felt like the echoes were bouncing inside my brain, causing a strong headache. Greg and I stared at each other in disbelief for a few seconds, then went back to “Ray.” Humans had received what they thought were signals from outer space civilisations before, but soon we learned that those were stars exploding or black holes expanding. This sound was something entirely different. It wasn’t like any signal we had received before — the system couldn’t even tell its frequency.

We called our teammates. It didn’t matter what they were doing — they all stopped midway and joined us in the Signal Room. Nothing was more important than this. We saved the recording and sent it back to Earth as soon as we could. Whatever it was, it could be the biggest discovery of our century. We could come back as heroes. But honestly, I couldn’t care less about that. We might be the first people ever to come in contact with extraterrestrial life. That thought sent shivers down my spine. 

We spent the evening celebrating. There’s no alcohol on the station, but the excitement everyone shared made me feel drunk. We kept talking and laughing and coming up with potential explanations of what the signal might be. There was a feeling of victory and almost childlike curiosity about the unknown. Now both we and the scientists back on Earth had a tough job of trying to decipher the signal.

Our team had three Signal Processing Specialists — 33-year-old Maria Smirnova from Russia, 40-year-old Oliver Allen from the UK, and 25-year-old Mia Gonzales from the US. Mia was the youngest on our team, yet extremely intelligent. All three had experience in analyzing signals from outer space and the deep ocean, yet none of them had any idea what ours meant.

“When we receive signals from a giant star, for example, we can tell almost everything”, Maria explained to me as we were having lunch in the cafeteria block. “We can tell how far away it is, what is happening, and when it happened. This is something completely different. Our computers have no idea. When I'm listening to it, it's like I feel vibrations in my entire body”.

Two weeks went by, and nothing really happened since. There were no more signals that “Ray” could detect, and the team still had no idea what ours could mean or where it could have come from. We were trying our best, but the excitement was slowly dying down. It still felt normal, but not as peaceful as before. Something was changing on the station, and I could feel it. 

One day, I was working with Chen in the control room. He was a 32-year-old Chinese engineer with a kind smile and a quirky sense of humor. The guy was never serious, and if you met him in a bar, you'd think he was an unemployed party animal still living with his parents, but the man was a genius.

We were doing a routine check of life support systems when suddenly I felt a piercing sharp pain in my forehead. It felt like someone put a giant needle through my brain, and now it was about to explode. Everything inside my head was hot and pulsating. I couldn’t sit straight and instinctively put my hand to my head. 

“Are you okay?” Chen’s voice sounded like he was talking from a different dimension. Everything went blurry for a second, and then I managed to focus my eyes. 

“Yes… No… I mean,” the words wouldn’t come out of my mouth. “I don’t know. I just had such a strong headache. I think it’s getting better.” 

“You wanna go to the doctor’s block?” 

“No, it’s… it’s fine.” I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it.

Chen brought me some water. The headache went away as quickly as it started, so we went back to the life support systems. Chen was my favorite person to work with. He always made me laugh and never acted like the smartest person in the room, even though he probably was one. 

I tried not to think much about the incident, but it still bothered me. I’ve never experienced migraines, but my mom did. I remember her lying down on the couch with her palm to her forehead, and my dad would bring her painkillers. She used to take a lot of them, otherwise, she couldn’t even focus. 

Sometimes she would skip work because of migraines, and one day she couldn’t come to my school play. I was hurt, so dad had to explain to me what a migraine was. As for me, though, I’ve never had them. I was always a healthy and athletic child, which eventually helped me get into a space program. I valued my health, and now this? I began to worry that my mom’s genetics had kicked in because of my age or long space missions. I really hoped it wasn’t the case, and well, I soon learned it wasn’t.

There were two doctors on board, and they were working overtime. Every day, several people would come to complain about headaches. It would be normal if one or two astronauts had this problem, but all of us? A bunch of experienced space travelers? Helen, the doctor from the US, tried her best to help us with pills and breathing exercises, but the results were always temporary. Her Russian colleague, Igor, was freaking out. They couldn’t figure out what was causing the headaches. The doctors measured our body temperature and blood pressure. We even went through the CT scanners we had on the station. Nothing was out of the ordinary. 

By the next week, it wasn’t just headaches. I couldn’t fall asleep no matter how hard I tried. I would lay down in bed with nothing but thoughts that wouldn’t stop. I wanted to shout at my own brain, “SHUT UP! JUST SHUT UP!” When I did fall asleep, it was only for a few hours. I would wake up even more tired than before. Everyone was going through it, and we couldn’t ignore it. It was only our 6th week, and we were not the type of people to crack inside a fully equipped station. None of us had even left “Laika” once. Something was wrong. We assumed it was the oxygen tanks or the food and water supply. That was our best guess; all the other systems on board were perfectly normal. In space, it’s usual to have some sort of problem with engines or control blocks, but there weren’t any. Everything worked like clockwork, yet we all felt miserable. We took turns checking the equipment on a daily basis, ran lab tests on our food supply, but still, there was no answer. The doctors sent our health reports back to Earth for analysis and anxiously waited for a response. We tried our best to stay positive, but it was hard.

One day, I think it was a Thursday, I went to the cafeteria by myself. Everyone else was either working or desperately trying to finally fall asleep. As I got closer to the entrance, I heard voices. It was Greg, the American engineer, and his countrymen Michael and Jessica, both programmers.

“They’re poisoning us, I’m telling you,” Michael’s voice sounded nervous and secretive.

“I don’t get it, Michael. They’re doctors, why would they do that?” Jessica sounded nervous too, but more in a confused way.

“Listen, I’ve worked with you before. I’ve never worked with these people. Helen doesn’t even seem like a doctor. She told me to meditate. And that Russian guy… You know he worked for the FSB, right? Before he became an astronaut. I don’t trust this dude”.

""How are they doing it?"" Greg sounded as authoritative and skeptical as usual.
""They’re the only ones running tests in the lab, right?""

""Well, they're the best at chemistry.""

""Which gives them an advantage. How do you know the results they give us aren't tampered with?""

I entered the cafeteria. The heavy metal door slammed shut with a loud noise. All three people turned and stared at me. I’m not sure how long it lasted, but their gaze made me uncomfortable.

“Hey, Mira,” Michael quickly switched from his conspiracy-theorist tone to his usual upbeat voice. “Hungry?”

“Yeah, I’m starving and could really use some coffee,” I replied, trying to make my voice sound as casual as I could.

“Sure, let me make you some.”

I waited at the table as Michael was making my coffee and opening a package of food. The atmosphere during the meal was extremely awkward, and we all rushed to leave once we were done.

The experience made me question reality. Every astronaut knows: no matter what, you do not bring drama to a space station. You are stuck with just a few people on a piece of metal, hundreds of kilometers away from home. If you start going against each other, you’re done. Michael’s accusations were insane. Igor wasn’t necessarily my friend, but I knew him. He’s a great doctor, and he’s from my country. We had been on a mission together once, and he was nothing but helpful. I wasn’t sure if I should tell him what I’d heard. I didn’t want to create more tension, but I also didn’t want Igor to become a scapegoat.

Meanwhile, our symptoms were only getting worse. By week seven, no one could sleep more than an hour a day. Honestly, we felt lucky to even get that one hour. The migraines made everyone grumpy and easily irritated. Some of us began to have regular nosebleeds, and Hiroshi, the Japanese technician, was bleeding from his eyes. We sent an emergency request to get back to Earth for treatment. The reply took an unusually long time to arrive. When it finally came, I almost wished it hadn’t. The brief message read:

“The risk of mass infection is too high. Return is impossible. Must continue the mission.”

I use the hoffman's method for the french press except i plunge it fully. I use 3 tbsp of ground coffee and 100ml of water just off the boil. Brew it for 15 mins approx.

1lky9uv,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1lky9uv/i_work_on_a_space_station_and_something_is_wrong/,I work on a space station and something is wrong with the crew (Part 1),"I work on the newest space station, called ""Laika,"" after the Soviet dog that died on a rocket. At first, I liked the name and the idea of immortalizing the poor animal, but now I think it's kind of prophetic. 

The mission started two months ago, and at first, everything seemed normal. We are a team of experienced astronauts from different nations — ten men and five women. Our station is bigger and higher up than the ISS, so it can hold more people. We are supposed to stay on the station for five years — longer than anyone ever has. NASA, working with a few other countries, wants to see how well human bodies can adapt to space conditions for long periods of time. One day, our research might help with missions to other planets or perhaps even colonization. This is the official purpose of our mission. There’s another task we were given, which is a bit more secretive. The station is equipped with newer, stronger technology that can send and receive signals from space. They still hope to hear from faraway civilizations. 

We all got to know each other before the mission and spent months training together. All of us had been on the ISS before, so the adaptation process seemed simple. There was a lot of work, like maintenance and daily reports back to Earth, but overall, our life was simple, almost peaceful. 

Everything changed on a random Friday of the third week. I was working with the “Long-Distance Communication Array,” which we jokingly called “Ray.” I was in the room with Greg Swanson, a 45-year-old American engineer who was the most skeptical about the existence of extraterrestrial life. He had spent his entire life working for NASA and believed that if aliens did, in fact, exist, we would have already known about them. But he was the best in his field, and the pay was good, so he agreed to go on the mission. All the money was being sent to his wife and four children. Usually we ran all the waves we received through sonification process. We were listening to the usual silence through “Ray” until… 

BOOM 

The sound was so loud I had to cover my ears. I felt like the echoes were bouncing inside my brain, causing a strong headache. Greg and I stared at each other in disbelief for a few seconds, then went back to “Ray.” Humans had received what they thought were signals from outer space civilisations before, but soon we learned that those were stars exploding or black holes expanding. This sound was something entirely different. It wasn’t like any signal we had received before — the system couldn’t even tell its frequency.

We called our teammates. It didn’t matter what they were doing — they all stopped midway and joined us in the Signal Room. Nothing was more important than this. We saved the recording and sent it back to Earth as soon as we could. Whatever it was, it could be the biggest discovery of our century. We could come back as heroes. But honestly, I couldn’t care less about that. We might be the first people ever to come in contact with extraterrestrial life. That thought sent shivers down my spine. 

We spent the evening celebrating. There’s no alcohol on the station, but the excitement everyone shared made me feel drunk. We kept talking and laughing and coming up with potential explanations of what the signal might be. There was a feeling of victory and almost childlike curiosity about the unknown. Now both we and the scientists back on Earth had a tough job of trying to decipher the signal.

Our team had three Signal Processing Specialists — 33-year-old Maria Smirnova from Russia, 40-year-old Oliver Allen from the UK, and 25-year-old Mia Gonzales from the US. Mia was the youngest on our team, yet extremely intelligent. All three had experience in analyzing signals from outer space and the deep ocean, yet none of them had any idea what ours meant.

“When we receive signals from a giant star, for example, we can tell almost everything”, Maria explained to me as we were having lunch in the cafeteria block. “We can tell how far away it is, what is happening, and when it happened. This is something completely different. Our computers have no idea. When I'm listening to it, it's like I feel vibrations in my entire body”.

Two weeks went by, and nothing really happened since. There were no more signals that “Ray” could detect, and the team still had no idea what ours could mean or where it could have come from. We were trying our best, but the excitement was slowly dying down. It still felt normal, but not as peaceful as before. Something was changing on the station, and I could feel it. 

One day, I was working with Chen in the control room. He was a 32-year-old Chinese engineer with a kind smile and a quirky sense of humor. The guy was never serious, and if you met him in a bar, you'd think he was an unemployed party animal still living with his parents, but the man was a genius.

We were doing a routine check of life support systems when suddenly I felt a piercing sharp pain in my forehead. It felt like someone put a giant needle through my brain, and now it was about to explode. Everything inside my head was hot and pulsating. I couldn’t sit straight and instinctively put my hand to my head. 

“Are you okay?” Chen’s voice sounded like he was talking from a different dimension. Everything went blurry for a second, and then I managed to focus my eyes. 

“Yes… No… I mean,” the words wouldn’t come out of my mouth. “I don’t know. I just had such a strong headache. I think it’s getting better.” 

“You wanna go to the doctor’s block?” 

“No, it’s… it’s fine.” I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it.

Chen brought me some water. The headache went away as quickly as it started, so we went back to the life support systems. Chen was my favorite person to work with. He always made me laugh and never acted like the smartest person in the room, even though he probably was one. 

I tried not to think much about the incident, but it still bothered me. I’ve never experienced migraines, but my mom did. I remember her lying down on the couch with her palm to her forehead, and my dad would bring her painkillers. She used to take a lot of them, otherwise, she couldn’t even focus. 

Sometimes she would skip work because of migraines, and one day she couldn’t come to my school play. I was hurt, so dad had to explain to me what a migraine was. As for me, though, I’ve never had them. I was always a healthy and athletic child, which eventually helped me get into a space program. I valued my health, and now this? I began to worry that my mom’s genetics had kicked in because of my age or long space missions. I really hoped it wasn’t the case, and well, I soon learned it wasn’t.

There were two doctors on board, and they were working overtime. Every day, several people would come to complain about headaches. It would be normal if one or two astronauts had this problem, but all of us? A bunch of experienced space travelers? Helen, the doctor from the US, tried her best to help us with pills and breathing exercises, but the results were always temporary. Her Russian colleague, Igor, was freaking out. They couldn’t figure out what was causing the headaches. The doctors measured our body temperature and blood pressure. We even went through the CT scanners we had on the station. Nothing was out of the ordinary.

⸻

“I was in a relationship with my ex-boyfriend for about two years. He cheated on me… but this really isn’t about him. He was my first love, and he took my virginity. I loved sex — honestly, I was usually the one who wanted it more than he did.

After we broke up, a few months later, I found myself in a situationship with a guy I slept with. Even from the start — just during the make-out — I felt this deep sense of discomfort, like I was gagging inside. But I still went along with it to see where it would go, mostly out of curiosity. I swallowed the disgust and kept going.

I hated everything about the experience. At one point, I nearly started crying. I didn’t want to do anything — not even go down on him — because it felt boring, gross, and disappointing.

To be fair, the guy was respectful. When I said I wasn’t okay, he stopped, got me some coffee, and cuddled with me. But even that gave me the ick. I started disliking him just because of what happened.

The thing is… I used to like sex. I still think I do. But now, when I try, I just can’t. I don’t want to touch him. I don’t want to do anything. I masturbate, and even that sometimes doesn’t satisfy me anymore.

Maybe I need a spark. Maybe it’s something else. I don’t think I’m asexual — I don’t feel like I am — but my friends keep suggesting it. I just don’t see myself that way, because I do like sex… so why not now? Please, help me understand.”

However, I broke our trust 3 months ago by watching porn and lying about it. Which she almost left me then but didn't and we've been working on it with therapy and lots of late nights. To me everything looked like it was back to normal except she has an eating disorder and has for more than 5 years now which it was getting better. She was doing the best she ever had 3 weeks ago. But then she spiraled and started worse than it's been in a long time for two weeks, to the point of me taking her to the hospital (not knowing she was suffering the way she was with the ed) after that she told me and it felt like she was opening up to me and trusting me again. And she stopped doing what she was for about a week, until yesterday. We went to bed after a small argument which ended healthy with us saying the things were grateful for in life and talking about the future with kids and marriage and all the plans we had together. Then yesterday we woke up perfectly normal, I gave her a kiss and went to work and she did the same. Then on her lunch break, she came home and the eating disorder got to her and in that one moment (30 minutes after she text me and told me she loved our relationship and that I'm the only one for her) she decided that she couldn't be in the relationship and heal at the same time. She had to leave so she packed her stuff and I came home to seeing that. We talked for about 5 hours and it was going good, we got coffee, went to the park and walked, even had sex, but at the end of the night, she left. She felt it was what was right for her. She's done that to me about 6 times where she almost left on an impulse decision but never has but this time she did. No matter how much I reassured her and told her how we would start going to therapy even more than we are now, she left. I know her and I know she loves me and that she doesn't want to leave me (which she's even said) but she felt like it was too late and that she damaged our relationship too much. I feel like I've said everything possible. She's coming tomorrow to get the dog (we got together only a week ago) and we're going to meet up to talk about things. What can I do to prove to her that I'm all in on fixing us and doing everything to help her? How can I make her realize it's not too late and that we still can live the life we've dreamed of together? I know I broke our trust and I started therapy to prove to her that I'm serious when I say I won't watch porn and I gave her parental controls on my phone so I can't even access it. We've gotten through the hard part of that and felt like we've made a good bit of progress so I'm just lost why 3 months later this happens. ",0,1750938778.0,relationship_advice,8,0.5,False

Their neighbor, a nice enough guy, happened to be over. My family are nevermos, but we’ve always respected others and been respected in return.

This neighbor is the classic Mormon bishop type—friendly, but known for occasionally trying to proselytize my dad. My dad would politely listen, then casually pour himself a cup of coffee as a subtle cue that it was time to wrap it up.

As nevermos, my siblings and I never felt pressure to marry young or have kids. During my visit, I ended up chatting with the neighbor. Out of nowhere, he made a comment about how it was “getting late” for me to get married if I wanted to make it into heaven. Then he added, “You know, that could be a sign you’re gay.”

One thing I’ve learned from my dad is that some religious people are just repeating what they’ve been told—ideas they were manipulated into believing without ever questioning.

So I replied, “If that were true, then the golden plates are real.” His face went pale.

I’m not quite like my dad—I don’t just let things slide. I went on to mention that I had a fling with the guy’s daughter while she was married. She had married a closeted Mormon.

He looked over at my parents, then quietly left.

THE MIRROR

A Reflection Without Judgment




""This is not judgment. This is your pattern.""

The Mirror
  “I never expected an answer. Not from the stars. Not from the mess we’ve made. I watched the world unravel like a drunk god’s tapestry – and I stopped asking why a long time ago.
  Most people I know turned away when it got too ugly. I just… kept looking. I told myself that it made me different. It didn’t. I didn’t do anything. I just watched.
  Then the Mirror came.
  And suddenly, watching wasn’t enough.
  No one remembers who first translated the message. It didn’t matter – the words were for everyone, not just the clever or the brave. The signal wasn’t a call, nor a warning. It was simply this:”
	“You were observed. This is your reflection.”
  “The probe never landed. It hovered in the dark above the atmosphere, as still as judgement. It didn’t ask for a response. It didn’t offer help. It played back a hundred years of human noise – wars, celebrations, extinction reports, reality shows, mass graves, wedding vows, genocides, lullabies.
  It didn’t speak in condemnation. It spoke in clarity. And clarity, for the first time in centuries, was unbearable.”

Part I – The Quiet Before

Chapter 1 – Static

  Silas didn’t start the day with anything. No alarm. No schedule. Just the usual weight pressing gently on his chest, the way it always did when the sky turned grey before dawn. He lay there a while, watching the cracked line in the ceiling that spidered out like a forgotten thought.
  Outside, the city hummed its low, chaotic hymn – distant sirens rising and falling like tides, a garbage truck clanging down a side street, someone yelling about a dog that had slipped its leash.
  The world moved. Relentlessly.
  But not forward. Not anymore.
  His apartment was high enough to catch the smog-stained skyline through his window, but not high enough to escape the smell of damp pavement and burnt grease from the shawarma cart that set up at 6:00 AM every morning. He didn’t mind. It was honest.
  The room was quiet. Spartan. A bed. A chair. A desk with a closed notebook and a half-dry pen. There were no family photos. No posters. The only color came from the dying plant by the window, a gift from someone who no longer called.
  Silas didn’t consider himself important. He was a watcher. An observer of the unraveling. And the world – it was unraveling at a polite, almost indifferent pace.
  In the street below, an LED billboard flickered with some hollow optimism: “Live Brighter. Be More.”
  The corner newsstand displayed headlines like confessions:
ECONOMY “RESILIENT” DESPITE UNPRECEDENTED LAYOFFS OCEAN HEATWAVE KILLS MILLIONS OF FISH LEADERS PROMISE CHANGE AT GLOBAL SUMMIT
  A man with bloodshot eyes and a megaphone shouted about the end of times near the transit hub. No one listened, though a few recorded him, already thinking of hashtags. Nearby, a child begged his mother for a toy from a street vendor, who was busy arguing with a police drone over licensing violation.
  Silas watched all of it through the same pane of glass. Observed, absorbed, and filed it away.
  The world, he knew, didn’t need villains anymore. It ran on momentum. On neglect. On systems too old to dismantle and too profitable to change.
  His coffee machine sputtered out a bitter cup. No milk. No sugar. He sipped it like a habit more than a preference.
  He opened the notebook but didn’t write. What was there to say that hadn’t already been ignored?
  By 8:00, the city had fully woken. People rushed though crosswalks, eyes glued to screens, pretending they had somewhere urgent to be. Another billboard flashed a new slogan: 
DON’T WORRY. THE FUTURE IS STABLE.
  Silas chuckled dryly. There was always a new promise. And there were always fewer believers.
  He stood dressed without thought, wrapped in a silence that had become a second skin. Thursdays meant walking to the café. Not because they enjoyed it. But because routine gave shape to the fog.
  Today felt no different.
  Until it did.

Chapter 2: Thursday Ritual

  The café was exactly three and a half blocks from Silas’ apartment – a quiet routine carved into the soft stone of repetition. He didn’t go for the coffee. It wasn’t good. He didn’t go for the people, either. They were mostly background noise. He went because it was predictable. Because something, somewhere, still followed a rhythm.
  On the walk there, Silas passed the same things he always did.
  A rusting traffic light that blinked yellow regardless of the flow of cars, a cracked public service screen displaying outdated air quality stats, the corner newsstand – now a self-serve kiosk with a dead-eyed camera where the clerk used to be. Posters flaked from walls like tired skin: political slogans, band flyers, job ads that had expired years ago.
  He nodded at the preacher on the milk crate. The man shouted about revelation, redemption, and renewal in no particular order; his voice hoarse from years of repeating a gospel no one asked for. Silas didn’t believe in anything the man said, but he respected the consistency.
  Outside the café, the glass door stuck slightly before opening. Inside, it was too bright. The artificial sunlight panels tried too hard to mimic the real thing.
  “Bean There,” the sign read. Still clinging to charm in a world that had long since dulled.
  He ordered the same drink. Black. No small talk. The barista, a girl with earbuds and tired eyes, didn’t even look up. He liked that. He took his usual seat in the back – not near the window, not near the entrance. Just out of the way.
  Around him, people scrolled, typed, muttered. Conversations about nothing. Work. Weather. Whatever problem was trending for the hour.
  Above the counter, a newsfeed looped silently.
GLOBAL SUMMIT ENDS IN STALEMATE TECH CEO CLAIMS AI WILL “SAVE HUMANITY” MASSIVE DIE-OFF IN PACIFIC ECOSYSTEM
 Silas stirred his coffee, though there was nothing in it. He watched the world pretend it wasn’t falling apart.
 9:14 AM
  The screen above the counter flickered. Once. Twice. The black.
	YOU WERE OBSERVED.
  A few people gasped. Someone laughed nervously.
 Then after about eight seconds:
	THIS IS YOUR REFLECTION.
  A low hum began to swell. Not electronic – it vibrated deeper than speakers, deeper than sound.
  The preacher outside had gone silent.
  Silas sat forward, eyes on the screen.
  Not afraid.
  Only waiting.






Part II – The Reflection

Chapter 3 – You Were Observed

  The café was silent.
  Not quiet – silent. Even in a city that thrummed like a restless animal, something had pulled the plug. The hum of conversation, the soft clinks of mugs and cutlery, the always-on background buzz of machines – gone.
  On every screen, the same message glowed in stark, unblinking contrast:
	YOU WERE OBSERVED.
  It was not a warning. Not a threat. Just a statement. And somehow, that made it worse.
  A man near the front tried to restart his tablet. A woman checked her pulse, as if the glitch was in her. The barista, frozen mid-swipe on the register, slowly pulled out her earbuds. No music. No signal.
  Silas didn’t move.
  He felt something he hadn’t felt in years: stillness with purpose. The air itself seemed to wait.
  Then the screen changed.
	WE ARE NOT GODS
	WE ARE NOT JUDGES
	WE ARE NOT SAVIORS
  White words. Black field. No sound. No symbol or origin. It wasn’t a broadcast. It was a presence.
	WE DO NOT OFFER CORRECTION
	WE REFLECT
  Someone at a nearby table whispered, “Is this a hack?”
  Someone else whispered back, “I don’t think anyone could have everything.”
  Silas kept his eyes on the screen. He wasn’t searching for meaning. He was absorbing it.
	YOU HAVE BUILT TO HEAL. AND TO DESTROY.
	YOU HAVE LOVED ACROSS BORDERS. AND KILLED FOR INVISIBLE LINES.
	YOU HAVE FED THE HUNGRY. AND PROFITED FROM STARVATION.
	YOU DREAM. YOU FORGET. YOU REMEMBER. YOU REPEAT.

  The message continued. Unbroken. Neutral.
WE HAVE SEEN YOU HOLD THE DYING IN YOUR ARMS. AND WE HAVE SEEN YOU WALK PAST THEM TO MAKE A CALL.
	YOU VALUE LIFE. UNTIL IT INCONVENIENCES YOU.

  A woman stood up and shouted, “WHO ARE YOU?! WHAT IS THIS?!”
  No response. The message moved on.
	WE DO NOT ASK YOU TO CHANGE. WE ASK ONLY THIS: 
	DID YOU MEAN THE WORDS YOU SAID?
	
	YOU WERE OBSERVED. 
	THIS IS YOUR REFLECTION.
	WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS UP TO YOU.

  The screen went black.
  A long pause. Not just in the café. In the world. Silas could feel it – the absence of noise stretching across continents.
  Someone knocked over a glass. Someone else cried. A man cursed and stormed out.
  Silas remained seated.
  He did not speak. He did not react.
  He simply closed his eyes. 
  And breathed.


Chapter 4: The Mirror Speaks

  The world had no choice but to listen.
  Even in places where connection was sparse, where infrastructure was fragile or firewalled or buried under a regime, the Mirror found a way. It appeared in thought, in screen, in soundwaves, in sensation. No translation was needed. Everyone heard it in their own language. Everyone understood.
  And everyone reacted.
	

Tehran, Iran – Rooftop Garden
A teenage girl watering withered basil plants dropped her can when her radio froze and began broadcasting the message. She stared, breath held, as meaning flooded in.
		“You dream. You forget. You repeat.”
	She whispered it under her breath, as if it were a prayer.

	Berlin, Germany – Public Transit
The tram halted mid-intersection. Screens lining the cabin flickered and unified.  A child stopped whining. A businessman closed his laptop. An elderly woman crossed herself, then looked around to see if anyone else had done the same. They hadn’t
	They were just watching.

	Nairobi, Kenya – Market Square
Vendors stopped mid-sale. Meat sizzled and burned on unattended grills. Above them, a community screen repeated the same calm, unemotional statement:
		“You were observed.”
	Someone muttered, “By what?”
	A stranger answered, “By everything.”

	New York City, USA – Times Square
All the lights went out at once. Then came the text. No ads. No noise. Just one voice speaking in no voice at all. Some cheered. Some panicked. One man fell to his knees and screamed, “I TOLD YOU! I TOLD YOU ALL!”
	A woman beside him simply said, “Shh. It’s not here to hurt us.”

	Rio de Janeiro, Brazil – Hospital Ward
Doctors froze in mid-procedure. A surgeon lowered her scalpel. On a monitor above the patient’s bed, the message played:
	“You have healed the broken. You have broken the healed.”
The surgeon closed her eyes and nodded.

Tokyo, Japan – Convenience Store
Plastic wrapped food sat in motionless shelves. The clerk stopped scanning a customer’s ramen. Both stared at the ceiling screen.
	“This is not judgement. This is your pattern.”
The customer left the food. Didn’t speak. Just walked out.

Cape Town, South Africa – Rooftop
A student livestreamed the message through an old phone, even though every device showed it already. She simply wanted people to know she was there when it happened. In the frame, her face broke into silent tears as the words continued:
	“You risk your lives for strangers. And you step over neighbors in the street.”

Then, the words faded.
  The screens didn’t go dark. Not yet.
  They changed.
  First, a flood of images – not in order, not arranged, just revealed:
A child sharing water with a stray dog under a bombed bridge.
Protesters helping up the very officers who tear-gassed them.
A CEO ignoring an email about poisoned groundwater while boarding a private jet.
A woman giving birth in a refugee tent while others shield her with blankets.
A child burying a plastic toy in cracked earth, whispering, “it’ll grow.”
Faces. Billions of them. Some smiling. Some starving. Some numb.
  The images flickered quickly, then slowed. Some people cried. Some laughed.
  A few turned away.
  Others couldn’t.
  The final frame was not dramatic. It was a satellite photo of a part of Earth at night. Dark oceans. Pinpricks of light. A wounded, beautiful planet breathing beneath layers of history.
  Then black.

Silas – Café 
He did not flinch. Did not check his phone. Around him, people began to unravel. One man demanded the barista explain what was happening. She couldn’t. Another person started filming, hoping to catch panic in real time.
But the screens just kept speaking.
“We have seen civilizations rise and fall. Some chose to adapt. Others refused to see themselves.”
	“The difference was never technology. It was always recognition.”
Silas sipped his coffee. It had gone cold.

Moscow, Russia – Presidential Office
An aide whispered, “We should take action. Denounce it. Counter-message. Something.” 
The president stared at the words, unmoving.
	“What happened next is your decision.”
He replied, “Then let them decide and let them live with it.”

Sydney, Australia – Beachfront
Surfers froze on their boards as the ocean stilled. Radios played the message. Birds ceased their chatter. A woman with salt-white hair smiled at no one in particular, and said, “Maybe now they’ll shup up and listen.” 
The sun rose higher. The words continued. 
And the world – for the first time in remembered history – remained still.

Part III: The Aftermath

Chapter 6: The Days After

  The world did not return to normal.
  Not fully. Not quietly. Not cleanly.
  The Mirror had spoken without language, judged without judgment, and disappeared without explanation. In its wake, humanity did what it always did; it broke apart and tried to put itself back together.

Seven Days Later
  Some news networks looped archived content like nothing had happened. Morning shows joked about weather and fashion, skipping over the glitch in history like a bad headline. Other stations ran panic reels, playing blurry street footage alongside expert panels who speculated, deflected, dismissed.
  One network ran a banner 24/7: 
 WE DO NOT REFLECT TERRORISM.
  But the message had seeded itself deeper than the signal.

Across Cities and Fields
  Memes flooded the internet. Some sincere, others mocking. Hashtags trended and fractured.
#YouWereObserved
#ItWasAI
#TheMirrorLies
#WeRemember
#ReflectionRebellion
  Protests ignited in the name of truth. Or denial. Or reform. No one agreed which was which.
  In Paris, students refused to attend classes unless the Mirror’s words were added to the national curriculum. In Lagos, a mass prayer vigil turned into a communal cleanup effort. In Seoul, digital artists projected Mirror imagery on skyscrapers: the satellite image of Earth, overlayed with a single word: “Decide.”

Governments React
  Some leaders called it a hoax. Others called it a threat. Others, still, used it as cover to accelerate authoritarian controls.
  In California, legislation was rushed to ban AI-generated messages from public broadcast—though no one could prove the Mirror was artificial. In India, a state minister resigned, citing moral reckoning. In Egypt, a pyramid-shaped monument was erected overnight, carved with the words: > “We Saw Ourselves. We Wept.”
  In secret rooms, powerful people asked: 
“Who made it? Where did it come from? Can it come back?”
  No one answered.

The Ones Who Changed
  Some walked away from their lives.
  A hedge fund manager in London donated everything, then disappeared into a reforestation commune in Patagonia. A man in Detroit opened his doors to strangers, turning his home into a shelter with no rules. In São Paulo, a woman organized a choir of former enemies — ex-police, ex-gang members, ex-everything’s — singing only Mirror words, once a day, in open plazas.
  Others went quiet. A different kind of silence. Not numbness. Not fear. Just… space.
  The kind of space needed to listen.

And Silas
  He walked more.
  He watched how people moved differently. He sat on benches he used to avoid. He listened to conversations — not to respond, but to hear them.
  He still said little.
  But he was writing again.
  Nothing poetic. Just observations. Fragments. Questions he didn’t expect to answer.
  One note, scrawled in the margin of his old notebook: 
“Maybe it wasn’t showing us what we did. Maybe it was showing us what we’re still doing.”
  There was no voice from the sky. No follow-up transmission. No second Mirror.
  Just the quiet, living aftermath.
  And the question left behind:
“Now that you’ve seen yourselves, what will you do?”

Chapter 7: Slow Turning

  Weeks have passed.
  The Mirror became a myth in motion.
  Some said it was a trick—clever tech, mass hypnosis, a psychological op. Others called it divine. Still others simply called it real, and left it at that.
  But none of that changed the turning.
  It was slow. Uneven. Messy.
  But it had begun.

  Cities Felt Different
  Not all at once. Not everywhere. But there were signs.
  More people looked up when they walked. More people asked questions and didn’t demand answers. In some places, strangers helped each other without recording it. In others, tension thickened like smoke before a storm.
  Some cities banned public screens altogether. Others installed massive mirrors instead, blank but towering, as if to say, “Look now. Look every day.”

  Silas Drifted Among the Noise.
  He watched the transitions the way he’d watched the collapse—quietly, steadily.
  One afternoon, he stood at a crosswalk where a group of children had chalked Mirror quotes in pastel colors:
“You risk your lives for strangers.”
“You step over neighbors.”
  One phrase was half-erased by wind and time:
“You dream… You forget…”
  Silas knelt down. Without a word, he picked up the chalk and traced the missing letters. The children watched. Then joined him.
  They didn’t ask who he was. They didn’t ask why.
  They just helped.

  He Found Others Like Him
  In small cafés, in old bookstores, on forgotten online forums. People who weren’t trying to lead or convert. Just… understand.
  They spoke little. Listened more.
  They shared dreams they’d had since the Mirror. Most weren’t dreams at all. They were memories — some not even their own. Images that still pulsed beneath the skin, beneath thought.
  One man said he kept hearing a heartbeat whenever he was near crowds. A woman swore she could smell burned earth whenever someone lied. A child described a tower made of voices, humming in unison, only to disappear when she tried to draw it.
  No one laughed. No one doubted. They just listened.

  Elsewhere, Things Broke.
  Governments collapsed in two nations. A megachurch split after its founder declared the Mirror more truthful than scripture. A multinational tech company was dismantled from the inside by its own workers, who released data proving decades of harm.
  The Mirror had said nothing since that day. But the world had not stopped answering.

  Silas’s Notebook Filled.
  It wasn’t stories, or poetry, or philosophy. Just fragments:
A woman at the corner smiled at no one. Still mattered.
Why does silence feel warmer now?
Not all light is forgiveness. Some of it just exposes.
If we wanted to be better, would we know where to start?
  He still lived alone. Still moved quietly through the city. But something had cracked open in him — a small chamber that no longer echoed hollow.
  He thought often of the final line: 
 What happens next is not up to us.
  But maybe, Silas thought, it wasn’t about power.
  Maybe it was about responsibility.

  And so, the world turned.
  Not saved. Not damned. Not settled.
  Just… turning.
  And for once, people felt it.

Chapter 8: The Edge

  There was no final act.
  No second message. No return. The Mirror did not reappear. Had not clarified. It had not warned, or promised, or threatened. It had not asked for devotion. Or apology.
  It had only reflected.
  Now, the world stood at the edge of that reflection.

Some Called It Progress
  New models of governance were emerging. Micro-communities built on shared labor and mutual care. Data transparency initiatives were rooted in ethics rather than profit. A shift in education — fewer lectures, more questions.
  Even the algorithms had changed. Subtly. Silently.
  Search engines began yielding answers framed in context rather than convenience. Recommendation systems offered silence as an option.
  People noticed.
  They weren’t sure if it was the Mirror’s doing — or their own.

Others Dug In
  Religions fractured. Some reformed. Some branded the Mirror as blasphemy, the great deception.
  Militias were formed in isolated pockets, stockpiling belief and ammunition alike. Their slogans varied, but they all circled the same fear:
“It made us look. And we hated what we saw.”
  They rejected not just the message—but the impulse to reflect.

And Then There Were Those Who Waited
  They didn’t speak much. Didn’t claim to understand. They planted trees in dead zones. Repaired broken sidewalks without asking who owned them.
  They taught children how to hold still long enough to notice the wind.
  They weren’t hoping for the Mirror to return. They were preparing for what came next, if it didn’t.

Silas Walked to the Water
  The river that used to smell like waste had begun to run clearer. Not clean. But it was not ruined.
  He sat on a worn bench near the edge, his notebook on his knee, untouched. People passed behind him. Joggers. A man with a cello. A child with a bag of seeds.
  A woman sat beside him without asking. They didn’t speak.
  They watched the surface.
  Clouds broke and reformed.
  A shimmer appeared on the water. Not a screen. Not a message. Just the river reflecting sky.
  Silas blinked. Noticed his face, faint and imperfect, in the ripple. 
  For the first time, he smiled.

The Mirror did not return.
  But in quiet corners, in crowded streets, in ruined places slowly being mended —
people had begun to look at each other differently.
  And some, not all, but some — had begun to see themselves.

The edge was not the end.
  It was a place to decide.
  And the world held its breath again — not for fear.
  But for what might come if it chose to exhale.



Epilogue
 
 You were observed.
  You were shown what you are, what you have done, what you still choose.
  There is no judgment.
  Only the reflection.
  So now the question is yours:
What happens next?

I could use some advice. My Lelit Anita with PID broke under warranty (bought on Amazon for €498), and since it was not repairable, I received a refund. 

So now I'm looking to take the opportunity to upgrade. I currently have the chance to buy one of the following:

1. A used Rancilio Silvia from 2010, lightly used (it was a coffee machine in a mountain house), for about €200.
2. A brand-new Lelit Anna with PID for €500.
3. A used Lelit Victoria for €450.
4. Gaggia Classic Evo Pro?
5. MiCoffee Apex v2? I have some doubts about its build quality...

In any case, I’d pair it with a Baratza Encore ESP grinder.

I’m ruling out the Sage Bambino due to low temperature issue and because I don’t consider it a real upgrade from the Lelit Anita.

My total budget is around €800 for both machine and grinder.

Any suggestions? Thanks

1lkxseb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1lkxseb/my_experience_so_far_2_weeks_positive/,My experience (so far) - 2 weeks - positive,"Hi everyone I thought I'd add my experience here as I found this sub so useful, but also scary in the lead up to my surgery. 

Some background - I am 40, female, healthy weight, and have a connective tissue disorder. I have suffered on and off with tonsillitis and strep throat pretty much my whole life. I've tried to have this surgery 3 times in the past 2 years but I've always been ill and had it cancelled. I'm now 2 weeks out. 

I will say I was so afraid before hand that I wouldn't be able to cope with the pain and I was deathly afraid of bleeding, I almost cancelled. I am so glad I went through with it. 

Day 1 - surgery, went very well. I woke up with some pain and they gave me morphine. I had zero pain for the rest of the day, though I was absolutely miserable with nausea. It took hours and 3 different medications to get the nausea under control. My surgery was around 2pm and I was able to have tea and toast at midnight. I was sipping water throughout the day. I was an inpatient for 1 night due to my connective tissue disorder, it was a precaution due to the ncreased bleeding risk. 

Day 2-5 - pain levels no more than a 4. I set an alarm for every 90 minutes to drink water around the clock and slept with the humidifier on. I was able to eat reasonably normal foods: toast, spaghetti hoops, scrambled eggs, yogurt, protein shakes, pasta. I also carried on having tea and coffee. I was staying on top of my pain relief which at this stage was Cocodamol 15/500 every 6 hours and Diflofenic every 8 hours.

Day 6-9 - pain levels in my throat still not really that bad (strep is much worse), though the pain in my ears increased massively and they felt like they were throbbing at times. I swopped to the stronger cocodamol 30/500 for three days. A couple of miserable moments but nothing dramatic. Eating normal food, I had Chinese food, lasagne, sourdough toast, crisps etc. I also slept pretty normally.

Days 10-12 - pain in my ears mostly went away but pain in my throat increased a bit, maybe more of a 5/6. I also found talking did not feel good. These were the days where I ate the least, and colder foods like ice lollies and ice cream helped.

Day 13-14 - pain has gone, left with the ""something in my throat"" feeling. No pain meds needed. Eating normally again. 

Day 15 - I would say I am pretty much there in terms of recovery. Pain is gone and while my throat doesn't feel quite normal, it's getting there. I still have some scabs and redness. Eating and drinking normally. 

My tips; 
- start taking a stool softener on day 1. I ended up needed to take laxatives to go to the toilet. Pain meds really mess with your stomach. 
- drink water, all day and throughout the night if you can. 
- take your pain meds, you're better staying on top of it than chasing it. 
- I used Colloidal silver spray 2x per day and I think it helped the healing. I also had a spoon of organic good quality manuka honey before bed every night. 
- wash your mouth out after eating and stay in top of brushing your teeth. 
- eat. You heal faster when you're not starving. I lost 2-3lbs over the past couple of weeks, so nothing dramatic. 
- rest. You've just had surgery, let your body heal. 

Overall, I would say my recovery has been a breeze and the pain was always completely manageable. I had zero bleeding at any point. I did take the time off work because the broken sleep adds up and I did feel pretty tired quite a few of the days. Strep throat infections in my experience are much worse than the recovery from this.

1lkxrp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Salary_Strict/comments/1lkxrp3/high_blood_pressure_symptoms_causes_diagnose_and/,"High Blood Pressure - Symptoms, Causes, Diagnose And Treatment","# What is high blood pressure?

Hypertension occurs when your hypertension increases to unhealthy levels. Your hypertension measurement takes into consideration what proportion of blood is passing through your blood vessels and therefore the amount of resistance the blood meets while the guts are pumping.  
  
Narrow arteries increase resistance. The narrower your arteries are, the upper your hypertension is going to be. Over the future, the increased pressure can cause health issues, including heart conditions.  
  
Hypertension is sort of common. In fact, since the rules have recently changed, it’s expected that almost half of American adults will now be diagnosed with this condition.  
  
Hypertension typically develops over the course of several years. Usually, you don’t notice any symptoms. But even without symptoms, high hypertension can cause damage to your blood vessels and organs, especially the brain, heart, eyes, and kidneys.  
  
Early detection is vital. Regular hypertension readings can assist you and your doctor notices any changes. If your hypertension is elevated, your doctor may have you ever check your hypertension over a couple of weeks to ascertain if the amount stays elevated or falls back to normal levels.  
  
Treatment for hypertension includes both prescription medication and healthy lifestyle changes. If the condition isn’t treated, it could lead to health issues, including attacks and strokes.

# What are the symptoms of hypertension?

Hypertension is usually a silent condition. Many of us won’t experience any symptoms. It’s going to take years or maybe decades for the condition to succeed in levels severe enough that symptoms become obvious. Even then, these symptoms could also be attributed to other issues.

# Symptoms of severe hypertension can include:-

* Headaches
* Shortness of breath
* Nosebleeds
* Flushing
* Dizziness
* Chest pain
* Visual changes
* Blood within the urine

These symptoms require immediate medical attention. They don’t occur in everyone with hypertension, but expecting a symbol of this condition to seem might be fatal.  
  
The best thanks to knowing if you've got hypertension is to urge regular hypertension readings. Most doctors’ offices take hypertension reading at every appointment.  
  
If you simply have a yearly physical, ask your doctor about your risks for hypertension and other readings you'll get to assist you to watch your hypertension.  
  
For example, if you've got a case history of heart condition or have risk factors for developing the condition, your doctor may recommend that you simply have your hypertension checked twice a year. This helps you and your doctor stay on top of any possible issues before they become problematic.

# What causes high blood pressure?

There are two sorts of hypertension. Each type features a different cause.

* **Primary hypertension:** Primary hypertension is additionally called hyperpiesia. This type of hypertension develops over time with no identifiable cause. Most people have this sort of high hypertension. Researchers are still unclear what mechanisms cause hypertension to slowly increase. A mixture of things may play a task. These factors include:
* **Genes:** Some people are genetically predisposed to hypertension. This might be from gene mutations or genetic abnormalities inherited from your parents.
* **Physical changes:** If something in your body changes, you'll begin experiencing issues throughout your body. High hypertension could also be one of those issues. For instance, it’s thought that changes in your kidney function thanks to aging may upset the body’s natural balance of salts and fluid. This alteration may cause your body’s hypertension to extend.
* **Environment:** Over time, unhealthy lifestyle choices like lack of physical activity and poor diet can take their toll on your body. Lifestyle choices can cause weight problems. Being overweight or obese can increase your risk of hypertension.

# Secondary hypertension:

Secondary hypertension often occurs quickly and may become more severe than primary hypertension. Several conditions that will cause high blood pressure include:

* kidney disease
* Obstructive Sleep apnea
* Congenital heart defects
* Problems together with your thyroid
* Side effects of medicines
* Use of illegal drugs
* Alcohol abuse or chronic use
* Adrenal gland problems
* Certain endocrine tumors

# Diagnosing Hypertension

  
Diagnosing hypertension is as simple as taking a hypertension reading. Most doctor offices check hypertension as a part of a routine visit. If you don’t receive a hypertension reading at your next appointment, request one.  
  
If your hypertension is elevated, your doctor may request you've got more readings over the course of a couple of days or weeks. A hypertension diagnosis is never given after only one reading. Your doctor must see evidence of a sustained problem. That’s because your environment can contribute to increased hypertension, like the strain you'll feel by being at the doctor’s office. Also, hypertension levels change throughout the day.

If your hypertension remains high, your doctor will likely conduct more tests to rule out underlying conditions. These tests can include:

* Urine test
* Cholesterol screening and other blood tests
* Test your heart’s electrical activity with an electrocardiogram (EKG, sometimes mentioned as an ECG)
* Ultrasound of your heart or kidneys

These tests can help your doctor identify any secondary issues causing your elevated hypertension. They will also check out the consequences high hypertension may have had on your organs.  
  
During this point, your doctor may begin treating your hypertension. Early treatment may reduce your risk of lasting damage.

# How to understand hypertension readings

Two numbers create a hypertension reading:

* **Systolic pressure:** this is often the primary, or top, number. It indicates the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats and radiates blood.
* **Diastolic pressure:** this is often the second, or bottom, number. It’s the reading of the pressure in your arteries between beats of your heart.

Five categories define hypertension readings for adults:

* **Healthy:** A healthy hypertension reading is a smaller amount than 120/80 mm Hg.
* **Elevated:** The systolic number is between 120 and 129 mm Hg, and therefore the diastolic number is a smaller amount than 80 mm Hg. Doctors usually don’t treat elevated hypertension with medication. Instead, your doctor may encourage lifestyle changes to assist lower your numbers.
* **Stage 1 hypertension:** The systolic number is between 130 and 139 mm Hg, or the diastolic number is between 80 and 89 mm Hg.
* **Stage 2 hypertension:** The systolic number is 140 mm Hg or higher, or the diastolic number is 90 mm Hg or higher.
* **Hypertensive crisis:** The systolic number is over 180 mm Hg, or the diastolic number is over 120 mm Hg. Hypertension during this range requires urgent medical attention. If any symptoms like pain, headache, shortness of breath, or visual changes occur when hypertension is that this high, medical aid within the ER is required.

A blood pressure reading is taken with a pressure cuff. For an accurate reading, it’s important you've got a cuff that matches. An ill-fitting cuff may deliver inaccurate readings.  
  
Blood pressure readings are different for youngsters and teenagers. Ask your child’s doctor for the healthy ranges for your child if you’re asked to watch their hypertension.

# Treatment options for hypertension

A number of things help your doctor determine the simplest treatment option for you. These factors include which sort of hypertension you've got and what causes are identified.

# Primary hypertension treatment options

If your doctor diagnoses you with primary hypertension, lifestyle changes may help reduce your high hypertension. If lifestyle changes alone aren’t enough, or if they stop being effective, your doctor may prescribe medication.

# Secondary hypertension treatment options

If your doctor discovers an underlying issue causing your hypertension, treatment will specialize in that other condition. For instance, if a drug you’ve started taking is causing increased hypertension, your doctor will try other medicines that don’t have this side effect.  
  
Sometimes, hypertension is persistent despite treatment for the underlying cause. During this case, your doctor may go with you to develop lifestyle changes and [**prescribe medications**](https://zeelabpharmacy.com/category/prescription-medicines) to assist reduce your hypertension.  
  
Treatment plans for hypertension often evolve. What worked initially may subside useful over time. Your doctor will still work with you to refine your treatment.

# Medication for high hypertension

Many people undergo a trial-and-error phase with [**hypertension medications**](https://zeelabpharmacy.com/product/irbotan-150). You’ll get to try different medicines until you discover one or a mixture of medicines that employment for you.

# Some of the medications wont to treat hypertension include:

* **Beta-blockers:** Beta-blockers make your heart beat slower and with less force. This reduces the quantity of blood pumped through your arteries with each beat, which lowers hypertension. It also blocks certain hormones in your body which will raise your hypertension.
* **Diuretics:** High sodium levels and excess fluid in your body can increase hypertension. Diuretics, also called water pills, help your kidneys remove excess sodium from your body. Because the sodium leaves, extra fluid in your bloodstream moves into your urine, which helps lower your hypertension?**ACE inhibitors:** Angiotensin may be a chemical that causes blood vessels and artery walls to tighten and narrow. ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors prevent the body from producing the maximum amount of this chemical. This helps blood vessels relax and reduces hypertension.
* **Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs):** While ACE inhibitors aim to prevent the creation of angiotensin, ARBs block angiotensin from binding with receptors. Without the chemical, blood vessels won’t tighten. That helps relax vessels and lower hypertension.
* **Calcium channel blockers:** These medications block a number of the calcium from entering the cardiac muscles of your heart. This results in less forceful heartbeats and lower hypertension. These medicines also add blood vessels, causing them to relax and further lowering hypertension.
* **Alpha-2 agonists:** This sort of medication changes the nerve impulses that cause blood vessels to tighten. This helps blood vessels to relax, which reduces hypertension.

# Home remedies for hypertension

Healthy lifestyle changes can assist you to control the factors that cause hypertension. Here are a number of the foremost common home remedies.

# Developing a healthy diet

A heart-healthy diet is significant for helping to scale back high hypertension. It’s also important for managing hypertension that's in check and reducing the danger of complications. These complications include heart condition, stroke, and attack.  
  
A heart-healthy diet emphasizes foods that include:

* Fruits
* Vegetables
* Whole grains
* Lean proteins like fish

**Increasing physical activity**

Reaching a healthy weight should include being more physically active. Additionally to helping you shed pounds, exercise can help reduce stress, lower hypertension naturally, and strengthen your circulatory system. Aim to urge 150 minutes of moderate physical activity weekly. That’s about half-hour five times per week.

**Reaching a healthy weight**

If you're overweight or obese, losing weight through a heart-healthy diet and increased physical activity can help lower your hypertension.

# Managing stress

Exercise **may be a good way** to manage stress. Other activities **also can** be helpful. These include:

* Meditation
* Deep breathing
* Massage
* Muscle relaxation
* Yoga

These are all proven stress-reducing techniques. Getting adequate sleep **also can** help reduce stress levels.

# Adopting a cleaner lifestyle

If you’re a smoker, attempt to quit. The chemicals in tobacco smoke damage the body’s tissues and harden vessel walls.  
  
If you often consume an excessive amount of alcohol or have an alcohol dependency, seek help to scale back the quantity you drink or stop altogether. Alcohol can raise hypertension.

# Dietary recommendations for people with high hypertension

One of the simplest ways you'll treat hypertension and stop possible complications is through your diet. What you eat can go an extended way toward easing or eliminating hypertension.  
  
Here are a number of the foremost common dietary recommendations for people with hypertension.

# Eat less meat, more plants

A plant-based diet is a simple way to increase fiber and reduce the quantity of sodium and unhealthy saturated and trans fat you're taking in from dairy foods and meat. Increase the number of fruits, vegetables, leafy greens, and whole grains you’re eating. Rather than meat, choose healthier lean proteins like fish, poultry, or tofu.

# Reduce dietary sodium

People with hypertension and people with an increased risk for a heart condition may have to stay their daily sodium intake between 1,500 milligrams to 2300 milligrams per day. The simplest thanks to reducing sodium are to cook fresh foods more often. Avoid eating restaurant food or pre-packaged foods, which are often very high in sodium.

# Cut back on sweets

Sugary foods and beverages contain empty calories but don’t have nutritional content. If you would like something sweet, try eating fresh fruit or small amounts of bittersweet chocolate that haven’t been sweetened the maximum amount with sugar. Studies suggest regularly eating bittersweet chocolate may reduce hypertension.

# High hypertension during pregnancy

Women with hypertension can deliver healthy babies despite having the condition. But it is often dangerous to both mother and baby if it’s not monitored closely and managed during the pregnancy.  
  
Women with high hypertension are more likely to develop complications. E.g., pregnant women with hypertension may experience decreased kidney function. Babies born to mothers with hypertension may have a coffee birth weight or change state prematurely.  
  
Some women may develop hypertension during their pregnancies. Several types of high hypertension problems can develop. The condition often reverses itself once the baby is born. Developing hypertension during pregnancy may increase your risk of developing hypertension later in life.

# Preeclampsia

In some cases, pregnant women with hypertension may develop preeclampsia during their pregnancy. This condition of increased hypertension can cause kidney and other organ complications. This will end in high protein levels within the urine, problems with liver function, the fluid within the lungs, or visual problems.  
  
As this condition worsens, the risks increase for the mother and baby. Preeclampsia can cause eclampsia, which causes seizures. High hypertension problems in pregnancy remain a crucial explanation for maternal death within us. Complications for the baby include low birth weight, early birth, and stillbirth.  
  
There are no known thanks to preventing preeclampsia, and therefore the only thanks to treating the condition are to deliver the baby. If you develop this condition during your pregnancy, your doctor will closely monitor you for complications.

# What are the consequences of high hypertension on the body?

Because hypertension is usually a silent condition, it can cause damage to your body for years before symptoms become obvious. If hypertension isn’t treated, you'll face serious, even fatal, complications.  
Complications of hypertension include the subsequent.

# Damaged Arteries 

Healthy arteries are flexible and powerful. Blood flows freely and unobstructed through healthy arteries and vessels.  
  
Hypertension makes arteries tougher, tighter, and fewer elastic. This damage makes it easier for dietary fats to deposit in your arteries and restrict blood flow. This damage can cause increased hypertension, blockages, and, eventually, attack and stroke.

# Damaged heart

Hypertension makes your heart work too hard. The increased pressure in your blood vessels forces your heart’s muscles to pump more frequently and with more force than a healthy heart should need to.  
  
This may cause cardiomegaly. Cardiomegaly increases your risk for the following:

* Heart failure
* Arrhythmias
* Sudden cardiac death
* Heart attack

# Damaged brain

Your brain relies on a healthy supply of oxygen-rich blood to figure properly. High hypertension can reduce your brain’s supply of blood:

* Temporary blockages of blood flow to the brain are called transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).
* Significant blockages of blood flow cause brain cells to die. This is often referred to as a stroke.

  
Uncontrolled hypertension can also affect your memory and skill to find out, recall, speak, and reason. [**Treating hypertension**](https://zeelabpharmacy.com/product/telmizem-40) often doesn’t erase or reverse the consequences of uncontrolled hypertension. It does, however, lower the risks for future problems.

# High blood pressure: Tips for prevention

If you've got risk factors for hypertension, you'll take steps now to lower your risk for the condition and its complications.

# Add healthy foods to your diet



slowly work your way up to eating more servings of heart-healthy plants. Aim to eat quite seven servings of fruits and vegetables every day. Then aim to feature another serving per day for 2 weeks. After that fortnight, aim to feature another serving. The goal is to possess ten servings of fruits and vegetables per day.

# Adjust how you think that of the typical plate

Instead of having meat and three sides, create a dish that uses meat as a condiment. In other words, rather than eating a steak with a side salad, eat a much bigger salad and top it with a smaller portion of steak.

# Cut sugar

Try to incorporate fewer sugar-sweetened foods, including flavored yogurts, cereals, and sodas. Packaged foods hide unnecessary sugar, so make certain to read labels.

# Set weight loss goals

Instead of an arbitrary goal to “lose weight,” talk together with your doctor a few healthy weight for you. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a weight loss goal of 1 to 2 pounds every week. Meaning beginning eating 500 calories less per day than what you normally eat. Then choose what physical activity you'll start so as to succeed in that goal. If exercising five nights every week is just too hard to figure into your schedule, aim for another night than what you’re doing immediately. When that matches comfortably into your schedule, add another night.

They got them, and then were asking me for the three euro it cost. Now, I know you can look at it either way, you know, it's only three euro, surely you can pay it back, but I just feel like it's something so small, couldn't they buy a pack of brushes for me?

My two methods right now are V60 and French Press. Usually when doing a V60 pour I tend to have some drainage problems going through the V60. After bloom and half way through second pour, coffee stops and literally drips. I toss this up to the cheap electric blade grinder, makes sense. However, this morning, instead of having to deal with it and just waiting on a hand grinder to come in, I made a French press. I would say the grounds were pretty coarse (about 28g at 6 seconds in the grinder). The brew finished and I poured the coffee through my V60 with a filter paper. After about 100-125g the coffee backed up in the filter and again slowed to a drip. Just filter paper in the V60. 

I feel that the grinder may have made fines so small it passed through the mesh of the French press and clogged the filter paper (which I find a bit hard to believe but I could see it) or I’m messing up something in the filter set up on the V60:
Fold filter on seam
Put in V60
Wet with hot filter water
Pour coffee through it

I’m curious what others may think.

1lkxnlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/PandaExpress/comments/1lkxnlv/why_does_it_make_me_feel_this_way/,Why does it make me feel this way?,"I apologize for the lengthy post, but appreciate anyone for taking the time to read and share their thoughts. 

So we recently (in the last 6 months) got a Panda Express in my town. I haven’t ate Panda Express in several years, neither had my husband. We were both excited, as was the rest of the town!

We have ate here maybe 3-4 times since they’ve opened. My parents just tried it for the first time this past weekend. 

Now….

I’ve got a concern….. and I want to see if anyone else has had this same issue or may have any incite to the cause. I’ve contacted corporate to see if this is a thing but they’re saying no. I’ve found minimal articles about it online with others expressing the same thing but no answers further….

Within 30 minutes (give or take) after eating Panda Express my chest feels like it’s going to the races. Not only does it race, but it hurts, and gives me the worst feeling. The same type of feeling as if you drank multiple high dose energy drinks back to back super quickly. Like a super shot of cocaine directly to the heart type feeling. 

Not only am I having this feeling, but my mom (who like I said just recently tried it) mentioned how she felt and it was exactly how I described it to my husband when we first ate it. She said it felt more like a heart attack or extreme anxiety attack. I had brushed it off every time to anxiety or whatever myself and moved on with life after eating it every time we have had it. But then my husband mentioned it last night after eating our daughters leftovers too and so did our daughter (10) who acts like she’s not had her medications after eating it every time (she’s ADHD but more on the severe side of hyper lol). My husband said he’s felt it before the last couple time we ate from here but ignored it unless I brought it up.

We eat and cook Asian food often. Always have. But this only happens at Panda Express. Yes I know their sodium content is high, but so is packaged ramen and we eat it often, as well as other fast foods and we eat them somewhat often too. And my husband drinks high caffeine drinks and expresses the feeling is similar but 10x more intense. Also… We’re from the south, so if it isn’t flavorful or have high amounts of salt then it ain’t being ate! So this is weird to me. 

Nothing, and I mean nothing else does this. Besides high caffeine content. Like I’m talking if I drink multiple at once super fast back to back, not that I’ve ever done it because one energy drink is too much for me. My husband tho, yeah but he even said this was weird to him. 

We use soy sauce, soy products sometimes, and msg never bothered any of us before (also Panda Express claims they do not use msg itself but soy in soy sauce does produce it). And soda/caffeine from their drinks wouldn’t be a thing because we drinks soda/teas/coffees on the reg! 

Do we chalk it up to unfortunate? Or does anyone have any sort of idea what could cause it? Has this happened to anyone before????? I’m so sad because it’s so delicious lol ",1,1750937107.0,PandaExpress,2,1.0,False

I'm looking for someone to play as my adult daughter who's home from college for the summer. We live far away for everything so it's just us at home a lot of the time and the job you had lined up fell through so you are home most of the time.

You help around the house a lot but most of the summer has been filled with Netflix, some gaming and porn.. and as the summer wore on it was pretty much exclusively porn.

I want to play out a scene where dad has noticed how good you look he gets turned on quite a bit just looking at you in your tight shorts or doing your yoga..or sometimes even just watching you doing the dishes in a cute skirt.

He can't seem to keep his hands to himself and really is obsessed with your ass (or legs or tits or whatever you are most proud of)

For your part porn has warped your brain to enjoy the attention. your body always responds and even though it feels weird it does not take much convincing for you to agree to ""help out"" dad.

---+

We could play out our first forray into the lewd and wonderful world of daddy daughter fun.

Maybe you agree to be his ""inspiration"" and let him grope you and  jerk of to the sight of your sexy body.

Or we could play out a later scene where an otherwise wholesome daddy daughter interaction takes a kinky turn. Settling in to watch some Netflix, you're trying to get the HDMI cable into the back of the TV. On your hands and knees you inadvertently shake your cute ass at dad for 5 min. 

By the time your finish he's too wound up to do anything but grope you and complement your lovely ""shorts"". You find yourself on your knees in no time with his large daddy cock in your mouth and his holding your ponytail loosely as he showers you with inappropriate complements and lewd comments. And before you know it your bent over the coffee table naked except for your socks. Face beet red and pussy throbbing with pleasure. Daddies big hands holding your hips, keeping you pinned to the table. Him pumping away as he enjoys your lovely eager pussy and gets ready to give you yet another daddy cream pie.

You get the idea, happy to include whatever kinks just no extreme pain or anything that should be in a bathroom.

-My period is expected to come between the 2nd-4th of next month per my apps. 

-unprotected sex not even 24 hours before LH surge
-Plan B was taken right after the LH surge peaked (assuming it happened over night by the ovulation strips)

-I do not experience PMS symptoms. Barely do I get sore boobs and if I get cramps it’s like a day or two before hand, not a week and a half or longer. 

-I have taken a FRER test this morning when I woke up and it was negative, I feel based on the time line I (would/could/should?) definitely have a faint positive at minimum.      

So I am 99% certain I’m not pregnant but how I’m feeling does not ease my mind at all. And I can’t know for sure without my period. 

I know the possibility of this all being Plan B/Take Action (I took Take Action) pill causing my symptoms but it seems a little excessive and I feel it’s on the lesser side of how many people run into this. I refuse to buy anymore tests. 

I have pretty high anxiety so I don’t know that I can just wait around for my period, especially if this is Plan B bill messing with me and who knows when my period will come. I’ve seen people say it came days early after it or months late. Should I just go get a blood test to confirm? 

Sex early hours of the 15th
LH Surge happened over night into the 16th (it was going down by 12pm)
Took Plan also at 12pm)

Please don’t comment “if you don’t want to get pregnant wear a condom” that is far from the point here nor am I unaware of that. 

Thanks!!

I guess I should add, I have sore nipples like insanely sore, today doesn’t seem to be as bad at the moment, cramping, I’ve had a suppression of appetite on and off, slight back ache and (I think?) I have been using the bathroom a little bit more? I feel that is an easy thing to make your body feel so I’m on the fence about that one. I also go number 2 like clock work, but now I feel like I’m half constipated, is that a thing? I feel I’ve only been able to go when I drink coffee. So I guess also on the fence!

**Nuisance complaint**
A homeowner on Zandale Drive (directly across from Breckenwood Drive) continues to put cones in front of their house on a public street to prevent people from parking in front of their house. This is a public street, not private. They do not get special treatment over the others on that street just because they purchased some cones. Please give them notice to remove the cones and ask they do not put cones back out.

1lkxfx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoHeidiLita/comments/1lkxfx1/june_26/,June 26,"7:00am, Heidi, “Home.”

Yesterday Dee came by the class and asked whether I would go with her to take the girls ice-skating. “Julie is tied down with the end-of-month and half-year accounting. I need help!” So began an invite that changed my life.

I know that Dee is considered the “clan leader” of the Big Four but I didn’t know why. In fact, most of my interactions as a camper and staff member have been with Julie and, to a lesser extent, Guy. So what’s this Dee Clan Mother all about?

Once we got to the rink the Twinettes are on autopilot. Dei and Lori also “big-sib” them. Instead of renting skates Dee told me, let’s get some coffee. Right away she picked at my scab. “Are you all settled in? Everything OK with your living situation with Bernie and Artie? Did your grades come in and are you satisfied? Are you enjoying the work at Longhouse Elem?” 

I had short “yes” answers to everything except the grades because report cards are only given out on Thursday (today), the last day of school and I will have to wait until they are mailed out.

“I don’t want to waste time and beat around the bush,” Dee said. “So, what’s bothering you? You seem heavy and I haven’t heard you practice. Isn’t that your main goal to use your free time after work to get ready for your audition?”

Of course, the waters started flowing at Heidi Falls. “I love working with the kids but I don’t have the same type of interest as Lolita. She’s busy taking notes every minute, analyzing them at night, preparing them for some type of paper she’s doing for her course. I know that’s the time I should be practicing but I can’t.”

“Why not?”

“Well, at home I have my studio where I practice; I don’t bother anyone, and no one bothers me. At school, Jammy has our own practice room. I don’t know how to describe it, but practicing is deeply personal. Even playing scales and chords jams the mind. I’m listening to every note and interval, constantly critiquing myself, and adjusting. I’m learning my second audition piece now and it’s like I teletransport myself from Heidi World to Bach World. I am present but not present. I so deeply love my two pieces. I’m also behind on unlocking the “Sinatra and Strings” album which overwhelms me with its beauty. 

“I appreciate it that you guys tuned the piano in the Rec Room but I feel like I’m in a fishtank with people coming and going. I can set up my electric piano anywhere and play through my earphones but there’s really not room for it in the apartment.”

“What’s wrong with being in a fishtank?” Dee asked. “To be the type of musician that I think you want to be, you have to radiate out and not let your environment invade your head. But I get it and have an idea. Why not set up camp in the second warming hut? Guy has big plans for it in the Fall but I think you and he can coordinate together. We can’t exclude the summer clients from using it, but we can set up rules. ‘Sit and listen, no talking when Heidi is practicing.’ From time-to-time you can explain to anyone there what exactly you are doing and what’s in your mind as you play.”

Interesting. It’s a solution!

“But there is something else bothering you. I can tell. Don’t evade me.”

Back to Heidi Falls. “I feel so empty when I’m working with the kids. I don’t feel like I have anything to offer or to teach. I watch Lolita, Anita, and Michael and it seems they are so deeply engaged in the moment of teaching. I think their minds are going to levels of a thought or experience bank that I can’t access. I feel deeply lonely. And when they talk about POC or trauma, I feel like it’s not part of my growing up as a privileged Jewish white kid.”

And here is where Dee hit the homerun. “Your two problems are actually one and the same. A lot of thought went into choosing you as well as the other three as our consultants. Heidi, it’s not because you have teaching skills. It’s because you have learning skills! 

“I actually read your posts. Tell me if I’m wrong, but you are the one who chose to leave an elite school of privilege to attend a public high school. You never quit the path Julie set up for you in music. You had the courage to work on music that most kids your age don’t like or understand. You transplanted yourself to the East Bronx. You had the courage to drop out of the high track of courses to make room for music. You volunteer with middle school girls in the Children’s Protective Services system. You started and played with bands, learned accordion, undertook a soul-wrenching college search, sought out a college mentor, continued your sports, ran a half-marathon, and found your soulmate. We hired you because you are a learner. You demonstrate to the kids how to learn independently. That's one of the key goals of our school!

“You need to connect the two cables. You don’t need to be a master teacher to the kids. Relax and just enjoy being with them. You need to flip the coin and demonstrate what it is like to be a master learner. Have fun with the kids during the day and then be deadly relentless afterschool when you practice.”

It all clicked, and I felt I could do this. When I got home after ice-skating, I just went into the Rec Room and practiced my heart out regardless of what was happening outside of me. 

Dee asked Chima to set up the warming hut for me today. But she asked me to take the day off. She wants me to take “her vagus nerve treatment” that she developed to help Guy and Julie overcome attacks of stress and trauma. I’ve read about it on the other Reddit site and I’m excited to give it a try.

Meanwhile, My Love is happy because she says her Kitten is back!",0,1750936363.0,LoHeidiLita,0,0.5,False
1lkxfol,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1lkxfol/vasospastic_angina_at_26/,Vasospastic Angina at 26,"Hi, so to be as open and clear as possible, I 26M, am having intermittent chest pains. These pains happen at rest and are made worse by caffeine, nicotine and ibuprofen. I know this because I was a monster energy and vape addict for years and have had to basically quit both cold turkey completely due to the pains. I went to A&E (ER) as I had a spontaneous pneumothorax two weeks prior and although this pain was not the same and my breathing was physically fine (I felt like I wasn't getting enough oxygen but could breathe fully, unlike when my lung collapsed and I could only take shallow breaths) I wanted to make sure it wasn't related. The doctor sent me home after an EKG and a chest X-ray telling me it was inflammation in my chest, (I assume he was implying costochondritis or pleurisy) so I started taking ibuprofen and that's when hell started. I had pains in my chest through to my back that were borderline debilitating that lasted ages. It was at this point I started looking for other explanations as if it was inflammation ibuprofen should've made it better, not worse.

I cut vaping as this was the most immediately identifiable trigger as within 15 seconds of even holding the vape in my mouth (no inhaling) I would begin to get pains. Then I noticed coca cola causing a milder version of these pains a few minutes after consuming and cut that too. Monster also has a similar effect although not as bad as nicotine or coca cola (I assume because of the amount of other ingredients, such as niacin, countering the vasoconstrictor effects of the caffeine). I have also been waking up at night with these pains, although brief and mild compared to the ones from the triggers, but still uncomfortable and not so fun. I also typically smoke weed and have stopped this too, although I have not linked it directly to the pain (not that it wasn't causing it, just that I haven't confirmed that) the anxiety I experienced when stoned had gotten insane and was not worth it so not sure if that's affected my sleep too.

I then came across variant angina and this was the first time that my symptoms fully aligned with anything I'd come across.
I have been to my GP and he has referred me to a rapid chest pain clinic (or something?) as he said the cardiologist would be a two year waiting list, but also informed me that the rapid chest pain clinic is likely to reject me due to my age. He was considering prescribing me glycerin spray but chose not to as I have low blood pressure and he's worried about fainting. Instead he prescribed me omeprazole to rule out acid reflux as the cause, although I've been taking antacids and pepto bismol to no effect.

I'm looking for advice on whether it is worth going private for a diagnosis if my referral is rejected as I cannot live like this, I am limited to water and my sleep is awful, I'm considering getting a nicotine free vape liquid as my cravings have been driving me insane and if it is the nicotine that was causing the problem then nic free vape should be ok? And hopefully help with the habit.

P.S. - if anyone could tell me why this has happened so suddenly and out of nowhere, I have done cocaine a few times before but it's been years since the last time and it was never a habit, just the odd special occasion, I have been drinking monsters and coffee consistently for at least 6 years and been smoking weed for 6 years and cigarettes for 4 then vaped for 6 (9 years on nicotine in total) since stopping chest pains are much less common but still occur at rest, especially at night...

So I’m 22f, I relocated to be with my partner last year so we live about 4 hours from all my friends and family🥲 I’ve always been very anxious and have struggled when it comes to making new friends. I started a new job up here and really hit it off with one of my colleagues (26f). Within a couple of months we were going out for drinks, coffee, shopping etc but the closer and closer we got the more draining I found her to be. I couldn’t avoid her as we worked together 5 days a week but I have since left this job and she is still very overbearing and gives me no space. 
When we go out for drinks she always invites her other guy friends and tries to put me down in front of them, if we end up meeting my boyfriend while we’re out she goes wayyy OTT and tries to make me jealous (girl ur 4 years older than us and he hates u🥴)
She has previously flirted with my boyfriend’s friends in front of her own boyfriend, proceeded to start a fight with a professional fighter and got my boyfriends friends involved then went home. My boyfriends friends obviously ran to her defence after she flirted with them and got beat up because of this but she laughed when I told her what happened xx 
She messages me CONSTANTLY about negative things like go to therapy we all got our own shit😭 and I do try to be there for her but she ends up dragging me down with her. 
My boyfriend says he’s noticed a difference in me since I became friendly with her and not in a good way. 
I’ve tried to distance myself from her, told her I needed space etc. I had a particularly busy week last week and was away at a festival but because I didn’t reply to her messages for 3 days she said she nearly called the police to carry out a welfare check😭 it’s not the first time she’s threatened to call the police because I haven’t responded. 
Basically I feel horribly trapped, smothered and dragged down by this girl. She’s not a nice person and I don’t want her in my life. 
How can I escape without it being too explosive??

i then heated the pot on medium heat and turned it to low when the coffee started to come out (which looks way better). 
once it started sputtering at the end i took it off the heat (as im assuming that counts as the end of the brewing process).

I did my first test on the 23.06.2025, my bilirubin levels came back slightly elevated, between 28-29.

I started using Lactobiotic, Vitamin D3, Omega 3 + Vitamin E, cuz i thought they would help me lower my bilirubin levels.

My bilirubin levels are 50 now, and i still feel the same. No noticable changes in my appearance, no pain, nothing. But my mom is going batshit crazy, she thinks that i'm dying or something.

I'll probably go to the doctor's office tomorrow morning, so that's why i'm here asking. I want your guys opinions on what it could be.

I’m heading to Boom Festival solo at first, but would love to connect with fellow travelers early on!  Here’s my plan:

* **Barcelona on the 15th July**: I’ll be in the city a day before—happy to meet up for a coffee or explore together if anyone’s around!
* **Boom Bus from Madrid on the 16th**: My flight lands at 8.30am, and I’d love company on the shuttle ride. We could start a little crew before my friends join me later in the day!

**About me**:

* 38M from Nepal, second-time Boomer (went in 2022—mind blown! 🤯).
* Music lover: psytrance, deep house, techno… but also obsessed with Boom’s workshops (the ecstatic dance and singing sessions were life-changing last time!).
* Chill, open-minded, and here for the vibes, dance, and deep connections.

**My situation:**

I’ll be solo at first, but a few friends are joining me later on the 16th. Until then, I’d love to meet fellow wanderers to share the early excitement, travel together, and maybe even camp near each other!

If you’re planning to take the bus around the same time, in Barcelona on the 15th, or just want to chat before the festival, hit me up! Let’s make the journey as epic as the destination. 🚌💃

We're 7 of us, a very adventurous, sporty family though my parents are 60+ and my sister is pregnant (still sporty etc but starting to feel quite fatigued) so I want to be wary of too much activity or time in the sun. I know the area quite well so I want to show them some of my favourite spots. I'm paying for the day for all of us, so I don't want to go to expensive restaurants etc. 

Below is my planned itinerary, please let me know of any comments or suggestions! I've put the rough timing at the beginning of each point.

1. [10h30] Our bus from the Alps 🏔️ will arrive at Grand Arenas at 1030am, next Wednesday
2 [11h30-13h00] I want to then catch the TER to Beaulieu-sur-mer to then walk/bus to Villa Ephrussi de Rothschild🪴 (which I love), and spend 1-1.5hrs there (perhaps some time to relax at the cafe). 
3. [13h00-15h00] For lunch, I had thought of Villefranche but it's clumsy to get there. I'm thinking of going to Port Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat to get a simple lunch and some beers, or a picnic and taking that to Plage de la Fosse (or any other shadier beach?). 
4a. [15h00-17h30] Then we will take the Bus 15 back towards Nice and split off. My sister and anyone else tired will take the bus through to near Port Lympia/Place Garibaldi and relax in a coffee shop there.
4b. [15h00-17h30] The rest of us will get of Bus 15 near Mont Boron, take a nice walk and go swim at this place I love at Jardin Felix Rainaud (a small rocky beach). We'll then walk past the port to join the rest at Place Garibaldi.
5. [17h30-18h00] Then, we will catch the tram L2 back to Grand Arenas in time for our 18h30 bus back into the Alps.

1lkwzbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lkwzbl/the_attention_trap_when_dating_as_a_woman_becomes/,"The attention trap, when dating as a woman becomes a dopamine fix","I recently realized one of the hidden dangers of modern dating, especially as a woman. It starts off subtly…a guy you’re genuinely interested in doesn’t message you one morning like he usually does. Rationally, you know people get busy. But emotionally, your brain feels it like a withdrawal. Because you’re not just attached to him, you’re attached to the feeling he gave you. The dopamine. The validation. The hit.

And that’s where the trap begins.

Like an addict, you find yourself reaching for the next “fix.” Another guy, another conversation. It’s easy to justify “If he won’t give me attention, someone else will.” Now you’re texting two guys. One you actually care about but feel let down by, and another who was only meant to be a distraction. Before you know it, you’re juggling seven conversations, but the only one that ever really mattered to you was the first.

People often say, “If he liked you, you’d know. There would be no doubt.” But that’s not really the issue. The issue is you’re not looking for options, you’re coping. You’re numbing the sting of vulnerability with the attention of others. You’re self medicating with male validation.

This pattern became even clearer to me recently.

I started talking to someone online. At first, it was innocent he seemed sweet, and I even encouraged him to date other people after his divorce. But slowly, our conversations deepened. We began to talk seriously about meeting. We even had a sexual chat yesterday. Then suddenly he went silent.

No “good morning.” No follow up.

And just like that, my nervous system freaked out. I started thinking about messaging someone else. Not because I like them, but because my brain wanted the dopamine rush back. That hit that tells you, “You’re still wanted.”

I did some reading and psychologically, this is called an intermittent reinforcement cycle, and it’s powerful. It’s the same reward system slot machines use, the unpredictability of the reward (attention, in this case) makes it even more addictive. Combine that with an anxious attachment style, and you start mistaking emotional panic for romantic intuition.

So I paused. I asked myself: What is the point of texting someone else? Is it about connection or control? Is it about my heart or my ego?

I had to admit, it was ego. It was fear. It was a coping mechanism.

It reminded me of something that happened with a former friend. She started using Tinder heavily after finding out I’d met my ex there. Dating apps, are far more favorable to women in terms of attention they create a surplus of matches and messages. She’d leave mid conversation to go on random coffee dates. When I expressed concern, she said she was “just getting to know people.”

Then one day at uni, she told me she had a dilemma. She liked one guy, but he hadn’t confirmed their date. Feeling snubbed, she scheduled another date for the same evening, while already having a date with a different guy in the morning. When the original guy finally messaged her, she panicked she had accidentally triple booked.

She wanted me to take photos with her at an art fair to fake a prior commitment. I told her no. I also told her to think about how she’d feel if someone did that to her.

The real issue wasn’t logistics, it was addiction. She wasn’t dating for connection. She was dating for reassurance.

And I realized I am doing the same. Even if I am technically not dating anyone and I am just talking to this guy. 

Attention is intoxicating. We chase not love, but proof that we’re desirable, worthy, seen. But it comes at a cost. 

So I’ve decided I’m done wasting energy on men I don’t genuinely care about.

So here I am. Choosing to sit with the discomfort instead of running from it. No distractions, no dopamine patches. Just me, letting the moment pass.

Because healing doesn’t always come from the next conversation. Sometimes it comes from learning to tolerate silence",59,1750934800.0,dating_advice,40,0.89,False
1lkwyqh,https://i.redd.it/fci87pay399f1.png,"Leaping Into the Unknown – Art, Light and the Polarized Soul","Hey fellow LightTravellers,

Thanjs to yesterday’s coffee talk, I’ve been reflecting on the strange split we’re witnessing in our collective psyche. People today seem pulled in two directions: chasing adrenaline-fueled extremes like bungee jumping, or retreating into silence, booking weeks of retreat vacation, longing to feel something real again.

Why?

We live in a polarized time, saturated with fear, political noise, and uncertainty. And when we’re paralyzed by fear, the first to suffer are the artists - those delicate souls who rely on a culture of risk-takers, of dreamers willing to bet their lives on beauty, on meaning.
As I see it, if you were meant to leap and you don’t - life will conspire to push you off that edge anyway. One way or another, the soul will be called to move.

That’s why I’ve found Lightbathing, and our growing community, to be a rare sanctuary. 

A place where the leap is inward - into altered states, into creativity, into deep witnessing.
Light technology like LOOM and LIBA makes these inner thresholds accessible, elegant, and real.

We talk a lot about brainwaves and frequencies, but we mustn’t forget the poetic aspect of this work: the part that Tarkovsky or Kurosawa might understand.
Some films, like light sessions, are portals. They don’t just entertain, they initiate.

David from @PeaceIsCottage IG shared with us a few that have been deeply resonant: 

[The Mirror – Andrei Tarkovsky]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrMINC5xjMs)
[Andrei Rublev]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je75FDjcUP4) – Tarkovsky again, a masterpiece on the sacred and the artistic
[Ikiru (1952)]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VeLN3IDjzQ) – Kurosawa’s meditation on meaning and mortality
[Last Tango in Paris]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o35Z4ue0BPI) – for its raw emotional risk
[The Magick Lantern Cycle]( https://www.themoviedb.org/collection/53043-the-magick-lantern-cycle) – Kenneth Anger’s dreamlike ritual cinema
and [Towers Open Fire]( https://archive.org/details/info_alibros_Info_201906) – William S. Burroughs & Anthony Balch’s surrealist burst (Dream Machine legacy) and [Naked Lunch]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bgrNm7rdeo) – Cronenberg’s psychic fever dream of Burroughs’ inner worlds

These films, like the Lightbath sessions, invite us into altered states of perception - not to escape reality, but to deepen our relationship with it.

We also touched on the idea of making things quickly, like Picasso, who once sketched something in 30 seconds and when asked why it cost so much, replied: “It took me a lifetime to do it in thirty seconds.”

That speed—when it comes—isn’t about rushing. It’s about embodied mastery. About letting the soul flow through without friction. And that’s deeply relevant to light practice, too: when the mind gets out of the way, the transmission becomes immediate.

In the same breath, we honored the true spirit of outsider art: which is not made for the market, not made to be liked, but made because the artist had no other choice. Lightbathing often evokes that same energy: what’s revealed in the flicker is pure, raw, and beyond words. Not polished, not performative. Just real.

This is where healing happens. And where beauty lives.

Hope to see you at the next free Lightbath Coffee Talk, where these threads of light, art, and consciousness always find new weavings.

1lkwv1c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lkwv1c,Looking to improve the Maestri House S3 Brew Ratio Scale,"***This post Approved by the mod team — thanks mods!***

Hi everyone,

We’re the team behind the [Maestri House S3 Brew Ratio Scale.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3CZRT3C) A few days ago, we were lucky enough to have a user here[ share their experience with our scale](https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1l84dhq/buy_it_29_maestri_house_s3_g_brew_ratio_scale/) , and we’ve been blown away by the thoughtful feedback from the Sub

Several of you mentioned that you’ve purchased the scale, so first: thank you! We hope it’s been a good experience so far. We’ve also received some valuable feedback, which is why we’re here today.

One user even told us:[ “The biggest issue is, the timer stops when you lift the dripper... brew time is no longer accurate, and there's no way to resume timing.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/s/vlt7GTXdA0)

Another pointed out:“Many recipes call for agitation or swirling mid-brew... if the scale just kept running until manually stopped, it would remove a real frustration.”

Based on this feedback, we’re exploring two changes — but we want your input before we move forward:

1. Manual timer control (no more auto-stop) We’re thinking about changing the logic so the timer continues even if weight drops — and only stops when you press the button manually. Would this better match how you brew?
2. “Tare after dosing” to support drip-assist tools Right now, you can’t tare again after entering your coffee dose. That makes using tools like the Hario Drip-Assist a bit clunky. Would it be helpful to allow one more tare after dosing, so accessories can be added cleanly?

**We’d really appreciate your thoughts.**

We’d *really* appreciate your thoughts.

To say thanks, we’ll be selecting **5 users with the most upvoted or insightful comments** to receive a **free unit when the updated version launches**.*The reward can be shipped to the US and Canada only.* *Unfortunately, we’re not able to support global shipping at this time — but we still welcome your input wherever you are!*

If there’s something else you’d like to see improved, we’re always open to ideas and might explore them in a future post. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Thanks again for helping us make a better tool. The feedback from this sub has already made a big impact.

I pulled everything out of the bags when I got home and began to put everything away. I turned to grab the crackers and there was an identical box right behind it! I was floored! I KNOW I only bought one box. I remember grabbing ONE box off the shelf and loading ONE up on the checkout counter. I checked the receipt and it only lists one. So yesterday I opened the refrigerator and right behind the one almond milk we purchased was a whole new one! No one in my house bought another one. I was ready to just laugh this all off, but today when I was making my coffee, I reached into my coffee cabinet and grabbed the stevia, like I do every morning.

WELL. I have been seeing so many other products that are blatantly AI-generated being hocked. Things like kooky whiskey decanters (such as a duck flipping the bird, Godzilla, a weenie dog, and even the shark from Jaws), coffee mugs that appear to be made out of glass books, realistic stained glass lamps made to look like dogs, solid mineral rings, and even INSANELY intricately detailed garden statues that look like they come right out of a medieval fairy tale.

I’ve been drinking South Indian filter coffee until now, but I find it too strong for black coffee. I’m looking to upgrade my setup and make better black coffee at home.

Here’s what I’m planning:
	•	Grinder: C3S from Something’s Brewing
	•	Beans: Blue Tokai (open to suggestions on roast and type)

I’m stuck between getting a V60 or the KaldiPress Coffee Press Percolator (a budget Aeropress alternative). 

My priorities:
	•	I want a balanced cup that’s not too harsh
	•	I care about repeatable results (same taste every time)
	•	Mornings are rushed, so ease of use and cleanup is a plus
	•	I’m the only one drinking, so making a single cup at a time is fine
	•	I don’t have a scale yet — if you know a budget-friendly one, drop a suggestion!

Would love to hear:
	•	What would suit me better — V60 vs KaldiPress?
	•	Any grinder setting recommendations for either?
	•	Bonus: If you use either, would appreciate your recipe!

Thanks a ton in advance!
