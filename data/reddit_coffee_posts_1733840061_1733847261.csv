Before you read my story, here's a little bit about me. I'm a male in my 20's who is going through a barbaric GI episode and trying to find answers to my problems.

In the first week of September, I noticed a change in my bowel movements. I'd have this random feeling to go to the bathroom out of the blue without even eating anything. The frequent bowel movements usually started after my morning breakfast and no matter how many times I pass my stools, I'd feel incomplete like I'd still have to be back after a while. I also noticed small amounts of mucus every now and then but it didn't concern me much.

While this continued, one day I noticed a small amount of blood (could say less than 2 drops) in my stool. I did not have any other issues like constipation or pain. Went to a GI doctor for the same and was told not to worry about it as he said that it could have been due to anal fissures or hemorrhoids. Gave me some meds and did not see blood or mucus until I was consuming them. Once the meds were over, the frequent bowel movements and mucus-y stools started.

Again went to the doc and he ordered blood and stool tests. The blood tests came back with slightly elevated levels of Eosinophils and Amylase whereas the stool test indicated the presence of bacteria. Was put on a different round of meds again. This time my symptoms worsened and started experiencing foul smelling semi-solid stools pretty much every single time I had to poop. God I wish I could describe how awful the smell was. I still noticed mucus just like before. I really wanted to resist the feeling of having to poop because of the horrendous smell but I couldn't help it. I gotta say that at this point I forgot how normal poop would look/smell like because it was semi-solid with an awful smell every time.

  
The meds did not work for me this time as my problems still continued to persist. I told the doc that this isn't working out and he suggested to take stool culture test as my initial stool test showed the presence of bacteria and endoscopy. The stool culture test came back normal with the comment ""Normal flora growth and no enteric pathogens like Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., and Vibrio sp. were isolated"". The endoscopy came back with ""Mild Antral Gastritis. LAX LES / Hiatus Hernia"". The doc said that he was clueless as to why this is happening to me. He suggested to continue the meds but at this point I was so frustrated because the meds weren't working for me. 

  
I stopped the meds for a week and I again noticed blood covered in the mucus of my stool again. I panicked and I decided to get a second opinion from another GI doctor.

Went to this new GI doc in October. Explained everything to the new doc and I was asked to recall the list of all foods that I ate in the last couple of days. He asked me whether the frequent bowel movements/mucus in stool started after eating certain foods that contain gluten or diary because the foods I ate the previous day did contain a lot of gluten. As for diary, I'd drink coffee only when I feel like I want to. He suggested that I might be gluten/lactose intolerant and asked me to experiment with these two. He asked me to stop consuming gluten/diary to see if my bowel movements improved. As a matter of fact, it did improve for like a week. If I have to put a number, I'd say probably like a 40%. The smell of my poop didn't change much but the frequency of my bowel movements somewhat improved. 

He asked me to carry on this gluten/lactose free diet for 2 weeks but he said that I'd still have to get a colonoscopy in order to rule out the possibilities of polyps and hemorrhoids. Suggested to get my blood tested for deficiencies as the previous one didn't test for it. The tests came back with a moderate Vitamin D deficiency and I was given supplements for the same. At this point, the vitamin supplements were the only meds I was taking besides following a GF/LF diet.

  
After going through the horrible phase of prepping for colonoscopy, I finally got it done. Guess what. The tests came back squeaky clean with no polyps or hemorrhoids. But for 3 days after my colonoscopy,  I truly felt better as I passed normal smelling stools without mucus. The frequency of bowel movements drastically reduced from what it used to be and I was over the moon that things have finally settled. But I was wrong. Though I didn’t poop much often, I again noticed blood covered in mucus.

My doc was as confused and clueless as me. Suggested to take IgE and food allergy test. The IgE test came back with elevated levels (454 IU/mL) and the food allergy test came back normal citing that I had no allergies towards any food. My doctor is not aware of this test result yet as my appointment isn’t until next week.

I’m still following a GF/LF diet as of today since October so if I’m intolerant then I should feel much better when I don’t consume them. I really don’t know what’s going on with me and I’d appreciate if someone could offer some guidance. Thanks for giving this a read.",1,1733846737.0,GutHealth,0,1.0,False

30 F, from QLD.

I have been diagnosed with inattentive ADHD recently. I started on 10mg Ritalin but eventually went to 30mg. Felt nothing and only had bad side effects like anxiety, noticeable increased heart  rate, and headaches. Although for some reason it gave me serotonin boost an hour into taking it, which would die down within 2 hours or so.

Currently on Dex. I started with once a day, then started titration. Current prescription is for 2 twice a day (20mg total). Psychiatrist said I could potentially go up to 8 (40mg total) a day. No bad side effects. Increased heart rate, yes, but doesn't give me anxiety like Ritalin. I can still drink coffee with Dex, whereas I couldn't with Ritalin. I don't want to jump to 8 a day before my next appt in 2 months and don't want to overmedicate myself, esp given my size. I'm only 5ft, 45kg.

I feel dex doesn't work for me. I've tried taking it in an empty stomach and with food. They say it gives you energy boost, it doesn't for me. It also doesn't suppress my appetite, I still get super hungry around 10/11am as per my normal brunch time as I normally don't eat breakfast. Doesn't help me focus. I tried taking 3 in the morning to see if it'll help, and honestly I felt only the tiniest bit of reaction like it helped me focus for a little bit. Then took another 2 around lunch, which did nothing.

I took 30mg Vyvanse once, which also didn't do anything for me. I took it at 6am and went back to sleep, then woke up at 7:30am, although I felt refreshed from my sleep. Then took a nap at 4pm because I was so sleepy. Although I believe that Vyvanse is pretty much Dex only long lasting, but half the dosage. So 30mg of Vyvanse is only 15mg of Dex from my understanding.

I'm honestly thinking I may have been misdiagnosed, but my psychiatrist is very reputable and I fit the criteria (this is just me second guessing myself). I also have PTSD and history of depression, so I'm thinking chemical imbalance etc that may be potentially affecting how ADHD medication works for me. I'm not taking any other medications btw. I know it's too early to think that I've been misdiagnosed since it's been only a few months since my diagnosis, but I feel hopeless and stressed that it's not working for me. 

Just want to hear people's experience with ADHD meds trial and error, what happened? And if anyone's gone from stimulants to non-stimulants, how is non-stim working for you and how does it work?

I know some people's medications worked for them right away, but did anyone take time for their medication to work? And if so, how long did it take?",1,1733846678.0,ausadhd,0,0.99,False

1hb53xm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Artists/comments/1hb53xm/free_exhibition/,Free Exhibition!,"Hey everyone! I am doing a start up exhibition for us with seizure disorders. Take a look if you’re an artist, free entry 🙂

AURAS: Duckwalk’s First Book Exhibition

AURAS will be Duckwalk’s debut book exhibition—a collection designed to bring the power of art and storytelling by artists with seizure disorders to readers everywhere. Physical exhibitions aren’t always feasible for us, with time-limited runs, shipping costs, blah, blah, blah- plus, they just can’t reach everyone! AURAS aims to fix that by placing your work right onto the coffee tables of grateful readers worldwide.

This project is about raising awareness while celebrating creativity. Seizure disorders can consume us, whether on our best or worst days. Yet, despite the challenges, we create. The goal of AURAS is to inspire people living with seizure disorders—or those who support them—to embrace their identity as artists first and forget about the seizures for just a second. Because of what we go through, we deserve a space to create. 

No Theme, Just You
AURAS has no set theme. Your work doesn’t need to directly address or advocate for seizure disorders—we’ll handle that by sharing your story. We want to highlight you as an artist. Whether it’s a painting of sunflowers, a poem about a grocery store, or something entirely unexpected, your contribution helps advocate for seizure disorders by showing the diverse talent of those living with or supporting these experiences.

In AURAS, your art is the focus. Together, we’ll raise awareness through the beauty and power of creativity.

Formats of work we are looking for: 
- Printmaking
- Paintings
- Drawings / Illustrations 
- Photography 
- Poems
- Short essays
- Digital artwork (we cannot accept any motion work, and all digital work must abide by copyright laws if involving photographic manipulation)

With great photography, we may accept 3D work..
- Sculpture (of any medium) 
- Installation work

YOUR SUBMISSION COULD BE DENIED BY ERROR IN PHOTOGRAPHY! Remember, the work submitted is what will be entered into the exhibition, so make sure you capture it how you want it displayed! Some submissions may receive an email asking for better quality in documentation in order to properly jury the work.

AURAS: How to Apply!
Deadline: Running! Once we get our “ducks in a row,” we will put out a warning when submissions will be coming to a close.

Each applicant can submit 5 pieces! 
For artworks, .jpeg format. 
For written word, .png format. 

If your work is chosen, all of the above information will be included with your work. Say what’s comfortable for you, but remember to get your name out there as an artist!

Did I do it right?
You will receive a confirmation email that we received your submission (1-3 business days). If you did not complete all that is required for the application, you will not receive a confirmation email. You can reapply until you receive confirmation- DO IT IN SEPARATE EMAIL! 

Who is Duckwalk? 
Duckwalk is an undergraduate printmaker and digital artist based in Southwest Michigan. Duckwalk is an aspiring curator, showcasing two consecutive exhibitions at their university. Duckwalk is the man with the plan regarding AURAS, taking responsibility to edit, curate, jury, and export the exhibition. 

Currently, we are setting up a blog to gain more exposure to hold AURAS and other exhibitions like it. Right now, we are advertising on every forum and kicking it old-ish school, seeing how far word of mouth can take us. AURAS is one of many exhibitions in planning held by Duckwalk. Due to personal health complications, we are taking everyday one step at a time. But as of right now, our biggest focus is recovery and creation! 

Donations
If you are interested in supporting AURAS and Duckwalk through this time, email artists.with.auras@gmail.com with subject line AURAS Donations. All donations will contribute to the exhibition and start up blog that will continue to support those with seizure disorders. Any leftover change will be sent to the Epilepsy Foundation.

You can eat it both raw and or cooked. 
You can also mix it with vanilla ice cream that's dairy free. 

Alden's organic gluten-free dairy-free frozen dessert Sammy's. 
They don't taste exactly like your ice cream sandwiches you remember, but theyre still really good!

So delicious ice cream selections. 
My favorite is the cashew milk option. 

If you like Publix, Publix offers a dairy-free gluten-free strawberry ice cream that is amazing.  
It does have almonds in it because it's made out of almond milk.

Katz gf Strawberry pop tarts.
Good enough for the cravings.

Katz GF apple pie 😍

For pizza crusts:
Wholly wholesome New York thin crust
Sauce: classico pizza sauce 
Cheese: dairy free vevan cheese is the best so far
Pepperoni: Applegate

Corn dogs: Applegate gf corn dogs

Feel good foods: 
*Soup pork dumplings 🤤 ( tastes better when microwaved in a bowl than in the plastic)

*Chicken regular dumplings 
*Eggrolls (microwave for 2-3 min and then airfry for 4-5 min on 400F makes me crispy and cooked)
*Their Mozzarella sticks if you don't have a dairy allergy 




Mozzarella sticks: dairy free and gluten Wholly veggie mozzarella sticks. 

Regular loaf bread:

Greenlite GF bread, the best bread ever. I creid eating it because I felt normal again since it tastes just like bread!! And it's not small!!  
Blows udis or cannon out of the water. 

Daiya supreme pizza ( it's just enough to get the craving out. I don't put aluminum foil at the bottom of the pizza, comes out too soft. I just throw it on the oven rack and it's crispy.)

Muffins: Krusteaz blueberry muffins. If you want to make cinnamon swearl muffins just mix the cinnamon swearl coffee cake box with the blue berry muffin base ( without the blueberrys) you get like 24 muffins from both combined. 

Breakfast sandwich:
 Walmart has a GF flour called (divided sunset all purpose GF flour)


Mix this with water and 1 egg ( just make the mix thick enough for a pancake mix; not watery but a nice creamy thickness) 


Plop it in a waffle maker. 


Jimmy Dean sausage or turkey patties in the microwave first and add with cheese on top after patties are warm ( df or regular cheese) 


Microwave 1 scrambled egg in a bowl for 1 30sec-1min.


Combine all waffles, egg, cheese and meat patties together to make a sandwich. 
Drizzle some maple syrup on top ( not too much) 


BAM! BREAKFAST SANDWICH IN 5 MIN

GF AND DAIRY FREE 


Pastas: 
Jovii pastas are the best IMO
Don't over cook them, drain em when they're chewy but a medium soft chewy. 
Only takes about 5-6 min to cook. 
Rinse with cold water. 
Put in fridge if not using for 5-10 min because they will stick together and it's so hard to break em apart. 


Alfredo sauce:
Creamy oat milk: non flavored, GF flour, garlic salt, pepper, oregano, df butter miyokos ( need to be round tub not the cardboard box; tastes different)  and a whisk. 



Whisk the ingredients together before putting on heat. The flour thickens the sauce. If you put this on heat before mixing thoroughly together, you will have very clumpy flour sauce. 


Mix all the ingredients thoroughly  cold and then put it on a medium- med high  heat. Or throw in a blender haha if youre lazy to mix it really well. 


MAKE SURE YOU WISK EVERY 30SEC- 1 MIN for all your flour will burn at the bottom of the pot.

I decided to live “as usual” yesterday evening just to see the results.  I didn’t have a healthy dinner (4 fried chicken strips w/ honey mustard, fried okra, 16oz lemonade).  My base sugar level has been hovering around 110.   After eating my meal, I went from 128 to 171 in 30 minutes, hit a 2nd peak, then returned to 103.  I’m also having break thru peaks at night, correlated to the time I’m waking from a dead sleep.   

Any words of wisdom or thoughts?   Today, I’ve been very mindful of what I’ve had.  A kachava shake with almond milk for breakfast, black coffee, a very small package of goldfish crackers.  Even after the kachava, I went from 105 @ 7:08am to 154 @ 7:58am.   To me, I’m all over the road.

That’s who they tell you are heroes. That’s who our revolutionaries are.
Yet is that not capitalistic? Non-violence keeps the system working at full speed ahead.
What did it get us. Look in the mirror.
They want us to be non-violent, so that they can grow fat off the blood they take from us.
The only way out is through. Not all of us will make it. Each of us is our own chief executive. You have to decide what you will tolerate.

They diagnosed my mother with severe neuropathy when she was forty-one years old. She said it started ten years before that with burning sensations in her feet and occasional sharp stabbing pains. At first the pain would last a few moments, then fade to tingling, then numbness, then fade to nothing a few days later.
The first time the pain came she ignored it. Then it came a couple times a year and she ignored it. Then every couple months. Then a couple times a month. Then a couple times a week. At that point by the time the tingling faded to numbness, the pain would start, and the discomfort was constant. At that point even going from the couch to the kitchen to make her own lunch became a major endeavor
She started with ibuprofen, until the stomach aches and acid reflux made her switch to acetaminophen. Then the headaches and barely sleeping made her switch back to ibuprofen.
The first doctor said it was psychosomatic. Nothing was wrong. She needed to relax, destress, sleep more.
The second doctor said it was a compressed nerve in her spine. She needed back surgery. It would cost $180,000. Recovery would be six months minimum before walking again. Twelve months for full potential recovery, and she would never lift more than ten pounds of weight again.
The third doctor performed a Nerve Conduction Study, Electromyography, MRI, and blood tests. Each test cost $800 to $1200. She hit the $6000 deductible of her UnitedHealthcare plan in October. Then the doctor went on vacation, and my mother wasn’t able to resume tests until January when her deductible reset.
The tests showed severe neuropathy. The $180,000 surgery would have had no effect.
They prescribed opioids for the pain. At first the pain relief was worth the price of constant mental fog and constipation. She didn’t tell me about that until later. All I remember is we took a trip for the first time in years, when she drove me to Monterey to go to the aquarium. I saw an otter in real life, swimming on its back. We left at 7am and listened to Green Day on the four-hour car ride. Over time, the opioids stopped working. They made her MORE sensitive to pain, and she felt withdrawal symptoms after just two or three hours.
Then gabapentin. By now the pain was so bad she couldn’t exercise, which compounded the weight gain from the slowed metabolic rate and hormonal shifts. And it barely helped the pain, and made her so fatigued she would go an entire day without getting out of bed.
Then Corticosteroids. Which didn’t even work.
The pain was so bad I would hear my mother wake up in the night screaming in pain. I would run into her room, asking if she’s OK. Eventually I stopped getting up. She’d yell out anguished shrieks of wordless pain or the word “fuck” stretched and distended to its limits. I’d turn over and go back to sleep.
All of this while they bled us dry with follow-up appointment after follow-up appointment, specialist consultations, and more imagine scans. Each appointment was promised to be fully covered, until the insurance claims were delayed and denied. Allopathic medicine did nothing to help my mother’s suffering. Yet it is the foundation of our entire society.
My mother told me that on a good day the nerve pain was like her legs were immersed in ice water. On a bad day it felt like her legs were clamped in a machine shop vice, screwed down to where the cranks stopped turning, then crushed further until her ankle bones sprintered and cracked to accommodate the tightening clamp. She had more bad days than good.
My mother crawled to the bathroom on her hands and knees. I slept in the living room to create more distance from her cries in the night. I still woke up, and still went back to sleep.
Back then I thought there was nothing I could do.
The high copays made consistent treatment impossible. New treatments were denied as “not medically necessary.” Old treatments didn’t work, and still put us out for thousands of dollars.
UnitedHealthcare limited specialist consultations to twice a year.
Then they refused to cover advanced imaging, which the specialists required for an appointment.
Prior authorizations took weeks, then months.
UnitedHealthcare constantly changed their claim filing procedure. They said my mother’s doctor needed to fax his notes. Then UnitedHealthcare said they did not save faxed patient correspondence, and required a hardcopy of the doctor’s typed notes to be mailed. Then they said they never received the notes. They were unable to approve the claim until they had received and filed the notes.
They promised coverage, and broke their word to my mother.
With every delay, my anger surged. With every denial, I wanted to throw the doctor through the glass wall of their hospital waiting room.
But it wasn’t them. It wasn’t the doctors, the receptionists, administrators, pharmacists, imaging technicians, or anyone we ever met. It was UnitedHealthcare.
People are dying. Evil has become institutionalized. Corporations make billions of dollars off the pain, suffering, death, and anguished cries in the night of millions of Americans.
We entered into an agreement for healthcare with a legally binding contract that promised care commensurate with our insurance payments and medical needs. Then UnitedHealthcare changes the rules to suit their own profits. They think they make the rules, and think that because it’s legal that no one can punish them.
They think there’s no one out there who will stop them.
Now my own chronic back pain wakes me in the night, screaming in pain. I sought out another type of healing that showed me the real antidote to what ails us.
I bide my time, saving the last of my strength to strike my final blows. All extractors must be forced to swallow the bitter pain they deal out to millions.
As our own chief executives, it’s our obligation to make our own lives better. First and foremost, we must seek to improve our own circumstances and defend ourselves. As we do so, our actions have ripple effects that can improve the lives of others.
Rules exist between two individuals, in a network that covers the entire earth. Some of these rules are written down. Some of these rules emerge from natural respect between two individuals. Some of these rules are defined in physical laws, like the properties of gravity, magnetism or the potential energy stored in the chemical bonds of potassium nitrate.
No single document better encapsulates the belief that all people are equal in fundamental worth and moral status and the frameworks for fostering collective well-being than the US constitution.
Writing a rule down makes it into a law. I don’t give a fuck about the law. Law means nothing. What does matter is following the guidance of our own logic and what we learn from those before us to maximize our own well-being, which will then maximize the well-being of our loved ones and community.
That’s where UnitedHealthcare went wrong. They violated their contract with my mother, with me, and tens of millions of other Americans. This threat to my own health, my family’s health, and the health of our country’s people requires me to respond with an act of war.

1hb4wah,https://www.reddit.com/r/CraftBeer/comments/1hb4wah/looking_for_help_picking_out_beers_from_tree/," Looking for help picking out beers from Tree House, Mast Landing, and Bissell Brothers ","A friend of mine has graciously offered to pickup beer for me from 3 breweries that he'll be stopping at in the next couple of days.  As mentioned, the breweries are[ Tree House](https://treehousebrew.com/),[ Mast Landing](https://www.mastlandingbrewing.com/), and[ Bissell Brothers](https://bissellbrothers.com/).  I'm nowhere near these places, and have limited experience with the three, so I don't have an opportunity to sample, and I don't want to put beer selection on my buddy's shoulders.  I'm hoping this sub can help!

My preferred beer styles, in order are:

1. Hazy double or triple IPAs -- I prefer ones with lots of body, citrus, and on the sweeter side.  One perfect example is [Pantless Thunder Goose ](https://www.mastlandingbrewing.com/pantless-thunder-goose)(by Mass Landing as it so happens)
2. Stouts -- Looking for lots of body, and rich flavor.  Unfortunately, I find most stouts miss.  They’re some combination of too thin and lacking in flavor (Guinness), or they’re WAY over-flavored, and really more of a dessert stout w/ tons of sweetness, or they could pass as a weird coffee.  Barrel aged stuff often gets overbearing with the barrel (or booze) flavor, which I say being a bourbon enthusiast.  Example: Founders used to have a few knockout stouts, but it has been a minute since I’ve had them.  I have had The Gunner's Daughter from Mast Landing, and can get that locally, so I'm skipping that one.
3. Porters - Same general notes as the Stouts, really.
4. Milkshake Sours - I don’t really know if this is just a Mortalis thing or if anyone else makes them.  I don’t like ‘normal’ sours, but I really enjoy some of these from Mortalis.  They’re pretty much exactly what they sound like - a boozy sour (really more sweet than sour) fruit milkshake.

If anyone has specific recommendations for these three breweries based on the above info, please let me know!  I'm in the process of researching each, so as I find beer names (essentially me combing reddit looking for crumbs of info) I'll post them in the comments asking about them.",0,1733846091.0,CraftBeer,8,0.25,False
1hb4vwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hb4vwe/upper_right_quadrant_pain/,Upper right quadrant pain? ,"27 Female, 

To start off, about two months ago I was getting strange pain in this area of my stomach and back. At first I thought it was constipation, but then it would sometimes feel like a sore back muscle in the same area? I went to the Dr, she felt around and felt no inflammation, ordered standard bloodwork which all came back normal. Over the next two weeks the pain went away. 

Now, last night I was woken up with the worst stomach ache I’ve ever had in this same area that could somewhat be felt in my back but mostly stomach. It felt like intense terrible gas, but if I passed gas it did not get better. I started to feel nausea but did not vomit. I got up and walked around my house for a bit, the pain last about two hours before subsiding and I fell asleep. Now this morning I feel perfectly fine. The only change I can think of is I have not been as active or drinking water like I should be. I do drink a lot of coffee. Could this have been a pancreas flair up? Thanks!

Since the onset, I've been drinking a lot of fluids but definitely eating less than I normally would. And when I do eat, it's typically more fiber rich foods like apples. For example, all I had for breakfast the other day was an apple and some coffee. Additionally, it's exam season for me so I've skipped a few meals altogether.

For the past couple years I've weighed in the 190-200 range pretty consistently, with my most recent measurement before the constipation giving me around 195. However, I stopped by my doctor's office yesterday, and when I weighed myself, I was 185. I've also been having some slight abdominal/pelvic pain which I'm assuming is from the constipation. 

I'm not surprised that my changes in eating habits have caused me to lose some weight. But 10 pounds is definitely much more than I was expecting. I get paranoid easily so I was pretty alarmed. Should I be concerned or is this normal?",1,1733845996.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,1.0,False

Luca used to date this girl named Emily. Now, Emily (F16) had bpd. She was super controlling and very paranoid (as most bpd girls are), and she was all around just... A problem for him. I, on the other hand, had been really good friends with her for a little while before the two of them met, and I was originally the one who brought them together. She was definitely a lot worse to Luca than she was to me. Probably something about being in a relationship triggered it. (She's said that before). So,  her and Luca had an awful breakup. Like, she never wants to see him again. I'm not sure about him, he might want to get back together with her, but I'm not sure. So me and Luca, we've never fought before. We have lil mini disagreements, but we've never gotten into a full blown fight. 
Until now.
So, I smoke. Not a lot, and it's never cigarettes, only vapes and weed. I totally get it's a bad thing, and I shouldnt be doing it at 15, which is all true. I don't really know why I do. I'm definitely not addicted, I just do it when my cousin comes over and brings his. Or maybe I'll like take a hit of my friends at school or something, but I do NOT always want it or whatever. Lucas always hated it.  (Yes, that is relevant to the story) So, yesterday morning, I was having a conversation with Emily (I can't remember what about), and we make a plan to walk to school together. So we meet up at this cute lil cafe not that far from the school, grab coffees, and go. 
We start walking, and sees us, and apparently gets really mad. 
He texts me during science class, and says ""have fun with Emily, don't ever talk to me again."" 
""What?? Breh tf do you think was happening?""
""I don't know, nor do I care. This is your third and final warning."" 
(Rlly pulling out the parental persona)
""What warnings bruh you ain't my dad""
""The first was when you smoked the first time, the next was when you smoked the second time, then now Emily. My trust has been broken, Fox.""

""I don't care. I do NOT want you talking to her at all.""
""Why?""
""Right now, I could choke the life out of you and not feel a thing.""

1hb4qd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1hb4qd7/have_you_ever_wondered_why_you_sometimes_test_as/,Have you ever wondered why you sometimes test as a different MBTI type? Have you discerned what causes this seeming glitch?,"Picture this: an INFJ, minding their own business, untangling the threads of the universe like some low-key philosopher in their Ni-Fe cloud, when—**WHAM!**—life hurls a metaphorical wrench at their head. 

Enter stage left: a boss, a job, or that one co-worker who insists on ""brainstorming"" at 4 p.m. on a Friday. 

Suddenly, the INFJ is yanked out of their introspective bliss and thrown into an impromptu performance art piece called *How to Pretend I’m Not Slowly Dying Inside*.  

It’s like being a chameleon—only instead of blending in, you’re shoved into a disco ball, spinning through a kaleidoscope of personas because, apparently, adapting to chaos is your *thing*. 

Need a mediator? Sure. A strategist? Why not. Someone to pick up the emotional mess no one else wants to touch? Oh, absolutely. Who better than you, the human Swiss Army knife of emotional labor and existential dread?  

And let’s be frank, this shape-shifting survival act is why INFJs are so hard to pin down. At any given moment, we’re either solving someone else’s crisis, dodging small talk, or quietly spiraling into an existential black hole while maintaining an outward aura of calm competence.  

Which brings us to now: 4:25 a.m., sitting in the dark like a villain plotting their redemption arc, reflecting on the past week’s whirlwind of chaos. 

And it hits you—an epiphany so sharp it feels personal. 

There’s a reason we sometimes test as entirely different MBTI types: *we’ve been reprogramming ourselves for survival for years.*

Think back—at some point, someone praised you for being “so adaptable.” 

And like the overachieving people-pleaser you are, you leaned in. 

Needed an ENTJ for that project? Done. An ESFP for the party no one wanted to plan? Sure, why not. Congratulations! Your cognitive stack now moonlights as a personality circus, starring minor players in lead roles because apparently, being the “mystical counselor” wasn’t stressful enough.  

And so, here we are. Master shapeshifters. Emotional contortionists. The patron saints of quietly losing our minds while making it look effortless. It’s not pretty, but hey, survival never is.

In various (job assignment and family events and friend-group) situations I have had to adapt to survive by suddenly sending my usual cognitive order of operations into an alternate arrangement. Minor players become main characters. 

When an INFJ is under extreme stress, it’s as if their inner world—the one they’ve so carefully curated with intuitive foresight and emotional depth—gets flipped upside down and shaken like a snow globe. Except instead of glitter, it’s pure chaos raining down. This is the infamous “grip” state, where their normally harmonious cognitive stack does a complete 180, and they’re thrust into the uncharted waters of their shadow functions.  

Suddenly, that calm, insightful INFJ, with their Ni-Fe magic, is gone. In their place? A panicked, hyperactive version of themselves, driven by Se (Extroverted Sensing), the function they usually keep buried in the basement. Instead of pondering life’s mysteries and connecting dots only they can see, they’re laser-focused on *everything* happening *right now.* It’s sensory overload on steroids. They might become obsessed with details, binge on junk food, shop compulsively, or impulsively do something wildly out of character, like chopping off their hair at 3 a.m.  

And the Fe, which usually fuels their deep empathy and emotional insight, gets hijacked by its darker twin. They may lash out, overreact, or crumble into a self-pitying spiral, convinced the world is out to get them. The INFJ who usually finds meaning in everything is now drowning in every meaningless thing—loud noises, bad lighting, random annoyances—until their Te (Extroverted Thinking) shadow barges in like a drill sergeant with a clipboard. Suddenly, they’re barking orders, rigidly organizing, or coldly dismissing emotions as if they’re channeling an efficiency robot.  

The result? 

A surreal spectacle of contradictions: a hyper-aware, overstimulated INFJ trying to control everything around them while secretly falling apart inside. It’s like watching a philosopher try to fix a broken toaster by sheer willpower while yelling at it for being defective.  

To outsiders, this ""shadow INFJ"" may seem unrecognizable, even alarming. 

But for the INFJ, it feels like being trapped in someone else’s body—one that’s fueled by panic, reacting instead of reflecting, and spiraling into survival mode. It’s messy, uncomfortable, and deeply unsettling—a sharp departure from their usual state of quiet mastery.  

Eventually, though, the storm passes. They claw their way back to their Ni-Fe center, wiser for the chaos but exhausted by the detour. Until then, stay out of their way—and maybe hide the scissors.

**And it has me thinking…**

1. What situations have sent you into an alternate persona, just to survive?

2. How did you handle it?

3. How did it feel?

4. How did you reset?

**I came up with some hypothetical scenarios… I’m wondering if you’d like to add to any of these:**


## **1. INFJ in INTJ Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Strategic War-Games Coordinator for Intergalactic Corporate Takeovers*.  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
The type who’d provoke this shift is an ENTJ boss who treats deadlines like commandments from the cosmos. They strut into the office with a “No fluff, only results” mantra, tossing phrases like “Synergy,” “ROI,” and “failure is NOT an option.”  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The once warm and soulful INFJ starts walking around with a clipboard and laser eyes, muttering about efficiency metrics and contingency plans. Their soft edges? Gone. They’re calling out inefficiencies, laying out 5-year strategies, and steamrolling anything that feels like “feelings.” Their aura shifts from “kind guru” to “robotic overlord.”  


**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
The INFJ’s natural empathy gets buried beneath a fortress of Te (Extraverted Thinking). They start thinking in terms of systems, hierarchies, and strategic wins, but it doesn’t feel right. Ni still whispers “there’s more to this,” but Fe is suppressed, leaving them emotionally detached and unable to connect. Over time, this logical efficiency becomes suffocating—like being trapped in a glass box of cold, calculated analysis.  

**External Signs:**  
Their usually warm presence becomes distant and robotic. Others notice their sudden lack of interest in human dynamics, and they seem overly fixated on plans and outcomes, with no patience for emotions.  

**Antidote:**  
Reconnecting with human warmth is key. Take a break to engage in deeply empathetic activities: volunteer work, intimate conversations with loved ones, or simply journaling about their feelings. Physical grounding—like a walk in nature or a candlelit bath—helps thaw the icy detachment.  



## **2. INFJ in INFP Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Experimental Poet Laureate for the Bureau of Whimsical Daydreams.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
An ISFP co-worker who casually tosses around deep questions like, “But how does this make your soul *feel*?” during coffee breaks.  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ suddenly swaps their planner for a sketchpad. They start quoting Rumi and talking about the “essence of authenticity.” Instead of orchestrating deep, collective transformations, they’re wandering the office barefoot, humming folk songs, and chasing their own emotions like butterflies in a meadow.  


**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
Operating in Fi (Introverted Feeling) over Fe feels like walking on emotional quicksand. They’re forced to turn inward, constantly analyzing their personal values and emotions, but without the INFJ’s natural inclination for collective harmony. Over time, they feel untethered—adrift in their own emotional whirlpool, struggling to find purpose without a sense of communal connection.  

**External Signs:**  
They appear dreamy but unproductive, perpetually “in their feelings” without offering the usual transformative insights they’re known for. Their usual ability to inspire others dims as they focus inward.  

**Antidote:**  
The INFJ needs to reengage with their Fe by organizing a small group gathering or helping someone solve a problem. Journaling about how they impact the greater good can also help them feel anchored. Sensory grounding through music or art can stabilize their emotional flux.  






## **3. INFJ in ENFJ Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Chief Charisma Officer for the Society of Global Inspiration Leaders*.  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
An ESFJ team lead who throws them into the limelight, shouting, “The people need you, STARSHINE!” They encourage them to become the face of every team initiative.  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ goes from brooding quietly in their corner to working the room like a motivational rock star. They’re smiling, patting backs, leading standing ovations, and signing people up for life-changing workshops. Colleagues start whispering, “When did *they* get so... magnetic?”  



**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
At first, the shift to high-energy charisma might feel exhilarating, but soon, the constant outward focus leaves the INFJ drained and brittle. They’re operating on Fe (Extraverted Feeling) overdrive, neglecting Ni’s need for introspection. Without quiet time to process, their vision becomes shallow, their insights forced, and their empathy a performative act.  

**External Signs:**  
They seem like a social butterfly at first, but over time, cracks show: they become overly dramatic, reactive, and surface-level. People might say, “They’re not as deep as I thought.”  

**Antidote:**  
Solitude is the cure. A long, meditative retreat, a solo writing session, or even a weekend in bed with a book can restore their balance. Reconnecting with their Ni—through journaling or analyzing a personal dream—helps them regain depth.  






## **4. INFJ in ENTJ Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Crisis Commander for the Department of Ruthless Solutions.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
A “fire-in-the-belly” ESTP colleague who throws the INFJ into chaos by declaring, “No time for philosophy—just FIX IT.”  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ suddenly becomes an efficiency dictator, barking orders and moving at warp speed. Their empathetic demeanor is replaced with a fiery “get-it-done-or-get-out” attitude. People are both terrified and impressed, whispering things like, “I didn’t know they had *that* in them.”  



**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
Trying to dominate with Te (Extraverted Thinking) while suppressing Ni and Fe is like forcing a poet to write legal briefs—it drains their soul. They start making decisions without their usual foresight or compassion, which leaves them feeling hollow. Over time, they feel like a tyrant in their own mind, with no time to breathe or dream.  

**External Signs:**  
They appear cold, bossy, and overly aggressive, barking orders and shutting down dissent. People who once admired their empathy now fear their rigidity.  

**Antidote:**  
They need to pause the grind and reconnect with Ni’s visionary flow. A quiet brainstorming session or revisiting a creative passion project can help them step back into their natural rhythm. Seeking out deep conversations with trusted friends revives their Fe.  





## **5. INFJ in ISTJ Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Archivist for the Guild of Impeccable Bureaucratic Order*.  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
A micromanaging ISTJ supervisor who insists on color-coded spreadsheets and “the way it’s always been done.”  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ’s mystical vision gets laser-focused on mundane details. They’re suddenly quoting regulations, obsessed with timestamps, and holding others accountable for not following protocol. It’s as if their inner monk was swapped with a bureaucrat who lives for filing systems.  

**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
The INFJ becomes a slave to Si (Introverted Sensing), focusing obsessively on details and routines. This crushes their big-picture thinking and makes them feel stifled, as if they’re trapped in a dusty library of rules. Over time, their creativity withers, leaving them apathetic and exhausted.  

**External Signs:**  
They seem overly rigid, nitpicky, and dull. People may comment that they’ve lost their spark, becoming oddly obsessed with trivialities.  

**Antidote:**  
The INFJ must break free of routines and do something spontaneous—like a road trip or an art class. Reengaging with abstract ideas, like reading philosophy or exploring symbolism in art, helps reignite their Ni.  



## **6. INFJ in ISFJ Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Traditional Ceremonies Officer for the Ancient Order of Family Values.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
A nurturing ESFJ boss who piles them with communal responsibilities and makes emotional guilt an art form.  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ morphs into the office caregiver, baking cookies and organizing baby showers. They’re no longer vision-casting but reminiscing about “the good old days.” People start asking, “Why are they *so* nostalgic all of a sudden?”  


**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
While Fe feels natural to the INFJ, over-relying on Si dulls their vision and traps them in nostalgia. They start clinging to tradition or past patterns instead of imagining new possibilities. Over time, they feel stagnant, like a caretaker stuck in a time loop.  

**External Signs:**  
They appear overly sentimental, deferential, and stuck in the past. Their once-profound insights are replaced with shallow platitudes.  

**Antidote:**  
A creative reset is necessary. Experimenting with futuristic ideas or engaging in visionary planning can help them escape the Si rut. Physical experiences like visiting a new city or redecorating their space can refresh their perspective.  




## **7. INFJ in ESTJ Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Field Marshal of the Department of Getting Things Done Yesterday.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
A no-nonsense ENTJ manager who expects every decision to be backed by “actionable results.”  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ, once the poetic dreamer, is now pacing the office with a Bluetooth headset, yelling about KPIs and budgets. They ditch their vision boards for flowcharts and start saying things like, “This isn’t personal—it’s business.”  


**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
Operating in Te overdrive while ignoring Ni and Fe feels like being a drill sergeant in a symphony—they lose all sense of nuance. They become rigid and authoritarian, bulldozing emotions and ideas in pursuit of tangible results. Over time, they feel like a hollow shell of their empathetic self.  

**External Signs:**  
They’re abrupt, impatient, and overly critical. Their usual grace is replaced with sharp edges, leaving others wary and disconnected.  

**Antidote:**  
The INFJ must step back from leadership roles and reengage with creative, soulful pursuits. A trip to a museum, a meditation session, or diving into a fantasy novel can rekindle their Ni-Fe balance.  



## **8. INFJ in ESFJ Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Master of Ceremonies for the Festival of Perpetual Togetherness.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
A bubbly ENFP co-worker who pulls them into every happy hour, team-building exercise, and group chat.  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ, once so private, is now organizing potlucks and posting inspirational quotes in the office Slack. They’ve become *that person* who knows everyone’s birthday and signs emails with “Warmest regards.”  


**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
While Fe comes naturally to the INFJ, putting Si (Introverted Sensing) in the driver’s seat forces them to fixate on traditions, social expectations, and maintaining the status quo. This crushes their Ni’s visionary power and leaves them emotionally fatigued from constantly managing others’ needs. Over time, they feel like a shallow performer, unable to dream or think beyond immediate relational dynamics.  

**External Signs:**  
They become overly focused on appearances and social niceties, seeming superficial or overly concerned with trivial matters. Their typical depth feels strangely absent.  

**Antidote:**  
To recover, the INFJ needs solitude to reconnect with their Ni. Engaging in future-focused journaling or planning sessions, as well as stepping out of social obligations, restores their sense of self. Symbolic activities like meditating with candles or creating a vision board can help them regain their focus.  




## **9. INFJ in INTP Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Philosophical Systems Analyst for the Institute of Endless Theories.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
A brilliant but detached INTP mentor who challenges every thought with, “Yes, but *why?*”  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ starts zoning out, furrowing their brow, and spewing out abstract theories that leave everyone’s heads spinning. They stop asking, “How does this impact the team?” and start asking, “But does this concept *hold water* logically?”  


**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
Forced to rely on Ti (Introverted Thinking) and Se (Extraverted Sensing), the INFJ begins to operate like a hyper-logical problem-solver, detached from their intuitive and emotional core. At first, they enjoy the practicality, but over time, they feel hollow, like a robot on autopilot. Their inner world of meaning and connection starts to fade.  

**External Signs:**  
They appear pragmatic but emotionally cold, overly focused on solving technical problems. People notice their warmth has disappeared, replaced by a mechanical demeanor.  

**Antidote:**  
The INFJ must reignite their Ni and Fe by engaging in storytelling or deep conversations. Artistic hobbies—like writing poetry, painting, or analyzing symbols—can help reawaken their sense of meaning.  



## **10. INFJ in ENTP Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Idea Wrangler for the Think Tank of Limitless Chaos.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
An ENFP boss who keeps shouting, “There are no bad ideas!” while juggling five projects.  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ suddenly has boundless energy, throwing out crazy ideas at rapid speed. Their colleagues are both excited and disoriented, wondering, “What caffeinated whirlwind possessed them?”  


**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
Overusing Fi (Introverted Feeling) and Se (Extraverted Sensing) feels unmoored for the INFJ, who is naturally wired to process meaning through Ni and Fe. They become overly focused on personal experiences and sensory pleasures, losing touch with their visionary ideals. Over time, this creates a sense of existential dread—life feels fleeting and without direction.  

**External Signs:**  
They seem overly indulgent or obsessed with aesthetics, appearing self-absorbed or disconnected from deeper concerns. Others might say, “They’re not as profound as I thought.”  

**Antidote:**  
The INFJ must reengage with their purpose by exploring symbolic or spiritual frameworks. Activities like reading philosophy, stargazing, or reconnecting with a mentor can help them rediscover their Ni-led sense of direction.  




## **11. INFJ in ISTP Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Emergency Mechanic for the Apocalypse Response Unit.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
An ESTP teammate who shoves tools into their hands and says, “No time to think—just fix it!”  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ’s ethereal calm vanishes, replaced by hands-on practicality. They’re suddenly solving tangible problems with zero fuss, leaving colleagues to marvel, “Who knew they could *do* that?”  

**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
Operating in Se (Extraverted Sensing) and Ti (Introverted Thinking) is exhilarating at first—like driving a race car on adrenaline. But as they suppress Ni and Fe, the INFJ feels untethered, reactive, and eventually burned out. Over time, they lose their connection to long-term vision and relationships, spiraling into impulsivity and shallow distractions.  

**External Signs:**  
They appear reckless, thrill-seeking, and overly focused on short-term gains. Others might comment that they’ve become unpredictable or emotionally distant.  

**Antidote:**  
Reconnecting with their Ni requires stillness. Meditation, yoga, or even a solo retreat can help them reset. Reflecting on past insights or journaling about long-term goals reestablishes their sense of purpose.  




## **12. INFJ in ISFP Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Artisan-in-Residence for the Temple of Sensory Bliss.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
An ESFP co-worker who drags them to improv night and says, “Feel it in your *body*.”  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ starts talking about textures, colors, and the “vibe” of everything. Their coworkers are stunned to see them finger-painting during brainstorming sessions.  

**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
Living in Se (Extraverted Sensing) and Fi (Introverted Feeling) forces the INFJ to focus entirely on the present moment and personal desires, which feels unnatural and ultimately exhausting. They start to crave meaning and connection but are stuck in a cycle of sensory overload. Over time, they feel shallow, disconnected, and emotionally raw.  

**External Signs:**  
They appear fun-loving but scattered, overly focused on entertainment and material pleasures. Their usual insightful demeanor seems absent, replaced by a performative vibe.  

**Antidote:**  
The INFJ needs to step away from sensory distractions and reconnect with their inner world. A long hike, deep conversation, or working on a symbolic art project can help them reengage with their Ni-Fe framework.  













## **13. INFJ in ESTP Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Action Hero Consultant for Extreme Crisis Management.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
A thrill-seeking ESTP boss who tosses them into chaos with a shrug and a grin.  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ trades their deep introspection for adrenaline. They’re suddenly sprinting into action and making snap decisions, leaving their team muttering, “What just happened to their whole *vibe*?”  

**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
While Ne (Extraverted Intuition) might seem similar to Ni, the INFJ feels scattered and overstimulated by endless possibilities. Forced into Ti logic, they start overanalyzing ideas, leaving no room for their usual depth or emotional resonance. Over time, this creates a sense of chaos and disconnection from their intuitive anchor.  

**External Signs:**  
They seem playful but unfocused, constantly bouncing between ideas without committing to anything. Others might see them as “all talk, no action.”  

**Antidote:**  
The INFJ needs to simplify their mental space. Focusing on one meaningful project or practicing mindfulness brings clarity. Writing down their long-term visions and reflecting on their emotional connections to these goals restores balance.  



## **14. INFJ in ESFP Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Director of Flashy Fun for the Society of Spontaneous Joy.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
An ENFP who declares, “Let’s make every day a party!”  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ’s calm demeanor transforms into an explosion of energy. They’re laughing loudly, dancing in hallways, and convincing everyone to “live in the moment.”  

**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
Living in Ne (Extraverted Intuition) and Fi (Introverted Feeling) overwhelms the INFJ with too many possibilities and self-reflection. They feel like they’re chasing a million dreams but achieving none. Over time, they become scattered and emotionally exhausted, longing for the focus and harmony Ni and Fe provide.  

**External Signs:**  
They appear whimsical but flaky, jumping from idea to idea without follow-through. Their usual grounded presence seems replaced by flightiness.  

**Antidote:**  
The INFJ must prioritize by listing their core values and long-term goals. Grounding themselves through physical activity or quiet meditation helps reset their focus. Symbolic practices, like tarot reading or vision journaling, also reconnect them with Ni.  






## **15. INFJ in ENTJ Clothing**
**Job Title:**  
*Overlord of Strategic World Domination Initiatives.*  

**Supervisor/Co-worker:**  
An ENTJ boss who says, “Don’t bring me problems, bring me solutions.”  

**How Others Notice the Shift:**  
The INFJ suddenly takes charge, barking orders and exuding raw power. Their once quiet intensity becomes the stuff of legend, leaving colleagues muttering, “I didn’t know they had a *take-no-prisoners* mode!” 

**Cognitive and Internal Effects:**  
Living in Te (Extraverted Thinking) and Ni (Introverted Intuition) feels unbalanced. The INFJ becomes hyper-focused on efficiency, neglecting Fe’s need for connection and harmony. Over time, they feel like a dictator—effective but emotionally barren and disconnected from their usual idealism.  

**External Signs:**  
They appear domineering and impatient, pushing others too hard and shutting down emotional conversations. Their compassion is replaced with a cold, results-driven demeanor.  

**Antidote:**  
Reconnecting with their Fe involves helping others through empathetic listening or volunteering. Creative, heart-centered activities—like painting or crafting—allow them to soften and rediscover their natural balance.  





The INFJ is a psychological shapeshifter, molded by circumstance and provoked by colorful characters who demand transformations they didn’t know they had in them. 

Each shift, though temporary, is a testament to their adaptability—and a little peek into the chaos of their inner world. 

After all…

**We aren’t merely just chameleons.**

*but living mosaics of refracted light, transformed with the grace of sunlight filtering through stained glass, morphing seamlessly between gem-like tones*

*shimmering, color-shifting marvels, rippling like liquid prisms, reflecting every hue of the rainbow in a hypnotic, fluid dance*

*a vibrant spectacle of nature's palette, glistening like oil on water, swirling with metallic greens, fiery oranges, and luminous purples*

*radiant beings of perpetual metamorphosis, gleaming like molten opal, shifting from deep indigo to molten gold with each subtle movement*

*masters of illusion, glowing with an ethereal brilliance, blending like a living aurora borealis against our surroundings*

*dazzling enigmas, mirroring a kaleidoscope’s heart, scattering infinite shards of light and color with every turn*

*spectral wonders, pulsing with a symphony of iridescence, we carry the essence of galaxies within our shifting hues*

*fantastical creatures of light and shadow, cloaked in a shimmering cascade of ever-changing jewel tones, like a dream painted in motion…*



**However…**

For the INFJ, being undercover in another MBTI type for **too** long is like wearing a costume that slowly becomes a cage. 

The antidote is always tied to their Ni-Fe pairing: introspection, meaningful connections, and symbolic creativity. 

By intentionally engaging with these functions, they can shed the mask and return to their true selves—deep, visionary, and empathetic.  





*Oh, and a word of warning to all the trolls—self-appointed arbiters of nuance, brandishing reductive judgments and wielding your tired rhetoric like dull axes:*

**Read the tag on this post.**  

## **IF you’re not an INFJ and have nothing of substance to add, kindly move along.**

I’m well-acquainted with every invective hurled at INFJs; your recycled critiques are as unoriginal as they are uninspired. 

Spare us all the tedium.

To reduce an ingenious survival tactic—crafted by evolution itself—to mere LARPing? 

That’s not just ignorance; it’s the tragic hubris of a limited belief system trying desperately to assert its relevance. 

The chameleon does not ""pretend""; it *thrives*. Its iridescent dance is not a costume but a masterpiece of adaptation, a hymn to survival in a world that demands creativity over conformity. 

The dismissal of such brilliance reveals far more about the critic than the criticized. Projection, after all, is the cheapest form of self-revelation.  

To call out ingenuity as fraudulence reeks of envy—envy of that which the troll fears they lack: versatility, resilience, the audacity to *shine*. 

**For to criticize what one cannot comprehend often stems not from insight but insecurity.**

*And so, trolls, consider this a warning wrapped in a gift: Your barbs are less cutting than illuminating. Each baseless critique serves only to mirror the confines of your own imagination.*

*Be wary, for the sting of your envy burns brighter than the spark of any fleeting insult you might conjure.*

*Grow. Adapt. Evolve—or stay hidden in the monochrome shadows of irrelevance.*",1,1733845668.0,infj,0,1.0,False

I authorize my own act of self-defense in response to a hostile entity making war on me and my family.

Nelson Mandela says no form of viooence can be excused. Camus says it’s all the same, whether you live or die or have a cup of coffee. MLK says violence never brings permanent peace. Gandhi says that non-violence is the mightiest power available to mankind.
That’s who they tell you are heroes. That’s who our revolutionaries are.
Yet is that not capitalistic? Non-violence keeps the system working at full speed ahead.
What did it get us. Look in the mirror.
They want us to be non-violent, so that they can grow fat off the blood they take from us.
The only way out is through. Not all of us will make it. Each of us is our own chief executive. You have to decide what you will tolerate.
In Gladiator 1 Maximus cuts into the military tattoo that identifies him as part of the roman legion. His friend asks “Is that the sign of your god?” As Maximus carves deeper into his own flesh, as his own blood drips down his skin, Maximus smiles and nods yes. The tattoo represents the emperor, who is god. The god emperor has made himself part of Maximus’s own flesh. The only way to destroy the emperor is to destroy himself. Maximus smiles through the pain because he knows it is worth it.
These might be my last words. I don’t know when they will come for me. I will resist them at any cost. That’s why I smile through the pain.
They diagnosed my mother with severe neuropathy when she was forty-one years old. She said it started ten years before that with burning sensations in her feet and occasional sharp stabbing pains. At first the pain would last a few moments, then fade to tingling, then numbness, then fade to nothing a few days later.
The first time the pain came she ignored it. Then it came a couple times a year and she ignored it. Then every couple months. Then a couple times a month. Then a couple times a week. At that point by the time the tingling faded to numbness, the pain would start, and the discomfort was constant. At that point even going from the couch to the kitchen to make her own lunch became a major endeavor
She started with ibuprofen, until the stomach aches and acid reflux made her switch to acetaminophen. Then the headaches and barely sleeping made her switch back to ibuprofen.
The first doctor said it was psychosomatic. Nothing was wrong. She needed to relax, destress, sleep more.
The second doctor said it was a compressed nerve in her spine. She needed back surgery. It would cost $180,000. Recovery would be six months minimum before walking again. Twelve months for full potential recovery, and she would never lift more than ten pounds of weight again.
The third doctor performed a Nerve Conduction Study, Electromyography, MRI, and blood tests. Each test cost $800 to $1200. She hit the $6000 deductible of her UnitedHealthcare plan in October. Then the doctor went on vacation, and my mother wasn’t able to resume tests until January when her deductible reset.
The tests showed severe neuropathy. The $180,000 surgery would have had no effect.
They prescribed opioids for the pain. At first the pain relief was worth the price of constant mental fog and constipation. She didn’t tell me about that until later. All I remember is we took a trip for the first time in years, when she drove me to Monterey to go to the aquarium. I saw an otter in real life, swimming on its back. We left at 7am and listened to Green Day on the four-hour car ride. Over time, the opioids stopped working. They made her MORE sensitive to pain, and she felt withdrawal symptoms after just two or three hours.
Then gabapentin. By now the pain was so bad she couldn’t exercise, which compounded the weight gain from the slowed metabolic rate and hormonal shifts. And it barely helped the pain, and made her so fatigued she would go an entire day without getting out of bed.
Then Corticosteroids. Which didn’t even work.
The pain was so bad I would hear my mother wake up in the night screaming in pain. I would run into her room, asking if she’s OK. Eventually I stopped getting up. She’d yell out anguished shrieks of wordless pain or the word “fuck” stretched and distended to its limits. I’d turn over and go back to sleep.
All of this while they bled us dry with follow-up appointment after follow-up appointment, specialist consultations, and more imagine scans. Each appointment was promised to be fully covered, until the insurance claims were delayed and denied. Allopathic medicine did nothing to help my mother’s suffering. Yet it is the foundation of our entire society.
My mother told me that on a good day the nerve pain was like her legs were immersed in ice water. On a bad day it felt like her legs were clamped in a machine shop vice, screwed down to where the cranks stopped turning, then crushed further until her ankle bones sprintered and cracked to accommodate the tightening clamp. She had more bad days than good.
My mother crawled to the bathroom on her hands and knees. I slept in the living room to create more distance from her cries in the night. I still woke up, and still went back to sleep.
Back then I thought there was nothing I could do.
The high copays made consistent treatment impossible. New treatments were denied as “not medically necessary.” Old treatments didn’t work, and still put us out for thousands of dollars.
UnitedHealthcare limited specialist consultations to twice a year.
Then they refused to cover advanced imaging, which the specialists required for an appointment.
Prior authorizations took weeks, then months.
UnitedHealthcare constantly changed their claim filing procedure. They said my mother’s doctor needed to fax his notes. Then UnitedHealthcare said they did not save faxed patient correspondence, and required a hardcopy of the doctor’s typed notes to be mailed. Then they said they never received the notes. They were unable to approve the claim until they had received and filed the notes.
They promised coverage, and broke their word to my mother.
With every delay, my anger surged. With every denial, I wanted to throw the doctor through the glass wall of their hospital waiting room.
But it wasn’t them. It wasn’t the doctors, the receptionists, administrators, pharmacists, imaging technicians, or anyone we ever met. It was UnitedHealthcare.
People are dying. Evil has become institutionalized. Corporations make billions of dollars off the pain, suffering, death, and anguished cries in the night of millions of Americans.
We entered into an agreement for healthcare with a legally binding contract that promised care commensurate with our insurance payments and medical needs. Then UnitedHealthcare changes the rules to suit their own profits. They think they make the rules, and think that because it’s legal that no one can punish them.
They think there’s no one out there who will stop them.
Now my own chronic back pain wakes me in the night, screaming in pain. I sought out another type of healing that showed me the real antidote to what ails us.
I bide my time, saving the last of my strength to strike my final blows. All extractors must be forced to swallow the bitter pain they deal out to millions.
As our own chief executives, it’s our obligation to make our own lives better. First and foremost, we must seek to improve our own circumstances and defend ourselves. As we do so, our actions have ripple effects that can improve the lives of others.
Rules exist between two individuals, in a network that covers the entire earth. Some of these rules are written down. Some of these rules emerge from natural respect between two individuals. Some of these rules are defined in physical laws, like the properties of gravity, magnetism or the potential energy stored in the chemical bonds of potassium nitrate.
No single document better encapsulates the belief that all people are equal in fundamental worth and moral status and the frameworks for fostering collective well-being than the US constitution.
Writing a rule down makes it into a law. I don’t give a fuck about the law. Law means nothing. What does matter is following the guidance of our own logic and what we learn from those before us to maximize our own well-being, which will then maximize the well-being of our loved ones and community.
That’s where UnitedHealthcare went wrong. They violated their contract with my mother, with me, and tens of millions of other Americans. This threat to my own health, my family’s health, and the health of our country’s people requires me to respond with an act of war.

11 years ago, when I was 21, I lost my Mother to cancer. Ever since I have felt left behind by that side of the family. I tried to keep in touch with them, tried to visit a couple of times, and I still to this day send them messages to check in. However, I have not felt that this goes both ways. Been a bit sad about that, but nothing major.

3 months ago my grandfather died. Since mom has passed, I, along with my sister, will inherit 1/3 while my two uncles inherit the rest. 

Yesterday I checked in with my aunt, wife of uncle 1. Wanted to hear how they were since my uncle did not write back when I messaged him last week. Long story short(er) I found out that the ceremony where we put the urn down in the cemetery was last Wednesday. She was extremely surprised about us not knowing since uncle 2 said we were unable to attend. 

I checked with my sister who had heard nothing, and my dad who said he had answered that he could not make it. Translated from my native language, the text dad got was ""The urn ceremony is .... let me know if you can make it. We can have a cup of coffee after. Uncle 2"". Nothing mentioning to tell us, and why would that be normal? We don't live at home!

This is where I might (I really do feel like I am) be the AH (Edit: to shorten to AH). I spent hours crying, and I seriously couldn't stop. I started angry-writing a message for uncle 2 who had been responsible (don't worry. My aunt chewed out uncle 1 for this, even though he was not the one responsible for planning the event, so he didn't coast by unscathed) but planned to wait until today, while calmer, to send it. I sound have waited to write it in the first place since I have sent angry messages in the heat of the moment before. 

So basically, I exploded. Roughly translated I wrote:

""I found out about the ceremony today. I, surprised, called my sis and dad to ask about it. Did you tell your kids and brother, if so why not us? I want you to treat us the same. We are family also.

I have NEVER felt as badly treated by another human being before. To find out afterwards, that a ceremony I planned to attend (since I couldn't attend my grandmothers because of the expense last time) took place without either me OR MY SIS knowing. It is fine if you only message my dad, but then for f*** sakes, make sure to ask him to pass the message along if you can't BE BOTHERED yourself.

I have felt excluded from this family since mom (not when you needed my help during covid with homeschooling though (I am a teacher), and I helped a lot seeing as we are family). But I did not think you were this idiotic. SERIOUSLY?!

Our relationship was complicated, but grandpa was in 50% of my positive childhood memories. How do you defend this?! I knew you were dense, but how idiotic is it to not let family know when such an important event is happening? Please explain this reasoning to me, 32F.""

Needed a place to vent and thought i’d come here. So, my ex and I were together for four years, all throughout college. We had a good long relationship, but by the end of it I was struggling. I was going to move to a new city for a job and he wasn’t graduating for another year. I made the fateful decision and decided it would be best for both of us to break up and take some time to find ourselves. We’d been together for so long, we were all we knew.  I thought that later on I’d regret not breaking it off would have been a disservice to the both of us. Now, a year has passed. He’s texted me a couple times asking to see me in this time period, but I always gave a vague response to why I couldn’t. I figured that seeing each other in person would bring up old feelings and I knew that wouldn’t be good for either of us. So no contact it was. Recently I had been thinking about him more, wanting to just maybe check in or get a coffee and see where his life is at now. A couple days ago, i saw he posted a new girl on his story. His new girlfriend. Initially i felt anger and rage, like how could he move on when it’s only been a year? How could he be with someone new when I still sorting through all of these emotions? I got really drunk one night and sent some stupid texts saying mostly what I said above. He just shut it down. I tried to call him and got no response. Embarrassing honestly. Made a damn fool of myself. Will not being doing that again. After that, I was sad. I realized how stupid that was, that it was I who made the decision to break things off, and I thought the no contact relationship was what was best. A year is enough and has nothing to do with the situation. I cried for days, i’m still crying honestly. I just miss him. I feel empty now, like I missed my chance and I’ll never get that back. Now that he’s in a new relationship, I have to respect boundaries but all I want to do is text him all of the time and just pour out my soul. But it’s not fair to him right? I had a year to make amends. If I love him I should want him to be happy but I just can’t take this feeling of hollowness in my chest. I’m trying so hard to let things be but it’s so hard.

1hb4dxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hb4dxk/new_benefit_of_quitting_coffee_no_more_seasonal/,New Benefit of Quitting Coffee - No more Seasonal Affectiveness Disorder,"It's been over a year since I've had my last cup of coffee. I've said this a million times and I'll say it a million times more: quitting coffee was the greatest gift my past-self could have ever given me. Some day, I'm going to write a long ass post about all the amazing benefits of quitting coffee and why everyone should do it.

But one of the benefits that I completely forgot about and just now realised in the beginning of Winter is that I no longer suffer from Seasonal Affectiveness Disorder. I noticed this the other day when I was having brunch with some friends and, when I asked how they were, they all said they were feeling very depressed and exhausted from SAD. And I thought to myself: ""Huh, did quitting coffee cure my Winter Blues?""

I live in Montreal and the winters here are brutal. Before quitting coffee, I would get immediately exhausted, depressed, and extremely irritable the moment we lost our hour of sunlight. I hated how gloomy Winter was so much that I would literally cry about it. I was always in a bad mood and I would often snap at people. I also overate a shit ton of high fat foods, 'cause the exhaustion made me think I was always hungry.

This is my first Winter where I am fully caffeine-sober and, for the first time in my life, I didn't even notice Winter had come. Yes, it got colder, there's snow everywhere, it's dark and grey all the time. But I'm not bothered by it whatsoever. I'm living my life as usual and following the same routine I've had from Spring and Summer. My sleep is still incredible, I still have the same amount of energy from the moment I wake up in the morning to the moment I fall asleep at night. I still go to work full-time and school part-time and socialise with friends and work out at the gym, plus I have energy leftover to work on my hobbies. I haven't snapped at anyone. I don't hate life. In fact, life is fucking awesome again and I'm so excited for the New Year. And the most amazing thing is that, as someone recovering from a severe addiction to junk food, it's become incredibly easy for me to say ""no"" to highly processed foods during the Holiday Season because I'm not so goddamn tired all the time. 

So yeah, quitting coffee is hard as hell, but it's so incredibly worth it. Your every day life becomes easier and everything feels a little brighter all the time. And that freedom of not having to rely on a substance to simply function is a feeling unlike any other. ",9,1733844748.0,decaf,2,1.0,False
1hb4duj,https://v.redd.it/c0q1bg0ki16e1,Fixing leaking [Delonghi Dedica],"I have an issue with my Delonghi Dedica and was hoping there are people 
here with experience in fixing those, or maybe could point me in the 
direction of a community that I could try.

After choking my machine it started leaking when I run it. Initially it looked like it
only happens when I use it with a portafilter with ground coffee, but I opened 
it up and in the video I run it without a portafilter and water comes 
up. I think this would rule out the large gasket that the portafilter 
pushes against as the culprit(or perhaps as the only culprit).

Could it be this red O-ring? Imgur.com/a/cNw6DX5
If anyone happens to know the dimensions or part number so I can order a 
replacement, that would be great!

This would be a good excuse to upgrade, but that's not really 
financially convenient right now, and I enjoy giving it a try to fix it.

Would welcome any tips on what to look at, or experiences from people 
with similar issues.

It was significantly below my $2000 budget which I definitely liked the savings from the initial retail price. 

I am currently operating with no espresso machine since my profit ago surprisingly sold within two days of me listing it on marketplace for US$ 750. It was in pristine condition, and the buyer insisted on picking it up ASAP which ended up being 8 o’clock on a Sunday night.  

I did enjoy the profitec but I was not satisfied with how long it would take to get out 6+ milk drinks when we would have company over and also no water spout. 

I saw the prophet tech move will be coming out in May 4 $2000 plus the additional tax so close to $2200  which would be over my budget and also $1000 difference than the Sylvia pro X purchase price I received. I know the MOVE has some bells and whistles the SPX does not but at a higher cost than what I paid for

I know the Sylvia pro X is three or so years old now but I’m just looking for some feedback from people that own the machine and are still using it? How does it hold up for multiple drinks. 

I am hoping I made the right decision. I also don’t want to wait until May for a new machine.

While cruise ships comprise less than 1% of the vessels at sea, they are at the “forefront” of this sector in developing responsible environmental practices."" “Because of environmental innovations by CLIA Cruise Line Members, new ships that enter into service today, no matter their size, are among the most environmentally friendly ships.”He cites a recent CLIA study, prepared by independent experts, which assessed emissions levels at ports. It found that cruise ships account for just 1.2% (Europe) or 3% (US) of the total, with the rest produced by other commercial shipping vessels.""

   Now this gives some insight when I was present for a early morning coffee chat offered by the Cruise Director in the Brooklyn Cafe on Seashore. He told the small crowd of 9 passengers that gathered that (this was just after covid) NCL approached MSC to have them buy out NCL. MSC response was ""No thank you. We would rather keep building new ships than take over old ships.""",3,1733844026.0,MSCCruises,0,0.8,False

I had really curly hair, a black puffer and blue jeans 

If you see this or anyone who knows you does it’d be nice to meet for coffee sometime. I don’t live in Burlington, I was picking up items to take to family dinner.

1hb421g,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hb421g/improve_coffee_quality_from_office_espresso/,Improve coffee quality from office espresso Machine [LaMarzocco Linea Classic | Eureka Zenit 65],"Hey guys!

We have a LaMarzocco Linea Classic at work, which was built in 2017 (which is an absolute luxury). And since I took over the responsibilities for our coffee making, the quality drastically improved. Before we had cheap ""Italian espresso beans"" really dark roasted, because we a contract with a supplier. I took over and started buying higher quality beans and now settled with a local ""kind of speciality"" roastery and usually get their house blend (100% arabica), since not all my coworkers are fans of high acidity fruit bombs. I always get those fresh (not older than a month). I also take care of maintenance and cleaning of the machine (could be more often I gotta admit, kind of forgetting sometimes) and just ordered a yearly checkup from a local speciality expert and LaMarzocco partner, which came back as ""everything seems fine"". We filter our water with a filter, which was also renewed with the checkup and I set the PID temperature to 93,5°C. I do weigh the coffee going into the basket and also do some puck prep with WDT and measure the shot timing (at least sometimes). For grinders we have some Eureka Zenitz 65s, since back when the machine(s) were purchased, there wasn't a big market for grinders. I am far from satisfied with those grinders, since they are very unprecise with the output and produce a lot of fines.

And still, with all the measurements I put in, I can't remember having a great shot. It's usually not too much acidity or over extracted, it just tastes off and bad. I am looking for things I can change, which are applicable to the setup in an office environment. What I mean, I can't use RDT since there is no room for single dosing (at least for the espresso, I tried/sometimes make pour over, but the grinders *really suck* at that). Also I probably can't buy a new fancy grinder in the short run.

So every help and suggestion is welcome!

1hb3zh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightshift/comments/1hb3zh6/i_left_day_shift_for_night_shift_now_having_mixed/,I left day shift for night shift.... now having mixed feelings ,"I work on a psych unit as an RN. I did 7am-7-30pm for a year. Let me start by saying what I disliked about days:

1. Way too busy, a lot of people have more energy than you do and you're like WTF? After a while coffee wasn't working, I'd have two of them throughout the day and still. 

2. Waking up at 5am to start at 7am sucks, there's no way I can convince my mind that 9pm-11pm the night before is bedtime, it's challenging because if I'm off the next day, I'm staying up until like 2am and waking up 11am/12pm the next day. Sometimes my body feels ""sickly"" (?) waking up at 5am, in the sense that my allergies are going bonkers (sneezing, itchy nose/eyes, dryness) and a sense of mild water retention.

3. I also found myself eating a lot more because I was exerting myself more, if I didn't get something in my belly before clocking in, i'd feel miserable but then by 10am I NEED ""Breakfast #2"". 

4. Being in-charge on days sucks (usually once a month on average for me). In addition to doing your normal nursing tasks, you have to do two assignments (7am and 3pm), you have to fill out the report for every patient, you have to give two reports (one to the doctors, etc. and one to the 7pm nurses).

So now.... A guy on night shift left in the summer, I asked if I could have it, the rest is history. I have now been on nights for a month and half. I like that its less busy, the time goes by fast after 11pm, and being in charge on nights isn't as bad (1 assignment, 1 report). All was fine up until this past week. I've been feeling a bit more tired than usual. If I come off from working a shift, I sleep from 9am-3pm, if I don't work again that night I go to bed 2am and wake up 12pm the next day. Yesterday was bad though, it was Day off #2 and I was really tired.

Admittedly, I've also been reading a bit too much into google/word of mouth about the potential health problems associated with nights. I think I'm starting to regret this but I don't know if i'm jumping the gun. I've been thinking about asking my boss if I can go back to days but there's a catch....

Immediately when I took the night position, they hired a new RN to take my spot on day shift. Now I don't know if there are any additional day openings left (they're staffed at 9 nurses now), but logically most employers give you 90 days to return to your former position. I don't know how a new guy taking my place complicates that though.

Could I just be jumping the gun and need to give nights more time? What would you guys do?",2,1733843669.0,Nightshift,9,1.0,False

I spend a lot of time working by myself and my job gives me too much down town. I enjoy meeting new people and developing new friendships online. My life outside of work can be very busy so I dont have many IRL friends. 

I've always been really talking to women until a few years ago getting into some different experiences that pushed myself and I've found I enjoy talking to women with similar interests in life more so then male friends. Humor is definitely my first line of currency for communication And I enjoy sharing a good laugh. 

If you are obsessed with a coffee addiction and love getting cozy on the couch for a movie, send me a message and we can get to know one another.

1hb3nf3,https://i.redd.it/jouaixitc16e1.jpeg,First time making tallow soap - this time with a photo,"Hello! I tried making soap for the first time and learned I have a lot to learn. I followed the recipe here https://bumblebeeapothecary.com/how-to-make-tallow-soap-recipe-diy-tutorial/ except I substituted coffee for water and added the coffee grounds as an exfoliant and about a tablespoon of honey at trace. I used cold process. It set up nicely in my mold, but after cutting at 24 hours I see that there is an outer rind and a slightly different texture in the interior. There were small amounts of liquid coffee that oozed out of this interior section when I cut the soap.

I was very excited to use another part of the deer I hunt and am a bit sad this batch doesnt seem to have worked out. Please help! I still have about 1.5lbs of tallow and I was going to make another batch following that recipe more exactly, with water and essential oils.

I was also using an analog scale and am trying to source a digital - could this be another contributing issue?

Edit: After perusing the resources sent by the bot, I am guessing I had a partial gel from cooling too quickly. Is the soap ruined or can I still use it?",1,1733842801.0,soapmaking,4,1.0,False

Market analysis reveals VS2 as the second most popular clarity grade, capturing 30% of engagement ring purchases due to its optimal balance of quality and value.

A 1-carat VS2 round brilliant diamond with G color might cost around $3,700-$9,700, while a similar VS1 diamond could cost $4,700-$10,500. Also, VS2 clarity is more likely to be eye-clean in smaller diamonds, around 1.00 carat, making this grade ideal for most buyers.

This comprehensive guide provides advanced strategies for navigating the VS2 market, including size-specific selection criteria, shape considerations, and expert techniques for identifying the highest-performing stones in this premium clarity grade.

# Bottom Line

VS2 diamonds offer excellent value, balancing quality and affordability. They typically have minor inclusions not visible to the naked eye, making them a popular choice for engagement rings. However, careful inspection is crucial as not all VS2 diamonds are eye-clean, especially in larger sizes. Lab-grown diamonds often achieve higher clarity grades (VS1-VVS2), potentially offering better value than VS2 for the same price tag. For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing from trusted retailers that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

# Who is this for?

* Budget-conscious buyers seeking a visually clean diamond
* Those prioritizing size over perfect clarity
* Buyers of diamonds under 2 carats

# Who is this not for?

* Perfectionists insisting on flawless diamonds
* Those buying very large diamonds (over 2 carats)
* Buyers of step-cut diamonds (e.g., emerald, asscher) where inclusions are more visible

# Pros and Cons

Pros:

* Often appear flawless to the naked eye
* More affordable than higher clarity grades
* Wide variety available

Cons:

* Not guaranteed to be eye-clean
* May have visible inclusions in larger sizes
* Require careful inspection before purchase

# Recommendations for Smart Buying

1. Always check high-resolution images or videos of the specific diamond.
2. Pay attention to the location and type of inclusions on the plot diagram.
3. Consider the diamond's cut and shape - brilliant cuts hide inclusions better.
4. For diamonds over 1.5 carats, consider moving up to VS1 for better clarity.
5. Use trusted retailers with good return policies.

A: Generally between $3,000 and $7,000, depending on other factors like cut and color.

Q: Should I choose a VS2 diamond for an engagement ring?A: VS2 diamonds are popular for engagement rings due to their good balance of quality and value.

For my whole life, I bounced around from different family members houses and was so ready to be on my own. I graduated college but lived at home while I did it, commuted over and hour both ways, so it really felt like an extension of high school to me. 

I love my boyfriend and I also absolutely adore his mom and dad. He lived with them up until now. I lost my mom at a really young age and his mom is the only woman figure I’ve ever had in my life who *somewhat* fills the void of my mother. She is literally an angel. I talk to her every single day, have coffee with her in the mornings when i sleep over, go to markets with her, etc. She really treats me like a daughter. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for a long time and we decided to move out but it happened so quick. I’m talking - we toured, applied, got approved, and moved in all within a week. (We didn’t even have any actual plans to move out but were touring for when we were ready) His parents were (and still are) SO supportive and encouraging, they’ve never made us feel like we’re making a wrong choice or moving too soon. 

Now, we’ve pretty much moved in, but I keep having anxiety because I feel like we moved way too fast and like I made a huge mistake leaving his family. His home life was great, mine not so much but I loved going to his house because I could also spend time with his parents. It feels like what I would imagine leaving your own mom feels like lol. 

Does this feeling go away? I feel like I should be so happy and excited but I’m anxious and feeling like I don’t know if I’ll feel at home here. We love the place so much and it’s 15 mins away from them but I can’t stop feeling like this :( ",2,1733842321.0,Adulting,2,1.0,False

I was so focused on what to get and how to preserve it that I was a little shortsighted on where to keep it all! I have plenty of pantry space for my canned goods and a lot of my dehydrated goods, but am low on options for my bulk items that I'm putting into mylar bags. 

My home has minimal storage space, but I can make room in a closet for a large-ish tote. I had initially planned on keeping some metal garbage cans w/tight fitting lids (per a previous post I read to keep out bugs/rodents) in the crawl space of my house and filling those with mylar bags....but it's not insulated, so it's highly unlikely that the temp in there will stay in the preferred 40-60 degree range. 

Are there items that will do ok for long-term storage outside of that temp range? If I take additional steps of putting the cans on a pallet or making a mini enclosure, will that help? 

For reference, my food preps include canned goods (home canned and store bought) that are kept in the pantry, home dehydrated goods (backpacker-type meals, veggies, dog treats, etc....) sealed in mylar that would be for both house & long-term storage, store-bought dry goods (rice, beans, flour, instant coffee, oats, cereal, pet food, spices, etc....I'm still building) sealed in mylar that would mainly be for long-term storage but would be rotated out as needed. The last two categories is what I would likely need to store under the house. I also plan on adding freeze-dried products (Mountain House, Augason Farms, etc....) at some point.

I also posted this on the /addiction subreddit. 

I (27F) am meeting with my cousin (24M) at the end of the week after the tried to kill himself (or at least he self-harmed) a month ago. He is/was addicted to alcohol (4 liters a day, according to him) and marihuana. His girlfriend broke up with him on his birthday and he self-harmed/tried to end his life (I am not sure how he worded it). I live very far away from home, in another continent, and he is not big on messaging, so I haven’t spoken to him yet. I am back home now for the holidays and he agreed to meet for coffee this weekend, alone with me.

Right now he is theoretically not drinking. He was taken to a psychiatrist who gave him medicine to sleep (he was experiencing insomnia) and he is apparently better. As I said he is not drinking, he is eating well and he’s started to go back to the gym (I am afraid this might become another addiction). However, nobody has talked to him about what led him to having this issues, and I don’t think anyone has tried to address the self-harm issue because they see it as a one-time thing, triggered by the break-up.

I would like advice on how to talk to him. We were close as kids but drifted apart after my father died when I was 15 and I consequently developed deppression and suicidal tendencies as well. I would like to be able to talk to him in a way that is relatable (drawing from my own experience) but not patronizing. I would like advice on how to do this from people on this subreddit who might have been on the other side of the conversation, where my cousin is. He has always been introverted, but we always had good rapport and I am introverted too. I think nobody in my family has had the patience and understanding to talk to him in a meaningful way beyond addiction. He doesn’t want to check in into a program; so would you advice I become “his sponsor” and give him a sort of token to keep track of his addiction? I would also sort of work as a “promise” so he does not feel alone.

1hb3cra,https://i.redd.it/425je6rfa16e1.jpeg,"First setup after diving deep into the rabbit hole, my advice to beginners. ","Once I found the espresso rabbit hole, I couldn’t get out. I knew I was going to pull the trigger on a machine, then it led to a grinder, which led to accessories. Let me say I researched this thoroughly, for months, and finally have my first setup. I want to provide some advice to novices and beginners just getting into the hobby:
- don’t invest too much 
- don’t overthink it, people get way too many tools and gadgets, way too much machine for their needs, etc.
- the most important thing is your coffee. everyone likes to say grinder is the most important thing but I disagree. without good fresh coffee, all the equipment in the world won’t help much.  

With that being said, here my setup and this likely all you will need and more to get started: 
Budget: $750-$800 all-in 
• Breville Bambino Plus - $400 Black Friday sale on Amazon, I’ve heard some people find this even cheaper at stores like TJ Maxx, Marshall’s, Home Goods on Black Friday. 
• DF54 Grinder: $230 - order directly from the manufacturer to avoid having to align the burrs yourself
• MHW-3Bomber Tamp w/ walnut handle: you need a good tamp, don’t skip this. normcore is another brand that would be great for the tamp
• WDT tool: I also went with MHW for this, normcore is another brand that would be great for the wdt tool
• Dosing funnel: I went with Matow brand from Amazon, matte black ones look cool but I wanted stainless steel to avoid any wdt tool scratching the matte black finish in my coffee grounds, got this bc it avoids messy coffee grounds on your counter daily 
• Dosing Capsules/Tubes: helps pre weigh your coffee doses (18g per double shot) so you don’t have to get the scale out everyday, also just looks sweet 
• Dosing cup: I got this simply bc I didn’t like the plastic one that came stock with the DF54, highly optional, went with Normcore brand 

Before this setup, I ordered the Cafelat Robot and returned it. I’m sure it’s a great machine but I did not enjoy the manual workflow at all. Then I was thinking I wanted to go balls deep in this hobby or not at all and ALMOST bought a ECM Synchronika and expensive grinder. Just couldn’t justify spending $3.5-4K.

Overall, no regrets at all and super happy with my setup. Pulling excellent creamy and balanced espresso shots since shot 1. Milk is a different story that is going to take some practice. I’m a cappuccino guy and they are tasting so much better than my drip coffee. You can see I haven’t used the chemex pictured in the back since getting the espresso setup.

I (32F) had Covid in early October. All the normal symptoms, except I never lost my sense of taste/smell. Instead, they just got…weird. 

Everything smells like somewhat burnt cat food, and some of it tastes like it too (I assume, I’ve never eaten it). Some examples:
- Peanut butter, which I can no longer eat because it’s so bad
- Coffee
- Any and all meats
- Pretty much anything pre-packaged 
- Most cream-based sauces 
- When multiple types of food smells are intermingling—walking into a restaurant sucks 

Some foods/smells are unaffected, but not many. The last time I had Covid I became extremely sensitive to salt or anything with vinegar in it, but didn’t experience anything like this. 

Have you ever heard of something like this? Is there anything I can do to help fix it? It’s been a miserable couple of months and I just want it to stop. ",1,1733841963.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1hb3c8w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hb3c8w,Da Hong Pao From Manyexiang - Lots of coffee,"I am not a big fan of Wuyi Rock Tea. Even though I am Chinese. I have always thought that Rock Tea is expensive, so I have always avoided it. Then I recently saw someone recommend this on a Chinese social app:

Manyexiang's Da Hong Pao. It looks like a large cigarette set with an outdated design. The small box inside also looks like a cigarette box. Each small box contains 12.5g for one tea meeting. The key is the very everyday price, 65RMB/125g. And the manufacturer is reputable. 

Why not give it a try?

I use a slightly larger gaiwan to brew it, without rinsing, and do not stop for the first three brews. Starting from the fourth brew, increase the time by 5s, 10s, and 20s each time.

The color of the brewed tea is similar to that of Americano, and the taste is coffee, freshly baked rye bread, slight sweetness, woody aroma, and a hint of coffee sourness in the aftertaste.

It's so much like a tea version of an Americano! My water temperature isn't high enough, so there may be some floral notes that I'm not aware of, but so far, I'm very pleased with the taste.",2,1733841957.0,tea,1,0.67,False

We followed him down the road and this man said that it was for a case. I know that I never did anything to warrant a private investigator and as per my bf neither did he all his court stuff was from years ago.

Also:

When I went to get money from the bank for my boss this man (60’s M) was parked across from my van watching me. I have a picture of him with his plate and he’s just sitting there drinking his coffee.

Today this man saw us driving behind him and pulled over so we pass him so we did the same thing after he did it to us. He was of course, videoing us again. 

We reported it to the police both times in different cities so different protocol for both but the one today just told us to hide from him so he doesn’t know where we are but we have seen him in the woods 30 mins away from where we normally stay.

The Echo of Us By Maina Gam
Chapter 1: The Beginning
It was the autumn of 2019 when Emma first walked into the coffee shop on 5th Street. The golden leaves swirled outside, a perfect reflection of the warm, comforting atmosphere inside. She’d just moved to the city, fresh from college, a bundle of dreams and uncertainties. Sitting in the corner with her sketchpad, she began to draw the passing faces of the busy world outside the window.
Jake had been working at the coffee shop for a year, serving lattes and cappuccinos to customers, but never really connecting with anyone. It was just another day for him—until he saw her. She had a quiet elegance about her, with long auburn hair cascading over her shoulders, and eyes that seemed to observe the world without judgment.
Jake had always been more of a listener than a talker, but there was something about Emma that made him want to break the silence.
""Is that the cityscape?"" Jake asked, leaning over the counter, his voice gentle. ""It's beautiful.""
Emma glanced up, a little startled. A smile tugged at her lips as she nodded, her cheeks slightly flushed. ""Yes, I love drawing the little moments. It helps me feel grounded in this chaotic city.""
""You're new here, right?"" Jake asked, already recognizing the fresh-faced expression that newcomers often wore.
Emma nodded. ""Just moved in last week. Trying to get used to everything, but it’s... overwhelming.""
Jake chuckled. ""It can be, but if you ever need a break, this place is perfect for people-watching.""
And that was how they began—two strangers with different lives, both finding solace in the simplicity of a coffee shop and a shared moment.

Chapter 2: Growing Closer
Weeks passed, and Emma found herself visiting the coffee shop more often. Jake always made her favorite drink, a caramel latte with an extra shot of espresso, and they started talking. At first, it was about trivial things—city life, books they liked, art, and how both of them had an unspoken longing for something more in life.
Their connection grew naturally. What began as fleeting conversations over steaming cups of coffee soon evolved into something deeper. They would sit together after closing time, talking about everything—hopes, regrets, and the kind of love they’d both dreamed of but had never found.
Emma had come to realize that her heart had begun to beat differently when she was around Jake. It wasn’t just the warmth of the coffee or the soothing hum of the shop—it was him. She found herself thinking about him when she wasn’t there. She started drawing him in her sketchbook, not as he was, but as a version of him in a world where love was all-encompassing and perfect.
Jake, too, felt the pull. He’d never been one for big gestures or proclamations, but Emma made him want to be better, to be more. He wasn’t sure when it happened—whether it was the way she laughed at his jokes or how her presence seemed to fill the empty spaces in his life—but he knew he was falling in love with her.
One rainy evening, as the city was drenched in the kind of rain that turned the streets into rivers of reflection, Jake found himself standing in front of Emma, his heart pounding.
""I don’t know when it happened, but I can't stop thinking about you, Emma,"" Jake confessed, his voice soft but certain. ""You’re like the missing piece I didn’t know I was searching for.""
Emma’s breath caught in her throat, her heart skipping a beat. She hadn’t realized how much she’d been waiting for those words until now. She reached for his hand, her fingers trembling as they brushed against his.
""I feel the same way,"" she whispered. ""Like we were always supposed to find each other.""
And in that moment, under the dim lights of the coffee shop, with the rain beating against the windows, Emma and Jake found the kind of love that only happens once in a lifetime.
Chapter 3: The Test of Time

As time passed, the challenges of life began to creep in. Emma’s art career started to take off, and she was offered a chance to move to Paris for a year to study under a renowned artist. It was everything she had dreamed of, but it also meant leaving Jake behind.

""I can’t ask you to stay,"" Jake said one evening, his voice thick with emotion. ""You deserve to chase your dreams.""

Emma’s heart ached, torn between the life she had built with Jake and the opportunity she had worked so hard for. The thought of leaving him was unbearable, but she also knew that this was something she had to do for herself.

""Promise me one thing,"" she whispered, her voice trembling. ""No matter where we are, we’ll always be each other’s home.""

Jake held her tightly, his arms wrapping around her like they were never meant to be apart. ""I promise. No matter what happens, you’ll always have a place in my heart.""

Chapter 4: The Distance

The months apart were the hardest they had ever faced. Emma immersed herself in her art, learning and growing in Paris, but the city felt cold without Jake by her side. She missed their late-night talks, his gentle presence, and the way he understood her without needing words.

Jake, too, found himself missing her more than he thought was possible. His days at the coffee shop were quieter without her, and the city, which had once felt so full of life, seemed empty without her smile.

Despite the distance, they kept in touch. Their love, though tested, never wavered. They shared stories of their days, sending letters and pictures, and every now and then, Emma would sketch scenes of Paris for Jake, showing him the world she was discovering. Jake, in turn, would send her little mementos from the city—a pressed flower, a photo of the sunset they had once watched together.

Chapter 5: The Return

After a year, Emma returned to the city. She stood in front of the coffee shop, nervous and excited, unsure of how things would be after all this time.

As she stepped inside, she saw Jake at the counter, his familiar face lighting up the room as he looked up. His eyes softened when he saw her, and in that instant, all the distance, the time, and the challenges they had faced seemed to melt away.

Emma smiled, her heart overflowing. ""I’m home,"" she said softly.

Jake walked over to her, his arms opening wide. ""You never had to leave, Emma. This is where you belong.""

And with that, they embraced—two souls who had once been apart, but were now home in each other’s arms. Their love, tested by time and distance, was stronger than ever, and they knew that no matter what came next, they would face it together.

Epilogue: The Future

Years later, Emma and Jake were married, their love only deepening as they built a life together. Emma’s art flourished, with her work displayed in galleries across the world. Jake continued his job at the coffee shop, but now it was more than just a place to work—it was their shared space, a symbol of everything they had built together.

They still spent nights stargazing, dreaming about the future, their hands intertwined, knowing that their love was as timeless as the stars above.

And every so often, Emma would sketch the city skyline—this time, with Jake by her side, their love etched in the stars above.

The End.

1hb2ztg,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hb2ztg/proposed_tweak_to_jeffs_ult/,Proposed tweak to Jeff's ult,"So I think Jeff is a great character and is a really fun addition to the game but I think we can all agree, getting eaten and having to wait while doing nothing until he drags you off the map and then eating a respawn timer gets old fast. So I was thinking about how Jeff could be a little less frustrating and I had a few ideas:

* I think the cleanest solution would be to make Jeff spit out players if he falls off an edge. This means that if a Jeff wants to throw people off the map, he'll need to navigate around drops instead of beelining for the nearest edge and jumping off with the team. It also incentivises the Jeff to not jump off himself because he'll auto-spit as he falls and die anyway. It also adds some counterplay if you're playing a mobile character that can dash, fly etc. but still guarantees the kills on immobile characters. This is obviously a nerf but Jeff players would now need to consider pathing and if there is no clear route, he still gets to do a lot of damage, waste time and spit enemies out in an unfavourable position.
* Alternatively, Dead By Daylight has a mechanic where if a survivor is being carried by the killer, they can do skill checks to wiggle and interfere with the killer's pathing. If this was added to Jeff, I could see it being an engaging way to add a bit of counterplay. I'd also make it stack per player so if the Jeff eats one player, then the skill checks wouldn't interfere with his movement too much but if he eats 3+, then it becomes significantly harder to run straight off an edge if players are hitting their skill checks. So now Jeff players would need to consider how many people they are eating since guaranteeing a kill on 2 enemies might be better than eating 5 and not being able to secure the kills. It also just adds something to do during his ult since right now, I can go off, make a coffee, scroll Tiktok and walk my dog in the time it takes Jeff to kill me and respawn.

And lastly, I think one thing that's just needed is a change to the vertical range of his ult or a change in the visuals to better communicate the actual range since right now, I can be 15ft in the air and still get eaten which never feels good.

Ultimately, I love him and I melt every time I look at his little face but I hate playing against him. I'd love to hear what you all think or if you have any other ideas about him!",1,1733840979.0,marvelrivals,5,0.67,False
1hb2zhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/NursingUK/comments/1hb2zhx/call_bells_and_hcas/,Call bells and HCA's,"I am an RN working in a very busy acute and medical ward. All our HCA's are band 2 and it puts a lot of pressure on the nurses.
If I am not busy I always try to answer my patients call bells but most of the time I am swamped with blood transfusions, IV's and discharges etc!
So the point in this post is to vent my frustration with the rude responses and comments from HCA's when I'm unable to answer a call bell at any given moment. I feel like they do not see things through my perspective. For example, in the afternoon when turns and washes have been completed the HCAs will sit in the office and eat cake and drink tea.. meanwhile I'm swamped with work yet they will still complain if I don't answer a buzzer? The nurses on the ward never get out on time or have time for an afternoon ''coffee' yet we still get *side eyed* and comments made to us from the hcas if we are too busy to answer a buzzer or delegate a task to them. Does anyone else have this issue? The HCAs always get out on time and as they are band 2 so they don't have as much responsibility.. I just feel it is a bit unfair the grief we get as nurse for delegating a task. 
I worked as a HCA for years prior to becoming a nurse and I was understanding and accepted tasks delegated to me within reason. The majority of HCA's are great and I do understand they have a lot of physical work to complete with turns and washes but seeing them sit there and eat cake on the ward after getting grief for not answering a buzzer is frustrating.",15,1733840952.0,NursingUK,19,0.83,False
1hb2z8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrincessCruises/comments/1hb2z8n/30th_nov_2024_eastern_caribbean_sun_princess/,30th Nov 2024 - Eastern Caribbean - Sun Princess Review,"Hi Folks,

As promised here is my review of the Sun Princess. I just want to stay beforehand I have travelled on 10 different cruise lines and everything I write is my own personal view which may some not agree with.  I have tried to keep the review brief, feel free to post any questions in the comments.  The best cruise company I have been with to date is Royal Caribbean so my view is going to be based against this.

**Check-in / Boarding  at Port Everglades**

Whilst the terminal is no where near as nice as RC's port in Miami, the building is 'fit for purpose' and the check-in process was smooth. From leaving the Uber to getting on the ship took around 30 minutes. We had a check-in window of 11am - 1:30pm, we arrived at the terminal at 12:30pm. What I did find strange is the Princess Staff asked to see my ESTA, I've never been asked to provide this on any cruise or in fact at any airport so I was surprised the staff wanted to see a printed copy of this. If you are from outside of the USA you may want to print this and bring it with you. We were given a leaflet outlining which restaurants were open and where our muster drill would take place.

**Onboard - My First Impression**

If I could sum up my first impression on getting on board the ship I would say 'confused' I say this because we boarded the ship on Deck 4 which is the 'gangway' deck so there is nothing to see here. Every other ship I have been on, you usually board on the 'main deck' such as where the shops and restaurants are. There was a big queue to get the elevators so I decided to just take the stairs and get to a 'proper' deck. We got to Deck 7 and we were impressed! The ship looked so new, modern and clean! We decided to go to our cabins next...

**Cabin**

The cabin was just 'WOW' again so new and modern, this was the best cabin I have ever seen on a cruise! The width was a little small but over the next several days we really enjoyed the time we spent inside. The free video on demand service was excellent (when it worked). The room was very comfortable and the bed was amazing we wanted to take it home with us! The shower was super powerful and overall I would give the cabin 10/10.

**Muster Drill**

Our Muster drill took place in the Casino at 2pm and this was a bit of mess...there was apparently an issue with the tablets the staff use to scan your medallion so we wasted close to 1hr 45 minutes here whilst the staff rectified the issue.

**Bar / Drinks**

I don't drink alcohol but my partner does so I was really unsure whether to buy the plus package or not. After reading through all the reviews and working out the cost of the Wi-fi which we would both need I decided to get the package and I am gad I did it was worth it.

During the cruise we found the bar service was again excellent, with only having to wait a maximum of ten minutes for a drink. What I did find disappointing though was the lack of non alcohol drinks! there really wasn't much on offer apart from Coke and Sprite. In some restaurants /bars you could get 'Zero' version of drinks which I prefer other places only had 'diet' which I don't like.  I was also expecting a lot more mock-tails but there were not any available. The juice bar seemed the main place for non alcohol drinks. I also found the free drinks selection to be pretty poor compared to RC, with only water, tea coffee and lemonade on offer. If you have been with RC before you will know they have a range of Nestle Juices every day and usually offer 2-3 a day. Rating for drinks 3/5  
Rating for bar staff 5/5

**Food**

On embarkation day we ate at Lido Taco's (Deck 17) and had the Lamb Shawarma (For UK Folk this is a Doner Kebab) the lamb tasted great and no oil / no fat. We were served quickly and also ordered some drinks at our table.  Also on Deck 17 you have a choice of Hot Dogs and Pizza's again which are good!

We ate in ""The Eatery"" multiple times, and there are a few things I did not enjoy so much:

1. On Port Days The Eatery is the only place open for a ""traditional breakfast"", the main dinning room is closed. It is therefore super busy and difficult to get a table, some days we had to wait up to 10/15 minutes to find somewhere to sit.
2. The temperature in The Eatery varies a lot based on where you sit, sometimes the only table we could get was right under the AC and was super cold. We noticed one side of The Eatery was a comfortable temperature whereas the other side was ice cold!
3. Already mentioned this before but if your on the free drinks package you only have a choice of water, coffee, tea and lemonade

Now on to the food!

The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great either, there wasn't a single dish I ate that I thought 'wow I definitely need to eat more of this'.

The biggest issue with the food in general on Sun Princess is that it lacked flavour! Whilst everything was cooked well it didn't have enough flavour, everything tasted bland even the indian food! I tried the Fresh Chinese Noodles station in the eatery and this was disappointing, the noodles were soaked in Oil and again no flavour. I tried the main dinning room and again the food was very bland.

The food at The Eatery is pretty much the same every day apart from two nights where they did an American Theme Night and a German Themed Nights,

I love desserts and all of the desserts I tried including the cookies were just 'okay', most tasted like frozen desserts you would find in a supermarket.

We wanted to visit O'malleys but could never get a table due to the majority of guests (I feel) being very selfish and spending all evening here playing cards / dominoes. As others have stated the only way to get a table here is to queue from 5:30pm.

We didn't try Alfredo's as it didn't appeal to us to visit another pizza venue when there were already 2 on board, and pizza in the eatery.

Overall I would give the food a 3/5, whilst everything was cooked well it lacked flavour and variety.

**Ice Cream?**

I was disappointed to find the only free ice cream was in the Main Dinning room, for all other venues unless you had the plus package you could not get ice cream. The 2 Ice Cream Sundae's I tested again were just 'okay'. I've tested a lot of ice cream sundae's and in my opinion they should be a good mix of Ice Cream plus other ingredients such as cake...the Sundae I tested was 99% Ice Cream and one tiny piece of cake which wasn't great.  There was never any ice cream on offer in The Eatery.

**Entertainment**

This was disappointing and confusing, the entertainment definitely seemed to be targeted for an older audience with the bulk of the entertainment being dance classes in the Piazza...and here is another issue. The Piazza! What a mess! The Christmas decorations make it impossible to see anything from Deck 8 and 9. The majority of shows are not broadcast on the TV at the back so again its impossible to see anything! The Piazza wasn't a good idea! We often found ourself dreading sea days as there really wasn't much to do!

I would give the entertainment a 2/5

**Casino**

The Casino is way too small for the size of ship, we found several machines we wanted to play were too busy to use. When we did get a chance to use them they definitely seemed 'fair' and on several occasions we did win over $100. I did also witness multiple passengers winning above $2,000 so this is good! Also as a non-smoker I am really not a fan of smoking in the casino its very difficult to breath!

**Wi-Fi On Board**

Not much to say here apart from that it worked well without any issues.

**Staff**

All staff I met and interacted with were great, I would give the staff a 5/5! No complaints here they are doing a fantastic job

**Princess Cay**

A nice private island with lots of free sun beds, there were a few small issues. We got off the ship and went to the right side, be aware there is only 1 bar here and it does get busy! The food buffet is only open for 2 hours..I believe it finishes at 2pm however the ship leaves at 5pm...so if you want food after 2pm there are no options. The Wi-Fi took forever to get a connection I believe the network is overloaded...it took around 40/50 attempts to finally get connected as I wanted to listen to a podcast on the beach.

**Amber Cove - Coconut Grove**

This was an interesting experience, we got on board a converted lorry and made our way to the beach. The Journey was rough.,,with over 95% of being on Dirt Tracks...you will get thrown about a lot and its not comfortable at all. It took around 1hr 15 minutes to get to Coconut Grove.

The actual beach resort is nice, the staff are good and don't pester you. Food is priced at a reasonable $18 a person for the buffet with unlimited soft drinks which I think is a fair price. There is also free Wi-Fi here. Be aware due to travel time you will only have around 3 hours here.

Overall this was an okay excursion probably one I would not do again due to the journey being so long and so rough but once to try out if you haven't been before.

**Grand Turk**

For Grand Turk we didn't book an excursion and just explored the port and beach. This wasn't a good experience, we were constantly hassled by people trying to sell us a premium beach experience. Whilst there are free beach chairs they are set very far back from the ocean and you can't move them forward. Drinks are slightly more expense here and there is no free wi-fi! The smell of drugs also fills the air. I noticed a lot of passengers were returning to the ship quite quickly here, we left the ship at 11am and already 100's of people were coming back. By around 2/3pm I could see from the ship the beach was pretty empty. There isn't a lot do here and generally it just didn't feel very safe / welcoming.

**On-Board Shopping**

A few onboard shops including Pandora, we were disappointed to see there was a lack of general cosmetic products such as tooth paste and mouth wash (which we ran out of on the last day). Make sure you bring enough toothpaste / mouth wash  etc to last you for the whole cruise.

**MISC**

Other random Points

Our Baggage was delivered very quickly to our state room

The App worked okay and I liked the medallion and being able to see where my partner was

On the first day I was very confused why my stateroom door was always unlocked, it turns out your door automatically unlocks when your near the cabin.

Elevators were generally very fast

The Ship was super cold on Deck 6 and 7, with Deck 8 being okay.

There were several strange guests on board, on day 1 an older gentleman came up to me and shook my hand he then said ""I am captain of this ship and I am telling you no one has travelled further than me"" , I looked back at him rather confused and just said ""okay"". It was obvious he wasn't the captain of the ship and was just a guest, he then went back to his wife and said 'see everyone thinks I am the captain', he then continued to do this for the entire evening to other guests.

Another older guest followed my partner and I around the ship and kept complementing her on how beautiful she looked...we found this a little strange but managed to loose him and didn't see him again...

Several older men in their 70's+ came up to me multiple times during the cruise (whilst I was with my partner) and told me 'I looked handsome', 'I dressed very well' , 'my shirt was beautiful' I found this a little strange...

A lot of people were sick I believe due to the Air Conditioning being so cold with constant coughing and sneezing.

We were on Deck 12 and there is a party most nights between 10pm and 12am on the Pool Deck and the music is super loud that it kept us up most nights even on Deck 12!

Disembarkation was chaos, we had to wait over 60 minutes to get of the ship with hundreds of other guests due to an issue at Port Everglades (not a Princess fault).

**Overall**

I would give the cruise overall a 3.75/5 I would go on Sun Princess again but only if the itinerary and price were good and I would definitely ensure I bring some of my own items like books, games etc to keep myself entertained on port days! I wanted to try Princess for a while and paid a base fare of $2,000 for two people in a balcony cabin, I then paid extra for the plus package one month before my cruise.

The excitement of visiting a new country made me forget one key detail: my body doesn’t handle early mornings and coffee well. That realization hit me as soon as the seatbelt sign came on.

At first, it was a mild discomfort. I figured I could wait until the plane reached cruising altitude. But as we took off, turbulence struck—both outside the plane and inside my stomach.

I clenched everything I could, trying to appear calm as the flight attendants began their safety announcements. My seatmate, a chatty retiree, was thrilled to tell me about their grandchildren and favorite knitting patterns. I nodded politely, but internally, I was in full panic mode.

Once the seatbelt sign turned off, I let out a sigh of relief. But just as I unbuckled, the captain’s voice came over the intercom: “We’re expecting some turbulence, so we’ll keep the seatbelt sign on for a little longer.”

My heart sank. The pressure in my stomach wasn’t just discomfort anymore—it was becoming urgent. I stared longingly at the restroom door, only a few rows away but feeling like it was on the other side of the world.

As the turbulence worsened, I gripped the armrests, both to steady myself and to maintain control over my internal situation. I tried deep breathing, but it only seemed to intensify the pressure. My seatmate asked if I was okay, and I gave them a weak thumbs-up.

Finally, the turbulence eased, and the seatbelt sign turned off. I bolted out of my seat, dodging the flight attendant with the beverage cart and awkwardly squeezing past a passenger in the aisle.

The moment I reached the tiny airplane bathroom, it felt like I’d conquered Mount Everest. I locked the door, took a deep breath, and… sweet relief.

When I returned to my seat, my neighbor chuckled and said, “Rough ride, huh?” I laughed nervously, grateful they didn’t ask for details. The rest of the flight was smooth, and I learned an important lesson: avoid coffee before early morning flights—or at least sit closer to the bathroom.",1,1733840472.0,toiletanxietystories,0,1.0,False

1hb2tgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nursingstudies/comments/1hb2tgj/30_top_nursing_interview_questions_answers_2024/,30 Top Nursing Interview Questions & Answers | 2024 (PART 2),"# Sample Nurse Interview Questions: Motivation and Core Values

These questions are designed to help interviewers understand your motivation and personal values. When answering such questions, you should share motivational stories from your life that convey your core values. 

# 1. What is one professional accomplishment that you are most proud of and why? 

Tell a story about one of your most noteworthy accomplishments at work. What was the accomplishment? What steps did you take to achieve it? Who else was involved in this accomplishment? What happened as a result of the accomplishment? 

**Sample answer:**

*Earning my advanced pediatric certification is something I worked very hard for, and it validates the years I have spent at the bedside.*

# 2. Have you ever felt dissatisfied with your work as a Nurse? What could have been done to make it better? 

Most nurses encounter difficulties while working. Talk about a time when you felt dissatisfied with your work. What were the circumstances, and what happened? What was your role? Why did you feel dissatisfied? What would you do differently now? What did you learn? 

**Sample answer:**

*I once became extremely dissatisfied because I was consistently being given easier assignments and not being given the ICU level of patients. It became frustrating, and while I understood that others needed to learn and gain experience, it quickly left me annoyed with my position, the unit, and the healthcare system.*

*I sat down and spoke to my nurse manager about my concerns and inquired why it was happening. The nurse manager was not aware of the situation and it was later determined that a few of the charge nurses were giving the sicker patients to their friends and not spreading them out amongst the nurses.*  

# 3. Describe a time when you went over and above your job requirements. What motivated you to put forth the extra effort? 

Talk about a specific instance when you went out of your way for your job or for a patient. What were the circumstances? Why did you choose to take the action? What did you do? What were the results? 

**Sample answer:**

*I personally feel like I give 110% to all of my patients every shift, but there was one that I grew especially close with. For some reason, the patient had been dropped off by a family member, and no one had come to see the child for months. It was obvious the patient was missing key developmental milestones and was becoming increasingly lonely and depressed.*

*I asked to become the primary nurse for the patient, which meant every time I worked, he would be assigned to me. I worked with him over several months to get him potty trained and to improve his vocabulary. I don’t know exactly why I was extra motivated, but at that time in our lives, the patient and I needed each other.*

# 4. Give an example of a mistake you’ve made. How did you handle it? 

It is important to admit that you make mistakes and to own up to them. Talk about the specific mistake and why it happened. What was your role in the mistake? How did you know that you made a mistake? Who was involved? What did you learn? What have you done to improve? What were the results? 

**Sample answer:**

*Mistakes are part of nursing, whether we like to admit to it or not. It’s important to learn from those mistakes and become a better nurse. One mistake that I will never forget is leaving the gastronomy tube unclamped with medication administration.*

*Because it was unclamped when I opened the port to give the next medication, the last medication, as well as formula, came out. I was unable to clamp it quickly enough, and the medications I had already given were leaking onto the bed.* 

*I had to speak with the medical team and pharmacy to discuss replacing them. I have never forgotten to clamp the gastronomy tube again.*

# 5. What do you find most difficult about being a Nurse? How do you overcome this difficulty? 

Be honest and talk about the most difficult component of nursing. Maybe it’s working with a specific patient population. Or acting in a leadership role. Whatever it is to you, always make sure to talk about the steps and actions you’ve taken to cope with the difficulty.

**Sample answer:**

*The most difficult aspect of being a nurse is watching a patient die, especially one that I have cared for when they were healthy. Watching the family lose a loved one is heartbreaking. Sometimes I sit in the bathroom and take a moment for myself to cry, to reflect, and to pause to remember the patient. Death is part of our everyday world, and sometimes that is hard to remember.*

# Questions to Ask the Employer

Interviewing is a two-way street. Often, nurses are so excited and nervous about answering questions well during their interviews that they forget to ask questions to their potential future employers.

After all, how do you know if the job is an excellent fit unless you ask about the details that are important to you?

Most of the time, when you reach the end of your interview, employers will ask interviewees if they have any questions about the position. This is a great opportunity to show that you have done your research on their facility and expected job duties and demonstrate how excited you are about the position. 

Depending on time, you may want to consider limiting your questions to two or three questions. Most nursing administrators set aside an allotted amount of time to interview each potential new hire, and you don’t want to be disrespectful of their time. 

Many of these questions may also be great to ask after you have the job and work 1:1 with a preceptor or other helpful nurses. Experienced nurses are great resources for questions once you get the job!

# Sample Questions To Ask During an Interview: Onboarding

1. How long is the training period, and what does it entail?
2. How will my training success be measured?
3. Will I have orientation days, and what will they entail?
4. What advice would you give to a nurse who is just starting on the unit?
5. How quickly are you looking to hire someone?
6. Who will I be reporting to?
7. What shifts are you hiring for: night, day, mid-shift, or alternating?
8. Will I be required to work on-call shifts?

# Sample Questions To Ask During an Interview: Mentoring

1. Will I be assigned a preceptor?
2. How will my success as a new hire be measured?
3. What is your training process for new hires?
4. What advice do you have for a new hire who wants to succeed in this unit?
5. How frequently do you perform performance reviews?

# Sample Questions To Ask During an Interview: Culture

1. Can you explain what the nursing culture is like here?
2. Does the nursing staff face any ongoing challenges on the unit? What are the most critical challenges?
3. What is the management style of this unit?
4. What does an ideal candidate look like for this role?
5. How does this nursing environment facilitate collaboration and unity?

# Sample Questions To Ask During an Interview: Professional Development

1. Are there any professional development opportunities?
2. How long do nurses work at the bedside before taking on a charge nurse role?
3. Do you offer tuition reimbursement for nurses advancing their education to take on higher-level nursing roles?
4. Are nurses encouraged to become certified in their specialties?
5. Will I be expected to float to other units? How often will that occur?

# Sample Questions for New Nursing Graduates

1. Do you offer a new nursing graduate program, how long is it, and what does it entail?
2. How are new graduates measured on performance and competency?
3. Do new graduates have a mentor? How long do they provide supervision and nursing support?
4. What are the most common challenges new grads experience in this unit?
5. When will I be eligible to become involved on unit committees? 

# Other Important Questions You May Want to Ask

You will not have enough time to ask all of these questions during your interview, but you may want to pick one or two to ask if there is any remaining time left. 

Otherwise, keep these questions handy for when you have an opportunity to ask them in the future. They may help provide essential information to help you exceed expectations in your new job!

* What electronic medical record (EMR) system does this facility use?
* Describe the patient population on the unit and how many patients will we have at capacity?
* Do you have overtime policies for nurses who want to work extra shifts?
* What are staffing ratios here?
* How does the scheduling process work?
* What are your protocols for dealing with challenging or difficult patients?

# Things to Do Before Leaving the Interview

Remember to ask what the next steps in the interview process are and express your interest in the position. 

You may also want to ask if the hiring manager has any hesitations about hiring you based on your resume and work experience. That way, if they have any reservations, they can tell you, and you can rebuke them by explaining why they have no reason for hesitation.**Things to Do Before Leaving the Interview**

Remember to ask what the next steps in the interview process are and express your interest in the position. 

For example, if the hiring manager says something like, “I am not sure that you have enough critical care experience to take on this position,” you can respond and assure them that you are perfect for the role.

You may want to say something like, “I have always wanted to work in a high-acuity environment. I am extremely dedicated and eager to learn new skills necessary to succeed in this role. I am like a sponge and ready to learn!”

Remember to close the interview on a high note before walking away.

# How to Prepare for Your Nursing Interview 

# 1. Dress for success

You don’t get a second chance to make a first impression! In fact, many hiring managers say they know if they are interested in hiring someone within the first five minutes. 

It is essential to look professional and air on the more conservative side of style versus wearing bright and flashy clothing. Keep jewelry simple and understated. If it is appropriate to wear a suit, stick to neutral colors such as black, navy, or dark brown shades.

Your goal is to look as professional as possible so the person you are speaking with can focus on the essential skills you will bring to their organization.

# 2. Practice answering as many interview questions as you can out loud

Many interviewees review interview questions by reading them alone. But that may not help prepare you as well as speaking your answers out loud. In fact, you may find that you aren’t as clear on many of your answers as you thought you were.

Consider enlisting a friend or family member to act as the interviewer and ask you sample questions. Practice answering your questions and focus on ways you can communicate more effectively. Be assertive and don’t ramble. You will know if you are ready if you can answer questions clearly and constantly.

# 3. Research the institution thoroughly

LinkedIn is a great resource for learning about healthcare facilities and the types of employees who work there. Employers usually appreciate it when candidates show they have basic knowledge about an organization's goals. 

The last thing you want is to be asked something about the organization and not have an answer for it. 

# 4. Arrive at least 20 minutes or more before your interview starts

Arrive early enough that you can use the restroom if needed, straighten yourself up, and not feel rushed walking into the interview.

# 5. Bring a great attitude

Make sure you get plenty of shut-eye the night before your interview and eat a good breakfast. Drink coffee if it helps you perform at your best, but avoid it as it can make you jittery.

But most importantly, smile and bring a positive vibe. You are going to do great!

# Phone Interviews

Many employers do an initial phone interview before bringing candidates in to meet face-to-face. This often helps recruiters weed out candidates who aren’t serious about a position and offer additional information to candidates to make sure they really want the job. 

Bu phone interviews are just as important as in-person or online interviews. 

**Here are a few tips to remember:**

* Prepare for a phone interview the same way you would for a face-to-face interview. You have no way of predicting what questions will be asked, and it's better to be overly prepared than under-prepared.
* Stand up while you are talking. Standing during a phone interview may help you project your answers more clearly than if you are sitting down.
* Keep your resume and cover letter within reach in case you are asked about them.
* Don’t eat or drink during the phone interview, even though they can’t see you. 
* Shower and get ready as if it were a face-to-face interview. You will feel more confident and professional, and it may help you perform better.

# Zoom Interview Tips

Ever since the start of the pandemic, Zoom interviews have become exceedingly common. Employers continue to utilize online interviewing because it is often more accessible and convenient for everyone involved.

Preparing for a Zoom interview is similar to preparing for an in-person or phone interview. However, there are several tips you should keep in mind:

# 1. Dress professionally as if you were going to a face-to-face interview 

If you would have worn a suit to an in-person interview, consider wearing it for your Zoom interview. Remember that even though employers usually don’t see your lower half on Zoom, there is a slight chance you may have to stand up or grab something. So no pajama pants!

# 2. Make sure your background is set up nicely

The interviewer will see your surroundings, so make sure your background is clean and organized. Consider a blank wall so nothing distracts your interviewer from your amazing skills. Also, never have a window behind you because the light can drown you out. 

# 3. Keep it quiet

If you have roommates, let them know you will be on a Zoom interview, and they must stay quiet. If you have pets that have the potential to interrupt your interview, make arrangements for them beforehand. The last thing you want is for your cat to walk right in front of your screen!

# 4. Set up your Zoom space and practice the day before

If you are new to Zoom, don’t fret! It is a fairly simple platform to use. But it may be a good idea to set yourself up beforehand and practice so there are no surprises.

# 5. Ensure a good internet connection

No connection, no interview! Ensure that a quality connection is set up early so you don’t have to scramble when you should be starting your interview.

# 6. Practice with a friend

If you are new to Zoom, you may not be aware of your body language or how you present over video. Consider making a few Zoom calls with friends and family to get comfortable with it and ensure that you have an excellent video presence.

# Nursing Behavioral Interview Flash Cards With Answers

The second amendment means I am my own chief executive and commander in chief of my own military. I authorize my own act of self-defense in response to a hostile entity making war on me and my family.

Nelson Mandela says no form of viooence can be excused. Camus says it’s all the same, whether you live or die or have a cup of coffee. MLK says violence never brings permanent peace. Gandhi says that non-violence is the mightiest power available to mankind.

That’s who they tell you are heroes. That’s who our revolutionaries are.

Yet is that not capitalistic? Non-violence keeps the system working at full speed ahead.

What did it get us. Look in the mirror.

They want us to be non-violent, so that they can grow fat off the blood they take from us.

The only way out is through. Not all of us will make it. Each of us is our own chief executive. You have to decide what you will tolerate.

In Gladiator 1 Maximus cuts into the military tattoo that identifies him as part of the roman legion. His friend asks “Is that the sign of your god?” As Maximus carves deeper into his own flesh, as his own blood drips down his skin, Maximus smiles and nods yes. The tattoo represents the emperor, who is god. The god emperor has made himself part of Maximus’s own flesh. The only way to destroy the emperor is to destroy himself. Maximus smiles through the pain because he knows it is worth it.

These might be my last words. I don’t know when they will come for me. I will resist them at any cost. That’s why I smile through the pain.

They diagnosed my mother with severe neuropathy when she was forty-one years old. She said it started ten years before that with burning sensations in her feet and occasional sharp stabbing pains. At first the pain would last a few moments, then fade to tingling, then numbness, then fade to nothing a few days later.

The first time the pain came she ignored it. Then it came a couple times a year and she ignored it. Then every couple months. Then a couple times a month. Then a couple times a week. At that point by the time the tingling faded to numbness, the pain would start, and the discomfort was constant. At that point even going from the couch to the kitchen to make her own lunch became a major endeavor

She started with ibuprofen, until the stomach aches and acid reflux made her switch to acetaminophen. Then the headaches and barely sleeping made her switch back to ibuprofen.

The first doctor said it was psychosomatic. Nothing was wrong. She needed to relax, destress, sleep more.

The second doctor said it was a compressed nerve in her spine. She needed back surgery. It would cost $180,000. Recovery would be six months minimum before walking again. Twelve months for full potential recovery, and she would never lift more than ten pounds of weight again.

The third doctor performed a Nerve Conduction Study, Electromyography, MRI, and blood tests. Each test cost $800 to $1200. She hit the $6000 deductible of her UnitedHealthcare plan in October. Then the doctor went on vacation, and my mother wasn’t able to resume tests until January when her deductible reset.

The tests showed severe neuropathy. The $180,000 surgery would have had no effect.

They prescribed opioids for the pain. At first the pain relief was worth the price of constant mental fog and constipation. She didn’t tell me about that until later. All I remember is we took a trip for the first time in years, when she drove me to Monterey to go to the aquarium. I saw an otter in real life, swimming on its back. We left at 7am and listened to Green Day on the four-hour car ride. Over time, the opioids stopped working. They made her MORE sensitive to pain, and she felt withdrawal symptoms after just two or three hours.

Then gabapentin. By now the pain was so bad she couldn’t exercise, which compounded the weight gain from the slowed metabolic rate and hormonal shifts. And it barely helped the pain, and made her so fatigued she would go an entire day without getting out of bed.

Then Corticosteroids. Which didn’t even work.

The pain was so bad I would hear my mother wake up in the night screaming in pain. I would run into her room, asking if she’s OK. Eventually I stopped getting up. She’d yell out anguished shrieks of wordless pain or the word “gently caress” stretched and distended to its limits. I’d turn over and go back to sleep.

All of this while they bled us dry with follow-up appointment after follow-up appointment, specialist consultations, and more imagine scans. Each appointment was promised to be fully covered, until the insurance claims were delayed and denied. Allopathic medicine did nothing to help my mother’s suffering. Yet it is the foundation of our entire society.

My mother told me that on a good day the nerve pain was like her legs were immersed in ice water. On a bad day it felt like her legs were clamped in a machine shop vice, screwed down to where the cranks stopped turning, then crushed further until her ankle bones sprintered and cracked to accommodate the tightening clamp. She had more bad days than good.

My mother crawled to the bathroom on her hands and knees. I slept in the living room to create more distance from her cries in the night. I still woke up, and still went back to sleep.

Back then I thought there was nothing I could do.

The high copays made consistent treatment impossible. New treatments were denied as “not medically necessary.” Old treatments didn’t work, and still put us out for thousands of dollars.

UnitedHealthcare limited specialist consultations to twice a year.

Then they refused to cover advanced imaging, which the specialists required for an appointment.

Prior authorizations took weeks, then months.

UnitedHealthcare constantly changed their claim filing procedure. They said my mother’s doctor needed to fax his notes. Then UnitedHealthcare said they did not save faxed patient correspondence, and required a hardcopy of the doctor’s typed notes to be mailed. Then they said they never received the notes. They were unable to approve the claim until they had received and filed the notes.

They promised coverage, and broke their word to my mother.

With every delay, my anger surged. With every denial, I wanted to throw the doctor through the glass wall of their hospital waiting room.

But it wasn’t them. It wasn’t the doctors, the receptionists, administrators, pharmacists, imaging technicians, or anyone we ever met. It was UnitedHealthcare.

People are dying. Evil has become institutionalized. Corporations make billions of dollars off the pain, suffering, death, and anguished cries in the night of millions of Americans.

We entered into an agreement for healthcare with a legally binding contract that promised care commensurate with our insurance payments and medical needs. Then UnitedHealthcare changes the rules to suit their own profits. They think they make the rules, and think that because it’s legal that no one can punish them.

They think there’s no one out there who will stop them.

Now my own chronic back pain wakes me in the night, screaming in pain. I sought out another type of healing that showed me the real antidote to what ails us.

I bide my time, saving the last of my strength to strike my final blows. All extractors must be forced to swallow the bitter pain they deal out to millions.

As our own chief executives, it’s our obligation to make our own lives better. First and foremost, we must seek to improve our own circumstances and defend ourselves. As we do so, our actions have ripple effects that can improve the lives of others.

Rules exist between two individuals, in a network that covers the entire earth. Some of these rules are written down. Some of these rules emerge from natural respect between two individuals. Some of these rules are defined in physical laws, like the properties of gravity, magnetism or the potential energy stored in the chemical bonds of potassium nitrate.

No single document better encapsulates the belief that all people are equal in fundamental worth and moral status and the frameworks for fostering collective well-being than the US constitution.

Writing a rule down makes it into a law. I don’t give a gently caress about the law. Law means nothing. What does matter is following the guidance of our own logic and what we learn from those before us to maximize our own well-being, which will then maximize the well-being of our loved ones and community.

That’s where UnitedHealthcare went wrong. They violated their contract with my mother, with me, and tens of millions of other Americans. This threat to my own health, my family’s health, and the health of our country’s people requires me to respond with an act of war.

1hb2sdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/toiletanxietystories/comments/1hb2sdj/airplane_turbulence/,Airplane Turbulence,"I was finally on my dream vacation, sitting in my window seat, ready to take off. The excitement of visiting a new country made me forget one key detail: my body doesn’t handle early mornings and coffee well. That realization hit me as soon as the seatbelt sign came on.

At first, it was a mild discomfort. I figured I could wait until the plane reached cruising altitude. But as we took off, turbulence struck—both outside the plane and inside my stomach.

I clenched everything I could, trying to appear calm as the flight attendants began their safety announcements. My seatmate, a chatty retiree, was thrilled to tell me about their grandchildren and favorite knitting patterns. I nodded politely, but internally, I was in full panic mode.

Once the seatbelt sign turned off, I let out a sigh of relief. But just as I unbuckled, the captain’s voice came over the intercom: “We’re expecting some turbulence, so we’ll keep the seatbelt sign on for a little longer.”

My heart sank. The pressure in my stomach wasn’t just discomfort anymore—it was becoming urgent. I stared longingly at the restroom door, only a few rows away but feeling like it was on the other side of the world.

As the turbulence worsened, I gripped the armrests, both to steady myself and to maintain control over my internal situation. I tried deep breathing, but it only seemed to intensify the pressure. My seatmate asked if I was okay, and I gave them a weak thumbs-up.

Finally, the turbulence eased, and the seatbelt sign turned off. I bolted out of my seat, dodging the flight attendant with the beverage cart and awkwardly squeezing past a passenger in the aisle.

The moment I reached the tiny airplane bathroom, it felt like I’d conquered Mount Everest. I locked the door, took a deep breath, and… sweet relief.

When I returned to my seat, my neighbor chuckled and said, “Rough ride, huh?” I laughed nervously, grateful they didn’t ask for details. The rest of the flight was smooth, and I learned an important lesson: avoid coffee before early morning flights—or at least sit closer to the bathroom.",1,1733840381.0,toiletanxietystories,0,1.0,False

NOTE: Names have been changed for privacy.

I(F55) met someone(M26) that I’m super excited about. I had to tell someone, so am posting it here. I’m happy to hear people’s thoughts or comments.

This past Saturday, I attended a wedding. Prior and during the ceremony, I thought that I kept catching a handsome young man looking at me. He seemed familiar but I couldn’t place him.

During the cocktail hour, while I was making small talk with a friend, he came over. “Hello Monika, How are you? It’s been a long time.”

His voice was familiar, but I still wasn’t placing him. He must have seen my confusion that he knew my name. “You don’t remember me. I’m Keith.”

Once I heard his name, I realized that Keith had worked at the coffee shop that I had stopped at every morning for many years. He was a skinny kid with scraggly long hair. Now he had filled out, had close-cut hair, and looked amazing in his tux.

We ended up talking for the rest of cocktail hour, until everyone had to find their places for the reception. He found me again after dinner. We talked and danced throughout the reception. As the reception came to an end, there was some discussion about an after-party, but we ended up back in his hotel room.

We ended up spending the night together, all-day sunday, and I spent the night at his condo on Sunday, and showing up for work late on Monday.

Keith is amazing! Smart, funny, cultured… We just click. It’s only been a few days, but I find myself thinking long-term with him.

I’m a little scared about how I’ve fallen for him. It’s not so much the age difference(almost thirty years), as the fact that I first met him when he was seventeen. Though for the first few years that I knew him, we maybe talked for a few minutes, with inane conversation like the weather or maybe sports.

One concern is that he admitted that he has always had a thing for me. And that I was by far the most beautiful and sexy customer at the coffee shop. Am I just a fantasy to him?",6,1733840189.0,Cougars_Den,2,1.0,False
